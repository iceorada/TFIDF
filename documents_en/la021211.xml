<DH>A Monrovia auto dealer will activate a solar energy system
-- and reap the savings</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For Peter Hoffman, there's no incongruity in being part of the auto
industry and being environmentally concerned.</LD>
<LD>   The 52-year-old president of his family's Sierra Autocars
dealership in Monrovia graduated from UCLA School of Law, where he
wrote about solar energy and conservation for its journal of
environmental law.</LD>
<LD>   Hoffman worked one summer at a solar energy research institute. He
installed a solar water-heating system at his home in 1979. He drives
a 57-miles-per-gallon, gasoline-electric Honda Insight hybrid car.</LD>
<TE>   He has been avid about curtailing electrical consumption at
Sierra's 6.5-acre facility and says efforts in the last two years to
eliminate unneeded lighting, turn off computers at night and reduce
heating and air conditioning have resulted in a 20% reduction in use.</TE>
<TE>   So it didn't take all that much for Herb Mendelsohn from 3 Phases
Solar, a 2-year-old Manhattan Beach solar energy systems designer and
integrator, to make a sale. On Tuesday, Hoffman will trip the switch
that activates a $400,000 solar energy system on the roof of the
service area for Sierra's Honda and General Motors franchises.</TE>
<TE>   Mendelsohn, a 3 Phases account executive, says he called on "just
about every auto dealer in Southern California" trying to sell the
idea that solar makes sense for them. Sierra's is one of just a few,
and by far the largest, of the solar power installations at the
region's new-car dealerships, he says.</TE>
<TE>   Solar makes sense in car dealerships, he says, because they
typically have the big, flat-roofed structures that make installation
of sizable solar arrays economically and physically possible.
Dealerships also have electrical usage patterns that benefit from
daylight solar generation and nighttime use of power bought at
off-peak rates.</TE>
<TE>   In Sierra's case, Hoffman figures that the 50-kilowatt system will
help reduce his draw on power from Southern California Edison Co.
during the day, especially when the air conditioning is going full
bore. On slow Sundays, the system could even generate excess power
that would automatically flow back onto the electrical grid and be
sold to Edison.</TE>
<TE>   Hoffman says that the monthly electricity bill for his main
facility runs from $10,000 to $15,000 and that he expects to see it
decline by $1,500 to $2,000 with the solar power system in operation.
Amortizing a $400,000 system at that pace would take at least 16 1/2
years.</TE>
<TE>   But tax incentive and rebate programs helped cinch the deal,
Hoffman says.</TE>
<TE>   Edison, which supplies electrical power in Monrovia, offers 50%
rebates on commercial power systems. State and federal tax credits
will reduce Sierra's out-of-pocket cost by about 12% more, he says,
leaving the dealership with a direct cost of $152,000. And that,
Mendelsohn notes, can be paid in 7 1/2 years from the dealership's
monthly power bill savings.</TE>
<TE>   "It's nice," Hoffman says, "to be able to do something that's
socially responsible and economically sound."</TE>
<TE>   Global warming resolutions</TE>
<TE>   A coalition of environmental groups with investments in General
Motors Corp. and Ford Motor Co. stock is set to announce this morning
that it will file global warming proxy resolutions with both
automakers today.</TE>
<TE>   The resolutions will demand that the companies -- ranked No. 1 and
2 in the world in new-vehicle sales -- implement programs to reduce
the production of so-called greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide
that are believed to contribute to global warming. Greenhouse gases
are produced in automakers' factories and in the tailpipe emission of
the cars and trucks they build.</TE>
<TE>   The coalition members can file the resolutions because they are
shareholders. The resolutions then must be voted on by all
shareholders at the GM and Ford annual meetings in 2003.</TE>
<TE>   Lead organizations in the coalition are the New Jersey-based
Tri-State Coalition for Responsible Investment and the Investor
Responsibility Research Center and the Union of Concerned Scientists,
both based in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   Honda comes out cleanest</TE>
<TE>   Honda Motor Co. has the cleanest overall passenger vehicle fleet
in the U.S., truck-heavy DaimlerChrysler has the dirtiest, and Ford
has jumped ahead of General Motors in the green-car sweepstakes,
according to a new report by the Union of Concerned Scientists.</TE>
<TE>   The group's biennial ranking is based on published emissions and
fuel economy data from the federal Environmental Protection Agency
and looks at the model year 2001 fleets of the six largest automakers
active in the U.S. In all, the companies sell 90% of the passenger
vehicles in the country.</TE>
<TE>   Their vehicles, though, account for 93% of all smog-forming
pollution and 92% of all carbon dioxide emissions from motor
vehicles, says Jason Mark, the study's author and director of the UCS
Clean Vehicles Program.</TE>
<TE>   Industry leader Honda was followed by Toyota Motor Corp., Nissan
Motor Co., Ford, GM and DaimlerChrysler.</TE>
<TE>   Ford was the only one of the six companies to move up in the
ratings, supplanting GM because of its efforts to reduce smog-forming
emissions in its truck fleet, Mark says.</TE>
<TE>   The lead is narrow, though. Ford promised two years ago to boost
its sport utility vehicle fuel economy by 25%, and although it is
moving in that direction, Mark says, mileage for the rest of its
trucks is dropping and erasing Ford's SUV gains.</TE>
<TE>   The combined gas mileage rating for Ford's truck fleet is a mere
one-tenth of a mile per gallon better than GM's. And overall, Mark
says, Ford vehicles still emit slightly more carbon dioxide, one of
the gases linked to global warming, than do GM's.</TE>
<TE>   Honda in fuel-cell deal</TE>
<TE>   Canadian fuel cell maker Ballard Power Systems has signed a
contract to sell 32 fuel cells to Honda during the next three years.</TE>
<TE>   Honda says it intends to place 30 fuel-cell vehicles into test
fleet use in California and Japan between now and the end of 2005,
with five of them already snapped up by the city of Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Actor's 'drive to survive'</TE>
<TE>   Actor Dennis Weaver has been an environmentalist for decades and
in recent years has become a big believer in hydrogen engines and the
need to develop passenger vehicles that don't depend on oil.</TE>
<TE>   He lives near Denver and runs an organization called the Institute
of Ecolonomics, whose purpose is to promote an economy based on
environmentally friendly technologies.</TE>
<TE>   As part of his drive to increase public and political awareness of
alternative energy sources, Weaver is sponsoring a cross-country
"Drive to Survive" that will start May 1 in Los Angeles and wind up
in Washington on May 21.</TE>
<TE>   He's looking for alternative-fuel vehicles -- and their owners --
to participate.</TE>
<TE>   Those interested can contact Weaver through the institute, (970)
626-3820, or via the program's Internet site, www
.drivetosurvive.info.</TE>

<HD>Murano SUV an appealing work of art</HD>
<DH>Nissan's new crossover vehicle inspired by Italian glass
looks great and has lots of power, but the price is steep.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>John O'Dell</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There are those who contend that the sport utility vehicle explosion
has populated our highways with a sea of lumbering, blocky, bulky,
fuel-guzzling and downright ugly vehicles.</LD>
<LD>   Say what you will about the others, Nissan's new Murano is going
to prove the critics wrong on all counts.</LD>
<LD>   This is a vehicle whose lines and name were inspired by the glass
art of Murano, Italy, and although Nissan's early research found that
33% of the people who saw it hated it, I'd stuff ballot boxes to get
it declared the prettiest sport utility ever.</LD>
<TE>   And with its 245-horsepower V-6, the Murano is anything but
lumbering. Its combination of advanced transmission technology and
streamlined bodywork makes it pretty darned fuel-efficient too: 20
miles per gallon in city driving and 24 or 25 -- depending on the
choice of front- or all-wheel drive -- on the highway.</TE>
<TE>   Although the Murano is too pretty to be called an SUV, Nissan
nonetheless insists on doing so -- afraid, no doubt, that to call it
by another name would limit its appeal.</TE>
<TE>   It is, by definition, a crossover: the sheet metal, tall seating,
cargo space and commanding ride height of a big wagon or SUV on the
unitized body of a passenger car. Using the car-type platform,
instead of a standard SUV's body-on-steel frame setup borrowed from
pickup trucks, makes most crossovers ride and handle better than
their truck-based counterparts.</TE>
<TE>   The Murano shares the platform that underpins the new Nissan
Altima and forthcoming Maxima but offers an all-wheel-drive version
and rides on 18-inch wheels. The four-wheel independent suspension is
beefier than the Altima's, with stiffer anti-sway bars and specially
tuned bushings to improve the heavier Murano's ride quality.</TE>
<TE>   Nissan stuffed the engine compartment with yet another version of
the 3.5-liter V-6 that, in various degrees of tuning, powers the
Nissan 350Z sports car, the Altima and nearly half a dozen other
Nissan and Infiniti offerings.</TE>
<TE>   Murano also has the first U.S. application of Nissan's
continuously variable transmission, beefed up to handle the engine's
246 foot-pounds of torque.</TE>
<TE>   The CVT, like others in the market, works by replacing standard
gears with two conical pulleys linked by a steel belt. The
transmission adjusts the belt's position on the cones in response to
the demand for power, keeping the engine running in the most
appropriate power range. Additionally, there are no "neutral" moments
between shifts -- there are no gears to shift -- so there is no
wasted energy. Nissan says its CVT boosts the Murano's fuel
efficiency 10%.</TE>
<TE>   Unlikely to make it as an off-road warrior -- Nissan sells the
Xterra and Pathfinder for those who go exploring -- the newest Nissan
certainly has the credentials to compete in the increasingly crowded
crossover arena.</TE>
<TE>   The downside might be price. It starts at close to $29,000 and
tops at more than $39,000 with all the bells and whistles.</TE>
<TE>   By contrast, competitors such as the Toyota Highlander, Chevrolet
TrailBlazer, Honda Pilot, Buick Rendezvous and Ford Explorer start
$1,000 to $3,000 lower (and that's before the rebates and discounted
interest rates the domestics are piling on).</TE>
<TE>   Drivers should avoid the low-end Murano SL model, which proved to
be a bit disappointing on the road.</TE>
<TE>   While putting it through its paces in San Diego County's
backcountry, I found it to exhibit excessive body roll on winding
roads. At higher speeds, it felt as if it wanted to lift off the road
each time it rebounded from a dip or bump.</TE>
<TE>   Those things won't bother most people, but if you like to push
your vehicles to the limits, the SL has pretty unremarkable limits
and not much transition between what it can do and what it shouldn't.</TE>
<TE>   By contrast, the SE model is tight, stable and quite willing, even
eager, to be pushed. The springs are stiffer, the bushings and shock
damping tighter, and it is a textbook example of the difference a few
hundred dollars of hardware can make in the way a vehicle performs.
The good news is that the SE starts at just $800 more than the SL in
each of the two-wheel and all-wheel drive configurations; all-wheel
drive is $1,600 more than two-wheel.</TE>
<TE>   Other than the feel of the SE when pushed to the edge, there's
little to dislike about the Murano in any trim level. As befits the
pricing -- which is at the top of the heap for Nissans, awfully close
to Infiniti territory -- the company has done an admirable job on fit
and finish, with smooth seams, no yawning gaps between body panels
and an interior that, keeping a reviewer's limited use in mind, seems
durable and comfortable.</TE>
<TE>   One complaint: The sharply raked windshield distractingly reflects
a lot of the wide dashboard in models with light-color interiors. But
that's easy to fix -- select a darker interior.</TE>
<TE>   Overall, the Murano is as interesting inside as out, with
adjustable pedals, a modern and well-planned instrument panel and
comfortable and supportive seats with an easy-to use mechanism for
folding the rear seats flat into the floor if you need more space.</TE>
<TE>   Cargo space is adequate, although if you have a lot to haul you
might want to look at Honda's cavernous Pilot or Chevy's TrailBlazer
instead. The Murano claims a maximum 82 cubic feet of cargo area with
the rear seats down, versus 100 in the Chevy, 90 in the Honda and 88
in Ford's Explorer. Only Toyota's Highlander, with 81 cubic feet, has
less.</TE>
<TE>   The Murano also spares us a third-row seat fit only for very small
people or medium-sized grocery bags. Instead of pretending to have
room for seven or eight it proudly admits that it is a five-seat
vehicle and doesn't offer a third row even as an option. (Nissan
salespeople happily will steer those with big families or hefty
carpool commitments to the upcoming Quest minivan or Pathfinder SUV.)</TE>
<TE>   Final Words: Looks great, lots of power, spiffy CVT,
better-than-average mileage -- if you don't need to go off-road,
don't haul an army and can't see yourself behind the wheel of a
minivan or a wagon, put the Murano on your consideration list.</TE>

<HD>Nissan to roll out new, redesigned offerings</HD>
<DH>The 2004 Maxima will be the first to arrive in March. Four
more vehicles will follow.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Nissan continues its onslaught of new products next year with five
all-new or redesigned vehicles.</LD>
<LD>   The parade will start in March with the redesigned, re-engineered
2004 Maxima. Company representatives are offering little in the way
of detail, but they have released this first photo of their
top-of-the-line sedan.</LD>
<LD>   The side view suggests that Nissan designers were still smitten
with the lines of the Altima when they sat down at the drawing board.
Indeed, the Maxima shares its platform with the Altima and the
just-introduced Murano crossover SUV.</LD>
<TE>   The official word, though, is that the Maxima will provide "the
soul" of the Z sports car introduced this summer "wrapped in a
premium sports sedan design." That means, among other things, that
the Maxima's 3.5- liter V-6 -- shared with the Altima, the Murano,
the 350Z, the upcoming Quest minivan and the Infiniti G35 coupe and
sedan -- will be tuned to be closer to the Z's 287 horsepower than to
the Altima's 245 horses.</TE>
<TE>   Other new 2004 models in the Nissan parade next year will be the
Quest and the 350Z convertible in early summer and two company
firsts: a full-size sport utility vehicle in September and a
full-size pickup in November.</TE>

<HD>Avoiding disaster on foggy roadways</HD>
<DH>Many drive too fast when visibility is poor. Pulling far
off onto the shoulder is sometimes the safest option.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Ralph Vartabedian</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The massive collision on the Long Beach Freeway on Nov. 3 represented
a breakdown of order and rational behavior, sending 198 vehicles into
a massive junk pile in soupy fog.</LD>
<LD>   With visibility reduced to just a few feet that Sunday morning,
one car after another plowed into each other. In some cases, drivers
were speeding through the dense fog at 70 mph; in other cases they
managed to crash at 20 miles mph, according to witnesses. More than
100 people were treated at eight hospitals after the accident, though
miraculously no one was killed.</LD>
<LD>   Fog experts say there were plenty of steps drivers could have
taken to reduce their chances of getting trapped and to avoid serious
injury.</LD>
<TE>   Sgt. Ted Eichman, chairman of the California Highway Patrol's fog
committee, said fog-related accidents occur because motorists badly
misjudge their stopping distance in fog and continue to drive too
fast on obscured roadways. "Most of these collisions are just people
going too fast through the fog," he said. "It isn't the fog killing
people."</TE>
<TE>   The CHP classifies visibility of between 200 and 500 feet as
dangerous and less than 200 feet as critical. As visibility decreases
into the danger zone, it's important to pull onto the shoulder as far
as possible, he said. If cars are piling into each other, he
recommends that drivers parked on the shoulder leave their vehicles,
run and hop the freeway fence to reduce the risk of being rear-ended.</TE>
<TE>   In dense fog, drivers often steer their vehicles by following the
taillights of the vehicle ahead -- blind reliance on a stranger and
hardly responsible driving.</TE>
<TE>   Being able to react and stop if the driver ahead slams on the
brakes is not enough. The car ahead may come to an instant standstill
if it enters a crash pile, a far different scenario than an emergency
stop in which the vehicle ahead of you continues moving forward as it
slows.</TE>
<TE>   There are several other fog-related problems that can contribute
to accidents.</TE>
<TE>   In daylight fog, drivers often neglect to turn on the car's
headlights. Whether day or night, experts advise driving with low
beams on in foggy conditions. High beams create more light scatter
that further obscures vision.</TE>
<TE>   Fog lamps are quickly becoming popular, according to the National
Highway Traffic Safety Administration. Their beams are aimed lower so
not as much light scatters, and they often use amber light that may
better penetrate fog.</TE>
<TE>   Most fog lamps are aftermarket items installed by car owners. That
means they are not subject to federal testing or approval. The lamps
that are offered as options on new cars must conform to general
federal standards on lamps.</TE>
<TE>   The growing popularity of fog lamps also is triggering an increase
in complaints about glare. In many cases, these fog lamps use high
intensity discharge lamps; their blue hue often seems brighter than
standard bulbs.</TE>
<TE>   Increased fog lamp use "is accompanied by frequent misuse of these
lamps: using fog lamps during conditions other than permitted by most
states' laws," NHTSA said, meaning they are used when there is no
fog.</TE>
<TE>   What's more, to the extent fog lamps are used to help motorists
stay within the lane lines, they are perpetuating a dangerous
situation. If you can see only the lane lines immediately in front of
your vehicle, it probably means it's too foggy to be driving, Eichman
said.</TE>
<TE>   Eichman said in extremely dense fog, the CHP will close some
interstate segments, though that creates another set of problems.
Drivers who attempt to find alternative local roads in the fog can
face greater risks, because local roads often have just two lanes and
drivers may be unfamiliar with the route.</TE>
<TE>   But more could be done.</TE>
<TE>   John Crosby, vice president of engineering at EnviroTech Sensors
in Maryland, said highway departments across the country have not
made improvements that could help reduce fog-related crashes a
priority. EnviroTech makes sensors that can measure visibility and
provide police and other authorities with crucial information about
emergency conditions.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a lot of technology there, but states haven't put it
together," Crosby said. "It isn't sexy. The budget for weather
technology is very small. Everything is eaten up by building roads
and paying consultants."</TE>
<TE>   The company's sensors aren't cheap, but at $3,500 each, a 100-
mile stretch of road can be monitored for about $35,000, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Given the number of deaths associated with fog, spending several
million dollars might make sense. According to figures from the
NHTSA, 628 people died in crashes associated with foggy conditions in
2001. That's far more deaths than were associated with defective
Firestone tires on Ford Explorers, a matter that created a national
uproar.</TE>

<HD>To director, it's got to feel real</HD>
<DH>Charles Stone III is committed to authentic characters,
whether it's his 'Whassup?' beer ads or a feature film about college
band drum lines.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bob Baker</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Director Charles Stone III's career trajectory has produced a trio of
strikingly dissimilar works: (1) Budweiser's "Whassup?" TV
commercials, (2) a feature film about the rise of three '80s cocaine
kingpins in Harlem, and (3) a forthcoming look at the flamboyant
sub-subculture of college marching band drum corps.</LD>
<LD>   Just shows you what can happen when your mom takes you to fencing
and pottery lessons and museums, your dad quotes inspiring literature
around the house and you fall in love with classic Warner Bros.
animation, "The 7th Voyage of Sinbad" and "Star Wars."</LD>
<LD>   Stone, 36, still best known for writing, directing and acting in
those Bud commercials, which thrust a slang expression into the heart
of mainstream culture in 2000, will enjoy his major-league taste of
the cinema spotlight Friday when Fox releases "Drumline," a drama of
competition and redemption set at fictional Atlanta A&amp;T, a
historically black college.</LD>
<TE>   Stone, who spent most of his 20s directing music videos, has no
trouble connecting the dots between "Drumline," the Bud spots and the
surprisingly sensitive dope-dealer film "Paid in Full," which was
released by Miramax's Dimension Films in only a few hundred theaters
in October and quickly disappeared.</TE>
<TE>   "Real people," he said in a phone interview from his home in
Brooklyn. "Realistic people that are approachable to the viewer."</TE>
<TE>   Stone's Bud spots, which won a slew of advertising awards, grew
out of a two-minute short film called "True" that he made for $1,000
in a day and a half in 1998 with some old friends from Philadelphia,
where he grew up. The film, which he hoped would be his ticket to
feature film directing, found its humor in the unspoken bonds within
the greeting "Whassup?" -- and the answer: "Just chillin'." It played
well at a music video association short-film festival in L.A.,
winning Stone an agent and a number of directing offers, including
"Paid in Full."</TE>
<TE>   Coincidentally, a copy of "True" fell into the hands of a Chicago
ad agency retained by Budweiser, which signed up Stone to translate
the short into a series of commercials. ("Whassup?" "Watchin' the
game. Havin' a Bud.") After auditioning scores of actors, the agency
agreed to let Stone and his pals play the roles.</TE>
<TE>   The spots were not only funny (in one, a patron of a Japanese
restaurant verbally stretches his pronunciation of the condiment
wasabi until it is indistinguishable from "Whassup"), but also
transcendent: An African American catch phrase was demystified to
illustrate the way friends of all cultures--particularly male
friends, and even more particularly male sports-buff friends--are
able to communicate in the simplest of expressions.</TE>
<TE>   "It's two guys on the telephone who appear to be talking about
nothing but, if you will, are holding hands," Stone said. The focus
is on "the grunts and nods and between words, some of those little
idiosyncrasies, the funny details about being human."</TE>
<TE>   By spring 2000, the "Whassup" spots were being parodied in every
medium, creating the kind of buzz advertisers dream of. Stone was
trying to move on in his career but was continually greeted by
strangers asking him the inevitable rhetorical question. (After he
shaved his beard last year, he said, it seemed to abate.)</TE>
<TE>   The little-noticed "Paid in Full," a fictional account based on
the lives of three actual hustlers, is littered with nuanced moments
that distinguish it from other films about the way cocaine tore apart
poor communities in the '80s. Ace, the straight-arrow protagonist who
makes deliveries for a dry-cleaning business, is pulled slowly
against his nature into the drug trade. By the end he is the boss,
soberly watching his two pals make $10,000 bets at the kitchen table
on whether they can throw a crumpled wrapper into a trash can.</TE>
<TE>   Talking about the film, Stone is drawn to a scene in which one of
the now-wealthy kingpins, Mitch, who is enamored of neighborhood
recognition, comes home at night and meticulously folds his clothes
and lays his gold jewelry across them before getting into bed,
stripped of his trappings. "That shows the character without saying a
word. We need to be able to sit there and just take it in," Stone
said. Later on, Mitch boasts to Ace that his prominence as a dealer
makes him feel the way Magic Johnson or Larry Bird must feel on the
basketball court, when all eyes are on him.</TE>
<TE>   There are fewer opportunities for intimacies like that in the
wide-release "Drumline," an energetic story of conflict between a
gifted but undisciplined New York-bred freshman drummer and the
Atlanta A&amp;T senior marching band leader determined to mold him. Stone
said he was drawn to the script's emphasis on the tradition of
marching band halftime shows at black Southern colleges, where the
military-style flavor is replaced by a more athletic,
can-you-top-this sensibility. He said he aimed for a " 'Top Gun' with
drums" feel, "a Bruckheimer muscularity ... a sports movie."</TE>
<TE>   Within that brashness, one subtlety Stone relishes occurs when the
freshman, Devon, played by Nick Cannon, is on the phone to his
mother, telling her he's made first-string drum line. Their affection
and the generation gap between them are illustrated simultaneously.
"I just called to tell you that everything is everything," Devon says
near the end of the call. The camera shows him listening, then
saying: "Oh, come on now, you know what that means: 'It's all good.'
"</TE>
<TE>   Producer Wendy Finerman said she offered "Drumline" to Stone after
she saw a cut of "Paid in Full." "The fact that the 'Whassup?' spots
and 'Paid in Full' came from the same talent was startling to me,"
she said.</TE>
<TE>   The film, with a $20-million budget, was more than three times as
expensive as "Paid in Full" and will debut on about 1,800 screens.
Both films presented Stone with the challenge of telling another
writer's story--in the case of "Drumline," a script by Tina Gordon
Chism and Shawn Schepps, based on a story by Schepps. Stone says he
is currently sifting through scripts but has his heart set on
directing a work of his own --"creating a film from the seed of an
idea and developing it into the tree ... I haven't been able to do
that fully yet, in the sense of really letting the dialogue be as
poetic or lyrical as it is in 'True.' "</TE>
<TE>   He describes himself as a once-hyperactive child who benefited
from myriad influences. His father, journalist Chuck Stone, was one
of the first black columnists to appear in a major white-owned
newspaper. The son's talents were in the visual realm. He didn't like
to read but fell in love with the illustrated covers of sci-fi books.
When he was 10 or 11, he said, he saw "Star Wars" and his ambitions
fell into place. "That just upped the ante on me making that journey
into the world, it really fired me up. I would tell people, 'I'm
going to be a special-effects supervisor and animator like John
Dykstra or Richard Edlund.' "</TE>
<TE>   He played junior high football because wearing the gear made him
feel like a warrior. He studied animation at Rhode Island School of
Design, where he messed around playing drums and doing stand-up
comedy on amateur nights, then broke into hip-hop music videos after
graduation. "I figured I would go to New York, move to music videos,
maybe short films, then feature films. I had it all planned." Within
the planning came the surprise of directing TV commercials, and here
Stone was lucky: He hooked up with advertising agency executives who,
while white, did not try to homogenize the Bud spots, preserving
their genuineness.</TE>
<TE>   Stone, who is single, lives in Clinton Hill, a gentrified section
of Brooklyn. He has no plans to move to Hollywood; he's reluctant to
give up the creative moments that come from hanging with friends or
riding on subway or commuter trains. He says he is trying to slow the
pace of recent years and is contemplating his future. He's sure he'll
make a comedy someday. And he's sure he'll make a film "with
spaceships and laser beams." Whatever he does, he pledges, will be
"the human journey ... whether it's the year 4028 or the football
field."</TE>
<TE>   He also says he has a debt to pay to a beloved arts teacher at
Central High in Philadelphia, whom he described as yet another
inspiring force. "At some point, I have to go back and teach; I am so
compelled to go back and affect somebody like I was."</TE>

<HD>Family saga attains lofty sweep</HD>

<LD>"Alice in Exile" begins with such a modest reach, such quiet action,
that its ambition might surprise you. At first, it seems to be a love
story, one which will be confined to London in the year 1913, but
soon the horizon opens up to Yorkshire and the English countryside
and, many pages later, to France and Russia. One love story becomes
two, and the world collapses under the weight of war and revolution.</LD>
<LD>   Piers Paul Read's engrossing novel is also a meditation on the
Edwardian class system and a portrait of feudalism in
pre-revolutionary Russia. Alice Fry is an independent and liberated
young woman, who begins a liaison with Edward Cobb, a budding
politician of Conservative stripe. Their affection is real and
shared, and both pursue its course toward a marriage that both sets
of parents would like to prevent. Alice's father is a small-time
publisher of political arcana and controversial subjects, and when it
becomes clear that the marriage could be a political liability, her
lover extricates himself from the engagement, without learning that
Alice is pregnant. She too flees, agreeing to become a governess in
Russia to the children of Baron Rettenberg at his estate, Soligorsk,
outside St. Petersburg.</LD>
<TE>   At Soligorsk, she makes a new life, gradually being accepted by
Tatyana Andreiovna, the baron's wife, and Olga Pavlovna, Rettenberg's
mother and matriarch of the family. She makes friends with the small
but colorful family circle and even with one of the baron's discarded
lovers, the former governess, Vera.</TE>
<TE>   The baron bides his time before setting his romantic sights on
Alice, who gives birth to a son and begins to raise him as part of
the Rettenbergs' extended family. When the baron makes his move, she
accepts his advances in word but not in deed. Family troubles,
deaths, the coming of the Great War, then the eventual, inexorable
revolution, with its horrors and deprivations, keep this love from
being consummated.</TE>
<TE>   When the family, Alice included, is forced to abandon the estate
because of the revolution, Alice takes charge -- years of
administering to the Rettenbergs have given her all the skills she
needs -- and the shrinking group moves from place to place. Their
life of wandering is hard, especially after so many years of comfort
and plenty, but they continue to hope for an end to their roaming.</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, far from Alice, Cobb has made a disastrous
marriage to a proper wife, divorced, gone to war in Belgium and
Germany, performed acts of heroism and been awarded glory and medals.</TE>
<TE>   Now, he has reenlisted in service because of a gnawing unhappiness
somehow related to his long-ago jilting of Alice. A disgruntled but
honored military officer, he wanders Europe and the Far East, having
discovered some of Alice's story. With this and the knowledge that he
has a son, Cobb aggressively looks for them. The Rettenbergs, after
many years of troubles and a burgeoning, melancholy toll of friends
and family -- including the baron's wife -- are now four surviving
refugees: the baron, Alice, his daughter and her son. They arrive at
their last stepping-off place from old Russia, the port of
Novorossisk, where they hope to get out. The final pages of this tale
-- beautifully and vividly told, grippingly paced -- are full of
surprises, all credible if coincidental.</TE>
<TE>   Read tells his story cogently but without shortcuts. He describes
people, feelings, the wonders of nature and the intricacies of family
life astutely, with nuance and sensibility. He is a joy to read, and
one comes to the end of his tale with both fulfillment and sadness.</TE>

<HD>ABC's Miller up for job as Bratton's spokesman</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Dana Calvo</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>John Miller, the ABC correspondent who landed an interview in 1998
with a little-known Afghanistan-based terrorist named Osama bin
Laden, has informed the network he is in talks to become the chief
spokesman for Los Angeles Police Department's new chief, William J.
Bratton.</LD>
<LD>   The men worked together in the mid-'90s when Miller was deputy
police commissioner of the NYPD public affairs office during
Bratton's tenure as chief. Miller was a trusted ally of Bratton's
during the chief's well-publicized feuds with New York's mayor at the
time, Rudolph Giuliani.</LD>
<LD>   ABC executives on Tuesday said Miller, 44, told them several weeks
ago of his discussions with the LAPD, which are said to be in their
final stages. If he becomes the LAPD spokesman, Miller would be
walking into another high-visibility media position, this time in the
nation's second-largest city, which now is struggling with a rising
homicide rate.</LD>
<TE>   Miller's high-profile professional standing would make him a
departure from other LAPD spokesmen, who traditionally have been
identified by their association with the department and the chief.</TE>
<TE>   Miller, who could not be reached for comment Tuesday, joined ABC
News in October 1997, covering legal news stories. In January, he was
named co-anchor of "20/20" along with Barbara Walters. But the show's
ratings have slipped by about 8% from last season, with an average
viewing audience of 8.9 million people, according to Nielsen Media
Research.</TE>
<TE>   "We know that Bratton and Miller have a long-standing relationship
and that they talk regularly," said LAPD Cmdr. Gary Brennan. He
declined to confirm any personnel decisions by Bratton, who was out
of town and unreachable for comment.</TE>

<LD>So the baby enters the world the way we'd all like to be-- naked and
skinny as a goal post--at 8:59 on a hazy Thursday morning. Profound
is probably too weak a word.</LD>
<LD>   Right away, two women wipe him down with gauze, as if to assure
him he's come to a good place.</LD>
<LD>   "He's a clean baby," a nurse says.</LD>
<TE>   "We stress that," I say.</TE>
<TE>   There's a little slime behind his ears, but otherwise he is indeed
a clean baby, born with a clear conscience and the kind of wide-open
arteries that usually come only from virtuous living and a bland
diet.</TE>
<TE>   That'll all change quickly enough. Soon, the stain of the world
will be upon him.</TE>
<TE>   "We want him to cry," the nurse says.</TE>
<TE>   "Show him my Visa bill," I say.</TE>
<TE>   "When he cries, it gets the oxygen deep in the lungs," she
explains.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll tell him about the Cubs," I say.</TE>
<TE>   The day began early--too early, even for two parents used to
chronic sleep deprivation. We rose before the bread trucks, just as
the newspaper thwacked the driveway.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm already tired," I say on the way to the hospital.</TE>
<TE>   "Look at that star," my wife says, pointing to the east.
Seriously, the east.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's a planet," I say.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's a star," she says.</TE>
<TE>   It doesn't occur to me till later the significance of two people
off to have a baby, spotting a bright star in the east. Talk about
historical baggage.</TE>
<TE>   But what better time for a little religion, a couple in their
mid-40s having yet another child, with a house already full of kids
and pets and bills, sitting on the desk like a pile of leaves.</TE>
<TE>   "Your Verizon account is past due," a voice on the phone had said
the day before.</TE>
<TE>   "We've been busy," I explained.</TE>
<TE>   On the way to the hospital, the car brakes squeak. Notice how your
brakes always seem to fail around the holidays? December: good for
babies, bad for brakes.</TE>
<TE>   "If you park on the street, you won't have to pay," my wife says,
as if reading my mind.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll drop you off first," I say.</TE>
<TE>   In a few minutes, we are inside the hospital preparing to have
another child. The other three are home, dreaming their Christmas
dreams, fantasizing about all the stuff we can't afford. Snowboards.
Concert tickets. College.</TE>
<TE>   And here we are, having yet another one, following some strange
predawn beacon to this little hospital on the hill. Does God know
what he's doing? Let's hope someone does.</TE>
<TE>   "Have you taken Lamaze class?" the nurse asks, going down her
checklist.</TE>
<TE>   "Sure," I say. "About 20 years ago."</TE>
<TE>   Dad is a walk-on</TE>
<TE>   Despite the best intentions, a dad is merely a walk-on at these
events. In a maternity ward, the fathers all blend into the
background. To the doctors, the dads are invisible. To the nurses, a
source of amusement.</TE>
<TE>   "I remember one time, I had the surgical mask on upside down," I
say. "The nurses thought it was hilarious."</TE>
<TE>   "One time, we had a dad put his surgical boots over his arms," a
nurse says.</TE>
<TE>   What a riot we dads are. Just don't let us near the babies.</TE>
<TE>   "Want to cut the cord?" a nurse is suddenly asking, bringing us
back to the moment.</TE>
<TE>   "Sure, " I say, then snip the umbilical cord with a pair of
scissors.</TE>
<TE>   "He OK?" my wife asks.</TE>
<TE>   "Nearly perfect," I say.</TE>
<TE>   A few minutes later, the baby and I wait in the room for his
mother to return from delivery. He's wrapped like a burrito. His eyes
try to find focus. He's probably hoping to see a Rockefeller.
Instead, he sees me.</TE>
<TE>   "Your mom will be here soon," I assure him. We wait. We look at
the door. We wait some more. The phone rings.</TE>
<TE>   "What's he weigh?" a friend asks.</TE>
<TE>   "Thirty-four pounds, 11 ounces," I say. "That's pretty big," he
says.</TE>
<TE>   "I've had bigger," I say.</TE>
<TE>   I hang up the phone and tell the baby about the mom he's about to
meet. The longer we wait, the more excited he gets.</TE>
<TE>   "Wait'll you see her," I whisper. "She'll take your breath away."</TE>
<TE>   He lifts his chin. He rolls his eyes. He yelps a little, then
hiccups.</TE>
<TE>   "The first time I saw your mother, wow," I tell him. With that,
the baby cries. Another kid, another open mouth, another blessing.</TE>
<TE>   Wow.</TE>

<HD>Dickens a go-go: A Cratchit Christmas</HD>
<DH>The seasonal classic turns into a wild '60s romp in the
hands of Troubadour Theatre.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Lynne Heffley</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The message of repentance and redemption in Charles Dickens' seasonal
classic, "A Christmas Carol," manages to survive -- just -- in "A
Christmas Carol King," Troubadour Theatre Company's deliciously mad
1960s rock 'n' roll clown-show treatment at the Falcon Theatre.</LD>
<LD>   What could be more heart-tugging than the Cratchits, crooning
Carole King's "So Far Away" to Tiny Tim's hilariously pathetic little
crutch sitting all alone in a teensy spotlight while Scrooge (Michael
Sulprizio), trussed up in a harness, dangles overhead in his long
johns?</LD>
<LD>   What hitherto unsuspected depths of feeling are revealed when Mrs.
Cratchit (Lisa Valenzuela) strips down to her camisole and belts out,
"You make me feel like a natural woman" to husband Bob (Travis
Clark)?</LD>
<TE>   The towering Ghost of Christmas to Come (Rob Crites, amazing on
stilts) makes a lasting impression too, his entrance heralded by a
pounding ensemble rendition of "I Feel the Earth" (choreographed by
Ameenah Kaplan). And then there's the Ghost of Christmas Past who
turns out to be.... Well, let's just say that the screams of audience
laughter that greet that inspired visual joke (the role is shared by
Beth Kennedy and a surprise guest), are rivaled only by those
engendered by Tiny Tim himself -- a wee soft puppet body topped by
the head of actor Tim Groff.</TE>
<TE>   Ringmaster and major perpetrator of this song-dance-and-circus
mayhem is Matt Walker, who brings his considerable comic chops to the
roles of Scrooge's nephew Fred and a Vegas-y, chain-swinging Marley's
Ghost. Directing the talented ensemble in a deliberate mode of barely
restrained clown anarchy, Walker leaves room for hilarious, seemingly
unintentional blown lines, a critique of one actor's disappearing
English accent and other mishaps.</TE>
<TE>   Less inspired moments in this otherwise rollicking romp are
"ad-libs" about Enron, interest rates and local eateries and stores.
These last, aimed at those familiar with Toluca Lake and Burbank
haunts, have an obligatory in-joke feel.</TE>
<TE>   Lighting designer Jeremy Pivnick accomplishes the multitude of
blackouts, spotlights and shadows with panache; kudos, too, to the
dynamite, considerably put-upon onstage band led by bassist Andre
Holmes, with Win Meyerson, Henry Phillips, Eric Heinly and choral
pianist David Barker.</TE>

<HD>Revenge: A family affair</HD>
<DH>If the desire to avenge his father is behind Bush's policy
on Iraq, it's a motive as old as history and just as treacherous.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Reed Johnson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the eyes of assorted peaceniks and mass-media oracles, George
Bush's desire to confront Saddam Hussein isn't primarily about secret
weapons, an Al Qaeda connection or the grinding imperatives of Middle
East realpolitik. It's about Daddy.</LD>
<LD>   A Boston Globe columnist recently pondered in print whether the
president was "driven by primitive desires of revenge" related to
unfinished family business from the Persian Gulf War. Political
commentator Kevin Phillips raised a similar question about "a Bush
family vendetta" in an op-ed piece in The Times. And Bill Minutaglio,
a biographer of George W. Bush, told the Philadelphia Inquirer that
although he doesn't think the president is "sitting in the Oval
Office" plotting a war to avenge his father -- "that would be too
much like Michael Corleone" -- he does think that President Bush
"really views things through the prism of his family and his father."</LD>
<TE>   Saddam is said to speak frequently of "Bush the Son" being driven
to avenge "Bush the Father's" failure to take him out once and for
all in 1991. For the notoriously vindictive Iraqi dictator, the
political is usually personal. After all, he tried to assassinate the
elder Bush two years later. The Bushes have repaid the sentiment:
George H.W. frankly admitted this fall that "I have nothing but
hatred in my heart" for Saddam. And at a September gathering in
Houston, George W. said, "There's no doubt he can't stand us. After
all, this is the guy that tried to attack my dad."</TE>
<TE>   In countries where America is considered the Great Satan,
allegations of a Bush-Saddam blood feud ring louder still. "You
definitely see it in the media, and it's often said in a sort of
snickering way that 'oh yeah, Saddam insulted his father," says
Khaled Abou El Fadl, a UCLA professor and expert on Islamic law. "And
the more pessimistic types, they even say that 'see? No matter how
much people pretend to be civilized, in their essence they remain
barbaric.' I remember a couple articles I read in Kuwaiti papers and
Egyptian papers that made this point."</TE>
<TE>   Of course, unless you've got a good friend working in the West
Wing, speculation about whether the president is motivated by revenge
is mere psychobabble. But the obsessive quest to settle an old family
score isn't necessarily a crude, Cro-Magnon impulse unworthy of a
civilized people, some argue. In fact, the desire to avenge a family
grudge may be central to affirming our identities, our place within
our families, society and the cosmos at large. Call it
score-settling, tit for tat, even-steven, quid pro quo, holy war, or
by its high-minded alias, Justice. In its most primal and visceral
form, some say, it's all revenge, however we may rationalize, codify,
justify, Nuremberg-ize or otherwise spin it.</TE>
<TE>   And from the Hatfields and McCoys to the Capulets and Montagues,
revenge is "all about family," says Laura Blumenfeld, a Washington
Post reporter whose memoir "Revenge: A Story of Hope" (Simon &amp;
Schuster, 2002) chronicles her attempt to exact nonviolent revenge on
a Palestinian man who shot and wounded her rabbi father a decade
earlier.</TE>
<TE>   "Revenge developed to preserve the integrity of the family,
because out in the isolation of the desert or in the jungle or in the
grasslands, no one could defend himself alone," Blumenfeld says. "And
so revenge ensured survival. It was Darwinian. It's the ultimate
instrument of collective identity in terms of giving everybody in the
group an identity. But it also helps preserve the group."</TE>
<TE>   In aboriginal Siberia, Blumenfeld says, revenge is so embedded in
the concept of kinship that the word for kindred families means "a
collection of those who take part in blood revenge." In Albania, she
writes, "revenge is not a choice but a sacred duty" tied to family
loyalty.</TE>
<TE>   Evolutionary psychologists maintain that revenge is an essential
human passion, hard-wired into our DNA. But William Maurer, an
associate anthropology professor at UC Irvine, insists that revenge
is more of a social construct than a genetic mandate. "People want to
believe that we're still in the Serengeti," Maurer says. "At the same
time, people want to believe that we're better than that."</TE>
<TE>   Maurer thinks that modern Western society has trouble channeling
its vengeful impulses. The 18th century Enlightenment and the ideals
enshrined in the American and French revolutions were supposed to put
an end to things like tribal vendettas and rule by petty, inbred
monarchies. The revolutionaries were going to replace the paradigm of
the clan and the tribal-instigated bloody payback with the idea of
objective rule by law and the universal brotherhood of man. Liberte!
Egalite! Fraternite!</TE>
<TE>   Alas, what America got in the short term was another 100 years of
slavery followed by one of the bloodiest wars in history, while the
young French republic put thousands to death on the guillotine.</TE>
<TE>   "I think that we're like 'Forbidden Planet,' " Maurer says,
referring to the 1956 sci-fi film classic based on Shakespeare's "The
Tempest," in which a highly evolved society is undone by its failure
to harness its monstrous Id. "We want to think that we're not a
vengeful people, but at the same time we're fascinated with that base
of vengeance inside. And I think the reason is the Enlightenment
doesn't give us anything to do with that."</TE>
<TE>   In Western culture, the link between revenge, family and
self-knowledge is the backbone of such masterpieces as Homer's
"Iliad" and "Odyssey," Sophocles' Oedipus cycle, the plays of
Aeschylus and Euripides, and Shakespeare's great tragedies. It also
propels epic melodramas like "The Count of Monte Cristo," prestige
hoodlum flicks like "The Godfather" trilogy and Martin Scorsese's
upcoming "Gangs of New York," and practically every Italian opera.</TE>
<TE>   "Who's there?" goes the opening line in "Hamlet," a query that
reverberates through the play about a gloomy Danish prince seeking to
avenge his father's poisoning by his stepfather. Only at the end of
five long acts, mortally wounded and with most of the court slain at
his feet, does Hamlet lay to rest his father's ghost and fulfill his
destiny.</TE>
<TE>   Which isn't to say that Shakespeare was urging his audiences to
try this stuff at home. What "Hamlet" and other Bard works do suggest
is that, for better and frequently worse, the sense of responsibility
that human beings feel to repay a harm inflicted on a loved one is
not easily shirked. The Furies must be placated. The ancestral gods
must have their pound of flesh.</TE>
<TE>   But Shakespeare was careful to distinguish among different types
of revenge, says Harry Keyishian, an English professor at Fairleigh
Dickinson University in New Jersey and author of "The Shapes of
Revenge: Victimization, Vengeance, and Vindictiveness in Shakespeare"
(Humanity Books, 1995). Hamlet's revenge against his stepfather, the
new king Claudius, is a morally justified, unwanted duty that must be
carried out to correct a Danish state gone rotten. That's a far cry
from, say, Iago's malicious, self-serving revenge against Othello,
Keyishian says.</TE>
<TE>   The question, perhaps, then becomes whether to follow Hamlet's
example and settle the matter with a bare bodkin -- that's "blunt
weapon" to you -- or search for a less sanguineous alternative. For
Blumenfeld, physical violence was never a real option. The attacker,
after all, hadn't killed her father, only injured him. But she wanted
the assailant and his family to know, as she confides to a friend in
her book, "that you can't [mess] with the Blumenfelds." In taking
action, she believed, she "wasn't only avenging my father but
reasserting our unity."</TE>
<TE>   Ultimately Blumenfeld settled on an unusual form of retribution,
halfway between Mohandas Gandhi and Genghis Khan. Using her
reporter's credentials but disguising her true identity at first, she
sought out and eventually made contact with the assailant, Omar
Khatib, who belonged to the Abu Musa gang, a violent PLO faction.
Then she ambushed him in dramatic but peaceful fashion. At Khatib's
parole hearing in 1999, Blumenfeld revealed her identity and asked
that the prisoner, who had asthma, be granted parole on medical
grounds. Her reward, she says, was his acknowledgment of the pain he
had caused her father and family, his recognition of her father's
humanity.</TE>
<TE>   Just as there can be more than one motive for taking revenge,
Blumenfeld says, there are lots of ways to get even. She's proud that
most Americans responded to the Sept. 11 attacks not simply by baying
for Taliban blood, but also by baking cookies for firefighters and
attending benefit concerts. This, she thinks, was a very American,
"constructive" form of revenge.</TE>
<TE>   "It's about success and pushing toward the future," she says, "and
building yourself up rather than tearing your enemy down: Living well
is the best revenge. As opposed to other places in the world where
revenge is sort of slugging it out, back and forth, sinking into the
mud of history and the past, America's about the future."</TE>
<TE>   It remains to be seen if a second U.S.-Iraq war would play more
like a lofty Greek classic or a mud-wrestling match between extended
families of nations. Funny thing about revenge: Once the fists start
flying, you may discover your enemy has more kinfolk than you
thought.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Can you name one of the oldest art forms in the world? Here are some
clues. It is spoken, not written. It can be used to explain life,
tell something about nature or describe an important historical
event. It stimulates the imagination and lets listeners create
pictures in their minds. So what is it?</LD>
<LD>   Storytelling, of course! And in many cultures, music is an
important part of the storytelling process. In fact, some stories are
only told through song. They are called ballads. By signaling
tension, sounding funny or providing general atmosphere, music and
rhythm can help bring tales to life. But with or without music, the
key to any good story is that it has some kind of conflict that is
resolved, or settled, in the end.</LD>
<LD>   Before writing was developed, the only way to "save" a story was
to memorize it, then retell it to someone else. In that manner, tales
have been passed from one generation to the next. Amazingly, many
stories have survived for centuries and are still told today. That
shows the power of the spoken word!</LD>
<TE>   You can hear the ancient tale "Why the Sun and the Moon Live in
the Sky" and many other stories at Saturday's Musical Circus for
children in Pasadena. Noted storyteller Leslie Perry and the Three
Peace Ensemble, a musical trio, will spin tales with words and music
at the Pasadena Civic Auditorium starting at 8:30 a.m. Reservations
are not required. For more information call (626) 793-7172 or visit

<HD>Art comes first in a worthy expansion.</HD>

<DL>FORT WORTH</DL>
<LD>When the Los Angeles County Museum of Art announced last year that it
would tear down most of its Wilshire Boulevard complex to erect a
powerful new edifice by architect Rem Koolhaas -- at a cost upward of
$400 million -- it did not go unnoticed that LACMA was unlikely ever
to consider raising that kind of money to buy art. The San Francisco
Museum of Modern Art, the Guggenheim Bilbao, London's Tate Modern,
the Milwaukee Art Museum -- it's customary these days for expensive
new art museum buildings to be constructed with great fanfare, while
the bothersome question of what might be shown inside is left for
later.</LD>
<LD>   Now, the Modern Art Museum of Fort Worth has revived a different
model -- and a very welcome revival it is. Art is in the driver's
seat of its terrific expansion project, which opens to the public
Saturday, while museum architecture has been recognized as a
critically important art with specific social functions. The elegant
new building, designed by Japanese master Tadao Ando, has been
carefully devised for one paramount purpose: creating opportunities
for intimate encounters with individual works of art.</LD>
<TE>   In the nearly seven years that the Fort Worth expansion has been
underway, with director Marla Price at the helm, the museum's
collection of painting, sculpture and other postwar art has also been
transformed. It has gone from trifling to impressive. Sources report
that between $40 million and $60 million was spent on additions to
the collection -- a figure that approaches the $65 million cost of
the new building. Art worth intimately encountering is now everywhere
to be seen.</TE>
<TE>   One-third of the 153,000-square-foot building is devoted to
gallery space, mostly in a sequence of three two-story pavilions. A
shallow reflecting pool extends from one side of the ground floor,
while a grassy sculpture garden extends from the second floor on the
other side. As you move through the spaces, encounters with art
alternate with tranquil views through enormous windows.</TE>
<TE>   Although the architectural style is different, the scheme recalls
the J. Paul Getty Museum in Los Angeles, with its two-story
pavilions, intimate rooms and restful outdoor breathing spaces
between them. Forget fatigue. Despite the Fort Worth building's size,
refreshment mark this museum experience.</TE>
<TE>   Larger galleries are found in the building's center, but no single
gallery is huge. Some even consist of bays that hold a single work of
art -- a magnificent recent painting by Susan Rothenberg, for
example, all rustling brushwork and nervous energy, or an exquisite
photographic diptych of the tangled, asymmetrical rhythms of a
Chinese forest by Thomas Struth. On the floor in one glass-enclosed
space surrounded by water, Carl Andre's elemental path of steel
plates split by a narrow line of copper snaps your body to attention,
much the way magnetic north grabs a compass needle.</TE>
<TE>   Given such intensely focused encounters, weak work fairly withers.
In the same kind of space that Andre electrifies, a slight bronze
sculpture by Cy Twombly just wilts.</TE>
<TE>   The museum now has five times the exhibition space it had in its
former home around the corner -- a pleasant Bauhaus-style building by
German expatriate Herbert Bayer. This being Texas, museum spokesmen
like to brag that the new museum is second only to New York's Museum
of Modern Art in gallery space for postwar art. The comparative list
of other museums' gallery space that they've provided conveniently
forgets L.A.'s Museum of Contemporary Art, whose Geffen building
alone provides almost the space of Fort Worth's new home. (MOCA has
69,000 square feet of galleries, Fort Worth has 53,000.) Never mind.
So much else is right that you can forgive the boast.</TE>
<TE>   Bucking another grim museum trend, text does not run amok on
gallery walls. Instead, this installation respects the primacy of
sensual experience as integral to the power of art.</TE>
<TE>   Some careful juxtapositions, such as a raging, red-orange 1989
Rothenberg between first-rate paintings from the 1970s by Philip
Guston, are eloquent testimonials to artistic influence and thorny
independence. Elsewhere, a mesmerizing conversation ensues among Vija
Celmins' atmospheric painting of stars in the night sky, a circle of
stone shards on the floor by sculptor Richard Long and a magnificent
1969 seascape painting by Gerhard Richter, in which a breaking wave
is strangely illuminated by light filtering through a rupture in the
clouds above. These realist meditations on luminous air, earth and
water dissolve -- like Ando's building -- into evocative
abstractions.</TE>
<TE>   The inaugural exhibition focuses almost exclusively on the
permanent collection, celebrating every museum's primary function.
Several important long-term loans, especially in the area of Abstract
Expressionism, are also included, highlighted by Arshile Gorky's
masterpiece of organic abstraction, "The Plow and the Song."</TE>
<TE>   The installation is loosely chronological. The first floor starts
with American art of the 1950s, then moves through Pop, Minimal and
Post-Minimal art -- the last three being collection strengths. Work
from the 1980s to the present is mostly installed upstairs.</TE>
<TE>   Of 154 objects, fully one-third are new acquisitions. Chief
curator Michael Auping has chosen well, although to my taste the
collection is rather too closely attuned to the Manhattan
establishment -- New York artists, followed by Germans. Call it
Chelsea-centric. The emergence in the last 20 years of critical mass
in art produced in Los Angeles and London is barely acknowledged,
while neighboring Mexico and the Southern Hemisphere are omitted.</TE>
<TE>   Texas artists turn up here and there, including such provocative
emerging artists as Julie Bozzi (a tiny landscape painting that
evokes huge, spooky spaces) and Eric Swenson (a sculpture of an
imaginary breed of dog, impossibly balanced on point as a flaming red
and black cape flies up behind him). Happily, space has also been
found for regional work from the 1940s and 1950s by the Fort Worth
Circle -- Bill Bomar, Cynthia Brants, Dickson Reeder and others --
since the museum was chartered as an art association in 1892, long
before its current focus was established.</TE>
<TE>   The Fort Worth Circle was typical of small groups of progressive
artists who salved their sense of isolation in America's grim
provinces by banding together. The Modern Art Museum of Fort Worth
has come a very long way since then. But it's important to keep that
historical memory alive, especially as some sense of anxiety still
lingers: Concentrating on recent New York taste with an occasional
Texas twang betrays a subtle ache for acceptance in established
corridors of power.</TE>
<TE>   It also makes the collection feel more conservative than it
actually is. And speaking of anxiety: Almost half the inaugural show
is tellingly composed of work that is gray, brooding or dusky -- from
the monumental lead sculpture and clay-encrusted painting by Anselm
Kiefer to the mound of poured acrylic foam by Lynda Benglis; from the
brute typological photographs of water towers by Bernd and Hilla
Becher to the acidic self-portrait death mask by Andy Warhol that
greets you at the top of the grand staircase.</TE>
<TE>   Ashen tones are encountered in room after room, suggesting a past
half-century of gritty experience. Coupled with the gray concrete
walls, dark granite floors and silvery aluminum panels on the
exterior of Ando's long, low building, the collection offers a museum
of bleak beauty -- austere, refined yet tough as nails.</TE>

<DH>Bill Claxton's 'Photographic Memory' is a book that gathers
up his life in pictures.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bettijane Levine</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Bill Claxton's still shooting. At 75, and fully recovered from a
recent stroke, the photographer is standing in his glass-walled house
cantilevered high atop a Beverly Hills canyon. He's fielding calls
from Milan, Italy, where his Steve McQueen photo exhibit is a smash
hit -- and from Nylon magazine, for which he'll do a fashion shoot in
Santa Monica this week. Not to mention the interviewer in his living
room, who wants to know how this marathon man maintains his currency
in a world that so casually tosses out the old in favor of things
new.</LD>
<LD>   Claxton's answer is easy. He's always worked at what he loves to
do, rather than what pays the most or offers the most ego
gratification. As it happens, what he loves to do -- photography --
has provided enough of both commodities.</LD>
<LD>   His new book "Photographic Memory" (Powerhouse Books) is ample
proof. Aptly titled, it really is Claxton's memory book, filled with
faces and places that have, in various ways, been important in his
life. They are the kind of images that cause people to stare intently
at a particular page and ask each other: "Could that possibly be who
I think it is ... ?"</LD>
<TE>   The young Steve McQueen, Robert Mitchum, Andy Warhol, Bobby Short,
Chet Baker, Rudolf Nureyev and about 150 other icons of pop and
classical culture were his subjects starting in the late 1940s
through the present. It is a fascinating trip through time and space,
partly because Claxton's camera illuminates the intensity, the
naivete, the sunny wholesome optimism of many young people whom the
world would later know as talented, and sometimes troubled,
performers.</TE>
<TE>   The book features some Claxton buddies who didn't live long enough
to fulfill their promise, along with those who were among the hip,
the hot and the happening. It's an oddly eclectic group, but somehow
the shots of Isaac Hayes, Benicio Del Toro and Spike Lee seem
perfectly in sync bound between covers along with Terry Southern,
Ursula Andress, Shelley Winters and Fred Astaire.</TE>
<TE>   And then there is the photo of Claxton's good friend, Tom Pittman,
a twentysomething actor who'd been pegged by movie moguls for a
meteoric career. The year was 1957 and Pittman loved a young fashion
model named Peggy Moffitt, who didn't love him back. She'd fallen,
instead, for the tall, handsome photographer, Claxton.</TE>
<TE>   Pittman, deeply hurt, glared at his two good friends, angrily told
them to go ahead and marry each other for all he cared, and then
missed a curve as he roared down the winding canyon road in his
Porsche, hurtling to his death. Claxton tells this story to a guest
while his wife, the same Peggy Moffitt, takes a nap upstairs. They
have been married for 42 years. "This book is about people who've
been important to me -- and Pittman was one of them, so I included
him," he says.</TE>
<TE>   Claxton's somewhat of an icon himself.</TE>
<TE>   To jazz aficionados and historians, he's the one, the only
photographic chronicler of the history of West Coast jazz -- and one
of three giants of jazz photography worldwide. The other two, William
Gottlieb and Herman Leonard, are each associated with a different
place and time, as well as a different style. Their photos of the
early great musicians are as dark as the smoky clubs in which they
played. Claxton was born in Glendale. He loved the beach, the sun and
good jazz, and many of his musician photographs are aglow with
natural Southern California light. Starting in the late '40s he
obsessively photographed all the people who made the great sounds he
heard at the clubs he started sneaking into at age 14 -- Charlie
Parker, Chet Baker, Billie Holiday, Gerry Mulligan, Miles Davis, The
Duke, Count Basie, Sarah Vaughan.</TE>
<TE>   He started a record label, Pacific Jazz, in the early '50s. Soon
after, he and Moffitt wed at Winthrop Rockefeller's house in New
York, with a then-baby-faced Bobby Short singing and playing for
their guests (the photographer and the pianist first met at a seedy
piano bar in Glendale when Short was just starting out).</TE>
<TE>   Claxton then branched out. He got assignments to shoot film stars,
directors, writers, classical and pop composers and musicians from
magazines and record companies of the day. And because Claxton was so
elegant, intelligent and easy to take, the photographer found that
many of those he was assigned to photograph were becoming his
friends.</TE>
<TE>   He has published seven books of photos, and exhibits of his work
are shown worldwide. Claxton's new book may be a recollection of
those who've affected his life in the last 50 years, but it's also
another look at some who've affected American culture as well.</TE>

<KH>ON TV / BRIAN LOWRY</KH>
<HD>There are some surprise factors in the 'Friends' equation</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BRIAN LOWRY</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Today's adventure in Advanced TV Economics explores how the key
players in deciding whether "Friends" returns for another year aren't
just Jennifer Aniston or David Schwimmer but ... some guys you've
never heard of at the Tribune Co.?</LD>
<LD>   Those who skipped the introductory class needn't worry, because
this course perplexes even TV industry officials. At its core,
however, is a simple (if confounding) dilemma -- namely, how
television can afford to produce shows for which there is a public
demand but no clear financial model to support them.</LD>
<LD>   Such is the case with "Friends" -- in its ninth season, still TV's
most-watched comedy. Yet because rerun rights play such a vital role
in underwriting the franchise, Tribune -- also owner of the Los
Angeles Times -- could handcuff NBC, producer Warner Bros. Television
and the show's handsomely paid stars in any attempt to extend the
series.</LD>
<TE>   This odd scenario, by the way, also clouds the future of other
popular programs, with "Friends" merely representing one prominent
example of how forces beyond ratings dictate what endures on the
networks.</TE>
<TE>   Because the studios that make the shows primarily glean their
profits from after-network rerun airings, known in the industry as
the "back end," several programs that have loyal followings might not
endure beyond this year. CBS' Ted Danson sitcom "Becker" faces such a
predicament because of the marginal appetite among TV stations for
its reruns, and "JAG" -- a military drama ostensibly flying high,
averaging more than 15 million viewers -- is also in peril.</TE>
<TE>   Nothing makes the point, however, more starkly than "Friends."
Under a deal reached in February, NBC pays Warner Bros. nearly $7
million an episode for the show through spring. NBC doesn't make much
off the show at that price, but the program's ancillary benefits,
such as helping promote other series, remain considerable.</TE>
<TE>   Warner Bros. then pays each of the six stars $1 million per show
and probably spends a few million more to pay the writers and
producers, as well as to actually make the show, putting the cost
above $7 million. The studio nevertheless makes a tidy profit because
on top of NBC's fee, the repeats have been sold to TV stations for a
sum totaling about $4 million per episode.</TE>
<TE>   Much of that cash comes from Tribune, one of the country's largest
broadcast operators, which carries "Friends" reruns in more than half
of the two dozen cities where it owns TV stations -- among them New
York, Los Angeles and Chicago, which jointly account for 15% of U.S.
homes.</TE>
<TE>   Tribune's agreement runs until 2011, but the company has committed
to acquire only new episodes produced through this season. And with
more than 200 installments already in the can -- far more than the
usual total required for syndication -- the company is said to have
little interest in anteing up for more.</TE>
<TE>   A Tribune spokesman declined to comment on the company's plans,
citing a desire to stay out of any "Friends" negotiations involving
NBC, Warner Bros. and the performers.</TE>
<TE>   Nice try, but it's impossible to divorce the show's back end from
the question of whether this will be the end, even before determining
if the cast can be brought on board.</TE>
<TE>   Simply put, should Tribune's contribution disappear, the "Friends"
follies become considerably thornier. Fearing the toll its absence
would exact on "Must-See TV," NBC wants the show but doesn't relish
the idea of covering the lost syndication income, which could add $3
million to its per-episode investment.</TE>
<TE>   Warner Bros., meanwhile, has little incentive to continue the
series without being assured a profit, which it won't be, barring a
huge increase from NBC or the stars (who might be unwilling to return
under the best of circumstances) accepting a salary cut.</TE>
<TE>   In short, companies that control large groups of TV stations --
particularly Tribune and Fox, which air sitcom repeats on stations
like KTLA and KTTV, respectively, before and after prime time -- can
make or break even hit shows. "Those companies wield tremendous power
in the television business," said an executive at a competing studio.
"They're the gatekeepers."</TE>
<TE>   "JAG," moreover, is in the same leaky boat. Although its reruns do
well enough on the USA network, that channel isn't obligated to buy
additional episodes, leaving CBS and sister Viacom unit Paramount
wrestling with how to foot the bill for another year, despite the
show's popularity.</TE>
<TE>   NBC and Warner Bros. have yet to initiate serious talks about
"Friends" and are promoting this season as its finale, but they
haven't closed the door entirely. Still, any hope of seeing new
episodes in 2004 hinges at least in part on Tribune wanting more
fresh installments to run, and rerun, into the next decade.</TE>
<TE>   Admittedly, you can make a case that the show has exhausted every
conceivable variation on putting Ross and Rachel together and pulling
them apart and that hanging on would be about commerce, not
creativity. From sitcoms to athletes, there is a certain nobility, to
be sure, in leaving near the top of one's game.</TE>
<TE>   That said, when millions of people dutifully show up every week,
as they do for "Friends," programmers rightfully swallow hard at the
prospect of cutting them loose. From that perspective, the TV
industry does itself and its customers a disservice if arcane
bean-counting considerations alone extinguish the brightest lights --
in essence, yanking a product off the shelves that the public still
demonstrably wants.</TE>
<TE>   Not that I blame Tribune for wanting to judiciously allocate its
resources. In fact, if the company must choose between buying
episodes of "Friends" and sharing extra cash with its hard-working
employees, I, for one, think the world can muddle through watching
"Scrubs."</TE>

<HD>The stars align against the war</HD>
<DH>They use power of celebrity pulpit to protest costs, risks
of a U.S. strike against Iraq -- and encourage less famous to speak
out.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Hilary E. MacGregor</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Surrounded by a phalanx of TV cameras -- which is exactly what they
wanted -- nearly two dozen stars from your favorite TV shows
transformed a trendy bar for weekend hipsters into a makeshift
headquarters for anti-war declarations.</LD>
<LD>   Calling themselves Artists United to Win Without War, they
gathered Tuesday morning at Les Deux Cafes in Hollywood to read a
statement protesting the costs and risks of going to war with Iraq.
They said they were using their faces, their images and their
celebrity to get the message out.</LD>
<LD>   The reporters adjusted their microphones and cameras and craned
forward.</LD>
<TE>   The actors, including Mimi Kennedy, Robert David Hall, Tony
Shalhoub, Martin Sheen and Wendie Malick, said they offered no
solutions, just a chance to speak out against the drumbeat for war.</TE>
<TE>   They said they hoped that by speaking out publicly they would
encourage those with less media access -- ordinary citizens, those in
organized labor, education, religious groups -- to exercise their
free speech rights. Even if there are no TV cameras to capture the
moment.</TE>
<TE>   Actor-activist and co-organizer Mike Farrell read the
five-paragraph statement:</TE>
<TE>   "We are patriotic Americans who share the belief that Saddam
Hussein cannot be allowed to possess weapons of mass destruction. We
support rigorous U.N. weapons inspections to assure Iraq's effective
disarmament.</TE>
<TE>   "However, a preemptive military invasion of Iraq will harm
American national interests....It will make us less, not more
secure."</TE>
<TE>   More than 100 industry players and celebrities -- ranging from
Gillian Anderson and David Duchovny to Laurence Fishburne and Michael
Stipe -- have signed the statement, which urges the disarming of Iraq
through "legal diplomatic means."</TE>
<TE>   Several actors read short, individual statements Tuesday, which
ranged from a defense of democracy to a plea to give peace -- and the
U.N. weapons inspectors -- a chance. Shalhoub, displaying none of the
neurotic tendencies of "Monk," the obsessive-compulsive detective he
plays on TV, said the idea that one country has the right to launch a
preemptive strike against another is not consistent with democracy.</TE>
<TE>   Ed Begley Jr. encouraged Americans to drive energy-efficient
vehicles, like he does, to reduce dependence on foreign oil. Kennedy
said she was there to exercise her free speech rights. "Violence is
not the solution for our national security," she said.</TE>
<TE>   They didn't claim to be military specialists or policy wonks. But
they brought along retired Rear Adm. Eugene J. Carroll Jr., U.S.N., a
noncelebrity signatory to the statement, to add some heft.</TE>
<TE>   "No one is going to quit their day job to come up with the perfect
solution," producer-director and co-organizer Robert Greenwald
repeated several times.</TE>
<TE>   "We are not experts. Whatever access celebrity provides, we are
going to use that to get the word out. So people will know they are
not alone."</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, when the floor was opened to questions, the
reporters grilled the stars with the intensity of the White House
press corps.</TE>
<TE>   "Mr. President," began one reporter, as she addressed Sheen, star
of "The West Wing."</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not the president," Sheen quipped. "I'm just the acting
president."</TE>
<TE>   Still, it was as if some reporters expected the stars to play out
their roles as CIA officials and law enforcement officers in real
life.</TE>
<TE>   An aggressive reporter from KNBC reminded Farrell that he hadn't
supported the Persian Gulf War either. Would Farrell say that wasn't
a success?</TE>
<TE>   A writer from the Hollywood Reporter asked Sheen that if he saw
Iraqis dancing in the street after a U.S. invasion, liberated from
the dictator Saddam Hussein, would he admit he was wrong?</TE>
<TE>   As the session wound down, the KNBC reporter asked if there were
any Republicans among them. Farrell had said it was a diverse group,
with diverse political opinions, but the reporter said it looked like
the same old group of Hollywood liberals.</TE>
<TE>   The press conference was over. The stars turned away, the
cameramen climbed off their ladders and broke down their equipment.</TE>
<TE>   The KNBC reporter kept yelling, insisting on an answer -- asking,
pleading, daring any Republicans in the group to raise their hands.
No hands went up. "They're here," Farrell said. "They just don't want
to out themselves."</TE>

<HD>This 'Wizard of Oz' transports the audience</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>David C. Nichols</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Unerring audience regard accompanies Civic Light Opera of South Bay
Cities' "The Wizard of Oz," initiating the beautifully renovated
Redondo Beach Performing Arts Center with a ha-ha-ha, a ho-ho-ho and
more than a couple of tra-la-las. This impressively executed revival
of the Royal Shakespeare Company adaptation of the 1939 MGM film is
sure-fire family entertainment.</LD>
<LD>   The show was a gold-plated hit in 1987 at the Barbican Theatre and
again in its 1988 U.S. premiere engagement starring Cathy Rigby at
Long Beach Civic Light Opera. RSC producer John Kane's scenario
follows Noel Langley, Florence Ryerson and Edgar Allan Woolf's
screenplay (from L. Frank Baum's original novel) almost to the
letter.</LD>
<LD>   Stuck in a sepia-toned Kansas of epic flatness, schoolgirl Dorothy
Gale (Juliana Ashley Hansen) yearns for a place "where there isn't
any trouble." With a boost from a cyclone, she, her dog, Toto
(Snickers, a canine virtuoso), and the Gale family farmhouse travel
over the rainbow to the Land of Oz.</LD>
<TE>   Flattening one wicked witch upon landing, Dorothy must dodge her
accidental victim's vengeful sibling (Carol Swarbrick) while seeking
out the title character (S. Marc Jordan) for help in returning to
Kansas. Aiding her are the Scarecrow (John Bisom), Tin Man (Chad
Borden) and Cowardly Lion (Bob Amaral).</TE>
<TE>   Under director-choreographer Jamie Rocco's solid guidance, this
may be the slickest production this company has yet mounted. The
designs of Michael Anania (sets), Raun Yankovich (lighting), Gregg
Barnes and Shon LeBlanc (costumes), Deanne Johnson (hair and wigs)
and Bryan Wiersma (makeup) follow the film's template without being
slavish.</TE>
<TE>   Special effects -- flying by ZFX, pyrotechnics by John Bordeaux --
are a textbook demonstration of old-school theatricality done with
digital-age finesse, as is John Feinstein's sound plot (greatly aided
by the venue's vastly improved new acoustics). Musical director
Steven Smith pulls Broadway-worthy sounds out of his players, doing
full justice to Larry Wilcox's smooth orchestrations of Herbert
Stothart's background score and Harold Arlen and E.Y. Harburg's
songs. These include the show-stopping "The Jitterbug" and the
emotional eleventh-hour reprise of "Over the Rainbow," both cut from
the movie.</TE>
<TE>   Hansen's Dorothy wisely avoids imitating Judy Garland while
maintaining comparable earnest wonder and a water-clear voice of
infinite charm. Bisom's affable Scarecrow is suitably rubber-limbed;
Borden's acerbic Tin Man is agreeably brittle; and if Amaral's
leonine crybaby overdoes the anachronistic shtick, he carries the
audience in his paw throughout.</TE>
<TE>   Jordan's sorcerer is expert, as are Doug Carfrae's Uncle Henry and
Cynthia Ferrer's double-duty Auntie Em and Glinda.</TE>
<TE>   Swarbrick's wacky Witch is another audience favorite, although
here as elsewhere the excessive emphasis on broad comedy undercuts
the dramatic tension and blunts the stakes. This scarcely prohibits
enjoyment, though, and certainly the young at heart to whom the show
is dedicated may find it difficult to avoid singing along.</TE>

<HD>Intimacy, on a grand scale</HD>
<DH>Texas museum makes room for the soul.</DH>

<AU>Nicolai Ouroussoff</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>FORT WORTH</DL>
<LD>What role does art play in contemporary society? That's the question
posed by the new Modern Art Museum of Fort Worth, a building that
resolves some of the most vexing challenges in museum design with
remarkable subtlety and elegance.</LD>
<LD>   Designed by Japanese architect Tadao Ando and scheduled to open
Saturday, the $65-million building will replace the warren of cramped
rooms that have housed the museum's collections since the 1970s. With
53,000 square feet of gallery space, the new building is five times
the size of its predecessor. Its monumental scale evokes a place of
monastic contemplation, a fortress for the soul.</LD>
<LD>   That quality has long been a feature of Ando's architecture. The
61-year-old architect rose to international prominence in the late
1980s, with buildings whose formal purity and crafted concrete
surfaces often have a haunting stillness -- as if a great absence at
their center were waiting to be filled. In the best of these, such as
his 1988 Church on the Water in Hokkaido, Japan, such natural
elements as light, water and wind become part of the composition,
giving them an added, almost primitive, spiritual dimension.</LD>
<TE>   Yet the strength of the Fort Worth design lies in Ando's ability
to imbue these spaces with an unexpected emotional range. Beneath a
veil of stoicism, Ando has created an intricately layered world. In
effect, his building is a carefully calibrated machine that
sensitizes us to an increasingly intimate sequence of experiences.
Its message is that art's spiritual value can resonate far beyond the
walls of a museum.</TE>
<TE>   The building stands at the edge of the city's arts district, a
somewhat formal arrangement of lawns and cultural buildings that
includes the Amon Carter Museum and the Kimbell Art Museum, designed
by Louis Kahn and completed in 1972.</TE>
<TE>   As with Kahn's masterpiece, Ando's museum has a deceptive
simplicity when seen from the street. The exterior functions like a
mask. Its blank, two-story facade, marked by a few narrow slot
windows, is dignified and unpretentious. Flanked by parking on two
sides, it makes no effort to compete with its surroundings.</TE>
<TE>   But once inside, the building has a sudden grandeur. The lobby's
muscular forms frame a towering window at the back of the space. From
here, visitors can gaze out across a long, rectangular reflecting
pool. The main galleries are divided into three distinct pavilions
that extend from the lobby along one side of the pool. Encased in
glass, the pavilions protrude delicately out over the water, like a
string of floating lanterns. The large, elliptical form of the cafe
anchors the lobby's other side.</TE>
<TE>   The lobby acts as a sort of filter, cleansing the mind of unwanted
distractions. The bookstore is tucked to one side, hidden behind a
wall. The entrance to the galleries is set off-axis, in a corner,
which encourages the visitor to pause before venturing deeper into
the building. The idea is to draw you into a more meditative world.</TE>
<TE>   That transition occurs with exquisite precision. Just beyond the
lobby, a broad concrete stair leads up to the pavilions' second-floor
galleries. The lobby wall frames the stair on one side; a small oval
gallery frames the other, its form slicing through several of the
lower steps. To get to the first-floor galleries, visitors follow the
curved wall of the oval. Only as they reach the other side does the
form open up to reveal a single work -- Anselm Kiefer's "Book With
Wings" (1992-94), its leaded, feathery silhouette seeming to sag with
exhaustion. Otherwise, visitors climb the stairs and are greeted at
the top by a 1986 Andy Warhol self-portrait -- an electric-green face
with hair standing on end.</TE>
<TE>   Either way, the effect is the same. It is as if the collision of
forms had broken the building open, revealing the secrets hidden at
its core. The vitality with which the art and architecture play off
each other gives each an added intensity.</TE>
<TE>   But it is in the design of the main gallery spaces that Ando's
mystical view of architecture becomes most apparent. Essentially, the
gallery pavilions are conceived as two independent structures, one
inserted inside the other. The bulk of the museum's collection is
housed in the three, interconnected pavilion boxes. A second, glass
skin encases these forms, framing the main circulation corridors.</TE>
<TE>   The double-layered system allows Ando to create a tranquil
environment for viewing art. But it also suggests a more nuanced
architectural experience. Inside, the concrete pavilions have a
tough, vault-like quality. The weight of the walls seems to lock
viewers in place, almost forcing them into an intimate relationship
with the art.</TE>
<TE>   By comparison, the corridors represent a more ephemeral world. On
one side, the massive concrete walls anchor the building to the site.
On the other, the towering windows offer a view over the reflecting
pool toward Fort Worth's gray, suburban landscape.</TE>
<TE>   Just beyond the glass, three slender, Y-shaped columns rise out of
the water, supporting wafer-thin concrete canopies above. Water laps
up against the base of the windows, and the impression is that the
building is dissolving.</TE>
<TE>   The corridors provide a moment of escape, a vision of nature that
is meant to soothe the mind. Yet the memory of the art also remains.
And in this way, the design sets up a rhythm between different states
of perception, from the visceral impact of confronting an artwork
dead on to a more contemplative play of mental images. It is a
remarkable achievement, and it induces the viewer to experience the
art with a heightened self-awareness.</TE>
<TE>   Ando's strategy recalls another museum: Richard Meier's Getty
Center. As with Ando, Meier chose to create a grand entry lobby and
then break the Getty's galleries into distinct pavilions. The idea,
as Meier once put it, was to give the viewer some relief from the
exhaustion that can come from wandering through an endless file of
gallery rooms.</TE>
<TE>   But the Getty's museum is smothered in a myriad of other public
functions. Its pavilions are scattered around a bustling public
courtyard. And the museum is only part of a much larger complex,
including a research institute, administration buildings, cafes and
an elaborate garden. The effect is almost frenetic, and the art is
pushed to the margins.</TE>
<TE>   The reasons one building succeeds and the other fails run deeper
than issues of architectural composition. They lie in more
fundamental assumptions that each institution makes about art's
evolving cultural role. The Getty Center embodies the belief that
art's value stems from the activities we pile up around it; it
assumes that art, on its own, cannot sustain our attention. In a
sense, the design patronizes its audience.</TE>
<TE>   Ando's creation, by comparison, is more self-confident. It assumes
that art remains a vital part of our existence. As an architect, his
aim is to allow us to understand that relationship more clearly, to
bring us into closer contact with both the art and ourselves. It is
architecture for art's sake, without condescension.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A leaded-glass lamp designed by Frank Lloyd Wright has been sold for
just under $2 million, a record for a Wright piece at auction,
Christie's auction house said.</LD>
<LD>   The lamp, created around 1903 for the Susan Lawrence Dana House in
Springfield, Ill., was acquired Tuesday by a telephone bidder who
wished to remain anonymous.</LD>
<LD>   The double-pedestal lamp, designed in shades of green, yellow and
amber, was one of a pair of lamps that stood in the library of the
house, which was also designed by Wright.</LD>
<TE>   The previous world auction record for a work by Wright was
$704,000 for a lamp sold by Christie's in 1988. The prices include
the auction house's commission.</TE>

<LD>The Vines are building on their reputation for volatility.</LD>
<LD>   The Australian band, known for the hit "Get Free" and raucous
stage antics, was bounced Monday from a high-profile performance spot
on "The Tonight Show with Jay Leno" after lead singer Craig Nichols
began trashing the group's equipment during a sound check in the
hours before the show's taping.</LD>
<LD>   According to a source in the band's camp, the tantrum by Nichols
sent NBC staffers ducking for cover, left the set littered with
debris and led to the band's being quickly ousted from the network
studios in Burbank.</LD>
<TE>   Leno mentioned in his monologue that the appearance had been
canceled because of the band's rowdy behavior.</TE>

<LD>About 4,000 people in entertainment industry circles are receiving a
holiday surprise from National Lampoon in their mailboxes this week.
"The Hollywood Retorter" looks, at first glance, like a copy of the
Hollywood Reporter but on closer inspection turns out be a 16-page
parody of the trade paper with some biting jokes aimed at celebrities
and show business executives.</LD>
<LD>   The cover stories include a report about a new CNN reality series
called "The Kennedys" that features "hard-drinking" Sen. Edward
Kennedy and his family in a forum inspired by "The Osbournes."</LD>
<LD>   Another story is about Mike Ovitz launching Artist's Valet and
Parking Group, "which the onetime Hollywood super-agent promised
would reinvent how parking was conducted in this town."</LD>
<TE>   Doug Bennett, executive vice president of the Westwood-based
National Lampoon, says the mailing signals a rejuvenation of the
brand name.</TE>
<TE>   "National Lampoon is back in action. We have a lot of plans for
the brand and this is the start of things," Bennett said Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   National Lampoon, known for the ribald magazine of the same name
and for its affiliation with films such as "Animal House" and the
"Vacation" franchise, put a new management team in place in May and
will be making a push in 2003 into book publishing, radio, television
and film, Bennett said. There also are plans for content tailored to
a television network on college campuses, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Howard Burns, editor of the Hollywood Reporter, said some of the
stories in the parody display "questionable taste" that will offend
some sensibilities, but that overall it was a sensation in his
newsroom. "We found it hysterical," Burns said. "And that they chose
to imitate us is most flattering."</TE>

<LD>The uncertain saga of the Guns N' Roses tour took another twist
Tuesday as six upcoming shows were canceled, including stops in San
Jose, Sacramento and tonight's scheduled performance in Greenville,
S.C.</LD>
<LD>   A spokesman for Clear Channel, the promoter for the tour, said
there was no new information about other dates and pointed out that
tickets remain on sale for two Southern California stops, Jan. 3 at
the Forum in Inglewood and Dec. 27 at the San Diego Sports Arena.</LD>
<LD>   Still, there is reason to doubt that Axl Rose and company will
appear on stage tonight or any time soon. The band has missed three
shows in the last five days, including a last-minute cancellation in
Philadelphia on Friday that inspired unruly fans to throw seats and
bottles on stage. MTV has reported that the tour is off, and Cky, an
opening act on the tour, posted a message on its Web site saying the
same thing.</LD>
<TE>   On Tuesday, the entire tour itinerary was pulled from the Web site
of Pollstar, the concert industry trade publication.</TE>
<TE>   "We took it down because, personally, I think the whole tour is
history," said Gary Bongiovanni, editor in chief of Pollstar. "I
think the lawyers are taking care of the details now and soon they
will announce it."</TE>

<HD>A union of cowboys and Indians</HD>
<DH>After an on-again, off-again courtship, the collection-rich
Southwest Museum will merge with the Autry.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Christopher Reynolds</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Autry Museum of Western Heritage -- a young, wealthy institution
created by a singing movie cowboy to explore western myth-making
along with history -- will consummate a two-year on-again, off-again
courtship by merging with the cash-strapped, collection-rich
Southwest Museum.</LD>
<LD>   The merger rescues Los Angeles' oldest museum from a
life-threatening financial crisis and brings the Southwest's
350,000-item inventory, one of the world's leading collections of
Native American art and artifacts, under the same umbrella as the
Autry's $100-million endowment.</LD>
<LD>   The move, Autry Director John Gray said, gives the museums a
chance to present "a dynamic dialogue between the cultures that made
up the American West. There's no other museum that really does that."</LD>
<TE>   Autry and Southwest officials said their pact, outlined in a
signed memorandum of understanding, came together through votes on
Nov. 21 by the Autry's trustees and directors and on Friday by the
Southwest trustees.</TE>
<TE>   Although museum officials said they hope to raise a new building
to accommodate many Southwest programs adjoining the Autry's
courtyard in Griffith Park, the museums plan to retain separate
identities. However, their research functions are to be combined in
an Institute for the Study of the American West, and together the
three entities will be known as the Autry National Center of the
American West.</TE>
<TE>   The institute's first mission: To spend six months deciding how to
use each of the museum sites, and to chart a course for how to most
effectively unite the institutions.</TE>
<TE>   To start the merger rolling, Gray said, three of the Southwest's
24 trustees will join six to nine of the Autry museum's directors to
form a new board of directors to steer the umbrella organization.
Most other top supporters of the two museums -- including the
Southwest's 21 remaining trustees and the more than 80 members of the
Autry Board of Trustees -- will be united on a second board, a level
below the board of directors.</TE>
<TE>   Gray will serve as top executive of the parent organization, and
Duane King, executive director of the Southwest Museum, will remain
in his position.</TE>
<TE>   Autry officials estimate the overall cost of the merger at $100
million, and they aim to cover its cost with new joint fund-raising
in coming years.</TE>
<TE>   King said the organization's new stability "should make it easier
to attract support, including support from Native American
communities." The new enterprise, he said, "becomes greater than the
sum of the parts."</TE>
<TE>   In the short term, Autry officials said, the Autry is likely to
spend from $500,000 to $1 million to sustain the Southwest's
operations in 2003.</TE>
<TE>   Although museum officials are making no guarantees about the
historic but bedraggled Southwest building on Mt. Washington, Gray
said, "the goal is to have it operate in a public way," while
acknowledging that renovating the aging structure might cost $10
million.</TE>
<TE>   For any expansion in Griffith Park, the Autry will need city
approval. In recent years, the Los Feliz Improvement Assn., an
organization of residents near the park, has been wary of projects
that could bring substantial new traffic to the area.</TE>
<TE>   Those and many other details of the museums' union will be worked
out in a "due diligence and planning process" that will include
solicitations of public input over coming months, Gray said.</TE>
<TE>   Under current plans, the two museums will continue to have
separate curators and docents, managing their own collections and
exhibitions. They would be free to lend items to each other -- which
the two have already been doing for years, officials noted.</TE>
<TE>   The Southwest Museum, founded in 1907, has for the last decade
suffered through a series of leadership crises. In 1993, former
Director Patrick Houlihan was convicted of removing about 20 valuable
baskets, tapestries and paintings from the museum's renowned Native
American collection and secretly selling or trading them.</TE>
<TE>   The Southwest's current need for financial help was made clear by
a report commissioned a year ago. The confidential report, a draft of
which was obtained by The Times, was undertaken by Daniel Belin, an
attorney and nonprofit management consultant. It found that the
museum's trustees were contributing too little money, paying too
little attention to finances and consequently squandering their
credibility among other potential donors.</TE>
<TE>   The report also sounded out alliance possibilities with
representatives of several other cultural organizations -- including
the Autry, the casino-rich Pechanga Indian tribe in Riverside County,
the Heard Museum in Phoenix and the Smithsonian Institution's
National Museum of the American Indian in Washington.Except for the
Autry and the Pechangas, most expressed doubts about the cost and
logistics of preserving the collection, its current site and the
institution's independence.</TE>
<TE>   The Southwest board "had become more a collector's club than a
museum board," said a source familiar with the museum's internal
operations who requested anonymity. In the last two years, more than
a dozen board members have left the Southwest Museum.</TE>
<TE>   The Southwest Museum's King acknowledged that his board's
fund-raising had lagged in recent years, but he said giving
accelerated dramatically in late 2001 when, faced with financial
calamity, board members gave or raised $1.1 million as part of a
campaign to meet a $250,000 matching grant from the Ahmanson
Foundation.</TE>
<TE>   The Southwest's partner in this marriage comes from vastly
different roots. From its beginnings 14 years ago, the Autry has been
viewed by many museum insiders as an institution with more money than
gravitas, its 51,000-item collection running from 19th century maps
to memorabilia from Autry's show-business career, its leaders drawn
from outside traditional museum management ranks. Gray, who took over
as director in 1999, spent most of the last 20 years an executive for
First Interstate Bank.</TE>
<TE>   But in recent years, the museum has added staff and mounted
increasingly ambitious exhibits in its 45,000 square feet of gallery
space. Programming this year has included an exhibition on Jews in
the Old West and presentations on the history of the African American
cowboy.</TE>
<TE>   Outsiders saw the merger on one level as an eleventh-hour rescue
operation but also as an exciting marriage of resources.</TE>
<TE>   Jack Shakely, who has watched the evolution of both museums over
more than a decade in his role as president of the California
Community Foundation, hailed the merger's "wonderful" possibilities.</TE>
<TE>   Had it not come through, he added, "a lot of us were worried that
the temptation to sell artifacts might become irresistible" to the
Southwest's leaders.</TE>
<TE>   In late 2001 and early 2002, it seemed likely that the museum
would form a different kind of partnership, with the Pechangas. The
deal would have given the Pechangas a chance to display items from
the Southwest collection in a new cultural center to be built in
coming years; in exchange, the Pechangas were to pay the museum
$750,000 to $1.3 million yearly. But when the proposal went to the
reservation's general membership, voters balked.</TE>
<TE>   Pechanga spokesman Butch Murphy said that members wanted more
information and expressed "concern over the amount of money being
talked about." Southwest officials declined to say what other
institutions apart from the Southwest had expressed interest.</TE>
<TE>   Michael Heumann, chairman of the Southwest Board of Trustees, said
in a prepared statement that the move was backed with "strong, strong
consensus" after "a thorough exploration" of options.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Two for one</TE>
<TE>   The Southwest and the Autry will merge under an umbrella financial
organization; research functions will merge but the two will be
siblings rather than one entity. A new Southwest building is planned
near the Autry in Griffith Park; possible uses of the historic
Southwest building on Mt. Washington will be studied.</TE>

<LD>"What's this about the outside world?" Papa asked. I hadn't seen him
walk into the kitchen while I was talking to Mama.</LD>
<LD>   "Sarah wants to watch television!" Mama exclaimed.</LD>
<LD>   "Where did you get that idea?" Papa demanded.</LD>
<TE>   "Chelsea Hewlitt," I said. "You told me to be friendly to the new
people, so I was talking to her and ... "</TE>
<TE>   "Don't twist my words, young lady." Papa did not look happy. "You
know there's a difference between being neighborly and going against
our ways. Now, enough of this foolish talk. Sit down and eat supper.
Then we must go to bed so we can get an early start tomorrow morning.
It's a long drive to Keim's farm."</TE>
<TE>   For the first time in my life, I ignored Papa's orders and kept on
talking.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not going against Amish ways or giving them up," I said. "I
just want to find out what TV is all about. Amos Yoder gets to work
in a store and live in Columbus for a year. And Hettie Schrock is a
waitress in a restaurant instead of teaching in the Amish school the
way I must ... "</TE>
<TE>   "Amos Yoder is a boy, and he and Hettie are teenagers. You are a
girl who is only 10 years old." Papa's voice told me I had to stop
... now.</TE>
<TE>   We ate dinner quietly, but my mind was racing. I had to find a way
to see TV.</TE>
<TE>   The next day, Saturday, all the Amish families in the area were
going to Keim's farm for the day. We'd have a covered dish dinner,
play games, sing hymns and visit with friends. I'd been looking
forward to having time away from chores. Now, though, TV was more
important.</TE>
<TE>   Then I remembered all Chelsea's questions, and it gave me an idea
that might work.</TE>

<HD>Dora gives kids early 'Present'</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>Mark Sachs</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If you've ever seen your preschooler jumping around in front of the
TV, calling out numbers and shapes and phrases in English and a
little Spanish, "Dora the Explorer" is obviously a regular guest in
your home.</LD>
<LD>   The animated tyke and her pet monkey, Boots, have been a fixture
on Nickelodeon for just over two years, taking young viewers on
scores of problem-solving adventures.</LD>
<LD>   But Dora is not content to merely provide passive entertainment.
She's fond of stopping the action cold, turning to the kids at home
and asking for help with the task at hand. It might be a counting
riddle, a call to recap the steps needed to get from Point A to Point
B or just a nudge for kids to pitch in on a song or dance. And the
fact that Dora is a bilingual member of a Latino household adds a
neat little spin on learning activities that are rather skillfully
disguised as gentle fun.</LD>
<TE>   The show, created by Chris Gifford, Valerie Walsh and Eric Weiner,
airs in back-to-back episodes from 11 a.m. to noon weekdays on Nick
Jr., but tonight at 8, little Dora and her friends get their shot at
the big time with a half-hour Christmas special, "A Present for
Santa."</TE>
<TE>   Although all the episodes are primarily in English, Dora always
tosses in a handful of Spanish words and phrases that can't help but
build bilingual skills in young viewers.</TE>
<TE>   Even Santa drops a little Spanish on his visitors tonight and
rewards them for playing along by delivering a swinging version of
"Feliz Navidad," sung by guest voice Howie Dorough of the Backstreet
Boys.</TE>
<TE>   With an avalanche of Christmas programming aimed at folks who no
longer have feet in their pajamas, it's nice to know that the small
fry can still count on Dora.</TE>

<HD>'Sopranos' ends its season with punch</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The major networks' onslaught of holiday specials officially began
last week, but it was a somewhat less festive show on pay cable --
"The Sopranos" -- that relatively packed the biggest punch, based on
viewing estimates issued Tuesday by Nielsen Media Research.</LD>
<LD>   HBO channels totaled 12.5 million viewers during Sunday's extended
season finale, about a million below the record the pay service set
when the show began its fourth season in September. That was still
good enough to win the time period -- an impressive feat, given that
HBO is received by only about a third of U.S. homes -- although it's
fair to note that NBC's "Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent" was a rerun.</LD>
<LD>   With such specials as "Christmas in Rockefeller Center" and "It's
a Wonderful Life" augmenting series regulars, NBC won its second week
this season in overall viewing and enjoyed its widest victory margin
among the young adults that advertisers seek.</LD>
<TE>   ABC delivered the biggest newsmagazine audience in more than a
year -- since then-congressman Gary Condit spoke with Connie Chung --
with Diane Sawyer's Whitney Houston interview, which ran against a
rerun of "The West Wing."</TE>
<TE>   Buoyed by the Steven Spielberg miniseries "Taken," the Sci-Fi
Channel for the first time ranked as the week's most-watched basic
cable network, averaging 3.3 million viewers. MTV's "The Osbournes,"
meanwhile, dropped 35% below its second-season premiere, to 4.2
million viewers on Dec. 3.</TE>

<LD>NEW YORK -- Of all the high-profile attempts to open Broadway's
sleepy eyes to far-flung artistry, nothing this season compares to
the daring, the intimate theatricality and revelatory humanity of
Fiona Shaw in "Medea."</LD>
<LD>   Forget all assumed familiarity with Euripides' tragedy or the
impulse to dismiss infanticide as, well, perhaps a holiday downer.
Deborah Warner's modern-day vision and Shaw's performance are
unforgettable, the sort of experience that makes one regret the
overuse of the word on so much of the barely remembered.</LD>
<LD>   This is the same 90-minute update of the 2,400-year-old stunner
that sold out a short visit at the Brooklyn Academy of Music's Harvey
Theater in October. The Abbey Theatre production, already celebrated
on the West End, has been transferred in all its ghastly glory to the
Brooks Atkinson Theatre for two brief months.</LD>
<TE>   We lose the Brooklyn venue's sunken amphitheater view of the
family swimming pool in the proscenium theater. In all other ways,
however, the passion is still magnificent and awful. This is
definitely not your mother's "Medea." As Shaw leaves the luxury and
lost sanctity of the modern glass house her Medea shared with Jason
and their two beautiful little boys, we cannot imagine how this
production will shatter collected pieties about unfathomable
cruelties and the sorceress' revenge.</TE>
<TE>   This is a devastating portrait of a marriage -- actually, a
celebrity marriage -- and the contradictory impulses that betrayal
can wrench from a desperate, adoring wife. In the conversational but
never jarring translation by Kenneth McLeish and Frederic Raphael,
the story is as psychologically complex and horrifically familiar as
the news. Nothing feels pushed or shoved into relevance. Yet, when we
see one of the children try to make a run from his mother's bloody
knife, there is no escaping the memories of dead babies bathed in the
waters of defiled American domesticity.</TE>
<TE>   Tom Pye's unsettling set keeps us captive in the courtyard outside
the glass doors of an unfinished dream house. Characters dash down
the aisles from King Kreon's castle and descend into what we imagine
to be a rec room beneath the children's swimming pool.</TE>
<TE>   There is a Greek chorus of ordinary women, hangers-on to the
stars, with international accents to match their workaday jobs and
everyday modern clothes. Jacqueline Durran's costumes are inseparable
from character, especially the summer-print housedress that the
barelegged Shaw uses to make Medea seem dowdy and sensual at the same
time.</TE>
<TE>   Shaw, with her long, hard bones and Cubist face, is a Medea with
the smarts to feel appalled by her obsession with Jason -- played
with pumped-up boyish confidence by Jonathan Cake. For all her
jealousy, her fury at his duplicity and her self-loathing for caring
so much, she cannot stop her body from melting into his whenever he
touches her. There is an intelligent, wronged woman's sense of
absurdity here, an almost playful incredulity about being the foreign
wife traded for a younger royal trophy.</TE>
<TE>   We may not believe, in our more rational corners of the psyche,
that she has no choice but to slaughter the lives they made together.
But this Medea, whose interaction with the children's toys is almost
as moving as her relationship with the boys, makes us see it her way.
As she stays to stare at Jason, splashing him as a child teases for
attention, the beauty of the horror is almost unbearable.</TE>

<KH>COUNTER INTELLIGENCE: THAILAND</KH>
<HD>Where satay is just the beginning</HD>
<DH>At Sunshine Thai, the ever-changing menu is varied and
authentic. There's always something new to try.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Barbara Hansen</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>SUNSHINE Thai is as bright and cheerful as it sounds. The dining room
is lined with windows and decked out like a garden. White balustrades
call to mind a veranda and there's a large outdoorsy mural, in front
of which stand two charming Thai girls greeting customers. Sorry,
fellows, they're made of wood.</LD>
<LD>   Sunshine is also one of the best Thai restaurants around, because
it caters to a mostly Thai clientele. Many customers drop by after a
visit to Wat Thai, North Hollywood's Buddhist temple and Thai
cultural center.</LD>
<LD>   One day, all the specials were vegetarian because it was a
Buddhist fast day. You could have vegetarian pad Thai, red curry, or
pa-lo, a mild Chinese-style stew flavored with five-spice.</LD>
<TE>   The specials are written in Thai, but someone will translate, and
often they are the most interesting dishes. Pa-lo, for example, is
often made with duck, but this time it was wrinkly rolled bean curd
sheets, fried tofu, imitation meat made from gluten and shiitake
mushrooms in the slightly sweet brown sauce. The variety of textures
more than made up for the absence of duck.</TE>
<TE>   Another special, on a non-fasting day, was the extreme of
meatiness: four styles of pork on steamed rice. They were Thai-style
Chinese sausage; crisp fried pork; pork hock braised with sweet soy
sauce, cinnamon and star anise; and barbecued pork in a red sauce
made with fermented soybeans, fish sauce and sugar.</TE>
<TE>   A pretty noodle dish called mie gati swirled pink rice noodles in
a sweet coconut curry sauce along with fresh tofu so tender it
crumbled. Khanom jin nam prik pao, another version of noodles in
sweet coconut curry, switched to wheat noodles, and the sauce
included chopped peanuts, shredded carrot, hard-boiled egg and a hint
of hot chile.</TE>
<TE>   Tod mun pla, the finely ground fish cakes that come with a sweet
cucumber relish, inspired another special -- the same sort of cakes
made with ground pork. That same day, Sunshine also produced a fried
fish maw salad. Fish maw may sound repulsive, but fried crisp, the
puffed, porous tubes are as inoffensive as any crunchy snack. In this
salad, they were combined with shrimp, squid, chicken, mango, nappa
cabbage, cashews and a spicy sweet and sour sauce.</TE>
<TE>   You won't find these dishes every day, but that's the pleasure of
going to Sunshine -- there's always something different to try. The
regular menu contains a few dishes of special interest along with the
usual Thai standards. There's a fresh spring roll: a jumbo bundle of
roast pork, Chinese sausage, egg, tofu, bean sprouts and cucumber in
a soft wrapper topped with shrimp, cilantro and a delicate brown
sauce. What might seem odd is the packet of American mustard lying on
a pile of shredded cabbage. The Thai custom is to have a bite of the
roll with a dab of mustard, then a bite of green onion. It's an
amazing, complex blend of flavors.</TE>
<TE>   The dish called shallow sea presents shrimp, squid and crisp fried
fish in a dark sauce fired with fresh and dried chiles and aromatic
with lemon grass, galangal, kaffir lime leaves and basil. Dynamite
rice, although very popular, is less interesting. The plain steamed
rice stands beside a pool of mild, comparatively dull, thickened
brown sauce mixed with chicken, shrimp, Chinese sausage, shiitake and
vegetables.</TE>
<TE>   Golden fish with mango salad is close kin to fish sticks. Large
chunks of very tender, moist fish are coated with thick batter,
dipped in panko bread crumbs and deep-fried. There are slivered
mangoes and cashews in the sweet sauce on the side.</TE>
<TE>   Green curry with chicken is so redolent of Thailand that you'll
think you're there. The only non-Thai inclusion is red bell pepper,
which joins Chinese and Thai eggplant, bamboo shoots, chiles, basil
and kaffir lime leaves in the light, fragrant sauce.</TE>
<TE>   The satay is charming -- there's no better word for it. The sticks
of chicken or pork arrive on a large platter with a little brazier on
which to reheat them. In one bowl there's sweet-sour cucumber relish,
in the other a spicy, sweet peanut sauce that's so good you'll want
to wipe up every drop. There are toast points on the plate for that
very purpose.</TE>
<TE>   Sunshine makes its own Thai tea and coffee, rather than using
commercial mixes, and it has wonderful desserts, though they're not
on the menu. One day, the kitchen sent out a bowl of sweet, salty,
warm coconut milk with little balls made of tapioca flour floating in
it, along with lotus seeds, taro chunks, palm seeds and sliced
coconut. Bananas in hot coconut milk came another day.</TE>
<TE>   For the vegetarian fast, the kitchen produced three desserts, but
all were gone by midday -- a sad blow for those of us who would
happily give up meat, but not sweets.</TE>

<HD>Like a breeze from Provence</HD>

<LD>AT Bastide in West Hollywood, chef Alain Giraud pays tribute to
Provence with a menu and a restaurant thoroughly in the spirit of his
native region. He conjures up the fragrant lavender fields of
Provence in his signature dessert, a vacherin glace. It looks like a
fabulous albino porcupine: a mound of the seductively perfumed
lavender ice cream heaped with softly whipped cream and embellished
with fragile teardrop-shaped meringues and little spears of ruby
strawberries.</LD>
<LD>   As if that's not enough, he lays on a crimson lake of raspberry
coulis. To make the heady ice cream, Giraud steeps dried buds of
imported lavender and vanilla bean in heavy cream. Alternate bites of
this incredibly smooth ice cream with the tender powdery meringues
and the bright slashes of berry. Altogether dreamy.</LD>
<LD>   (To get the same intense lavender flavor, it's important to use
edible lavender -- the kind you buy at specialty food shops, not
florists -- and preferably from Provence, where the climate gives it
a particularly deep flavor. When making the meringues, why haul out
the mixer to whip up a few egg whites? It's incredibly easy to
accomplish with a balloon whisk. Just make sure the bowl is
absolutely clean and dry.)</LD>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Vacherin glace with lavender ice cream</TE>
<TE>   Total time: 3 hours</TE>
<TE>   Servings: 8</TE>
<TE>   Note: Dried lavender is found at specialty stores and farmers
markets.</TE>
<TE>   Ice cream</TE>
<TE>   1 1/2 cups milk</TE>
<TE>   1/2 cup heavy whipping cream</TE>
<TE>   1/2 vanilla bean, split lengthwise, seeds scraped out</TE>
<TE>   3/4 cup granulated sugar, divided</TE>
<TE>   1 1/2 teaspoons dried lavender</TE>
<TE>   4 egg yolks</TE>
<TE>   1. Bring the milk, cream, vanilla and half of the sugar to boil in
a saucepan over medium heat. Add the lavender, turn off the heat and
infuse for 1 minute.</TE>
<TE>   2. In a separate bowl, combine the yolks and remaining sugar.
Prepare a bowl of ice water; set an empty bowl on top of the ice
water and place a strainer on top of the empty bowl.</TE>
<TE>   3. Whisk about one-fourth of the milk-cream mixture into the yolk
mixture, being careful not to cook or scramble the eggs. Bring the
milk-cream mixture back to a boil and stir in the tempered yolk
mixture. Cook, mixing continuously with a wooden spoon, until the
mixture coats the back of the spoon, about 3 minutes. Strain the
mixture into the empty bowl and chill about 1 hour, stirring
occasionally.</TE>
<TE>   4. Freeze in an ice cream maker according to the manufacturer's
directions. (Makes about 2 1/2 cups.)</TE>
<TE>   Meringue drops</TE>
<TE>   3/4 cup granulated sugar</TE>
<TE>   2 egg whites</TE>
<TE>   1. Heat the oven to 200 degrees. Line a baking sheet with
parchment paper; set aside.</TE>
<TE>   2. Combine the sugar and egg whites in the top of a double boiler
set over, but not touching, simmering water and whisk until the
mixture is warm to the touch, about 5 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   3. Place the mixture in an electric mixer and beat on high speed
until stiff, but not dry, peaks form, 5 to 6 minutes. Place the
mixture in a pastry bag fitted with a medium-size round tip. Pipe
1-inch teardrops onto the baking sheet; you should have about 50.</TE>
<TE>   4. Bake the meringues until hard but without color, about 3 hours.
Let cool, then store the drops in an airtight container.</TE>
<TE>   Assembly</TE>
<TE>   1 cup heavy whipping cream</TE>
<TE>   2 tablespoons powdered sugar</TE>
<TE>   2 1/2 cups raspberries</TE>
<TE>   1/4 cup granulated sugar</TE>
<TE>   1 tablespoon lemon juice</TE>
<TE>   4 strawberries, quartered, for garnish</TE>
<TE>   Lavender sprigs, for garnish</TE>
<TE>   1. Beat the cream and powdered sugar together until medium-stiff
peaks form. Place in a pastry bag with a star tip.</TE>
<TE>   2. Blend the raspberries, granulated sugar and lemon juice on high
speed until smooth. Strain. Taste and add more sugar or lemon juice,
if needed.</TE>
<TE>   3. Place a scoop of lavender ice cream on each of 8 plates. Pipe
the whipping cream entirely over each scoop to form a dome. Place the
strawberries on top, alternating the strawberries with the meringue
drops. Make a rim of raspberry coulis around the dome. Garnish with
lavender sprigs. Serve immediately.</TE>

<LD>GIVEN what I do for a living, I'm constantly besieged to name three
or 10 or every last one of my favorite restaurants. Before you get
that pencil, let me say the answer depends on what I feel like eating
at that moment. Whether I have a hankering for huckleberry shortcake,
a bowl of earthy pasta e fagioli or whole fish steamed with ginger
and garlic, to name just a few of the cravings that lure me back to
this or that address.</LD>
<LD>   A new restaurant, whether it's a high-profile boite two years in
the making or a little dive with terrific Oaxacan food, brings out
the thrill of the chase. But I'm convinced most people go back to a
restaurant not so much for the drop-dead decor, or a solicitous
maitre d' or the chance to bag a celebrity sighting for the relatives
back in Duluth, but to eat something so delicious its memory has
stuck around for months.</LD>
<LD>   I've noticed that whenever someone brings up their favorite
restaurant, they can't help but recite their favorite meal there in
the same breath. And once that serendipitous combination is found,
most people won't stray far from the prescription. At Campanile, they
have to claim the grilled prime rib before they even think about
first courses or dessert. At Musso &amp; Frank, it's the flannel cakes or
the grilled calf liver and bacon. At the Grill, the Cobb salad.</LD>
<TE>   When I cast my mind back over a year's worth of eating in Los
Angeles -- and that's at least 10 restaurant meals a week -- the
taste of certain dishes is burned into my memory, as vivid and
immediate as if I'd just laid down my fork moments before. The real
test for me is a dish's hold on my imagination.</TE>
<TE>   For today's Food section, we call in 10 of those recipes, so that
avid cooks out there can try to duplicate the dishes at home. The
choice was just short of agonizing.</TE>
<TE>   A new vigor</TE>
<TE>   But once we had the final list, and cooked them all in our
kitchen, we realized that the dishes that resonated in memory also
said a great deal about the state of the restaurant scene in Los
Angeles right now. Chefs seem to be emerging from a long spell of
conservatism, when it was enough to hunker over the stove and cook
the same dishes night after night. Now the most interesting chefs are
finding their voice again, and we're seeing the beginning of a return
to the creativity and bold innovation of the '80s, when L.A.
restaurants were setting the tone for new cooking in America. L.A.
cooking at its best is pared down, modern and surprising.</TE>
<TE>   They are paying more attention to the way a dish tastes than to
teasing it into a startling construction inspired by the pages of
Popular Science or Architectural Digest. One of the loveliest dishes
I had recently was a bowl of steamed bouchot mussels garnished simply
with a halved lemon and a perfect bay leaf.</TE>
<TE>   When simplicity succeeds, it has a natural grace and logic without
for a minute surrendering its mystery, that one element that, like a
sprinkling of fairy dust, sparks magic. It could be the thrilling
sour of tamarind in an almond sauce that goes with curried
cauliflower and Nantucket scallops at Spago or the blast of green
peppercorns in the vinaigrette that flavors Water Grill's big-eye
tuna tartare. And at the Santa Monica newcomer Whist, roasted
pineapple encrusted with crushed coriander and black peppercorn
frames a gorgeous hunk of custardy foie gras, letting the rich
silkiness of the foie gras shine.</TE>
<TE>   This year I'm seeing a new interest in texture, which points to a
new sensuality in cooking. For Red Pearl Kitchen in Huntington Beach,
Shelley Register created one of my favorite desserts of the year, a
gauzy smooth pot-de-creme suffused with cardamom and served in a cafe
au lait bowl, the better to share. She's one of a new generation of
pastry chefs who are pushing the envelope when it comes to sweets.</TE>
<TE>   Vegetables are finally getting some respect, too, as sides to
order on their own -- potato gratins drenched in cream, roasted
cipolline onions, parsnip purees, baby Brussels sprouts straight off
the stalk. At Lucques, we found a wonderful stuffing for roast
chicken, or any bird for that matter, suffused with earthy green
chard.</TE>
<TE>   Unadorned grace</TE>
<TE>   Another good sign is a return to authenticity with truly regional
Italian and French cooking. Finally, Italian chefs have realized they
don't have to dress up their cooking as French in order to be
appreciated. Gino Angelini at Angelini Osteria is leading the way
with pasta dishes such as his gutsy bombolotti all' amatriciana,
included here. And other chefs now have the confidence to give diners
real Italian food, the kind of dishes they grew up on. On the French
front, bistros such as Mimosa are venturing beyond steak frites to
offer regional cooking from Alsace or Lyon or Provence.</TE>
<TE>   Chefs are no longer slaves of the old restaurant system, who
rarely leave the kitchen. They get out and see the world. Ciudad and
Border Grill's Mary Sue Milliken and Susan Feniger pick up and go off
to Mexico or Asia to ferret out dishes and techniques they can use in
their restaurant kitchens. Lee Hefter at Spago learned to make
agnolotti in Piedmont and brought back aligote (a mixture of potato
and Cantal cheese) from the Michelin three-star chef Michel Bras in
Laguiole.</TE>
<TE>   Cooks also find inspiration here in L.A., where the smorgasbord of
ethnic dining may be more diverse than any other place on Earth.
Fueled by access to authentic ingredients and the bounty of local
farmers markets, a rich stew of cuisines -- Oaxacan, Indian, regional
Chinese, Japanese, French, Italian, Lebanese, Korean -- sparks the
imagination and wafts the scents of cardamom, turmeric root, chipotle
and exotic mushrooms into the most unlikely kitchens. Borders are
fluid, surprises everywhere.</TE>
<TE>   Here then are the year's most memorable dishes.</TE>

<LD>FOIE gras is notoriously difficult to cook. Most chefs end up searing
thin slices or scallops of the fattened duck liver and pairing it
with something sweet. At Whist, Tim Goodell and his chef Jeff
Armstrong, are so entranced with the luxe ingredient they offer a
different foie gras each night.</LD>
<LD>   My favorite, so far, is foie gras with roasted pineapple. The
texture is astonishing, more like custard than anything else, like a
warm version of terrine de foie gras. No skinny slice here but a real
hunk, the size of a fist, seared on just two sides in an extremely
hot pan and then finished off in the oven. The sweet-tart flavors of
roasted pineapple dusted with crushed coriander seed and black pepper
and a tangy pink peppercorn gastrique give this foie gras its edge.</LD>
<LD>   Since there's no sauce to disguise the quality of the foie gras,
if you're going to make this dish, it's imperative to buy the very
best quality of foie gras, such as that from Hudson Valley Foie Gras
Co. ([845] 292-2500 or www.hud sonvallleyfoiegras.com) or D'Artagnan
([800] 327-8246 or www.dartagnan.com).</LD>
<TE>   Whist, 1819 Ocean Ave., Santa Monica, (310) 260-7511</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Foie gras with roasted pineapple</TE>
<TE>   Total time: 1 hour</TE>
<TE>   Servings: 8</TE>
<TE>   Note: Fresh foie gras is available at specialty markets, by
special order and on the Internet. Pink peppercorns are sold at
specialty markets. When searing the foie gras, it is essential to use
a cast-iron skillet.</TE>
<TE>   Foie gras</TE>
<TE>   1/2 fresh pineapple, peeled and cored, then halved lengthwise</TE>
<TE>   2 tablespoons coriander seeds, lightly crushed with mortar and
pestle</TE>
<TE>   2 tablespoons black peppercorns, lightly crushed with mortar and
pestle</TE>
<TE>   Salt</TE>
<TE>   1 1/2pounds moulard duck foie gras</TE>
<TE>   Freshly ground pepper</TE>
<TE>   1. Heat the oven to 500 degrees.</TE>
<TE>   2. Roll the pineapple in the coriander, crushed peppercorns and 2
teaspoons of salt. Set aside.</TE>
<TE>   3. Cut off a small piece from the end of one of the livers. Cook
it over low heat in an ovenproof skillet until all the fat is
rendered, about 10 minutes. Discard the foie gras piece. Place the
pineapple in the fat and cook over medium heat until golden brown and
fork tender, about 6 to 7 minutes, being sure to brown all sides.</TE>
<TE>   4. Transfer the skillet to the oven and roast the pineapple for 10
minutes, turning the pieces once halfway through cooking time. Cut
each piece into 4 pieces and set aside.</TE>
<TE>   5. Cut the foie gras into 8 pieces. Season with salt and pepper.
Heat 2 medium cast-iron skillets over high heat until almost smoking.
Place 2 pieces of the foie gras in each skillet. Turn off the heat.
Sear the foie gras for 30 seconds on each side. (The skillets should
be hot enough to</TE>
<TE>   sear the foie gras with the heat off.) Transfer the skillets to
the oven (still at 500 degrees) and cook until a small sharp knife
inserted into the center feels warm to the touch, 6 to 7 minutes. The
center of the foie gras should be custard-like with a crisp exterior.
Remove the foie gras from the skillets and keep warm. Repeat with the
remaining foie gras.</TE>
<TE>   6. Reheat the pineapple in one of the same skillets over medium
heat, just until warmed through, about 2 or 3 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   7. To assemble, place 1 piece of foie gras and 1 piece of roasted
pineapple on each of 8 plates. Drizzle each plate with about 2
teaspoons of the gastrique.</TE>
<TE>   Pink peppercorn gastrique</TE>
<TE>   1 cup sugar</TE>
<TE>   1 cup Sherry vinegar</TE>
<TE>   1 tablespoon pink peppercorns, slightly crushed with mortar and
pestle</TE>
<TE>   1. Sprinkle the sugar evenly over the bottom of a medium skillet.
Heat the sugar over medium-high heat, swirling the pan as the sugar
begins to melt. Do not stir. The caramel should be a deep golden
brown in about 8 to 10 minutes. Add the vinegar carefully; it will
bubble up. Stir constantly to make sure the caramel dissolves again
evenly. Cook over medium heat until the mixture is reduced by half,
about 6 to 8 minutes. Stir in the peppercorns. (This makes about 1
cup; you'll have some left over for another use.)</TE>

<LD>For me, the definitive dish at the contemporary Swedish restaurant
Gustaf Anders in Santa Ana is Ulf Strandberg's sublime
sugar-and-salt-cured salmon. Strandberg cuts the beautifully marbled
North Atlantic salmon into slices so fine you could practically read
the newspaper through them, and drops them on the plate like a lost
handkerchief. The combination of cold salmon, intriguingly sweet and
salty, and steamed dill potatoes from a lidded porcelain dish is
truly wonderful, especially if you eat it with Strandberg's handmade
flat bread or his Swedish limpa scented with orange peel.</LD>

<LD>TUNA tartare may be the single most popular dish at L.A. restaurants
for the last five years running. But most versions around town are so
anonymous they're forgotten before they're finished.</LD>
<LD>   Not at Water Grill. First of all, the quality of the tuna is
superb. It's hand-cut, so that each glistening piece remains
distinct. Seafood wizard Michael Cimarusti piles the glistening red
cubes on a base of smashed avocado, the better to contrast fat with
lean, and dresses it with a bracing green peppercorn vinaigrette.
Because his touch is so light, the dressing lets the flavor of
Pacific big-eye tuna shine through. Wearing a flouncy skirt of thinly
sliced radishes, this tuna tartare has become one of the restaurant's
signature dishes. It doesn't take a genius to figure out why.</LD>

<TE>   Big-eye tuna tartare</TE>
<TE>   Total time: 30 minutes</TE>
<TE>   Servings: 4</TE>
<TE>   Note: Although this recipe may look intimidating, there's not much
more to it than assembling a salad. Green peppercorns are available
at specialty markets and well-stocked supermarkets. Big-eye tuna is
sold at specialty supermarkets and fish stores. Keep the tuna on ice
as you work with it. Metal ring molds can be found at cookware stores
and are often sold in sets.</TE>
<TE>   Avocado relish</TE>
<TE>   1 ripe avocado</TE>
<TE>   1 tablespoon lemon juice</TE>
<TE>   1 tablespoon diced red onion</TE>
<TE>   1 1/2 teaspoons chopped chives</TE>
<TE>   1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil</TE>
<TE>   Salt, pepper</TE>
<TE>   1. Mash the avocado flesh with the tines of a fork and add the
lemon juice. Add the onion and chives. Add the oil in a stream,
stirring to blend. Add the salt and pepper to taste.</TE>
<TE>   Green peppercorn dressing</TE>
<TE>   1 tablespoon canned green peppercorns, plus 1 tablespoon juice
from the can</TE>
<TE>   1 teaspoon Dijon mustard</TE>
<TE>   2 tablespoons lemon juice</TE>
<TE>   Salt, pepper</TE>
<TE>   6 tablespoons sunflower oil or grape seed oil</TE>
<TE>   1. Place the peppercorns, their juice, the mustard and the lemon
juice in a blender. Add salt and pepper to taste. Blend at low speed
for 30 seconds. Add the oil in a slow stream, blending on high speed.
Taste and adjust the salt and pepper.</TE>
<TE>   Assembly</TE>
<TE>   4 small red radishes</TE>
<TE>   6 ounces big-eye tuna, cut into 1/4-inch pieces</TE>
<TE>   Salt, pepper</TE>
<TE>   1 tablespoon finely chopped chives</TE>
<TE>   1 tablespoon finely chopped red onion</TE>
<TE>   1 cup mixed greens</TE>
<TE>   1. Slice the radishes as thinly as possible, using a mandoline if
you have one.</TE>
<TE>   2. Make a ring with the radishes in the center of each of 4
chilled plates. Place a 2 1/2 inch-diameter ring mold in the center
of each ring of radishes. Divide the avocado relish among the molds;
it should not be more than one-half-inch tall.</TE>
<TE>   3. Season the tuna with salt and pepper. Add the green peppercorn
dressing to taste, about 1 1/2 tablespoons. Add the chives and onion.
Mix well. Adjust the seasoning. Divide the tuna among the 4 molds and
smooth the tops. Remove the molds. Dress the greens very lightly with
about 1 tablespoon of the dressing. Place the greens decoratively
over the tuna. Drizzle the remaining dressing around the plates.
Serve immediately.</TE>

<LD>CAMPANILE'S menu changes just about every day, depending on what's in
season at the farmers market. But the one dish that's been starring
on the menu since Day One is prime rib. Executive chef Mark Peel is
born to grill. In this case, he grills the thick prime rib steak over
almond and olive wood, giving the beef just enough char and smoke to
make it taste like California. Then he smears the steak with a
Provencal-inspired tapenade, adds a svelte red wine sauce and a ladle
of slow-simmered flageolet or cannellini beans and braised bitter
greens. Some people never order anything else at Campanile.</LD>
<LD>   (Almond and olive woods create a gentler smokiness than many other
hardwoods or charcoal. Peel buys his almond and olive wood at
Hollywood Firewood Co., 12915 Raymer St., North Hollywood, (818)
503-6223. The store only has almond wood this season. A small amount
is available for $25; prices for partial cords start at $129.)</LD>
<LD>   Campanile, 624 S. La Brea Ave., Los Angeles, (323) 938-1447</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Grilled prime rib steak with cannellini beans and red wine sauce</TE>
<TE>   Total time: 3 hours</TE>
<TE>   Servings: 4</TE>
<TE>   Note: Look for frozen veal stock at well-stocked supermarkets and
specialty stores.</TE>
<TE>   Cannellini beans</TE>
<TE>   1 tablespoon extra-virgin olive oil</TE>
<TE>   1/4 large onion, diced</TE>
<TE>   3 cloves garlic, lightly crushed</TE>
<TE>   1/2 teaspoon chopped fresh rosemary</TE>
<TE>   3/4 teaspoon chopped fresh thyme</TE>
<TE>   1 bay leaf</TE>
<TE>   1 smoked ham hock or 1/4 pound slab bacon</TE>
<TE>   1 1/2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar</TE>
<TE>   4-5 cups chicken stock or a mixture of half stock and half water</TE>
<TE>   1 cup dried cannellini beans, rinsed</TE>
<TE>   Coarse salt</TE>
<TE>   Cracked pepper</TE>
<TE>   1. Warm the olive oil in a large, heavy-bottomed stockpot over low
heat. Cook the onion with the garlic, rosemary, thyme and bay leaf
until the onion is translucent, about 5 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   2. Add the ham hock or slab bacon, vinegar, 2 cups of the stock
and the beans. Increase the heat and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat
to low and simmer gently, barely bubbling, until the beans are
tender,</TE>
<TE>   1 1/2 to 2 hours, adding stock or water as needed to keep the
beans covered. Skim any foam that rises to the top. Gently stir the
beans once every 30 minutes. Season with salt and pepper to taste.</TE>
<TE>   3. Remove the ham hock or bacon and bay leaf. Allow the ham hock
or bacon to cool. Using your fingers, separate the meat from the fat
and the bone, shred the meat and add to the beans. Or, cut the bacon
into one-quarter-inch dice and add to the beans.</TE>

<TE>   1/2 cup pitted black Kalamata or Nicoise olives</TE>
<TE>   2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil</TE>
<TE>   1/2 teaspoon lemon juice</TE>
<TE>   1/2 tablespoon chopped fresh basil</TE>
<TE>   Cracked pepper</TE>
<TE>   1. Using a mortar and pestle, grind the anchovy, lemon and orange
zests and the garlic into a paste. Add the olives and grind into a
paste. Fold in the olive oil, lemon juice and basil and season to
taste with pepper. (This makes about one-half cup; reserve the
remaining tapenade for another use.)</TE>
<TE>   Red wine sauce</TE>
<TE>   1 tablespoon unsalted butter</TE>
<TE>   2 shallots, chopped (about 2 tablespoons)</TE>
<TE>   1 teaspoon cracked pepper</TE>
<TE>   1/2 cup dry red wine</TE>
<TE>   1/2 cup ruby Port</TE>
<TE>   2 cups veal stock or other stock</TE>
<TE>   Coarse salt</TE>
<TE>   1. Melt the butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Cook the
shallots and pepper until the shallots become lightly colored, 3 to 4
minutes. Add the wine and Port and cook until reduced by
three-fourths, about 15 minutes. Add the stock and reduce the sauce
until it thinly coats the back of a spoon, about 20 minutes. Strain
through a fine-mesh, stainless-steel strainer into a clean, medium
saucepan and season to taste with salt. Keep warm over very low heat.</TE>
<TE>   Assembly</TE>
<TE>   4 (10- to 12-ounce) prime rib-eye steaks, 1 1/2 inches thick</TE>
<TE>   1/4 cup cracked pepper</TE>
<TE>   2 teaspoons salt</TE>
<TE>   8 ounces bitter greens, such as mustard greens, arugula or kale,
tough stems removed</TE>
<TE>   1. Heat the grill on medium-high.</TE>
<TE>   2. Sprinkle one side of the steaks with half the pepper and salt
and press firmly to adhere the seasoning to the meat. Turn the steaks
and repeat on the other side.</TE>
<TE>   3. Grill the steaks about 4 minutes on each side for medium-rare,
about 5 minutes for medium. Allow the steaks to rest in a warm spot
for 5 to 10 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   4. Warm the cannellini beans in a medium saucepan over medium heat
until heated through, about 10 minutes, adding up to 1 cup of stock
if the beans appear too dry. Add the bitter greens, stirring briefly
until the greens just wilt, about 5 minutes longer.</TE>
<TE>   5. Spoon about one-half cup of the beans with a few greens onto
the center of each of 4 large, warm plates. Spread a very thin layer
(about 1 teaspoon) of the tapenade over each cooked steak and, using
a very sharp knife, cut the steaks into slices of no more than
one-half-inch thick. Place the sliced steak next to the beans. Spoon
about one-fourth cup of red wine sauce around each portion of steak
and serve immediately.</TE>

<LD>NOW is the season for Nantucket scallops, those sweet little nuggets
from cold Atlantic waters. You could argue that they don't need
anything but the sizzle of butter in a hot pan, but you'd be wrong.
Lee Hefter, executive chef at Spago, recently came up with an idea
for cooking scallops that riveted my attention. In a marvelous
Indian-inspired dish, he plays the scallops' sweet delicacy against
gently curried cauliflower florets, and trumps it with a thrilling
note of tamarind in an almond coconut milk sauce. Altogether, it's a
magic carpet to the exotic.</LD>
<LD>   (If you can't find Nantucket scallops, regular scallops will do.)</LD>
<LD>   Spago, 176 N. Canon Drive., Beverly Hills, (310) 385-0880</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Scallops with Indian- spiced cauliflower</TE>
<TE>   Total time: 1 hour</TE>
<TE>   Servings: 4</TE>
<TE>   Note: Tamarind paste is sold at Asian markets. To clarify butter,

<TE>   1 teaspoon sugar</TE>
<TE>   1 tablespoon almond paste</TE>
<TE>   1/2 cup coconut milk</TE>
<TE>   1/2 cup chicken or vegetable stock</TE>
<TE>   1. Heat the butter in a small pan over medium heat. Add the

10 minutes. Place in a blender; blend until smooth. Strain, then
adjust the salt.</TE>
<TE>   Cauliflower</TE>
<TE>   1/2 cup (1 stick) butter</TE>
<TE>   1 tablespoon chopped garlic</TE>
<TE>   1 tablespoon chopped ginger root</TE>
<TE>   2 teaspoons chopped jalapeno</TE>
<TE>   1 head cauliflower, about 2 pounds, cut in small pieces</TE>
<TE>   1/2 teaspoon ground nutmeg</TE>
<TE>   1 teaspoon cracked cumin seeds</TE>

<TE>   1 bay leaf</TE>
<TE>   Salt, pepper</TE>
<TE>   1 tablespoon thinly sliced fresh mint</TE>
<TE>   1 tablespoon minced cilantro</TE>
<TE>   1. Heat a saucepan over medium heat. Add the butter, garlic,
ginger and jalapeno. Cook 3 to 4 minutes. Add the cauliflower,
nutmeg, cumin, coriander, bay leaf and salt and pepper to taste.
Cover; cook over medium-low heat until tender, 15 minutes. Remove the

mint and cilantro.</TE>
<TE>   Scallops</TE>
<TE>   1 pound bay scallops</TE>

<TE>   1 tablespoon oil</TE>
<TE>   2 teaspoons butter</TE>
<TE>   Dash garam masala, optional</TE>
<TE>   Cilantro sprigs or basil leaves</TE>
<TE>   1. Season the scallops with salt and pepper. Heat a large skillet
over medium-high heat; add the oil. When it smokes, add the scallops
(cook in 2 batches). When browned on the bottom, turn and cook until
all sides are browned, 1 1/2 to 2 minutes total, stirring to keep
them from sticking. Add the butter and allow to foam. Baste the
scallops with the butter until they are cooked, 30 seconds.</TE>
<TE>   2. Divide the cauliflower among 4 plates. Arrange the scallops
around it. Spoon 2 tablespoons of almond-tamarind sauce on and around
the scallops; dust lightly with the garam masala. Garnish with
cilantro or basil.</TE>

<LD>WHEN it comes to pasta, Gino Angelini of Angelini Osteria in Los
Angeles has the touch. All' amatriciana means "in the style of
Amatrice," near Rome. And that means luscious Italian plum tomatoes
cooked down to a sauce with a little onion, a little hot red pepper
and, most importantly, guanciale, the cured pork cheek with a
distinctive sweet pork flavor. Most cooks here substitute pancetta,
but Angelini cures his own guanciale for this dish. Instead of the
traditional bucatini, a fat spaghetti with a hole in the middle,
Angelini prefers the squat, ridged tube pasta called bombolotti. This
shape is tricky to cook perfectly al dente, but it offers what may be
the perfect proportion of surface to volume for this particular
sauce.</LD>
<LD>   To finish off the dish, Angelini grates a spare amount of sharp
pecorino Romano over the top. Parmesan just doesn't give the
amatriciana the same punch.</LD>
<LD>   The genius of this dish is its simplicity, which also means you
can't compromise on ingredients. Buy good pasta, imported Italian
plum tomatoes and, if you can get it, guanciale. If not, then
substitute the best pancetta you can find.</LD>
<TE>   Angelini uses bombolotti -- essentially, half-rigatoni -- made by
di Sanzio; the shape is called Le Monelle on the package. Look for it
at stores such as Pizzicotto, 11758 San Vicente Blvd., in Brentwood,
(310) 442-7188, and Mario's Deli, 740 E. Broadway, Glendale, (818)
242-4114. But artisanal spaghetti or bucatini will do nicely as well,
or Trader Joe's sells a "bite-size" rigatoni.</TE>

<TE>   Bombolotti all' amatriciana</TE>
<TE>   Total time: 30 minutes</TE>
<TE>   Servings: 4</TE>
<TE>   Note: Guanciale, cured pork cheek, is available by mail from
specialty sources such as Corti Bros., in Sacramento, (800) 509-3663,
and BuonItalia in New York, (212) 633-9090 or www.buonitalia.com.</TE>
<TE>   3/4 pound bombolotti pasta</TE>
<TE>   Salt</TE>
<TE>   1/4 pound guanciale</TE>
<TE>   2 tablespoons extra-virgin olive oil, divided</TE>
<TE>   1 clove garlic, unpeeled</TE>
<TE>   2 tablespoons finely chopped red onion</TE>
<TE>   2 medium tomatoes, peeled, seeded and chopped</TE>
<TE>   1/2 teaspoon dried red pepper flakes</TE>
<TE>   2 tablespoons grated Parmigiano-Reggiano</TE>
<TE>   1 tablespoon grated pecorino Romano</TE>
<TE>   1. Cook the pasta in boiling salted water until al dente, 12
minutes.</TE>
<TE>   2. Meanwhile, cut the guanciale into strips about 2 inches long
and one-fourth-inch thick.</TE>
<TE>   3. Heat 1 tablespoon of the oil in a large skillet over
medium-high heat. Add the garlic and cook until fragrant, 1 minute.
Add the guanciale and cook until lightly brown, another minute (it
will not cook like bacon). Add the onion and cook another minute. If
necessary, spoon excess fat from the pan. Add the tomatoes and cook 2
minutes. Add salt to taste and the red pepper flakes. Discard the
garlic.</TE>
<TE>   4. Drain the pasta and add to the skillet. Add the
Parmigiano-Reggiano and pecorino Romano. Add the remaining tablespoon
of oil and toss together.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>AT Jar in Los Angeles, chef Suzanne Tracht gives an Asian inflection
to steamed black mussels. She serves a bowl heaped with the sweet
plump mussels in the shell and tops them with an emerald thatch of
"water spinach," or ong choy, a leggy Asian green. The idea is to
swish the sweet plump mussels through the juices at the bottom of the
bowl and eat each one with a sprinkling of grassy fennel salt made
from fleur de sel, toasted fennel seed and lemon zest. Divine. At the
restaurant, she also offers a tiny sauceboat of sumptuous lobster
bearnaise. But that's a bit like gilding the lily.</LD>
<LD>   Jar, 8225 Beverly Blvd., Los Angeles, (323) 655-6566</LD>

<TE>   Black mussels with fennel salt</TE>
<TE>   Total time: 20 minutes</TE>
<TE>   Servings: 1 to 2</TE>
<TE>   Note: This fennel salt is delicious. Try it also with grilled
foods or vegetables or just set it on the table as a seasoning. Fleur
de sel is a French sea salt available at specialty markets and
well-stocked supermarkets. Ong choy is a long-stemmed leafy green
available at Asian markets.</TE>
<TE>   Mussels</TE>
<TE>   1 tablespoon chopped garlic</TE>
<TE>   1 tablespoon chopped shallot</TE>
<TE>   1/4 cup olive oil</TE>
<TE>   1 1/2 pounds mussels</TE>
<TE>   Salt, pepper</TE>
<TE>   3/4 cup white wine</TE>
<TE>   2 cups ong choy</TE>
<TE>   1 tablespoon butter</TE>
<TE>   1. Place the garlic and the shallot in a large skillet with the
olive oil over medium heat and cook until the garlic is fragrant and
the shallot has just become translucent, about 2 minutes. Swirl the
pan so the garlic moves and does not burn. Add the mussels. Turn the
heat to high and coat the mussels in the oil, shallot and garlic. Add
a dash of salt and pepper, then the wine. Cover and simmer until the
mussels have opened wide, no more than 2 minutes. Discard any
unopened mussels.</TE>
<TE>   2. Arrange the mussels in a bowl and return the cooking liquid to
the heat. Add the ong choy and the butter. Cook 1 to 2 minutes. The
ong choy cooks down very quickly; you want this to remain brothy.
Pour the liquid on top of the mussels and arrange the ong choy in a
bundle on top. Serve while hot with the fennel salt for sprinkling.</TE>
<TE>   Fennel salt</TE>
<TE>   1/4 cup fleur de sel</TE>
<TE>   3 tablespoons lightly toasted fennel seeds</TE>
<TE>   1/2 tablespoon grated lemon zest</TE>

<LD>SUZANNE Goin has a penchant for lovely grandmotherly French dishes.
She loves to braise meats and loads her plates at Lucques with such
pretty roots and greens that even die-hard vegetable haters are
tempted to eat them.</LD>
<LD>   A case in point, her ladylike version of the French country dish
poule au pot. At the restaurant, it's a piece of boned chicken, set
in a wide rimmed bowl on a cushion of bread stuffing laced with
chicken livers, currants and Swiss chard and a bit of hot red pepper.
Goin adds a splash of rich, clear broth and a handful of dainty root
vegetables from the farmers market. Altogether, it is an immensely
satisfying dish.</LD>
<LD>   The boned chicken may be daunting for home cooks, so we excerpted
the best part: the stuffing.</LD>
<TE>   We tried cooking it on its own and inside a traditional roast
chicken. This recipe is a keeper, for both a casual Sunday supper or
for stuffing the holiday bird.</TE>

<TE>   Lucques stuffing</TE>
<TE>   Total time: 1 1/2 hours</TE>
<TE>   Servings: 8 (12 cups)</TE>
<TE>   Note: This makes enough to stuff 2 large roasting chickens (about
8 pounds each). Roast the chickens at 375 degrees until a meat
thermometer inserted deep into the thigh registers 165 degrees, about
1 hour and 45 minutes. Bake any remaining stuffing in a buttered
baking dish during the last 30 minutes of roasting time (cover it
with foil for the first 15 minutes).</TE>
<TE>   3/4 pound good-quality rustic white bread</TE>
<TE>   3/4 cup extra-virgin olive oil, divided</TE>
<TE>   1 sprig rosemary</TE>
<TE>   2 dried red chiles</TE>
<TE>   3 small or 2 medium onions, diced (about 2 cups)</TE>
<TE>   1 bulb fennel, diced (about 1 3/4 cups)</TE>
<TE>   2 cloves garlic, minced</TE>
<TE>   1 tablespoon ground fennel seeds</TE>
<TE>   1/2 grated teaspoon lemon zest</TE>
<TE>   1 tablespoon minced fresh thyme</TE>
<TE>   Salt</TE>
<TE>   4 fresh sage leaves, thinly sliced</TE>
<TE>   1/3 cup dried currants</TE>
<TE>   1 bunch Swiss chard, roughly chopped</TE>
<TE>   1 tablespoon butter</TE>
<TE>   1/2 pound chicken livers</TE>
<TE>   Pepper</TE>
<TE>   2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar</TE>
<TE>   1. Heat the oven to 350 degrees. Butter a 13-by-9-inch baking dish
and set aside.</TE>
<TE>   2. Cut the crusts off the bread and discard the crust. Tear the
bread into 1-inch pieces; it's OK if they're slightly uneven in size.
Toss the bread in one-fourth cup of the olive oil. Place the bread on
a baking sheet and bake until crispy on the outside but still tender
on the inside, about 15 minutes. Let the croutons cool, then place
them in a large mixing bowl.</TE>
<TE>   3. Reduce the oven temperature to 325 degrees.</TE>
<TE>   4. Meanwhile, heat one-fourth cup of the oil in a 12-inch,
wide-bottomed skillet over medium-high heat. Add the rosemary and
chiles and let them sizzle in the oil to release their flavors, 30
seconds. Add the onions, diced fennel, garlic, fennel seeds, lemon
zest, thyme and half a teaspoon of salt. Cook, scraping the bottom of
the pan with a wooden spoon often as the vegetables brown, about 15
minutes. When they are browned, turn off the heat and stir in the
sage and the currants. Add to the bowl with the croutons. Toss well.</TE>
<TE>   5. Return the skillet to the stove, add 2 tablespoons of oil, and
cook the chard over medium-high heat until wilted, 6 to 7 minutes.
Add to the mixing bowl.</TE>
<TE>   6. Heat a small skillet over medium high-heat and add the butter.
Season the chicken livers with salt and pepper and cook until
medium-rare, 4 to 5 minutes. They should be a little browned on the
outside and a little pink on the inside. Chop and add to the bowl.
Toss well. Season the stuffing with the remaining 2 tablespoons of
oil and the balsamic vinegar. Mix the stuffing with your hands,
gently mashing the ingredients together so they are well blended.</TE>
<TE>   7. Place the stuffing in the baking dish, cover with foil and bake
20 minutes. Uncover and bake until the top is golden and crisp,
another 20 minutes.</TE>

<LD>AT Red Pearl Kitchen in Huntington Beach, Shelley Register has given
the French custard, pot de creme, a delightful makeover. Register,
who is executive pastry chef here and at Tim Goodell's other
restaurants, is something of a chameleon. At Red Pearl, where the
kitchen ranges all over Asia, coming up with a dessert menu to match
was one of her greater challenges.</LD>
<LD>   Her pot de creme is the ideal melding of invention and classicism.
Instead of a dainty lidded porcelain container, she serves it in a
generously sized cafe au lait bowl with a billowy cloud of whipped
cream on top. Dip your spoon into the satiny custard suffused with
green cardamom: The texture and taste are incredibly sensual. Of
course, the classic pot de creme is chocolate, but by steeping pods
of the Sri Lankan spice in cream, she's written a terrific finale to
Red Pearl Kitchen's updated Asian menu.</LD>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Cardamom pot de creme</TE>
<TE>   Total time: 1 1/2 hours, plus 4 hours chilling</TE>
<TE>   Servings: 8</TE>
<TE>   Note: Serve with a dollop of whipped cream and gingersnaps.</TE>
<TE>   1 tablespoon cardamom pods</TE>
<TE>   1 quart half-and-half</TE>
<TE>   1 1/3 cups sugar</TE>
<TE>   12 egg yolks</TE>
<TE>   1. Use the flat side of a knife to crack open the cardamom pods
and remove the seeds. Set the seeds aside and discard the pods.</TE>
<TE>   2. Place the half-and-half in a saucepan and bring to a simmer
over medium-high heat. Add the cardamom seeds. Remove the saucepan
from the heat and allow to steep 15 minutes. Return the saucepan to
the heat and bring the mixture to a simmer.</TE>
<TE>   3. In a mixing bowl, whisk the sugar into the yolks just until
incorporated. Whisk a little hot half-and-half in with the yolk
mixture until most of the liquid is incorporated and the egg mixture
is quite warm. Pour the yolk mixture into the saucepan with the rest
of the half-and-half and heat over low heat 1 to 2 minutes (be
careful that it does not curdle). Strain the custard through a fine
mesh sieve.</TE>
<TE>   4. Heat the oven to 300 degrees.</TE>
<TE>   5. Divide the custard among 8 (3-ounce) ramekins. Place the
ramekins in a 13-by-9-inch baking dish at least 2 inches deep. Fill
the dish with enough cool water to come 1 inch up the sides of the
ramekins. Bake until the custard is set, 40 minutes. The center of
each should be slightly wobbly; check by gently shaking the pan.</TE>
<TE>   6. Remove the ramekins from the water bath and cool to room
temperature. Refrigerate 4 hours or overnight before serving.</TE>

<KH>MATTERS OF TASTE / DAVID SHAW</KH>
<HD>With no straight lines</HD>
<DH>His Quixote winery is all curves, his wine as strong as his
opinions. That's Carl Doumani: He likes what he likes.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>David Shaw</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>DON Quixote is back.</LD>
<LD>   Carl Doumani, Napa Valley's very own Man of La Mancha, turned 70
last month, and he has a brand-new winery -- a Gaudi-like visual tour
de force that features a gold dome, more than a dozen multicolored
ceramic pillars, an exterior tile mural ... and doors and windows
that differ in size and shape from every other door and window in the
building.</LD>
<LD>   The building was designed by Friedensreich Hundertwasser, the late
Austrian artist who was so fond of curves and wavy forms that he once
called the straight line "the tool of the devil." There are no
straight lines in Doumani's winery. Even his desk -- a huge,
two-inch-thick slab of walnut, with a crack down the middle -- is
irregularly shaped.</LD>
<TE>   When Doumani took me through the winery recently, proudly pointing
out the multicolored tiles and strangely shaped oak and walnut
floors, he was virtually cackling about the extraordinary look of the
place. But his pride in both the splendor and the oddity of his new
surroundings notwithstanding, he won't let anyone photograph it.</TE>
<TE>   "All the magazines want pictures, but it isn't ready yet," he
says. "When we get the leaks in the roof fixed and figure out what
kind of grasses and trees we want to plant, then it'll be ready and
then they can take pictures ... maybe late next year."</TE>
<TE>   That's typical of Doumani.</TE>
<TE>   "He always plays by his own rules," says Steve Wallace, a longtime
friend and the proprietor of Wally's wine shop in Westwood. "He's a
great guy, but he's got really strong feelings about how things
should be done -- or not."</TE>
<TE>   Doumani's new winery is named Quixote. So are his flagship wines
-- a Cabernet Sauvignon and a Petite Sirah.</TE>
<TE>   "Quixote? Is there some personal identification there?" I ask him,
recalling the various windmills he's tilted at over the 32 years
since he first moved from Los Angeles to Napa Valley.</TE>
<TE>   He nods and smiles and fiddles with his moustache, now gone mostly
gray.</TE>
<TE>   "There are rumors to that effect," he says with a sly grin.</TE>
<TE>   The first vintage of Quixote wines (2001) won't be released until
2004, but small quantities of a '99 Petite Sirah was produced under
his second label, Panza (as in Sancho), and they're in a few wine
stores and restaurants now. The '99 Panza Cabernet will be released
early next year.</TE>
<TE>   The 2000 Panza Petite Sirah will be released next spring, at $36 a
bottle, the same price as the '99. It's intensely fruity -- mostly
cassis and blackberry -- with what Doumani calls "rounded rather than
angular tannins." The Cabernet, which will sell for $40 when it's
released next summer, has a lingering, jammy flavor.</TE>
<TE>   "I like a long finish on a wine," Doumani says, "because I'm also
a cigar smoker. I want that wine taste still in my mouth when I start
my cigar."</TE>
<TE>   Doumani is not fond of over-oaked wines so the oak notes in all
his wines are subtle.</TE>
<TE>   When the top-of-the-line Quixote wines are released, heavy oaking
isn't all they'll lack. They won't have corks either. Instead,
they'll be closed with a sophisticated version of a screw cap -- "a
roll-on, pilfer-proof aluminum cap," the product of 10 years' work by
Doumani, a longtime critic of the declining quality of corks.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm sick and tired of pouring corked wines," he says.</TE>
<TE>   The fight against corks is but one of Doumani's many crusades. He
is, after all, the man who spent a decade -- and many tens of
thousands of dollars -- battling Warren Winiarski over the right to
the name Stags Leap, the district in southeastern Napa Valley known
for its lush, age-worthy wines.</TE>
<TE>   The battle became known as the War of the Apostrophe after the
courts finally decided that neither man had sole right to the name;
Winiarski kept Stag's Leap Wine Cellars on his labels, and Doumani
kept Stags' Leap Winery on his labels.</TE>
<TE>   The accidental winemaker</TE>
<TE>   Doumani got into the wine business almost by accident. He was a
developer/speculator in residential property and the owner of Dude's
Barbecue in Westwood in 1970 when a friend invited him and his wife
to Napa for a long weekend.</TE>
<TE>   "We had so much fun I decided I'd like to buy five or 10 acres and
build a weekend/summer home to bring our kids to," he says. But a
real estate agent showed him an abandoned 400-acre ranch in the Stags
Leap district -- so named, legend has it, because a noble stag,
pursued by hunters, once leaped to safety across a massive chasm.</TE>
<TE>   The ranch -- originally known as Stags Leap Manor -- had been
built in the late 1880s by a San Francisco entrepreneur but it had
lain fallow for almost 20 years when Doumani first saw it.</TE>
<TE>   He loved it, bought it, restored it and though he was not (and is
not) a winemaker, he knew how to hire winemakers -- and how to run a
business.</TE>
<TE>   As an outsider from Los Angeles, he had some trouble at first
being accepted in the tightly knit Napa world. But he's a big,
good-natured guy, with a ribald sense of humor, and he soon won folks
over. He even founded an all-male eating, drinking and joke-telling
group called the Gastronomic Order of the Nonsensical and
Dissipatory.</TE>
<TE>   Then, in a sense, he became too successful.</TE>
<TE>   "I wanted a winery that made about 12,000 cases a year," he says,
"but it grew to 55,000 cases, and it wasn't fun anymore. I had to
spend all my time managing people. I don't like doing that, and I'm
no good at it."</TE>
<TE>   In time, Doumani sold the winery, got divorced and dabbled --
fruitlessly -- with making mescal. But he kept 150 acres of the
original 400 and decided to start over as a vintner, with a much
smaller winery, planting just 26 of the 150 acres.</TE>
<TE>   Vienna transplanted</TE>
<TE>   One day in 1988, he was in an architect's office in San Francisco,
explaining the kind of winery he wanted, when he saw a calendar with
a photograph of an apartment house in Vienna -- public housing with a
gold dome, multicolored tiles, trees literally growing out of the
windows.</TE>
<TE>   "It was sheer, unadulterated fun," he says, "and I told them, 'I
want something like that.' "</TE>
<TE>   The building had been designed by Hundertwasser, and over several
months' time, Doumani tracked him down in Vienna, only to find that
Hundertwasser had never built a winery and had never done a building
of any kind in the United States.</TE>
<TE>   No problem.</TE>
<TE>   Doumani brought him to Napa four times over the next eight years.</TE>
<TE>   "His first design put the winery underground," Doumani recalls. "I
said, 'This is California. It's sunny. We don't want to be
underground.'"</TE>
<TE>   The two men worked together, and in late 1997, with the winery
itself still incomplete, Doumani moved into his new office there. His
first wines, the 1999 and 2000 Panza wines, were aged and bottled on
the premises but only after the crush and destemming took place
elsewhere. Finally, last year, he did everything at Quixote.</TE>
<TE>   Now he's waiting for the wines to age.</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately, Hundertwasser won't be able to taste them. He died
two years ago.</TE>
<TE>   "But he didn't like wine anyway," Doumani says with a hearty
laugh. "When we'd go to little restaurants outside Vienna together,
he'd have them put one-third wine, two-thirds water in his glass."</TE>
<TE>   Was Doumani appalled?</TE>
<TE>   "Nah. The wine was young and raw and water helped tame it. I even
put a little water in my glass."</TE>
<TE>   I wouldn't recommend that anyone put water in Doumani's Quixote
wines, though -- certainly not in his presence.</TE>
<TE>   They're strong wines, and some folks may feel they too need a
little taming -- but with time, not water. Doumani may have a lance
or two left over from previous battles, and I suspect he wouldn't
hesitate to use one on those "enemies" of Quixote whom Cervantes
called "cowards and vile beings."</TE>

<KH>THE REVIEW</KH>
<HD>Finding a jewel on the La Jolla shore</HD>
<DH>The name may be odd, and the location unlikely, but
Nine-Ten is a hotel restaurant that is one of the year's most
exciting discoveries.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>S. Irene Virbila</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I dip my spoon into the soup. It's as smooth as cream, the flavor a
beguiling, subtly sweet puree of fennel and bell peppers, the whole
effect as delicate as handmade lace. A salad of pears and Julian
apples (from the rustic mountain town east of San Diego) is just
delicious, the sharp crunch of the fruit embellished with
sugar-glazed almonds and pearl-sized nubbles of fresh goat cheese.
The greens in it are feathery wisps so fresh they taste as if they
were picked moments before.</LD>
<LD>   It's not only me. Everyone at my table is equally entranced with
their first courses. I'm thinking that, despite the unfortunate name,
Nine-Ten would be a real find whether it was in L.A. or here in
northern San Diego County. I'm glad now I made the effort to drive
all the way to La Jolla on the basis of a friend's tip.</LD>
<LD>   Nine-Ten doesn't feel much like a hotel restaurant, and that's a
good thing. In fact, I keep forgetting that it's even part of the
Grande Colonial hotel. Outside, the existence of the restaurant is
signaled by a clutch of sidewalk tables. Inside, the long, narrow
dining room is casual and comfortable, more bistro than formal
restaurant. Panels of abstract paintings mounted above the banquettes
add a jolt of color, and a shelf of bulbous ceramic sculptures of
vegetables teetering on shapely silver legs injects some whimsy into
the otherwise sober room.</LD>
<TE>   The minute our waiter hands us the menu, I sit up straighter. It's
small, just one page, listing a handful of appetizers, a handful of
entrees, most of them offered in two sizes -- "tasting" or entree.
The beauty is that the latter is exactly two times the price of the
former. Or, to look at it another way, the "tastings" are half the
size of the entrees. This way you can order two appetizers and stop
there. Or, if more than one entree piques your interest, you can
order half-portions of two main courses, our waiter explains.</TE>
<TE>   We all like the idea. A lot. And the fact that the wine list
offers a particularly broad selection of half-bottles fits in well
with the concept. It's not a problem if your party is four or more,
but if you're just two, you're usually stuck with drinking the same
wine through both courses. Here a twosome has the possibility of
choosing a different wine to go with each course of a three-course
menu.</TE>
<TE>   The staff is so enthusiastic, it's easy to fall into the spirit of
things. One night six of us pounce on the menu, ordering up various
combinations of just about every dish available that night. We share,
or at least taste, what everybody else has on their plate. For the
two couples who don't know each other, it's an ideal icebreaker. Not
to mention fun.</TE>
<TE>   Nine-Ten's chef is 29-year-old Michael Stebner, an American with a
penchant for French food and technique to burn. He cures and smokes
his own delicious salmon. Its subtly smoky, salty-sweet taste goes
beautifully with a pretty salad of arugula, radishes and green beans.
And he's shrewd enough to pair seared foie gras with apples and beets
instead of something cloyingly sweet, the better to taste the melting
sweet fat of the liver.</TE>
<TE>   Steamed mussels are uncommonly good here. They're the variety
called bouchots, tender and sweet and modest in size, served in their
glossy black shells with their mingled juices and a bright note of
lemon. The garnish is half a lemon and a bay leaf. Stebner clearly
has an eye for the simple and the beautiful.</TE>
<TE>   Right now, when Nantucket scallops are in season, Stebner gives
these delicate mollusks -- scarcely bigger than a pencil eraser -- a
slight Sicilian spin. They're sauteed with tiny dice of bacon, an
occasional raisin, a few whole almonds and, for color, green spirals
of the beautiful variety of broccoli called romanesco.</TE>
<TE>   Stebner's cooking leans more toward seafood than easier, and
mostly less interesting, meat. On one visit, he listed cod on the
night's menu. Why not? The incredibly fresh fish was seared on just
one side, bathed in lightly smoky bacon juices and strewn with halved
Brussels sprouts and miniature cauliflower florets so perfect they
could have come from the garden of Eden. (Well, they're from the next
closest thing, the famed Chino Farm in nearby Rancho Santa Fe.)</TE>
<TE>   Though fish is clearly his preference, this young chef doesn't shy
away from meat. The server will inform you that Stebner writes a new
menu every day; in fact, sometimes only a few dishes change, and one
regular seems to be flatiron steak, a satisfying, chewy cut grilled
rare and served in a red wine sauce with sauteed greens and pickled
onions. Another is meaty and tender braised beef short ribs served
with a delightful medley of carrots, parsnips and an occasional
chestnut.</TE>
<TE>   And for a side, if Good Faith Organics braising greens are on the
menu, that's all you need to know. The mustard and other pungent
greens, braised in olive oil with olives, garlic and Parmigiano, are
good enough to consider turning vegetarian and having a double order
for dinner.</TE>
<TE>   A couple of dishes are less successful. The bland poussin (baby
chicken) isn't that compelling, especially in light of the other
choices. It reminds me of something the doctor would prescribe --
with plenty of vegetables, too: Romano beans, fingerling potatoes,
braised leeks. And a rich, butter-suffused lobster risotto is done in
by a powerful dose of truffle oil. It would be far better without it.</TE>
<TE>   By my last visit, the real thing -- white truffles -- had arrived
from Italy, and Nine-Ten had begun offering several a la carte dishes
with truffle shaved over, as well as a four-course truffle menu at
$125 a person that included both white and black truffles. The staff
is running it as an event. Tables all around us are ordering truffle
dishes left and right.</TE>
<TE>   The truffles were good, but not great, most likely because they
were a few days too old. Personally, I'd rather have a lot of truffle
on one dish than a little truffle on several. Truffles are meant to
be extravagant, celebratory, and they work best on something simple
and warm, such as tagliarini, coddled eggs or agnolotti. That night
gnocchi was the best choice.</TE>
<TE>   Although the truffle menu as a whole is disappointing, one dish
stands out: a glorious bollito misto (mixed boiled meats) of veal
shank, pork belly, duck leg and beef short ribs perfumed with some
French black truffle. I'd come back to eat this again, truffles or no
truffles.</TE>
<TE>   For a small hotel restaurant, the wine list is exceptionally
well-chosen, by sommelier Sean Marron, albeit handicapped by
typically high hotel markups. Though there are few bargains on this
list, several outstanding undervalued wines can be found, such as the
2001 Castle Rock Pinot Noir for $26.</TE>
<TE>   Pastry chef Jack Fisher is a talent too. He'll lace a fragile,
shivery panna cotta infused with fennel seed and set it beside some
shaved fennel, citrus segments and a bracing green apple sorbet. A
buttery financier studded with dried cherries resembles a muffin
that's gone to finishing school and met up with a spunky cardamom
gelato. Individual spiced pumpkin tarts come with divine homemade
marshmallows, but the killer dessert is his "half-cooked chocolate
cake," a bowl of molten chocolate black as tar buried beneath an
onslaught of caramel sauce and cream.</TE>
<TE>   With its ingenious market menu, careful attention to ingredients
and Michael Stebner's intelligent, sensual cooking, Nine-Ten may be
the year's most serendipitous discovery. The fact that it's in La
Jolla makes it all the sweeter.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Cabernet is not meant for sipping on its own; it needs food, and this
elegant example is no exception. Made from grapes from Chappellet's
Pritchard Hill vineyard, it's dense and chewy, ripe and yet elegant,
with a classic Cabernet nose of berry, cedar and spice and a discreet
hint of new oak. Though old-style California Cabs can show a lot of
tannin, and this one certainly has its share, it will work
beautifully with a nice steak or an earthy roast. Lay down a few
bottles to mature and reap your reward in added nuances five years
down the line.</LD>

<TE>   Price: Around $30</TE>
<TE>   Style: Elegant California Cabernet</TE>
<TE>   Food it goes with: Grilled steak, roast beef, lamb chops.</TE>
<TE>   Where you find it: Available at fine wine shops and retailers.</TE>

<LD>Surf Theater -- A caption in some editions of Sunday's California
section said that a photo of the Surf Theater in Huntington Beach was
taken in 1939. But some readers noticed that the film listed on the
marquee, "Diary of a Chambermaid," was not released until 1946.
According to the Huntington Beach city historian, the photograph was
taken in the 1950s.</LD>

<HD>CKE Restaurants Expects to Post Fiscal 4th-Quarter Loss</HD>
<DH>The fast-food chain owner attributes the anticipated
shortfall to 'the seasonality of business at Hardee's.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Karen Robinson-Jacobs</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Santa Barbara-based parent company of the Carl's Jr. and Hardee's
chains expects to show a fiscal fourth-quarter loss of at least 6
cents a share -- returning the company to the red after two
consecutive periods in the black, company officials and analysts said
Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   For its fiscal year ending Jan. 27, 2003, CKE Restaurants Inc.
expects earnings of 50 cents to 52 cents a share, Andrew F. Puzder,
president and chief executive, said in a conference call with
analysts.</LD>
<LD>   Company officials did not focus on the anticipated loss in the
conference call, but analysts said the clear message is that the
company will lose 6 cents to 8 cents a share for the fourth quarter.</LD>
<TE>   CKE shares dropped 30 cents, to $4.20, on the New York Stock
Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   Puzder talked with analysts a day after the firm reported net
income of $9.5 million for the third quarter, but the profit was
fueled by one-time events, including a $5.5-million tax break.</TE>
<TE>   Puzder attributed the anticipated "slight loss" in the fourth
quarter to "the seasonality of business at Hardee's." Those stores
are located largely in the Midwest and Southeastern U.S.</TE>
<TE>   "A loss in the fourth quarter was not unexpected," said Greg
Schroeder, a research analyst with Fulcrum Global Partners in New
York. "I think investors will look through [the fourth quarter]" to
the coming fiscal year.</TE>
<TE>   "The questions I get are, 'What are they going to do with
Hardee's?' " he said. "At some point you need to turn Hardee's
around. Before the stock has a strong rally, you need to have some
movement" there.</TE>
<TE>   Hardee's, a brand that has seen declining market share for years,
accounts for about 60% of the company-owned stores but only 7% of the
operating income, said Steven Posey, the company's finance director.
The company is expected to announce an extensive re-branding campaign
for the chain next year.</TE>

<HD>Charter to Slash Jobs in Wake of U.S. Probe</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Sallie Hofmeister</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Charter Communications Inc., the nation's third-largest cable TV
operator, said Tuesday that it would eliminate a "significant" number
of jobs in a management restructuring designed to reverse heavy
subscriber losses and a crisis of confidence on Wall Street in the
wake of a federal probe of the company's accounting practices.</LD>
<LD>   Federal investigators are examining how Charter, which is
controlled by billionaire Paul Allen, the co-founder of Microsoft
Corp., accounts for capital expenditures and subscribers. One
allegation is that Charter kept nonpaying customers on its books to
inflate the subscriber counts that Wall Street uses to value cable
companies.</LD>
<LD>   Speaking at an investor conference in New York on Tuesday, Charter
Chief Executive Carl Vogel acknowledged that the FBI had contacted
several program suppliers to determine whether the St. Louis-based
cable company improperly sought rebates from networks such as ESPN
and Discovery for nonpaying subscribers on its rolls in 2001.</LD>
<TE>   The rebates totaled $15 million, and questions arising from the
practice mostly have been resolved, Vogel said.</TE>
<TE>   Charter, which serves 500,000 cable subscribers in Southern
California, said Tuesday that it would eliminate several
middle-management jobs to push decision making closer to its
customers in the 40 states in which it operates.</TE>
<TE>   The company is expected to lose about 280,000 of its 6.7 million
subscribers this year because of difficult economic times, stiff
competition with satellite TV firms and a purge of nonpaying
customers from its books.</TE>
<TE>   Charter shares rose 1 cent to $1.53 on Nasdaq.</TE>

<HD>China to Ease Auto Financing</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU>Blair Pethel</AU>
<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>China will let foreign automakers such as General Motors Corp. and
Ford Motor Co. offer consumer loans, a breakthrough amid complaints
from banks and insurers over delays in opening the financial services
market.</LD>
<LD>   The move, which China's chief trade negotiator said would be
implemented shortly, would boost automakers' profits in the world's
largest potential car market.</LD>
<LD>   "I would think that early next year the regulation will be in
place, and the auto companies will establish their financing
enterprises," said Long Yongtu, China's vice minister of foreign
affairs and its chief trade negotiator, in an interview in
Washington.</LD>
<TE>   General Motors Acceptance Corp., Ford Financial Services and
similar companies are still awaiting access to China one year after
it joined the World Trade Organization.</TE>
<TE>   Chinese lenders still finance foreign-auto sales, which are
soaring.</TE>
<TE>   China, with 1.3 billion people, has been using regulations to
protect domestic firms from foreign competitors that offer banking,
insurance and other financial services, U.S. and European groups say.</TE>
<TE>   Long said China has had to implement, eliminate or change
thousands of laws, rules and regulations to meet its WTO commitments
to open trade in a range of goods and services.</TE>
<TE>   "We are moving as quickly as we can," he said.</TE>

<HD>CNN-ABC Deal 'Hit a Pause'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>The complexity of merging two news operations has stalled any CNN-ABC
deal, AOL Time Warner Inc. Chief Executive Richard Parsons said
Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Parsons, in a speech before the annual UBS Warburg Media Week
conference, said a merger would make good business sense because it
would allow ABC to benefit from CNN's international reporting
expertise, while CNN could expand its audience via ABC's stations and
generally broad reach. CNN is owned by AOL Time Warner; ABC is owned
by Walt Disney Co.</LD>
<LD>   But figuring out the logistics has been challenging.</LD>
<TE>   "We've hit a pause ... because it's very, very complex," Parsons
said.</TE>
<TE>   ABC and CNN have been in discussions for months about a possible
merger. Last week, CNN Chairman Walter Isaacson said he and ABC News
President David Westin already had worked out how to run their
operations if they are merged. Isaacson said the deal had been
delayed as AOL Time Warner takes care of other issues.</TE>
<TE>   Parsons indicated that the media conglomerate's plate remains
quite full as it sorts out problems at its America Online unit.</TE>
<TE>   AOL Time Warner shares rose 67 cents, or 5%, to close at $13.75 on
the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>

<HD>EchoStar Finally Drops Merger With DirecTV</HD>
<DH>The end of the proposed deal opens the door for News Corp.
to buy a controlling stake in the satellite TV provider.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Sallie Hofmeister</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>EchoStar Communications Corp. finally agreed Tuesday to abandon its
proposed $18-billion acquisition of Hughes Electronics Corp., the
owner of satellite TV giant DirecTV. But EchoStar will end up paying
its El Segundo-based rival only a fraction of a previously negotiated
penalty for backing out of the deal.</LD>
<LD>   Under a settlement with Hughes' parent, General Motors Corp.,
EchoStar has paid the full $600-million breakup penalty, but it will
avoid having to spend $2.7 billion, as called for under the original
merger agreement, to purchase Hughes' controlling stake in PanAmSat,
a commercial satellite service.</LD>
<LD>   The settlement may clear the path for a sale of Hughes to News
Corp., the entertainment giant controlled by Rupert Murdoch that lost
a bidding war to EchoStar a year ago. Murdoch called Hughes
executives Tuesday requesting a meeting with GM in the next two
weeks. Murdoch has said he would be interested in purchasing GM's 30%
controlling stake of Hughes.</LD>
<TE>   Separately, executives of Liberty Media Corp., the cable
programming company controlled by billionaire John Malone, told
investors at a New York conference Tuesday that the company was
interested in buying DirecTV with or without Murdoch.</TE>
<TE>   Jack Shaw, the chief executive of Hughes, said Tuesday that the
company had not had conversations with any potential buyers since
signing the merger agreement last year with EchoStar. But he added
that potential suitors in addition to Malone and Murdoch had
expressed interest in Hughes through friendly third parties.</TE>
<TE>   GM still needs to sell Hughes to finance the automaker's pension
liabilities. Shaw dismissed as "impractical" the idea that Hughes
would be bought in a management-led buyout backed by financial
investors.</TE>
<TE>   The EchoStar settlement perplexed many Hughes investors, who
questioned why GM would free EchoStar of its contractual obligations
at such a modest cost.</TE>
<TE>   Shaw, however, said that settling with EchoStar was a better
alternative than tying up Hughes in court for several years
litigating a dispute between the parties over the breakup fees.
"Litigation like this can go on for two to three years," he said,
"and can get to three to four years."</TE>
<TE>   Hughes executives said the company also wanted to avoid spending
another year waiting for regulatory approval for EchoStar's purchase
of PanAmSat, especially if the two parties were locked in a court
battle.</TE>
<TE>   Shaw refused to comment on whether EchoStar had threatened to file
a lawsuit contesting the merger contract.</TE>
<TE>   EchoStar will take a $700-million write-off in the fourth quarter
to cover the breakup fee and related merger expenses.</TE>
<TE>   The settlement comes two months after federal regulators nixed the
merger of EchoStar and Hughes as anti-competitive. The deal would
have combined the nation's only two satellite providers, leaving some
rural communities not wired for cable with only one alternative for
pay television service.</TE>
<TE>   EchoStar's stock reacted positively to the news, jumping $2.04 a
share, to $21.09 on Nasdaq. Hughes closed at $11.05, down 25 cents,
while PanAmSat shares dropped $4.05, to $15.01. Analysts said
EchoStar's conditional agreement to buy Hughes's 81% interest in
PanAmSat for $22.47 a share was keeping the stock price artificially
inflated.</TE>

<HD>Fed Keeps Interest Rates Steady</HD>
<DH>Policymakers hope the economy can work its way through the
current 'soft spot' without further intervention.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Glenn Somerville</AU>
<BD>Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Federal Reserve kept interest rates steady at four-decade lows as
expected Tuesday, saving its ammunition in hope that the economy can
forge its way past a "soft spot" to more vigorous growth in 2003.</LD>
<LD>   The unanimous decision by the central bank's Federal Open Market
Committee leaves the trend-setting federal funds rate at 1.25%, the
level it hit after the Fed slashed borrowing costs by a bold half
percentage point in November.</LD>
<LD>   "The limited number of incoming economic indicators since the
November meeting, taken together, are not inconsistent with the
economy working its way through its current soft spot," Fed
policymakers said in a statement after their meeting that added
little new to the assessment offered last month.</LD>
<TE>   Analysts said the Fed clearly hoped it was done cutting rates --
but the wording of the statement pointed to a sliver of doubt.</TE>
<TE>   The big cut in November was the only rate reduction in 2002. But
the Fed lowered interest rates 11 times in 2001 as it bid to pull the
economy out of a shallow recession and to give it some lift after the
shock of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the Fed has probably done all it is going to do for this
economic cycle unless some major surprises occur such as a messy war
in the Middle East or the housing bubble bursting," said Sung Won
Sohn, chief economist at of Wells Fargo &amp; Co. in Minneapolis.</TE>
<TE>   Policymakers also maintained their characterization of the risks
the economy faces as being evenly balanced between rising prices and
a renewed downturn.</TE>
<TE>   This was the position they adopted last month when they cut rates,
and it was seen as a signal of steady rates for some time ahead.</TE>
<TE>   Recent economic data have offered a mixed picture of the economy's
prospects. The national unemployment rate unexpectedly rose to 6% in
November, and a report Tuesday said sales at U.S. chain stores
faltered last week.</TE>
<TE>   But a separate report Tuesday showed that October wholesale
inventories fell for the first time in half a year -- a promising
sign in that new orders may pick up because warehouses must be
restocked to keep up with demand.</TE>
<TE>   Fed policymakers said in November that they believed the economy
was going through a weak patch and that, with the
half-percentage-point cut and the series of rate reductions in 2001,
interest rates were low enough to keep growth going.</TE>

<HD>Insider Could Be a Blessing to SEC</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>James Flanigan</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In 1934, President Roosevelt tapped Joseph P. Kennedy, who had
operated some of the most speculative investment pools of the Roaring
'20s, to head the new Securities and Exchange Commission.</LD>
<LD>   An immediate outcry arose over the president's choice. How, after
all, could this man who had wheeled and dealed on Wall Street be the
one to curb the abuses of the day?</LD>
<LD>   That episode was brought to mind Tuesday when President Bush
nominated another ultimate insider, William H. Donaldson, to head the
SEC.</LD>
<TE>   No one is suggesting that Donaldson -- lead name of investment
banking firm Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette -- has committed any
wrongdoing. Indeed, the 71-year-old is seen by many as a model
statesman.</TE>
<TE>   Yet his best-known roles -- as an investment banker and chairman
of the New York Stock Exchange -- raise a legitimate question: Can
anyone who may naturally have loyalties to old Wall Street friends be
a stern and unfettered regulator?</TE>
<TE>   Bush was still parading Donaldson before the television cameras
Tuesday when some prominent investors and others began voicing
doubts.</TE>
<TE>   "How often does it happen that someone who was an intimate member
of an industry is really the right person to clear it up?" asked
Charles Munger, vice chairman of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.</TE>
<TE>   Robert Shiller, a professor of economics at Yale University (where
Donaldson once served as dean of the school of management), wondered
whether Bush's nominee was the right pick at a time when small
investors need someone to protect them from unscrupulous elements on
the Street.</TE>
<TE>   Bush might have been better off finding "someone who could
represent the little guy," Shiller said.</TE>
<TE>   "It looks like a plutocracy."</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Brad Sherman (D-Sherman Oaks), a member of the House Banking
and Financial Services Committee, expressed concern that Donaldson
hasn't done enough before now to decry the scandals plaguing the U.S.
business and financial communities.</TE>
<TE>   "As a former chairman of the New York Stock Exchange, this man
could have had a platform bigger than J. Lo's to speak out about what
was going on," Sherman said. "He has been silent."</TE>
<TE>   To most people, the SEC may seem remote. But its regulation of
corporate accounting and disclosure to shareholders is vital. More
than half the households in the U.S. invest in securities directly or
indirectly through mutual funds and pension accounts. And even those
who don't have a 401(k) depend on the honest workings of the
financial markets to keep the economy prosperous.</TE>
<TE>   During the last two years, of course, the people's faith in this
system has been badly damaged. Widespread evidence of accounting
fraud across corporate America, coupled with the documentation of
dishonest practices on Wall Street, has made ordinary investors think
the game is rigged.</TE>
<TE>   Efforts to restore trust often have ended in shambles. SEC
Chairman Harvey L. Pitt, a former corporate lawyer, resigned last
month under fire for being too close to accounting and financial
firms.</TE>
<TE>   It's doubtful that Donaldson, who hasn't been active on Wall
Street for years, will run into the same sorts of problems that his
predecessor did. Still, it's clear that he must take pains to
separate himself from his past as a creature of the Street.</TE>
<TE>   "The challenge is to find a leader who leaves client interests at
the door, understands the regulatory process ... and can work well
with Congress and the White House," says Joel Seligman, dean of the
law school at Washington University in St. Louis and author of the
definitive history of the SEC, "The Transformation of Wall Street."</TE>
<TE>   As did others, Seligman saw Bush's pledge Tuesday to double the
SEC's budget to more than $800 million by 2004 to be the most
important sign that Donaldson could accomplish the daunting task
before him.</TE>
<TE>   As Donaldson begins to direct those resources, he has a chance to
prove that what some see as the curse of being an insider is really a
blessing because of his knowledge and experience.</TE>
<TE>   "The nature of public service today as it relates to regulation of
business and the financial markets demands that you be both an
outsider and an insider," says Jeffrey Garten, dean of the Yale
Graduate School of Management and a former U.S. undersecretary of
Commerce.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not possible to be effective -- given congressional and
public expectations -- if you have to do on-the-job training."</TE>
<TE>   In the end, it's up to Donaldson to prove, by being an aggressive
watchdog, that he isn't beholden to the world of high finance and big
business.</TE>
<TE>   And he just might do that. It has happened before: Joe Kennedy
(father of President John F.) overcame the firestorm that surrounded
his appointment 68 years ago to go down as a highly efficient
securities regulator, one who brought the newborn SEC some real
respect.</TE>

<HD>New Label Hopes That Carey Pays Diva-dends</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jeff Leeds</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For the first time in months, the record industry is looking to
Mariah Carey for more than the next tabloid headline.</LD>
<LD>   Hospitalized amid a personal meltdown and dumped by her label, the
diva returns to the pop chart's top 10 today. But whether her sales
will justify her superstar paycheck remains to be seen.</LD>
<LD>   "Charmbracelet," Carey's first album for Universal Music Group's
Island Def Jam division, sold an estimated 240,000 copies in its
first week, according to Nielsen SoundScan data, ranking a
respectable, though not dazzling, No. 3 behind country stars Shania
Twain and Tim McGraw.</LD>
<TE>   Universal, a division of Vivendi Universal, signed Carey to an
estimated $20-million, three-album contract this year, four months
after she was dropped by British music giant EMI Group. The
embarrassing dismissal came shortly after her semiautobiographical
film and soundtrack, "Glitter," flopped last fall. And the singer has
been privately criticized by label executives for meandering between
pop and hip-hop audiences while losing ground with both.</TE>
<TE>   Now, the star and her new label are about to find out whether
months of personal and professional refurbishing have paid off.</TE>
<TE>   Music executives say the jury is still out on whether Universal
will turn a profit on the deal, even though it has paid her far less
than the $80 million guaranteed by EMI.</TE>
<TE>   "It's too soon to tell," said attorney John Branca, who represents
such stars as Epic's Michael Jackson and Island Def Jam's Ja Rule.</TE>
<TE>   So far, Carey's first new song, the ballad "Through the Rain," has
barely cracked radio's top 40 around the country.</TE>
<TE>   The album also faces stiff competition at record stores, where it
is competing with a flood of other superstar releases, including the
latest album from Universal's Twain, who remains the top-selling
artist in the nation this week. Twain's album "Up!," which debuted
three weeks ago, had first week sales of more than 800,000 copies.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Carey can claim something of a personal triumph: Universal
executives say the chart figures appear to represent the second-best
debut of her career, behind "Rainbow" in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Lyor Cohen, the former rap entrepreneur who now heads Universal's
Island Def Jam Music Group, said: "I'm not fixated on first week,
even though this first week has shocked the industry naysayers. I
still know bringing Mariah back into the same status as she was
before doesn't happen in one week. There are many more weeks to go,
and I'm up to the challenge."</TE>
<TE>   Rival executives who had competed for Carey when she was dropped
by EMI estimated that Universal would have to sell about 9 million
copies of this and other Carey albums to break even on its deal.
"It's an expensive project. Her next single will have to be a
breakthrough if this is going to be financially sound," said one
competitor.</TE>
<TE>   For its part, Universal insisted it would turn a profit after
selling far fewer copies.</TE>
<TE>   Universal has orchestrated a series of laid-back appearances
designed to present Carey as personable, executives said. The
campaign has included stops on Oprah Winfrey's TV program, an
interview on "Dateline NBC," an MTV special and a live performance
today on NBC's "Today" show to be broadcast from the Mall of America.</TE>
<TE>   Cohen said the label had begun pushing Carey's next single, a
faster tempo song, to hip-hop stations in addition to pop format
stations. Some radio programmers, however, say they remain leery of
Carey's past efforts to cross into hip-hop.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes when you go too far in a certain direction ... it's a
risk," said John Ivey, program director of Los Angeles pop powerhouse
KIIS-FM (102.7). "It's like seeing Carrot Top do "Hamlet.' Nice try,
but not what I'm looking for."</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, Ivey likes "Through the Rain" quite a bit and is
bucking the national trend by playing the song frequently. Carey's
ballad received 46 spins last week at KIIS-FM, making it the No. 6
song on the station, according to tracking service Nielsen BDS.</TE>
<TE>   If Ivey is on to something -- and the album develops into a hit --
Universal can claim bragging rights over EMI, which dropped Carey
after just one album. EMI subsequently sacked the chief of its record
division and later agreed to pay about $30 million to Carey to buy
out her contract rather than release another record.</TE>
<TE>   EMI officials declined to discuss Carey's album. But in a recent
interview, David Munns, vice chairman of EMI's music division, said,
"I can't imagine any circumstance in the future where we would regret
the decision we made."</TE>

<HD>Upbeat Forecast Boosts Stocks</HD>
<DH>Survey of service firms, manufacturers says they expect

<LD>Wall Street bounced back Tuesday after a week of losses, helped by
some upbeat expectations for corporate results in 2003.</LD>
<LD>   The Dow Jones industrial average rose 100.85 points, or 1.2%, to
8,574.26, after losing 458 points over the previous seven sessions.</LD>
<LD>   The Nasdaq composite index added 23.62 points, or 1.7%, to
1,390.76, though that was less than half of Monday's loss.</LD>
<TE>   "Right now, the market is trying to regain its confidence," said
Robert Harrington, co-head of listed block trading at brokerage UBS
Warburg.</TE>
<TE>   After rallying sharply from five-year lows reached in October,
stocks pulled back last week amid disappointing economic reports that
suggested the pace of business activity may be weaker than expected
in 2003.</TE>
<TE>   But Tuesday, a semiannual survey of corporate purchasing managers
by the Institute for Supply Management showed 70% of manufacturers
and service companies said they expect sales to rise next year.</TE>
<TE>   "This forecast should be received as a source of optimism," said
Norbert Ore, chairman of the group's business survey committee.</TE>
<TE>   "As each day goes by, there will be more and more evidence that
the economy is perking up," Joseph McAlinden, chief investment
officer at Morgan Stanley Investment Management, told Bloomberg News.</TE>
<TE>   Traders said the market also may have been cheered Tuesday by
President Bush's choice of William H. Donaldson, a well-known Wall
Street figure, to head the Securities and Exchange Commission.</TE>
<TE>   There was little reaction to the Federal Reserve's decision to
hold interest rates steady. That had been expected.</TE>
<TE>   On the New York Stock Exchange, rising stocks outnumbered losers
by 22 to 10. The margin was 20 to 13 on Nasdaq.</TE>
<TE>   In the Treasury bond market yields edged higher as stocks
recovered.</TE>
<TE>   Among Tuesday's highlights:</TE>
<TE>   * Computer hardware and software shares led the market after
Maxtor, a maker of disk drives, boosted its fourth-quarter sales and
profit forecasts. Maxtor surged $1.11 to $5.72.</TE>
<TE>   Other tech winners included Micron Technology, up 98 cents to
$13.86; Novellus Systems, up $1.87 to $30.84; and Adobe Systems, up
$1.15 to $26.01.</TE>
<TE>   But Nokia fell 59 cents to $17.43 after the world's largest mobile
phone maker said its fourth-quarter revenue would be weaker than
expected.</TE>
<TE>   Computer game makers suffered another day of selling. Activision
slid $1.10 to $17.02, and Midway Games was down 7 cents to $5.63.</TE>
<TE>   * Avon Products jumped $2.50 to $54.75 after raising its
fourth-quarter outlook. Among other consumer-related stocks, Procter
&amp; Gamble gained $1.27 to $87.65 and Coca-Cola was up $1.40 to $46.50.</TE>
<TE>   * Airline stocks inched up after tumbling Monday, when United
Airlines parent UAL filed for bankruptcy protection. UAL added 14
cents to $1.07, Delta gained 38 cents to $12.79, Alaska Air rose 42
cents to $22.45 and AMR, parent of American Airlines, was up 20 cents
to $7.75.</TE>
<TE>   * Some energy stocks gained as natural gas futures prices hit
19-month highs in New York amid cold weather in much of the country
that is drawing down supplies.</TE>
<TE>   Burlington Resources rallied 99 cents to $42.18, Unocal was up 49
cents to $31.20 and Apache added 51 cents to $56.85.</TE>
<TE>   Gas for January delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange rose
27.7 cents, or 6.4%, to $4.64 per million British thermal units, the
highest closing price for a most-active contract since May 15, 2001.</TE>
<TE>   In the week ended Nov. 29, U.S. gas supplies fell to 2.97 trillion
cubic feet, down 6% from the beginning of November, according to
government data.</TE>
<TE>   * Smaller stocks in general were stronger than blue chips. The
Russell 2,000 index rose 1.9% compared with the Dow's gain of 1.2%.
The Standard &amp; Poor's small-cap stock index rose 2%.</TE>
<TE>   * Gold prices continued to pull back after surging last week.
Near-term gold futures in New York fell $2.30 to $323.50 an ounce.</TE>

<HD>Northrop-TRW Merger Clears Key Hurdle</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Peter Pae</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Northrop Grumman Corp. said Tuesday that it reached agreement with
the Justice Department about its satellite business, thus clearing
the way for its $7-billion purchase of TRW Inc. pending shareholders'
approval today.</LD>
<LD>   The Century City-based defense contractor said it had agreed "on
essential terms of a consent decree" with the federal agency that
would assure that the Northrop-TRW merger would not impede "fair and
open competition" in the electronic satellite payload business.</LD>
<LD>   The Defense Department has already signed off on the deal and has
been waiting for the Justice Department to complete its antitrust
reviews. The European Union antitrust authorities approved the merger
in October.</LD>
<TE>   At issue for the Justice Department was whether Northrop would
provide rival Lockheed Martin Corp. equitable access to sophisticated
sensors that go on satellites. Lockheed makes the launch vehicles and
the satellites but has been buying the sensors from Northrop and TRW.</TE>
<TE>   Lockheed raised competition issues, arguing that since the
combined company would make both the satellites and the sensors,
Lockheed would be locked out of the market or have to pay a higher
price for them.</TE>
<TE>   The consent decree would leave Northrop with the possibility of
sanctions if it were found to have engaged in unfair practices
related to the sale of satellite components.</TE>
<TE>   Northrop executives said the decree does not require the company
to divest any businesses. "We are pleased to complete another
significant milestone in our planned acquisition of TRW," Chief
Executive Kent Kresa said.</TE>
<TE>   With the acquisition, Northrop would become the nation's
second-largest defense contractor. TRW and Northrop shareholders are
expected to approve the deal during a special meeting in Cleveland
and Santa Monica, completing Northrop's transformation from a
marginal defense firm in the early 1990s to a behemoth with interests
in an array of Pentagon programs.</TE>
<TE>   Northrop's stock closed Tuesday at $96.62, up $1.27 on the New
York Stock Exchange. TRW shares rose 91 cents, to $51.81, also on the
NYSE.</TE>

<HD>Mezzanine Fund Raises $808 Million</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Josh Friedman</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles-based Oaktree Capital Management has raised $808 million
for its first investment fund dedicated to so-called mezzanine debt.</LD>
<LD>   The OCM Mezzanine Fund topped its target of $700 million when it
closed to new investors in September, said Bill Sacher, Oaktree's
managing director who co-heads the fund. Oaktree plans to announce
the fund-raising today.</LD>
<LD>   Mezzanine financing, a form of junior debt that fills a gap
between private equity investment and more conventional bank loans,
increasingly is being used as an alternative to high-yield bonds in
buyouts, Sacher said.</LD>
<TE>   "We're between the orchestra and the balcony," he said.</TE>
<TE>   A mezzanine loan is senior to the original equity but junior to
the bank debt. It offers higher yields -- typically 10% to 14% --
than bank debt because it includes more risk. Though usually used in
buyout situations, the loans can be extended directly to businesses,
Sacher said.</TE>
<TE>   In a $200-million buyout, a private equity firm might put up $60
million, Sacher said, and be able to borrow $100 million from a bank,
thus needing $40 million in mezzanine financing. He said junk-bond
investors are shying away from deals under $150 million because they
can be illiquid.</TE>
<TE>   With $10.6 billion in private equity under management at midyear,
Oaktree was the 10th-biggest firm nationwide in that asset class and
the largest in Southern California, according to Thomson Financial
Venture Economics and the National Venture Capital Assn. Oaktree runs
about $25 billion overall.</TE>
<TE>   The OCM Mezzanine fund already has completed seven transactions
and invested $109 million, Oaktree said, though it declined to reveal
the companies involved. The fund has more than 50 investors,
including pension plans, endowments and wealthy individuals.</TE>
<TE>   Oaktree Chairman Howard Marks said the fund will try to invest
conservatively because it relies on an operating company's cash flow
to get repaid.</TE>
<TE>   "We're interested in 'old-economy,' stable companies with steady
cash flow: manufacturing, distribution, transportation, retailing,"
Marks said. "None of the risky technology and telecom stuff."</TE>
<TE>   John Danhakl, managing partner at the L.A. buyout firm Leonard
Green &amp; Partners, said the Oaktree team has "shown spectacular
judgment over the years." With TCW/Crescent Mezzanine (a unit of TCW
Group Inc.) and Oaktree, Southern California is home to two of the
premier mezzanine firms, Danhakl said.</TE>

<HD>Occidental to Raise Dividend</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Elizabeth Douglass</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Citing its strong balance sheet and steady forecasts, Los
Angeles-based Occidental Petroleum Corp. said Tuesday that it will
raise its quarterly dividend to shareholders by a penny, to 26 cents,
or $1.04 per year.</LD>
<LD>   The move marks the first dividend increase at the oil and natural
gas producer in more than two decades. Occidental's last dividend
increase came in 1981, when the quarterly payout jumped to 62.5 cents
a share, up from 55 cents. In 1991, that amount -- equal to $2.50 per
year -- was slashed to its current level of 25 cents a quarter amid a
massive corporate restructuring.</LD>
<LD>   Shares of Occidental, which also makes chemicals, rose 23 cents to
$27.90 in New York Stock Exchange trading. The new dividend will be
payable April 15 to people who own company stock on March 10.</LD>
<TE>   While rivals have announced production cutbacks, Occidental plans
to increase oil production by 28%, to 610,000 barrels a day, by 2006.
The company also has been reducing its debt.</TE>

<HD>SBC Scraps Pacific Bell Name and Logo</HD>
<DH>The parent firm adopts its initials for all units in an
effort to present a unified entity better able to compete.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>James S. Granelli</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Pacific Bell, long a stalwart California name, now is just one more
discarded logo for trivia buffs after its parent company scrapped the
names of all its operating units Tuesday in favor of initials: SBC.</LD>
<LD>   SBC Communications Inc., the country's largest local phone
company, made the change to present one brand to compete better
against rivals moving into California and SBC's 12 other states.</LD>
<LD>   "Adopting a single, unified SBC brand underscores our
transformation from a collection of regional companies with separate
identities into a national telecommunications leader with a single
identity," said Chairman Edward E. Whitacre Jr.</LD>
<TE>   The San Antonio company is awaiting approval to offer long-
distance service in California, the nation's biggest market.</TE>
<TE>   The company would not say what would happen to Pacific Bell Park,
home of the San Francisco Giants. Pacific Bell agreed in 1996 to pay
$50 million for naming rights to the new park for 24 years. The ball
field opened in April 2000.</TE>
<TE>   "It's going to be a big issue for us and the Giants," said SBC
Senior Vice President David Nichols. "We're going to sit down and
talk with them about that."</TE>
<TE>   Larry Baer, Giants chief operating officer, said SBC had agreed
for now not to change the park's name, though it has the right by
contract.</TE>
<TE>   "It's our home," Baer said. "It's where we clinched the National
League pennant this year, where Barry Bonds hit his 73rd home run in
2001.... That all happened in Pacific Bell Park."</TE>
<TE>   A more important fiscal issue for SBC is whether it can continue
to take $400 million a year out of the PacBell unit in transfers
questioned by the California Public Utilities Commission.</TE>
<TE>   After SBC acquired PacBell parent Pacific Telesis Group in 1997 in
a $17-billion deal, it began charging an annual royalty "for use of
the [SBC] corporate name." But the PUC questioned whether Pacific
Bell derived any benefit from the SBC name.</TE>
<TE>   Pacific Bell will remain the legal entity for regulatory purposes.
The name also will remain on existing pay phones and equipment, such
as service trucks, expected to be replaced next year. Otherwise, the
company will take much of 2003 to replace the Pacific Bell logo.</TE>
<TE>   Branding experts said SBC needed to consolidate the name to
compete better against AT&amp;T Corp., WorldCom Inc. and Verizon
Communications Inc. They said SBC has a strong presence and is
well-respected.</TE>
<TE>   SBC shares rose 1 cent to $25.70 on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>

<HD>Opening Door to Cash-Balance Pensions</HD>
<DH>Proposal would end moratorium on conversions to the plans,
which many say hurt older workers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Kathy M. Kristof</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Treasury Department proposed rules Tuesday that would end a
three-year moratorium on conversions to a complicated and
controversial type of pension that has been criticized for depriving
older workers of promised benefits.</LD>
<LD>   The new rules are aimed at clarifying whether converting
traditional pensions to so-called cash-balance plans discriminates
against older workers. As proposed, the rules would slightly modify
though largely allow many practices that have made the plans
controversial, pension experts and others said.</LD>
<LD>   "The immediate impact of these rules, if they go into effect, will
be to substantially slash the pensions of older workers throughout
the country," said Rep. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.). "Millions of workers
will see a reduction in the pensions that they anticipated. This will
be a disaster for them and their families."</LD>
<TE>   Meanwhile, employer groups heralded the proposed rules, which must
be approved by the Internal Revenue Service after a public comment
period. Companies maintain that the rules would make pensions less
costly and more widely available.</TE>
<TE>   What are cash-balance plans? What do the new rules allow? Whom
would they cover? Here are some answers.</TE>
<TE>   Question: What's a cash-balance pension?</TE>
<TE>   Answer: It's a type of defined-benefit pension plan -- that's the
traditional pension, which promises a set monthly benefit for life.
Under traditional formulas, pension benefits are calculated as a
percentage of wages multiplied by years of service. A typical formula
might provide 1.5% of final monthly wages, times years of service,
for example. Consequently, a 20-year employee would get 30% of his
final salary in monthly benefits at age 65. All the money contributed
to the plan comes from the employer.</TE>
<TE>   With a cash-balance plan, the employer also makes all pension
contributions. But the worker's pension benefit, which can be paid in
a lump sum or a monthly stipend, depends on how much the employer
contributes every year and the rate of return earned on the account
-- much like a 401(k). Such a plan also is portable, allowing workers
to cart their pensions from one employer to another.</TE>
<TE>   Q: What makes the plan so controversial?</TE>
<TE>   A: About 700 major corporations "converted" their traditional
pensions to cash-balance plans over the last decade. Experts maintain
that the bulk of these conversions drastically reduced future
benefits for millions of workers. Rep. George Miller (D-Martinez),
estimates that about 8 million current and retired workers have lost
$334 billion in promised benefits as a result of conversions.</TE>
<TE>   Hardest hit are usually the oldest employees, who can no longer
count on receiving their promised benefits and are too old to save
enough on their own to make up the difference, said Karen Ferguson,
director of the Pension Rights Center in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   Federal law bars firms from taking away pension benefits that
workers already have earned. However, cash-balance plan conversions
often would stop the continued accrual of pension benefits for older
workers. In other words, a worker would get a benefit equal to the
present value of his or her future pension at age 50 but then work 15
more years without any additional pension benefit. Younger workers,
meanwhile, would continue to accrue benefits.</TE>
<TE>   Dozens of workers have sued, claiming the conversions are
discriminatory. The IRS, which determines whether pensions qualify
for tax-favored treatment, stopped approving cash-balance plan
conversions in late 1999 because of the possible conflict with
federal prohibitions on age discrimination.</TE>
<TE>   The proposed rules clarify the Bush administration's take on the
law and would end the moratorium.</TE>
<TE>   Q: What would the proposed rules do?</TE>
<TE>   A: They would interpret pension law in such a way that
cash-balance plan conversions would not be in violation of age
discrimination rules, as long as they met certain requirements.</TE>
<TE>   Specifically, a plan must give each participant the fair present
value of the existing pension benefit at the time of conversion or
the cash-balance amount, whichever is greater. However, if at the
time of conversion the value of the old defined-benefit plan is
greater than the amount the worker would be due under the
cash-balance formula, the employee could go a period of time, in some
cases years, without earning any new benefits. This so-called
wearaway period is not age discriminatory on its face, according to
the proposed rules.</TE>
<TE>   Q: When would these rules go into effect?</TE>
<TE>   A: They are subject to a 90-day comment period, during which any
interested party can write the IRS, P.O. Box 7604, Ben Franklin
Station, Washington, DC 20044, to express an opinion about the
proposal. There also will be a public hearing in early April. After
that, the IRS will determine whether to finalize the existing
proposal or submit a revision.</TE>

<HD>Sellers of Pirated DVDs Targeted</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jon Healey</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Motion Picture Assn. of America on Tuesday announced a crackdown
on online movie bootleggers, with lawsuits filed against nine
ventures that allegedly sold pirated titles through online auctioneer
EBay Inc.</LD>
<LD>   Meanwhile, the recording industry has shut down the Internet's
most comprehensive source of CD covers, which enabled consumers and
bootleggers to obtain free, digital copies of CD artwork and liner
notes.</LD>
<LD>   The actions reflect the growing reach and intensity of the movie
and music industries' fight against online piracy.</LD>
<TE>   The MPAA's lawsuits are its first against alleged infringers on
EBay, and the Recording Industry Assn. of America's success on the CD
artwork issue came after several months of trying.</TE>
<TE>   Online auction houses, and particularly San Jose-based EBay, have
been an increasingly popular distribution point for DVD pirates. The
MPAA has asked auction sites more than 40,000 times in the last two
years to stop the sale of DVDs that appear to have been pirated, with
the number of requests doubling from 2001 to 2002.</TE>
<TE>   Tuesday, the MPAA announced that it was seeking injunctions to
stop piracy by DVD and videotape sellers in California and seven
other states.</TE>
<TE>   EBay records indicate that several of the sellers had drawn
complaints for delivering pirated material, while others offered
discs of major motion pictures that could be played on any region's
DVD players -- a feature not found on legitimate DVDs.</TE>
<TE>   The MPAA also cautioned online movie buyers to be on the lookout
for pirated discs. In particular, the trade group said, discs for
movies that are still in theaters probably have been pirated, as well
as discs with incomplete or shoddy packaging.</TE>
<TE>   One of the sellers targeted by the MPAA, Todd Aspinwall of Windsor
Locks, Conn., said he had bought all his discs from other EBay
sellers and had no idea there was anything wrong with them.</TE>
<TE>   "If they're going to go after me, they should go after the guys I
get [the DVDs] from," Aspinwall said.</TE>
<TE>   The RIAA's target was CDCovers.cc, an Israeli-based site that has
offered artwork for CDs, DVDs and video games as well as mobile-phone
ring tones.</TE>
<TE>   Matt Oppenheim, the RIAA's senior vice president of business and
legal affairs, said the association and its overseas counterpart, the
International Federation of the Phonographic Industry, have knocked
the site offline in several countries, only to see it relocate and
reopen.</TE>
<TE>   Late last month, however, CDCovers.cc raised the white flag.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been a great adventure but we cannot afford this anymore," a
spokesman for CDCovers.cc said in a note on the site.</TE>

<HD>CalSTRS Sues Qwest for Loss</HD>
<DH>Pension fund blames the $150-million downturn on the firm's
alleged improper practices.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Lisa Girion</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The California State Teachers' Retirement System filed suit Tuesday
against Qwest Communications International Inc., blaming the pension
fund's $150-million investment loss on the telecom- munications
company's alleged improper accounting practices.</LD>
<LD>   Those practices are under investigation by the Securities and
Exchange Commission and the Justice Department.</LD>
<LD>   The scandal precipitated the ouster of longtime Qwest Chief
Executive Joseph Nacchio, who was named as a defendant in the suit,
along with Afshin Mohebbi, who recently resigned as president, and
financier Philip F. Anschutz, Qwest's chairman.</LD>
<TE>   The suit alleges that the Denver-based company, along with several
banks and the Arthur Andersen accounting firm, conspired to inflate
Qwest's financial reports by improperly recognizing revenue from
multiyear contracts immediately and recognizing revenue from
capacity-swap contracts whose only purpose was to boost revenue.</TE>
<TE>   Qwest officials did not return calls seeking comment.</TE>
<TE>   CalSTRS, the nation's third-largest pension fund with $100 billion
in assets, filed the suit in Superior Court in San Francisco on its
own behalf, rather than as a class action.</TE>
<TE>   The action is part of a trend in recent months among large
institutional investors to file individual lawsuits, sometimes in
state courts, in an effort to speed the recovery of investment losses
and demand punitive damages.</TE>
<TE>   Individual suits allow large investors to bypass limitations
imposed on federal shareholder class-action suits by the 1995 Private
Securities Litigation Reform Act.</TE>
<TE>   Large investors that go it alone also may be able to squeeze
bigger settlements out of defendant companies and negotiate better
deals with their lawyers, said Jim Newman, executive director of
Securities Class Action Services, a New York-based firm that tracks
shareholder litigation for institutional investors.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a smart move," Newman said. "It's their fiduciary duty to
maximize their recovery on assets or anything which grows out of
those assets, which includes litigation."</TE>
<TE>   The CalSTRS suit is believed to be one of the first investor fraud
suits to be filed in a California state court and could test the
ability of individual investors to seek remedies under the state's
securities and unfair competition laws instead of the federal
securities laws.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a very unique case, and I think you'll see California
pension funds bringing more of these cases in California courts,"
said Joseph W. Cotchett, a Burlingame, Calif., lawyer who is
representing CalSTRS. "The citizens of California are entitled to
justice in their own court system."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>AOL Time Warner Inc.'s WEA Corp. unit, the distribution division of
the company's Warner Music Group, will close some branch offices and
move its headquarters to New York from Burbank.</LD>
<LD>   The unit will be reorganized into four regional offices, in
Atlanta, Los Angeles, Minneapolis and New York, instead of 10 branch
offices under the current structure, Warner said. The reorganization
will start Jan. 1.</LD>
<LD>   About 50 jobs will be moved to WEA's new headquarters in New York,
the company said. The reorganization is in response to significant
changes in the industry and to a shift in WEA's customer base, the
company said.</LD>
<TE>   Shares of AOL Time Warner rose 67 cents to $13.75 on the New York
Stock Exchange. The news was released after the close of regular U.S.

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Former Safety-Kleen Corp. Controller William Ridings pleaded guilty
to taking part in a scheme with other executives to overstate
earnings by $267 million, driving the firm to file for bankruptcy
protection in 2000.</LD>
<LD>   Ridings admitted to conspiracy, securities fraud and falsifying
records, court papers say. At his plea hearing in Manhattan federal
court, he named former Chief Financial Officer Paul Humphreys and
former Vice President Thomas Ritter as co-conspirators, his lawyer
said.</LD>
<LD>   Humphreys' lawyer, Alan Cohen, said Ridings' plea "should not
reflect on Mr. Humphreys' tenure at Safety-Kleen." Ritter's lawyer
declined to comment.</LD>
<TE>   The plea is the first to emerge from the March 6, 2000, disclosure
of accounting irregularities at the Columbia, S.C.-based company.</TE>

<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Defense contractors Boeing Co. and General Dynamics Corp. said a
federal appeals court blocked the Defense Department from collecting
$2.3 billion it claims the two companies owe for a scrapped Navy
fighter program.</LD>
<LD>   The U.S. Court of Federal Claims issued a stay of its August 2001
decision, saying immediate collection of the money is not in the
national interest.</LD>
<LD>   The Defense Department won an earlier court decision awarding
damages over the radar-evading A-12, which it canceled for cost
overruns and nonperformance in 1991. The Pentagon last week said it
would begin deducting the $2.3 billion from existing contracts with
Falls Church, Va.-based General Dynamics and Chicago-based Boeing.</LD>

right to sue for defamation over an article published in the U.S. and

precedent for courts around the world.</LD>

Jones aimed at stopping a defamation suit in Australia by mining

<LD>Marking a big step to shift movies from celluloid to digital, the
Digital Cinema Initiatives named the Entertainment Technology Center
at USC as its lab of choice and announced that it would begin testing
in January technologies needed to deliver movies to theaters
electronically.</LD>
<LD>   The seven major movie studios created the Digital Cinema
Initiatives in March to establish technology standards and build a
business model that will make it profitable to distribute digital
films electronically to the more than 100,000 theaters around the
world.</LD>
<LD>   Consortium representatives said a team of up to a dozen engineers
and technology experts would work on the standard for end-to-end
delivery -- including final mastering, distribution and exhibition of
a movie.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Jenny Craig Inc., which provides weight loss counseling and low-fat
food, settled a lawsuit filed by shareholders who said the stock was
undervalued in a $115-million buyout.</LD>
<LD>   The firm said in January that it would be bought by investors
including co-founders Sid and Jenny Craig, a Deutsche Bank affiliate
and ACI Capital Co. for $5.30 a share.</LD>
<LD>   Shareholders filed three suits in Delaware Chancery Court. After
negotiations with investors' lawyers, the firm agreed to provide more
information about the sale process, and the suit was settled.</LD>
<TE>   The settlement, which stockholders concluded was "reasonable and
adequate," is subject to a judge's approval at a Jan. 28 hearing,
according to court papers. At the hearing, shareholders' lawyers will
ask for $220,000 in fees and expenses to be paid by the firm.</TE>

<LD>CBS canceled the crime series "Robbery Homicide Division," starring
Tom Sizemore, after a disappointing performance Saturday night.</LD>
<LD>   A network spokesman said the decision to remove the low-rated
drama from film director Michael Mann was unrelated to Sizemore's
arrest over the weekend on suspicion of domestic battery after a
woman alleged that the actor hit and threatened her.</LD>
<LD>   The network, a unit of Viacom Inc., tried playing the show
Saturdays after it struggled in its initial Friday time slot.</LD>

<HD>Brokerages Balk at Hefty Settlements</HD>
<DH>After months of talks, some firms say evidence of misdeeds
doesn't warrant proposed fines of up to $75 million.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Walter Hamilton</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>About half a dozen investment banks are refusing to pay large fines
to resolve government investigations of their stock analysts, a
development that could scuttle months of negotiations aimed at
reaching an industrywide settlement of probes into alleged Wall
Street misdeeds, regulators said Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   The firms, including Lehman Bros. Holdings Inc. and UBS Warburg,
are scoffing at demands that they pay fines of $50 million to $75
million each. Instead, some companies want to shell out as little as
$15 million, one source said.</LD>
<LD>   Their resistance threatens to unravel a hoped-for "global"
settlement that would end multiple state and federal inquiries into
Wall Street practices during the late-1990s bull market, several
state regulators said. The regulators have been probing allegations
that stock analysts intentionally misled investors with their stock
picks and that the firms broke rules regarding the allocation of
initial public stock offerings.</LD>
<TE>   Until this week, the talks appeared to be progressing well, and
some participants had hoped to reach tentative agreements on penalty
amounts by Friday. Regulators will hold a series of critical
one-on-one meetings with the firms through the end of the week.</TE>
<TE>   But over the last two days, a handful of firms have balked at
anteing up, several regulators said. That could be a negotiating
ploy, government officials concede, but they nonetheless say they're
worried by the firms' new intransigence.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm discouraged because I don't think we're going to be able to
do a global resolution," said Christine Bruenn, the top regulator in
Maine and the head of an organization of state securities officials.
"We're going to end up in litigation and are still going to be
looking at each other in courtrooms or across conference tables a
year from now."</TE>
<TE>   Both sides have strong incentives to forge a deal. The
investigations have been time-consuming for regulators, and the
securities houses want a neatly packaged end to their legal woes.</TE>
<TE>   The regulators insist that they will not accept low-ball penalty
payments and will pursue court cases if necessary.</TE>
<TE>   "If I continue my investigation, it's only going to get worse for
them," said Joe Borg, the securities regulator in Alabama.</TE>
<TE>   The firms that are scoffing at paying large fines also include
Deutsche Bank, U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray Inc. and Bear Stearns Cos.,
sources said. Goldman Sachs Group also has sent signals that it is
unwilling to pay the $75 million requested of it, sources said.</TE>
<TE>   Spokespeople for the firms either declined to comment or could not
be reached Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   The brokerages have argued that they did nothing wrong or that the
level of wrongdoing by their analysts was isolated and far less
egregious than that of some competitors, sources said.</TE>
<TE>   "There are different amounts of evidence against different firms,"
said an official at one brokerage. "You want to be fined for what
you've done and what they can prove that you've done."</TE>
<TE>   For the most part, the companies balking at paying large fines
have not been subjected to the torrents of bad publicity that have
washed over rivals such as Citigroup's Salomon Smith Barney unit and
Credit Suisse First Boston.</TE>
<TE>   The bad publicity for those firms has come in the form of
incriminating e-mail messages leaked to the media in which analysts
appeared to admit giving bullish stock advice solely to lure
investment banking work from the subject companies.</TE>
<TE>   Citigroup and CSFB have shown a willingness to settle with
regulators, sources said. However, they too have sought to reduce the
penalties they pay.</TE>
<TE>   State officials say they have turned up damning evidence against
the brokerages with lower profiles, even if that evidence hasn't been
made public.</TE>
<TE>   "The firms would be ill-advised to believe that the lack of
e-mails in the press equates to a lack of evidence against them,"
said Tanya Solov, director of the Illinois Securities Department.</TE>
<TE>   An official at one firm predicted the rest would eventually fall
into line.</TE>
<TE>   "Are some people complaining about what they have to pay? You
bet," the official said. "At the end of the day, would it make the
settlement fall apart? I'd be amazed."</TE>

<HD>Steve Borick to Take Helm of Superior</HD>

<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Superior Industries International Inc. promoted Steve Borick to
president and chief operating officer, as he leads a capacity
expansion at the world's second-largest maker of automotive wheels.</LD>
<LD>   Borick, 50, will take the president title from his father, Louis
Borick, who remains chairman and chief executive, Superior said. The
promotion is effective Jan. 1. The younger Borick has been executive
vice president since January 2000 and a director since 1981.</LD>
<LD>   Superior last month said it plans to expand manufacturing capacity
about 25% in the next two years because automakers are using more
aluminum wheels. The move follows expansions in the last few years at
Arkansas and California plants as well as the building of a factory
in Mexico.</LD>
<TE>   Steve Borick has led the capacity expansion and helped direct the
company's move into production of aluminum suspension components, the
Van Nuys-based company said.</TE>
<TE>   Superior's sales through three quarters of this year rose 23% from
the year-earlier period to $585.9 million.</TE>
<TE>   The company in October said it won aluminum-wheel contracts from
General Motors Corp. for the Hummer H2 and Cadillac Escalade sport
utility vehicles and the Buick LeSabre sedan.</TE>
<TE>   Superior rose 85 cents to $40.95 Tuesday on the New York Stock
Exchange. Superior is second to Hayes Lemmerz International Inc.
among wheel makers.</TE>

<HD>Syncor Taiwan Pleads Guilty</HD>
<DH>The unit and parent are fined $2.5 million in criminal and
civil cases involving payments to obtain foreign business.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>E. Scott Reckard</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A subsidiary of Woodland Hills-based Syncor International Corp. was
fined $2 million Tuesday after pleading guilty to a single criminal
charge of bribing Taiwanese officials, as authorities detailed an
elaborate scheme dating to 1985 that included additional improper
payments in four other foreign countries.</LD>
<LD>   In a separate settlement requiring Syncor International to pay a
$500,000 civil fine, the Securities and Exchange Commission charged
that the firm improperly paid at least $600,000 to obtain business
from doctors in Taiwan, Mexico, Luxembourg, Belgium and France.</LD>
<LD>   The SEC said senior officers of Syncor's foreign subsidiaries knew
about and approved the payments, "in some cases with the knowledge
and approval of Syncor's founder."</LD>
<TE>   Monty Fu, who founded the nuclear-medicine concern, stepped aside
as Syncor's chairman last month when the company disclosed the
questionable payments. Fu's brother, Moses Fu, who had headed the
company's Taiwan-based Asian operations, also stepped down.</TE>
<TE>   Neither was named in either of the government's complaints.</TE>
<TE>   Syncor Taiwan's guilty plea and $2-million fine, which settled a
case brought by the Justice Department, were approved in Los Angeles
by U.S. District Judge Stephen Wilson.</TE>
<TE>   The SEC complaint, filed in federal court in Washington, provides
by far the most comprehensive account yet of the payment schemes,
whose disclosure nearly derailed Cardinal Health Inc.'s agreement to
acquire Syncor. The Justice Department's complaint provides new
details about the Taiwanese schemes as well.</TE>
<TE>   The SEC said that from the time it began to operate in 1985,
Syncor Taiwan paid "improper commissions" to doctors who controlled
purchasing for hospital radioactive medicine departments. The
payments, typically 10% to 20% of the bill, totaled at least
$400,000, the SEC said.</TE>
<TE>   "In most cases, the commissions were paid in cash and
hand-delivered to doctors by the brother of Syncor's chairman, who
was the general manager of Syncor Taiwan during most of the relevant
period until he was promoted in 1998 to manage all of Syncor's Asian
operations," the SEC said.</TE>
<TE>   According to the SEC complaint, Syncor Taiwan in 1998 began paying
improper fees to doctors at state-owned hospitals who in return
referred patients to Syncor medical imaging centers. Syncor Taiwan
paid at least $113,000 in such improper referral fees, which were
"known to and approved by Syncor's founder and chairman," the SEC
said.</TE>
<TE>   The Justice Department said "the responsible officers" of Syncor
Taiwan understood that without the improper payments, the purchases
and referrals would not have been made.</TE>
<TE>   Moses Fu could not be reached for comment.</TE>
<TE>   Monty Fu, who has relinquished any role at Syncor as part of the
company's settlement with the government, hasn't commented on the
case. His attorney, Gordon Greenberg, declined to offer Fu's version
of events, but suggested that the government's depiction of the case
may be incomplete.</TE>
<TE>   "No one should jump to any conclusions about Mr. Fu's conduct
based on Syncor's resolution with the government," Greenberg said.</TE>
<TE>   The SEC also provided details of payments in other countries.
Syncor's Mexican subsidiary, to obtain or retain business, made
$23,000 in improper payments to at least four doctors at
government-owned hospitals in 2000 and 2001, including a personal
loan that was never repaid, according to the SEC. It said Syncor
Mexico also overbilled hospitals for supplies, kicking back excess
payments to doctors, and improperly accounted for at least $200,000
in small incidental payments that were made.</TE>
<TE>   Syncor's Medcon Group, operating in Belgium, Luxembourg and
France, made at least $45,000 in illicit payments and gifts in 2000
and 2001 to doctors at government-owned hospitals, according to the
SEC. These included cash, computers, digital cameras, watches and
expensive wines, the SEC said, adding that Medcon also sent inflated
or fictitious invoices to medical practices and then rebated 80% of
the practices' payments to the doctors for personal travel and other
gifts.</TE>
<TE>   Monty Fu, 56, founded Syncor's predecessor firm in 1974,
introducing the concept of providing hospitals with centralized
deliveries of short-lived radioactive substances to diagnose and
treat diseases.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, in naming Fu an "Entrepreneur of the Year" for the Los
Angeles region, Ernst &amp; Young described Syncor as "the undisputed
leader in the radiopharmacy field."</TE>
<TE>   Both the Justice Department and the SEC allege violations of the
Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which bans the payment of bribes to
foreign officials by U.S. companies and their subsidiaries, and also
requires the companies to maintain accurate records of payments.</TE>
<TE>   The SEC case says Syncor, in a scheme authorized by its chairman,
violated the proper accounting requirements by recording some
payments as advertising and promotion expenses.</TE>
<TE>   Syncor said last week that Monty Fu will hand over enough Syncor
stock to cover the total $2.5 million in penalties the company must
pay to the Justice Department and SEC. He will also give up a
$2.1-million severance payment as he leaves the company.</TE>
<TE>   The settlements allow Syncor's planned acquisition by Cardinal
Health to proceed, although at a renegotiated price of less than $800
million in stock compared with about $870 million before the improper
payments were disclosed Nov. 6.</TE>
<TE>   Sources said that key factors in the deal included having the
foreign subsidiary, Syncor Taiwan, which Cardinal plans to sell or
close, plead guilty to criminal charges.</TE>
<TE>   It also was necessary for Fu to step down voluntarily from the
board, the sources said, since the matter otherwise would have
required shareholders to be notified and to vote on the change.</TE>
<TE>   Robert Bennett, a Washington attorney who helped negotiate for the
company, said the Justice Department and the SEC were aggressive but
also showed sensitivity to shareholders in reaching a settlement with
Syncor in just four weeks.</TE>
<TE>   The complaints do not name any individuals. The Justice Department
said it was continuing its criminal investigation, and the SEC said
it was continuing its civil probe.</TE>
<TE>   Stuart Deming, a former federal prosecutor and SEC attorney who
co-chairs an American Bar Assn. task force on foreign-corruption
issues, said it was the first time a foreign subsidiary of a U.S.
corporation had been prosecuted for the anti-bribery violations
rather than the U.S. parent company.</TE>
<TE>   Over the years, Syncor grew until it had 4,200 employees,
delivering radioactive preparations to diagnose and treat diseases
from 130 "nuclear pharmacies" in the United States and dozens
overseas.</TE>

<HD>Vivendi Yells 'Cut' on Universal Studios' Budget</HD>
<DH>The move, which may be aimed at making the entertainment
assets more attractive to buyers, could result in layoffs in some
divisions.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Richard Verrier, Claudia Eller and James Bates</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>From the corner office that legendary mogul Lew Wasserman occupied
when he built one of Hollywood's great movie companies, Universal
Studios executives are engaged in a much more sober pursuit: slashing
costs to prepare the company for a likely spinoff or sale.</LD>
<LD>   The pressure to undertake a wide array of cuts, including possible
layoffs and the sale of the company's 38-story Universal City Plaza
tower, was made clear Tuesday as top Universal officials were
summoned to a budget meeting in New York with the chief executive of
parent company Vivendi Universal, Jean-Rene Fourtou.</LD>
<LD>   The Universal contingent offered up a number of alternatives for
cutting expenses in the coming year, a prospect that is spreading
unease throughout the movie studio, theme parks, music and television
divisions. Studio Chief Ron Meyer outlined various scenarios,
including one that would involve an unspecified number of job cuts
across the entertainment divisions.</LD>
<TE>   Entertainment executives are waiting to see whether Fourtou will
buy their plans of budget cuts of up to 10% next year or whether
he'll demand more.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, Fourtou gave no indication of how he's leaning as the
cash-strapped company seeks to overcome hefty debt by leveraging its
U.S. assets either through a stock offering or an outright sale.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, Fourtou told analysts in a conference call that "we
think there are a lot of cost-cutting possibilities, particularly in
Los Angeles, and we are working at a plan of reducing costs in those
assets." Words like those have given people on the Universal lot the
jitters.</TE>
<TE>   "People are as nervous as they would be before a TV show or a
movie debut; they just don't know.... There's a lot of anxiety," said
one Universal executive.</TE>
<TE>   Universal already had been feeling the squeeze in recent months as
Barry Diller, now co-chief of the newly reorganized entertainment
group, began taking cost-cutting steps.</TE>
<TE>   Diller's lieutenant, Victor Kaufman, who had earned a reputation
as a hard-nosed budget cutter when he headed Columbia Pictures in the
late 1980s, has been scrutinizing Universal's cost structure from
Wasserman's old office. And for months now, Diller has been forcing
Universal Pictures Chairwoman Stacey Snider to justify expensive
movie budgets, sources inside and outside the company said.</TE>
<TE>   One such project that sources say has come under recent scrutiny
is "Van Helsing," an ambitious action-adventure movie set to reunite
Dracula, Frankenstein and the Wolf Man from early Universal horror
films and budgeted at just under $160 million.</TE>
<TE>   A source said its director, Stephen Sommers, who also directed
"The Mummy" and its equally successful sequel, has offered to cut his
upfront fee to help hold down costs. Sommers did not return calls.</TE>
<TE>   "The studio is insisting on making lower-budget movies, and
they're making everybody take less money," said one producer on the
lot.</TE>
<TE>   Nothing escapes Diller's legendary scrutiny and temper, sources
said.</TE>
<TE>   Diller dressed down executives in a meeting with production and
marketing personnel for the poor opening of Jonathan Demme's "The
Truth About Charlie," an expensive remake of Stanley Donen's classic
"Charade," sources familiar with the episode said.</TE>
<TE>   The movie debuted with a three-day gross of just $2.3 million and
to date has sold $5.3 million worth of tickets domestically.</TE>
<TE>   In recent months, Universal also has been seeking out financial
partners on many of its bigger-budget movies.</TE>
<TE>   Cuts at Universal's theme parks, which already had been cutting
back, would be complicated by the company's union contracts as well
as its partnerships in Florida with investment firm Blackstone Group.
To reduce its costs and raise additional cash, Vivendi is looking for
additional investment partners for the business.</TE>
<TE>   At the meeting in New York, Fourtou also met with senior U.S.
executive Diller, music chief Doug Morris and computer and video
games chief Kenneth Cron.</TE>
<TE>   At Tuesday's meeting, Universal Music Group, the world's largest
music company, was asked to come up with a strategy for further cuts
if the music industry continues its downward slide, said sources
familiar with the meeting.</TE>
<TE>   Those sources said that what primarily was discussed were the
cost-cutting measures that the music division already had undertaken
since the beginning of the year, which included consolidating its two
Nashville-based country labels into one, cutting Motown down to a
skeleton staff, slashing independent promotion by 50%, reducing trade
publication advertising and cutting overhead in its overseas
operations.</TE>
<TE>   Diller and Fourtou also were said to have groused at the New York
meeting about the executive pay packages in the music group.</TE>
<TE>   Meyer declined to comment on the specifics of proposed cuts and
potential layoffs within the studio division.</TE>
<TE>   But sources said they would be concentrated on the studio's
corporate divisions, such as marketing, finance and computer systems.</TE>
<TE>   The cuts are part of Fourtou's ongoing effort to restore Vivendi
to financial health.</TE>
<TE>   Since he took the helm of Vivendi this summer, Fourtou has rescued
the firm from near-bankruptcy caused by crippling debt from a
three-year buying spree that transformed Vivendi from a 150-year-old
water utility into the owner of Universal Studios and leading record
labels with such acts as Eminem and U2.</TE>

<HD>WorldCom CEO's Pay Package Raises Concerns, Judge Says</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>David Glovin</AU>
<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>WorldCom Inc.'s proposed $3.5-million pay package for new Chief
Executive Michael Capellas "raises serious concerns" about how
willing management is to reform the telephone provider, a U.S. judge
said Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff, who last month endorsed WorldCom's
settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission, ordered the
company's representatives to meet with Richard Breeden, his appointed
monitor, to discuss the compensation.</LD>
<LD>   To present "a compensation package so potentially problematic
raises serious concerns as to whether proposed new management is as
committed to reform as the nature of this case requires," said
Rakoff, who retained the power to impose fines against WorldCom as
part of the SEC settlement.</LD>
<TE>   WorldCom filed its U.S. bankruptcy petition in July after
accounting misstatements of more than $9 billion under the helm of
former CEO Bernard J. Ebbers. Ebbers, who received more than $77
million in cash and benefits before quitting in April, also borrowed
$408.2 million from the company. Other executives have been charged
with fraud.</TE>
<TE>   Rakoff reminded executives Tuesday that the company remains "fully
liable" for the entire fraud.</TE>
<TE>   Under the terms of the company's settlement with the SEC, Rakoff
will determine next year how much to fine WorldCom. The size of the
penalty would be based on how much progress the Clinton, Miss.-based
company has made in cleaning up its books and fixing its corporate
governance.</TE>

<HD>Seagate IPO Priced Below Expectations</HD>
<DH>The $870-million offering is the biggest initial stock sale
by a technology company since July 2001.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Seagate Technology Holdings on Tuesday raised $870 million in an
initial public offering after the biggest maker of computer disk
drives cut the price by as much as 20% to entice investors.</LD>
<LD>   The company, which is based in the Cayman Islands but is run from
Scotts Valley, Calif., sold 72.5 million shares at $12 each. That was
below the proposed range of $13 to $15.</LD>
<LD>   The stock will begin trading today on the New York Stock Exchange
under the symbol STX.</LD>
<TE>   The sale of the 17% stake values Seagate at $5.1 billion. Silver
Lake Partners, Texas Pacific Group and other buyout firms that own
Seagate sold 48.5 million shares, while Seagate itself sold an
additional 24 million.</TE>
<TE>   The pullback in technology shares in recent days may have damped
investor interest in the stock, some traders said. The tech sector
rallied modestly on Tuesday after sliding for much of the last week.</TE>
<TE>   Seagate's IPO is the biggest initial stock sale by a technology
company since Accenture Ltd.'s $1.9-billion deal in July 2001,
according to Dealogic. Of 80 IPOs this year, five have been from
technology firms.</TE>
<TE>   Seagate has benefited from making drives for network server
computers, which earn twice the profit of desktop PC drives, analysts
say.</TE>
<TE>   The company's third-quarter revenue rose 22% to $1.59 billion from
a year earlier, while income from operations jumped to $119 million
from $46 million a year earlier.</TE>
<TE>   Still, disk-drive makers often are valued lower than other
computer-related companies because the drives are viewed as commodity
products and can be subject to severe price cutting, some investors
say.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a real cut-throat business," said Brian Salerno, who helps
manage $30 billion at Munder Capital Management Inc. and wasn't
planning to buy Seagate shares.</TE>

<HD>CalPERS Dismisses Two Firms as Managers</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>CalPERS, the biggest U.S. pension fund, said Tuesday that it fired
Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. as an international fixed income manager and
dismissed Credit Suisse Group from its role in hedging about $1.4
billion in assets against currency fluctuations.</LD>
<LD>   Merrill, which managed $543 million in international fixed income
for CalPERS, was dismissed because the pension fund thought staff
changes at the firm hurt performance. Credit Suisse was let go over
differences in investment strategy.</LD>
<LD>   The California Public Employees' Retirement System made the
decisions in closed session in November but reported the information
on its Web site Tuesday as an agenda item for its investment
committee meeting this month.</LD>
<TE>   CalPERS spokesman Brad Pacheco said the dismissals won't affect
the $133-billion fund's brokerage relationship with either of the
firms. Neither firm could be reached for comment.</TE>
<TE>   Pacheco said that beyond citing changes in staff at Merrill Lynch
he could not release further details of why the company was fired.
But he added that the firm was welcome to reapply as a manager in the
future.</TE>
<TE>   Pacheco said Credit Suisse was dropped as a currency overlay
manager mainly over "philosophical difference" but CalPERS staff
added the firm's returns had been less than expected.</TE>
<TE>   In the agenda item, CalPERS staff also recommended that the
pension fund renew the contracts of six international fixed income
managers for a one-year period to oversee $6.22 billion in assets.
The firms are Baring Asset Management, Julius Baer, Bridgewater
Associates, Rogge Global Partners, Wellington Management Co. and
Western Asset Management.</TE>

<HD>Tales of Traveling the Yellow Brick Road of Hope</HD>
<DH>A diverse slate of writers conveys a needed message about
America to a tense world.</DH>

<LD>"When I was young, my house had a magic door," writes Elmaz Abinader.
"Outside that door was .... " Well, America was outside that door.
Main Street, Masontown, Pa. Kids circled around on the playground and
called the girl with unruly hair "darkie."</LD>
<LD>   But inside was America, too. Mom made hummus and baba ghannouj and
pita bread and supervised the children at their chores.</LD>
<LD>   Outside, people spoke English, and little girls played with
Barbies. Inside, the family spoke Arabic, and girls canned fruits and
pickles in the basement and grew up to be poets. Everyone shopped at
the A&amp;P.</LD>
<TE>   I've just peeked in on America's propaganda campaign. You know,
the one where the "great Satan" replies to critics in the world.</TE>
<TE>   The State Department asked 15 notable U.S. writers, including
National Book Award and Pulitzer Prize winners, to reflect on what it
means to grow up in America, to be an American, to write in America.</TE>
<TE>   Their 60-page mini- anthology will be distributed at American
embassies abroad.</TE>
<TE>   From Julia Alvarez:</TE>
<TE>   Ay si / it's my turn / to oh say / what I see, / I'm going to sing
America! / with all America inside me.</TE>
<TE>   Immigrants, the children of immigrants, poets, protesters,
novelists, a former Marine, dreamers, a Native American, an essayist,
the country's poet laureate -- the very idea of summoning a nation's
literary voices to speak to doubters abroad is a buoyant affirmation
of democracy, of pluralism and most of all, of freedom. We could
divide the world between countries that might dare such an act and
those that would not -- but, in fact, the world has already done that
for us.</TE>
<TE>   "The central word about America for many of these writers is
'possibility,' " says George Clack, executive editor of the
collection. What better word could a society advance in the fight
against intolerance?</TE>
<TE>   U.S. law forbids distribution of government propaganda
domestically. But we can eavesdrop on the campaign at the Web site:</TE>
<TE>   us info.state.gov/products /pubs/writers.</TE>
<TE>   For those who like their patriotism wrapped in the flag and
delivered with a fist in the air, it might be unsettling to read
Chickasaw writer Linda Hogan's thoughts on "another part of America"
-- the army's 19th century efforts to cripple Indian resistance by
slaughtering their horses:</TE>
<TE>   remembering the Kiowa man / who sang to cover the screams / of
their ponies killed by the Americans / the songs I know in my sleep.</TE>
<TE>   But what is America if not an endless argument against injustice?</TE>
<TE>   Naomi Shihab Nye tells the story of her father, a Palestinian
immigrant, throwing his faded trousers overboard when his boat
approached the dock in New York City. "If he was starting a new life,
why did he need old pants? ... My father loved the United States for
its optimism, and for welcoming him as it had welcomed millions of
immigrants before him. Everything was possible in the United States
-- this was not just a rumor, it was true."</TE>
<TE>   What is America if not the deeply grooved yellow brick road of
hope?</TE>
<TE>   These testimonials -- wide-ranging, uniformly personal, careful in
their sentimentality -- caught my eye because so much of the war
against terrorism is being fought with blunt force and bravado,
answered by the same.</TE>
<TE>   Yet the pen can explain what the smart bomb cannot: "It's an
implicit aim of our republican form of government," writes novelist
Richard Ford, "that citizens not be so preoccupied with the mechanics
and philosophy of citizenship, but rather that we concern ourselves
with acting -- even if blithely -- as citizens. National identity is,
thus, a means to the end of individual freedom, not an end to
itself."</TE>
<TE>   In this clash of global cultural and religious values, we can
presume that zealots overseas have minimal appetite to digest
America's propaganda, true. But that doesn't make this exercise any
less worthwhile.</TE>
<TE>   Our enemies have questioned the purpose of the United States.
Here, in a sampler of voices from our hyphenated pedigrees, the Jew,
the black, the Latvian, the German, the Swiss, the East Indian, is
the reply: We Americans do too, as we always have. It's what we call
our conscience.</TE>

<HD>Take Two Aspirin and Call Congress</HD>
<DH>Adding a flexible drug benefit to Medicare could bring down
costs.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Dana P. Goldman and Geoffrey F. Joyce</AU>
<BD>Dana P. Goldman is director of health economics and
Geoffrey F. Joyce is an economist at Rand in Santa Monica.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When Medicare was begun in 1965, U.S. annual spending for
prescription drugs was less than $4 billion. No one even thought to
include a drug benefit as part of Medicare. This year, spending on
pharmaceuticals will exceed $400 billion. Drug therapy has become one
of most important ways to manage chronic illness, and many health
plans have turned to pharmacy benefit managers to administer their
benefits.</LD>
<LD>   Congress, now in the throes of considering changes in Medicare
coverage, should add a prescription drug benefit to Medicare and
assist state Medicaid programs overwhelmed by rising pharmacy costs.
In doing so it should look to the experiences of the benefit
managers.</LD>
<LD>   Pharmacy managers have transformed the mix of drugs prescribed to
treat illness under private insurance plans and the way they are
dispensed. Early on, they took a hard line and refused to pay for
certain drugs. Not surprisingly, this led to considerable
dissatisfaction among patients and doctors. They also tried
increasing the co-payments, the amount a patient pays when filling a
prescription.</LD>
<TE>   More recently, pharmacy managers have switched to incentive-based
plans wherein most drugs are covered but enrollees pay "tiered"
co-payments ranging from low ones for generic drugs to pricier ones
for brand-name medications. The active ingredient in the heartburn
drug Zantac, for example, can be purchased as the generic ranitidine
for about half the price.</TE>
<TE>   Our three-year study of 75 large employers shows that changing
drug benefits can result in a dramatic drop in total drug spending by
insurers and employees. Increasing a single drug co-payment from $5
to $10 cut overall drug spending by 22% among workers. Adding an
additional tier to an existing plan (for example, charging $20 for
brand drugs rather than $10 for all drugs) reduced overall spending
by 19%.</TE>
<TE>   Some of these plan savings will eventually show up in lower health
insurance premiums, though we don't know how much of the savings will
trickle down to consumers. But when it comes to controlling rising
drug costs over long periods, these changes are marginal at best.
Unless plans continue to raise co-payments and add tiers, costs will
keep rising because of more use of existing medications and the
introduction of new, expensive drugs.</TE>
<TE>   Ultimately, controlling drug spending will require new approaches
to the drug approval process and in how benefits are designed. For
example, the Food and Drug Administration approves drugs if they are
shown to help patients more than existing medical practice does.
Congress should require that economic impact -- whether the drug is
worth the extra price and whether it will promote competition within
a class of drugs -- also is considered. This is an opportune moment
for such an experiment given that new FDA Commissioner Mark McClellan
is an economist as well as a physician.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, Congress also will need to consider the health
consequences of any legislation involving drug benefits. Most
middle-income people with chronic illnesses such as diabetes and
asthma continue to take their medications when co-payments rise. But
other populations that are more sensitive to co-payments, such as the
elderly poor, would require more generous benefits.</TE>
<TE>   Congress should clear the way for state Medicaid programs to
experiment. For example, why not allow a Medicaid plan to offer
medicines for chronic diseases free but charge high co-payments on
less essential medications?</TE>
<TE>   Also, a catastrophic drug plan -- one that would not cover routine
prescriptions but would kick in once expenses exceeded a certain
amount, such as in the case of a life-threatening accident or illness
-- would be valuable to those without existing prescription drug
coverage. Why not start with such a plan and see how much it costs?</TE>
<TE>   Thirty-seven years ago, Congress chose not to include a drug
benefit in Medicare. Medicine has come a long way since then. It's
time for Congress to move with the times and provide more
flexibility.</TE>

<HD>Anti-Islam Rhetoric Undercuts Moderates</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Salam Al-Marayati</AU>
<BD>Salam Al-Marayati is executive director of the Muslim
Public Affairs Council, which is holding an interfaith panel
discussion on religious extremism Dec. 21. Web site: www.mpac.org.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Now kill all the boys and all the women who have had sexual
intercourse.</LD>
<LD>   -- Numbers 31:17</LD>
<LD>   Don't think that I came to bring peace on earth! No, rather, a
sword.</LD>
<TE>   Matthew 10:34</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   When such violent Old and New Testament verses are quoted, they
usually are put in proper historical context. Yet the same standard
of interpretation is not applied when the Koran is quoted. In fact,
it's not even allowed. And Islam is called the violent faith.</TE>
<TE>   Because of the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, there seems to be
open season on Muslim history and sacred texts.</TE>
<TE>   I can understand this knee-jerk response to extremism; if I were
not a Muslim, I would have similar sentiments. But rather than
dealing with the complex realities of the world by oversimplification
of Islam and Muslims, we need to adhere to a common standard of
measuring religious attitudes and combating religious extremism from
all quarters.</TE>
<TE>   American talk show hosts, columnists and political leaders seem
lately to have become experts on Islam, the Arabic language, South
Asian politics and Islamic law.</TE>
<TE>   Fox News commentator Bill O'Reilly, for example, has compared the
Koran to Adolf Hitler's "Mein Kampf," and the Rev. Pat Robertson has
called Muhammad a warrior and Islam violent at its core.</TE>
<TE>   Preaching to Muslims about the need to modify their faith is about
as outlandish as Protestants preaching to Catholics about priestly
celibacy or Muslims demanding that Judaism be separated from Zionism
to remove the terrorist threat from extremist Israeli settlers in the
West Bank and Gaza Strip.</TE>
<TE>   When violent biblical references are brought up, the usual
response is that the era of Christian and Jewish violence is long
past and that Islam is the problem today. But violence inspired by
religious ideology is timeless and afflicts everyone; why not address
the issue across the board? Ireland and the former Yugoslavia come to
mind.</TE>
<TE>   Let me offer an opinion on those who pontificate on the need for
reforming Islam: Your simplistic "solutions" have undermined the
authentic and invaluable work of Muslim reformists. When Deputy
Defense Secretary Paul D. Wolfowitz praises those he calls "moderate"
Muslims, that in itself marginalizes the people he is promoting.</TE>
<TE>   There have been several new books and television shows on topics
involving Islam and Muslims. Some of this is testimony to the
curiosity and goodwill of the American people, who want a more
educated perspective on issues affecting the United States and the
world. But there are those who perpetuate misconceptions about Islam
and distorted images of Muslims to feed the war industry, who exploit
the pain and suffering of Sept. 11 to lead the United States into
wars that do not make sense, as in Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   Robertson and the Rev. Jerry Falwell, both of whom have publicly
called Islam a violent religion, are politically allied with the Bush
administration. Though President Bush has disavowed those positions,
Falwell and Robertson have been projected in the Muslim world as
spokesmen for all Americans.</TE>
<TE>   When people like former South African President Nelson Mandela
declare that the United States is a threat to world peace, when
Europeans and Canadians have unfavorable attitudes toward the U.S.,
then moderation is not just a Muslim problem.</TE>
<TE>   If we want progressive Muslims to be listened to in the Muslim
world, we need to stop making them seem like puppets of American
authoritarianism.</TE>
<TE>   As an American Muslim, I call on other moderates to talk about the
national security interests of our country and to end the
counterproductive verbal and political assaults on Islam.</TE>

<HD>A Clumsy U.S. Risks Ties to Seoul</HD>
<DH>South Korean anger over road accident carries makings of
crisis.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Victor Cha and Michael O'Hanlon</AU>
<BD>Victor Cha is a professor at Georgetown University;
Michael O'Hanlon is a scholar at the Brookings Institution.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The makings of a crisis are evident on the Korean peninsula. And it
is not about North Korea's clandestine uranium-enrichment program or
about the Dec. 19 presidential elections. Instead the crisis revolves
around the U.S. armed forces, which are badly mishandling relations
with South Korea. Not only is this increasing anti-Americanism among
long-standing friends complicating day-to-day alliance activities, it
is making the United States begin to resemble, in Korean eyes, the
latest in a long line of foreign occupiers.</LD>
<LD>   The tensions may not undercut the alliance in immediate terms; the
threat from North Korea remains too real and other bonds remain too
strong for South Koreans to take such a dramatic step. But over the
longer term, Seoul might see more and more advantages to associating
with China and fewer to working with the U.S. Nearly 15,000 people
took part Sunday in a show of anti-American sentiment, the largest in
years.</LD>
<LD>   The current situation has political antecedents dating back two
years, to when differences between President Bush's hard-line
philosophy toward North Korea and South Korean President Kim Dae
Jung's softer "sunshine policy" were perceived in Seoul (correctly or
not) as undercutting inter-Korean efforts at detente.</LD>
<TE>   But relations between South Korea and the U.S. really took their
downturn after the accidental deaths of two South Korean teenagers
last summer. Apparently, a U.S. armored vehicle traveling on a
winding road during a military maneuver hit the two girls. The two
American personnel involved were on duty at the time of the accident,
meaning that under existing but outdated alliance law they were tried
in a secretive U.S. military court. Both were acquitted; no superior
officers were tried or otherwise held accountable. Several months
later, Bush sent a letter to the South Korean people expressing
regret, but that belated and impersonal gesture seems to have done
little to assuage a growing anger among the South Korean people,
media and government.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps the acquittal of the U.S. personnel was the right outcome.
Accidents happen, but two facts stand out here. First, the basic
information about the accident seems to paint the Americans in an
unfavorable and guilty light. Second, more information about what
happened has been released only very slowly.</TE>
<TE>   The handling of this event highlights a disconnect between
Pentagon lawyers tasked with avoiding concessions on alliance legal
issues for fear of creating new precedents and strategists who think
about the longer-term implications of such decisions on alliance
cohesion.</TE>
<TE>   This mix of high-handedness and secrecy is imperious. It reflects
the attitude that great powers typically have displayed toward their
smaller and weaker allies. It is not the way the U.S. armed forces
characteristically conduct themselves. It is wrong.</TE>
<TE>   This lack of American sensitivity has galvanized activist groups
and caused anti-Americanism to resonate now with a broader audience
in South Korea, arguably more so than at any other time in the
postwar era.</TE>
<TE>   Granted, the protests over the last two weeks at U.S. military
installations in South Korea do not resemble the radical
ideologically committed movements to expel the U.S. from Korea of the
1980s (ban-mi anti-Americanism).</TE>
<TE>   Today's sentiments, though less radical, do reflect a critical
view of the practical civil-military dimensions of the U.S. military
footprint (bi-mi anti-Americanism) that has had appeal among South
Koreans as a widespread social movement, spearheaded by educated,
Internet-savvy nongovernmental organizations and civic action groups.</TE>
<TE>   If the symbol of anti-Americanism in the 1980s was a
bandanna-wearing, Molotov-cocktail-toting radical student, today's
symbol is a housewife or a bank employee. This is potentially even
more threatening to the long-term future of the alliance, if American
heavy-handedness causes this issue-based, bi-mi  anti-Americanism to
metastasize into the more dangerous ban-mi radical ideology across
the broad spectrum of Korean society.</TE>
<TE>   The implications could go far beyond negotiations over future U.S.
base rights in South Korea. Beyond its economic exports and markets,
Korea is of tremendous strategic value to the United States for its
democratic institutions and its military bases and its strong armed
forces, which can help the U.S. with global military missions.</TE>
<TE>   Tragic military accidents always strain alliances. Thankfully,
enduring interests and strong bonds of friendship and shared
experience usually reassert themselves after time. But recovery is
much faster and much more likely when those who are responsible for
accidents accept responsibility and come clean.</TE>

<HD>Cheney Wins, Public Loses</HD>
<DH>Court decision on the vice president's energy policy
meetings is an advance only for those who would conduct the nation's
business behind closed doors.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Vice President Dick Cheney scored big-time, to use one of his
favorite phrases, when a federal judge on Monday tossed out a General
Accounting Office lawsuit against him. The lawsuit, which was
instigated by Reps. Henry A. Waxman (D-Los Angeles) and John D.
Dingell (D-Mich.), sought to force Cheney to release records of
participants in and the topics of private meetings held by his energy
task force. To hear Waxman and Dingell tell it, unless the GAO
appeals the decision, it might as well shut up shop. Hardly. But the
implications of Judge John D. Bates' decision are serious.</LD>
<LD>   Whether Cheney had a legal obligation to provide the documents can
be legitimately disputed -- as can the question of whether the GAO
was venturing into new territory. But Bates was wrong in denying the
ability of the GAO to launch almost any lawsuit because it is not, in
his view, "an independent constitutional actor."</LD>
<LD>   In fact, each year the GAO carries out numerous investigations
into government affairs, and in 1980 Congress passed a law giving the
comptroller general judicial enforcement power -- in other words, the
right to sue. Furthermore, in 1983, the Supreme Court ruled that the
GAO had a statutory right to obtain drug company documents.</LD>
<TE>   Bates, however, has construed this right so narrowly that the
current comptroller general, David M. Walker, will probably be forced
to appeal. Given that this is the first lawsuit the GAO has filed,
the mere threat of legal action appears to be a potent weapon for the
agency -- and one that it has not abused. While it is premature to
forecast the demise of the agency, the inability to threaten a
lawsuit certainly would be a blow to its power and authority.</TE>
<TE>   The truth is that Cheney should never have let it come to this.
The GAO was seeking information that was probably trivial, at worst
embarrassing, to the administration. But the public has a fundamental
right to know who is in the room when high officials craft energy
policies that affect the lives of Americans.</TE>
<TE>   Cheney may see his victory as significant for restoring the power
of the executive branch against congressional intrusions, but he
loses in the court of public opinion. More important, those who
believe in open government also lose.</TE>

<HD>Mr. Lott's Good Ol' Days</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Incoming Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott (R-Miss.) insisted Monday
that his fawning testimonial last week to Strom Thurmond (R-S.C.),
once an outspoken segregationist, was just part of "a lighthearted
celebration" of the retiring senator and his "legendary" life.</LD>
<LD>   When that explanation didn't fly, Lott tried again, issuing an
apology to "anyone who was offended." Lott said he didn't mean to
"embrace discarded policies of the past" when he paid homage to
Thurmond's ignominious history as the standard-bearer for the racist
Dixiecrat Party in 1948.</LD>
<LD>   What Lott said at the retiring Thurmond's 100th birthday party
was: "I want to say this about my state. When Strom Thurmond ran for
president, we voted for him. We're proud of it. And if the rest of
the country had followed our lead, we wouldn't have had all these
problems over all these years, either."</LD>
<TE>   To paraphrase George Bernard Shaw, the truth is often spoken as
jest. If there was truth-telling in Lott's dreadful lionization of
Thurmond, it must be this: That Lott and perhaps others toasting the
frail, wheelchair-bound Thurmond in the Dirksen Senate Office
Building last week still pine for the good ol' days.</TE>
<TE>   Those were the days before federal lawmakers, judges and federal
troops stirred up "problems" like school desegregation, voting rights
guarantees, an end to "white" and "colored" drinking fountains and
laws against the lynchings that kept this regime of humiliation and
terror in place. Those were the days indeed.</TE>
<TE>   The Dixiecrat Party formed to freeze these remains of an
antebellum world in place as President Harry Truman announced his
intention to temper some of its most reprehensible features. In late
1947, a presidential panel that Truman convened after a particularly
brutal wave of racial violence proposed anti-lynching legislation,
the integration of interstate transportation and the armed forces and
an end to the poll tax that blocked many blacks from voting.</TE>
<TE>   The Dixiecrats broke with the Democratic Party over these
proposals, only thinly disguising their racism by asserting that the
federal government could not dictate to sovereign states. The new
party's ticket of Thurmond and Mississippi Gov. Fielding Wright
carried four Southern states in 1948, drawing a million voters. Some
may have been on hand last week for the off-color jokes and off-key
rendition of "Happy Birthday."</TE>
<TE>   The historian Robert Dallek has suggested that instead of lauding
Thurmond's segregationist policies, Lott might have chosen instead to
salute Thurmond for finally moderating his views on civil rights as
he saw racism becoming politically untenable. But to do that, Lott
would have to see "these problems" for what they really are: part of
this nation's long and difficult struggle toward social justice.</TE>
<TE>   If Lott cannot shed his nostalgic view of racial segregation he
can hardly claim to be a national leader.</TE>

<HD>EU Should Embrace Turkey</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>At a moment when Islam and the West seem about to regress to the
blood-soaked past, the European Union has a chance to encourage peace
by inching open its doors to a predominantly Muslim democracy.</LD>
<LD>   The union's 15 nations meet today and Thursday in Copenhagen to
consider expansion. They will invite 10 nations to join. Turkey isn't
among them, but that secular state will be the hottest item on the
agenda.</LD>
<LD>   Although only 3% of Turkey's 297,000 square miles lie in Europe,
west of the Bosporus Strait, NATO admitted the nation in 1952. Fifty
years later, the EU's leaders should start things rolling for Turkey
to join their exclusive club as well.</LD>
<TE>   Getting to that point would be risky, complicated and
time-consuming -- but worth the effort. In 1999, when the union first
declared Turkey a candidate for membership, it established a rigorous
criterion. First the nation, with its history of torturing dissidents
and slaughtering ethnic minorities, would have to respect human
rights.</TE>
<TE>   The government in Ankara already has abolished the death penalty
and given its Kurdish minority more freedoms. That's not enough. A
smart move now would be to free several Kurdish politicians expelled
from Parliament in 1995 and kept imprisoned ever since after an
infamously unfair trial.</TE>
<TE>   Then Ankara should change course and support the deal that U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan brokered to reunite the rival Greek and
Turkish sides of the disputed island of Cyprus. At the summit in
Copenhagen, the EU will invite the Greek Cypriot side of Cyprus to
join in 2004. But the union would prefer to admit a united Cyprus,
governed by a Swiss-style confederation with broad power-sharing.</TE>
<TE>   The controversy surrounding the prospect of Turkey's admission to
the union does not end, however, with human rights or Cyprus. Former
French President Valery Giscard d'Estaing, who now presides over the
Convention on the Future of Europe, has questioned the European
identity of Turkey and its adherence to Western values.</TE>
<TE>   Yes, Ankara is in Asia. But the country's most visible and
magnificent landmarks -- the Blue Mosque, the St. Sophia Cathedral --
are fully anchored in Europe. And Turkey's strategic location as a
gateway between continents could play a key role in European security
and defense.</TE>
<TE>   One more thing. Opening the European door to negotiations with a
moderate secular government in a mostly Muslim Turkey might nudge
other Muslim countries toward democratic values and further undermine
the debatable notion that a "clash of civilizations" is at hand.</TE>

<HD>Affirmative Action Fulfills Promise of 1776</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Please explain to Michael Ramirez (editorial cartoon, Dec. 7) that
when the words "We hold these truths to be self-evident that all men
are created equal" were written, virtually no one, including the
founding fathers, believed them as we do now. Even those few who may
have believed that African, Asian or Indian men were created equal to
Caucasian men of European descent did not act on that belief for
nearly a century.</LD>
<LD>   Because we are only recently coming to truly believe those words
of 1776, we now need some affirmative action to make up for decades
of denying minorities (especially the poor ones) equal employment,
education and social opportunities. It is a small price to pay for
not believing those words for two centuries.</LD>

<HD>Legislature Begins Effort to Get a Handle on Budget</HD>
<DH></DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>David Friedman's "Test for Democrats" (Opinion, Dec. 8) was a breath
of fresh air in the current dysfunctional political climate in
Sacramento. Gov. Gray Davis is more interested in looking good than
in making the tough decisions. His signing of the farm-labor
arbitration bill in September was a disaster to business confidence
and did nothing to encourage investment or expansion in California.
The situation in our Legislature is more discouraging. The Democrats
just don't get it. By the time they get through with the budget
crisis, there won't be any strength left for anything creative, let
alone some of the monumental long-term issues facing the state.</LD>
<LD>   Thousands of aerospace jobs are gone. Other states are taking our
high-tech jobs. Manufacturing jobs are lost daily. Until there is a
climate of vigorous business investment, high-quality job growth just
isn't going to happen.</LD>
<LD>   Donald W. Koch</LD>
<TE>   Redondo Beach</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Friedman's test for Democrats is simple: Become Republicans. Adopt
the program of the Republicans and, voila, you have credence. His
assertion that the Democrats have near-monopoly power is patently
wrong. In the special session of the Legislature, Republicans have
two votes for every one that the Democrats have. It is simple
arithmetic.</TE>
<TE>   The budget requires a two-thirds majority to pass. The Republicans
have 32 members in their caucus, none of whom has indicated what cuts
he or she wants to make, and all of whom have said there should be no
increase in taxes. Where is the monopoly power of the Democrats, Mr.
Friedman?</TE>
<TE>   Ralph Dearden</TE>
<TE>   Santa Maria</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   We can all take comfort in knowing that many of our California
lawmakers and their wives holed up in $300-a-night rooms in Maui to
concentrate on our state's massive budget shortfalls ("A Little R&amp;R
in Maui Precedes the Budget Battle," Dec. 9). It is also reassuring
to be told that "no special favoritism would result from the
get-together," which was sponsored by the California Correctional
Peace Officers Assn.</TE>
<TE>   If that is not reassuring enough, consider the quote from Sen. Liz
Figueroa: "It's not like when we are in Sacramento. We can sit down
and have candid discussions about the budget." Let's not ask just
what they do when they are in Sacramento.</TE>
<TE>   But not to worry; many say they will pay for the trip's expenses
out of their own pockets, and we can take that to the bank, right?
Now that I have been advised that the budget discussions are going so
well, I will relax. But first I have to park my turnip wagon.</TE>

<HD>Ryder's Encounter With L.A.'s System of Justice</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Warning, Probation for Ryder," Dec. 7: The justice system in L.A.
County has finally gone insane. Dist. Atty. Steve Cooley and Deputy
Dist. Atty. Ann Rundle are the people who need counseling. The Winona
Ryder trial and sentencing were a vendetta. Ryder was accused of
shoplifting -- not a violent crime.</LD>
<LD>   Rundle actually passed on a murder case to one of her colleagues
so she could prosecute Ryder for what must be one of the weakest
felony cases in the history of L.A. What a waste of taxpayer money!</LD>
<LD>   R.L. Lawrence</LD>
<TE>   Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Ryder's lawyer, Mark Geragos, is quoted as saying that she is "the
classiest woman I have ever met." How does he define classy? Choosing
better clothes to steal? Buying drugs using back-alley methods? Lying
at the drop of a (stolen) hat? Allowing her lawyer to attempt to
destroy the reputations of the employees who had the audacity to stop
her crime spree?</TE>
<TE>   Had she been classy, she would have admitted her mistake, said she
was sorry and made amends. Then it would have been forgiven by the
public -- and forgotten. She will not carry that scarlet "S" for
shoplifting but for her strings of lies, shifting of blame and sleazy
legal tactics.</TE>
<TE>   Mary Ehly</TE>
<TE>   Lancaster</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Those in the inept L.A. district attorney's office could not
convict O.J. Simpson but really outdid themselves with that criminal
genius and menace to Saks Fifth Avenue, Ryder. What a group! They
should all be disbarred, starting with Rundle. She should crawl on
her hands and knees to the Polly Klaas family, and Ryder, and beg
their forgiveness.</TE>

<LD>Re "Portrait of the Con Artist as a Young Man," Dec. 6: Recent
articles featuring Frank Abagnale (con man turned successful fraud
consultant and subject of a Steven Spielberg movie), Winona Ryder
(celebrity thief), Enron Chief Financial Officer Jeffrey Skilling
(scoundrel extraordinaire) and California poet laureate Quincy Troupe
(lied about his academic credentials) point to the same conclusion:
Crime pays and an honest person is a fool. Perhaps we should
officially recognize the truth and start teaching our children the
real essential skills for success -- lying, cheating and stealing.</LD>

<LD>Re "A Beating for Good Schools," editorial, Dec. 8: I do not have the
time or energy at this moment to write a comment merited by your
editorial. I retired from the Los Angeles Unified School District
after almost 40 years of service and I am now in my sixth year as a
two-day-a-week volunteer bilingual school psychologist in an
elementary school in East L.A. (not to mention the time I spend
keeping up with the history of -- and the more recent research in --
child development and attending professional seminars).</LD>
<LD>   A large percentage of the student body in the LAUSD is poor and
does not speak English as a first language. A large percentage of the
immigrants from Spanish-speaking countries were not educated in their
home countries and know little about the responsibilities of
parenthood. If President Bush wants to really see to it that "no
child [is] left behind," he will start by urging Congress to
authorize (with money) better training of teachers and better
compensation for them -- and by teaching parents how to truly be
parents in the 21st century.</LD>
<LD>   I have had much experience in many elementary schools and I have
never worked in one that has such an outstanding staff, from the
administrators to the plant manager, but our achievement scores are
low because too many kids come to kindergarten not knowing their
names, the alphabet or the numbers. Whose fault is that?</LD>

<TE>   You describe the Bush administration's approach to school reform
-- forcing good schools within a district to accept students from
failing schools even if the resulting overcrowding destroys the good
school -- as a "strange" way to solve public education's problems.
Strange indeed, if the objective is to improve public education. But
who said that's the objective of the anti-government,
pro-private-sector clique ruling our country? By destroying public
schools, this administration can create a market for private and
religious schools, which is its ultimate objective.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>"Be a Straight Shooter When One's Needed," subtitled "Sometimes,
principles call for a 'High Noon,' " (Commentary, Dec. 6) is indeed
right that "High Noon" is a parable for our time. But James Holmes'
shallow reading of the movie gets the message completely backward,
reading it as a call for us to stand by the Bush administration in
its bellicose stance on the Middle East and its rush to war in Iraq.</LD>
<LD>   A review of "High Noon" by Brian Webster, on the Web, reminds us
exactly who the cowardly friends were who abandoned Gary Cooper: The
movie is "all the more meaningful when it's considered in the light
of events at the time of its making, when people in the movie
industry who were targeted by the House Un-American Activities
Committee experienced similar abandonment by their friends."</LD>
<LD>   For our time, it is all too popular to turn quickly to war against
a tinhorn dictator or back the destruction of the Palestinian people
because to do otherwise is to risk charges of lack of patriotism or
worse. As it was for Cooper's character, it is time for us to risk
popularity and "respectability"; we must oppose the coming
conflagration in the Middle East.</LD>

<LD>Re "Up in Arms at Mexico Border," Dec. 8: It seems that Chris Simcox
of Tombstone, Ariz., who owns the local paper, has formed a posse
(Civil Homeland Defense) to engage the drug lords and "coyotes"
crossing illegally into their part of the good ol' USA! Bravo, Chris!
Thanks for doing what Cochise County Sheriff Larry Dever isn't -- his
job. As for Isabel Garcia of Derechos Humanos, who seems to be on the
side of the illegals, read the law books. If it's a misdemeanor to
cross into this country, then they've committed a crime and can and
should be arrested. If you're truly worried about their safety, as
you claim, and you know there are dangers involved, then you wouldn't
encourage them to cross the border or offer them help if they get
here.</LD>
<LD>   And as for Mary Frances Berry, chairwoman of the U.S. Commission
on Civil Rights, I say the same thing. If they break the law, arrest
them.</LD>

<HD>Autistic Boy Is Mother's Life, Say Friends</HD>
<DH>Stanton woman accused of trying to kill her son loves the
5-year-old, according to neighbors. 'I know there is more to this
story,' one says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jennifer Mena</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Stunned by news that their neighbor is accused of trying to kill her
autistic son, residents of a Stanton neighborhood said Heidi Shelton
had been intensely dedicated to the 5-year-old but struggled to meet
his special needs.</LD>
<LD>   "I don't believe it," said Darci Rynsburger, a neighbor who
described herself as a former close friend of the mother. "She
worshipped that boy."</LD>
<LD>   Shelton is scheduled to be arraigned today on a charge of
attempted murder and child endangerment. Orange County sheriff's
officials say she tried to poison her son -- and herself -- with
overdoses of Xanax, an anti-anxiety drug. The two were found Sunday
night by Shelton's mother, who lives with the family.</LD>
<TE>   "Her intent was to kill him and herself. We know, just by
statements she made, that that was her intent," said Jim Amormino,
spokesman for the Orange County Sheriff's Department.</TE>
<TE>   Amormino said he did not know if Shelton, who has a prescription
for the Xanax, was motivated by frustration with her son's condition.
Autism is a neurological disorder that affects a person's ability to
interact with others.</TE>
<TE>   It's a story that neighbors in the condominium complex in the 7200
block of Penn Way, nestled in a cluster of streets off Beach
Boulevard, said they find hard to accept.</TE>
<TE>   "Zachary is her whole life," said Reggie Bernard.</TE>
<TE>   Neighbors said Shelton dropped a real-estate career to take care
of the boy herself. She took frequent walks with him and never seemed
to be upset. He loves remote-controlled cars, hats and the color
pink.</TE>
<TE>   But they said they knew the single mother faced problems.</TE>
<TE>   Shelton "has been dealt a rough hand" and had been troubled about
life events even before Zachary was born, Rynsburger said. She would
not elaborate, but added that despite her troubles, Shelton "could
never kill that boy. She loved him. I know there is more to this
story."</TE>
<TE>   Neighbors said, however, that Zachary is rambunctious and has
required constant attention.</TE>
<TE>   Bernard said he and his wife had taken care of Zachary a few
times.</TE>
<TE>   Other neighbors noted that Shelton worked to keep her cool.</TE>
<TE>   "Heidi had learned to live with the pressures," said neighbor Joan
Bergeron. "She was a wonderful mom and a wonderful person. I would
leave my grandchildren with her."</TE>

<HD>Bill Proposes 'Fingerprinting' of Firearms</HD>
<DH>Critics oppose plan that would require gun makers to
register weapons' ballistics.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Carl Ingram</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>SACRAMENTO -- A legislative advocate of tighter gun controls has
introduced a bill requiring that the "ballistic fingerprint" of the
hundreds of thousands of handguns, rifles and shotguns sold in
California be registered with state Department of Justice.</LD>
<LD>   The bill, SB 35, by Sen. Jack Scott (D-Altadena) would create a
state database operated by the Department of Justice that could be
tapped by police to match the unique characteristics of bullets and
cartridges with firearms used in crimes.</LD>
<LD>   Scott conceded that ballistic fingerprinting is not a perfect
crime-fighting technique, but said that California, as what he called
the No. 1 state "in population and gun sales," should not wait for
the federal government to devise a national system.</LD>
<TE>   "I believe that the state of California ought to take the lead on
this issue," he told reporters. "This is one more tool in the arsenal
of law enforcement."</TE>
<TE>   The bill, introduced Monday, includes no method of financing the
program, but Scott said he may amend it to include a fee on gun
purchases.</TE>
<TE>   Ballistic fingerprinting is the shorthand description of the
distinctive marks left on every bullet fired by a rifle or handgun.
The marks are formed on the projectile by the spiraling grooves in
the gun bore that give the bullet its spin. Also, an indentation is
made when the firing pin strikes the cartridge. Like fingerprints,
each mark is unique to the gun that fires the bullet.</TE>
<TE>   In California, the task may be daunting. Last year, there were
354,202 sales of new and used handguns and long guns, according to
the Justice Department. In 1993, a record 642,197 guns were sold.</TE>
<TE>   Organizations of gun owners and manufacturers attacked the bill,
questioning the accuracy of using ballistics to identify the owner or
owners of a gun used in a crime.</TE>
<TE>   "Do we really know the state of the art? Is it reliable? We know
it will be expensive, but will it be worth the cost?" asked Jerry
Upholt of the California Rifle and Pistol Assn.</TE>
<TE>   The National Shooting Sports Foundation, which represents major
firearm manufacturers, challenged the accuracy of ballistic
fingerprinting in establishing a law-enforcement registry.</TE>
<TE>   "We support the use of ballistic imaging in a forensic way in the
prosecution of criminals," a foundation spokesman said. But, he
added, "our industry position is there are a whole lot of questions
yet to be answered."</TE>
<TE>   For example, he said, when a gun is new it will produce a certain
set of distinctive markings on a bullet and casing. But as the
firearm becomes worn from use, he said, the markings change and no
longer are identical to the original ones.</TE>
<TE>   Andrew Arulanandam, spokesman for the National Rifle Assn., which
opposes use of ballistic imaging, said New York and Maryland have had
similar systems for years.</TE>
<TE>   In those states, he said, the systems have "resulted in zero
prosecutions." He said firearm fingerprints can be altered by running
a file down the bore or changing the firing pin. "Any such actions
would render the database useless," he said.</TE>
<TE>   But Scott, an author of many gun-control bills, contends the NRA
has "opposed almost every sensible gun safety bill that I can think
of." He said the group's credibility was "open to question." He also
noted that the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms
supports the use of ballistic fingerprinting.</TE>
<TE>   Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer, whose department has made a preliminary
examination of ballistic imaging and questioned its effectiveness,
supports the concept of ballistic imaging but prefers that it be
handled by the federal government, said a spokeswoman. She said
Lockyer has no position on the bill.</TE>
<TE>   Because of state budget constraints, Scott said his proposal
probably would need to be implemented over several years, but as a
first step gun makers would be required to fire a gun before it was
sold and keep an electronic record of the ballistic characteristics
of the firearm and bullet for law enforcement.</TE>

<LD>A man with a suspicious device strapped to his chest holed up inside
a Wells Fargo bank branch in Banning for more than five hours Tuesday
as people inside fled, including some who climbed to the roof and
shimmied down a pole.</LD>
<LD>   The man surrendered about 5:30 p.m. after talking to authorities
by phone. He was identified as Valine Ulmer, 66, of Banning,
officials said.</LD>
<LD>   He was handcuffed and led away from the bank in his underwear,
apparently to ensure that he was not concealing other suspicious
devices.</LD>
<TE>   About seven people were inside the bank when the man walked in
about noon, authorities said. No injuries were reported in the
incident.</TE>

<LD>Meeting for the first time since the announced discovery of an
earthquake fault below the Belmont Learning Complex, members of the
Los Angeles school board Tuesday night hinted that building a smaller
high school on a less seismically scarred portion of the site might
be the least painful alternative.</LD>
<LD>   In a 20-minute discussion, Supt. Roy Romer outlined three options
for the troubled property near downtown. Those are: razing two
buildings, but keeping and retrofitting four buildings that do not
sit right on top of the fault; finding an entirely different location
for the school; or using 12 acres of the 35-acre site that seem
safest to build an entirely new high school for 1,500 to 2,000
students. About 3,600 students were to be accommodated in the
original construction plan.</LD>
<LD>   Pressed by board members, Romer suggested that retrofitting the
existing buildings might prove too costly. Offering no details, he
allowed that building on the 12 acres would be the more likely
option, but stressed that he wanted to wait for a district study, due
within 60 days.</LD>
<TE>   Board member Jose Huizar, whose district includes the site, has
publicly supported that option. Board President Caprice Young said,
"I might support the 12 acres." At the conclusion, Romer said he had
heard "more preference" within the board for the 12-acre option.</TE>
<TE>   Still, a majority continued to express doubt that a school would
be built on the site of the complex, which has cost $175 million and
has never been completed because of previous problems with
underground gases from former oil wells. Earlier this year, the board
moved to revive the stalled project and authorized studies on ways to
deal with the pollution. But the announcement last week that a small
fault had been discovered underneath two of the six unfinished
buildings ended efforts to quickly revive the project, which already
is the most expensive high school in the state.</TE>
<TE>   Board member David Tokofsky raised the possibility of selling the
property and changing plans for a new school on the Ambassador Hotel
site to accommodate capacity lost at Belmont.</TE>
<TE>   Board members lamented the district's inability to complete a
seismic study before construction began. They also questioned the $6
million the district has spent studying the Belmont site since the
board voted in March to revive the project.</TE>

<LD>An aspiring screenwriter was found guilty Tuesday of making false
bomb threats at the Los Angeles Times in a scare that forced the
evacuation of the newspaper building and the closure of two downtown
blocks in late July.</LD>
<LD>   Frederick Bernard Cheaves, 31, told a guard he had a device in his
book bag to trigger a bomb. The bag contained only papers.</LD>
<LD>   A Superior Court jury deliberated 10 hours. Cheaves, scheduled for
sentencing Jan. 7, faces up to four years and eight months in prison.</LD>

<LD>A 105-year-old deodar cedar called "The Big Tree" was approved as a
local landmark by the city's Landmark Commission in a 6-0 vote Monday
night.</LD>
<LD>   The designation protects the tree from being chopped down without
city permission.</LD>
<LD>   The site on 5th Street was put up for sale after the death of its
90-year-old owner earlier this year. The trustee of her estate had
argued that the tree could endanger those in housing units considered
for the site.</LD>
<TE>   But Greyling Gentry, who lived in a house next to the cedar as a
child, told commissioners that "there has been no liability from it
for 105 years."</TE>

<HD>H. Brimah; Mississippi Delta Doctor Cared for HIV Patients</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Hamza Brimah, a doctor credited with dramatically improving health
care for HIV patients in the Mississippi Delta, has died. He was
believed to be 40.</LD>
<LD>   Brimah, a Nigerian who received training in AIDS care in London
and New York, was found dead of a gunshot wound to his head Monday at
his home in Greenwood, Miss., authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   Sheriff's deputies found a note from Brimah specifying his burial
wishes. The coroner ruled the death a suicide.</LD>
<TE>   "It's a big loss to the community because he was very much
involved in improving the quality of life here in the Delta," said
Dr. Alfio Rausa, a health officer who worked frequently with Brimah
to promote HIV and AIDS prevention.</TE>
<TE>   The region, one of the poorest areas in the nation, has one of the
highest HIV infection rates in Mississippi.</TE>
<TE>   Before Brimah started a local HIV program in 1997, many HIV
patients in the Delta had to travel up to 90 miles to Jackson for
treatment.</TE>
<TE>   Brimah opened his clinic in 1997 with about 10 HIV-infected
patients. By September 2001, there were nearly 200.</TE>
<TE>   His efforts to care for his patients were bolstered in the last
year or so by a $1-million grant from the U.S. Department of Health
and Human Services to provide primary care services for low-income
people living with HIV.</TE>
<TE>   Brimah is survived by his wife and two children.</TE>

giving it enough weight to force change in existing public schools.
It operates seven, all in Northern California, and had planned to
open two more next fall without the gift. Aspire was founded in 1998
by a former Northern California school superintendent, Don Shalvey,
and Silicon Valley entrepreneur Reed Hastings, now the president of
the State Board of Education.</LD>
<LD>   Charters are publicly funded schools that are held exempt from
some regulations in an effort to spur innovation.</LD>
<TE>   The money from the Broad Foundation, whose stated mission is to
improve urban public education, reflects a growing emphasis on
creating networks of charter schools. The goal is to heighten the
impact of charter innovations and to provide better financial
management.</TE>
<TE>   In recent years, the emphasis on scale has increased as California
and other states have adopted additional regulations for charter
schools. Hastings and Broad have supported such lawmaking as a way to
weed out poorly performing charter schools that could discredit the
movement. But the operators of some smaller charter schools complain
that they must add campuses and create greater economies of scale to
cover the costs of complying with more regulations.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to bet on Aspire," Broad said Tuesday. "You need more
professional back office and other management in charter schools.
It's just more efficient if you have scale."</TE>
<TE>   His foundation's $4.7-million donation is expected to help Aspire
start schools in Oakland, Sacramento, Stockton and East Palo Alto.
The money is the first installment in a $10.5-million grant, the rest
of which will go to four to six charter organizations seeking to
expand over the next three years, a Broad official said.</TE>
<TE>   "Eli has been incredible in his support," Shalvey said. "Starting
schools is expensive, and this will help tremendously with onetime
start-up costs."</TE>
<TE>   Asked why a school with prominent backers such as Hastings might
need more financial support, Shalvey said: "Our philanthropy is based
entirely around new schools." Day to day, he added, "we're running on
the margins just like anybody else."</TE>

<HD>Chuck Davey, 77; Boxer With Clean-Cut Image Was Brief
Sensation on Early TV</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Springer</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Chuck Davey, a former welterweight boxer whose handsome face and
squeaky-clean image made him one of television's first sports stars
when the medium was in its infancy half a century ago, died Dec. 4 at
77.</LD>
<LD>   Davey, who had been paralyzed since breaking his neck in a 1998
body surfing accident off the coast of Costa Rica, died at his
Birmingham, Mich., home.</LD>
<LD>   In a sport in which participants often found as many fights and as
much trouble outside the ring as they did within, where vocabularies
were liberally sprinkled with references to dem and dos, the
clean-cut, articulate Davey was a brief sensation.</LD>
<TE>   Born Charles Pierce Davey in Detroit, he not only became a college
graduate, a rare achievement for a boxer, but stayed on at Michigan
State to pursue a master's degree while also pursuing opponents in
the ring. Davey eventually received the degree in school
administration.</TE>
<TE>   Behind the brains, there was plenty of brawn. Using a southpaw
style that often confused and frustrated opponents, Davey won an NCAA
title as a freshman after entering Michigan State at 17. After four
years of duty in World War II, he returned and won three more NCAA
championships, finishing his amateur career with 93 victories in 94
fights.</TE>
<TE>   Today, such a record would immediately catapult a fighter into the
spotlight, promoters waving millions under his nose with promises of
immediate exposure and title shots soon to follow. But in those days,
with only one title in each weight division and a long waiting list,
fighters often worked the brutal craft for years in obscurity,
sometimes never getting a big opportunity.</TE>
<TE>   Davey got his in 1952 after going 30-0-1. He was signed to fight
on television against former lightweight champion Ike Williams, who
had moved up to welterweight.</TE>
<TE>   "I was scared," Davey later told The Times. "I was nervous, and I
knew this might be my one chance to make some money in boxing."</TE>
<TE>   Until that chance came along, Davey had been considering
retirement. Instead, he beat Williams on a fifth-round knockout.</TE>
<TE>   As Davey continued to ply his trade on TV, the audience learned
that he called his mother after every fight, was a regular churchgoer
and didn't smoke or drink.</TE>
<TE>   A star was born.</TE>
<TE>   He went on to beat Rocky Graziano and get a draw and a decision
against Carmine Basilio.</TE>
<TE>   In 1953 Davey fought the match for which he is most remembered, a
welterweight title fight against Kid Gavilan, the Cuban star. Davey
was a 3-1 underdog and, as it turned out, rightfully so. Gavilan
knocked him down three times in the ninth round; Davey didn't come
out for the 10th.</TE>
<TE>   He fought once in Los Angeles, losing to Art Aragon in 1954,
before retiring later that year after having suffered four of his
five career defeats in his final five fights. Davey wound up with a
40-5-2 record, including 26 knockouts.</TE>
<TE>   After he had hung up his gloves, a United Press International
story summed up his career in a harsh light: "Davey, the wavy-haired
welterweight from Michigan State, wound up as a victim of the
instrument that made him -- television. Until another one like him
comes along, Davey will be remembered as the horrible example of a TV
buildup. The truth came as quite a shock when it was proved that
Chuck wasn't as good as he looked on the picture box."</TE>
<TE>   Davey went on to become a millionaire in the insurance business, a
Michigan boxing commissioner and the president of the U.S. Boxing
Assn.</TE>
<TE>   He is survived by his wife, Pat, nine children and 25
grandchildren.</TE>

<HD>Davis Rules Out Presidential Bid in 2004</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Gregg Jones</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Gov. Gray Davis flatly ruled out Tuesday a race for the presidency in
2004, citing California's budget problems and his desire to "leave
this state better off than I found it."</LD>
<LD>   Davis previously had seemed to leave the door open to a
presidential bid by avoiding a declaration that he wouldn't be a
candidate in 2004.</LD>
<LD>   But under friendly questioning by political commentators Pat
Buchanan and Bill Press on MSNBC, Davis explicitly took his name out
of contention for the Democratic presidential nomination.</LD>
<TE>   Press, who served with Davis in the administration of Democratic
Gov. Jerry Brown during the late 1970s, noted the wide-open field for
the Democratic nomination and asked the governor if he was going to
run.</TE>
<TE>   "No, I'm not going to run, Bill," Davis said. "I think you're just
trying to make my 79-year-old mother happy."</TE>
<TE>   Davis added: "I'm not running. As you can tell from our earlier
discussion [about the budget], we have our hands full in California
and I want to leave this state better off than I found it."</TE>
<TE>   "Is that a 'never,' Pat, you think?" Press said.</TE>
<TE>   That prompted Buchanan to push Davis further: "Was that a Sherman,
governor?" -- a reference to the unequivocal statement by former Gen.
William Tecumseh Sherman when he took his name out of consideration
in a post-Civil War presidential campaign.</TE>
<TE>   "That was a Sherman in 2004," Davis said.</TE>
<TE>   Davis wasn't asked about his availability as a vice presidential
running mate for the eventual Democratic nominee.</TE>
<TE>   Just last month, a day after securing another four years as
governor with a narrow victory over Republican challenger Bill Simon
Jr., Davis seemed to keep his presidential options open. He responded
to a question about his presidential plans by saying: "All I'm going
say is I have one goal, which is to leave California a better place.
I'm devoting my energies to that."</TE>
<TE>   In reaching his decision not to run, Davis may have been
influenced by the unhappy experiences of two contemporaries: Brown
and former Republican Gov. Pete Wilson, both of whom failed in
attempts to run for president while serving as California governor.</TE>
<TE>   Davis may also have been influenced by his sagging support among
California voters. In a Times election exit poll, 60% of voters said
they had an unfavorable impression of Davis and 61% disapproved of
his job performance.</TE>
<TE>   Leading Democrats and political strategists said Davis made the
right call by choosing to focus his energies on his second term as
governor -- especially with the state facing a budget crisis of
historic proportions.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the worst fiscal crisis this state has ever experienced
in modern times," said Assembly Speaker Herb Wesson (D-Culver City).
"I'm glad to hear the governor acknowledge the importance of this
crisis and his commitment to stay with California to see us through
this crisis."</TE>
<TE>   Democratic political consultant Darry Sragow said Davis was wise
to take a pass on a 2004 presidential race.</TE>
<TE>   "He's got his hands full in California," Sragow said. "Any
suggestion that he was looking at anything other than solving our
immediate problems would have been greeted rather unkindly by the
voters and probably the folks he has to work with in Sacramento."</TE>
<TE>   How Davis performs in the struggle to cope with a budget shortfall
projected at more than $21 billion could determine his future
viability as a presidential candidate.</TE>
<TE>   "If he solves the problems in California, then he deserves a good
look" as a Democratic presidential candidate in 2008, Sragow said.</TE>
<TE>   Davis' chief political advisor, Garry South, was out of the
country and unavailable for comment.</TE>

<HD>Desert Hospital Still Struggling, County Reports</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Richard Fausset</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>High Desert Hospital has been unable to meet its financial goals
halfway through a six-month effort designed to prevent the county-run
facility from being downgraded to an outpatient clinic, according to
a new report.</LD>
<LD>   Facing a countywide budget crunch, the county Board of Supervisors
voted in August to eliminate the hospital's inpatient services --
treatment for serious problems that require a stay of more than 24
hours.</LD>
<LD>   Since then, the 75-bed Lancaster hospital has tried to make up for
the $10 million in yearly cuts by contracting out beds to private
medical groups, other hospitals and the state Department of
Corrections, which runs the nearby state prison in Lancaster.</LD>
<TE>   The report was issued Dec. 5 by Thomas Garthwaite, director of the
county Department of Health Services. It found that the facility is
struggling to attract needed revenue from private medical groups and
has been unable to reach an agreement with the Corrections
Department.</TE>
<TE>   Hospital officials could not be reached Tuesday for comment. But
Norm Hickling, a field deputy for county Supervisor Michael
Antonovich, said the report held out hope that the hospital could
reach its goals by the time the experiment ends in February.</TE>
<TE>   "It's going slower than we hoped, but this actually shows good
signs of progress," said Hickling, a former health-care executive and
a member of the advisory board that crafted the hospital's plan.</TE>
<TE>   "I think in a lot of ways it's a brand new way of working. It's
the private sector understanding the needs of the county and the
county understanding the needs of the private sector," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Hospital officials hoped contracts with private medical groups
would bring in $4 million yearly, or $333,000 per month over the
course of the program. But the hospital brought in only a little more
than $100,000 in September and again in October, the report said.
Statistics for November were not available when the report was
written, Hickling said.</TE>
<TE>   The hospital also seeks to earn $5.6 million a year by treating
inmates. A separate wing would treat as many as 50 inmates at a time
from the high-security prison, Hickling said.</TE>
<TE>   But the report said the offer from the Corrections Department was
"less than the amount required to offset the cost of operating the
beds." Corrections officials also want all but the most serious
medical problems to be treated within prison walls.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a question of cost, and a question of safety and security,"
corrections spokesman Russ Heimerich said.</TE>
<TE>   Antelope Valley officials who have been trying to save the
hospital are concerned about the effect of the cutbacks on an
estimated 25% of Antelope Valley residents lacking health insurance.
High Desert offered such patients free or nearly free hospital care.</TE>
<TE>   Officials are also concerned about dwindling health-care choices
in the fast-growing but geographically isolated suburbs. The area's
population grew by about 27%, to 318,000, in the last decade when two
of the area's five hospitals closed.</TE>

<KH>TIMES HOLIDAY FUND</KH>
<HD>Agency Helps Children in Poor Areas</HD>
<DH>Camp Fire USA offers day-care and after-school programs in
Ventura County. Past donations have been used for books.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>William Overend</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>More than in many other counties, the Camp Fire USA program in
Ventura County has changed dramatically over the last two decades.</LD>
<LD>   Members no longer meet routinely at a parent's home as they did in
the days of Ozzie and Harriet. Few go on official camping outings.
Most lack uniforms and can't afford the $14 T-shirts that are
available to them.</LD>
<LD>   There simply isn't enough money for those things.</LD>
<TE>   But Executive Director Marsha DeWitt is an optimist, and she is
pushing for more family and community involvement.</TE>
<TE>   "I think today's program offers opportunities for kids to explore
lots of areas," she said in her Oxnard office. "There's a lot more
linkage to their learning now."</TE>
<TE>   The Ventura County program largely consists of building self
esteem, anti-drug education, and a day-care program at five schools
in some of the county's poorest areas.</TE>
<TE>   Camp Fire USA-Ventura County Council provided day-care services
for 312 children during the past year at Bard and Hueneme Elementary
schools in Port Hueneme, and at Saticoy Elementary School in Ventura
and Rio Plaza Elementary School in El Rio.</TE>
<TE>   The program also served 511 children in an after-school program at
McAuliffe Elementary School in Oxnard.</TE>
<TE>   DeWitt says she uses any funds she receives these days on
essentials. A $5,000 Los Angeles Times Holiday Campaign grant was
used exclusively for books and bookshelves.</TE>
<TE>   "Books were our greatest need," she said. "It would be great to
get donations for uniforms and T-shirts. Computers would be
wonderful.</TE>
<TE>   "But I try to ask for money I'm sure everybody can benefit from."</TE>
<TE>   During this holiday season, The Times is featuring charitable
organizations in Southern California that benefited from its 2001
fund-raising appeal. More than 50 agencies shared the $653,000 raised
last year.</TE>
<TE>   Every dollar raised, plus matching gifts from the McCormick
Tribune Foundation, goes directly to the charities; The Times and the
Foundation absorb all administrative costs.</TE>
<TE>   For the Ventura Camp Fire group, money has been a problem since
the 1980s, DeWitt said. At that time, the program was changing. First
it was Camp Fire Girls. Then it became Camp Fire Boys and Girls. And
now Camp Fire USA.</TE>
<TE>   Along the way, Camp Fire clubs meeting regularly in homes simply
disappeared, DeWitt said. But she has hopes for a gradual comeback of
the old days.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a mother in Camarillo who is home-schooling her daughter,
and she started a club in her house last year," DeWitt said. "It
started with one girl. Now there are two. So that's doubling the
population in a year. We want to do more."</TE>

<HD>Airport Plan OKd by O.C., Newport</HD>
<DH>Officials seek FAA approval to add gates and passengers at
John Wayne. Overall restrictions would be extended to 2015.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Dan Weikel</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Attempting to balance community concerns over noise with federal law,
the Orange County Board of Supervisors and the Newport Beach City
Council on Tuesday adopted a plan to add six gates and increase the
passenger cap at John Wayne Airport to 10.8 million people a year by
2011.</LD>
<LD>   If approved by the Federal Aviation Administration, the agreement
will modify and extend a landmark court settlement reached in 1985
that established noise limits, restricted the hours of airport
operation and limited passenger volume to 8.4 million a year. The
settlement, which ended a lawsuit over airport noise brought by
Newport Beach and community groups, expires in 2005.</LD>
<LD>   The revisions approved Tuesday would extend the settlement's terms
until 2015 and increase the number of gates from 14 to 20. The
maximum number of commercial flights would be raised from 73 to 85
per day.</LD>
<TE>   The proposed changes to the settlement must be approved by the
FAA, which enforces the Airport Noise and Capacity Act of 1990. The
law prohibits local government from restricting airport activity and
would go into effect if the court settlement expires in 2005.</TE>
<TE>   Newport Beach, the county and airlines that operate at John Wayne
Airport have asked the FAA to determine if the proposed passenger cap
and gate additions comply with the federal law. FAA officials say
they will release their opinion in a few weeks.</TE>

<HD>Long Beach Memorial Nurses OK Union Pact</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Registered nurses at Long Beach Memorial Medical Center voted
overwhelmingly Tuesday to ratify a tentative contract that provides
an average 21% wage increase over three years and improves retirement
benefits.</LD>
<LD>   The agreement, hammered out Sunday by negotiators for the hospital
and the California Nurses Assn., is the first for Long Beach
Memorial's 1,300 registered nurses, who began negotiations with the
hospital in February and staged two one-day strikes this fall.</LD>
<LD>   The vote was 782 in favor and 44 against accepting the agreement,
union officials said.</LD>
<TE>   "It's a great day for nursing in Southern California," said David
Johnson, a union spokesman.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to pay raises, the nurses will receive increased
retirement benefits and a greater say in staffing and workplace
issues.</TE>
<TE>   The contract settlement is part of a push to organize hospital
nurses in Southern California, where most registered nurses have not
belonged to a union.</TE>
<TE>   One of five hospitals run by Memorial Health Services, Long Beach
Memorial has 741 beds and, after Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, is the
second largest privately operated hospital in the West.</TE>

<HD>Pacific Palisades Woman Gets Into a Hairy Situation Over
Dog's Prescription</HD>

<LD>Marilyn Stein of Pacific Palisades needed a medicine for her dog
Sammy, but her vet didn't have it. So she was referred to a
drugstore. When she went to pick up the prescription, the clerk said,
"Let me get the pharmacist."</LD>
<LD>   The pharmacist, who was very busy, didn't notice that the
prescription was for a "Sammy Canine Stein." He told Marilyn Stein
that Sammy shouldn't drink booze or operate any heavy machinery while
on the medication.</LD>
<LD>   Stein tried to point out that Sammy was a pooch, but the
distracted pharmacist apparently didn't hear her, for he also told
her that Sammy had to take his medicine with food.</LD>
<TE>   "Dog food?" Stein asked.</TE>
<TE>   The pharmacist didn't answer, possibly having concluded that Sammy
belonged to a strange family.</TE>
<TE>   From dogs to lawyers: A category of items at a swap meet caught
the eye of Alex Baker of Upland (see accompanying). I'd check with
the spouse before bringing one home.</TE>
<TE>   Speaking of questionable purchases: On a trip to Turkey, Jack and

spoofing the claims of some sidewalk peddlers (see photo).</TE>
<TE>   What's in a name: Well! A. Forsythe of Westminster observes that

<TE>   Food for thought: Emily Whiteman of Culver City noticed a one-stop
shopping area for people who don't take care of their teeth (see
photo).</TE>
<TE>   Hitting bottom: A robbery suspect barricaded himself in an
apartment in Paramount, prompting L.A. County sheriff's deputies to
use tear gas. The suspect was eventually found huddled in the
bathroom, dripping wet, the city's action-packed newsletter reported.</TE>
<TE>   "In an effort to wash off the gas," the newsletter said, "the
suspect kept putting his head in the toilet and flushing."</TE>
<TE>   Unclear on the concept: I'm tired of hearing about Replay TV, a
new system that records programs and automatically skips over
commercials.</TE>
<TE>   Yes, the company repeats, no more annoying commercials on your
tapes. I just wish I didn't have to keep hearing about it on the
company's radio commercials.</TE>

no hurry to coach in the pros: "I like money, but I really like
coaching kids who make less money than I do."</TE>

<HD>Regular Discipline Failed, Dad Testifies</HD>
<DH>Yorba Linda man charged with child abuse says he got
nowhere using traditional methods on his willful teenage son.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Stuart Pfeifer</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Speaking publicly for the first time about the child-abuse charges he
and his wife face, a Los Angeles County sheriff's sergeant testified
Tuesday that his son was a defiant troublemaker whose behavior
merited extreme discipline.</LD>
<LD>   Grady Machnick told a jury of seven men and five women -- many
themselves parents -- that he and his wife started with traditional
discipline steps such as "timeouts" before eventually resorting to
more serious punishment for repeated stealing and lying.</LD>
<LD>   "He refused to do simple chores.... He would not respond to
anything," the sergeant told jurors in Orange County Superior Court
in Newport Beach.</LD>
<TE>   Machnick, 46, and his wife, a former Walnut elementary school
principal, are charged with misdemeanor child abuse and felony
conspiracy for a host of unconventional discipline steps, including
sending the boy to school with dog droppings in his backpack. The
action occurred when the boy was between ages 12 and 14. He is now
16.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors call the Yorba Linda couple's actions premeditated
psychological cruelty. They acknowledged that the son sometimes
misbehaved but said that the misbehavior didn't warrant the treatment
he received from his parents.</TE>
<TE>   But Machnick said it was a desperate form of tough love aimed at
setting straight a wayward son.</TE>
<TE>   The sergeant, a 23-year veteran assigned to the Men's Central
Jail, said his son's behavior was so troubling -- he ignored his
chores, stole money and shouted profanity -- that it reminded him of
the inmates he encountered at work.</TE>
<TE>   Before turning to extreme discipline, Machnick said, he tried
positive reinforcement. He said that when the boy was about 12 he
offered his son tickets to the movies or Knott's Berry Farm as a
reward for completing chores on his own.</TE>
<TE>   When his son's misbehavior continued, Machnick said, he sent his
son to a 10-day Marine Corps summer camp, hoping to instill
self-confidence and discipline. When his son returned, Machnick said,
he didn't notice any changes.</TE>
<TE>   The boy was later caught shoplifting at a nearby supermarket, the
father said. He admitted selling stolen candy at school on a routine
basis.</TE>
<TE>   After two $100 bills ended up missing from his wife's dresser in
2001, Machnick said, he searched his son's room and found a box for a
new CD player and a receipt showing it had been purchased with $200
cash.</TE>
<TE>   Machnick said he decided not to leave his son home alone with his
wife. On many mornings, the sergeant would wake his son at 3:30 a.m.
before he left for work and force him into the backyard.</TE>
<TE>   If the boy needed to use the bathroom, he would often walk to a
neighborhood park. Machnick said he saw nothing dangerous about a
young teen using a park bathroom at night or sleeping outside, using
dog blankets and pillows.</TE>
<TE>   Machnick said it was his wife's decision to place dog droppings in
his son's backpack before school -- his punishment for failing to
clean up after the family dogs.</TE>
<TE>   When the boy started failing algebra during his freshman year at
El Dorado High School, the parents decided jointly that they would
force him to stay in the backyard until he finished his homework. "I
said, 'You're out here. Get your math done and you can come back in
the house,' " Machnick testified.</TE>
<TE>   Then, in spring 2001, the boy missed an afternoon curfew by
several hours. Machnick said he was so upset that he returned from
work and poured water on his son's face while the boy slept on the
patio.</TE>
<TE>   That night, the boy ran away to a friend's house, where he stayed
until the friend's parents contacted police. Prosecutors filed
charges against the parents in September 2001. The boy is now living
with his friend's parents, who are now serving as foster parents.</TE>
<TE>   If convicted of both offenses, the Machnicks could face up to
three years in prison.</TE>
<TE>   Closing arguments in the case are scheduled for today.</TE>

<HD>Retired Priest Is Accused of Sexual Abuse</HD>
<DH>He is the sixth cleric in recent months to be arrested on
suspicion of child molestation.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Richard Winton</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A retired Roman Catholic priest was arrested Tuesday for allegedly
sexually abusing two boys at a Pacoima church, bringing to six the
number of clerics booked for child molestation in Los Angeles County
in recent months.</LD>
<LD>   Father George Michael Miller, 64, was taken into custody at his
home in Oxnard. Miller, who retired from the priesthood in 1997, was
held in lieu of $500,000 bail.</LD>
<LD>   The investigation began in May, when a man reported he had been
sexually assaulted by Miller while serving as an altar boy at
Guardian Angel Church.</LD>
<TE>   In June, a second man told Los Angeles Police Department
detectives that Miller molested him as a child in the 1970s and '80s
when he attended the same church.</TE>
<TE>   "We believe there are other victims of George Miller out there and
we'd encourage them to contact us immediately," said LAPD Lt. Daniel
Mulrenin.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the fifth arrest of a priest by the department this year,
and it won't be the last. There are many other cases under
investigation."</TE>
<TE>   A sixth priest was arrested in September by the Los Angeles County
Sheriff's Department.</TE>
<TE>   Miller was pastor of Guardian Angel from 1973 to 1984, when he was
transferred to Santa Clara Church in Oxnard. Investigators allege
that he abused victims in the rectory, at a beach house and at their
homes.</TE>
<TE>   Officials for the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles said
Miller was forced to retire in 1997 after an allegation that he
sexually abused a minor.</TE>
<TE>   Archdiocese spokesman Tod Tamberg said the archdiocese is
committed to the healing of victims of sexual abuse by the clergy.</TE>
<TE>   "No priest who has been found to have abused a minor will ever be
reassigned to the ministry, period," he said. "We will continue to
cooperate with authorities in the investigation of allegations of
abuse."</TE>
<TE>   Miller's attorney, Donald Steier, said his client is innocent and
lacks the resources to make bail.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors said they expect to file charges Wednesday against
Miller. He may face as many as 20 counts involving the alleged
victims.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors have already charged five current or former Los
Angeles priests with child molestation.</TE>
<TE>   Former priest Carlos Rodriguez, 37, of Commerce was charged with
molesting an altar boy from 1985 to 1987 when he served at St.
Vincent de Paul Church.</TE>
<TE>   In September, the Coast Guard plucked retired priest G. Neville
Rucker, 82, of Los Angeles from a cruise ship bound for Russia and
brought him to Los Angeles, where he is awaiting trial on charges
that he molested 10 girls over a 30-year period dating to 1946.</TE>
<TE>   Two more priests were arrested last month in Texas and Illinois at
the request of the LAPD.</TE>
<TE>   Matthew Michael Sprouffske, 75, was arrested in Darien, Ill., and
has been charged with four felonies. He denied that he molested a
female relative during the 1950s while he served as a Los Angeles
priest, and is fighting extradition.</TE>
<TE>   John Anthony Salazar was charged last month with sexually
assaulting a male student at St. Bernard High School and an altar boy
at St. Teresita Church in Los Angeles from 1980 to 1983. He was
arrested last week in Amarillo, Texas, and is not fighting
extradition.</TE>
<TE>   Former priest Michael Stephen Baker, 54, was arrested by sheriff's
deputies Sept. 25 and has pleaded not guilty to 29 counts of child
molestation.</TE>
<TE>   Also on Wednesday, a Los Angeles man sued the Archdiocese of Los
Angeles, alleging that he was molested from 1969 to 1978 by a now
deceased priest, Clinton Hagenbach. The alleged victim, Steven
Sanchez, said at a news conference that he had been scarred for life.</TE>
<TE>   The suit, seeking unspecified damages, alleges the church was
negligent in its supervision of the priest. Jeffrey Anderson, one of
Sanchez's attorneys, alleged that church officials must have known of
the molestation.</TE>
<TE>   Both sides said the archdiocese paid a brother of Sanchez $1.5
million in June after he made similar allegations of molestation
against the same priest.</TE>

<HD>Stan Rice, 60; Poet, Painter Encouraged Wife to Write</HD>

<LD>Stan Rice, a painter, educator and award-winning poet content to be
the wind beneath the wings of his best-selling novelist wife Anne and
their novelist son Christopher, has died. He was 60.</LD>
<LD>   Rice, who encouraged his wife to begin her string of vampire
horror novels, died of brain cancer Monday in New Orleans.</LD>
<LD>   The first published author in the family, Stan Rice released his
seventh volume of poetry, "Red to the Rind," earlier this year. He
published a coffee-table book of reproductions of his artwork in 1997
titled simply "Paintings."</LD>
<TE>   In reviewing "Red to the Rind" for the Kansas City Star a few
weeks ago, John Mark Eberhart wrote that Rice "is now the least-known
writer in the family ... but may be the best writer in this New
Orleans coven of three. His poetry is visceral and intellectual,
disturbing and comforting, macabre and life-seeking."</TE>
<TE>   Eberhart described the first poem in the book, "Behold," as "a
beautifully disturbing little creature that seems innocuous enough at
first ... mov[ing] from the mundane motif of insomnia into the domain
of [Rice's] own wickedly vivid imagination."</TE>
<TE>   The 11-line poem states:</TE>
<TE>   People wake up in the middle of the night.</TE>
<TE>   No, not in the middle ... Deep in their brains.</TE>
<TE>   They know the present, the little braveries.</TE>
<TE>   We lock our doors from the inside.</TE>
<TE>   We want to be delivered.</TE>
<TE>   We want the patience of mirrors.</TE>
<TE>   We want not to be torn in two by a brown river.</TE>
<TE>   We want the courage to dive</TE>
<TE>   Off the high board into human eyes.</TE>
<TE>   Behold the door.</TE>
<TE>   The lock's alive.</TE>
<TE>   The careers of the Rices were as entwined as their lives. He
credited her with inspiring his painting "The Flying Pig" by buying
him a large winged pig and hanging it from the ceiling of his studio.
In the biography "Prism of the Night," she was quoted calling her
husband "a model to me of a man who doesn't look to heaven or hell to
justify his feelings about life itself. His capacity for action is
admirable." He wrote poems as chapter introductions for her 1988
novel "Queen of the Damned."</TE>
<TE>   Born in Dallas, Stan Rice met Anne O'Brien in their high school
journalism class when he edited their school paper. They married Oct.
14, 1961, when she was 20 and he was a month shy of 19.</TE>
<TE>   The couple moved to the campus of San Francisco State University,
which was to be their creative crucible, until 1988. They then
relocated to New Orleans, where he opened the Stan Rice Gallery.</TE>
<TE>   After he earned his bachelor's and master's degrees, Rice became
the family breadwinner, teaching English and creative writing at San
Francisco State beginning in 1965, and eventually heading its
department of creative writing from 1980 until 1988.</TE>
<TE>   Anne Rice, who studied political science at San Francisco State
and later literary criticism at UC Berkeley, worked as a waitress,
cook, theater usher and insurance claims adjuster and in 1966 gave
birth to their first child, Michelle.</TE>
<TE>   It was Michelle's death from leukemia six years later that
propelled both Rices into becoming published authors. He published
his first book of poems, based on his tiny daughter's death and
titled it "Some Lamb" in 1975.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, he encouraged his wife to abandon her odd jobs
and write full-time, resulting in her first novel "Interview With the
Vampire" published in 1976.</TE>
<TE>   His second volume of poetry, "Whiteboy" (1976), earned the Edgar
Allen Poe award from the Academy of American Poets.</TE>
<TE>   His other books include "Body of Work" (1983), "Singing Yet: New
and Selected Poems" (1992), "Fear Itself" (1995) and "The Radiance of
Pigs" (1999) as well as "Paintings" in 1997 and this year's "Red to
the Rind."</TE>
<TE>   Among his other awards were a National Endowment for the Arts
grant and the Joseph Henry Jackson award from the San Francisco
Foundation. He had a one-man show of his paintings at Gallerie Simone
Stern in New Orleans in 1992.</TE>
<TE>   Over the years, Knopf, the publishing house that puts out Anne
Rice's books, became Stan Rice's publisher as well. In 1995,
Entertainment Weekly called the arrangement "the best kind of
nepotism: A deserving poet has found a home."</TE>
<TE>   His wife's books have sold more than 150 million copies around the
world. His didn't, and he didn't care.</TE>
<TE>   "I am committed to a vigorous and exciting poetry that can be read
aloud, that is not contemptuous of its audience, and yet makes no
compromise to mediocre taste or subject matter," he once told the
writers' anthology Contemporary Authors.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd very much like to ... claim again the ancient social role of
poetry as public language at its best."</TE>
<TE>   Rice also encouraged their son, Christopher, to keep writing
despite comparison with his famous mother. Christopher, an openly gay
writer, has published two novels, both with gay characters: "A
Density of Souls" in 2000 and "The Snow Garden" this year.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to his wife and son, Rice is survived by his mother,
Margaret Rice; a brother, Larry; and two sisters, Nancy Rice Diamond
and Cynthia Rice Rodgers.</TE>

<HD>Officials Testify to Fear of Robles</HD>
<DH>Two legislators take the stand at South Gate treasurer's
trial on alleged death threats.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Richard Marosi</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two state legislators testified Tuesday that they were so concerned
that South Gate Treasurer Albert Robles would carry out alleged death
threats against them that they feared for their families' safety and
thought twice about opposing him in the political arena.</LD>
<LD>   Sen. Martha Escutia (D-Whittier) said she has avoided South Gate
ever since Robles nearly two years ago allegedly threatened to rape
her and kill her husband. Escutia said she takes extra care entering
unfamiliar places, especially when accompanied by her children.</LD>
<LD>   "I feel very much like a sitting duck when I have my hands taken
up by children," said Escutia at Robles' trial at Norwalk Superior
Court. Although her district includes South Gate, Escutia said she
has visited the city only once in nearly two years.</LD>
<TE>   Assemblyman Marco Antonio Firebaugh (D-Los Angeles) said he
believed Robles is capable of violence and organizing a death plot.
The alleged threat, he said, was relayed to him through a friend, who
told him that Robles wished to take Firebaugh to Tijuana and shoot
him in the head.</TE>
<TE>   "It made me wonder whether it was worth being at odds with Albert,
being in politics," said Firebaugh, who resides in South Gate, a
working-class city in Southeast Los Angeles County.</TE>
<TE>   The legislators' testimony came on the second day of a trial where
prosecutors are trying to prove that Robles, 37, uttered criminal
threats against Firebaugh; Escutia; her husband, Leo Briones; and a
South Gate police lieutenant.</TE>
<TE>   If found guilty on the seven felony counts, Robles faces a
potential eight-year prison term.</TE>
<TE>   His attorneys portray the case as a political vendetta by the
lawmakers to get back at Robles, an outspoken opponent who once
called Escutia a "pig" on a TV newscast.</TE>
<TE>   His attorneys concede Robles' rhetoric can be crass, but said any
statements, even threats, should be taken in a political context.</TE>
<TE>   While on the stand, Escutia and Firebaugh largely avoided eye
contact with Robles, though Firebaugh did look over in his direction
a few times. Robles, dressed in a black business suit, showed no
emotion and conferred frequently with his attorneys.</TE>
<TE>   The legislators' testimony is considered key because prosecutors
must not only prove that the threats were made, but that they
prompted fear.</TE>
<TE>   Both Escutia and Firebaugh, under cross-examination by a Robles
defense attorney, Tom Brown, conceded that they weren't fearful on
the few occasions they encountered Robles in person, either at
fund-raisers or parties. They claimed the public settings put them at
ease.</TE>
<TE>   Firebaugh also admitted that he was reluctant to report the
alleged threats to police because he didn't want to be perceived as a
victim. But Robles' alleged threats were taken seriously enough by
authorities that state security teams were assigned to protect
Firebaugh. Escutia arranged for personal bodyguards.</TE>
<TE>   The legislators portrayed South Gate as a tough city where name
calling and insults come with the territory, but Robles' behavior,
they said, crossed the line.</TE>
<TE>   "In politics, we hear a lot of bluster and people saying things,"
said Firebaugh, who added that the tenor of Robles' alleged
statements was something new and worrisome.</TE>
<TE>   "To my knowledge, no one has ever said that they wished to shoot
me in the head, not even in the most vitriolic of political fights,"
he said.</TE>

<LD>A resolution calling for a death penalty moratorium in California was
unanimously passed Tuesday by the Marin County Board of Supervisors.</LD>
<LD>   "We are asking for a suspension; a suspension does not mean
abolition," said Supervisor John Kress, who co-wrote the resolution.
He said the introduction of new technology has helped exonerate more
than 100 people on death row nationwide.</LD>

the use of a biblical phrase in class has gained both back.</LD>

<HD>County Reduces Vaccine Request</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Charles Ornstein</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles County health officials have pared their request to the
federal government for smallpox vaccine after refining their
preparations for possible bioterrorism.</LD>
<LD>   The county Department of Health Services this week asked for 9,190
doses of the vaccine, primarily for hospital emergency room workers.
Just one week ago, county health officials had said they would seek
up to 20,000 doses from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention.</LD>
<LD>   Dr. Laurene Mascola, chief of the county's acute communicable
disease control unit, said officials reduced their request after
talking with health officers from other states about their plans.</LD>
<TE>   Oregon and Georgia, for instance, are each asking for fewer than
1,000 doses. Michigan is seeking 5,000 to 7,000. California health
officials have requested 40,000 doses for areas outside Los Angeles
County.</TE>
<TE>   County health officials decided to expose as few people as
possible to the risks associated with the vaccine, including death,
Mascola said. In addition, vaccinating 20,000 people in the county
would have diverted limited public health resources from other
pressing activities.</TE>
<TE>   "Let's just vaccinate the minimal number of individuals to get the
job done," Mascola said. "The more people you vaccinate, the greater
the risk of adverse reactions."</TE>
<TE>   The smallpox virus, which is highly contagious, was eradicated
worldwide in the 1970s, but officials fear that vials of the virus
kept in storage in the former Soviet Union may have fallen into the
hands of Iraq or North Korea. The concern took on new urgency after
the terrorist attacks and anthrax scares last year.</TE>
<TE>   Those cut from the county's plan include 5,000 paramedics and
firefighters who respond to 911 calls. The county has said it will
request vaccine for them later. The health department also reduced
its suggested allocation of vaccine for hospitals.</TE>
<TE>   Previously, the county had planned to give doses to hospitals
based on size, with the largest receiving 300. Now, all hospitals
will be offered 100 doses, consistent with CDC recommendations.</TE>
<TE>   Before vaccinations begin, President Bush must give his approval.
The vaccinations would be voluntary.</TE>
<TE>   Some health groups said they are nervous that officials have not
done enough to protect the public from the risks of the vaccine.
Those most at risk for complications include people with HIV,
pregnant women and patients with eczema.</TE>
<TE>   "We're encouraging people not to volunteer unless better
safeguards are in place," said Christy Hawkins, a spokeswoman for the
Service Employees International Union, which includes health-care
workers among its members.</TE>

<HD>Defunct Company Fined in Oil Spill</HD>

<LD>A former Westlake Village trucking firm was ordered Tuesday to pay
more than $240,000 in damages, fines and cleanup costs in connection
with a fatal oil tanker crash that fouled 22 miles of streambeds in
western Ventura County two years ago.</LD>
<LD>   But state officials may never see a dime from defendant R.P.
Cummings Inc.</LD>
<LD>   Former owner and Chief Executive David Allen testified Tuesday
that the now-defunct company is teetering on bankruptcy as a result
of the crash, and has no assets or ability to pay damages.</LD>
<TE>   "It's gone. R.P. Cummings is destroyed," Allen said during a
sentencing hearing in Superior Court.</TE>
<TE>   Allen, 49, of Camarillo told Judge Donald Coleman that he cashed
retirement accounts and ran up credit cards to pay initial cleanup
costs and attorney fees.</TE>
<TE>   The crash occurred after an R.P. Cummings driver lost control of
the tanker truck on a steep grade near Santa Paula and crashed into a
rain-swollen ravine, spilling about 6,840 gallons of crude oil. The
driver, Patrick Hildebrand, 41, was killed.</TE>
<TE>   Two months after the crash, Allen said, the company's primary
client, a subsidiary of Enron Corp., pulled its contracts. Allen said
he was forced to shutter the business and lay off 15 employees.</TE>
<TE>   During a four-hour hearing, Deputy Dist. Atty. Karen Wold
presented evidence to show that the Feb. 28, 2000, crash and
resulting oil spill polluted miles of streambeds, killing at least
149 fish and threatening wildlife along Santa Paula Creek.</TE>
<TE>   A state Department of Fish and Game biologist testified that oil
was carried to the Pacific Ocean, posing a threat to the migration of
endangered steelhead trout.</TE>
<TE>   "There was a significant environmental disturbance," Wold said..</TE>
<TE>   And the trucking company should foot the $240,349 bill, she
contended. That sum includes $77,000 in habitat damages, $134,464 in
cleanup costs and a $2,700 state fine.</TE>
<TE>   Ventura attorney Robert McCord, who represents the trucking firm,
said the damages were inflated and impractical because the company
cannot pay them. McCord said the prosecution has shown no sensitivity
toward Allen or his predicament.</TE>
<TE>   "We seem to care a lot more about stickleback fish than people,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   But Judge Coleman ruled that R.P. Cummings, which pleaded guilty
to a Fish and Game code violation, should pay for damaging the
state's natural resources. The sentence, deemed a civil judgment,
means the state will likely become a debtor in bankruptcy
proceedings.</TE>

<HD>State GOP Censures Its Chief</HD>
<DH>He had threatened recall for any Republican lawmaker who
votes for tax hikes.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Nancy Vogel</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>The California Republican Party rebuked its own chairman Tuesday in
an unusual move that spotlights internal dissension and stirs the
budget fight building at the Capitol.</LD>
<LD>   The party's 20-member board of directors voted unanimously to
censure Chairman Shawn Steel. The vote came one day after Steel
threatened in a speech to the Sacramento Press Club to seek the
recall of any Republican legislator who voted to raise taxes to help
close the state's vast budget gap.</LD>
<LD>   In his speech, Steel also blamed big business for failing to
support Republican candidates, called for an elimination of some
corporate tax breaks and criticized Gerald Parsky, the White House's
top political advisor in California, for a poor Republican showing at
the polls last month. Republicans won no statewide elected offices in
the November election. They are badly outnumbered in the Legislature.</LD>
<TE>   Steel's pledge to oust any Republican lawmaker who endorsed tax
hikes was denounced by Assembly Speaker Herb J. Wesson Jr. (D-Culver
City), who insisted that a projected shortfall of more than $21
billion by the end of the 2003-04 fiscal year must be closed with
both spending cuts and increased revenue.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm appalled by Mr. Steel's comments," said Wesson. "Here we are
facing the most difficult crisis, fiscal crisis, that this state has
experienced in modern time and we would have this individual resort
to political thuggery and threaten to recall individuals for doing
their job."</TE>
<TE>   The board that voted to verbally reprimand Steel includes Parsky
and the Legislature's minority leaders, Assemblyman Dave Cox (R-Fair
Oaks) and Sen. Jim Brulte (R-Rancho Cucamonga). They asked that he
not articulate his personal opinions as party positions.</TE>
<TE>   "Cox and Brulte have been very clear that they oppose taxes," said
party spokesman Rob Stutzman. "But the chairman made an electoral
threat against members of their caucuses, which is essentially their
threat to make or not to make. That would be the rub."</TE>
<TE>   Steel said he will not seek reelection as chairman at a party
convention in February. He dismissed the rebuke as a "power move by
Parsky and Brulte."</TE>
<TE>   "They're attempting to censure the authorized spokesman of the
party and it will not work," Steel said. "What we need is to have
vigorous and honest debate."</TE>
<TE>   In his speech, Steel said, "If a Republican member who votes
against their caucus and votes for a tax increase, this party -- and
I will personally lead it -- will start an effort to recall that
person and he or she will be out of office in 180 days."</TE>
<TE>   Brulte issued a statement saying, "Mr. Steel's comments
notwithstanding, Senate Republicans have been saying for many months
that raising taxes on California consumers who are driving the
state's economic recovery, or on California businesses who are trying
to create more jobs for California workers, would only serve to
stifle economic growth and job creation."</TE>

<HD>Motorist Killed in Oxnard When Van Is Struck by Train</HD>
<DH>Despite warnings from witnesses, police say 66-year-old man
drove his vehicle under crossing gates as they were being lowered.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Metrolink commuter train slammed into a van at a busy Oxnard
intersection early Tuesday, killing the vehicle's driver and snarling
traffic for more than two hours.</LD>
<LD>   Archimedes Fernandez Fallejo, 66, of Oxnard died shortly after 6
a.m. when his Plymouth Voyager rolled under the lowering railroad
crossing gates and was hit by a train at Gonzalez Road and Oxnard
Boulevard, police said.</LD>
<LD>   Fallejo was pronounced dead at the scene. No passengers or crew
members on the Los Angeles-bound train were injured, officials said.</LD>
<TE>   Witnesses honked and screamed as the van slowly moved into the
train's path as the warning gates were being lowered, Oxnard Police
Sgt. Steve Moore said.</TE>
<TE>   One of the crossing arms struck the van, but the driver, seemingly
oblivious to the shouted warnings and the train bearing down on him,
continued to drive forward, police said.</TE>
<TE>   The train smashed into the right rear of the van, spinning it
around and badly mangling the vehicle. The doors were thrown off and
its back hatch landed on a sidewalk. The back seat was also blown out
by the impact.</TE>
<TE>   The crash occurred near Pacifica High School. Hundreds of students
headed to classes witnessed the aftermath.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't know why he crossed the tracks," said Sgt. Ron Whitney,
an Oxnard police traffic officer investigating the accident. "Maybe
he had a medical emergency or he fell asleep and his foot slipped off
the brake. I have seen people try to cheat and beat the arm. I have
seen all these scenarios."</TE>
<TE>   Railroad workers said the van had food on the passenger's seat,
and the driver may have been eating.</TE>
<TE>   Metrolink spokeswoman Sharon Gavin said the track speed limit in
that area is 79 mph. Police said the train was traveling about 60
mph.</TE>
<TE>   The accident shut down traffic on the east side of Oxnard
Boulevard for 2 1/2 hours. The train, which was not badly damaged,
was not moved for about two hours.</TE>
<TE>   The collision occurred about 10 minutes after the train left its
first stop at the new Montalvo station near Ventura.</TE>
<TE>   After the accident, Gavin said, four of the six Metrolink
passengers were taken by taxi back to Montalvo and the others took
Amtrak or the next Metrolink train to Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "We have not had an accident there before," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Metrolink trains have struck and killed at least two people in
Ventura County this year.</TE>
<TE>   In September, a Metrolink train hit a truck at an ungated crossing
north of Camarillo, killing the driver. In May, a man was killed when
he drove his car around a crossing arm in Simi Valley. And in March,
Metrolink trains hit a big-rig in Oxnard and a pickup in Somis. Both
drivers survived.</TE>

<HD>Ramps Yielding to Four-Legged Traffic</HD>
<DH>A Riverside Freeway exit and onramp will become an
underpass, allowing wildlife to access parts of Chino Hills State
Park.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>It was a twist on the slogan "Your highway dollars at work."</LD>
<LD>   While cars swamped the Riverside Freeway, Caltrans on Tuesday
turned its attention to a different kind of traffic -- the deer,
bobcats and foxes that wander the state parkland on both sides of the
highway.</LD>
<LD>   Caltrans crews are tearing up Coal Canyon Road freeway ramps in
Anaheim to replace them with a wildlife corridor that cuts under the
freeway.</LD>
<TE>   The pathway will allow wildlife to migrate between portions of
Chino Hills State Park now divided by traffic lanes.</TE>
<TE>   The wildlife corridor is considered the last viable crossing
between the parcels and is crucial for preserving a wide array of
animal life and vegetation, said Geary Hund, a resource ecologist for
the California Department of Parks and Recreation.</TE>
<TE>   Environmentalists consider the parkland one of the top 25
sensitive "hot spots" in the world because of the number of
endangered species of wildlife and vegetation.</TE>
<TE>   "This place is as diverse as the Amazon forest," Hund said. "We
have an exceptional number of species and a great extinction risk."</TE>
<TE>   But until the parks department bought property that had been
slated for development -- first a 1,400-acre parcel north of the
freeway in 2000 for $40 million and a 32-acre parcel south of the
freeway for $13.5 million six months later -- much of the wildlife
was cut off from one side of the range, limiting access to food and
mates.</TE>
<TE>   "We bought Coal Canyon two years ago to protect one of the last
remaining wildlife corridors," said Ruth Coleman, acting director of
the parks department.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, the project took flight once the state was convinced of
how important the concept of "linkage" was, said Claire
Schlotterbeck, an environmentalist hired by the Wildlands Conservancy
in 1995 to help find funds to buy the then-private property in the
middle of the state park.</TE>
<TE>   "Other groups still don't understand it," she said. "They pay it
lip service, but no other agency has bought into it, committed to it
like state parks."</TE>
<TE>   Without linkage, the habitat would be fragmented "into useless,
pathetic remnants."</TE>

<LD>   California Department of Transportation crews are tearing up the

<TE>   Without linkage, the habitat would be fragmented "into useless,
pathetic remnants."</TE>
<TE>   "We learned that if Coal Canyon was developed, there would be no
way for wildlife to get into Chino Hills," she said. "They would be
surrounded by a sea or urbanization and over time they would die
out."</TE>
<TE>   For example, she said, if the park's mountain lion population
declined from inbreeding, it would lead to a population explosion
among their natural prey, including opossums, raccoons and skunks.</TE>
<TE>   These animals prey on birds' eggs, so their population growth
would reduce the avian population.</TE>
<TE>   The corridor, which Caltrans hopes to complete by late March, is
considered an improvement on the narrow, dark tunnels -- essentially
water culverts -- developed several years ago that environmentalists
had hoped would give wildlife a way to cross under the freeway.</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately, Schlotterbeck said, the tunnels fell short because
some animals shied from them.</TE>
<TE>   "The cougar would use it, but he's not afraid of anything," she
said.</TE>
<TE>   "But the deer needs something that's tall and where they can see
the horizon," since a dark tunnel may hide a hungry mountain lion.</TE>
<TE>   She said the higher and wider corridor will "help the prey more
than the predator" because it gives them a clearer view of the
landscape.</TE>
<TE>   The corridor also highlights an unusual partnership between the
state parks department and Caltrans, which has "never removed an
interchange and converted it to a wildlife corridor," said Tony
Harris, chief deputy director of the state transit agency.</TE>
<TE>   Caltrans will spend about $440,000 on the project.</TE>
<TE>   "There are ways to enhance the environment, such as wildlife
crossings, and we're looking to do more across the state," Harris
said.</TE>

<LD>Mississippi State center Mario Austin was cleared to play Tuesday
after sitting out the team's first six games pending an NCAA ruling.</LD>
<LD>   The NCAA's Subcommittee on Initial Eligibility determined last
month that Austin was mistakenly declared eligible to play as a
freshman in 2000. The same committee reversed its decision after
reviewing additional information last week about Austin's high school
academic record.</LD>
<LD>   "We're very happy this situation worked out for Mario," Bulldog
Coach Rick Stansbury said.</LD>

<LD>The source of Chick Hearn's wit may have been his wife of 64 years.</LD>
<LD>   Marge Hearn was at a recent Pasadena Quarterback Club's awards
luncheon to present the group's Chick Hearn Award for broadcasting to
Keith Jackson.</LD>
<LD>   "Keith, I don't know you very well," Marge said, "but your name
was mentioned a lot around our house in recent years. You were quoted
in The Times, talking about retirement, and you said, 'Vin Scully is
going to go on forever, and as for Chick Hearn, well, they're just
going to have to shoot him.'</LD>
<TE>   "After that, whenever Chick would do something to upset me, I'd
say, 'Keith Jackson was right, I'm just going to have to shoot you.'
"</TE>
<TE>   Trivia time: Who holds the NBA record for free throws made in a
regulation game?</TE>
<TE>   Practice, practice: Magic Johnson was an above-average 78.5%
free-throw shooter as a freshman at Michigan State. He was a 91.1%
free-throw shooter by his 10th season in the NBA. Once asked by
Sports Illustrated how he did it, Johnson said, "I shoot 150 free
throws a day."</TE>
<TE>   Another example: Bill Sharman, in his book, "Sharman on
Basketball," writes that he was only a little above average as a
free-throw shooter through high school and his first two years at
USC. Then he got serious about practicing free throws and during his
junior year he never missed a free throw in 12 league games.</TE>
<TE>   Sharman's 56-year-old son Jerry says when he was a youngster in
Boston and would go to Celtic practices, his father sometimes
wouldn't leave until he had made 50 free throws in a row.</TE>
<TE>   "He'd get to 48 or 49, then miss and start all over," Jerry
Sharman says. "I just wanted to go home."</TE>
<TE>   Awards aplenty: USC's Carson Palmer is a finalist for the Heisman
Trophy, which will be presented on ESPN on Saturday at 5 p.m., and he
is also up for the Davey O'Brien National Quarterback Award, which is
to be presented Thursday on ESPN at 4 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   A question asked of some of the Heisman finalists: "If you
couldn't vote for yourself, who would you vote for as the top player
in college football this season?"</TE>
<TE>   Said Palmer: "I'm a quarterback, but I believe quarterbacks get
too much of the credit when you win and too much blame when you lose.
So I'll go with a running back, Larry Johnson of Penn State."</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: The record, 28, is shared by Wilt Chamberlain and
Adrian Dantley. Chamberlain was 28 for 32 when he scored 100 points
against the New York Knicks in 1962, and Dantley, when he was with
the Utah Jazz, made 28 of 29 against Houston in 1984.</TE>
<TE>   And finally: Jim Brown is profiled in a two-hour documentary on
HBO tonight. Raquel Welch, who had a sex scene with Brown in the 1969
movie "100 Rifles," talks about Brown as an actor.</TE>
<TE>   "Jim is not the ideal candidate for an actor, in my opinion,
because a long time ago somebody said to me that an actress is a
little bit more than a woman and an actor is a little bit less than a
man," she says. "See, because you need that little bit of femininity
in there, even if you are a he-man type. And Jim, really, as far as I
can see, has not got an ounce of femininity in him."</TE>

<HD>Mavericks Hotshots Again</HD>
<DH>Less than a week after debacle against Lakers, Dallas
marksmen take it out on Clippers, 122-95.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Elliott Teaford</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>DALLAS</DL>
<LD>The figures were staggering. The Dallas Mavericks shot 68.8%, made
71.4% of their three-point shots and 100% of their free throws during
a dizzying 42-point second-quarter sprint Tuesday that overwhelmed
the Clippers.</LD>
<LD>   The teams played the second half only because it says you must in
the NBA rule book. The only lingering question was what the final
score would be after the Mavericks built a 36-point lead in the third
quarter en route to a 122-95 romp over the Clippers that hushed the
doubters at the American Airlines Center after their 30-point
collapse Friday against the Lakers.</LD>
<LD>   "That thing in L.A. the other night with the Lakers," Clipper
Coach Alvin Gentry said. "That won't happen again. Ever."</LD>
<TE>   And the Mavericks did most of their damage Tuesday without their
best player, Dirk Nowitzki, who suffered a sprained right ankle after
teammate Popeye Jones fell on him with 2:58 remaining in the first
quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Nowitzki's status for tonight's game against the Spurs at San
Antonio was termed uncertain by Coach Don Nelson. He needed
assistance from the Mavericks' medical staff to reach the locker
room.</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers had lost Eric Piatkowski by then to a hip injury.</TE>
<TE>   His status for Friday's game against the Spurs also is uncertain.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll wait and see," Gentry said when asked about Piatkowski, who
had four points in six minutes.</TE>
<TE>   "They lose Dirk and here we are thinking he's their best player,
but they didn't miss a beat," power forward Elton Brand said after
the Clippers' three-game winning streak had ended. "They're
unstoppable when they shoot like that. They hit big shots. Shot after
shot."</TE>
<TE>   Asked if he had seen a team shoot the way the Mavericks did,
particularly from the perimeter, Brand said, "Never."</TE>
<TE>   One night after knocking off New Orleans and ending the Hornets'
11-game home winning streak to start the season, the Clippers seemed
bent on pestering the Mavericks and threatening to upend the league's
top team. The Clippers (9-13) were within 40-35 after Andre Miller
drove for a basket with 6:34 left in the half.</TE>
<TE>   Dallas (19-2) promptly went on a 28-10 run before halftime, making
five three-point baskets and turning the game into a rout.</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers were sent reeling, thanks in part to 17 points from
Dallas point guard Steve Nash and 13 from his backup, Nick Van Exel.</TE>
<TE>   With Piatkowski out, the Clippers had no answer for the Mavericks'
outside shooting. Dallas played a collapsing zone defense,
challenging the other Clippers to beat them from long range.</TE>
<TE>   Brand had 20 points and 10 rebounds in 30 minutes, his 18th
double-double and his seventh game in a row with 20 or more points.
But he didn't play in the fourth quarter, leaving garbage time to the
reserves.</TE>
<TE>   Quentin Richardson had 16 points and 10 rebounds as his progress
from a sprained right knee that sidelined him for most of training
camp continues. Wang Zhizhi, a former Maverick, added nine points in
19 minutes, entering the game to a chorus of boos and a recorded
ringing of a gong. Wang would later chuckle and say he had no problem
with the sound effect.</TE>
<TE>   Otherwise, it was a night to marvel at the Mavericks.</TE>
<TE>   "That second quarter really put us behind," Brand said. "I don't
think there will be too many Laker miracles any more. I think they're
going to try to protect big leads. I'm sure they got a lecture for
that one, but I was hoping we could do something."</TE>
<TE>   The Mavericks slowed significantly after outscoring the Clippers
by 42-24 in the second quarter. Van Exel and Michael Finley scored 24
points apiece. Nash added 17 and center Shawn Bradley had scored 13
by game's end.</TE>
<TE>   Dallas made 43 of 81 shots (53.1%), 14 of 24 three-pointers
(58.3%) and 22 of 24 free throws (91.7%). The Clippers' totals were
36-for-88 shooting (40.9%), four for 18 on three-pointers (22.2%) and
19 for 24 at the line (79.2%).</TE>
<TE>   "They are a great offensive team," Gentry said of the Mavericks.
"When they shoot the ball like that, they are impossible to beat."</TE>

<LD>   What: "The Junction Boys"</LD>
<TE>   Where: ESPN, Saturday, 6 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   Paul "Bear" Bryant held a 10-day summer training camp in the tiny
Texas town of Junction in 1954, his first year as coach at Texas A&amp;M.
It was so tough that 65 of 100 players who tried out quit the team.
Day-long workouts were held in temperatures that often reached 114
degrees, and Bryant worked his troops until they dropped --
literally.</TE>
<TE>   This much-hyped, independently produced original movie, adapted
from a best-selling book by Jim Dent, tells the story of that camp. A
plus for "The Junction Boys" is the job Tom Berenger does portraying
Bear Bryant.</TE>
<TE>   However, as is customary in Hollywood, the producers chose to
stray from the facts. Bryant is real, and so is his crusty,
hard-drinking trainer, Smokey Harper, aptly played by Nick Tate. But
three of the key players -- or in this case, survivors -- are
fictional. Skeet Keeler, Claude Gearheart and Johnny Haynes never
existed. The producers call them composite characters.</TE>
<TE>   Dennis Goehring, Jack Pardee and Gene Stallings are among the real
Aggie players who went to that camp, but their names are never
mentioned.</TE>
<TE>   Another problem that hurts the movie's credibility: The movie
opens with Bryant headed to a 25-year reunion of that 1954 team.
While flying to the reunion, he has a flashback to the training camp.</TE>
<TE>   At the end of the movie, it's 1979 again and Bryant has arrived at
the reunion. Keeler, Gearheart and Haynes are there, but the actors
portraying them barely resemble those who'd played them as young men.</TE>
<TE>   It would have made more sense to have the original actors simply
appear 25 years older. One has to wonder just how much of this
fact-based film is fiction.</TE>

<HD>Can't Beat the Babe</HD>
<DH>Whaley's accomplishment is noteworthy, but Didrikson
Zaharias did it decades ago</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Geoff Shackelford</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In announcing last week that she would play in the PGA Tour's Greater
Hartford Open -- which she qualified for by winning a PGA sectional
event in September -- professional golfer Suzy Whaley told Golf
Magazine: "It may seem like a no-brainer that I would grab the
opportunity to be the first woman to play in a PGA Tour event, but
there were many pros and cons to weigh."</LD>
<LD>   One potential "con" is that Whaley will not be the first woman to
play in a PGA Tour event. Nor is she the first to qualify for one.</LD>
<LD>   Both of those honors go to Mildred "Babe" Didrikson Zaharias, who
played in two Los Angeles Opens, including the 1945 event at Riviera
where she played after surviving a 36-hole qualifier.</LD>
<TE>   And Zaharias, unlike Whaley, qualified using the same tees as the
men.</TE>
<TE>   The PGA Tour became its own entity in 1968, separating from the
PGA of America, where the name "PGA Tour" had been informally used to
describe the series of professional events around the country. Most
pre-PGA Tour events with purses over $1,000 held before its trademark
status are considered part of PGA Tour records and lore. So, if it's
any consolation, Whaley will be the first woman to play in a PGA Tour
event.</TE>
<TE>   Almost six years after winning two gold medals in the 1932
Olympics, "the Babe" made her first PGA Tour appearance at the 1938
Los Angeles Open. Encouraged by sportswriter Grantland Rice, she had
taken up golf only three years before entering.</TE>
<TE>   Women were not forbidden from playing men's events, so Didrikson,
26, simply filled out an application. In a publicity stunt designed
to help the struggling tournament, she was paired with Presbyterian
minister C. Pardee Erdman and a 30-year-old professional wrestler
named George Zaharias, known as the "Crying Greek from Cripple
Creek."</TE>
<TE>   The largest gallery at Griffith Park followed the peculiar
threesome. As Didrikson and Zaharias walked the first fairway, the
Babe admitted in her autobiography that the two exchanged flirtatious
glances. They drove separate cars to meet for drinks after the first
two rounds. When both missed the cut (Didrikson shot 84-81), they
watched the third round together and later went dancing at the Cotton
Club. They married that December.</TE>
<TE>   Babe Zaharias tried to qualify again in 1944 but failed while
playing the same tees as her male counterparts. In 1945, Zaharias was
among nearly 200 pro and amateur golfers vying for 90 spots. The
36-hole Wednesday qualifier was played at three courses.</TE>
<TE>   Zaharias became the first woman to equalify for the Los Angeles
Open or any "open" men's event when she shot 76-76-152 at the George
Thomas-designed Baldwin Hills courses. Again, she used the same tees
as the other 42 men who qualified at the now-defunct Culver City
course. Perhaps an even greater achievement, Babe played all 36 holes
paired with her husband. He failed to qualify.</TE>
<TE>   The following day, Times writer Jack Curnow listed his picks for
the event: "Snead and Nelson, logical favorites; Wood and Vines on a
hunch; McSpaden overdue; and for a surprise alternate, what's the
matter with Babe Zaharias? She just might give the lads a merry
chase."</TE>
<TE>   Zaharias was paired with Ed Furgol and Ivan Sicks. Times writer
Braven Dyer covered the opening round: "Babe Didrikson Zaharias drew
a large gallery. Off to a fine start, Babe slumped a bit but still
finished with a 76. This may not sound so amazing but she beat 84
males who were out there hacking away."</TE>
<TE>   Zaharias' 76 tied her with golfing greats George Von Elm and Denny
Shute. Still an amateur, she beat noted professionals including
former or future major championship winners Jerry Barber, Olin Dutra
and Leo Diegel.</TE>
<TE>   She shot an 81 in Saturday's second round, but her 157 total was
good enough to make the 36-hole cut, another first.</TE>
<TE>   Times columnist Al Wolf wrote: "It's too bad she couldn't have
shot a couple of her typical rounds and thus ranked among the
leaders, because it would have been the biggest thing that ever
happened to the tournament. The fans would have loved seeing her
battle down the stretch against the Nelsons and Sneads and Mangrums
and such. Even though she's far out of the championship running, Babe
deserves a salute. Imagine a woman tackling a 7,000-yard course in
the fastest company in the world and sticking!"</TE>
<TE>   A third-round 79 eliminated Zaharias when the field was cut to the
low 61 for the final round.</TE>
<TE>   That still leaves Whaley one potential first: to become the only
woman to play 72 holes in a PGA Tour event.</TE>

<CX>   Women's golf -- A Sports article Wednesday about female golfers Suzy
Whaley and Mildred "Babe" Didrikson Zaharias reported that Whaley
will be the first woman to play in a PGA Tour event. Whaley will be
the first woman to play in a PGA Tour event since the tournament
players ended their affiliation with the PGA of America in 1968 and
formed the PGA Tour. Didrikson Zaharias played in PGA events in 1938
and '45.</CX>

<HD>Worriers Back in Laker Defeat</HD>
<DH>Despite 36 points by O'Neal, Golden State plays harder down
the stretch and takes away L.A. momentum with a 106-102 victory.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tim Brown</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>OAKLAND</DL>
<LD>At the conclusion of a week partly spent belittling his teammates,
Shaquille O'Neal's mood grew darker still Tuesday night.</LD>
<LD>   After the Golden State Warriors beat the Lakers, 106-102, O'Neal
walked slowly to an idling bus, shaking his head at questions thrown
to him from below. He had scored 36 points, had taken nine rebounds,
and it wasn't enough either, so apparently he's beginning to wonder.</LD>
<LD>   "Talk to the [guys] that ain't doing nothing," he said on his way
from the Arena in Oakland, from the Lakers' 10th road loss in 12
games. "Don't talk to me."</LD>
<TE>   He declined to identify the neglectful teammates.</TE>
<TE>   Rick Fox, perhaps, who had eight points and three rebounds in 24
minutes. Maybe Devean George, who had four points and three rebounds
in 29 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Derek Fisher, who missed nine of 13 shots? Kobe Bryant, who scored
19 points, almost nine below his season's average? The whole bench
scored 10 points in 62 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Phil Jackson, possibly, who afterward said he too is waiting for
more effort, but has not yet been able to pull it from his players,
perhaps not yet struck by the urgency of 14 losses in 23 games.</TE>
<TE>   And on they go, alternating between deeply concerned and soaking
in perspective, and unable so far to back up all of the talking
O'Neal did while recovering from toe surgery.</TE>
<TE>   Read O'Neal's words from a notepad, Fox grinned and said, "He can
say that. He's Shaq," and nobody wants any more from O'Neal than
that.</TE>
<TE>   Late last week, after previous criticism from O'Neal -- "I just
want eight guys out there with me who want to play," he had said in
Salt Lake City -- and Bryant, Laker players met to discuss the public
condemnations from their superstar captains. After a pointed oration
from Brian Shaw, in particular, the 13 Lakers agreed it was best not
to disparage one another.</TE>
<TE>   It lasted a few days, anyway, as long as it took to lose again.</TE>
<TE>   They stayed on the edge, where they've spent a good six weeks.</TE>
<TE>   They dare not go too often to their bench. They force minutes for
O'Neal and Bryant. Jackson, who at times coaches as if marginally
interested, spends half the game leaping from his chair bellowing for
timeouts, the other half with his chin on his palm.</TE>
<TE>   And with all of that, it's getting almost no easier for the
Lakers.</TE>
<TE>   The other team played harder defense, the other team played better
down the stretch, and the other team played as though it had more at
stake. They are 9-14, and Christmas is two weeks away.</TE>
<TE>   "We had two big wins against good teams, but I don't think that
was a rebirth of this team," Fisher said. "It's been tough on the
road. We're not playing consistent enough basketball to win on the
road."</TE>
<TE>   Now, after three consecutive championships, the littlest things
can be a problem.</TE>
<TE>   Take Earl Boykins.</TE>
<TE>   The 5-foot-5 guard drove the Warrior offense in the fourth
quarter, drew a game-turning charge against Fisher with inside 11
seconds remaining, and scored the Warriors' last two points, from the
free-throw line. He had 14 points, 11 in the fourth quarter, and
eight assists in 25 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   After leads of 10 points in the first quarter and eight in the
second, the Lakers never led in the second half. In fact, they
rallied from an 11-point deficit with 6:39 remaining to push the
Warriors at the end, drawing once to within a point -- 101-100 with
1:47 left -- with the ball.</TE>
<TE>   Bryant, who had 14 assists but bruised his right elbow and took
only four shots in the second half, missed a jumper, and the Warriors
built their lead to four points.</TE>
<TE>   "We did a good job of fighting toward the end," Bryant said, "but
we weren't able to get over the hump."</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers had won two road games in six weeks, one in Los Angeles
and one in Memphis.</TE>
<TE>   They'd lost in Cleveland, by a lot. In Portland. In Miami. In
Utah. Warm places. Cold places. Places where they played well
(Washington) and not so well (Dallas).</TE>
<TE>   The venue, however, was a coincidence.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers lacked an offensive identity, lacked defensive
continuity. They lacked Shaq.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know if where we played has anything to do with our
start," Fisher said. "It probably didn't matter.</TE>
<TE>   "Whether we're at home or on the road, we're still searching for
ways to go out and impose our will on teams."</TE>
<TE>   They're not there yet, then. They don't yet see that November
changed everything for them.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Arena Football League officials and the player's union have
renegotiated a collective bargaining agreement that could provide the
indoor game with labor peace through 2010.</LD>
<LD>   In the agreement, the Arena Football League Players Assn. made
several short-term financial concessions, including agreeing to keep
the league's salary cap at $1.64 million per team through the 2003
season.</LD>
<LD>   In exchange, league owners agreed for players to share in future
franchise expansion fees, and a percentage of the increase in
franchise value.</LD>
<TE>   "This agreement will give everyone -- owners, players, fans,
sponsors -- a stable labor situation, which gives the league a
long-term stability," said Casey Wasserman, Avenger owner and
chairman of the league's negotiating committee. "We have now created
multiple areas in which we're solidifying the sport."</TE>
<TE>   The Players Assn. will vote to ratify the agreement in January.</TE>
<TE>   "This agreement affords the league the best possibility for
success and growth," said Gene Upshaw, the Players Assn. executive
director. "The players recognize that and will benefit from it."</TE>
<TE>   The current labor agreement runs through 2006. Both the owners and
the Players Assn. can terminate the new pact after the 2006 season as
long as they give notice to the other side at the end of the 2005
season.</TE>

<TE>   Azeri, winner of the Breeders' Cup Distaff and the favorite for
horse-of-the-year honors, will be sold along with 57 other horses as
part of an out-of-court settlement between trustees of the Allen
Paulson Living Trust.</TE>
<TE>   The trustees had been in litigation over the horses, who were
owned by Paulson at the time of his death in July 2000. Azeri is
scheduled to be sold, along with some of the other horses, at the
Barretts auction at Fairplex Park in Pomona on March 4. Under the
agreement, the 4-year-old filly will not be allowed to race before
the sale. After the Fairplex sale, the balance of the Paulson horses
will be sold at three other dispersals later in 2003.</TE>

<TE>   Steve Sexton and Cliff Goodrich, who worked on the same management
team at Santa Anita in the 1980s, have been reunited in the Churchill
Downs Inc. racetrack group, Sexton becoming president of the flagship
track and Goodrich having been named to the top executive position at
Arlington Park.</TE>
<TE>   Sexton, 43, is leaving Arlington to take over at Churchill Downs,
it was announced by the parent company. Goodrich has been appointed
executive vice president at Arlington, with the understanding that
he'll be moved up to president after a short transition period.</TE>
<TE>   Goodrich, 59, was assistant general manager of Santa Anita when
Sexton took his first racing job as sales promotion manager at the
track in 1983.</TE>

<TE>   Christy Martin, the World Boxing Council women's champion, sued a
Michigan promoter for allegedly failing to pay her $300,000 for a
fight last weekend.</TE>
<TE>   Martin said Peter Klamka and Revolution Fighting Inc. of Ann
Arbor, Mich., failed to pay her for a bout against Mia St. John at
the Pontiac Silverdome last Saturday, according to papers filed at
U.S. District Court in Detroit.</TE>
<TE>   Martin, who scored a 10-round decision over St. John, was supposed
to be paid $200,000 by Klamka after the fight and $100,000 by
Revolution Fighting out of pay-per-view proceeds, court documents
said.</TE>
<TE>   Klamka, the chairman of Legend Mobile Inc., said in an e-mail that
he hadn't seen the suit and, therefore, declined to comment.</TE>

<HD>Talks Might End Ban on Rose</HD>
<DH>Baseball great had meeting with Selig. Sides have exchanged
proposals that could lead to reinstatement of Hall of Fame
eligibility.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Ross Newhan</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Will Pete Rose soon be receiving the Christmas gift he most covets?</LD>
<LD>   It is not yet a sure bet, but negotiations between baseball
officials and Rose's representatives could result in the lifting of
his lifetime ban for gambling on the game, ultimately making the
all-time hits leader eligible for the Hall of Fame.</LD>
<LD>   Sources confirmed that Rose discussed his status in a meeting with
Commissioner Bud Selig in Milwaukee on Nov. 25, and that Rose's
representatives have since exchanged draft proposals with industry
lawyers under the direction of chief operating officer Robert DuPuy.</LD>
<TE>   The meeting between Rose and Selig was brokered by former
teammates Mike Schmidt, Joe Morgan and Johnny Bench. Schmidt
accompanied Rose to the meeting.</TE>
<TE>   Neither of Rose's lawyers, S. Gary Spicer and Roger Makley, could
be reached Tuesday, but a source familiar with the talks said the
process is definitely aimed at reinstatement and that a decision
could come sooner rather than later.</TE>
<TE>   The source added that Rose would have to acknowledge that he bet
on baseball, which he refused to do for the 13 years since accepting
a lifetime ban on Aug. 23, 1989, and might have to serve a
probationary period before full reinstatement.</TE>
<TE>   Selig could not be reached Tuesday, and DuPuy would only release a
statement in which he noted that Rose had applied for reinstatement
(in September, 1997) and "given the pendency of that application,"
neither Selig nor any other baseball official would comment further.</TE>
<TE>   If Rose is reinstated, he would be the first of 14 people banned
from the game for life to have that penalty lifted.</TE>
<TE>   Why Selig would consider it isn't clear.</TE>
<TE>   He has long seemed determined to uphold the penalty imposed by the
late Bart Giamatti, his good friend and former commissioner, and has
said repeatedly that Rose has offered no new evidence to dispute the
findings of investigator John Dowd that he bet on baseball while
manager of the Cincinnati Reds. The Dowd investigation of a
four-month period in 1987 concluded that Rose made 412 baseball
wagers -- 52 on the Reds to win.</TE>
<TE>   Sources, however, speculated that Selig has come to grips with
Rose's popularity (as measured again by the ovation he received in
San Francisco when allowed to participate in a ceremony before Game 4
of the World Series), now regards Rose's possible reinstatement as
another positive development for the industry in the aftermath of a
labor agreement that was reached, for the first time, without a work
stoppage, thinks it would be a boon for the Reds' franchise if the
17-time All-Star was to participate in the opening of the new
Cincinnati ballpark in April and is willing to take a chance on
Rose's sincerity.</TE>
<TE>   Lawyer Dowd suggested Tuesday that he considers that a high risk,
saying there is no guarantee Rose has reconfigured his life.</TE>
<TE>   "I would be leery of the history and very careful before I put him
back," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "I would be concerned that I was putting the game in jeopardy."</TE>

<LD>Long Beach State's inability to get things done down the stretch cost
it a shot at defeating San Diego State in a men's basketball game
Tuesday night at the Pyramid.</LD>
<LD>   The 49ers failed to convert several free throws or score key
baskets on several late possessions and San Diego State capitalized
for a 64-55 victory.</LD>
<LD>   It marked the first time since 1971 that San Diego State (3-3) has
recorded two road victories this early in the season. The Aztecs beat
Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, 65-62, Nov. 30</LD>
<TE>   Long Beach (1-5) held several first-half leads and, after falling
behind by 10 points in the second half, rallied to pull to within
58-54 on a driving basket by Tony Darden with 2:21 to play.</TE>
<TE>   Darden later rushed a three-point attempt that missed and, with a
minute to go, former Compton High standout Deandre Moore hit a short
jumper for San Diego State.</TE>
<TE>   Long Beach forward Kevin Roberts missed two free throws 12 seconds
later and Aztec center Mike Mackell responded with two free throws
for a 62-54 lead.</TE>
<TE>   "We are thrilled to death to be walking out of this place with a
win because we have not been the kind of team that has been able to
go on the road and beat people," Coach Steve Fisher said.</TE>
<TE>   Darden led all scorers with 20 points and Mackell had 17 points
and six rebounds.</TE>

home victory.</TE>

<HD>UCLA Officials Meet With Riley</HD>
<DH>Their visit to New Orleans results in lengthy talks but no
offer. Brooks, Price among other coaches in the mix for vacancy.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Henson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>UCLA athletic administrators Dan Guerrero and Bob Field had extra
room to stretch out on their flight from New Orleans to Los Angeles
on Tuesday night: The seat they had reserved in Mike Riley's name was
vacant.</LD>
<LD>   Riley, the New Orleans Saints' secondary coach, was the first
candidate interviewed by Guerrero, the first-year athletic director,
and Field, a trusted lieutenant, since Bob Toledo was fired as Bruin
coach Monday.</LD>
<LD>   However, Riley said that despite a lengthy, cordial meeting, an
offer was not made -- and Guerrero never mentioned the open seat on
the plane.</LD>
<TE>   Still, it was a busy day for Riley, a former San Diego Charger
coach and USC assistant. He also met with representatives from
Alabama -- his alma mater -- and had discussions with Kentucky.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been on the West Coast most of my life, so it was an honor
to talk to [UCLA]," he said. "And I went to 'Bama, so that's pretty
interesting.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't have any offer, I just have to play it out."</TE>
<TE>   Riley yearns to return to Southern California, sources said,
because his wife and two high school-age children live in San Diego.
He was the offensive coordinator at USC for four years and head coach
at Oregon State for two years, so he fits the profile Guerrero is
seeking of a West Coast-savvy coach with experience in the Pacific 10
Conference.</TE>
<TE>   Riley, 49, said he believed UCLA would continue to explore
candidates, and sources indicated there is something of a
generational split among officials and boosters on who the coach
should be.</TE>
<TE>   The old guard likes former Oregon coach Rich Brooks, 60, who has
been out of coaching since quitting as Atlanta Falcon defensive
coordinator a year ago, and Washington State Coach Mike Price, 56.
Both have discreetly indicated interest.</TE>
<TE>   Thirty-something alumni, including many former players, favor Karl
Dorrell, 39, a Denver Bronco assistant and former Bruin receiver.
Dorrell was offensive coordinator under Rick Neuheisel at Colorado
and for one season at Washington.</TE>
<TE>   And then there is Neuheisel, the Washington coach and another
former UCLA player. Former UCLA coach Terry Donahue reportedly
contacted Neuheisel about the opening and friends of the coach have
passed the word to UCLA boosters that he is interested.</TE>
<TE>   "He is extremely interested," one source said. "He really wants
the job and is willing to take a pay cut."</TE>
<TE>   However, it would take considerable belt-tightening for Neuheisel
to leave Washington, where he makes $1.5 million a year. UCLA is
believed to be offering $700,000 to $800,000, plus incentives.</TE>
<TE>   Other college coaches under discussion include Walt Harris of
Pittsburgh, June Jones of Hawaii, Ron Turner of Illinois, Kirk
Ferentz of Iowa and Dan Hawkins of Boise State. USC assistant Norm
Chow said he has not been contacted by UCLA.</TE>
<TE>   Hawkins, who led Boise State to an 11-1 record in his second
season, could be a strong candidate despite his low profile. He
turned down an offer of $1 million by Baylor last week and today is
expected to finalize a five-year deal at Boise State worth $465,000 a
year.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a unique guy," said someone close to the Boise State
program. "He's an excellent coach, but he makes it clear there are
more important things than money."</TE>
<TE>   Candidates besides Riley and Dorrell from the NFL ranks include
Kansas City Chief defensive coordinator Greg Robinson, who reportedly
has the support of former Bruin Coach Dick Vermeil.</TE>
<TE>   Guerrero is not expected to visit another long-distance candidate
in person for a few days. He is scheduled to attend a news conference
in Las Vegas on Thursday associated with the Bruins' appearance in
the Las Vegas Bowl on Christmas Day.</TE>
<TE>   It's important that UCLA moves quickly. About half of the dozen or
so recruits scheduled to make visits to the UCLA campus this weekend
have canceled their trips, a football source said.</TE>
<TE>   Riley remains at the forefront. He has a one-year deal with New
Orleans and is owed $750,000 by the Chargers for the last year of his
five-year guaranteed contract.</TE>
<TE>   A source close to Riley said that his desire to return to Southern
California would prompt him to accept a salary in the $1 million
range from UCLA, even if Alabama offers more.</TE>
<TE>   His family does not want to leave Southern California, and that is
paramount to him.</TE>
<TE>   "We're still living separate lives, and we've got to remedy that
no matter what happens," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The Saints would be expected to allow him to leave for a head
coaching job before the end of the NFL season. Although Riley lost
his last nine games with the Chargers in 2001, his easygoing,
enthusiastic temperament is considered ideal for the college ranks.</TE>
<TE>   Riley made one point clear to Guerrero--he wants to be a head
coach again.</TE>
<TE>   "If I get the opportunity," he said, "I'd like to do it."</TE>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Steve Lavin is normally as quick with an answer as a gunslinger with
a six-shooter.</LD>
<LD>   But the question stopped the Bruin basketball coach in his tracks:
What is your reaction to football coach Bob Toledo's getting fired?</LD>
<LD>   "I was aware of the speculation," he said, "but when it actually
happens, it makes you pause."</LD>
<TE>   So he did. Lavin stared into space for five, 10, 15 seconds before
continuing.</TE>
<TE>   "When you have a coaching colleague who no longer is employed,
your heart goes out to him and his family," he said. "It sets you
back for a moment and makes you reflect on challenges coaches at the
highest level face on a daily basis."</TE>
<TE>   Lavin is acutely aware that the same rationale Athletic Director
Dan Guerrero used to fire Toledo applies to him. Guerrero
acknowledged that the football team met expectations on and off the
field this season, but said the "attitude and perception" of the
program had been irreparably harmed by years of missteps.</TE>
<TE>   So Lavin understands that it might not matter how much his young
team improves after its 1-2 start. Even another Sweet 16 appearance
could be his last with UCLA.</TE>
<TE>   "He's made it clear what the criteria are [for a coach to
succeed]," Lavin said. "He wants a nationally competitive program, to
recruit well nationally, to graduate kids and to compete favorably
against USC."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Either Michael Fey or Ryan Hollins will start at center for the
time being, allowing T.J. Cummings to remain at power forward, his
natural position.... Forward Andre Patterson might have spoken
prematurely Sunday when he said that he had received two A grades and
one C in classes at Santa Monica College. He still has one final to
take. Patterson is academically ineligible, pending an appeal Monday
before the UCLA College of Letters and Sciences. He hopes to rejoin
the team in time to play Tuesday against Northern Arizona.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>At first glance, there would seem to be a certain
counter-productivity to the way Henry Bibby doles out playing time.</LD>
<LD>   But although the USC coach is notorious for his freewheeling style
of shuffling players, a move that sometimes wounds their confidence,
Bibby said there is a reason for it, especially this season.</LD>
<LD>   "I have probably 10 guys that could start on this team," he said.
"That's why it's difficult, at times, to start certain guys. I don't
really know who I'm going to start, game to game, because we're so
even from 1-10. There's not one [player] that's better than the
next."</LD>
<TE>   That's why the Trojans, who are still trying to recover from
losing three senior starters, have had five different starting
lineups in five games.</TE>
<TE>   It's no wonder, then, that in Bibby's system, his leading scorer
has started only twice.</TE>
<TE>   "He's just trying to find who's going to produce," said junior
guard Desmon Farmer, who is averaging a team-high 15.2 points,
despite shooting a career-low 32.8%, down from the 44.6% he was
shooting before this season.</TE>
<TE>   In Saturday's 78-72 loss to Missouri in the Wooden Classic, nine
Trojans played, none played more than 29 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   It was the first time since USC lost at Arizona, 88-73, on March
4, 1999, that no Trojan had played at least 30 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Junior forward Jerry Dupree's six-game suspension is up tonight
and he's sure he made enough academic progress in the fall semester
to warrant his return.</TE>
<TE>   With Dupree starting the fall semester on academic probation and
in danger of being academically ineligible for the spring, he was
suspended by Bibby in an effort to help him concentrate on his
studies.</TE>
<TE>   "Hopefully, things will be positive for him," Bibby said. Dupree,
who has been hobbled by a sore right heel, was cleared Tuesday to
begin light workouts.</TE>

<HD>Former Official Returns to Back Ahmanson Housing Project</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Massie Ritsch</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Nearly 10 years to the day after Ventura County supervisors first
green-lighted the Ahmanson Ranch development, a former supervisor who
secured parkland to make the deal more palatable returned Tuesday to
endorse the controversial project.</LD>
<LD>   At a hearing Tuesday on a new environmental study of the stalled
$2-billion housing development near Calabasas, Maria VanderKolk told
the county Board of Supervisors that the Ahmanson Ranch project was a
visionary deal that preserved open space while easing the region's
housing shortage.</LD>
<LD>   When elected supervisor in 1990, VanderKolk was a fresh-faced
25-year-old who campaigned on the promise to save scenic mountain
land in Ventura County. Two years later, she worked with then-Gov.
Pete Wilson to broker a compromise to set aside 10,000 acres around
Ahmanson Ranch, but allow the 3,050-home project to proceed. Branded
by her onetime allies as a traitor who sold out to developers,
VanderKolk left office in 1994 and moved to Colorado.</LD>
<TE>   Enduring more jeers Tuesday, VanderKolk said she came back to
Ventura County -- at her expense, she said, not the developers' -- to
remind supervisors that the project compromise was initially heralded
as a win for environmentalists and developers.</TE>
<TE>   State officials called it the parkland deal of the century. But in
recent years, a pack of public officials have torn the project apart;
former President Clinton phoned in his objections to the board
chairman Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Said VanderKolk: "I started this, and I feel a duty and obligation
to finish this."</TE>
<TE>   The hearing opened at least 16 hours of testimony on the
sufficiency of developer Washington Mutual Bank's plan to protect an
endangered frog and flower.</TE>

green-lighted the Ahmanson Ranch development, a former supervisor who
secured parkland to make the deal more palatable returned Tuesday to
endorse the controversial project.</LD>
<LD>   At a hearing on a new environmental study of the stalled
$2-billion housing development near Calabasas, Maria VanderKolk told
the county Board of Supervisors that the Ahmanson Ranch project was a
visionary deal that preserved open space while easing the region's
housing shortage.</LD>
<LD>   When elected supervisor in 1990, VanderKolk was a fresh-faced,
25-year-old who campaigned on the promise to save scenic mountain
land in Ventura County.</LD>
<TE>   Two years later, she worked with then-Gov. Pete Wilson to broker a
compromise to set aside 10,000 acres around Ahmanson Ranch, but allow
the 3,050-home project to proceed.</TE>
<TE>   Branded by her onetime allies as a traitor who sold out to
developers, VanderKolk left office in 1994 and moved to Colorado.</TE>
<TE>   Enduring more jeers Tuesday, VanderKolk said she came back to
Ventura County -- at her expense, she said, not the developers' -- to
remind supervisors that the Ahmanson Ranch compromise was initially
heralded as a win for environmentalists and developers.</TE>
<TE>   State officials called it the parkland deal of the century. But in
recent years, a pack of public officials have torn the project apart;
former President Bill Clinton phoned in his objections to the board
chairman Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   A bit overwhelmed by a hearing room packed with hundreds of
partisans, elected officials and reporters, VanderKolk said, "I
started this, and I feel a duty and obligation to finish this."</TE>
<TE>   The environmentalists who once backed VanderKolk said they could
not believe she had the nerve to show up. The hearing opened at least
16 hours of testimony on the sufficiency of developer Washington
Mutual Bank's plan to protect an endangered frog and flower. Their
discovery began another round of analysis of a project initially
approved in 1992.</TE>
<TE>   "How dare she show her face in this area?" Save Open Space's Mary
Wiesbrock asked. "This is our home. She made this decision and then
left for Colorado."</TE>
<TE>   Wiesbrock and other Ahmanson Ranch opponents discounted
VanderKolk's renewed endorsement of the project, saying the area
where Washington Mutual wants to build its 8,700-resident community
has changed vastly since she left town.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the discovery of the endangered species, the
project's foes contend traffic has become much worse. Most recently,
there has been concern a cancer-causing chemical used in rocket fuel
may have seeped into ground water.</TE>
<TE>   The detection of the toxin, called perchlorate, in a well near
Ahmanson Ranch warrants further study, Assemblywoman Hannah-Beth
Jackson (D-Santa Barbara) told supervisors at the hearing.</TE>
<TE>   There are plans to protect the red-legged frog and San Fernando
Valley spineflower, Jackson said, "yet we're not doing the same for
another potentially endangered species -- ourselves."</TE>
<TE>   The developer has offered to abandon its plan to irrigate the
project's two golf courses with the well water if it is deemed too
risky.</TE>
<TE>   Washington Mutual's representatives urged supervisors to focus on
the issue at hand -- the environmental study and tract map for the
project's first phase -- and not be distracted by opponents'
arguments on other points.</TE>
<TE>   The supervisors will continue the hearing Tuesday, when officials
from Calabasas are scheduled to explain why the project should not be
built near their city.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles also opposes the development, because it would be
stuck with the traffic while Ventura County reaps the tax benefits.</TE>
<TE>   As the hearings proceed, still unsettled is how long the public
comment will go on. Washington Mutual wants to break ground as
quickly as possible, but opponents want more study.</TE>
<TE>   The county counsel says supervisors need not receive comments past
Jan. 3. The project's opponents cited a state ordinance that would
allow the public to share its opinions with supervisors through Jan.
9.</TE>
<TE>   The intervening six days might seem insignificant, but both sides
see the timing as crucial.</TE>
<TE>   On Jan. 6 the supervisorial seat representing the Ahmanson Ranch
area will change hands, possibly shifting the board's thinking on the
development.</TE>
<TE>   Supervisor Frank Schillo, who supports the development, will be
replaced then by Linda Parks, an opponent.</TE>
<TE>   Schillo won his seat after VanderKolk decided not to seek a second
term.</TE>

<HD>Autistic Boy Is His Mother's Life, Friends Insist</HD>
<DH>Stanton woman accused of trying to kill her son loves the
5-year-old, according to neighbors.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jennifer Mena</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Stunned by news that their neighbor is accused of trying to kill her
autistic son, residents of a Stanton neighborhood said Heidi Shelton
had been intensely dedicated to the 5-year-old but struggled to meet
his special needs.</LD>
<LD>   "I don't believe it," said Darci Rynsburger, a neighbor who
described herself as a former close friend of the mother. "She
worshiped that boy."</LD>
<LD>   Shelton is scheduled to be arraigned today on a charge of
attempted murder and child endangerment. Orange County sheriff's
officials say she tried to poison her son -- and herself -- with
overdoses of Xanax, an anti-anxiety drug. The two were found Sunday
night by Shelton's mother, who lives with the family.</LD>
<TE>   "Her intent was to kill him and herself. We know, just by
statements she made, that that was her intent," said Jim Amormino,
spokesman for the Orange County Sheriff's Department.</TE>
<TE>   Amormino said he did not know if Shelton, who has a prescription
for the Xanax, was motivated by frustration with her son's condition.</TE>
<TE>   Autism is a neurological disorder that affects a person's ability
to interact with others.The case is the second such incident in
Orange County this year; in July a Laguna Niguel man shot and killed
his 27-year-old autistic son before committing suicide.</TE>
<TE>   After Shelton and her son were briefly hospitalized, she was taken
to Central Women's Jail in Santa Ana. The son is at Orangewood, the
county's foster care facility.</TE>
<TE>   It's a story that neighbors in the condominium complex in the 7200
block of Penn Way, nestled in a cluster of streets off Beach
Boulevard, said they find hard to accept.</TE>
<TE>   "Zachary is her whole life," said Reggie Bernard.</TE>
<TE>   Neighbors said Shelton dropped a real estate career to take care
of the boy herself. She took frequent walks with him and never seemed
to be upset. He loves remote-controlled cars, hats and the color
pink.</TE>
<TE>   But they said they knew the single mother faced problems.</TE>
<TE>   Shelton "has been dealt a rough hand" and had been troubled about
life events even before Zachary was born, Rynsburger said. She would
not elaborate, but added that despite her troubles, Shelton "could
never kill that boy. She loved him. I know there is more to this
story."</TE>
<TE>   Neighbors said, however, that Zachary is rambunctious and has
required constant attention. Bernard said he and his wife had taken
care of Zachary a few times. "You never knew what he was going to
do," he said. "You had to watch him real close."</TE>
<TE>   Other neighbors noted that Shelton worked to keep her cool.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes, she would seem mad, but she would hold it back," said
William Mendoza, a 14-year-old neighbor whose dog Ginger played with
the boy on the grass between their condominiums.</TE>
<TE>   More recently, neighbors say, Shelton had faced problems at Carver
Elementary School, where she tried to place the boy in kindergarten.</TE>
<TE>   Recently their problems have seemed worse, especially for the boy,
neighbors said.</TE>
<TE>   Joan Bergeron, who has a grandchild with autism, said autistic
children thrive on routine.</TE>
<TE>   "He's probably freaking out. He needs to be in his own
environment," Bergeron said.</TE>
<TE>   Bernard Rimland, founder of the Autism Society of America and
director of the Autism Research Institute in San Diego, said that
although it is rare for parents to kill their autistic children, many
parents are frustrated by the condition.</TE>
<TE>   "A mother likes to get a response from their kid. But the autistic
kid is programmed so he does not respond to kindness and hugs. He is
often indifferent," Rimland said. "It's an extremely frustrating
situation."</TE>
<TE>   Rimland added that physicians often do not provide useful advice,
babysitters are not accustomed to dealing with such uncooperative
children, and teachers do not know how to handle them.</TE>
<TE>   "It's easy to reach your limit," he said.</TE>
<TE>   And as autistic children grow, they present increasing challenges
because they are stronger and harder to control, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Neighbor Bergeron said she frequently talked with Shelton about
these issues.</TE>
<TE>   "Heidi had learned to live with the pressures," Bergeron said.</TE>
<TE>   "She was a wonderful mom and a wonderful person. I would leave my
grandchildren with her."</TE>

<HD>Nasty Fight Over Nurses Union Goes to a Vote</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Charles Ornstein</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The radio advertisement told of the close-knit bond between
Cedars-Sinai Medical Center and its nurses.</LD>
<LD>   "My mom knows how to care for people," a youngster said on the
spot, which ran last month. "It's what makes her a great nurse and
great mother. It's like she has two families -- one at home and one
at Cedars-Sinai."</LD>
<LD>   But many say the family of 1,511 registered nurses has become
dysfunctional of late, as rancor has grown over a vote on whether to
join the California Nurses Assn., the state's largest nurses union.
The three-day vote is set to begin today and be tallied late Friday.</LD>
<TE>   Because Cedars-Sinai is the largest private hospital in the West,
a union victory there would be a major coup for the CNA, which
already represents 45,000 nurses in the state and has recently won
important victories at other hospitals. If Cedars-Sinai stops the
union, it could boost other hospitals' anti-union efforts, experts
say.</TE>
<TE>   "It's significant, because Cedars is such an icon," said Edward
O'Neil, director of the Center for the Health Professions at UC San
Francisco. "Nationwide, it's seen as one of the top dozen medical
centers."</TE>
<TE>   The campaign has been a nasty battle of wills between Cedars-Sinai
and the CNA, both celebrating their 100th anniversary this year.</TE>
<TE>   Each side accuses the other of underhanded tactics and
misrepresentations. Pro-union nurses say managers and anti-union
colleagues have told them to expect retaliation if the vote fails.
Anti-union nurses say they have received threatening phone calls at
home from union supporters.</TE>
<TE>   "It's so frustrating," said Scott Barnes, an emergency room nurse
who opposes the union. "Before, we all got along, and now there's
just so much tension and so much animosity."</TE>
<TE>   Pro-union nurses say they are organizing for better pay,
retirement benefits and working conditions. Despite Cedars-Sinai's
pledge to listen to nurses, "We don't have a say in what happens
there," said Joao Da Silva, an emergency room nurse. "They take
suggestions, but if it costs too much, forget about it."</TE>
<TE>   Anti-union nurses say that a union would only lead to upheaval and
that strikes could jeopardize patient care.</TE>
<TE>   "I am perfectly capable of speaking for myself" without a union,
said emergency room nurse Suzanne Geimer. "I think we're all
intelligent people."</TE>
<TE>   Cedars-Sinai, which began as a hospital for the working class, has
in recent years been successful at keeping unions out.</TE>
<TE>   In 1976, the hospital fought an attempt by its medical interns and
residents to organize, leading to a nationwide labor board precedent
that prohibited the practice because most of the workers were
trainees. That decision was overturned in 1999 in a case involving a
Boston medical center.</TE>
<TE>   In the 1980s, the Service Employees International Union failed to
organize nurses in large part because of Cedars-Sinai's opposition.</TE>
<TE>   Thomas M. Priselac, the hospital's president and chief executive,
said Cedars-Sinai strives to be responsive to its nurses -- and
doesn't need an outside agitator. "The union model is not a model
that we believe works best for our employees," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Hospital officials say, for example, that they have responded to
concerns about medical benefits by absorbing a 25% increase in
health-care costs this year. The hospital said it has also raised
nurses' salaries by 5%, adding another 5% increase for nurses with
more than 20 years of experience.</TE>
<TE>   Cedars-Sinai is one of two hospitals in California designated as a
magnet hospital for nurses by the American Nurses Credentialing
Center, an honor bestowed on facilities that give nurses direct input
into hospital operations.</TE>
<TE>   Pro-union nurses say they believe that Cedars-Sinai can do more.
And they say they are particularly appalled at the way the hospital
has responded to the unionization drive. The medical center has
required nurses to attend meetings about their benefits and the rules
governing unions, which some participants say have turned into
anti-union lectures.</TE>
<TE>   During separate meetings, nurses say, they have been shown a
videotape that presents an unfavorable portrayal of the CNA's recent
strike at Long Beach Memorial Medical Center. As ominous music played
in the background, the tape included interviews with patients
criticizing the strike.</TE>
<TE>   In a guide developed to accompany the videotape, nurse supervisors
are encouraged to ask rank-and-file nurses, "What part of the strike
made you angry?" and "What parts embarrassed you as a nurse?"</TE>
<TE>   A flier distributed by Cedars-Sinai officials to staff members
titled "Election Facts" asks: "Do you really want to join a union
that: Controls your work life? Can fine you? Can have you fired?
Requires you to walk away from your patients?"</TE>
<TE>   Jill Furillo, the union's director of government relations, said:
"They're trying to depict unionization efforts as trying to tear the
hospital down. We're trying to build the hospital back up as a great
hospital where nurses feel valued and have an equal voice."</TE>
<TE>   Several California lawmakers, liberal groups and even well-known
actors have criticized Cedars-Sinai's campaign. An ad in Daily
Variety last week signed by Martin Sheen, Elliot Gould and Ed Asner,
among others, calls on the hospital to "hold a fair and democratic
election for your registered nurses."</TE>
<TE>   "The money Cedars-Sinai spends intimidating and misleading its
nurses would be better spent on patient care services," the ad
states.</TE>
<TE>   The hospital's senior vice president for human resources, Jeanne
Flores, said she stands by the campaign. "I think it's a factual
representation of what often happens when the CNA begins to represent
nurses in an organization," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Flores said she believes critics are "misinformed."</TE>
<TE>   Anti-union nurses accuse union organizers of dressing up in
hospital scrubs and meeting with nurses during work hours, only to be
removed from the property by security.</TE>
<TE>   They also say the union printed the photos of several anti-union
nurses in a brochure that features more than 100 union supporters.</TE>
<TE>   Priselac said he knows the election has been divisive, but he
emphasized that patient care has not suffered.</TE>
<TE>   "Regardless of the outcome of the election," he said, "our focus
is going to be that things do return to normal, so the medical center
environment can return to the institution it's always been."</TE>

<HD>Sgt. Sanchez Reports for School Duty</HD>
<DH>Through a Troops to Teachers program, an Air Force man
becomes a science teacher.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Erika Hayasaki</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When students at Pioneer High School in Whittier discovered their
science teacher, Gilbert Sanchez, was a military man, they opened
fire on him.</LD>
<LD>   Only this bombardment came in the form of questions: Did they
teach you how to kill? Can you blow stuff up? Can you fly a fighter
jet? Where have you traveled? And on and on.</LD>
<LD>   Sanchez, who became a chemistry, biology and physics teacher three
years ago through the U.S. Department of Defense Troops to Teachers
program, tries to answer those questions. But he doesn't want his own
experience to distract students from their lessons.</LD>
<TE>   "Teaching is definitely a lot more challenging than the military
because, in class, you always have to be on your toes. You're dealing
with 35 different individuals who have 35 different personalities. In
the military, it is much more uniform and very structured," said
Sanchez, a former sergeant who spent six years in the Air Force.</TE>
<TE>   He is among more than 4,600 military personnel who have moved into
teaching through the Troops to Teachers program since its founding in
1993. In California, 400 teachers entered the profession that way,
including 60 this year, officials say.</TE>
<TE>   The federal program was founded at a time when the armed forces
were being downsized, and the military was hunting for jobs for its
honorably discharged personnel. Schools like the idea as a way to
find instructors with positive life experiences and an ability to
work with young people, particularly those with discipline problems.</TE>
<TE>   The program lost fuel in 1996 after most funding was phased out.
Last year, President Bush revived it, increasing funding by $11
million, with an additional $18 million due this year, mainly to pay
tuition bills for former military people going back to school for
teaching credentials.</TE>
<TE>   "It has really been a shot in arm. Programs are gearing up again,
" said Cindy Moore, director of the California Troops to Teachers
division. "It helps teacher shortages, and these men and women are
positive role models in public schools."</TE>
<TE>   In addition, she said, many former military people are willing to
teach in inner-city schools and "they're often experts in math and
science, which are high-need areas."</TE>
<TE>   Under the program, retired or honorably discharged military
personnel who have college degrees can get $5,000 to $10,000 for
additional courses for teaching credentials. And any veteran who
agrees to teach for three years in a high-need school, usually in
overcrowded or high-poverty areas, can receive $10,000 toward
tuition.</TE>
<TE>   Nancy Brownell, director of the California Center for Teaching
Careers, a recruitment service administered by the California State
University that works with the program, said efforts such as Troops
to Teachers are succeeding.</TE>
<TE>   Although the downturn in other sectors of the economy has also
channeled more people into teaching, Troops to Teachers moves
educated, talented, reliable adults into classrooms, she said. "One
of the things that is advantageous to the teaching field is broader
experience, and those who are leaving the military bring a rich
history of life experience to classroom," she said.</TE>
<TE>   In California, teachers recruited through Troops to Teachers often
work near military bases, Moore said, for convenience in case they
get recalled to duty.</TE>
<TE>   Sanchez, a father of three, still serves in the National Guard.
His Whittier school is about an hour west of March Air Force Base in
Riverside, where he is stationed.</TE>
<TE>   Sanchez said he took advantage of the program because teaching
came naturally to him during his Air Force duties.</TE>
<TE>   He earned his undergraduate degree at Whittier College and a
master's degree and teaching credential from the University of La
Verne.</TE>
<TE>   In high school and college, Sanchez tutored fellow students, and
in the military he trained beginner troops on how to use explosives.
Instructing teenagers to identify DNA or make rockets is really no
different from teaching recruits how to handle a bomb safely, he
said.</TE>
<TE>   The high school's principal, Roberta Berg, said she hopes to hire
more military people like Sanchez. "He is a great teacher, and he has
a wonderful rapport with the students," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Sanchez, 31, does not bring a military bearing to his classes. He
appears even-tempered and remarkably respectful toward his students,
addressing each one as "sir" or "ma'am."</TE>
<TE>   "I expected him to be like one of those drill sergeants," said
student Vanessa Estralla, 16, who found out he is not the rigid
leader she envisioned.</TE>
<TE>   Sanchez says the Air Force prepared him for the many personalities
in a 1,500-student school. In the military "a lot of times you get
thrown together with different people from different parts of the
world. You have to figure out how to work together," said Sanchez,
who has served in Japan, Korea, Singapore, Malaysia, France and
Spain.</TE>
<TE>   But he didn't know how much teenagers turn to teachers,
particularly science teachers, for personal advice about issues,
including sex. "They ask you about things they might not ask about at
home," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Sanchez's classroom walls are covered with photo collages of
shells, skulls, dinosaur bones and plants. A poster reads: "Remember,
amateurs built the ark, professionals built the Titanic."</TE>
<TE>   The only hint of his military alter-ego is a figurine of a
decorated U.S. Air Force member holding a small jet fighter, on a
shelf. That was given to him as a goodbye gift from a student when he
was sent to France for three weeks by the National Guard two years
ago.</TE>
<TE>   His students know he may have to serve in Turkey if the U.S. goes
to war with Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   "It's scary to them, so I try not to talk about it," he said. But
when students ask why he must go, he tells them: "I'm defending their
way of life."</TE>
<TE>   If Sanchez returns to military service, "I'll miss him, he's a
good teacher," said student Valarie McRoberts, 17. "It's good to help
[the country] but it's sad because he's the coolest teacher here."</TE>

<HD>Jet Crash Probe Is Concluded</HD>
<DH>Poor maintenance, lax federal oversight are blamed for
insufficient lubrication on key part.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Ricardo Alonso-Zaldivar</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Widespread maintenance deficiencies at Alaska Airlines and lax
oversight by federal regulators were the main underlying factors in
the crash of Flight 261 off the Ventura coast nearly three years ago,
safety investigators concluded Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   In its final deliberations on the catastrophe, the National
Transportation Safety Board also found that a critical component of
the MD-83 jetliner lacked a fail-safe mechanism.</LD>
<LD>   The safety board called on the Federal Aviation Administration to
find an engineering fix that could prevent poor maintenance from
leading to more accidents. There are about 2,100 airliners of similar
design in service around the world, including the DC-9, the Boeing
717 and the MD-80/90 series aircraft.</LD>
<TE>   The Jan. 31, 2000, crash killed all 88 people aboard the flight
from Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, to San Francisco. Despite an
FAA-ordered overhaul of Alaska Airlines' practices, NTSB staff
members told the board they have seen evidence of continuing
maintenance problems.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel in this instance, the FAA failed miserably in its
oversight," said acting NTSB Chairwoman Carol Carmody, prompting
applause from dozens of relatives of the victims.</TE>
<TE>   The pilots of Flight 261 had struggled with a mechanical problem
for most of their trip and were preparing to divert to Los Angeles
when they lost control.</TE>
<TE>   The pilots had no way of knowing that the plane's horizontal
stabilizer had suddenly failed. A wing-like surface atop the tail,
the stabilizer is used to control the up-and-down pitch of the nose.
The MD-83 rolled on its back in a steep dive into the Pacific.</TE>
<TE>   The loss of control was prompted by the failure of an internal
component, a unit called the jackscrew assembly. The jackscrew is a
large, threaded bolt used to raise and lower the leading edge of the
stabilizer.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators recovered the bolt from the ocean floor and found
that there was almost no grease on it. The lack of lubrication
stripped the threads of a nut that housed the jackscrew bolt and was
the immediate cause of the accident, investigators concluded.</TE>
<TE>   NTSB board members criticized the airline for not quickly landing
Flight 261 after it became apparent that the pilots were facing a
stubborn problem. Mechanics on the ground attempted to trouble-shoot
the situation via radio, but they were stumped.</TE>
<TE>   Board member John Goglia suggested that the airline was trying to
avoid diverting the plane. "There is no doubt in my mind that
pressure was being put on the captain," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Alaska Airlines issued a statement acknowledging the NTSB's
central findings and said it has completely revamped its maintenance
practices and safety procedures.</TE>
<TE>   "The airline agrees and concurs with many elements of the board's
review and respectfully questions others," the statement said. "This
is not, however, a time to question those judgments. This is a time
to move on and to continue to focus on improving safety at Alaska and
throughout the aviation industry as a whole."</TE>
<TE>   NTSB staff members said they have found evidence of ongoing
problems at the airline, and recommended a new round of in-depth
inspections by the FAA.</TE>
<TE>   "If I was in charge, I'd look at Alaska," said Richard Rodriguez,
the lead investigator on the crash.</TE>
<TE>   But a split board refused to endorse that recommendation, citing
concerns that FAA inspectors are spread too thin across an industry
that is reeling from economic troubles.</TE>
<TE>   FAA spokesman Les Dorr defended the agency's oversight of Alaska's
maintenance program. The NTSB criticized the FAA for granting several
extensions of time intervals for jackscrew lubrication and inspection
procedures, but Dorr said the extensions were "well within industry
standards." FAA officials said they would study NTSB recommendations
for improvements in maintenance and a long-term engineering fix.</TE>
<TE>   The MD-83 was manufactured by McDonnell Douglas, now part of
Boeing. Susan Bradley, a Boeing spokeswoman, said that the company
believes the design of the jackscrew is sound, but that it would
cooperate in any search for improvements to make it fail-safe.</TE>
<TE>   Marianne Busche of Olympia, Wash., whose son Ryan and
daughter-in-law Abigail were killed in the crash, said the planes
should be recalled and fixed.</TE>
<TE>   "I think they need to redesign, because no one is watching over
them, and there is no guarantee," said Busche, who was among dozens
of family members attending the NTSB meeting.</TE>
<TE>   One woman carried a hand-lettered sign that read: "Corporate Greed
Killed 88 People."</TE>
<TE>   Alaska's statement, the only official comment by the airline,
expressed "profound sorrow" to the families. But Busche said she
wants an outright apology and an engineering fix.</TE>
<TE>   Aeronautical engineers generally try to design backup systems for
critical components, but the jackscrew unit on the MD-83 represents a
relatively rare instance in which a single failure can have
catastrophic consequences, said John Clark, head of the NTSB's safety
office.</TE>
<TE>   Federal standards dictate that such components can fail only once
in a billion flight hours, measured across a given design model. But
Clark said the plane's jackscrew failure came after about 100 million
flight hours, or about one-tenth of what the standard calls for.</TE>
<TE>   A redesign is needed to "take the issue off the table," Clark
said. "If something is going to be catastrophic, can we mitigate it?"</TE>
<TE>   NASA has already developed some fail-safe designs for spacecraft
that should be investigated to see if they can be adapted to
airplanes, he added.</TE>
<TE>   Other NTSB officials said their investigation showed that, with
proper maintenance, the MD-83 jackscrew can continue working for
decades.</TE>
<TE>   But maintenance practices vary considerably from airline to
airline.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators said that American Airlines has about 400 aircraft
with jackscrew units similar to the one on the Alaska plane and that
some are in close-to-pristine condition after nearly 30 years of
service. American requires frequent lubrication of the jackscrew.</TE>
<TE>   But Alaska sought -- and the FAA approved -- extensions of
lubrication intervals for its planes. Investigators said the last
attempt to add grease to the components on the doomed plane was
probably completely unsuccessful, because a port used to introduce
the lubricant was found to be blocked. Alaska also obtained several
extensions of the interval required for inspections of wear on the
jackscrew.</TE>
<TE>   FAA inspectors were overburdened and had little time to devote to
hands-on oversight of the airline, which was expanding rapidly,
investigator Rodriguez said.</TE>
<TE>   NTSB members agonized over recommending expensive changes that
could affect thousands of aircraft at a time when the industry is in
financial peril.</TE>
<TE>   The board called on the FAA to approve only new designs that have
a backup system.</TE>
<TE>   For planes currently in service, it recommended an engineering
review to "eliminate the catastrophic effects" of a failure. But it
stopped short of recommending that these planes be retrofitted.</TE>

<HD>2 Killed in Accidents on Valley Freeways</HD>
<DH>Woman jumps in front of a car in one incident, and man's
pickup truck rolls over in the other.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Two people were killed in separate accidents on San Fernando Valley
freeways Tuesday morning, including a woman who jumped in front of a
car in the fast lane of the Hollywood Freeway, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   The woman, whose identity was not known, was killed about 1 a.m.
when she suddenly leaped in front of a Mercedes-Benz sedan driven by
a 53-year-old man, according to the California Highway Patrol.</LD>
<LD>   "The driver said 'She just kind of jumped in front of my car,' "
said CHP Officer Francisco Villalobos, adding that it was not clear
whether the woman was trying to avoid the car or commit suicide.</LD>
<TE>   The driver, Simi Valley resident Donald Kittrell, was not injured
or cited. Paramedics pronounced the woman dead at the scene.</TE>
<TE>   Officers closed the freeway until 3:30 a.m. to investigate.</TE>
<TE>   In the second fatality, a man was killed when his pickup truck
rolled over the side of the westbound Ronald Reagan Freeway near
Topanga Canyon Boulevard in Chatsworth about 5:30 a.m., authorities
said.</TE>
<TE>   Greg Hoover, 40, of Reseda died at the scene. He was not wearing
his seat belt, authorities said. The circumstances of the crash are
under investigation.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, authorities Tuesday identified a man killed the day
before in a Ventura Freeway crash as 24-year-old Eagle Rock resident
Carlos Torres.</TE>
<TE>   Torres, who would have turned 25 on Christmas Day, was killed when
his white 2001 Honda went off the freeway and hit a tree, authorities
said.</TE>
<TE>   He was killed instantly in the accident, which occurred near
Hazeltine Avenue shortly before 6 a.m. Monday, the CHP said.</TE>
<TE>   CHP officers are trying to determine if Torres was racing and if
he collided with another vehicle before veering off the road.</TE>
<TE>   Witnesses reported that the Honda and a dark-colored sports car
were going about 100 mph just before the wreck, authorities said. The
sports car ran into the median about the same time the Honda went off
the road, witnesses told CHP officers. The driver of the sports car
reportedly pulled over for a moment, then drove away.</TE>

<HD>Sisters Critically Hurt in House Fire; 15 Cats Die</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>H.G. Reza</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two sisters were in critical condition Tuesday after they were caught
in a fire that damaged their Santa Ana home and killed 15 cats, fire
officials said.</LD>
<LD>   The sisters, 61 and 58, were treated for smoke inhalation and
minor burns in the Grossman Burn Center at Western Medical
Center-Santa Ana, said Santa Ana Fire Department Capt. Randy Black.
He declined to identify them.</LD>
<LD>   The fire in the 600 block of South Cypress began around 9:50 p.m.
Monday, Black said. Firefighters found the home engulfed in flames.
They got one of the women out of the house, and she told rescuers her
sister was trapped in a bedroom, Black said.</LD>
<TE>   "Firefighters were hampered by wrought-iron bars on the windows
and metal doors, but they managed to get the second victim out
through a window," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The sisters were rescued, but not the cats inside, Black said.
Firefighters did rescue two other cats and a dog, which were taken to
the city's animal shelter.</TE>
<TE>   The fire appeared to be accidental, but investigators were combing
the ruins Monday looking for a cause, Black said. Damage was
estimated at $110,000.</TE>

<HD>Hahn Tries to Make Nice With Secession Backers</HD>
<DH>Valley business leaders appreciate the effort but remain
skeptical of his pledges for change.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Beth Shuster</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Stepping into once-hostile territory, Los Angeles Mayor James K. Hahn
sought Tuesday to win over an influential San Fernando Valley
business group that had pushed recently to split from the rest of the
city.</LD>
<LD>   Afterward, leaders and other members of the group, the Valley
Industry and Commerce Assn., said they appreciated Hahn's decision to
speak to the organization but remained skeptical of his motives and
commitment to the Valley.</LD>
<LD>   "There is a real perception here that the Valley's a second-class
citizen in his mind," said Gregory Lippe, a Woodland Hills accountant
and director of the group. "He has to get over that perception."</LD>
<TE>   The group, which endorsed Valley secession, gave the mayor a tepid
reception, breaking into applause only once during his State of the
Valley speech. The atmosphere was quite different from the last major
speech Hahn delivered in the Valley -- the day after secession was
rejected -- for which the crowd was composed mostly of jubilant
supporters of the mayor.</TE>
<TE>   Largely quiet, the audience warmed Tuesday when Hahn turned to the
topic of public safety -- and his new police chief, William J.
Bratton.</TE>
<TE>   "I think all of you recognize that crime has an economic impact,"
Hahn said. "It impacts businesses."</TE>
<TE>   The mayor, who began his speech by saying that the Valley is
stronger than ever, said New York City tackled its crime problem in a
way that changed the perception of that city and boosted its economy.
Bratton is a former New York City police commissioner. Hahn said he
is requesting a report from the LAPD on its response times, which
appear to be increasing in parts of the city.</TE>
<TE>   Some believe that part of the blame for that may lie with the
LAPD's more flexible work schedule, which Hahn and the police union
sought.</TE>
<TE>   Though committing himself to public safety progress, Hahn also
attempted to strike a conciliatory tone with those he fought and
defeated during this year's secession campaigns. The effort, he said,
spurred needed change in City Hall.</TE>
<TE>   "The old bureaucracy, I think, has given way to a new and
reinvigorated Los Angeles," the mayor said.</TE>
<TE>   But there were some snickers around the room when he talked about
new efforts to improve access to City Hall, including a new toll-free
telephone number -- 311 -- for people to get information about city
services and departments.</TE>
<TE>   Secession, which failed citywide Nov. 5, "was a very good wake-up
call for the mayor and the whole City Hall," said Mike Quiroga,
president of Mike's Roofing Service in Van Nuys. "He really needs to
prove" that he will make good on his promises.</TE>
<TE>   Others agreed, saying Hahn must show the Valley that his promises
and programs for the Valley will not stop now that the election is
over. Hahn said that he has budgeted a record amount for tree
trimming and sidewalk and road repair, and that he has built and
renovated libraries, parks and police and fire stations.</TE>
<TE>   "Mayor Hahn is a very smart, very politically astute individual,"
said Larry Gray, a VICA board member and vice president of Spindler
Engineering Corp. in Van Nuys. "He is very capable of leading this
city into a much more business-friendly, much better direction.... He
has to prove that he can do it."</TE>
<TE>   Several people said the mayor must push business tax reform as a
major priority this year. They complained about a byzantine system
with cumbersome regulations, including what they say is an unfair
gross receipts tax.</TE>
<TE>   "It will be hard for him to show up next year and say, 'We're
still working on it,' " said Larry Kosmont, who owns a consulting
firm and who helped develop proposed changes in the city's tax code.
"It's time for all good governmental wishes to turn into good,
actual, implemented policies."</TE>
<TE>   Several political consultants, who are VICA members, said Hahn was
smart to appear before the group and, despite past differences, to
ask for its assistance.</TE>
<TE>   Now, they say, it's up to the Valley business leadership to accept
his offer of cooperation.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the mayor's made clear what he wants to do for the Valley
and the rest of the city," Harvey Englander said. "He's extending his
arm out. I'd be surprised if they didn't take it."</TE>
<TE>   After his speech, the mayor said that overcoming post-election
bitterness must come from all sides.</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody was mean to me today," he said, smiling. "Everyone was
very cordial."</TE>
<TE>   Some, however, viewed the event less as a genuine expression of
interest in the Valley than as Hahn's attempt to jump-start his
reelection campaign for 2005.</TE>
<TE>   "It sounded like he's running for his second term," said David
Hernandez, who ran for mayor of the Valley, only to lose that race
and see cityhood fail. "He's giving nice speeches, but the reality is
people want to see what he's doing."</TE>

<HD>Thousand Oaks Planners Approve Expansion of Hospital</HD>
<DH></DH>

<LD>After listening to more than six hours of comments from neighbors,
doctors and supporters of Los Robles Regional Medical Center,
Thousand Oaks planning commissioners early Tuesday approved a
$120-million expansion of the city's only major hospital.</LD>
<LD>   Speaker after speaker cited overcrowding at the 34-year-old
facility, which needs to modernize to meet state earthquake safety
mandates.</LD>
<LD>   Ventura County Supervisor Frank Schillo, a Thousand Oaks resident,
told of being diverted to an Oxnard hospital after a heart attack
last year because Los Robles was full.</LD>
<TE>   "The physical plant is inadequate," said Dr. Bernie Klein, medical
director of the 1,450-employee hospital. "We don't have enough beds;
we don't have enough room to provide sufficient care to our
patients."</TE>
<TE>   But dozens of residents whose homes surround the 196-bed main
hospital showed up to complain about increased traffic, noise, dust
and a loss of privacy if a four-story wing more than 70 feet tall is
built.</TE>
<TE>   Homeowners questioned whether Los Robles' long-term expansion
goals are appropriate, considering its location in a residential
neighborhood. They also challenged an environmental report that
concludes problems associated with adding 90 private rooms and a
520-space parking structure could be resolved without any long-term
negative effect on the neighborhood.</TE>
<TE>   "We all realize the hospital has to get bigger," said Anne Street,
a resident of nearby Sidlee Street. "Which way is it going to go? It
can only go up, which is going to be an even bigger problem for the
residents of Sidlee."</TE>
<TE>   Resident Marsha Richardson said the original hospital was
compatible with the neighborhood when it was built in the late '60s
but that extensive development on the grounds at Janss and Lynn roads
would be overwhelming and most likely depress property values.</TE>
<TE>   "Expanding the size does not fit in our neighborhood," she said.
"I'd very much like to see the expansion go somewhere else.... Go to
Westlake."</TE>
<TE>   But Bob Shaw, Los Robles' chief executive, said hospital officials
investigated expanding at another site and determined the price of
land in the east county is too expensive.</TE>
<TE>   Shaw said a more than 400% increase in the Conejo Valley
population since Los Robles opened forces the hospital to expand.</TE>
<TE>   From 1969 to 2001, officials said, the number of overnight
patients a year jumped from 2,340 to 13,095, the number of babies
born grew from 520 to 1,989, surgeries increased from 1,140 to 7,752
and the number of open-heart surgeries went from zero in 1969 to 346
last year.</TE>
<TE>   Hospital officials argue that the new wing is needed so the
hospital can provide private rooms. Doctors say it would enable them
to isolate contagious patients. And administrators say it also would
fill a need in affluent Thousand Oaks.</TE>
<TE>   Before casting his vote shortly after 1 a.m., Commissioner Randy
Hoffman told the audience he wished the medical center could move
from the neighborhood to a larger site with freeway access, but that
the need for extra beds and expanded medical services was too great
to delay approval.</TE>
<TE>   In response to concerns, the commission only approved constructing
the new wing's first three floors, and not a fourth floor, without
returning to the city for approval.</TE>
<TE>   Los Robles must monitor dust emissions during construction and use
vehicles and equipment with alternative fuels to reduce air
pollution.</TE>
<TE>   Administrators also are required to return to the city for
approval if they ever move to expand beyond 277 beds.</TE>
<TE>   "The challenge for the commission was to attempt to meet the needs
of the neighborhood ... while accommodating the need of the hospital
to maintain its quality of service to the community at large,"
commission President Jim Bruno said.</TE>
<TE>   Even with such conditions, some critics said more should be done
about pollution, building height and traffic safety.</TE>
<TE>   Residents have until Dec. 30 to pay a $500 application fee to
appeal the Planning Commission's decision to the City Council.</TE>

<HD>No Deal, No Water?</HD>
<DH>U.S., state say Imperial Irrigation District's allotment
may be cut unless the agency reverses its rejection of sale pact
vital to coast.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tony Perry and Rone Tempest</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After failing to entice the Imperial Irrigation District to sell part
of its huge water allotment, federal and state officials Tuesday
threatened to take it away -- unless the district rescinds its
rejection of a water sale vital to helping coastal Southern
California avoid future shortages.</LD>
<LD>   Assistant Interior Secretary Bennett Raley, the Bush
administration's point man on Western water issues, said the federal
government may declare that farmers in the Imperial Valley have been
wasting water, the first step toward reducing the amount of Colorado
River water -- 75% of the state's share -- flowing to desert
agriculture. Farmers would not be paid for their lost water.</LD>
<LD>   Raley suggested that Interior Secretary Gale Norton may discuss
such a step as early as Monday in a speech at a water convention in
Las Vegas.</LD>
<TE>   Raley also said that unless the Imperial district agrees to the
deal with the San Diego County Water Authority by Dec. 31, the
federal government will immediately end its practice of allowing the
Metropolitan Water District of Southern California to receive large
amounts of surplus water from the Colorado River beyond its
entitlement. The water deal was seen as key to reducing the state's
overuse of the river.</TE>
<TE>   "There will be no surplus" if the Dec. 31 deadline is not met,
Raley said.</TE>
<TE>   State officials, including former Assemblyman Bob Hertzberg (D-Van
Nuys), who acted as a mediator in negotiations in October involving
Imperial, the San Diego water authority, Metropolitan, and the
Coachella Valley Water District, said during the lengthy negotiations
that the Legislature might disband the Imperial district if it balked
at the deal.</TE>
<TE>   In rejecting a proposed 75-year, $2-billion deal with San Diego on
Monday night, Imperial board members said they bitterly resented what
they perceived as threats made by Raley, Gov. Gray Davis and others
in recent months to force them to sell their water at far below its
value.</TE>
<TE>   They also expressed fear that the pact would leave the district
responsible for hundreds of millions of dollars in restoration
projects at the Salton Sea. The sea depends on agricultural runoff
that would be substantially reduced if the water transfer were
approved and less water was being used on crops.</TE>
<TE>   District board members said they were expecting retaliation by
state and federal officials and were prepared to respond with
litigation if necessary.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been in the room when most of the threats have been made
against the [Imperial district] and I take them seriously," board
member Andy Horne said.</TE>
<TE>   'Cooler Heads'</TE>
<TE>   Board member Bruce Kuhn said, "I hope cooler heads will prevail."
He offered the prospect of a more limited deal, but the idea was
immediately rejected by Raley.</TE>
<TE>   Raley brushed off a suggestion that he has alienated the Imperial
Irrigation District in recent months by talking about cutbacks in the
district's water allocation or the possibility that individual
farmers could make side deals to sell their water even if the
district's governing board objects.</TE>
<TE>   "We've tried very hard over a few months not to say anything
offensive to the Imperial Valley," Raley said.</TE>
<TE>   Hertzberg, now a lawyer in Sherman Oaks, predicted Tuesday that
Imperial's intransigence may unleash punitive efforts by legislators
that could "substantially change the governmental structure of the
district."</TE>
<TE>   Bills are being prepared in Sacramento that would allow private
sales by farmers, thus undercutting the Imperial district's dominance
over water matters, Hertzberg said. "Bills introduced in the
Legislature and actions by the federal government could make things
much worse for them than they are now," he said.</TE>
<TE>   State Sen. Mike Machado (D-Linden), who is expected to be named
chairman of the Senate Agriculture and Water committee, predicted
hearings by the state water board into the Imperial district's lavish
use of water unless a compromise is reached by the Dec. 31 deadline.</TE>
<TE>   "I find it almost numbing that the Imperial district would reject
the contract and California could lose up to 15% of its water," said
state Sen. Jackie Speier (D-Hillsborough).</TE>
<TE>   Other states that use the Colorado River are demanding that
California reduce its dependence on the river and stop receiving
annual allocations of so-called surplus water that belong to other
states.</TE>
<TE>   The Dec. 31 deadline is part of a deal struck two years ago
between California and six other Colorado River states that use the
river.</TE>
<TE>   In exchange for signing the San Diego-Imperial deal, those states
were willing to give California an additional 15 years of surplus
water. The alternative is the "cold turkey" approach, with an
immediate loss of surplus water.</TE>
<TE>   Dennis Cushman, assistant general manager of the San Diego County
Water Authority, said, "We have three weeks to see if we can put
Humpty Dumpty together again."</TE>
<TE>   Water Surplus</TE>
<TE>   At risk is the 600,000 to 800,000 acre-feet of surplus water that
the Metropolitan Water District has been receiving for years and, in
turn, allocating to local agencies in six counties serving 17 million
people. An acre-foot of water is enough to supply two families for a
year.</TE>
<TE>   Metropolitan officials, although holding out hope that the San
Diego-Imperial deal can be rescued, said the district has enough
water in storage to offset the loss of surplus water for two years.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, the Metropolitan governing board voted to move ahead
with plans for seawater desalination, expanded ground-water storage,
and other water conservation measures. The actions had been planned
long before the Imperial vote Monday night.</TE>
<TE>   Even before Monday's vote, officials in other states were
petitioning the federal government not to back down on the Dec. 31
deadline.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, that insistence escalated, along with expressions of
incredulity that the Imperial Irrigation District could scuttle a
deal that was seven years in the making and that was tentatively
adopted by all four California water agencies involved on Oct. 15.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm amazed," said Pat Mulroy, general manager of the Las
Vegas-based Southern Nevada Water Authority. "How do you sit in the
negotiations and agree and then go home and vote against it? Imperial
is like the Keystone Kops of the water community."</TE>
<TE>   Tom Levy, general manager of the Coachella Valley Water District,
said Imperial "is playing with fire in terms of inflicting damage on
the California economy."</TE>
<TE>   Despite the escalating rhetoric, there were signs Tuesday that the
four parties may resume negotiations.</TE>
<TE>   Dennis Underwood, Colorado River specialist for the Metropolitan
district, and John Carter, lead attorney for the Imperial district,
were said to be arranging a meeting.</TE>
<TE>   In the Imperial Valley, few elected officials will admit to being
implacably opposed to selling some water.</TE>
<TE>   The county Board of Supervisors has voted to support a water deal
if certain safeguards are in the contract, including the option to
back out of the deal.</TE>
<TE>   When those conditions were not in the deal presented Monday,
individual board members expressed opposition.</TE>
<TE>   Ronald Gastelum, chief executive officer of the Metropolitan
district, said the district is ready to resume negotiations if
Imperial will provide a list of its complaints.</TE>

<HD>Navy Shell Explodes; Metal Chunk Falls at High School</HD>
<DH>One exploded while being dismantled and sent a chunk of
metal onto a school campus.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Kenneth Reich</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>More than 200 Navy shells were removed Tuesday from a Watts-area
recycling center after one exploded and launched a chunk of metal
onto the campus of neighboring Jordan High School.</LD>
<LD>   No students were in the schoolyard when the projectile, which
authorities said may have been a 155-millimeter shell, flew 1,500
feet before hitting around noon Monday, shortly before a student
break was to begin.</LD>
<LD>   The only reported injury was minor and was suffered by a visitor
at the Atlas Iron &amp; Metal Recycling Center.</LD>
<TE>   Alarmed officials evacuated more than 2,500 students from the
school, which remained closed Tuesday. It is scheduled to reopen
today.</TE>
<TE>   The shells had been certified as "inert," and were being
dismantled when the explosion occurred.</TE>
<TE>   Spokesmen for the Los Angeles Unified School District and the Los
Angeles County Sheriff's Department said an Army inspection team came
to the school after the accident and confirmed that all of the other
projectiles and scrap materials, believed to be from the Navy's San
Clemente Test Range, were inert.</TE>
<TE>   Navy spokesman Lee Saunders in San Diego said the shells had been
certified inert by the URS Corp., under contract to the Navy, before
being shipped to Atlas.</TE>
<TE>   But they were ordered removed, and the owner of the recycling
firm, Gary J. Weisenberg, said Tuesday that his facility will never
handle such material again. The shells were sent to a site in
Arizona.</TE>
<TE>   School Principal Dhal Lal said that last year a 55-gallon drum
came flying over the football field from the recycling center, and
that Atlas managers assured him it wouldn't happen again. An Atlas
spokesman said no such incident ever occurred.</TE>

<HD>Accord Boosts Flights at JWA</HD>
<DH>FAA must still sign off on agreement between Newport and
county that would modify and extend restrictions in 1985 court
settlement.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Dan Weikel</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Attempting to balance community concerns over noise with federal law,
the Orange County Board of Supervisors and the Newport Beach City
Council on Tuesday adopted a plan to add six gates and increase the
passenger cap at John Wayne Airport to 10.8 million people a year by
2011.</LD>
<LD>   If approved by the Federal Aviation Administration, the agreement
will modify and extend a landmark court settlement reached in 1985
that established noise limits, restricted the hours of airport
operation and limited passenger volume to 8.4 million a year. The
settlement, which ended a lawsuit by Newport Beach and community
groups over airport noise, expires in 2005.</LD>
<LD>   The revisions approved Tuesday would extend the settlement's terms
until 2015 and increase the number of gates from 14 to 20. The
maximum number of commercial flights would be raised from 73 to 85
per day.</LD>
<TE>   "This is not only important for Newport Beach, it is important for
the county," said Supervisor Jim Silva, whose district includes John
Wayne Airport. "It will provide long-term protection for the
community while adding airport capacity."</TE>
<TE>   The proposed changes must be approved by the FAA, which enforces
the Airport Noise and Capacity Act of 1990. The law prohibits local
government from restricting airport activity and would go into effect
if the court settlement expires in 2005.</TE>
<TE>   Newport Beach, the county, and airlines that operate at John Wayne
Airport have asked the FAA to determine if the proposed passenger cap
and gate additions comply with the federal law. FAA officials say
they will release their opinion in a few weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Before the vote, several critics of the proposal told the Board of
Supervisors that the plan will provide residents little protection
from noise and pollution caused by increased flights. Two opponents
suggested resurrecting the defeated proposal to build a commercial
airport at the El Toro Marine Corps Air Station to handle the
increase in projected air traffic for the county.</TE>
<TE>   Airport Commissioner Bruce B. Junor of Santa Ana said the plan
might end the friction between the county, Newport Beach and the FAA.
But, he said, much needs to be done to solve noise problems for
cities under the approach path to the airport.</TE>
<TE>   "This will create an intolerable situation for residents near the
flight paths," Junor said. "The noise area will be larger and more
people will be affected as the area grows. I must protest this
agreement."</TE>
<TE>   But Newport Beach City Councilwoman Norma Glover, who chairs a
committee to extend and modify the 1985 court settlement, disagreed
with Junor and other critics of the plan.</TE>
<TE>   "The proposal will protect the quality of life for those near the
airport," Glover said.</TE>
<TE>   "Based on analysis and study, I am confident the increases in
passengers and flights will not have significant noise and traffic
impacts."</TE>

<HD>For Giuliani, a Pot of Gold at the End of Sept. 11 Tragedy</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>Steve Lopez</AU>

<DL></DL>
<LD>On the long list of politicians, talking heads, authors and other
profiteers who turned the Sept. 11 massacre into gold, one man makes
all the others look like pikers, and he's on his way to Los Angeles
as we speak.</LD>
<LD>   Tragedy has been very, very good to Rudy Giuliani, who is using it
to transform himself from annoying brute to American hero. If he
keeps cashing in, who knows? Maybe the former New York mayor can turn
enough of a profit to run for president one day.</LD>
<LD>   Before Sept. 11, Giuliani was a cranky pol whose stock was so low,
he shrank away from a U.S. Senate fight with Hillary Clinton, and his
estranged wife wouldn't let him in the house.</LD>
<TE>   Today his crisis consulting firm rakes in millions of dollars a
month, he's got a $2.7-million book deal, and UCLA will be the latest
stop tomorrow night on a national tour that nets Giuliani a reported
$100,000 for a one-hour speech.</TE>
<TE>   That's $1,666 a minute, and projections for Giuliani's
speech-making haul in 2002 alone have run as high as $10 million. It
must be a terrific speech, and I didn't know if I could wait until
tomorrow. I thought I'd pass a hat and rent Rudy for five or ten
minutes tonight, but when I called his handlers I couldn't get
anywhere.</TE>
<TE>   Don't get me wrong. Giuliani handled that horrible day, and the
weeks that followed, with grace under pressure. But what can he say
in a one-hour speech that's worth two years of salary for a teacher
or a cop?</TE>
<TE>   I thought I'd call L.A. Police Chief Bill Bratton for an
explanation, since Bratton used to report to Giuliani in New York.
But our new chief, barely six weeks on the job, was moonlighting in
Israel, making a speech on traffic fatalities.</TE>
<TE>   Do these New Yorkers ever turn off the meter? And by the way, how
high a priority can traffic fatalities be right now in Israel?</TE>
<TE>   Having said that, I'd still ask Bratton to be my date for
Giuliani's speech if he makes it back from his jaywalking lecture in
time. No telling what might happen if you put these two guys in the
same room.</TE>
<TE>   Bratton, who also wrote a book about himself -- same as Giuliani
-- didn't have kind things to say about his former boss in print.
When New York's crime rate fell, they had a cat fight over who
deserved more huzzahs for cracking heads.</TE>
<TE>   "Rudy Giuliani, in his haste to sweep up every crumb of credit,
had disregarded reason, personality and honor," Bratton wrote.</TE>
<TE>   It's a shame there's bad blood between "America's Top Cop," as
Bratton's book is partially titled, and the "Mayor of America," as
Giuliani called himself in one of his two books this year. If they
put their heads together, they could come up with a mega-bestseller.
"Fast Buck Nation"? "Who Moved My Microphone"? "Effective Habits of
Highly Annoying People"?</TE>
<TE>   It'll cost $20 a head to hear Giuliani on Thursday night at Royce
Hall, which seats 1,800.</TE>
<TE>   Wait a minute.</TE>
<TE>   That makes for a gate of $36,000, and if Giuliani gets $100,000,
that leaves the state-funded university in a $64,000 hole at a time
when Gov. Gray Davis is swinging an ax at the budget, with plenty of
education casualties.</TE>
<TE>   Alas, there's nothing to worry about. UCLA told me the university
is co-sponsoring Giuliani's speech, but a private foundation is
cutting the check, and UCLA told me Rudy's fee is a private matter.</TE>
<TE>   "Leadership in Difficult Times" is the title of Giuliani's speech,
and by a remarkable coincidence, "Leadership" is the name of the new
book he's hawking.</TE>
<TE>   Some people find irony in this.</TE>
<TE>   "New Yorkers are facing a tremendous fiscal deficit, a lot of it
due to his eight years as mayor, and he's got a book out about
leadership?" cracks Newsday columnist Jimmy Breslin.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of people got killed Sept. 11 because of poor communication
between the fire and police departments," Breslin went on. "They had
been arguing about the problem for years, and it was Giuliani's
direct responsibility, and he did nothing about it. You don't hear
him mention that in his book."</TE>
<TE>   Ralph Waldo Emerson had an explanation.</TE>
<TE>   "All history becomes subjective," Emerson said. "In other words,
there is properly no history, only biography."</TE>
<TE>   Best-selling biography, at that.</TE>
<TE>   Look, it's not Giuliani's fault that he was mayor of New York when
the city was attacked, and there's nothing wrong with him taking bows
for a job well done.</TE>
<TE>   But if leadership is the issue, does he have anything useful to
say about New York's current financial flop, the nation's flagging
economy, the health-care crisis, or how we can expect to contain
terrorists while simultaneously lowering taxes and waging a war on
Iraq that could cost trillions?</TE>
<TE>   If character is the issue, how do you in good conscience make a
speech no one would listen to if not for the murder of nearly 3,000
people, and walk away with a nickel, let alone a pot of gold?</TE>

<CX>   Lopez column -- The Dec. 11 Steve Lopez column in the California
section incorrectly said that former New York Mayor Rudolph W.
Giuliani wrote two books this year. He has written one, called
"Leadership." "The Quotable Giuliani: The Mayor of America in His Own
Words" and "The Quotable Rudy Giuliani: The Wit and Wisdom of
America's Mayor" were written by other authors. Also, contrary to
what the column said, Giuliani's spokeswoman said Giuliani doesn't
refer to himself as "mayor of America."</CX>

<HD>Lowe's Store Gets OK From Ventura Council</HD>
<DH>The home improvement center will open across from the
Pacific View Mall in about a year.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Chawkins</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>By next December, Ventura will have a big-box home improvement store
across from the Pacific View Mall under a plan unanimously approved
by the City Council.</LD>
<LD>   The 135,000-square-foot Lowe's store will be located on the site
of a vacant Montgomery Ward store at Mills Road and Main Street in
the city's busy midtown area.</LD>
<LD>   Approval of the proposal Monday night capped a three-year effort
by the city. Through the years, officials have complained about the
hundreds of thousands of dollars in annual sales tax revenue flowing
to neighboring Oxnard, the nearest location of a Home Depot.</LD>
<TE>   However, some residents complained that the sites being considered
for a similar store in Ventura were too close to residential areas
and would increase congestion on already crowded roads.</TE>
<TE>   Council members expressed few reservations about the Lowe's
proposal Monday night.</TE>
<TE>   "In a perfect world," Councilman Carl Morehouse said, Lowe's would
build on a spot next to the Ventura Freeway, near the city's auto
mall.</TE>
<TE>   But he acknowledged that would be impossible because of high
costs, including road improvements.</TE>
<TE>   Bart Hollander, a Lowe's real estate executive, called the
approval "a win-win-win for everyone involved."</TE>
<TE>   Only two weeks ago, the deal appeared to be foundering. The
council rejected a plan to bring in Lowe's because the site's owner,
the Macerich Co., had failed to find an upscale retailer for one of
three remaining spots on the property.</TE>
<TE>   City officials had wanted a store such as Crate &amp; Barrel instead
of the drugstore Macerich tentatively had lined up.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, Macerich has agreed to sell the entire 13-acre site to
Lowe's for an undisclosed sum instead of holding on to the three
smaller parcels. And Lowe's agreed to confer with the city on
retailers for those spaces, giving the city an option to buy the
sites in three years.</TE>
<TE>   Only two residents spoke against the proposal Monday, objecting to
pollution from delivery trucks and increased traffic.</TE>
<TE>   Lowe's, the 13th-largest retailer in the U.S., has more than 825
stores and annual sales of $22 billion.</TE>

<HD>Murder Suspect Lied, Jury Told</HD>
<DH>Prosecutors give closing argument in trial of Reseda man
accused of killing girlfriend, father.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jean Guccione</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Reseda man accused of strangling his girlfriend, fatally shooting
his Emmy Award-winning father and trying to kill a housemate lied to
police repeatedly in an attempt to cover up his crimes and blame
others, prosecutors said Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Deputy Dist. Attys. Dale Cutler and Dmitry Gorin told jurors in
their closing argument that the evidence against Matthew Marky shows
that he went on a 10-hour "rampage of violence" that included two
murders and an attempted slaying.</LD>
<LD>   Prosecutors accused Marky of lying during his three days on the
witness stand, and giving friends and police false accounts of each
incident that do not match the evidence that was presented during the
three-week murder trial.</LD>
<TE>   "He kept coming up with new story after new story after new
story," Cutler said. "And he never got it right."</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors allege that Marky was enraged with his live-in
girlfriend, Maria Ruiz-Smeriglio, when he strangled her about 1 p.m.
Aug. 5, 2001. A few weeks earlier, she had kicked Marky while he lay
unconscious at her house and he wanted revenge, prosecutors said.</TE>
<TE>   Later that night, the 33-year-old defendant shot his father,
William Marky, in the eye as the men drank beers together in his
backyard, prosecutors said. They speculated that the elder Marky, who
was drunk for the first time after years of sobriety, confronted his
son about his role in Ruiz-Smeriglio's death.</TE>
<TE>   "After 10 years of not drinking, we know that he began drinking
that night," Gorin said. "Is it just the coincidence of Maria's death
or did he put two and two together?"</TE>
<TE>   After the shooting, prosecutors said Marky ran next door to
Ruiz-Smeriglio's house, where he tried to shoot Scott Hinkley, but
the gun misfired and Hinkley escaped into a bathroom, where he hid
until police arrived.</TE>
<TE>   Marky is charged with two counts of murder, attempted murder and
being a felon in possession of a firearm. Prosecutors also allege the
special circumstance of multiple murders. He faces life in prison
without parole. He had previously been convicted of making threats
against his wife.</TE>
<TE>   But Marky's defense attorney, James E. Blatt, argued that
prosecutors got it all wrong and that his client is not guilty of any
of the felony charges.</TE>
<TE>   Blatt accused the only witness to the alleged strangling, Ricky
Schaffer, a professional surfer, of killing Ruiz-Smeriglio, 47.</TE>
<TE>   The defense attorney argued that Schaffer was angry over an
earlier phone conversation that Ruiz-Smeriglio had with Schaffer's
estranged wife. Blatt said she lied to Schaffer's wife, telling her
that she and Schaffer were taking drugs together and having sex.</TE>
<TE>   Schaffer "had a motive just as powerful as the defendant's, even
more," Blatt argued.</TE>
<TE>   He said Marky killed his father in self-defense, after the older
man fired a shot from his handgun at his son. But prosecutors said
there is no evidence that the elder Marky fired the first shot or any
shot that night.</TE>
<TE>   The elder Marky, a sound technician, won an Emmy in 1982 for
outstanding achievement in film sound mixing for the television
series, "Hill Street Blues."</TE>
<TE>   The defense also disputed Hinkley's testimony about what he
witnessed, saying that he was hallucinating from crack cocaine and
that Marky never put a gun to Hinkley's head and pulled the trigger.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors said Marky has changed his story at least three times.
At first, he told police that he suspected Hinkley had killed his
father; then Marky said his father had committed suicide. Only later
did Marky admit to authorities that he was present in the backyard
when his father's handgun was fired.</TE>
<TE>   The jury of six men and six women will begin deliberations today
in the courtroom of Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge John S.
Fisher in Van Nuys.</TE>

<HD>Mattel-Backed Bills OKd as Gifts Came In</HD>
<DH>Votes occurred as tainted funds linked to the firm were
going to campaigns, file shows.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Patrick McGreevy</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>During the period that a Mattel Inc. executive laundered $120,714 in
political contributions to federal campaigns, the firm lobbied for,
and in some cases won, congressional approval of bills to ease U.S.
Customs procedures and reduce tariffs on certain toys, according to
government records.</LD>
<LD>   The executive, Fermin Cuza, also made some of the laundered
contributions to national Democratic Party committees and leaders at
a time when he was being discussed in the trade industry as a
possible contender for an appointment by President Clinton to head
the U.S. Customs Service.</LD>
<LD>   Cuza dropped out of contention for the federal post after Mattel
gave him a promotion. He resigned as senior vice president for Mattel
in March 2001 after the company told authorities he had made the
laundered political contributions without permission or knowledge of
the firm.</LD>
<TE>   A federal investigation concluded that Cuza and a Mattel political
consultant made or arranged contributions to more than two dozen
candidates and political organizations, then used Mattel funds to
reimburse themselves and others for those donations. That practice is
illegal because it disguises the actual source of money used to pay
for political campaigns. In the Cuza case, regulators have uncovered
no evidence that the recipients of the contributions knew that Mattel
was paying for them.</TE>
<TE>   "The biggest concerns are that laundering is used to circumvent
contribution limits, and it deprives the public of who is the true
source of the funds," said Jim Knox, executive director of California
Common Cause.</TE>
<TE>   The former Mattel executive declined direct comment through his
attorney, Mark E. Beck, who said his client thought making the
contributions "was necessary to get out there politically."</TE>
<TE>   Cuza signed an affidavit admitting that he used Mattel money to
reimburse himself for contributions made in his name and the names of
others. Beck denied that Cuza sought any favors in return, but he
declined to answer whether Cuza believed the contributions might help
his bid for the job of customs chief or advance legislation
beneficial to Mattel.</TE>
<TE>   Federal, state and city ethics investigations have resulted in
Mattel, Cuza and political consultant Alan M. Schwartz's agreeing to
pay $931,000 in fines for violations of campaign finance laws. The
state Fair Political Practices Commission is scheduled to vote Friday
on approving its settlement with the trio, and the Los Angeles Ethics
Commission will vote Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   The federal investigation found that between June 1996 and
November 2000 Cuza and Schwartz used a combined $120,714 in Mattel
funds to make contributions to 23 candidate committees, two party
committees and five political action committees, but used their names
and others' on the checks to disguise the fact that Mattel actually
paid for the contributions.</TE>
<TE>   Among the recipients of those donations were: Democratic Reps.
Richard Gephardt of Missouri; Loretta Sanchez of Garden Grove; Jane
Harman of Venice; Adam Schiff of Burbank; Brad Sherman of Sherman
Oaks; Hilda Solis of El Monte; Lois Capps of Santa Barbara; and
Juanita Millender-McDonald of Carson. Democratic Sens. Hillary Rodham
Clinton of New York and Barbara Boxer of California also received
contributions whose true source was Mattel funds.</TE>
<TE>   During that same time, Mattel directly contributed $219,000 to
national Democratic and Republican political committees.</TE>
<TE>   Federal law prohibits companies from contributing funds from their
corporate treasuries to candidates for federal office, but Cuza and
Schwartz circumvented that law by appearing to give the money as
individuals.</TE>
<TE>   Records indicate that some of those who received laundered
political contributions from Mattel, including California's U.S. Sen.
Dianne Feinstein, a Democrat, and Rep. Xavier Becerra (D-Los
Angeles), wrote bills backed by Mattel, although those officials and
others denied knowing the contributions were made with money from the
toy company.</TE>
<TE>   The federal filing specifically notes: "The commission found no
evidence that any of the recipient political committees were aware
that Mattel was the true source of the contributions."</TE>
<TE>   Mattel officials also said that whatever Cuza did involving the
contributions was done without the company's knowledge or permission.</TE>
<TE>   Company spokeswoman Jules Andres said, "There is simply no
connection between Mattel's business practices and a former
employee's misuse of company funds. We didn't know what was going on,
and as soon as we discovered it, we self-disclosed."</TE>
<TE>   The Federal Election Commission said in a statement that it found
no evidence that "any Mattel executive other than Cuza was aware that
the payments to Schwartz were for the purpose of reimbursing federal
political contributions."</TE>
<TE>   A former Customs Service official, Cuza joined Mattel in 1985.
From June 1997 until his resignation, Cuza was the firm's senior vice
president of International Trade and Worldwide Government Affairs --
a high-level post at a company that makes Barbie dolls in China and
imports other toys from Mexico, Thailand and elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   Cuza's duties, according to government ethics filings, included
monitoring U.S. trade policy, managing Mattel's worldwide customs
activities and representing Mattel's interests before customs-related
agencies and Congress.</TE>
<TE>   As part of his work, Cuza streamlined Mattel's customs clearance
procedures. He hired Schwartz to help with government relations.</TE>
<TE>   To smooth its imports, Mattel supported several pieces of
legislation and spent an average of $60,000 annually on lobbyists to
push the bills.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to lobbying the Consumer Product Safety Commission on
toy safety issues, the lobbying firms reported that Mattel backed a
number of bills, including:</TE>
<TE>   * HR 4444, which authorized permanent normal trade relations with
China. The bill passed in October 2000 with support from many
legislators who received laundered contributions from Cuza and
Schwartz. The bill received the public backing of thousands of
companies, including Mattel.</TE>
<TE>   * HR 4871, which passed in July 2000. It paid for a new computer
system for the Customs Service to streamline its procedures.</TE>
<TE>   * SB 2770, which was written by Feinstein and proposed to
temporarily suspend the duty on electronic machines principally
designed for the education of children. The bill was referred to the
Senate Finance Committee, where it stalled.</TE>
<TE>   * HR 3704, which was introduced by Becerra in February 2000. It
tried to exclude from a list of items subject to certain tariffs
specific toys including "dress-up outfits marketed year-round for the
amusement of children in role-play activity." The bill was supported
by Mattel and the Toy Assn. of Southern California, but did not
advance after it was sent to the House Ways and Means Committee and
subcommittee on trade.</TE>
<TE>   Becerra said he did not know that any of the contributions he
received were actually paid for by Mattel.</TE>
<TE>   He said that he has known Cuza and Schwartz for several years, but
that there was no link between his introduction of the bill and the
laundered political contributions he received.</TE>
<TE>   The congressman said he is mystified about what Cuza and Schwartz
were trying to accomplish, given that they could have had Mattel form
a political action committee and directly contribute to his campaigns
through that entity.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't understand what they did or why they did it," Becerra
said.</TE>
<TE>   The Federal Election Commission filing indicates that Becerra's
campaign committees for Congress and his run for Los Angeles mayor
made him one of the main benefactors of the laundered contributions:
He received $14,000 from 11 people and businesses that actually were
backed by Mattel money.</TE>
<TE>   Those who were listed as contributors to Becerra and who later
were reimbursed by Mattel included Cuza, Cuza's wife, his daughter
and his son-in-law.</TE>
<TE>   Becerra recalled that he met Cuza around 1997, when Cuza's name
was being floated as a possible head of the Customs Service.</TE>
<TE>   Although the congressman said he knew Cuza had raised money for
him -- and that Cuza worked for Mattel -- Becerra said he does not
grant access to constituents based on whether they are financial
supporters.</TE>
<TE>   By comparison, Feinstein received relatively little of Mattel's
laundered money. Schwartz donated $1,000 to her campaign committee,
then reimbursed himself with Mattel money. That is a small fraction
of Feinstein's overall campaign treasury, and aides to the senator
said it would not likely have caught her attention or theirs.</TE>
<TE>   "It probably would not register with anybody," said Mark Kadesh,
Feinstein's chief of staff.</TE>
<TE>   Kadesh said that Feinstein and her campaign did not know the money
was laundered, and that Feinstein routinely introduces trade
legislation if requested by California companies and it is not
controversial.</TE>
<TE>   Feinstein played an important role in the customs office, where
Cuza at one point hoped to land a position. In 1997, she actively
pushed for the ouster of customs chief George J. Weise, whom
Feinstein criticized for not adequately emphasizing the law
enforcement aspects of the work. Weise's resignation that year set
off a scramble of potential candidates wanting to be considered for
the job.</TE>
<TE>   Sam Banks, who ended up running the agency as acting commissioner
for a year, recalled that Cuza was among those whose names were
discussed early on.</TE>
<TE>   "Fermin Cuza had spent some time with customs early in his career
and he did a lot of international trade work," Banks said "It was
because he was so engaged that people in the trade industry saw him
as a good candidate."</TE>
<TE>   Many of the laundered political contributions arranged by Cuza
were made in 1997, including $10,000 each to the congressional
campaign committees set up by the Democratic and Republican parties.</TE>
<TE>   Cuza later dropped out of contention after he was given a
promotion by Mattel, and Feinstein backed another contender for the
customs chief job.</TE>

<HD>Odom Is Tantalizingly Close</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Elliott Teaford</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>DALLAS</DL>
<LD>Lamar Odom ran from baseline to baseline with gusto Tuesday at the
American Airlines Center, sweat pouring from his brow. He swished
jump shot after jump shot.</LD>
<LD>   Then he showered, changed into his street clothes and watched the
Clippers lose by 27 points to the Dallas Mavericks, sitting out his
22nd game to start this season. He hasn't played since going on the
injured list Jan. 24.</LD>
<LD>   It's going to be like this for a while longer.</LD>
<TE>   Odom's expected return date is believed to be Dec. 28, when the
Clippers play host to the Golden State Warriors, although it appeared
Tuesday that his sore right wrist and ankle were sufficiently sound
to allow him to play against the Mavericks. He has been practicing
with his teammates for more than a week, and by all accounts, he has
been dominating scrimmages.</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers are determined to stick to a conservative course with
Odom, whose 11-month absence from organized play is of some concern
to their medical staff.</TE>
<TE>   Odom injured his wrist after a fall last Dec. 16 against the
Detroit Pistons, but he tried to play through it until going on the
injured list. While rehabilitating his wrist, Odom stepped on a stray
basketball while trying to dunk with his left hand and sprained his
right ankle.</TE>
<TE>   "They keep telling me he'll be back right after Christmas," Coach
Alvin Gentry said. "He's getting stronger every day."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Michael Olowokandi is set to come off the injured list
after sitting out the required five games because of tendinitis in
his left knee. Olowokandi is expected to play Friday against the San
Antonio Spurs.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Washington wide receiver Wilbur Hooks Jr. was booked into jail for
investigation of hit-and-run and reckless driving after his car
crashed into another vehicle.</LD>
<LD>   Police said Hooks, 22, of Kenmore, Wash., was traveling more than
80 mph in a 30 mph zone early Monday when his Volkswagen Passat ran a
red light and collided with another car at an intersection.</LD>
<LD>   A 19-year-old woman passenger in the other car suffered chest
injuries and was hospitalized, police said. The 46-year-old man who
was driving suffered back and knee pain but was not hospitalized.
Damage to the car was estimated at $8,000.</LD>
<TE>   Police said they found Hooks two blocks away, and he acknowledged
being involved in the crash.</TE>
<TE>   Hooks had 12 catches for 138 yards and one touchdown and was
Washington's ninth-leading receiver. He also played as a safety the
last two games and had 16 tackles.</TE>

<TE>   Guy Morriss, 51, will be introduced as Baylor's new coach today.
He leaves Kentucky after going 9-14 in two seasons. The Fort Worth
Star-Telegram reported that Morriss had agreed to a five-year,
$5.5-million contract.... The Detroit Free Press reported that
Washington Redskin defensive coordinator Marvin Lewis has been
offered a five-year, $7.5-million offer to become Michigan State's
coach. Lewis, 44, is one of the NFL's highest-paid assistants,
earning $800,000 a year. If he accepts Michigan State's offer, he
would be one of the highest-paid coaches in college football.</TE>
<TE>   Kentucky junior defensive tackle Dewayne Robertson announced he
will forego his final season of eligibility and enter the NFL
draft.... Florida junior quarterback Rex Grossman said he won't
decide whether to give up his final year of eligibility and declare
himself eligible for the NFL draft until after the Gators' Jan. 1
game against Michigan in the Outback Bowl.... Injured Colorado
running backs Chris Brown (bruised sternum) and Bobby Purify
(sprained ankle) are questionable for the Dec. 28 Alamo Bowl against
Wisconsin.</TE>
<TE>   Arizona tight end Justin Levasseur will face trial on Feb. 3 in
Cambridge, Ill., after he was charged with carrying 87 pounds of
marijuana in his car. A judge set a pretrial hearing for Jan. 10 for
Levasseur and accused accomplice Max Necochea of Mission Viejo in the
felony drug trafficking case.... Maine linebacker Stephen Cooper did
not violate NCAA rules when he participated in four games after being
investigated for possession of steroids, the university said.... The
Fiesta Bowl's decision to allow beer sales at the game is under fire,
and Tempe, Ariz., officials are expected to ask for more money from
the Fiesta Bowl to cover costs for additional security.</TE>

<KH>DUCK REPORT</KH>
<HD>Olausson to Reach Milestone Tonight</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Lonnie White</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sometime during the first period of tonight's game against the
Washington Capitals, the Mighty Ducks will salute defenseman Fredrik
Olausson, a 15-season veteran who will be playing in his 1,000th NHL
game, with a video tribute.</LD>
<LD>   "I won't be choked up, but I do know that's an accomplishment,"
said Olausson, who played on his first Stanley Cup championship team
last season with Detroit. "To play 1,000 games, I guess is some kind
of milestone.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm proud to be a part of the league this long, but in the end,
it's just a number. What I'm going to appreciate more is what we can
accomplish on the ice because the ultimate goal for any player in the
National Hockey League will always be the Stanley Cup."</LD>
<TE>   Having a veteran such as Olausson around has been a plus for
first-year Anaheim Coach Mike Babcock.</TE>
<TE>   "Just think about it. He's played over 10 years, playing every
game," Babcock said. "It's absolutely unbelievable how long it takes
to play 1,000 games. He obviously has been a great pro and since he's
been ... getting his conditioning back, he's been getting better and
better for us. Not just on the ice, but the entire dynamics of the
team."</TE>
<TE>   Scott Young of Dallas is also at 999 games and will join Olausson
tonight in becoming the 183rd and 184th players to reach the
1,000-game milestone.</TE>
<TE>   After a slow start, Olausson, who scored his first goal against
Nashville on Sunday, has been playing well lately. He's glad to still
be able to contribute.</TE>
<TE>   "You can never take this game for granted," said Olausson, who has
146 goals, 430 assists and 438 penalty minutes in his career. "I've
been stubborn enough by myself to keep playing this long. But you
have to have some people believe in you. I've never tried to look too
far ahead from my first year up until now, my 16th year."</TE>

to return to the lineup and could play for the Ducks. Defenseman
Ruslan Salei is doubtful because of a back strain, which has
sidelined him the last two weeks. Captain Paul Kariya did not

<HD>Starr Knows Dangers of Rematch</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Eric Stephens</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Logic says Lake Balboa Birmingham High has little chance against
Woodland Hills Taft in the City Section championship game at 8 p.m.
Friday in the Coliseum. Taft (13-0) easily handled the Patriots
(10-3), 30-6, to win the West Valley League title less than a month
ago.</LD>
<LD>   But Taft Coach Troy Starr knows the title game doesn't always
follow form. He was a 24-year-old assistant at Carson in 1987 when
the unthinkable happened.</LD>
<LD>   "The thing I remember most is that our kids were so
overconfident," Starr said of the Colts' game that year against
Granada Hills. "We had 11 Division I players on that team. It was as
much of a setting for an upset as you could possibly have."</LD>
<TE>   Ranked No. 2 in the nation, Carson had defeated Granada Hills,
42-14, earlier in the season. But in the championship game, Jeremy
Leach threw three touchdown passes and the Highlanders won, 27-14, in
one of the greatest upsets in City title-game history. The smallest
margin of victory for Taft, The Times' sixth-ranked team, has been 12
points this season. The Toreadors have trailed in only three games
and only once in the fourth quarter.</TE>
<TE>   But if history is an indicator, don't count Birmingham out.</TE>
<TE>   In three of the last four years, the team that has lost the
regular-season contest has won the rematch in the title game. The
last time a champion won both meetings was in 1995, when Dorsey
defeated San Pedro, 35-28, during the season and, 10-8, in the title
game.</TE>
<TE>   Going back further, eight of the last 11 title games that were
rematches have been won by the team that lost during the regular
season.</TE>
<TE>   Birmingham Coach Ed Croson said the pressure is all on Taft. His
players, naturally, agree.</TE>
<TE>   "Because they've been there before, they probably think they're
going to win," linebacker Eric Ochoa said. "This is where it counts."</TE>
<TE>   The Patriots' three losses have come to Sherman Oaks Notre Dame,
Newhall Hart and Taft -- teams playing for section titles this
weekend. Only Taft controlled them from start to finish. That loss
doesn't sit well with Dennis Keyes, a senior running back who has
been part of the renaissance at Birmingham in the three years Croson
has been coach.</TE>
<TE>   "We can play a lot better than what we showed that night," Keyes
said. "That wasn't the real Birmingham team. We came out a little
overconfident because we had beaten them the last two years."</TE>
<TE>   Starr said his players won't have a problem with being too
confident, saying they are "humbled every day" in practice. Besides,
there are painful memories of last year's heartbreaking loss to
Dorsey to erase.</TE>
<TE>   Some at the school might also remember that Taft won its only
title in 1998 by defeating Banning, a team it had lost to, 41-13,
during the season.</TE>
<TE>   Banning Coach Ed Lalau has been on both sides of title-game
rematches. He was an assistant for Banning's 1998 team that lost, and
he was in charge when the Pilots stunned Carson two years ago. They
had lost to the Colts, 48-18, during the regular season.</TE>
<TE>   "The biggest thing for me was to get the kids to believe they
could" win the second game, Lalau said. "Pound for pound, we
shouldn't have won that game, but that night we shined at the right
time."</TE>
<TE>   Granada Hills co-Coach Tom Harp said the memory of its 19-14 loss
to Dorsey in the title game last year might help Taft not look past a
team it has already defeated this year.</TE>
<TE>   "When you win big, it's hard to tell a team that this team you're
playing against and just got through beating is good," Harp said.
"But this game, it's a different story for Taft because of last
year."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Taft-Birmingham matchup is the first City title game between
two San Fernando Valley teams since Granada Hills defeated San
Fernando, 38-28, in 1970.</TE>
<TE>   "It's really good for the Valley," Sylmar Coach Jeff Engilman
said. "The Valley has always taken second fiddle to the Marine
League."</TE>
<TE>   Harp said there is more parity in the section and Birmingham's
ascent in the last three years is proof. The Marine and Coliseum
leagues "aren't the only show in town," he added.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Granada Hills (9-4) will play Harbor City Narbonne (5-8) at 5 p.m.
Friday in the Coliseum in the championship game of the Invitational
playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   "Naturally we're a little disappointed that we couldn't make the
Championship Division," Harp said. "But this has given our young kids
an opportunity to continue working on their game, and playing in the
Coliseum is something the kids can look forward to."</TE>
<TE>   Narbonne assistant Josh Waybright said he wasn't sure the Gauchos
would qualify for the playoffs after a 2-8 record in the regular
season. They are aiming for their second consecutive Invitational
championship.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a second chance for us," Waybright said. "To the kids'
credit, they kept battling."</TE>

<LD>Ed Lalau said he will decide by Dec. 19 whether to remain as football
coach at Wilmington Banning as he deals with the death of his mother.</LD>
<LD>   Sia Lalau, 68, died last Wednesday of complications resulting from
surgery the previous week to remove a cancerous tumor from her
stomach. Lalau said he picked that date because it is right before
the winter break.</LD>
<LD>   "She never woke up," Lalau said. "At the time of her surgery, I
decided to step down to help in caring for her. But now that she's
passed away, I don't know."</LD>
<TE>   Lalau is 23-24 in five seasons at Banning.</TE>

<HD>Birmingham Receiver Suspended for Title Game</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Eric Stephens</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Lake Balboa Birmingham High receiver Bennie Ward has been suspended
by City Section officials for Friday's Championship Division title
game against Woodland Hills Taft because of his involvement in an
altercation near the end of the Patriots' 34-20 semifinal victory
over Gardena last Friday.</LD>
<LD>   Players and coaches from both teams were involved in a skirmish on
the Birmingham sideline after Gardena players took exception to their
punt returner, Jason Lewis, being hit after he was out of bounds and
knocked over a bench with 3:53 left.</LD>
<LD>   Punches and heated words were exchanged but no players were
ejected.</LD>
<TE>   City Section administrator Jeff Halpern would not identify the
suspended player, but Birmingham officials confirmed it was Ward.</TE>
<TE>   Birmingham Athletic Director Rick Prizant is upset that the
section's ruling was based on a videotape supplied by a Taft coach
who was scouting the game.</TE>
<TE>   In turn, Prizant has formally accused Taft of a rules violation by
allowing an eighth-grader to be on the Toreadors' sideline during its
semifinal victory over Venice. Interscholastic Athletics Committee
Rule 131-1 prohibits persons not of high school age from being on the
bench or sideline during a playoff game.</TE>
<TE>   The eighth-grader is Jimmy Clausen, who is deciding between
enrolling at Taft or Westlake Village Oaks Christian. Jimmy's
brother, Casey, is a quarterback for the University of Tennessee.</TE>
<TE>   Prizant, who faxed his complaint to Taft Principal Myra Fullerton
and the section office Tuesday, is alleging undue influence.</TE>
<TE>   Halpern said the matter is being handled between the schools.
Fullerton was out of her office Tuesday afternoon and unavailable for
comment.</TE>
<TE>   Taft Athletic Director Mark Drucker said he has not seen the
complaint and he didn't see coaches talking with Clausen at the game.</TE>
<TE>   "As far as who talked to him," Drucker said, "is that recruitment
or is he there just to watch a game? Who can tell that?"</TE>

<KH>WRESTLING PREVIEW</KH>
<HD>Eagles Are Set for Holiday Season</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Peter Yoon</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Josh Holiday sees two ways he could react to the team he has
inherited. He can wince because of the high expectations he will face
as its first-year coach or simply smile.</LD>
<LD>   Great expectations are nothing new for the Santa Ana Calvary
Chapel wrestling program, so Holiday chooses the latter.</LD>
<LD>   "I like what I've stepped into," said Holiday, who takes over for
Joey Coughran and is Calvary Chapel's third wrestling coach in as
many years.</LD>
<TE>   What's not to like?</TE>
<TE>   The Eagles, winners of seven state titles from 1993-01, finished
fifth in the state last season and have their entire lineup back.
They are the class of the Southern Section this season and should
make a run at another state championship.</TE>
<TE>   "They are definitely out in front of everyone else," said Don
Garriott, coach of North Torrance. "For anyone [in the section] to
beat them, some breaks are going to have to go the other team's way."</TE>
<TE>   Senior Joe Williams, arguably the best wrestler at any weight
class in the state, returns and he is looking for a second
consecutive state title. Williams, The Times' wrestler of the year
last season, also won Masters and Five Counties titles last season at
171 pounds. He will wrestle at 189 this season.</TE>
<TE>   Mario Estrada, another senior, won a Masters title as a sophomore
and finished seventh in the state last season at 119 pounds, the same
weight he will wrestle at this season. Senior Yuri Kalika moves to
171 pounds after finishing fifth in the state at 160, and sophomore
Bryan Osuna will be at 112 pounds after an eighth-place finish in the
state at 103.</TE>
<TE>   Junior Patrick Aleksanyan, who will wrestle at 130, qualified for
state last season at 125 pounds but didn't place among the top eight.
Junior David Juaregi and senior Ryan Byng also return after missing
the state meet by one match.</TE>
<TE>   What it all adds up to is a loaded lineup with high hopes.</TE>
<TE>   "Our expectations are no different than they always are," said
Holiday, who was part of Calvary Chapel's state title team in 1994
and won individual state titles in 1994 and 1995. "We want to win
everything we possibly can. There is a strong wrestling tradition at
this school that we don't want to break."</TE>
<TE>   Even with such a strong lineup, winning everything will be a tough
task. Calvary Chapel will wrestle only 10 times before the Southern
Section playoffs begin. Take away four Pacific Coast League meets,
which should be cakewalks for the Eagles, and that leaves only six
meetings on the mat.</TE>
<TE>   But those matches give Calvary Chapel one off the most difficult
schedules of any team in the state. The Eagles will wrestle at the
Clovis West dual meet tournament, the Reno Tournament of Champions,
the Doc Buchanan tournament at Fresno Buchanan High and the Five
Counties Invitational at Fountain Valley High -- all among the top
tournaments in the nation.</TE>
<TE>   Calvary Chapel's dual meets will be against defending state
champion Bakersfield and cross-town rival Santa Ana, second to the
Eagles in the section this season.</TE>
<TE>   "The schedule was made before I got here," Holiday said. "I would
have liked at least one smaller tournament, but we have to wrestle
our schedule and that's OK. We want the best competition."</TE>
<TE>   Holiday hopes he's still smiling when it's over.</TE>

<LD>A preseason look at the top wrestling teams in the Southland:</LD>
<LD>   1. Santa Ana Calvary Chapel (SS-Div. I, Inland)</LD>
<LD>   Undisputed top team in Southern California is among the best in
the nation. State champion Joe Williams leads group of four returning
wrestlers who placed in the state finals.</LD>
<TE>   2. Santa Ana (SS-Div. I, Southern)</TE>
<TE>   Hugo Guzman, a 103-pound dynamo, and 145-pounder Scott Becerra
were state qualifiers last season and among a group of five Masters
qualifiers returning for the Saints.</TE>
<TE>   3. North Torrance (SS-Div. II, Central)</TE>
<TE>   Saxons have Matt Bautista at 103 pounds and Danny Brannon at 189
among seven returning Masters qualifiers. Redondo transfers Mario and
David Acosta add more scoring punch.</TE>
<TE>   4. Temecula Valley (SS-Div. I, Coastal)</TE>
<TE>   Seven seniors graduated, but Golden Bears always reload and still
have Masters qualifiers Steve Saric (112 pounds), Morgan Atkinson
(130) and Jay Bowman (135).</TE>
<TE>   5. Atascadero (SS-Div. I, Northern)</TE>
<TE>   Anyone favored in Pac-Five League should be favored in just about
any meet. Joe Belmonte, Glenn Rhees and Trevor Tice lead the way for
the Greyhounds.</TE>
<TE>   6. Rosemead (SS-Div. II, Eastern)</TE>
<TE>   Panthers will be young this year, but Masters champion Manuel

<TE>   Masters qualifiers Artie Zuniga (112 pounds), Paul Paez (125) and
Louie Barcelo (130) return, and Nick Leon (140) leads a group a three
very good freshmen.</TE>
<TE>   9. Orange El Modena (SS-Div. I, Eastern)</TE>
<TE>   Ten starters return from team that won Central Division
championship last season. State qualifier Daniel Contreras and

<HD>Getting Her Shot</HD>
<DH>Goaltender Danielle Dube will start for Ice Dogs tonight</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Lonnie White</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The girl who began her career playing hockey with boys is playing
with men now.</LD>
<LD>   Danielle Dube, who grew up in Vancouver, Canada, is a goaltender
for the Long Beach Ice Dogs of the West Coast Hockey League.</LD>
<LD>   A publicity stunt? Hardly. Dube, 26, earned her spot and will make
her first start of the season tonight when the Ice Dogs play San
Diego at Long Beach Arena.</LD>
<TE>   In Long Beach's season opener, Dube played eight minutes in a 6-0
loss at San Diego and gained her teammate's respect by stopping 12 of
13 shots.</TE>
<TE>   "It was one of those games when nothing was going right, but she
came in and held the fort down," Long Beach veteran Roger Maxwell
said about Dube. That game was the realization of a dream for the
5-foot-8, 145-pound Dube.</TE>
<TE>   "I was nervous but a good nervous," she said. "The way it happened
was perfect. I'm glad [Long Beach Coach] Kevin [Kaminsky] didn't do
the publicity thing and give me some big start with all the press
there."</TE>
<TE>   With veteran Mike Buzak and B.J. Boxma, Long Beach has a solid 1-2
punch in goal, but Boxma is on assignment from Manchester, the Kings'
American Hockey League affiliate.</TE>
<TE>   Kaminsky wasn't sure whether he would keep three goaltenders to
start the regular season, so he'd initially included Dube among the
players released on the final cut-down day.</TE>
<TE>   Dube called her parents in Vancouver with the disappointing news,
then loaded her pickup truck and started north on Interstate 5.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a conversation that we've had many times in the past,"
said Dube's father, Rick, a fireman for more than 20 years. "You feel
sad because you know it's a tough situation. You just try and keep
her spirits up."</TE>
<TE>   Dube had given up one goal in 30 minutes of preseason play.</TE>
<TE>   "I was obviously disappointed," she said. "When I started driving
home, I was unsure what I was going to do with my life."</TE>
<TE>   She didn't have to think about it for long, though. Before she got
past Redding, Kaminsky was on her cell phone, saying he had made a
mistake.</TE>
<TE>   "That was a shocker," Dube said. "He didn't promise me anything.
He just said that he expected me to work hard to get better every
day."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   As a kid growing up in East Vancouver, Dube started playing hockey
when she was 4 and was a goaltender at 6. Her neighborhood had no
girls' program, so Dube joined the boys' league and quickly became
the best goalie on her team.</TE>
<TE>   Dube's teams kept winning as she and her reputation grew. She was
Paul Kariya's teammate with the Penticton Panthers of the British
Columbia Junior A circuit.</TE>
<TE>   But when it came time to move to a higher junior level, Dube was
left behind.</TE>
<TE>   "Growing up, I was always the No. 1 goalie," she said. "I didn't
even have a backup.... I would get tryout offers from scouts, but
they wouldn't know that I was a girl because of my name being
French.... I would go to meet them and then they would tell me, they
can't help me because I'm a girl."</TE>
<TE>   So Dube turned to women's hockey, advancing to the national team.</TE>
<TE>   She played on gold-medal winning teams at the 1995 and 1996
Pacific Rim tournaments, was the country's top-ranked woman
goaltender in 1996 and 1997, and won a gold medal with Canada at the
1997 World Championships. But she always returned to men's hockey,
which led her to short stints with the Bakersfield Fog of the WCHL
and the Central Texas Stampede of the Western Professional Hockey
League.</TE>
<TE>   "I enjoy the men's game a lot more," Dube said. "It's a different
style game. It's a harder game, a faster game. That's what I grew up
playing, so that's what I like."</TE>
<TE>   Dube's relationship with the Canadian national team began to sour
in 1998 when she broke her collarbone and had to sit out nearly a
year. She went back to men's hockey, playing nearly two years in
various leagues in Germany and North America, before giving the
women's game one last shot, hoping to play in the 2002 Salt Lake City
Olympics.</TE>
<TE>   It turned out to be a frustrating experience.</TE>
<TE>   "When I went back, I was told that I might be the best goaltender
there but I won't make the team," Dube said. "No matter what I did on
the ice, I still will not make the team.</TE>
<TE>   "It was tough not to be there, winning a gold medal, when I know
that with my abilities, I should have been there.... But I understand
and appreciate the honor that I've had in being able to play for my
country. I won gold medals with Canada."</TE>
<TE>   But when Dube again set her sights on men's hockey, , no one was
knocking on her door. In fact, no one was even taking her calls.</TE>
<TE>   She turned to the Internet and eventually contacted Rick Adams,
co-owner and managing partner of the Ice Dogs.</TE>
<TE>   "I was very impressed with her tenacity," Adams said. "She seemed
to be having a hard time getting an opportunity ... because of her
gender. I told her that I would give her an opportunity but it would
be done purely based on merit and, ultimately, it would be
[Kaminsky's] decision if she made the team."</TE>
<TE>   Dube sent a tape to Kaminsky, who liked what he saw and invited
her to camp.</TE>
<TE>   "I phoned and phoned so many people and heard, 'No, no, no!' so
many times," Dube said. "But I didn't give up." *</TE>
<TE>   Thanks to her previous experiences on men's teams, Dube has
adjusted well to her new team. She dresses in a separate room at the
Long Beach Arena and before or after her teammates on the road.</TE>
<TE>   "It's an adjustment for everybody," Buzak said. "You have to be a
little bit more aware of what you're doing, in regards to running
around and being a yahoo. But she's really great because she's used
to it. Nothing really bothers her.... She makes it quite easy for all
of us in the locker room."</TE>
<TE>   Although Dube does not get to suit up for every game, she hasn't
been discouraged about her lack of playing time and treats every
practice as a new challenge. She is appreciating the moment and so is
her family.</TE>
<TE>   "There's been many discouraging times but she's never lost her
interest," said Dube's mother, Anne Marie. "She really loves hockey
and I'm so happy with the coach and the owner who have accepted her,
finally. Even though she's not getting any ice time now, she's so
happy being there. This is what she's always wanted."</TE>

<LD>She hasn't made much noise on the track lately, but Aetha is the
answer to a trivia question.</LD>
<LD>   The daughter of Hermes is the last filly or mare to have beaten
Bush Triumph. In breaking her maiden on Aug. 7 at Del Mar, Aetha
finished seven lengths ahead of the daughter of Trempolino, who was
the 7-5 favorite.</LD>
<LD>   Since that afternoon, Bush Triumph has been perfect. Owned by Mr.
and Mrs. Leonard Fishelberg and trained by Mike Mitchell, the
4-year-old filly has rattled off five consecutive victories -- one on
dirt and four on the turf.</LD>
<TE>   Bush Triumph will try to keep her roll going today against five
others in Hollywood Park's seventh race, a $58,000 allowance at 1
1/16miles on the grass.</TE>
<TE>   The 2-1 second choice on Russ Hudak's morning line, Bush Triumph
will have to contend with a Bobby Frankel-trained, Ed Gann-owned
entry.</TE>
<TE>   Nunatall will race coupled with Final Destination, who is making
her first start in this country after winning three of nine in New
Zealand, and she is dropping out of a Grade I race.</TE>
<TE>   Race of the day: Bluesthe- standard will try for his 10th win in
16 starts and fifth in seven tries at Hollywood Park in today's
fourth, a $40,000 claimer at seven furlongs.</TE>
<TE>   Who's hot: Alex Solis. The jockey was hot in Inglewood last week
and begins today's racing second in the standings. He has 26 winners
at the meet, two behind Laffit Pincay.</TE>
<TE>   Who's not: Alfredo Miranda. The jockey is one for 52 at Golden
Gate Fields.</TE>
<TE>   Exotically speaking: A place pick all singling Alpine Singer in
the first, using Encino Ump and Native Vitality in the second,
singling Eric Da Bomb in the third and Bluesthestandard in the
fourth, Dream Machine and Slewping in the fifth, Gambler's Mark,
Logician and Granny's Car in the sixth, singling the Nunatall-Final
Destination entry in the seventh and Pennysenyen in the eighth.</TE>
<TE>   Winners: Previous day/meet total: 3/64. Money: Previous day/meet
total: $23.60/$366.20. Total money bet: $426.</TE>

<LD>The Kings rank ninth in value among NHL teams at $205 million,
according to a review of club evaluations and profit margins by
Forbes magazine. That's nearly double the value of the Mighty Ducks,
who rank 25th at $111 million.</LD>
<LD>   On a reported revenue base of $81 million, the Kings made a
$7.1-million profit last season, more than all but two U.S. teams,
the magazine reported in its Dec. 23 issue. The Toronto Maple Leafs
made $24.2 million, the Minnesota Wild $12.1 million and the
Nashville Predators $9 million.</LD>
<LD>   The Ducks, on a revenue base of $48 million, lost $13.7 million in
the 2001-02 season, more than all but the Washington Capitals, who
lost $25.4 million, and the St. Louis Blues, who absorbed an
$18-million shortfall.</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Jason Allison left Tuesday's morning skate early, complaining of
tightness in his injured right knee, but was in the lineup against
the Predators. "He thinks it's just [from] the long flight," Coach
Andy Murray said.... Lubomir Visnovsky, suffering from back spasms,
did not make the trip. Murray is hopeful that the defenseman will be
able to play this weekend.... Steve Heinze, whose penalty led to the
decisive goal Saturday night in a 4-2 loss to the Columbus Blue
Jackets, was benched Tuesday night. He has not scored a goal in four
games since his recall from the minors last month. Dating to Jan. 15,
his goal-scoring drought has reached 31 games.</TE>

<HD>The Rematch Is All Kings</HD>
<DH>Only five days after being upset by the lowly Predators,
they score twice in the first period and overcome previous
complacency in 3-0 victory.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jerry Crowe</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>NASHVILLE</DL>
<LD>Owners of the worst record in the Western Conference, the Nashville
Predators have won fewer games than any other NHL team.</LD>
<LD>   But that doesn't mean they're incapable of surprising elite
opponents.</LD>
<LD>   Their upset victims have included some of the best teams in the
West, among them the Detroit Red Wings, Colorado Avalanche and Dallas
Stars.</LD>
<TE>   Last Thursday, they surprised the Kings at Staples Center.</TE>
<TE>   Luckily for the Kings, who had a seven-game unbeaten streak
against the Predators ended that night, they had to wait only five
days for a rematch.</TE>
<TE>   More easily convinced this time that defeating the fifth-year
expansion team would require more than a token effort, they earned a
3-0 victory over the Predators on Tuesday night in front of 10,208 at
the Gaylord Entertainment Center.</TE>
<TE>   "We can't be losing to teams that are below us," defenseman Aaron
Miller said. "I think what happens sometimes is teams don't give them
enough respect, and if you do that against any team in this league,
they're going to bury you.</TE>
<TE>   "And that's what happened in the last game against them, so I
think we came out a little bit harder and gave a little better
effort."</TE>
<TE>   In the first game of a two-game trip that ends tonight against the
Dallas Stars, the Kings dominated special teams play and got 19 saves
from goaltender Felix Potvin, whose shutout was his third of the
season and 28th of his career.</TE>
<TE>   After giving up two power-play goals in Thursday night's 3-2 loss
to the Predators and two more Saturday night in a 4-2 loss to the
Columbus Blue Jackets, the Kings killed nine penalties, five in the
first period.</TE>
<TE>   Ziggy Palffy and Adam Deadmarsh scored power-play goals and Eric
Belanger scored a shorthanded goal late in the first period that gave
the Kings a 2-0 lead and all but ended the suspense in front of an
already subdued crowd.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know if it was playing Nashville as much as we lost two
games," Coach Andy Murray said. "We had to get a win here; we had to
turn it around. You lose a couple and you wonder when you'll ever win
your next one."</TE>
<TE>   The Kings led the NHL in power-play efficiency and ranked third in
penalty killing last season, but they're not among the top 10 in
either category this season.</TE>
<TE>   "Last year," Miller said, "we won games with special teams. It's
no secret. We didn't score a ton of five-on-five goals; we killed
penalties and we scored big goals with our power play.</TE>
<TE>   "If we get those units going, we're going to win a lot of games."</TE>
<TE>   They had them going against the Predators, whose 3-0 loss was
their second in three nights. They lost by the same score Sunday
against the Mighty Ducks.</TE>
<TE>   With Panther defenseman Kimmo Timonen in the penalty box for
hooking Craig Johnson, Palffy gave the Kings the only goal they
needed, scoring from the top of the right faceoff circle at 12:37 of
the first period.</TE>
<TE>   Later in the period, with King defenseman Mathieu Schneider
serving a double minor for cross-checking and roughing, Belanger took
a pass off the boards from Ian Laperriere and streaked up the right
side, blowing past Timonen.</TE>
<TE>   His backhanded shot beat Tomas Vokoun to the short side.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't have much to shoot at, but he didn't cover his angle
right," Belanger said of the Predator goaltender. "I just saw the
opening and put it there."</TE>
<TE>   "That was a big turning point," Predator Coach Barry Trotz said.</TE>
<TE>   Said Vokoun, who faced 21 shots before being pulled in favor of
Mike Dunham after the second period: "That's just a bad play by me."</TE>
<TE>   Deadmarsh completed the scoring in the 13th minute of the second
period, redirecting a shot from the blue line by Schneider.</TE>
<TE>   Over the loudspeakers, Journey's "Don't Stop Believing" roared.</TE>
<TE>   It was already too late.</TE>

<HD>No Limits for O'Neal</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tim Brown</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>OAKLAND</DL>
<LD>There once was a concern about Shaquille O'Neal's playing time, on a
big toe three months removed from surgery, on legs that haven't been
conditioned, on a game still not quite up to his standards.</LD>
<LD>   Not anymore.</LD>
<LD>   For one, the Laker schedule has lightened since they reached their
22nd game in 41 days, a particular strain for a veteran team. For
another, well, Shaq had his chance to come out of the Dallas game.</LD>
<TE>   "Actually, when he refused to come out of the game the other night
I said, 'To [heck] with it,' " Coach Phil Jackson said, grinning.
"He'll let me know when he's tired. He let me know in the Utah game
he was tired after five minutes.... Maybe he really worked hard in
that game. The Dallas game, maybe there just wasn't that much going
on, where he had to defend and do the things that can make a guy
tired."</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal averaged 35.5 minutes in his first 10 games off the injured
list. More, probably, than most expected. Now, the schedule becomes a
bit more airy. The Lakers play 15 games in December, 12 in January.</TE>
<TE>   "Definitely, the last week has been an improvement in his
conditioning, noticeably," Jackson said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Where the public sees progress from O'Neal, Derek Fisher, who has
had two foot surgeries since the fall of 1999, sees potential.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a long way away," Fisher said. "He'll have some bright
spots. ... [But] to expect him to come around sometime soon, or be
the Shaq people expect on a nightly basis, isn't fair. We'll know
more in February or March."</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal spent some time on treadmills and bikes, but there were
long periods when he was advised to stay off his feet.</TE>
<TE>   "Every part of your game, especially for a big man, suffers if
you're not in shape," Fisher said. "In the meantime, we'll take
whatever Shaq we can get."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers' field-goal percentage without O'Neal: 38.7. With him:
47.0.... The Lakers don't play again until Friday against New
Orleans.</TE>

<HD>Pippen Finally Trumps Jordan</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In his first game against Michael Jordan, Scottie Pippen won the
bragging rights hands down.</LD>
<LD>   Pippen had one of his best games of the season, and Jordan's team
had its worst. With a lively bounce to nearly every step, Pippen had
14 points, seven rebounds and five assists as the Portland Trail
Blazers dominated the Washington Wizards, 98-79, Tuesday at
Washington.</LD>
<LD>   "I know Pip, and I know he wanted to come out and play well," said
Jordan, who also scored 14 points. "Believe me, I wanted to come out
and play well too. His horses were ready, and my mules were sick. I
have to take some razzing for the time being."</LD>
<TE>   Pippen made six of seven shots and tied Derek Anderson for the
team high in scoring. Pippen's points, rebounds and assists were just
below his season highs in all three categories, and he shared the
team scoring lead for only the second time this season despite
playing only 27 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel I was a little bit more ready for this game," Pippen said.
"I knew there was a lot of attention being brought to it, and I
wanted to answer."</TE>
<TE>   The Trail Blazers outhustled and outworked the Wizards, outscoring
them 50-28 in the paint and 20-8 on fastbreaks.</TE>
<TE>   Memphis 107, Miami 96 -- Drew Gooden scored 25 points and Wesley
Person and Pau Gasol each had 24 at Miami as the Grizzlies won their
first road game of the season.</TE>
<TE>   Memphis had lost all 10 of its road games, the last four by an
average of 16.5 points. But the Grizzlies put together a strong night
offensively, shooting 59% from the floor and getting most of their
production from their big three.</TE>
<TE>   New York 97, Seattle 80 -- Allan Houston scored 25 points, Kurt
Thomas had 22 and the Knick point guards combined for 24 in a victory
at New York. The Knicks ended a three-game losing streak against the
SuperSonics, who were playing the first game of a five-game trip.
Seattle was without Rashard Lewis, who served a one-game suspension
for throwing a punch.</TE>
<TE>   Houston 103, Sacramento 96 -- Steve Francis scored 32 points and
Yao Ming had six crucial points in the closing minutes as the Rockets
almost blew a 19-point lead at Houston before ending the Kings'
six-game winning streak.</TE>
<TE>   Chicago 107, Orlando 87 -- Jalen Rose scored 28 and Donyell
Marshall and Marcus Fizer had 15 apiece as the Bulls won at Chicago
to end a six-game losing streak to the Magic.</TE>

<HD>Bills' Robertson Suspended a Year</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Buffalo Bill defensive tackle Tyrone Robertson was suspended for one
year by the NFL on Tuesday for violating the league's substance abuse
policy for the second time this season.</LD>
<LD>   Robertson, Buffalo's seventh-round pick in last year's draft,
served a four-game suspension from Oct. 2-28. His most recent
suspension begins immediately.</LD>
<LD>   The NFL would not elaborate on the details of either violation.</LD>
<TE>   Robertson was unavailable for comment, and has not been with the
team since the Bills put him on their reserve/non-football illness
list on Oct. 28.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Marc Bulger received medical clearance to play as the St. Louis
Ram quarterback carousel turned again.</TE>
<TE>   Bulger, who has been at quarterback for all five Ram victories
this season, has been out since Nov. 18 with a sprained ligament
between his index and third finger. He has made progress the last
several days and will replace Jamie Martin, who was ineffective in
Sunday's 49-10 loss at Kansas City, for this week's game against the
Arizona Cardinals.</TE>
<TE>   Bulger has a 106.0 passer rating, which would lead the NFL by a
wide margin if he had enough attempts to qualify. He has 12 touchdown
passes and four interceptions and played well in the first game
against the Cardinals.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A committee of Phoenix-area leaders, including Gov.-elect Janet
Napolitano and city mayors, are pursing a Super Bowl in 2008 or 2009
for the planned Arizona Cardinals' stadium.</TE>
<TE>   The committee said that it will try to persuade NFL officials to
play another Super Bowl in the state, with the bid to be presented
March 23-26 during the owners meeting in Phoenix.</TE>
<TE>   Arizona played host to its first NFL championship game in 1996,
when Dallas beat Pittsburgh. That game was played in Tempe at Arizona
State's Sun Devil Stadium.</TE>
<TE>   But a future Super Bowl would be played in a new $355-million,
retractable-roofed stadium planned in Glendale. It received a de
facto go-ahead from the Arizona Supreme Court last week.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Minnesota Vikings signed free-agent running back Larry Ned to
the practice squad and released defensive tackle Cedric Killings.</TE>
<TE>   Ned was a standout at San Diego State. The Vikings have a
banged-up backfield, and Ned could be activated for Sunday's game
against New Orleans.</TE>
<TE>   Moe Williams is nursing a bruised heel, and Doug Chapman was put
on injured reserve in October after being hospitalized with an
abdominal injury.</TE>

<HD>Canadiens Take Care of Bruins Again</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Montreal Canadiens started with more energy, ended with strong
goaltending and knocked off the NHL's top team.</LD>
<LD>   They beat Boston, 4-2, Tuesday night, ending the Bruins'
three-game winning streak as Jeff Hackett stopped 31 shots, including
all 14 he faced in the third period at Boston.</LD>
<LD>   "In the first period, we matched their physical play and showed we
weren't going to be pushed around," Hackett said. "I knew it was
going to be a tough third period and they didn't disappoint."</LD>
<TE>   But the Canadiens had built a 4-0 lead. They did allow goals by
Joe Thornton and Mike Knuble in the last 10 minutes of the second
period but played cautiously in the third.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't come out flat against a team like that. They're
explosive," Boston's Brian Rolston said. Hackett "made some big
saves, there's no question, especially in the third period when we
were trying to come back."</TE>
<TE>   The Canadiens took a 4-0 lead on goals by Jan Bulis in the first
period and Yanic Perreault, Oleg Petrov and Randy McKay in the
second.</TE>
<TE>   Montreal also beat a strong Boston team in last season's playoffs.
The Bruins had the best record in the Eastern Conference but lost in
the first round to the eighth-seeded Canadiens.</TE>
<TE>   The loss dropped the Bruins' record against Eastern Conference
teams to 14-2-2-0 and ended their five-game winning streak against
Montreal in Boston.</TE>
<TE>   Ottawa 4, Buffalo 2 -- Martin Prusek made 26 saves in only his
fifth career start, and Marian Hossa scored twice to lead the
Senators at Buffalo, N.Y.</TE>
<TE>   Todd White and Brad Smyth also scored for Ottawa, which won for
the first time in Buffalo since Dec. 30, 1998, and ended an
eight-game winless streak (0-7-1) at HSBC Arena.</TE>
<TE>   Chicago 3, New York Islanders 2 -- Tyler Arnason scored the
go-ahead goal and also assisted on the tying score in the third
period as the Blackhawks won at Uniondale, N.Y.</TE>
<TE>   Roman Hamrlik and Dave Scatchard scored for New York. Hamrlik
separated his shoulder later in the game and will be out for four
weeks.</TE>
<TE>   New Jersey 2, St. Louis 0 -- Jim McKenzie and Turner Stevenson
scored, and Martin Brodeur made 28 saves for his third shutout this
season as the Devils won at East Rutherford, N.J.</TE>
<TE>   The Blues played two men short as they dressed only 18. The team
was hit by widespread food poisoning which affected Dallas Drake and
Scott Mellanby.</TE>
<TE>   Toronto 4, Pittsburgh 2 -- Mats Sundin's second goal of the game
broke a third-period tie at Toronto as the Penguins lost their
season-high fifth in a row.</TE>
<TE>   Mario Lemieux recorded his league-leading 50th and 51st points in
his 26th game this season. Pittsburgh lost winger Alexsey Morozov to
a broken wrist. He will be re-examined today.</TE>
<TE>   Philadelphia 5, Florida 2 -- Simon Gagne scored two unassisted
goals as the Flyers won at Sunrise, Fla.</TE>
<TE>   The five-goal outburst broke the Flyers' team-record streak of 16
games without scoring more than three goals. They scored only 22
goals in that span.</TE>
<TE>   Minnesota 5, Tampa Bay 3 -- Marian Gaborik scored his NHL-leading
19th goal, and the Wild scored three times on five second-period
shots to win at St. Paul, Minn.</TE>

<HD>Bettman Confident of Sabres' Sale</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SCOTTSDALE, Ariz.</DL>
<LD>Despite speculation about the financial weakness of the intended new
owners of the Buffalo Sabres, NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman expects
the transaction to go through by February.</LD>
<LD>   Asked what would happen if Mark Hamister and partner Todd Berman
couldn't finalize their purchase of the team within a 45-day
exclusive bargaining period, Bettman said Tuesday he was getting
positive feedback.</LD>
<LD>   "From everything I'm hearing from the lawyers, everybody is
progressing and doing the things they need to be doing to move this
along," he said during the two-day NHL Board of Governors meeting.</LD>
<TE>   Hamister, the chairman of United Health Care, and Berman, an
investment banker, won the league's nod Nov. 20 to buy the Sabres for
$65 million. They beat out Rochester, N.Y., billionaire Thomas
Golisano, who offered less but would have paid in cash.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, the Buffalo News has reported that Hamister and Berman
have asked the state, county and city governments for a $35-million
financial package to reduce their cost.</TE>
<TE>   Bettman disclosed Monday that the partnership's nonbinding bid is
exclusive on both sides for 45 days. He did not directly answer a
question about what would happen when the grace period expired.</TE>

<HD>Otis Reclaims Old Job</HD>
<DH>Compton Dominguez High takes back controversial basketball
Coach Russell Otis in 4-3 vote by school board.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Ben Bolch</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After waiting more than five hours to go before members of the
Compton Unified School District board and explain why he should have
his old job back, Russell Otis got his chance late Tuesday night.</LD>
<LD>   And, as he seems to almost always, the controversial basketball
coach emerged a winner.</LD>
<LD>   The board voted 4-3 to approve Otis' nomination, allowing him to
return to the Dons boys' team as coach. He starts today.</LD>
<TE>   Otis previously coached Dominguez for 13 seasons, guiding the Dons
to seven Southern Section championships and four state titles.
Dominguez finished the 1999-2000 season ranked No. 1 in the nation,
but Otis was arrested in November 2000, after a former player alleged
the coach had sexually molested him.</TE>
<TE>   Otis denied the charges and he was acquitted in April 2001.
However, by then he had lost his basketball job. Two months before
his acquittal, Otis was fired by the Compton district, which cited
his failure to obtain a permanent teaching credential as the reason.</TE>
<TE>   Otis requested reinstatement as coach after his acquittal, but the
school board denied him. He spent last school year as a teacher at
Gardena High.</TE>
<TE>   The player whose allegations led to Otis' arrest has brought
similar accusations in a civil case in Compton Superior Court,
seeking unspecified compensatory and punitive damages. The Compton
district is also a defendant in the case, accused of negligence. A
jury trial is scheduled for early February.</TE>
<TE>   Conrad Kohrs, Otis' attorney in the civil litigation, has brought
a cross-complaint against the plaintiff for lying during the criminal
investigation and trial.</TE>
<TE>   Back on the basketball court, Dominguez briefly continued its
success after Otis' departure, winning an unprecedented third
consecutive state title in 2001 with interim Coach Steve Singleton, a
former Otis assistant.</TE>
<TE>   But the Dons fell on hard times last season under Mack Calvin,
finishing 15-12 and losing in the second round of the playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   Dominguez started the season last week by splitting four games in
a tournament near Fresno.</TE>

<HD>Prada Beats OneWorld in Wind Shift</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>AUCKLAND, New Zealand</DL>
<LD>Prada gained more than a minute in a fifth-leg wind shift to defeat
Seattle's OneWorld by 20 seconds today in an America's Cup semifinal.</LD>
<LD>   The victory by the Italian team reversed the first result of the
best-of-seven series in which OneWorld erased a one-point penalty
imposed Monday for rules violations. When OneWorld's penalty is
counted, Prada leads the series, 1-0.</LD>
<LD>   Alinghi of Switzerland took a 2-0 lead in its semifinal against
Larry Ellison's Oracle syndicate, shrewdly defending its lead in
shifty conditions to win by 29 seconds.</LD>
<TE>   OneWorld, which was hungry for good news after the week's legal
defeats, led convincingly for more than two-thirds of the
18.5-nautical-mile race.</TE>
<TE>   It played the wind well at first on a day of low clouds, rain and
limited visibility, taking up the favored right side on the first
beat and leading by 21 seconds at the first mark.</TE>
<TE>   By the fourth mark, OneWorld was 38 seconds ahead and tactician
Charlie McKee had picked and exploited most of the day's dangerous
wind shifts.</TE>
<TE>   OneWorld made its first tactical blunder on the final beat,
choosing to separate from Prada and to look for better pressure on
the right of the course. Prada got sailed past when the wind shifted
left.</TE>
<TE>   "They tried to play the shifts and it was the sort of day when it
was dangerous to go there," Prada tactician Torben Grael said.</TE>
<TE>   The semifinals were set to continue Thursday.</TE>

<LD>The four most powerful countries in women's soccer -- China, Germany,
Norway and the United States -- will play in the Four Nations Cup in
China starting Jan. 23, exactly eight months before they seek to win

<TE>   "It will be an opportunity to put some younger players on the
field in an environment that will supply the most pressure they will

<HD>Utah May Pass on Chow Option</HD>

<LD>USC's fear that offensive coordinator Norm Chow would leave to become
the head coach at Utah was abated somewhat Tuesday when Utah
reportedly offered the job to another candidate.</LD>
<LD>   Bowling Green Coach Urban Meyer, who has been linked to several
major coaching openings in the last few weeks, met with Utah Athletic
Director Chris Hill on Monday in Salt Lake City. The Salt Lake
Tribune is reporting today that Meyer is considering an offer to
replace Ron McBride, who was fired after 13 seasons.</LD>
<LD>   Chow, who played at Utah and coached at Brigham Young for 27
seasons, met with Hill last week. He was in Utah on Tuesday morning
but said he was there to make a stop at his family's home in Provo
before continuing on to Little Rock, Ark., for tonight's Broyles
Award dinner. Chow is a finalist for award, presented annually to the
nation's top assistant coach.</LD>
<TE>   Chow also said that UCLA athletic department officials had not
contacted him about the school's head-coaching job.</TE>

<TE>   USC lobbied the Orange Bowl in the final weeks of the regular
season, promising that Trojan fans would follow the team to Miami if
selected for the bowl championship series game.</TE>
<TE>   As of late Tuesday, USC officials said more than 6,000 of the
15,000 tickets they are responsible for had been sold for the Jan. 2
game against Iowa.</TE>
<TE>   "We still have a ways to go, but we're happy with it," said Steve
Lopes, a senior associate athletic director.</TE>
<TE>   All but 400 of the tickets available through USC are priced at
$85, Lopes said. The others are $120. Lopes said a variety of travel
packages are available, one that includes a game ticket and
round-trip chartered airfare for $744.</TE>
<TE>   Stephan Benson, associate executive director of the Orange Bowl,
said the matchup between the fifth-ranked Trojans (10-2) and
third-ranked Hawkeyes (11-1) has produced a guaranteed sellout at Pro
Player Stadium, which has a seating capacity of more than 74,000.</TE>
<TE>   Iowa has sold all of the 26,000 tickets it was allotted.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm anticipating that USC will sell [more than] 15,000," Benson
said. "We have sold out all the other tickets.</TE>
<TE>   "That's a tremendous feat. It shows you that fans respond to
top-end matchups."</TE>
<TE>   USC expects more response when direct-mail pieces reach 40,000
alumni across the country.</TE>

<HD>Volleyball Tour Gets Better With Best</HD>
<DH>May and Walsh, top women's team in world, sign with AVP,
ending a two-year standoff.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Misty May and Kerri Walsh, who form the top women's beach volleyball
team in the world, have signed with the Assn. of Volleyball
Professionals, ending a two-year standoff with the AVP and
strengthening the U.S. tour almost overnight.</LD>
<LD>   May and Walsh, who live in Southern California, had been playing
solely on the international tour, eschewing the AVP for more
lucrative tournament payouts, among other things, on the Federation
Internationale de Volleyball tour.</LD>
<LD>   The addition of May and Walsh immediately improves the women's
division of the AVP and can be interpreted as another positive sign
as the tour continues to emerge from a downward trend that bottomed
out with a bankruptcy declaration in November 1998.</LD>
<TE>   "This is just another one of the steps the AVP has taken to unify
all interests in the sport while continuing the AVP's rise as a
national sports property," said AVP Commissioner Leonard Armato, who
purchased the tour in May 2001.</TE>
<TE>   May and Walsh also will continue to play on the FIVB tour.</TE>
<TE>   Three months ago, the AVP signed a pact with its longtime
adversary, the FIVB, in which the tours agreed to avoid scheduling
major tournaments simultaneously.</TE>
<TE>   In one of the pact's provisions, the FIVB, which controls the
Olympic qualifying process, said it would only recognize players that
were in good standing with the national tour of their home country.
As such, May and Walsh eventually would have had to join the AVP in
order to qualify for the Olympics.</TE>
<TE>   "My main concern was having the freedom to qualify to play in the
Olympics," Walsh said. "We're going to have that now."</TE>
<TE>   May and her agent, Tom McCarthy, had complained that the AVP had
"restrictive" player contracts, but McCarthy said he is satisfied
with a few minor changes made in AVP contracts for all players. For
example, a new clause allows AVP players to keep secret how much
money they make in endorsement deals.</TE>
<TE>   In the end, the AVP now has the top two women's teams in the world
with May, 25, and Walsh, 24, and the successful U.S. team of Holly
McPeak and Elaine Youngs.</TE>
<TE>   Of the 11 FIVB tournaments last season, May and Walsh won five,
McPeak and Youngs won four.</TE>

<HD>Huskies Keep Their Edge</HD>

<AU>MIKE TERRY</AU>

<DL></DL>
<LD>It was the fall of 1969. UCLA's Coach John Wooden no longer had his
stellar center Lew Alcindor -- now Kareem Abdul-Jabbar -- Alcindor
having graduated after leading the Bruins to three consecutive NCAA
men's basketball championships. As the 1969-70 season got underway,
Wooden remarked how nice it would be, once again, to coach to win
instead of coaching not to lose.</LD>
<LD>   Thirty-three years later, Geno Auriemma, Connecticut's women's
coach, finds himself in a similar circumstance.</LD>
<LD>   His Huskies are coming off a third national championship, although
not in a row. Last year's team, led by the senior quartet of Sue
Bird, Swin Cash, Asjha Jones and Tamika Williams, went 39-0 as it
grew to be considered one of the greatest women's teams in college
basketball history.</LD>
<TE>   The 2002-03 UConn roster has no seniors. Eight of the 11 players
are freshmen or sophomores. Star junior guard Diana Taurasi is the
only returning starter.</TE>
<TE>   So this season should be Auriemma's free pass. A season of lowered
expectations, of teaching rather than caretaking. A season Auriemma
can coach to win, instead of not to lose.</TE>
<TE>   But the 45-year-old Auriemma, who was born in Italy and grew up
into a charming mix of brashness and confidence in Norristown, Pa.,
doesn't see it that way.</TE>
<TE>   "To me, I would rather be in last year's situation than any
situation I can imagine," Auriemma said. "To me, that is fun, when
all the pressure's on you, when everybody expects you to be great, to
set a standard that's never been reached. And last year I had the
team to do that."</TE>
<TE>   In 17 years at Connecticut, Auriemma has built the women's program
to a level few universities reach. Before he arrived, the Huskies had
one winning season in 11 years. Besides the three national titles --
only Tennessee, with six, has more -- the Huskies have won 12 Big
East regular-season championships and 11 Big East tournament titles,
nine in succession.</TE>
<TE>   Auriemma, 29 victories shy of 500, has coached 10 All-Americans
and four national players of the year. Since 1995, his first NCAA
championship season, the Huskies have lost 17 games. His biggest
accomplishment, however, is that every recruited freshman who has
played for Auriemma and completed her eligibility at Connecticut has
graduated.</TE>
<TE>   Auriemma embraces the weight of his legacy, but he feels it just
the same. He is trying not to transfer that pressure to this season's
team.</TE>
<TE>   "I get frustrated because I try to make these players play at the
level that I have no right to expect them to play," he said. "But if
I don't expect it, we'll never reach it.</TE>
<TE>   "That's what makes coaches kind of crazy. You walk that fine line,
trying to balance those things. You know you don't have the same kind
of talent. But still, your expectations are so high that you have to
temper that."</TE>
<TE>   So far the Huskies are bearing up. After routing USC on Sunday,
Connecticut is 7-0 and ranked third. It has won 46 consecutive games,
tying Tennessee for the second-longest streak in women's college
basketball.</TE>
<TE>   Auriemma says he is not obsessed with winning because "that
attitude clouds everything you do." Instead, he pursues coaching a
team that plays the game perfectly.</TE>
<TE>   Last year's team came close.</TE>
<TE>   "I would say the Old Dominion game in the regional final -- the
first 20 minutes of that game, I don't think the game of basketball
can be played any better," Auriemma said.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Auriemma isn't sure how much longer he can keep, or wants
to keep, his drive to see Connecticut on top. Not that he's planning
on retiring tomorrow. But he can't envision being on the Huskies'
bench when he's 70.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the life span for a coach like me is very short," he
said. "You look at guys like [North Carolina's] Dean Smith and you
say to yourself, 'How in God's name can you do that 32 years?'</TE>
<TE>   "Somewhere, you have to come to grips with it all. But I haven't
come to grips with it yet."</TE>

<HD>Jurors Lead the Way on Issue of the Mentally Ill</HD>

<LD>Even for killers, you couldn't have found two less popular
defendants. One drove his car through a fence and into a day-care
playground, killing two toddlers. The other left home, armed with an
assault rifle, and then killed an unsuspecting sheriff's deputy with
a barrage of bullets.</LD>
<LD>   Orange County prosecutors asked for and got first-degree murder
convictions. In each case, they asked for the death penalty as
punishment for killing members of two of society's most protected
classes -- children and law enforcement officers.</LD>
<LD>   Once upon a time, you'd have to think juries in this conservative,
law-and-order county would have delivered just that on a silver
platter.</LD>
<TE>   But in both cases -- the more recent being last week -- juries
rejected capital punishment, citing the defendants' mental illness.</TE>
<TE>   Knowing for a fact you can't get a 12-member bleeding-heart jury
in Orange County, I'm left to wonder why our citizens are so
noticeably out in front of the district attorney's office in
recognizing mental illness and seeking appropriate penalties.</TE>
<TE>   I talked to a member of the jury that said yes to convicting
Maurice Steskal of first-degree murder for killing Sheriff's Deputy
Brad Riches but no to executing him. Instead, it voted 11 to 1 for
life imprisonment, prompting the judge to order a mistrial and the
prosecutor to say he'd try again for the death penalty.</TE>
<TE>   What struck me was how much juror Lee Jarvis, a 63-year-old
financial planner from Fullerton, sounded like two jurors I'd
interviewed in November 2000 after their wrenching experience in the
case of Steven Allen Abrams. Their jury convicted Abrams of
first-degree murder in the Costa Mesa day-care deaths of two
preschoolers but spared him the death penalty.</TE>
<TE>   "Unfortunately in our system, we don't do anything for the
mentally ill," Jarvis said, and he can be forgiven for a bit of
overstatement. "They're put in the street, or they're housed in
prison, because something like this [Steskal's crime] happens. That's
our mental health system."</TE>
<TE>   I raised the prospect of a softhearted jury. "No question, this
was no bleeding-heart jury," Jarvis said.</TE>
<TE>   "In fact, I was surprised people came to this conclusion [11 votes
to reject the death penalty] fairly quickly. Let's assume we really
were sympathetic to the defendant. We could have found him guilty of
involuntary manslaughter. We were possibly too harsh with the
first-degree murder charge."</TE>
<TE>   Jarvis said he harbors no illusion that Steskal will get the
treatment he needs in prison. To the contrary, he assumes Steskal's
mental demons will come roaring out from time to time.</TE>
<TE>   I asked Jarvis if the district attorney should have pushed for the
death penalty. "If I were the prosecutor, I wouldn't have," Jarvis
said, adding it was "very clear" Steskal suffered from a mental
illness. Jarvis lamented the fact that the prosecutor "expressed no
sympathy whatsoever for this man's mental illness," but said that
might reflect the majority societal view.</TE>
<TE>   "The public has a very bad attitude about mental illness," Jarvis
said. "They're afraid of it; they want it out of sight, out of mind."</TE>
<TE>   Jarvis, who helps senior citizens with financial matters, said
society understands and sympathizes with older people who have mental
illnesses, but not those in their 40s, like Steskal.</TE>
<TE>   And in this case, he said, the endgame became a horrible tragedy.</TE>
<TE>   "This was the logical conclusion to this person's mental illness,"
Jarvis said. "Really, it is. When someone has a semiautomatic rifle
as his constant companion, that alone should have set off alarm
bells."</TE>

<HD>Supervisors Postpone Vote on Planning Unit Bid to Hike Fees</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>Jean O. Pasco</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Board of Supervisors on Tuesday postponed a decision on whether
to boost building permit fees more than 50% as part of an emergency
plan to keep the Orange County Planning Department afloat.</LD>
<LD>   "There were entirely too many questions that remained unanswered,"
Supervisor Tom Wilson said of the delay. "We didn't want to rush out
and vote."</LD>
<LD>   Planning Director Thomas B. Mathews and County Executive Officer
Michael Schumacher promised to answer the board's questions by
Friday.</LD>
<TE>   If the answers aren't adequate, supervisors said, the vote will be
delayed until January.</TE>
<TE>   The department is running a deficit of $500,000 a month, has spent
down its reserves and announced last week plans to lay off 40
workers.</TE>
<TE>   Supervisors met behind closed doors twice this week to discuss how
the proposed fee increase relates to an ongoing lawsuit by national
homebuilder Barratt American Inc., which challenges the charges as
excessive.</TE>
<TE>   A special master appointed by the court to review the finances of
the Planning Department protested the proposed increase in court
Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Special master Robert Mosier said county planners hadn't justified
the hike or explained how they'd drained an $18-million reserve in
the last three years.</TE>
<TE>   A partial ruling by Superior Court Judge C. Robert Jameson is
expected Friday on whether Barratt was improperly charged more than
the county's actual costs for issuing building permits. State and
federal laws restrict what governments can charge for user fees so
local officials can't create what amount to hidden taxes.</TE>
<TE>   Jameson's ruling could result in the county ultimately having to
reinstate as much as $10 million of the reserve fund, Mosier wrote in
court documents.</TE>

<HD>Blair's Wife Admits Missteps in Scandal</HD>
<DH>British leader's spouse blames pressures of career,
motherhood and her public role for a real estate deal that has
obsessed tabloids.</DH>

<DL>LONDON</DL>
<LD>Declaring Tuesday that she is no "superwoman," Cherie Blair, the
savvy lawyer spouse of British Prime Minister Tony Blair,
acknowledged a lapse in judgment in accepting real estate advice from
a man who turned out to be a convicted criminal.</LD>
<LD>   The first lady choked back tears in her first public remarks on a
controversy that has dominated the British tabloids for a week and
led to charges of impropriety and cover-up.</LD>
<LD>   Cherie Blair conceded that she had mishandled questions about the
matter, causing the prime minister's office to give out misleading
information that Peter Foster, a convicted fraud, wasn't involved at
all. She blamed her initial reaction on her wish to protect her
family's privacy.</LD>
<TE>   Blair, a charity activist in addition to being a leading civil
rights lawyer, part-time judge and mother of the Blairs' four
children, pleaded for public understanding during a 10-minute
appearance before the cameras.</TE>
<TE>   "The reality of my daily life is that I'm juggling a lot of balls
in the air -- trying to be a good wife and mother, trying to be the
prime ministerial consort at home and abroad," she said.</TE>
<TE>   "Some of the balls get dropped -- there just aren't enough hours
in the day."</TE>
<TE>   In all, it was an emotional performance from a woman who has
always been a little awkward in public, and the crowd witnessing her
statement -- made just before she attended an awards banquet for an
organization called Partners in Excellence -- responded with warm
applause.</TE>
<TE>   There was never any accusation of illegal behavior on the part of
the first lady, only that there was impropriety in any association
with a convicted con man.</TE>
<TE>   At issue was Blair's connection to Foster, an Australian who
offered to help her negotiate the purchase of two apartments in the
city of Bristol, where the Blairs' eldest son, Euan, has just started
his university studies. Foster is the boyfriend of a close friend of
the first lady and volunteered to help negotiate the $790,000 deal.
According to media reports, he succeeded in persuading the owner to
reduce the selling price by about $109,000.</TE>
<TE>   In her statement, Blair said she was unaware until a few weeks ago
that Foster had a criminal history. As the wife of the prime
minister, she said, she chooses her friends with care, but "I did not
think it was my business to choose my friends' friends."</TE>
<TE>   The controversy, and the insinuation of a Downing Street cover-up,
was seen by some observers here as a way for the tabloid press to do
political harm to the usually unassailable prime minister. Earlier
Tuesday, Tony Blair's office asked newspapers to maintain "a sense of
perspective," and a spokesman accused some tabloid reporters of a
"campaign of character assassination."</TE>
<TE>   Conservatives have called for an inquiry into whether Cherie Blair
or the prime minister's representatives tried to accelerate
deportation proceedings against Foster once his involvement with the
real estate deal became widely known. In her statement, Blair said
that the suggestion was untrue.</TE>
<TE>   Blair said she never suspected that her dealings with Foster would
lead to "this mess." Nevertheless, she said, the real estate was
bought "in an entirely lawful and proper way."</TE>
<TE>   "I am sorry if I have embarrassed anyone," she said, "but the
people who know me well know that I would never want to harm anyone,
least of all Tony or the children or the Labor government, or to
misuse my position in any way at all."</TE>

<HD>Next Door to Iraq, the Present Danger Is Anti-Americanism</HD>
<DH>Both Kuwait and the U.S. forces there are trying to stave
off attacks like one on two soldiers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mark Fineman</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>KUWAIT CITY</DL>
<LD>On the morning he shot two American soldiers at point-blank range,
Khaled Shimmiri got up early in the 12-room house he shares with his
17 sisters and brothers. He put on his Kuwaiti police uniform,
threatened his wife and headed off to work.</LD>
<LD>   "He pulled a bullet out of his gun belt, held it up to her and
said, 'I can kill you just with this,' " Shimmiri's eldest brother,
Saoud, recalled. "She just thought he was joking."</LD>
<LD>   After all, Saoud asserted, the whole family knew that Khaled had
gone mad.</LD>
<TE>   Then again, maybe not.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe Shimmiri is an Al Qaeda sympathizer instead. Or maybe, as
investigators fear, he was just reacting to images of Americans
waging war on Afghanistan and of U.S. support for Israel.</TE>
<TE>   Under questioning, the 20-year-old police officer told
investigators that he "wanted to go to heaven, and this was a very
short way to the martyrs' paradise," said a Kuwaiti source who asked
not to be named.</TE>
<TE>   At a recent closed hearing, Shimmiri was ordered to undergo a
psychiatric evaluation after he told the court that he "loved
Americans" and did not know why he had committed the crime.</TE>
<TE>   The question of whether the young police officer fired out of
madness or calculated terror has fed fears about the safety of the
more than 12,000 American military personnel on this vital training
ground and strategic platform for possible military operations
against Iraq. Those fears have intensified since Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein recently applauded Kuwaiti attacks on American
soldiers.</TE>
<TE>   With the U.S. military occupying more than a quarter of Kuwait,
the government is taking urgent stock of the extent of
anti-Americanism and fundamentalist fervor within the ranks of its
own police and military.</TE>
<TE>   The shooting of two reserve Army sergeants last month was the
latest in a series of attacks in this oil-rich nation, liberated 12
years ago by the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   At least one of those assaults -- the fatal shooting of a U.S.
Marine on an island off Kuwait in October -- was the work of a group
associated with the Al Qaeda terrorist network, investigators say.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. and Kuwaiti officials insist that the shootings are
aberrations -- isolated incidents involving a rare radical here or a
madman there in a grateful nation that overwhelmingly supports the
growing U.S. force.</TE>
<TE>   Most Kuwaitis say they view the American force as a comfort.
Kuwaiti psychologists advise patients to go look at the U.S. military
camps as therapy for what has become widespread anxiety about the
possibility of another war.</TE>
<TE>   Even some of Kuwait's most fundamentalist Islamic leaders have
condemned the attacks.</TE>
<TE>   "If Kuwaitis were so anti-American, Kuwait would not be able to
cede a third or a quarter of its territory to the U.S.," said Shafeeq
Ghabra, who heads Kuwait's Center for Strategic and Future Studies, a
government-funded think tank.</TE>
<TE>   Still, neither the Kuwaitis nor the Americans are taking any
chances.</TE>
<TE>   Commanders at Camp Doha -- the U.S. Army headquarters in the
capital's warehouse district, which oversees more than half a dozen
sprawling U.S. facilities -- have raised the threat-alert level.
Military personnel now are required to travel in fours, in
two-vehicle convoys, with a weapon and cell phone at all times. And
Americans in uniform are no longer seen on city streets.</TE>
<TE>   Kuwait's official response has been profound: broad new measures
designed to prevent future assaults and weed out potential
assailants.</TE>
<TE>   Interior Minister Sheik Mohammed Khaled al Hamad al Sabah, who
oversees the police force, has promised a purge of his ranks and
internal reforms so extensive that he called them "a powerful
earthquake." His ministry also put the nation's police on full alert
at the beginning of this month.</TE>
<TE>   The government is going deeper still. It has appointed a member of
the ruling royal family to head a committee that will review the
curriculum in state and religious schools to determine whether
Kuwaitis are being radicalized at young ages.</TE>
<TE>   And the Kuwait Psychiatric Hospital, where the majority of
registered patients are Kuwaiti police and soldiers, has appointed a
separate committee to review its diagnostic protocols and its patient
files.</TE>
<TE>   In Kuwait's welfare state, men in uniform receive broad privileges
if they are determined to be suffering from mental illness, among
them special leave, strong drugs and sharply reduced sentences if
they commit crimes. Several psychologists said abuse of the system is
commonplace.</TE>
<TE>   "The easiest way to get these privileges is they go into the
Psychiatric Hospital, get their certificate stating they have a
mental problem and then they get everything," said Jasem Hajia, a
Kuwaiti psychologist. "The hospital needs new diagnostic protocols."</TE>
<TE>   But the Shimmiri family insists that Khaled was genuinely insane
when he shot the Americans. His symptoms have come and gone since
last May, when, his brother insisted, the young traffic policeman
tried to kill himself during an acute psychotic episode.</TE>
<TE>   "He was crying. He ripped off his clothes and put a spoon down his
throat trying to choke himself," said Saoud, a sergeant in the
Kuwaiti army. "So we took him to Jordan for treatment."</TE>
<TE>   After Shimmiri's condition was diagnosed, the family brought him
home to a psychiatrist, Saoud asserted, and he took a two-month leave
from work. Eventually, his brother added, the symptoms subsided.</TE>
<TE>   Shimmiri returned to duty in July and handed his medical records
over to his superior officer, who took away his service revolver and
patrol car and gave him a desk job.</TE>
<TE>   Then, having married in June, he returned to normal life, Saoud
said. He planned to enroll in graduate school in Egypt in the coming
term, although his first preference would have been to attend school
in Texas.</TE>
<TE>   But never, Saoud asserted, did his brother regularly attend
sermons at the mosque, speak of politics or express anything but
admiration for the United States.</TE>
<TE>   Of Shimmiri, his brother added: "He generally admires American
people for their development, culture and superiority in all fields.
He also feels grateful for their liberation of Kuwait."</TE>
<TE>   That's not how it appeared Nov. 21.</TE>
<TE>   As his brother tells it, the patrolman's supervisor was on
vacation when Shimmiri reached the police station that day. He asked
the assistant for his gun and patrol car. The assistant knew nothing
of his illness and handed them over.</TE>
<TE>   Shimmiri was soon speeding along a desert expressway on the
outskirts of Kuwait City, chasing a civilian vehicle en route from
Camp Doha to Arifjan, a massive new U.S. military base 35 miles south
of the capital.</TE>
<TE>   Here's how Army Reserve Master Sgt. Larry Thomas, who was in
civilian clothes at the wheel with Sgt. Charles Ellis in the
passenger seat at the time, described what happened next from a
hospital bed in Germany days later:</TE>
<TE>   "The police officer pulled up on the left-hand side of me. When he
got even with the car, we exchanged eye contact. He slowed down, got
behind us and put his lights on.</TE>
<TE>   "We pulled over to the side of the road. He got out of his car and
came up to our car and asked if we had a driver's license. I asked
him, 'What's the problem, officer?' He said, 'You are speeding.' I
said, 'No, sir, we are not speeding.' I handed him the driver's
license."</TE>
<TE>   Shimmiri went back to the patrol car and returned moments later.</TE>
<TE>   "It looked like he was going to leave the car to go back to his,
but he made a step away, and I was looking at him, and he unsnapped
his pistol. I was thinking just, 'He may be holding the gun or
something.'</TE>
<TE>   "But he unsnapped his pistol, shot me right here in the chest. And
at that time, my arm went numb, and I knew I had been hit. Then he
released another shot and shot Sgt. Ellis. So I took my ... left arm
and threw [the car] in gear because I did not want him to finish
shooting us."</TE>
<TE>   The Americans managed to drive to Arifjan, where they were taken
to a Kuwaiti military hospital by helicopter. Shimmiri sped off into
the desert, to neighboring Saudi Arabia. He hid out there with
cousins for a day before they turned him in to Saudi police, who
turned him over to the Kuwaitis.</TE>
<TE>   Shimmiri's attorney, Nawaf Sary Mutery, said he is preparing an
insanity defense for his client, who, if convicted on attempted
murder charges, could face the death penalty or life imprisonment --
unless the court takes his mental illness into account.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously," the lawyer added, "we're hoping for an outright
acquittal due to insanity. In that case, he would simply go free."</TE>

<DH>Tough new strategy affirms U.S. threat to use preemptive
force against its enemies.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Maura Reynolds</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Bush administration today will spell out a tough new strategy
designed to deter terrorists and other enemies from acquiring
nuclear, chemical or biological weapons and using them against the
United States and its allies.</LD>
<LD>   The anti-proliferation strategy codifies a national security
evolution that began with last year's Sept. 11 attacks, and repeats
the administration's threat to use preemptive and overwhelming force
-- including nuclear weapons -- against what it perceives as imminent
danger of an attack.</LD>
<LD>   "We will not permit the world's most dangerous regimes and
terrorists to threaten us with the world's most destructive weapons,"
the document says. "We must accord the highest priority to the
protection of the United States, our forces and our friends and
allies from the existing and growing WMD [weapons of mass
destruction] threat."</LD>
<TE>   The document, released just days after Iraq handed over what it
calls the complete list of its weapons programs, provides greater
details about the administration's more assertive approach to
national security.</TE>
<TE>   The strategy underscores that President Bush is prepared to go to
war to prevent future attacks -- as he has said he will against Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   The strategy, prepared jointly by the National Security Council
and the White House Office of Homeland Security, for the first time
formally redefines the threat posed by nuclear, chemical and
biological weapons as not just external, but domestic as well.</TE>
<TE>   "The distinction between threats abroad and threats to the
homeland no longer applies in today's environment, in large part
because of weapons of mass destruction and the desire both by rogue
states, and terrorists, to gain access to these weapons," said a
senior administration official who spoke on the condition of
anonymity.</TE>
<TE>   The anti-proliferation strategy replaces a 1993 strategy drafted
by the Clinton administration. It also elaborates on the
administration's new National Security Doctrine released in
September.</TE>
<TE>   The new strategy is already operative policy for the nation's
intelligence agencies, military and law enforcement, the
administration official said.</TE>
<TE>   Affected agencies have received secret directives to implement the
strategy in the last several months, the administration official
said.</TE>
<TE>   In contrast to previous policy statements, the strategy outlines a
new policy of deterrence. In a speech in June, the president
described deterrence as an outmoded, Cold War-era idea that "means
nothing against shadowy terrorist networks with no nation or citizens
to defend."</TE>
<TE>   New Strategy</TE>
<TE>   That stance has since undergone some refinement.</TE>
<TE>   The new strategy says that deterrence is still useful, although it
must be redefined for the post-Sept. 11 world.</TE>
<TE>   "These are not countries like the Soviet Union with which we have
long dialogues, with which we have mutual understandings about
deterrence," the senior administration official said.</TE>
<TE>   "These countries are attempting to deter us, to deter us from
coming to the assistance of our friends and allies in critical
regions of the world. And they don't need to do this with thousands
of weapons. They can do this with only a few weapons that hold our
cities hostage."</TE>
<TE>   To deter such an enemy, the document says, the United States must
have a strong, declared policy of retaliation, effective military
forces and a "full range of political tools."</TE>
<TE>   These include treaties, restrictions on use and distribution of
uranium and plutonium, controls of technology exports and sanctions.</TE>
<TE>   "The United States will continue to make clear that it reserves
the right to respond with overwhelming force -- including through
resort to all of our options -- to the use of WMD against the United
States, our forces abroad and our allies," the document says.</TE>
<TE>   But because deterrence may not succeed, the United States "must
have the capability to defend against WMD-armed adversaries,
including in appropriate cases through preemptive measures."</TE>
<TE>   The new strategy expresses support for international treaty
regimes, including the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty, the Chemical
Weapons Convention and the Biological Weapons Convention, although it
hints that more must be done to "ensure compliance."</TE>
<TE>   It also integrates missile defense into nonproliferation policy by
describing it as an "active" defense against weapons of mass
destruction. "Active defenses disrupt, disable or destroy WMD en
route to their targets," the document says.</TE>
<TE>   'Military Challenge'</TE>
<TE>   Leonard Spector, a proliferation expert formerly with the Energy
Department, said the new strategy codifies a post-Sept. 11 evolution
away from emphasizing diplomacy and global treaties as a way to
counter the proliferation threat and toward more aggressive
prevention and response.</TE>
<TE>   "It has transferred from being primarily a diplomatic strategy to
seeing it as a military challenge," said Spector, who is now deputy
director of the Monterey Institute's nonproliferation studies center.
"Some of it is a little overkill. But some of it is a response to
changing circumstances."</TE>
<TE>   The strategy also pledges to strengthen intelligence and support
research into new technologies to detect and defeat weapons of mass
destruction.</TE>
<TE>   It urges tougher action against "secondary proliferation" by
countries such as Pakistan and Ukraine that have been known to pass
on restricted weapons technologies. And it calls for "targeted
strategies" against "dedicated proliferators" -- a reference to the
administration's different approaches to weapons programs in Iraq and
North Korea.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't need the one-size-fits-all strategy we had in the past,"
the senior administration official said.</TE>
<TE>   Diplomacy Not Enough</TE>
<TE>   Robert J. Einhorn, a proliferation expert with the Center for
Strategic and International Studies in Washington who helped draft
the Clinton policy, said it was always clear that diplomacy alone
would not erase the proliferation threat.</TE>
<TE>   "It was recognized all along that multilateral schemes only get
you so far and that the hard cases -- Iran, Iraq and North Korea --
require targeted strategies," Einhorn said.</TE>
<TE>   Sept. 11 has intensified that move.</TE>
<TE>   "There has been less emphasis on multilateral solutions and more
emphasis on preventing these countries from getting these weapons in
the first place," Einhorn said. "The question is how you do it."</TE>
<TE>   Some may see the new strategy as another effort by the
administration to beat the drums of war against Iraq, the Monterey
Institute's Spector said. But it could also help the cause of those
who oppose war by making the threat more real and forcing Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein to back down.</TE>
<TE>   "This document probably serves both camps," Spector said.</TE>

<DL>ADDIS ABABA, Ethiopia</DL>
<LD>U.S. Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld met with Horn of Africa
leaders Tuesday and received pledges of support for fighting
terrorism in the region, which was shaken by attacks in nearby Kenya
last month for which Al Qaeda claimed responsibility.</LD>
<LD>   Rumsfeld said his meetings with the leaders of Ethiopia and
Eritrea aimed to build relations rather than seek specific
military-related help in combating terrorist activity in the region,
to which some Al Qaeda fighters had fled from Afghanistan.</LD>
<LD>   "There is no question that the Horn of Africa and indeed many
parts of the world are home to terrorist groups, including Al Qaeda,"
Rumsfeld said at a media briefing after talks with Ethiopian Prime
Minister Meles Zenawi. Meles vowed full backing for the war on
terrorism.</LD>

<HD>U.S. Wants Iraqi Scientists Questioned</HD>
<DH>Officials push a plan for U.N. inspectors to summon arms
experts alone and in groups, in hopes that a few will divulge
secrets.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Robin Wright</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The United States, in a bid to keep Saddam Hussein guessing, has
proposed that U.N. inspectors adopt a strategy of summoning key Iraqi
scientists individually and in groups of as large as 50 to multiple
interviews both in and outside Iraq, Bush administration officials
said Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   The goal is to get to at least five or six key specialists in each
of the four categories of Iraq's alleged arms programs -- nuclear,
chemical weapons, biological weapons and ballistic missiles -- to
obtain detailed evidence to the United Nations about Baghdad's
arsenal.</LD>
<LD>   Discussions between the U.S. and the U.N. about the plan are
continuing, particularly about how to persuade the scientists to take
the multiple risks involved in revealing military secrets. The U.S.
is seeking to protect the scientists, engineers and technicians from
retaliation by confusing Hussein's regime about whom or what the
United Nations is after, U.S. officials say.</LD>
<TE>   The Bush administration hopes that the scientists will produce
enough corroborating information to convince the international
community that Iraq is still hiding weapons systems -- even if the
U.N. team is unable to verify that in its site inspections,
administration officials said. The White House insists that Iraq is
still pursuing programs to develop weapons of mass destruction. Iraq
insists that it is not.</TE>
<TE>   The United States has identified more than 500 specialists from an
estimated 18,000 scientists, engineers and technicians who have
worked on Iraq's deadliest weapons during the last two decades, the
sources said.</TE>
<TE>   The strategy for interviewing them reflects concern among several
senior U.S. officials that a major break appears unlikely within the
next three to four months -- Washington's preferred time frame for a
denouement in the inspections.</TE>
<TE>   "Now that the Iraqi declaration is in, the scientists will become
a hugely important tool," said a senior State Department official who
requested anonymity.</TE>
<TE>   The hardest part, officials say, will be getting the first
scientist to agree to talk. "We're looking for that one person who
will deliver the chicken farm. We're looking for one string to pull
so we can begin to unravel the whole thing," the State Department
official said.</TE>
<TE>   "Chicken farm" refers to the 1995 defection of Hussein's
son-in-law, an event that led to the discovery of a chicken farm with
several containers full of hidden Iraqi arms documents -- the most
important discovery in the U.N.'s disarmament effort. The son-in-law
was later lured back to Iraq and killed.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S.-generated plan underscores a growing awareness that
getting Iraqi scientists to talk will be far more difficult than it
appears, according to former U.N. inspectors, Iraqi defectors and
U.S. officials.</TE>
<TE>   The Iraqi regime has such a tight hold on its arms experts that
there has not been a major defection by a top scientist since 1994 or
by a top official involved in the weapons industry since 1995,
according to other Iraqi defectors and former U.N. arms inspectors.</TE>
<TE>   Many Iraqi specialists would be willing to talk, said Khaidar
Hamza, who worked on Iraq's nuclear program and defected in 1994.
"The majority of scientists don't like the government or the thuggish
family running the country, confiscating property, enriching
themselves, restricting movement, threatening their families," Hamza
said.</TE>
<TE>   Yet waiting for scientists or engineers to approach the U.N. teams
will be "waiting for the impossible," said David Albright, a former
nuclear inspector in Iraq who now is president of the Institute for
Science and International Security.</TE>
<TE>   "No one will volunteer due to the fear of consequences," added
Martin Indyk, who dealt with Iraqi defectors while on the Clinton
administration's National Security Council.</TE>
<TE>   In the early 1990s, two Iraqi arms specialists slipped notes to
U.N. inspectors offering to talk, but nothing came of either case.</TE>
<TE>   But any attempt by Baghdad to block access -- or to say arms
specialists are not available, have retired, are dead or cannot be
found -- will amount to a material breach of the U.N. resolution
authorizing inspections, U.S. officials are already warning.</TE>
<TE>   "If anyone should show up black or blue, that would also be seen
as a sign of poor Iraqi cooperation," the State Department official
said.</TE>
<TE>   An 11,807-page arms declaration that Iraq handed over to
inspectors over the weekend is supposed to provide a full list of all
personnel involved in the various programs.</TE>
<TE>   Speed will be essential once scientists are interviewed because
Hussein's regime has long had a team in place, headed by Hussein's
son Qusai, to move research, clean up development facilities or
eliminate evidence after past defections, according to former
defectors, former inspectors and former U.S. officials.</TE>
<TE>   "Getting a defector would be the best source of information, but
you'd have to get a defector and act within 24 to 48 hours, go to
that facility before it can be sanitized -- and that's very hard,"
said Kenneth Pollack, an Iraq specialist on the National Security
Council during both the Clinton and current administrations.</TE>
<TE>   The administration is particularly sensitive to fears among Iraqis
that they might be seen as selling out their country, particularly if
American intelligence runs the program, U.S. officials and former
inspectors say. Working with the United Nations, on the other hand,
would allow them to appear to be part of an international effort to
save Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   "Iraqi scientists are not going to go to the CIA. If they do,
they're done as Iraqis. They might as well just plan to move to
Detroit and open a 7-Eleven. Those who believe in Iraq and want to
help in a post-Saddam Iraq will want to go to the U.N. and be able to
say they didn't betray their country," said one well-placed U.S.
official who requested anonymity.</TE>
<TE>   National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice heads a team working on
a plan to expedite the process of "finding who knows where the
skeletons are buried" while winning U.N. agreement to the plan, he
added.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, chief U.N. inspector Hans Blix warned that he didn't
want to become a "defection agency," although U.S. officials say that
Blix generally agrees on the importance of questioning scientists and
other potential human resources in Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   To keep the plan from appearing to be a CIA-run operation, the
Bush administration is urging the U.N. to organize a cadre of arms
specialists from around the world to do the interviews. In the past,
the CIA has debriefed most Iraqi defectors.</TE>
<TE>   Countries mentioned by U.S. officials include Australia, which has
many specialists on chemical weapons; Central European nations that
developed major arms industries during the Cold War; and India, which
has a nuclear program.</TE>

<HD>Ship Seized; N. Korean Arms Found</HD>
<DH>Indications are that Scud missiles were headed for Yemen,
possibly for resale.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Sonni Efron and John Hendren</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Spanish authorities seized a merchant ship in the Arabian Sea on
Tuesday and discovered about a dozen North Korean Scud missiles and
extra missile parts, U.S. officials said.</LD>
<LD>   Preliminary evidence suggested that the ship was headed for Yemen
and not Iraq. Analysts said Yemen might have been a transfer or
resale point.</LD>
<LD>   With tensions growing in the region because of possible U.S.
action against Iraq, the seizure raises important questions about how
and when the United States will enforce its promise to intercept
shipments of weapons of mass destruction -- particularly items such
as missiles, whose sales are not banned under international law.</LD>
<TE>   Some analysts also saw the action as an indication of a stiffening
U.S. resolve to pressure North Korea to abandon its nuclear program
by cutting the nation off from its customers for lucrative missile
sales.</TE>
<TE>   "If they're shipping missiles, we're going to do what we can to
stop them," a senior administration official said.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. intelligence had been tracking the ship for some time before
a Spanish vessel intercepted it about 600 miles east of the Horn of
Africa. The fate of the ship and the crew members, who identified
themselves as North Korean, was unclear Tuesday, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts said the missiles could have been destined for one of
North Korea's other suspected arms clients, which include Pakistan,
Iran, Egypt, Libya and Syria. Iraq used Scuds against Israel and
Saudi Arabia in the 1991 Persian Gulf War, and some Soviet-era Scuds
have ended up in terrorist hands.</TE>
<TE>   The vessel was boarded in international waters because it carried
no national flag and was suspected of illicit activity, U.S.
officials said. The Spanish authorities were believed to be part of a
multinational force patrolling the area to enforce United Nations
sanctions against Iraq, but that was not why the ship was boarded, a
U.S. government source said.</TE>
<TE>   "They were following a strange course, they had painted over the
name [of the vessel] and taken off their flags," the senior
administration official said.</TE>
<TE>   "When the Spanish attempted to figure out who they were and what
they were doing, they started taking evasive measures," the
government source said.</TE>
<TE>   A ship not flying a flag is effectively stateless -- and thus in
violation of international maritime law and fair game to be boarded
by any other vessel, said John Ellison, a maritime lawyer at Anderson
Kill &amp; Olick in Philadelphia.</TE>
<TE>   The United States and other nations routinely stop ships on the
high seas if the vessels are believed to be running drugs or other
illicit cargo, and may fire across their bows to force them to halt,
the senior administration official said. But authorities contact
either the government of the nation in which the ship is registered
or the ship owner before boarding the vessel.</TE>
<TE>   This ship was essentially a pirate vessel that could claim no
sovereign protection.</TE>
<TE>   "That's just a big mistake," Ellison said. "I bet that's not going
to happen again."</TE>
<TE>   U.S. military officials are now on board, and authorities are
talking to "a number of different parties" -- presumably including
Spain, North Korea or its intermediaries, and nearby port officials
-- about what to do.</TE>
<TE>   "Presumably somebody owns the cargo," the administration official
said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not clear what happens now," the government source said.
"We're still in the information-gathering stage."</TE>
<TE>   Iran and Pakistan have been North Korea's best clients for
ballistic missiles, said Joel S. Wit, a former State Department
expert on Korea who is now at the Center for Strategic and
International Studies in Washington. "Yemen has bought Scuds ... and
missile parts, but I wouldn't characterize them as a major client."</TE>
<TE>   Officials identified the missiles on the ship as Scuds, which have
a range of about 180 to 300 miles.</TE>
<TE>   The Clinton administration tried using the threat of sanctions
against missile buyers, but the penalties were not sufficiently
great, said Robert J. Einhorn, who was a State Department official in
the Clinton administration and is now also at the Center for
Strategic and International Studies.</TE>
<TE>   "This administration has decided it wanted a more effective and
muscular approach to stopping these North Korean exports," Einhorn
said.</TE>
<TE>   Wit said the Bush administration's strategy appeared designed to
encourage North Korea's neighbors to pressure it to stop its uranium
enrichment program, while at the same time trying to cut off the
cash-starved regime in Pyongyang from would-be weapons buyers.</TE>
<TE>   The administration had been trying to crack down on North Korean
missile exports long before Pyongyang's admission this fall that it
had a secret program to enrich uranium, but it is extremely difficult
to halt such exports without very good intelligence to justify
stopping and searching ships at sea, former officials said.</TE>
<TE>   "It could be that the administration is now assigning a higher
priority" to gathering such intelligence, said Mitchell Reiss, a
former National Security Council official who is now dean of
international affairs at the College of William &amp; Mary in
Williamsburg, Va.</TE>
<TE>   In 1993, the United States suspected a Chinese merchant ship, the
Yinhe, which was traveling from China to Iran, of carrying chemicals
that could be used to make poison gas. Washington arranged for the
ship to be searched in Saudi Arabia. The inspection strained
relations with the Chinese and turned up no chemical weapons
materials.</TE>
<TE>   Richard L. Armitage, deputy secretary of State, has justified the
searching of ships, citing the right of self-defense as specified in
the U.N. Charter.</TE>
<TE>   The nightmare scenario is that North Korea could ramp up its
nuclear program, generate enough enriched uranium for 20 to 30 bombs
per year, and start exporting the surplus, Reiss said.</TE>
<TE>   "If it's so difficult to stop the export of ballistic missiles,
which are big and bulky, and we know where the production facilities
are, we hope, how much more difficult is it going to be to stop the
export of nuclear weapons-grade material or even assembled bombs?"
Reiss said.</TE>
<TE>   "This incident raises the question of how very difficult it is to
stop the export of sensitive technology," he added. "Is North Korea
violating any laws by exporting these ballistic missiles? Absolutely
not. So this is a useful step for the U.S., but it doesn't solve the
underlying problem."</TE>
<TE>   That approach may not go over well in South Korea, where
anti-Americanism is on the rise and the lame-duck administration of
President Kim Dae Jung favors a diplomatic resolution to the North
Korean nuclear issues.</TE>
<TE>   Armitage met with Kim in Seoul on Tuesday to explain U.S. policy
on Iraq and North Korea. A U.S. official said he briefed Kim on the
ship situation before news of the intercept became public.</TE>
<TE>   "We reaffirmed our common interest in finding a diplomatic
solution to North Korea's destabilizing pursuit of nuclear and other
weapons," Armitage said.</TE>
<TE>   Kim apparently was unswayed by Armitage's position that dialogue
should not continue until the North has shown evidence of giving up
its nuclear program. According to Kim's spokeswoman, the president
replied to Armitage, "We must strengthen diplomatic efforts."</TE>
<TE>   There was no official reaction early today to the ship's
interception. One prominent analyst with ties to the Kim
administration said the export of Scuds to Yemen was nothing new.</TE>
<TE>   "You wonder why the Bush administration is making this an issue at
this particular time," said Lee Jong Seok, an expert on North Korea.
"It has been known for years that North Korea is exporting missiles.
The United States is an exporter of missiles, too."</TE>
<TE>   Times staff writer Barbara Demick in Seoul contributed to this
report.</TE>

<HD>Tanker Leaks May Continue Until 2006</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>MADRID</DL>
<LD>A tanker that spilled 5 million gallons of oil off northwestern Spain
before it split in two and sank is leaking about 33,000 gallons of
oil every day, officials said Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   The leaks from the tanker Prestige could continue into 2006, said
Emilio Lora Tamayo, who led a scientific commission studying the
disaster. It was more bad news for the Spanish coast, one of the
world's richest fishing areas, which has been tarred by the oil
washing ashore.</LD>
<LD>   "We can seal the cracks, not all of them," Lora Tamayo said. "Or
we can try to pump out the remaining oil."</LD>
<TE>   The Prestige sank Nov. 19, six days after its hull cracked in a
storm, and took about 15 million gallons of oil to the bottom of the
Atlantic. Spanish officials insisted then that the oil wasn't a
threat because near-freezing temperatures two miles below the ocean's
surface would cause the fuel to solidify.</TE>
<TE>   Deputy Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy said the oil is leaking from
several cracks in the ship.</TE>
<TE>   Rajoy said officials were watching a slick measuring 35 by 11
miles on the water above the tanker, 152 miles out to sea. He said
ships were working to scoop up at least two major slicks about 50
miles offshore.</TE>
<TE>   The ships and fishermen in smaller boats have scooped up 3.4
million gallons so far.</TE>

<DH>The discovery outside Jerusalem ends a rare missing-child
search that had gripped the nation. Suspicion falls on the girl's
father.</DH>

<DL>JERUSALEM</DL>
<LD>In a desolate, rain-soaked field on the outskirts of Jerusalem,
Israeli police Tuesday found the body of a 22-month-old girl who had
disappeared three days earlier from her father's home, marking the
sad end to a search that had captivated the nation.</LD>
<LD>   Missing-child cases, all too common in much of the West and
particularly in the United States, are a rarity here, and millions of
Israelis treated the disappearance of Hodaya Kedem-Pimstein almost as
they would a tragedy in their own families.</LD>
<LD>   Police said the girl's father was the prime suspect. He was
already under arrest when the body was found, and authorities said
they intended to go to court today to seek to keep him in custody
while they gathered more evidence. The case had dominated Israeli
newspaper headlines and radio and television newscasts since the girl
went missing Saturday, garnering an extraordinary amount of attention
in a land where the daily drumbeat of violence -- suicide bombings,
shooting attacks, military confrontations in the West Bank and Gaza
Strip -- rarely falls silent.</LD>
<TE>   Even with more than 6 million people, Israel at times has the feel
of a village, and this was one of those times. People talked about
the toddler's disappearance in shops, on buses, at office gatherings,
sometimes calling her by name, sometimes referring only to "the
little one." Photographs of Hodaya, curly-haired and chubby-cheeked,
looked out each day from the front pages of the major newspapers.</TE>
<TE>   When the news broke Tuesday afternoon that her body had been
found, word spread quickly. In one Jerusalem restaurant, a waiter
came out of the kitchen and told the diners, who sighed, shook their
heads and asked him for details.</TE>
<TE>   The intense interest in the case was heightened Sunday when a
5-year-old Arab girl was reported missing in East Jerusalem, but
police eventually said that case appeared to have been a dispute
involving rival clans.</TE>
<TE>   Police said suspicion fell quickly on Hodaya's father, Eli
Pimstein, who reportedly gave inconsistent statements to authorities
about the disappearance and subsequent events. He said publicly
several times that the child apparently wandered out of his house
while he was in the bathroom.</TE>
<TE>   Pimstein and the child's mother, Roni Kedem, are separated, and
the girl was visiting her father when she disappeared.</TE>
<TE>   The Jerusalem neighborhood where Hodaya vanished, a working-class
enclave called Kiryat Yovel, was the scene of two recent suicide
bombings by Palestinian militants. But Israeli authorities, for
reasons they said they preferred not to detail, swiftly ruled out any
involvement by Palestinians.</TE>
<TE>   Thousands of volunteers on foot and horseback helped search for
the child Sunday and Monday, combing wooded areas and back roads in
and around Kiryat Yovel.</TE>
<TE>   Police, who imposed a blackout on many details of the case, didn't
say how they knew to look in the muddy field where they recovered the
body from a shallow grave. The child's clothes were found nearby.</TE>
<TE>   News reports alluded, though gingerly, to alleged domestic
troubles between the girl's parents. Israeli television reported that
Pimstein, who had lost his job, had stopped making child-support and
other payments to Hodaya's mother.</TE>
<TE>   Both parents gave highly emotional interviews as the search
dragged on. Kedem sobbed and pleaded with anyone who might have
information to come forward.</TE>
<TE>   Pimstein broke into tears during radio interviews hours before the
body was discovered, saying he didn't mind the tough questioning by
police because he wanted to do all he could to help them find his
daughter.</TE>

<HD>Venezuelans Slip Deeper Into Crisis</HD>
<DH>As strike faces a 10th day, efforts to resolve the conflict
over the president reach a stalemate. Fears of violence and chaos
grow.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>CARACAS, Venezuela -- Hopes for a quick solution to this country's
political crisis seemed to fade Tuesday as legislative efforts
stalled, negotiations foundered, attacks against the media increased
and nearly half the Supreme Court walked out in protest.</LD>
<LD>   The developments created a stalemate in attempts to resolve the
conflict between President Hugo Chavez and his opponents in
Venezuela, the third-largest supplier of oil to the U.S.</LD>
<LD>   Oil exports remained shut down, gasoline continued running short,
and the opposition announced that it would carry on a nationwide
strike for a 10th day. As efforts to end the protest fell short,
fears were growing about a possible descent into violence, such as
when Chavez was briefly ousted in a coup in April before being
restored by loyal troops.</LD>
<TE>   "At the highest levels of government, this is a matter of
concern," said a U.S. official.</TE>
<TE>   Chavez's opponents, a coalition that includes businesses, unions
and major media groups, accuse him of ruining the country and want
him to resign and hold early elections. The president insists that
the constitution forbids a binding referendum until August.</TE>
<TE>   There seemed to be little willingness to compromise. With Cesar
Gaviria, the secretary-general of the Organization of American
States, mediating, the sides discussed a variety of electoral
possibilities, including creating a new elections council and
allowing an early vote.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't say we've advanced much," Gaviria said at the end of
three hours of talks. The strike was to continue today.</TE>
<TE>   Denying that the strike was succeeding, Chavez's allies insisted
that they had regained control of the country's state oil company,
PDVSA, and had managed to patch together a skeleton network of
refinery workers, truck drivers and tanker crews to get gasoline
flowing.</TE>
<TE>   "If we can resolve [the problems with] PDVSA in the next few days,
the country will return to normalcy," said Nicolas Maduro, a
government negotiator and pro-Chavez congressman. "We believe we will
be able to achieve this."</TE>
<TE>   Gas distributors, however, described an ad hoc system in which
inexperienced workers were causing delays, crashing trucks and
writing down orders on slips of paper.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a mess," one dealer said.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, moderate allies of Chavez tried to introduce a bill in
the National Assembly that would be the first step to a
constitutional amendment that would permit early elections.</TE>
<TE>   But opposition deputies -- who, in support of the protesters, have
not attended a session since the strike began Dec. 2 -- failed to
attend, leaving the assembly without a quorum. Chavez allies hold a
slim majority of the 165 National Assembly seats.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, interviews with opposition and government deputies
showed that support for the amendment was weak, with both sides
resisting the bill for different reasons.</TE>
<TE>   Deputies with Chavez's political party, the Fifth Republic
Movement, said they insisted on the appointment of a new electoral
council before discussions could begin on a constitutional amendment
-- a process that could take months.</TE>
<TE>   And opposition deputies said they simply didn't trust the
government.</TE>
<TE>   "We need a solid commitment from them. So far, they haven't made
good on these kinds of promises.... They don't have any credit," said
Jose Luis Farias, a congressman of the Solidarity party.</TE>
<TE>   Further complicating the picture, eight of the 20 Supreme Court
justices announced that they were suspending all nonessential
judicial activities to protest recent actions by the legislature to
remove the court's first vice president.</TE>
<TE>   The legislature accused Franklin Arriechi of lying on his resume
when he was named to the court. Critics said the removal was
retribution for an Arriechi ruling that exonerated some of the April
coup leaders.</TE>
<TE>   It was unclear what effect the justices' protest would have; there
is at least one complaint before the court related to a proposed
referendum in February on Chavez's rule.</TE>
<TE>   "Until the harassment, insults and persecution against us cease
and dignified, objective and subjective conditions exist for the
administration of justice, we will abstain from participating in
Supreme Court activities that are not strictly related to
guaranteeing access to justice," said Alberto Martinez, one of the
eight jurists.</TE>
<TE>   Chavez supporters surrounded television and radio stations
throughout the country for a second night Tuesday, further
aggravating tensions. On Monday, at least one television station was
ransacked.</TE>
<TE>   Chavez has denounced the media, accusing them of "almost criminal"
behavior in suggesting that he had something to do with an attack
against an anti-Chavez protest last week that left three dead. The
one person under arrest in connection with the attack has given a
confused confession, and police told a local newspaper that tests
showed he was under the influence of drugs during the attack.</TE>
<TE>   "We are going to defend our independence," said Marcel Granier,
owner of a TV station that was surrounded by peaceful protesters
banging pots and pans. "This is approaching the territory of
genocide."</TE>

<HD>SEC Gets a Chief From Wall Street</HD>
<DH>William Donaldson, a former investment banker, is nominated
to replace Harvey Pitt.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jonathan Peterson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>President Bush on Tuesday nominated William H. Donaldson, a former
investment banker, academic and Wall Street official, to head the
beleaguered Securities and Exchange Commission, in a move aimed at
restoring confidence in the financial integrity of corporate America.</LD>
<LD>   Donaldson would replace Harvey L. Pitt, who resigned last month
after a series of controversies that raised questions about his
ability to be a tough overseer of Wall Street amid this year's
torrent of business scandals.</LD>
<LD>   Bush, in a turnabout, also announced plans to almost double the
budget of the SEC, which has struggled to protect shareholders in an
era when the public's financial security has become increasingly
linked to the fortunes of company stock through retirement plans,
college accounts and other savings.</LD>
<TE>   "The health and future of the American economy depends heavily on
the honesty of American business and the integrity of the securities
markets," Bush said as he introduced Donaldson at the White House.
"Investors must have completely fair and accurate information to make
sound investment decisions."</TE>
<TE>   Donaldson, he said, "will be a strong leader with a clear mission
-- to vigorously enforce our nation's laws against corporate
corruption and to uphold the highest standards of integrity in the
securities markets."</TE>
<TE>   The 71-year-old Donaldson, a Bush family friend, sought a folksy
way of saying the SEC should become a more effective watchdog: "As my
mother used to say many years ago, it's time for all of us to pull up
our socks."</TE>
<TE>   He added, "I am firmly committed to doing everything that I can do
to restore the confidence of investors in the U.S. corporate and
financial industry." But he said it would be inappropriate for him to
be more specific about his priorities before his Senate confirmation
hearings.</TE>
<TE>   The SEC, an agency long considered insulated from political
controversy, suffered a blow to its image this year after a flurry of
revelations that major companies had misrepresented their books.
Enron Corp., WorldCom Inc. and Global Crossing Ltd. were among the
most widely publicized cases that have eroded investor confidence and
cost thousands of workers their jobs as the firms were forced to file
for bankruptcy protection.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, Pitt, a top securities lawyer whom Bush named to the
SEC post in spring 2001, stumbled repeatedly. This year, he agreed to
private meetings with accounting executives even as the industry was
blasted for failing to root out corporate fraud. In the summer, Pitt
embarrassed the White House by lobbying to make the SEC chairmanship
a Cabinet position.</TE>
<TE>   In late October, it was revealed that Pitt had failed to disclose
to the four other SEC commissioners that his choice to run a new
accounting industry oversight board, William H. Webster, had headed
the audit committee of a company that has been sued by shareholders
alleging fraud. Pitt resigned Nov. 5.</TE>
<TE>   The choice of Donaldson, who is known as a plain-spoken, low-key,
consensus-oriented executive, came as a surprise to many observers.
It was the latest move by Bush in an overhaul of the White House
economic team.</TE>
<TE>   Reaction was generally favorable, with many citing Donaldson's
broad background and personable manner as likely to be helpful in the
task of rebuilding faith in the SEC and in corporate accounting.</TE>
<TE>   "No one could be a stronger symbol of the need to restore
integrity in the markets," said Jeffrey E. Garten, dean of the Yale
School of Management, of which Donaldson was the founding dean in
1975. "He's a wonderful communicator and a very savvy public
servant."</TE>
<TE>   Donaldson, a Marine rifle platoon leader in Korea, served in two
Republican administrations. He is a graduate of Yale, the alma mater
of the president and his father.</TE>
<TE>   Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette, the investment banking firm
Donaldson helped found, was a stalwart Republican contributor in the
1990s. The company made more than $2.5 million in so-called hard and
soft political contributions from 1992 to 2000, 67.6% to the GOP,
according to the database of Dwight L. Morris &amp; Associates. The firm
was bought by Credit Suisse First Boston in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Donaldson gave up day-to-day management of the investment firm in
1973. He served as an undersecretary in the State Department in the
mid-1970s, during the administrations of Richard Nixon and Gerald
Ford.</TE>
<TE>   He went on to the dean's job at the Yale School of Management and
later was chairman of the New York Stock Exchange from 1990 to 1995.</TE>
<TE>   In recent years, he has served as chairman of health-care giant
Aetna Inc.</TE>
<TE>   In his new role, Donaldson would be expected to marshal support
for Bush's proposed SEC budget increase to $800 million or more in
fiscal 2004 from the current level of $438 million. The
administration had balked at such a large increase.</TE>
<TE>   The SEC also faces a major challenge in helping to launch the
accounting oversight board, which answers to the commission. Webster
stepped down Nov. 12, so the SEC will have to find a new head for the
board.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, the SEC is negotiating with major brokerages a
sweeping settlement of allegations of widespread analyst misconduct
in the late 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   More broadly, Donaldson's mission would be to renew public
confidence in the honesty of corporate financial data at a time when
the scandals have fanned broad cynicism.</TE>
<TE>   Observers Tuesday said they hoped Donaldson would prove to be a
steady, senior hand, providing a contrast to Pitt, whom many saw as a
brilliant thinker but lacking in political finesse.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone's going to listen to this guy," said Los Angeles venture
capitalist Steven Lebow, who got to know Donaldson while an employee
of Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette. "He's 71 years old. He doesn't need
money. He's not afraid of anybody, and it won't take him a year to
figure things out. This is one of those times when a single person
can make a big difference, and I think Bill Donaldson is really going
to step up."</TE>
<TE>   Still, reviews were not 100% favorable. Some recalled Donaldson's
tenure as chairman of the New York Stock Exchange as less than
stellar.</TE>
<TE>   "No one was impressed particularly with him as chairman" of the
stock exchange, said Andrew M. Klein, a Washington attorney and
former director of the SEC's division of market regulation. "On the
other hand, I'm not sure what they expected."</TE>
<TE>   The nomination "is an effort to calm down Wall Street, calm down
the commission, stop having legal combat among the commissioners and
try to get some business done," Klein said. "Maybe it will do that."</TE>
<TE>   Donaldson is certain to face questions into his recent ties to
companies including Aetna.</TE>
<TE>   "I look forward to a thorough confirmation process in which Mr.
Donaldson's record will be carefully examined and his views on the
challenges facing the SEC fully reviewed," said Sen. Paul S. Sarbanes
(D-Md.), chairman of the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs
Committee.</TE>
<TE>   Others on Capitol Hill were more openly enthusiastic. Donaldson's
"understanding of Wall Street dynamics and his experience in both the
private sector and as a securities regulator make him a first-rate
choice for SEC chairman," said Rep. Michael G. Oxley (R-Ohio),
co-sponsor with Sarbanes of a landmark accounting reform bill passed
by Congress in the summer and signed into law by Bush.</TE>
<TE>   "The SEC desperately needs someone who both has a deep knowledge
of how the markets function and at the same time possesses a
rock-ribbed integrity," said Sen. Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.), also
on the Banking Committee. "Bill Donaldson is such a man."</TE>
<TE>   In the financial world, investors Tuesday drew a favorable
contrast between Donaldson and his brash predecessor.</TE>
<TE>   Thomas H. Lee, founder of a Boston investment firm that bears his
name, said that Pitt, as a former SEC general counsel, was "really
steeped in the laws and operations" of the agency but that Donaldson
would be a more reassuring public face and better able to help in the
primary job of repairing confidence.</TE>
<TE>   Donaldson, said Lee, is the "soul of probity."</TE>
<TE>   Hardwick Simmons, chief executive of the Nasdaq Stock Market,
described Donaldson as a consensus builder who will restore the
morale of SEC staff.</TE>
<TE>   "Bill is relatively low-key," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "The contentiousness and the political environment that have been
part of the agency for the last eight or nine months will disappear,
and you'll see a much more civil organization."</TE>

<HD>Day of the Jewish Trojan</HD>
<DH>USC's recruitment effort makes significant gains,
countering the school's embarrassing history of sometimes alienating
Jews.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Stuart Silverstein</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the University of Southern California admissions office,
Jessica F. Pashkow works alongside colleagues who specialize in
bringing Latino and black undergraduates to campus, a goal of many
universities around the country.</LD>
<LD>   Pashkow's job is a rarer sort: She recruits Jews.</LD>
<LD>   She urges co-workers -- only half jokingly -- to alert her to top
prospects whose last names end, for example, in "berg," "baum" or
"bloom." She makes the rounds of college fairs at high schools in
Southern California's Jewish neighborhoods. Wherever she goes, she
strategically places "Jewish Life at USC" brochures on the edge of
her display table.</LD>
<TE>   If someone picks up a copy, Pashkow discreetly mentions her role
in Jewish recruitment. Often, parents "pull back a little bit and
say, 'Really'?" said Pashkow, who is Jewish. "They want to make sure
we're doing it for a kosher reason."</TE>
<TE>   The school figures it has plenty. Among them are to heal
old wounds and showcase USC's academic assets to a community that,
perhaps more than most, has seen the school as the University of
Second Choice. Many people with USC ties privately say the university
is trying to win over more Jewish donors too.</TE>
<TE>   USC has a long and embarrassing history of offending Jews. Its
past includes a longtime president who was rumored to be a Nazi
sympathizer, a cross-burning incident on a Jewish fraternity house
lawn and an uproar in the dentistry school involving alumni
accusations that a dean was "pro-Jewish."</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, many top-notch Jewish students came to view
USC's undergraduate programs as academically inferior, opting instead
for UCLA, UC Berkeley or the Ivy League. "It was not on the screen in
the Jewish community," said Rabbi Jonathan Klein, the 33-year-old
director of the USC Hillel Jewish Center, who is a 1992 UCLA
graduate.</TE>
<TE>   With the 1991 arrival of President Steven B. Sample -- a white
Episcopalian with an affinity for Jewish culture and a commitment to
diversity -- the university acted swiftly to upgrade its academic
standing. It has climbed in U.S. News &amp; World Report's rankings of
major national universities to 31st, tied with UC San Diego, the
University of Wisconsin and Brandeis University.</TE>
<TE>   One of its important initiatives was to court Jewish Los Angeles,
a community known for its success in education, not to mention the
arts, sciences, professions and business.</TE>
<TE>   "There was this very explicit, studied, intentional effort to
dramatically improve the academic strength of the undergraduate
student body, and that meant going out and getting the best students,
wherever they may be -- and some of those are Jews," Sample said in a
recent interview.</TE>
<TE>   They weren't hard to locate.</TE>
<TE>   "We went as far as the 405," said USC Board of Trustees Chairman
Stanley Gold, laughing. The freeway runs past Jewish neighborhoods
less than 10 miles west of campus. "It's a natural here."</TE>
<TE>   In fact, USC sits amid the second largest Jewish population in the
nation -- Jews number about 600,000 in Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   Sample had an assessment done of USC's Jewish resources, and found
they were surprisingly vast: One-third of the faculty was Jewish, as
were one-third of the deans and up to 2,000 of the campus' more than
27,000 students, although many were in graduate or professional
schools.</TE>
<TE>   USC officials knew, too, that a good portion of the university's
major donors through its 122 years have been Jewish. And although USC
leaders say their outreach isn't intended as a fund-raising ploy,
they acknowledge that Jews are giving more money to the university
than ever.</TE>
<TE>   Sample also determined that USC had an unheralded asset in Hebrew
Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion, which is next to USC and
offers courses in Jewish studies that USC students can take for
credit.</TE>
<TE>   Armed with that information, he went out on the synagogue speaking
circuit. By May 1994, Sample was honored by the Jewish Federation
Council of Greater Los Angeles for his commitment "to the principles
of building bridges between the university and the community."</TE>
<TE>   To mark the honor, he was given a shofar -- a ram's horn blown
repeatedly during the Rosh Hashana High Holy Day services, producing
a piercing sound.</TE>
<TE>   Sample, relying on his background as both a musician and engineer,
put the tip of the horn between his lips and belted out a blast.</TE>
<TE>   "They were amazed I could do it," he said with a chuckle. "I'm one
of the few Episcopalians you'll ever meet who can actually blow a
shofar."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Today, a Jewish touch is evident all over campus.</TE>
<TE>   USC's dean of religious life, Susan Laemmle, is a reform rabbi. A
cooler in the student center is stocked with kosher food. The campus
is home to the 4-year-old Casden Institute for the Study of the
Jewish Role in American Life, which organizes academic lectures and
conferences, as well as public forums on issues affecting the local
Jewish community.</TE>
<TE>   Efforts like Pashkow's have paid off. USC officials point to an
apparent spurt in Jewish freshmen enrollment. According to the
university's informal polling, the percentage of Jews in this year's
freshman class is 8.2%, up from 4.6% a decade ago. That's still far
below the 20%-plus level estimated for some Ivy League schools, but
comparable with UCLA, where the latest available survey showed that
7% of freshmen were Jews.</TE>
<TE>   Jews also have become more influential in the leadership of USC. A
symbolic breakthrough came in September, when businessman Gold became
chairman of the board of trustees. (A Jewish newspaper, Forward,
headlined the story: "Once-WASPy USC Names First Jew as Board
Chair.")</TE>
<TE>   History has taken quite a turn since the long reign of Rufus B.
von KleinSmid, who ran USC as its president from 1922 to 1946, and
then remained a presence on campus as chancellor until his death in
1964.</TE>
<TE>   While Von KleinSmid's defenders say his supposed antipathy toward
Jews was nothing more than rumor, others over the years said they
suspected him of being a Nazi sympathizer. His imperious, autocratic
style and Germanic name fanned the negative speculation.</TE>
<TE>   Frances Lomas Feldman, the 90-year-old historian of USC's faculty
senate and an emeritus professor of social work, said she had cordial
conversations with Von KleinSmid dating back to the 1930s, when she
was a student at USC. She doubts that he harbored anti-Semitic
hostilities.</TE>
<TE>   Yet Feldman, who is Jewish, said Von KleinSmid presided at a time
when various deans on campus, including some at the medical and
dental schools, rejected students simply because they were Jewish or
members of other minority groups. Admissions practices, she said,
"really depended on the dean of the school. I don't think Von
KleinSmid cared one way or another."</TE>
<TE>   Some of the ill will from those years and beyond was connected to
the university's strong fraternity and sorority culture. Jews for a
long time were unwelcome in many of the Greek groups. The Jewish
fraternities and sororities that arose in response occasionally
became targets of ugly incidents.</TE>
<TE>   One of the worst was a cross-burning on the lawn of a Jewish
fraternity house in 1946, presumably by fellow students. But some
anti-Semitism obviously lingered even 40 years later, when a
fraternity and sorority that lost a Greek Week competition to a
predominantly Jewish fraternity were suspended by USC officials after
they chanted anti-Jewish remarks and painted "Jew Week" on the
sidewalk outside the winners' house.</TE>
<TE>   In the 1970s, two other controversies drew wide attention and
dismayed Jews. A non-Jewish dean of the dentistry school was
investigated in 1972 by a university committee after alumni
complained that he, among other things, was "pro-Jewish" in his
hiring decisions.</TE>
<TE>   Six years later, many Jews in Los Angeles were angered by USC's
plan to house a Middle East Center that, at the urging of Saudi
Arabian officials, was to be funded by American corporations doing
billions of dollars of business with the Saudis. The American Jewish
Committee charged that the unusual deal threatened the academic
integrity of the university, and later the faculty senate and a USC
advisory council both condemned the idea. USC ultimately backed away
from the deal.</TE>
<TE>   Although USC's relations with Los Angeles Jews have vastly
improved -- especially after an effort to hire more Jewish professors
and deans beginning in the 1960s -- old perceptions die hard.</TE>
<TE>   Morton Owen Schapiro, who was dean of USC's College of Letters,
Arts and Sciences until becoming president of Williams College in
Massachusetts two years ago, said that when he was named to the USC
deanship in 1994, "It was shocking how many people would say, 'I
can't believe, at Letters, Arts and Sciences, a Jewish dean!' ''</TE>
<TE>   As Schapiro delights in pointing out, he actually was the fifth
consecutive Jewish dean of that college.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Many top universities are trying to make their campuses more
inviting for Jews by, say, adding or expanding Jewish studies
programs. But by assigning someone to recruit strong Jewish students
five years ago, USC took an unusual step in the competitive world of
college admissions.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps the only school to rival USC in this respect has been
Vanderbilt University in Nashville. Vanderbilt hired a rabbi two
years ago as an assistant to the provost to reach out to Jewish
organizations around the country, and it is adding three endowed
chairs in Jewish studies over the next four years.</TE>
<TE>   At USC, some of the parents Pashkow meets worry that universities
may be typecasting Jewish students as high achievers and pursuing
them in hopes of raising their institutions' average SAT scores.
(Last year, American students identifying themselves as Jewish
averaged 1161 on their SATs, 141 points above the national average
of 1020.) But Pashkow, a 31-year-old with a relaxed charm, said that
once she explains USC's intent, "they're very happy to know that
we're doing this."</TE>
<TE>   The USC application doesn't ask students to specify their
religious affiliation, and Pashkow is the only person among the two
dozen admissions officers to focus on Jewish recruitment. So she
encourages her co-workers to help ensure that all Jewish prospects
receive "Jewish Life at USC" brochures and answers to any questions.</TE>
<TE>   As a lighthearted reminder, Pashkow circulates around the
admissions office a three-page memo called "Jews Clues."</TE>
<TE>   The first piece of advice is to spot names ending in "baum,"
"berg," "burg," "bloom," "man," "stein," "thal," "vitz" or "witz."
Another dead giveaway mentioned in the memo: If applicants  mention
that they have had a bar or bat mitzvah.</TE>
<TE>   Her co-workers "think it's cute, they laugh at it," Pashkow said.
But the memo also prompts her colleagues to put a "JWSH" coding on
applications from Jewish students.</TE>
<TE>   The university has gained plaudits, and avoided controversy, by
including its outreach to Jewish students and the Los Angeles Jewish
community in a broader effort to achieve diversity on campus. USC is
well known for its outreach to blacks, Latinos and other minorities,
and has more foreign students than any other university in the
country. And leaders of various faiths on campus say they do not feel
slighted.</TE>
<TE>   Jewish students are responding to the university's interest. Rivka
Katz, a modern Orthodox Jewish student from Hancock Park, said that
until meeting Pashkow at a convention, she never thought of going to
USC.</TE>
<TE>   "When you thought of USC, you didn't think Jewish, and now that's
changing," said Katz, a 19-year-old sophomore who attends religious
services with other observant students at the new Chabad house.</TE>
<TE>   Recently, Pashkow gave a talk at the girls' campus of Valley Torah
High School, an Orthodox school in the east San Fernando Valley. She
mentioned that residential students who want access to kosher kitchen
facilities can live in "SChalom Housing," a floor for observant
Jewish students in a university apartment building. (Muslim students
live nearby, in a separate wing on the same floor.)</TE>
<TE>   The message left a favorable impression. "That they've created a
kosher floor is really beneficial, and it shows that they really
care." said Lauren Pietruszka, a Valley Torah senior from Tarzana who
said she plans to apply to USC.</TE>
<TE>   That's just the sort of idea that Pashkow tries to convey in her
effort to change USC's image. If all goes well, Pashkow says, perhaps
five to 10 years from now, her job will become obsolete.</TE>
<TE>   "At some point soon, Jewish students should just automatically
think of USC as an option," she said.</TE>

<DH>The park service is re-creating the Manzanar camp to teach
about Japanese internment during WWII.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bettina Boxall</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>MANZANAR, Calif.</DL>
<LD>A piece of Manzanar came home this week, trucked down U.S. 395 past
the snowy teeth of the Eastern Sierra to the empty flats on which it
once stood.</LD>
<LD>   The return of the weathered mess hall building is a small
milestone in a painstaking effort to tell an inglorious American war
story: the 1942 roundup of 120,000 West Coast residents of Japanese
descent and their internment in government camps.</LD>
<LD>   Ten thousand of them were sent here to a plain of stunning
scenery, biting winter wind and searing summer sun, where they
managed to fashion a community out of a charmless, instant town of
tar-papered barracks ringed by barbed wire.</LD>
<TE>   The Manzanar War Relocation Center, as it was called, was
dismantled after World War II, its 800 wooden buildings between
Independence and Lone Pine taken apart or carted away for use by
churches and local towns. Aside from a large auditorium later used by
county road crews, a couple of deteriorating stone guard gates and a
cemetery, not much was left except memories, some of them good, some
of them bad.</TE>
<TE>   The National Park Service is slowly changing that, as it gathers
the fading threads of the Manzanar story and endeavors to weave them
into an enduring public display of America at its less than best.</TE>
<TE>   For most of the millions who have driven 395 over the past
decades, Manzanar has been a barely noticed blur through the
windshield on the way to the ski slopes of Mammoth Mountain or the
campgrounds of Yosemite National Park.</TE>
<TE>   Even those who stopped and wandered past the camp's half-buried
rock gardens or picked fruit from its old, wind-bent trees often had
little sense of what happened here or what it meant.</TE>
<TE>   "I had no idea we interned 120,000 people. My mom didn't know,"
said John Slaughter, who grew up outside Los Angeles and as a
teenager hunted quail and picked pears at Manzanar on family trips to
the Eastern Sierra. He even had a favorite lunch spot, a rock
sculpture built by internees for one of their gardens. But he never
thought much about why the small granite boulders had been stacked in
the middle of nowhere or who had stacked them.</TE>
<TE>   He became more curious while working as a civilian employee at the
nearby China Lake Naval Weapons Center. Now the facility manager for
the Manzanar National Historic Site, it is Slaughter's job to make
the camp's history known.</TE>
<TE>   "The story really got to me," said Slaughter, 36, who lives in
Ridgecrest. "I come from a very conservative family and was never
told about that. Finding out our country was capable of doing that --
I was ashamed. And I'm ashamed a lot of people don't know and don't
get it."</TE>
<TE>   Chronicling Manzanar is no simple task. Many who lived here are
dead, and the pool of aging internees shrinks every year. More
critically, there is no single truth about Manzanar. There are many.</TE>
<TE>   For many, internment was a dreadful, humiliating experience, a
brutal reminder of America's racism and its historic demonization of
Asian immigrants. Families whose members had served in the U.S. Army,
become American citizens and barely knew a word of Japanese were
uprooted from their homes and businesses in the months after Pearl
Harbor and shipped to the Owens Valley, where the main product seemed
to be dust.</TE>
<TE>   They lived in military-style barracks, stood in chow lines to eat,
showered and went to the bathroom in communal latrines bereft of even
a shred of privacy.</TE>
<TE>   But they also made a life here, sending off for mail-order
furnishings to decorate their spartan quarters, pushing back the long
wooden dining tables for Saturday night dances in the mess halls,
planting their own victory gardens between barracks and even making
illicit booze in secretly excavated cellars.</TE>
<TE>   "I have never felt bitter against the government," said George
Izumi of Los Angeles, who was sent with his family to Manzanar when
he was 21 and remembers the experience as relatively benign. Had
Japanese Americans been left on the coast, he said, they probably
would have been attacked and harassed because they looked like the
enemy. "If someone had been killed on the street, no one would have
cared. It just would have been another dead 'Jap,' " he said
matter-of-factly.</TE>
<TE>   It is important, Izumi added, for the Park Service to memorialize
not only the camp, but what internees accomplished here.</TE>
<TE>   Many others describe Manzanar as a place of woe. In one of the
booklets of camp recollections given to schoolchildren who visit the
site, Rosie Maruki Kakuuchi paints a bleak picture.</TE>
<TE>   "The train ride to Manzanar was like we were being transported
like a criminal. The shades were drawn as we left the city.... After
the train ride we were bused into Manzanar Camp behind barbed wires
and sentry guards with machine guns. It was windy, dusty and
miserable.</TE>
<TE>   "We shared our room with two other families who were strangers,"
continued Kakuuchi, who was 16 when she arrived at Manzanar with her
family. "There was no privacy, only sheets hanging, separating each
family.... As a teenager, one of the hardest things to endure was the
communal latrines with no partitions and showers with no stalls. This
situation was embarrassing, humiliating and degrading."</TE>
<TE>   Some families spent the duration of the war at the camp; others
were allowed to move to cities in the interior of the U.S.; and some
men signed up for military service.</TE>
<TE>   Designated a national historic site in 1992, Manzanar is overseen
by a tiny staff with a small budget. Slaughter's office is a trailer
at the camp. Park rangers work out of cramped offices in nearby
Independence.</TE>
<TE>   In the last few years they have conducted focus groups and invited
the public to inspect and comment on planned exhibits. They have
gathered binders of camp photos taken by Dorothea Lange for the War
Relocation Authority and others taken by internee Toyo Miyatake. They
have recorded long interviews with former internees and people who
worked at the camp.</TE>
<TE>   They have scoured old real estate brochures and newspaper articles
for mention of Manzanar in the early 1900s, when it was promoted as
an orchardman's paradise. That was before the Los Angeles Department
of Water and Power bought up rights to the valley's water and piped
it south to the city.</TE>
<TE>   And they have hunted for Manzanar buildings that have not been
bastardized. "A lot of the buildings have been modified beyond the
ability to restore," Slaughter said. "We get calls all the time from
people who say 'I've got an old Manzanar building.' And it's been
converted into a duplex with two bathrooms -- it used to be a
Manzanar building."</TE>
<TE>   The mess hall, moved to Bishop after the war, is a comparative
gem. It was used for a few years as an infirmary by a military
training group stationed at the Bishop airfield and later became a
clubhouse for a sand golf course scratched out of the sagebrush next
to the airstrip. "I think it was more of a drinking society than
anything," Owens Valley native Fred Phillips, who works on the camp
maintenance crew, said with a chuckle.</TE>
<TE>   The building was subsequently used for storage and then abandoned.
But it was never carved up. The kitchen area still contained the huge
original iron stove used by camp cooks, as well as the walk-in
cooler.</TE>
<TE>   What's more, Inyo County was willing to donate the structure to
the Park Service. "Generally, what we hear is, 'I have a building,
how much will you give for it?' " Slaughter said. "And that's not
what we're about. We don't want to get in the real estate business,
buying up old buildings."</TE>
<TE>   Two sections of the hall were transported the 45 miles from Bishop
on Monday by a Southern California house-moving company. The other
half was scheduled to be trucked down today. The parts will be joined
together at a spot near the old camp auditorium, which is undergoing
a $5.2-million conversion into a visitors center scheduled to open
late next year.</TE>
<TE>   Along with the mess hall, the Park Service hopes to erect a couple
of original barracks and reconstruct some outbuildings to create a
small demonstration block that will provide visitors a glimpse of
Manzanar life.</TE>
<TE>   "It really helps bring back a flavor of what the site must have
looked like," Manzanar superintendent Frank Hays said after the first
two sections of the mess hall arrived at Block 14. "It's only one
building on a pretty flat expanse, but it does help you imagine what
it was like."</TE>

<HD>Friedman Appointment as Bush Advisor Put Off for a 2nd Day</HD>
<DH>Conservatives rally against choice for senior economic
aide, saying he doesn't back tax cuts.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Peter G. Gosselin</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>A leading Wall Street figure who was poised to become a senior
economic advisor to President Bush found himself the target of fierce
lobbying Tuesday by conservative activists who charge that he is
insufficiently enthusiastic about tax cuts to serve in the post.</LD>
<LD>   For a second day, the activists managed to delay the White House's
appointment of former Goldman Sachs Chairman Stephen Friedman to head
the National Economic Council, a spot vacated by the dismissal of
Bush economic advisor Lawrence B. Lindsey. The president had been
expected to announce Monday his choice of Friedman when he nominated
John W. Snow as his new Treasury secretary.</LD>
<LD>   The activists are particularly disturbed by Friedman's role as a
director of the Concord Coalition, a bipartisan group that crusades
against federal budget deficits.</LD>
<TE>   In choosing to pick a fight over the matter, they exposed a deep
rift between the anti-deficit and pro-growth wings of the Republican
Party that could spell big trouble for Bush and GOP congressional
leaders in trying to sell a new round of tax cuts early next year.</TE>
<TE>   "Our No. 1 objection to Friedman is that he has never really been
part of the supply-side, pro-growth club," said anti-tax activist
Stephen Moore.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no indication he has a supply-side bone in his body," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Moore heads the renegade political action committee Club for
Growth, which has financed successful campaigns that led to defeats
of moderate Republican lawmakers by conservative upstarts.</TE>
<TE>   Opposition to the 63-year-old Friedman, now a senior principal
with the private investment firm of Marsh &amp; McLennan Capital Inc.,
appears to reflect growing conservative nervousness that Bush is
tacking to the political center in dismissing Lindsey and tapping
Snow for the top Treasury post.</TE>
<TE>   Lindsey is widely respected on the right for helping to sell last
year's $1.35-trillion tax cut and writing a book-length defense of
former President Reagan's supply-side tax cuts of the early 1980s.</TE>
<TE>   Snow, as chairman of the rail giant CSX Corp. and head of the
Business Roundtable in the 1990s, lobbied for the deficit deals that
included tax increases as well as spending reductions.</TE>
<TE>   The objections to Friedman followed what is by now a well-trod
pattern with Moore spinning out quotes in Washington while Thomas
"Dusty" Rhodes, president of the conservative National Review, and
television commentator Lawrence Kudlow worked conservative circles in
New York.</TE>
<TE>   Kudlow devoted much of CNBC-TV's "Kudlow &amp; Cramer" show Monday
night, as well as an online column, to criticism of the New York
investment banker.</TE>
<TE>   By Tuesday morning, National Review's Web site carried a banner
reading, "Warning to Bushies: DUMP Friedman! He's no tax cutter." The
Wall Street Journal editorialized that it hopes "someone has vetted
his policy convictions," given his role with the Concord group."</TE>
<TE>   Administration officials, who appeared caught off-guard by the
vehemence of the objections, responded testily.</TE>
<TE>   One official, who spoke only on condition of anonymity, described
Moore as "a cable TV gadfly, and not a serious force affecting this
administration's deliberations." White House spokeswoman Claire
Buchan could not say when a replacement for Lindsey would be named.</TE>
<TE>   Friedman appeared to have the job of heading the NEC locked up
over the weekend when he was being described as a "Republican Bob
Rubin," a reference to the Clinton administration's widely respected
Treasury secretary.</TE>
<TE>   Friedman and Rubin jointly ran Goldman Sachs from 1990 to 1992.</TE>
<TE>   Though Friedman has given generously -- and almost exclusively --
to Republican candidates, activists excoriated his contribution of
$500 to Hillary Rodham Clinton's successful 2000 Senate campaign and
another $500 to an abortion rights group.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, White House officials said privately Friedman was
having trouble unwinding his complex personal finances in order to
take public office, and there were reports that he is suffering from
unspecified medical problems. Friedman has not commented.</TE>
<TE>   The administration is widely reported to be readying another $300
billion of tax cuts -- that would come atop its already passed
$1.35-trillion tax package -- aimed at rekindling growth and
shrinking the size of government.</TE>
<TE>   The administration proposal is certain to face substantial
opposition from Democrats and deficit-hawk Republicans like Sens.
Pete Domenici of New Mexico and Charles Grassley of Iowa, the
incoming chairman of the Senate Finance Committee.</TE>
<TE>   It is also likely to be criticized by most mainstream economists
who fear that Washington's swing from multi-hundred-billion-dollar
surpluses to similar-sized deficits will damage an already weak
economy by driving up interest rates and dampening what growth there
is.</TE>
<TE>   Conservatives worry that once in the NEC job, Friedman would not
work to sell the new cuts to Congress and the public, but instead
follow in the footsteps of ousted Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill
and raise doubts about the tax package.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a man who gives the impression that he does not believe
in what the president is doing," said prominent conservative
economist Richard W. Rahn.</TE>
<TE>   "The president is on the side of growth, but I'm not sure
(Friedman) is," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Moore, asked whether conservatives risk widening the divide
between deficit hawks and  supply-side Republicans by fighting
Friedman's appointment, quipped, "It might have a decade ago, but now

<HD>Prominent Dove Pushed Out of Israeli Parliament</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM</DL>
<LD>Choosing its candidates for parliament, Israel's moderate Labor Party
on Tuesday pushed out its most prominent dove, Yossi Beilin, and
topped its list with several former generals.</LD>
<LD>   Beilin, a political maverick, was an architect of the 1993 Oslo
peace accords with the Palestinians and was the first to advocate
Israel's unilateral withdrawal from Lebanon years before it pulled
out in May 2000.</LD>
<LD>   Other prominent Labor liberals won spots on the party list that
appeared to assure their election. Beilin's ouster was attributed to
his bitter feud with the previous Labor leader, Binyamin Ben-Eliezer,
who kept Labor in a coalition with Prime Minister Ariel Sharon's
hard-line Likud Party for 20 months.</LD>
<TE>   Under its new leader, Amram Mitzna, Labor is advocating an Israeli
withdrawal from much of the West Bank and all of the Gaza Strip,
either as part of a peace deal or as a unilateral step if
negotiations fail.</TE>
<TE>   However, Israel's electorate has been moving to the right after
more than two years of fighting with the Palestinians, and polls show
Labor finishing a distant second to Likud in the Jan. 28 general
election.</TE>
<TE>   Labor faces the prospect of losing about six of its 26 seats in
the 120-member parliament, and the fight was fierce for the top 20
spots on the party list. Beilin came in 39th. The first three spots
were reserved for Mitzna, Ben-Eliezer and outgoing Foreign Minister
Shimon Peres.</TE>

<LD>More than 400 teachers, farmers and ranchers protesting NAFTA and low

horses into the lobby and breaking down doors to occupy the chamber.</LD>
<LD>   Protesters used iron bars to force open a fence that rings the
legislative palace in Mexico City. They then hurled fire
extinguishers at security guards as lawmakers dived under desks.</LD>

<LD>Iran's Islamic establishment may face the same fate as the country's

<LD>   Mohammad Reza Khatami, head of the Islamic Iran Participation
Front, said students will "break from the establishment" if they feel
they're being ignored.</LD>
<LD>   "The main reason for the fall of the former regime was its
resistance against student calls for freedom and justice," the
official IRNA news agency quoted Khatami, the president's younger
brother, as saying.</LD>

<HD>Carter Receives Nobel Peace Prize</HD>
<DH>In veiled criticism of Bush, he denounces war as policy and
urges support for U.N.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>OSLO</DL>
<LD>Saying that war is always evil, former President Carter received the
Nobel Peace Prize on Tuesday and urged the world to accept U.N.
leadership in tackling challenges ranging from the Middle East to
global poverty.</LD>
<LD>   Carter, calling himself a "citizen of a troubled world," also made
veiled criticisms of President Bush for opposing U.N.-led programs to
protect the environment and create an international criminal court.</LD>
<LD>   "Global challenges must be met with an emphasis on peace, in
harmony with others, with strong alliances and international
consensus," Carter told a ceremony in Oslo City Hall after collecting
a Nobel gold medal and diploma to a standing ovation.</LD>
<TE>   "Imperfect as it may be, there is no doubt that this can best be
done through the United Nations," said the 78-year-old Democrat, who
was president from 1977 to 1981. The United Nations and its
secretary-general, Kofi Annan, won the 2001 prize.</TE>
<TE>   "War may sometimes be a necessary evil," Carter told an audience
of about 1,000 people, including his wife, Rosalynn, and Norway's
King Harald V and Queen Sonja. "But no matter how necessary, it is
always an evil, never a good. We will not learn how to live together
in peace by killing each other's children."</TE>
<TE>   Although he did not mention Bush by name, Carter cautioned against
the use of war as a tool of policy.</TE>
<TE>   "For powerful countries to adopt a principle of preventative war
may well set an example that can have catastrophic consequences," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   In his antiwar appeal, Carter cited the 1950 Nobel peace laureate,
Ralph J. Bunche, also an American.</TE>
<TE>   "To suggest that war can prevent war is a base play on words and a
despicable form of warmongering. The objective of any who sincerely
believe in peace clearly must be to exhaust every honorable recourse
in the effort to save the peace," he said, citing Bunche's Nobel
lecture. "The world has had ample evidence that war begets only
conditions which beget further war."</TE>
<TE>   The peace prize committee said it gave Carter the award for his
"vital contribution" in brokering the 1978 Camp David peace accords
between Israel and Egypt; for his emphasis on human rights in
international politics; and for the work of the Carter Center, the
Atlanta-based think tank and advocacy center he founded after leaving
public office following his election loss to Ronald Reagan.</TE>
<TE>   He will receive a check for $1.1 million that he will use for
peace work at his center.</TE>

<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>BAGHDAD</DL>
<LD>Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, facing a possible U.S.-led war over
alleged weapons of mass destruction, said Tuesday that Iraq's enemies
would be defeated.</LD>
<LD>   "Your heads will be held aloft in dignity and, God willing, your
enemy will be defeated and humiliated," Hussein told senior ministers
and high-ranking military officers, Iraq's state television reported.</LD>
<LD>   The comments came as five teams of arms inspectors fanned out
across Iraq to search for suspected weapons of mass destruction under
a U.N. Security Council resolution giving Iraq a last chance to
disarm or face a possible war.</LD>
<TE>   Iraq says all such weapons programs have been stopped.</TE>

<HD>Chief Inspector to Hand Over Edited Report by Monday</HD>
<DH>Entire U.N. council will receive copies after weapons
manufacturing details are deleted.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Maggie Farley</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>UNITED NATIONS</DL>
<LD>The chief U.N. arms inspector said Tuesday that he would present the
Security Council with Iraq's mammoth weapons declaration by Monday
after editing out manufacturing information and the names of foreign
suppliers.</LD>
<LD>   Hans Blix said that an initial examination of the presentation
showed it contained mostly recycled information but that there may be
"something new" in the chemical and nuclear sections. He promised a
fuller assessment by Tuesday. During a luncheon with U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan and Security Council ambassadors, Blix
also assured diplomats that he, not the U.S., was in control of the
report's analysis and distribution after a controversial release of
the Iraqi declaration to Washington on Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   The Security Council decided Friday to allow Blix to vet the
declaration before releasing it to the council's 15 members over the
weekend, but U.S. officials arranged for the five permanent members
to obtain the uncut copies immediately. They argued that the U.S.,
France, Britain, Russia and China are already nuclear powers and thus
would not learn anything about building such weapons from the report.</LD>
<TE>   In a last-minute decision late Sunday and with the approval of the
Security Council's president, the U.S. took the council's sole copy
to Washington to reproduce it and begin analyzing its 11,807 pages,
saying the U.S. had the fastest and most secure reproduction
facilities. The U.S. gave copies to the other four permanent members
Monday night and Tuesday morning. It returned the original to Blix's
office Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   While the permanent members were happy to gain access to the full
report days earlier than expected, the U.S. move angered others on
the council. Several of the 10 council members who hold two-year
rotating seats protested the unequal distribution and on Tuesday
pushed to have access to the original version, if not their own
copies.</TE>
<TE>   Syria's ambassador, Mikhail Wehbe, demanded that all members
receive the full declaration. But other diplomats said privately that
concerns about passing on weapons know-how to countries such as Syria
that don't have it led to the two-tier distribution.</TE>
<TE>   Norway, Ireland, Singapore and Mexico said at the luncheon that
none of the excised information should be a basis for declaring a
"material breach" because they could not judge its veracity without
seeing it. Norwegian Ambassador Ole Peter Kolby said that all members
should have the same access to the information and that the entire
council, not just the U.S., must make any decision about Iraq's
compliance. Russian Ambassador Sergei V. Lavrov proposed that all
members have access to the full document -- though not copies -- so
they could make the necessary judgments.</TE>
<TE>   Iraq accused the U.S. of "unprecedented blackmail" in obtaining
the declaration. "America aims to manipulate the U.N. documents to
find a cover for aggression against Iraq," Foreign Minister Naji
Sabri said Tuesday. "It violated the authority of the 10 nonpermanent
members, who represent the U.N. member states and who, according to
the U.N. Charter, are supposed to enjoy the same rights and duties
enjoyed by the council's permanent members."</TE>
<TE>   That the statement echoed the arguments of some Security Council
members may foreshadow problems for the council's long-sought unity
on Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   "When Iraq and a third of the Security Council are saying the same
thing, we're in trouble," said one council diplomat. "Iraq would like
nothing better than to see us divided again."</TE>
<TE>   Blix also said the identities of the foreign companies that have
supplied Iraq with material that could be used to make weapons should
remain confidential -- not because he wanted to shield firms guilty
of skirting U.N. sanctions or U.S. export controls but because the
companies are a valuable source of intelligence. He added that there
was no guarantee that the firms knew the material they were selling
was going to Iraq or being used for military purposes.</TE>
<TE>   "Supplier information was certainly useful for UNSCOM [the
previous inspection regime] in the past," said Ewen Buchanan of the
U.N. Monitoring, Verification and Inspection Commission, or UNMOVIC.</TE>
<TE>   "It was quite nice for us to be able to go to a company and say,
'Did you sell them this equipment; who did you deal with; where did
you ship them to?' It was one way of finding out Iraq's front
companies and middlemen," he said. "If we put their name on the front
page of the Los Angeles Times, would they speak to us again? And if
equipment was sold to a middleman and ended up in Iraq, should they
be blamed for that?"</TE>
<TE>   Blix also sought to rebut criticism from Washington that the
inspection team isn't large or aggressive enough to ferret out hidden
weapons in Iraq. Additional inspectors arrived in Iraq over the
weekend, bringing the number to 70. At least 30 more will arrive by
the end of the month, and UNMOVIC moved its January training session
up a week to prepare more experts -- especially from the U.S. -- to
bolster the team. About 300 inspectors will ultimately be working in
Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   With the additional help, inspectors in Iraq conducted the most
comprehensive searches so far Tuesday, covering seven sites. Germ
warfare experts visited the National Project for Controlling
Brucellosis and Tuberculosis and the Saddam Center for Biotechnology.</TE>
<TE>   A team of nuclear experts continued to inventory materials at Al
Tuwaitha. Another team investigated an outlying site of the Al Qa Qaa
explosives plant, as well as the Al Furat State Company for Chemical
Industries in Musayyib and a complex of sites belonging to the Karama
facility. One more team traveled to the Qaim phosphate complex.</TE>

<HD>Still Courting Turkey, Bush Meets With a Top Politician</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Paul Richter</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Intensifying his campaign to win Turkey's military support for a
possible war on Iraq, President Bush on Tuesday received the leader
of Turkey's new ruling party at the White House and declared he is
committed to gaining the NATO ally's entry into the European Union.</LD>
<LD>   Before a meeting with Recep Tayyip Erdogan, chairman of the
Justice and Development Party, Bush told reporters that he stands
"side by side" with Turkey as it seeks membership in the European
Union.</LD>
<LD>   "My administration is working hard on Turkey's behalf," he said.</LD>
<TE>   Bush and aides declined to say whether Erdogan had agreed in
private talks to U.S. requests to allow American troops and planes to
use Turkey as a staging area for an invasion of northern Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   Turkish officials have said they will provide military assistance
if the United Nations finds that Iraq has not complied with orders to
disarm. But, with strong resistance among the Turkish public to a new
war, Turkish officials have not committed to providing the help that
U.S. officials believe would be essential to carrying out the U.S.
war plan.</TE>
<TE>   White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer called Tuesday's meeting
"positive" and said the leaders had discussed "ways we can
cooperate." But he declined to provide details.</TE>
<TE>   The joint appearance was a calculated effort to pressure European
Union officials, who are expected to decide at a Copenhagen summit
Thursday and Friday whether to set a date for negotiations on
Turkey's application to join the union.</TE>
<TE>   Some EU members have been resisting American pressure. At a
meeting in Brussels, a majority of EU foreign ministers cast their
support behind a German-French plan that would permit talks to begin
in 2005 if Turkey passed a human rights review in 2004. Turkey has
rejected this plan, arguing, with U.S. support, that talks should
start next year.</TE>
<TE>   Although the foreign ministers could still be overruled in
Copenhagen by the European heads of state, their views suggested
broad support for the proposal by Europe's two biggest countries.</TE>
<TE>   Erdogan signaled that he wants as much U.S. help as he can get. He
welcomed Bush's support and said he hopes the president will make
more calls to European leaders on his country's behalf.</TE>
<TE>   "We are aware of your support on this matter and are very
appreciative of it. But it shouldn't end here. We expect it will
continue," Erdogan said.</TE>
<TE>   Erdogan's party has Islamist roots, but he and other officials
have been trying to convince U.S. and European officials that they
intend to remain firmly within Turkey's secular tradition.</TE>
<TE>   Turkey has been pushing for entry into the European Union for
years. Advocates contend that by integrating a Muslim nation of 66
million into the West, Europe would build a bridge to the Islamic
world and offer a model of democratic and free market values to the
rest of the Middle East.</TE>
<TE>   But some European nations, already struggling with the cost of
integrating the poorer nations of Eastern Europe, contend that Turkey
is still too poor and too undemocratic to be smoothly absorbed.</TE>
<TE>   One key to the EU's decision on accession talks is whether Turkey
is willing to use its influence to help settle the long-running
dispute between Greeks and Turks on the island of Cyprus. United
Nations officials are now pushing a peace plan to settle the dispute
that could pave the way for Cyprus to join the EU.</TE>
<TE>   Two Americans who spoke to Erdogan during his trip said they
believed he was not yet ready to commit to giving the United States
all the military assistance it has requested.</TE>
<TE>   These Americans, who asked to remain unidentified, noted that
Erdogan's party is only now getting organized after winning elections
Nov. 3.</TE>
<TE>   They pointed to the strong public opposition in Turkey to a war,
noting that a recent Pew Research poll showed that 83% of Turks
opposed allowing the U.S. to use their country's military bases to
strike Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   Bulent Aliriza, a specialist on Turkey at the Center for Strategic
and International Studies in Washington, said he did not believe that
the United States and Turkey intended to strike a deal on military
assistance during this visit.</TE>
<TE>   "This trip was to set the stage for a guy who's going to be there
for a long time," he said, noting that Erdogan could become the
Turkish prime minister in several months.</TE>
<TE>   He said it was good for U.S. public relations in the Islamic world
for Bush to appear with the leader of a party with Islamist roots.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, Aliriza acknowledged that there are risks
involved with U.S. efforts to pressure the Europeans.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a danger that it could backfire," he said.</TE>

<LD>In the first decision of its kind in any country, Australia's highest
court Tuesday allowed a businessman to sue for defamation in
Australia over an article published in the U.S. and posted on the

<LD>   The court ruled that Dow Jones &amp; Co., publisher of the Wall Street

most countries, Australia offers fewer free-speech protections than
does the U.S. Constitution.</LD>

Dow Jones, arguing that publishers could be subject to an impossible

<HD>58 Priests Ask Boston Cardinal to Step Down in Abuse
Scandal</HD>
<DH>Their letter to Law says the clergy, people 'have lost
confidence' in him as a spiritual leader.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Elizabeth Mehren</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>BOSTON</DL>
<LD>In a display of defiance, 58 priests from the Boston Archdiocese have
sent a letter to Cardinal Bernard Law, demanding that he resign.</LD>
<LD>   "While this is obviously a difficult request, we believe in our
hearts that this is a necessary step that must be taken if healing is
to come to the archdiocese," the letter stated. "The priests and
people of Boston have lost confidence in you as their spiritual
leader."</LD>
<LD>   The three-paragraph letter was hand-delivered late Monday to Law's
mansion in Brighton, where the nation's fourth-largest archdiocese
has its headquarters. Law is in Rome, holding meetings at the Vatican
about the clerical sexual abuse crisis roiling the church in Boston
and around the country.</LD>
<TE>   Archdiocese spokeswoman Donna M. Morrissey said Tuesday that she
could not say whether Law had read the letter, but added that "a
letter between brother priests and their bishop would be reviewed
carefully."</TE>
<TE>   Stephen Pope, chair of the theology department at Boston College,
called the priests' letter "as close to rebellion as you can get."</TE>
<TE>   "This is something they never do," he added. "Even for one priest
to speak up against a bishop is unheard of, but to have so many."</TE>
<TE>   A statement from the Vatican press office said the purpose of
Law's visit was "to inform the Holy See about various aspects of the
situation."</TE>
<TE>   Morrissey refused to discuss the substance of the meetings, which
continued Tuesday, and said she did not know when Law would return.
When Law made a similar unannounced visit to Rome in April, his offer
to resign was rebuffed.</TE>
<TE>   The intensity of the nearly yearlong clerical abuse crisis
escalated in Boston in the last week as a flood of once-confidential
church documents described abuses by priests ranging from rape to
drug use to fathering children with married women.</TE>
<TE>   Files released late Monday contained a notation that one priest,
Father William Scanlan, "fools around with kids." Scanlan was accused
of raping a 12-year-old girl in his parish in 1997, but no criminal
charges were filed. He was most recently assigned to work in San
Jose, but his current whereabouts are unknown.</TE>
<TE>   Public outrage also mounted as financial advisors authorized the
archdiocese to file for bankruptcy rather than settle close to 500
lawsuits brought by sexual abuse victims.</TE>
<TE>   That development, combined with the other problems, prompted
almost 10% of Boston's active-duty priests to take the bold step of
calling for their cardinal to step down.</TE>
<TE>   Although some priests have privately expressed disappointment with
Law for transferring pedophile priests from parish to parish, the
letter marked the first formal call for his resignation from priests
who serve under him.</TE>
<TE>   "It was not an easy thing to do, unprecedented in American
Catholicism," said Father Robert Bullock of Sharon, south of Boston.
"But this crisis is unprecedented."</TE>
<TE>   Bullock, a member of the leadership council of an emergent group
called the Boston Priests' Forum, said the prospect of bankruptcy was
"a disgrace, almost blasphemous because it so contradicts our
theology. We believe the church is Christ, and the church is the
people. To say the church is bankrupt is outrageous. That is like
saying that Christ and the people are bankrupt."</TE>
<TE>   The 250-member Boston Priests' Forum will meet Friday to discuss
asking Law to resign, Bullock said.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, Boston-area members of Voice of the Faithful -- a new
group that advocates increased participation by Catholic laity in
church matters -- will vote today on whether to ask Law to give up
his post.</TE>
<TE>   In another development, a lawyer for retired priest Paul Shanley
contacted Middlesex County Dist. Atty. Martha Coakley to say his
client will post bail of $300,000. Attorney Frank Mondano "said it
will happen, probably this week," Coakley spokesman Seth Horowitz
said.</TE>
<TE>   Shanley, who has been held since May on 10 counts of child rape,
is scheduled to appear in court today for procedural motions.</TE>
<TE>   The 71-year-old priest has been a key figure in the church crisis
since documents released last spring described his relationships with
boys in church education classes as well as his endorsement of
"man-boy love."</TE>
<TE>   Mondano did not return a call to his office Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   If Shanley does post bail, he would be released from jail
immediately, Horowitz said. However, Shanley would be required to
surrender his passport and would be barred from unsupervised visits
with children under 16, Horowitz said,</TE>
<TE>   Shanley's trial date is pending.</TE>
<TE>   The sexual abuse scandal also gripped New Hampshire's only
archdiocese, where the bishop announced a settlement Tuesday with
state law enforcement officials.</TE>
<TE>   Bishop John B. McCormack, a former top aide to Law whose name
appears on many of the documents released in Boston in the last week,
admitted that the diocese of Manchester probably would have been
convicted of failing to protect children from sexually abusive
priests.</TE>
<TE>   "The church in New Hampshire fully acknowledges and accepts
responsibility for failures in our system that contributed to the
endangerment of children," McCormack said at a news conference.</TE>
<TE>   In averting criminal prosecution following an investigation that
began in February, New Hampshire Atty. Gen. Philip McLaughlin said
the Manchester diocese agreed to allow state prosecutors to audit its
handling of sexual abuse cases over the next five years.</TE>
<TE>   McLaughlin said his inquiry confirmed reports of molestation
involving more than 40 priests. The attorney general praised the
mostly male victims -- now in their 40s and 50s -- for discussing the
"abject humiliation" of being molested by major figures of authority.</TE>
<TE>   "While they suffered grievously as children -- and I suspect many
suffered grievously as adults -- their willingness to assist us here
will protect children," McLaughlin said. "This is a gift they gave
us."</TE>

<HD>$700,000 Sought From Bush 2000 Campaign</HD>
<DH>Auditors for FEC recommend repayment. They also question
more than $400,000 spent on Gore's effort during the election.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Federal Election Commission auditors recommended Tuesday that
President Bush's campaign repay the government more than $700,000 in
public financing it received for the 2000 election.</LD>
<LD>   Auditors also finished reviewing former Vice President Al Gore's
2000 primary and general election campaign committees.</LD>
<LD>   They are questioning $426,836 in Gore's primary campaign funding
and $14,887 in spending by his general election campaign. Gore's
campaign has already repaid some of the money: Auditors say the
primary campaign still owes the U.S. Treasury $372,245 and the
general election campaign owes $3,262.</LD>
<TE>   The commission was to consider auditors' recommendations today.</TE>
<TE>   Gore's primary and general election campaign funds were audited
because both received federal money; Bush accepted public financing
only for his general election campaign, so only that fund was
audited.</TE>
<TE>   FEC auditors raised questions about $1 million from Bush's
campaign -- about $250,000 of which involved interest payments earned
by the campaign on the taxpayer money it received. The Bush campaign
has already repaid $296,119 to cover the interest and a small amount
of stale-dated checks that were never cashed by vendors.</TE>
<TE>   Auditors say the campaign still owes the Treasury $723,176 in
public funds it received, including:</TE>
<TE>   * $498,658 for phone banks operated by several state party
committees to get out the vote for Bush and other Republicans.
Auditors say Bush was the only candidate identified by name in the
phone calls made within a week of the election, and the parties used
paid professionals to conduct the calls, so at least half of the
phone campaigns' cost should be treated as in-kind contributions to
the Bush campaign.</TE>
<TE>   * $95,509 for campaign-related flights on corporate planes.</TE>
<TE>   * $129,009 in spending that exceeded the limit for candidates
receiving public financing.</TE>
<TE>   Bush campaign attorney Ben Ginsberg said the campaign was
challenging several audit findings, including the phone bank costs.</TE>
<TE>   The auditors recommended that taxpayers pay $382,996 to reimburse
the Bush recount fund -- the account set up by Bush to pay for the
campaign recount expenses using private donations -- for some staff
salaries and overhead it covered. Those expenses were unrelated to
the recount effort, the auditors said, so they should be treated as
postelection winding-down costs covered by the campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Bush attorneys disagreed, writing to the commission, "The
Bush-Cheney Recount Fund does not want the taxpayers' money."</TE>
<TE>   The money questioned in the audit of Gore's primary campaign
included $424,351 in leftover public campaign funds and $2,485 for
bill payments or refund checks the recipients didn't cash.</TE>
<TE>   The amount questioned in the audit of Gore's general election
campaign include $14,887 for interest the campaign fund earned and
for checks it sent that were never cashed.</TE>

<HD>New York Mayor Unveils Plan for More Affordable Housing</HD>
<DH>Bloomberg says the city would seek $3 billion to buy and
preserve homes.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg, who earlier this year vowed to improve
the city's crumbling public schools, set his sights Tuesday on
another perennial Big Apple headache -- affordable housing.</LD>
<LD>   The businessman-turned-mayor announced at a gathering of housing
developers, owners and managers that over the next five years, New
York City would seek more than $3 billion to purchase 27,000 new
homes and preserve 38,000 others.</LD>
<LD>   Bloomberg said in a luncheon speech to the New York Housing
Conference that new and existing money will preserve or create 65,000
units in all five boroughs of the city by 2008.</LD>
<TE>   Housing activists and advocates for the city's rapidly increasing
number of homeless families praised Bloomberg for tackling the issue
despite tough economic times and New York's $6.4-billion budget
deficit.</TE>
<TE>   "In context of the terrible budget environment and of the recent
past, for the mayor to stand up and say public investment in housing
is critical and we understand that there is a big affordability gap
is very significant," said Joe Weisbord of the Housing First
coalition. "We have an enormous housing problem in this city, and
this is a major first step."</TE>
<TE>   Republican Bloomberg took office in January, succeeding Rudolph W.
Giuliani, who critics say gutted many public services and did not
have a viable housing policy.</TE>
<TE>   A homeless advocacy group, the Coalition for the Homeless, said in
mid-November that New York was suffering the worst homeless crisis in
its history. It said that more than 37,300 people were spending the
night in city-run shelters, including 9,000 families and more than
16,000 children.</TE>
<TE>   "The city hasn't had a real affordable housing policy for more
than a decade, and I think this is a terrific step toward it," said
City Council member David Yassky, a Democrat.</TE>
<TE>   According to the U.S. Census Bureau, the average median household
income in New York City is $38,000. With that income, analysts say, a
family can afford to spend up to $800 in monthly rent. But the
average rent for an apartment in Manhattan is about $2,700, housing
analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   Bloomberg, founder of the news and information company Bloomberg
LP, needs approval from the City Council to carry out the plan, which
will cost hundreds of millions of dollars in public funding and
private investment. Some development would depend on rezoning
underused waterfront areas and reclaiming contaminated former
industrial sites.</TE>

<HD>Consumer Magazine Test Finds Harmful Bacteria in Chickens</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>A consumer magazine says it found harmful bacteria, much of it
drug-resistant, in almost half the chickens it bought from stores
nationwide.</LD>
<LD>   The bacterium campylobacter, which can cause food poisoning, was
found in 42% of 484 fresh broiler chickens tested for a survey in the
January issue of Consumer Reports. The magazine said Tuesday that 12%
of the chickens had salmonella, another bacterium. Both bugs can
cause diarrhea, fever, abdominal pain and even death.</LD>
<LD>   The report said people sickened by the bacteria would stay sick
longer, and treatment would be more difficult for doctors, because
90% of the campylobacter samples and 34% of the salmonella resisted
treatment by commonly used antibiotics such as tetracycline.</LD>
<TE>   "That's a very uncomfortable starting point, and it goes to
reinforce the growing concern about the use of antibiotics in
livestock production," said David Pittle, vice president for
technical policy at the magazine's publisher, Consumers Union.</TE>

<HD>Appeals Court Overturns Decision Striking Down U.S. Death
Penalty</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>David G. Savage</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The federal death penalty is constitutional despite the "theoretical
possibility" that an innocent person might be put to death, a U.S.
appeals court in New York ruled Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   The 3-0 decision overturns a July ruling by a federal trial judge
who struck down the penalty because of the "unacceptably high risk"
that mistakes will be made.</LD>
<LD>   The ruling clears the way for the Justice Department to press for
death sentences in a handful of federal cases.</LD>
<TE>   Congress revived the federal death penalty in 1994. Since then, 31
people have been sentenced to die on federal charges, and two have
been executed: Oklahoma City bomber Timothy J. McVeigh and Texas drug
kingpin Juan Garza, who ordered several murders.</TE>
<TE>   Tuesday's decision also brushes aside what some death penalty foes
saw as a promising new line of attack on capital punishment.</TE>
<TE>   More than 100 inmates who were condemned to die by the states
since 1976 have had their sentences reversed, and a smaller, but
significant number of them have been shown to be innocent of the
crime that sent them to death row.</TE>
<TE>   This error rate has shaken the confidence of some officials, and
U.S. District Judge Jed Rakoff said it was reason enough to outlaw
death sentences.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no reason to believe the federal system will be any more
successful at avoiding mistaken impositions of the death penalty than
error-prone state systems," he wrote. The continued use of the death
penalty "is tantamount to foreseeable state-sponsored murder of
innocent human beings."</TE>
<TE>   The judge did not suggest the two defendants before him were
innocent. The pair -- Alan Quinones and Diego Rodriguez -- were
charged with being heroin distributors who tortured and murdered an
informant.</TE>
<TE>   Rakoff struck down the death penalty in a pretrial motion. But the
U.S. 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals said his position had been
repeatedly rejected by the Supreme Court.</TE>
<TE>   "The argument that innocent people may be executed -- in small or
large numbers -- is not new; it has been central to the centuries-old
debate over both the wisdom and constitutionality of capital
punishment," wrote Judge Jose Cabranes. If the death penalty itself
is to be rejected as unconstitutional, "that is a change that only
the Supreme Court is authorized to make," he said.</TE>
<TE>   All nine justices of the Supreme Court say capital punishment is
constitutional.</TE>
<TE>   By its very words, the Constitution permits the practice, they
say. The 5th Amendment says, "No person shall be held to answer for a
capital or otherwise infamous crime" unless indicted by a grand jury,
nor shall anyone be "deprived of life, liberty or property without
due process of law."</TE>
<TE>   University of Michigan law professor Samuel Gross, who argued the
New York case, said he remained hopeful the high court will
reconsider the issue.</TE>
<TE>   "Thanks to DNA, it is a new world. We have learned we regularly
sentence to death people who are innocent," Gross said. "We hope the
court will take up that challenge."</TE>
<TE>   But Kent Scheidegger, legal director of the Criminal Justice Legal
Foundation in Sacramento, praised the appeals court for rejecting the
ruling.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a well-deserved rebuke of a crackpot decision," he said.</TE>

<HD>Panel Proposes Reforms to Try to Prevent Terrorist Attacks</HD>
<DH>Report is met with skepticism. One senator says it is too
lenient on intelligence agencies.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Greg Miller</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Wrapping up a lengthy investigation of Sept. 11 intelligence
failures, lawmakers Tuesday endorsed a list of reforms designed to
shore up the government's abilities to prevent future attacks.</LD>
<LD>   But the proposals were greeted with skepticism from experts and
criticism from at least one key senator on the panel for being too
soft on the CIA and other intelligence agencies.</LD>
<LD>   As expected, the report calls for the creation of a new
Cabinet-level position to oversee the nation's intelligence
community, and prods the CIA and FBI to fix an assortment of problems
-- including the failure to share information -- that may have
contributed to the success of the Sept. 11 plot.</LD>
<TE>   But the members of the Senate and House intelligence committees,
meeting jointly, could not agree on a range of crucial issues,
including the continued role of the FBI in gathering intelligence on
terrorist suspects in the United States.</TE>
<TE>   And the report stops short of holding any public officials
accountable for intelligence breakdowns.</TE>
<TE>   The tone of the report surprised some experts, who said they had
expected more aggressive measures from a panel that has been harshly
critical of the performance of the CIA and other agencies during
high-profile public hearings this year.</TE>
<TE>   "It's largely cosmetic reform," said Loch K. Johnson, a professor
at the University of Georgia and a senior aide on landmark
congressional investigations of the intelligence community in the
1970s and 1990s. "To have a Cabinet member and give him a fancy title
is really not going to change anything, I don't believe."</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Richard C. Shelby (R-Ala.) of the Senate Intelligence
Committee expressed frustration with the outcome, adding that he and
other lawmakers planned to submit a minority report with dissenting
views.</TE>
<TE>   In particular, Shelby said, he thought committee members should
have been willing to assign blame for specific breakdowns. "There's
been no accountability for people who made terrible decisions,"
Shelby said. "If you do something well, you should be rewarded. If
you do it poorly, that should be pointed out."</TE>
<TE>   Shelby reiterated his long-standing criticism of CIA Director
George J. Tenet, saying, "There have been more failures on his watch
than anybody that I know of in the history of the CIA." Despite his
reservations, Shelby said, he voted in favor of the report.</TE>
<TE>   The list of recommendations, scheduled for public release today,
is the culmination of a 10-month investigation into intelligence
failures that may have contributed to the Sept. 11 attacks. A
comprehensive examination of the findings is expected to be released
later this month or in January.</TE>
<TE>   The probe has been a source of embarrassment to the intelligence
community. During hearings in October, the FBI was sharply criticized
for not acting on warnings from agents in Arizona and Minnesota about
possible terrorists training at U.S. flight schools. The CIA was
chastised for failing to notify the FBI or immigration authorities
that operatives linked to Osama bin Laden's Al Qaeda terrorist
network had entered this country.</TE>
<TE>   The committee's central recommendation calls for the creation of a
director of national intelligence, a Cabinet-level position that
would oversee the budgets and personnel of all 13 intelligence
agencies. While Tenet's title is director of central intelligence, he
has no authority over military intelligence.</TE>
<TE>   The aim of that recommendation is to force better cooperation
among the scattered components of the intelligence community,
lawmakers said. "We think there needs to be major bold structural
change," said Rep. Jane Harman (D-Venice).</TE>
<TE>   But the idea of creating an intelligence czar has been kicking
around Washington for more than a decade. It has repeatedly foundered
amid opposition from the Pentagon, which controls the bulk of the
nation's intelligence budget and has successfully resisted
encroachment on that turf.</TE>
<TE>   The report also calls on Congress to continue exploring the
creation of a domestic intelligence service -- a proposal that
reflects deep dissatisfaction with the FBI's performance in tracking
terrorists in the United States.</TE>
<TE>   Some on the joint committee favored the creation of such an
agency, an idea that White House officials have been exploring in
recent months. But aides said key lawmakers, including Rep. Nancy
Pelosi of San Francisco, the ranking Democrat on the House
Intelligence Committee, objected, citing concern that any such agency
might trample civil liberties.</TE>
<TE>   Other recommendations call for new structures and systems for
sharing information among intelligence agencies, and stepped-up
efforts to recruit spies and improve technologies aimed at
penetrating terrorist groups.</TE>
<TE>   Some experts were skeptical that the committee's work would lead
to swift reform.</TE>
<TE>   Several key lawmakers are scheduled to leave intelligence
committee assignments when the new Congress begins next month. And
President Bush recently signed legislation creating a blue-ribbon
commission, headed by former Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger,
to conduct another probe of Sept. 11 failures.</TE>
<TE>   "That helps provide a pretext for inaction" because many in
Congress will want to wait to see what the Kissinger commission
finds, said Steven Aftergood, an intelligence analyst at the
Federation of American Scientists.</TE>

<HD>Outrage Grows Over Lott Remarks</HD>
<DH>Black lawmakers reject GOP Senate chief's apology. NAACP
urges resignation from his leadership post. Bush stands by colleague.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Nick Anderson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Rejecting his apology as insufficient, black congressional Democrats
and others sharply rebuked Sen. Trent Lott (R-Miss.) on Tuesday for
remarks he made last week praising Sen. Strom Thurmond's run for
president in 1948.</LD>
<LD>   Thurmond's candidacy as a Dixiecrat explicitly endorsed racial
segregation -- a position he later passionately defended as a U.S.
senator from South Carolina, most memorably when he filibustered in
1957 for more than 24 hours against a civil rights bill.</LD>
<LD>   Thurmond eventually relented in his opposition to integration, and
he now is known for his record as the Senate's oldest and
longest-serving member.</LD>
<TE>   It was at Thurmond's 100th birthday party Thursday that Lott, who
will become Senate majority leader when Congress convenes next month,
noted that the Dixiecrat ticket carried Mississippi in the 1948
election. In words that have sparked a continuing furor, Lott added:
"We're proud of it. And if the rest of the country had followed our
lead, we wouldn't have had all these problems over all these years,
either."</TE>
<TE>   Lott's comments began eliciting criticism during the weekend, and
on Monday, he issued an apology. "A poor choice of words conveyed to
some the impression that I embraced the discarded policies of the
past," Lott said. "Nothing could be further from the truth, and I
apologize for my statement to anyone who was offended by it."</TE>
<TE>   He had no further comment Tuesday and, according to his press
secretary, flew home to Mississippi.</TE>
<TE>   Even so, he continued to take heavy fire from both sides of the
political spectrum. The Wall Street Journal's conservative editorial
page slammed him. So did congressional Democrats, who on Tuesday
issued fresh statements of outrage. Leaders of the Congressional
Black Caucus -- an all-Democratic group -- made clear they did not
consider the matter closed.</TE>
<TE>   "It is extremely upsetting," said Rep. Elijah E. Cummings of
Maryland, the group's incoming chairman. "Those are the kinds of
words that tear this nation apart. And so we're going to do
everything in our power to address it."</TE>
<TE>   The National Assn. for the Advancement of Colored People called on
Lott to resign his leadership position.</TE>
<TE>   President Bush and other leading Republicans stood by Lott.</TE>
<TE>   "From the president's point of view, Sen. Lott has addressed this
issue," said White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer. "The
president has confidence in him, unquestionably."</TE>
<TE>   Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.), who frequently clashes with Lott on
policy, said his colleague had been misunderstood.</TE>
<TE>   "I've known Trent Lott for over 20 years and I know he doesn't
hold any segregationist views, and he clearly did not mean words like
that in that fashion," McCain told CNN on Monday night.</TE>
<TE>   Rep. J.C. Watts Jr. of Oklahoma, who for several years has been
the lone black Republican in Congress, also appeared on television
news shows to defend Lott.</TE>
<TE>   Although it seemed likely that Lott would ride out this
controversy, the continued reaction to his remarks gave GOP leaders
renewed cause for concern about their perennially weak standing among
black voters.</TE>
<TE>   Republicans periodically unveil "minority outreach" programs, but
Democratic presidential candidates routinely carry 80% to 90% of the
black vote, according to exit polls. And with Watts' decision not to
seek reelection, there will be no black Republicans in the next
Congress.</TE>
<TE>   Democrats, meanwhile, engaged in some soul-searching over their
party's response to Lott's comments. Some accused prominent party
leaders of being too quick to accept the Republican's apology.</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Los Angeles) singled out Senate Democratic
leader Tom Daschle of South Dakota for such criticism. Daschle
expressed empathy for Lott's predicament. "There are a lot of times
when he and I go to the microphone and would like to say things we
meant to say differently," Daschle said.</TE>
<TE>   Waters responded: "We need our leadership to come forward and
denounce [Lott's] kinds of statements and activities. Mr. Daschle
moved too quickly to explain Mr. Lott."</TE>
<TE>   Daschle issued a new statement Tuesday on the controversy.
"Regardless of how [Lott] intended his statement to be interpreted,
it was wrong to say it and I strongly disagree with it. His words
were offensive to those who believe in freedom and equality in
America."</TE>
<TE>   Daschle's criticism was echoed by incoming House Minority Leader
Nancy Pelosi (D-San Francisco). In her first comments on the matter,
Pelosi denounced Lott's remarks as "completely inappropriate." She
added: "I don't know if any apology is adequate."</TE>
<TE>   Despite Thurmond's change of approach on racial issues, he remains
for many a symbol of the South's long history of institutionalized
segregation.</TE>
<TE>   He initially won election to the Senate in 1954 as a Democrat. He
switched to the Republican Party in 1964, embracing the presidential
candidacy of Sen. Barry Goldwater (R-Ariz.).</TE>

<HD>From Coast to Coast, a Cry for Peace</HD>
<DH>Human Rights Day is marked with vigils, prayers, teach-ins
and a rally at the U.N. At least 150 antiwar protesters are arrested
nationwide.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>John J. Goldman</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>As part of antiwar protests across the country, hundreds of activists
rallied outside the United Nations on Tuesday, urging President Bush
not to invade Iraq.</LD>
<LD>   Police arrested at least 150 people nationwide for highly
choreographed acts of civil disobedience, including 99 demonstrators
who blocked the entrance to the U.S. Mission to the United Nations.</LD>
<LD>   In cities from coast to coast, groups sponsored candlelight
vigils, marches, teach-ins, food drives and interfaith prayer
services to mark International Human Rights Day.</LD>
<TE>   The goal, organizers explained, was to show the breadth of what
they said is a burgeoning movement against the Bush administration's
threats of war.</TE>
<TE>   Sponsors said the events were intended as a smaller follow-up to
massive demonstrations held in October in Washington and San
Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   At the White House, a spokesman said the demonstrations were a
"time-honored tradition" of democracy.</TE>
<TE>   "We held over 120 events across the country ... to express our
dismay at the prospect of a war," said David Levy, an organizer with
United for Peace, a loose-knit coalition that coordinated the antiwar
activity.</TE>
<TE>   In Anchorage, a memorial celebrated the Universal Declaration of
Human Rights while in Vero Beach, Fla., marchers gathered by
candlelight to press for peace for Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   Protesters also were arrested in Chicago on charges of criminal
trespass in the lobby of a federal office building, in Sacramento on
charges of blocking the entrance to a U.S. courthouse and in
Washington on charges of refusing to leave a military recruiting
station.</TE>
<TE>   "It shows you opposition to the war is not just a marginal opinion
of a few activists," said Jen Carr, a spokeswoman for Peace Action, a
principal member of the coalition that organized the events.</TE>
<TE>   In Washington, activists held a lunch-hour march near the White
House; in the early evening, about 100 people gathered outside the
offices of the Committee for the Liberation of Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   "No war for oil," the picketers chanted, charging that the
committee serves as a front for the pro-war lobby.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the roughly 500 people who gathered in New York sang
protest songs from the Vietnam War era and recalled massive and
sometimes violent rallies during the 1960s and '70s.</TE>
<TE>   "I went to my first demonstration in Washington, D.C., Nov. 15,
1969, and that kind of convinced me to be a peace activist and work
for social justice," said Bill Steyert, who is a retired worker for a
public interest organization.</TE>
<TE>   At the U.S. Mission to the United Nations, protesters and police
engaged in a polite, well-practiced political ballet.</TE>
<TE>   Each person who refused to get up from in front of the building
was photographed and courteously helped by officers into vans for the
trip to court to face disorderly conduct charges of blocking the
doors of the government property.</TE>
<TE>   In Oakland, more than 500 people gathered at the federal building
carrying about 200 small mock coffins bearing images of Iraqi
children.</TE>
<TE>   "Iraqi children are not collateral damage," proclaimed a large
banner held above the coffins. Another banner showed a large oil
tanker with the slogan, "USS War for Oil."</TE>
<TE>   The death theme was repeated in Providence, R.I., where about 100
Brown University students and faculty held a "die-in" at the federal
building.</TE>
<TE>   In Los Angeles, more than 100 entertainers, including Matt Damon,
David Duchovny, Laurence Fishburne, Martin Sheen, Diahann Carroll,
Janeane Garofalo and Samuel L. Jackson, signed a letter to Bush
voicing their opposition to a war.</TE>
<TE>   "War is a reflection of despair, and I refuse to accept
despair....We are called to be peacemakers," said Sheen, who plays a
U.S. president on NBC's "The West Wing."</TE>
<TE>   Sheen appeared at a news conference with a group of other actors.</TE>
<TE>   "We support rigorous U.N. weapons inspections to assure Iraq's
effective disarmament. However, a preemptive military invasion of
Iraq will harm American national interests," the letter said.</TE>
<TE>   "It will make us less, not more, secure."</TE>
<TE>   Later in Los Angeles, a group of perhaps a dozen protesters
exhorted motorists to honk their horns for peace in Hollywood. Many
obliged in the rush-hour darkness.</TE>

<HD>Suspect in Slaying of Priest Pleads Not Guilty</HD>
<DH>Former aide is held without bond. Lawyer will explore his
mental health.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>CLEVELAND</DL>
<LD>A man recently fired from a Franciscan brother training program
pleaded not guilty Tuesday to charges that he fatally shot a Roman
Catholic priest and set fire to a rectory building.</LD>
<LD>   Daniel Montgomery, 37, was ordered held without bond on charges of
aggravated murder and aggravated arson in the slaying of the Rev.
William Gulas.</LD>
<LD>   Gulas' body was found Saturday in the burning rectory at St.
Stanislaus Church in the city's Slavic Village neighborhood. The
coroner said the 68-year-old priest had been shot in the chest and
hit in the head.</LD>
<TE>   Defense attorney Henry Hilow said Tuesday that he had not met with
his client but planned to explore Montgomery's mental health.</TE>
<TE>   "Here is an individual with no history of violence and very much
of a pacifist," Hilow said. "We have to look at what are the reasons
that could explain the behavior he is accused of."</TE>
<TE>   According to a police report, Montgomery called 911 Saturday to
report the fire, saying he had tried to fight the flames with an
extinguisher. Fire Chief Kevin Gerrity would not say whether
investigators found a used extinguisher, but said the fire was set
with "available combustibles" -- matches or other material at hand.</TE>
<TE>   Montgomery was arrested Monday. His mother, who spoke to him by
phone the day after the fire, said he seemed mentally ill.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know. Did he suddenly develop another personality?"
Janice Montgomery said in an interview Tuesday. She said her son had
attended Catholic schools, earned a master's degree in social work
and had never before shown signs of mental illness.</TE>
<TE>   "It's just so overwhelming -- we never had any indication of
this," she said. "He's always helped the poor and underprivileged."</TE>
<TE>   Montgomery was in his seventh year of training, according to the
Rev. Thomas Luczak, provincial leader of the Franciscan order.</TE>
<TE>   Luczak would not specify why Montgomery was fired, but said it was
clear he was unsuited to be a Franciscan. As a brother, he might have
taught or worked in church offices but would not have celebrated Mass
or heard confessions.</TE>
<TE>   Gulas reported on Montgomery's performance but did not make the
decision to oust him, Luczak said.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>MESA, Ariz.</DL>
<LD>A man was arrested Tuesday in the shooting deaths of his wife and
four members of her family, including her 3-year-old son, the sheriff
said. The suspect had blamed the killings on his slain
brother-in-law.</LD>
<LD>   Police questioned Kemp Crowley after the five were found dead in
his Mesa home. Comments he made when deputies arrived did not "jibe
with what we found in the house," Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio
said.</LD>
<LD>   Crowley, 43, who had a cut on his head, told arriving sheriff's
deputies that he was assaulted and that his brother-in-law, whose
body was found inside, was responsible for the killings.</LD>
<TE>   Arpaio said all the victims, who were found in or near the living
room, had been shot several times. He said they were close together
and "didn't have a chance to fight back." Arpaio said investigators
didn't know why the five were killed. The victims were identified as
Crowley's wife, Tammi Meininger, whom he recently remarried; her son,
Austin Potter; her brother, Mark Potter; her sister, Terri Borden;
and her mother, Joyce Levi.</TE>

<HD>Calif. Officials Fear EPA Smog Plan Could Increase
Pollution</HD>
<DH>Lengthy transition to switch ozone standard could hamper
clean-air efforts, state says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Elizabeth Shogren</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>California officials charge that a Bush administration plan to
achieve lower smog levels in about a decade could perversely mean
more pollution in the meantime.</LD>
<LD>   Although the administration has not released its plan publicly,
Environmental Protection Agency officials have outlined their
proposal in conversations with the states.</LD>
<LD>   At present, the federal government requires the states to hold
hourly ozone levels below federally established standards. The EPA is
converting to a system that will measure average ozone levels over
eight hours.</LD>
<TE>   The eight-hour standard will be stricter than the one-hour
standard. But the deadlines for achieving it are expected to be far
enough in the future that California officials fear local
pollution-control agencies will lose momentum.</TE>
<TE>   "We're afraid this will be a signal to air officials and industry
around the nation that they don't have to work as hard to attain
clean air because suddenly they're given a 10-year reprieve," said
Jerry Martin, spokesman for the state Air Resources Board. "We don't
think the breathers of California can afford a 10-year reprieve."</TE>
<TE>   California officials worry that the EPA will revoke the one-hour
standard and leave localities with no deadline for years. The state
wants the federal government to enforce both standards.</TE>
<TE>   Almost 30 million Californians live in areas that have yet to
attain the one-hour standard. Most of the state's main urban areas
fail to meet the standard. San Diego recently reached it, and the San
Francisco Bay Area appears close.</TE>
<TE>   Most California areas face punitive action from Washington if they
do not meet the standard by 2005. Los Angeles, which is far from
attaining the level, has a 2010 deadline.</TE>
<TE>   EPA officials said the agency had yet to make final decisions on
the shape of its proposal for implementing the new ozone standard.
But they stressed that the plan would not hinder California's efforts
to clean up its air.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not going to do anything that is going to slow down the
momentum in California to reduce ozone levels," said Jeffrey
Holmstead, assistant EPA administrator for air and radiation.</TE>
<TE>   Holmstead added that California's concerns would be considered as
the administration designed its proposal, which is expected to be
unveiled early next year and made final by the end of the year.</TE>
<TE>   But Martin said EPA officials told the state they expected their
plan to drop the one-hour standard about a year after the areas
affected by the new eight-hour standard were designated by the EPA.
The state believes this would remove the deadline pressure that
localities are facing. That pressure otherwise would spur aggressive
efforts in the coming years to cut smog.</TE>
<TE>   The Clinton administration decided to adopt an eight-hour standard
after a thorough review of the one-hour standard. The review, which
was required by the 1970 Clean Air Act, found that the one-hour
standard was not aggressive enough to protect public health.</TE>
<TE>   Even at low levels, ozone can cause acute respiratory problems,
aggravate asthma and impair the immune system. Children are most at
risk. The new eight-hour standard was designed to greatly reduce
risks of asthma attacks, hospital stays and chronic illness.</TE>
<TE>   When setting the new standard, the Clinton administration stated
that the one-hour standard would not be revoked until an area had
attained it for three years in a row, to ensure a smooth transition.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration is redoing the implementation plan because
the Supreme Court ordered the EPA back to the drawing board. In 2001,
the court upheld the eight-hour smog standard, which was being
challenged by truckers and other industries, but told the agency to
redesign its plan for implementing it.</TE>
<TE>   Holmstead said the agency was considering revoking the one-hour
standard because it could be too complicated for states to maintain
both. In some cases, the standards will apply to different
geographical areas.</TE>
<TE>   "There are a lot of implementation difficulties if you're trying
to implement the one-hour and eight-hour standard at the same time,"
Holmstead said.</TE>
<TE>   He said California could opt to keep both standards. Martin
scoffed at that notion.</TE>
<TE>   "That doesn't pass the straight-face test," Martin said. "Keeping
the standard with no federal enforcement power behind it is
meaningless."</TE>
<TE>   The Air Resources Board expressed its concern in a letter to
Holmstead late last week.</TE>
<TE>   "U.S. EPA should not revoke the one-hour standard in existing
non-attainment areas when new eight-hour designations are made,"
Michael P. Kenney, the board's executive officer, said in the letter.
"Such an action would clearly be a weakening of the current
requirements."</TE>
<TE>   Environmental activists agreed that revoking the existing ozone
standard before the states had new programs in place to implement the
new standard could hinder progress toward cleaner air.</TE>
<TE>   "It would be a perverse result for the health standard to be
strengthened and the consequence of that be dirtier air for another
decade," said John Walke, an attorney for the Natural Resources
Defense Council.</TE>
<TE>   California complained that this is just the latest in a string of
actions by the Bush administration that could strip the state of
important tools for cleaning the air. Last month the administration
overhauled the so-called new-source review rules to give major
polluters new flexibility. Those rules govern the circumstances under
which plants must install modern pollution control devices when they
modify their facilities and increase pollution.</TE>
<TE>   "We think it's another assault on the environment that is being
cleverly disguised, just as new-source review, as being an
improvement," Martin said.</TE>

<HD>CSX Paid No Income Tax in 2 of Last 4 Years</HD>
<DH>The company headed by the Treasury secretary-designate had
large pretax profits at same time. Its practices appear legal,
however.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Warren Vieth and Richard Simon</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>CSX Corp., the big railroad company headed by Treasury
secretary-designate John W. Snow, paid no federal income taxes during
at least two of the last four years despite recording more than $1
billion in pretax profits.</LD>
<LD>   Over the same four-year period, the company gave Snow $36 million
in salary, bonuses, stock and options, and forgave a $24-million loan
so he wouldn't lose money along with other shareholders as the
company's stock price declined.</LD>
<LD>   Although CSX's tax and compensation practices appear to be legal,
these and other aspects of Snow's career suggest the man President
Bush has chosen to head his revamped economic team may have a lot of
explaining to do before he takes the oath of office.</LD>
<TE>   "Treasury is supposed to make sure that the taxes are collected
fairly," said Robert McIntyre, director of Citizens for Tax Justice,
an advocacy group that opposes many corporate tax breaks. "Bush has
just nominated a guy who thinks it's dandy that his company's
contributing nothing to help support the country."</TE>
<TE>   Snow's defenders dismiss most of the criticism as politically
motivated cheap shots, and express confidence he will convince
Congress, and the nation, of his suitability to serve as the nation's
chief financial officer.</TE>
<TE>   "The president is very confident that all the investigation that
is relevant on this issue has been looked at thoroughly and fully,
and that the Senate will take a look at all this as well, and that
this nominee will be confirmed," said White House Press Secretary Ari
Fleischer.</TE>
<TE>   Yet even if Snow successfully defends CSX's tax returns and his
own take-home pay, other issues are sure to be raised on Capitol
Hill. Among them: the cancellation of loans he received to buy
company stock, and his sale of CSX shares shortly before the
disclosure of financial setbacks.</TE>
<TE>   Similar to Bush, Cheney</TE>
<TE>   Snow's private sector resume bears a striking similarity to those
of Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney. The president has been
bedeviled by persistent questions about his stock sales while serving
on the board of Harken Energy Corp. 12 years ago. Cheney has drawn
fire for his actions as CEO of Halliburton Co., a big oilfield
services firm that is under investigation for its accounting
practices.</TE>
<TE>   Even Snow's critics concede they have no evidence he and his
company have not played by the rules governing corporate accounting
and compensation. But that may only reinforce perceptions that big
business is allowed to engage in practices and enjoy tax breaks not
available to ordinary taxpayers.</TE>
<TE>   The company has made clear its desire to pay the government as
little as possible. "CSX will pursue all available opportunities to
pay the lowest federal, state and foreign taxes, consistent with
applicable laws and regulations and the company's obligation to carry
a fair share of the cost of government," the management team said in
its 2001 report to shareholders. "CSX also works through the
legislative process for lower tax rates."</TE>
<TE>   Snow made the same basic argument on behalf of the nation's
biggest corporations when he lobbied on Capitol Hill as chairman of
the Business Roundtable in the mid-1990s. He also served on a
blue-ribbon tax reform panel headed by former Cabinet secretary Jack
Kemp, an aggressive champion of tax cuts.</TE>
<TE>   According to an analysis of corporate disclosure documents by
McIntyre's advocacy group, which posted the results on its Internet
site, CSX paid no federal income taxes in 1998, 2000 and 2001.
Instead, it received federal rebates of more than $150 million by
claiming a number of tax breaks, including accelerated depreciation
of equipment purchases.</TE>
<TE>   McIntyre's figures appear to square with the footnotes contained
in CSX's annual reports for the four years in question. In its
itemization of the company's income tax accounting, CSX listed
federal rebates of $103 million in 1998, $53 million in 2000 and $64
million in 2001, and a tax payment of $65 million in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   The company said it deferred $474 million in federal taxes over
the four years, which suggests it ultimately may be required to pay
that amount to the government. In the meantime, it has been able to
use the money for other purposes.</TE>
<TE>   Over the same four-year period, Snow received salary, bonuses and
other cash compensation totaling $15.6 million, CSX stock worth $8.4
million and stock options valued at $12.5 million, for a total pay
package of $36.5 million, according to CSX's filings with the
Securities and Exchange Commission.</TE>
<TE>   CSX is by no means the only company that has deferred taxes by
taking advantage of the many deductions and credits created by
Congress to boost corporate cash flow and encourage new investment.
In fact, the White House is expected to propose expanded business
write-offs as part of a new tax-cut initiative it will unveil early
next year.</TE>
<TE>   Analysis Disputed</TE>
<TE>   CSX and White House officials disputed some aspects of McIntyre's
analysis, saying the company had avoided paying federal taxes in only
two years, 1998 and 2001. They said they could not explain the
discrepancy between the two sets of figures, but insisted the company
had done nothing wrong.</TE>
<TE>   "Throughout John Snow's tenure as chairman of CSX, the company has
been a significant payer of federal income taxes," said CSX spokesman
Adam Hollingsworth, adding that the company made federal tax payments
in nine of the 11 years since Snow became chairman in 1991.</TE>
<TE>   Hollingsworth said the company paid no federal income taxes in
1998 and 2001 because of the tax advantages of reduced operating
income, large capital expenditures, and large deductible interest
payments on debt. But he declined to divulge figures, and said he
could not immediately respond to a reporter's request to make public
the company's income tax returns.</TE>
<TE>   A spokeswoman for Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa), incoming
chairman of the Senate Finance Committee, said the senator was
reserving judgment about CSX's tax payments until the committee's
vetting process is completed. "The committee's questionnaire for
nominees asks detailed questions about financial dealings, conflicts
of interest, etc., so questions about CSX's taxes are likely to be
part of the vetting process," the spokeswoman said.</TE>
<TE>   The tax flap is only one of the issues the committee is likely to
explore as it looks at Snow's record at CSX, which operates the
largest rail network in the eastern United States.</TE>
<TE>   Questions are being raised about a $24-million loan Snow received
from CSX in 1996 to help him purchase $32-million worth of company
stock as a performance incentive. Instead of rising, the price of CSX
stock subsequently declined, reducing the value of Snow's holdings to
less than the loan balance.</TE>
<TE>   Quid Pro Quo Questions</TE>
<TE>   In 2000, the board agreed to forgive the outstanding loans to Snow
and other CSX executives who had made similar stock purchases. At
about the same time, two members of the company's compensation
committee purchased vacation property worth millions of dollars from
CSX subsidiaries, leading some critics to question whether there had
been a quid pro quo.</TE>
<TE>   "This is as egregious as anything we've come up against with any
company," said William B. Patterson, director of the investment
office of the AFL-CIO, which called attention to the loan
cancellation. "The company gave the management a significant upside
if the company did well. When that didn't happen, it just scrapped
the plan and gave the money back. That's contrary to the spirit of
pay for performance."</TE>
<TE>   In the wake of recent corporate scandals, notably last year's
collapse of Enron Corp., such company loans to executives were banned
under reform legislation recently signed into law.</TE>
<TE>   Another potential problem area is Snow's sale of 120,000 shares of
CSX stock in August. Shortly after he sold the stock, the company
announced that its financial condition was weakening, and the stock
price fell. There is no evidence that Snow was anticipating the
negative news when he sold. But it was the same basic sequence of
events that has created problems for Cheney, who sold much of his
Halliburton stock shortly before the oil field services company
disclosed unexpected financial liabilities in late 2000.</TE>
<TE>   White House officials, congressional Republicans, political
analysts and financial experts were quick to defend Snow's record at
CSX, noting that he is widely regarded as an effective corporate
manager who insists on playing by the rules.</TE>
<TE>   "He did nothing wrong," said Charles Gabriel, senior Washington
analyst for Prudential Securities. "This is a publicly traded company
that's using the congressionally enacted tax laws to try to stay in
business and advance its cause and take care of its stakeholders.
What's wrong with that?"</TE>
<TE>   Dick Barsness, a management professor at Lehigh University, said
Snow has performed ably during "a very difficult period for the
railroad industry." Profit margins have been low for years, he said,
and carriers have faced daunting challenges as they try to modernize
their systems and improve service.</TE>
<TE>   "In this environment it would be hard for any leader to be
brilliant," Barsness said. "But Jack Snow has been solid and
forward-looking in positioning CSX for more prosperous days ahead.
This is no small achievement."</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Christopher Cox (R-Newport Beach) said CSX appeared to have
followed acceptable accounting practices, and that he did not think
the criticisms of Snow and CSX would create serious problems for
Bush's nominee.</TE>
<TE>   "The early book on secretary-designate Snow is that he's going to
be speedily confirmed with bipartisan support," Cox said.</TE>
<TE>   Even if Snow is a shoo-in, some lawmakers said the disclosures
raise legitimate questions about existing law and administration
priorities.</TE>
<TE>   "He needs to be asked during the confirmation process whether he's
willing to look at these kinds of deductions," said Rep. Robert T.
Matsui (D-Sacramento). "He has to ask himself philosophically, should
a profitable company ever be in a position where they don't pay
taxes?"</TE>

<HD>Stanford to Create Institute for Embryonic Stem Cell
Research</HD>
<DH>Scientists do not rule out using a form of human embryo
cloning, but other ways will be tried.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Aaron Zitner</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Stanford University on Tuesday announced plans to create new types of
embryonic stem cells that might require its researchers to eventually
attempt a form of cloning human embryos.</LD>
<LD>   The announcement came as the Palo Alto-based university said it
had created a new research institute devoted to using stem cells to
study disease, funded initially by an anonymous $12-million donation.</LD>
<LD>   Stem cells from embryos are a type of biological "blank slate,"
able to copy themselves indefinitely and turn into every other type
of cell in the human body. By studying how stem cells accomplish
this, scientists believe they can understand how cancer cells grow
wildly into tumors, and other mechanisms of disease.</LD>
<TE>   Dr. Irving Weissman, director of the new Institute for Cancer/Stem
Cell Biology and Medicine, said one of his goals is to overcome a
shortcoming in most of the embryonic stem cell lines available today.
Most stem cells have been taken from embryos created at fertility
clinics, and scientists have no specific information about the genes
in those embryos or in the stem cells they produce.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, Weissman wants to produce embryonic stem cells that carry
specific genetic mutations linked to certain diseases.</TE>
<TE>   One line of stem cells, for example, might contain the BRCA1
genetic mutation that has been linked to breast cancer. As the stem
cells transform themselves into breast tissue, scientists would track
the activity of the faulty gene to glean clues to how cancer arises.</TE>
<TE>   Other cells might be created that carry the faulty genes linked to
diabetes, Parkinson's disease and other ailments.</TE>
<TE>   The trick, Weissman said, is to find the best way to produce these
embryonic stem cells.</TE>
<TE>   Weissman's preference, he said, would be to conduct a kind of
genetic swap on existing stem cells. A stem cell could be stripped of
its nucleus, which carries its genes. Then, researchers could insert
a nucleus from someone known to carry the BRCA1 mutation or other
genetic flaws. A group in Australia is already trying this technique,
Weissman said.</TE>
<TE>   But if that method fails, Weissman said he would not rule out
trying a controversial technique that many people consider to be a
form of human cloning.</TE>
<TE>   In this alternate method, a human egg cell would be stripped of
its genes and given DNA from a different person. The result would be
an egg from one person with the genes of another. The egg would
divide into an embryo, and stem cells would be taken from the embryo.</TE>
<TE>   This technique is controversial because it involves creating and
then destroying a human embryo. Moreover, the embryo theoretically
could be implanted into a woman and become a child -- a clone of the
person who donated a nucleus to the egg cell.</TE>
<TE>   President Bush has called for a ban on this technique, even in
disease research. Congress probably will consider the ban next year.</TE>
<TE>   Weissman said that before trying cloning, institute scientists
would conduct extensive work in mice to determine if other methods
are preferable.</TE>
<TE>   Cloning cannot be done with federal funds. Cloning experiments
would have to win approval from a Stanford ethics review board, "and
they would have to say, 'This is the reason I want to do this. This
is my belief of the costs and benefits, the risks and benefits,' "
Weissman said. "I would not be surprised if someone we hired would
eventually do this."</TE>
<TE>   While cloning has drawn sharp opposition from antiabortion groups
and others, some of those critics said Tuesday that they saw little
problem with replacing the genes of a stem cell to create an altered
stem cell.</TE>
<TE>   As long as researchers are not using human eggs to create and
destroy human embryos, "there is no new pro-life issue here," said
Richard Doerflinger, a spokesman for the U.S. Conference of Catholic
Bishops. "It looks like you're just modifying an existing stem cell
line."</TE>
<TE>   If the Stanford scientists do attempt to make cloned human
embryos, they would not be the first at a U.S. university. From 1999
to 2001, biologists at UC San Francisco made an apparently
unsuccessful effort to create cloned human embryos in order to
produce stem cells, the university said earlier this year.</TE>
<TE>   Weissman said that "there's never been a meeting where we talked
about" using cloning to produce stem cells.</TE>
<TE>   The institute "will work first with mice to establish the best way
to create stem cells," said Amy Adams, a university spokeswoman. "The
preference is to transfer a nucleus into an established embryonic
stem cell line. But that's the preference. If the best way to do this
in mice is to use an actual egg, then that's what they will attempt
to do in humans."</TE>

<HD>SEC Choice Praised for Modesty, Integrity</HD>
<DH>Hefty credentials notwithstanding, William Donaldson is
most often described as down to earth and approachable.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Thomas S. Mulligan</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>During a one-on-one lunch Monday at Manhattan's University Club,
Lincoln Center President Reynold Levy learned that one of his key
trustees might have less time to devote to the performing arts center
in the days ahead.</LD>
<LD>   The trustee, William H. Donaldson, mentioned in passing that an
upcoming project "might keep him a little busy for a while," Levy
said Tuesday, shortly after hearing that President Bush had nominated
Donaldson to head the Securities and Exchange Commission.</LD>
<LD>   It was typical of Donaldson both to be modest about the job he was
taking on and to be more concerned about any ill effects on the home
of the New York Philharmonic, the Metropolitan Opera and the New York
City Ballet, Levy said.</LD>
<TE>   For someone who made a fortune on Wall Street, headed the New York
Stock Exchange, helped found the Yale School of Management, served as
an undersecretary of State and commanded a Marine rifle platoon in
the Korean War, Donaldson is down to earth and easily approachable,
people who know him said Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   "He was Bill from Day 1, Bill to everyone -- faculty, students and
staff -- and that set the tone," said Arthur J. Swersey, who started
as a professor at the Yale School of Management in the mid-1970s,
when it opened with Donaldson as its founding dean.</TE>
<TE>   The school was unusual in that it sought to prepare leaders for
government and the nonprofit sector as well as for business and
finance. In that respect, Donaldson may have been an obvious choice
as dean, since his career already had taken him through all those
worlds.</TE>
<TE>   Though Donaldson had a whimsical side -- once demonstrating his
yodeling technique at a Yale Christmas party -- Swersey said he also
had the "inherent toughness" of someone who had founded and run a
successful Wall Street investment firm, Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette.</TE>
<TE>   Others described Donaldson, 71, as a good listener and an acute
questioner, a manager who knows how to delegate and a man of high
integrity.</TE>
<TE>   "He's not afraid of anybody," said Steve Lebow, a Los Angeles
venture capitalist who previously worked for DLJ and met Donaldson
there.</TE>
<TE>   Newport Beach lawyer Francis Quinlan, who serves with Donaldson on
the board of trustees of the Marine Corps University Foundation,
recalled a recent meeting at which the board debated whether to adopt
a bylaw providing for fees to be paid in the event a trustee was
asked to take on a time-consuming special project.</TE>
<TE>   "Bill said, 'Absolutely not. We all signed on to do this for
nothing. It's for the good of the Corps, and we shouldn't take a
penny,' " Quinlan recalled. That ended the debate, he said.</TE>
<TE>   A Buffalo, N.Y., native and now a Manhattan resident, Donaldson
attended Yale as an undergraduate and, like President Bush and his
father, President George H.W. Bush, was a member of Yale's Skull and
Bones secret society.</TE>
<TE>   Donaldson's first job in the securities industry was in the firm
of G.H. Walker &amp; Co., a brokerage founded by the elder President
Bush's maternal uncle George Herbert Walker.</TE>
<TE>   Donaldson attended Harvard Business School and, with classmates
Dan Lufkin and Richard Jenrette, founded DLJ in 1959. It concentrated
on research, grew quickly and in 1970 became the first New York Stock
Exchange member firm allowed to sell shares to the public, enabling
its founders to reap a fortune.</TE>
<TE>   After stepping back from DLJ's daily operations in 1973, Donaldson
entered government service, then went on to help found the Yale
management school. In the 1980s he headed his own investment company,
Donaldson Enterprises.</TE>
<TE>   In 1990 Donaldson was named chairman and chief executive of the
NYSE, where he stayed for five years. But his tenure at the exchange
got mixed reviews.</TE>
<TE>   "He didn't do anything I know about to prepare the NYSE for the
future," William Freund, the NYSE's former chief economist, told
Bloomberg News.</TE>
<TE>   In the late 1990s Donaldson was a senior advisor to DLJ, before it
was sold to Credit Suisse First Boston in 2000 for $13.4 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Though Donaldson was lauded Tuesday by many observers, his recent
corporate connections are certain to be scrutinized in advance of his
Senate confirmation hearings.</TE>
<TE>   Former federal judge William H. Webster's ties to a small
technology company that has been sued for alleged fraud sparked a
firestorm that led to Webster's resignation from the nation's new
accounting industry oversight board last month.</TE>
<TE>   Donaldson was chairman of Aetna Inc. from May 2000 to April 2001,
a period when the company was struggling to refocus itself as a
health-care giant and was shedding its financial services business.
Donaldson earned $7 million in salary and bonus for his service.</TE>
<TE>   Aetna and Donaldson have been sued by some shareholders, who
alleged that they misrepresented the company's restructuring. Aetna
said the suit has no merit, and the firm has filed a motion to
dismiss it.</TE>
<TE>   Donaldson also has served in recent years as a director of two
small companies: EasyLink Services Corp. of Edison, N.J., and Bright
Horizons Family Solutions Inc. of Watertown, Mass.</TE>
<TE>   EasyLink, once known as Mail.com, is a money-losing provider of
electronic mail and other services to businesses. Donaldson became a
director in April 1998 and has served on the company's compensation
and audit committees at various times.</TE>
<TE>   Outside directors such as Donaldson did not receive cash
compensation at EasyLink, but were given stock options.</TE>
<TE>   According to a recent company filing with the SEC, Donaldson
resigned from EasyLink's board Nov. 12, citing personal reasons.</TE>
<TE>   The company, whose shares trade for about 77 cents, has told the
SEC that its losses raise "considerable doubt about the company's
ability to continue as a going concern."</TE>
<TE>   In a statement Tuesday, EasyLink Chairman Gerald Gorman said
Donaldson's "extensive business experience helped us on many
occasions."</TE>
<TE>   Bright Horizons is a profitable provider of employer-sponsored
child-care and early education centers, operating 400 centers in the
U.S., Europe, Canada and the Pacific Rim.</TE>
<TE>   "We have long had enormous admiration for [Donaldson] and for his
diversity of talents, which are unmatched," said Linda Mason, Bright
Horizons' chairwoman.</TE>

<HD>Tighter Rules on Hazardous Agents Sought</HD>
<DH>Federal proposal would require labs that possess specimens
such as anthrax to register.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Laboratories that possess hazardous agents will have to register with
the government under regulations released Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   Under old rules, only labs that transferred or received specimens
posing a threat to public, animal or plant health or safety were
required to register. That left a giant loophole. For example,
federal officials investigating last year's anthrax attacks initially
had no idea how many labs possessed anthrax.</LD>
<LD>   The new rules, being published in the Federal Register, require
anyone who possesses any of 38 agents to register with the national
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention or the Department of
Agriculture and to undergo an inspection to show that security
measures are in place. The list includes bacteria that cause anthrax
and plague and viruses such as ebola, as well as lesser-known agents.</LD>
<TE>   The rules also require all labs to develop biosecurity plans and
background checks on people who work with select agents.</TE>
<TE>   The regulation is open for public comment over the next 60 days,
with a forum set for Monday in Washington where people can express
concerns. If changes are not made in response to the comments, the
rules will become final Feb. 7. Complementary regulations were
announced Tuesday by the USDA and the Department of Health and Human
Services.</TE>
<TE>   "This new rule strengthens our ability to ensure that essential
research on these agents continues while making certain they don't
fall into the wrong hands," Tommy G. Thompson, Health and Human
Services secretary, said in a statement.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, the CDC issued guidelines to help labs comply with the
tighter security requirements. Among the recommendations: Monitor
areas where pathogens are stored, keep specimens locked up and allow
access only to people authorized to work with the agents.</TE>

<HD>GOP Wins Colorado House Seat by 121 Votes</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>DENVER</DL>
<LD>Republican Bob Beauprez won Colorado's new House seat by just 121
votes Tuesday after a recount to settle one of the nation's last
undecided congressional races.</LD>
<LD>   Beauprez received 81,789 votes and Democrat Mike Feeley ended up
with 81,668 votes in the suburban Denver district. Secretary of State
Donetta Davidson announced the results after three counties completed
the recount triggered automatically by the race's slim margin.</LD>
<LD>   The GOP victory means the new breakdown of the House will be 229
Republicans and 204 Democrats, with one independent and a seat in
Hawaii still to be determined. The late Rep. Patsy T. Mink (D-Hawaii)
was elected posthumously on Nov. 5. Hawaii voters will choose her
replacement Jan. 4.</LD>
<TE>   With five weeks of uncertainty over, Feeley called Beauprez to
congratulate him.</TE>
<TE>   "Best of luck as you embark on your new adventure," Feeley said he
told his opponent. Both men went through freshman orientation for
House members in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   Beauprez said the five-week delay was grueling, but that it was
important that the election process be accurate.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not my druthers but before we speed up the count, accuracy
is more important," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The 7th District was created this year because of population
growth and was evenly divided among Republicans, Democrats and
unaffiliated voters. The race was rated a tossup.</TE>
<TE>   At the end of election day, Beauprez led by 386 votes, but clerks
in the three counties were ordered by a judge to count every
qualified provisional ballot. When those returns were released,
Beauprez led Feeley by 122 votes. The recount cost him a single vote.</TE>
<TE>   The election was Colorado's first with provisional ballots, which
are cast by voters whose names are not on official registration
rolls. It is up to election officials to determine later whether the
ballot is valid.</TE>
<TE>   Feeley sued, contending election officials in the three counties
were not using the same standards to decide whether the ballots were
valid.</TE>
<TE>   One county counted all provisional ballots whose voters were
deemed qualified; the other two didn't count ballots whose voters
failed to explain why they voted under special circumstances.</TE>
<TE>   Denver District Judge William Robbins ruled that all ballots cast
by qualified voters should be counted.</TE>

<DL>TALLAHASSEE, Fla.</DL>
<LD>The second in command and seven other top officials at the state's
beleaguered child welfare agency were ousted Tuesday in a shake-up
sparked by the case of a missing Miami girl, whose whereabouts are
still unknown.</LD>
<LD>   Bob Cohen, the deputy secretary of the Department of Children &amp;
Families, along with administrators in Orlando, Palm Beach and Polk
counties were let go.</LD>
<LD>   The departures follow last month's resignation of Charles
Auslander, who oversaw Miami-Dade and Monroe counties. Auslander said
the Rilya Wilson case had nothing to do with his leaving.</LD>
<TE>   Gov. Jeb Bush had asked for the resignation of the department's
administrators and top management as part of a transition into his
second term next month. New department secretary Jerry Regier
accepted the resignations.</TE>
<TE>   The department has been under scrutiny regarding the disappearance
of 5-year-old Rilya Wilson. She was missing from her foster home in
Miami for 15 months before the agency noticed.</TE>

<HD>New Yorkers May Want to Toast Judge</HD>
<DH>He rules that out-of-state vintners can ship directly to
residents.</DH>

<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>A federal judge ruled Tuesday that New York state cannot stop
wineries in the rest of the country from shipping wine directly to
state residents in what vintners hailed as their biggest victory yet
against such shipping bans.</LD>
<LD>   Developments in the case are being widely watched, as New York
consumers make up the second-largest wine market in the United States
behind California, which is also the country's largest producer.
Although lawsuits challenging direct shipping bans are pending in a
number of states, New York is the largest market where such
litigation is pending.</LD>
<LD>   "Corks are popping for hundreds of wineries across America that
rely on direct shipping for sales," said Clint Bolick, vice president
of the Institute for Justice, which argued for the wineries and
consumers who filed the lawsuit.</LD>
<TE>   "It is the best news yet in the ongoing battle to permit direct
shipping of wines to consumers."</TE>
<TE>   Direct shipping cannot start immediately, however, as U.S.
District Judge Richard Berman stayed enforcement of his ruling
pending an appeal by the New York attorney general and wholesalers
seeking to maintain the ban.</TE>
<TE>   The decision followed Berman's finding in November that New York's
direct-shipping ban is unconstitutional because it discriminates
against out-of-state vintners that want to sell products directly to
in-state consumers. Currently, only New York wineries can ship to New
York residents.</TE>
<TE>   To overcome the discriminatory aspects of the ban, lawyers for the
New York state attorney general and wholesalers then sought a ruling
that would also bar New York wineries from shipping directly to
consumers.</TE>
<TE>   Berman, in a one-page order, denied their request and said that
the defendants could not stop out-of-state wineries from shipping to
consumers in the same manner as in-state vintners.</TE>
