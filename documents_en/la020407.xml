<LD>The Bush administration is leading the United States into
catastrophe. Its abstention from the Middle East peace process has
led to all-out warfare between the Israelis and Palestinians. No less
feckless are its plans for an invasion of Iraq, which would lead to a
military quagmire and the likely collapse of Saudi Arabia and Egypt.
Indeed, the extravagant commitments that the United States has made
around the globe--it has military bases in 40 countries--suggest
that, like all empires, it is headed for a crash.</LD>
<TE>   Such a doomsday scenario might be presented by the American left
against the war on terrorism being conducted by the Bush
administration, but there has been hardly a peep of dissent. Though
European leaders suffer heartburn over the idea of an "axis of evil,"
President Bush's high approval ratings have cowed the leadership of
the Democratic Party into silence. The attacks that do come are from
within the ranks of the left for not being patriotic enough. "Damn
the doves," Christopher Hitchens declared in the London Spectator.
Todd Gitlin decries the fact that "the negative faith is America the
ugly." Michael Walzer, writing in the spring issue of Dissent,
denounces his brethren for being "stupid, overwrought, grossly
inaccurate." They should, Walzer declares, accept America's imperial
status and model any responsible opposition on the example of the
Little Englanders during the Boer War. Even Paul Kennedy, who earned
fame for predicting the demise of the U.S. in the 1980s, now lavishes
praise on it for shouldering the burden of empire.</TE>
<TE>   What has developed, in short, is a new consensus about our aims
abroad that is utterly unprecedented in American history. Imperialism
has gone from being a term of opprobrium to an idea that America's
foreign policy elite is embracing. Not since the onset of the Vietnam
War has there been such unanimity of opinion about America's power
and aims. But can this unusual state of affairs last? Will the United
States descend back into bickering over its foreign policy, with
Democrats questioning Bush's war and the Republicans accusing them of
being soft, not on communism, but on terrorism?</TE>
<TE>   Samantha Power's and Max Boot's books suggest that there's no
turning back. Anyone who wants to understand why America has
permanently entered a new era in international relations must read
"'A Problem From Hell'" and "The Savage Wars of Peace." Both are
vividly written and thoroughly researched. Power, a former Balkans
correspondent, and Boot, the editorial features editor of the Wall
Street Journal, are at opposite ends of the ideological spectrum, but
they show the extent to which the humanitarian left and the
interventionist right converged to embrace Wilsonian ends and means
before Sept. 11, even as U.S. administrations remained wary of
becoming entangled in ethnic conflict. Power demands that the United
States intervene militarily whenever and wherever genocidal acts are
taking place; Boot demands that it don the 21st century equivalent of
jodhpurs and pith helmets to bring the rest of the world to heel.</TE>
<TE>   Drawing on U.S. government documents, private papers and numerous
interviews, Power seeks to show that American policymakers have
knowingly turned a blind eye to massacres. In her view, the United
States' policy of nonintervention in the face of genocide has not
been a failure but precisely what diplomats wanted. According to
Power, the pattern of American diplomatic indolence was set during
World War I In Turkey, where Henry Morgenthau, the American
ambassador, cabled back to Washington in July 1915 that a program of
annihilation of the Armenian people was occurring. But Morgenthau's
superiors remained coldly indifferent. The State Department declared,
"However much we may deplore the suffering of the Armenians, we
cannot take any active steps to come to their assistance at the
present time." The United States wished to remain isolationist and
had no desire to become embroiled in internal Turkish affairs. "Time
and again," writes Power, "the U.S. government would be reluctant to
cast aside its neutrality and formally denounce a fellow state for
its atrocities." Indeed, the Turkish horrors set the stage for the
Nazi Holocaust. As Hitler reportedly bragged to his henchmen, "Who
remembers the Armenians?"</TE>
<TE>   It was only after the Holocaust that the term "genocide" came into
existence. Power devotes an entire chapter to chronicling the
attempts of the Polish emigre lawyer Raphael Lemkin to create an
international law that would make the destruction of ethnic and
religious groups a crime. Lemkin's tireless efforts resulted in the
adoption by the fledgling United Nations of the Genocide Convention
in 1948, which the United States refused to ratify for 40 years,
fearing that the language was open-ended enough so that unfriendly
states would be tempted to apply the convention's statutes against
it. Not until the 1970s did genocide again impose itself upon the
world's consciousness.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, it was the memory of the Holocaust that human rights
activists invoked during Pol Pot's massacre of Cambodians. "By 1977,"
Power says, "because it had become widely accepted that a bloodbath
was indeed taking place in Cambodia, advocates of U.S. engagement
tried to jar decision makers and ordinary citizens by likening Pol
Pot's atrocities to those of Hitler." But with the U.S. having
emerged from Vietnam, the last thing the Carter administration wanted
to do was intervene in Cambodia. William F. Buckley Jr. and George
McGovern, of all people, both called for intervention. It was a
harbinger of the unlikely alliances that would form over Bosnia.</TE>
<TE>   Focusing as she does on the humanitarian case for intervention,
Power might have made more of the fact that it is often in the
national interest of the United States to arrest the slide toward, or
prosecution of, genocide. Bosnia, where Power limns the passivity and
outright lies of Clinton administration officials, provides one case
where Europe and the United States needed to stop the Serbs to
prevent violence from spreading through southeastern Europe. But Iraq
would perhaps have provided Power's most telling example. The
equivocations and falsehoods that Power describes in Reagan and Bush
administration policy toward Iraq are devastating. Though it has been
consigned to the memory hole, the United States was quite partial to
Saddam Hussein during his war against Iran. Despite Hussein's use of
poison gas against the Iranians and, later, the Kurds, U.S. officials
steadfastly insisted that the evidence was uncertain. Power correctly
observes that the Bush administration also betrayed the Kurds during
their uprising in 1991 by failing to support them against Hussein.
She focuses on the grievous loss of life and the failure of American
officials to ever seek to prosecute any Iraqis for their crimes.</TE>
<TE>   To be sure, she notes that "the United States now has reason to
fear that the poisonous potions Hussein tried out on the Kurds will
be used next on Americans." But she might have noted that failing to
assist the Kurds was also a strategic calamity for the United States.
It was in the U.S. national interest to support a revolt that would
have helped drive Hussein from power. Above all, Power never
considers whether humanitarian intervention could also serve as a
smoke screen for expanding American power. Should American objectives
always be humanitarian, or do the exigencies of world politics mean
that, however noble our professed goals, at best a queasy mix of
power politics and human rights will always prevail?</TE>
<TE>   Enter Boot. If Power is rather vague about how she would deploy
military power, Boot is ruthlessly hard-nosed. Not for him
namby-pamby talk about international institutions. The United States,
as he notes, has been engaged in military operations against foreign
adversaries. Boot offers a conspectus of America's small wars,
beginning with its forays against Mediterranean pirates in the 18th
century down to the Clinton administration's operations in the
Balkans. Along the way, he explodes a number of myths about the
military such as the beliefs that the United States has always had
exit strategies and never engaged in what Republicans dismissively
termed the Clinton administration's "social work." On the contrary,
he notes that the U.S. military "stayed continuously in Haiti for 19
years, in Nicaragua for 23 years, in the Philippines for 44 years, in
China for almost 100 years." Boot's only concern is whether Americans
have lost their nerve. He likens America to the British empire,
pointing out that the British army, in the course of Queen Victoria's
little wars, suffered major defeats before bouncing back: "If
Americans cannot adopt a similarly bloody-minded attitude, then they
have no business undertaking imperial policing."</TE>
<TE>   With their survival at stake, Americans have indeed become
bloody-minded again. The change began in the Balkans, where everyone
from David Rieff and Hitchens to William Kristol and Paul Wolfowitz
insisted that the United States had a moral and strategic obligation
not to stand by passively. Now the Bush administration, which entered
office declaring that the United States had to refrain from
nation-building, has shed its isolationist impulses. The
administration has moved from scoffing at intervention in ethnic
conflict to listing everything up to genocide as justification. No
longer can Americans occlude the grim realities they tried to ignore
during the 1990s. The United States may not be imperialist, but it is
acting imperially. The question is not whether, but to what extent,
it will attack its foes.</TE>

<DH>RED POPPIES, A Novel By Alai, Translated from the Chinese
by Howard Goldblatt and Sylvia Li-chun Lin, Houghton Mifflin: 434
pp., $25</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ISABEL HILTON</AU>
<BD>Isabel Hilton is the author of "The Search for the
Panchen Lama" and a staff writer for the New Yorker.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In old Tibet, of course, novels rarely existed. There were poetry and
song, there were religious texts and storytellers and narrative in
the epic tradition. The novel, though, along with secular history and
biography, was all but unknown in the Tibetan language, nor was the
written language well adapted to the purpose.</LD>
<LD>   It was not until the 1980s--a relatively enlightened decade in
Tibet and China that ended cruelly for both--that Tibetan novels
began to appear. Some had been written decades earlier--dreary
social-realist works written to demonstrate the cruel nature of the
old society and the joy of the masses on their "liberation" by China.
Despite their fidelity to official norms, they had to wait for
publication, so suspicious was Beijing of any Tibetan voice.By the
time they appeared, far more interesting literary movements were
afoot that would produce truly realist Tibetan novels. At the same
time, many young Chinese writers, disillusioned with the direction of
their own culture, found in Tibet an exotic cultural stimulus. Most
of the first novels about Tibet to be read in China were written by
Chinese.</LD>
<TE>   So where does "Red Poppies," perhaps the first magical realist
"Tibetan" novel to reach the Western market, fit? The publishers
claim it is a book that does for Tibet what the works of Gabriel
Garcia Marquez have done for Colombia. But a more direct
parallel--and a more illuminating comparison--might be to Salman
Rushdie's "Midnight's Children." "Red Poppies" has neither the
stature nor complexity of "Midnight's Children," but is it, as
presented, a Tibetan novel, or is it a hybrid? "Midnight's Children"
is a post-colonial novel about India written in English. "Red
Poppies" is a novel set in a pre-colonized Tibetan district, written
in Chinese.</TE>
<TE>   The author, Alai, is an ethnic Tibetan from the eastern
borderlands of the old Tibetan province of Kham--a place that, though
culturally Tibetan, was always politically ambiguous. It was not
under the political or religious control of Lhasa, which lies far to
the west. In Kham, the Dalai Lama was seen as a remote figure who
represented a school of Buddhism--the Gelugpa--that held little sway
locally.</TE>
<TE>   To the east lay China, with its equally distant capital. The
degree of control exercised by the Chinese empire depended on the
condition of the imperial dynasty of the day. If the empire was weak,
it could assert influence only through trade or bribery. If it was
strong, the imperial armies could punish. Symbolic tribute and taxes
would intermittently find their way to the Chinese capital and,
sporadically, imperial gifts would filter down through local
officials.</TE>
<TE>   By the 19th century, as the Qing Dynasty began to fail, this was a
negotiated borderland where local chieftains slugged it out among
themselves, bending the knee to imperial authority when strictly
necessary but wielding absolute power within their own backyard. In
1905, at the very end of the Qing dynasty, a Chinese general, Zhao
Erfang, occupied eastern Tibet and, in a precursor of Chinese
Communist policies, began to eliminate the Buddhist clergy with a
view to assimilating the territory and populating it with Chinese
peasants. After the Chinese invasion of Tibet in 1950, this portion
of Tibet's borderlands was absorbed into the Chinese province of
Sichuan.</TE>
<TE>   "Red Poppies" is set between the fall of the Qing Dynasty in
1911and the victory of the Communist Party in 1949, when the local
chieftains were not greatly troubled by Chinese authority: Between
the Japanese occupation and the Chinese civil war, no aspiring power
in China had the reach to bring the borderlands into line. The
chieftains enjoyed an Indian summer of almost untrammeled local
power. It was a world that, nevertheless, was doomed to vanish.</TE>
<TE>   "Red Poppies," Alai's first novel, tells the story of the Maichis,
the family of a powerful local chieftain who holds absolute sway over
his servants and slaves and expends his energies in the vigorous
enjoyment of sex and the local struggle for power with rival clan
chiefs. The wider world and its events--the incursion of Western
powers, the politics of distant Lhasa, the continuing wars in China,
the Japanese invasion--are filtered through the brief appearances of
a series of minor characters.</TE>
<TE>   There is Charles, ostensibly a Western missionary, who is bent on
collecting mineral samples. A Chinese official called Huang
encourages the Maichis to plant the opium poppy. The chieftain's
daughter, who has married an Englishman, appears only to demand a
vast dowry in silver and leave for London. A Gelugpa monk called
Wangpo Yeshi arrives from Lhasa to challenge the shamanistic local
monks. The chieftain punishes Wangpo Yeshi twice for speaking his
mind too directly: the Maichi family executioner cuts out his tongue
and he becomes the family's historian.</TE>
<TE>   The novel's narrator is the second son, born of a marriage between
the chieftain and his second wife, who is Chinese. The boy is
considered an idiot, but his idiocy, of course, allows him to
challenge the moribund conventions of his father and older brother.
The idiot knows the chieftain's world is doomed.</TE>
<TE>   It is he who marries the most beautiful woman and enlarges the
family fortune. Sent to the borders of the family estate, he turns
the fortress his brother has built into a trading post, and a
flourishing town springs up around it. When the Red Army finally
arrives, its officers offer to keep him on as chieftain, but the
Maichi world has collapsed; the old chieftain dies in the rubble of
his estate and the narrator submits willingly to his own fate in the
last act of a revenge drama.</TE>
<TE>   "Red Poppies" stands on its own literary merits, accessible to the
reader without the historical background or even a precise
geographical fix on the novel's setting. It stands up to comparison
with other examples of contemporary fiction in China--where magical
realism is enjoying a vogue, and Alai has demonstrated that he can
move from the short story to the long form without losing his grip.
But the context helps to challenge the publisher's bizarre claim that
"Red Poppies" dispels "many of the popular myths about a uniformly
pacificistic society peopled by devout worshipers." That mythological
Tibet derives from a Western work of popular fiction, James Hilton's
"Lost Horizon," and was perpetuated in "The Third Eye," a fantasy
first published in 1956 and penned by a man who was not, as he
claimed, the son of a "high Tibetan lama" but of a plumber in the
English county of Devon. Neither did Tibet any service. "Red Poppies"
is a work of fiction, mercifully, of an altogether higher order, but
it does the author no favors to treat his literary imagination as
though it were a contribution to historical debate.</TE>
<TE>   The question of literary and linguistic identity, though, is more
interesting. The Chinese dismemberment of Tibet relocated Alai's
birthplace within the borders of the Chinese province of Sichuan, and
Alai, born in 1959, is of a generation that grew up under Chinese
rule in a Tibetan cultural environment.</TE>
<TE>   According to the historian Tsering Shakya, as late as the 1930s,
only a tiny minority spoke Chinese in Eastern Tibet. With the Chinese
invasion of Tibet in 1950, however, that changed. Alai's age group
received schooling in Chinese--even in Lhasa, China has banned the
use of Tibetan in university education--and Alai is unable to write
in Tibetan. His more famous contemporary, the Tibetan writer Tashi
Dawa, neither writes nor speaks it.</TE>
<TE>   For young Tibetan intellectuals, even in the Tibet Autonomous
Region, Chinese is the only language of advancement and power for a
job, for an education. It is also the language that gives access, in
these more liberal cultural times in the People's Republic, to
outside influences. If Alai quotes Walt Whitman, as he does in an
earlier short story ("Wind Over the Grasslands"), it is because
Whitman is translated into Chinese. And if he writes in magical
realist style, it is less to do with Tibetan literary trends than
with the fact that a generation of young Chinese writers has adopted
it. Like that generation of post-colonial Indian writers who write in
English, Alai uses the language of the colonizer--and an imported
literary form--to construct his version of the colonized culture.</TE>
<TE>   In Lhasa, too, novels are being written, but for a different
readership. According to Yangdon Thondup, a London-based scholar of
contemporary Tibetan literature, Tibetan-language novels are
unfortunately rarely translated and reach only local readers. China,
it seems, is still not interested in the authentic Tibetan voice.
Novels like "Red Poppies," on the other hand, that treat Tibetan
subjects in Chinese, are popular in China where they are considered
Tibetan. In Tibet they see things differently. Alai himself might be
considered Tibetan, but his novel is not . Such novels read strangely
to Tibetans, as though they were written for outsiders. It's a
situation that has its own ironies, well illustrated by the success
in China of "Red Poppies." The novel won the Mao Dun Prize, China's
top literary award. No novel written in any of China's "minority"
languages--including Tibetan--is eligible.</TE>

<HD>The Stranger</HD>
<DH>THE IMPRESSIONIST , A Novel By Hari Kunzru, Dutton: 388
pp., $24.95</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMIE JAMES</AU>
<BD>Jamie James is the author of a novel, "Andrew and
Joey."</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The production of great doorstopping novels about the Raj has become
a minor industry in British fiction. Paul Scott's "Raj Quartet,"
drawing on classics of the colonial era, was the prototype, and
Vikram Seth's "A Suitable Boy" perhaps the champion in the
teeming-tapestry-of-life Olympics. As do many other formulas, the Raj
novel provides ample scope for incisive literature, although few
works in the field rise to the level of those novels.</LD>
<LD>   That genre is also ripe for satire, as British journalist Hari
Kunzru proves with his witty, engrossing fictional debut, "The
Impressionist." His narration takes a perennial character of the
genre, the protagonist of mixed race, and wraps the plot around one
of the classic themes of 19th century melodrama, the outcast
wanderer, as famously exemplified by Charles Maturin's gothic chiller
"Melmoth the Wanderer" and Eugene Sue's "The Wandering Jew."</LD>
<TE>   True to its type, "The Impressionist" begins with an invocation of
the devastating power of nature, a flash flood in which our hero is
conceived by a British officer (who promptly drowns) and an
aristocratic Kashmiri girl on her way to be married. She dies in
childbirth, and her son, Pran, grows up as the cosseted, pale-skinned
darling of his putative father. When the boy reaches puberty, the old
man falls sick, and on his deathbed a vengeful nursemaid reveals the
truth of Pran's parentage. The boy is cast out, and his wandering
begins.</TE>
<TE>   Pran innocently seeks shelter in a brothel, where he is drugged,
kidnapped and dressed as a girl, under constant threat of being made
a eunuch by a mad madam's knife. Because of his pallid good looks,
Pran is sold to the harem of a tiny mountain sultanate called
Fatehpur, which appears to be modeled on the daft gay princedom in
J.R. Ackerley's 1932 Indian memoir, "Hindoo Holiday." The boy's
assignment is to bait a blackmail trap for the Crown's pedophilic,
alcoholic representative, Maj. Augustus Privett-Clampe, who holds
Fatehpur's future in his quavering hands.</TE>
<TE>   Privett-Clampe has Pran, now known as Rukhsana, dress as an
English schoolboy and recite patriotic verse for his erotic
delectation. The demented officer gives the confused young man some
advice: "You've got some white blood in you," he says. "The thing is,
boy, you have to learn to listen to it. It's calling to you through
all the black, telling you to stiffen your resolve. If you listen to
what the white is telling you, you can't go wrong."</TE>
<TE>   The lad escapes the clutches of Privett-Clampe during a disastrous
tiger hunt, and the narrative careens forward in mad earnest, as its
shadowy protagonist transforms his identity time and again to
survive.</TE>
<TE>   In each of Pran's incarnations, Kunzru deftly sends up one
literary cliche after another, from a lustful fundamentalist
preacher, who might have graced the pages of a story by Somerset
Maugham, to spiritualist seances to the gilded youth of Oxford
(complete with yet another cameo appearance by Harold Acton).</TE>
<TE>   Young Pran, who now passes for white, ventures to West Africa,
where he has joined a doomed anthropological expedition. Kunzru here
flirts with danger, mingling the muscular derring-do of John Buchan
and H. Rider Haggard with the borderline racism of Evelyn Waugh's
exotic farces--an irony all the more piquant because of Pran's own
ethnic ambiguity.</TE>
<TE>   At the story's end, Pran is seen drifting through the desert
wearing a burnoose, leading his camel on to the next stage of his
exile--"Return of the Impressionist," no doubt.</TE>
<TE>   Kunzru brilliantly succeeds at the first requirement of satire:
that it respect the canons of its targets. "The Impressionist" is
every bit as colorful and suspenseful a tale as the best of the
originals it spoofs; and for all its ironic fun, the book's
psychological insights and emotional texture are on a par with or
exceed most of the earnest confessional novels that dominate the
literary scene.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, as artificial as much of the novel's humor is, each of
its far-flung locales has a palpable, racy vivacity. If anything, one
wishes that the book were heftier, even more packed; Kunzru is
clearly aiming for the generous amplitude of a Victorian mystery in
the mold of Wilkie Collins or late Dickens, but his narrative seems
slightly rushed at times, particularly in the African section.</TE>
<TE>   The book's principal failure, if that's what it is, is that its
protean protagonist never comes fully to life: Like his predecessors
in the great 19th century wanderer epics, Pran is a symbol more than
a lifelike character, representing in this 21st century narrative
conflicting attitudes toward race rather than the demands of
Christian morality. The problem inherent in Kunzru's bracingly
insouciant approach is that most modern readers, when the subject is
race, finally demand something more substantial than wit, however
inventive it might be.</TE>

<LD>To the editor:</LD>
<LD>   The review of "Science Fictions" (Book Review, Feb. 17)
uncritically repeats the book's accusations against the
world-renowned virologist Robert Gallo. These accusations initially
appeared in newspaper articles written more than a decade ago by the
author of "Science Fictions" and led to an exhaustive review by the
National Institutes of Health. The NIH's 1993 report concluded that "
... one might anticipate from all the evidence, after all the sound
and fury, there would be at least a residue of palpable wrongdoing.
That is not the case." Helen Epstein's review irresponsibly fails
even to mention the official findings that negate the central
conclusions of the book.</LD>
<TE>   Epstein repeats two specific misrepresentations that are
particularly worth correcting. The first is that Gallo's group
inappropriately claimed credit for HIV discoveries involving the
laboratory of Luc Montagnier in Paris. Science magazine (Feb. 22,
2002) quotes Montagnier himself saying he does not believe any such
theft occurred. The second concerns the suggestion that Gallo
retarded development or implementation of an effective blood test for
HIV. Quite the contrary. The record is clear that Gallo's test was
the first to be patented and that it rapidly transformed the design
of public health strategies to slow HIV transmission. Without Gallo's
test, the world's most dreadful epidemic would have been far worse.</TE>
<TE>   The L.A. Times' one-sided review of a deeply flawed book both
impugns the reputations of many distinguished scientists and
distracts them from a highly important unfinished agenda.</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Helen Epstein replies:</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, the NIH wanted to put this matter to rest 10 years ago,
and "Science Fictions" describes in great detail how it did so. That
the scientists involved do not want to revive this fracas is
unsurprising. However, as "Science Fictions" also shows, the real
history of the race to discover HIV is not so simple and readers have
a right to know about it.</TE>
<TE>   As my review stated, Gallo's HIV test was indeed the first to be
patented. However, the patent for the more accurate French test was
submitted several months earlier. Gallo's application was expedited;
the French one wasn't, and the French test was kept out of the market
for years.</TE>

<DH>THE APPRENTICE LOVER, A Novel By Jay Parini, HarperCollins:
320 pp., $24.95</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KAI MARISTED</AU>
<BD>Kai Maristed is the author of, among other works,
"Belong to Me: Stories" and "Fall: A Novel."</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Oh, to be a lad of 22, bright and well-favored, transported from the
doldrums of a classics major at Columbia to life and lust among the
literary glitterati on the isle of Capri.</LD>
<LD>   Such is the self-engineered fortune of Alex Massolini, hero and
narrator of Jay Parini's pleasure-filled sixth novel, "The Apprentice
Lover." "In 1970, just three months short of graduation ... I left
behind my college, friends, my parents, and everything familiar in an
attempt to cut loose from the overfilled barge of my youth, which had
become too heavy to drag."</LD>
<LD>   For Alex, a third-generation hyphenated American raised in
small-town Pennsylvania, by far the heaviest load on that barge is
the ghost of his older brother Nicky, recently blown to bits by a
land mine in Vietnam. Having tried "barbiturates, prayer and pot" in
vain, faced with pressure from the family to return home and take
Nicky's place in the family construction business, the only strong
feeling Alex can locate is the urge to flee. Desperate to trade in
his grubby, familiar world for a crack at sophistication and
sensuality, he answers an ad seeking a "private secretary" to the
renowned Scottish expatriate poet, novelist and historian Rupert
Grant on Capri. Grant says yes, indulgent Uncle Vinnie kicks in
travel money and Alex sets to sea.</LD>
<TE>   Capri can't help but be a magical place. Certainly Turgenev (as
quoted in Shirley Hazzard's fine memoir, "Greene on Capri") thought
so, calling the island "a miracle, and not because of the marvellous
Blue Grotto, but because the entire place is a virtual temple to the
goddess of Nature, the incarnation of Beauty ... I have made three
visits to Capri, each for a considerable time, and I tell you this:
that the impression will remain with me until I die."</TE>
<TE>   As Hazzard wrote: "The capacity of an island less than four miles
long, with an area of five and a half square miles, to sustain the
ever-increasing tourism of nearly three centuries is one of its
mysteries."</TE>
<TE>   Parini, too, writes lovingly and evocatively of the charms of this
upcrop of rock, once the chosen site of self-exile of the emperor
Tiberius. "It struck me that Capri never disappoints the senses,
rushing at every organ full-blast, with variety and texture ...
Covetously, I ran my fingers along the walls, prizing the chalky
stone with its rough and porous grain."</TE>
<TE>   Not so coincidentally, the lionized and leonine Rupert Grant is at
work on an island history featuring that same insatiable emperor,
whom posterity has enshrined more for his outrageous perversities
than for the genuine achievements of his youth. (So revolting were
Tiberius' rumored excesses that a member of his entourage starved
himself to death in protest.) Rupert, too, in the gardened privacy of
his aptly named Villa Clio keeps quite an entourage: In addition to
elegant wife Vera, a pair of blase teenage offspring and various
servants, there are two nubile "research assistants," the sultry
neapolitan Marisa and the English ice-queen Holly.</TE>
<TE>   While Rupert amuses himself with both girls and plays them off
each other, inscrutable Vera looks on. Marisa lusts for Alex, Alex
pines for Holly, and Vera decides that Alex has a gay thing going
with Patrice, a comical philosophy student from the Sorbonne.</TE>
<TE>   Guests, mostly rich or famous, mostly homosexual males, and mostly
on loan from "real life"--Auden, Vidal, Greene--pop up at the dinner
table, spouting bons mots like so many clever papier-mache
caricatures. Other Big Names echo down the years: Stephen Spender,
Norman Douglas, Rainer Maria Rilke. For variety, some writers don
fictional alter egos: The reader perceives the shade of Mario Puzo in
the none-of-your-artsy-bull Dom Bonano, and a mix of Robert Graves
and Lawrence Durrell spooks in the unfathomable Rupert. No wonder
young Alex spends much of his time hoping to earn favor and agonizing
over just how foolish he looks or sounds to these demigods.</TE>
<TE>   The body of the "The Apprentice Lover" floats on this shining
surface, strangely weightless and without much consequence. Perhaps
Parini, who in previous novels ("The Last Station," "Benjamin's
Crossing") has exploited the fictional re-creation of dead writers to
darker purpose, has succeeded here all too well in capturing the
jejune earnestness of a young poet-in-waiting. Along with glorious
one-nighters and great cooking, Alex delivers passages of literary
how-to and who-wrote-what-when that would be appropriate to a fiction
workshop.</TE>
<TE>   At unexpected intervals, however, a new voice breaks in: deeper
and assuredly sarcastic. The raspy baritone belongs to dead Nicky,
speaking through brotherly letters from Nam that Alex has carried
into exile. These musings of an unassuming soldier slated for
sacrifice in a senseless war, his sentinel's observations and
hard-won convictions, the sadness of such growth cut short--all
promise, and merit, a novel of their own.</TE>

<DH>THE INCANTATION OF FRIDA K., A Novel By Kate Braverman,
Seven Stories Press:  224 pp., $23.95</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>YXTA MAYA MURRAY</AU>
<BD>Yxta Maya Murray is the author of "Locas," "What It
Takes to Get to Vegas" and the forthcoming novel "The Conquest." She
is a professor at Loyola Law School.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Mexican painter Frida Kahlo took the messy, wonderful and sometimes
horrible stuff that is a woman's life and transformed it into
likenesses that are as bracing as ice on a burn. Her self-portraits,
painted in the 1930s and 1940s, reveal a hirsute red-lipped woman
whose dark and staring eyes accuse the observer of
crimes--indifference, complacency and worse. The portraits (and a
large portion of her oeuvre was an obsessive excavation of her own
image) are hallucinatory and disorienting. Sometimes Kahlo portrays
herself as a man, a moody siren, a heartbroken Mary Magdalene; in
other works she depicts herself as a victim of physical illness
undergoing excruciating treatments in a hospital.</LD>
<LD>   Naturally, Kahlo's reliance on self-portraiture leads us to wonder
about the autobiographical foundations for these various
incarnations; Kahlo, too, admitted that style and substance merged in
her work, when she so famously said: "I never painted dreams. I
painted my own reality." And most of us have heard the stories:
Didn't she have some sort of horrible disfiguring accident? Didn't
her husband, muralist Diego Rivera, treat her like a doormat? Didn't
she commit suicide? Didn't she have an exotic love life?</LD>
<TE>   It is easier, actually, to grapple with these facts and rumors
than with the art itself. With the art, we're floating at sea; we're
confused and exhilarated; we're indicted with felonies we didn't even
know we had committed. But when we work with the facts and the
rumors, we can reduce Kahlo the great artist into Frida the troubled
and bisexual brown girl: Yes, she had a mutilating accident and had
polio; she loved women; she loved and hated Diego; she was a drug
addict. And once she is so condensed, she isn't that intimidating at
all. We could do anything that we wanted with her, now that we see
her sick, strange, dejected, dead. And dead exotic female artists
usually can't escape being shrunk to fit into shapes that suit the
next generations' needs for Tragic Victims of Patriarchy (Sylvia
Plath) or Madwomen in the Attic (Virginia Woolf) or Genius Hermit
Virgins (Emily Dickinson, though that reputation is being revised).</TE>
<TE>   It was inevitable that current consumers would refashion Kahlo's
story. There is the upcoming biopic starring the Mexican actress
Salma Hayek, of which I know nothing. My worst fear was that by now
I'd be watching some soapy network miniseries starring Meryl Streep
in brown face and Antonio Banderas in a fat suit.</TE>
<TE>   Oh, God, now I only wish it were that, after having read Kate
Braverman's shockingly bad fictionalized biography of Kahlo, "The
Incantation of Frida K."</TE>
<TE>   The novel contains a chaotic rendition of Kahlo's inner monologue
as she lies on her deathbed. Braverman, a Los Angeles native who has
won acclaim for works such as "Lithium for Medea" and "Palm
Latitudes," wastes her gifts of poetry and passion on an incoherent
account of Kahlo's marriage, travels, miscarriage and, most
prominently, her illness.</TE>
<TE>   That pain and sickness ate up a significant portion of Kahlo's
life is well-known. Moreover, though Kahlo gained fame as a
portraitist of Latina identity, she also illustrated the desperation
and agony that accompany serious injury and disease, and so
articulated a part of life that less brave artists might have shut
their eyes on. The world of literature could use a similar
contribution, but Braverman takes Kahlo's sometimes explicit
depictions of disability as a license to devolve into lurid and
disjointed accounts of Kahlo's physical disintegration.</TE>
<TE>   There are lengthy and pornographic descriptions of corroding body
parts, fungus on skin, infections, pubic infestations--why go on?
Moreover, sensational descriptions of disease are used for the
archaic purpose of adding an exotic and even mystical element to the
narrative: "My toes were decaying in my shoes .... They were having
their own autumn. They would curl and fall." "In the corridors,
golden moths with metal mouths. They feed in hospitals and depots.
They spread infection. They carry cancer. They slip through the
mesh."</TE>
<TE>   It is important to note that Kahlo's work, too, was called
pornographic, on account of its depictions of disease and violence
against women. In the 1944 "The Broken Column," Kahlo paints herself
nude, bleeding, pierced with nails and physically ripped open to
reveal the shattered obelisk that represents her spine. In 1945's
"Without Hope" she vomits a fountain of repulsion while lying in a
hospital bed.</TE>
<TE>   These canvases are not pretty things to look at, having none of
the simple grace of some of the still lifes and the more
pulchritudinous self-portraits. But Kahlo's work avoids being simply
shocking and so, in the end, banal because of her excellent
craftswomanship: Her renderings are precise, edited, accurate and
elegant. Also, she withholds in her paintings. Even at their most
graphic, Kahlo maintains her famous reserved expression and so
creates a tension in the work between dignity and almost unbearable
candor.</TE>
<TE>   But Braverman would undo all that careful work with "The
Incantation of Frida K.," which is neither precise nor taut, though
not without merit. Braverman clearly has a great affection for the
artist and what she represents--audacious and idiosyncratic
womanhood, female creativity, the romance of the underdog. She writes
well of Kahlo's miscarriage and the emotional trauma of her loss. But
these achievements cannot compensate for the obsessive return to
repulsive imagery or the portrayal of Rivera, shown here as a
stick-figure misogynist who repeatedly curses Kahlo, near-rapes her
and is a so-so painter besides.</TE>
<TE>   They also cannot remit the sometimes haphazard storytelling. To
her credit, Braverman has taken on an awesome project in
fictionalizing Kahlo's hardships and imagining the monologue of a
painter who eschewed coherence in favor of dream-like fantasy.
Writers attempting to translate less-than-linear art like Cubism
(Gertrude Stein) and jazz (Jack Kerouac) have struggled to write
works that sustain those art forms' fixating qualities for page upon
page. Braverman runs up against the same challenge. She makes a good
choice by infusing her prose with poetry-like elements but in the end
she is not able to maintain the crispness necessary for a novel.</TE>
<TE>   "I understand what floats on rivers which conclude in harbors pale
as the veins of infants," she writes. "What you see from your veranda
is not debris but entire texts rendered intelligible. This is what
moves in the current, on the backs of stray fronds, the sodden
bleached lily and old newspapers. Cures for insomnia and betrayal by
man and accident. And methods to heal abscesses and find lost
daughters."</TE>
<TE>   There is a greater hazard to this sometimes delirious style of
writing than mere unintelligibility. Later on, when describing a man
sitting on a curb, the character Kahlo begins by describing his dirty
feet and cigar and then moves into a baffling and unnecessary
conjecture of how he has brutally sexually molested his 9-year-old
daughter. Images of the seamy and the sick are employed gratuitously
to maintain the energy of the novel, which cruises inevitably
downward, as the facts of Frida Kahlo's life hang like weights from
the narrative. One wishes Braverman had crafted a story that drew
upon the artist's reserve and lapidary style.</TE>
<TE>   It is astonishing that Kahlo made so much beauty out of her
difficult life. When you stand in front of the paintings of the
hirsute red-lipped woman with the strange stare, you're looking at
someone who did more than document her suffering. Instead of sinking
under the weight of that world, Kahlo was able to transform her
illness and heartbreak into art that is rich and brilliant and, if
not light, then illuminating, with her potent but controlled touch.</TE>

<DH>CITY OF BONES, A Novel By Michael Connelly, Little, Brown:
394 pp., $25.95</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JACK NESSEL</AU>
<BD>Jack Nessel is a former editor of New York magazine and
Psychology Today.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Maybe it's the climate: With the possible exception of South Florida,
Los Angeles is home to more fictional shamuses and criminals than
anyplace else in America. You can almost imagine Michael Connelly's
authority-flaunting police detective Harry Bosch and Robert Crais'
smart-mouthed private investigator Elvis Cole throwing each other
sardonic little salutes as they cross paths on L.A.'s mean streets.
They live virtually within a gunshot sound of each other in the
Hollywood Hills, not all that far on the freeways from a half a dozen
or so fellow storybook crime solvers, including, most notably, Faye
Kellerman's Police Lt. Peter Decker; her husband Jonathan's
psychologist and police consultant Alex Delaware; and Walter Mosley's
reluctant defender of the oppressed, Easy Rawlins.</LD>
<TE>   Once upon a time, Philip Marlowe owned the town. Raymond
Chandler's knight in cheap clothing became the model for countless
hard-boiled (but usually softhearted) L.A. detectives, who have been
following his footprints for 60 years, one of the best of the current
crop being Connelly's Hieronymus (Harry) Bosch. A middle-aged
jazz-loving homicide cop who works out of the Hollywood station,
Bosch is not a private eye, but he's easily recognizable as the hero
Chandler described in "The Simple Art of Murder"--"a lonely man and
his pride is that you treat him as a proud man or be very sorry you
ever saw him." He is good but not too good, tenacious, proud,
insolent, driven by a steely determination that justice be done.</TE>
<TE>   Bosch, like Marlowe, is a loner with a talent to annoy, a man who
goes his own way, a "knight in tarnished armor," as a new woman in
his life pegs him. He sees his calling as "[n]othing big, nothing
heroic. Just the chance to maybe make things right every now and
then."</TE>
<TE>   Last year, in "A Darkness More Than Night," Harry was cleared of a
series of grotesque murders straight out of "The Garden of Earthly
Delights," the centerpiece of the scary tryptic painted by his
namesake, the 15th century cartographer of hell. Readers familiar
with the modern Bosch from even a few of his six earlier appearances
knew from the start that he couldn't be guilty. Bosch is certainly a
dark knight, but he was never a credible suspect.</TE>
<TE>   Now, in the far superior "City of Bones," the Dark Knight returns,
determined as ever to work a case his own way despite the jackals
from Internal Affairs and the weasels upstairs, hands down the
villains we most love to hate in all the Bosch books. As usual, his
investigation threatens to embarrass the department (but a whole lot
less than the real LAPD has been embarrassed lately by real
corruption scandals), and the brass warns him to lay off. And, as
usual, the more they want to cover up, the deeper Bosch, a former
Vietnam tunnel rat, is going to dig. Think Dirty Harry.</TE>
<TE>   This time he's after the truth behind the 20-year-old murder of a
missing child whose bones are discovered in Laurel Canyon. (Cops,
we're told, call a crime scene like this a "city of bones.") Cases
don't get much colder, unless you count the prehistoric homicide
revealed by bones which, we learn, bubbled up 88 years ago in the La
Brea Tar Pits. But for Harry--like the crime writer James Ellroy,
whose mother was murdered when he was a child--it's personal enough
to become an obsession, or so we need to believe to buy his rage over
a crime committed so long ago.</TE>
<TE>   As the story unwinds, we are treated to enough forensic details to
fill a TV season of "CSIs," along with an E-ticket ride through the
city and its environs. Like all the best modern crime writers--South
Boston's Dennis Lehane, South Florida's Carl Hiaasen, Washington,
D.C.'s George P. Pelecanos, Louisiana's James Lee Burke, Manhattan's
Lawrence Block--Connelly is strong on place, and Los Angeles, cast as
a modern version of the original Bosch's underworld, may be his
second favorite continuing character.</TE>
<TE>   Here, the twisty investigation starts on Lookout Mountain and with
time out for vodka martinis at Musso and Frank, beef dip sandwiches
at Philippe's and Bob's doughnuts from the Farmers Market, proceeds
to Hancock Park, Parker Center downtown, the tar pits, Venice, the
Miracle Mile, Van Nuys, Palm Springs and the foothills of the Sierra
Nevada before winding up in a flophouse off Hollywood Boulevard. On
the way, ugly truths are uncovered leading to new deaths, not to
mention a damaged partnership, the introduction of a new and
dangerous woman in Bosch's life and more that's not going to be
revealed here.</TE>
<TE>   Enough to say this is strong Connelly: well-plotted, lean and
spare and more than a little sad, without the forced endings and
heavy-handed symbolism that mar some of his earlier books. The search
for truth leading to unintended consequences is a cautionary theme
that has worked since Sophocles, and it works here.</TE>
<TE>   We may miss the rich complexity of "The Black Echo," his stunning
1994 debut, or of "The Poet," his most compelling non-series mystery.
But in the end, "City of Bones" has Bosch, and we continue to care
for him. He is still a man we'd choose to fight for us, a believable
incarnation of Chandler's modern knight-errant whom we are left
hoping has not morphed irreversibly into a post-modern knight-Arendt,
overwhelmed by the sheer banality of evil and the utter futility of
trying to set things right.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   From `City of Bones'</TE>
<TE>   Bosch stepped over to the stainless steel table. The bones were
laid out in place so as to form a partial skeleton. The most obvious
pieces missing were the bones of the left arm and leg and the lower
jaw. It was presumed that these were the pieces that had long ago
been taken and scattered distantly by animals that had rooted in the
shallow grave ....</TE>
<TE>   "Bones can tell us much about how a person lived and died,"
Golliher said somberly. "In cases of child abuse, the bones do not
lie. The bones become our final evidence."</TE>
<TE>   Bosch looked back at him and realized his eyes were not dark. They
actually were blue but they were deeply set and seemed haunted in
some way. He was staring past Bosch at the bones on the table. After
a moment he broke from this reverie and looked at Bosch.</TE>
<TE>   "Let me start by saying that we are learning quite a bit from the
recovered artifacts," the anthropologist said. "But I have to tell
you guys, I've consulted on a lot of cases but this one blows me
away. I was looking at these bones and taking notes and I looked down
and my notebook was smeared. I was crying, man. I was crying and I

<HD>Casting Lines in Search of Meaning</HD>
<DH>NEVER: Poems By Jorie Graham, Ecco Press: 114 pages, $22.95</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN PALATTELLA</AU>
<BD>John Palattella writes for several publications,
including the London Review of Books, the Nation and Dissent.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For the epigraph of her new book of poems, Jorie Graham has snatched
two terse sentences from the letters of John Keats. In 1818, Keats
went on a walking tour of Scotland and northern England. "How can I
believe in that?" he wrote upon first seeing the Lake District, the
home of Wordsworth and Coleridge and the wellspring of the Romantic
Sublime. "Surely it cannot be?" Graham's choice of these sentences is
apt, for "Never" teems not only with questions of belief but also
with a sense of astonishment that the physical world exists at all.</LD>
<LD>   "Never" is Graham's eighth book. It would be more accurate,
however, to call the volume the eighth episode of Graham's quest for
absolute meaning and wholeness, one that has routinely led her down a
path mired in human imperfections. Foremost among these hazards are
consciousness, which can know itself only by exposing itself to an
elusive physical world, and language, which in her previous book,
"Swarm," Graham called a system "built on forgetting word by word how
life/feels." In this respect, the presiding spirit of "Never" is not
Keats or even John Ashbery, whose coruscating, quicksilver poems have
often intrigued Graham. Rather, as with Graham's other books, it is
T.S. Eliot, an idealist whose poetic protagonists are bruised by
their failure to pierce the veil of time to a radiant spiritual
absolute.</LD>
<TE>   Divided into five sections, "Never" attempts to enact an acutely
mental drama, and the crucial scenes occur while Graham is pondering
the sea. In the poems "Evolution I," "Gulls," "Dusk Shore Prayer,"
"The Complex Mechanism of the Break," "Ebbtide" and, most important,
"The Time Being," the ocean is Graham's antithesis and ideal. It is a
roiling fluid mass, the "residue of origin" that both defies
description and tempts Graham to construe it as a model of
expression:</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes the whole unraveling activity</TE>
<TE>   for just an instant</TE>
<TE>   pools, all its opposing motions suddenly just pattern on these
briefly</TE>
<TE>   lakelike flats--the shore's upslant unspooling then in only two
dimensions.</TE>
<TE>   Accordingly, Graham tries to establish a correspondence between
the forms of her verse and the shape of the sea. The poems are a
surf-scrim of periods, dashes and colons; cuts, reversals and
fragmentations; bracketed phrases, parentheses and parentheticals
nested within bracketed phrases. Graham wants the sea to make her
voice most acute at its unraveling.</TE>
<TE>   But there is a nagging problem with the sea poems and with "Never"
in general. At times the sea is a metaphor that overstays its
welcome, operating more like a narrow intellectual conceit than a
door to a more acutely felt world. As for the poems in general, the
problem is not their philosophical cast of mind, because in a poetry
world thick with emotional platitudes, a poetry of ideas is always
welcome. Nor is it their formal difficulty, because difficulty is
inherently neither good or bad, reactionary or revolutionary. The
problem is that the poems are maddeningly abstract, their language
defiantly knotty yet remarkably staid. Graham liberally uses scare
quotes (quotation marks around questionable words), some buzzwords of
academic postmodernism ("speaking subject," "self-presence") and
compound predicates fused by hyphens and back-slashes
("finally-arriving-boat-wakes," "mind/gaze"). All language is
abstract, but Graham seems determined to push its abstraction to its
baroque-breaking-point.</TE>
<TE>   Given the severity and willfulness of Graham's abstraction, one
wonders if she is determined less to find a language adequate to her
vision of the sea's "supreme unfolding" than to demonstrate that all
language is unfit for her visionary quest. Throughout "Never," Graham
returns to the notion of silence, that unsullied space between her
elliptical clutches of words: "Everything depends on the point where
nothing can be said," she writes emphatically in "Via Negativa."
What's especially telling is that while "Never" is riddled with
doubts about comprehension and eloquence--</TE>
<TE>   Understands? Shall I wave a 'finished' copy at you</TE>
<TE>   whispering do you wish to come for lunch.</TE>
<TE>   Nor do I want to dwell on this</TE>
<TE>   --Graham does not refrain from dwelling on the unambiguous value
of silence. From "In/Silence":</TE>
<TE>   Because the truth</TE>
<TE>   is a thing one is not permitted to say.</TE>
<TE>   That is preserved for silence,</TE>
<TE>   a buttress in silence's flyings, its motions</TE>
<TE>   always away from source.</TE>
<TE>   From "Where: The Person": "after which silence tumbling down as if
a birdsong without/song."</TE>
<TE>   In "Soul Says," the concluding poem of her celebrated 1993 volume
"Region of Unlikeness," Graham approvingly depicts Prospero's
decision to doff his magic robe and assume a less assured role:</TE>
<TE>   O pluck my magic garment from me. So.</TE>
<TE>   [lays down his robe]</TE>
<TE>   Lie there my art....</TE>
<TE>   Graham's encomiums to silence in "Never" are uttered in the spirit
of Prospero's renunciation of his powers, but it is an alliance that
raises a crucial question. How soon will Graham's desire to speak an
unspeakable absolute lead her to meditate on the only true poetic
equal of silence, the empty page?</TE>

<LD>THE LETO BUNDLE</LD>
<LD>   By Marina Warner</LD>
<LD>   Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux:</LD>
<TE>   408 pp., $26</TE>
<TE>   All too often, the weary author leans heavily on the plot, the
infrastructure of a novel. The plot gives structure and momentum to
the story, but the story is more than the sum of the novel's parts:
plot, characters, language. The story is all that is uncontrollable
and controllable about writing. The story lives in the author's
imagination, a whirling combination of fact, inspiration and fantasy
that sometimes disobeys its creator.</TE>
<TE>   Marina Warner did not cower in the face of her complicated story,
though in parts she is clearly daunted by it. A middle-aged museum
curator, Hetty, is put in charge of a sarcophagus that contains no
body, only bits of manuscript, amulets, shards and scraps of cloth,
with an 1,800-year-old cartouche that depicts a beautiful woman,
about 28 years old. These fragments, known as the Leto bundle,
inspire a group of followers, led by a young man, Kim, a visionary
whose medium is the Web, to start a movement called History Begins
With Us.</TE>
<TE>   Leto is the name of a Greek goddess who, in legend, is raped by
Zeus and gives birth to twins: Apollo and Artemis. Abandoned by Zeus,
they take shelter for three years with wolves. Leto does not die. She
lives through the ages to the present in several incarnations (each
with different names): as a stowaway on a ship, as a slave and as a
cleaning lady in a war-torn modern-day city.</TE>
<TE>   The story weaves around the fragments in the sarcophagus (there is
no body because she is immortal), as the curator and the visionary
try to piece Leto's story together. Warner reveals more the pagan
heart than the statuesque classicism of the ancient Greek gods. Some
of the novel is told in e-mails between Kim and Hetty, a form that is
much less compelling than Warner's storytelling. "The Leto Bundle" is
a novel as ambitious and thrilling as Isabel Allende's "The House of
the Spirits" in its weaving of the past and the present, intuition
and academia, fact and fantasy.</TE>

<TE>   SMALL WONDER</TE>
<TE>   Essays</TE>
<TE>   By Barbara Kingsolver</TE>
<TE>   HarperCollins: 270 pp., $23.95</TE>
<TE>   "Small changes, small wonders--these are the currency of my
endurance and ultimately of my life," explains Barbara Kingsolver in
the title essay of this collection. "It's a workable economy." In the
tradition of Wendell Berry and all those who went before him, from
Scott Nearing to E.F. Schumacher, Kingsolver describes and defends a
way of life, her way of life, that she believes can give us all that
is missing--spiritually, physiologically and economically--from
modern-day life and, in the process, slow the destruction of the
Earth. "I invest my heart's desire and the work of my hands in things
that will outlive me," she writes of writing, gardening and
child-rearing. She describes some of the choices involved, living in
a sustainable manner that is respectful of and closer to nature: from
her daughter's choice not to move a hermit crab from a beautiful
shell she finds on the beach to the difficulty of eating animals
without ever looking them in the eye.</TE>
<TE>   In the essays written after Sept. 11, Kingsolver describes America
as the world's "Fat Brother," full of "prideful wastefulness." She
writes of issues such as preserving genetic diversity and of the
importance of scientific literacy to the environmental movement. She
writes a letter to her mother and one to her 13-year-old daughter.
She writes about writing: stories versus novels, poetry versus
fiction and the joy of writing about sex. She writes about her two
homes: in a hollow in southern Appalachia and in a bosque in Arizona.
Luckily, from time to time, she makes fun of her own tendency to
preach. Humor and earnestness can be found here.</TE>

<TE>   ALCOHOL</TE>
<TE>   The World's Favorite Drug</TE>
<TE>   By Griffith Edwards</TE>
<TE>   St. Martin's Press: 230 pp., $23.95</TE>
<TE>   "Alcohol" is a book with a message: Alcohol is a dangerous drug.
Griffith Edwards moves quickly from molecules to morals, describing
everything from the chemical composition of alcohol, to its many uses
throughout history, to the laws created to control it, the
realization in the medical community that alcoholism is a disease and
the institutions created to help those suffering from that disease.
He considers the links between alcohol and breast cancer and
cirrhosis of the liver, but spends too little time on current
research. He is more interested in preventing the abuse of alcohol:
"Society needs to put in place a range of external measures to
support healthy drinking choices and to make excess less likely," he
writes. But coming at the end of such a brief history of man's
efforts to control this particular addiction, this warning seems a
bit feeble. One is more struck by our need for escape from reality
than by our choice of poison.</TE>

<DH>SPECIAL PROVIDENCE: American Foreign Policy and How It
Changed the World, By Walter Russell Mead, Alfred A. Knopf: 378 pp.,
$30</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID RIEFF</AU>
<BD>David Rieff is the author of Slaughterhouse: Bosnia and
the West" and the forthcoming "A Bed for the Night: Humanitarianism
in Crisis." He is a contributing writer to Book Review.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The title of Walter Russell Mead's long-awaited reinterpretation of
the entire course of American foreign policy since the founding of
the Republic is derived from the sarcastic observation usually
attributed to Otto von Bismarck: "God has a special providence for
fools, drunks, and the United States of America." It is not that Mead
agrees with the 19th century German chancellor. To the contrary,
"Special Providence" derives much of its intellectual force and
originality from Mead's indignation over the fact that not only have
foreign observers--from Bismarck to Charles de Gaulle--wrongly
concluded that the United States has never had a foreign policy
worthy of the name but that, even more important, many if not most
Americans have joined in what he calls this "wholesale dismissal of
the country's foreign policy traditions."</LD>
<LD>   Mead is keen to set the record straight. His book is an
impassioned effort to debunk the view of such American Bismarckians
as Henry Kissinger, who once wrote that "America's journey through
international relations has been a triumph of faith over experience."
Mead is equally dismissive of the assumptions of an American liberal
establishment that has tended to reduce the country's foreign policy
debate to a straightforward quarrel pitting idealists like
themselves, isolationists and realists like Kissinger against one
another.</LD>
<TE>   For Mead, the reality has been both more complex and more
interesting. Far from being a story of muddling through, merely
reaping the benefits of benign geography or even sheer dumb luck,
American foreign policy has been "more successful than the
conventional wisdom acknowledges, [and] has played a much more
central role throughout American history than many Americans
believe."</TE>
<TE>   In fact, Mead goes much further. He is convinced that the United
States' rise to global preeminence over the course of the last 200
years was produced in very large measure by what might be called a
peculiarly American way of foreign policy. If its advantages have
failed to be understood or appreciated, Mead argues, this is because
the template for thinking about international relations has been that
of continental Europe. However, while it may have made sense for a
Bismarck or a Napoleon to see foreign relations through the prism of
traditional military security preoccupations, given the geostrategic
realities a France or a Germany faced, it makes no sense in the
American context. And in any case, given America's extraordinary
success, Mead asks almost plaintively, why should the American
approach, which was, historically, to emphasize money and trade, be
viewed as in any way inferior?</TE>
<TE>   Mead's early 21st century effort to manumit the American foreign
policy tradition from its thralldom to a more prestigious but less
effective European model is oddly reminiscent of the attempt of 19th
century American writers or 20th century American musicians to free
their arts from blind subservience to Old World models. Perhaps
inevitably, this at times leads Mead to paint a picture of such
transcendent American success as to flirt dangerously with the
jingoistic.</TE>
<TE>   Mead is conscious of this danger, writing defensively in his
introduction that "Special Providence" should not be interpreted as a
"triumphalist" work. But though it is in many ways a remarkable
accomplishment and is never less than thought-provoking, the book is
marred precisely by a certain triumphalist tone. Mead may have used
the Bismarck quote about a special providence ironically, but his
chapter on the future of American foreign policy opens with the quite
unironic assertion that "the special providence shaping American
policy for success bore the fingerprints of Adam Smith's invisible
hand."</TE>
<TE>   Because Mead is rightly convinced that many of the most important
tendencies in American foreign policy can be traced to the Founding
Fathers--above all to Jefferson, Hamilton and John Adams--and because
the thought of Adam Smith pervades so much of early American
political thought, there is nothing particularly controversial about
this ascription of influence. What is troubling is Mead's
glorification of America's rise to power. It is not that one wants
him to be a revisionist or to have produced the diplomatic
historian's equivalent of "Bury My Heart at Wounded Knee." But Mead's
argument would carry more weight had his historical evocation of the
U.S. rise to global hegemony been more inflected with a tragic sense
of history.</TE>
<TE>   After all, Balzac's insight that "behind every fortune lies a
great crime" applies as much if not more to states as to private
wealth, and one might have thought that a thinker as knowledgeable
and skeptical of received wisdom as Mead would have more readily
shouldered the burden of darkening the picture of America's rise by
more extensive references to both the genocide of the native peoples
of North America and the peculiar institution of slavery.</TE>
<TE>   This moral lapse is particularly frustrating because Mead's
template for understanding the American foreign policy tradition
consists of schools of thought that he characterizes as Hamiltonian,
Jeffersonian, Jacksonian and Wilsonian. It is a useful approach that
allows Mead, as he chronicles the ways in which these four traditions
have been in opposition but have also complemented one another, to
offer an original synthesis of U.S. foreign policy. And yet at the
very least, one might have hoped that Jefferson's identity as a
slaveholder and Jackson's always brutal and sometimes genocidal
campaigns against various Indian tribes would have seemed more
germane to Mead than they seem to have.</TE>
<TE>   In fairness, he acknowledges them. But he dismisses anxieties
about what he calls the "Jacksonian record of racism," insisting
that, in Jacksonian America, "the belief that color is no bar to
membership in [its] community of honor is advancing rapidly." And
about the relationship between Jeffersonianism and slaveholding, Mead
is even more discreet, contenting himself with the remark that while
"Jefferson could write the Declaration of Independence and hold
slaves, the ideas that he unleashed have gone beyond him."</TE>
<TE>   The problem here is twofold. Mead is of course correct in
insisting that ideas evolve and, though he might have made more of an
explicit effort to do so, his argument that both the Jacksonian and
the Jeffersonian traditions of American political thought are rich
and worthy and can in no sense be reduced to their worst attributes
is unquestionably correct. Where the first difficulty arises is that
if these schools have mutated so profoundly--particularly in the case
of the Jacksonian tradition--is not Mead's entire taxonomy itself
open to question? In other words, calling something Jeffersonian or
Jacksonian or Hamiltonian or Wilsonian but then saying that in effect
the men in question would either not have recognized or else might
have rejected many of the directions their traditions had taken has a
somewhat forced quality about it. Are there really four traditions in
American thought on international relations, or is it simply a
convenient way for Mead to summarize a far more complicated
historical reality?</TE>
<TE>   It is not reassuring to see that, appropriately enough, Mead is
obliged to present a series of complicating divisions within each of
the four schools as well as to anatomize the overlaps between them.
For at that point, the reader begins to wonder whether Mead's
categorization is an aid to understanding or an impediment to it. At
the very least, it seems to lead Mead to oversimplify. And in the
end, in the brief prescriptive coda to his book, Mead, while largely
aligning himself with a kind of wised-up, desentimentalized
Jeffersonianism, insists that "there is no school whose perspectives
we can afford to lose."</TE>
<TE>   He insists that the Hamiltonians and Jeffersonians are right about
the U.S. having global interests and duties but that their solutions
are sometimes rash. The Jeffersonians, he says, are correct in
fearing international overreach. He is less taken with the policy
prescriptions of the Jacksonians but insists that their "cultural,
social, and religious vibrancy and unorthodoxy is one of the
country's most important foreign policy assets."</TE>
<TE>   Mead may be right on all these points. The question that he
neither poses rigorously enough nor answers satisfactorily is whether
the new synthesis that would draw on these strains in American
political thought that he recommends is actually possible or,
instead, whether the four schools are so intertwined as to be largely
indistinguishable to anyone but the historian of ideas. It would be
one thing had Mead simply written a book of intellectual history that
sought to revalidate America's conduct of its foreign policy. But, by
his own admission, the project's scope goes far beyond that.</TE>
<TE>   "The United States," he writes at the end of his book, "needs a
grand strategy that is rooted in the concrete interests of the
American people, that respects and serves their moral values, and
that at the lowest possible cost in blood, treasure, and political
concentration of power secures their lives, their fortunes, and their
sacred honor."</TE>
<TE>   And indeed, it does; though in fairness, about what democratic
nation or people could this not be said? But it is not just that, in
his more grandiloquent moments, Mead tends to revel so heedlessly in
the rhetoric of American exceptionalism as to provoke anxiety at
least in anyone who remembers the Prophet Isaiah's words about
princes, power and vanity.</TE>
<TE>   The more immediate difficulty is that Mead's vision is one in
which, in effect, four schools of thought, each valuable in its own
way, can be harnessed to make the American future as bright as its
past. Assume Mead's contention is correct that all four schools have
in the past contributed to the success of what he rightly calls the
American foreign policy system. This hardly means they will be
reconcilable in the same way in the future.</TE>
<TE>   It is here that the intellectual danger of Mead's taxonomy really
becomes apparent. He is a brilliant scholar, and he has produced a
book of enduring value as both a work of intellectual genealogy and a
stimulating reevaluation of some of the roots of America's rise. But
the obverse is that Mead's essentially irenic account of American
history, manifested, above all, by the absence of its tragic
dimension from the pages of "Special Providence," leads him to gloss
over the possibility that these ideas may not always be
complementary. The post-Sept. 11 debate over security versus rights
is only one early manifestation of how important and worthy ideas can
be inimical to one another.</TE>
<TE>   And Mead writes as if he assumes that the American past really is
a good guide to the American future. But while it would be reassuring
to believe this, it is by no means clear that this is the case. The
reason is simple: The policy debates of the last 200 years that Mead
anatomizes took place at a time when the nation-state was preeminent.
And yet surely it is anything but clear whether even a country as
powerful as the United States has the power to determine its own
future in terms of its own political traditions in a world where,
from migration policy to financial flows to environmental issues,
most problems and most solutions are transnational. Will America be
the exception in this way too? Mead often writes as if the answer is
clearly yes, but that hardly seems likely.</TE>

<LD>Even the most distracted visitor to the former Yugoslavia would
notice the posters. I know I did. On the streets of Slobodan
Milosevic's Belgrade, they were ubiquitous. If you did not know the
faces they depicted or the Cyrillic-lettered words emblazoned across
them, you could not always tell if they were the handiwork of
fascists or of anti-fascist activists. Maybe you felt uncomfortable
looking at them. But you were compelled to. Maybe you needn't be
frightened. But they made you shudder. The colors were aggressive.
The imagery was iconic and urgent. Whole walls were plastered with
multiple copies of a single one.</LD>
<LD>   Americans are not used to visual political propaganda of this
nature. Bosnians, Croats and Serbs have been bombarded with it since
the wars of the Yugoslav succession. Born of a powerful tradition of
socialist poster art (associated above all with postwar Poland), the
Yugoslav posters are stark, sophisticated and searing. Some of them
stoke rage and fear; others portray solidarity and hope. Almost all
of them play on words and symbols with wicked wit.</LD>
<LD>   Of all the posters that came out of Yugoslavia's last 10 years,
those chronicling the pain and aguish of Bosnia from 1992 to 1995
have a chilling poignancy.</LD>
<TE>   From posters that appeared in Bosnia during the war, Daoud
Sarhandi and Alina Boboc have constructed a beautiful and terrifying
book. Most of those they gathered are the work of Bosnian Muslims.
Some are political: They urge young men to enlist; they equate
Serbian nationalism with Nazism; they implore the international
community to intervene. Others are elegiac: They memorialize the lost
lives, the shattered cities, the country dismembered.</TE>
<TE>   The most devastating, however, are the posters that give voice,
color and shape to the hopes many Bosnians nurtured.</TE>
<TE>   "Evil Doesn't Live Here" takes its title from a defiant 1992
poster Sarhandi found in Tuzla. One reaches it after leafing through
page after page of bullet holes, demolished buildings and portents of
fascism. Then there is a sketch of the multiethnic city of Tuzla;
above it, the words of the book's title.</TE>
<TE>   If you know nothing about the Bosnian war, "Evil Doesn't Live
Here" makes a superb primer. That was not Sarhandi's and Boboc's
intention. But Sarhandi's introduction provides one of the best
overviews of the conflict's history to be found anywhere. His
captions lightly but expertly guide even a completely uninitiated
reader through symbolism and events of great weight and complexity.</TE>
<TE>   And then there are the posters. Through them we experience, nearly
unmediated, the power of propaganda and the emotional resonance of
political art in times of terror. The posters speak to us as though
we were there--as though we might enlist or resist, as though we were
neighbors and not strangers a world and a decade away.</TE>

<CP>PHOTO: Upper left: "In Istanbul the Core, the Myth Is
Evermore" by Began Turbic (Tuzla, 1992). The book is titled "History,
Culture, and Tradition of the Serbs." The poster suggests that a hole
will be left behind if all traces of Turkish influence are removed
from Serbia.</CP>

<CP>PHOTO: "Together" by Adin Sadic (Tuzla, 1992). Sadic, a
Bosnian Muslim fighter in the Tuzla region, produced this image in
1992. He was a member of the Black Swans, an elite fighting force
made up of Croats and Muslims. Sadic drew this picture before the
Croat-Muslim split, which led to a tripartite war in Bosnia among
Serbs, Croats and Muslims. The red-and-white helmet in the colors of
the Croatian flag signifies Bosnia's Croats. Bosnia is represented by
the blue-and-white fleurs-de-lis. At the beginning of the war, there
was genuine optimism that Serb expansionism in Bosnia could be
defeated through the combined efforts of Bosnia's Croats and Muslims.
In Herzegovina and central Bosnia, however, this hope was
short-lived. In 1993, Franjo Tudjman, the president of Croatia,
decided to annex Herzegovina and the Croatian Defense Council was
ordered to attack its Muslim allies.</CP>

<CP>PHOTO: "Enjoy Sarajevo" by TRIO (Sarajevo, 1992-93). TRIO is
run by Bojan and Dada Hadzihalilovic, a Sarajevo-based
husband-and-wife team who have produced a series of internationally
famous images. TRIO's most renowned images are 40 postcards, all
redesigns of well-known images. One of the most famous used the
Coca-Cola logo. TRIO used the postcard format for a number of
reasons. At the time of the postcard's production, Sarajevo had been
under siege for more than a year and a half, and there was little
paper or ink in the city. TRIO also wanted a product that could be
sent out of the city easily, in order to communicate with as many
people as possible in the outside world. This particular poster was,
ironically, printed on an old Yugoslav People's Army map because of
chronic paper shortages.</CP>

<CP>PHOTO: "1984 SARAJEVO 1994" by TRIO (Sarajevo, 1994). This
postcard marks the tenth anniversary of the Winter Olympics. Two
years before this card was produced, Sarajevo's Olympic Museum was
hit by incendiary shells and burned to the ground along with all its
artifacts.</CP>

<CP>PHOTO: Upper right: "Stop Milosevic" by Began Turbic (Tuzla,
1992). In this poster an inverted hand making a traditional Serb
salute is transformed into a hooded, ax-wielding killer. The eye and
mouth holes of the hood form the letters SDS in Cyrillic, which
stands for Srpska Demokratska Stranka, the Bosnian Serb political
party that was supported by Slobodan Milosevic and led by Radovan
Karadzic. The positioning of the fingers signifies the trinity in the
Serb Orthodox church. It is also commonly used as a sign for victory
by Serb soldiers, much as British and American troops use the
two-fingered "V" sign. In Bosnia, it became a hated symbol of Serb
military aggression.</CP>

<HD>The Quare Fellow</HD>
<DH>The Life and Times of Brendan Behan, Dublin's Most Famous
Forgotten Son</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CLANCY SIGAL</AU>
<BD>Clancy Sigal is the author of "Going Away" and "The
Secret Defector" and is a screenwriter.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Brendan Behan, the bad boy of modern Irish letters, was good copy.
Journalists like myself fed off him, fed him drinks and then fed him
to our editors. At our (and his) worst, we led him around like a
trained bear, into the pubs that were killing him and onto
transatlantic TV talk shows where, on cue, he performed as the
outrageous drunken "paddy" who could write his fool head off in
private and in public make a fall-down sloppy buffoon of himself. At
the peak of his popularity, in the early 1960s, he gave audiences a
caricature of an Irishman, free with his sex and curses, and a
prodigy with the English language. Like the Welsh poet Dylan Thomas,
he lived down to our expectations everywhere except at the writing
table.</LD>
<LD>   Brendan Behan was a serious literary craftsman on a near-equal
footing with his contemporary (and mentor) Samuel Beckett. In his
best-known plays, "The Quare Fellow" and "The Hostage"--both
originally written in Gaelic--he was an Irish Brecht in his inventive
use of music, song and irony. He wrote one of the finest of all
prison memoirs, the touching and forceful "Borstal Boy," now a film
by Peter Sheridan. His wickedly funny crime novel, "The Scarperer,"
is as good as anything by Frank or Malachy McCourt. And his short
stories, collected in "Hold Your Hour and Have Another" and "After
the Wake," are first rate.</LD>
<TE>   As an IRA terrorist, Behan had blown up things and tried to kill
people. The son of a politically conscious Dublin house painter, he
was an IRA message carrier by 9. At 13 he was arrested on a sabotage
mission, attempting to blow up a battleship in Liverpool harbor, and
sentenced to three years in Borstal, an English reform school, the
period covered in Sheridan's film. Later, he was sent to an adult
prison, the notorious Mountjoy, and served another jail term for
helping an IRA prisoner to escape. What great copy!</TE>
<TE>   In 1962 my editor, David Astor, publisher of the liberal Sunday
newspaper the Observer, sent me to Ireland on a double mission: to
cajole Behan into entering detox in England (to be paid for by
Astor), or, if that failed, to catch for posterity his dying words.
The week I spent with him in Dublin, at his Ballsbridge home and
making the lethal rounds at Jury's, Bailey's, the Dolphin, Davy
Burns--up and down the bars of Pearl Street--was brutally alcoholic,
phantasmagoric and, for me, unforgettable. Everyone, including Behan,
knew he was dying--of diabetes and liver and life itself--and some
were impatient that he was taking such a God almighty long time at
it. He wasn't 40 yet.</TE>
<TE>   Huge, sprawling, disheveled, a large cigarette burn squarely in
the back of his new Irish-export tweed suit, his white shirt streaked
with dirt and spotted with faded bloodstains down the front, the tops
of his suspendered trousers reaching almost to the barrel-like chest,
his yellowish drink-splotched face showing several days' growth of
rough reddened beard, he looked the very stereotype of burned-out
roaring boy from the heart of working-class Dublin. Wherever we went
in Dublin, him wheezing and coughing and spitting blood into a
handkerchief, he seemed to know everybody. Old school friends,
booze-up pals, IRA comrades, hangers-on, admirers and ex-lovers
surrounded him on every street, in every pub, feeding him whiskey,
bits of sly gossip, slyer malice, thumps on the back and ...
always--always--more Jameson's whiskey.</TE>
<TE>   Once, when I suggested to him that perhaps his friends were easing
his passage to the grave prematurely, he turned his sad behemoth's
shattered gaze on me and said, "It's obvious you're not Irish despite
your name. All this"--he waved his hand at the pub mob around us
waiting for him to crumple or fight or do something wicked--"it's a
form of mercy, don't you see?"</TE>
<TE>   Then the surprises came.</TE>
<TE>   As the drink seeped into him, and I thought he'd probably die in
my arms, he became something more than a self-destructive clown.
Death staring him in the face didn't exactly sober him. What could?
(I actually attended, in his Ballsbridge bedroom, Behan's wake for
himself where he sadly greeted the mourners filing in to pay their
respects.) But, temporarily relieved of the duty of playing a "local
character," of dying so publicly, he revealed a gentler, more
vulnerable man who had "gone beyond," into a melancholy, meditative
place.</TE>
<TE>   He was, I believe, first and foremost a political poet. But now,
near the end, he was transcending his own history. At the core of his
large and difficult heart, he'd gone from being a man of war,
reprisal and revenge to being a man of peace and reconciliation and
no quick answers. I've rarely seen this except in veteran combat
soldiers--or political operatives--who evolve into something like
conscientious objection to violence.</TE>
<TE>   As we sat in the shade of a leafy tree on a bench opposite
Mountjoy prison, to which he'd been sent for attempting to murder two
Dublin detectives, he mused, "You wouldn't think to look at me I'd
been a gunman. Hard to believe it myself." He belched. "I don't know.
As I grow older I like parliaments, democratic parliaments, more than
'clean up.' You know what I mean by 'clean up'?" He used his big
paw--a house painter's hand--as a token knife to cut his throat.
Earlier we'd run into his old IRA commanding officer, now an
insurance executive, who had reminisced how disinclined to military
discipline Behan always had been. Behan gave a little laugh. "Left
and right in the IRA, they didn't get along. If we'd won against the
English, you'd have seen a bloody civil war after that."</TE>
<TE>   Behan's prophetic musing outside Mountjoy long predated the IRA
internal quarrels pitting factions against split-offs in a dizzying
and continuing bath of blood.</TE>
<TE>   Catholicism--rebellious, critical and in the end forbearing--was
incredibly important to Behan. He had been raised in a family culture
of revolutionary piety. (His grandmother displayed pictures of the
bishop of Dublin and Karl Marx on her wall.) In our pub trawls, he
kept going back to his religion.</TE>
<TE>   "I suppose," he said, "I'm still a Catholic of a sort. Not when
I'm feeling all right, but when I think it's closing down [for me]."
In the hospital the previous month, he had let a priest anoint him
when he thought he was on the point of death. "I think the younger
clergy like me. A nun asked to have her picture taken with me
alongside. So I don't think I've been excommunicated. Yet."</TE>
<TE>   Behan was a man in conflict: with his violent past, his religion,
his sexuality. While he remained devoted to his IRA comrades, who
clustered around him like magpies, buying or cadging drinks on our
rounds, he reassuring them in every way he knew that he wasn't
getting above himself, he was still one of them, I think they sensed
that he was traveling a wholly different road.</TE>
<TE>   His primary loyalty then was to himself as a writer, even if that
conflicted with everything, including a bred-in-the-bone Catholic
nationalism he had gone to jail for. "The principal responsibility of
the writer," he insisted, "is to let his own country down with a
great big and beautiful bang." He loved Ireland unsentimentally. "Oh,
a very rich, very ancient culture. And no damn health scheme."</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps he was less an Irishman than a Dubliner. He couldn't live
in Dublin, and he couldn't live without it. It may be a literary
town, but it's also packed to the slate roofs with active, poisonous
envy and malice, bilious star worship all mixed up with spite, for
anyone with writing talent. Perhaps in this way it's not so very
different from London and New York, where Behan was lionized and
patronized simultaneously. One old IRA pal, leaning against a bar at
Davy Jones', scrutinized the large, flubby, grizzled, blustery,
immensely sad and funny man almost collapsed on the floor and said,
"Look at him. He always has to come back to us, doesn't he? He'll
never get away, you know, because we made him what he is."</TE>
<TE>   I last saw Behan in a bed at Central Middlesex hospital in London.
Despite the efforts of David Astor, his friends and his great play
producer, Joan Littlewood, a constant visitor at his bedside, he
wasn't to last much longer. He was 41 when he died in 1964. He's
buried, at home, in Dublin's Glasvenin cemetery.</TE>
<TE>   Before we separated, he to Killarney, me back to London, he raised
his glass in what he wryly called his last message to the world:</TE>
<TE>   Health and life to you,</TE>
<TE>   Land without rent to you,</TE>
<TE>   The woman of your desire you,</TE>
<TE>   A child every year to you--</TE>
<TE>   Married or single</TE>
<TE>   A stout heart, a wet gob</TE>
<TE>   And may the hair on your bollocks grow as long as the</TE>
<TE>   Beard on a goat.</TE>

<HD>Up Against His Own Deadline</HD>
<DH>Even as a teen filmmaker, Shane Salerno was impatient to
advance. It's the same now that he's an action-film writer.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KEVIN BRASS</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In 1991, an earnest 18-year-old in a conservative blue suit and red
tie bantered on national TV with Larry King.</LD>
<LD>   "I want to make films about the things no one is making films
about, like rape and suburban drugs," said Shane Salerno, who was on
the show promoting his public-access documentary, "Sundown: The
Future of Children and Drugs."</LD>
<LD>   Salerno billed the program, a collection of videotaped interviews
he shot while in high school, as a "suburban 'Boyz N the Hood.'" A
profile of Salerno in the Los Angeles Times then noted that reporters
interested in the Encinitas teenager were likely to receive 50-page
press kits explaining his views on drugs, crime and teen culture,
plus letters of endorsement from Pete Wilson and other politicians.</LD>
<TE>   A little more than 10 years later, sitting in his West L.A.
office, Salerno sounds like the idealistic 18-year-old when he
reflects on the interview on Larry King's show as a "major thing."
With the same earnestness, he recalls the moment two years later when
he decided making documentaries about rape and drugs was no longer
enough: "I went to my mom and said, words to the effect, if we don't
go to L.A. now, I'm going to end up in San Diego making documentaries
for PBS and I want to do more than that."</TE>
<TE>   What happened to Salerno is the stuff of Hollywood fable. Without
relatives in the industry, big-money friends or a Sundance pedigree,
the kid voted Most Likely to Be Famous by his high school classmates
quickly vaulted into the top echelons of the film industry, working
with the likes of Steven Spielberg, Ron Howard and Michael Mann. By
age 24, he was simultaneously developing projects for Spielberg and
Sylvester Stallone. His first on-screen credits were 1998's
"Armageddon" (adaptation) and 2000's "Shaft" (story and screenplay).
At 28, he was the co-creator and executive producer of his own TV
series, "UC: Undercover."</TE>
<TE>   Ten years after he exchanged quips with King, Salerno is an
established screenwriter and producer, with a seven-figure "first
look" deal with Jersey Films and a development deal with 20th Century
Fox Television. Even in a town with jaded response to rags-to-riches
stories, Salerno's rise evokes respect.</TE>
<TE>   "He reminds me of Francis Ford Coppola, in terms of his enthusiasm
and his grandiosity, in thinking big," said Tony Bill, a veteran
Hollywood actor and producer who directed two episodes of "UC:
Undercover."</TE>
<TE>   Growing up in San Diego, Salerno was often compared to the
ambitious Michael J. Fox character on the sitcom "Family Ties": a
straight-laced conservative teen in a world of hippie adults. Dressed
in black sports jacket and blue jeans, he still has the clean-cut
appearance and a consistently sober expression.</TE>
<TE>   Salerno doesn't fit many Hollywood stereotypes. He says he's never
smoked a cigarette, tasted a drop of alcohol or experimented with
drugs--in part, a reaction to "Sundown," he says.</TE>
<TE>   "He's my straight man when we go out," said director John
Singleton, who spent a year working with Salerno on "Shaft."</TE>
<TE>   Associates describe him as a media junkie and voracious reader
known for walking into meetings aware of every movie ever produced by
everyone in the room.</TE>
<TE>   The product of the '80s and suburbia lists Mann's "Miami Vice" TV
series as his seminal inspiration. "I thought those were the two
coolest guys," Salerno said. "They made me believe Miami vice cops
drove $350,000 Ferraris."</TE>
<TE>   Salerno says he's always felt like he was in a rush, in part due
to the lasting effect of the sudden, unrelated deaths of four teenage
friends. Since he figured out how much time he lost while sleeping,
he says, he rarely sleeps more than three or four hours a night. His
production company is named Chasing Time Pictures.</TE>
<TE>   Salerno's hard-charging personality was clearly not embraced by
everyone. He says he continually faced the murmuring in the industry:
"Who is this kid? How did he get here?"</TE>
<TE>   "Herein lies something I've run up against," he says. "There is a
real difference between arrogance and confidence. For me, if you
don't get it right, I don't understand what the point is of doing it.
The worst thing you can be is ordinary."</TE>
<TE>   The person who launched Salerno's career in Hollywood was Gregory
Hoblit, a producer and director on "Hill Street Blues" and "L.A. Law.
" He was introduced to Salerno in 1993 at an editing facility and
vaguely recalled Salerno as the kid who made a documentary.</TE>
<TE>   "He walked into my offices and there was something about him that
got my attention," said Hoblit, who went on to direct films,
including "Primal Fear" and the recent "Hart's War." "He's built like
a fireplug. Short hair. He has this military way about him. Very
polite. 'Yes, sir. No, sir.'"</TE>
<TE>   Hoblit agreed to let Salerno hang out on the set of "NYPD Blue,"
which had recently been launched to critical acclaim.</TE>
<TE>   Commuting each day from Encinitas to Los Angeles, the 20-year-old
Salerno had a front row seat for the development of one of
television's best dramas, including the much-publicized departure of
series star David Caruso. "I was on set when huge tantrums occurred,"
Salerno said.</TE>
<TE>   He refused all production and gofer jobs, the traditional
steppingstones. "I didn't want to be anybody's assistant," he said.
During his yearlong apprenticeship on the set of "NYPD Blue"--he
received no salary during that time--Salerno said he carefully
planned how he was going to approach his career. "And during that
time I did something that people in this business don't do, which is
I read every single thing I could get my hands on," he said.</TE>
<TE>   If a director or filmmaker spoke anywhere in town, he was there.
On his list of seminal moments is a chance meeting with screenwriter
Ernest Lehman in a Brentwood copy shop, which resulted in an
inspirational note of praise for a script Salerno handed him in the
parking lot.</TE>
<TE>   At the time, Salerno was shopping a pilot script about two
twentysomething minority cops, which attracted the attention of
veteran television executive Fran McConnell. With the help of
McConnell, Salerno landed a three-year deal with Universal Television
and producer Dick Wolf ("Law &amp; Order"), who was preparing "New York
Undercover," which coincidentally happened to spotlight the
adventures of two twentysomething minority cops.</TE>
<TE>   He describes his time with "New York Undercover" as "the worst
nine months of my life." He clashed with one of the show's producers
and his co-writers; he wanted out of his three-year deal, even though
everyone, including his agent, said he was crazy to walk away from
guaranteed money. In his first year, at the age of 21, he made more
than $200,000.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody said wait," recalled Salerno, who had already taken
notice of Hollywood's legion of burned-out TV writers. "The
difference between me and those writers is I left."</TE>
<TE>   He managed to get out of his contract with the help of his new
agents at Creative Artists Agency. "It was very clear that he was on
a path to move forward," said Joe Cohen, his CAA agent of eight
years.</TE>
<TE>   Within weeks of leaving "New York Undercover," two extraordinary
things happened. Both came about through his relationship with Arne
Schmidt a producer who worked on such films as "RoboCop" and the
current "We Were Soldiers."</TE>
<TE>   Based on the TV script, Schmidt gave Salerno a shot at developing
"A Season in Hell," an action picture about an arson investigator
tracking a serial arsonist.</TE>
<TE>   Schmidt was also developing "Thunder Below," the story of Adm.
Eugene Fluckey, a heroic World War II submarine commander. Schmidt
was pitching the story to established, big-name writers, but Salerno
wanted it for himself.</TE>
<TE>   A few weeks after walking away from "New York Undercover," Salerno
brought up "Thunder Below" during a meeting with executives at the
newly born DreamWorks. By the end of the meeting Salerno had the room
enthusiastic for the submarine movie, even though he had no formal
role in Schmidt's project. Schmidt had already pitched to DreamWorks,
unsuccessfully. Within days, Salerno met with Steven Spielberg, who
greenlighted the project.</TE>
<TE>   A few days later, in an unrelated development, Dino De Laurentiis
paid $600,000 to acquire Salerno's script for "A Season in Hell,"
which Salerno and Schmidt pitched as "'Twister' with fire." Stallone
reportedly wanted to do it.</TE>
<TE>   Within days, the then-24-year-old Salerno was staying in
Stallone's Miami guest house working on "A Season in Hell." "First, I
show up at his house and it's Xanadu," Salerno recalled. "Xanadu with
some peculiar stuff, like a 20-foot-high statue of himself, which he
had sculpted himself."</TE>
<TE>   Stallone had just finished "Cop Land," the 1997 film he felt
re-established his credentials as a serious actor. As Salerno
recalls, Stallone wanted to be Olivier and the script called for
Rambo. Salerno says he wrote 18 versions of the script with Stallone
before throwing in the towel.</TE>
<TE>   Salerno began working on other projects, including a "production
polish" of the Kurt Russell thriller "Breakdown" for De Laurentiis.
He was also developing a movie on the Zodiac serial killer for
Disney's Touchstone division, a project that he had been obsessed
about for two years.</TE>
<TE>   Next, Salerno met director Michael Bay, who had just completed
"The Rock." Bay asked him to read a preliminary draft of
"Armageddon," a much-coveted project in the Hollywood writing
community that was expected to have a budget of well over $100
million. Bay hired Salerno despite objections from the producers and
the studio. "The idea of Shane Salerno writing this movie was not on
Disney's radar," said Salerno, who ended up sharing a screenwriter
credit on the movie.</TE>
<TE>   When word went out that Salerno was on the project, within hours
"meetings that I couldn't get before, projects that I wasn't being
considered for, everything changed," he said.</TE>
<TE>   After finishing work on "Armageddon," Salerno met with Singleton,
who had read Salerno's script for "Thunder Below." Singleton found
common ground with Salerno. "We both loved 'Miami Vice,'" Singleton
said. "We could finish each other's sentences with the same TV and
movie references."</TE>
<TE>   Singleton and Salerno worked and reworked "Shaft" for Will Smith,
Wesley Snipes and, eventually, Samuel L. Jackson.</TE>
<TE>   Although largely skewered by critics, "Shaft" made money. With two
major projects in theaters, Salerno became a hot property, a writer
with a reputation for writing action scenes and, as one executive put
it, "masculine guy stuff."</TE>
<TE>   Not every project made it to the screen. DreamWorks put "Thunder
Below" on the shelf when Universal announced plans to develop a
competing World War II submarine movie, "U-571." With Stallone unable
to agree on a script, "A Season in Hell" floundered.</TE>
<TE>   But the high-profile assignments kept coming. In 1998, he signed
on to work on "Bay of Pigs" for Ron Howard and Imagine Entertainment.
At the same time, he was developing his own projects, most notably
collaborating with actor Ving Rhames on "Night Train," about boxer
Sonny Liston.</TE>
<TE>   Around that time, he received a call from Mann, his teenage hero,
who brought Salerno in to write a movie about the drug trade,
something of a dream come true for the then-26-year-old Salerno. He
dived into the world of drug trafficking, doing research with DEA
agents and underworld characters.</TE>
<TE>   But after a year and a half, Mann decided to do "Ali" first,
putting Salerno's drug-trade movie on hold. "I was crushed," Salerno
said.</TE>
<TE>   But as is often the case for Salerno, frustration soon led to
another flurry of deals.</TE>
<TE>   Working with novelist Don Winslow, he developed the concept for a
one-hour drama about a team of undercover agents. NBC executives read
the script on a Friday, and the following Wednesday, after meeting
Salerno, they gave approval to develop a pilot.</TE>
<TE>   A few days later, Jersey Productions, which came on board as
co-producers of "UC: Undercover," announced a seven-figure "first
look" deal for Salerno's film projects. Under this type of
arrangement, a studio has a contractual right of first refusal on
every script a writer can deliver. If the studio declines, the writer
is free to shop the script elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   Despite only nine months of actual staff experience on a show, at
the age of 28 Salerno was given the role of show-runner, handling
day-to-day production tasks on a one-hour action series this season.</TE>
<TE>   "UC: Undercover" got off to a rocky start. First, actor Jimmy
Smits dropped out days before the pilot was scheduled to start
production, reportedly due to contractual entanglements with ABC.
Then, in a season packed with edgy new spy dramas, "Undercover" was
put on hiatus before the end of its first full season. It's not
expected to return.</TE>
<TE>   The Liston picture finally appears set to go into production this
summer with William Friedkin directing for Paramount and the Tom
Cruise-Paula Wagner production company. Through his deal with Jersey,
Salerno is writing an occult-themed picture tentatively titled
"Revelation" for George Clooney and Warner Bros., and a thriller
called "Vidocq."</TE>
<TE>   At 29, Salerno has acquired many of the trappings of Hollywood. He
owns two houses, one in Beverly Hills and another outside the city.
In the press, he has been linked romantically to former "General
Hospital" actress Sarah Brown, a relationship he declines to discuss.</TE>
<TE>   He wants to direct, an ambition he has denied until recently
because everyone in Hollywood says that what they really want to do
is direct. "I think it will be in the next 15 to 18 months. That's
the timeline I've got for myself."</TE>
<TE>   After a short pause, he added, "I tend to hit the deadlines I set
for myself."</TE>

<LD>A sampling of the kinds of extra material that is or will be
available on DVDs:</LD>
<LD>   * Later this year, "The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the
Ring" will offer the PG-13-rated theatrical version and an R-rated
cut expanded by about 30 minutes. Director Peter Jackson has been
intimately involved in the new version, which will include a special
disc with hours of background material and commentary.</LD>
<LD>   * The special edition of "Memento" will reflect director
Christopher Nolan's interest in "changing the way you look at the
film over multiple viewings," he said. "The DVD allows you random
access to a movie, so you can pick it up at any point, go back and
revisit things, like on a CD or in a book."</LD>
<TE>   * "Unbreakable" includes a documentary and commentary that
clarifies writer-director M. Night Shyamalan's attempt to create a
live-action superhero comic book.</TE>
<TE>   * "Shrek" has an extended ending as well as games and elaborate
karaoke-style features that allow viewers to voice or sing along with
characters from the film.</TE>

<HD>The Writing Was on the Wall in the '60s</HD>
<DH>Movies: The nonlinear techniques unsettling U.S. audiences
today were tried 40 years ago--often to better effect.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEPHEN FARBER</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Anyone old enough to contemplate Botox may have experienced an eerie
sense of deja vu at the movies lately. Many recent films--including
"Memento," "Mulholland Drive," "Donnie Darko," "Vanilla Sky," "Iris"
and "Last Orders"--stir echoes of movies of the 1960s, an era of
groundbreaking experimentation on and off the screen.</LD>
<LD>   Back then, this experimental wave, which started in Europe and
eventually overtook Hollywood as well, reflected a desire to discard
stale modes of storytelling and forge a new cinematic language.
Perhaps the same impulse is blossoming today. Adventurous moviemakers
are tired of being asked to recycle the same ancient formulas.
They're desperate to break the mold, and they're looking for
inspiration to an era when nonlinear storytelling and bold subject
matter seized the limelight.</LD>
<LD>   Even if their movies fall short of the masterpieces they're
mimicking, it's heartening that directors have rediscovered the
giants of international cinema from the '60s: Ingmar Bergman, Alain
Resnais, Federico Fellini and Michelangelo Antonioni. Those European
directors first made their influence felt 35 or 40 years ago, when
their innovative techniques were adopted by directors of American
pictures like "The Pawnbroker," "Point Blank," "Two for the Road,"
"Petulia," "Midnight Cowboy" and "They Shoot Horses, Don't They?"</LD>
<TE>   Taking their lead from "Hiroshima Mon Amour" and "8 1/2,"
enterprising directors fractured time and conjured dreamlike imagery.
Not all of these Hollywood pictures were huge box-office successes,
but they opened our eyes to new cinematic possibilities. The American
New Wave probably culminated with "The Godfather Part II," when
Francis Ford Coppola intercut two stories that commented on each
other obliquely rather than literally.</TE>
<TE>   "Jaws" and "Star Wars" put an end to that adventurous brand of
storytelling. Blinded by the colossal grosses of those, executives
decided to bring back straight-ahead linear storytelling and banish
more experimental impulses. I remember one studio chief telling me in
the '70s, "I hate flashbacks," and his literal-minded mantra gave a
hint of the simplistic mode of moviemaking that would prevail for the
next two decades. In order to tap the largest possible audience,
Hollywood demanded clarity and obviousness instead of the elliptical
style favored in the '60s.</TE>
<TE>   Over the years, however, talented filmmakers began to chafe at
these restrictions. Steven Soderbergh played a key role in helping to
revive the techniques of '60s and '70s movies. He published a book of
interviews with Richard Lester, a quintessential '60s director, and
Soderbergh's 1999 movie, "The Limey," showed the influence of
Lester's "Petulia" as well as John Boorman's "Point Blank." In "Out
of Sight," Soderbergh imitated the famous time-tripping love scene
from Nicolas Roeg's "Don't Look Now." And Soderbergh's low-budget
"Schizopolis" felt like one of the underground movies hatched in the
'60s. When he came to make "Traffic," Soderbergh incorporated
everything he had learned from '60s movies into a masterful triptych
that daringly intercut three stories filmed in completely different
styles.</TE>
<TE>   Now the nonlinear techniques that startled audiences in the '60s
are all the rage again. Even the relatively conventional "A Beautiful
Mind" takes a page from the movies of the '60s by blurring the line
between real events in John Forbes Nash Jr.'s life and hallucinations
that exist only in his imagination.</TE>
<TE>   A more complex structure operates in "Iris," which is about
novelist Iris Murdoch falling victim to Alzheimer's disease. As her
husband laments the disparity between the intellectual vitality she
had in her youth and her helplessness as the disease ravages her, the
film sagely cuts back and forth among the different times in her
life. This same technique is far less artfully employed in "Pinero,"
a kaleidoscopic look at the life of playwright Miguel Pinero. The
film careens through his short, feverish life, apparently in an
attempt to capture the chaotic mind of a stoned artist. But there's
something so arbitrary about the transitions that the whirling
dervish of a movie sheds very little light on its troubled
protagonist.</TE>
<TE>   Fred Schepisi's "Last Orders," which follows four men on a journey
to scatter the ashes of a recently deceased friend, is not much more
illuminating. As the survivors travel to the sea, the film intercuts
a jumble of memories from their lives over the past 50 years.
Schepisi is a talented director, so the film is fluently made, and it
benefits from the efforts of a superb cast that includes Michael
Caine, Bob Hoskins, Helen Mirren, Tom Courtenay and David Hemmings.
But it's a surprisingly shallow movie. The elaborate skein of
flashbacks and flashbacks within flashbacks reveals very little about
the inner lives of the characters. "Last Orders" doesn't match the
depth of a 1968 movie on a very similar theme, Sidney Lumet's "Bye
Bye Braverman," which focused on four middle-aged friends driving to
the funeral of a fifth pal and reminiscing about the disappointments
of their lives. And the time traveling in "Last Orders" never
approaches the pungency of the 1967 classic "Two for the Road," which
scrambled several periods in the life of a married couple to
highlight the cruel games that time plays on unsuspecting lovers.</TE>
<TE>   One problem with today's '60s-influenced movies is that they are
experimental in an almost academic way. Their technical trickery
doesn't always seem organic or truly revolutionary; it can seem
almost as mechanical as Gus Van Sant's misguided shot-for-shot remake
of "Psycho."</TE>
<TE>   Consider "Vanilla Sky," the most excruciating example of this new
nostalgia boom. The film is a remake of a 1998 Spanish film,
Alejandro Amenabar's "Open Your Eyes," which was itself inspired by
'60s movies like "Blowup" and "Last Year at Marienbad." So "Vanilla
Sky" starts out at several removes from any truly original filmmaking
impulse. Director Cameron Crowe jumbles time, plays games with
reality and illusion, and then takes a leap into metaphysical
mysticism. But Crowe (best known for comic, naturalistic films like
"Say Anything" and "Jerry Maguire") has no aptitude for the fancy
visionary style he's aping. "Vanilla Sky" has none of the tension
that directors like Resnais, Antonioni and Roeg brought to similar
puzzle movies in the '60s. Instead of a chic, tantalizing enigma,
Crowe has concocted a leaden lump of pretension.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike Crowe, David Lynch is a director with a genuine flair for
surrealism, and in "Mulholland Drive" he tips his hat to "Marienbad"
and also borrows from Bergman's 1967 masterpiece, "Persona," another
tale of female bonding, confused identity and dreamlike
disorientation. Lynch knows how to create a creepy mood, and
"Mulholland Drive" is often mesmerizing, but it seems like more of a
divertissement than a profound exploration of psychosexual dynamics.
Whereas Bergman plumbed the anguish of his two female protagonists--a
mute actress (Liv Ullmann) and her unstable nurse (Bibi
Andersson)--Lynch stays on the surface, tickling us with his sleight
of hand but rarely evoking intense emotion. His movie is like Bergman
Lite, and while it's often fun to watch, it fails to get under your
skin and arouse truly unsettling nightmares.</TE>
<TE>   Of all the recent movies to experiment with nonlinear
storytelling, "Memento" was the only one to take the kinds of risks
that made "8 1/2" or "Two for the Road" so exhilarating.
Writer-director Christopher Nolan unraveled a mystery through
overlapping flashbacks that kept pushing backward in time.
Unfortunately, "Memento" sank into incoherence at the conclusion. But
at least it tried something novel, and so it was truer to the radical
spirit of the '60s than many of these other clones.</TE>
<TE>   Along with their experiments in nonlinear narrative, movies of the
'60s were known for their sexual audacity. This trend also started in
foreign films and then gradually reached American cinema. The late
'60s and early '70s represented the peak (or nadir, depending on your
point of view) of Hollywood's sexual revolution. During the last
decade, sex has become less and less visible in American films, aside
from the puerile lasciviousness of teen comedies.</TE>
<TE>   Foreign filmmakers, on the other hand, have once again embarked on
a wave of sexual explicitness. Raw, graphic images pervade French
films like "Romance," "Fat Girl" and "Life of Jesus," though I find
these films more reminiscent of minor curiosities from the '60s like
"I, a Woman" and "I Am Curious--Yellow," than of the probing erotic
dramas made by Bergman and Antonioni.</TE>
<TE>   But at least foreign filmmakers are pushing the sexual envelope.
In "Y Tu Mama Tambien," Mexican director Alfonso Cuaron brings an
arresting frankness and impudence to the tale of two teenage boys on
a carnal road trip with an older woman. The movie is a cross between
a '60s classic, Francois Truffaut's "Jules and Jim," and a later,
more incendiary French movie, Bertrand Blier's "Going Places." "Y Tu
Mama Tambien" has broken box office records in Mexico and has made
nearly $2 million in U.S. theaters in less than a month.</TE>
<TE>   Just as foreign films of the '60s gradually liberated Hollywood, I
suspect that today's sexy foreign movies will inspire some cheeky
American auteurs to follow their example. One of the dominant motifs
at this year's Sundance Film Festival was sexual candor. You could
see flickerings of a new eroticism in the grand jury prize-winner,
"Personal Velocity," a triptych of women's stories marked by
uninhibited sexuality; in the crowd-pleasing "Tadpole," a saucier
version of "The Graduate," in which a 15-year-old boy is seduced by a
lecherous older woman; and in "Secretary," the tale of a
sadomasochistic affair between a secretary and her boss.</TE>
<TE>   The evidence is mounting that many of our most promising
filmmakers long to rebel against the blandness of recent studio
pictures. Although they haven't yet found an authentic voice of their
own, the impulse to experiment is invigorating, just as it was in the
'60s. Now it's time to turn away from past glories and invent a
genuinely new wave befitting a new millennium.</TE>

<DH>Rethinking notions of dance on film, a festival makes the
camera an integral part of the choreography.</DH>

<LD>When the words "dance" and "film" are put together, most people think
of musicals starring Fred Astaire or Gene Kelly, or maybe ballet
documentaries, with the action contained neatly within a proscenium
arch. But what if the point is not to film a musical or reproduce a
stage experience?</LD>
<LD>   Then you have a new kind of dance-on-screen genre, a hybrid that
will be seen the next two weekends at the Dance Camera West
International Dance Film and Video Festival at the Getty Center. In
these experimental works, the word "dance" expands to all manner of
movement: nuns who somersault across seats on a moving train, men who
wrestle like bulls in a cow pasture, and a romantic duet between a
man and a large earth-moving vehicle. Over and over, its not just a
person's performance, but also the camera's dance that draws in the
viewer.</LD>
<LD>   Organized by Lynette Kessler and Kelly Hargraves--two Los Angeles
dancer-choreographers who are also filmmakers--the festival will
screen 15 selections, ranging from four to 26 minutes long. Kessler
and Hargraves, who have both served on juries for New York's Lincoln
Center Dance on Camera Festival, brought the idea of a West Coast
edition to Laurel Kishi, the Getty Center's director of performing
arts programs.</LD>
<TE>   "I thought, Los Angeles is such a film town, why not here?" Kishi
said by phone, explaining that she jumped at the idea.</TE>
<TE>   Working with Kishi, Kessler and Hargraves decided not to try to
move the latest edition of the 30-year-old Lincoln Center festival to
L.A. For one thing, that festival has dozens of screenings at
different venues spread over a month. For another, it tends to mix
standard ballet documentaries with experimental work, and Kishi, who
oversees contemporary dance concerts at the Getty, wanted to focus on
the edgy and unusual, the works that see dance on film in a new
light.</TE>
<TE>   "That's what we wanted too," says Kessler, "and this first time
out, we also wanted to choose some of the big winners that come from
all over the world, with really high production values. Some weren't
in specific dance film festivals, and I think they'll appeal to a
wide audience."</TE>
<TE>   There is serious subject matter on the menu: domestic violence,
for instance, in "Contrecoup" from Switzerland (choreography by
Guilherme Botelho, directed by Pascal Magnin), and the Holocaust in
"Witnessed" (by Canadian choreographer Allen Kaeja, directed by Mark
Adam and Kaeja).</TE>
<TE>   But there is also a lot of wit and humor; the tumbling nuns in
"Hurtle" (from New Zealander Shona McCullough), or "Modern
Daydreams," which includes the man-machine pas de deux (choreographed
by Jamey Hampton and Ashley Roland, directed by L.A.-based Mitchell
Rose).</TE>
<TE>   Kessler's own submission, "Anima" (directed by Douglas Thompson),
is one of a few that use special effects, in this case, waves of
flowing images that play over Kessler's moving body. She is a little
sheepish about its inclusion, but she says it was chosen in part as a
representative of local films.</TE>
<TE>   The only film on both programs is the opener: Toronto filmmaker
Laura Taler's "A Very Dangerous Pastime: A Devastatingly Simple Dance
Guide." It's a "Reefer Madness"-like collage of vintage dance films
and talking heads, narrated in mock sententious tones, but offering
this serious advice: There is no need to panic when trying to
understand dance. Just watch, enjoy and think.</TE>
<TE>   Sitting in the "screening den" of Hargraves' Silver Lake house one
late March afternoon, both Kessler and Hargraves are eager to show
excerpts from the Getty festival, pointing out their favorite
moments--the way two dancers are framed by a hallway in an old
boarding school in "Measure" (from the Seattle-based dance troupe 33
Fainting Spells); and a close-up of a woman's bare feet as she walks
over a line of work boots in the Swiss film "Reines d'un Jour"
(choreographed by Marie Nespolo and Christine Kung, directed by
Pascal Magnin).</TE>
<TE>   Their own stories of moving from dance making to filmmaking help
explain why there is a genre that is half dance and half film. For
each of them, it started partly as an impulse to extend choreography
and partly because they were always around video cameras, which
choreographers use to capture improvisation.</TE>
<TE>   Kessler, 46, was making dances and working with video artists in
San Francisco in the late 1980s and early 1990s. "I would be running
a tape back and forth, slowing it down to learn the choreography, and
suddenly I'd focus on certain moments," she says about her filmmaking
epiphany. She moved to L.A. in 1994, continuing her film work and
presenting solo dances on programs at Highways and 2100 Square Feet
performance spaces.</TE>
<TE>   For Hargraves, 38, a Canadian who was living in New York before
moving to L.A. a year and a half ago, the architectural details of a
dance studio or the scene outdoors started to look alluring,
necessary to her work. While rehearsing back in Montreal, she
recalls, "I would be staring out a window and thinking, 'It would be
really great to be doing this out there.' And the camera sort of
allows you to take the studio with you. And if your dance is inspired
by mountain vistas and beaches, or you want to hear sirens and babies
crying in an urban environment, you can actually go there. I think it
really connects you back to your life."</TE>
<TE>   The two discuss spiritedly what dancers can bring to filmmaking
once they master the technology and procedures. They talk about the
similarities between editing and choreography. For instance, both
involve making shots flow or jump with rhythmic precision.</TE>
<TE>   They think filmmakers who have a strong kinesthetic sense must be
influenced by dance. Kessler sees dance-like properties in gunfights
staged for old westerns. Hargraves likes the way film-collage ads on
Turner Classic Movies have a strong sense of flow.</TE>
<TE>   "I can see how dance fits into the history of film," she said.
"And what's so great about [screen dance now] is that it's exactly
what this medium needs. It opens it up in a different way."</TE>
<TE>   But getting funds and audiences, and even getting the word out to
dance makers are other issues. Kessler and Hargraves hope the Dance
Camera West festival at least familiarizes more film people with new
horizons, and encourages dancers and choreographers to consider the
possibilities.</TE>
<TE>   Will it happen next year? That's uncertain. Kishi says the Getty
is in wait-and-see mode. But Kessler and Hargraves have developed a
few more strategies for spreading the word. Last year, for instance,
they joined forces with the Dance Resource Center of Greater Los
Angeles (a co-producer of the Getty festival), to offer a practical
workshop on dance film and video.</TE>
<TE>   They have also tested a "salon" format--small gatherings that
feature the work of emerging screen-dance makers. In December, a
small room at Santa Monica's Midnight Special bookstore was packed
for the first salon; another, which included many works from a
dance-film project headquartered at UCLA, was put together at the
Electric Lodge in Venice by choreographers-filmmakers Carol McDowell
and Sharon Kinney.</TE>
<TE>   Eventually, an additional audience may get to see some or all of
the entries from the two Getty evenings on public TV station KCET,
which is considering getting broadcast rights and sponsors for such a
scheme.</TE>
<TE>   The audience at the Getty will have the advantage of hearing some
of the filmmakers introduce their works and possibly even answer
questions afterward, if there's time.</TE>
<TE>   Among those scheduled to attend are Canada's Taler, 33 Fainting
Spells' Gaelen Hanson, "Modern Daydreams'" Rose, and Hans Beenhakker
from the Netherlands ("Wiped") as well as Victoria Marks, whose film
"Men" (with Margaret Williams) has been shown several times in Los
Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   For those who think film can't do justice to dance, it's a whole
new age, Kessler and Hargraves say. "People have so many limited
perceptions of what a dance film is," Hargraves says. "But there are
so many layers to it."</TE>
<TE>   She and Kessler haven't given up stage dance and choreography, but
it's clear that for them, the lure of dance on screen is
irresistible.</TE>
<TE>   "In the past, dancers who have looked at my stuff have said,
'Great, but it's not really dance,'" Kessler says. "And film people
say, 'Great, but why so much dance?' So, sometimes, I've felt like
I've fallen between the cracks. But now I see it as growing out of
the cracks, like this new plant."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>I'm feeling as grumpy as Andy Rooney, the cantankerous TV
commentator.</LD>
<LD>   If you could see me sitting at my desk, looking rumpled and
annoyed, you'd see an array of Latin music CDs in front of me. Then
I'd say sarcastically, "Have you ever wondered why the packages on so
many Latin CDs--especially compilations--look so cheap and cheesy?
Some of them have plain photos slapped on the cover and almost no
information inside. I'll bet I could do a better graphics job on my
home computer. Well, maybe not me. I still use this old typewriter
here. But I bet my son could."</LD>
<LD>   Then I'd pick up a sample to show you what I mean. This one's a
two-CD compilation by Pimpinela, the terrific brother-sister duo from
Argentina known for its 1980s pop songs done as dramatic dialogues
between a quarreling couple. They were one of my favorite acts at the
time. They always seemed to hit a realistic note about the trouble
with romantic relationships.</LD>
<TE>   So here they are on the cover, like a mug shot inside a pale gold
circle. The album of 32 hits is from a series called "32 Gold."
That's imaginative, no? But now look at the sleeve inside. It's just
a single, flimsy sheet, with that mug shot on the front and the song
titles on the back. It's the exact same list of song titles and times
that appears on the back of the box itself. I hate when they do that.
You expect to find something more inside, not just a duplication of
the back cover.</TE>
<TE>   They do give you the composer credits inside, though. See them
down here in tiny type? But look closely. (Camera zooms in.) Some
words have vowels missing, as if the letters dropped out during
printing. So the sibling songwriters appear as Joagu n and Luc a Gal
n. You have to fill in the blanks to know that's actually Joaquin and
Lucia Galan, who are Pimpinela. It must have been those pesky accent
marks that fouled up the typesetters.</TE>
<TE>   I don't mean to pick on this one album, released by Universal
Latino, one of those multinationals that have gobbled up the record
business. But you would think a company with so much money could do
better than this sad package.</TE>
<TE>   Universal is not the only offender, by far. And I'm not the only
disgruntled consumer.</TE>
<TE>   "It's shameless what they do, making cheap product," says Robert
Leaver, who's in charge of the well-stocked world music section at
the new Amoeba Music store in Hollywood. "Sony Discos and Universal
and the others, they're equally shameless. They look like pirated
CDs; they don't look real."</TE>
<TE>   Then Leaver, who buys Latin product for the retailer, hit on the
heart of the matter: "It's actually disrespectful to the artist and
disrespectful to the audience. It's like keeping the artist in the
ghetto."</TE>
<TE>   I might agree, if that were not an insult to ghetto art.</TE>
<TE>   Latin-label executives give all kinds of excuses for this
long-standing problem, primarily tight budgets and heavy sales
pressures. These compilations are rushed out to make monthly sales
quotas, one executive said. BMG Latin, for example, has a similar
series called "Lo Mejor de lo Mejor," or "the best of the best." The
multinational mines a treasure trove of classic releases from RCA
Victor's golden era, featuring 40 songs by revered stars such as
Mexico's Agustin Lara and Cuba's Beny More. Again, cookie-cutter
covers on the outside, no liner notes on the inside.</TE>
<TE>   At least BMG includes the year the songs were released. On the
Pimpinela package, which includes several live performances, buyers
are not even told where the live recordings took place.</TE>
<TE>   "For $10.98, we don't tell people too many things," jokes Jesus
Naranjo, an executive with Universal Latino's distribution arm who
notes that this is a mid-priced series. "Ink costs money."</TE>
<TE>   Maybe that's it. Maybe nice packages are too expensive for niche
markets.</TE>
<TE>   Think again, compadre.</TE>
<TE>   I was shocked to learn that attractive booklets cost only pennies
per CD to make. Consider "Caravana Cubana," the excellent 1999
release produced independently by Alan Geik, host of the KXLU-FM
radio show "Alma del Barrio."</TE>
<TE>   The cost for printing 5,000 copies of the album's full-color, four
page booklet was--are you ready for this?--38 cents each. And that
includes a specialty run with matte paper, rather than cheaper,
glossy stock, according to a bid Geik got from Vision Disc
International, a broker in Studio City.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, that doesn't include paying a graphic artist and a
writer.</TE>
<TE>   But the total manufacturing cost was just $1.46 per unit,
including pressing the CDs (49 cents apiece) and printing outer card
sleeves (an extra 22 cents).</TE>
<TE>   What are these labels doing with the rest of our money?</TE>
<TE>   The payoff for "Caravana Cubana": a Grammy nomination for best
album packaging.</TE>
<TE>   Geik worries that good music may get passed over by consumers who
get subliminal messages from unimaginative or bland packaging. But
it's getting better, he stresses. I agree. Releases of new music
often feature attractive packages nowadays, including CDs by Juanes
(Universal), Carlos Vives (EMI Latin), Alejandro Fernandez (Sony) and
Jaguares (BMG). Even Mexican regional music, famous for lousy covers,
is getting more artful treatment.</TE>
<TE>   It's the compilations that seem to get short shrift. Where's the
Beny More boxed set? Or the retrospective on Jose Alfredo Jimenez,
with his fabulous history and old photographs? Or how about an
informative, illustrated series on the history of the mariachi?</TE>
<TE>   The carelessness of the Pimpinela package made me so upset that I
abandoned plans to write about the album for our From the Vaults
column, which spotlights worthy reissues. I could not recommend such
a sloppy package to readers.</TE>
<TE>   At Amoeba, Leaver also balks at buying schlocky goods.</TE>
<TE>   "It makes me reluctant to stock the product," he says.</TE>
<TE>   Latin labels, wake up. Your policies are penny wise and pound
foolish.</TE>

<HD>Life After Death Row</HD>
<DH>Two actors traveled the country to meet people wrongly
convicted. The result: a drama and a new perspective.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HUGH HART</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two summers ago Jessica Blank and her boyfriend, Erik Jensen,
embarked on a road trip from New York to Minneapolis. It was no
vacation. They were visiting survivors of death row.</LD>
<LD>   "We'd drive to one person's house, do an interview for two or
three hours, get back on the road, drive 12 hours into the next state
to get there just in time for the next interview. One of us would
sleep and one of us would drive," recalls Blank, sitting in front of
the empty stage at the Actors' Gang theater.</LD>
<LD>   Beside her is the congenially rumpled Jensen, who picks up the
tale: "And the whole time we've got the cell phone in the car with
this weird Radio Shack recharger, and I'm charging the phone and
Jessica's typing on the laptop transcribing stuff while we're driving
in the car."</LD>
<TE>   In the course of that frenetic journey and six other trips through
Texas and other Southern states, New York actors Blank and Jensen
interviewed 20 people who'd been released from prison after being
wrongly convicted of murder. "The Exonerated," a documentary drama
opening for previews April 13 at the Actors Gang, weaves together six
of those stories.</TE>
<TE>   Stories like Gary Gauger's. His mother and father were found
stabbed to death on Gauger's Wisconsin farm. After being questioned
for 14 hours, the disoriented hippie farmer gave a "vision
statement"--a what-if scenario in which Gauger described how he would
have killed his parents, if he had killed them. That statement was
described in court as a confession. Gauger was sentenced to death and
spent seven years in prison before two motorcycle gang members
confessed to the killing.</TE>
<TE>   Then there's Kerry Cook. In 1977, he was a frightened 22-year-old
bartender who made the mistake of lying when homicide investigators
asked if he'd ever been in a murdered woman's apartment. Cook's
fingerprints were found on the door frame. He was convicted of murder
and spent 20 years in a 6-foot-by-14-foot Texas prison cell before
DNA tests proved the victim's ex-boyfriend was the culprit.</TE>
<TE>   Or Sunny Jacobs. She and her husband, ex-convict Jesse Tafero,
were sentenced in 1976 for murdering two policemen at a Florida rest
stop. Tafero was executed before an associate, Walter Rhodes,
admitted his guilt. By then, Jacobs had spent 16 years in prison.</TE>
<TE>   Jensen says, "I think our initial idea was that these stories
would be very dramatic, like 'Hamlet' dramatic, and very serious"--
"and maybe just very, very sad," adds Blank. "But when the interviews
started happening," Jensen continues, "it was weird because they were
also filled with incredible hope and gratitude. Like with Sunny, the
one time she teared up in our interview was when she talked about
this juror who had gotten in touch with her when it was all over and
said he was sorry. She just had this incredible forgiveness."</TE>
<TE>   Blank is reminded of their visit with Gauger. "We went to talk to
Gary on his amazing organic farm where he gave us garlic..." "...
that's still growing on our fire escape in New York," adds Jensen.</TE>
<TE>   "And here's a guy, when they found the people who really did kill
his parents," Blank continues, "Gary requested that those guys not be
given the death penalty. You hear things like that, it's pretty
astounding."</TE>
<TE>   Listening to the survivors' tales first hand shook the couple
considerably, Jensen says. "I've been in New York for the last 10
years, and I take pride in what I can handle. But hearing these
stories blew us away and the people themselves blew us away. I'd
never seen anyone so courageous as the people we met that summer.</TE>
<TE>   "Doing those interviews put our lives into an incredible
perspective. Somebody cutting me off in traffic, that is not a big
deal anymore."</TE>
<TE>   Blank interjects, "Who cares!"</TE>
<TE>   Jensen: "Or like personal things between Jess and me, we can work
it out, because there is nothing in our lives that can compare to
being on death row when you shouldn't be."</TE>
<TE>   Growing up in Minnesota, where his grandfather worked as a highway
patrolman, Jensen remembers being the only student in his Apple
Valley High School history class willing to argue against capital
punishment.</TE>
<TE>   Blank says she's been interested in prison reform practically all
her life. Her parents were Washington, D.C.-based antiwar activists
in the '60s. She double-majored in theater and philosophy at the
University of Minnesota, gravitating early in her acting career to
documentary theater as embodied by performance artist Anna Deavere
Smith.</TE>
<TE>   Jensen, who earned a bachelor's in fine arts from Carnegie Mellon
University in Pittsburgh, cites as an inspiration his friend Moises
Kaufman, who conceived and directed "The Laramie Project." Recently
televised in a version on HBO, the piece used interview material to
reconstruct the aftermath of Matthew Shepard's murder.</TE>
<TE>   By the time they began dating in early 2000, Blank and Jensen were
paying the rent with film, TV and stage gigs while tapping into
Manhattan political circles through benefits and spoken-word
performances. But they hankered for a more ambitious project that
would meld activist impulses with compelling storytelling. A few
weeks after they met in a New York restaurant, Blank and Jensen got
the push they needed in the form of a heart-rending phone call.</TE>
<TE>   Jensen recalls, "Jessica dragged me to this anti-death penalty
conference at Columbia University. It was gonna take six hours, it
was a pain ... but I went." They sat through typical talking-head
forums, then gathered around a speaker phone. "It was this inmate in
Chicago," Blank says. "His confession was basically tortured out of
him. There was something in him that was just pleading for somebody
to hear his story."</TE>
<TE>   Blank and Jensen decided it was time to act.</TE>
<TE>   Raising $12,000 in dribs and drabs to finance their expeditions,
Blank and Jensen hit the road with a tape recorder, video camera and
a list of contacts provided by the Center for Wrongful Convictions
and other groups. In Chicago, they visited Delbert Tibbs, who spent
three years in prison after he was convicted for murder in Florida.
Tibbs, a former seminary student, was a foot taller than the real
killer. But, like the actual culprit, Tibbs was an African American,
and that was sufficient for a witness to point to him as the guilty
party.</TE>
<TE>   When he was first contacted by a mutual friend, Tibbs recalls, "I
wondered, 'What is this, somebody working on their master's thesis?'
And they tell me, 'Well no, they're artists and want to use their art
to do something about the death penalty. And I said, 'Do they have
any money?' because I wasn't working at the time.</TE>
<TE>   "'No, they don't have any money.' And to myself I say, 'Well,
maybe this is something good. Just for the sake of the cause--well,
yeah, I'll talk to 'em.'"</TE>
<TE>   When the two showed up at his door, recalls Tibbs, "they told me
when they get back to New York, they'll be looking for an angel and
put it on, and I'm thinking, 'Well ... everybody's looking for an
angel in New York to put on a play.' But anyway, I did an interview
with them, and I just sort of let it all hang out. They recorded it.
And then they called me three or four months later and said, 'We'd
like you to come to New York. We're gonna pay your fare.'</TE>
<TE>   "They had pretty much put what I had told them right back in the
play. When it was over, the people just kept applauding, it seemed
like for 10 minutes. They took, like, three curtain calls."
Afterward, Tibbs met actor Charles Dutton, who portrayed him. "He and
I had some bubbly wine and hors d'oeuvres and all of that afterwards.
I thought it was a fine thing."</TE>
<TE>   In September 2000, Blank and Jensen returned from their travels
with 150 pages of unedited manuscript. They didn't find an angel but
did hook up with a priceless connection in the person of Bob Balaban.
An astute New York actor-director-writer-producer, Balaban hired
character actor and first-time writer Julian Fellowes to create his
Oscar-winning screenplay for "Gosford Park."</TE>
<TE>   Balaban had befriended Jensen after directing him in Arthur
Kopit's play "Y2K" at the Manhattan Theatre Club in 2000. "My main
contribution was access," says Balaban. "I knew celebrities who were
very interested in the subject, so when Erik and Jessica called me
with the piece, the first thing I said was, 'Susan and Tim are
friends of mine. I'm going to ask them if they'd like to do a
benefit.'"</TE>
<TE>   That would be Susan Sarandon and Tim Robbins. When the two actors
signed up for a staged reading at the Culture Project at the 45
Bleecker Theater in November 2000, "The Exonerated" gathered
momentum. Richard Dreyfuss, Parker Posey, Blair Brown, Steve Buscemi,
David Morse, Cherry Jones, Martha Plimpton, Debra Winger, Ossie Davis
and Dutton participated in four benefit performances, including one
at the United Nations.</TE>
<TE>   The play's dramatic potential was obvious to Robbins. "I think the
thing that makes for interesting acting and interesting plays is high
stakes. I don't think it gets much higher than what you find in 'The
Exonerated.'"</TE>
<TE>   After the readings, Balaban urged Blank and Jensen to undertake
another round of research. "I wanted to give 'The Exonerated' a
reason to be an evening in the theater and not just a benefit," says
Balaban, who will direct the expanded version of "The Exonerated"
when it moves to New York for an off-Broadway production. "I
suggested that Erik and Jessica add court transcripts so that you
feel some structure to the piece. And structure, whether it's TV or
plays or movies, is really everything--what to begin with, what you
choose to put back to back."</TE>
<TE>   The couple made more trips, read thousands of pages of trial
records, examined microfiche newspaper articles, sorted through
affidavits, read depositions and looked up police interrogations to
add dramatic counterpoint to their protagonists' monologues.</TE>
<TE>   Compressing all that raw material into a 90-minute performance
required months of rewrites. Says Jensen, "It was like writing a play
the way Moby writes music: We were mixing words. Depending on how you
juxtaposed things together, different things, completely different
meanings, would pop. That's what really created the power of the
piece."</TE>
<TE>   While Jensen was in North Carolina shooting the medieval comedy
"Black Knight" --he played a warrior sentenced to be
executed--Balaban and Blank labored on in New York. Last winter,
Robbins offered to stage "The Exonerated" at the Actors' Gang where
he serves as artistic director.</TE>
<TE>   One could easily imagine that Blank and Jensen, conversant as they
are with crime statistics, pending legislation and case studies of
prosecutorial misconduct, would be more than happy to get on a
soapbox.</TE>
<TE>   But Blank and Jensen, who got married last summer, deliberately
kept their personal views out of "The Exonerated." Says Jensen, "The
last thing we want to do is some kind of revolutionary beret-wearing,
fist-in-the-air kind of theater. That turns more people off than it
draws in, and we're not doing that with this play. We just want to
present these stories as cleanly and clearly as we can."</TE>
<TE>   "I see our roles as being a conduit," Jensen says. "People think
actors are kind of self-involved, and it's kind of nice to do
something that doesn't really have anything to do with us."</TE>
<TE>   The effects of imprisonment have left their scars on the real-life
"Exonerated" characters, some literal, some figurative. Cook still
has marks carved on his body by convicts who attacked him in prison.
Freed from Florida prison, David Keaton cannot get a license to
practice his former profession as a horse groomer, even though his
felony conviction was later purged. Blank says, "It's not just like,
'Oh, it's a happy ending, they're freed from prison, yay, hooray!'
You know, the effects are really not that different from coming home
from a war."</TE>
<TE>   Tibbs, for one, forges ahead in Chicago, where he's writing his
autobiography in between odd jobs. "As the guys on the road used to
say, it was a hellified experience. I don't know if I will ever get
over it," he says. "It's changed me in ways I'm not even sure I can
articulate. I'm not sure it made me a better person. But I did not
allow those times to make me a worse person. I'm not a kid. I'm 61.
And yeah, it traumatized my life to an extent, but I'm a preserving
bastard. For the most part, it's good to be alive, man."</TE>

<HD>Redemption at Last?</HD>
<DH>Townes Van Zandt didn't have much luck with his poetic
songs of despair, but reissues show he deserves more.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBERT HILBURN</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Just under 800 people in the U.S. bought a Townes Van Zandt album
last week, a sales rate that has held fairly steady for about a
decade.</LD>
<LD>   That information comes from SoundScan, which monitors album sales
so closely that it can tell us how many albums an artist sells weekly
in each major city. (Van Zandt's latest weekly sales total in L.A.:
fewer than 50 copies.)</LD>
<LD>   One thing SoundScan can't tell us is who bought those Van Zandt
albums, but we can assume that over the years the list has included
Bob Dylan, Bono, Lucinda Williams, John Prine, Lyle Lovett and Merle
Haggard.</LD>
<TE>   They are just a fraction of the honor roll of artists who have
saluted the late singer-songwriter, either by singing his songs or
testifying to the high quality of his work.</TE>
<TE>   Steve Earle, one of today's most acclaimed songwriters, is such a
supporter that he once called Van Zandt the best songwriter in the
world and vowed that he would "stand on Bob Dylan's coffee table in
my cowboy boots" and tell Dylan so.</TE>
<TE>   Even if you don't join in that colorful evaluation, the
just-released "The Best of Townes Van Zandt" should convince you that
the Texan, who died of a heart attack in 1997 at age 52, deserves a
place on the short list of great singer-songwriters of the modern pop
era.</TE>
<TE>   At a time when pop music is starving for quality writers, it's
disheartening to think that Van Zandt's catalog--about a dozen
original studio collections, live albums and retrospectives--accounts
for just 1,000 of the 12 million or so albums sold each week.</TE>
<TE>   The surprise is that during his creative peak in the '60s and
'70s, the golden age of the singer-songwriter, Van Zandt sold even
fewer--about 50 to 100 albums a week, according Kevin Eggers, whose
Poppy and Tomato record labels released the songwriter's early work.</TE>
<TE>   One reason is that he was on tiny labels, which meant he didn't
enjoy the promotional campaigns major labels mounted for Dylan, Joni
Mitchell, James Taylor and other best-sellers.</TE>
<TE>   Another reason is Van Zandt's self-destructiveness.</TE>
<TE>   If you look at his publicity photos from the '70s, there is a
gentle, almost innocent quality about him--a soft, wistful calm. In
truth, Van Zandt--who was from a celebrated Texas family (one of his
ancestors was instrumental in founding Fort Worth)--was a tortured
soul who reportedly suffered from severe depression.</TE>
<TE>   "Townes went through huge mood swings," says Eggers, who
discovered Van Zandt in the late '60s. "One moment he could be really
happy and working, and then you could find him crying in the middle
of the night. I think he also felt humiliated by the fact he was seen
by some as a failure."</TE>
<TE>   Eggers recently reactivated the Tomato label after a decade, in
part to showcase Van Zandt's music for a new generation.</TE>
<TE>   The eclectic New York label, which has also been home to such
varied artists as classical composer Philip Glass and bluesman Albert
King, just released the "Best of" album as part of a campaign
centered on Van Zandt's music. At least eight more collections,
mostly reissues, are due within the next year. A Van Zandt television
documentary and a biography are in the works, Eggers said.</TE>
<TE>   "We're getting calls from all around the world ... Japan, France,"
Eggers says. "Mojo [magazine] in England is doing a cover story on
him. It's interesting to see how things go in cycles. I've always
believed that artistry would eventually win out. Maybe the public is
finally ready to see now what was sometimes hard to see then."</TE>
<TE>   If Van Zandt, who was born in Fort Worth on March 7, 1944, had
just arrived on the music scene, the lanky Texan might well be on
Lost Highway Records, and be every bit as acclaimed as that label's
singer-songwriter sensations Williams and Ryan Adams.</TE>
<TE>   Like theirs, Van Zandt's folk-, country- and blues-influenced
style combines sweet, seductive melodies with poetic images that are
both sophisticated and personal.</TE>
<TE>   On the "Best of" album, the song that should catch everyone's ear
is "Pancho &amp; Lefty," a 1972 composition as evocative and enduring as
Kris Kristofferson's "Me and Bobby McGee" or Dylan's "To Ramona."</TE>
<TE>   It's a tale of lost dreams and betrayal graced with the poetic
imagery that characterizes Van Zandt's best work: "Living on the road
my friend/Was gonna keep you free and clean/Now you wear your skin
like iron/Your breath's as hard as kerosene."</TE>
<TE>   Dylan has used "Pancho &amp; Lefty" as a concert opener. Merle Haggard
and Willie Nelson had a No. 1 country hit with it in 1983, and
Emmylou Harris and Linda Ronstadt included it on their 1999 album,
"Western Wall: The Tucson Sessions."</TE>
<TE>   It's far from an isolated gem. "Pancho &amp; Lefty's" soulful edge is
matched in Van Zandt's work by several songs so exquisitely crafted
that they seem like pure, unfiltered glimpses of a man's soul.</TE>
<TE>   There are moments in which Van Zandt celebrates love and life, as
in 1971's "To Live Is to Fly" and 1972's "If I Needed You." More
often, there is a sense of futility, despair and impending death,
summarized in 1968's "Waiting 'Round to Die": "Sometimes I don't know
where this dirty road is taking me/Sometimes I can't even see the
reason why/I guess I keep on gamblin', lots of booze and
ramblin'/Well, it's easier than just a-waitin' 'round to die."</TE>
<TE>   In these and other Van Zandt songs, the influence he had on other
writers can be discerned. John Prine, best known for such early-'70s
tunes as "Hello in There" and "Sam Stone," has long been my favorite
folk-oriented songwriter after Dylan, and I assumed his music was
shaped almost exclusively by Dylan's work.</TE>
<TE>   But I've never heard a song to match the character study and
detail of Prine's work any better than Van Zandt's "Tecumseh Valley,"
which was written years before Prine's first album.</TE>
<TE>   Similarly, there's a sense of Texas vitality and spirit to "White
Freight Liner Blues" that is echoed in the work of one of my other
favorite bands--the Flatlanders, a trio made up of Joe Ely, Butch
Hancock and Jimmie Dale Gilmore. In the music on "Best Of," you can
also hear Earle, Lyle Lovett, Williams and others being inspired.</TE>
<TE>   "He didn't write a lot of songs, but everything he did write was
remarkable," Eggers says, with the affection of someone who has
championed Van Zandt's music for three decades. "He crafted each song
like it was a little diamond."</TE>
<TE>   Eggers, a former rock 'n' roll booking agent, was looking for acts
for his new Poppy label (the name was later changed to Tomato) when
he heard a tape of the singer's "Tecumseh Valley."</TE>
<TE>   "I was struck immediately," he recalls.</TE>
<TE>   "Here was someone who was as much influenced by Emily Dickinson
and the great poets as he was by songwriters. If you take those songs
without the music, they are compelling pieces of literature, and his
chief theme, to me, was about how fragile we all are."</TE>
<TE>   There have been so many colorful, often conflicting stories about
Van Zandt's exploits in the early years that it is as hard to piece
together the chapters in his life as it apparently was for him to
live them.</TE>
<TE>   Most accounts agree he was from a once oil-wealthy family. As a
teenager, he was diagnosed as manic-depressive and underwent months
of insulin shock therapy. Inspired by seeing Elvis Presley on TV, he
decided to pursue music rather than follow through on college. He
started out playing blues and folk numbers in coffeehouses and clubs
in Texas, but quickly graduated to writing his own tunes.</TE>
<TE>   According to a posthumous press bio, Van Zandt "pursued the
rambling-gambling life to its farthest extreme, performing until he
was regularly collapsing on stage from increasing frailty and alcohol
abuse."</TE>
<TE>   Eggers says his relationship with the songwriter fell apart in the
late '70s because of Van Zandt's unreliable behavior. Van Zandt's
ex-wife, Jeanene, disputes that account. She said the singer severed
ties with Eggers because he was unhappy over their business
relationship. She also said she is considering legal action against
Eggers because she hasn't seen royalty statements in years. Eggers
denied any wrongdoing.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever the nature of their falling out, Eggers and Van Zandt
patched things up a few years later and began working on an ambitious
series of duet albums that featured Van Zandt and 60 or so of his
admirers singing his songs. They completed some tracks, but Eggers
had trouble financing the project and it was suspended.</TE>
<TE>   Some of those tracks--duets with Nelson, Harris and others--were
included in "Texas Rain--The Texas Hill Country Recordings," which
was released by Tomato late last year.</TE>
<TE>   Eggers plans to follow it up with more duet packages. Several top
artists, from Bono to Lovett, are committed to the project, Eggers
says. Their voices will be added to tracks Van Zandt recorded
specifically for the duets project.</TE>
<TE>   Jeanene Van Zandt said Van Zandt always saw his career impact in
terms of the future. "Townes didn't care about his career," she said.
"He knew he wouldn't be famous until 100 years after he died. He was
just driven by demons. He had depression attacks so bad that all I
could do was hold his head and rock him."</TE>
<TE>   Van Zandt's music is certainly strong enough to deserve the
attention of a wide audience. But Eggers is a realist.</TE>
<TE>   In a record industry that usually measures success in gold or
platinum albums, Eggers, after all these years, will raise a toast if
Van Zandt's album sales just jumped to, say, 2,000 a week.</TE>

<HD>The Evil That Museums Do</HD>
<DH>An exhibition of Nazi imagery in recent subpar art offers
lessons, all right--but not ones the curator had in mind.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRISTOPHER KNIGHT</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>A few days after seeing "Mirroring Evil: Nazi Imagery/Recent Art,"
the widely publicized exhibition at New York's Jewish Museum, I was
talking with an artist who expressed a keen lament. The show
assembles work by 13 artists from eight countries all under the age
of 50, and according to a text printed on the museum's entry wall,
they all use Nazi-era imagery to make art that explores the nature of
evil. The artist I spoke with sighed, "It was such a good idea for a
show, but it's a shame that most of the art is so bad."</LD>
<LD>   I am in full agreement with one part of that assessment. Almost
all of the art in "Mirroring Evil" is indeed quite bad. Typical is
"L'Homme Double" (1997), a Conceptual project by a young Scottish
artist named Christine Borland. She commissioned six forensic
sculptors to create portrait busts of the notorious Nazi doctor Josef
Mengele, based only on eyewitness descriptions of the man plus two
grainy photographs that she provided. The resulting clay busts, all
quite different in visage and rendered with differing degrees of
skill, are displayed with the documentary material that inspired
them.</LD>
<TE>   The piece is ostensibly an inquiry into the distinction between
representing evil and participating in it, according to another text
printed on the museum wall. Actually, it's just a retread of
"Commissioned Paintings," a pioneer work of Conceptual art that John
Baldessari made 32 years ago. In that work, the California artist
hired a number of amateur painters to render pictures based on
documentary photographs he gave them.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, several others have employed the tactic to assorted
ends. "L'Homme Double" is thoroughly academic art, cranked out
according to a formula and an established set of rules, and it amply
illustrates a recurring feature of this inane exhibition: the
banality of art about evil. There are lessons to be learned from the
Jewish Museum show, but none of them has much to do with
understanding the nature of evil through art.</TE>
<TE>   But back to the artist I was talking to. What gave me pause about
her comment was its presumption that a good idea for a thematic show
of contemporary art might ever be generated in the absence of
excellent art.</TE>
<TE>   Don't good ideas for museum shows come from seeing great stuff? If
a curator notices that a number of mediocre artists are independently
making mediocre art that shares a particular image in common--Nazi
paraphernalia, say--is that fair cause to organize a show? Probably
not. The most obvious lesson of "Mirroring Evil" is the futility of
attempting to make a productive exhibition from lousy work.</TE>
<TE>   The fact that an otherwise savvy artist was suggesting the
possibility, though, is worth considering. Artists are used to making
silk purses out of sows' ears. It's their stock in trade. They gather
up oily pigments and pieces of cloth and chunks of plastic and
lengths of videotape and castoff junk and other inert stuff, and then
they try to make it live.</TE>
<TE>   So from that perspective, getting a good show out of next to
nothing might seem plausible. The apparent problem is that museum
curators sometimes seem to think they are artists too. They're
mistaken.</TE>
<TE>   At least two other worthwhile lessons can be gleaned from
"Mirroring Evil." One is that the 30-plus-year reign of International
Conceptual art dwarfs anything we've seen in Western culture since
International Gothic held sway throughout Europe between the 1380s
and the 1420s. International Gothic was a courtly style that appealed
to an aristocratic taste for rarefied self-aggrandizement. (The
famous French manuscript illuminated by the Limbourg Brothers, "Les
Tres Riches Heures du Duc de Berry," is ostensibly a solemn prayer
book, but its luscious ornamental elegance mostly says how nice it
was to be the duke.) The same with International Conceptualism. It
ornaments the smug, clannish institutionalization of contemporary art
today.</TE>
<TE>   It can get pretty ludicrous. "Mirroring Evil" claims to document
an emerging trend. In the past, the subject of the Nazi era has
mostly been limited to two areas of visual art: memorials to the
Holocaust and works made by survivors, which stand as evidence. The
new trend is said to be art that is cautionary, rather than memorial
and evidentiary. It warns us not to take for granted the Nazi symbols
of oppression that pervade popular culture. Fascism is presented by
this show as a mirror for the gruesome evils of entertainment and the
commercial marketplace.</TE>
<TE>   It's Heil, Hitler meets Hello, Kitty. And no, I'm not joking.
That's exactly the farcical hybrid offered by French artist Alain
Sechas, whose multiple toy figures of stylized cartoon cats sport
Adolf's signature mustache and hair, and clutch swastika rattles in
their tiny paws.</TE>
<TE>   Sechas lines up five of these freakish little creatures on
pedestals between mirrored walls, which reflect the souvenirs into an
infinity of mass reproduction. Prada, Diet Coke, Lego and Calvin
Klein underpants collide with canisters of Zyklon-B, Buchenwald, the
SS and Nuremberg rallies elsewhere in the show.</TE>
<TE>   In case you missed the connection between fascism and commerce,
British artist Alan Schechner spells it out. He's made a digital work
in which a product bar code morphs into a photograph of concentration
camp inmates. A number tattooed onto an arm is here likened to the
number printed in code on your supermarket purchase.</TE>
<TE>   Actors playing Nazis in 145 movie stills create a wallpaper border
around the entry gallery. A work by Polish artist Piotr Uklanski, it
lets you know right off that your deepest experience with
totalitarianism is brought to you by Hollywood. (Surely you've never
read a book.) To underscore the point, the photographs are installed
just above your head, so you're forced to look up to these
pseudo-Nazi movie stars.</TE>
<TE>   Later, Germany's Rudolf Herz pairs a 1932 photograph of Hitler
with one of avant-garde artist Marcel Duchamp--coincidentally taken
20 years earlier by the same photographer, Heinrich Hoffmann, who
became the Fuhrer's official portraitist. Herz covers a gallery room
with their alternating images, recalling Andy Warhol's series of
"Most Wanted Men" and his famous "Cow" wallpaper (albeit in sober
black-and-white).</TE>
<TE>   A nearby museum wall text wonders, "Do we desire designer labels
so much that we would accept anything at all that comes with them?
When does our conformity to popular norms become dangerous?"</TE>
<TE>   I'd say the answer is that our desires become dangerous when hack
artists who conform to designer notions popular in the academy are
held up by art museums as risk-taking adventurers in the precincts of
cultural virtue.</TE>
<TE>   That clannishness is part of what makes the third lesson of
"Mirroring Evil" possible: Art predicated on the assumption that the
audience is composed of a bunch of ignorant, unaware boobs who march
in goose-step to the spectacles of Madison Avenue and Dow Jones is
ripe for tabloid treatment. (Call it the revenge of the uninformed
upon the beautiful.) It's not hard to manufacture a phony controversy
about art today.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, it was a business bible that kicked off the ruckus over
the Jewish Museum show. The Wall Street Journal ran a story on the
front page of its second section on Jan. 10, nine full weeks before
the exhibition opened. It began: "An art exhibition headed for New
York could become the next art-world 'Sensation.' That 1999 exhibit
at the Brooklyn Museum of Art featured a painting of the Virgin Mary
splattered with dung, drawing fire from Catholics, including former
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, among others."</TE>
<TE>   As a rule of thumb, news stories report what did happen, not what
could happen. A sensational story saying that "Mirroring Evil" could
become a media scandal is what is known as a self-fulfilling
prophecy.</TE>
<TE>   The story, in addition to reporting conjecture, didn't even report
correctly what did happen in 1999. The painting of the Virgin Mary in
the Brooklyn show used dung--a reverential symbol to the artist--but
it wasn't "splattered" with dung. The "splatter" fib, with its
erroneous connotation of desecrating an icon, was launched into the
public consciousness by William Donohue, polemical head of the
Catholic League for Religious and Civil Rights, whose October 1999
newsletter incorrectly complained that a painting in "Sensation" had
"elephant dung splattered all over" it. The tabloid New York Post
dutifully repeated the factual error, almost word for word, followed
by right-wing talk-radio hosts from New York to L.A. The false
splatter-story has been ricocheting through the mass-media echo
chamber ever since.</TE>
<TE>   Donohue also compared the "Sensation" exhibition to events
in--yes--Nazi Germany, exclaiming, "No wonder Hitler was accepted as
an artist." (Uh, no, he wasn't.) For the Wall Street Journal, the
potential for offense in a Jewish Museum show of recent art that
employs Nazi imagery was apparently too much to resist. The day after
the scandalous story appeared, the New York Post and the Daily News
ran with it--and here we are.</TE>
<TE>   A story about third-rate academic artists who think mass
entertainment and commercial culture operate according to principles
of fascism, which is the main (nutty) theme in "Mirroring Evil,"
probably couldn't get much media traction. Holocaust survivors being
asked to look at cheesy busts of Josef Mengele and a hobby-shop model
of a concentration camp made from a Prada box, on the other hand--now
that's a story.</TE>
<TE>   Or is it? Suppose Holocaust survivors were asked to look at a
contemporary artist's drawings of Jews depicted as mice and rats,
drawings that derive from racist Nazi literature that relied on the
anti-Semitic stereotype of Jews as vermin. That actually happened in
an exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art back in 1991--to
near-universal acclaim. Art Spiegelman's "Maus," a brilliant,
two-volume comic-book masterpiece on the Holocaust, didn't bear
witness or memorialize victims. Instead it looked evil squarely in
the eye and in a devastating manner that almost nothing in "Mirroring
Evil" dares.</TE>
<TE>   The single exception at the Jewish Museum is a stunning, 15-second
video called "Hebrew Lesson," by Israeli artist Boaz Arad. The artist
spliced together tiny fragments of documentary films of Hitler's
propaganda speeches, producing a brief, jumpy montage that changed
his German syllables into a Hebrew sentence. "Shalom, Yerushalayim,
ani mitnatzel," sputters the jerking, dissonant, discombobulated
dictator. "Hello, Jerusalem, I apologize." Because a victor always
gets to write the history, Arad's creation of a powerful, moving
phantasm transforms victimhood into survivorship.</TE>
<TE>   The generation that experienced the unspeakable events of 1933 to
1945 will soon be gone. Arad, who is 46, plainly knows that the big
hand-off is well underway. Survivorship has a second important
meaning, which is the right to claim the legacy of one who dies.
Younger generations will henceforth pick up the voice of those who
could speak from experience. Arad claims survivorship in "Hebrew
Lesson," which is the most significant lesson this show has to offer.</TE>

<LD>I think that the time has arrived when the buildings that house art
often outstrip the original intention of displaying this very same
art by self-aggrandizing themselves over that which they are required
to shelter and nourish ("Art for Architecture's Sake," by Nicolai
Ouroussoff, March 31). Tremendous beauty (and money spent), just like
ugliness, can be a distraction.</LD>
<LD>   And yet, so many of these buildings, even the upcoming LACMA-Rem
Koolhaas destruction/renovation, are so visually wonderful on their
own that it seems a pity there isn't a place for them to reside
solely on their own merit. Possibly they'd be more welcome as works
of art themselves? That would be my suggestion: Have institutions
construct architectural showcases, leaving them bereft of any of the
conventional art we've come to expect when we visit museums, thereby
freeing them of any competitive aspects. This would allow architects
to design them internally and externally for people to experience and
observe.</LD>
<LD>   Let's hang our conventional art in converted warehouses like the
Geffen, which is so much more conducive to allowing a full
appreciation of art by the viewer.</LD>
<TE>   And while we're at it, maybe LACMA could consider repainting the
Japanese Pavilion some receptive color other than minty green, and
possibly tearing down the May Co. building, retaining only the
gold-colored structure on the corner of Wilshire and Fairfax, since
we all know that's the only worthwhile feature.</TE>

<TE>   As an employee of the Asian Art Museum of San Francisco (an
institution that will open its new, $160-million facility in early
2003), I read with great interest Ouroussoff's piece on the current
spate of showy architecture among museums.</TE>
<TE>   Some of us were concerned that our project--an adaptive reuse of
San Francisco's former main library led by Milanese architect Gae
Aulenti (also responsible for Paris' Musee d'Orsay)--might not get
the attention we feel it deserves, mainly because it leaves the
exterior of the 1917 Beaux Arts building relatively unchanged.</TE>
<TE>   After reading Ouroussoff's piece, I felt reassured that the
museum's wonderful new space will indeed be the ideal home for our
internationally respected collection of Asian art.</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Whether a museum's architecture should be subservient to its
holdings is an issue on which I wouldn't hazard a judgment. However,
if one particular local museum were to proceed with a major
replacement facility housed entirely beneath an air-cushioned
translucent tent, the administrators had ought to be certain that
they can rely upon a dependable system that will contend with
dangerous weather.</TE>
<TE>   There must be a fail-proof system that will intercept or prevent
lightning bolts from slicing through the proposed inflatable roof,
causing panic, destruction and death.</TE>
<TE>   JOHN CRANDELL</TE>
<TE>   Westwood</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Contrary to Ouroussoff's assertions that architectural structures,
such as the Getty, overwhelm their art collection or that "chaos is
the root of creative thought," creativity often has a sense of divine
harmony--and this is the case with the Getty.</TE>
<TE>   He fails to mention the Getty's main strength: You are free to
tailor the experience to what you want, to tour the collection at
your own pace, according to your preferences and those of the people
you're with. You are not shepherded en masse, like sheep, forced to
wait in long lines to see a Monet or the Dutch Masters.</TE>
<TE>   The Getty experience is individualistic, and all for a mere five
bucks. What the Getty may lack in terms of the quantity of its
collection (it will never compare to New York's Met) it certainly
makes up for in terms of quality--it's the best museum-going
experience I've had in a long while.</TE>

<LD>On March 21, a Business section article announced "EMI to Cut 1,800
Jobs, Drop 400 Musical Acts," and went on to say the layoffs
represented 20% of EMI's work force. Now, on March 31, the Calendar
section's Pop Eye announced that EMI made a new $50-million deal with
British pop star Robbie Williams in hopes that his Sinatra-clone act
will create Ring-a-Ding Mania in America, especially when he duets on
"Somethin' Stupid" with dry-ice princess Nicole Kidman. Something
stupid, indeed.</LD>

<LD>Dean Kuipers' comments on Cornelius and Puffy AmiYumi ("Made in

extraordinary eclectic musical banquet characteristic of today's
Japanese pop scene.</LD>
<LD>   Let's hope that future Calendar articles introduce other Japanese
singers like Hikaru Utada (currently enrolled at Columbia
University), Toshinobu Kubota and UA--each of whom has synthesized a
wide range of musical influences (jazz, R&amp;B, Brazilian samba, etc.)
to create songs that deserve a wider American audience.</LD>

<LD>About today's sports announcers, I could not agree more ("They Shoot,
They Bore," by Paul Brownfield, March 31). During last year's
baseball playoffs, Jason Giambi was up at bat with two men on base. A
Fox dunderhead said, "Giambi would be better off hitting a double
rather than a home run to keep the opposing pitcher out there
longer." Obviously the opposing manager might take him out anyway if
he gives up the double, but since when is two runs better than three?</LD>
<LD>   The disease is called "I want to hear myself talkitis." Economy of
speech, knuckleheads. Listen to Vin Scully's call of Kirk Gibson's
winning home run. He let the crowd tell you what was happening. The
idiot from Fox would have said what kind of car he drove by the time
he got to third base. Just shut up and report what you see, not your
high school hallucinations.</LD>

<LD>In "The World Is Not Enough," a speedboat chase on the river Thames
introduces the 1999 James Bond movie in spectacular, jaw-dropping
fashion.</LD>
<LD>   How did director Michael Apted and crew pull off the array of
high-speed stunts that make up this five-minute sequence? It's a
question that is of particular interest to film students.</LD>
<LD>   UCLA film professor Myrl Schreibman not only shows the clip of
this sequence to his students, but thanks to DVD he can have Apted
explain how this complicated chase was constructed as the scene
unfolds.</LD>
<TE>   Like many films in the format, the DVD version of "The World Is
Not Enough" gives viewers the option of hearing commentary about the
film instead of character dialogue. The Bond DVD has two commentary
tracks: one from Apted and another featuring the production designer,
second unit director and composer.</TE>
<TE>   An informal survey of a handful of film schools suggests that DVD
ancillary materials are not yet being widely utilized in the
classroom. But some film professors are finding DVD bonus materials
to be highly valuable instructional aides.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a whole section in the 'X-Men' DVD that shows the
animated storyboard to a sequence where the characters are battling
at the top" of the Statue of Liberty, explains Schreibman, who
teaches directing and producing. "I show this storyboard sequence,
and then we go back and play that section of the film so the students
can see that it exactly follows, shot by shot, the storyboard. Seeing
the storyboard becomes very beneficial to understanding how certain
scenes are constructed in advance."</TE>
<TE>   Evan Chen, head of post-production at the Los Angeles Film School,
says some commentary and bonus material is better at illustrating
aspects of filmmaking than textbooks. Because film is a visual
medium, it is helpful for students to hear and see simultaneously how
and why certain scenes were developed.</TE>
<TE>   Chen uses Sidney Lumet's "Night Falls on Manhattan" as an example
of a DVD's director commentary that has proved valuable in the
classroom. In his commentary, Lumet explains why he built a sound
stage for a specific scene in the 1997 drama rather than shoot it on
location. Starring Andy Garcia, the film involves police corruption.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a crucial moment in the film where one of the characters
breaks down emotionally," Chen says. "It was a really difficult scene
for an actor to pull off. So Lumet explains on the DVD that he didn't
want to risk the scene being ruined" by outside noise such as "a fire
truck passing by with its sirens wailing. This is one of those scenes
where you'll be able to get the actor to re-create the performance
once or twice well and that's it. To try to loop [re-record new
dialogue] in a totally different environment possibly a year after
production has ceased is really, really hard to do."</TE>
<TE>   Janet Bergstrom, an associate professor at UCLA's department of
film, television and digital media, uses DVD commentary and bonus
materials in many of her critical studies courses. She has even
taught a doctoral course devoted to ancillary materials found on
films in the DVD format.</TE>
<TE>   As a final project, Bergstrom required her students in that class
to create, as a group, their commentary for a film on DVD that didn't
already have this feature. The students researched the history of
Alfred Hitchcock's "The Man Who Knew Too Much." They then wrote their
own commentary to the 1956 film, which they presented in class while
the DVD was being shown.</TE>
<TE>   The Criterion Collection, based in Chicago, prides itself on
producing quality ancillary material for many of its DVD titles,
which include such foreign-language classics as Ingmar Bergman's "The
Seventh Seal" and Akira Kurosawa's "The Seven Samurai"--the type of
titles often studied in film history courses.</TE>
<TE>   Criterion recently released Bergman's "Wild Strawberries" on DVD.
The disc includes commentary by Bergman scholar Peter Cowie, a
90-minute documentary on the Swedish director, behind-the-scenes
photos and a new English subtitle translation.</TE>
<TE>   "Our DVDs are directed more toward cinephiles--people who are
looking for a little bit more than what you might find on many
contemporary film DVDs," says R. O'Donnell, Criterion's public
relations director. "When you're dealing with a film like [Carol
Reed's 1949 classic] 'The Third Man,' there's a lot of work to be
done. Materials might be scattered throughout Europe and the United
States."</TE>
<TE>   Ancillary material also varies greatly in its worth to film
students. Aspiring filmmaker John Nein, who recently earned a
master's from UCLA, complains that many studios include "a great deal
of trivial material on DVDs. I suppose the issue is that the material
that is interesting to film students is probably not the kind of
thing that the studios are trying to market to the general public.
We're more interested in how they shot scenes or what cameras they
might have used or how the director might have used actors in certain
scenes."</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of times the bonus material includes the trailer to the
film and then a behind-the-scenes look at the film that masquerades
as a documentary," he continued. "It may include interviews with the
stars, which are sometimes pretty insipid."</TE>

taken it in many more directions than its corporate creators
envisioned.</LD>
<LD>   DVD was conceived as yet another way for studios to squeeze more
revenue out the same movies they had sold and rented to the
saturated--in economic terms, "mature"--videocassette market, by
enhancing the picture and sound quality, and by adding extras such as
filmmaker commentary and outtakes.</LD>
<LD>   Its success has far outstripped expectations, and as a result of
the DVD's booming popularity since its introduction in 1997, the
audience's relationship to movies has changed. The home video was
merely a small-screen version of a movie. The DVD is interactive--so
much so that to the studios' alarm, technically sophisticated film
buffs with a little determination and access to the Internet can
relate to a movie in ways that were impossible only a few years ago,
including moving and removing scenes and characters from a movie.</LD>
<TE>   The implications are profound.</TE>
<TE>   "People have been talking about interactivity for 30 years, yet
nobody knew what it was, except for video games," filmmaker Francis
Ford Coppola says. "The DVD gives the participant the controls over a
movie in a creative manner." Viewers' ability to play with the flow
of narrative storytelling could have far-reaching effects, he
contends. "I hear that people are reediting 'Star Wars' [on their
computers]. Soon they'll start making films that way. It could lead
to new forms of cinema."</TE>
<TE>   Phil Alden Robinson, director of "Field of Dreams" and the
upcoming "The Sum of All Fears," is equally enthusiastic. "Do you
realize that in all of science-fiction literature they never
predicted digital technology and how it would change our lives and
our art? It's an incredible tool," he says.</TE>
<TE>   Not all filmmakers share that assessment. Director Oliver Stone
doesn't see DVD "changing the nature of film, though it will
certainly lead to further exploration. But," he concedes, "you never
know where it's going to go next."</TE>
<TE>   As proved the case with the music video, this ongoing evolution
was the unintended result of technology that was motivated by
commerce. The music video in its infancy functioned mostly as a
marketing tool to drive sales of recorded music and to introduce new
performers. As the medium evolved, it became more sophisticated
stylistically and began to influence commercial, movie and television
production. As audiences became acclimated to music videos'
jump-cutting and nonlinear storytelling techniques, they were able to
absorb information more rapidly and in different ways, allowing
filmmakers to short-cut exposition and action without necessarily
sacrificing clarity.</TE>
<TE>   With the post-theatrical creative options DVD offers, the concept
of a motion picture as a "finished product" is becoming a thing of
the past; filmmakers can tinker and alter their work and offer the
public as many variations of a particular film as the market will
bear.</TE>
<TE>   Stone, for example, is very involved in the DVD versions of his
films, and in many cases they are different--sometimes
drastically--from the theatrical version. The DVD of his 1999
football drama "Any Given Sunday" includes not only deleted scenes,
but unused takes of scenes in the film, allowing viewers to watch
alternate versions of the film.</TE>
<TE>   "They're like novels that are being rewritten," Stone contends.
"The perspective of time gives the filmmaker valuable insight." For
the viewer, he adds, the opportunity to see outtakes and alternate
takes not only shows "why I'm proud of that particular scene, but
sometimes why it wasn't necessary in the finished film."</TE>
<TE>   Callie Khouri, who has just completed her directorial debut,
"Divine Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood," had the DVD release at the
back of her mind throughout editing of the film. "It's a second
chance at life in a way," she says.</TE>
<TE>   Because of running time and dramatic pacing restraints, the
theatrical film, an adaptation of a popular novel, undoubtedly will
omit a lot--some of which will show up in the DVD. Other omissions,
she says, will not and she will have the opportunity to explain why
in her commentary. "Once you see certain scenes that were left out,
you understand why they were not fundamental to telling the story."</TE>
<TE>   Brett Ratner, director of the "Rush Hour" movies, concurs. "I'm
thinking about the DVD as I'm making a movie. Things I'm going to put
on it. Picking takes for the movie and for the DVD. I even remixed
the sound for 'Rush Hour 2' for the DVD, because we have different
kinds of sound equipment in the theater and at home. It was a way to
enhance that experience."</TE>
<TE>   On his current film "Red Dragon," a prequel to "The Silence of the
Lambs," Ratner will have a film student assist on the making-of
documentary, "following me from pre-production to post-production.
It'll be exciting to see the real process, the frustration that's
part of it."</TE>
<TE>   "Moulin Rouge" director Baz Luhrmann not only offers more complete
versions of the film's musical numbers on the DVD, but offers the
dance sequences from different camera angles. "It's a
vision-switching technique that I think gives the viewer the feeling
of making those editing choices," Luhrmann says. "What I like about
DVD is that you can finally do things like that and allow the
audience into our backstage life. I used to hate the video experience
because nothing replaces seeing a movie in the theater. But with
DVDs, you have the possibility of going deeper into the making of the
film."</TE>
<TE>   Similarly, adds Bryan Singer, "as a filmmaker, part of me is a
purist and really embraces the idea of the audience seeing the film
in its original form." The director of "The Usual Suspects," "X-Men"
and its upcoming sequel continues, "That being said, I'm also a film
student at heart, and there's something wonderful about sharing 'the
theater' of being involved in filmmaking. If DVDs had come around
when I was a film student, I would have found them a valuable
education."</TE>
<TE>   Several years ago, Toshiba Electronics and Warner Bros., under the
supervision of home video president Warren Lieberfarb, set out to
develop a digital video format that would better mimic the theatrical
experience and be affordable enough that consumers would buy rather
than rent, maximizing the studios' return.</TE>
<TE>   "The initial impetus was the effect of the digitalization of
television and the advent of the Internet," Lieberfarb says. Those
developments, and video on demand in particular, had the potential of
endangering the lucrative retail home video market in much the same
way that the free downloading of songs eventually hurt the music
business. Lieberfarb went on the offensive, aggressively pushing the
DVD and its acceptance by rival studios as an attractive digital
format that boasted the advantages of the laserdisc but was more
compact and encoded to discourage piracy.</TE>
<TE>   Initially, DVDs attracted buffs and technophiles, says Kelley
Avery, who heads home entertainment at DreamWorks. But with the price
of the players down to as low as $125 each, more consumers have
become familiar with the special features, he says. "Families are
embracing the format."</TE>
<TE>   DVD producer Doug Textor of Canned Interactive points out that the
first "Austin Powers" film sold about 15,000 copies, while the sequel
sold more than 2 million. Disney's special edition of "Snow White and
the Seven Dwarfs" sold 1 million units in just its first day of
release last October.</TE>
<TE>   Sales of DVDs last year reached $4.6 billion, 21/2 times their
2000 revenue, according to the L.A.-based DVD Entertainment Group, a
consortium of the major studios and distributors. There are about 20
million players in homes, a figure that is expected to double by the
end of this year and increase to 75 million by 2006. As audiences
have become accustomed to interacting with DVDs, they also have
become more demanding. When the discs first came out, says Chris
Carey, senior vice president of DVD publicity and promotion at
Disney, consumer surveys listed improved picture and sound quality as
the two most important features.</TE>
<TE>   "The interactive features were way down on the list," he says.
"But six months later, in our follow-up survey, interactivity was
right behind sound and audio."</TE>
<TE>   Steve Deeks, president of Artisan Home Entertainment, adds that
such features as deleted scenes and alternate endings are high in the
company's recent consumer canvassing and have spurred the sales not
only of major titles like "Terminator 2," but smaller films such as
"Suicide Kings," which offered three endings. "Information about
these special features is widely discussed and critiqued on special
Internet chat sites about DVDs," he says. "The news travels quickly."</TE>
<TE>   Observes Peter Staddon, senior vice president of marketing for
20th Century Fox Home Entertainment: "Say there are 25 million DVD
buyers out there right now. All of them have become film critics.
They're looking and listening at films far more critically. At one
time, people would rent a movie and think nothing more of it. Now
they look at deleted scenes, making-of documentaries and other
features. They've become far more involved in the process."</TE>
<TE>   "The DVD format," says Rob Minkoff, director of the "Stuart
Little" movies, "begs a larger question about the role movies play in
people's lives, whether they want to be told stories or play a larger
role of interacting with it and telling their own story."</TE>
<TE>   To that end, for the "Stuart Little 2" disc, Minkoff toyed with
the idea of using a type of software that allows the viewer to
rewrite lines of dialogue.</TE>
<TE>   Just as Internet sites such as Ain't It Cool News involve
consumers in movies from the script and preview stage, the DVD allows
that interactive experience to continue beyond a film's theatrical
release. In the past, with the exception of the occasional director's
cut or unrated version, once a movie was released, that was the final
version. Only cinephiles explored the process further, trying to
reconstitute a complete version of Erich von Stroheim's mangled
silent film "Greed," or deleted musical and dramatic sequences in
George Cukor's "A Star Is Born."</TE>
<TE>   From Singer's perspective, "a film is never finished, it's merely
abandoned at a point when you have to call it a day and release it.
The DVD provides the opportunity to expose the audience to certain
elements that weren't able to be fully exploited ... or were
inappropriate for the theatrical release."</TE>
<TE>   Now the average consumer can pick up the DVD marketed as a
"bootleg" cut of Cameron Crowe's "Almost Famous," which includes a
half-hour of additional footage, some of which requires
interactivity. An outtake scene without a soundtrack instructs the
viewer to cue a CD of Led Zeppelin's "Stairway to Heaven" to the
picture. This was Crowe's way around the fact that he ultimately
couldn't get the rights to the song and had to remove the scene.</TE>
<TE>   Coppola's DVD versions of "The Godfather" films are yet another
variation on the classic American gangster saga, different from the
originals and even from the various versions that have been presented
on television over the years. The sci-fi classic "Blade Runner" has
already been seen in several permutations since its release in the
early '80s, and director Ridley Scott is preparing yet another for
release on DVD this year.</TE>
<TE>   "Interactivity empowers both the filmmaker and the consumer," says
independent DVD producer Van Ling, who has worked on new versions of
James Cameron's "Terminator 2" and an expanded cut of the director's
"The Abyss" and George Lucas' "Star Wars: Episode I The Phantom
Menace." "Now we have the chance to interact with storytelling and
filmmaking. What's starting to happen is that the DVD has gone from
being just another ancillary avenue to becoming part of the
filmmaking process itself."</TE>
<TE>   When he was preparing laserdisc versions of Alfred Hitchcock
films, producer Laurent Bouzereau approached the extra materials from
a scholarly standpoint. With the advent of DVD, he says, "I've made
the experience more commercial and entertaining, using the same
amount of quality and information. The level of interactive material
has grown incredibly. It's happened so fast that it's a little
frightening."</TE>
<TE>   As consumer demand for extras increases, studios are becoming more
involved much earlier in the process. Filmmakers, who used to be
reluctant to participate in a movie's afterlife, now also insist on
helping plan the DVD. For instance: M. Night Shyamalan has been
working on a third film for Disney, "Signs." Plans for the DVD were
underway shortly after the film was greenlighted, so that the film's
creator could supervise as it followed the movie through the script
development process, storyboarding and other facets of production.</TE>
<TE>   Although newer titles are the format's financial backbone, the
relatively low cost of creating DVDs is a boon to film preservation
as well. Industry executives declined to discuss production costs,
but one executive confided that "it's not in the millions." For
Warner Bros.' Lieberfarb, it provides an economic incentive to
restore library titles and archival material (AOL Time Warner's
library includes thousands of Warner Bros., New Line Cinema and
pre-1986 MGM titles).</TE>
<TE>   The 20th Century Fox DVD "Marilyn Monroe: The Final Days," part of
a five-disc retrospective of her films, dipped into the studio's
vault to offer a look at 37 minutes of footage on her final,
unfinished "Something's Got to Give," the movie she was working on
when she died in 1962.</TE>
<TE>   The sophisticated digital remastering of visual and sound elements
on "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs" and "Citizen Kane" approximates
the original theatrical prints issued more than half a century ago.
In addition, those DVDs provide historical documents and drawings,
critical assessments and, where possible, commentaries from the
filmmakers. Both "Snow White" and "Kane" interweave archival audio
comments from Walt Disney and Orson Welles, respectively.</TE>
<TE>   The biggest potential growth area for DVDs, say home entertainment
executives, is family titles like "Snow White" and the deluxe
editions of "Shrek" and "Dr. Seuss' How the Grinch Stole Christmas,"
which have hours of additional material--new footage, video games,
Internet links and more. Because children often watch favorite movies
repeatedly, the hours of extra material provide more entertainment
value and--for better or worse--may alter the neophyte's perception
of what a movie is.</TE>
<TE>   Director Robinson adds that part of the unrealized potential of
DVDs is to show a much broader version of how a movie gets made. "I
would like to see them bring in more of the people who are involved,"
like the cinematographers and screenwriters, "so that the DVD
commentary is not so one sided. It would be cubist in a way to show
the film through different eyes. But so far we've only scratched the
surface (of what a DVD can provide)."</TE>
<TE>   One danger in the DVD era is that as the value-added universe
expands, the extras may become more interesting to audiences than the
actual movie. Some making-of documentaries already are more
compelling than the finished product. A prime example is HBO's
"Project Greenlight" series that chronicled the experience of
first-time writer-director Pete Jones while he made "Stolen Summer."
Likewise, if studios cram DVDs with inane filler, they risk
alienating audiences. Deleted scenes from a masterpiece like "The
Godfather" are one thing, but will anyone want to see excised footage
from "Bubble Boy"?</TE>
<TE>   "There is a risk of completely demystifying the [filmmaking]
process," producer Bouzereau says, "which is why it [DVD production]
needs to be controlled by the filmmaker." But it is already tightly
controlled. Behind-the-scenes footage and commentary provide the
official story on the making of a film. Production problems, flaws
and gossip rarely surface in these expanded looks, although the
"Cleopatra" DVD offers fairly juicy insight into studio extravagance
and star misbehavior.</TE>
<TE>   At their very best, producer Ling says, DVDs have the capacity to
function as "film school in a can," heightening viewers'
understanding of the collaborative process, from a script's first
draft through to the final (or not so final) cut.</TE>
<TE>   "I learned how to make movies from watching the Criterion movies
on laserdiscs and hearing directors speak about their process,"
Ratner offers. "It made it all seem attainable, reachable."</TE>
<TE>   The abundance of information and opportunities the technology
offers could serve as a spur to creativity, Coppola surmises, freeing
future generations from the constraints of the present-day studio
system. "Once computers become married with film, the form becomes
promiscuous," Coppola says, "and that can bring about new ways of
making movies that the studios can't control."</TE>
<TE>   New low-cost digital technology gives enthusiasts the chance to be
desktop filmmakers, shooting new footage and combining it with
existing movies. While DVDs are encoded to safeguard against piracy
and copying, and the studios vigorously pursue civil and criminal
proceedings against people they catch, more sophisticated computer
users still find ways around that. With DVD-writing software, and
illegal but fairly easy to find encryption decoders, not only can
adventurous viewers reedit movies like "Star Wars" on their
computers--removing "characters from a movie that they don't like,"
as Coppola suggests--but there's the possibility of creating entirely
new movies from existing ones.</TE>
<TE>   One way would be through sampling, in the same way Janet Jackson
incorporated Joni Mitchell's "Big Yellow Taxi" into her tune "Got Til
It's Gone" or Will Smith borrowed elements of Patrice Rushen's
"Forget Me Nots" for "Men in Black's" title song. Of course, this
also is technically illegal unless the rights are secured, but the
creative possibilities exist.</TE>
<TE>   Along these lines, Khouri offers some interesting ideas. "You
could do the whole Woody Allen oeuvre, especially since he often uses
many of the same actors, and make one film out of it," she says. "Or
have some fun with the Coen brothers' movies, though I can't imagine
having more fun with them than they already do."</TE>
<TE>   She encourages film enthusiasts: "I figure when I'm done with my
film--have at it."</TE>
<TE>   Her reasoning? "I'd rather see kids learning about storytelling
and structure than just playing video games all the time."</TE>
<TE>   Of course, just because the pencil was invented doesn't mean
anyone who picked one up could write "Moby-Dick." Desktop filmmaking
tools may never produce another "Citizen Kane." But at the very
least, Stone says, the fact that many filmmakers are sharing their
ideas and creative journey--from what they include to what they take
out--with DVD viewers will have a profound effect on future
filmmakers. "Just think: If Beethoven had left extensive notes on the
writing of his symphonies, it could have inspired a future musician
to come up with ideas he might not otherwise have thought of."</TE>

<HD>Leaving His Handprint on the Machine Age</HD>
<DH>In his way, prolific multitasker William Morris led a
revolt against industrialism.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LEAH OLLMAN</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>William Morris died only once, although he lived, it was said, the
lives of 10 men. The bearish Englishman (1834-96) made a lasting
impression wherever he went, and in every field he
entered--literature, design, business and politics--he left an
enduring mark.</LD>
<LD>   More than a century after his death, Morris' importance as the
father of the Arts and Crafts movement continues to grow. The
Huntington Library, Art Collections and Botanical Gardens purchased,
for $5 million, a vast collection of his work in 1999, ensuring him a
permanently high profile in Southern California. The collection,
amassed over 30 years by the late Sanford and Helen Berger of Carmel,
spans all of Morris' professional output, from his published writings
to his firm's early stained-glass windows, through decades of
wallpaper and textile patterns up to the products of his final labor
of love, the Kelmscott Press. The Huntington now stands as the
foremost center of William Morris material in the United States, and
the third most substantial in the world.</LD>
<TE>   On Tuesday, the Huntington opens its first exhibition culled from
the collection. It's a sampler, an appetizer to ready the palate for
a comprehensive, more contextualized survey opening in the fall of
2003. Curated by Anne Mallek, the collection's primary cataloger,
"William Morris: Creating the Useful and the Beautiful" contains some
70 objects produced by Morris and his workshops. Alongside a luminous
stained-glass window depicting the winged figure of Liberty hangs
Edward Burne-Jones' full-scale preparatory cartoon for it. Near the
display of a sheet of wallpaper teeming with tendrils rests one of
the hand-carved woodblocks used in its printing. A rare dye book with
hand-inscribed recipes and instructions accompanies examples of
Morris and Company's richly patterned textiles.</TE>
<TE>   "The interest with Morris is always in exploring the process,"
Mallek explains, "because in everything he did, there's so much
attention to detail, to historic examples, to the idea that each
product should be handcrafted as much as possible. Not that he
rejected machines completely, but he wanted there to be some kind of
human control with the finished product."</TE>
<TE>   For Morris, every stage of production reflected his commitment to
personal and social betterment. Pleasure in life, he felt, derives
largely from the expression of natural, creative impulses. Everyone
possesses those impulses, but industrial culture--on a revolutionary
rise during Morris' time--suppresses them, preventing the common man
from experiencing dignified, nourishing work. Machinery deadened
labor and rendered it monotonous. Morris supported industrial
advances insofar as they relieved workers of dull, repetitive tasks,
but was appalled at the way technology distanced workers from the
products they made. The increasing specialization of labor, he felt,
yielded inequality among men, class differences that he spent the
last decade of his life battling against as a socialist activist.</TE>
<TE>   As a young man, he intended to join the clergy. Soon after he
entered Oxford in 1853, though, he hooked up with the artistically
inclined Burne-Jones, and began reading the art historian John
Ruskin, finding resonance with his ideas on the beauty of the Gothic
and the need to morally regenerate the culture by reuniting art and
labor.</TE>
<TE>   Both Morris and Burne-Jones turned their attention to architecture
briefly, inspired by medieval craftsmanship, then to painting, which
remained Burne-Jones' primary focus. Morris, not very promising as a
painter, met better reception as a poet, publishing his first volume
at age 24.</TE>
<TE>   A shared passion for the decorative arts, especially as practiced
in earlier eras, brought Morris, Burne-Jones, the Pre-Raphaelite
painters Dante Gabriel Rossetti, Ford Madox Brown and several others
to form a business in 1861. Included in the show is a one-of-a-kind
logbook that documents the firm's initial commitment to present its
designs to the public anonymously, in the model of a medieval craft
guild. That resolve faded quickly. Some artists proved more
marketable than others, and recognizing this did wonders for the
business' bottom line.</TE>
<TE>   The company thrived, following Morris' serial passions. At first,
stained-glass window commissions dominated, but eventually inroads
were made into a range of home furnishings. Typical of the firm's
graceful designs is a section of wallpaper featuring birds and
twining pomegranate branches against an indigo background.</TE>
<TE>   "The idea was simple, organic growth, so that your eye would
always be led onward and upward," Mallek says. Morris "always wanted
meaning in his patterns. He didn't believe in imitation. He wanted
you to look at a pattern and it would remind you of something in
nature, so you would have to conjure that flower or plant in your own
mind and become part of the creative process. In his words, he wanted
to stimulate and elevate the mind."</TE>
<TE>   In 1875, divisions within the company forced a split, and Morris
took charge of his own firm, named Morris and Co., which ran a
thriving shop for home decorating materials in London. In 1891, he
embarked on his last business venture, the Kelmscott Press, which
published 66 books, from the works of Chaucer to contemporary poetry
and fiction. Burne-Jones did most of the illustrations, while Morris
did the rest, designing typefaces, borders and initial letters.
Second in importance only to the beautiful house, Morris felt, was
the beautiful book, an experience for the hand and eye, not just the
mind.</TE>
<TE>   "To enjoy good houses and good books in self-respect and decent
comfort, seems to me to be the pleasurable end towards which all
societies of human beings ought now to struggle," he declared.</TE>
<TE>   Although the exhibition is divided into separate sections for
stained glass, textiles, wallpaper and printed books, Morris, a
consummate multi-tasker, had his hands in most of these at once.</TE>
<TE>   "He was moving on from one thing to another, but he was retaining
at the same time," Mallek explains. "At the same time he was a poet,
he was also working on a wallpaper, a textile, carving illustrations
for one of his books, probably approving designs for stained-glass
windows."</TE>
<TE>   Most remarkably, he learned each craft thoroughly before it went
into production. He never designed anything that he did not know how
to produce with his own hands--which, Mallek notes, were often
stained blue from the indigo dye he favored.</TE>
<TE>   This hands-on involvement was, for him, a political act, a gesture
of resistance against the dehumanizing trends of industrialism.</TE>
<TE>   "Socialism was a necessary development from working with these
crafts," Mallek says. "As he worked in each craft, he learned about
the industries at the time. He tried to set up his workshops as
working examples of how things should be."</TE>
<TE>   Once he committed himself to the socialist cause, he poured his
robust energies into it, giving lectures, writing articles, designing
membership cards, even composing chants to be sung at meetings.
Because of his own personal wealth, Morris' advocacy for the common
man rang hypocritical to some, comical to others. He was accused of
living a contradiction, practicing a "comfy" form of socialism, one
that didn't require any sacrifices.</TE>
<TE>   Whether glorifying the past or campaigning for a better future,
Morris remained an idealist. He fleshed out his utopian dream in his
1890 novel "News From Nowhere." The narrator goes to bed one evening
in the late 19th century and wakes up in the early 21st. What he
finds in this shocking new age is that "people are living close to
nature and capitalism has been eradicated," Mallek says. "No money is
exchanged. Everything that is made is useful and beautiful. There are
no museums. There's no need for them because beautiful objects are
all around."</TE>
<TE>   How would Morris, the missionary for beauty, react if he were to
be magically transported to the present, to the disembodied culture
of the electronic age? Mallek laughs.</TE>
<TE>   "He probably would have a heart attack. He wouldn't be able to
take it all in."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>As Tears for Fears, childhood friends Curt Smith and Roland Orzabal
were one of the biggest acts from England in the '80s, but for most
of the '90s they didn't even speak to each other.</LD>
<LD>   Now they're back together for the 2000s, planning a new album and
drawing interest from several major record labels, with a deal
expected to be signed in the next few weeks. Plans are to record this
summer and then do a full tour.</LD>
<LD>   But the two still have differences.</LD>
<TE>   "We hadn't spoken for 10 years," Smith says. "No, it was about
nine years," Orzabal counters later, when told what Smith said.</TE>
<TE>   Other than that, they're back in sync. They last worked together
on tour following 1989's "Seeds of Love" album, and Orzabal kept the
group name for a while, releasing an album in 1995. They started
writing together again last year and in February spent three weeks in
a Ventura studio recording elaborate demo versions of six new songs.</TE>
<TE>   The new songs recall the lush sounds and introspective themes of
such TFF hits as "Everybody Wants to Rule the World" and "Sowing the
Seeds of Love," but without nostalgia and from the perspective of two
40-year-olds rather than twentysomethings.</TE>
<TE>   "The last thing I wanted to do was make an '80s throwback record,"
says Smith, who has lived in Los Angeles in recent years. "It was bad
enough at the time." Orzabal, who lives in England, agrees, but
stresses that they still want to sound like TFF.</TE>
<TE>   "We are conscious of the nostalgia," he says. "I've been
struggling with my own work to change the sound of what I do. But
there are expectations. We have to be careful to make it sound fresh
and give people the sense of the brand."</TE>
<TE>   That they're working together at all, let along getting along
well, is a big development.</TE>
<TE>   "When you've worked together for 16 years, it's like a marriage,"
Smith says. "We weren't agreeing anymore, so you get mad and pick on
the person closest to you. We ended up fighting for fighting's sake.
We didn't like each other anymore."</TE>
<TE>   The reunion was effected not out of musical concern, but due to
some issues involving jointly owned business concerns in England.
Once the door was open, though, music was a natural topic of
discussion. It took a little work for them to come to a place they
agreed on that, though.</TE>
<TE>   "Curt was very into songs that would work on an acoustic guitar,
very stripped down," Orzabal says. "I'd been getting away from that,
getting into electronic structures and away from the song form. There
was a little bit of a battle. But I started writing songs. I had had
my head in a techno hole, very European, and then all of a sudden I
was coming up with catchy melodies which I hadn't done in years. And
it was very refreshing."</TE>
<TE>   The demos are being shopped by Bruce Kirkland, a former Capitol
Records executive vice president who also manages the Dandy Warhols
and the Bangles (who are finishing a new album themselves). Kirkland
says interest has been strong because of the duo's history and its
possibility as a thoughtful alternative to prepackaged teen pop.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a general perception with some artists that come back
that there is a Rip Van Winkle syndrome," Kirkland says. Tears for
Fears "is not like that. Record executives we've been talking to are
being very serious about their commitment. Based on the nature of the
music we put on the table, people understand it could be a
significant record."</TE>
<TE>   COLLECT 'EM ALL: It would be pretty much impossible to see all
60-plus acts scheduled to appear at the Coachella Valley Music and
Arts Festival in Indio on April 27 and 28. But you could get all of
their trading cards.</TE>
<TE>   Event promoter Goldenvoice has printed a series of baseball-style
cards featuring color photos of the acts, from such headliners as
Bjork and Oasis to DJs Baba G and Z-Trip. The cards will be given out
starting this weekend for as long as supplies last outside L.A.-area
concerts and clubs.</TE>
<TE>   "We tested then outside a small show recently to see if kids would
like the idea," says Paul Tollett, Goldenvoice president. "And a lot
of them were asking for more than one, so we may blow through them
pretty fast."</TE>
<TE>   The cards don't have an equivalent of the statistics found on the
backs of sports trading cards. Instead, they bear the Coachella
lineup.</TE>
<TE>   "We thought of putting discographies or something on them,"
Tollett says. "But the main reason we were doing them was to serve as
fliers for the shows. We wanted them to be fun, and I like that
they're small, easy to pass out and people can put them in their
pockets."</TE>
<TE>   SMALL FACES: Rob Zombie will have to find another place to perform
without his big stage production. Plans for him to headline the
Ozzfest second stage this summer--in daylight and without the props
and effects that mark his regular shows--have been scrapped, with
Zombie now moving to the tour's main stage with a full-production
set. The move fills the hole left by the breakup of the short-lived
band featuring former Soundgarden singer Chris Cornell and former
members of Rage Against the Machine.... The Violent Femmes' 1982
debut album--the only album to get platinum status (sales of more
than a million) without once cracking Billboard's weekly Top 200
album sales chart--is being reissued in an expanded, two-CD edition
with 26 additional tracks, 23 of them never before released. The
first disc will include the original album, plus six demo versions
and five rarities. The second disc will be all live, including some
songs that the band never recorded in the studio. Rhino Records will
release the album June 18.... Former Dog's Eye View leader Peter
Stuart has signed to Vanguard Records with a solo album, due Aug. 6,
featuring backing vocals from Moon Zappa and Adam Duritz of Counting
Crows. The sessions were produced by Andrew Williams.</TE>

<LD>   NEIL YOUNG</LD>
<LD>   "Are You Passionate?"</LD>
<TE>   Reprise</TE>
<TE>   Neil Young: Soul Man? He opens his new album (due in stores
Tuesday) with a variation of the introduction to Booker T. &amp; the MG's
"Time Is Tight," raising the question: Is this just another side trip
for the mercurial rocker, like his rockabilly or technoid
incarnations of the past?</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps, but in recent albums Young had become--of all
things--predictable, flipping between rust-less garage rock with
Crazy Horse and rustic, "Harvest"-style folk-rock. With backing by
organist Booker T. Jones and MG's bassist Donald "Duck" Dunn, "Are
You Passionate?" proves no mere diversion but an inspired set in its
own right.</TE>
<TE>   On paper, Young's craggy voice (he's no Otis Redding) and raw
guitar (he can't match MG's player Steve Cropper) seem at odds with
subtle '60s funk. But as with all things Young, it's feeling that
counts. Even the most obvious stabs at old Stax blueprints skirt
cheesy nostalgia, with the leader and his cohorts able to keep their
distinct characteristics at the fore without stepping on each other.</TE>
<TE>   The trick may be that he's not afraid to be corny. As he sings in
the closing "She's a Healer," "All I got is a broken heart and I
don't try to hide it when I play guitar."</TE>
<TE>   -- Steve Hochman</TE>

<TE>   BONNIE RAITT</TE>
<TE>   "Silver Lining"</TE>
<TE>   Capitol</TE>
<TE>   Raitt continues to explore common threads in music across cultures
with her 16th album (in stores Tuesday). Yet "Silver Lining" is no
academic exercise, but a varied collection incorporating her
trademark Delta-influenced blues-rock, African styles, New Orleans
boogie and modern adult-pop elements.</TE>
<TE>   Co-produced, like 1998's "Fundamental," by Raitt and
minimalist-ambience masters Mitchell Froom and Tchad Blake, the album
reflects her need to venture beyond the tried and true, at least
musically. The lyrics tend toward her usual life 'n' love
ruminations, by turns playful and reflective but ultimately upbeat.
She sounds somber yet hopeful on the David Gray-penned title track,
which puts her voice in an unusually stark setting with pulsing,
looped beats and meandering piano before blossoming into a folk-pop
swirl.</TE>
<TE>   She also offers a version of Zimbabwean artist Oliver Mtukudzi's
gimme-strength ballad "Hear Me Lord," and collaborates with Malian
songwriter Habib Koite on the spare "Back Around," a smoky
karma's-gonna-get-ya number with a rustic, country-blues feel.</TE>
<TE>   Raitt's longtime touring band moves nimbly in these different
directions, and the addition of keyboardist Jon Cleary augments the
funky N'Awlins-ism of such numbers as the vampy "Fool's Game" and
"Gnawin' on It," a slightly naughty celebration of long-term
relationships. Adventurousness rocks, indeed.</TE>
<TE>   Natalie Nichols</TE>
<TE>   ****</TE>
<TE>   CABAS</TE>
<TE>   "Cabas"</TE>
<TE>   EMI Latin</TE>
<TE>   He's 23, curly-headed and baby-faced, looking pleased with himself
on his debut album cover, his chocolate skin faintly glowing, wrists
wrapped in indigenous beads and feathers. Inside, the music is as
fresh and self-assured as his image.</TE>
<TE>   Singer-songwriter-pianist Andres Cabas, who goes only by his
punchy surname, is the newest rage in his native Colombia, a place
already roiling with provocative talent. He's edgier than Carlos
Vives, more folkloric than Juanes and more socially insightful than
Shakira. Drawing from centuries of multiethnic crosscurrents flowing
through Barranquilla, his Caribbean coastal hometown, Cabas has
produced a dramatically original and joyous work.</TE>
<TE>   This is one of those seamlessly sequenced albums, an irresistible
groove running through 15 melodic and rhythmically modulated tracks.
It carries you along like a jungle river, startling at one turn,
enchanting at the next, a delightful discovery the whole way. Cabas
writes most of the tunes, an Afro-Caribbean cornucopia of cumbia,
porro, raspon and chande rhythms.</TE>
<TE>   He can be sharply satirical, as in "Himno a la mamita," a hymn to
empty-headed babes and the idiots who idolize them, and he can be
realistically romantic in "Fiesta de Tambores," an exuberant plea for
a beautiful dancer to "fill me with your rhythm, fill me with faith."
He closes with "A veces soy feliz," an irresistible affirmation of
life in the face of his nation's violence. There must be hope for any
place that gives us music as vital as this. Agustin Gurza</TE>

<TE>   CORNERSHOP</TE>
<TE>   "Handcream for a Generation"</TE>
<TE>   Beggars Group</TE>
<TE>   Madonna gave us "Music." Now this London duo brings us "Music Plus
1." This track from Cornershop's fourth album (due Tuesday) may not
be a deliberate comment on the Madonna hit, but its exuberant blend
of stuttering dance beat, pulsating techno, squishy electro-funk,
jangling guitar and noisy bits definitely moves pop another step
forward.</TE>
<TE>   Like Beck or Soul Coughing, Cornershop has always fused disparate
elements, but "Handcream for a Generation" builds on the
accomplishments of 1997's "When I Was Born for the 7th Time," where
lead singer-songwriter and producer Tjinder Singh really took command
of his impossibly eclectic style. He treats pop like some cosmic
vending machine, casually selecting flavors of the past (soul man
Otis Clay sings on the propulsive introduction, "Heavy Soup") or
present (New York turntablist Rob Swift co-produces two tracks)
according to whim.</TE>
<TE>   With a social conscience and a wicked sense of fun, Singh and
guitarist Ben Ayres take a short-attention-span-friendly trip through
ever-shifting soundscapes dotted with such Punjabi staples as sitar
and tabla, along with squiggly electronica, vampy glam-rock, funk
riffs, dub reggae, soul grooves and more. There's even sprawling
psychedelia on the 14-minute "Spectral Mornings," featuring Oasis'
Noel Gallagher on guitar. Although these lush tracks may at any
instant recall Booker T., the Velvet Underground, XTC, T. Rex or
countless other acts, they're indisputably Cornershop. And
indescribably delicious. N.N.</TE>

<TE>   GOO GOO DOLLS</TE>
<TE>   "Gutterflowers"</TE>
<TE>   Warner Bros.</TE>
<TE>   What's been on the Goo Goo Dolls' minds since the trio's hit album
"Dizzy Up the Girl" was released in 1998? The answer may be in the
title of this new set's second song, "Think About Me." Every song
(eight written by guitarist John Rzeznik, four by bassist Robby
Takac) is in the first person, prominently featuring the words "I"
and "me." Even Rzeznik's titularly outward-reaching "What Do You
Need?" is more about the singer's feelings than about those of his
romantic partner.</TE>
<TE>   Yet for all the narcissism, the music on "Gutterflowers" (in
stores Tuesday) is relatively anonymous, following tried-and-true
formulas. That said, the Dolls' approach has served as a template for
such fellow middle-of-the-roaders as Matchbox Twenty and Train, and
the group may be the best of the bunch. The guitar-based trio is more
streamlined, less frilly than the others, although added keyboards
and guitars almost undo that advantage in places.</TE>
<TE>   While there are no innovations here, there are a few twists.
"Sympathy" juxtaposes seething resentment with acoustic, melodic
folksiness. "What Do You Need?" goes for the bigger, Bush-like rock
sound. "Truth Is a Whisper" builds on a Police-like structure, though
with more arena-rock gloss.</TE>
<TE>   The familiarity of the music and themes, though, is also the
appeal. There always has been and always will be a large market for
this, and the Dolls deliver. S.H.</TE>
<TE>   In Brief</TE>
<TE>   *** Jaz-O &amp; the Immobilarie Family Present, "Kingz Kounty,"
Rancore. More than a decade after introducing Jay-Z to the rap world,
the man formerly known as the Jaz returns as the brains behind this
potent collection. The newly christened Jaz-O benefits from a
commanding voice and imaginative lyrics that cover the gamut of rap
street topics. Clever, punch-line-laced lyrics from Jaz-O's
supporting cast (including Jay-Z) and wicked production from Zukhits,
DJ Premier and others make this album an underground gem.</TE>
<TE>   Soren Baker</TE>
<TE>   *** Face to Face, "How to Ruin Everything," Vagrant. A decade into
his tenure with Face to Face, leader Trever Keith still believes in
the insurrectionary power of punk. On the veteran L.A. trio's new
album (in stores Tuesday), Keith's voice rings out with righteous
indignation at the injustices of consumerist America, while the band
dutifully pounds away at the left-of-tuneful melodies. It's nothing
that hasn't been done before, but Keith's just smart enough to make
his passion count for something other than modish, "down with the
man" attitude.</TE>
<TE>   Marc Weingarten</TE>
<TE>   *** Tweet, "Southern Hummingbird," the Goldmind Inc./Elektra.
Having Missy Elliott and Timbaland in your musical corner pays
dividends. Both help make the titillating "Oops (Oh My)," the first
single from this longtime collaborator, into a rousing success. The
rest of the Atlanta singer's debut collection traverses less upbeat
territory, as the heavenly voiced siren explores the pain of betrayal
and heartbreak. S.B.</TE>

<DH>The casino-rich Pechanga Indians seek a partnership with
the struggling Southwest Museum that isn't just about money.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRISTOPHER REYNOLDS</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>TEMECULA</DL>
<LD>When last seen in the pages of Helen Hunt Jackson's celebrated
historical romance "Ramona," the Indians of this valley were a
desperate lot: poor, illiterate, first subjugated by the Spanish,
then the Mexicans, then evicted and dumped in a dry canyon by the
U.S. government.</LD>
<LD>   But one glance at that dry canyon these days tells you that world
has been upended. The Pechanga tribe of Temecula Valley is among the
valley's leading employers, netting millions of gambling dollars
every month, lobbying in Washington, steadily adding acreage. When
Gary DuBois, cultural resources director for the Pechangas, stands
beside a particularly handsome stretch of open land near the tribe's
new casino-hotel project, a certain twinkle creeps into his eyes.</LD>
<LD>   "You could put a museum there," DuBois says half-casually, as if
the idea has just occurred to him.</LD>
<TE>   In fact, DuBois and other leaders of the 1,468-member tribe have
been talking about that prospect for a year now. If the tribal
membership approves and the plans pan out, the tribe will build a
museum here, roughly midway between Los Angeles and San Diego, and
borrow thousands of artifacts from the Southwest Museum, an
underfunded but widely respected institution founded by Los Angeles
collectors in the early days of the 20th century.</TE>
<TE>   Not everybody is ready to embrace the idea. But together, the
Pechangas' money and the Southwest's collection could yield one of
the foremost Native American museums in the country--a historical
postscript that Jackson could never have imagined during her days
here in 1883.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't want the casino to define who we are," says DuBois, who
began the talks with a cold call to the Southwest Museum's executive
director, Duane King, a year ago.</TE>
<TE>   "They have a very clear vision of what they're doing," King says.
"They want to tell their story."</TE>
<TE>   By the time the first Spanish missionaries appeared in the
Temecula Valley at the end of the 18th century, Indians had lived
here for an estimated 10,000 years. In the decades following the
Spaniards' arrival, missionaries pressed Indians into labor and
newcomers grabbed up more and more land, imposing and adjusting laws
as Mexico won independence from Spain in 1821, and as the U.S.
wrested control of California from Mexico in the 1840s.</TE>
<TE>   As the U.S. expanded westward, the pressure on Indian lands
intensified. In the 1870s and 1880s, U.S. lawmen seized most of the
land held by the Temecula Indians.</TE>
<TE>   In her novel, Jackson describes the eviction, although she spelled
the tribe's name slightly differently.</TE>
<TE>   "Where is Pachanga?" asks the heroine, Ramona, hearing of the
tribe's dispersal.</TE>
<TE>   "About three miles from Temecula, a little sort of canyon,"
answers her lover, Alessandro.</TE>
<TE>   "I told the people they'd better move over there; the land did not
belong to anybody, and perhaps they could make a living there," he
continues. "There isn't any water; that's the worst of it."</TE>
<TE>   Jackson's novel, published in 1884, was intended to provoke
national shame and reform--a sort of western counterpart to Harriet
Beecher Stowe's 1852 antislavery novel, "Uncle Tom's Cabin." Instead,
the love story in the foreground of "Ramona" largely outshone the
cultural politics in the background, and the book wound up fueling
westward tourism.</TE>
<TE>   Its romanticized legacy is revived every spring, when hundreds of
actors and thousands of Jackson enthusiasts gather in an open-air
amphitheater near Hemet for weekend stagings of the annual "Ramona
Pageant." The pageant--billed as "America's oldest and
longest-running outdoor drama!"--has endured since the 1920s. This
year's production premieres April 20.</TE>
<TE>   The Pechangas don't participate. But some of the pageant's fans,
if they have a weakness for slot machines or card games, may
nevertheless be playing a role in modern Pechanga history. The
tribe's reservation and casino lie about 20 miles southwest of the
outdoor stage.</TE>
<TE>   The reservation covers 4,500 acres of dusty foothills. The first
glimpse most outsiders get of the reservation is the parking lot and
the jumble of low-slung buildings that make up the current casino
area. Day after day, cars and buses roll up, discharging gamblers,
many of them retirement age.</TE>
<TE>   Beyond the parking lot rises an economic engine that's likely to
propel the Pechanga economy well into the future: a 522-room hotel
and casino, being built at a cost of roughly $270 million. It will
replace the existing facilities upon its opening this summer.
Sand-colored and designed in a restrained Southwestern style, it
already looms as one of the tallest buildings in the valley.</TE>
<TE>   The reservation's first casino, which opened in 1995, consisted of
three trailers featuring card games and five filled with slot
machines. Now 2,000 slots sound round the clock, and the tribe has
more employees than members, about 1,700 total, 115 of them
Pechangas.</TE>
<TE>   How much difference has the casino made?</TE>
<TE>   By the 1960s, the reservation's population had dipped below 100.
As recently as 1993, the Pechanga tribal government had one paid
employee. Tribe spokesman Russell "Butch" Murphy remembers sitting in
an empty field near the road in 1994, "running a swap meet, about
eight to 10 vendors. That was one of our big ventures."</TE>
<TE>   "Big" has a different meaning now, and relations with the outside
world have evolved. Last year, the tribe reported that it set aside
$58 million in revenue for reservation infrastructure, health care,
housing and education. (The Pechangas decline to say how much money
is dispersed in checks to individual families.)</TE>
<TE>   Murphy notes that the tribe covers the cost of private school for
any tribal children whose families want it, and at the moment is
subsidizing the studies of 62 tribal members in college, grad school
or trade school.</TE>
<TE>   For the last two years, Temecula's Chamber of Commerce has held
its installation dinner on the reservation, and a Riverside County
Sheriff's Department spokeswoman says that by any community's
standards, the crime rate on the Pechanga Reservation is "very low."</TE>
<TE>   The advantages of adding a museum to this rapidly improving
neighborhood, boosters say, could be educational and economic: Apart
from allowing the Pechangas to celebrate their long-besieged culture,
a museum would diversify the tribal business empire, adding a
highbrow feature to augment the new casino-hotel complex. A museum
wouldn't hurt in the campaign to woo overnight national and
international visitors either.</TE>
<TE>   But filling that museum with borrowed objects from the Southwest
collection means placing a hefty measure of trust in people off the
reservation, and in Pechanga history, that's usually been a formula
for failure. DuBois' answer to that is to look at it in a new way.</TE>
<TE>   "Pechanga is like a microcosm of Indians nationwide--the loss of
culture, the social coping mechanisms that were destroyed by the
dominant culture," DuBois says. "All the things we went through--just
about every tribe in the country can understand. So we'd like to use
the Southwest collection to tell that story."</TE>
<TE>   The Pechanga cultural resources department--a few offices and
several display cases full of old baskets and stoneware--is housed in
a ranch house on reservation-adjacent land the tribe bought up a few
years ago. At the screen door stands DuBois in shades and a baseball
hat, ready to give a reservation tour.</TE>
<TE>   "To know where you're going," says DuBois, taking the wheel of a
new Ford pickup, "you have to know where you came from."</TE>
<TE>   DuBois, 45, has experience on the reservation and off. He listens
to the Eagles, carries a Palm Pilot and patiently spells out the word
that the Pechanga used for themselves before the Spaniards came:
Payomkawichum, which means "the western people."</TE>
<TE>   Like the majority of the tribe's members, DuBois lived
off-reservation (in San Bernardino County) as a child but often
visited on Sundays for tribal meetings in the old schoolhouse.</TE>
<TE>   (DuBois, who is one-quarter Pechanga and one-eighth Navajo, says
it's rare for any tribal member to have more than 50% Pechanga
blood.)</TE>
<TE>   After earning a bachelor's degree at Cal State San Bernardino, he
left California to earn a law degree from Washington University in
St. Louis and a master's in social work from the George Warren Brown
School of Social Work, also in St. Louis. He later served as a law
clerk to the Cherokee Nation in Oklahoma, won a fellowship with the
U.S. Senate Indian Affairs Committee, and worked as a field officer
for the Federal Emergency Management Agency. Returning to the
reservation with his wife and daughter in 1999, he sunk a small
fortune into a well-appointed, off-the-grid modular home, powered by
solar panels and whirring wind turbines in the backyard.</TE>
<TE>   The turbines are a reservation rarity, but several Pechanga
leaders have pursued off-reservation careers before returning. The
tribal council's chairman, Mark Macarro, studied political science at
UC Santa Barbara. Tribal spokesman Murphy, who recalls growing up
among 10 children in four rooms on the Pechanga Reservation, earned a
degree at UC Riverside, and taught physical education and did
recruitment at UC San Diego.</TE>
<TE>   "Plenty of us were just waiting for the opportunity to come back,"
DuBois says.</TE>
<TE>   He rolls past the old and new casinos, then stops at the tribal
government headquarters, a two-story building completed last year.
Inside, seven elected council members deliberate amid considerable
casino-fueled comfort, from remote-controlled blinds to
leaf-patterned carpets designed to echo the Pechangas' longtime
canyon companions, the oaks. Just up the road stand a handsome new
firehouse and recreation center with night lighting, also built with
casino dollars.</TE>
<TE>   But the most striking stop is the reservation's residential area.
For anyone seeking symbols of sudden and extravagant affluence, it
falls far short.</TE>
<TE>   Fewer than half of the tribe's members make their homes on the
reservation. And most of those residences are trailers and modular
homes, some tidy and triple-wide, some ramshackle. All are connected
by dirt roads.</TE>
<TE>   The roads, DuBois says, are a matter of choice. In votes in recent
years, the tribal membership has spent freely on the fire station and
recreation center and so on, DuBois says, but there's a rural
familiarity to dirt roads that the Pechangas aren't ready to leave
behind.</TE>
<TE>   And what about all the mobile homes?</TE>
<TE>   Real-estate lenders, DuBois explains, bumping along in the Ford,
don't offer conventional mortgages to reservation dwellers. Since
reservation land can't be seized, it also can't be offered as
collateral. Thus, for those who choose to live on the reservation,
the choice is either raise enough money to build a house without a
home loan, or pick a trailer or modular home, for which there is
financing available.</TE>
<TE>   Real-estate transactions tend to happen more smoothly when the
tribe and its collective fortune are involved. With two purchases in
recent years, the Pechangas have added more than 1,000 acres to their
holdings, including the 724-acre Great Oak Ranch, which once belonged
to "Perry Mason" author Erle Stanley Gardner.</TE>
<TE>   DuBois steers the Ford that way, kicking up a trail of dust as he
heads first toward the hillside lodge and the handful of rustic
cottages next door.</TE>
<TE>   He points out the brick outbuilding where the fire-fearing author
is said to have stored manuscripts, then heads onward to one of the
largest oak trees in North America. Beneath and around it spread acre
after acre of open land. It's near here, just off Pala Road, less
than a mile from the casino, that DuBois pauses with the
museum-making gleam in his eye.</TE>
<TE>   The idea of collaborating with the Southwest Museum, DuBois
concedes, came to him long before it really made sense.</TE>
<TE>   Founded in 1907, the Southwest Museum is the oldest museum in Los
Angeles. It has gathered 350,000 artifacts from throughout North
America--a collection considered the most significant of its kind
outside a government museum.</TE>
<TE>   But the Southwest suffers from tight budgets and modest visitor
numbers, in part because of its location--on Mt. Washington,
surrounded by a blue-collar residential neighborhood. The museum gets
by on $2.3 million a year, and even after an expansion coming in the
next year, the facility will have room to display less than 2% of its
material.</TE>
<TE>   Behind the scenes, curators sidle through crowded storage areas,
past 13,000 pieces of basketry, 11,000 pieces of pottery, 1,000
kachina dolls, 1,300 Navajo textiles, and so on.</TE>
<TE>   About 15 years ago, DuBois remembers, he first read in detail
about the Southwest collection. At the time, he was on a break from
grad school and the tribe had no resources to spare, but the
beginning of an idea sprouted.</TE>
<TE>   It bloomed last year, when he learned the Southwest was in search
of a wealthy partner and holding talks with the Gene Autry Museum of
Western Heritage. In spring 2001, DuBois called Southwest executive
director King and invited him to visit the Pechanga Reservation.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, Southwest officials have walked Pechanga land,
Pechanga officials have toured the Southwest's back rooms, and Autry
officials have declared a retreat. Although neither DuBois nor King
will talk about negotiation specifics, what the Pechangas are
offering is a cash infusion, as well as a chance for the Southwest to
show off more of its collection without giving up its independence,
as the Autry merger might have required.</TE>
<TE>   Still, nothing about the proposed Pechanga-Southwest partnership
is sure until the Pechanga tribal membership and the Southwest
Museum's board of trustees hold votes. A tribal vote could come as
soon as May, depending on how rapidly contract language can be
settled, DuBois says. King declines to offer any timetable for a vote
among his board of trustees, but affirms that in a year of steady
progress, he's seen no substantial obstacles.</TE>
<TE>   The nation's foremost museum collection of Native American
artifacts, no matter what the Pechanga and Southwest do, belongs to
the Smithsonian Institution, which in 2004 will open a National
Museum of the American Indian on the National Mall in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   Among scores of mostly modest museums on tribal lands across the
country, authorities say, the most ambitious is Connecticut's
Mashantucket Pequot Museum and Research Center, which opened in 1998.
The tribe, which operates a major casino complex, has estimated that
it spent $193 million on the museum, which relies heavily on dioramas
and videos and high technology. But that museum features a modest
artifacts collection, about 2,000 items.</TE>
<TE>   In California, several tribes operate museums with relatively
modest collections, including the Agua Caliente Cultural Museum,
which opened in 1993 in Palm Springs, and the Barona Cultural Center
and Museum in Lakeside, San Diego County, which opened in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   The Pechanga proposal is more ambitious than those. As DuBois
describes the working concept, the new museum would include more than
32,000 square feet of exhibition space (about three times the
existing total at the Southwest Museum) set amid 40 to 60 acres of
native plants. The museum would explore the history of Native
Americans in Southern California and nationwide, and would be housed
separately from gambling areas, so that families and school groups
could visit without distraction.</TE>
<TE>   Thousands of artifacts would rotate between the Southwest and the
Pechanga Reservation. The collection's ownership would stay with the
Southwest, and the Pechanga museum would be run by professional
curators hired by the tribe, although the Southwest's staff could
also have a role at Pechanga. DuBois guesses that it could take three
to five years to design and build.</TE>
<TE>   The great attraction of teaming with Southwest, DuBois says, is
that "we'll be a world-class museum. People will talk about the
Museum of the American Indian in Washington, and they'll talk about
Pechanga."</TE>
<TE>   One challenge of a Pechanga-Southwest partnership, says Doug
Sharon, executive director of the San Diego Museum of Man, "will be
each party getting through their own internal politics, in terms of
perceptions and past history--including the past history of the
United States."</TE>
<TE>   Cheryl Hinton, who directs the reservation-based Barona Cultural
Center &amp; Museum, calls the Pechanga-Southwest talks a courtship with
unique possibilities. But as a veteran curator who has worked in
institutions on and off the reservation, Hinton also predicts that
the collaboration will be complicated.</TE>
<TE>   For conventionally trained curators, she says, working on a
reservation often means acknowledging that "maybe there isn't just
one way to curate objects. I've seen elders come in and pick up a
basket by a corner, and I'll just about faint," Hinton says.</TE>
<TE>   "But they have these things lying around the house. I don't say
anything. I don't correct elders," she continues. "If you're
preserving culture, then you also need to accommodate those people
whose culture you're preserving."</TE>
<TE>   Among other Native American groups too, the Pechangas and the
museum have some delicate footwork to do.</TE>
<TE>   Anthony Morales, chairman of the Gabrielino Tongva tribal council
in Los Angeles County, says he has mixed feelings about the proposal,
in part because it could take Gabrielino artifacts out of Los Angeles
County and the Pechangas haven't made any attempt to contact him.
Back at Pechanga, DuBois pledges that if questions arise over whether
an artifact should be displayed, the Pechangas would defer to the
wishes of other tribal leaders, as the Southwest Museum does now.</TE>
<TE>   Now it's late in the day, and DuBois has been talking about
Pechanga past and Pechanga future for hours. The Ford rolls back up
to the ranch house with the cultural resources inside and the
hotel-casino rising about half a mile away. Just outside the home
stands a modest shelter built of willow branches, with a few hundred
potted plants nearby.</TE>
<TE>   This is the beginning of an ethnobotanical nursery. Coaxed to life
with the help of consultant William Pink, who is part-Pechanga but is
enrolled at the nearby Pala Reservation, these are some of the plants
that have given the tribe its clothes, tools and shelter for
centuries: coastal live oak, deer grass, sumac, yucca, sage. Many of
them are now rare in the valley, like dogbane, which can be poisonous
to dogs but was frequently used in ceremonial garb. A cell phone
peeking from his pocket, Pink pulls up a grass blade and pulls it
apart, showing how his ancestors split the plant three ways, then
wove the strands.</TE>
<TE>   A few yards from the fledgling nursery is a pair of well-secured
shipping containers, their interiors full of old Pechanga artifacts,
including mortars and pestles, pottery chards, knives, pendants and
fishhooks, each labeled.</TE>
<TE>   "All the stuff you see here--it comes in every day," DuBois says.
As development marches across the valley, he adds, it's typical for
building-site archeologists to bring in 100 items a month or more.
Items associated with burials, like human bones, are reinterred. The
rest gets logged and shelved in the shipping containers--at least
until the Pechangas have another place for them.</TE>
<TE>   "Our way of thinking is that you can't own these things," DuBois
says. "You can only take care of them."</TE>

<HD>Back to a Family--and a City--in Turmoil</HD>
<DH>Ten years after the L.A. riots, Taylor Negron finds new
depths in his play 'Gangster Planet.'</DH>

<LD>"There was something freakazoid about the spirit in the city that
day," Taylor Negron said.</LD>
<LD>   "That day" was April 29, 1992, when an acquittal in a Simi Valley
trial of four police officers was followed by chaos in the streets of
L.A.</LD>
<LD>   Negron's experiences that day were so freakazoid, so theatrical,
that he and a colleague with him during those traumatic events turned
them into a play, "Gangster Planet," which premiered a year later at
what was then the World Theatre, now the Hudson Guild Theatre, on
Santa Monica Boulevard in Hollywood.</LD>
<TE>   Now, commemorating the upcoming 10th anniversary of the riots,
"Gangster Planet" is returning in a new production directed by Justin
Tanner, the playwright whose comedies were among the most acclaimed
creations of L.A. theater in the '90s. Negron is again playing the
leading role, with David Groh of "Rhoda" fame as his father and
Jeanette O'Connor as his mother.</TE>
<TE>   Opening Saturday, "Gangster Planet" is being produced by Michael
Caldwell and Rachel Winfree; Caldwell also produced the first
staging. But this time it's under the banner of the relatively new
Chautauqua Theatre Alliance, at the Egyptian Arena Theatre, just off
Hollywood Boulevard and only a few blocks from where Negron was holed
up during the riots.</TE>
<TE>   Negron, Tanner and Caldwell called up their memories of that
perilous day while sitting in the wood-beamed serenity of the classic
Hollywood restaurant Musso &amp; Frank, before any other customers had
arrived for the lunch rush. Musso &amp; Frank is mentioned in the script
of "Gangster Planet," so it was an appropriate site for a
conversation about the day when it appeared that Hollywood might turn
into toast.</TE>
<TE>   Negron--best known as a stand-up comic and a supporting player in
many movie and TV comedies--lived on Orchid Avenue, a few blocks
northwest of Musso &amp; Frank. On the day of the acquittals and the
riots, his parents, Conrad (who is now the mayor of Indian Wells,
near Palm Springs) and Lucy Negron, arrived at his house in a
Rolls-Royce and, according to the younger Negron, planned to explain
some temporary financial setbacks to their son. "I behaved like a
child and got mad at them," Negron recalled.</TE>
<TE>   In the midst of the family squabbling, the Negrons realized that a
bigger dispute was happening just outside their door. Rioters with
Molotov cocktails were driving by. A rumor spread that the nearby
restaurant and sightseeing center, Yamashiro, was a major target of
the rioters.</TE>
<TE>   Negron's neighbors yanked guns out of closets and formed an
impromptu defense force. "It was scary to see an arsenal appear out
of nowhere," Negron said. He remembers that the police told the
neighbors they could keep their guns out as long as they pointed them
down.</TE>
<TE>   Negron, who is on the board of a pro-gun-control group, had no
gun. "I realized I was better off making pumpkin bread for the
troops," he said--and he did so. However, in retrospect he now
believes that if not for his neighbors' guns, the rioters might have
destroyed the neighborhood.</TE>
<TE>   Besides his parents, another Negron house guest that day was
Lawrence Justice, a writer with whom Negron was working on a film
script. After the riots, the two of them wrote "Gangster Planet,"
about a man in Hollywood who's visited by his parents in a
Rolls-Royce on April 29, 1992.</TE>
<TE>   There is a fourth character in the play--a neighbor whose ethnic
background is all over the map. He's played in the current production
by Italian comedian Simon N. Butera. Negron said this character does
not correspond to Justice, who now lives in New Zealand and isn't
working on the play's revival.</TE>
<TE>   Co-producer Caldwell said he was a few blocks east of Negron on
the day of the riots, trapped in Beachwood Canyon. He remembers
everyone running to the local market and stocking up on water and
liquor--but not food.</TE>
<TE>   He and his comedy partner and wife, Winfree, had met Negron in
1989 and felt they shared a comic sensibility. Caldwell had already
produced some plays in small theaters and volunteered to do those
duties for the first "Gangster Planet."</TE>
<TE>   That production drew mixed reviews. Richard Stayton embraced it in
The Times, writing that the authors, "by lampooning liberal pieties
and anxieties, contribute more to 'rebuild L.A.' than all the high
and mighty rhetoric of the past year." But LA Weekly's Judith Lewis
wrote that the writers "ignore how events unfolded and simply paper
gags over an event that in their hands seems like a myth." Richard
Scaffidi of Drama-Logue felt the production "elevates essentially
trite and slapdash material to a level of passable amusement" but
"never makes any headway on whatever the ironic riot tie-in is
supposed to accomplish."</TE>
<TE>   Negron, Caldwell and Winfree started talking about a 10th
anniversary revival of the play early last year. The producers were
looking for projects for their new Chautauqua Theatre Alliance, in
which they are partners with Daniel Doran and Ray Proscia.</TE>
<TE>   (Asked what makes Chautauqua different from the dozens of other
sub-100-seat companies in L.A., Caldwell returned to his sketch
comedy roots, putting on an earnestly callow expression and a
fervent, pleading tone, and replying, "Because ours is better!
Because we care more!" Then, resuming his regular demeanor, he said,
"We've all been in shows you don't want to invite anyone to. With
Chautauqua, we're really trying to step up.")</TE>
<TE>   Negron and his producers had planned a reading of "Gangster
Planet" for Sept. 11 last year, but a fresher catastrophe got in the
way that day, "and the play seemed to take on a bigger meaning about
the world falling apart," Caldwell said.</TE>
<TE>   Negron went to England to work on the play and "escape the
horror," he said, only to find that English TV was showing even more
graphic coverage of the twin towers attack than American TV was--and
that a newspaper headline on the day he arrived predicted an imminent
bombing attack in London. So he went on to Wales in search of a
little peace.</TE>
<TE>   The rewriting didn't switch into high gear until Tanner joined the
project earlier this year, replacing an earlier director. Negron and
Tanner, who profess to being great fans of each other's work but had
never worked together, first talked about the revival after a
memorial service for the late Lance Loud of "An American Family"
fame.</TE>
<TE>   "This process has been more about rewriting than directing,"
Tanner said. In its previous state, the play had more elements of
stand-up comedy, with more "breaking of the fourth wall," letting
Negron address the audience directly. Tanner said the parent
characters are "more three-dimensional now."</TE>
<TE>   "Justin gave me permission to be real," Negron said. When the
characters "say things to each other's face instead of as asides,
it's more truthful."</TE>
<TE>   When Tanner directed his own plays, he usually worked with a
loosely bound company of familiar actors with whom he had a
"shorthand--I could start a sentence and they would complete it." He
had directed other writers' work only twice since college and had
never worked with any of the actors in the current production. "The
hardest part was finding a way to make myself understood without
explaining myself," he said. "But I'm working with pros."</TE>
<TE>   Tanner himself had quite an odyssey on April 29, 1992. He was at
his old haunt, the Cast Theatre in southern Hollywood, and decided to
walk home to Koreatown, where he found the corner stores in flames.
He then drove with a friend to Beverly Hills and spent one night.
"But for some reason I wanted to be a part of it," he said. So he
went to a friend's apartment several stories up near MacArthur Park,
where he had "a much better view of the burning."</TE>
<TE>   Negron moved out of Hollywood a few years after the riots. He said
the prevalent attitude then was that "they should just bulldoze over
it, get rid of all the burned-out wig shops." The increased
helicopter noise bothered him. He now lives in West Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   But he also maintains that Hollywood is making a remarkable
comeback. Not that he entirely approves of all the details. He
doesn't like the new Hollywood &amp; Highland complex: "It's cold. It
should be filled with fountains and Mexican tiles, pepper trees and
more tiles. I don't like the big Gap sign."</TE>
<TE>   He hopes that the presence of little plays like "Gangster Planet"
will help humanize the area. "Hollywood Boulevard has to make room
for artists, for alternatives to the Banana Republic and the Gap."</TE>
<TE>   He cautioned, however, that his play--despite its backdrop--is not
about political advocacy. It's primarily about family and the central
character's abdication of growing up, he said. Tanner noted that this
theme--characters who try to "extend childhood into adulthood"--is
also important in his work.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not talking about why these things like the riots happen."
Negron said. "What's important about the riots and 9/11 is that
they're over. The hard part is building the world from the rubble.
And that requires adults."</TE>

<LD>Jazz has had more than its share of charismatic individuals--some
more appealing than others. But few were as enigmatic as Charles
Mingus, whose enormous talents were combined with a sometimes
abrasive unpredictability.</LD>
<LD>   April 22 is the 80th anniversary of the birth of the bassist,
composer and bandleader. Born in Nogales, Ariz., in 1922, he spent
his formative years in the Southland, became a central figure in the
jazz of the '40s, '50s and '60s, and died in Mexico in 1979, a victim
of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, also known as Lou Gehrig's disease.</LD>
<LD>   Although his music was not universally accorded a lofty position
during his lifetime, the two decades since his passing have provided
ample perspective to position Mingus as one of the most important
composers in jazz history. Few would now argue that his substantial
body of work doesn't belong in the exalted company of Duke Ellington,
Billy Strayhorn and Thelonious Monk.</LD>
<TE>   Mingus' 80th birthday anniversary is being celebrated with the CD
"Tonight at Noon ... Three or Four Shades of Love" by the Mingus Big
Band (***1/2, Dreyfus Jazz) and "Tonight at Noon: A Love Story"
(Pantheon Books), written by his widow, Sue Mingus, and described as
"an autobiography of her life with Charles."</TE>
<TE>   The Mingus Big Band is an all-star group of players who have been
working under the artistic direction of Sue Mingus since 1991.
"Tonight at Noon," the ensemble's seventh recording for Dreyfus Jazz,
revolves thematically around what she describes as "the subject of
love," a particularly complex sentiment for Mingus and one that
surfaced in his music in a remarkable series of far-ranging works.</TE>
<TE>   The album also offers the debut recordings by the Charles Mingus
Orchestra, a smaller ensemble that includes several Mingus Big Band
members with the addition of French horn and various woodwind
instruments. One of the orchestra's pieces, "Eclipse," features a
jazz rarity--an improvised bassoon solo, well played by Michael
Rabinowitz.</TE>
<TE>   Mingus compositions have always posed thorny problems for
reinterpreters. How to deal with the spontaneous interaction between
individual players that was so common to the music? How to capture
the sudden, surging shifts of rhythm that were generally driven by
Mingus' bass in their original manifestations? How to transform
smaller group compositions into larger ensemble expressions while
remaining true to what Mingus had in mind?</TE>
<TE>   No wonder that the Mingus Big Band--along with Mingus Dynasty (in
the '80s) and the fine, Bay Area-based Mingus Amungus--has played
such an important role in keeping this valuable material alive in
performance mode. In addition to Sue Mingus, major credit also goes
to arranger Sy Johnson, with his unerring ability to retain not
simply the spirit but the substance too of Mingus' music. His superb
arrangement of "Love's Fury," for example--drawn from a notebook
sketch--finds a link to Ellington (especially in his use of baritone
saxophonist Ronnie Cuber as a lead voice) that would surely have
pleased Mingus. Johnson's setting of the first three movements of the
epic "Black Saint &amp; Sinner Lady" similarly underscores Mingus'
amazing capacity to create music whose rich, layered density in no
way diminishes its emotional impact.</TE>
<TE>   Credit also goes to the Mingus Big Band's brilliant musicians,
especially alto saxophonist Alex Foster, trombonists Conrad Herwig
and Ku-umba Frank Lacy, trumpeters Kenny Rampton and Alex Sipiagin,
and Cuber, all of whom played important roles in bringing a gripping
program to life. I can't think of a better way to celebrate the
Mingus anniversary.</TE>
<TE>   Sue Mingus' "Tonight at Noon" has its celebratory aspects, as
well. But it is valuable primarily for its insights into the final
chapters of Mingus' life. When she first met him in 1964, her
knowledge of jazz was admittedly nil. At the time, Mingus was leading
some of his finest ensembles. Although his extraordinary recordings
for Columbia, RCA, Atlantic and Candid were already completed, some
fine work--"Reincarnation of a Lovebird," "Changes One" and "Changes
Two," "Cumbia and Jazz Fusion"--was still to be done.</TE>
<TE>   An experienced, insightful writer, Sue Mingus avoids the trap of
sentimentality, illuminating her husband as an artist and a man,
casting light on at least some aspects of his always complex, often
difficult persona.</TE>
<TE>   Four other books offer different but equally valuable perspectives
(a book by writer Nat Hentoff--a friend as well as a business
associate of the artist--is in the works): "Beneath the Underdog: His
World as Composed by Mingus"(Vintage Books), an autobiography of
sorts written in 1971, can best be described as a written
improvisation on his life. Comparable to his music in its
juxtaposition of exaggeration and reality, its sudden twists and
turns, it is less a distortion of facts than it is a view of life
seen through a one-of-a-kind filter.</TE>
<TE>   "Mingus: A Critical Biography" (Da Capo Press), by British
musician-journalist Brian Priestley, examines many of the major works
in detail without hesitating to evaluate them from a technical
viewpoint. "Myself When I Am Real: The Life and Music of Charles
Mingus" (Oxford University Press), by Gene Santoro, is a detailed
biography that is generally successful at making some linear sense
out of the tangled web of Mingus' life.</TE>
<TE>   In "Mingus/Mingus: Two Memoirs" (Limelight Editions), Janet
Coleman and Al Young offer an engrossing, colorful view of an
enormously complex man, of his passions and eccentricities, of the
manner in which his music of the '50s was deeply affected by the
turbulent social climate of the late Eisenhower years and the dawning
struggles of the '60s.</TE>

<LD>A whole bunch of studies on sleep came out recently. If you read them
all, including the footnotes, you wouldn't have any trouble, you
know, sleeping. They prompted some waking debate about methodology.
But generally we've learned from these sophisticated studies that
sleep is important, everyone needs several hours a night, some people
have trouble sleeping and if you don't get sufficient sleep you may
be crabby or worse.</LD>
<LD>   These findings--hey, are you still awake?--have particular
relevance this morning because 100% of Americans who aren't in
Hawaii, Arizona and some independent parts of Indiana got one hour
less sleep last night. That's because of this 86-year-old thing
called daylight saving time that happens the first full weekend of
April and the last weekend in October. Remember, spring ahead, fall
back?</LD>
<TE>   Daylight saving doesn't really save or do anything to daylight
except move it over a little to life's evenings. It was invented by
city people to save evening energy and provide an extra hour's light
to fool around after work or get home safely. City folks didn't care
one standard second about the disruption that daylight saving wreaks
on America's dwindling population of early-rising farmers. Forget the
roosters. Until Saturday, farmers were just beginning to enjoy the
sun rising a minute earlier every day and waking up to daylight again
for the first time since, well, around the last weekend of last
October. But now, boom, for them it's Darkness Saving Time again.</TE>
<TE>   Worse, seriously, is the impact on dairy cows, whose milk
production relies on routine and who don't wear watches. Yesterday,
they instinctively arrived for milking at 6 a.m. Today, 6 a.m. comes
at 5 a.m. cow time; they're awakened an hour early and instantly
they're an hour late. It's even worse in October when 6 a.m. becomes
7 a.m. You stand in line an extra hour with a full udder and see if
you favor daylight saving time. Farmers relieve this untimely bovine
discomfort by adjusting Udder Milking Time 15 minutes a week for four
weeks. Time is milk, milk is money, and cows apparently don't track
quarter-hours.</TE>
<TE>   But back to humans. The typical nonfarming one needs seven to 8.5
hours of sleep per night, studies say; teenagers need 9.25 hours.
College students need none until they're home, when they require 14
minimum. Besides hatching impatience, irritability and unhappiness
with everything and everyone working so diligently to get so
perfectly in your way, sleep shortages cloud thinking and spawn
inattention--not good, for instance, for truck drivers. Sleep looks
like inactivity, but the body and brain need quality time for
resting, revitalizing, downloading. So today, we should be a little
more patient with each other. And don't walk behind any dairy cows.</TE>

<DH>Ambitious immigrants found success with doughnut shops, but
now big chains are eating away at profits.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARC BALLON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The doughnut business, once a well-traveled route to the American
dream, has become a dead-end for many immigrants as major doughnut
and coffee chains have blanketed the country with stores, taking a
bite out of the profits of countless mom-and-pop entrepreneurs.</LD>
<LD>   For more than two decades, Cambodian immigrants, in particular,
have made a mark in the doughnut business, which requires few
English-language and technical skills. Drawing on the money and
support of family and friends who paved the way, many ascended to the
middle class by cultivating this particular retailing niche in their
adopted homeland, just as thousands of Vietnamese newcomers
gravitated to the nail salon business and many Thai immigrants opened
neighborhood restaurants.</LD>
<LD>   Now, Cambodian immigrants, who operate an estimated 75% of
California's nearly 2,500 doughnut shops, are struggling, especially
in Southern California, the epicenter of the nation's most intense
doughnut wars. They and other independent operators must grapple with
a resurgent Winchell's Donut House, which is renovating stores and
has boosted its advertising budget, and the exploding popularity of
Krispy Kreme Doughnuts, which has attracted a cult-like following and
has grand expansion plans for the Southland.</LD>
<TE>   Growing competition from bagel shops and national coffee chains
such as Starbucks Corp. and Diedrich Coffee Inc. also are hurting
sales.</TE>
<TE>   Amid this cutthroat environment, some independent doughnut shops
have expanded their offerings to include muffins, croissants and
premium coffee drinks. Others have laid off staff, slashed expenses
and, in some cases, closed their doors.</TE>
<TE>   In a reflection of the difficulties faced by mom-and-pop
businesses, the number of U.S. doughnut shops dropped to 10,470 in
2001 from 10,646 the year before, a 1.7% dip, according to
NPDFoodservice, a research firm in Port Washington, N.Y.</TE>
<TE>   That decline comes as the $3.5-billion doughnut market is posting
sales growth in the high single digits as consumers increasingly
indulge in Krispy Kreme Doughnuts Inc.'s glazed doughnuts and other
treats sold by major chains, said Technomic Inc., a Chicago
restaurant research and consulting firm.</TE>
<TE>   Thousands of independent doughnut shops across the United States
that inhabit aging stores in poor locations and that are saddled with
tiny marketing budgets "are going out of style," said Hal Sieling, a
Carlsbad, Calif.-based restaurant consultant. "Their days could be
numbered."</TE>
<TE>   Nobody knows that better than Ning Yen, who supplies 1,600
doughnut shops in Southern California, the nation's most crowded
market. Just a few years ago, Cambodians and other immigrants called
on him for advice on how to operate and get financing for doughnut
shops. The "godfather" of Cambodian doughnut makers would freely
dispense words of wisdom to fledgling entrepreneurs, who in turn
would buy sugar, dough and icing from his company, B&amp;H Distributors.</TE>
<TE>   His telephone isn't ringing as much now, except for queries from
financially strapped customers who are seeking more time to pay him.</TE>
<TE>   With immigrants' children heading to college and pursuing
professional careers, Yen worries that nobody will be left to run the
doughnut shops when their parents retire in a few years. The
independent shops, under increasing pressure from the chains, could
go the way of scores of small businesses that have disappeared in the
growing wake of Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and other retail-chain
behemoths.</TE>
<TE>   Krispy Kreme Changed the Doughnut Market</TE>
<TE>   Sales at Yen's La Mirada company have fallen 20% over the last
three years to $12 million in 2001. This year, he laid off five of
B&amp;H's 40 workers, the first layoffs in the firm's history. Business
has been so sluggish that he recently sublet a 30,000-square-foot
space, at a small loss, to a salvage company.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm waiting for better days," said Yen, flashing a weary smile,
amid the whir of forklifts at his warehouse. "I hope they will come."</TE>
<TE>   Yen, like many of the Cambodian immigrants he has mentored, has
experienced far worse times. The 46-year-old doughnut mogul lived on
a 20-acre farm with his parents and seven siblings until the Khmer
Rouge seized their land in 1975. Under that harsh regime, Yen spent
the next 4 1/2 years harvesting rice and clearing jungles, sometimes
subsisting on snakes and rats he caught in the fields.</TE>
<TE>   In 1979, Yen escaped from Cambodia and made his way to the United
States, where he crammed into a three-room apartment with 11 family
members. Within six months, he had landed a job as a Winchell's
doughnut baker in Santa Ana, a career step taken by thousands of
Cambodian immigrants as the first rung on the ladder to middle-class
success.</TE>
<TE>   Yen worked long hours and saved almost everything he earned. In
1984, he struck out on his own, buying Mag's Donut Bakery in Irvine,
with a $20,000 loan from family and friends. By using higher-quality
ingredients and scouring equipment until it sparkled, he made tastier
doughnuts. Soon, lines snaked out the doors.</TE>
<TE>   His success led him to join B&amp;H in 1986, and he became president
in 1994. By then, he also owned a mini-chain of seven doughnut shops.
Business flourished.</TE>
<TE>   Then Krispy Kreme entered the Southern California market and
Winchell's took steps to reverse its slide. That, coupled with the
expansion of coffee and bagel chains, darkened the outlook for Yen
and his mostly Cambodian immigrant customers.</TE>
<TE>   Krispy Kreme, which makes fresh doughnuts throughout the day and
flashes "Hot Doughnuts Now" signs in stores when they're ready,
opened its first Southland store in January 1999 in La Habra. In its
first year, the shop had 2.5million visitors, more people than
attended Anaheim Angels' baseball games that season, said Richard
Reinis, chief executive of Great Circle Family Foods, the exclusive
Krispy Kreme franchisee in Southern California. There now are 18
Krispy Kremes dotting the region, with plans to add at least 60 in
the next 4 1/2 years.</TE>
<TE>   The typical Krispy Kreme shop in Southern California generates
sales of more than $3 million a year, according to company regulatory
filings. That's more than 10 times the revenue of the average
mom-and-pop store, analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   And Winston-Salem, N.C.-based Krispy Kreme, which last year had
systemwide revenue of more than $622 million, could be getting
stronger. The company expects to roll out flavored coffees and
espresso at all locations by the end of the year, which could boost
same-store sales, said Andrew Wolf, an analyst with BB&amp;T Capital
Markets. The 217-unit chain also recently introduced smaller stores
that use a new doughnut machine, a development expected to
significantly fuel expansion.</TE>
<TE>   "Krispy Kreme's sort of like In-N-Out Burger," Villa Park-based
restaurant consultant Bob Sandelman said. "It has loyal customers who
will go out of their way to find it."</TE>
<TE>   Winchell's, the Southland's biggest doughnut maker with 95 of its
202 stores here, also is on the move. The Santa Ana-based firm now
features freshly made doughnuts throughout the morning. Its
Winchell's Dozen--14 doughnuts sold for $5.99--has struck a chord
with customers, Chief Executive Bob Zanolli said. The closely held
chain, which has begun renovating stores with brighter paint and more
contemporary signs, posted a 5% rise in same-store sales in 2001, its
first increase in seven years. It also has benefited from Krispy
Kreme's popularity and the resurgence of comfort foods, experts said.</TE>
<TE>   "We fell off the map for a few years, but we're back," Zanolli
said.</TE>
<TE>   And now Dunkin' Donuts is coming to California. The
nation's biggest doughnut store chain, which last year registered U.S.
sales of $2.5 billion, plans to open its first store in the state by the
end of the summer, spokeswoman Cindy Gordon said. Because of the
Golden State's large population of doughnut-and-coffee aficionados,
Dunkin' "wants to storm California," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Dunkin', a subsidiary of Allied Domecq, the British owner of the
Baskin Robbins and Togo's chains, has 3,900 stores in the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   Karen Jung, like other independent doughnut makers, said the
doughnut business has lost some of its glaze in recent years. The
50-year-old owner of Big Dan's Donuts in Irvine said her annual sales
have stalled at about $216,000 in the last five years, down about 10%
since the mid-1990s. With five Starbucks, one Diedrich Coffee shop,
two bagel stores and five doughnut outlets within a two-mile radius
of Big Dan's, the South Korean immigrant said she has been unable to
raise prices since 1997, even as rent, utility and electricity costs
have increased. To compound the problem, a nearby supermarket has
begun selling store-baked doughnuts.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the pressures, Jung said she has enjoyed her 22 years in
the business, especially the smiles on children's faces as she hands
them fluffy doughnuts. She earns enough to afford a small condominium
and to help her daughter and son, both in college, with their car
payments. However, she is considering retiring in two years to move
back to South Korea to do missionary work.</TE>
<TE>   "There's too much competition," Jung said.</TE>
<TE>   It's not just immigrant doughnut makers experiencing tougher
times.</TE>
<TE>   In 1964, Stan Berman opened Stan's Donuts in Westwood Village, a
tiny 475-square-foot shop that soon became a destination for
Hollywood royalty. Ali McGraw and Steve McQueen used to drop by to
people-watch. Goldie Hawn was a regular. Elizabeth Taylor showed up
one night.</TE>
<TE>   Stars weren't the only people willing to brave the Westwood
traffic and crowds to gobble up Stan's peanut butter-filled doughnuts
and other unique treats.</TE>
<TE>   With its following growing through word-of-mouth, the doughnut
shop posted annual sales of more than $450,000 by the late 1980s,
allowing Berman to buy a home in Encino and to travel the world.</TE>
<TE>   Doughnut Business Has 'Gotten a Lot Harder'</TE>
<TE>   But as Westwood's popularity declined because of competition from
new malls in Century City and Santa Monica, business at Stan's fell
too. The opening nearby of several coffee shops, cookie stores and
bakeries exacerbated the situation.</TE>
<TE>   To compensate for declining sales, Berman, now 72, began selling
doughnuts at wholesale to nearby UCLA.</TE>
<TE>   Today, Stan's takes in about $360,000 a year, 20% off its peak.
Berman, who works the morning shift seven days a week, said he makes a
nice living but has cut back on clothing purchases and international
travel.  He hasn't bought a new car since 1986.</TE>
<TE>   If Krispy Kreme opens a shop in the area, Berman said, it could
cause him some headaches.</TE>
<TE>   He said he has no regrets. "My house has been built by doughnuts.
My travels have been funded by doughnuts. And a lot of my friendships
have been made at the doughnut shop. But the business has gotten a
lot harder."</TE>

<HD>Reforms Coming to Remedy '90s Abuses</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>James Flanigan</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The scope of reforms coming to the U.S. corporate regulatory system
could be greater than any seen in the six decades since passage of
the first securities laws and the creation of the Securities and
Exchange Commission.</LD>
<LD>   That became clear last week when the SEC said it had opened
inquiries into the accounting practices of 49 companies, many of them
on the Fortune 500 list of the largest firms in the United States.</LD>
<LD>   Regulators suspect a widespread pattern of corporate managements
inflating revenues and earnings by adroit and misleading accounting.
Enron Corp. was the tip of the iceberg.</LD>
<TE>   So laws and regulations on the governance of corporations are
being considered by Congress, the SEC, corporate boardrooms and
business schools. A few changes almost certain to come in the new era
of reform era are:</TE>
<TE>   * Boards of directors will have more responsibility in the
corporation. The "hero" CEOs of recent decades will be subject to
instant dismissal, or even prosecution, if anything goes wrong on
their watch.</TE>
<TE>   * Shareholders will gain a greater collective voice, possibly
electing or dismissing company directors every year, because
individual retirement accounts have become the largest single force
in the U.S. equities market. IRA accounts control</TE>
<TE>   $2.65 trillion in common stocks, 20% of the value of all stocks.
That compares with traditional pension plans at $2 trillion, defined
contribution pension plans at</TE>
<TE>   $2.5 trillion and insurance company annuities at $1.1 trillion,
according to Pension &amp; Investment News, a trade publication.</TE>
<TE>   * Accounting firms will be forced to stick to auditing and not
offer consulting services to corporations they audit. A blue-ribbon
supervisory board, appointed by the government but independent, will
oversee the accounting industry. A similar board may be created to
oversee corporate governance.</TE>
<TE>   * Companies will be required to disclose off-balance-sheet
partnerships and other connections and finances not now included in
their published accounts. The SEC, which could grow in staff and
authority because of new legis- lation, will require more complete
disclosure in corporate accounts.</TE>
<TE>   Strengthening the Authority of Boards</TE>
<TE>   Corporate regulation is entering a new phase with proposed
legislation pending in Congress. A bill sponsored by Republican Rep.
Michael Oxley of Ohio calls for oversight of corporate
accountability. Another measure sponsored by Democrat Sens.
Christopher Dodd of Connecticut and Jon Corzine of New Jersey--a
former co-chairman of Goldman Sachs--would establish a public
accounting oversight board.</TE>
<TE>   Formal regulation by the SEC and informal pressure from pension
investment groups will strengthen the authority of boards of
directors over corporate managements, says Ira Millstein, an expert
on corporate governance, professor at the Yale School of Management
and senior partner in New York law firm Weil Gotshal &amp; Manges.</TE>
<TE>   Audit committees of independent directors will decide what
accounting systems a com- pany uses, Millstein says. "They will be
able to dismiss a chief executive if misleading accounting is found
on his or her watch."</TE>
<TE>   Most of all, say Millstein and other experts on corporate law and
governance, the board of directors should be independent of
management and able to represent the interests of shareholders.
Directors should not have a consulting relationship with the company
or with senior management, advises professor Edward Lawler of USC's
Marshall School of Business.</TE>
<TE>   A shift in thinking about corporate responsibility is occurring in
response to abuses at Enron and other firms in the last decade. Enron
issued misleading accounts--that it later had to restate--to keep its
stock price higher than it might have been otherwise. But Enron was
not alone.</TE>
<TE>   Xerox Corp., once a greatly admired company, has paid a
$10-million fine for misleading reports of revenue from leases that
made its business look better than it was. Officers of the company
may face further SEC charges.</TE>
<TE>   Qwest Communications International Inc., a pioneer of fiber-optic
technology, is accused by regulators of recording revenue from sham
transactions to boost the value of its business.</TE>
<TE>   Such behavior caused two problems, says Lynn Turner, former SEC
chief accountant. One is that "wrong information causes wrong
decisions," meaning that the companies made unwise investments based
on their own false figures.</TE>
<TE>   The other problem is that investors were misled. When true results
became known, the stocks of both companies fell sharply. Both are
down more than 80% from their historic highs and have caused material
losses for individual investors--that is, voters. That's why Congress
is on the warpath.</TE>
<TE>   But will reform really come? Veterans of business and investment
markets, who say the debate will result in much talk but little
action, can be excused for cynicism.</TE>
<TE>   Yet this time could be different. An example of reform is Cendant
Corp., which is pushing the envelope on corporate governance.
Cendant, which owns Avis Rent a Car, Century 21 real estate brokers,
Days Inn hotels and many other service businesses, was accused of
fraud three years ago when false accounts were discovered in a
company with which it had merged. Cendant settled a class-action suit
and took steps to reinforce its board's independence. (A former
Cendant chairman and vice chairman have pleaded not guilty to federal
charges of securities fraud and are awaiting trial in Connecticut.)</TE>
<TE>   This year Cendant is proposing that its shareholders vote directly
on whether the company should grant stock options to managers and
employees. The New York-based company is instituting limitations on
the ability of company officers to trade in company stock. And
shareholders are asked to vote each year to elect or dismiss any and
all directors.</TE>
<TE>   "We expect these initiatives to contribute to building shareholder
value," Cendant Chairman Henry Silverman says. So far, the company's
stock price, which closed Friday at $18.60 on the New York Stock
Exchange, has recovered from the plunge it took a few years ago to
less than $8 a share. But Cendant's stock is priced lower than the
average for other firms on Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index, possibly
because as a conglomerate its accounting is complex. The firm
recently had to publicly explain investments in several outside
ventures simply because analysts voiced suspicions.</TE>
<TE>   In this new post-Enron atmosphere, companies must be above
suspicion or see their stock shunned by investors. This era will
create difficulties to be sure. "Many qualified people will hesitate
at the risks of serving as directors," says Charles King, who heads
recruiting of corporate directors for Korn/Ferry International.</TE>
<TE>   Restoring Credibility to Corporate Finance</TE>
<TE>   But beyond short-term difficulties, another stage in the evolution
of the corporation may be underway. In the 1920s, Wall Street
investment managers organized pools to run up stock prices, attract
small investors and then leave them holding the bag as insiders sold
out. The securities laws of the 1930s stopped such practices and
restored credibility to corporate finance.</TE>
<TE>   In the 1990s, Wall Street investment bankers and corporate
managers manipulated initial public offerings to generate huge gains
for insiders but massive losses for an investing public that has now
grown to include one of every two Americans.</TE>
<TE>   And so now we are embarking on a new era of reform to restore
credibility to corporate finance and to provide some relative
protection for retirement savings. Reforms won't eliminate greed or
change human nature. But regulating corporate behavior, either by the
force of law or through shareholder pressure, is imperative for a
healthy economy.</TE>
<TE>   "If reforms aren't made, we'll have more scandals in a few years,"
Millstein says.</TE>
<TE>   "And if reforms are made, we'll still have future scandals but not
so frequently."</TE>

<LD>   Once again it would seem that the people of Los Angeles will be
called on to pay for a project that was mismanaged and lacked
oversight from its inception.</LD>
<LD>   Not being able to make loans to create jobs in the target areas,
the bank decided to be creative and play high-risk stock investments,
only to find that they were caught holding the bag as the bottom fell
out of that market.</LD>
<TE>   Those charged with general oversight turned their eyes away from
this scheme, and now the people of Los Angeles are called on to make
good the losses. The poor are poorer and guess where the money went?</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>I find the Times' one-sided presentation of the "spam" issue
disturbing ["State Spam Laws Rarely Enforced," April 1] .</LD>
<LD>   Spam is annoying, but so are lots of things that come along with
freedom.</LD>
<LD>   I would rather spend an extra three minutes a day deleting the
many unsolicited e-mails that I receive than accept the overwhelming
burden of telling merchants (unsavory or otherwise) that they haven't
the privilege to advertise via e-mail.</LD>
<TE>   Those who "hijack" servers to send advertising are thieves. Those
who send lawful and legitimate e-mail advertisements are merchants.
We need to differentiate between the two and allow legitimate
businesspeople to advertise. To do anything else would be a
compromise of our basic right to make a living.</TE>
<TE>   My life is full of advertising that I did not ask for--in many
formats--and it's mostly bothersome. But when given the choice of a
world without intrusive advertising (and the products being
advertised) and the crazy, irritating and unpredictable world of free
commerce, it's a slam dunk. I choose spam, and freedom.</TE>
<TE>   Janine Levinson</TE>
<TE>   Glendale</TE>
<TE>   Please tell me which of the following is the most enjoyable to
receive?</TE>
<TE>   * Unsolicited e-mail from companies trying to sell something we
don't need.</TE>
<TE>   * Unsolicited junk mail from the Postal Service for carpet, auto
repair services, legal services and charities, especially around
Christmas.</TE>
<TE>   * Unsolicited telephone calls from stock and bond salesmen, police
and firefighter associations and other commercial establishments,
again around the end of the year.</TE>
<TE>   If we are going to outlaw one thing, then let's outlaw everything
that is unsolicited. That should teach us a lesson and kill our
economy permanently.</TE>
<TE>   Ben Perry</TE>
<TE>   Camarillo</TE>
<TE>   Everyone's missing the point in stopping commercial spam by trying
to stop the messengers.</TE>
<TE>   Go after their clients, the ones whose products or services are
being offered and who paid for the spam to be sent. They're easy to
find--their contact information has to work if they want your
business.</TE>
<TE>   Create a federal statue against sending incorrectly marked spam,
borrow the techniques of the child porn squad, and go undercover to
follow the money.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The fact that Enron appeared near the top of the Fortune 500
["Wal-Mart Tops Fortune 500; Enron Rises to Fifth Place," April 1]
further confirms the problem for investors.</LD>
<LD>   The Fortune 500 is seen as a indicator of corporate stability and
strength, yet a company that is in bankruptcy--and is the subject of
the biggest corporate fraud scandal in U.S. history--is listed as the
fifth-largest company in the U.S.</LD>
<LD>   If Fortune magazine falls for Enron-like accounting trickery, what
hope is there for the average investor? A money jar under the
mattress never looked so good.</LD>

<LD>Re: "Amid Middle East Strife, a New Focus on Economies," James
Flanigan, March 17:</LD>
<LD>   I hope you can give some "ink" to the solution proposed by
Hernando de Soto, president of the Institute for Liberty and
Democracy in Lima, Peru.</LD>
<LD>   In essence, his concept is to ultimately eliminate the need for
foreign aid on the part of the U.S. There is so much potential for
internal growth and capital creation in these areas.</LD>
<TE>   However, the legal processes in place make it virtually impossible
for ordinary people in these countries to create and expand capital.</TE>
<TE>   De Soto illustrates in elaborate process maps that it typically
takes 15 to 20 years to work through the steps to simply own one's
home. This, of course, is the capital base needed to start the
process of internal capital expansion.</TE>
<TE>   It also takes 15 to 20 years to (legitimately) own and operate a
business in these countries. In the underground, little or no
expansion is possible.</TE>
<TE>   If these processes were to be improved, the capital growth in
these countries would grow to the point that our foreign aid would no
longer be needed.</TE>

<HD>Miramax Chief Channeling Energies Into Cable</HD>
<DH>Media: Undaunted by the failure of his magazine, Harvey
Weinstein is craving another challenge.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CLAUDIA ELLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Despite shedding 75 employees, dropping $27 million on a failed
magazine venture and losing 40 pounds on a crash diet, Miramax Films
co-Chairman Harvey Weinstein still has a ferocious appetite to get
bigger.</LD>
<LD>   On the heels of the worst financial and personal setback of his
professional career--the collapse of Talk magazine--Weinstein already
is craving another challenging and costly endeavor: launching a cable
television channel.</LD>
<LD>   "In the next two years, there will be a full-court effort on our
part to the Miramax Channel," Weinstein said. "It's a No. 1
priority."</LD>
<TE>   Considered one of the most competitive, controversial and, by his
own admission, "brusque and arrogant" impresarios on the independent
movie scene, Weinstein, 50, has been bent on building a media empire
on the back of the maverick art-house movie company he and his
younger brother, Bob Weinstein, founded 22 years ago in New York.</TE>
<TE>   For years, Harvey Weinstein--who is as cozy with the Clintons as
he is with the Kidmans and Jaggers of the world--has hungered to be
more than a movie tycoon. In recent years he has made personal and
company investments in Broadway shows and in chic restaurants in New
York, Los Angeles and Martha's Vineyard, Mass., where he has a
vacation home.</TE>
<TE>   The menu of choices in the media business is as enticing to the
voracious Weinstein as junk food.</TE>
<TE>   "If I can give up M&amp;Ms and lose 40 pounds, then building a
business and going in all these directions is no sweat."</TE>
<TE>   Even though the Queens, N.Y.-born brothers sold their company to
Walt Disney Co. in 1993, they've enjoyed the freedom to run their own
show. Miramax's record at the box office has given the Weinsteins the
leverage to expand beyond cinema with Disney's blessing.</TE>
<TE>   Forays into such offshoot businesses as magazine publishing and
television production have been busts. One promising enterprise is
Talk Miramax Books, which has produced seven bestsellers since its
launch three years ago.</TE>
<TE>   "A failure here and there is OK," said Disney Chairman Michael
Eisner, referring to the washout of Talk magazine, Miramax's
ill-fated joint venture with Hearst Magazines. "If you don't allow
creative people like Harvey to spread his wings, you lose the essence
of who they are."</TE>
<TE>   The cable channel is Weinstein's latest attempt to exploit
Miramax's 500-title library and brand name, which is synonymous with
offbeat movies that include last year's edgy "In the Bedroom" and
stylish French import "Amelie" and previous breakout art-house hits
such as "Pulp Fiction," "The Crying Game" and "sex, lies and
videotape."</TE>
<TE>   The company's 8-year-old mainstream movie label, Dimension Films,
has lifted Miramax's status from strictly art house to major studio
with commercial hits such as "Spy Kids," "The Others" and the "Scary
Movie" and "Scream" series.</TE>
<TE>   As Weinstein envisions it, the Miramax Channel would be more than
just another independent movie channel joining the ranks of Sundance
Channel, a venture of Robert Redford, Viacom Inc.'s Showtime Networks
and Universal Studios, and the Independent Film Channel and Bravo,
both owned by Rainbow Media Holdings and controlled by Cablevision
Systems Corp.</TE>
<TE>   Cable Channel Would Be a Valuable Asset</TE>
<TE>   "It would be different because it would be lifestyle plus movies,"
Weinstein said. The channel would target Miramax devotees--a niche
audience of affluent 21- to 49-year-olds who are as interested in
fashion, travel, news and politics as the latest independent movie
hit.</TE>
<TE>   Conceptually, Eisner said, he too is a huge proponent of the idea.
"Miramax is the only brand in the movie business other than Disney,"
he said. "And, I think the Miramax brand can be even more significant
than it is today."</TE>
<TE>   Lisbeth Barron, a Bear Stearns partner in charge of the
entertainment investment banking group, said that if the Miramax
Channel is successful it will be a highly valuable asset.</TE>
<TE>   "Cable networks typically have margins of about 40%," Barron said.
"For the past two decades ... the most sought-after assets are music
publishing companies and cable networks," she said, citing such cable
sales as Fox Family Channel, which was bought by Disney for $5.2
billion, and BET, for which Viacom paid $2.7 billion.</TE>
<TE>   This is not the first time Weinstein has considered launching his
own channel. Eisner proposed the idea about five years ago, but it
was nixed after Disney's strategic planners concluded that a shortage
of space on cable systems would make it too difficult and costly to
get the new channel carried.</TE>
<TE>   Media analysts say that the challenges of launching a cable
channel today are equally as onerous and expensive.</TE>
<TE>   Access to Basic Cable Comes at High Price</TE>
<TE>   "Getting on basic cable is nearly impossible unless you have
hundreds of millions of dollars," said Derek Baine, senior analyst
with Kagan World Media.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to pay cable operators roughly $5 or $6 a subscriber.
And you need 30 million or 40 million subs to attract advertisers and
have a viable business model. So, it would cost at least $150 million
to $200 million," Baine said. And that doesn't include programming
and infrastructure costs, he added.</TE>
<TE>   Eisner, who expressed surprise at learning from a reporter that
Weinstein was revisiting plans for the Miramax Channel, said he
remains wary of the high cost of entry.</TE>
<TE>   "Access is difficult, therefore it's very expensive," Eisner said.
Miramax probably would have to rely on Disney's leverage with cable
operators to pull it off, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Disney used its powerful ESPN sports channel to launch SoapNet and
Toon Disney and to expand the Disney Channel. A Miramax channel,
Eisner said, would have to be a collaboration with ABC's cable
holdings.</TE>
<TE>   But, Baine said, the timing of that might be difficult. "Disney is
not in a really great competitive position to launch new cable
networks at this juncture....Disney used up a lot of goodwill with
cable operators by raising its rates on ESPN."</TE>
<TE>   Stressing that he is in the exploratory stages, Weinstein said, "A
third-party investment we would consider strongly." One possibility,
he said, would be Miramax and Disney forming a joint venture with a
cable operator.</TE>
<TE>   The most desirable partner could be Comcast Corp., which will
become the nation's top cable provider if its proposed merger with
AT&amp;T Broadband is approved by federal regulators. Comcast is partners
with Disney in the E! Entertainment Television cable channel.
Weinstein's companion at last month's Academy Awards ceremony was
Comcast President Brian Roberts.</TE>
<TE>   Weinstein said there's no cable outlet that caters entirely to the
hip, intelligent crowd he is seeking to serve.</TE>
<TE>   His ideas for a Miramax Channel include a talk show, a news
magazine and possibly a Friday night martial arts movie featuring his
company's library of 120 imported Hong Kong flicks starring Jackie
Chan, Jet Li and others.</TE>
<TE>   Just as Fox Cable News, owned by News Corp. Chairman Rupert
Murdoch, reflects conservative political viewpoints, the Miramax
Channel "will be an expression of Harvey's democratic political
philosophy and of a more tolerant lifestyle," said Hollywood agent
Robert Newman, who has known Weinstein since working as his assistant
20 years ago.</TE>
<TE>   "Harvey will have a clear editorial voice that's underrepresented
in the cable universe," said Newman, noting that the venture is a
natural extension of Weinstein's broad range of ambitions and
interest in politics, journalism and philanthropy as well as theater
and literature.</TE>
<TE>   The emergence of his lower-profile brother, Bob, who is fast
becoming a movie mogul in his own right from the success of Miramax's
Dimension Films division, may be fueling Weinstein's already
ego-charged competitiveness.</TE>
<TE>   A recent interview with the two at the Peninsula Hotel in Beverly
Hills revealed their fierce but loving sibling rivalry.</TE>
<TE>   "Over the last six years Dimension has accounted for 65% of the
profit of the company," which last year totaled $161 million, Bob
Weinstein said. "I have a staff of 30 people and am putting five or
six movies out a year. And we spend a lot less money" than the
company's primary movie division.</TE>
<TE>   It was the costly overhead on the Miramax side of the company,
which employs more than 400 and puts out dozens of movies each year,
that prompted the Weinsteins to lay off 17% of their work force last
month. Only two of those laid off worked at Dimension.</TE>
<TE>   "I also want to tell you something," Harvey Weinstein said,
interrupting his brother. "Thirty-five percent of $161 million isn't
chopped liver."</TE>
<TE>   Winners and Losers at the Box Office</TE>
<TE>   Miramax's low-cost acquisitions can be very profitable when they
hit. "In the Bedroom," for which the company paid $1.5 million, and
French import "Amelie," which cost $1 million, each will gross about
$40 million domestically. "Bridget Jones's Diary," a co-production
with Universal Pictures that cost $22 million, has grossed
$280million worldwide.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, Miramax also had a string of losers, the biggest being
its $35-million screen adaptation of the Pulitzer Prize-winning "The
Shipping News," which sank at the U.S. box office with less than
$12million in receipts.</TE>
<TE>   But Weinstein's biggest financial and personal black eye didn't
happen at the box office. Talk magazine, the pet project he pitched
four years ago to then-Editor Tina Brown of New Yorker magazine,
became a high-profile casualty less than three years after its much
ballyhooed launch.</TE>
<TE>   When they decided to form the joint venture, Miramax and Hearst
agreed to cap the total investment at $62 million. After each party
lost $27 million, Hearst decided to pull the plug and cut its losses.
Weinstein failed to find another partner.</TE>
<TE>   Although Weinstein said the Talk enterprise "is painful now," he
predicted that Talk Miramax Books, which is 100% owned by Miramax,
"will be very profitable." The most valuable lesson he says he
learned from the Talk magazine outing was "not to jump in too
quickly" when it comes to plunging into a new business.</TE>
<TE>   "I went too far afield with Talk," said Weinstein. "I didn't
understand the business and still don't."</TE>
<TE>   Weinstein said he won't repeat the mistake as he pursues the
Miramax Channel. He plans to spend ample "pre-production" time on the
venture just as he would for one of his movies, estimating it could
take two years to get the channel launched and five more to claim
success.</TE>
<TE>   "I've always been a believer in vertical integration," Weinstein
said. "And, at one point, it will be successful."</TE>

<TE>   Miramax's Entertainment Empire</TE>
<TE>   Magazine Publishing</TE>
<TE>   * Talk magazine: After a much-hyped launch in 1999, the joint
venture between Miramax and Hearst collapsed less than three years
later, losing the partners a combined $54 million plus shutdown
costs.</TE>
<TE>   * Niche media: In 2001, Miramax invested $1.5 million in Jason
Binn's slick advertiser-driven magazines, which include Gotham,
Hamptons, Ocean Drive and the newly launched Los Angeles
Confidential. Its ownership stake is estimated at 10% to 15%.</TE>
<TE>   Broadway/U.K. Theater Productions</TE>
<TE>   * Miramax: Invested $750,000 in Broadway's "The Real Thing," which
bowed in April 2000 and won three Tony Awards. The Weinsteins won the
Tony as co-producers.</TE>
<TE>   * The Weinsteins: Estimated personal investments $10 million to
$12 million. Invested $1.5 million in the smash Broadway hit, "The
Producers," which won a record 12 Tonys in 2001. Other investments
include Broadway's "Mamma Mia!" and the dud "Sweet Smell of Success";
and UK productions "Chitty Chitty Bang Bang," "The Royal Family" and
"The Full Monty."</TE>
<TE>   Restaurants</TE>
<TE>   * Miramax: Part ownerships in Tribeca Grill, New York; Ago, Los
Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   * The Weinsteins:  Part ownerships in Nobu and ManRay, New York;
Dominics, Los Angeles; Balance, Martha's Vineyard.</TE>
<TE>   In-House Business</TE>
<TE>   * Miramax Films: The Weinsteins founded the New York art house
movie company named after their parents, Miriam and Max, in 1979 and
sold it to Disney in 1993 for $60 million. Today, some estimates have
valued the company at more than $1 billion. The Weinsteins have a
contract with Disney that runs through 2007. Sources say the brothers
receive a quarter to a third of the company's annual profit above a
certain threshold.</TE>
<TE>   * Dimension Films: Launched as a low-budget horror, sci-fi, action
genre label of Miramax in 1994. Under Bob Weinstein it has become a
cash cow with such mainstream hits as "Spy Kids" and "The Others."</TE>
<TE>   * Miramax/Dimension TV: The company's first three shows-- ABC's
"Wasteland," animated series "Clerks" and the WB's "Glory Days"--were
canceled in their first season. The only bright spot: HBO series
"Project Greenlight." Upcoming: Planned animated series based on "Spy
Kids"; ABC's "Wonderful World of Disney" miniseries "A Wrinkle In
Time," slated to air in November.</TE>
<TE>   Book Publishing</TE>
<TE>   * Talk Miramax Books: Launched in 1999 and headed by Tina Brown
and Jonathan Burnham, it has published seven bestsellers, including
Eoin Colfer's "Artemis Fowl" and Malika Oufkir's "Stolen Lives."
Future releases: "Leadership" by former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani
and memoirs by Madeleine Albright, Queen Noor and David Boyce. 2001
profit: $500,000. Projected 2002 profit, $1 million to $1.2 million.</TE>
<TE>   Music</TE>
<TE>   * Miramax Records: Released first movie soundtracks in 1994.
Miramax puts up 50% of the expenses and jointly owns the soundtracks
with record companies. Sony Music paid Miramax a $5-million advance
to administer its publishing catalog, which has more than 100
copyrights. The Weinsteins say the divisions is profitable.</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Question: I have a friend who is caught up in this ridiculous
tax-protester business. I want to help him before he gets into real
trouble. His main contention is that only income from foreign sources
is taxable. Would you be so kind as to send me some of the court
cases that have rejected these arguments? He says there aren't any
such cases.</LD>
<LD>   Answer: An Internet-savvy 10-year-old could find many of the cases
your friend pretends don't exist. A nice list of them, which are all
variations on the "my income isn't taxable" argument, can be found at
the Internal Revenue Service's Web site, www.irs .gov, in the IRS
Criminal Investigation section. The IRS also has a pamphlet--"Why Do
I Have To Pay Taxes?"--available on its Web site or by calling (800)
829-1040.</LD>
<LD>   The Tax Court, which has reviewed many of these cases, now
routinely fines tax protesters $5,000 to $25,000 for making what it
rightly terms "frivolous arguments" that have long been discredited.</LD>
<TE>   Your friend isn't about to be dissuaded by mere facts, however.
He's got too much invested in rationalizing his position. He'd rather
risk audits, fines and a possible prison term than admit he's wrong.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, he's still willing to use the highways, enjoy the
police and fire protection and be defended by the armed services, as
long as it's all paid for with someone else's money.</TE>
<TE>   And if he were ever to give up his bogus arguments, he'd face a
real dilemma. Because he obviously doesn't like the tax system the
way it is, he might face an ethical imperative to try to change it.</TE>
<TE>   But that would require real time and effort, which your buddy
apparently isn't willing to expend.</TE>
<TE>   Avoiding Scams Easier Than Recouping Losses</TE>
<TE>   Q: My husband will retire next year. In the last 30 years, he has
fallen for many "get rich quick" schemes against my wishes. (I find
out about these scams only after he's signed up for them.) We have
lost a lot of money, but he still thinks the next thing will work,
and of course nothing ever does. How can I put an end to this? Can we
check these companies out if they're not registered with the Better
Business Bureau? Can we get the money back after he has signed up?</TE>
<TE>   A: You can find just about everything you need to know about
spotting and avoiding scams at the Federal Trade Commission's Web
site, www.ftc.gov. You also can call the FTC at (877) FTC-HELP, or
382-4357.</TE>
<TE>   The answers to your last two questions are pretty obvious. Don't
deal with a company that's not registered with the Better Business
Bureau.</TE>
<TE>   And don't count on getting your money back after you've signed up
for these scams.</TE>
<TE>   There simply are too many of them for the government to track down
and punish the perpetrators, let alone try to get your money back.</TE>
<TE>   That doesn't mean you have to continue to suffer, however. A
spouse who refuses to behave responsibly with money can be
frightening, as he's putting both of your financial futures at risk,
but you can take some action.</TE>
<TE>   First, you might talk to your husband about what compels him to
keep trying these schemes, even though he knows deep down they won't
work.</TE>
<TE>   One reason people play losers' games, such as the lottery, is that
they feel that they have no other way to succeed, said Meir Statman,
an expert in behavioral finance at Santa Clara University. Others
believe that they haven't achieved as much as they should financially
during their lifetime.</TE>
<TE>   You may be able to make changes in your financial life to help
your husband feel less desperate about the future. Or you may need to
guide him to a therapist or a 12-step group that deals with gambling
addictions.</TE>
<TE>   Olivia Mellon's book "Overcoming Overspending: A Winning Plan for
Spenders and Their Partners" (Walker &amp; Co., 1997), also may provide
some insights.</TE>
<TE>   If your husband refuses to stop, you have some pretty drastic
measures available to you, including divorce, a legal separation of
your financial assets or a conservatorship, in which a court would
appoint you to handle his affairs.</TE>
<TE>   You would need to discuss your situation with a lawyer to
determine the best course.</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As if income-oriented investors don't have it bad enough in these
days of low interest rates, now they may have to worry about paying
tax on "phantom" income.</LD>
<LD>   Just ask Joe Miskit. The 89-year-old Laguna Woods retiree owns
preferred stock that's supposed to pay an annual dividend of about
8%. But the issuer--a subsidiary of utility owner Edison
International--suspended dividend payments in early 2001 after
suffering massive losses during the energy crisis. Edison has since
resumed paying dividends on most of its preferred stock, but the
issue Miskit owns is an exception, company officials said.</LD>
<LD>   When Miskit started preparing his 2001 tax return, he got socked
with more bad news: The preferred stock dividends that Edison didn't
pay continued to accrue. His broker issued a Form 1099 that included
this unpaid income and explained why it may be taxable even though it
wasn't received.</LD>
<TE>   "I feel this is so unjust," Miskit said. "If the company needs to
defer paying the dividends, fine. But don't tax us on it. We may
never get it."</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately, Miskit is not alone. Statistics on how many
individuals pay tax on unreceived income are hard to come by. But
many taxpayers could become acquainted with phantom income,
especially this year, said Richard Lehmann, publisher of the
Forbes/Lehmann Income Securities Investor in Miami.</TE>
<TE>   That's mainly because corporate bond defaults soared in 2001,
rising to 164 issues worth $93 billion, from 126 issues worth $35.2
billion the year before, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Default statistics aren't available for preferred stocks. However,
largely because of defaults by a few big utilities that issued
preferred stock, these also could be pushing record levels, experts
said.</TE>
<TE>   Cash-basis taxpayers--that's virtually all individuals--don't have
to pay income taxes on interest they haven't received. However,
there's an exception for certain types of bonds and preferred stocks.</TE>
<TE>   The most common exception is interest accrued on zero-coupon
bonds. These bonds are sold at a discount, but mature at face value.
The difference between the purchase price and the face value is
considered interest. Although holders of zero-coupon bonds won't
receive this interest until the bond is either redeemed at maturity
or sold, they must calculate how much interest is accumulating on the
bond each year and pay federal and state income tax on that amount.</TE>
<TE>   Increasingly, preferred stocks are being treated the same way.
Most preferred stocks sold today are structured more like bonds than
stock. That provides some tax benefits to the companies that issue
these securities, but it puts investors who hold defaulted preferred
shares in a tight squeeze at tax time, said George von Zedlitz, vice
president of fixed-income investments at Charles Schwab &amp; Co. in San
Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   Technically, it works this way: If a company gets in a bind and is
unable to pay dividends to its preferred shareholders, it is allowed
to suspend those dividends for as long as five years.</TE>
<TE>   During that period, the company--on paper--continues to record
"dividend payments." But those "payments" go into a captive trust
that accepts corporate IOUs instead of cash. The company ends up with
a tax deduction without the corresponding cash expense--a
particularly large benefit to a company in financial trouble.</TE>
<TE>   But this method of accounting also means shareholders must pay tax
on that phantom income, von Zedlitz said.</TE>
<TE>   If the company later resumes paying preferred shareholders, the
tax issue eventually evens out. The investor has simply prepaid the
tax on dividends that would be received in a "catch-up" payment
later.</TE>
<TE>   But if the dividends are never paid, investors lose out. Although
they can claim a capital loss for paying tax on the dividend payments
they never received, that write-off usually is worth less than what
the shareholders already paid in taxes on the dividend income at
their ordinary income tax rates. (Ordinary income tax rates can
exceed 38%, while the top capital gains rate is 20%.)</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes investors get phantom income even when it's likely that
the interest or dividends will never be paid. In those cases,
although you may need to report the phantom income, you should write
it off as a loss on the same year's return, Lehmann said.</TE>
<TE>   Lehmann said he had to do this when the issuer of a zero-coupon
bond he owned went into bankruptcy protection but continued to accrue
interest owed to bondholders.</TE>
<TE>   Just because you get a Form 1099 from your broker saying you owe
tax on phantom income doesn't mean it's correct, Lehmann said. "You
have to look at the nature of the security."</TE>
<TE>   Tax accountants caution that you should always declare any income
that's on a 1099 on the appropriate line on your tax return. IRS
computers match what your brokerage firm said it paid you to what you
declared on your tax return. If there's a discrepancy, your return
will be singled out for further review.</TE>
<TE>   "Always give the computer what it wants," said Vicki Mulak,
enrolled agent at American Financial &amp; Tax in Tustin. But if you're
confident you'll never see the cash, you can subtract the unreceived
income on another line of the capital gain and loss form, the
Schedule D.</TE>
<TE>   Generally speaking, the IRS does not require proof of a bad debt
or capital loss when you file your tax return. However, taxpayers
should maintain good records. If you're audited, those records can
help substantiate your position. The IRS may or may not agree in the
end, but at least you won't face onerous negligence or fraud
penalties later.</TE>

<LD>Andersen Sells Off Pieces of U.S. Business</LD>
<LD>   Accounting firm Andersen continued its slow disintegration,
reaching tentative agreements to sell pieces of its U.S. business to
rivals Deloitte &amp; Touche and KPMG.</LD>
<LD>   The firm also conceded defeat in its effort to transfer its
overseas operations to KPMG in a single deal after the Andersen
partnership in Spain decided to merge with the Deloitte office there.
The 83 individual partnerships that make up the overseas portion of
Andersen are working to cut their own deals with rival firms.</LD>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Andersen is braced to lay off up to 7,000, or 25% of
its U.S. staff, this week, possibly as early as Monday.</TE>
<TE>   And representatives of the firm met with Justice Department
officials to see whether the two sides could work out a settlement in
the criminal indictment of the firm for destroying documents sought
in the federal probe of its work for energy trader Enron Corp.</TE>
<TE>   March Job Creation  Surpasses Cutbacks</TE>
<TE>   For the first time in nearly a year, U.S. employers last month
created more jobs than they cut, but it was not enough to keep the
unemployment rate from rising slightly.</TE>
<TE>   The latest government employment figures showed that the number of
payroll jobs increased 58,000 in March, the first net gain since July
2001, and another sign that the economy is rebounding from last
year's downturn.</TE>
<TE>   The jobless rate edged up to 5.7% in March from 5.5% in February,
but remained below the 5.8% level recorded last year.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts attributed the divergent readings to different survey
methodologies and other statistical quirks.</TE>
<TE>   Oil Prices Rise on Middle East Fears</TE>
<TE>   Prices of oil futures hit a six-month high last week and retail
gasoline prices continued to rise, amid fears that escalating
violence in the Middle East would squelch petroleum supplies.</TE>
<TE>   Rising oil prices threaten the fledgling economic recovery by
adding unexpected costs to consumers as well as to manufacturing,
transportation and other business sectors, analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   The May contract for West Texas intermediate crude, the U.S.
benchmark, bumped briefly above $27 before ending the week at $26.21
a barrel on the New York Mercantile Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   The last time oil was this expensive was the week after the Sept.
11 terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Oil prices have jumped nearly 8% in the last week as a series of
suicide bombings brought the biggest military response by Israel in
decades.</TE>
<TE>   FCC Told to Review TV Ownership Limit</TE>
<TE>   A U.S. appeals court ordered federal regulators to justify a
long-standing rule barring media companies from owning more than one
TV station in about half of the nation's television markets.</TE>
<TE>   The court ordered the agency to review its duopoly rule, which
allows a company to own two stations in a small or mid-size market.
The rule was adopted in 1964 when there were only 649 television
stations in the U.S., compared with nearly 1,700 outlets today in 283
television markets.</TE>
<TE>   The ruling marked the fourth time in 18 months that federal judges
have overturned or set aside FCC regulations limiting media
ownership.</TE>
<TE>   Acquisition-minded media giants such as News Corp. and Viacom
Corp. have been pushing Washington to change ownership rules so they
can expand their empires.</TE>
<TE>   Consumer groups and some lawmakers, however, oppose the prospect
of further media consolidation, arguing that this will put greater
control over news, information and entertainment into the hands of
just a few giants.</TE>
<TE>   Adelphia to Sell Some Cable Systems</TE>
<TE>   Adelphia Communications Corp. has agreed to sell up to half of its
cable systems, worth as much as $8 billion, to pay off some of its
debt.</TE>
<TE>   John Rigas, the 77-year-old founder of Adelphia, has agreed to put
up for sale operations that include his prized Los Angeles systems,
which he acquired only two years ago, sources close to the company
said.</TE>
<TE>   Shares have fallen about 50% since the company disclosed that it
had guaranteed $2.3 billion in loans to off-balance-sheet
partnerships.</TE>
<TE>   The Securities and Exchange Commission is conducting an informal
investigation.</TE>
<TE>   Microsoft President Out in Reorganization</TE>
<TE>   Microsoft Corp. announced a shake-up in its management structure
that includes the resignation of President and Chief Operating
Officer Rick Belluzzo just 14 months after he assumed the posts.</TE>
<TE>   The reorganization ends an awkward relationship between the
software behemoth and Belluzzo, a veteran of Silicon Valley hardware
stalwarts Hewlett-Packard Co. and Silicon Graphics Inc.</TE>
<TE>   Since joining Microsoft in September 1999, insiders say, he has
failed to embrace the company's distinctive corporate culture--a
shortcoming that led to his ouster.</TE>
<TE>   Microsoft said the reorganization will give more autonomy to the
leaders of the company's core business units. Belluzzo, 48, said the
change will give him the opportunity to return to a role as CEO, a
position he held for less than two years at Silicon Graphics Inc.</TE>
<TE>   Domestic Auto Sales Continue to Hold Up</TE>
<TE>   The auto industry reported strong sales for March and the first
quarter of 2002--slightly below last year's pace but still in
near-record territory.</TE>
<TE>   Ford Motor Co., however, reported an 11.7% drop in March sales
compared with the year before, and the industry overall was down 1.6%
for the month.</TE>
<TE>   A cutthroat discounting war led by General Motors Corp. has helped
prop up the domestic car makers' sales. But few importers are
following, and their strong sales are further evidence of an economic
recovery, analysts say.</TE>
<TE>   Industry analysts also point to rising U.S. employment, consumer
spending and consumer confidence levels as signs that a broad-based
economic rebound is underway.</TE>
<TE>   Most are expecting that to translate into new-car and light-truck
sales for the year in the range of 16.3 million to 16.7 million
units.</TE>
<TE>   HP Won't Reappoint Hewlett to Its Board</TE>
<TE>   Hewlett-Packard Co. withdrew its nomination of Walter Hewlett from
its slate of directors.</TE>
<TE>   The decision effectively ousts the dissident board member who
crusaded against the company's pending $19-billion merger with Compaq
Computer Corp.</TE>
<TE>   It's the latest volley in an extraordinary battle between HP and
the son of co-founder William Hewlett.</TE>
<TE>   Walter Hewlett, 57, amassed broad support among shareholders in
opposing the merger.</TE>
<TE>   Although an official tally of the March 19 shareholder vote will
not be available for several weeks, HP Chief Executive Carly Fiorina
has declared a "slim but sufficient" margin in favor of the merger.</TE>
<TE>   Hewlett filed a lawsuit March 29 alleging that company executives
coerced a large shareholder to endorse the merger and understated the
difficulties in creating what would be the largest computer company
in the world.</TE>
<TE>   Hewlett has argued that HP's profitable printer business would be
diluted by Compaq's commitment to the struggling PC market.</TE>
<TE>   Golf Properties Firms Closer to Merger</TE>
<TE>   The board of National Golf Properties Inc. announced its approval
of a definitive merger agreement with ailing sister company American
Golf Corp. despite the objections of a major National Golf
stockholder and concern among Wall Street analysts.</TE>
<TE>   Combining the two Santa Monica-based companies, which are
controlled by Los Angeles businessman David G. Price, would create
the country's largest owner and operator of golf courses and help the
companies overcome immediate financial troubles and long-term
competitive pressures, supporters of the combination said.</TE>
<TE>   American Golf is a privately owned company that leases and
operates most of the courses owned by National Golf, a publicly
traded real estate investment trust.</TE>
<TE>   But the companies' independent auditor raised doubts about the
viability of both firms in light of financial problems and a barrage
of lawsuits, according to filings with federal regulators.</TE>
<TE>   Xerox Agrees to Pay Record SEC Fine</TE>
<TE>   Xerox Corp. agreed to pay a record $10-million fine and to restate
five years of financial results.</TE>
<TE>   The agreement in principle, subject to final approval by the
Securities and Exchange Commission, would settle an investigation
launched in 2000 of Xerox's alleged premature booking of more than $2
billion in revenue from equipment leases from 1997 through 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Under the agreement, the Stamford, Conn.-based copier giant would
neither admit nor deny wrongdoing, the company said.</TE>
<TE>   But the fine would be the highest ever for a financial reporting
violation by a public company, eclipsing the $3.5-million penalty
levied against America Online Inc. in May 2000 for allegedly
improperly inflating earnings, SEC spokesman John Nester said.</TE>

<HD>Video Game Maker Finds Shock Value</HD>

<LD>A beat-up sedan cruises up to a woman on a street corner. She climbs
in, and the car rocks back and forth. When she steps out of the car,
the driver follows, beats her to death with a baseball bat and steals
her money.</LD>
<LD>   It's not a scene from a Quentin Tarantino movie. It's a video game
called "Grand Theft Auto 3" published by Rockstar Games, a company
that established itself as the bad boy of the $20-billion global
games industry by serving up unapologetically violent titles.</LD>
<LD>   Violence is nothing new to video games, and every few years a game
comes along that stirs the puritanical pot of American sensibilities.</LD>
<TE>   What's extraordinary is that "GTA3"--in which players can hijack
cars, shoot pedestrians and kill police officers--is so over-the-top
that even industry veterans are questioning whether Rockstar is
inviting censorship by feeding an appetite among minors for prurient
games.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like selling cigarettes to kids," said Jason Rubin,
co-founder of Naughty Dog Inc., a Santa Monica game developer owned
by Sony Corp. "The game is rated for adults, but you know kids are
playing it because they think it's cool."</TE>
<TE>   Parents and politicians may cringe, but Rockstar's blend of edgy
electronic entertainment and Mafioso satire proved to be just the
right cocktail for a generation of gamers who grew up on "Pac Man"
and are itching for grittier games. "GTA3" was the industry's most
popular title in 2001, selling 3 million copies since its October
debut.</TE>
<TE>   It has generated nearly $100 million in revenue for Rockstar and
its parent, Take Two Interactive Software Inc. The company's fiscal
year ended eight days after "GTA3" launched. Take Two lost $8.6
million on $451 million in sales, compared with a $6.4-million profit
the year before on $364 million in sales. In its quarter ended Jan.
31, Take Two rebounded with a 79% increase in quarterly sales to $283
million, and record profit of $34.8 million, nearly quadruple its
fiscal first quarter last year.</TE>
<TE>   With these numbers, Take Two is a hit on Wall Street. Investors
largely have chosen to overlook an investigation by the Securities
and Exchange Commission of Take Two's finances and pushed the New
York company's stock up more than 75% since the game was released.
Take Two's stock closed Friday at $19.96 on Nasdaq.</TE>
<TE>   Take Two and Rockstar refused repeated requests for interviews to
discuss the company's games and its business.</TE>
<TE>   But that hasn't stopped others from talking about "GTA3." Sen.
Joseph I. Lieberman (D-Conn.) has called the game "troubling." Even
hard-core fans take notice of the game's violence. A posting on
Gamespot.com, a Web site for game enthusiasts, called "GTA3" "one
sick puppy."</TE>
<TE>   What worries Rubin, however, is not that "GTA3" contains violence.
It's that the game is deliberately designed to shock. The commercial
success of the title all but guarantees that other publishers will
rush to release copycat games.</TE>
<TE>   The result, Rubin said, is that mature-rated games will become
standard fare, and character-based games such as the ones Rubin
produces will be shunted into niche markets.</TE>
<TE>   Rubin points to the increase in M-rated titles in the list of best
sellers as proof. None of the top 10 titles for the PlayStation
console, which came out in 1995, was M-rated. Seven were rated E, for
everyone, and three were rated T, for teens. The same list for the
current PlayStation 2 console contains two M-rated, three T-rated and
five E-rated games.</TE>
<TE>   "There's going to be a race to be more hard-core, more violent,
more disgusting, and the nastiest will sell well," Rubin said. "At
some point, it's simply a gore fest. I worry that we will lose
control.</TE>
<TE>   "Every medium has gone through a period like this. Elvis shook his
hips and everybody went wild. But music is considered an art form.
Video games to many people aren't considered an art form, at least
not yet. They still see it as a toy, one that can be regulated like
other toys."</TE>
<TE>   Within the game industry, Rubin is in the minority.</TE>
<TE>   "When I think of censorship, I think of government regulating
content, and that's not going to happen," said Doug Lowenstein,
president of the Interactive Digital Software Assn., an industry
group based in Washington. "I see a very healthy respect for the 1st
Amendment."</TE>
<TE>   Lowenstein said the percentage of M-rated games has remained
constant at 6% to 8%. That's partly because an M rating restricts the
purchasers to those 17 years and older, limiting the potential
revenue source.</TE>
<TE>   "You won't see major publishers jumping on the ultra-violent
bandwagon," said Jason Bergman, a freelance game journalist in New
York who has followed Rockstar for several years. "It's a difficult
thing to pull off well."</TE>
<TE>   Electronic Arts Inc., the nation's largest game publisher, has
avoided publishing M-rated games. The tendency reflects the
philosophy of EA's studio president, Don Mattrick, who believes that
as game consoles move out of the basement and into living rooms, the
company should make games the entire family can play and watch. In
1999, EA refused to distribute a game called "Thrill Kill." The
controversial game featured dozens of highly graphic ways, from
dismemberment to cannibalism, to kill an opponent.</TE>
<TE>   "We're aware of the revenue potential for mature-rated games, but
we manage well-defined brands that have solid equities as E- and
T-rated products," said Jeff Brown, an EA spokesman. "Gamers ...
recognize that and would object to seeing those equities compromised
in pursuit of a trend toward gratuitous sex and violence."</TE>
<TE>   Whether Rockstar is aiming for sexually gratuitous or artistically
gratifying is unclear. "They're young men in their 20s and 30s making
games for themselves," said Edward Williams, an analyst with Gerard
Klauer Mattison &amp; Co. in New York. "Their target demographic is males
in their 20s and 30s."</TE>
<TE>   Over the years, Take Two has cultivated a bad-boy image. At an
industry trade show last year, a Take Two subsidiary, Gathering of
Developers, set up a tent with strippers and dancing midgets. At an
awards ceremony this year sponsored by the Academy of Interactive
Arts and Sciences where "GTA3" was nominated for two categories,
Rockstar was a no-show.</TE>
<TE>   Three years ago, the company's soirees acquired notoriety in New
York for the way its guests were chosen. To get invited, they had to
subject themselves to a seven-question telephone quiz designed to
gauge their worthiness. Those who gave interesting answers got
tickets.</TE>
<TE>   Take Two was founded 10 years ago by then 20-year-old Ryan A.
Brant, son of a New York real estate developer and magazine
publisher. Today he is the company's chairman. The company, which
leases its New York offices from Brant's father, went on the
acquisition trail in the late '90s.</TE>
<TE>   In 1998, it purchased Jack of All Games Inc., a distribution
business that accounts for about one-third of the company's revenue,
or $17million.</TE>
<TE>   In 1999, it spent $25 million buying distributors and studios,
including DMA Designs, the Scottish studio that develops the "GTA"
franchise.</TE>
<TE>   In 2000, it paid $6 million for Pop Top Software Inc. and $14.4
million for Gathering of Developers Inc., the makers of "Max Payne"
and the Duke Nukem franchise.</TE>
<TE>   Trouble cropped up late last year when the Securities and Exchange
Commission launched an investigation of Take Two's accounting
practices. Its chief financial officer, with just two months on the
job, resigned in December, and trading of the stock on Nasdaq halted
Jan. 22 when the company said it would postpone release of its
fiscal-year earnings. Trading resumed Feb. 15. Take Two issued
restated earnings for seven quarters to Oct. 31. A spokesman for the
SEC declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   Take Two had to later correct its restated earnings, reducing
fiscal 2000 revenue by $23 million to $364 million, and slicing
profit that year by $28.5 million to $6.4 million. Six class-action
lawsuits have been filed against Take Two on behalf of shareholders
alleging that the company misled investors. The company has said it
intends to fight the suits.</TE>
<TE>   All this doesn't seem to faze Wall Street, which has bumped up
Take Two shares more than 7% since the company restated its earnings
Feb. 15.</TE>
<TE>   "The reality is that Take Two has the right products, but it does
come with issues," Gerard Klauer analyst Williams said. "As with any
entertainment, there are certainly aspects of their games that will
offend a lot of people.</TE>
<TE>   "What investors see, though, are the financials of the company.
There are plenty of violent video games out there that don't sell
nearly as well as this one. Cash is flowing into this company at an
unbelievable clip."</TE>

<LD>In "Abortion Isn't Just a Federal Issue" (Commentary, April 2), Nancy
Sasaki makes several good points but leaves out a most important
fact: It's not just other legislatures around the country that are
introducing anti-abortion laws. Bill Simon's own party has crafted
one of the more noxious anti-abortion bills, AB 2537, which would
require any woman seeking an abortion to obtain (and, apparently, pay
for) an ultrasound. It would then require the woman to view the
ultrasound before she could have her abortion.</LD>
<LD>   I would like to know whether Simon, who tries to pretend he
wouldn't have much to do about abortion as governor, would sign a
bill like this. The fact that there is even a question about what he
would do about such grotesque legislation makes him unfit to govern.</LD>
<LD>   David Link</LD>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Sasaki's commentary on abortion states, "Californians live in a
state that sets the standard for protecting a woman's right to family
planning." Sounds to me if a woman is considering an abortion that
her "family planning" wasn't planned at all. How perfect that Gov.
Gray Davis, who couldn't plan anything other than a fund-raiser, is
in charge of protecting this so-called right.</TE>
<TE>   Frank Collier</TE>
<TE>   Long Beach</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Sasaki consistently uses the word "anti-choice," supposedly in
reference to people who are pro-life. I would like to correct her by
saying that all pro-life people are pro-choice. We choose to make
reproductive choices before a child is created. And once a child is
created we choose to give the child life rather than murder it.</TE>
<TE>   Karen Gatchel</TE>
<TE>   Camarillo</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   It's sad to see that the issues getting focused on have little
impact on the daily lives of most Californians. The next governor
will not be able to overturn Roe vs. Wade, so the abortion fight
should be saved for Supreme Court nominations. There are areas of the
abortion issue that could be addressed by the governor, but how many
people will actually be directly affected by the issue?</TE>
<TE>   Certainly not as many as those who are affected by the real
issues: the economy, education and electricity. These are the issues
that need immediate attention by the candidates, the issues that
directly affect every Californian, not just minority interest groups.</TE>

<LD>Re "Antidote to the Liberal Monotone: Blogging," Commentary, April 4:
Norah Vincent needs to be reminded that the United States was founded
and fought for by flaming liberals--men and women considered traitors
because their politics were so far left.</LD>
<LD>   She might also examine the root of the word "progressive," which
describes the politics of those she attempts to lambaste. She should
be thankful that "the self-important" Los Angeles Times holds the
liberal notion of the importance of public discussion to democracy
and therefore gave her ink space to present her viewpoint. And
finally, she should carefully examine her foundation to see if she is
actually "defending" democracy or inadvertently subverting it and
promoting its demise.</LD>

<LD>Thanks for "3rd Man Accused in Insurance Dept. Scandal," your April 3
update on former Insurance Commissioner Chuck Quackenbush. If he
continues to get away from it all while living happily ever after in
Hawaii, the people of California must admit that crime does pay in
this state.</LD>
<LD>   What he did is no better or worse than the off-balance-sheet debt
scheme concocted by certain Enron executives and their cronies. What
is wrong with both is that it takes much too long to prosecute the
main characters. Greed is not good, and those who abuse their
position and power must be brought to justice swiftly.</LD>

Between 4 and 6 p.m." signs and deploying officers in our depleted
police force (three squad cars) to trap unsuspecting motorists, he
can keep traffic flowing and pay for the new signs at the same time.
No warning, just a hefty fine. Motorists, beware at 6th Street and

<LD>Re "Pupils Shunted to Vocational Ed Fear It Can Derail College
Dreams," March 27: Where is it etched in stone that students must go
to college? Do you want us to help some students compete in the work
force or pressure all of them to go to college?</LD>
<LD>   Students in the cosmetology field can make up to $30 an hour,
according to American Salon magazine's Green Book 2000. American
Salon also indicated that the cosmetology field is one of the top
entrepreneurial fields in the world. I am a product of the Regional
Occupational Program cosmetology classes. I co-own my own salon and
can make far more than $30 per hour.</LD>
<LD>   Students may choose to make a steady $30 an hour rather than being
paid on an inconsistent basis in another profession. Give our
students credit. Many of them are smarter and savvier than your
average adult.</LD>
<TE>   So, I ask the readers, in that light, what would you choose?
Students from Palisades to Fremont might actually choose cosmetology.
If the whole story were given, the ROP vocational program would be
applauded as giving some LAUSD students a leg up and not portrayed as
"shunting" them off the college path.</TE>

<TE>   My son, a sophomore in high school, is taking rigorous academic
classes including chemistry, geometry, honors English and world
history. Next year he has signed up for Advanced Placement chemistry,
Algebra 2 and Advanced Placement U.S. history as well as an auto shop
internship.</TE>
<TE>   Right now he is not interested in going to college but is taking
college prep classes to keep his options open. If, in the future,
college admissions offices deny him entrance because of an auto shop
class, they will have proved themselves shortsighted and
narrow-minded. Learning a trade is not incompatible with a college
education.</TE>
<TE>   As our lives become more technologically sophisticated and we can
no longer repair or maintain our cars, computers, DVD players, TVs,
dishwashers or other tools, we'll require increasing numbers of
trained, educated people to do the work for us. We'll need those
people to run the businesses that provide those services. With some
vision, vocational training is a useful and purposeful supplement to
a college education rather than a stumbling block to getting that
education.</TE>

the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit."</LD>
<LD>   Many of the friends and family members who crowded around the
10-foot-wide baptismal pool said they had never before seen a
Catholic baptism by immersion. For centuries it has been far more
common for priests to perform the sacrament by pouring holy water
over a new member's forehead from a washbasin-size bowl.</LD>
<LD>   In recent years, however, the Christian tradition that dates back
to St. John the Baptist but rarely has been associated with Catholics
is once again finding its place in Roman Catholic churches. No doubt
the rite will become even more familiar in Los Angeles once the new
Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels is dedicated this summer. There,
a baptismal font 12 feet wide, nearly three feet deep and very
similar to the one at St. Maximilian Kolbe, will claim a prime space
right at the entrance to the sanctuary.</LD>
<TE>   The cathedral's model will set the standard for Catholic churches
across the L.A. archdiocese, says Father Richard Vosko, liturgical
design consultant for the building. "It's a font," he says. "If you
call it a 'pool' people think of a Jacuzzi."</TE>
<TE>   At present, fewer than a dozen such permanent structures can be
found in the Los Angeles archdiocese, which includes Santa Barbara,
Ventura and Los Angeles counties and has close to 300 parishes. Many
Catholic churches set up temporary fonts at Easter and leave them in
place for several months afterward, until the feast of Pentecost.</TE>
<TE>   Vosko has worked on the interior design of worship spaces across
the country, following guidelines established after the Second
Vatican Council 40 years ago. The drama of all-encompassing baptism
in a modern font makes tangible the life-changing experience of
conversion, council leaders reasoned. They also decided that Easter,
when Christians celebrate Christ's Resurrection, is the ideal season
for converts to enter the church, although the sacrament can be
administered at any time.</TE>
<TE>   St. Maximilian Kolbe's sanctuary is barely 2 years old and was
designed before there were parish members to consult about the
details. Likewise, at the new cathedral, Cardinal Roger M. Mahony and
his advisors have had the luxury of making design decisions without a
congregation. But in some parishes, members resist the insertion of a
large font. Such has been the case at St. Charles Borromeo in North
Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   "It's unnecessarily elaborate, extremely messy and it looks like a
hot tub," says Joseph Gonzalez, chairman of the church's
preservationist guild, a group that formed several weeks ago after
the church pastor, Father Robert Gallagher, invited Father Vosko to
give a slide show of church interiors including some of his own
designs.</TE>
<TE>   "A font should be large enough for adults to kneel in it,"
Gallagher says. For now he doesn't plan any changes, only more
discussions, he says. And eventually, perhaps, a fund-raiser. A font
costs at least $35,000, with plumbing and heating, purifiers and jets
that stir the water for a flowing sensation.</TE>
<TE>   Vosko is not a stranger to controversies such as the one at St.
Charles Borromeo. Several years ago his plan for a redesign of the
interior of the Cathedral of St. John the Evangelist in Milwaukee,
which included a large font and other revisions, led to a face-off
between resistant parishioners, a canon lawyer representing them and
Milwaukee Archbishop Rembert G. Weakland. In the end, Weakland flew
to Rome to meet with Cardinal Jorge Medina of the Vatican's
Congregation of Divine Worship to discuss plans for the cathedral.
The renovation was dedicated in February without further problems,
Weakland said.</TE>
<TE>   New churches, and those undergoing renovation, are supposed to
include a large font, says Vosko, who refers to legislation by the
bishops that also calls for moving the altar and the pulpit closer to
the pews and creating a separate area for the tabernacle that holds
consecrated Communion bread. The new cathedral includes all of these
features.</TE>
<TE>   "An immersion font is not a trend," he says.</TE>
<TE>   Erica Wallian, 37 and a mother of four, was baptized at St.
Maximilian Kolbe's Easter Vigil. Beforehand, given the choice, she
would have opted for something more private. "I thought I'd feel
embarrassed about getting into the water," she says. "I didn't want
anyone watching me." But by the time she had completed a full
immersion baptism, she had changed her mind about how things should
be done. "I think adults have to go into the pool," she says. "You
have to put yourself out there about your relationship with God."</TE>
<TE>   Wallian says her Catholic brother-in-law was shocked to hear what
she was preparing for. "When I told him how I would be baptized in a
pool he said, 'What church is it?'" But early Christians didn't know
any other way.</TE>
<TE>   "In the 1st century," says Vosko, "the setting for baptism was
rivers and streams. By the 3rd century, Christians gathered in house
churches, and converts were baptized in a pool or a tub in a separate
room. For several centuries, adult [rather than infant] baptism was
the norm. The thinking was, you need to be an adult to make a
commitment."</TE>
<TE>   By the Middle Ages, however, parishes were using small fonts and
baptizing infants. A group of African bishops requested a change in
the 1950s, saying they wanted something more dramatic to inspire
adult converts entering the church. For the first time in 12
centuries, baptism by immersion was encouraged.</TE>
<TE>   While church hierarchy and some feisty parishioners tussle over
the addition of new fonts, the men and women baptized at St.
Maximilian Kolbe have more personal matters concerning their faith in
mind.</TE>
<TE>   Alan Brauer and his three preteens all entered the church last
Saturday. "This brings my family closer together," says Brauer, who
is in his 50s. "The important thing is getting closer to God."</TE>

<HD>Alfred E. Neuman, Corporate Pitchman? It Is a Mad World</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Regarding "It's a Mad World of Endorsements" (March 19): Alfred E.
Neuman, that silly-grinned, gaptoothed, freckle-faced high priest of
antiestablishment has become a traitor, a turncoat, by shamefully
selling out to corporate America.</LD>
<LD>   The mere thought of seeing Alfred the Great promoting milk, jeans
and buttoned-down Oxford shirts makes me cringe because he has now
become one of "them."</LD>
<LD>   Who else can we now turn to for a biting satiric barrage of
criticism against the established order, corporate greed and our
overly excessive material world? Certainly not Alfred, because even
he is now indulging in the world of image over substance, shamefully
getting his teeth fixed so he could look more physically pleasing for
a milk ad.</LD>
<TE>   Perhaps the spelling of Alfred's last name should be changed to
Newman, because he certainly seems to be a "new man," emphasizing
wealth, materialism and external appearance over exposing the
absurdities of the lifestyles of the rich, powerful and famous. And
the world is unfortunately a far worse place as a result.</TE>

<HD>Let's Play (Dodge) Ball at School, or Maybe Not</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A few things I remember about dodge ball ("Critics Aim to Bounce
Dodge Ball Off the Schoolyard," March 18):</LD>
<LD>   * It was never an assigned sport but an optional activity.</LD>
<LD>   * It was essentially an elementary school game played at recess
rather than during gym class and was overseen by a yard monitor and
not a "lazy physical education teacher."</LD>
<TE>   * Contrary to the tone of the article that implies this game
preyed on the not-so-physically inclined, dodge ball does not require
the speed, strength and skill of baseball, basketball, etc.
Therefore, it is the ideal medium for the skinny, slow, nerdy type to
blast the schoolyard bully in the brisket.</TE>
<TE>   This all sounds like just one more attempt by boomer parents--in
addition to play dates, organized sports, etc.--to prove to one and
all that their sons and daughters are not beyond their command.</TE>
<TE>   EARL E. ALBERT</TE>
<TE>   Temple City</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I support the regulation of such a ridiculous game as dodge ball.
When I was a kid, I sat in class trying to ignore the physical pains
caused by being hit in the back or stomach by an overzealous larger
child.</TE>
<TE>   It didn't hurt my feelings, but constant pain was not conducive to
learning, and it sure didn't teach me anything good about the way of
the world. But it was a game that teachers forced me to play.</TE>
<TE>   Those who support such a game would rather have the dog-eat-dog
mentality remain the way of the world. Those who believe it is
possible to change such things apparently have no rights.</TE>
<TE>   Since when did bullying become a required course of study?</TE>

<LD>Regarding the book about the Wilhelm Gustloff sinking ("We, the
Victims Too," March 18): Yes, it was a tragedy, but there was a war
on, in case the Germans forgot. Hard to imagine that, since they
started it. And many others suffered a lot worse than the Germans,
and because of the Germans. So do I feel bad that the Germans
suffered during the war? Let me think ... no, can't say that I do.</LD>

<TE>   The article about Gunter Grass' novel about the sinking of a
German ship in 1945 in the Baltic Sea with 9,000 fugitives and
soldiers carried the headline "We, the Victims Too": It should have
read "We, the Victims Too ... of Hitler."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>As past national chairmen of the Anti-Defamation League, we are
intimately familiar with its celebrated fact-finding abilities. We
cannot allow the inaccuracies in Al Martinez's March 28 column ("On a
Mission to Foster Peace Among Angelenos") to go unanswered.</LD>
<LD>   Martinez's admiration for David Lehrer is justified, and we share
it. His claims of Lehrer's allegedly unique knowledge are not
justified. The information Martinez received from Lehrer on the Ku
Klux Klan, the American Nazi Party, David Duke, other extremists,
hate on the Internet and all other racist activities and
organizations other than that which was local to Southern California
emanated from ADL's national office, not the ADL Los Angeles office.
This factual, credible material was utilized by Lehrer as well as
every other one of the league's 30 regional directors.</LD>
<LD>   We are also concerned that in his enthusiasm for his friend
Lehrer, he chose to seriously impugn ADL national director Abraham
Foxman, whom he has never even met, in the nastiest, crassest
possible way.</LD>

<CX>   Wrong signature--A letter that appeared in Southern California
Living on Sunday in response to a column by Al Martinez ("On a Mission to
Foster Peace Among Angelenos") bore the names of three writers. Only two
people wrote the letter. They were Maxwell E. Greenberg and Burton S.
Levinson, past national chairmen of the Anti-Defamation League. The
third, Aaron Levinson, interim regional director of the Anti-Defamation
League, was mistakenly identified as one of the authors.</CX>

<HD>Couple Who Are Campaign Foes Manage to Keep Politics in Its
Place</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELLEN WARREN</AU>
<BD>CHICAGO TRIBUNE</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Don't even think about telling this couple that politics makes
strange bedfellows.</LD>
<LD>   They've heard it so often, "It's nauseating, at this point," says
Mary Ann Gearhart Deutsche. They might be sick of it but she and her
husband, Lee Deutsche, are likely to hear a lot more of the tired
phrase in the coming months.</LD>
<LD>   She's an ardent Republican. He's a passionate Democrat. And the
newlyweds are running against each other in the November election.
Both are seeking seats on the Will County (Ill.) Board.</LD>
<TE>   As the election draws closer, will Lee and Mary Ann be able to
resist the temptation to "go negative"? When the campaign moves into
high gear after Labor Day, is trash talk inevitable?</TE>
<TE>   And, taking it to the bottom line, can the Deutsches' new (since
Jan. 5) marriage survive the very public face-off this fall?</TE>
<TE>   They laughed. "There aren't that many issues that are that
divisive," says Mary Ann, although Lee cautions, "There will be
some."</TE>
<TE>   But, on the single most significant issue in Will County, the
Deutsches are in full accord. Both oppose a third airport at Peotone.</TE>
<TE>   On that matter, family farmer Lee can speak literally when he says
"not in my backyard." The proposed site for the airport would take
over at least a portion of the acreage straddling the border between
Monee and Crete Township. He works the land with his brother, David,
and sons Darren and Kyle.</TE>
<TE>   Because of the size of the close-knit community where they both
have been active, Lee and Mary Ann have known each other for many
years. Both lost their spouses within a three-month span in 1989-90,
but they didn't begin dating until 1998 when Lee, now 60, campaigned
and won his first term on the Will County Board. Mary Ann, now 51,
was seeking re-election to the board where she has held a seat since
1985.</TE>
<TE>   So, their relationship already has survived one election
cycle--where both candidates took the high road. "You always put
forth the positive," says Mary Ann.</TE>
<TE>   If they could be persuaded to be even a little combative and
unpleasant, their election contest would sound like a sitcom or,
even, a movie. Think a politics version of "Adam's Rib," the
courtroom classic in which Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn are
married attorneys on opposite sides of an attempted murder trial. Or,
a variation on the real-life story of Mary Matalin and James
Carville, the romantically involved political opposites behind the
1992 presidential campaigns. Matalin and Carville got married, wrote
a bestselling book, did an American Express ad campaign and had two
children.</TE>
<TE>   OK. Perhaps the Will County story of Lee and Mary Ann isn't quite
the stuff of an ad campaign. For starters, in the interest of full
disclosure, the couple notes that while they are running against each
other, both could win.</TE>
<TE>   The arcane way the Will County Board is elected means that there
are now five candidates (three Republicans and two Democrats) running
for a total of three seats allotted to District 1 on the 27-member
board. Incumbents Deutsche and Gearhart Deutsche could both be
winners.</TE>
<TE>   It was mutual admiration for each other's commitment to bettering
their community that provided the first "spark" between the two of
them, Mary Ann says, but "not the only. I can tell you that."</TE>
<TE>   On other fronts, they're also compatible. Both rooted for Duke in
the recent NCAA tournament--and lamented the upset loss to Indiana
University.</TE>
<TE>   And, finally, says Mary Ann, "We're both very avid Cub fans!"</TE>

<LD>I have never been one of those mothers easily moved to reminiscing at
the sight of a baby. I enjoyed my daughters' infancies--the sweet
smells and smiles, the coos and cries, the discovery each day of some
new delight.</LD>
<LD>   But three trips through babyhood satisfied my cravings enough that
since then I have been content to cuddle a baby, then hand the bundle
back to mom or dad.</LD>
<LD>   So I wasn't expecting to wind up wistful after spending four days
last month with my infant nephew, whose every smile and gurgle
recalled for me the early days of mothering and their sweet
simplicity.</LD>
<TE>   And I wasn't prepared for the discovery that looking back can make
looking ahead that much tougher. Now I'm overloaded with memories
that make it painfully bittersweet to rise to the latest challenge of
mothering--preparing my oldest child to leave home.</TE>
<TE>   My girls and I went to Northern California on a dual mission last
month. We wanted to get to know 4-month-old Everett, the newest
member of our extended family. And we planned to tour local
universities for my oldest daughter, who'll be heading to college
next year. But something about that juxtaposition amped up the
emotional wallop unexpectedly for me.</TE>
<TE>   It's not just that the baby resembles my daughter as she looked 16
years ago--big, dark eyes; chubby cheeks; spit dribbling from a mouth
always ready to grin.</TE>
<TE>   It's that he reminds me of the relentless march of time, which
remakes us as it changes our children; and how they fill, then
vanish, from our lives.</TE>
<TE>   The last time we saw this baby, he did little more than eat and
sleep. Now he grabs our fingers, sucks on his toes, laughs at our
antics, bounces to music on TV. His once-flailing fists can grip a
rattle or hold a bottle. When he smiles, we can see the white nubs of
emerging teeth.</TE>
<TE>   My daughters marvel at how he's grown, how much different he
looks, how much more sociable he's become. I notice something
else--that he has learned to recognize his mother. His face lights up
at the sight of her or the sound of her voice; his body stiffens, his
arms get to waving, he calls out to her with gurgles and laughs.</TE>
<TE>   I remember when I had that power, when my mere presence was enough
to set my babies' world right. Now my firstborn lounges in the next
room, oblivious to me, sorting through brochures from the colleges we
plan to see. She studies student profiles and campus photos, trying
to find her own reflection, not in her mother's eyes this time, but
in a world away from me.</TE>
<TE>   Friends who have traveled this route and sent their children off
to college urge me to think of it as an adventure, a chance to see my
daughter through new eyes, to regard her as an emerging adult. We
will be partners in making a decision that will help chart the course
of her life.</TE>
<TE>   I try to keep this in mind as we pull onto the first campus on our
list. She is heading toward independence, but that does not mean my
job is done. "Go on ahead," I tell her. "I'll park the car." I see
the tour group forming in the distance. As usual, I have made her
late. She likes to be early; I'm always running behind.</TE>
<TE>   She slams the door and heads off to join them, a dozen prospects
and their families massed around a perky young woman whose voice is
not loud enough to rise over the din of cars and construction. The
teenagers move closer; perhaps to hear, or maybe to assert their
independence by distancing themselves from moms and dads. They
discreetly check out one another and pose questions we wouldn't think
to ask--about dorm food and off-campus nightspots and whether the
students here are really as stuck-up as everyone says.</TE>
<TE>   And the parents study not only dorms and classrooms, but the faces
and voices and body language of children about to step out on their
own. I get the feeling that the question they'd most like answered is
the same one I am pondering, as I push a stroller with a sleeping
baby behind a daughter who seems suddenly grown.</TE>
<TE>   How did we get from there to here so fast?</TE>

<LD>Start them young. That's been standard operating procedure ever since
Walter Grauman established the Music Center Spotlight Awards as a
springboard for young talent 14 years ago. And the bar gets higher
every year.</LD>
<LD>   Fewer than 200 students auditioned in 1988; now nearly 1,400 apply
for the competitions. Each fall, applications are sent to public and
private high schools from San Diego to Santa Barbara. After regional
auditions and semifinalist competitions, the dozen finalists who
perform at the annual gala are chosen.</LD>
<LD>   "The Spotlight Awards exemplify the power of arts education in the
lives of all young people," said awards chairman Fred Roberts. The
finalists, ages 15 to 18, who appeared on the Dorothy Chandler
Pavilion stage Tuesday night credited their success to early exposure
to the arts and dedicated teachers.</LD>
<TE>   This year's winners and runners-up, who receive $5,000 and $2,500
respectively in prize money, are:</TE>
<TE>   In classical dance, Diane Booth of Newport Beach and Nicole Clarke
of Santa Maria; in nonclassical dance, Timo Nunez-Bellamy of Santa
Barbara and Stacey Aung of La Habra; in classical instrumental,
Yevgeniy Milyavsky of Tarzana and Ying-Hsueh Chen of Idyllwild; in
jazz instrumental, Drake Price of Los Angeles and Mahesh Balasooriya
of Hollywood; in classical voice, Alexandra Lee of Monte Nido and
Lisa Algozzini of Irvine; in nonclassical voice, Georgina Concepcion
of Phelan and Sharon Youngblood of Arleta.</TE>
<TE>   Judges included John Meehan, Gerald Arpino, Rebecca Wright,
Vincent Patterson, Toni Basil, Kenny Ortega and Julie McDonald in the
dance categories; Esa-Pekka Salonen, Martin Chalifour, Deborah Borda,
Kevin Eubanks, Horace Silver and Gerald Wilson in the instrumental
categories; Rodney Gilfry, Suzanna Guzman, David Romano, Tony Berg,
Hal David and Gary LeMel in the vocal categories.</TE>
<TE>   For actor John Ritter, who emceed, it was a homecoming of sorts.
He noted he launched his professional career at the pavilion--as an
upper-balcony usher, while attending USC. After a standing ovation
for the artists, nearly 900 attended the gala post-performance dinner
in the pavilion's Grand Hall, where the menu included
stick-to-the-ribs steak and mashed potatoes, rich desserts and
caramel apples.</TE>
<TE>   The show's producer-director was Jeff Margolis. Bank of America,
represented at the event by Leticia Aguilar, is principal program
sponsor; Helen and Peter Bing are among longtime program benefactors.</TE>
<TE>   The event dinner, sponsored by the Fraternity of Friends, was
chaired by Dennis Beck and his wife, Pamela. Proceeds will benefit
the Music Center's Fund for the Performing Arts.</TE>

<TE>   Junior League</TE>
<TE>   Andrea L. Van de Kamp and Carol Keith Mancino were honored by
members of the Junior League of Los Angeles at their spring gala
benefit, In Concert With Los Angeles, at the Regent Beverly Wilshire
Hotel Monday.</TE>
<TE>   From the halls of academe to the intrigues of the fine-art auction
world, Van de Kamp has become the quintessential volunteer. As the
first woman to chair the board of governors of the Music Center since
its founder, Dorothy Buffum Chandler, stepped down in 1976, she
oversees its 35 volunteer groups, which total more than 3,000
members. For her accomplishments, which include a leadership role in
the $200-million campaign to build Walt Disney Concert Hall, Van de
Kamp received the league's 2002 Lifetime Community Achievement Award
presented by architect Frank Gehry and conductor Salonen.</TE>
<TE>   "Andrea and I have been hanging out together for a long time,"
Gehry said. "I'm really not sure what she does. I guess she does
fund-raising, but Esa-Pekka and I are grateful for whatever she
does."</TE>
<TE>   A member of the Los Angeles league since 1983, Mancino received
this year's Spirit of Volunteerism Award from past awardee Nancy
Munger. A former Robinsons-May executive, Mancino serves as president
of the Council of the Children's Burn Foundation and the Getty House
Foundation and is on the boards of the Young Musicians Foundation,
Planned Parenthood of Los Angeles, the YWCA, Good Shepherd Center for
Homeless Women, Cuisine a Roulettes (Meals on Wheels), the Friends of
Robinson Gardens, Club 100 of the Music Center, the Costume Council
of the L.A. County Museum of Art, and Sonance of the House Ear
Institute.</TE>
<TE>   The event raised nearly $225,000 for league programs.</TE>
<TE>   Singer Susan Egan entertained at the gala; weatherman Fritz
Coleman oversaw the auction. Brenda Adrian chaired the gala
committee, which included Dale Harbour Day, president of the
1,100-member L.A. league; Claire O'Reilly, Andrea Korpita, Valerie
Baldwin, C.C. Pulitzer-Lehmann, Lainie Rose, Wendi Woods-Chandler,
Carolyn Enenstein and Gayle Wilder.</TE>

<TE>   Family Services</TE>
<TE>   The Sophisticates support group of the Assessment and Treatment
Services Center celebrated the food and styles of Spain at its 19th
annual luncheon and fashion show at the Hyatt Regency Irvine.</TE>
<TE>   More than 400 guests attended the Pasion y Romance benefit, which
featured tapas and sangria followed by a parade of fashions--from
toreador pants to flamenco-inspired skirts--provided by Nordstrom.</TE>
<TE>   Net proceeds of $150,000 will be used for ATSC's family counseling
programs. "In our 28 years, we've treated almost 10,000 families, and
not one of them has had to pay because of events like this and people
like you," said Tim Allen, executive director of the Newport
Beach-based facility that offers behavioral and academic evaluations

<HD>Adults Find Their Inner Sponge</HD>
<DH>Offbeat cartoon with a simple message has attracted a loyal
grown-up following.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BETTIJANE LEVINE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>We are at the Goo Lagoon, a sunny strand of shore beneath a flowered
sky in the underwater town of Bikini Bottom. Our hero, SpongeBob
SquarePants, is too weak to compete in the weightlifting contest. But
he's too naive to know it. So he flashes his gap-tooth grin,
optimistically pumps his spindly limbs--they're barely strong enough
for his rectangular yellow sink-sponge body--and confronts this
challenge as he does all others: squarely.</LD>
<LD>   Alas, he cannot hoist the twig, which is weighted with a single
marshmallow at either end. Worse yet, he rips his square, brown pants
while trying. And so begins another episode in the excellent undersea
life of America's newest cult cartoon hero.</LD>
<LD>   About 50 million viewers watch SpongeBob SquarePants every month.
About 30 million of them are children (the target audience is ages 2
to 11). The little yellow guy recently surpassed "Rugrats," becoming
No. 1 in kids' TV ratings. But what of the other 20 million
spongeheads--adults who say they compulsively tune in to this
invertebrate cast of honest, upbeat, innocent characters? (SpongeBob
and his starfish friend, Patrick, once took a free balloon without
asking and then turned themselves in for stealing.)</LD>
<TE>   The cartoon dreamed up for kids has turned out to be a kind of
brain balm for stressed-out grown-ups, folks who are tired of
swimming with the sharks, of dealing with red alerts, job wars,
Enron. People who'd like to get away from it all--at least from the
neck up.</TE>
<TE>   Even SpongeBob's creator, Steve Hillenburg, 40, hasn't a handle on
SpongeBob's success with adults. "I just dreamed him up. I can't say
why he's popular," he says from his office at Nickelodeon's Burbank
studios. Hillenburg, like his personable protagonist, turns out to be
more visual than verbal--and has lots of marine expertise.</TE>
<TE>   Tales are surfacing across the country of adult SpongeBobians who
feel a need for daily therapy with the little yellow fellow. In San
Francisco, painter Megan Archer, 31, and her artist friends are
"really into SpongeBob" for his "cool look," for the music (she
breaks into the SpongeBob theme song while being interviewed) and the
story thrust. "It's silly and simple. It deals with feelings. Someone
may be mad and they don't know why they're mad, and so they all try
to figure it out together. They're like one big happy family."</TE>
<TE>   The show airs four times a day (morning, noon, evening and night),
so SpongeBob fans have ample choice of when to send their brains on
vacation. Those who want an extended holiday can veg out for hours
with Nickelodeon's occasional SpongeBob marathons--the longest so far
has been seven hours.</TE>
<TE>   Though many adults got hooked on SpongeBob all by themselves,
others were reeled in by kids and soon fell into a multi-generation
viewing pattern. A divorced father in Orange County, for example,
enjoys the show on weekends with his 12-year-old son and 60-year-old
father. In New York, attorney Andy Borden watches with his 6-year-old
son, Matthew, and then they sometimes call Matthew's 40-year-old
SpongeBob-fan aunt, who lives in Illinois, to discuss the episode.
"It's a way for them to bond long distance. The plot is what a child
can relate to, but it's bizarre enough to tickle adult funny bones,"
Borden says. A woman in Saugus, who first met SpongeBob as a screen
saver on her grandchild's computer, says she tuned in to see what it
was all about: "I find myself watching when I'm nervous. It calms
me."</TE>
<TE>   Since SpongeBob's image recently started appearing on
merchandise--from small cuddle toys for toddlers to air freshener for
adults--it has racked up impressive figures. So far, $500 million
worth of T-shirts, key chains, stickers, video games and software has
sold nationwide. SpongeBob is also perking up sales for firms that
have licensed his image on fast food, breakfast cereal and ice cream
containers. In the works: a feature-length SpongeBob movie.</TE>
<TE>   Cyma Zarghami, Nickelodeon's New York-based executive vice
president, says it took about 16 months for the SpongeBob phenomenon
to take full hold. The first episode aired in 1999 as the network's
first original Saturday morning kids' series.</TE>
<TE>   The big question for industry types who would like to emulate
SpongeBob's success is the same one some adults ponder as they watch:
What's so compelling about these silly sea creatures who live, walk,
drive, sing and talk in an environment that defies all laws of
physics? What's so lovable about a sponge who lives in a pineapple,
adores his job as an underpaid fry cook, and strives only to do it
better each day?</TE>
<TE>   Professor Robert Thompson, director of the Center for the Study of
Popular Television at Syracuse University in upstate New York, says
watching SpongeBob is like having "a really nice aquarium in your
living room--with voices and action."</TE>
<TE>   "It's so gentle and soothing to watch," he says. "It's a kind of
time machine that transports parents back to when they watched TV in
their footie [pajamas]. It has the look of a classic old show and a
certain innocence and wholesomeness of attitude that is clearly a
throwback to a simpler time," he says.</TE>
<TE>   "On the other hand, it's very hip in the way it's presented. It is
very edgy to adults who know how to read and listen between the
frames. There is irony and parody, but even that seems sincere and
open." On campuses, he says, there are 19- and 20-year-olds who
wouldn't be caught dead watching an episode of "Friends" who would
not miss a single episode of SpongeBob.</TE>
<TE>   Such popularity for a show that smartly hypes innocence and ethics
is heartening to those who see the doomsday clock ticking and
desperately want to turn it back. Indeed, if SpongeBob ruled, the
worst that might ever happen is you'd get your burger without the
pickle. (And he'd regret having ruined your dining experience.)</TE>
<TE>   The basically six-character cast includes SpongeBob's best friend,
Patrick--a pink starfish who lacks radial symmetry and dumbly suns
himself until he turns rigid. And SpongeBob's pet snail, Gary, who
meows like a cat and writes poetry. And the snide Squidward, an
irritable octopus who works as a waiter, plays the clarinet and
subscribes to Martha Stewart Living.</TE>
<TE>   Sandy Cheeks, a girl squirrel from Texas (one of two vertebrates
in the cast), lives in a pressurized dome and always wears diving
attire. They are all squeaky-clean, lead simple lives and use their
limited talents to enjoy life to its fullest, while earnestly trying
to love one another.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, there's the odd bit of violence, like a snowball to the
head. Or bondage, as when SpongeBob is tied to a chair by the town
meanie, one-eyed Plankton. But mean is different than evil. There is
no evil, not even a sense of menace, in SpongeBob's soggy, safe
world. Watching the show is no more subversive (or mentally
challenging) than watching old films of Laurel and Hardy, who were
two of Hillenburg's childhood idols. Every challenge SpongeBob meets
is one he can beat by employing such old-fashioned virtues as hard
work, honesty, humility and respect for his fellow creatures. Each
silly, surreal episode amounts to a little morality play.</TE>
<TE>   "The morality we all grew up with and are accustomed to is what
feels right," says Hillenburg, who grew up in Anaheim in the '70s.
"It's basically fair play. You shouldn't steal. Those sort of things.
When SpongeBob's perseverance shines through, and you root for
him--that's when the show is working."</TE>
<TE>   It's easy to picture Hillenburg as a child. His face is still
boyish and round, framed by longish brown hair reminiscent of a '60s
surfer. His eyes are the shocker--an intense pale blue as luminous as
the water in those Hawaiian coves he likes to imagine when he's
stressed out. "For me personally, snorkeling in a cove in
Hawaii--floating along and looking at all the animals and the colors.
I mean, that's pretty peaceful. Everybody's got some fascination with
undersea life, don't you think? It's so incredible.... "</TE>
<TE>   Well, not exactly. What's really incredible is that he came up
with this oddball, off-center concept that looks and sounds
refreshingly new, even to grown-ups familiar with the total cartoon
canon. From early Looney Tunes and Disney right up through "Ren &amp;
Stimpy," "The Simpsons" and "South Park," nothing is much like the
land of Bikini Bottom. ("The name refers to the Pacific atoll," he
says, ignoring reference to the nether end of a swimsuit.)</TE>
<TE>   The cartoon's colors are quasi-Hawaiian, but not jarringly so. The
music is likewise--island sounds mixed with old-fashioned sea
ditties, tunes reminiscent of the Beach Boys, country, even diluted
heavy metal. The look is bright and happy--but it does take place,
after all, underwater. So there's a subliminal sense of submersion.
The aquatic theme even extends to things not perceived by viewers as
aquatic. The outlines of flowers in the sky, for example, are also
the shapes of jellyfish floating in the ocean. Hillenburg is big on
jellyfish. His cartoon hero hunts them--for the jelly.</TE>
<TE>   Since he sold his SpongeBob concept to Nickelodeon in 1998,
Hillenburg has worked in his own approximation of a dim, underwater
world--a windowless, cozily cluttered room lit by a shaded lamp in
the company's Burbank complex.</TE>
<TE>   He says that at 40 he's the "old man" of the 50-person SpongeBob
creative team he now heads, most of them guys in their 20s and 30s.
"For some reason, not many women go into cartooning."</TE>
<TE>   Even after all this time, though, Hillenburg looks like a fish out
of water in this corporate condition. His childhood in Anaheim was
marked by three loves, he says: "Diving, snorkeling and drawing. I
got very fascinated with the ocean. I started diving at about 15.
That's what really clicked me into wanting it to be a career."</TE>
<TE>   He loved invertebrates from the beginning, he says. "They're
bizarre and interesting because they're not all warm and cuddly.
Their shapes are strange, they have hard shells, they have things
growing on them." And so, of course, the characters in his wacky
cartoon have the same strangeness.</TE>
<TE>   Hillenburg's mother taught visually impaired students; his father
was an aerospace draftsman and designer. After graduating Humboldt
State in 1984, he started what he thought would be his life's work:
teaching marine science to kids at the Orange County Marine
Institute. "We taught tide-pool ecology, nautical history, diversity
and adaptation," he says. "Working there, I saw how enamored kids are
with undersea life, especially with tide-pool creatures." But three
years was enough. He decided drawing might be the better career. He
returned to school and in 1992 received a master's degree in
experimental animation from California Institute of the Arts in
Valencia.</TE>
<TE>   He soon came up with the premise for his show. "Basically, the
core premise is that innocence prevails--which I don't think it
always does in real life," Hillenburg says.</TE>
<TE>   Hillenburg works from about 9 to 7 each day, then heads for the
Hollywood home he shares with his son, 3, and his wife, Karen, a chef
who teaches at the New School of Cooking in Culver City.</TE>
<TE>   His average day involves supervision on preliminary drawings,
words, soundtracks, editing, color and other details. SpongeBob is
put together in an unusual way, he says. First, a team comes up with
each story premise, a kind of outline for the segment. That's handed
off to another team of two who create a storyboard. This means they
draw the action frames and come up with the words simultaneously on a
board that looks "kind of like a comic book." Finished storyboards
are sent to Rough Draft Studios in Korea, where the animation is
done. The film comes back to Burbank, where the sound, music and
editing are completed. Comedian Tom Kenny (who also plays the dog in
the cartoon "CatDog") is the voice of SpongeBob. Bill Fagerbakke, who
played Dauber in ABC's "Coach" series, is Patrick Starfish.</TE>
<TE>   When complete, the words and pictures are inseparable. And they
convey what many viewers see as a kind of sweetness that prevails,
even when insults are hurled.</TE>
<TE>   Andy Moseley, 20, a student at Georgia Southern University, says
he heard about SpongeBob last April and was soon watching every night
at 8. "I couldn't miss, or my day wouldn't be complete," he says.
"The mood is so wonderful, happy and carefree." When Moseley wears
his red SpongeBob T-shirt on campus, "it amazes me how many people
know who he is. I think it's great to have SpongeBob around in
America at this point is time."</TE>
<TE>   SpongeBob is "pretty big" at Indiana University, where Vicki
Berdon is working toward a doctorate in philosophy and foundations of
math. "Almost everybody loves it. It's sort of insane. People wear
the shirts, socks, have all sorts of paraphernalia. It's even popular
with graduate students."</TE>
<TE>   Berdon says she watches "because it's cute, sometimes even
hysterically funny." She particularly likes the nutty touches, "like
the crazy dance SpongeBob does when he's blowing his complicated
bubbles, a dance to make sure they come out just right." Mostly, she
says, she watches because "it's a relief. I find it's very good at
distracting me from the news. Before I go to sleep, I don't want to
think about the Middle East, the terrorist threats, the Afghan
situation. This is all very present in my mind. So I turn SpongeBob
on."</TE>

<LD>Megan stopped her scooter. Dee Dee was standing in the street. She
was looking at the sky.</LD>
<LD>   "What are you doing?" Megan shouted.</LD>
<LD>   "It's so close you can almost touch it," Dee Dee said.</LD>
<TE>   A light mist was falling. "That's just a rainbow."</TE>
<TE>   "There's a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow," Dee Dee said.</TE>
<TE>   "That's not true," Megan told her.</TE>
<TE>   Dee Dee wasn't listening. "It's in the park. Come on."</TE>
<TE>   Megan dropped her scooter and followed. "This is really dumb.
There's no pot of gold in the park or anywhere!"</TE>
<TE>   Dee Dee searched the bushes. "Find the end of the rainbow. Look
under the bushes."</TE>
<TE>   "You won't ever find it," Megan said. "It's only a fairy tale."</TE>
<TE>   "What is?" Dee Dee asked.</TE>
<TE>   "The pot of gold story. Someone made it up. Rainbows come when
it's raining and the sun is shining. There's no pot of gold at the
end."</TE>
<TE>   "When we find it we'll be rich and happy all our lives," Dee Dee
said. "Keep looking for it."</TE>
<TE>   Megan thought of all the things she would buy. Maybe a new bicycle
and all the ice cream she could eat.</TE>
<TE>   The sky got dark. Rain drizzled through the trees. Megan shivered.
"Aren't you cold?" she asked. Dee Dee wasn't wearing a sweater. "I
was dumb to follow you here." Megan turned and left.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm staying," Dee Dee said. "I need to make a wish."</TE>
<TE>   "'Bye then." Megan found her scooter and called again, "Are you
coming?" But the little girl stood alone looking at the sky. Megan
knew Dee Dee would not wish for a bicycle or ice cream. What she most
needed was a friend. Megan went back.</TE>
<TE>   "Dee Dee, do you want to ride my scooter?"</TE>
<TE>   Dee Dee shook her head. "I don't know how."</TE>
<TE>   "I'll show you," Megan said. "Hurry, it's raining."</TE>
<TE>   Dee Dee's eyes shone just as if she had found the pot of gold.</TE>
<TE>   As they started off, a canopy of color appeared. The rainbow ended
right over the two little girls.</TE>
<TE>   Nancy Robison likes to watch for rainbows. Look for them when a
light rain is falling and the sun is shining at the same time. They
usually appear opposite the sunlight.</TE>

<DL>KABUL, Afghanistan</DL>
<LD>From a table in the dining room of the Herat restaurant on
Barkesharenow Street, you can see the future. No, two futures.</LD>
<LD>   The Herat has three rows of tables with chipped Formica tops. The
kebab grill outside sends occasional plumes of savory smoke into the
dining room. A television set blares Pakistani and Afghan music
videos, and stacks of Pine Light cigarettes decorate the
counter--modern amenities unseen six months ago. "Taste the American
Experience," the cigarette packs say. My translator is disappointed
to learn they are not in fact from America.</LD>
<LD>   Since the Taliban was swept away, the Herat has served a
conglomeration of customers reminiscent of the bar scene in "Star
Wars."</LD>
<TE>   But if one looks carefully at its unlikely collection of
customers, they turn into human tea leaves:</TE>
<TE>   There are diplomats, United Nations officials and NGO
workers--along with their Afghan counterparts--working to rebuild a
23-year-old, war-blasted infrastructure. They represent the
reasonably bright future Afghanistan could have.</TE>
<TE>   There are young Afghan men of indeterminate rank and allegiance
with Kalashnikov rifles--harbingers of the violent chaos ahead if the
first group fails.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, there are the young Americans in Gore-Tex jackets and
Nike shoes who say vaguely that they are "engineers" come to help
with reconstruction. Some are in fact Army soldiers working on roads
and such. Many, however, those with no license plates on their new
Toyota Land Cruisers, belong to the U.S. "special operations" forces.
And this part of the Herat crowd--what they do and how they do
it--may determine which future Afghanistan actually has.</TE>
<TE>   In military terms, "special operations" is the huge, untold story
from the U.S. war effort. Working in close cooperation with U.S.
airpower, U.S. Army special forces toppled a repressive regime and
put the Taliban and its Al Qaeda allies to flight.</TE>
<TE>   Without question, the Army Green Berets, the Navy SEALs, the Air
Force Special Tactics commandos and forward air controllers, the
mysterious "Delta Force" and similar units from eight different
nations took the greatest risks and achieved the greatest gains. They
are also at the center of the continuing hunt for Al Qaeda members
and the Taliban.</TE>
<TE>   The question, however, is whether these Army Special Forces units
and the high priority assigned to their missions still serve the best
interests of the United States--or Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   Three weeks of traveling across this complex and troubled country
have left me wondering whether American policymakers are focusing in
the wrong direction and neglecting what matters most: making sure
Afghanistan never again harbors global terrorists.</TE>
<TE>   One problem is that, with the Taliban overthrown, the James Bond
aura of the special operators seems to convey exactly the wrong
message. Dating back at least to special operations in
Bosnia-Herzegovina and Somalia during the 1990s, a no-rules creed has
developed among these units. Their members dispense with uniforms,
grow beards and long hair. Commanders believe these changes in
traditional military culture have helped the special operators do
their jobs in a chaotic post-Cold War world. They may be right in
military terms.</TE>
<TE>   Yet, in a land dominated by warlordism and unruliness, the special
operations culture projects an image that is the opposite of the
orderly, by-the-book society Americans need to promote. And don't
these now-transparent disguises feed the conspiracy theorists who
claim some American hidden hand is trying to take over or keep a
particular faction in power?</TE>
<TE>   Wouldn't it make more sense, in all but the most sensitive
military situations, for American soldiers to wear uniforms and
project a professional military bearing?</TE>
<TE>   Consider the U.N.-authorized International Security Assistance
Force (ISAF), the peacekeeping army dominated by Britain and other
Europeans--and decidedly not including Americans. ISAF units patrol
Kabul's streets in regular uniforms and clearly marked vehicles. They
convey confidence and security as they help enforce the 10 p.m. to 4
a.m. curfew.</TE>
<TE>   Other than ISAF, one doesn't see too many foreign soldiers wearing
uniforms anywhere in Afghanistan. The 5,000 or so Americans of the
U.S. Army's 10th Mountain and 101st Airborne Divisions, the Marines
and the logisticians and support personnel are largely garrisoned
forces. They travel by helicopter and mix with their Afghan proxy
armies, not local civilians.</TE>
<TE>   Beyond the image, continued emphasis on special operators presents
other problems. Press reports--whether or not entirely accurate--have
blamed them for a string of errors that threaten to overshadow their
accomplishments:</TE>
<TE>   The convoy attack outside Khost on Dec. 20, which ostensibly
killed tribal elders on their way to Hamid Karzai's inauguration; the
attack in Hazar Qadam Valley on Jan. 24, which killed 16 persons the
U.S. Defense Department now acknowledges were not Al Qaeda or
Taliban; and the Feb. 4 drone-guided missile strike near Zhawar Kili,
which seems to have killed three scrap-metal collectors, though the
Pentagon still says they were not innocent.</TE>
<TE>   The point here is not to indict special operators as heedless
cowboys. Measured against the carnage Afghanistan has seen over the
last two decades, these incidents are practically modest. And up to a
point, they may be the unavoidable byproducts of a continuing effort
to root out hostile fighters.</TE>
<TE>   After all, the Taliban still exists; tens of thousands of its
members have melted back into society. Also, the Taliban's fight to
power, its anti-technology fanaticism, its five-year civil war with
the Northern Alliance and other anti-Taliban factions, coming on the
top of 10 years of Soviet occupation and fighting, inflicted damage
that makes the negative effects of American actions trivial.</TE>
<TE>   But that is the past. What will determine the future is what
happens now.</TE>
<TE>   President Bush has never been comfortable with "nation building."
Gen. Tommy Franks, the U.S. commander, has made it clear the U.S.
mission is to get Al Qaeda and its affiliates, nothing else.</TE>
<TE>   In fairness, nation-building, in the sense of turning Afghanistan
into a modern, Western-style society, is probably impossible anyway.
From villages on the Shomali plain to the cities of Kabul, Kandahar
and Mazar-i-Sharif, the destruction of war is everywhere.
Old-fashioned, low-tech conflict produces cruder, broader destruction
than "smart" weapons.</TE>
<TE>   Nature has added to the devastation; so have a desperate people.
Rivers have dried up from drought. Trees have been cut down for
firewood. Systematic farming has stopped.</TE>
<TE>   What is left is a dazed and dislocated population struggling to
meet essential needs.</TE>
<TE>   It is here, in the transition between military victory and
whatever comes next, that the United States needs to think more
clearly. What it is doing now may not achieve lasting results.</TE>
<TE>   The American soldiers working on reconstruction are following a
tradition that dates back to the post-World War II occupation in
Germany and Japan, a tradition that is both laudable and laughable
when translated to present-day Afghanistan. It has none of the
technological or social foundations that enabled Europe and Japan to
rise from their own ashes. And the U.S. commitment here is uncertain
at best.</TE>
<TE>   The soldiers involved in rebuilding are doing good deeds, but
their efforts pale in comparison with those of the larger number of
NGOs operating in Afghanistan. The latter were in the country before
the Americans came and will likely remain long after President Bush
pulls the plug.</TE>
<TE>   This is not nation-building, with its implication of
near-permanent involvement in another country's internal affairs.
This is about doing a few things right--and avoiding a few
mistakes--that together could make a difference.</TE>
<TE>   There is a widespread feeling among NGO workers that the United
States is focusing too much on purely military matters. They are
right. In the long run, for instance, the status of the family and
the position of women in Afghan society seem more central to this
country's future than just about any military goal.</TE>
<TE>   I know the tough retort is that "security" must come first. Yet,
everyone agrees foreign forces on the ground are insufficient to
impose security. More U.S. ground troops do not seem likely. And
special operations forces cannot do the job. So, when it comes to
security, there seems to be a hole in U.S. policy.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the "special operators" who have taken up outposts
throughout Afghanistan--in cities, and at "strategic" sites such as
the Kajaki Dam north of Kandahar--remain on call to respond to tips
about Al Qaeda and Taliban outlaws. They are the American eyes and
ears, but they are dependent on local leaders and host governments
that are self-interested, and hold only tentative and perhaps
temporary power.</TE>
<TE>   A bad incident, an increase in local instability, and the special
operators could be extracted and whisked home as quickly as their
brethren in Somalia were after the ill-fated mission that produced
the book and film "Black Hawk Down."</TE>
<TE>   At the Herat restaurant, the young men with Kalashnikovs sit and
wait. They will go whichever way the wind blows. They understand
force and little else.</TE>
<TE>   The danger is that Washington will continue to believe in the
primacy of the hunt for terrorists and place its emphasis on the hard
men in Gore-Tex and Nikes at the cost of the non-military challenges.
If it does, then the United States could finish its "task" and still
find itself back in Afghanistan very soon--trying to root out new
disciples of fanaticism in a land that has little else to offer.</TE>

<HD>The Legacy of Proposition 187 Cuts Two Ways</HD>
<DH>Democrats can't count on the fear tactic forever.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>A.G. BLOCK</AU>
<BD>A.G. Block is executive editor of State Net, publishers
of California Journal, a monthly nonpartisan public-affairs magazine.</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>In the summer of 1994, many Californians believed that their state
was being overrun with illegal immigrants, mostly Latinos, and that
the federal government was powerless to turn them back. A lingering
recession aggravated this perception, and some people even feared
that the "California dream" was over.</LD>
<LD>   Enter Pete Wilson. By supporting Proposition 187, a ballot
initiative that denied a range of state services to illegal
immigrants, the incumbent Republican governor aimed to exploit the
anti-immigrant mood politically. He and proponents of 187 ran a
fear-based campaign that blurred the distinction between legal and
illegal immigrants, or even between Latino citizens and non-citizens.
The campaign motivated the GOP's mostly white base, making Wilson and
the initiative victorious. But it came at a great cost, for it also
drove Latinos into the arms of the Democrats.</LD>
<LD>   That was eight years ago. The current Republican candidate for
governor, Bill Simon Jr., is not connected to Proposition 187 or
Wilson. Moreover, the man in the White House speaks fluent Spanish
and is popular among Latino voters in Texas, where he was governor.
So, is the curse of Proposition 187 lifting for the GOP? Conversely,
can Democrats continue to exploit fears of perceived Republican
racism to secure the party's base among ethnic voters?</LD>
<TE>   Proposition 187's most significant legacy is in the numbers it
produced rather than the passions it inflamed. Latinos, whose
percentage of the electorate has grown from 5% to 16% since 1994, now
vote so overwhelmingly Democratic that Republicans have only a
marginal chance to capture the governorship (or any other statewide
office) in 2002 or to dent the huge majorities Democrats enjoy in
both houses of the Legislature and in the state's congressional
delegation.</TE>
<TE>   This wasn't always true. Before 1994, Republicans did relatively
well among Latino voters, who tended to be entrepreneurial, middle
class and conservative and who consistently gave statewide Republican
candidates more than one-third of their votes. Since then,
Republicans have been lucky to attract a quarter of that vote, in
part because a chunk of their previous Latino support abandoned them
in the wake of Proposition 187 and partly because of changes in the
character of the Latino electorate.</TE>
<TE>   "A whole new class of Latino voter has emerged in California since
187," says pollster Mark DiCamillo, director of the Field Institute.
"And that's a fundamental problem for the Republican Party. They are
young and poor, and they are registering 3 to 1 Democratic, a trend
that's been holding steady for the past four years" and may continue
in the future. "Proposition 187 was the force that motivated them to
become citizens and to register--as Democrats."</TE>
<TE>   This is significant because, according to DiCamillo, those who
have registered since 1994 now make up half the overall Latino vote,
Republicans have to stop the bleeding among these new voters if they
hope to compete effectively in California. Latinos now give Democrats
such a huge edge, explains DiCamillo, that GOP candidates must win
the non-Latino vote by nearly 9% to prevail statewide, a
near-impossible task.</TE>
<TE>   But some Republicans believe that the anger among Latinos aroused
by Proposition 187 is fading. The Latino community, they contend,
mirrors the political diversity of the general population, and
therein lies new hope for the GOP. They point to President Bush as
the salve that will heal wounds left by 187. Sal Russo, campaign
manager for Simon, believes with others that the GOP could
dramatically enhance its stature among Latinos if Bush appoints a
Latino to the U.S. Supreme Court when, as expected, Chief Justice
William H. Rehnquist or Justice Sandra Day O'Connor retires this
fall. That historic event could create what one observer calls "a
whole new ballgame" in California, a point Democrats concede. "[Bush]
could tout that as a legitimate piece of his record [to Latino
voters]," says state Lt. Gov. Cruz Bustamante. "At that point, they
become competitive."</TE>
<TE>   Short of that, Republicans will only slowly escape the shadow of
187, aided by success in local and legislative races, says Allen
Hoffenblum, a Republican analyst and publisher of the California
Target Book, which follows the state's legislative and congressional
districts. "Many Assembly districts were made safer [during the 2001
redistricting] for Democrats by increasing Latino registration," he
explains. "But if Republicans play it smart, and recruit good
candidates, [Democrats] may find that [the districts] are not as
safely Democratic as they had planned them to be."</TE>
<TE>   That, say Hoffenblum and others, is because Latino voters are not
a monolithic bloc, and Democrats have yet to consolidate their
allegiance. Indeed, some Democrats worry that their party is treating
the Latino vote as a given. They point to Latino unhappiness over how
the new legislative and congressional districts were drawn, a process
controlled exclusively by Democrats. The Mexican American Legal
Defense and Educational Fund (MALDEF), for instance, has sued to
overturn districts in San Diego and Los Angeles on the ground that
Latino voting strength was diluted to benefit non-Latino Democratic
incumbents and to discourage Latino challengers.</TE>
<TE>   Bustamante sees no Democratic anxiety. "The ultimate goal is more
Latino representation," he says. "Although you might make a valid
criticism of a couple of seats, overall, the plan was a vast benefit
to the Latino community because it gives us the ability to elect more
Latinos."</TE>
<TE>   Still, others worry that, like Republicans nearly a decade ago,
Democrats rely too reflexively on the fear aroused by Proposition 187
to bind Latinos to the Democratic Party. They cite recent comments by
Gov. Gray Davis. In an interview with The Times, Davis summoned the
specter of Wilson and implied that Wilson's support for Prop. 187 was
emblematic of current Republican attitudes, Simon included.</TE>
<TE>   Just how long this fear tactic will continue to play among Latinos
is anybody's guess, especially as memories of 187 fade. But as
Latinos, through the power of sheer numbers, become the political
mainstream, it's unlikely that their allegiance to the Democratic
Party will rest solely on their animosity for Republicans. Instead,
they will want Democrats to pay greater attention to issues that
concern Latinos, such as education, jobs and economic opportunity.</TE>
<TE>   Yet, Davis' remarks may signal his strategy to keep fear alive. If
so, he may squander an opportunity to create lifelong Democrats
because a softer, more positive message is rarely noticed above the
din created by hard-nosed demagogy.</TE>
<TE>   That troubles former state Assembly Speaker Antonio Villaraigosa,
who warns that Proposition 187 won't haunt Republicans forever.
Although he would not comment directly on Davis' remarks,
Villaraigosa says, "We can't rely exclusively on reminding voters of
Republican connections to 187. Early on, in '95, '96, even '98, we
did. But now, we have to focus on an agenda. We won't continue to
have the loyalty and support from Latinos if we just harp on 187."</TE>
<TE>   As both parties grapple with the legacy of Proposition 187 and
develop and refine the message they hope will attract and retain
ethnic voters, it would be prudent to heed the words of Bustamante.
"There is no radical ethnic agenda. A decent job. A safe
neighborhood. A good school. An equal opportunity. Those things are
important, not just to Latinos, but to every Californian."</TE>

<HD>Memory and Destiny</HD>
<DH>I cannot stand watching as Israel commits suicide before my
eyes.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LYNN COHEN</AU>
<BD>Lynn Cohen is a Los Angeles writer.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I was raised as a Conservative Jew. Holocaust history--with it's
mantra of "never forget"--was as familiar to me as the words to the
Pledge of Allegiance. I've cried at the displays of banjos stretched
with human skin, at the piles of scuffed shoes with empty eyelets. I
don't hear the word "chimney" without thinking of crematoriums
silhouetted against gray Polish skies.</LD>
<LD>   I speak Hebrew. It's a language that runs like sweet, coarse
batter over my tongue and down my throat. When I overhear a
conversation between Israelis at a cafe, my whole being inclines
toward the sounds. When I was little, I gave my quarters in religious
school for planting trees in the holy land. The teachers showed us
glossy photographs of green-foliaged hills surrounding a glittering
blue lake. Even the word "Galilee" felt lovely to say. I felt proud
of what my quarters had helped create. They showed us filmstrips of
kibbutz life, where, under trees I'd helped to plant, tanned handsome
people with black hair and dark eyes beamed over heaping barrels of
oranges and lemons. They taught us that, as Jews, we were all
citizens of the nation of Israel, that it was our homeland, wherever
we happened to be, that Israel was our reward for having outlived our
unwelcome presence in so many other places.</LD>
<TE>   I believed them, still believe today that the destiny of every Jew
is intimately bound up with that of Israel. Which is why I feel
obligated to speak out. I am not alone, I know, in feeling
increasingly frantic for Israel to learn, finally, that retaliation
will not work. I so want to believe that people who have been
catastrophically wronged--as the Jews have been--can take from that
experience the need to do what is right. I want Israel to honor the
covenant entrusted to it as a nation of Jews. I want this nation of
Jews to do whatever it takes to make a home for the Palestinians. I
want this because I love Israel and I cannot stand watching as it
commits suicide before my eyes.</TE>
<TE>   Every Jew in Israel or America today likely had relatives who were
rounded up and selectively tortured, maimed or killed, whether in
Poland, Germany, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Russia, Romania or Latvia.
Who better than Jews should know what such systematic humiliation
does to a people? Who better than Jews should understand the reasons
for not targeting people based on ethnicity?</TE>
<TE>   In 1979, I lived in Jerusalem, in an apartment near the Jerusalem
Theater, where the symphony orchestra I played in rehearsed. It
seemed during that period of relative calm that the complicated
blending of Arabs and Jews into a single society could work. During
breaks, I would joke and chat with the Arab custodians, Jamal and
Fahami. Jamal was shy and deferential, Fahami bawdy and jocular. He
insisted I take his cigarettes, though I had my own. After rehearsal,
musician friends and I would bus down to the Old City and walk
through the maze of shops and studios to the cafe that served the
best hummus in the country. The owner, Abu, sat on a stool wearing
his checkered kaffiyeh, mashing chickpeas into a smooth paste in a
big wooden bowl. Arabic music crackled through a cheap radio on the
counter.</TE>
<TE>   On my way home I would sometimes stop at the vegetable stand for
tomatoes and cucumbers, carrots and onions and bunches of dill. A
handsome man about my age worked there. We flirted through smiles and
sidelong glances until the day we spoke. His Hebrew had the Arabic
accent. His teeth were gray, his striped wool sweater had holes and
was frayed at the cuff. One day he took me into the back room and sat
me down on his lap. We kissed hungrily. He took me home to where he
lived in a dark, tiny apartment with five members of his family. His
father was a garbage collector, his mother a teacher. We drank tea in
stained, chipped cups.</TE>
<TE>   That spring of 1979, everyone celebrated the famous handshake
between Egyptian President Anwar Sadat and Israeli Prime Minister
Menachem Begin. It felt to me like the diplomatic version of those
thrilling, flirty smiles and sidelong glances that could lead to what
we all hoped would be a lifelong kiss between Jews and Arabs.</TE>
<TE>   These days I listen all day long to the radio, bracing myself for
news of another Gestapo-style rampage by Ariel Sharon's military, of
another self-defeating bombing by the desperate and enraged
Palestinians. I listen, horrified, to tales of Israeli soldiers
executing Palestinian policemen, shooting them at point-blank range,
to news of Israeli soldiers pounding on doors, rounding up whole
families.</TE>
<TE>   Never forget? Clearly, we've forgotten.</TE>

<BD>David D. Perlmutter is an associate professor of Mass
Communication at Louisiana State University and a senior fellow at
the Reilly Center for Media &amp; Public Affairs. He is the author of
"Visions of War."</BD>
<DL>BATON ROUGE, La.</DL>
<LD>When I was in college, an Armenian American acquaintance told me
about his grandfather's obsession with the Turkish genocide against
his people in the early part of the 20th century. To a comment of
"nice weather today," the old man habitually would reply, "What does
it matter since our people were slaughtered?"</LD>
<LD>   I wonder if I will be like him 40 years from now. For the first
time in my life, I see the shadows of Israel's destruction, if not by
Arab armies all at once, then by suicide bombers, one Jewish child
and mother at a time. I see an anti-Jewish European press
sadistically attacking Israel's defensive measures. I see a
clownishly hypocritical United Nations condemning Israel's bulldozing
of a building while millions die in the Sudan or Tibet. I see my
fellow academics musing and posturing in praise of demons who would
cut their throats merely for being non-Muslims.</LD>
<LD>   Small items, too, prick hard. I find myself getting irritated at a
Jewish social organization I belong to for raising its dues: Why
don't we send all the money to buy Israeli war bonds instead? I am
furious when I read that some Jewish media mogul just gave $7 million
to the Democratic National Committee. Where is the opposition of our
good friends in the Democratic Party to President's Bush's persistent
coddling of Yasser Arafat and the House of Saud?</LD>
<TE>   I simmer, too, about how I see Jews fighting consistently for the
good of all--from the civil rights movement to the salvation of
Bosnian Muslims--but when the hangman comes for us, we find ourselves
standing alone.</TE>
<TE>   Mostly, I cannot stand watching the news--with its tired cliches
of "cycles" of violence. Today, I see Arafat, sitting in his bunker,
talking to "international activists" and proclaiming that the
Israelis are just like Nazis. I wonder: Did Adolf Hitler allow his
enemies press conferences? I daydream--if only! If in 1948, 1956,
1967 or 1973 Israel had acted just a bit like the Third Reich, then
today Israelis would shop, eat pizza, marry and celebrate the holy
days unmolested. And of course Jews, not sheiks, would have that Gulf
oil. In contrast, if the Arabs had conquered Israel, does anyone
think a single Jew would today be alive between the Jordan River and
the Mediterranean?</TE>
<TE>   This is what I'm reduced to: thinking like a Nazi when an Arab
accuses Jews of acting like Nazis.</TE>
<TE>   I'm unhappy as well--especially since I teach political
communication--at Israel's unsophisticated, unplanned media policy.
Since the Lebanon war, the seven squabbling Israeli ministries that
claim to control press relations have been notorious for either
ignoring or failing to understand the needs of modern journalism. One
journalist noted to me: "The Palestinians will go to the news bureaus
each day and pitch stories, and go out of their way to help arrange
interviews and suggest places to shoot. From the Israeli government,
all you get is statements, silence or red tape."</TE>
<TE>   A more ominous reason that the evening news is so laden with
images favorable to the Palestinians is that they are chosen and shot
by Palestinians. Israeli reporters are banned from working in
Palestinian areas; foreign journalists are subtly or violently
pressured to either keep out or report with a pro-Palestinian bias.
The result is that most television networks and news bureaus use
Palestinian stringers for spot news coverage and also for
translations. So, Arafat and his allies are allowed to make
statements like, "We are the only occupied people in the world"
without an accompanying laugh track.</TE>
<TE>   But what to do? I have other dreams as well--apocalyptic ones. I
think:</TE>
<TE>   Israel has been building nuclear weapons for 30 years. The Jews
understand what passive and powerless acceptance of doom has meant
for them in the past, and they have ensured against it. Masada was
not an example to follow--it hurt the Romans not a whit, but Sampson
in Gaza? With an H-bomb? What would serve the Jew-hating world better
in repayment for thousands of years of massacres but a Nuclear
Winter. Or invite all those tut-tutting European statesmen and peace
activists to join us in the ovens?</TE>
<TE>   For the first time in history, a people facing extermination while
the world either cackles or looks away--unlike the Armenians,
Tibetans, World War II European Jews or Rwandans--have the power to
destroy the world. The ultimate justice?</TE>
<TE>   These are my dark thoughts and quiet desperations. Who will
dissolve them? Who will silence the madness? Will I even be allowed
to become an old, bitter man? Will any of us have the chance to look
back on these days beyond the mushroom clouds of tomorrow?</TE>

<HD>It's Latino Immigrants Who Can Save the Catholic Church</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GREGORY RODRIGUEZ</AU>
<BD>Gregory Rodriguez, a contributing editor to Opinion, is
a senior fellow at the New America Foundation.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>One widely favored remedy for the sexual-abuse scandals rocking the
American Catholic Church is for the church to adapt to the cultural
mainstream. Priests should be allowed to marry. Catholic women should
be ordained. Ironically, Catholic culture may already be too
mainstream. Traditionally rooted in--and reinforced--by a powerful
subculture, American Catholicism is paying the price of the
assimilation of the immigrants that were once its lifeblood. The
faithful are no longer eager to give their sons and daughters to the
church.</LD>
<LD>   The election of John F. Kennedy to the presidency in 1960 marked
the symbolic end of a separate Catholic culture in America. The
values and morality of the Irish, the immigrant group that long
dominated the priesthood and the church hierarchy, and other
Catholics are virtually indistinguishable from non-Catholic Americans
today. The institutional church has remained at odds with
contemporary secular American culture, but its congregants are
immersed in it. By the 1970s, Catholicism as a way of life had
retreated to behind church doors.</LD>
<TE>   But another group of immigrants is bringing Catholicism back into
our public lives and, in doing so, may help heal the broken American
church. Newcomers from the south carry a less doctrinaire and more
feminine faith, one embedded in a broader folk tradition and a
stronger belief in the supernatural. The fusion of this kind of faith
with the modernizing American church could reinvent Catholicism in
the United States.</TE>
<TE>   Although Mexicans have been a part of American Catholicism since
the Southwest became U.S. territory in the mid-19th century, only
today do their numbers ensure their effect on the broader faith. An
estimated 80% of the increase in the number of U.S. Catholics
occurred in the same six states where the Latino population has grown
the most. Today, roughly one-third of American Catholics are
Hispanic, most of them Mexican. In Los Angeles, now the largest
archdiocese in the nation, two in every three Catholics is Latino.</TE>
<TE>   On Good Friday, in many heavily Latino parishes around the
country, the traditional solemn Mass gave way to a religious
procession and dramatic reenactment of Christ's final steps. Whether
stopping traffic in Elgin, Ill., or shutting down intersections in
San Antonio, Texas, the Way, or Road, of the Cross is a popular Latin
American custom that is becoming an integral part of American
religious life. The Irish bequeathed rigor and formalism to the
American church. Mexicans and other Latin Americans bring new forms
of public celebration that blur the line between the sacred and the
secular.</TE>
<TE>   For Mexicans, the church is not always the locus of their
religious life. Much of Mexican religious practice is celebrated
outside the church in the form of shrines, pilgrimages and front-yard
altars. It's not uncommon for grocery stores in the Southwest to
stock devotional candles. Mexicans have kept alive the tradition of
sidewalk shrines on the spot where people have died. Images of the
Virgin of Guadalupe, the patron of Mexico, are painted on walls in
Mexican neighborhoods throughout the country.</TE>
<TE>   Old-World devotional practices to the Virgin or the saints are
nothing new to American Catholicism. Earlier waves of Catholic
immigrants, including previous generations of Mexicans, brought with
them their own national and local devotional icons. A century ago,
Italian immigrants celebrated the feasts of Our Lady of Mount Carmel
and Our Lady of Pompeii. Each ethnic group venerated its own favorite
holy men. The Irish honored St. Patrick, German Catholics St.
Boniface and the Poles St. Stanislaus.</TE>
<TE>   But the assimilation and mobility of white ethnic Catholics,
combined with a movement to refocus attention on the rites and
rituals of the formal church, led to a decline in devotional
Catholicism after the 1950s. The stature of the Virgin Mary began to
disappear in American churches.</TE>
<TE>   As they become a larger part of American Catholicism, Mexicans
will likely reverse that decline. Of all the cultural and political
icons that the Latinization of the United States has or is likely to
contribute to American culture, none will be as powerful or as
persistent as that of the Virgin of Guadalupe. Her feast day, Dec.
12, is already one of the Catholic calendar's three most popular
churchgoing days in Los Angeles and in other heavily Mexican dioceses
in the country. Every year on that day, mariachis serenade her at
dawn. And as immigrants have carried her image with them to
previously unvisited parts of the country, the Virgin's popularity
has expanded well beyond her ethnic base.</TE>
<TE>   A growing number of non-Mexican churches and causes have adopted
the "Brown Virgin" as their own. St. Peter's Catholic Church in
Olney, Md., a suburban parish founded in 1798, has a large mural of
Guadalupe. St. Michael's in Grand Forks, N.D., whose parishioners are
largely of Scandinavian and German descent, recently placed a statue
of her in its schoolyard. A Canadian Bishop, Frederick Henry of
Calgary, has proposed that Dec. 12 be made a holy day of obligation,
a day Catholics are required to attend Mass. The Catholic pro-life
movement has embraced Guadalupe as its patron. Last year, Jackson &amp;
Perkins, the world's largest grower of roses, named a sweet smelling,
silvery pink floribunda rose after her.</TE>
<TE>   By reinvigorating devotion to Mary, Mexicans may be contributing
to the feminization of an institution whose male-dominated culture is
under attack. "Guadalupe is bringing to American Catholicism a very
healthy sense of the maternal side of God," says Father Virgilio P.
Elizondo, a prominent Mexican American theologian. Devotion to Mary
encourages nurture over strict observance.</TE>
<TE>   Aizita Magana, who has studied Latina maternal and child health,
contends that admiration for the Virgin contributes to unusually
healthy birth outcomes among poor Mexican American women who have
limited access to medical care. "Latinas, in particular, often see
the Virgin as providing support and encouragement," says Magana. "She
is the ultimate maternal role model."</TE>
<TE>   Because Mexican religiosity stresses cultural practice over
orthodoxy, some theologians believe their rising presence may tone
down the polemics within the American Catholic Church. "The values of
Hispanic culture tend to be communicated not by precise doctrine but
through symbols," says Father Allan Figueroa Deck, executive director
of the Loyola Institute for Spirituality in Orange, Calif.</TE>
<TE>   Acculturation is always a two-way street, however. Even as
Mexicans wield greater influence in the American Catholic Church,
America is changing them, too. South of the border, only a small
percentage of Catholics attend Mass every Sunday, in part because
Mexico has long suffered from a shortage of priests. Immigrants
attend church more regularly as they acculturate into U.S. life. And
just as latter-generation Mexican Americans are more likely to slip
into mainline Protestant faiths than are immigrants, many more will
be seduced by the power of secular logic.</TE>
<TE>   Still, whether we share these same beliefs or not, the rise of
popular and folk religious expressions in our modern public lives is
likely to make us all ponder the power of traditional faith. The
brand of Catholicism that rural Mexicans bring with them to the
United States calls for different leaps of faith and allows for
greater possibilities for miracles and the unexplainable. The
American Catholic Church, which has become more rationalist and less
devotional, could benefit by reabsorbing just a little bit more of
this old-time religion.</TE>

<HD>In Israel's History Are Seeds of Hope</HD>
<DH>ISRAEL</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TOM SEGEV</AU>
<BD>Tom Segev, a columnist for the Israeli daily Haaretz,
is the author of "One Palestine, Complete: Jews and Arabs Under the
British Mandate" and, most recently, "Elvis in
Jerusalem--Post-Zionism and the Americanization of Israel."</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM</DL>
<LD>When the first Palestinian suicide bombers appeared, they seemed to
be mad loners. Today, they form a movement. Israelis can no longer
avoid asking themselves what made so many young Palestinians so
hateful and so desperate as to blow themselves up in the midst of
Israeli shopping malls, restaurants and streets. Surely, their
oppression and humiliation must have something to do with their
decision to become martyrs. But not all Palestinians seek to destroy
Israel. Most of them long for independence, alongside Israel.
Unfortunately, they cannot get that, not now, for the current
conflict seems intractable.</LD>
<LD>   Still, all hope must not be lost, for, historically, both sides
have been moving closer to each other, albeit so slowly that the
movement has hardly been recognizable.</LD>
<LD>   There was a time when no Arab country would accept Israel's very
existence. Two of these countries, Egypt and Jordan, have since
signed peace agreements with Israel. And late last month, the Arab
League endorsed Saudi Crown Prince Abdullah's peace plan calling for
"normal relations" with Israel.</LD>
<TE>   The Palestinians at one time maintained that all Jews who settled
in Palestine after 1917 should return to their countries of origin.
Dropping that position, the Palestinians then demanded that, instead
of a Jewish Israel, a "secular and democratic" state should be
established, meaning a state with no Jewish majority. Next, the
Palestinians adopted the two-state solution and signed the 1993 Oslo
peace accords with Israel.</TE>
<TE>   Israel, too, has come a long way. Prime Minister Golda Meir
maintained that there is no such thing as a Palestinian people. At
one time, it was illegal for Israelis to meet members of the
Palestine Liberation Organization, even unofficially, and some
Israeli peace activists served prison terms for doing so. Prime
Minister Yitzhak Rabin was elected on the basis of a solemn promise
never ever to negotiate with the PLO. He did.</TE>
<TE>   Israel always maintained that it would never ever give back any
part of the territories it occupied in 1967, unless as part of a
final peace agreement. But it evacuated Palestinian towns without a
final peace agreement. In 1997, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu
handed over 80% of Hebron to Palestinian rule. Israel said that it
would never ever agree to the establishment of a Palestinian state;
it has. Even Prime Minister Ariel Sharon no longer rules out the
possibility of Palestinian independence at some time in the future.
Israel proclaimed that it would never ever agree to power sharing in
Jerusalem. Prime Minister Ehud Barak broke that sacred taboo.</TE>
<TE>   It is unfortunate that progress is so slow, but perhaps it cannot
be faster. At this time, the Palestinian refugee problem cannot be
solved, nor can the problem of Israeli settlements. Jerusalem has
been a problem without solution for the past 3,000 years, and it may
well remain one for the next 3,000 years.</TE>
<TE>   But today, many Israelis feel they have returned to square one.
Sharon has repeatedly described the present wave of terror as one
more battle in Israel's 1948 War of Independence. In reality, it is
another round in the Palestinian War of Independence, not Israel's.</TE>
<TE>   With almost daily terrorist attacks, life in Israel is closer
today than ever before to the wave of Arab terrorism that swept the
country during the 1930s. Palestine was then ruled by the British,
and the Arabs wanted to get rid of them and hit as many Jews as
possible as well. They did not use religiously indoctrinated suicide
bombers in those days, but Arab terrorists were as determined to
achieve their goal then as they are now. They were able to convince
most of the British that they had better go home, and were left with
the Jews.</TE>
<TE>   If the present situation takes us back to the days of the first
intifada in the 1930s, the next step could well be another mass
evacuation of Palestinian Arabs. In fact, more and more Israelis,
including Cabinet ministers, are openly talking about the need to
"transfer" Arabs out of Palestinian territories. The idea, which was
part of the Zionist ideology, had largely been suppressed--until
recently when it reappeared in the public discourse, mostly as a
result of the suicide bombings. This is the main danger of terrorism:
It doesn't threaten the existence of Israel but it does affect the
ability of many Israelis to think rationally and to take the risks of
peace.</TE>
<TE>   With its 54th anniversary approaching, Israel is strong enough to
defend itself against its enemies, but, once again, it seems in need
of help to defend itself against its own follies. This is the role
the Unites States must take upon itself, as it has so often in the
past.</TE>
<TE>   History shows that virtually all the national-liberation movements
of the 20th century prevailed, and virtually no regular army has ever
defeated popular national terrorism. The best deal Israel can expect
is the two-state solution. This basic truth was recognized long ago,
which makes the latest wave of violence so tragic not only because of
the loss of life, but also because it's a waste of time.</TE>

<HD>The Church Must Exorcise the Demon of Celibacy</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TERRANCE SWEENEY</AU>
<BD>Terrance Sweeney, a former Jesuit priest, is the author
of "A Church Divided," and "What God Hath Joined."</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As the number of accusations of sexual abuse of minors by priests has
grown, officials of the Roman Catholic Church have been forced, under
the glare of public scrutiny, to confront the problems plaguing the
priesthood. Unfortunately, they're unlikely to get to one of the
principal roots of the problem: the church's mandatory requirement of
celibacy.</LD>
<LD>   For priests who love their ministry but do not feel called to live
a celibate life, the celibacy discipline is a continual torment,
requiring them to sacrifice their desires for intimacy, marriage and
fatherhood. Repression of these powerful human instincts over a
lifetime can easily lead to profound loneliness and can foster a
disposition toward sexual deviancy.</LD>
<LD>   Nearly every study conducted over the past 35 years has shown that
the primary motive for the departure of more than 100,000 Catholic
priests is that they wanted to marry. The No.1 reason why young men
do not enter the seminary is that they are not allowed to marry. One
consequence of this celibacy requirement is ominous for the future of
the priesthood: Seminary enrollment in the U.S. has plummeted from
48,000 in 1965 to less than 4,000 today.</LD>
<TE>   The celibacy discipline is even more tenuous when considered
historically. St. Peter, the first pope, was married, as were at
least 39 others documented during the church's first 12 centuries.
Many of the clergy had wives. The Eastern Rite of the Catholic Church
has experienced an unbroken tradition of married and celibate clergy
for almost 2,000 years. Why was celibacy imposed on priests in the
Roman Rite?</TE>
<TE>   Responding to the moral excesses of the collapsing Roman Empire,
some popes believed that all sexual intimacy, even conjugal love, was
impure. Furthermore, the papacy wanted to control the appointments of
bishops and the disbursement of church benefices. Starting in the 4th
century, it attempted to address these concerns by ordering all
married bishops and priests to abstain from sex with their wives. No
conjugal intercourse, no children. Married bishops would have no sons
to entrust with their ministry and property. The papacy would then
gain control of the appointments of bishops and benefices.</TE>
<TE>   Married clergy resisted, but increasingly restrictive laws, fines,
imprisonment, public beatings and dismissals carried the day. At the
second Lateran Council in 1139, the papacy enacted laws that
nullified the marriages of priests, prohibited unmarried priests to
marry and required aspirants to the priesthood to promise never to
marry.</TE>
<TE>   The imposition of this discipline defied human nature, degraded
marriage and contradicted Jesus' teaching that marriage is an
inviolable blessing. It created a profound moral and institutional
disorder.</TE>
<TE>   The fallout continues to this day. Priests who want to marry must
leave the priesthood. Mature men are barred from entering it for the
sole reason that they are married. The all-male seminary environment
makes it extremely difficult for teenage candidates for the
priesthood to achieve sexual maturity. These factors drastically
reduce both the number and quality of priests.</TE>
<TE>   While there have been many celibates whose lives have been
inspirations, the history of celibacy is littered with priests,
bishops, cardinals and popes who have responded to the canonically
mandated suppression of their natural instincts with sexual excess
and perversion. Today's scandals are part of an unbroken chain of
abuses dating back to when celibacy laws were first imposed. The
papacy should have listened to St. Paul's warning: "Those who say
marriage is forbidden are uttering the doctrine of demons."</TE>
<TE>   Celibacy does not cause pedophilia, any more than marriage causes
pedophilia. Pedophilia is not caused by sexual abstinence, nor is it
caused by conjugal love. Pedophiles are psychologically locked into
associating sexual power and ecstasy with pre-puberty minors.</TE>
<TE>   Effective management of the church's sexual-abuse scandal will
require apologies, restitution to the victims and punishment for the
perpetrators and for those who protected or facilitated the abuse.
But more is needed.</TE>
<TE>   A worldwide council should be convened and, to be credible, must
include, with a voting voice, laity as well as clergy. Its goal
should be the restoration of the church's credibility and the sexual
integrity of the priesthood. Sexual-abuse victims and their families
should have a pre-eminent voice in defining the healing they need and
the guidelines that will prevent a recurrence of their tragedies.
Finally, priests should be allowed to choose whether celibacy or
marriage is the best way for them to serve the church.</TE>
<TE>   This reform will not eliminate all pedophile priests, nor all
clergy sexual abuse. But a married priesthood will make it harder for
abuses to take root. More important, it will show, once again, that
conjugal love and priestly ministry profoundly enrich the church,
rather than undermine it.</TE>

<LD>I remember my first parent-teacher conference as a parent. Lacy was
doing well with her first-grade reading, I was told. She knew her

quarters.</LD>

<TE>   First, let me say this: Profanities? I'm for 'em. I was a Marine,
after all. I learned to swear with the best. The ability to deliver a
well-timed vulgarity is a skill I admire, and I take a stab at it
myself from time to time. I also admire those who have the good taste
and restraint to know when not to.</TE>
<TE>   Because newspapers are conservative in these matters, we cannot
discuss the words employed by the now-notorious Rifle River canoeist.
He was charged with uttering vulgarities in front of women and
children. He tangled with the river, took a tumble and began
swearing. His friends laughed. He swore more and louder. "It was just
clean fun," he explained.</TE>
<TE>   If I were honest about the antics of my youth, I'd confess that
I've done just as bad, although I understood full well it was dirty,
not clean.</TE>
<TE>   Anyway, we know the rest of the story. Rather than lowering his
voice and apologizing, as most of us would have done, Timothy Boomer
set out to transform a wrong into a "right."</TE>
<TE>   Mr. Boomer went to court for the principle. The jury found against
him and he was fined $75. But lawyers knew better. A state appeals
court said the decision was unjust. The quaint old anti-swearing law
was thrown out. Comedians had a laugh about the bluenoses in Michigan
who presumed to protect their womenfolk and kids from hard language.
So now, in Michigan and surely elsewhere, you can go down to the park
and scream profanities around the ladies and their children. It is
your right under the Constitution.</TE>
<TE>   Naturally, it's hard for me to quibble with the 1st Amendment.
Without it, my ilk would be further up the creek than Boomer was that
day. I've been the bore at more than one cocktail party with my
lecture on the subject because I've lived in countries where speaking
your mind can make you disappear. But I'm also a big fan of the 9th
Amendment. That's the one that says: "The enumeration in the
Constitution, of certain rights, shall not be construed to deny or
disparage others retained by the people."</TE>
<TE>   Like the right to take your kids out in public and not have to
explain why you cannot explain what the man in the river is yelling.</TE>
<TE>   Lost in this discussion of Boomer's "right" was the right of a
nearby couple with children. The officer on the scene said the mother
was trying to cover the ears of her 2-year-old.</TE>
<TE>   Purists contend that we have to put up with the likes of Boomer
because of the slippery slope that's just one step away. If we limit
his free speech, ours will be stripped from us when we need it. We'll
wake up some day under the thumb of tyrants. We won't even be able to
call three judges on the Michigan appeals courts nincompoops.</TE>
<TE>   But the court has affirmed our free-speech right unanimously. So
I'll exercise mine and say the judges were nincompoops. And so are
the slippery-slope ninnies who cannot count to Amendment No. 9.</TE>
<TE>   Just ask yourself this: If Boomer and his buddies went down to the
courthouse and started laughing and yelling obscenities for the
"clean fun" of it, do you think the judges would forfeit the court's
right to maintain calm for the sake of their right to swear loudly
wherever they please?</TE>
<TE>   Bailiffs, please cover the children's ears while Mr. Boomer
defends the Constitution.</TE>
<TE>   Of course not. And on a nice day down at the river, parents
deserve no less protection than the court would grant itself.</TE>
<TE>   We shouldn't be too harsh on Boomer for having a bad canoe ride
and losing his temper. But we can fault him for insisting on the
right for everybody to do it. That's a slippery slope where freedom
is but chump change.</TE>

<HD>Pennies a Day Can Stop Spread of AIDS</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JIMMY CARTER and BILL GATES Sr.</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a slum outside Abuja, Nigeria, the capital of Africa's most
populous country, we had an appointment with a group of prostitutes.</LD>
<LD>   Seated in front of a colorful poster that announced, "No condom,
no sex," Angela told us her story. Angela's path to becoming a
commercial sex worker is typical. She was orphaned at a young age and
forced into sex work to support herself and her younger brothers and
sisters.</LD>
<LD>   Each of the 5,000 prostitutes who work in that locale must service
about 10 clients a day to scrape out a meager living.</LD>
<TE>   Their risk of contracting HIV is extremely high, but their
importance in stopping the spread of HIV is even higher.</TE>
<TE>   Angela is part of an organization that trains prostitutes to
negotiate condom use with clients, one of the most cost-effective
HIV/AIDS strategies in the world, saving thousands more lives for the
money than other approaches.</TE>
<TE>   We traveled recently to South Africa, Nigeria and Kenya to promote
low-cost, high-impact interventions and to urge leaders in Africa and
around the world to dramatically increase the resources they dedicate
to defeating HIV/AIDS.</TE>
<TE>   HIV/AIDS is one of the most urgent public health issues humanity
has ever faced. Twenty-two million people already have died. Forty
million are living with HIV/AIDS. One hundred million are likely to
be infected by 2005 unless we see what South African Archbishop
Desmond Tutu has called "a very significant and decisive
intervention."</TE>
<TE>   As shocking as the numbers are, they don't come close to conveying
the human cost. Eighty percent of those dying from AIDS are between
the ages of 20 and 50. These are the people who enforce the laws,
harvest the food, heal the sick, teach the students and raise the
children.</TE>
<TE>   Without farmers and teachers and mothers and fathers, things fall
apart.</TE>
<TE>   Yet the truly startling news is not how bad it is but how much
better we can make it.</TE>
<TE>   Uganda has shown how to bring HIV prevalence from 30% to below
10%. Senegal has shown how to keep its prevalence consistently below
2%.</TE>
<TE>   Both nations did it by using proven tools, many of which are very
inexpensive.</TE>
<TE>   Heads of state must stress that HIV/AIDS is a direct threat to the
country and to each individual. Every nation needs a massive public
education effort combined with aggressive programs of condom
distribution, especially to groups at the highest risk of contracting
and spreading the disease. In sub-Saharan Africa, the total condom
supply now equals three per man per year.</TE>
<TE>   In Kenya, we visited the AIDS Vaccine Initiative, where an AIDS
vaccine is undergoing human testing. While we believe an AIDS vaccine
is the best hope to end the pandemic, the world also needs to support
proven and affordable interventions now.</TE>
<TE>   Sexually transmitted infections, which increase susceptibility to
HIV infection, must be treated. Nevirapine, which cuts by half the
risk of mother-to-child transmission for $4 a treatment, must be
provided. Voluntary counseling and testing must be available. In
Nigeria, out of 3.1 million people infected, 3 million don't know
their status. National support groups for people with HIV/AIDS must
be expanded to reduce the stigma of HIV/AIDS.</TE>
<TE>   Foundations and nonprofits can support research, sponsor programs
and identify what works. But knowing what works is not enough. It
will be impossible to reverse the HIV/AIDS epidemic without a
dramatic increase in health funding.</TE>
<TE>   Developing countries need to make their own health spending a
greater priority and establish clear accounting procedures to give
people confidence that the money is going where it ought to go.
Wealthy countries, urged on by citizens who care about this issue,
must also dramatically increase funding, and the United States should
lead.</TE>
<TE>   Polls show that many Americans fear that corrupt or inefficient
governments often waste foreign assistance. But because of the
intense personal interest that we witnessed in Africa by suffering or
concerned people, waste or corruption is minimal in the crucial area
of health spending.</TE>
<TE>   The more we realize that pennies a day can save millions of lives,
the more we should insist that the world's wealthiest nation continue
to increase its health aid and take a lead role in ending this
disease.</TE>

<HD>Why I Deserve Another Term as LAPD Chief</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BERNARD C. PARKS</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>By enacting City Charter reforms in 2000 that define the term of
office for the chief of police, the citizens of Los Angeles stated
their interest in the process for appointment and reappointment.
These citizens deserve to know all that is being considered by the
Board of Police Commissioners.</LD>
<LD>   When I became chief in August 1997, the Los Angeles Police
Department had come through a decade of turmoil, including the Rodney
King incident; a riot; the Christopher Commission on police reform;
the O.J. Simpson case, which included the Mark Fuhrman incident and a
U.S. Department of Justice civil rights investigation; the highest
crime levels in city history; a peak in violence related to crack
cocaine; unprecedented growth in the LAPD; and significant growth in
L.A.'s population.</LD>
<LD>   Unfortunately, the LAPD's leadership environment did not
successfully manage these issues. When I became chief, I implemented
changes to fill the leadership void and correct the failings of
previous years. Most notable were my decisions to change the
organizational structure that had been in place since the 1970s. The
new structure allows all top officers direct access to the chief,
enhancing communication and accountability.</LD>
<TE>   I also focused on the LAPD's primary responsibility to reduce
crime and the fear of crime. New standards of accountability for
managing crime and community partnerships were introduced to area and
division commanding officers. During my administration, the city
experienced its lowest crime rate in 30 years; 75% of L.A. residents
report feeling safe in their communities, according a March poll by
The Times.</TE>
<TE>   Each recommendation of the Christopher Commission became a
priority of mine. Significant changes continue to be made to the
disciplinary system, which for years stood as an obstacle to the
development of real trust between the department and the community.
For the first time in our history, citizens know that each of their
complaints is taken seriously and investigated. The effect has been a
resurgence in public confidence in the department and more courteous
and professional performance by our officers. Today, two-thirds of
L.A. residents report they are satisfied with the performance of the
LAPD, according to The Times' March poll.</TE>
<TE>   I also implemented models for what I termed the ideal area/ideal
basic car, which expanded the responsibilities for community
partnership to all officers at area stations rather than just those
assigned to community relations or as senior lead officers.</TE>
<TE>   When an LAPD investigation in 1999 exposed corruption in the
Rampart Division, I convened the Rampart Board of Inquiry, which
identified and recommended solutions for problems in systems,
personnel and procedures. Most of these were being successfully
addressed long before the city and the U.S. Department of Justice
agreed to the consent decree, which was based substantially on the
Board of Inquiry report.</TE>
<TE>   We have embraced this consent decree and, according to independent
monitors, are substantially in compliance with its recommendations
for reform. The LAPD has implemented a risk management system that
identifies problem officers through performance and complaint
tracking. All "risk management incidents" are thoroughly
investigated, and some, such as the use of force, have declined.</TE>
<TE>   Too much of the discussion about my reappointment has been the
rhetoric of special interests like the police union. We can't allow
such agendas or union politics to drive the selection process for
chief. The decision must be based on facts and merit. When that is
done, my record and accomplishments offer compelling support for my
reappointment. The institutionalization of reform requires continuity
of leadership. The lengthy process of selecting another chief would
create a void that would find the department backsliding on critical
activities.</TE>
<TE>   I look forward to a future of improved working relationships
inside and outside of the department; more public confidence in the
LAPD; better community and government partnerships; and an LAPD with
a reputation as an organization in which employees strive to perform
to their highest potential in service to the community.</TE>

<HD>The Masada Factor: Israelis Feel They Stand Alone</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE A. YETIV</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Radical terrorism has contributed to an important change in the
Israeli mind-set, which needs to be recognized around the world if
progress is to be made toward peace.</LD>
<LD>   Israelis haven't felt as besieged as they do today since the days
preceding the 1967 Six-Day War, when they feared being overrun by
Arab armies. Israel's tanks and airplanes bespeak a colossus grinding
down on Palestinians and their leader, Yasser Arafat. Yet Israel's
reactions are not motivated by a drive to dominate, as many Arabs see
it, but by fear and by a notion that Jews ultimately stand alone
against a hostile world.</LD>
<LD>   The Masada factor is embedded in Israeli culture. All Israeli
children learn about the resistance of a band of Jews in their final
stand against Roman legions at Masada, a giant mesa overlooking the
Dead Sea. The holdouts at Masada chose death over foreign
subjugation, and while today's strong Israel is not faced with
exactly the same dilemma, a similar siege mentality has taken over
the country. In that sense, Israel has become Masada.</LD>
<TE>   Masada-like thinking explains why some Israelis welcome Saudi
Crown Prince Abdullah's peace proposal, but many question its call
for Israel to withdraw to pre-Six-Day War borders and to allow
refugees to return. Those borders are widely viewed as indefensible,
and refugee return is seen as demographic suicide.</TE>
<TE>   The Masada factor also gives insight into Prime Minister Ariel
Sharon. He has suggested that Western powers were willing to
sacrifice Israel as they did Czechoslovakia in 1938 at Munich. The
Arabs call Sharon the "bulldozer," and not without reason, but Sharon
sees Israel as a tiny state that may have to "go it alone," as he has
asserted repeatedly. No wonder Sharon and most Israelis are cautious
about allowing international powers a greater role in the
Palestinian-Israeli conflict. To many Israelis, the United Nations is
a forum for anti-Zionism, an institution whose leader, Kofi Annan, is
pro-Arab. Europe, they believe, isn't far behind; a resurgence of
anti-Semitic acts only heightens this view.</TE>
<TE>   Despite Israel's overwhelming military advantage, a sense exists
that no Israeli leader can ensure security against a fanatical enemy.
The concern about a nuclear or biological weapon earmarked for Israel
is also palpable, even more so after Sept. 11, which taught Israelis
the dangers of one devastating attack. That Iran is increasingly bold
in sending arms shipments to the Palestinians adds to the Masada
factor, as do Hezbollah's rocket attacks from Lebanon and Syria's
military exercises. Making things worse is the recent failure of the
57-state Organization of the Islamic Conference to label suicide
bombings as terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   The gap between how Israelis see themselves and how many Arabs see
them is gigantic. While Arabs largely see Israel as an avaricious
behemoth, Israelis are seeking a touchy-feely peace based on
normalization. Real normalization can cut through the Masada
perspective, which is why it is so important. But every terrorist
attack makes Israelis want to build walls.</TE>
<TE>   To change Israel's position, more moderate Arabs, Europeans and
even Americans need to treat Israel with the Masada factor in mind. A
besieged state will never relinquish land for a piece of paper.</TE>
<TE>   A crucial step is for moderate Arabs to commit publicly to
Israel's right to neutralize groups like Hamas and Islamic Jihad.
They also need to cooperate with Israel and the U.S. in seeking this
end. Confronting terrorism in this manner is doable, especially if
the U.S. intelligently spearheads the effort. The recent Arab summit
was positive, but suicide bombings undermined it. Stopping
terrorism--at least generating a multilateral approach for doing
so--is a prerequisite for a more serious peace process. Otherwise, no
number of summits, cease-fires or diplomatic visits matter.</TE>

<HD>Sheriff Baca's Bold Vision</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Unsettling thumps resonate through the carpet in the well-appointed
Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department office. The deputies seated
at a conference table say they're used to this sound, the routine
lashing out of mentally ill inmates housed one floor below in the
Twin Towers jail--the largest de facto mental institution in the
United States.</LD>
<LD>   This week Sheriff Lee Baca will meet with civic leaders to try to
win support for a bold, if admittedly limited, solution to one of Los
Angeles' most neglected problems: people living defeated lives
beneath flimsy tarps, along urine-scented alleyways and under freeway
overpasses.</LD>
<LD>   Baca has involved himself in this issue for two reasons. First,
because about 40 of the 400 prisoners released by the jail each day
have no place to go once they spiral down the Twin Towers concrete
stairwell and out into the city. Second, because someone needed to
fill the leadership void created by politicians who run from a
problem they see as a career killer.</LD>
<TE>   The sheriff's Homeless Public Safety Center, proposed for an
abandoned four-acre industrial site between Olvera Street and
Chinatown, would temporarily shelter the city's most destitute:
people who suffer from mental illness, substance abuse or both and
who cycle, expensively, pointlessly and tragically, from hospitals to
jails to the sidewalks. It would replace a landscape of corrugated
tin and razor wire with 25 canvas-topped structures set in a grassy,
tree-shaded park. Each structure would have eight private pods with
beds, lockers and heaters, revolving around a central kitchen,
laundry and bathroom.</TE>
<TE>   In public, most civic leaders vaguely support Baca's concept.
Privately, however, they grouse: "Why in my district--why not the
Mojave Desert?"</TE>
<TE>   Chinatown leaders worry about center residents wandering over to
panhandle. They blame crime in their community on inmates released
from the jail. But the center would actually reduce crime by giving
the people who spill out of the jail not just food and toilets but
supervision, counseling and job training.</TE>
<TE>   These are proven ways to ease people with mental illness toward
permanent housing and productive lives. They save taxpayers money in
the long term by reducing repeat hospitalizations and incarcerations
for what are usually nuisance crimes such as shoplifting or
trespassing. Like most other parts of the city, Chinatown has had
mentally ill indigents living on its streets since the wholesale
release of patients from state hospitals that began in the 1960s. The
center proposed by the sheriff would give some of them a place to
take a shower and sleep.</TE>
<TE>   Resistance also comes from the hodgepodge of agencies, shelters
and missions that would compete for the $2.6 million that Baca
projects as the annual cost to run the center. Many of these groups
do a brilliant job in this overwhelming crisis, in some cases working
right inside the jails. But they have not succeeded in bringing vast
numbers of people with severe mental illness and addictions off the
streets.</TE>
<TE>   It's time to help them. While Baca's shelter would be run by the
respected and experienced Volunteers of America, its direct link with
law enforcement offers the tremendous advantage of subtle coercion. A
deputy who picks someone up for trespassing, for instance, can offer
two options: Give the shelter a try or go to jail.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles law enforcement has a deservedly bad reputation for
bullying mentally ill indigents, sometimes with fatal results. But
Baca has demonstrated a rare determination to change that, to make
sure every officer respects the dignity of this vulnerable group. And
contrary to some civil libertarians' warnings, life at the Homeless
Public Safety Center would bear little resemblance to incarceration.</TE>
<TE>   Rather than simply ticking off what they don't like about Baca's
center, civic leaders should accept the sheriff's invitation to join
a community advisory board that could help guide its development in a
way that's sensitive to their concerns. There will, of course, be
obstacles, including environmental assessments and zoning hurdles.
But they can be overcome if elected officials--Mayor Hahn? Supervisor
Molina? Councilman Reyes?--pitch in to problem-solve.</TE>
<TE>   Far from sullying the city, the center would replace an abandoned
factory with a compassionate, pragmatic attempt to confront a
shameful problem the city has ignored for too long.</TE>

<HD>Sharon and Arafat Should Both Resign</HD>

<LD>I believe Chairman Yasser Arafat and Prime Minister Ariel Sharon
should resign their offices. Arafat should voluntarily go to another
country where he is welcome. Before leaving, he should address the
Palestinian people and terrorists and tell them to stop their suicide
bombings immediately and seek statehood with sincere, conciliatory
negotiations.</LD>
<LD>   Sharon should address his people and advise them to seek a
genuine, peaceful solution to the reprehensible war that is killing
innocents on both sides. The blaming and killings must stop. It is
possible that peaceful negotiations will be easier to achieve once
both Sharon and Arafat leave office. They must do this to preserve
the lives of all their people.</LD>

<TE>   Neither Arafat nor Sharon has the ability to bring peace to the
region because they can't see beyond the gun. They both should step
down and let someone else rule who can put aside the religious hate
and work toward a peaceful solution to this madness. Taking down the
World Trade Center and all the other terrorist acts aimed at the U.S.
around the world have a cord leading back to Israel and Palestine.
Peace between Israel and Palestine will sever that cord to the
terrorist cells, and then we could exterminate the rats one by one
without taking on the whole world.</TE>
<TE>   It is very hard to shake hands with someone while holding a gun.</TE>

<TE>   Finally, after all the blather that President Bush is responsible
for the deteriorating conditions in the Middle East, Robert Satloff
(Commentary, April 3) sets the record straight. Presidents from Jimmy
Carter on have made sincere efforts to achieve peace between Israel
and the Palestinians. All failed. Why? Because there is such intense
hatred of the Israelis by the Palestinians and the whole Muslim world
that they will only be reasonably satisfied when Israel is destroyed,
which is their stated goal. Arafat was offered 95% of what he wanted
and turned it down. He does not want a resolution of the conflict.
Bush is supposed to overcome that? Hopeless.</TE>

<TE>   Re "Drop Peace Effort, Right Urges Bush," April 3: The right, as
in the same folks who oppose abortion as murder and feel that we need
prayer in our schools, now feels that we should not engage in
pressing for peace in Palestine? I guess this reveals the fundamental
hypocrisy of the movement--unwanted children in this country are
sacred, but the lives of the Palestinians and Israelis are not. Maybe
it's because they are not good Christians who vote in our elections?
This is not a conservative position, nor is it a right position. It
is mean-spirited, shortsighted and directly against the interests of
the U.S.</TE>

<TE>   It must cause great consternation to the traditionally liberal
Jewish American community to watch the extreme liberal left abandon
Israel in its time of need. One knows that the left has lost its way
when "peace activists" attempt to protect Arafat by rushing to serve
as his human shield. These extremists have become apologists for this
thug and his suicide bombers. Their natural loathing for America has
been transferred to the undercutting of Israel's security. While
Israel has its faults, America must never forsake its democratic
ally.</TE>

<TE>   Each year the U.S. gives Israel $3 billion in foreign aid. Israel
uses this money to finance its horrific assault on the Palestinians.
The heartbreaking scenes that we see on TV are your tax dollars at
work. Bush could put an end to this assault by issuing an ultimatum
to Israel to stop the attack and to evacuate the West Bank, with the
proviso that failure to instantly comply will result in termination
of aid.</TE>

<HD>TEST CASE: UC Versus the SAT</HD>
<DH>The biggest change in the SAT's history may occur because
the test's largest user bullied the College Board.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MATTHEW BELLONI</AU>
<BD>Matthew Belloni is Notes editor of the Southern
California Law Review at USC Law School and a former Opinion editor
of the Daily Californian at UC Berkeley.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The University of California may have accomplished a task not
possible in 30 years of education reform: convincing the test-making
wizards at the College Board to radically overhaul their most
hallowed and feared exam, the SAT I.</LD>
<LD>   And we can follow the money to figure out why.</LD>
<LD>   The nine-campus, 130,000-undergraduate UC system is the largest
and most prestigious public university in the country, so when its
president and regents began discussing how to eliminate the SAT and
replace it with a test that more accurately reflects what is taught
in the classroom, the College Board took notice.</LD>
<TE>   UC President Richard C. Atkinson, in a bold speech last year, said
he does not believe the current SAT evaluates what California
students are taught in K-12 classrooms. He went on to recommend that
the UCs should "require only standardized tests that assess mastery
of specific subject areas rather than undefined notions of 'aptitude'
or 'intelligence.'" He suggested that applicants should no longer be
required to take the SAT I. Earlier this year, acting on Atkinson's
suggestions, the UC Board of Admissions and Relations with Schools
proposed dropping the SAT in favor of a core exam that would include
a writing portion and test material taught in classes that make up
the course requirements for UC.</TE>
<TE>   Rather than lose its biggest client, the East Coast testing
organization has taken swift action. Recently, fewer than 10 days
after the regents discussed the possibility of switching to a new
exam, College Board President Gaston Caperton announced that the
company is considering major adjustments to the SAT, including
possibly trimming or removing the analogy section and adding a
writing portion. College Board officials are even working directly
with UC to develop a new exam to reflect its concerns. The biggest
change in the SAT's history may occur because the largest user of the
test has flexed its collective muscle to bully the College Board into
adopting its preferred rules.</TE>
<TE>   "To the extent that this is anything but a business decision, the
rest is just ornamental," said Jay Rosner, executive director of the
Princeton Review Foundation, the public-interest arm of the huge test
preparation company. "You have a business, and a client that
represents 15% of your business is telling you your product isn't
working. You want revenues to drop 15%? You want to lay off 15% of
your workforce?"</TE>
<TE>   The ethics of the College Board's sudden courtship of UC seem
questionable on both sides. Atkinson's commendable goal is to craft
an exam that better rewards students who pay attention in high
school, eventually elevating the level of K-12 learning to meet the
standards of the new test. Yet instead of engaging in a national
dialogue with testing companies and other prominent education
officials, the UC system has threatened to pull out of the SAT if its
demands are not met, essentially grabbing the reins in any
negotiations to come.</TE>
<TE>   College Board officials claim the changes currently on the table
are part of the evolving nature of the test, which underwent
revisions in 1993 and 1994 . Yet the timing of its decision is fairly
transparent. "UC is their biggest customer. If it wants changes, it
can order changes," said author Nicholas Lemann, a proponent of
Atkinson's ideas and the author of "The Big Test," a critical history
of the SAT. "To keep UC, the College Board will make the changes it
wants."</TE>
<TE>   The College Board is a member organization representing more than
4,000 colleges, universities and high schools. Its board of trustees,
which includes representatives from schools nationwide, voted late
last month to form a commission to discuss the issue. Any proposed
changes to the SAT will wind their way through committees and be
discussed extensively among the member schools, and Caperton himself
recently sent an e-mail to the trustees warning of a looming debate
on the issue. Yet, so far, the testing service has met only with UC
policymakers, and their concerns seem to be driving the debate. If
there exists any serious opposition to the most major changes in the
SAT's history, it has yet to be voiced publicly by a university
leader.</TE>
<TE>   According to Kris Zavoli, a College Board official who has
participated in the first meetings with UC, no changes will occur
until the new test wins widespread support. "We have 4,000 members
and we will take the proposal to different audiences," she said. "We
won't make any changes until the full membership looks at this." But
unless policy boards at other schools are brought into the debate
now, the board of trustees will be presented with a document designed
largely to appease UC, and this may not be in the best interests of
schools nationwide.</TE>
<TE>   The SAT has always had problems. It's a peculiar exam, full of
arbitrary vocabulary and contextual analogies. It's designed to
measure everything without actually testing anything. Educators and
activists have for years complained that the test is racist,
classist, and does not accurately reflect a student's potential for
achievement. The exam is particularly tough for those without money
to pay for expensive preparation courses that teach the ins-and-outs
of how to beat it. Yet despite some tinkering--antonyms have been
dropped and the names in questions have morphed from Mike to Miguel
and Warner to Wang--the test has remained relatively unchanged, still
acting as a de facto I.Q. test for college-bound students.</TE>
<TE>   SAT proponents nationally say it's this universal quality that
makes the test such a good indicator of potential achievement.
Despite the wide variety of education strategies and the varying
meaning of grades, all students eventually are evaluated for college
admission using at least one common gauge.</TE>
<TE>   This universal standard would still exist in a new exam, but the
question is, whose goals will the test reflect? Right now, the
University of California is playing a central if not dominant role in
creating the standard upon which the rest of the country will be
judged. UC's idea of a quality high-school education may soon help
determine who gets into college in other states.</TE>
<TE>   Atkinson is to be commended for beginning the dialogue on whether
the SAT truly serves its purpose. Most people agree it could be
better tailored to test what students should know to succeed in
college. But his strategy of pressuring the College Board to adopt
UC's standards is a strong-arm tactic that exposes both UC's level of
influence and the College Board's willingness to sell out.</TE>
<TE>   Marlyn McGrath Lewis, director of admissions at Harvard
University, said she believes the SAT has its shortcomings, but she
wonders whether a new exam emphasizing what students learn in high
school will stray from the very reason her school relies on the SAT.
"We try not to over-reward preparation. A college wants to know two
things: one, how well prepared a student is, and two, what kind of
potential students have to be successful and use their education."
Lewis said she believes the current SAT, for instance, does a good
job of predicting the intellectual success of a student who may not
have attended a strong high school. But Harvard and other schools are
taking a wait-and-see approach, for the moment, largely because any
new SAT is not expected to see the lead of a No. 2 pencil until 2006.
"That's plenty of time to learn about this plan," Lewis said.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps in shifting the focus to what is taught in the classroom,
Atkinson cares less about ensuring quality in Harvard's freshman
class and more about providing incentives to improve K-12 instruction
in California and nationwide. Yet the independent, curriculum-devoid
value of the SAT may be a casualty of the new test, and it remains
unclear if this is a good thing. Indeed, the College Board's Zavoli
said recent surveys suggest that because of rampant grade inflation,
the current SAT is more useful than ever.</TE>
<TE>   Ironically, UC was one of the pioneers of the standardized testing
movement. Forced during the 1960s to deal with an unprecedented tidal
wave of students, the regents looked for a way to judge candidates
against each other in as impartial a manner as feasible. The SAT,
previously an Ivy League phenomenon with only mild support elsewhere,
quickly filled the void and grew into the mandatory juggernaut it is
today.</TE>
<TE>   Just as UC first legitimized the SAT and the use--and now
non-use--of race-based affirmative action in admissions, it may again
lead the charge to significantly alter the way students are admitted
to college. For years, calls for reforming the SAT fell on deaf ears.
And now the College Board seems ready to let its biggest client
negotiate a new test for everyone. Higher education administrators
nationwide should get themselves a seat at that table.</TE>

<HD>A Heads-Up on Ways to Ensure Sprinklers Work Properly</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GARY ABRAMS</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With spring's warmer weather, it's important to make sure your lawn
and garden sprinklers are in top shape. Heads often clog with debris
or are sometimes damaged by lawn-care equipment.</LD>
<LD>   Sprinkler care is something most homeowners can do in less than an
hour with a flat-blade screwdriver and a pair of channel-lock pliers.</LD>
<LD>   To get started, activate each sprinkler valve individually to
observe its watering characteristics (follow instructions for manual
operation if you have an automatic system). Here are a few fix-it
tips:</LD>
<TE>   * Clogged heads. If you see little or no water coming from a
particular head, odds are debris is blocking the head orifice or
built-in filter screen.</TE>
<TE>   To clear the clog, remove the head insert from the center of the
head with channel-lock pliers by turning it counterclockwise. Just
inside the head insert you might see a plastic filter that looks like
an inverted cone. Pry it out with a small screwdriver and clean it
with an old toothbrush. Turn on the sprinkler valve and let it run
until a "geyser" appears and water flows steady and clear.</TE>
<TE>   Before reinstalling the filter, inspect the openings in the head
insert for blockages. Poke a thin wire into any holes and rinse under
running water. Now reinstall the filter screen and head insert and
test the line. Adjust the spray for proper aim and volume.</TE>
<TE>   * Improper aim or over-spray. Sprinklers that are aimed
incorrectly or over-spray the target not only waste water but can
cause serious damage to paint, stucco and wood surfaces on a home.</TE>
<TE>   To correct aim, use the channel-lock pliers to turn the head so
the spray is directed away from the building or walkways. To correct
over-spray, use the screwdriver to turn the adjustment screw at the
center of the insert clockwise until the spray volume is reduced to
the proper size. Conversely, if you notice dry areas try turning the
screw counterclockwise to increase water flow.</TE>
<TE>   * Puddling. Puddling of water around the sprinkler head is a waste
of water. It's normally caused by nothing more than deflection of the
spray by grass or plants that have grown around the head. This will
result in dry spots that will leave dead areas in your lawn and
garden. Always keep at least a 12-inch-diameter circle of low-cut
grass around each head and make sure plants are trimmed away so the
spray is unobstructed.</TE>
<TE>   * Impulse sprinklers. Impulse sprinklers, commonly known as "rain
birds," distribute water over a large area by a series of bursts of
water that cause the head to turn slightly with each spray to cover a
pattern. The spray pattern will sometimes need adjusting for optimal
coverage by turning a small screw on the side of the nozzle or by
moving the "reversing" tabs at the base of the sprinkler to change
the size of the spray arc.</TE>
<TE>   * Timers. Most residential sprinkler systems are set up to operate
automatically with a timer control. Periodically check your lawn and
garden to assure you are not over- or under-watering at any station
and adjust the timer according to the instructions if necessary. If
you are unsure about proper watering time in your area or how to
adjust the timer, ask for advice at a local nursery.</TE>
<TE>   * Wiring problems. Automatic sprinklers operate by sending an
electrical charge from the timer to the sprinkler valves through a
series of thin wires. Periodically check the wires for signs of wear
or weathering. Also check the valves themselves for rust, corrosion
or other telltale signs of trouble. Replace parts that appear
questionable to avoid a problem.</TE>

<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Today's floors are being covered faster, better and more beautifully
than ever before.</LD>
<LD>   The recent Surfaces 2002 trade show in Las Vegas featured new and
improved flooring techniques and products. Here's what we found:</LD>
<LD>   * Many natural hardwoods--in classic and exotic species--now offer
gleaming prefinished urethane surfaces that intensify grain and
provide high scratch- and abrasion-resistance for extended wear.</LD>
<TE>   * Improved staining, new colors and deeply distressed and
hand-scraped wood surfaces provide eye-catching designs.</TE>
<TE>   * New flooring concepts are giving traditional wood floors a
serious run for their money. These range from engineered woods and
unusual hybrid-composite products to high-pressure plastic-laminate
surfaces like those on your kitchen or bath counter tops--only 10
times tougher. They look just like wood planks, stone or ceramic
tiles.</TE>
<TE>   * One of the more intriguing new entries is bamboo flooring. While
bamboo has been around for thousands of years in woven-mat form,
today's bamboo is milled, engineered and finished to provide beauty
and durability. Bamboo floors are beautiful and are harder than oak
or maple.</TE>
<TE>   * Another surprise is the strong emergence and growing popularity
of cork flooring. We're not talking about your bulletin-board variety
of cork, but rather attractive new textures and multi-tone designs
that are--as with bamboo and other woods--prefinished with durable
high-tech surfaces to offer durability and a warm, lasting beauty.</TE>
<TE>   * The biggest buzz was centered on new glueless flooring systems.
Whether natural wood planks, parquet tiles or the newer laminate,
bamboo or cork flooring, each individual piece is engineered with a
tongue-and-groove design that snaps together. It eliminates nailing
and gluing and creates a tightly fit floor that just "floats" above
the existing subsurface.</TE>
<TE>   A glueless floor can be "unsnapped" and removed almost as easily.
This is a nice feature if you want to replace a damaged piece.
Another interesting offshoot: Renters can now enjoy the beauty of a
wood or wood-look floor and then take it along when they move.</TE>
<TE>   * Another long-awaited flooring innovation finally has been
perfected and now is being offered to homeowners. Combining the
latest in high-pressure laminate surfaces with new tight-fit glueless
snap-seam technology, a Belgian manufacturer has added a plastic base
and matched tight-fit edge moldings to make a waterproof system. The
company's Hydrofloor offers the look and warmth of wood and the
durability and wear of laminate surfaces, and now provides a ready
answer for wet bathroom and kitchen floors.</TE>
<TE>   * Ceramic and porcelain tiles are another product with a new look.
Designer surfacing now ranges from deep texturing and high-definition
relief tiles to hand-painted designs and pieces with a rugged, aged
appearance. Floor and wall offerings include many new
shapes--allowing intricate and exotic design combinations--and many
new tiles and trim pieces with spectacular metallic surfaces.</TE>
<TE>   Today, flooring is being cut and crafted into patterns, designs
and inserts never before possible. Computer-controlled lasers,
routers and precision water jets can now re-create virtually any
image, in various forms (from cutting to engraving), in just about
any flooring material that exists.</TE>

<LD>Actor Nicolas Cage has purchased a beachfront home in Marina del Rey
for about $2.7 million.</LD>
<LD>   The newly built home has four bedrooms and 4.5 bathrooms in about
4,400 square feet. It has ocean views from most of the rooms, and it
has a rooftop deck.</LD>
<LD>   The winner of a best actor Oscar (for "Leaving Las Vegas," 1995)
also has homes in Bel-Air, New Orleans and Malibu, where he owns
nearly 400 acres of land. In December, he bought an acre of land in
Bel-Air for about $6 million.</LD>
<TE>   Cage, 38, co-stars with Meryl Streep in "Adaptation," a movie due
out later this year. He has the leading role of a World War II
soldier assigned to protect Native American code breakers in
"Windtalkers," to be released June 14.</TE>
<TE>   He is also making his feature directorial debut with the movie
"Sonny," filmed recently in New Orleans. While making the movie,
starring James Franco ("Freaks and Geeks"), Cage bought a
200-year-old house in the French Quarter of the city.</TE>
<TE>   Cage co-starred with Penelope Cruz in "Captain Corelli's
Mandolin," released last year.</TE>
<TE>   Flea, bassist with the Red Hot Chili Peppers, has sold his home
off Mulholland Drive for slightly more than $1.5 million.</TE>
<TE>   The buyer is Ben Silverman, chief executive of Reveille, an
independent studio that is backed by Vivendi Universal.</TE>
<TE>   The bicoastal Silverman, 31, is said to be planning to keep his
apartment in New York.</TE>
<TE>   The Country English-style home that Silverman purchased is on
almost two acres behind gates and at the end of a long, private
drive. Built in 1948, the three-bedroom compound includes a main
house with panoramic city views and a den/office; a detached
recording studio, hiking trails and a pool.</TE>
<TE>   Flea, also known as Michael Balzary, is moving to Malibu,
according to Realtors in the beach community. The Australian-born
rocker, 39, was a co-founder of the Red Hot Chili Peppers in 1983.</TE>
<TE>   Richard Ehrlich of Westside Estate Agency, Beverly Hills,
represented Silverman in buying, and Barry Sloane of Sotheby's
International Realty, Beverly Hills, had the listing, sources said.</TE>
<TE>   Comedian, actor and director Howard Morris, a regular cast member
and writer on TV in the '50s with Sid Caesar's "Your Show of Shows,"
has purchased the Hancock Park-area home of actor Christopher Lloyd,
best known for his roles in the movie "Back to the Future" and the TV
comedy series "Taxi."</TE>
<TE>   Morris, 82, bought the house for $675,000. Built in the '20s, the
house has two bedrooms in just under 2,000 square feet, plus a guest
house.</TE>
<TE>   It was Lloyd's home for 20 years, and, during that time, it had
been a "work in progress" for the actor and architect Robert De
Young, who planted rare and exotic plants in the yard and installed
such art pieces inside as a ceramic counter said to resemble works of
Spanish architect Antonio Gaudi.</TE>
<TE>   Morris appeared in such movies as "Boys' Night Out" (1962), "The
Nutty Professor" (1963), "High Anxiety" (1977), "History of the
World: Part I" (1981) and "Life Stinks" (1991). He directed many TV
series and such movies as "Who's Minding the Mint" (1967). He also
appeared on many TV series and was a regular voice in "The Jetsons,"
"The Flintstones" and "Mr. Magoo."</TE>
<TE>   Lloyd, 63, appeared in the HBO adaptation of "Wit" (2001). He also
appeared as himself in the movie "Man on the Moon" (1999) and played
Uncle Martin in the movie "My Favorite Martian" (1999).</TE>
<TE>   Susan Chadney of Prudential John Aaroe, Hancock Park, had the
listing. Mikki Wood of Sotheby's, Beverly Hills, represented Morris
in buying.</TE>
<TE>   Actress Cheryl Chase, who does the voice of Angelica in the
"Rugrats" animated series and movies, has purchased a home in the
Sunset Strip area and put her former home in Valencia on the market.</TE>
<TE>   The house she bought, for slightly more than $800,000, has three
bedrooms in 2,000-plus square feet. The house was once owned by
actress Betty Hutton.</TE>
<TE>   The Cape Cod-style home was built in the mid-'50s but has been
renovated. It has a fireplace in the living room and parking for
three cars.</TE>
<TE>   The home Chase listed, at just under $420,000, has four bedrooms
in about 2,400 square feet. The home was built in 1999 and has had
more than $115,000 in upgrades. Among the features are a loft,
fireplace, breakfast bar, office/computer room and balcony. The
community has a pool, spa and tennis courts.</TE>
<TE>   Chase, who has worked on "Rugrats" for nearly a decade, is
currently doing voices for "Angelica and Susie's School Days," due
out in 2003.</TE>
<TE>   She did the voices of Baby Elizabeth in the 1993 movie "Baby
Boom," starring Diane Keaton, and Baby Pubert in "Addams Family
Values" (1987). She also did voice-over parts for Nickelodeon's "Ren
&amp; Stimpy Show."</TE>
<TE>   Patrick Abbott at SCV Homes Inc. in Valencia has the listing.</TE>
<TE>   Iris Karni at Re/Max represented Chase in buying her new home,
which Keith Cox at Coldwell Banker, Beverly Hills, had listed.</TE>
<TE>   A Laguna Beach home owned until 18 months ago by Richie Sambora,
lead guitarist with the rock band Bon Jovi, has been listed at just
under $1.8 million. Pop star Ricky Nelson owned the property in
earlier days.</TE>
<TE>   Sambora, who is now married to "Spin City" star Heather Locklear,
spent two years redoing the house after he bought it in 1988. In
1990, he had the house gutted and rebuilt with no nails, to resemble
Craftsman-style homes built in the early 1900s in Pasadena.</TE>
<TE>   Before they were married in 1994, Locklear was impressed with what
Sambora had accomplished on the house, said listing agent Patrick
Tenore of Nationwide USA Real Estate in Newport Beach.</TE>
<TE>   Sambora sold the house when Locklear bought a larger one in the
same neighborhood. Now Locklear is considering buying back the
smaller house to use for their guests, Tenore said. The Realtor
originally sold the house to Sambora and has since handled other
deals for the couple.</TE>
<TE>   Situated in a gated community a few steps to the ocean, the house
has three bedrooms and two bathrooms in nearly 1,600 square feet. The
home also has ocean views, a private spa and a view deck capable of
holding 50 people.</TE>

<HD>Low-Rate Libor Mortgages Carry a High Risk</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL>ALEXANDRIA, Va.</DL>
<LD>Lance Kotschwar knocked $704 off the monthly mortgage payment for his
home with a loan tied to the short-term interest rate international
banks charge each other.</LD>
<LD>   The savings come from the 3% interest the mortgage charges,
compared with the average 7% interest on a 30-year fixed-rate
mortgage.</LD>
<LD>   In the past year, about 18,000 U.S. homeowners have taken out such
mortgages, whose interest rates are adjusted each month on shifts in
the London inter-bank offered rate, or Libor, the Mortgage Bankers
Assn. of America said. The Libor mortgage is among an expanding
variety of loans lenders are offering to try to maintain the
industry's record growth and compensate for a decline in the
profitability of traditional fixed-rate mortgages.</LD>
<TE>   "I call it the mass customization of the market," said Doug
Duncan, chief economist at the association. Borrowers today can
choose loans with adjustable rates that convert to fixed rates after
three, five or seven years, fixed-rate loans that convert to
adjustable, and loans that charge only interest for a set period.
Libor-based loans account for about 1% of all mortgages, Duncan said.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. mortgage volume rose to $2.03 trillion last year, eclipsing
the 1998 record by 35%, according to the association. Consumers
refinanced home loans to take advantage of the lowest mortgage rates
in 30 years, as the Federal Reserve cut interest rates in an attempt
to spark the economy.</TE>
<TE>   Increased competition has hurt lenders' profits, even as the
mortgage market boomed. Closing costs and other fees on conventional
30-year mortgages fell to 0.56% of the loan amount last year from
2.56% in 1985, according to the Federal Housing Finance Board.</TE>
<TE>   Lenders push adjustable-rate mortgages because profit margins on
such loans are as high as 28%, compared with 24% for fixed-rate
mortgages, said Jonathan Gray, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein &amp;
Co. The interest rate on the Libor mortgage is based on the rate
charged for large loans between the most credit-worthy international
banks. That rate is the benchmark for loans to countries and
corporations. It tracks the Federal Funds rate, which the Federal
Reserve uses to regulate the supply of money in the U.S. economy,
more closely than other mortgage benchmarks do.</TE>
<TE>   Libor bottomed at 1.73% in January. Interest rates on Libor
mortgages fell as low as about 2.9% after lenders tacked on a service
payment of 1.12%.</TE>
<TE>   The low rate comes with a high risk. The rate adjusts monthly,
making the loans best suited to wealthy borrowers, who can better
weather the rapid rate shifts, lenders said.</TE>
<TE>   Libor has been known to rise quickly when the Fed starts
increasing interest rates, as it did in 1994. That year, Fed
policymakers raised interest rates to keep the economy from growing
too fast, and the 1-month Libor rose to 6.19% from 3.13%. The rate on
the 30-year fixed-mortgage, by comparison, rose to 9.18% from 6.97%.</TE>
<TE>   "Higher net-worth borrowers are spending a smaller part of their
income on their mortgages, so if the rate rises it doesn't severely
impact their lifestyles," said Steven Schnall, president of New York
Mortgage Co., which has made about 45 of the loans since it began
offering them four months ago. The average loan amount for a
Libor-based mortgage at New York Mortgage is $1 million.</TE>
<TE>   Kotschwar, a 36-year-old lawyer working for the U.S. House of
Representatives, wouldn't reveal the size of his loan. He is using
the monthly savings to make up for income lost when his wife, Linda,
left her job to stay at home with their 9-month-old son.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't see interest rates getting wacky any time soon," he said.
"If they do, I'll refinance after the year is up."</TE>

<AU>ROBERT GRISWOLD</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Question: Recently my lease ended, and I turned in my keys. Earlier
in the year, my car received some water damage while parked in the
underground parking lot. I informed the property management, who
never responded to my inquiry. I contacted them again at the end of
my lease, and they instructed me to get a quote from a specific
repair shop. I supplied that quote, along with two others.</LD>
<LD>   How do I proceed if they do not respond to my request for repairs?
They have not disputed their responsibility.</LD>
<LD>   Property manager Robert Griswold replies:</LD>
<TE>   It sounds like the management company has acknowledged
responsibility. I would advise sending a formal demand letter briefly
highlighting the fact that your property was damaged; that you
contacted them and they advised getting a quote from a specific
repair shop; that you are including copies of other bids; that you
would like compensation for the amount of the most reasonable repair
estimate; and that you would like a response within two weeks.</TE>
<TE>   In this first letter, keep the tone cordial and do not threaten
legal action. If this doesn't work, send a stronger letter, saying
that you are giving them 10 days or you will be forced to take legal
action and seek reimbursement for legal costs. If necessary, take
them to Small Claims Court.</TE>
<TE>   Attorney Ted Smith replies:</TE>
<TE>   Not so fast. I'm not convinced that the landlord is responsible
for the water damage to the car while it was sitting in the carport.
Where did this water come from? Is it from a natural flow? Was a
window or the top left down, and why? These questions need to be
answered.</TE>
<TE>   A claim should be filed first with your car insurance company.
Your insurance company will probably honor the claim without
assigning fault. In this case, the landlord will not be responsible
unless there is a clear showing of the landlord's negligence in
causing the water damage to the car.</TE>
<TE>   Who Pays for Damage</TE>
<TE>   by Tenant's Child?</TE>
<TE>   Q: Recently, one of my children accidentally broke the window of a
vacant unit at our rental community. Since it was an accident and
there are no designated play areas for the children, I have refused
to pay for the window replacement.</TE>
<TE>   Now I have been informed that the manager has deducted the cost of
the new window from my security deposit and I have 30 days to
replenish the security deposit or I will be evicted. Can they do
this? Am I right in not paying for the window?</TE>
<TE>   Tenants' rights attorney Steven R. Kellman replies:</TE>
<TE>   It may seem unfair that there are no designated play areas for
children at your complex, but there does not appear to be any
specific legal requirement to provide such areas. The law does,
however, prohibit discrimination against families with children. This
may be applicable if your complex prohibits children playing in areas
that are clearly appropriate for such playing. Certain actions by
landlords to keep families with children out of a complex may be
illegal discrimination.</TE>
<TE>   Even if such may be the case in your complex, your refusal to pay
for the glass may get you in trouble. The saying, "You broke it, you
pay for it" may apply here. Even though the breakage was an accident,
someone has to bear the responsibility for the damage. As the parent,
that will probably be you.</TE>
<TE>   If there is illegal discrimination at your complex, that will not
alter your responsibility for the glass.</TE>
<TE>   Giving you 30 days to repay the deposit used for the repairs is a
reasonable action by the landlord. You should consider paying this
sum to avoid a 30-day notice to move, which may generally be given
with no specific stated grounds. You could consider giving your own
30-day notice and move to a complex more suitable for children. It
would merit further investigation if moving out is just what the
landlord is forcing you, and any other family with children, to do.</TE>
<TE>   Smith replies:</TE>
<TE>   There is nothing unfair, illegal or even immoral about asking for
the tenant to be responsible for the damage caused by her child in
this case. There are good reasons. It is well settled that one who
damages apartment property through carelessness is responsible. The
tenant is responsible for the acts of the child.</TE>
<TE>   California's fair housing laws force the landlord to be neutral
regarding any protected class. Landlords are legally required to take
children in rentals. There can be no special treatment. The erection
of play areas for children could be viewed as discrimination against
singles or seniors with no children.</TE>
<TE>   There is more bad news for the resident. The security deposit can
be used for damages caused by the child. Here, the landlord has a
rarely used but legal clause that allows for the deduction, even
though the tenant is still living in the apartment. The lease
provision requires the security deposit to be replenished after it is
used for the window.</TE>
<TE>   You should replenish the deposit to avoid further legal
proceedings.</TE>

<DH>Several Southland developments provide workable models for
much-needed elderly housing, offering affordability with quality.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Let's eat!" announced Jeanetta Perl, as she hauled platters of
steaming vegetables and roasted chicken into the cozy dining room at
Co-Op One in Los Angeles' Fairfax district. The table, set for nine,
brimmed with salads and side dishes, china and cheer.</LD>
<LD>   The residents of the homey converted duplex, owned by the West
Hollywood nonprofit group Alternative Living for the Aging, needed no
prodding to begin the evening meal, the aroma of which wafted through
the home's sun-dappled living room, adding warmth to the already
convivial gathering.</LD>
<LD>   "I love it here," Elsie Oeschler said. "We're like a family."</LD>
<TE>   Oeschler, 68, and her housemates count themselves among the
fortunate few who have managed to find comfortable low-cost housing
amid an affordable-housing crisis that has left seniors in the
Southland scrambling to find shelter.</TE>
<TE>   With average one-bedroom apartment rents at $1,089 in Los Angeles
County and $1,032 a month in Orange County, according to RealFacts, a
Novato, Calif.-based firm that tracks apartment rentals in the
western United States, seniors whose sole income is derived from
Social Security benefits increasingly find themselves jammed into
tiny apartments or forced to impose on family members who often
cannot deal with the special needs of aging parents or relatives.</TE>
<TE>   "The general housing movement ignores elderly housing issues,"
said Jon Pynoos, director of the National Resource Center on
Supportive Housing and Home Modification at USC's Andrus Gerontology
Center. "There always is talk about overcrowding and low-income
people. But the needs of frail persons over 75 ... are huge."</TE>
<TE>   In California, seniors who rely exclusively on Social Security
benefits spend more than half of those checks on rent in 39 of the
state's 58 counties, according to "Housing for Older Californians," a
working paper published by the University of California's California
Policy Research Center. Typical benefit payments for individuals
living on their own are about $750 a month.</TE>
<TE>   "In L.A., many seniors can't afford to live even in dinky
apartments," said Syed Rushdy, director of housing development for
the Los Angeles County Community Development Commission. "Their
incomes are fixed, and often they have no money left for food and
medication."</TE>
<TE>   Building Models for</TE>
<TE>   Independent Living</TE>
<TE>   The problem will only intensify as the number of those 65 years
and older in the L.A. metropolitan area grows to a projected 1.1
million by 2005, up 8.4% from 974,000 in 2000, according to 2000 U.S.
Census data.</TE>
<TE>   In an effort to ease the housing emergency, for-profit and
nonprofit developers, often in partnerships with city, county, state
and federal agencies, have built a variety of housing complexes for
seniors which, although small in number, serve as models for
independent living.</TE>
<TE>   Among the more innovative is Alternative Living for the Aging,
which allows seniors to enjoy a family setting, while maintaining
their independence.</TE>
<TE>   Long before the current affordable-housing crisis made the news,
Janet Witkin, 55, realized the urgent need for decent living
facilities for seniors. So in 1978 she established the organization
that runs five cooperative communities, some of which are
courtyard-apartment settings where residents live separately but
agree to check in with each other under a buddy system, and others
where residents have their own bedrooms and bathrooms, and share
common kitchens and living rooms.</TE>
<TE>   The group also runs a roommate-matching program that helps seniors
find living quarters with others, or assists them in finding younger
boarders who often help the elderly homeowners in exchange for rent.</TE>
<TE>   Alternative Living for the Aging purchases buildings with help
from federal tax credits, city and private funding. Rents range from
$385 to $495 a month; the latter includes five dinners a week.</TE>
<TE>   "I like the freedom here," said Harriet Dickerson, 80, an active
Los Angeles real estate agent. "If I don't want company, I can close
my door."</TE>
<TE>   Across town in Whittier, seniors have found an equally amenable
living arrangement in the recently renovated Seasons at the Hoover, a
50-unit, low-income senior apartment community.</TE>
<TE>   The restored landmark, once home to the fashionable Hoover Hotel,
but most recently a run-down transient hotel with a dingy bar on the
bottom floor, now houses residents such as Patricia Hickey, 66, who
made the Hoover her home in June.</TE>
<TE>   "I was concerned about this type of living arrangement before I
got here, but I've grown to love it," Hickey said. "The Hoover is
affordable, which is important for senior citizens. And the people
here are friendly."</TE>
<TE>   The conversion of Seasons at the Hoover, an award-winning edifice
that features high beam ceilings and the building's original Spanish
tile, to low-income senior housing was a labor of love for developer
Charles Fry, president of Vista Communities in Irvine, and partner
LINC Housing Corp. in Long Beach.</TE>
<TE>   Like similar low-income senior-housing developments, the
$7.8-million Hoover project was funded by multiple sources, including
the Federal Home Loan Bank, the city of Whittier, city of Industry
redevelopment funds and federal low-income housing tax credits.</TE>
<TE>   The funding process took 18 months to complete; construction took
about another year and a half. The building's units were fully
occupied in 90 days, rented sight unseen.</TE>
<TE>   Half of the building's units are reserved for very low-income
residents, who pay $416 a month for a cozy one-bedroom apartment with
kitchen. The other units, also one-bedrooms, cost $467 a month and
are reserved for low-income seniors. Residents at Hoover must be at
least 62 and qualify for low-income housing.</TE>
<TE>   The seniors share a common lounge area, decorated with stylish
furniture and potted plants, where they socialize and watch passersby
on the street, and gather in the card room and media center. A large
multipurpose room is often in demand for potlucks and birthday
parties.</TE>
<TE>   LINC, or Limited-Income Communities, Vista's development partner,
is a nonprofit housing developer that builds, owns and manages 1,866
senior-housing units, including Seasons at Ontario, a mixed-use
development with 80 units for seniors set in a major shopping center.
Residents can walk through the apartment building's "gateway" to a
beauty parlor, pharmacy and other stores.</TE>
<TE>   "Seniors face different psychological issues, but many live in
facilities that don't deal with those issues," said LINC President
Hunter Johnson. "If the management of a building can be sensitive to
their needs, such as making sure their checkbooks are balanced and
making sure they pay the electricity bill on time, sometimes that's
all it takes to keep them independent for a few years, before they
move in with the kids or begin assisted living."</TE>
<TE>   Classes to Promote</TE>
<TE>   Mental, Physical Health</TE>
<TE>   That's where More Than Shelter for Seniors comes in. The North
Hollywood nonprofit organization offers two to five programs a day,
at least three times a week, to seniors living in low-income housing
developments. The computer classes, drama and dance workshops,
cooking and tai chi classes and health education lectures are
believed to promote the mental and physical health of seniors, with
the goal of keeping them out of skilled-nursing homes as long as
possible, said Tim Carpenter, executive director of the group.</TE>
<TE>   Funded primarily by Century Housing Corp., a nonprofit
organization that has financed more than 9,000 affordable-housing
units in Los Angeles, the innovative group has reached more than half
of the 1,500 seniors living at the 10 properties where it has set up
shop.</TE>
<TE>   Among the housing developments that subscribe to the More Than
Shelter for Seniors philosophy is the for-profit Meta Housing Corp.
in Burbank. Meta's award-winning Park Plaza in North Hollywood has
been recognized by the National Council on Seniors for its design
elements and is considered a model for affordable senior housing.</TE>
<TE>   The development features an 8,000-square-foot clubhouse with
kitchen, a billiards room, library, computer center, pool and
exercise room. Rents range from $700 a month, for seniors whose
incomes are 60% of the area median income, to $400 a month, for those
whose incomes are 35% of the area median income.</TE>
<TE>   The 203-unit complex cost $20.6 million to build and was 100%
leased, from among 2,500 applicants, when it opened in March 2001.
The development is part of a revitalization effort underway in North
Hollywood, and is considered superior to many market-rate apartment
complexes in the neighborhood.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the years developers such as Meta Housing Corp. invest in
funding and building low- to moderate-income senior-housing projects,
those involved say they wouldn't choose any other path.</TE>
<TE>   "There are very few occupations in which you can do this much
good," said Meta President John Huskey.</TE>
<TE>   Passionate About</TE>
<TE>   Helping Seniors</TE>
<TE>   For some, advocating for seniors is a passion. Marvin Schachter,
77, a board member of Menorah Housing Foundation, a nonprofit
organization that develops and manages affordable housing for
seniors, has pushed local and state legislators to fund more and
better housing for seniors. L.A. Mayor James K. Hahn supports the
proposed $100-million housing trust fund to build housing for low-
and moderate-income residents, including seniors.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to trying to find remedies for low-income seniors,
Schachter, who also served as past president of the advisory council
of the Los Angeles County Area Agency on Aging, is seeking to help
the middle-income elderly, who he says face tremendous hurdles of
their own. Rents that were stable at $1,000 a month for years have,
in many cases, doubled in Southern California in the last decade.</TE>
<TE>   Seniors whose incomes are about $40,000 a year now find themselves
paying $24,000 a year for an apartment they can no longer afford.</TE>
<TE>   "Now they're having to look for low-income buildings, but they
don't qualify," Schachter said. "They end up having to move farther
away from communities in which they have long ties. Or they end up in
nursing homes or double up with other seniors."</TE>
<TE>   For middle-income seniors who are financially able to stay put but
face physical limitations, Schachter and other experts on the needs
of the elderly recommend that local governments subsidize, at very
low cost, minimal home care to enable seniors to remain independent
as long as possible in their own homes. Nationwide surveys reveal
that seniors prefer remaining in their own homes, close to family and
community ties.</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles Housing Department's Handyworker program offers
free minor home repairs to low- and moderate-income seniors 62 and
older and to residents with disabilities. Services include window
repairs and painting. USC's Pynoos recommends that the state provide
loans directly to low-income homeowners for home repairs and
accessibility improvements.</TE>
<TE>   In general, however, city, county and federal programs use their
resources to close the funding gaps of nonprofit and for-profit
senior-housing projects. The federal Department of Housing and Urban
Development typically kicks in 60% to 75% of the cost of low- to
moderate-income housing projects, according to Bobken Simonians, head
of the Los Angeles Housing Department's finance unit.</TE>
<TE>   Since 1997, the city of Los Angeles has contributed $40 million to
help fund 27 housing projects for seniors. The combined projects
provide 2,000 units of senior housing, Simonians said.</TE>
<TE>   Projects in the unincorporated areas of L.A. County fall under the
aegis of the Los Angeles County Community Development Commission,
which in the last five years has helped fund 1,031 senior housing
units, and has funded an additional 47 that are under construction,
according to the commission's Blair Babcock.</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles Housing Authority owns 1,642 units for seniors.
Additionally, the housing authority has issued 507 Section 8 vouchers
to seniors, who can use the federal money to lease apartments. In
many cases, however, landlords refuse to rent to Section 8 voucher
holders, preferring instead to rent to those who can afford
market-value rates.</TE>
<TE>   While government subsidies have helped add thousands of low- to
moderate-income units into the senior-housing pool, demand still far
outstrips the supply.</TE>
<TE>   The lack of inexpensive housing has forced many adult children of
seniors, such as 50-year-old Priscilla Stephens of Pacific Palisades,
to subsidize their parents to avoid putting them in nursing homes.</TE>
<TE>   Stephens, a psychotherapist, supported her divorced mother, Anne
Taylor, 88, for two decades until Taylor landed a coveted unit at AJS
Associates' Barnard Park Villas in Santa Monica in 1995. Taylor was
on the waiting list for a low-cost apartment for five years.</TE>
<TE>   Stephens also helped her father, Phillip Taylor, and his second
wife buy a home in Northern California 24 years ago, but the
89-year-old car salesman, who retired without a pension, now suffers
from senile dementia, and Stephens is scrambling to find a
skilled-nursing facility for him, which can be funded partially with
government subsidies.</TE>
<TE>   "My biggest fear is that my parents will not be well taken care
of, that they'll be sad and miserable in a nursing home," said
Stephens, who still supports her college-age and teenage children.
"Only those who can afford assisted living can buy the stimulation,
good food preparation and excellent care we all seek for our parents.
But most of us can't afford that."</TE>
<TE>   For those who can afford assisted living, the possibilities are
numerous. The monthly cost of assisted living typically ranges from
$2,000 to $4,000 a month and up, depending on the location and
amenities offered. All assisted-living developments are private; they
receive no government subsidies.</TE>
<TE>   Pasadena's Villa Gardens was established 75 years ago by the
California Teachers Assn. for a handful of retired educators who were
living in an abandoned chicken coop, the only housing they could
afford.</TE>
<TE>   The teachers association asked its Southern California members to
donate $2 a year to help retired teachers afford assisted-living
care. The first CTA-sponsored units were erected in Inglewood in
1927, and in 1933 another opened in Pasadena, housing up to 20
retired teachers.</TE>
<TE>   Today Villa Gardens, one of the less-expensive Southern California
assisted-living complexes, boasts 325 units, including 54
skilled-nursing rooms. About 40% of Villa Gardens' residents are
retired educators.</TE>
<TE>   'I Like the Services,</TE>
<TE>   the Security'</TE>
<TE>   Residents at the Pasadena complex, and at most assisted-living
developments, make a down payment to get in the program, then pay a
monthly additional fee for perpetual care, which steps up as needed.</TE>
<TE>   Toby Osos, 81, put down $110,000 five years ago at Villa Gardens,
and pays $1,500 a month for a one-bedroom apartment. "I like the
services, the security, knowing that no one will have to look after
me. If I break a hip, I know what my expenses will be; they won't go
up."</TE>
<TE>   In Newport Beach, Vintage Senior Housing operates market-rate
senior-housing complexes. Units cost from $1,800 a month for a studio
to $3,500 a month for large one-bedroom units. For those who need
medication management, an additional $350 is paid per month, and
those seeking full assisted-living services pay an additional $1,500
a month.</TE>
<TE>   "It's still less expensive than having a private-duty nurse, which
can run $50,000 a year," said Vintage principal Eric Davidson. "Our
housing is for middle-income people and up."</TE>
<TE>   Orange County residents who cannot afford those rents rely on
developers such as Jamboree Housing Corp. in Irvine, which owns 294
units, financed primarily through tax-exempt bonds and low-income
housing lenders.</TE>
<TE>   But wait lists for low-income senior housing are notoriously long,
and building managers like Mike Sangriu at the Menorah Housing
Foundation's Adams Senior Housing in Los Angeles despair over the
numbers of seniors they have to turn away.</TE>
<TE>   "I get 25 calls a day just to get on the wait list, and I have to
turn them down," Sangriu said.</TE>

<LD>Hard water leaves its mark on shower walls and glass shower
enclosures in the form of crusty, white lime deposits that sometimes
seem impossible to remove. Here are a couple of methods that should
help:</LD>
<LD>   Sodium carbonate is the chemical you'll want to use. It's the base
for many cleaners.</LD>
<LD>   If a strong solution of sodium carbonate doesn't do the trick, try
a squirt of liquid toilet-bowl cleaner. Bowl cleaners include strong,
dangerous chemicals, so use them with eye-and-skin protection and
plenty of ventilation.</LD>
<TE>   Once the water stains are gone, apply a coat of car wax to all the
wall surfaces in the shower. Doing so will make cleaning a breeze.</TE>

<BD>WASHINGTON POST</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>If you're a lifelong fan of a team, then, at least once, you
absolutely positively want to win the biggest prize in your sport.</LD>
<LD>   How long can you hang your hat on that one championship?</LD>
<LD>   Forever, if need be.</LD>
<TE>   Some masochists and puritan Red Sox fans might feel otherwise. But
normal people, like Maryland Terrapin basketball fans, grasp the
concept of closure. That's why Terps fans are in heaven this week.
They finally have that championship glow.</TE>
<TE>   After your team reaches its highest goal, you feel that intense
tingle of satisfaction for days and sporadically for weeks. You had
nothing to do with it. But it's yours. Who says nothing in life is
free? Finally, on sweet unpredictable occasions, you find yourself
grinning that private victory smile right up until the next season.</TE>
<TE>   Years later, it still pops up. You see a middle-aged scout, like
Kevin Grevey, in the stands at the Final Four. And you suddenly think
of him throwing in southpaw jump shots from the left wing for the
Bullets in the NBA Finals. You glimpse gray-haired Scott McGregor at
an Oriole game and there he is, young again in your mind, shutting
out the Phillies to win the World Series.</TE>
<TE>   The sight, or the mention, of Juan Dixon, Lonny Baxter and Coach
Gary Williams will now bring those same clean, permanent
recollections of joy--and of ourselves at another part of our
life--to the mind's eyes of Maryland fans for the rest of their
lives. Heck, the mention of Drew Nicholas or Ryan Randle might be
enough.</TE>
<TE>   Because I've lived in this area all my life, the phone has been
ringing steadily this week with old friends who are Maryland fans.
Telling, and retelling, the saga of your team's quest is part of the
proper digestion process. You've got to nail it down just right.</TE>
<TE>   For Wizards' fans, the year was 1978, when their team was still
the Bullets. For Oriole fans, it was 1983, after the
last-day-of-the-season heartbreak of 1982. For Georgetown basketball
fans, the year that's circled in memory is 1984. But please, don't
mention that shot in the finals by Michael Jordan in 1982 or a
miracle team named Villanova in 1985.</TE>
<TE>   Further back, before my memory begins, Maryland football fans
still have Jim Tatum's title team in '51. Because the Senators will
be back pretty soon (knock on wood), we can even throw in the '24
World Series, though it doesn't feel tangible now that the late
Shirley Povich can no longer tell us about Bucky Harris.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, Capitals fans are still waiting, that ultimate cheer
stuck in their throats since 1974. Their visit to the Stanley Cup
finals in '98 was an excellent adventure. But it's just not the same
if you can't put the championship trophy in the lobby, to celebrate
your title.</TE>
<TE>   When Wes Unseld and Elvin Hayes brought the NBA title to town 24
years ago, Washington hadn't had a world title in any pro sport since
the Redskins won their second NFL title of the Sammy Baugh era in
1942--a 36-year wait.</TE>
<TE>   Talk about a town that was ready to party. From Capital Centre to
the District Building, every Bullet rode in the back of his own
convertible, waving to fans who strung the streets for over 10 miles.
There'd be hundreds of fans at an intersection in the middle of
nowhere, waiting to cheer for one minute as Abe Pollin passed.</TE>
<TE>   If feelings about Maryland's win on Monday seem unusually strong,
perhaps it's because we've been in a mini-drought for titles since
the Redskins won their third Super Bowl 11 years ago and D.C. United
sunk two years ago after winning three MLS titles.</TE>
<TE>   Jordan, Jaromir Jagr and Steve Spurrier have come here recently.
However, Gary Williams--who played at Maryland, coached at American
University for four years and has been back at Maryland for a dozen
more seasons --is the first to get us back to the top. After his 20
years of good work here in local sports, plus 34 seasons of coaching,
maybe he deserves it the most.</TE>
<TE>   If Williams has had a long wait, so have countless Maryland fans,
many of whom have invested their time and emotion over decades. "I
saw some of the same faces tonight that I saw in the stands when I
was a player," Williams said long after his team's 64-52 victory over
Indiana. "We've had a core of fans who stuck with us through all the
hard times. I'm especially happy for them."</TE>
<TE>   From 1923 to 1953, Maryland was in the Southern Conference, then
joined the Atlantic Coast Conference in 1953. The NCAA tournament
crowned its first national champion in 1939. That's a lot of
basketball over a lot of years--2,002 Maryland games in all. And
that's a lot of frustration, especially because Maryland's been
serious about having a great team since the day Lefty Driesell
arrived in 1969, a third of a century ago.</TE>
<TE>   So far, Maryland's run to a title has been similar to most of our
other local experiences. A team or franchise finally gets a splendid
core of players with the proper mix of talents, complementary styles
and personal chemistry. Often, that team's time at the top lasts only
a few years. And getting that one crowning moment is difficult.</TE>
<TE>   The Georgetown Hoyas of the early '80s were built around Patrick
Ewing. After he left, there was the Reggie (Williams) and the
Miracles' run in 1987, which ended in the regional finals, and Allen
Iverson's two-year tenure, which included plenty of excitement but
nothing beyond the regional finals. The Bullets got back to the NBA
Finals in '79, but lost. Injuries and age soured their mix. The
Orioles held together a serious contender from '79, when they lost
the Series, until '83, when they finally won it. After that, the
sense of crusade faded.</TE>
<TE>   If Chris Wilcox stays in school next year, joining guards Steve
Blake and Drew Nicholas, and front-court forces Tahj Holden and
Randle, that's an entire starting lineup composed of NCAA champion
veterans. That's rare.</TE>
<TE>   If Maryland, boosted by its title, also has a stellar recruiting
year, then this could be the start of something big. Especially if
Williams continues his recent pattern: As he gets older, he actually
gets better. Still intense on court, he's more comfortable off it,
closer to his players, trusting of senior leaders. "The best part of
coaching," Williams says, "is that you're allowed to improve."</TE>
<TE>   That's for the future. Right now, the present is plenty good
enough. In its 50th ACC season, in its 2,002nd game, Maryland finally
cut down the last net of the basketball season. No matter what comes,
the Terrapins and their fans always will have 2002.</TE>

<HD>France Ready for a Repeat</HD>
<DH>Soccer: With most hands from the 1998 World Cup winner back
on deck, experience is seen as a strong point.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>PARIS</DL>
<LD>France, officially the best soccer team on the planet, must travel a
difficult route to maintain that distinction.</LD>
<LD>   At this year's World Cup in South Korea and Japan, the French will
be missing the home-field advantage that greatly helped them beat
everyone in 1998, including Brazil in the final.</LD>
<LD>   France also has seen almost no competitive action in two years
because it qualified automatically for the World Cup as defending
champion. And one of its key players, attacking midfielder Robert
Pires, is nearly certain to miss the event with a knee injury.</LD>
<TE>   Pessimists might say France's good fortune is about to run out.
But Zinedine Zidane isn't one of them.</TE>
<TE>   "We realize we have a great team and a great chance of winning a
second straight World Cup," the hero of France '98 says. "We don't
fear any opponent."</TE>
<TE>   Only Italy and Brazil have successfully defended World Cup titles.
No nation has won the event more than two consecutive times.</TE>
<TE>   Although "Les Bleus" will be playing far from home, they have some
of the biggest stars from Europe's best clubs. And despite the lack
of competitive pretournament action, the French team is ranked No. 1
in the world and remains one of the most experienced in soccer.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a team that doesn't lose many matches, even away from home,"
says Jean-Jacques Vierne, a soccer writer at the magazine France
Football who has covered the sport for 40 years. "And it's not a team
that's in the process of reconstruction."</TE>
<TE>   As in 1998, two-time FIFA player of the year Zidane is the
centerpiece for France. The 29-year-old midfielder is enjoying an
excellent season at Spanish club Real Madrid, which he joined last
summer in a record $65 million transfer from Italy's Juventus. In
international games, he remains the inspiration for the French
attack.</TE>
<TE>   Other top players include Manchester United goalkeeper Fabien
Barthez, Bayern Munich defender Bixente Lizarazu and the Arsenal trio
of Thierry Henry, Patrick Vieira and Sylvain Wiltord. Juventus
striker David Trezeguet is one of the top scorers in the Italian
league.</TE>
<TE>   Years of playing together for France mean the big names don't
crowd each other out when it comes to international matches.</TE>
<TE>   "If you can't get on with players like Lizarazu and Zidane, you
might as well give up," says Henry, one of France's top strikers.</TE>
<TE>   Arsenal's fourth French international, Pires, tore a knee ligament
in a club match last month and is almost certain to miss the World
Cup. He was a key member of the national team, setting up the goal
that won the 2000 European Championship.</TE>
<TE>   Coach Roger Lemerre overcame the loss by partnering Henry with
Trezeguet in France's 5-0 exhibition win against Scotland. The pair
combined for three goals.</TE>
<TE>   "Before Pires became a major player, we played without him," said
Lemerre, who replaced Aime Jacquet as France's coach after the last
World Cup. "So now we'll use other players with different qualities."</TE>
<TE>   Another possible concern for Lemerre is age: Nine regulars will be
between 30 and 34 by the start of the World Cup on May 31, with
Zidane turning 30 during the competition.</TE>
<TE>   However, many of the older players are on defense, where
experience can make up for loss of speed, and almost all are still at
their peak.</TE>
<TE>   The biggest question mark hangs over 34-year-old midfielder Youri
Djorkaeff. He has 28 goals for France, but spent much of this season
on the bench at Kaiserslautern before moving to English club Bolton.</TE>
<TE>   "Most of the players who are in their 30s are still competitive in
their clubs," Vierne said. "They're not better than they were in
1998, but there's nothing to make us think that these players are in
decline."</TE>
<TE>   And there's no reason the lack of qualifying games should hurt
France any more than in 1998, when it qualified automatically as host
nation. For Vierne, a bigger worry is the gradual shift in focus from
defense to attack since the last World Cup.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a team that sometimes has difficulty realizing that its game
is more offensive than four years ago," Vierne said. "Before, it was
a team where there was only one priority, defense.</TE>
<TE>   "Will it be able to stay in control against Argentina?"</TE>
<TE>   France's defenders are still world class, but a lapse in
concentration nearly saw the team concede a tie in an exhibition
against Romania in February, before the French won 2-1.</TE>
<TE>   That kind of error would cost dearly against a battle-hardened
English team, which France could face as early as the second round of
the World Cup. Argentina, which many consider the tournament
favorite, is a possible semifinals opponent.</TE>
<TE>   France is expected to advance easily through the first round. It
opens against Senegal, a World Cup newcomer, then plays Denmark and
Uruguay.</TE>

<HD>Cochran Tackles Stock Cars</HD>
<DH>Analysis: The attorney prepares a case to challenge NASCAR,
examining claims it is monopolistic.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ED HINTON</AU>
<BD>ORLANDO SENTINEL</BD>
<DL>FORT WORTH</DL>
<LD>NASCAR, the monolithic organization that has controlled stock car
racing in this country for 54 years, is once again under scrutiny.
And the person challenging it is controversial attorney Johnnie L.
Cochran Jr.</LD>
<LD>   Cochran says he has "in excess of 50 lawyers" ready to examine the
practices of NASCAR. At the center of the charges is the claim that
NASCAR engages in "monopolistic" business practices.</LD>
<LD>   A federal lawsuit filed earlier this year on behalf of the
shareholders of Speedway Motorsports Inc., the parent company of
Texas Motor Speedway, claims that NASCAR has a monopoly over
stock-car racing by owning both the governing body and by having
controlling interest in International Speedway Corp., the company
that operates 13 major auto tracks. The suit really is aimed at the
France family, which owns NASCAR.</LD>
<TE>   In the suit, Texas Motor Speedway is asking for a second racing
date, but it's the means to that end that make this case more
interesting.</TE>
<TE>   "The big picture really looks like, and smacks of, anti-trust,"
Cochran said last week. He plans to attend today's race at the
glitzy, $250-million Fort Worth facility. "[NASCAR] needs a second
look, an outside look. It becomes almost incestuous, if you will."</TE>
<TE>   Cochran, who was part of the legal team that gained an acquittal
for O.J. Simpson in his criminal trial, says he's prepared to
initiate legal action that could potentially break up the France
dynasty's iron rule. This suit is only the first step in what could
become a long and expensive affair.</TE>
<TE>   "That [breaking up NASCAR/ISC] is the logical end result, and we
have the legal counsel to do it," Cochran said. "In addition, we have
the resolve."</TE>
<TE>   NASCAR has been no stranger to controversy. Last year's death of
Dale Earnhardt, NASCAR's fourth racing fatality in a nine-month span,
created a firestorm of driver safety issues. NASCAR conducted a
high-profile study of safety and changes were made to try to ensure
greater driver safety.</TE>
<TE>   This suit is about policy and procedure, not people.</TE>
<TE>   Cochran and his partners have invoked the provisions of the
Sherman Anti-Trust Act of 1890 under which high-profile businesses,
from John D. Rockefeller's Standard Oil a century ago to Bill Gates'
modern-day Microsoft, have been sued, and broken up to one degree or
another.</TE>
<TE>   Of the 36 races on the elite Winston Cup tour, 18 are run on ISC
tracks. Of the last four expansion race dates granted by NASCAR,
three have gone to ISC facilities. Of the last five granted, another
date went to California Speedway, which was later acquired by ISC.</TE>
<TE>   Texas Motor Speedway is not owned by ISC and wants a second date.
In fact, if it gets the date, the suit may go away, according to
Cochran. But if the litigation were to go forward, it would lead to a
close examination of the business practices of NASCAR.</TE>
<TE>   The France family has declined to comment on the matter. Mike
Helton, NASCAR president, said the company does not comment on active
litigation. Jim Hunter, NASCAR vice president of communications,
called the suit "absolutely without foundation."</TE>
<TE>   According to Samuel Cherry, the Cochran-firm partner who is
supervising the litigation, damages could reach $1 billion. He said
the lack of a second race at Texas has kept the stock price down.</TE>
<TE>   The suit, filed in U.S. District Court in Sherman, Texas, on Feb.
13 by Speedway Motorsports shareholder Francis Ferko of Plano, Texas,
lists NASCAR, ISC and Speedway Motorsports (SMI) as defendants. Ferko
has declined to comment and referred all questions to his attorneys.</TE>
<TE>   SMI is only a "nominal defendant," according to the suit. SMI was
named so that its executives can be kept informed of all aspects of
the case.</TE>
<TE>   "The anti-trust allegations illustrate how there is no other
remedy for Speedway Motorsports," Cherry said. "They just can't
create a second event, a NASCAR-formatted race, of their own. It's
impossible."</TE>
<TE>   That's because, according to the filing, "NASCAR has illegally
maintained a monopoly in the market for the provision of the right to
host a premier NASCAR-formatted stock-car race."</TE>
<TE>   The suit further alleges that NASCAR has cornered the market on
the best drivers and teams involved in stock car racing, in part by
creating the Winston Cup points system so that drivers must
participate to win the most lucrative season championship in American
motor racing.</TE>
<TE>   And "NASCAR has deterred drivers and their teams" from competing
in non-NASCAR events, the suit claims, by "[causing] drivers to fear"
that they could be targets of reprisal at NASCAR races, in the form
of fines or other penalties over technical inspection of cars and
driver behavior.</TE>
<TE>   Cherry says he plans to use Bill France Jr.'s comments at a recent
meeting of ISC stock holders to his advantage. France Jr. reportedly
said that ISC was "uniquely positioned to take advantage of the
growth of NASCAR."</TE>
<TE>   Cherry believes that statement helps prove his case. "Sure they
are [positioned]. That's because of the incestuous relationship that
exists between ISC and NASCAR. They're the ones handing out the
dates."</TE>
<TE>   Bruton Smith, the SMI chairman who controls six tracks on the
Winston Cup circuit including Texas Motor Speedway, finds himself in
the middle. He sees the suit as having the potential to shake NASCAR
to its roots.</TE>
<TE>   "I can see that occurring," Smith said. "Anybody who's been in
this [auto racing] as long as I have [nearly 50 years], I think we
all look at NASCAR and ISC as one and the same. Same management, same
ownership, same ol' same ol'."</TE>
<TE>   Smith bought the existent date at Texas.</TE>
<TE>   It started in 1996 when he purchased half-interest in tiny North
Wilkesboro (N.C.) Speedway, which by tradition hosted two Cup races a
year. Smith tried to acquire all of the old track, but lost one-half
in the bidding to New Hampshire International Speedway owner Bob
Bahre.</TE>
<TE>   About all the two strange-bedfellow tycoons could agree on about
Wilkesboro was to shut it down. Smith moved one of the Cup dates to
Texas, and Bahre, a friend and ally of the France family, took the
other to create a second race annually at New Hampshire.</TE>
<TE>   "We spent a quarter of a billion dollars building that big
monster," Smith says of the Texas track. "I think it was perceived by
everybody that that big monster could only make it if we had the two
dates."</TE>
<TE>   NASCAR in recent years has awarded only one expansion Cup race per
season to newly constructed tracks, because the Winston Cup schedule
that runs from February through November is already overcrowded.</TE>
<TE>   Smith, and many of his stockholders, have argued for the last five
years that since he bought one date, he is still owed an expansion
date for Texas.</TE>
<TE>   Historically, NASCAR and ISC have met legal challenges with their
own armies of lawyers and have rarely lost.</TE>
<TE>   Cochran, however, doesn't view the action as an attempt to destroy
NASCAR racing, but to improve it.</TE>
<TE>   "If it goes far enough," he says, "it's going to be of benefit to
NASCAR [including member drivers and teams] and the public."</TE>

<HD>Augusta Has a Growth Spurt</HD>
<DH>Golf: It will be a radically different course the Masters
field will face this week at the year's first major.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>AUGUSTA, Ga.</DL>
<LD>The green jacket Tiger Woods slipped over his shoulders after winning
his first Masters was a size 42 long. It was a loose fit for the
21-year-old champion, but that was by design.</LD>
<LD>   "A lot of the guys say they get larger as they get older," Woods
said.</LD>
<LD>   The same holds true for Augusta National Golf Club.</LD>
<TE>   About a month after Woods walked away from the Masters with his
fourth straight major championship, the bulldozers moved in. Half of
the 18 holes were lengthened. Bunkers were stretched and deepened.
Tees were shifted to sharpen the doglegs.</TE>
<TE>   The result?</TE>
<TE>   A golf course built 70 years ago on a former nursery is all grown
up.</TE>
<TE>   "Every year, you always see small adjustments," two-time Masters
champion Ben Crenshaw said. "This year, we're in for something
entirely different."</TE>
<TE>   Woods is the defending champion when the 66th Masters begins this
week. Jack Nicklaus has a bad back and will not play for only the
second time in 44 years. Greg Norman has been offered another chance
at a green jacket. Phil Mickelson still hasn't won a major.</TE>
<TE>   Everything else about this year's Masters is uncertain. The
anticipation building for this year's tournament is not so much who
will win, but how.</TE>
<TE>   "You've got to really play well now to break 70," Ernie Els said.
"If we have a little bit of weather come through ... you could see
even par winning if it's really tough."</TE>
<TE>   Augusta still blends the majestic beauty of its azaleas and
dogwoods with the most frightening putting surfaces on earth, so
slick and severe that sometimes a player has to putt with his back to
the hole if he winds up in the wrong spot.</TE>
<TE>   Now, imagine trying to hit into those contoured greens with longer
clubs.</TE>
<TE>   "If I hit a good drive, I had a wedge to a front pin. Now it's a
6-iron, so that should tell you something," former Masters champion
Vijay Singh said about No. 11, already one of the toughest par 4s at
Augusta before an extra 35 yards stretched it to 490 yards.</TE>
<TE>   The fairway bunkers on Nos. 1 and 18 were nothing more than a
nuisance for the big hitters. Now, getting over them requires a drive
that goes more than 300 yards in the air.</TE>
<TE>   The most significant change might be No. 18, where the options off
the tee on the uphill, 465-yard hole are simple--stay away from the
double bunker on the left side, without getting too close to the pine
trees on the right side.</TE>
<TE>   No wonder Woods thinks the course will play one or two shots
harder--worse if there is a lot of wind, and there usually is at
Augusta.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think the scores will be as low," Woods said. "Instead of
making birdies and eagles on a lot of the holes, I think what you're
going to find is par can be a good score."</TE>
<TE>   Woods set the 72-hole record in the Masters when he won in 1997 at
18-under-par 270, despite a 40 on his opening nine holes. He
completed his own version of the Grand Slam last year at 272 to
defeat David Duval and Mickelson.</TE>
<TE>   Despite only one victory this year, Woods will be the favorite to
win his third green jacket and join Jack Nicklaus and Nick Faldo as
the only repeat champions of the Masters.</TE>
<TE>   As for the other favorites, some believe the list is short.</TE>
<TE>   "If you're not considered a long hitter, you've got no chance -- I
mean, no chance," Stuart Appleby of Australia said. "Otherwise, you'd
have to be almost perfect, and Augusta doesn't let you stay perfect
for four days."</TE>
<TE>   Change this drastic at Augusta National was inevitable.</TE>
<TE>   Players have become more athletic. They get better training at a
younger age. Combine that with rapid advances in equipment (balls,
clubs, shafts), and club chairman Hootie Johnson said he believed the
course had no option but to get longer, stronger, tougher.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson was at Amen Corner last year when Mickelson hit a tee shot
on the 455-yard 11th hole that stopped rolling next to a sprinkler.
He ducked under the ropes to check the yardage on the sprinkler and
found Mickelson had only 94 yards left to the green.</TE>
<TE>   The final straw was the final swing by Woods--a lob wedge from 75
yards away.</TE>
<TE>   Still, this isn't about "Tiger-proofing" the golf course. When
asked if Augusta National would look like this if Woods had taken up
a different sport, Johnson didn't hesitate.</TE>
<TE>   "The game called for the changes," Johnson said. "It wasn't Tiger
Woods. I told Tiger when he was here, 'We're doing this for the young
boys.' They're hitting the ball, all of them, over 300 yards."</TE>
<TE>   That leads many to wonder whether the short knockers stand a
chance. Crenshaw is among those who believe only a select group of
players can seriously contend.</TE>
<TE>   Still, one myth about the Masters is that the course is suited for
big hitters. Length never hurts, but it didn't stop Bernhard Langer
(twice), Jose Maria Olazabal (twice), Nick Faldo (three times) or
Mark O'Meara from winning.</TE>
<TE>   "It really doesn't matter if you're long or short at Augusta,"
Woods said. "Whoever is playing well is going to be in contention.
The long hitters do have an advantage on the par 5s because they can
get there in two. But they've still got to putt."</TE>
<TE>   Augusta National should test every skill from opening tee shot to
the final approach. The premium is on driving, ball-striking, short
game, putting and--always-- hinking.</TE>
<TE>   "I always thought the Masters was the toughest mentally, because
there's always such a fine line between success and failure on every
shot," Stewart Cink said. "You're riding the knife's edge on every
single shot."</TE>
<TE>   The greatest change of all could be the fireworks on the back nine
Sunday at Augusta, where Nicklaus shot a 30 in 1986 to claim his
sixth green jacket, and where Norman had a 40 during his horrific
meltdown 10 years later.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, the premium might be on par, just like in a U.S. Open,
which is regarded as the toughest test in golf.</TE>

<HD>It's Just the Beginning for Yagudin</HD>
<DH>Figure skating: Olympic champion is ready to embrace his
role as a leader and role model, with an ambitious schedule for 2002.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Coming off perhaps the greatest year any male figure skater has had,
Alexei Yagudin is just getting started.</LD>
<LD>   In the afterglow of a season that brought victory in every major
competition, including Olympic gold and his fourth world
championship, Yagudin has no thoughts of leaving competitive skating.
He plans to spend more time than ever on the ice this summer on three
tours, then compete in Skate America and Skate Canada during the
fall.</LD>
<LD>   Beyond that, he is not making any commitments, although it sounds
as if the major events--the Grand Prix final in his native Russia and
worlds in Washington--remain very enticing.</LD>
<TE>   Yagudin, 22, laughs when told he sounds just like U.S. skating
icon Michelle Kwan, who also expects to remain Olympic eligible--at
least for the near future.</TE>
<TE>   "I just want to do my job and it is really great that I like my
job so much and what I am doing," Yagudin says. "Michelle also has
been a four-time world champion, and I can understand how she is
still competing and fighting. Sometimes you have got everything and
it doesn't matter. She still pushes on. So do I.</TE>
<TE>   "At some time, you realize you have everything in skating, and now
you must skate for the people and take that role more seriously. That
is how I feel."</TE>
<TE>   Just a few years ago, Yagudin was considered something of a rebel.
He even was thrown off the Champions on Ice tour by promoter Tom
Collins after the skater made off-color remarks to a security guard
at a show in New York, then offended a reporter in Denver.</TE>
<TE>   But Yagudin has grown up and grown into the world's most popular
men's skater. He not only will return to and headline Collins' tour,
he is on the Skate The Nation and Stars on Ice shows in Canada.</TE>
<TE>   He has impressed everyone with his maturity and versatility, both
characteristics that defined his unbeaten season.</TE>
<TE>   "He has a great quality," says 1988 Olympic champion Brian
Boitano. "He moves across the ice very effortlessly--he almost floats
on top of it. He is very talented and well-rounded."</TE>
<TE>   Yagudin is taking his status quite seriously. Unlike his
predecessors as Olympic champion, Alexei Urmanov and Ilia Kulik, who
quickly disappeared from the competitive scene, Yagudin understands
he is the leader of a highly skilled generation that appears ready to
stretch the boundaries of the sport.</TE>
<TE>   He talks about performing once-outlandish moves such as a
quadruple axel or even a quad-quad combination. He wants to expand
his musical horizons, perhaps incorporating hip-hop and other modern
pieces, not using just classical themes.</TE>
<TE>   And he embraces the responsibility of his position atop the
skating world.</TE>
<TE>   "Of course, I am more popular now because of I won the Olympics,"
says the third straight Russian gold medalist. "I want to skate and
not disappoint people for the competitions and the shows on tour. I
know it will be more serious off the ice, more responsibility as a
skater, and I look forward to it. I am the way I am and I will not
change myself because of the Olympic gold."</TE>
<TE>   Yagudin, who also is about to write his autobiography, doesn't
expect to have time to change his programs for next season. Of
course, the way he skated to "Winter" for his short program and "The
Man in the Iron Mask" for his free skate, why alter anything?</TE>
<TE>   Drastic change was necessary heading into the Olympic season.
Yagudin was coming off a miserable year in which he had back and leg
injuries and was surpassed by countryman and rival Evgeny Plushenko.
When Yagudin finished a weak third at the Goodwill Games last summer,
he knew extreme measures were in order.</TE>
<TE>   That included losing nearly 20 pounds as part of a rigorous
training regimen, and rededicating himself to his sport.</TE>
<TE>   "The year before was like hell for me," he says. "I felt I was
doing everything, but I couldn't get it the way I wanted for the
competition. Even if I skated good, the practices were not great.</TE>
<TE>   "After Goodwill Games, I worked more and became more concentrated
on skating. I realized you can't be perfect all the time, that there
are good and bad parts of your life and you have to pass that bad
time. It was a test to see how you handle the pressure and losing the
world title.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd been on top of the world for three years and it's hard to
handle that, with all the people expecting you to skate good all the
time. You are human and sometimes do mistakes. The best way to handle
it is not to change yourself."</TE>
<TE>   For now, it's time to enjoy the rewards of a very special year.</TE>
<TE>   "That is why I was working to get the Olympic title," he says. "It
all pays off. You have a dinner and you get the dessert at the end. I
am getting the dessert."</TE>

<LD>Programs such as "One Book, One Chicago" and "If All Seattle Read,"
in which entire cities are encouraged to read the same piece of
literature at the same time, have spread from coast to coast. From
Providence, R.I., to Honolulu, cities have plans for their
populations to take the time to read the same book.</LD>
<LD>   Some groups of literary enthusiasts are taking their love a step
further and devoting vacation time to opening their minds through
study, thought and discussion. No Danielle Steel or fluffy "beach
books" on these trips. Participants are more likely to delve into the
classics, ancient (Homer's "Odyssey") and modern (Virginia Woolf's "A
Room of One's Own"), or to join a lively discussion of the history of
U.S. foreign policy.</LD>
<LD>   This summer you have a range of brain-based vacations to choose
from, and most options will cost less than a week at a crowded beach
resort. Here are a few possibilities:</LD>
<TE>   Each August, Colby College of Waterville, Maine, plays host to a
Great Books Summer Institute, an intensive analysis of four
outstanding books that participants have read before arrival. This
year's session is Aug. 4 to 10; the fee is $475 per person, single or
double occupancy, including dormitory lodging and all meals (one of
them a Maine lobster bake), tuition and books. This summer's theme is
"Live and Learn," and it features works such as Shakespeare's "Henry
IV: Parts I and II" and "The Pupil," by Henry James. For information,
contact Colby Summer Institute, 824 Thomas Road, Lafayette Hill, PA
19444-1107; (215) 836-2380, fax (215) 836-7158,
www.dol.net/~greatbooks/colby.htm.</TE>
<TE>   St. John's College of Santa Fe, N.M., is a stalwart guardian of
the classics. Small humanities seminars that trace the great writers
and thinkers throughout history are required classes in all four
undergraduate years. Each summer, St. John's re-creates this intense
seminar experience for visiting adults of all ages in its Summer
Classics program, consisting of three one-week sessions in July and
early August.</TE>
<TE>   This summer there will be discussions of works by Virgil and
Plato, as well as texts from the 20th century, such as William
Faulkner's "Go Down, Moses." A week's tuition is $800, which includes
registration, books, lunches and some excursions. Room and full board
at campus dorms cost $475 per week, or you could splurge and stay at
a hotel in town. For information, contact Summer Classics, St. John's
College, 1160 Camino Cruz Blanca, Santa Fe, NM 87505-4599; (505)
984-6104, fax (505) 984-6003, www.sjcsf.edu/classics/classic.htm.</TE>
<TE>   Ann Kirkland attended three summer sessions of the St. John's
program and was so impressed that in 1998 she launched a similar
Classical Pursuits program at St. Michael's College, University of
Toronto, where she is a resident professor.</TE>
<TE>   The 2002 session is scheduled for July 7 to 13. Participants can
choose one of 10 seminars, including Geoffrey Chaucer's "The
Canterbury Tales" and Thomas Mann's "Dr. Faustus." Classes have 15
people maximum, so there is plenty of opportunity to voice your
thoughts and to get to know classmates.</TE>
<TE>   The program price for the week is about $635. That rate includes
enrollment in one seminar, lunches, receptions and some excursions,
but not lodging. For singles, the most affordable place to stay is on
campus in single rooms with shared bath, for about $210 for the week;
that price includes a hot breakfast every morning. If you want a
private bathroom, try the Bay Bloor Executive Suites near campus,
(800) 263-2811, fax (416) 968-7385, www.baybloorexec.com, where one
or two people will pay about $395 for those six nights (or about $450
for a suite with separate bedroom). For more information about St.
Michael's Classical Pursuits program, contact St. Michael's College,
Continuing Education, 81 St. Mary St., Toronto, Ontario, Canada M5S
1J4; (877) 633-2555, fax (416) 693-4157,
www.utoronto.ca/classicalpursuits.</TE>
<TE>   There are also shorter trips for people who can spare no more than
a weekend to indulge their bookish side. The Great Books Foundation
helps organize short, reasonably priced discussion seminars around
the country every year. A late June program at Western Washington
University in Bellingham, Wash., costs as little as $160 for two
nights' accommodations, six meals, all your books and a
Saturday-night social. Single-night "mini-retreats" are held at other
locations on scattered dates. Look up the Great Books Foundation on
the Web at www.greatbooks.org or call (800) 222-5870 to find out
more.</TE>
<TE>   Study vacations are not limited to literature. Many universities
open their doors each summer to inquisitive minds of all kinds and
ages. You'll find one of the best summer programs in Ithaca, N.Y., at
Cornell's Adult University in July and August. In each of four
one-week sessions, about 150 to 200 adults live on campus and attend
a variety of classes, such as "Ethics in Modern Warfare,"
"Introduction to Fly Fishing," "Web Page Design Studio" and "The Wine
Class." The price is $960 or $1,020 per week, per adult based on
double occupancy, including tuition and full room and board ($580 for
tuition only). A range of children's programs, from day care for
infants to outdoor and educational programs for teenagers, is also
available, priced from $366 to $526 per child. Contact Cornell's
Adult University, 626 Thurston Ave., Box W, Ithaca, NY 14850-2490;
(607) 255-6260, fax (607) 254-4482, www.sce.cornell.edu/CAU.</TE>

<LD>Between the 1930s and '50s, cruising the Great Lakes was a popular
summer holiday. A close-to-home vacation coupled with cool lake
breezes appealed to Americans, but as cruising expanded into the
Caribbean and Alaska and air travel became easier, the demand for a
Great Lakes cruise declined.</LD>
<LD>   Now Great Lakes cruising is coming back, not so much as a result
of Sept. 11 but because American and European cruise companies have
recognized its appeal. American Canadian Caribbean Line, based in
Warren, R.I., has been sailing the Great Lakes for a decade or more,
and European ships represented by Great Lakes Cruise Co., a
Michigan-based cruise operator chartering Canadian-flag and
European-owned small cruise vessels, have been sailing the lakes
since 1999. Both are offering summer sailings in Lakes Superior,
Michigan, Huron, Erie and Ontario.</LD>
<LD>   Great Lakes Cruise will operate three vessels this summer and
early fall: the 95-passenger Le Levant, sailing from Chicago to
Toronto for eight nights beginning June 18; the 18-passenger Georgian
Clipper, which will cruise Canada's 30,000 Islands in Georgian Bay
off Lake Huron for six-night sailings from June 16 to Aug. 28; and
the 420-passenger Columbus, sailing four itineraries that include
parts of all five lakes plus Georgian Bay in September.</LD>
<TE>   American Canadian's 100-passenger Grande Mariner sails on Lake
Michigan round trip from Chicago on six-night itineraries departing
July 9 and Aug. 18, plus some Erie Canal and foliage cruises in late
August, September and early October. This small, simple
American-flagged vessel has an American captain and crew and a
bring-your-own-bar policy. (Ice and setups are provided.) No liquor
is sold on board, but soft drinks are included in the fare. Smoking
is not permitted in the cabins or public rooms, only on outside
decks.</TE>
<TE>   Dress is casual, and passengers may sit where they wish at
single-seating meals. Gratuities, port charges and shore excursions
are not included. The six-night cruises round trip from Chicago are
priced from $1,315 per person, double occupancy. The lowest-priced
cabins are inside, windowless or with a small porthole. Cabins with
windows begin at $1,455 per person, double. Passengers younger than
14 are not permitted.</TE>
<TE>   Le Levant, the most luxurious of the vessels, travels on all Great
Lakes on its eight-night sailing from Chicago to Toronto. Fares begin
at $3,850 per person, double occupancy, for an outside stateroom with
marble bath and shower. All shore excursions, shipboard gratuities,
transfers, lunch and dinner wines, port charges and lectures are
included.</TE>
<TE>   The French-built vessel, which debuted in 1998, has sleek
yacht-like lines, with generous deck space, a small swimming pool and
a spa pool, a hair salon, library, elevator, infirmary and hospital,
steam room, sports center, two restaurants and indoor and outdoor
bars. The crew and cuisine are French.</TE>
<TE>   The itinerary includes an overnight at the Chicago
Inter-Continental with half a day sightseeing. Passengers board June
19 and begin daily ports of call the next day.</TE>
<TE>   Stops include Sturgeon Bay in Wisconsin's Door County on Lake
Michigan; Michigan's Mackinac Island; Whitefish Point in Lake
Superior; Little Current, Ontario, near the mouth of Georgian Bay;
Port Huron on Lake Huron; Windsor and Detroit on Lake Erie; and
Welland Canal for Niagara Falls, arriving June 26 in Toronto. The
cruise will feature reports from a Great Lakes shipwreck excursion.
Divers will transmit audio and video to the ship from an underwater
vehicle operated by remote control.</TE>
<TE>   The 420-passenger Columbus, built in Germany in 1997, is the
largest vessel offering such trips this summer. Officers and crew are
European and international. All passengers dine at a single seating
in the restaurant, and buffet breakfasts and lunches are also
available in the Palm Garden on the top deck. Smoking is permitted
only in cabins and on deck; public rooms are smoke-free.</TE>
<TE>   Fares begin at $1,595 per person, double occupancy, for an inside
cabin on a seven-night cruise. Those on a tight budget can book a
cabin that sleeps four for $995 per person on the seven-night
packages, $760 each on the five-night packages. Suites range from
$2,550 to $4,415 per person, double occupancy. Single passengers pay
$2,995 for the seven-night program, $2,065 for the five-night tour
when booking one of the two designated single cabins. Or the line
will assign a roommate. If none has been found by June 7, the single
will pay 150% of the per-person, double occupancy, rate.</TE>
<TE>   The fare includes an overnight hotel stay in the city of
embarkation, transfer from hotel to ship, lectures and, for
passengers who book inside cabins, one free shore excursion.</TE>
<TE>   Airport transfers, shore excursions and alcoholic
beverages--except for welcome aboard and farewell cocktail
parties--are extra.</TE>
<TE>   The seven-night itineraries begin Sept. 4 with an overnight on
land in Toronto, then calls at Welland Canal for Niagara Falls;
Little Current, Ontario; and Sault Ste. Marie and Mackinac Island
before arriving Sept. 11 in Port Huron.</TE>
<TE>   The Sept. 10 program begins with an overnight on land in Port
Huron, a call in Little Current, then Door County, Sault Ste. Marie,
Marquette and Mackinac Island.</TE>
<TE>   Sept. 16 begins with an overnight on land, then the same itinerary
as Sept. 10. The five-night package starts with a Sept. 22 overnight
on land in Port Huron, then visits Little Current, Sault Ste. Marie
and Mackinac Island before returning to Port Huron Sept. 27.</TE>
<TE>   Grande Mariner cruises will begin in Chicago, then travel on to
Holland, Manistee, Mackinac Island and Sturgeon Bay in Michigan, and
Milwaukee.</TE>
<TE>   The tiny Georgian Clipper sails every sixth day round trip from
Parry Sound on Ontario's Georgian Bay and visits Britt, Killarney,
Kagawong, Killarney again and Pointe au Baril on its cruise around
the 30,000 Islands. Cabins are small, with a window, two lower beds
and bath with washbasin, toilet and shower. The dining room seats all
passengers at once, and a Canadian crew of six provides service.</TE>
<TE>   It has a well-stocked bar and a main salon with entertainment

<HD>Floating Condo Project Says Ahoy to the Affluent</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Compiled by Jane Engle</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>What has been dubbed the world's first floating condo finally set
sail from Oslo March 29 after numerous delays.</LD>
<LD>   About 80% of the World of ResidenSea's 110 luxury residences,
priced at $2.25 million and up, have been sold since they went on the
market about five years ago, said Lisa M. Bailey, spokeswoman for
Bahamas-based ResidenSea Ltd., which operates the 43,000-gross-ton
vessel. The ship is designed to perpetually sail the globe, carrying
its well-heeled homeowners plus 88 guest suites. It includes several
restaurants, two pools, putting greens and more.</LD>
<LD>   Most homeowners are treating the condos like second homes,
however, Bailey said. So starting May 2, the condos are available for
lease, along with the guest suites. Under a special package this
year, available for five-day segments, the residences go for $1,400
per apartment per day, and the suites start at $500 per person per
day, double occupancy. The suite price includes on-board meals and
beverages; the residence price does not.</LD>
<TE>   The launch date for the ship was initially announced for 2000.
Last summer the owners ended a contract with Silversea Cruises to
market the guest suites and began marketing them on their own, Bailey
said. (800) 970-6601, www.residensea.com.</TE>

<HD>Northwest Changes Cutoff Time for Check-in</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Compiled by Jane Engle</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Starting this weekend Northwest Airlines began requiring passengers
to check in earlier for domestic flights.</LD>
<LD>   Domestic passengers generally have to be checked in and at the
gate at least 15 minutes before departure, compared with 10 minutes
under the old policy, or risk losing their seat. The exception is for
flights to and from Hawaii, for which check-in cutoffs were changed
from 60 minutes to 30 minutes. Cutoffs for international check-ins,
mostly set at 60 minutes, are unchanged. The airline is still
advising passengers to arrive at the airport 75 minutes before
domestic departures, two hours before international departures.</LD>
<LD>   Also starting this weekend, Northwest is requiring passengers to
check luggage at least 30 minutes before domestic departures;
previously the cutoff varied by airport. International cutoffs,
generally 60 minutes, are unchanged.</LD>

<HD>Student Travel Agency Takes Over U.S. Rival</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Compiled by Jane Engle</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The student travel agency STA Travel last week acquired the offices
of its former rival, New York-based Council Travel, which filed for
bankruptcy protection in February. The court-approved acquisition
makes STA the largest student travel agency in the U.S., said
Nicholas Thomas, Los Angeles-based president of STA Travel North
America.</LD>
<LD>   Thomas said STA would absorb most of Council Travel's 400 staff
members and continue to operate most of the former agency's more than
70 branches. Among the few to be closed are one in Westwood and
another in Santa Monica because STA already has offices there, at 920
Westwood Blvd. and 411 Santa Monica Blvd., Thomas said. STA now has
130 offices in the U.S. and more than 400 worldwide.</LD>
<LD>   Council Travel was once the largest student travel agency in the
U.S. It filed for Chapter 11 reorganization after its parent company,
USIT World in Ireland, which reportedly was struggling under millions
of dollars of debt, filed a similar action in January.</LD>

<HD>DOT Fines Internet Sellers Over Travel Fees</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Compiled by Jane Engle</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two Internet travel sellers were fined last month by the U.S.
Department of Transportation over how they displayed taxes and other
charges.</LD>
<LD>   The DOT said www.travelocity.com omitted some taxes and fees in
initial displays of airline fares although it did display them when
the purchaser prepared to book the flights. It also said so-called
fuel surcharges, which airlines add to fares, were not properly
displayed in "Best Fare Finder" searches. "We thought the way we were
doing this was in compliance with the rules," a Travelocity spokesman
said, adding that there was no intent to deceive customers and that
the site has changed its displays. The company was fined $50,000.</LD>
<LD>   The DOT said that in advertising travel packages, www.site59.com
failed to mention that fees and taxes would be added to the listed
prices. A spokeswoman for Site59, which specializes in last-minute
bookings and was recently bought by Travelocity, called it a
"technical violation" and said taxes and fees were displayed before
purchase. The company was fined $40,000.</LD>

<HD>National Mall Welcomes a New Guy on the Bench</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU>Compiled by Jane Engle</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Starting Tuesday, visitors to the National Mall in Washington, D.C.,
will encounter a new fixture: the George Mason National Memorial.</LD>
<LD>   Occupying about two acres along Ohio Drive near the 14th Street
Bridge and the Jefferson Memorial, it honors the man who wrote the
Virginia Declaration of Rights in 1776, which asserted "that all men
are by nature equally free and independent and have certain inherent
rights...." The concepts were incorporated into the Declaration of
Independence.</LD>
<LD>   The memorial, financed by more than $2 million in mostly private
funds, consists mainly of gardens. Its focus is a statue of Mason
(1725-1792) seated on a bench, done by artist Wendy M. Ross.
Organizers say it is the first National Mall memorial dedicated to an
individual American who did not serve as president. (The Vietnam War
Memorial, for instance, honors many individuals.)</LD>

Sept. 7, via the Channel Tunnel with one stop, at Ashford in Kent.
Advance purchase round-trip fares start at $188.... A slump in
American tourists visiting New Zealand since the Sept. 11 terrorist
attacks has torpedoed a venture offering mini-submarine tours of a
scenic fiord, the Associated Press reported. Submarines Australasia

<DL></DL>
<LD>In a vaguely worded public announcement, the State Department on
March 27 alerted Americans of a "possible threat" from terrorists in
the Italian cities of Venice, Florence, Milan and Verona. It urged
travelers to "increase their security awareness and avoid large
crowds." The announcement expires April 25.</LD>
<LD>   Other department announcements the same week urged caution in East
Timor in Indonesia because of crime and security problems; northern
Ghana because of ethnic clashes; and the Indian state of Gujarat and
the Ayodhya area in Uttar Pradesh because of communal unrest.</LD>
<LD>   The State Department has a new toll-free phone number, (888)
407-4747, for updates on travel advisories. The phone is answered 8
a.m. to 8 p.m. EST, Monday through Friday, except U.S. holidays. The
information is also available on the Internet at www.travel.state.gov

<KH>Weekend Escape</KH>
<HD>In Sin City, a Spot Worth Coveting</HD>
<DH>The hip Palms resort and splendid art top a tour of Las
Vegas' newest sights.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TOM GORMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>LAS VEGAS</DL>
<LD>The new Palms resort boldly hypes itself as Las Vegas' sex- iest
adult playground--a way-cool, celebrity-studded, off-Strip boutique
hotel and gambling joint. It's a big boast in a town that calls
itself Sin City.</LD>
<LD>   My wife and I decided to find out for ourselves, making the
4-month-old Palms our anchor for a weekend of classy food, high-class
art and classic rock 'n' roll.</LD>
<LD>   For context, know that Jeanne and I are a combined 100 years old,
enjoyed Liberace when he performed at the Las Vegas Hilton, and a
year ago paid to see Wayne Newton--and actually liked him.</LD>
<TE>   For our getaway last month, we booked a standard room a few weeks
in advance at $159 a night plus tax. But Vegas hotel rates fluctuate
almost daily, and the night before our arrival, I noticed prices had
dropped to $139. A Palms clerk cheerfully adjusted our rate.</TE>
<TE>   After a smooth Friday evening check-in, we were in our supposedly
"oversized guest room" with "extraordinary views of the world-famous
Las Vegas Strip."</TE>
<TE>   Well, not quite. The room felt cramped, and while we could see the
Strip a few blocks away, our view was mostly the glare from the
building's exterior floodlights. In fact, at bedtime we had to push
two chairs against the curtains to cut the amount of light pouring
in.</TE>
<TE>   A large armoire held a 27-inch TV and a mini-bar. (Be advised: If
you take a beer out of the fridge to make room for dinner leftovers,
a computer will detect the motion and charge you for the beer. Call
the front desk to have the charge removed.) The bathroom was nicely
appointed but surprisingly dark, and as we competed for the same sink
and mirror, we wished the vanity were larger.</TE>
<TE>   Then we were off to dinner at Nine, an offshoot of a popular
Chicago steakhouse. The walls are spare, the room done in silver and
black, and the center occupied by a caviar bar beneath a vaulted
ceiling illuminated in soft lavender light. Jeanne thought it a
pleasant, spaceship ambience. It was as noisy as an engine room, too,
with conversations competing with canned music heavy on the bass. Am
I sounding crotchety?</TE>
<TE>   We were won over, however, by a fine dinner. Jeanne started with
lobster bisque poured around a spring roll; I had a Caesar salad. We
both chose filets, done perfectly, and shared two sides, sauteed
spinach with caramelized garlic and a "Yukon gold potato puree
trio"--twice-baked potatoes to you and me--each topped with lobster,
horseradish or caramelized onions.</TE>
<TE>   We capped the evening at Ghost Bar and its open-air balcony on the
Palms' 55th floor, as famous for who's seen inside as for the view
that can be seen outside. The cover charge on weekends is $20, but
the hostess at Nine (who didn't know I was a reporter) phoned our
names upstairs and we slipped in for free.</TE>
<TE>   Inside a chrome-and-glass room with undulating couches apparently
taken from the Jetsons' home, the sport is people-watching. The DJ's
selections included the Beatles, hard rock and something he called
electro jazz.</TE>
<TE>   Because we're 100, we didn't stay long.</TE>
<TE>   We strolled around the casino and found it lacking distinctive
features. It has a sports book, a poker room, plenty of the newest
slot machines and blackjack tables covered in lime-green felt. The
ceiling created an industrial ambience, highlighted by what looked
like burlap-covered turbine blades. Tropical meets techno.</TE>
<TE>   Saturday was more to our taste, far from the cacophony of casinos.
We headed first to Steve and Elaine Wynn's art gallery, the Wynn
Collection, at what had been the Desert Inn. Wynn, who introduced
fine art to Las Vegas when he built the Bellagio, continues to grace
the community with masterworks, including Picasso's "Le Reve" (The
Dream), for which he has named his next casino, soon to be under
construction at this site. We don't know what Wynn paid for the
painting, but the previous time it sold at auction, it went for more
than $40 million.</TE>
<TE>   The gallery is unpretentious, with 13 works by Cezanne, Gauguin,
Manet, Matisse, Modigliani, Van Gogh and Andy Warhol (a portrait of
Wynn). Listen to Wynn's recorded commentary and you'll learn a few
things--and laugh too.</TE>
<TE>   While you're there, examine the pattern of the rug, then the
background of "Le Reve," and ask yourself whether the similarities
are just coincidence or reflect Wynn's subtle fun with interior
decorating.</TE>
<TE>   We drove a couple of blocks to the Venetian to view the Guggenheim
Hermitage Museum's inaugural show, "Masterpieces and Master
Collectors." It is the historic collaboration between the Guggenheim
Museum in New York and the State Hermitage Museum of Russia, the show
unabashedly situated in Las Vegas so that the masses can enjoy the
masters.</TE>
<TE>   The 44 pieces included works by Pissarro, Gauguin and Picasso that
have been held in St. Petersburg and never before viewed in the
United States. The bright gallery, designed by architect Rem
Koolhaas, is itself spectacular: The paintings hang by magnets on
rust-colored, Cor-Ten steel walls that look almost velvety.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike Wynn's gallery, where a tour includes recorded commentary,
the Guggenheim Hermitage folks charge extra for audio accompaniment
that's not as detailed.</TE>
<TE>   We almost lost ourselves in the splendid richness of the art, but
every time the exit door opened, we could hear the electronic pings
and beeps of slot machines.</TE>
<TE>   In its own way, dinner Saturday was also a masterpiece. We had
reservations for Rosemary's, an off-Strip restaurant that has
received abundant accolades.</TE>
<TE>   Jeanne selected the butternut squash soup and rack of lamb with
black-olive mashed potatoes. I chose a salad of carpaccio, Maytag
Blue cheese, apples and candied walnuts drizzled with port, and the
night's entree special, tasso-crusted Chilean sea bass with green
onion creamed potatoes. Throughout the meal, the chef dispatched
appetizers and sweets to our table and others. For dessert we shared
a slice of lemon icebox pie. The service was sharp and graceful, and
the meal simply one of the finest we have had.</TE>
<TE>   Saturday night closed with a Vegas cliche: "Legends in Concert" at
the Imperial Palace, with look-alike performers mimicking Tom Jones,
Tina Turner, Michael Jackson, Celine Dion, the Temptations and Elvis.
(We had picked up $3-off coupons, which are available all over town
and on the Imperial Palace Web site.) The show was fun, even without
a Liberace.</TE>
<TE>   Returning to our room late Saturday, we weaved and cut through a
young, pulsating casino crowd on the prowl, many of them queuing up
for entrance into the Palms' nightclub, Rain. We now know what our
daughter wears when she goes to clubs. Lord have mercy.</TE>
<TE>   After checkout Sunday, we went to the most opulent of the Strip
casinos, the Bellagio, for its decadent Sunday brunch buffet: prime
rib, sushi, shrimp, an extensive pasta and salad bar, eggs Benedict,
omelets, Chinese food, Mexican food, even "braised guinea fowl legs."
Champagne was free-flowing--and good.</TE>
<TE>   For all the offerings that have made the Bellagio buffet popular,
I was smitten by the cereal bar, where you build your own granola mix
of nuts, seeds and dried fruit.</TE>
<TE>   We closed our weekend at the Bellagio Gallery of Fine Art, which
is exhibiting works by Alexander Calder. He brought motion to art
with his innovative mobiles. The show, "The Art of Invention," was
fanciful and fascinating.</TE>
<TE>   It was a delightful way to conclude, and we didn't drop a single
quarter in a slot machine.</TE>

<LD>"Good Times Guide 2002" gives you the New Orleans lowdown on
attractions in the popular tourist city. It's a mixed bag. While not
detailed, its lodging list is comprehensive (more than 40 hotels in
the French Quarter alone, plus scores of B&amp;Bs) and includes rates. By
contrast, the guide, surprising for a food-obsessed city, skimps on
listing restaurants. It makes up by offering more than 60 coupons for
discounts and freebies on food, tours, museums and more. (800)

<LD>If you think all pens are equal, behold these versatile versions,
which can come in handy on the go. Products may be available in area
stores. Prices do not include shipping.</LD>
<LD>   Ink-credible: Those who have never owned a Fisher Space Pen have
missed the relief of knowing the ink will flow smoothly in freezing
cold, boiling heat, underwater (or in the rain), upside down, even in
zero gravity. (The pen has been tested in space.)</LD>
<LD>   A sealed pressurized ink cartridge enables the ball to write no
matter how the pen is held or what it's writing on. The Telescoping
Pen model is all one piece; there's no cap to lose.</LD>
<TE>   Pull back on the shaft about half an inch to expose the point;
push to close it. Closed, the pen measures 37/8 inches; open, 47/8,
making it a natural to stash in your pocket or carry-on bag.</TE>
<TE>   Telescoping Pen (model TLP) is $35. For information, contact the
Fisher Space Pen Co.; (800) 634-3494, www.spacepen.com.</TE>
<TE>   Pen-ultimate: It was only a matter of time before some clever pen
manufacturer realized that the top of the instrument might be used
for housing more than just the usual clip-on device.</TE>
<TE>   Built into the translucent top of the Swiss Pen, from Wagner, are
a small retractable knife/letter opener, nail-file/screwdriver and
scissors. All obvious assets on a trip.</TE>
<TE>   Pressing the insignia at the top of the barrel activates a mini
flashlight, fueled by one included button battery. The ink cartridge
and battery are replaceable. Can a pen telephone be far behind?</TE>
<TE>   Swiss Pen (65440) is $49.95 from Hammacher Schlemmer; (800)
543-3366, www.hammacher.com.</TE>
<TE>   Quick-change artist: Cross pen sets have a tradition as gifts for
pivotal events: bar mitzvahs, graduations, first jobs.</TE>
<TE>   Now the pens have made some notable strides of their own. The new
Cross Matrix is a multi-function writing instrument. On one end are
dual ball-point pens: Twist the pen tip one way for red, the other
way for blue. On the opposite end is a PDA stylus tip. Pull the
stylus module out of the barrel, flip it, and you have a fountain pen
or gel roller ball pen (depending on the model). The fountain pen and
roller ball modules are interchangeable and available separately for
more flexibility. The roller ball unit can be removed and replaced
with a yellow document highlighter (good for marking maps or
guidebook pages), which is included with that unit.</TE>
<TE>   Cross Matrix is $70 to $80. For information, contact Cross; (800)
722-1726, www.cross.com.</TE>

<LD>Perhaps only hikers appreciate the Cuesta Grade these days.</LD>
<LD>   Some motorists think the steep pass north of San Luis Obispo is
the worst stretch of U.S. 101 between Los Angeles and San Francisco.
Cars move too fast, trucks move too slowly and the turns are too
sharp, they say.</LD>
<LD>   To address the problem, Caltrans embarked on a $48-million project
that includes reconstructing a three-mile section of the grade,
scheduled for completion late next year. Some drivers fear the work
will increase the speed differential between cars and trucks, making
the road more dangerous. Local environmentalists are concerned that a
high-speed corridor will encourage suburban sprawl north of San Luis
Obispo.</LD>
<TE>   Standing above the Cuesta Grade and its controversies are East and
West Cuesta ridges, two trails that are delights for hikers.
Fortunately no changes are planned for the dirt roads that serve as
gateways to intriguing and little-known areas of the southern Santa
Lucia Mountains and Los Padres National Forest.</TE>
<TE>   Panoramic views from the ridge tops include the coast from Morro
Rock to the Pismo dunes, the hills of Montana de Oro State Park and
the Los Osos Valley.</TE>
<TE>   West Cuesta Ridge Road (sometimes called "TV tower road" by
locals) starts at the top of the Cuesta Grade and ascends steeply to
the Cuesta Ridge Botanical Area, home to groves of Sargent cypress.
The road is open to vehicles but, with its abundant potholes, is used
mostly by hikers and mountain bikers.</TE>
<TE>   The effects of a 1994 fire that blackened the landscape are still
evident. The Sargent cypresses, however, benefited from the blaze.
The heat melted the hard resin on the trees' cones, releasing
thousands of seeds. Young cypresses have grown alongside elders in
handsome groves atop the ridge.</TE>
<TE>   At the bottom of West Cuesta Ridge Road, note the beginning of
another trail, Stagecoach Road. It's a 2.8-mile walk (one way)
through a shady canyon parallel to U.S. 101 and San Luis Obispo
Creek. The road could serve as a leg stretcher for weary motorists,
but most people probably will want to skip it.</TE>
<TE>   A more compelling counterpart to West Cuesta is the hike along
East Cuesta Ridge Road, which begins on the other side of the
freeway. This dirt path curves along the Santa Lucia Wilderness among
old oaks and across slopes splashed with lupine and California
poppies.</TE>
<TE>   After about two miles, you will get superb views of the coast.
Three miles out, a left-branching spur road leads a quarter-mile up
to Mt. Lowe, which is topped with a communication tower.</TE>
<TE>   From Mt. Lowe, hike three-quarters of a mile farther to a signed
junction with Lopez Canyon Trail. This path descends into the
wilderness and to Big Falls in the canyon bottom.</TE>
<TE>   Directions to the trail head: Start at East Cuesta Ridge. From
U.S. 101 in San Luis Obispo, drive five miles north. Near the top of
the Cuesta Grade, look for a pullout on the right and park. Climb
over a locked vehicle gate to join East Cuesta Ridge Road.</TE>
<TE>   Be careful when exiting and entering the highway's construction
zone. Also use caution when deciding where to park. Heavy equipment
frequently is being operated or is parked near the trail head. If you
encounter construction, ask workers to recommend the safest parking
place.</TE>
<TE>   To reach West Cuesta Ridge Road, drive a mile farther north on
U.S. 101 and go over the Cuesta Grade summit. Turn left at the first
safe opportunity. Double back on the highway to a parking area at the
base of the signed road. Again, be extremely careful entering and
exiting U.S. 101.</TE>

<HD>As Agents' Commissions Vanish, Fliers Pay More</HD>
<DH>The costs are passed on as airlines change how they do
business, and booking online may not be the solution it appears.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JANE ENGLE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Here's a timely exercise for anyone who has ever bought an airline
ticket. Consider how much you would pay someone to make a plane
reservation for you: $10? $25? $50? $100?</LD>
<LD>   Then call your travel agent and ask what she or he charges. If you
haven't bought a ticket in the last few weeks, you may be surprised.</LD>
<LD>   Since mid-March, travel agents have increased their service fees,
sometimes more than doubling them. And yes, you may be asked to pay
$100, the fee one agency charges frequent fliers to book
international award travel.</LD>
<TE>   The soaring fees are the most obvious aftershocks of major
airlines' decision last month to end commissions to travel agents.
But they're not the only ones. How and where travelers search for air
fare deals, on and off the Internet, is being shaken up by the end of
a decades-long way of doing business.</TE>
<TE>   "With the airlines' decision to eliminate commissions, the
landscape of the travel industry has changed forever," says Richard
M. Copland, president of the American Society of Travel Agents, or
ASTA.</TE>
<TE>   From March 14 to 22, eight major North American carriers, led by
Delta, stopped paying agent commissions, which were typically capped
at $20 per round-trip domestic ticket; the airlines had been
whittling them down since 1995. Delta said it ended the payments to
save money after losing $1 billion last year. Continental, American,
Northwest, United, US Airways, America West and Air Canada copied its
move. Essentially, the airlines are passing on a cost of doing
business to the customer. Alaska, Southwest and some smaller
airlines, including JetBlue, Midwest Express, National, Spirit and
Vanguard continue to pay commissions as of last week.</TE>
<TE>   Copland promptly denounced Delta's move as "anticonsumer," and
just as promptly, agents began raising fees. A sampling:</TE>
<TE>   * Ada Brown, owner of Seaside Travel in Long Beach, increased her
service fees from $10 per ticket to $25 for domestic and $50 for
international tickets, except for airlines that pay commissions. "We
think we can make it on $25 per ticket," she says. Like many agents,
she rejiggered her accounting to allow for the lost payments. She
charges $50 for domestic and $100 for international travel to book
award tickets.</TE>
<TE>   * Travel by Greta in Northridge increased fees by $10 and now
charges $40 for tickets costing $400 or less and $50 for tickets of
more than $400. "It bothers me to do this," says Susan Dushane, of
Travel by Greta and ASTA's area director for Southern California and
southern Nevada.</TE>
<TE>   * Bob Kern, president of ASTA's Southern California chapter, used
to charge a flat per-ticket fee of $15 at his Los Angeles-based
agency, PNR Travel, before increasing fees twice, once in January
(after commission cuts in the fall) and again last week. Now they go
up to $35 for higher-priced tickets; itinerary changes or refunds
cost $50. He worries that "you can only tweak things so much before
you start losing customers."</TE>
<TE>   Rising fees may drive away business and, combined with lost
commission revenue, thin the ranks of travel agents. And that could
limit consumers' choices, in one view.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll lose some travel agents--they'll go the way of the corner
drugstore," predicts airline expert Terry Trippler, president of
Trippler &amp; Associates Inc. in Minneapolis and a former travel agent
who left the business in 1985.</TE>
<TE>   Kern of PNR thinks 25% of agencies will fold. "The changes are
happening so rapidly that many people cannot cope," he says.</TE>
<TE>   But in another view, the changes may ultimately benefit consumers
by ending a long-standing conflict of interest in the travel
industry.</TE>
<TE>   Scott Ahlsmith, vice chairman of the Institute of Certified Travel
Agents, which trains and accredits agents, criticizes an "unhealthy
schizophrenia" in which agents have traditionally been paid by the
airlines through commissions but are expected to act in the interest
of travelers. "You become the servant of two masters," he says.</TE>
<TE>   Besides regular commissions, some larger agencies in certain
markets have traditionally received "overrides," typically 1% to 2%
of the ticket price, for steering business to a particular airline,
says Bill Maloney, executive vice president and chief operating
officer of ASTA. The idea that such payments bias agents to book
certain airlines is "not proven," Maloney says. "There's a difference
between pushing it and bias."</TE>
<TE>   But some others disagree.</TE>
<TE>   "Many larger agencies ... are in effect dealerships for the
airlines," says Bill McGee, editor of Consumer Reports Travel Letter.</TE>
<TE>   Trippler concedes that when he was an agent, he would book an
airline offering him incentives even if another airline offered a
somewhat cheaper flight. "If it was $10, $20, $30 [difference], I
wouldn't say a word" to the customer, he says.</TE>
<TE>   In the short run, the new system may not eliminate bias and may
even increase it. Several travel agents told me they plan to steer
bookings to the handful of airlines that still give commissions.
Delta said it would offer "incentive commissions" to some agents, and
America West announced a new program that would pay up to 5%--far
more than traditional overrides--to agents "in exchange for booking
more of their business on America West." Details of the plans were
not available because the airlines that ended commissions declined
comment beyond brief written statements.</TE>
<TE>   Experts predict that many travelers will turn to the Internet,
where booking is often free or low-cost, cutting into the estimated
75% of tickets that are sold through off-line agents. Travel agent
Brown says she will advise customers needing to book several tickets
at once to go to the Internet rather than use her services and incur
multiple fees.</TE>
<TE>   But the Internet is not always an unbiased source. After the
commission cuts, www.expedia.com briefly demoted United to the bottom
of its fare searches and omitted prices. And www.travelocity.com as
of last week was still charging a $10 fee to book United--and adding
it onto the fare so that United's flights dropped lower on fare
searches. Neither Internet site would specify its reasoning, but both
actions appeared to be results of disputes over how the sites would
be compensated for selling United tickets. Airline-owned
www.orbitz.com, which charges airlines a flat fee to sell their
tickets, did not change its fare displays or its $5-per-ticket
consumer fee in response to the commission cuts, a spokeswoman said.</TE>

<LD>When Elizabeth Schmidt wanted her three kids to spend some time with
their elderly grandmother, they flew from their home in Vermont to
Las Vegas--even though their grandmother lives in Wisconsin. Grandma
flew to Vegas too.</LD>
<LD>   "It was a break from reality for a few days, all of us together,"
said Schmidt, whose physician husband stayed home to work.</LD>
<LD>   Schmidt, a teacher, didn't want to wait for the family's annual
summer trip to Wisconsin to see her 82-year-old mom. And because her
mom didn't want to travel to Vermont in winter, they chose to go
somewhere "fun"--Las Vegas, with a side trip to the Grand Canyon.</LD>
<TE>   "Taking rural Vermont kids to Las Vegas was amazing," Schmidt
said. "Even the revolving doors were exciting [to them], and my mom
was the most wonderful travel companion."</TE>
<TE>   Many families in this post-Sept. 11 travel climate, eager to spend
more time with far-flung siblings and parents, are discovering that
multigenerational getaways--even if they last only a few days and
even if they're only a few hours away from home--make sense.</TE>
<TE>   "I think 9/11 was a jolt to a lot of Americans and made us realize
how important it is to be with family," said Dallas executive William
Ross. He and his wife and daughters, his parents and his siblings and
their children spent Christmas at the Cloister, a historic Sea
Island, Ga., resort. The family has been vacationing at the Cloister
since Ross' parents honeymooned there in the early 1950s.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not just about the golf or the beach," Ross said. "It's
comfortable and reassuring. It's about going out and watching the
kids do the same things you did at the same place."</TE>
<TE>   That's why old-fashioned resorts like the Cloister, (800)
732-4752, www.seaisland.com; the YMCA's Snow Mountain Ranch in
Colorado, (970) 887-2152, www.ymcarockies.org; and Mohonk Mountain
House in New Paltz, N.Y., (800) 772-6646, www.mohonk.com--places that
have catered to families for generations--are doing fine at a time
when other tourist destinations continue to struggle. "We sold out
our children-stay-free program this past Presidents Week," said
Kimberly Troudt, a spokeswoman for Mohonk Mountain House.</TE>
<TE>   I routinely hear from parents and grandparents looking for a place
where they can gather their gang--a place that's easy to get to and
will offer plenty of activity for a range of ages.</TE>
<TE>   The trend started even before last fall. One of every four family
vacation trips last year included grandparents, according to the
newly released Meredith Family Vacation Study. Families are going on
cruises to Alaska and the Caribbean, on trips to Disney World and
various national parks.</TE>
<TE>   The travel club Hideaways International books these family groups
in villas that are surprisingly affordable, in places ranging from
North Carolina to Mexico. Call (800) 843-4433, www.hideaways.com, and
ask about a trial membership.</TE>
<TE>   Family reunion business is up 150% at Smugglers' Notch Resort in
Vermont, (800) 451-8752, www.smuggs.com, in the last couple of years.
Elderhostel, (877) 426-8056, www.elderhostel.org, received so many
requests from veterans of its seniors' learning vacations that a
three-generation trip was offered for the first time this year. It
promptly sold out.</TE>
<TE>   Loews Hotels, (800) 23-LOEWS (235-6397), www.loewshotels.com,
offers "Generation G" packages at some properties, designed to make
intergenerational travel easier for grandparents and grandkids.</TE>
<TE>   The trips won't be perfect. Families aren't, after all. They can
be annoying and frustrating, but also more fun and rewarding than you
ever remembered.</TE>

<HD>Visitors Don't Defile Ground Zero</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>I just returned from a short visit to New York City and was thankful
for the instructive article "Ground Zero" (March 17). I arrived at
Pier 16 at South Street Seaport about 45 minutes before the 11 a.m.
ticket distribution, received my ticket for 12:30 p.m. for the
viewing platform, walked part of the perimeter of the site, went to
the corner of Church and Vesey streets and saw the many memorials and
shrinesvisible around the area.</LD>
<LD>   Contrary to Pam Edwards' letter ("Ground Zero Is No Tour
Destination," March 31), a visit to the World Trade Center site does
not in any way diminish it as hallowed ground. Visitors of all ages
and from throughout the world showed only respect and were clearly
moved by the experience. Rather than taking on morbid undertones or
evoking the feeling of gawking, it made this cataclysmic disaster
more real and offered an opportunity for reflection and catharsis. In
hushed tones and in a polyglot of languages as well as in silence,
individuals and groups made their pilgrimages, often stopping to
write a prayer or message on the plywood construction.</LD>
<LD>   Just as visiting the graves at Normandy or Pearl Harbor makes one
reflect on the consequences of war, one hopes the impact of this site
will make visitors ponder the consequences of evil, hatred and
terrorism.</LD>
<TE>   ALISON MAYERSOHN</TE>
<TE>   Los Alamitos</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Gettysburg, Shiloh and the beaches of Normandy traditionally draw
tourists not to gawk but to reflect and remember the significance of
those hallowed grounds. These are places to inculcate in ourselves a
collective resolve to do what is in our power to prevent these
tragedies from recurring. These are places we can go and pay our
respects to those who died and to honor the heroes and perhaps say a
prayer for the dead and their loved ones.</TE>
<TE>   Ground zero is for the ages.</TE>
<TE>   STEPHEN GATES</TE>
<TE>   San Clemente</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I think Pam Edwards may not have considered why Americans may want
to visit ground zero. I think many of those who visit the site come
to pay their respects, as I did when I paid a visit to the friends of
my father who are entombed at the Arizona Memorial at Pearl Harbor.</TE>
<TE>   Last Easter we visited the graves at the American and German
cemeteries near the Normandy beaches. I was honoring those who had
fallen there and being thankful for the freedom that allowed us to be
there.</TE>
<TE>   We are planning a trip to Krakow, Poland, and it will include a
visit to Auschwitz. I know this will not be a walk on the beach in
Maui but a reflection on the evil that was done to others by a few
misguided leaders.</TE>

<LD>I read James T. Yenckel's article about Napa Valley ("Napa for Next

shocked that he found Copia disappointing. Visiting Copia was the

check it out, but I stayed more than three hours.</LD>
<LD>   The exhibits were entertaining; the gardens were a delight; there
were numerous tours offered that day, and free mustard and Chardonnay
tastings; the cafe offered good food and a relaxing environment.</LD>

<HD>Michoacan's Colonial Treasures</HD>
<DH>MORELIA: Flavor of old Mexico lingers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS KRAUL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MORELIA, Mexico</DL>
<LD>From Quito to Cuzco, from Pelourinho to Popayan, I've been to some
great old colonial cities and districts while working and bumming
around Latin America the past 25 years. (Those are places in Ecuador,
Peru, Brazil and Colombia, respectively, in case you're wondering.)
But for my money, none is more evocative of times gone by than this,
the capital of Michoacan state.</LD>
<LD>   There have been times I've sat in Jardin de las Rosas, a 17th
century plaza surrounded by the oldest music conservatory in the
hemisphere on one side and the Baroque Las Rosas convent church on
the other, half expecting a procession of carriages,
sword-brandishing soldiers or religious flagellants to appear at any
time. That's how strong the sense of time standing still is in this,
my favorite corner of one of my favorite cities.</LD>
<LD>   So when my two grown kids, Maria Helene and Christian, visited
from California last December, I didn't hesitate to choose Morelia as
an escape from Mexico City, the fast-paced and polluted capital where
I live and work. It was an inspired choice. They loved the town--its
people, its pink limestone colonial buildings, its food, clean air
and quiet.</LD>
<TE>   Morelia's uniqueness is due largely to the fact that it's in
Michoacan, a region southwest of Mexico's capital that is
embarrassingly rich in history, crafts and natural beauty. Day trips
from here easily fill a long weekend or more: The migrating monarch
butterflies, the pre-Columbian ruins of Tzintzuntzan and the cobbled
streets of Patzcuaro are all nearby and beckon. But for me, Morelia
is a destination city in itself, and the ambience of its historic
core district exerts the strongest pull.</TE>
<TE>   Founded in 1541 and laid out in 1570, Morelia has managed to
retain a pleasingly archaic character and proportion, even as so many
other historic centers in Latin America have been erased from map and
memory, victims of redevelopment, earthquakes and neglect.</TE>
<TE>   The city spent its first 286 years as Valladolid, then in 1827
renamed itself Morelia after native son and revolutionary hero Jose
Maria Morelos.</TE>
<TE>   Morelia's historic district is no smattering of a few old
buildings, but instead encompasses 120 blocks. It also spans more
than four centuries, from the austere and fortress-like San Francisco
church and monastery, begun in 1530, to the eclectic Palace of
Justice, built in the 1880s by a free-thinking Belgian engineer named
Guillermo Wodon de Sorinne.</TE>
<TE>   Vigilantly towering over the scene is Morelia's eponymous
cathedral, one of Mexico's three largest and, I think, the most
beautiful, best illuminated and most dramatic.</TE>
<TE>   Framing the city's east side is perhaps the city's most striking
relic and strongest preservation statement: a mile-long limestone
aqueduct completed in the late 1700s but which hasn't funneled water
into the city since 1910. UNESCO designated Morelia, the jewel of the
Guanangaro Valley, as a World Heritage Site in 1991, an honor given
to places whose historic significance and authenticity merits global
recognition.</TE>
<TE>   We approached the issue of how Morelia pulled off the feat of
preserving its historic core as something of a mystery and began
investigating. It turns out that the survival of old Morelia owes
much to geology. The city sits on a miles-wide sheet of solid
bedrock, a limestone layer from which many of its structures were
quarried. Because of its foundation, Morelia has not been ground to
dust by seismic shifts that over the years have leveled much of, for
instance, Mexico City and Lima, Peru.</TE>
<TE>   But most of the credit for Morelia's preservation is due to
Morelians, who are jealous guardians of their past. Zoning laws, in
place since the 1930s, forbid construction of anything in the
historic center that is out of character. In fact, much of that
district has been restored and rebuilt, but in strict adherence to
design standards respectful of the city's past.</TE>
<TE>   I had given the town quite a buildup, so my kids, both in their
20s, were eager to see the place after the four-hour luxury-bus ride
from Mexico City. The road wound through the cornfields of Toluca
Valley, past the piney Zinapecuaro mountains and down past Lake
Cuitzeo, whose reflection of the pale blue Michoacan light reminded
me of Lake Titicaca, which straddles the border of Bolivia and Peru.</TE>
<TE>   Arriving in the new bus station five miles east of town, we
quickly became aware of Morelia's climate: It's ideally mild and dry.
At 6,300 feet, Morelia is 1,000 feet lower than Mexico City and so a
bit warmer. Then, after the taxi ride into town, came the pleasant
shock of streets devoid of the vendors, called ambulantes, who clog
many Mexican cities to distraction. Morelia expelled street vendors
last July, and, for now, its sidewalks are clear and the historic
sights accessible.</TE>
<TE>   Our choice of hotels was the only misstep of the trip. The Hotel
Catedral, where we stayed for three nights opposite the cathedral,
was noisy and poorly run. But in a subsequent trip in late March, I
got it right. I checked into the Hotel Virrey de Mendoza, a colonial
mansion dating back three centuries. In the historic heart of the
city and loaded with colonial charm, it was converted in 1939 from a
private home into a hotel named for the viceroy who founded Morelia;
a third floor was added later. Its high ceilings, stained-glass
atrium (covering what once was a courtyard) and collection of antique
furniture produce just the right Old Mexico atmosphere.</TE>
<TE>   My bad luck in lodging choice during the visit with my kids was a
minor setback. Once we arrived we were quickly swept up in Morelia's
history: It is regarded as the ideological cradle of Mexican
independence. Miguel Hidalgo, the father of Mexican independence,
taught at the Colegio de San Nicolas, which dates from 1570 and may
be the hemisphere's oldest secondary school. One of his students was
native son Morelos, the fiery military leader and martyr who was the
closest thing to Mexico's George Washington.</TE>
<TE>   We came across tableaus of Morelia history painted in murals in
many public buildings by Alfredo Zalce, who, at 94, is one of the
last survivors of the legendary generation of Mexican muralists that
include Rivera, Siqueiros and Orozco. Zalce's earthy, vivid colors
and harmonious compositions capture for me the essence of the
Michoacan aesthetic.</TE>
<TE>   On our first day, my son and daughter awoke in time for their trip
to the special forest preserve in eastern Michoacan state. There,
from October through March, monarch butterflies complete their
3,000-mile migration from as far away as Canada. It was a three-hour
bus ride to Angangueo, then an hour trek up to see the insects
clinging to tree branches in shimmering swarms. But it was worth the
trip, they said.</TE>
<TE>   "They were a living, moving accumulation of orange," Christian
said. As he and Maria Helene approached the trees, butterflies rained
down on them, dead or dying after mating. "A little morbid,
considering they are all falling to their deaths after one last
romp," Maria Helene added.</TE>
<TE>   (In January, a few weeks after they visited, the beautiful
insects' progeny died in a rare winter freeze that gripped the
region. The butterflies will be back in the fall but possibly in
greatly reduced numbers.)</TE>
<TE>   While the kids were taking in nature, I was taking the waters at
Los Azufres National Park, having chosen to visit the mineral baths
there. Also in the mountains east of Morelia, amid geothermal power
plants and sulfur mines, the Laguna Larga resort has two outdoor
pools and another set of four thermal baths across the street and up
the hill from its wood cabanas.</TE>
<TE>   Locals favor the no-frills facility; you pay only $3 and bring
your own towel. And like the trip to see the butterflies, it's worth
the time and expense (a 90-minute, $60 taxi ride) to get there. The
drill at Laguna Larga is the same as at any thermal bath: sit, soak
and let the mineral waters work their tranquilizing and mind-clearing
magic.</TE>
<TE>   The next morning, while the kids slept in, I took an early morning
walking tour of the central city that featured enthusiastic,
bilingual guides. The guide on my tour, Alfredo de la Cruz Ibarra,
told me how the city grew wealthy from local gold and copper mining,
and how by the 1700s it had became one of the Catholic church's three
largest administrative centers in Mexico, a status that attracted a
dozen religious orders to build monasteries and convents, most still
standing.</TE>
<TE>   The first stop on the tour was the former Jesuit seminary called
the Palacio Clavijero, begun in 1660 and now occupied by the
Michoacan state government. It is perhaps the city's brightest
architectural gem, its two tiers of graceful colonnades bespeaking
temporal power and celestial affinity. Then we walked down Avenida
Nigromonte to Jardin de las Rosas, an island of tranquillity and one
of dozens of plazas that bejewel Morelia. The convent included a
school for girls founded in 1743 that became the hemisphere's first
music conservatory.</TE>
<TE>   According to De la Cruz, the guide, the name Jardin de las Rosas
took on a double meaning because it provided a vantage point from
which eligible bachelors could view the "flowers" (schoolgirls) who
would present themselves on the building's unusual open-sided rooftop
gallery when classes and rules permitted.</TE>
<TE>   We stopped long enough to enjoy lunch at the 200-year old Hotel de
la Soledad, one of Mexico's oldest lodgings. The restaurant there, La
Capilla, serves delicious Michoacan specialties, including pollo
plazero, chicken cooked with carrots and potatoes, and corundas,
which resemble tamales covered in a tomato, onion and garlic sauce.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps the most unusual remnant of Morelian times gone by is the
three-quarter-mile-long Calzada Fray Antonio de San Miguel, a
tree-lined processional walkway completed in the mid-1700s that is
paved with limestone and lined with stone benches. The Calzada
connected the city to a shrine of Our Lady of Guadalupe, but now it's
a beautiful pedestrian causeway conducive to reflection as well as
passionate encounters: It's a favorite trysting zone for local
adolescents.</TE>
<TE>   The tour ended at the immense main cathedral, completed in 1744
after 80 years of construction. Upon entry, all eyes fix naturally on
the gleaming, half-ton solid silver monstrance that sits atop the
main altar. It was crafted in 1794, but revolutionary turmoil
prompted church fathers to hide it in the cathedral basement for 140
years. It was finally returned to the main altar in 1950.</TE>
<TE>   (The city tours, then offered every weekend by the Michoacan state
tourism office, have been discontinued since our visit, but the staff
recently assured me they would soon resume.)</TE>
<TE>   The next morning, we went to the Michoacan Regional Museum, a
remarkable storehouse of history that features my favorite Zalce
mural over the stairwell. The allegorical representation, called
"Cuauhtemoc and History," depicts how the exploitation of Mexico and
its indigenous peoples continued long after Hernando Cortes, the
Spanish conquistador. In one of the museum's upper rooms is a true
curiosity, an anonymous wall-size 18th century painting that portrays
the 1738 procession of cloistered nuns from Las Rosas to their new
convent, Las Monjas, several blocks away. The painting shows how
church laymen tried to shield the nuns, who were prohibited for life
from any public contact.</TE>
<TE>   The veil has long since been lifted. Religious orders have not
occupied Morelia's convents and monasteries since the late 1850s,
when the reform movement under Benito Juarez stripped all religious
orders in Mexico of their once-massive property holdings. Las Monjas
has been turned into federal offices, its several interior patios
perfectly accessible to tourists.</TE>
<TE>   We cut our visit short to run to the Casa de Artesanias, the huge
state-run handicrafts store occupying an entire building, a former
monastery, next to San Francisco Church. The government sponsors
contests among Michoacan's craftspeople, with the winning products
earning shelf space at the artisans' shop.</TE>
<TE>   There we saw an unbelievable variety of beautifully finished
things from Michoacan towns: guitars made in Paracho, intricately
designed hemp floor mats from Patzcuaro, baskets from Santa Cruz
Tanaco, ceramics from Zinapecuaro and wooden masks from Ocumicho.</TE>
<TE>   On our last night we visited Tzintzuntzan, half an hour's drive
from Morelia. There, under a full moon lighting Lake Patzcuaro and
the archeological park's five yacates, or pyramids, we saw a fiery
juego de pelota in what was once a ceremonial court. Teams of 20
youths batted around an ignited pumpkin-size ball in a reenactment of
the Purepecha Indian ceremony of "new fire," traditionally held at
the beginning of a new year after the use of fire had been banned for
five days.</TE>
<TE>   Somewhat out of breath but happy, we ended our four-day trip
having just scratched the surface of Morelia and Michoacan. There
will be return visits--I hope soon--to visit Michoacan towns on feast
days, attend the August guitar festival at Paracho, and be in Morelia
for the organ festival in May, when the cathedral's 4,600-pipe
instrument is played.</TE>
<TE>   Still, we left having caught an unforgettable glimpse of Morelia's
rich history. And we accomplished our purpose in leaving the
enervating capital city to see a part of Mexico with a living past
but not overrun with tourists, one with a vibrant regional character
but not at all isolated from the rest of the world.</TE>

<HD>Beyond Wholly Mole</HD>
<DH>Oaxaca's fare is more than one dish; it's grasshoppers too.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BARBARA HANSEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>OAXACA, Mexico</DL>
<LD>Oaxaca is often called the "land of seven moles" because its
residents are so fond of this elaborate dish. But I found much more
to taste, from the weird (grasshopper pizza and salt mixed with
powdered worms) to the aristocratic (a rose petal sorbet).</LD>
<LD>   Last October I spent three weeks in the city of Oaxaca (Oaxaca is
also the name of the state), so I had plenty of time to explore
restaurants, bakeries and markets. I was here for Spanish immersion
classes at the Becari Language School, which helped in discovering
where to go, what to order and how the dishes were made. I came home
with a guide to what I thought was the best food as well as a
notebook full of recipes.</LD>
<LD>   Oaxaca, a colonial city of 244,000 in the largely mountainous
region of southern Mexico, is rich in indigenous culture, and it
takes pride in a varied cuisine that preserves cooking techniques
known long before the Spanish conquest.</LD>
<TE>   Women sell bread baked at home in wood-fueled ovens. Corn
tortillas, called blandas, are large, rustic and full of character.
Some are made from black corn. Fragrant avocado leaves and an
anise-scented herb, called hierba santa, perfume many dishes.</TE>
<TE>   In market areas, women walk along with baskets of guias, tender
shoots of the squash vine, on their heads. These are used in soup,
along with squash flowers. Black beans are preferred, and
quesadillas, made with squash flowers and the full-flavored string
cheese known as quesillo, are outrageously good.</TE>
<TE>   And then there's mole. It's probably sacrilegious to admit that I
tried to avoid it, but I had overdosed on the dish, with its sweet,
chocolate-infused sauce, while traveling in the state of Veracruz and
in Puebla, home of mole poblano, Mexico's national dish.</TE>
<TE>   Eventually I succumbed, because it was unthinkable to leave Oaxaca
without trying at least some of its moles. One taste and I realized
that abstinence had been a big mistake, but more on that later.</TE>
<TE>   Each day I worked out a dining agenda, from breakfast through
coffee breaks, multi-course lunches and late evening snacks, taking
buses to nearby towns to see what they offered.</TE>
<TE>   A note of caution: It's always a good idea to be careful eating
abroad. I ate food from street stalls and almost anywhere without
problems. But people's constitutions differ. In recent years I have
noticed that eating is safer and sanitary conditions are better than
in the distant past. But any kind of change in food or water can
cause problems. The old rules of thumb are still appropriate: Watch
out for water (that means ice too), sticking instead with bottled
drinks; eat only produce that is peeled; and try to avoid things
grown on the ground.</TE>
<TE>   With that in mind, here are some of the highlights from my eating
adventures.</TE>
<TE>   Breakfast</TE>
<TE>   For delicious local specialties, go to the Mercado 20 de
Noviembre, a big building filled with food stalls. It's a couple of
blocks from the zocalo, or square, just beyond the Mercado Benito
Juarez, a large market where you can shop for dried chiles, local
cheeses, fruits, flowers and handicrafts.</TE>
<TE>   I usually ate at the Comedor Regional Chabela, a spotless place
with a long menu. First came hot chocolate accompanied by a lightly
sweetened anise-scented bun called pan de yema, then perhaps a bowl
of fried cheese in tomato sauce flavored with chiles and epazote. If
I wanted orange juice, a stall called Jugos y Licuados Wily would
send over a tall glass of it, foamy and freshly squeezed.</TE>
<TE>   A leisurely breakfast at the outdoor restaurants along the zocalo
is also nice. The pan de yema at La Primavera is especially good,
softer and fluffier than some in the mercado; with a hot chocolate,
you'll pay about $2.25. Try huevos a la Oaxaquena, an egg pancake
folded around cheese and placed in a casserole of tomato sauce.</TE>
<TE>   Lunch</TE>
<TE>   The afternoon comida, a full-course set menu, starts so late that
at 2:30 p.m., a restaurant might still be empty.</TE>
<TE>   My favorite place was La Olla, which is attached to a charming
bed-and-breakfast called Las Bugambilias on Reforma in the center of
town, not far from the zocalo. For about $5.50 you can have a meal
such as this: chayote squash cut in half, filled with cheese and an
epazote leaf and set on a pool of tomato sauce. Next, black bean soup
with strips of fresh cactus, followed by chicken in a ground almond
and tomato sauce and, for dessert, fresh guava shells.  Excellent
whole wheat bread accompanies La Olla's comidas.</TE>
<TE>   La Casa del Tio Guero on Garcia Vigil, a small place that's
colorfully decorated with local artwork, charges about $3.50 for a
comida that might include cream of spinach soup; huauzontle, a
Mexican vegetable that looks like lacy broccoli, in a tomato or mole
sauce; a fresh guava drink; and fried bananas smothered with
cinnamon-flavored cream.</TE>
<TE>   Casa Elpidia, a family-run restaurant, is hidden inside a walled
building that surrounds a lush garden. Lunch, for about $4.50, starts
with an appetizer plate that includes tastes of cheese, chicharrones
(crisp pork skin) and an empanada stuffed with squash flowers.</TE>
<TE>   Then you might have vegetable soup accompanied by warm bolillos,
the Mexican version of the French roll, followed by a chile filled
with sweet-tasting shredded pork; rice studded with corn kernels;
flan and coffee. The perfect beverage is a tall glass of cold beer
mixed with lime juice.</TE>
<TE>   Dinner</TE>
<TE>   It's impossible to eat much after a hearty comida. For a light
snack, go to Taqueria El Primo on Calzada de la Republica to sample
the gringas--small, thin flour tortillas folded taco style around
carne al pastor (grilled marinated pork), onion, cilantro and a slice
of fresh pineapple. They're a little less than 80 cents each. El
Primo's atole de arroz, a hot, sweet rice drink, is soothing late at
night.</TE>
<TE>   Oaxaca is loaded with pizza, pasta and panini places that cater to
tourists, but locals like them too.</TE>
<TE>   Trattoria Pizza e Pasta L'italiano offers pizza Oaxaca, topped
with cheese, grilled poblano and jalapeno chiles and, in the center,
a scattering of crunchy, dark brown crumbs that turned out to be
chapulines--tiny fried grasshoppers. Everywhere I went, vendors held
out baskets of this delicacy. I could handle the insects on a pizza
but not alone as a snack.</TE>
<TE>   Less daunting is pizza Alu Eli, topped with tomato sauce,
mozzarella and Oaxacan cheeses, green olives, mushrooms and squash
flowers. Small pizzas run about $4.25.</TE>
<TE>   The huge market called Central de Abastos smells like pesto
because so many vendors stroll about with armloads of fresh basil. If
that whets your appetite, go to La Rustica, a second-floor Italian
restaurant that puts out a nice bowl of pesto with pasta imported
from Italy.</TE>
<TE>   Oaxaca has its own pizza, the clayuda. The base is an extra large,
chewy corn tortilla, smeared lightly with asiento (fat from frying
pork) and black bean puree, then topped with shreds of quesillo, the
Oaxacan string cheese. Or it can be grilled meat such as cecina
enchilada, which is thinly cut pork marinated with red chile. I had a
clayuda with the pork. This plus a drink came to about $4.25.</TE>
<TE>   Ice cream and icy drinks</TE>
<TE>   Exquisite rose petal ice is a Oaxacan specialty. It's made with
small dried flowers, called rosas de Castilla (which you can buy from
herb stalls in Mexican markets and even in L.A., on Olvera Street)
rather than fresh rose petals.</TE>
<TE>   One of the best versions is at Nieves Oaxaquenas Chaguita in the
Mercado Juarez. The astonishing menu lists 37 exotic ices, including
leche quemada (burned milk), which tastes of smoke.</TE>
<TE>   The plaza outside the Basilica de la Soledad on Independencia is
filled with neverias, ice cream stands that offer as many flavors as
Chaguita. Attendants set containers of sweet liquid in ice and spin
them by hand until frozen.</TE>
<TE>   A chain called Popeye is known for paletas (ice pops). Try a
double, with pink cactus fruit ice on one end and leche quemada on
the other.</TE>
<TE>   Tall, cool drinks are the specialty of Aqui Casilda in the Juarez
market. Casilda's renowned drink is horchata made from ground
almonds. It's topped with cactus fruit marmalade, pecans and diced
cantaloupe. When you stir in the red marmalade, the white drink turns
bright pink. Casilda, by the way, uses only purified water.</TE>
<TE>   Hot chocolate, coffee</TE>
<TE>   and mezcal</TE>
<TE>   Hot chocolate is possibly Oaxaca's favorite beverage. It's served
in a bowl, not a cup, and you'll be asked to specify whether you want
it made with agua (water) or leche (milk). The bowl allows easy
dipping of the pan de yema that comes on the side.</TE>
<TE>   Oaxacan chocolate is processed by grinding cacao beans with sugar
and flavorings such as cinnamon and almonds. Two major processors, La
Soledad and Mayordomo, have shops on F.J. Mina, just outside the
Mercado 20 de Noviembre. You can sample before buying.</TE>
<TE>   Oaxacan coffee is rich and strong. I bought freshly roasted beans
from a cooperative that produces premium coffee in the highland area
known as Pluma Hidalgo. Its export-quality coffee is Guishcaffie, a
Zapotec Indian word that means "coffee mountains."</TE>
<TE>   Mezcal, Oaxaca's smoky-tasting agave liquor, predates tequila. You
can buy it plain or flavored with fruits, coffee, coconut or other
additions, sweet or dry. One variation, labeled pechuga, was once
distilled with a chicken breast. Now it's more likely to be flavored
with fruit. Liquor shops in the Mercado Juarez lure customers by
offering samples. A traditional accompaniment is salt mixed with
ground chile and agave worms. Vendors sometimes tuck in a packet with
your purchase.</TE>
<TE>   Mole</TE>
<TE>   Oaxacan moles come in earthy colors such as brick red, yellow,
green, brown and black. At its best, black mole--mole negro--is
extraordinary, a complex blend of flavors with subtle smoke, berry
and herbal overtones. Try it at El Biche Pobre on the Calzada de la
Republica, one of the best places for traditional Oaxacan dishes.
It's also very good at the Comedor Familiar la Fonda, beside the
market in the town of Etla, about 45 minutes by bus, and at La
Capilla, a sprawling ranch-style restaurant near the town of
Zaachila, about eight miles from here.</TE>
<TE>   Green mole is colored with tomatillos, green chiles and fresh
herbs. The sauce from mole coloradito, a red mole, is also used for
enchiladas. The Comedor Anel, a market stall in Ocotlan, which is
about 40 minutes from Oaxaca by bus, makes such good coloradito
enchiladas that I went back for a second taste. There's no filling,
just cheese and onion rings scattered over the top.</TE>
<TE>   From someone with no interest in mole, I've turned into such a fan
that I'm returning to Oaxaca soon, not only to study Spanish but also
to take a class in mole negro. A recipe in one Oaxacan cookbook calls
for 28 ingredients, including four kinds of chiles, three kinds of
nuts, red and green tomatoes, sesame and pumpkin seeds, chocolate,
fragrant avocado leaves and a variety of spices and fresh herbs.</TE>
<TE>   It's going to be a challenge to gather the ingredients at home,
but no effort is too great if it means I can taste this sublime dish
whenever I please.</TE>

<DH>PATZCUARO: Heritage shines in its crafts.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRISTOPHER REYNOLDS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>PATZCUARO, Mexico</DL>
<LD>Four hundred and twenty-two years ago, when the local big shots
hitched up their wagons and moved to new headquarters down the road,
this city lost its juice. And perhaps thanks to that, a newcomer in
the right mood can still taste its old flavor.</LD>
<LD>   I mean juice as in power. Patzcuaro sits on a hillside by a lake,
and as you stroll through its shady plazas and crowded markets or
stand near the basilica and look down Calle Buena Vista, you can
imagine it as a handy base of operations when Spaniards began to take
over this area in the early 16th century.</LD>
<LD>   In those days, Patzcuaro's power radiated out to the islands on
nearby Lake Patzcuaro (pronounced POTS-kwa-ro) and surrounding towns
of the indigenous Purepechas (also known as Tarascans), and the
region's destiny was largely in the hands of an aged bishop named Don
Vasco de Quiroga. Nearly five centuries later, whether you're
slipping down an alley past the cooking tortillas and soaking corn
cobs, or sitting by the strumming mariachis in the plaza, there's
still no getting around this town without hearing about Quiroga.</LD>
<TE>   But once his tenure had passed, church and civil officials decided
in 1580 to move the state's seat of power from here to Morelia, about
45 minutes away. Over the generations, Morelia grew and grew, its
colonial center eventually surrounded by a population of more than
600,000, and an airport on its outskirts. It remains the capital of
the state of Michoacan and the seat of the region's Catholic bishop.
Patzcuaro, meanwhile, stayed smallish, its 40,000 residents ambling
along on cobblestone streets between adobe buildings with red-tile
roofs.</TE>
<TE>   I came to amble among them because I believe in enjoying the
slower, small-town Mexico while it lasts. I had heard about
Patzcuaro's colonial atmosphere, the scenic lake and islands next
door, and the string of craft villages circling the lake like a
necklace. I was far from being the only tourist (Patzcuaro has long
been popular with admirers of Mexican crafts and folk art), but
because there are no beaches here, and no 300-room hotels, tourism
usually casts a shorter shadow.</TE>
<TE>   My first stop was downtown Patzcuaro, where government offices,
shops and lodgings stand shoulder to shoulder in old mansions
surrounding the stately shade trees, benches and fountains of a main
plaza named, yes, for Don Vasco de Quiroga.</TE>
<TE>   But it wasn't an easy introduction: Booked into the Mansion
Iturbe, a bed-and-breakfast in a historic building facing the plaza,
I arrived in a late summer rain and was told that the hotel's
off-street parking lot was several blocks away. By the time I had
clawed my way to the lot and back through the thick, wet, end-of-day
downtown traffic, I had all but abandoned the idea of Patzcuaro as a
smaller, slower place.</TE>
<TE>   But the rain abated, the hotel proved pleasant, the traffic never
got that bad again and, as long as I was staying in the city, I
didn't need to use the rental car anyway. Soon enough I was
comfortably established amid the brightly colored walls and rustic
furniture of my $95-a-night room, a tiny balcony just outside.</TE>
<TE>   It didn't hurt that my favorite restaurant in town turned out to
be a Euro-Mexican place called El Primer Piso (the First Floor), just
across the plaza. Nor did I mind that the many arches of the 17th
century Templo del Sagrario, my favorite piece of architecture in
town, were just one block east of the plaza on Calle Portugal.</TE>
<TE>   During the next few days I walked a lot and found that Patzcuaro,
more than 7,000 feet above sea level and 240 miles west of Mexico
City, is a good place for sweaters and umbrellas. It's cool most of
the year, with winter lows often dropping into the 40s. In the
summer, highs can reach the 80s, but afternoon showers are common.</TE>
<TE>   One of my frequent stops was the Plaza Gertrudis Bocanegra ("Plaza
Chica," or little square, in the local shorthand), which fulfills
more blue-collar purposes than the main plaza, including a farmer's
market that goes on for blocks, snaking down alleys and around
corners. Next to the Plaza Chica, I stepped into a building that I
expected to be a church--and in fact it was built as a convent
dedicated to St. Augustine in the 16th century--and found that it's
now a library. Further, its back wall was covered with an enormous
1942 mural of Michoacan history, painted by the acclaimed Mexican
muralist Juan O'Gorman.</TE>
<TE>   The star of that mural, of course, is Don Vasco de Quiroga.
Trained as a lawyer before joining the priesthood, he was in his
early 60s when he reached this region in the early 1530s. Most
accounts put his age at 67 when he was named bishop of Michoacan, and
by all accounts his tenure was as mild and paternal as his
predecessors' had been fierce and repressive.</TE>
<TE>   Having read "Utopia," Thomas More's 1516 imagined vision of a
Christian socialist island paradise somewhere on the way from Europe
to the Americas, Quiroga aimed to draw on those ideas to establish a
model society on the banks of Lake Patzcuaro. He died in nearby
Uruapan in 1565, at age 95, but his remains rest in the Basilica de
Nuestra Senora de la Salud, Patzcuaro's principal church.</TE>
<TE>   Quiroga may have fallen short of building a perfect society, but
he didn't fail entirely. One of his priorities was to encourage each
Purepecha village to develop and cling to a commercial specialty. As
an introduction to that strategy, I spent a pleasant hour on the site
of another Quiroga innovation: the Primitivo Colegio de San Nicolas
Obispo, founded in 1540 as one of the first colleges in the Americas.
The university later moved to Morelia. But its old site remains in
business as Patzcuaro's Regional Museum of Popular Arts and Crafts.
The museum, an 18th century building designed as a rectangle around a
pleasant central courtyard, gives a fine overview to the craft-making
of the surrounding countryside, with ceramics, masks, woodwork,
lacquerware, copper pots and clay jars filling 11 rooms.</TE>
<TE>   If you spend a few hours on the 55-mile drive around the lake
(there's also bus service if you're on a tighter budget), you see
further manifestations of Quiroga's vision. My first stop, about 10
miles from Patzcuaro, was Tzintzuntzan (pronounced sin-soon-sawn),
named for the sound of local hummingbirds and home to a modest town
and several immodest pre-Columbian pyramids. At the height of its
pre-Columbian days, Tzintzuntzan served as the Purepecha capital and
had enough juice of its own to muster a sizable army. In the town
there are a handful of roadside woodworking studios and vendors
offering embroidered cloth showing local scenes and customs. (None of
the towns around the lake approaches Patzcuaro's collection of
colonial architecture, but you do see striking churches here and
there, and pleasant views abound of the lake and the countryside.)</TE>
<TE>   As you continue around the lake, Erongaricuaro (11 miles from
Patzcuaro) is known for embroidered cotton fabrics and, more
recently, furniture. (During World War II it is said to have been a
refuge for Andre Breton and other surrealists looking to keep a low
profile.) Tocuaro (eight miles from Patzcuaro) is known for masks.
Santa Clara del Cobre (also known as Villa Escalante, about 12 miles
south of Patzcuaro) is the copperware capital of the region and hosts
a festival every August. Farther afield, more than an hour's drive
from Patzcuaro in the mountains above Uruapan, there's Paracho, the
guitar-making capital of Mexico, which has its own August festival.
Throughout Michoacan, merchants display colorful lacquerware
(especially hand-painted wood serving trays known as bateas).</TE>
<TE>   Apart from Morelia, there are at least two notable side trips
possible from Patzcuaro. One is the drive (about an hour each way)
and hike up Paricutin volcano, which in 1943 buried a town near
Paracho in lava.</TE>
<TE>   Wherever you go in or around Patzcuaro, you're likely to encounter
Purepechans. Along its mountains, lakes, forests and rivers, the
state retains a larger indigenous population than most regions of
Mexico. A recent study by the Mexican government found that of the 4
million residents in Michoacan, more than 100,000 speak an indigenous
language (mostly Purepecha) besides Spanish.</TE>
<TE>   Other studies, meanwhile, hint at a population you're less likely
to find: ambitious men of working age. Every year, while thousands of
American visitors head this way to savor the Old World atmosphere,
thousands of Michoacanos are heading north to seek work in the U.S. A
1998 Mexican population study found that among males age 18 or older
in the state, one in three has at some point gone north to the U.S.
to find work, a rate that puts Michoacan among the Mexican states
that export the most workers. The week before I arrived in Patzcuaro,
in fact, the city played host to a traveling seminar from the
University of Iowa's School of Social Work: "Understanding and
Valuing the Mexican Immigrant/Guest Worker."</TE>
<TE>   Given all the artisan activity in Patzcuaro, I expected a trove of
folk treasures at the Casa de Once Patios (House of 11 Courtyards),
an 18th century convent that has been converted into a handicrafts
mall. Instead I found a mixed bag: a fascinating loom-weaving
demonstration in one room; a collection of hastily made guitars of
low-quality wood in the next. Also, renovations have left the
building with five, not 11, courtyards. (Jennifer J. Rose, a resident
of Morelia who writes frequently about the area, assured me that
turnover and relocations are frequent among Patzcuaro merchants,
especially in the Casa de Once Patios, which makes it difficult to
predict whether you'll find gold or dross.)</TE>
<TE>   The visit was redeemed by an entertaining folk dance performance
by the tip-seeking children in front. But I found the shopping more
interesting in El Santuario, at 29 Plaza Vasco de Quiroga, where the
walls were crowded with tinwork and colorful religious tokens.</TE>
<TE>   Along the same lines, I should mention Janitzio Island, which is
the site of one of Mexico's most celebrated Day of the Dead
observances. Each year on Nov. 1, islanders and their neighbors take
to their boats to enact a candlelight ritual, the flames reflected in
the water, the boats laden with flowers, the boaters chanting. Sounds
wonderful. But on my visit, Janitzio seemed to function principally
as a tourism machine.</TE>
<TE>   From a distance, it could be More's Utopia: a handsome little
island, its slopes peppered with homes and shops, its crest topped by
a towering statue commemorating a revolutionary hero ("vast and
unsuitable," in the words of my Blue Guide).</TE>
<TE>   But once you have found your way to the dock and paid the $3
round-trip boat fare, the reality is less picturesque: You ride out
for 20 minutes (most of the tourists were Mexicans on the day I
went), step off the boat and climb toward the top, paying money to
restaurants and merchants on the way. You reach the top, where you
pay to climb the stairs (the walls are painted with murals) inside
the 120-foot-high heroic statue (Mexican independence movement leader
Jose Maria Morelos y Pavon, who has one fist raised to the sky). Then
you descend the hill and wait for the next boat back, paying for
snacks and souvenirs to pass the time.</TE>
<TE>   The islanders are said to be talented fishermen, and they do turn
up in handsome skiffs with butterfly nets as tourist boats approach,
and then they draw near to collect tips. There are several smaller
populated islands in the lake, including Yunuen and Pacanda, some
with restaurants and lodgings. Next time I'll leave myself time to
try one of them.</TE>
<TE>   On other strolls in Patzcuaro, I circled the tiny Plazuela de San
Francisco, where Purepecha merchants assemble on Fridays to sell
pottery and other goods, and lingered at the Plazuela de la Basilica,
on the high ground outside the basilica. There, too, merchants often
turn up with snacks and religious items for sale.</TE>
<TE>   The attraction that caught my eye was across the street from the
basilica: the Hotel Posada La Basilica, a charming building with a
dozen rooms and rates (under $80 for a double room) less than I was
paying.</TE>
<TE>   I scrutinized the place so thoroughly from the sidewalk that a
pair of fellow American tourists invited me in, where I saw a
pleasant room and a restaurant that serves breakfast and lunch. Then,
on a landing that looks out over the city as it slopes toward the
lake, we saw a tiny cat tiptoeing across a roof-scape of red tiles.
And I thought: Here. Here is that smaller, slower Mexico.</TE>

<CP>PHOTO: How much for this room with a view? About $30, says
Fullerton reader Helen Kingsley, who took this photo in July from the
Hotel Tamaris on the Adriatic isle of Vis, part of Croatia. On the
peninsula in the distance is the campanile of a 16th century
Franciscan monastery. Kingsley was on Vis for a family wedding, which
ran all night. After the reception, she wearily climbed three flights
of stairs to her room just as the sun was rising. "I opened the
shutters," Kingsley says, "and there it was."</CP>

National Park</HD>

<BD>TIMES TRAVEL WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I would like to live Nevada Barr's life. She has traveled or lived in
some of the most beautiful corners of the country, and she has held
jobs that are my idea of glamorous.</LD>
<LD>   Barr has been an actress and a park ranger, and she is the author
of 10 mysteries set in national parks. To research them she visits
such places as Michigan's Isle Royale on Lake Superior, Carlsbad
Caverns in New Mexico and Mesa Verde in southwestern Colorado.</LD>
<LD>   Her most recent is "Hunting Season," about sex, masochism, murder
and mayhem along the Natchez Trace Parkway in Mississippi. I
particularly enjoyed "Blind Descent" (Putnam, 1998) because it takes
place in and around Lechuguilla Cave, a newly discovered underground
maze near Carlsbad Caverns, my favorite dark place. I read "Ill Wind"
(Putnam, 1995) on a trip to the ancient cliff dwellings of its Mesa
Verde setting and just finished "Blood Lure" (Putnam, 2001), a tale
about a mauling in Glacier National Park that wasn't done by any
bear.</LD>
<TE>   The gumshoe in these books wears hiking boots. She is Anna Pigeon,
a national park law enforcement officer stationed at the Natchez
Trace Parkway. In 1993 Barr, her creator, started working along the
historic, scenic corridor that runs about 450 miles from Nashville to
Natchez. Anna is like Barr in other ways too; both have sisters named
Molly to whom they can spill their souls, and both have firsthand
knowledge of professional theater, Barr as a struggling New York
actress in her salad days, Anna as an actor's widow. But Barr is an
ebullient best-selling author, while Anna has a passel of problems,
including loneliness, misanthropy and alcoholism. Still, Anna can
solve any murder Barr masterminds.</TE>
<TE>   Along the way, readers learn about the national parks, their
politics and bureaucracy, increasing crime in the wilderness, the
debate about fighting naturally ignited fires or letting them burn
and the long, twisted path that those who want a park service career
must follow. I asked Barr about that in a recent phone conversation
and got an earful. Here are some of the things she said:</TE>
<TE>   Question: Anna Pigeon lives in dumps, transient national park
housing. When you were a ranger did you get stuck in such places?</TE>
<TE>   Answer: When I was at Mesa Verde I was low and little, so I didn't
get to live in "the tower," a beautiful red stone building with a
turret set aside for researchers, when I was there. The best places
go to people who "homestead," or spend their whole career at a single
park. Promotions are hard to get if you homestead, though. Most
younger park employees know they're going to have to move if they
want to get ahead. And they're not paid much ... so they tend to live
like grad students.</TE>
<TE>   Q: How did you get into the park service from acting?</TE>
<TE>   A: I got interested in conservation. I was acting in Minneapolis
at the time, doing mostly radio voice-overs and industrial films. I
found I could work ... in the parks during the summer. I started in
1989 at Isle Royale in Michigan and was just sold on it. Then the
Guadalupe Mountains [in New Mexico and Texas] and two summers at Mesa
Verde. After that, in 1993, I got taken on full time as a law
enforcement officer at the Natchez Trace Parkway.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Were you interested in law enforcement?</TE>
<TE>   A: It was the best way to get a full-time job. In fact, I paid my
own way through emergency medical training and law enforcement
college. Later I found out that law enforcement officers in the
national park service get to do all the fun stuff: search and rescue,
emergency medicine, wildland firefighting.</TE>
<TE>   Q: When did you start writing?</TE>
<TE>   A: I started with a western, never published. Then I invented
Anna, and her first book, "Track of the Cat," came out in 1993. I
found I could write and be a park ranger at the same time. I just had
to get up earlier.</TE>
<TE>   Q: But you're no longer with the park service, right?</TE>
<TE>   A: I left in 1995. By then I needed time to promote the books. But
since I quit, I still spend two to five weeks in the parks doing
research. I hang around with rangers and sleep on their sofas. Most
of them have lists of people for me to kill off in my books.</TE>
<TE>   Q: So are you Anna?</TE>
<TE>   A: She was based on me, at the beginning. She was 38, working in
the Guadalupe Mountains and tracking mountain lions when I was, for
"Track of the Cat." But Anna's taller, smarter and braver than I.</TE>
<TE>   Q: And much more messed up, I suspect.</TE>
<TE>   A: [Laughs] I don't think I'm ever going to run out of neuroses
for Anna.</TE>
<TE>   Q: What a great idea, detective stories in national parks. How did
you come up with it?</TE>
<TE>   A: Pure dumb luck. Because I was there.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Anna Pigeon seldom has anything nice to say about park
visitors. She seems to think they ruin the parks.</TE>
<TE>   A: Anna is jaded. Not me. But think about it. When we wear clothes
we wreck them. There's nothing we can do about it, except exercise
constant vigilance.</TE>
<TE>   Q: And keep letting people in?</TE>
<TE>   A: Yes. They belong to us.</TE>

<HD>When Ties Are Unknotted</HD>
<DH>In 'We Were the Mulvaneys,' a family is capsized by grief.
Cast members dug deep to tap that painful emotion.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUSAN KING</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The cast and crew of "We Were the Mulvaneys" found it enlightening to
talk to Joyce Carol Oates before production began on Lifetime's
adaptation of her novel about a well-adjusted family that collapses
when the teenage daughter is raped.</LD>
<LD>   "She talked to us about 40 or 50 minutes and talked about where
the book came from," says director Peter Werner. "She talked about
each character, and it was almost freaky that after the 10 books
she's written since this book came out [in 1996], she was still zoned
completely in. She mentioned that it was based on two people she knew
who had been raped in a small town. One had left and never looked
back; the other stayed and committed suicide. She sort of put those
two people together."</LD>
<LD>   "Joyce Carol Oates writes really eloquently about the dark side,"
says Blythe Danner, who plays the Mulvaney matriarch, Corinne. "She
really writes about a kind of violent society--a society where she
grew up where a lot of these kind of things happened. She had been
molested. She has always written about a kind of brutality, but she
is such a sensitive soul. It's interesting to see it filtered with
her eyes."</LD>
<TE>   Set in the 1970s in a small town, "We Were the Mulvaneys" opens on
a family that's as near picture-perfect as possible. Corinne is the
loving mother of three sons and a daughter, sells antiques and looks
after their farm in upstate New York. Her charming husband, Michael
(Beau Bridges), who had survived a horrible childhood and a drinking
problem, is a successful builder.</TE>
<TE>   But their world falls apart when their bright, religious
15-year-old daughter, Marianne (Tammy Blanchard), gets drunk at the
high school prom and is raped by a popular football player. Unable to
cope with the violent incident, Michael starts drinking again. The
family finds itself unable to talk about the rape and sends Marianne
away to live with a relative. But rather than improving the
situation, her absence thrusts everyone further apart.</TE>
<TE>   Danner says Corinne was difficult for her to play because she
sends Marianne away. Corinne's "love of her husband must have been
stronger than for her children," the actress reasons. "She just
detached herself and went forward. Nobody thought of it as permanent,
but there was no discussion about bringing her back."</TE>
<TE>   Bridges believes there are lessons to be gleaned from the story.</TE>
<TE>   "We live in a very fast-moving, many times cruel environment," he
says. "So a family really needs to have their stuff together so when
the outside things happen, they can handle it. In this case, with
this family, they all do except for Dad. He is the collateral
damage."</TE>
<TE>   A father of four boys and a teenage daughter himself, Bridges
maintains that being a father is "the hardest task I have encountered
in my life. It is almost one of those impossible tasks to pull off,
and this guy, I think, he just shuts down because it was so important
for him to be secure, happy. That is all he wants. He really has
worked hard. He's compromised. All he desires and hopes and dreams is
to make money so he can buy this place, and when the outside world
crashes in, he's not prepared for it."</TE>
<TE>   The film, Bridges adds, also explores the healing power of
forgiveness and "how important it is and how difficult it is. All of
those characters all along the way have someone to forgive. Some of
them do and some of them don't."</TE>
<TE>   Blanchard, who won an Emmy as the young Judy Garland in ABC's
"Life With Judy Garland: Me and My Shadows," loved Marianne's
strength. The film, Blanchard says, shows "how true faith can get you
through anything, even if the pieces fall around you and your loved
ones crumble. You stand strong if you have something to stand with,
which is faith. She is just a special young woman."</TE>
<TE>   "We Were the Mulvaneys" can be seen Monday at 9 p.m. on Lifetime.
The network has rated it TV-14-V-L (may be unsuitable for children
younger than 14, with advisories for violence and coarse language).</TE>

<HD>Million-Dollar Kids' Smiles at Discount Rate</HD>
<DH>Volunteer dentists at the Tooth Fairy Cottage and Smile
Store educate and treat low-income South Bay children.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSE CARDENAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It wasn't your typical destination for a swarm of low-income
elementary school children on a field trip: a spacious house in a
quiet Inglewood neighborhood.</LD>
<LD>   Inside the Tooth Fairy Cottage, some kids flocked to the
microscopes--to examine the germs that thrive in dirty mouths. Others
visited a bathroom with six sinks, where they learned the basics of
brushing.</LD>
<LD>   Finally, the children walked across the street to another building
known as the Smile Store, where volunteer dentists examined their
teeth. Such is the itinerary on a field trip to the two facilities
that make up the Children's Dental Center.</LD>
<TE>   The nonprofit organization over the last five years has given
dental care to tens of thousands of mostly South Bay-area children
who don't have public or private insurance.</TE>
<TE>   The Children's Dental Center is the former private practice of an
Inglewood father-and-daughter team which she turned into a nonprofit
organization to treat children who otherwise might not receive care.</TE>
<TE>   James Sheets died a few years ago. But Cherilyn Sheets wanted to
give something back to the community where she, her father and an
uncle practiced dentistry for a combined 120 years.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a wonderful feeling," said Sheets, "to know that something
that represented so many years of work for your family has a new life
that will allow it to help children and families."</TE>
<TE>   The Tooth Fairy Cottage and Smile Store have also inspired similar
centers elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   Nonprofits designed after the Inglewood operation have opened in
Philadelphia and Spokane, Wash., and there are plans for one in
Orange County, where Sheets now practices.</TE>
<TE>   In planning Kids' Smiles in southwest Philadelphia, dentist Joseph
Greenberg visited Inglewood's center.</TE>
<TE>   "I had no doubt that Cherilyn would provide quality dentistry for
children," said Greenberg. "It was also the aspect that the program
would focus on the children's self-esteem."</TE>
<TE>   The Inglewood center had a long history before it took on its
present function.</TE>
<TE>   The Tooth Fairy Cottage is the former residence of the Sheets
family. And the Smile Store across the street is where, until the
mid-1980s, "Sheets and Sheets" practiced.</TE>
<TE>   When the older Sheets could not work anymore and the daughter
moved her office to Newport Beach, the family entrusted the Inglewood
house and practice to USC, which used it to train dentistry students.
When the university planned to sell it in 1992, the Sheetses bought
it back.</TE>
<TE>   Initially, the Sheetses reopened it as a practice for adults. But
soon, Cherilyn Sheets and Shirley Duff, the Sheetses' longtime office
manager, were pondering what else to do with the facilities.</TE>
<TE>   For her part, Sheets struggled to run both the Newport Beach and
Inglewood operations.</TE>
<TE>   Duff had a lingering thought that maybe the practice could be
reinvented to bring back children--a clientele the Sheetses had
served many years before.</TE>
<TE>   "I told her there were days I could just sit there at the desk and
suddenly I could remember when children would come in," said Duff.
"You had the laughing, yeah, sometimes the crying," but without them,
"the office had a void."</TE>
<TE>   A week later, Sheets called Duff and they talked for two hours
making plans to establish the Children's Dental Center. The idea
seemed perfect because the women also knew there were families in
modest South Bay neighborhoods who can't afford dental care.</TE>
<TE>   Even now, Duff cites national and local studies that say tooth
decay is an epidemic among children in poor communities.</TE>
<TE>   A South Bay hospital, Duff said, performed a study recently that
revealed that area children frequently show up at emergency rooms
seeking treatment for severe tooth problems.</TE>
<TE>   A typical day at the center finds parents bringing in
children--ranging in age from 3 to teenagers--for treatment.</TE>
<TE>   "It would be very hard for me to pay" a regular dentist, said
Elvira Ramirez, seeking treatment for son, Santos, 14.</TE>
<TE>   The children come mostly from nearby communities, such as
Inglewood, Torrance, Gardena, Watts and Willowbrook. But occasionally
they come from as far away as Palmdale. Duff said the families
typically are low-wage workers whose employers don't provide
insurance.</TE>
<TE>   For $25 a visit, children can get a variety of work that might
cost hundreds or thousands of dollars elsewhere, Duff said. For
complicated procedures, the center asks the family to pay a little
more.</TE>
<TE>   But treatment is just half the center's focus. The field trips
teach good dental habits and, judging by some handmade thank-you
cards the center received, the lessons often take.</TE>
<TE>   "Thank you for letting me come for free," wrote a girl named
Edith. "I'm glad you showed me more about my teeth."</TE>
<TE>   Duff and staff also visit schools, fairs and community events.
They hand out free toothbrushes and perform screenings, hoping the
children will come to the center for the actual work.</TE>
<TE>   The work at the center is performed by one staff dentist and
almost 30 private dentists from around the region who volunteer. A
$1.3-million budget from, among other sources, foundation and
corporate grants and individual contributions, pays for supplies,
facilities and the small staff.</TE>
<TE>   USC dentistry students and staff still come to the center to
practice their skills. They also find satisfaction in helping the
needy.</TE>
<TE>   Supervising a couple of students recently, Robert Keim, director
of orthodontics at USC, reflected on some of the children he has
helped treat.</TE>
<TE>   "Some of these kids are being teased because they have crooked
teeth," he said.</TE>
<TE>   He recalled a special surprise he received recently from a former
patient.</TE>
<TE>   "She came in last week," he said, "and thanked me for making her
pretty enough to get married."</TE>

<LD>Re "Union Pacific Blamed for Delays," March 13:</LD>
<LD>   What in the world is Metrolink thinking? Are they under the
misconception that this is a light-rail system? They're sure trying
to run it like one. It's impossible for big trains, including
Metrolink, to slow down, stop and get up to speed again every five
minutes to pick up passengers. Metrolink won't increase ridership
with the addition of all these stations. The result will be trains
taking longer than it does to drive. If Metrolink wants to run a
light-rail system, it should use the proper equipment. If Metrolink
wants to increase ridership,it must do something about the travel
time.</LD>

<TE>   Re "CenterLine Is No Solution to Traffic," March 10:</TE>
<TE>   The Orange County Transportation Authority has long trumpeted the
CenterLine as beneficial to the residents of Orange County. OCTA also
contends that mitigation efforts will reduce impacts on Orange County
residents. But, no matter how much reduction is achieved, it will be
worse unless the reduction is all the way to zero impact. Anything
less will leave Orange County worse off.</TE>

<HD>Safe Solution Offered to Dangerous Crosswalk</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>There is a crosswalk at the corner of East Stratford and Bradford,
where the cities of Fullerton and Placentia meet.</LD>
<LD>   It is used by a Fullerton grade school, Placentia High School and
a couple of retirement groups. If Placentia installed one stop sign
for northbound traffic and Fullerton installed one for southbound
traffic, it would ensure the safety of many.</LD>
<LD>   I have seen, on several occasions, a vehicle stopped at the
crosswalk and then another vehicle swerve around that stopped
vehicle, just missing those pedestrians. I hope this call for an
inexpensive solution will not come after an injury or death. Please
help these people. Even from the cold economic viewpoint, it would be
very expensive to both cities because we know it is a hazard.</LD>

<LD>The Salvation Army's adult rehabilitation centers help thousands of
mostly younger people every year stay away from drugs and alcohol to
begin recovery. For this they are to be commended. But an almost
equal number are not helped because they fall victim to the Salvation
Army's overly restrictive rules. So there's the Salvation Army, so
close to God and so far from being as helpful as they easily could
be. What a shame.</LD>

<LD>Re "Peter Biehl, 59; Forgave Killers of Daughter," obituary, April 2:</LD>
<LD>   I was so saddened to read of the death of Peter Biehl. His passing
at such a young age is a loss to a world so caught up in a spiral of
violence, hatred and revenge. Since the death of their daughter, Amy,
the Biehls' response of forgiveness and love has been a shining
beacon for me. Revenge begets more violence and hatred. . May his
example live on in other lives.</LD>

<LD>Re "Overturn Assessment Ruling," Feb. 17:</LD>
<LD>   I strongly disagree with Mark S. Gaughan, chairman of the Orange
County Taxpayers Assn., , and his stance on "recapturing" of our
property taxes. The judge's ruling appears to be correct inasmuch as
Proposition 13 does not permit recapturing. This major increase came
as a severe blow to most residential property owners because it came
with no warning. I believe in paying fair property taxes, but not in
gouging and not when it doesn't conform with existing law. It is my
hope that this ruling will not be challenged and that our
overpayments will be rectified.</LD>

<HD>Proposition 13: What It Says and Means</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I have just finished reading Robert A. Pool's March 10 article, "A
Property Tax Refund May Be Yours." It's about whether assessed values
under Proposition 13 can be increased annually more than 2%.</LD>
<LD>   A response is in order. I'm a semi-retired appraiser for the
Orange County assessor. However, I write as an individual and not as
a spokesperson for the department.</LD>
<LD>   Pool asserts that the debate hinges on Section 2(b) of Proposition
13 (now Article XIII A of the California Constitution). As he
indicates, that section reads: "The full cash value base may reflect
from year to year the inflationary rate not to exceed 2% for any
given year ... or may be reduced to reflect ... a decline in value."
Pool complains that nobody focuses on the plain wording of the
constitution.</LD>
<TE>   He says there are two questions to be asked: May the full cash
value base be reduced? If it's reduced, may the full cash value base
be increased more than 2% per year?</TE>
<TE>   Three more questions need to be asked. The first: What is the
meaning of the term "full cash value base"? Article XIII A tells us
if we go back to its beginning.</TE>
<TE>   Section 1(a) limits the tax rate to be applied to a property's
"full cash value." Section 1(b) says that the tax rate limitation
shall not apply to charges for paying off bonded indebtedness.</TE>
<TE>   Section 2(a)--which, interestingly, Pool declines to focus
on--defines full cash value: "The 'full cash value' means the county
assessor's valuation of real property as shown on the 1975-76 tax
bill under 'full cash value' or, thereafter, the appraised value of
real property when purchased, newly constructed, or a change in
ownership has occurred after the 1975 assessment."</TE>
<TE>   Then comes Section 2(b), with its term "full cash value base." The
second additional question I propose is to Pool: For properties that
have changed ownership since 1975, under what standard of
interpretation can "full cash value base" refer to something besides
the previously mentioned "full cash value," that is, "the appraised
value of property when purchased, newly constructed, or a change in
ownership has occurred after the 1975 assessment"?</TE>
<TE>   The third question I propose is an obvious follow-up: According to
the plain language of the state Constitution, what value may reflect
from year to year the inflationary rate not to exceed 2% for any
given year? Not an assessed value that has been "held" because of a
flat real estate market. Not an assessed value that has been reduced
to reflect a decline in market value. It's the full cash value
base--as defined in Section 2(a).</TE>
<TE>   As I understand it, the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Assn. has agreed
with the interpretation of the Orange County assessor in this matter.
That association--or its predecessor--drafted the Proposition 13
ballot initiative. In light of that, what more needs to be said about
the proposition's original meaning and intent?</TE>
<TE>   If the assessor formally concludes that the judge in the court
case erred in his decision, the department has the right to appeal
the ruling.</TE>

not to mention U.S. labor law. Clearly there is strong relationship
between the supply of tomato pickers and wages. However, growers
often manipulate wages by offering more pay or work than is
available. Hungry workers take what they can get, a fact not lost on
the growers. Just as important, when the tomato crop fails, the
workers pay the biggest price, unemployment.</LD>
<LD>   It is unfair for Concannon to criticize below-the-poverty-level
workers for taking time off for collective action. Americans have a
right to collective bargaining, not to mention freedom of speech.</LD>
<TE>   Concannon was right in one respect. The large number of illegal
workers, which is supported politically by big business looking to
keep labor costs down, is a big factor in low wages.</TE>
<TE>   Control of illegal immigration would raise the wages of U.S.
workers. That's why there will never be reform. The politicians
represent the interests of those who put them in power--big business.</TE>

flags goes against everything that this country stands for. I
encourage every American to write your local congressman and sign
petitions. I am a firm believer in freedom of speech, but the

<HD>The Real Motives in Kline Ballot Fight?</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Board to Fight Kline's Pullout," March 26:</LD>
<LD>   I voted for John Adams, a man about whom I knew very little, in
the primary election, but I have been disappointed with his actions
since the election. The county Board of Supervisors' attempt to keep
Superior Court Judge Ronald C. Kline's name on the ballot smacks less
of a genuine desire to preserve a legal principle than of an attempt
to secure the easiest opponent for Adams in November.</LD>
<LD>   Supervisor Todd Spitzer ought to have recused himself in this
matter, since he publicly endorsed Adams. If Kline wants to get off
the ballot, then let the voters choose between the two highest
write-in candidates, rather than between Adams and a candidate whom
virtually no one now wants.</LD>
<TE>   Spitzer said that he doesn't want to create a precedent of
dropping candidates from the ballot. Either he is lacking in candor
or else is forgetting the election of Scott Baugh to the Assembly.
Has he ever heard of Haydee Tillotson? She "voluntarily" quit the
special election race a few weeks before election day after a "little
powwow" with her party's leaders. It was too late to remove her name
from the ballot, but the party leaders got what they wanted. So, the
precedent already exists.</TE>

<HD>Views on Simon's Role, Other El Toro Matters</HD>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "New Leadership for El Toro," editorial, March 24:</LD>
<LD>   I agree with The Times' editorial. Gary Simon's self-serving reply
was that of a drowning person helplessly clutching at a straw. He has
the temerity and arrogance to boast that, as executive director of
the Local Redevelopment Authority, he and his staff have "an
extraordinary bank of knowledge to draw upon."</LD>
<LD>   Are we dumb enough to think that such knowledge and expertise are
a one-track locomotive headed toward building a destructive airport
right in the center of Orange County? What we need is a new group of
experts. And we need not look any further because Irvine has such a
staff.</LD>
<TE>   Dan Jung is the director of special programs and has concentrated
solely on the development of a Great Park at El Toro. His staff has
in place a complete plan for the Orange County Central Park and other
amenities, including educational institutions, athletic fields, a
veterans memorial park, museums, hiking trails, golf courses, etc.</TE>
<TE>   Simply put, if you are going to have a heart transplant, would you
hire a lawyer to do it?</TE>

<TE>   Re "Lawsuit Targets El Toro Use Vote," March 19:</TE>
<TE>   Desperate pro-airport groups are throwing away even more money on
frivolous lawsuits. Their latest lawsuit challenging the successful
Measure W argues that the Board of Supervisors has the sole authority
to plan the conversion of the 4,700-acre base.</TE>
<TE>   In the unlikely event they prevail in court, they should consider
this: Chris Norby joins the board in January 2003. Then the
anti-airport majority could comply with the latest lawsuit argument
by completely killing the airport--again.</TE>
<TE>   Mike Baron</TE>
<TE>   Aliso Viejo</TE>
<TE>   Re "El Toro Rivals Now Eye New Plan," March 13:</TE>
<TE>   The article says Gary Simon, who heads the county's El Toro team,
would just as energetically fulfill a different county project at the
closed military base. "This very scenario was discussed when I was
hired," said Simon. "(But) I serve at the board's pleasure."</TE>
<TE>   Yeah, right! Gary Simon is the last person who should be in charge
of anything having to do with planning the Great Park. He has always
been one of its chief critics and a pawn for pro-airport forces. The
person charged with planning the Great Park should be one with the
necessary vision and passion for a project that is intended to be our
legacy for future generations.</TE>
<TE>   This is not about vindictiveness. It's about common sense.
Clearly, Gary Simon is not the right person for the job.</TE>
<TE>   Sergio Prince</TE>

<TE>   Re "El Toro's Future," March 9:</TE>
<TE>   Barbara Lichman of the Airport Working Group already has decided
to sue and get Measure W thrown out. She believes that it is
unconstitutional for the public to vote on land-use issues. Wouldn't
this then mean that Measure A, which zoned El Toro for an airport in
1994, also would be unconstitutional?</TE>
<TE>   Someone please tell Lichman that the people have spoken and they
do not want an airport. The Navy can sell the property off in parcels
to the highest bidder, and the county can get on to the more pressing
issues: education, housing and health care. It is time to put the
attorneys away and do what is best for Orange County, not the Airport
Working Group.</TE>
<TE>   Ashley Banta</TE>
<TE>   Fullerton</TE>
<TE>   Now that Chris Norby has soundly defeated El Toro airport advocate
Cynthia P. Coad, it's time for the rest of the elected public
officials to take note. We are watching and will continue to exercise
our democratic duty to elect officials who truly listen and represent
the will of the people. In this regard, we challenge our
representatives to become imaginative and present us with
alternatives to an overburdened air transport system. Europe and
Japan, for example, with a population more compacted than ours, make
good use of advanced train systems.</TE>
<TE>   A significant portion of our transportation needs could be
addressed by trains, which also would relieve air travel congestion.
Trains also would provide jobs, be environmentally friendly and offer
the traveling public a realistic alternative to air travel.</TE>
<TE>   Hans Roehricht</TE>
<TE>   Lake Forest</TE>
<TE>   The fatal flaw was the passage of Measure A, which resulted in the
hijacking of the well-planned Local Redevelopment Authority. Newport
Beach special interests, led by George Argyros and pro-airport
supervisors, hurried Measure A onto the ballot in 1994. The blatant
and obvious misrepresentations of the pro-airport campaigning
infuriate those of us directly affected by the proposed airport. The
end result is that the authority was replaced by a pro-airport gang.</TE>
<TE>   It's time for Orange County to get on with the conversion and
other pressing issues. If we do so, we may still obtain El Toro as a
"gift," in which case the county will sell parcels instead of the
Navy. I don't care who sells it. I am quite happy that an additional
14,000 acres are now available for parks, recreation and open space
that weren't there a few weeks ago.</TE>
<TE>   The people have spoken. They were sick and tired of the wasted tax
money that was spent in advertising the airport program. We don't
need or want another airport in Orange County. Measure W is a win for
the will of the people.</TE>
<TE>   Dan Hile</TE>
<TE>   Laguna Niguel</TE>
<TE>   As a native Orange County resident living in Kentucky, I have
watched the battle over the proposed airport. Over the years I have
seen the Board of Supervisors and the development consortium be
granted pet project after project. I applaud the citizens of Orange
County for stopping this latest potential disaster. What a display of
your citizenship.</TE>
<TE>   Robert Werner</TE>
<TE>   Louisville, Ky.</TE>
<TE>   I am insulted. What is this "will of the people" I keep hearing
about regarding Measure W? The March 5 vote on Measure W did not
speak for me. I voted no on W and would gladly do it again.</TE>
<TE>   The Measure W vote spoke for voters who are concerned about
property values, and who chose to hide behind the environmental
argument. Southern California is growing, and Orange County is
growing even faster.</TE>
<TE>   The majority of voters saw fit to green-light a pork-barrel park
and allow LAX and John Wayne Airport to handle air traffic. But when
it becomes obvious that an airport at El Toro would have been a
better choice than a 4,700-acre park, those of us who voted no on W
will have the loudest of last laughs. What a tangled web they weave,
when the park proponents set out to deceive.</TE>

<LD>Re "Plans for Base Link Mayor, Irvine Co.," March 31:</LD>
<LD>   The implication that Irvine Mayor Larry Agran was bought by the
Irvine Co. to fight for the Great Park is most remarkable for its
foolishness and prejudice! Unlike Supervisor Chuck Smith and his ilk,
we, the people, agree with Agran. Those who come after us deserve one
of the great metropolitan parks of the world. And to get it, the
public sector and the private sector, including the Irvine Co., must
work together in the spirit of goodwill.</LD>

<LD>Re "Ex-O.C. Deputy D.A. Is Freed," March 19:</LD>
<LD>   I was a law enforcement official involved in the investigation of
former Orange County Deputy Dist. Atty. Bryan Kazarian. We know this
intelligent, articulate ex-prosecutor passed confidential and
potentially life-threatening information to his associates, including
a known drug dealer. Some of the information was transferred on a
county telephone from an office in the Orange County district
attorney's office.</LD>
<LD>   During his court appearance, Kazarian referred to "those who think
I put them in danger." Well, Mr. Kazarian, your betrayal of your
oath, the release of confidential information and your actions did
jeopardize the safety of many law enforcement personnel.</LD>
<TE>   One can only hope that Orange County Dist. Atty. Tony Rackauckas
will launch an immediate investigation. Had Kazarian been a police
officer instead of an attorney, would he be free today?</TE>

<HD>Teaching Tolerance and Respect in Schools</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Tolerance Is Stressed, Educators Insist," March 13:</LD>
<LD>   Although Huntington Beach Mayor Debbie Cook insists schools need
to do a better job of teaching respect for diversity, it's clear that
it is the responsibility of parents to teach respect for diversity,
and the responsibility of the schools and churches to support
parents. In fact, schools are required to suspend students who commit
hate crimes as defined by the California State Education Code.</LD>
<LD>   Cook states, "We don't teach [tolerance]." As part of the Safe
Schools Task Force in Huntington Beach, police officers, parents and
educators developed a matrix of all the programs offered in the
schools that relate to tolerance education, violence prevention and
drug abuse. Principals provided information to the city's Human
Relations Task Force regarding tolerance education programs in city
schools. Perhaps Cook, who voted to eliminate funding for DARE, was
unaware that one component of DARE is tolerance education.</LD>
<TE>   Ocean View School District middle schools have implemented a
tolerance education program in collaboration with the Orange County
Human Relations Council.</TE>
<TE>   The hate crime committed by the three youths was horrific.
However, let's place blame where it belongs, with those who committed
the crime.</TE>
<TE>   Elizabeth Williams</TE>
<TE>   Huntington Beach</TE>
<TE>   In connection with the hate-related attack of an Asian American
store manager by three teenagers, I commented that the schools could
do more to build tolerance. I also said that the churches and
synagogues could do more to teach respect, and that civic
associations could do more to teach understanding toward those who
are different. I concluded by saying that we needed to look at all of
the institutions for ways we could do more to build understanding
between our diverse residents, because even one hate crime is too
many.</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately, part of my comments were paired with a criticism of
the Ocean View schools that I totally disagree with. I never
discussed the Ocean View School District and didn't at the time know
whether any of the teenagers charged were from that district. I did
indicate that we would be happy to work with any school affected by
this incident to build better relations among diverse students.</TE>
<TE>   Our organization has worked in the Ocean View, Huntington Beach
City and Huntington Beach Union High School districts for many years
to build understanding through BRIDGES, our School Interethnic
Relations Program. These school districts have made substantive
efforts to build understanding among their increasingly diverse
students.</TE>
<TE>   I meant only to challenge all in our society to do more until we
are truly a community where all people are welcomed and included.</TE>

<DH>Education: Santa Ana's science and arts academy is
producing bilingual elementary school pupils.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENNY DOH and CYNTHIA CRIOLLOS</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Santa Ana recently made national news when the U.S. Census Bureau
announced that this urban community has the largest percentage of
Spanish-speaking people among cities with populations of 250,000 and
above. As one of the 100 largest cities in the country, Santa Ana is
also known for its youthful population, with a median age of 26.5
years.</LD>
<LD>   These realities, combined with many residents' low incomes and low
levels of educational completion rates, create a need to develop an
outside-the-box approach to education. El Sol, a new science and arts
academy, opened its doors last September with an approach that
promises to shine a ray of hope on Santa Ana.</LD>
<LD>   On Thursday, officials from UC Irvine, the Santa Ana Unified
School District and the city will gather at the El Sol campus to
celebrate the school's first-year achievements. A K-8 charter school,
El Sol offers academic excellence through its English/Spanish
dual-immersion curriculum, high learning expectations, talented
teachers and partnership with parents.</LD>
<TE>   El Sol recruits 50% of its student body from English-speaking
families and 50% from Spanish-speaking families, and is being
developed in phases, with 120 kindergarten and first-grade students
now.</TE>
<TE>   Development of excellent schools in urban settings like Santa Ana
requires partnerships where resources, know-how, and goodwill are
shared. Less than two years ago, the El Sol concept was brought
before the members of the Santa Ana Board of Education, which had the
courage to embrace the concept and help make the dream come true.</TE>
<TE>   A friend of El Sol, Jack Peltason, former UC Irvine chancellor,
views the school as an "educational model that cultivates academic
success, leadership development and an awareness of the complex
challenges of our diverse community."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, this is a popular view among a growing number of friends,
who are helping the campus' vision become fully realized. Ultimately,
El Sol's success will depend on continued development of strong
partnerships.</TE>
<TE>   UC Irvine is one such partner. The university is helping train El
Sol parents to support children academically. The program, Make It
New, coaches parents on ways to renew their kids' motivation about
learning. Because some parents have more experience and education
than others, the program's parent mentorship component provides
support to those who need greater confidence and skills to support
their children.</TE>
<TE>   It makes sense for a Santa Ana school to offer dual-language
immersion, which instructs students in all subjects in two languages,
so that students become fully bilingual. Not only do 74% of its
residents speak Spanish, but 15% do not speak English at all.</TE>
<TE>   Pragmatism aside, however, El Sol's model is based on logic,
because research of similar programs demonstrates the dual-immersion
model's success throughout the world.</TE>
<TE>   There are about 300,000 students in English/French immersion
programs in Canada. Consensus exists among applied linguists about
the benefits of well-implemented dual-immersion programs. Almost 150
studies since the early 1960s testing a variety of aptitudes report
advantages for bilingual students.</TE>
<TE>   As parents, we believe that linguistic isolation carries the
potential for one of the greatest social, academic and professional
disadvantages.</TE>
<TE>   Within a few months, we have witnessed our previously monolingual
English-speaking children start to acquire a second language, and in
the process learn that the "others" have something to teach and give,
just as much as they do.</TE>
<TE>   We are frequently asked, "What about after El Sol? Where will your
children go after eighth grade?" Our response is usually, "Where
won't they be able to go?" El Sol is creating scholars with an
emphasis in the sciences and arts. They just happen to be doing it in
two languages.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, some of our graduates may elect to attend local high
schools, both public and private, and undoubtedly, many who get
sparked by El Sol's arts component will compete for enrollment in
Orange County's High School for the Arts.</TE>
<TE>   If you pass the corner of Broadway and Halesworth Street, just
north of 10th Street, you may notice El Sol's school logo on a
Victorian house, now transformed into the school's administrative
offices.</TE>
<TE>   It is a corner where courageous people have pledged their support
to grow a campus prepared to meet the complex urban challenges of its
community.</TE>
<TE>   It is a corner where students are rigorously challenged, and where
parents are partners in the educational journey.</TE>
<TE>   It is a corner where you can feel the sun's rays transforming
possibilities into probabilities, making each day gloriously new.</TE>

<HD>A Mideast Miracle Requires Our Will</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BENJAMIN J. HUBBARD</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I was 7 years old when told of the armistice. Grandpa's troop ship
had turned around in the middle of the ocean, my mother explained,
"because of the armistice," and he didn't have to fight in World War
I.</LD>
<LD>   "But what's an armistice?" I asked. She thought for a moment and
replied, "It's when all the soldiers laid down their guns and stopped
fighting."</LD>
<LD>   My child's mind envisioned rifles and pistols falling from the
hands of thousands of soldiers, as if some mysterious power had made
them do so. Now, more than half a century later while painfully
reflecting on the Israeli-Palestinian agony, I've recalled that scene
and am praying for another armistice.</LD>
<TE>   How quaint: as if the hundred-year struggle over this ancient,
treasured turf--this Canaan, Judea, Palestine, Israel--will end with
a miracle. But it needs a miracle, an armistice, so that I might tell
my grandchildren that Israeli soldiers and Palestinian fighters laid
down their arms and stopped killing one another.</TE>
<TE>   So how will my miracle happen? To begin, everyone who loves or
feels compassion for the Israelis and Palestinians and wants them to
live in peace must resolve never to give up trying--in whatever way
imaginable--to foster reconciliation no matter how long it takes.
Some will pray, others will entreat leaders and their advisors on
both sides through phone calls, letters, e-mails and in person, to
step back from the mutual madness that has gripped the region and its
people.</TE>
<TE>   Still others will urge the Bush administration to get more
involved, for only America has the influence to break the bloody
stalemate. Key individuals in America--Jews, Arabs, Muslims--will
need to tell their counterparts in Israel-Palestine that only painful
compromises will produce a solution.</TE>
<TE>   For example, many of the Israeli settlements, especially in the
Gaza Strip, will have to be dismantled. And the Palestinian demand
for a right of return to former homes or property in what is now
Israel will have to be recognized, even if the most feasible
long-term solution may be monetary compensation.</TE>
<TE>   The United States, Europeans, Saudis and other Persian Gulf states
will need to craft an economic recovery plan for the region,
especially Palestine. (A Mideast common market could eventually rival
Europe's.) The Israelis, Palestinians and Syrians will need to
cooperate, in particular, on finding enough water for long-term
survival. Additionally, the Palestinian refugee camps must be
dismantled and new homes and lives created for their inhabitants.</TE>
<TE>   The Palestinians must cease terror by suicide and their "death to
Israel" mind-set, and the Arab world cease its cruel anti-Semitic
rhetoric. Israel also must reach back into history and remember how
it feels to be an occupied nation, as Palestine is today. The Romans
held Judea and Galilee in a hundred-year grip until the revolt of AD
66-70 led to the destruction of the second temple and the end of
Jewish statehood for nearly 1,900 years.</TE>
<TE>   There are faint flickers of hope even now after the "Passover
massacre" in Natanya and the locking up of Yasser Arafat like a caged
bird in Ramallah. At the very time this worst of massacres occurred,
the Arab League unanimously accepted the peace plan of Saudi Prince
Abdullah that would grant recognition of Israel by all 21 Arab
nations in exchange for Israeli withdrawal to pre-1967 borders and
some sort of redress for Palestinian refugees. It is a vague and
imperfect plan but a start.</TE>
<TE>   Will Palestinian and other Arab hard-liners ever give up their
desire to possess all of geographical Palestine?</TE>
<TE>   Not for the foreseeable future.</TE>
<TE>   Will Israeli zealots ever want less than all of Biblical Israel?</TE>
<TE>   Again, not for a generation. Will the Israelis ever be able to
trust the Palestinians and the Arab world generally? Not for a long
time, perhaps never.</TE>
<TE>   But peace rests on guarantees and mutual benefits. Trust may
follow eventually.</TE>
<TE>   The skeptics will scoff at this dream of a Mideast armistice, of
peace after all the wars. "It's all been tried before," they will
say. But it's never been tried enough. Peace will emerge, weapons
will fall from the hands of soldiers, if we really will it.</TE>

<LD>Advertising agencies are paid to create smartly turned slogans to
influence what we eat, drink and wear. It's not surprising that, in
this advertising age, Santa Ana is unveiling a new motto designed to
polish the image of the county's most populous city.</LD>
<LD>   Santa Ana for years has proclaimed itself as the "Education First"
city. That slogan will be replaced next year by "Santa Ana: The
Spirit of Change," a slogan crafted by DGWB, an advertising agency
that operates from the old Santa Ana City Hall on North Main Street.
The agency, which moved to Santa Ana from Irvine, creates advertising
for the likes of Wienerschnitzel, KFC and South Coast Plaza.</LD>
<LD>   DGWB clearly wants to do right by its adopted home. But it's
difficult for a few words to capture the essence of a hot dog chain
or a bucket of chicken. How can a slogan that's supposed to fit on a
city sign do justice to Santa Ana, the seat of Orange County
government, home to many of the region's oldest buildings and,
despite its reputation, one of the safest cities of its size in the
country?</LD>
<TE>   Santa Ana undoubtedly could shout that it is "new and improved!"
What works for detergents and breakfast cereals, though, is
simplistic in a municipality. Civic branding campaigns must pass
muster with elected officials who, by their nature, view their
hometown through rose-colored glasses. Slogans must resonate with
old-timers who know the city's warts, yet be attractive enough to
lure newcomers. By emphasizing adventure and change, Santa Ana's new
slogan is designed to highlight its redevelopment efforts and
celebrate its diversity.</TE>
<TE>   Slogans shouldn't be too narrow. Simi Valley last year rejected a
proposed label as host city to the Ronald Reagan Library and Museum.
Municipalities shouldn't bend the truth. A citizen's group in Costa
Mesa recently suggested that the landlocked city enhance its
geography by tacking "by-the-sea" to its name.</TE>
<TE>   And no matter how powerful the slogan, cities don't have the funds
needed to be heard in a society awash in radio jingles, television
commercials and billboards.</TE>
<TE>   Civic slogans do serve a purpose. Cities constantly court
free-spending visitors and dangle tax incentives in front of
companies looking for new homes. Misperceptions can cloud reality, so
Santa Ana understandably wants to use every tool available to tell
its story.</TE>

<LD>A recent state report on a fatal accident in September at Knott's
Berry Farm serves as a wake-up call for the local amusement park and
a report card for others on the state's 2-year-old legislation
designed to improve theme park safety.</LD>
<LD>   The state Department of Occupational Safety and Health was right
to insist on review and changes in the Perilous Plunge ride and a new
training program for park employees as a condition of reopening the
ride.</LD>
<LD>   An attraction billed as the world's steepest and highest flume
ride may quicken the hearts of thrill seekers, but the public has an
obvious interest in having such an attraction be safe as well.</LD>
<TE>   The Sept. 21 accident, in which a 40-year-old Duarte woman who
weighed 292 pounds flew out of the ride, raised questions about the
adequacy of safety restraints, as well as park standards and
oversight.</TE>
<TE>   The department has the authority to investigate accidents and
order safety changes under the provisions of the 2000 state law,
which was enacted after years of haggling between the theme park
industry and consumer advocates. How each accident is investigated
becomes a test of how well served the public is as the new
legislation plays out. In this instance, the department appears to
have done a credible job of enforcement and standard-setting, which
should bolster public confidence in subsequent cases that come before
it for review.</TE>
<TE>   In its investigation, the department went so far as to question
whether the problems with the ride's safety restraints were
restricted only to the weight of the rider, which was the focus of
much of the initial inquiry. The ride has an individual T-shaped lap
bar, a seat belt, and a separate grab bar. The department's review
expressed misgivings about the adequacy of the restraint system and
the placement of the restraints, which allowed a person to slip out
of the ride.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators also found that there were no written instructions
from the manufacturer for handling passengers whose physical
characteristics might affect their safety.</TE>
<TE>   The early reaction of Knott's Berry Farm was encouraging. It
called the report fair and thorough, and said it would do whatever it
took to make the ride safe. That included insisting that the
manufacturer take necessary steps to improve the safety of
restraints.</TE>
<TE>   What's clear from this and other recent cases is that ride safety
at amusement parks is influenced by how conscientious several
interested parties within the industry are, and how well they work
together to advance safety. Manufacturers must provide good, safe
restraints and be willing to modify them when necessary. They must
give clear instructions and training to operators, and operators must
ensure that the ride operators are well-trained. Finally, consumers
have a role to play themselves in not making choices that may put
their health and safety at risk.</TE>
<TE>   It's too bad that reform and change come after and not before a
tragedy occurs. But if the reforms are inching along, and if it has
taken far too long to get to this point, at least there is some
progress.</TE>
<TE>   For too long, the risk was dumped on the customer, without
adequate oversight or review by the state. One lesson from the
experience of this ride may be that a different kind of ride harness
is needed, and that there have to be more restrictions on who is
allowed to ride.</TE>
<TE>   This kind of fine-tuning ultimately can lead to a safer and more
fun experience for the consumer.</TE>

<HD>County's Piers Deserve Care</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Orange County's piers largely are taken for granted until a
relentless Pacific Ocean storm batters one into submission. Ask the
regulars who frequented the Aliso Beach Pier before it was dismantled
after a severe El Nino storm.</LD>
<LD>   But not everyone is inattentive. Newport Beach should be
congratulated for using court settlement funds from the 1990 American
Trader oil tanker spill to fund a $3.1-million refurbishing of the
Newport and Balboa piers. The city regularly maintains the piers that
were built in 1940 in order to keep pace with damage caused by ocean
waves and marine organisms that bore into wooden piles, weakening
them.</LD>
<LD>   The city closed its piers for about two months this past winter to
complete much-needed overhauls. The graceful structures now sport
thicker, reinforced concrete decks, new electrical wiring and water
and sewer pipes. Crews are finishing access ramps for the disabled on
the Newport Pier, capping utility conduits and applying other
finishing touches.</LD>
<TE>   The official reopening ceremony won't be held until June, but the
piers already are back in business.</TE>
<TE>   On a recent overcast morning, Minnesotan Joan Mancl and her family
spent about an hour wandering from one end of the Newport Pier to the
other. The family stood wide-eyed in front of a huge crab a fisherman
had pulled from the cold waters.</TE>
<TE>   That sense of awe should be enough to justify the expense of
building and maintaining Orange County's five piers (Seal Beach,
Huntington Beach, San Clemente and the two structures in Newport
Beach). Piers clearly offer a unique form of public access to the
ocean that defines so much of life in California.</TE>
<TE>   Piers, though, are more than a picturesque perch for fishermen and
sunset aficionados. They're integral parts of the economic engine
that powers Orange County's tourism industry. When local piers are
closed because of damage, nearby restaurants, bait stores and
souvenir shops feel the pain.</TE>
<TE>   Money is tight when it comes to keeping piers repaired, and, in
the case of Aliso Beach, replacing failed structures.</TE>
<TE>   Maintenance is largely a local issue, so it must be disconcerting
to public officials that El Nino, the weather phenomenon that stirred
up massive storms in the 1990s, is showing signs of awakening after a
four-year slumber.</TE>
<TE>   The California Coastal Conservancy, which in the past has raised
and distributed funds to repair piers in Huntington Beach, Malibu and
San Francisco, reports that "from San Diego's Ocean Beach Pier
through to Orange County and Los Angeles, the need is still there for
pier repair dollars."</TE>
<TE>   Through their appreciation, out-of-towners underscore the need for
Orange County cities to care for and maintain their signature piers.
When asked what the Newport Pier symbolized, one recent visitor
surveyed the nearby shoreline, and the distant horizon before
concluding: "It just feels like freedom." Locals need to cultivate a
similar sense of wonder, and back it with a commitment to maintaining
these waterfront treasures.</TE>

<HD>Louis Heyward, 81; Created 'Winky Dink'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DENNIS McLELLAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Louis "Deke" Heyward, an award-winning writer and producer for radio,
television and movies who created "Winky Dink and You" in the
1950s--the first interactive TV show--died of complications from
pneumonia March 26 in Los Angeles. He was 81.</LD>
<LD>   In a career that began in the early '50s, when he joined
television's "The Garry Moore Show" as a staff writer, Heyward wrote
for many New York-based TV programs.</LD>
<LD>   In 1956, while head writer of "The Ernie Kovacs Show," he won a
Sylvania Award for comedy writing.</LD>
<TE>   But in 1953, Heyward made TV history with his creation of "Winky
Dink and You," a partially animated Saturday morning children's show
with in-studio host Jack Berry.</TE>
<TE>   The gimmick: Young viewers at home could help the cartoon
character Winky Dink--a large-headed boy with a shock of blond
hair--and his dog Woofer out of their predicaments.</TE>
<TE>   For 50 cents, viewers could send away for a Winky Dink Kit, which
included a "magic screen"--a piece of clear, clingy plastic they
placed on their TV screens--and "magic" crayons.</TE>
<TE>   If Winky Dink and Woofer were stuck on the side of a rushing
stream, for example, those viewers with "magic screens" could draw a
bridge for them to cross over.</TE>
<TE>   Winky Dink was a hit with baby boomers, some of whom apparently
didn't have 50 cents for a "magic screen" and drew directly on their
TV screens.</TE>
<TE>   The show ran for many years in syndication.</TE>
<TE>   In the late '50s, Heyward served briefly as producer of "The Dick
Clark Saturday Night Beechnut Show," a derivative of Clark's popular
daytime "American Bandstand."</TE>
<TE>   "I looked up to him," Clark said.</TE>
<TE>   "He not only became my mentor, but was one of the most adaptable
and versatile gentlemen I met in my life. He was involved in all
kinds of projects all his life and never lost his enthusiasm."</TE>
<TE>   In 1961, Heyward became director of development for 20th Century
Fox Television. Two years later, he became vice president of
production for American International Pictures.</TE>
<TE>   During his 10 years at AIP, he produced 25 pictures, including
"Murder in the Rue Morgue," "The Girl From Rio" and "War, Italian
Style."</TE>
<TE>   He also wrote "Pajama Party," "Ghost in the Invisible Bikini,"
"Spy in Your Eye" and "Bang, Bang, You're Dead," among others.</TE>
<TE>   In the '70s, Heyward served briefly as vice president of
development for Four Star Films, and then became a senior vice
president at Hanna-Barbera, where he was in charge of live
programming and movies of the week.</TE>
<TE>   Among his projects was the Emmy Award-winning "The Gathering," a
1977 television movie starring Ed Asner and Maureen Stapleton.</TE>
<TE>   In 1980, Heyward rejoined Barry &amp; Enright, the company that had
produced "Winky Dink and You," as vice president of development.</TE>
<TE>   During his 12 years there, he was instrumental in relaunching the
game shows "Twenty-One" and "Tic Tac Dough."</TE>
<TE>   Born in New York City in 1920, Heyward studied at New York
University and Brooklyn Law School before enlisting in the Army Air

and Europe.</TE>
<TE>   In 1947, he went to work for the Associated Press as a senior
editor in the radio transcription division and wrote scripts for
various radio shows.</TE>
<TE>   In his later years, Heyward served as a consultant for DIC
Entertainment, a children's entertainment company headed by his son,
Andy, creator of "Inspector Gadget."</TE>
<TE>   "The thing he was probably most proud of was something that had
nothing to do with his professional life," Andy Heyward said.</TE>
<TE>   Three days a week for the last three years, Louis Heyward taught
writing at Camp Kilpatrick, a Los Angeles County Probation Department
facility.</TE>
<TE>   He also taught writing for Rushmore University, an Internet-based

<CX>   Heyward obituary--An April 7 obituary on writer-producer Louis "Deke"
Heyward said Heyward created the 1950s children's television series
"Winky Dink and You," the first interactive television show. In fact,
the show's credits, according to the Museum of Television &amp; Radio in
New York, list Harry W. Prichett and Edwin Brit Wyckoff as having
"originated" the series. Heyward was the first writer on the
partially animated show, which enabled viewers at home to help the
cartoon character Winky Dink and his dog Woofer out of their
predicaments by drawing on a "magic screen"--a clear piece of clingy
plastic placed on the TV screen. A delay in running a correction was
caused, in part, by a search of the U.S. Copyright Office in an
attempt to determine the show's creator.</CX>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jan Siegel, a former big-band singer who helped establish one of the
most successful racing stables in California, died Thursday in Los
Angeles. She was 69. She had suffered from cancer and had undergone
surgery late last year.</LD>
<LD>   Her name was Jan Winston when she met Mace Siegel at Aqueduct Race
Track in New York in 1962. They were married two months later and had
a daughter, named Samantha after the Cole Porter song that Jan loved
to sing with several bands in the 1950s and early 1960s.</LD>
<LD>   The Siegels--Jan, Mace and Samantha--have won dozens of stakes
races in California and elsewhere. Their biggest day at the track
came in 1989, when they won three $100,000 races on the preliminary
card to the Breeders' Cup races at Gulfstream Park in Hallandale
Beach, Fla. Their major race winners include Urbane, I Believe In
You, Hedonist, I Ain't Bluffing, Miss Iron Smoke and Stormy But
Valid.</LD>
<TE>   Born in Cincinnati, Jan Siegel developed an interest in horses
while attending the University of Kentucky. She and her husband, a
developer of regional shopping malls who heads Santa Monica-based
Macerich Co., bought their first horse at an auction in Maryland in
1964 and named the filly Najecam by combining and spelling their
first names backward.</TE>
<TE>   Najecam didn't win her first race until four years later, and was
retired with only one win in 27 outings. But by the mid-1970s, the
Siegels began assembling some top horses and were winning important
races. Their filly I Believe In You won the Hollywood Starlet in
2000.</TE>
<TE>   Siegel is survived by her husband, her daughter and a son, Evan.</TE>
<TE>   Services are scheduled for 2 p.m. Tuesday at the Church of the
Good Shepherd in Beverly Hills.</TE>
<TE>   The family has requested that, in lieu of flowers, donations be
made to the City of Hope and St. Jude Children's Research Hospital.</TE>

<HD>John Thomas, 71; Member of Venice Beats</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELAINE WOO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Even among the bohemians of Venice, John Thomas stood out. He was 6
feet 4, weighed 300 pounds and spoke in a rolling, resonant baritone
that left no one behind.</LD>
<LD>   But, more than that, he was a poet--"the best unread poet in
America," according to Charles Bukowski, the infamous bard of lowlife
Los Angeles who knew Thomas for 30 years.</LD>
<LD>   Gadfly, poetic realist and magnificent reader of his own work,
much of which is out of print or unpublished, Thomas was a commanding
figure on Los Angeles' avant-garde scene for four decades.</LD>
<TE>   "He was by far the greatest underground poet in Los Angeles for
the last 35, 40 years," poet and Bukowski biographer Neeli Cherkovski
said of Thomas, who died March 29 at the Veterans Administration
hospital in Westwood.</TE>
<TE>   The cause of death was congestive heart failure, said Thomas'
wife, poet Philomene Long. He was 71.</TE>
<TE>   "He was the sage of Venice," said Fred Dewey, director of Beyond
Baroque, the Venice literary arts center that planned an evening of
readings and tributes to Thomas last night. Thomas was revered by
many for his grace and clarity in works such as "From Patagonia," a
lengthy poem about Los Angeles written in the form of a diary. His
major collections include "Epopoeia and the Decay of Satire,"
"Abandoned Latitudes" and "John Thomas," all published in the 1970s
and early 1980s.</TE>
<TE>   He also was an early member of the Venice beats, a group that
historian John Arthur Maynard, in his 1991 book on the subject,
called "an outlaw strain in Southern California letters."</TE>
<TE>   Thomas fit easily into the mold.</TE>
<TE>   Overlooked in most accounts of the beat movement made famous by
Jack Kerouac, Allen Ginsberg and other writers, the Venice beats were
literary outsiders who shunned celebrity for lives based on art and
poverty.</TE>
<TE>   While the beats of San Francisco's North Beach and New York City's
Greenwich Village aspired to transform society, the Venice beats
"knew the people better than that," Maynard wrote in "Venice West,
the Beat Generation in Southern California."</TE>
<TE>   "What they really wanted to do," Maynard said, "was to write their
poems, paint their paintings, take their drugs, love their friends
and keep from getting busted by the police."</TE>
<TE>   When he was nearing midlife, Thomas abandoned his job and family
in Baltimore and thumbed his way west. He landed in Venice,
surrounded by artistic misfits of one kind or another, who were
joined by their rejection of popular culture and their passion for
literature and life on the seamy edge. They labored in obscurity and,
if you believed them, preferred it that way.</TE>
<TE>   "John was the most un-Hollywood writer in Los Angeles," said
Cherkovski. "He didn't want to teach in a university. He had once
been in the business world and dropped out. He had 'tuned in, turned
on and dropped out,'" he said, citing what became the credo of youth
in the '60s, "but he did it in the 1950s."</TE>
<TE>   Born John Thomas Idlet, he grew up in Baltimore, the son of a
teacher with an overbearingly critical manner and an ice cream
factory foreman who claimed to have invented the double cone.</TE>
<TE>   He attended Baltimore's Loyola College and briefly considered the
priesthood, until the Korean War intervened. With an IQ of 180, he
was deemed highly suited for decoding work and became a cryptographer
in the Air Force.</TE>
<TE>   After his discharge in 1953, he returned home, married the first
of four wives and got a job as a computer programmer for Univac.</TE>
<TE>   The turning point came when he was hit by a truck and broke his
ankle. Laid up for weeks, he grew a beard and began to write. He
produced three novels, none publishable.</TE>
<TE>   Then he read "The Holy Barbarians," a 1959 guidebook to the
unfolding beat scene in Venice written by Lawrence Lipton, a poet,
author and impresario of Venice West.</TE>
<TE>   Thomas later told Maynard, the historian, that he found the book
"silly." Nonetheless, he left home with $14 in his pocket and hitched
a ride across the country, intending to reach San Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   But his ride ended in Los Angeles, so he took a bus to Venice. He
called himself a poet and, exposed to practitioners such as Stuart
Perkoff, began to write like one.</TE>
<TE>   To support himself, he became manager and cook at the Gas House,
Lipton's bohemian hangout and club near the Venice speedway. Buying
food with the meager donations of tourists, he was necessarily
resourceful, scrounging "trash fish" like bonito and barracuda for
chowder and finding amazing bargains on "filet mignon," actually
horsemeat from a nearby pet store.</TE>
<TE>   After a brief period in San Francisco, Thomas moved east in Los
Angeles, living in ramshackle apartments and houses around Echo Park
and Silver Lake that were cluttered with papers, books, bottles, a
worn typewriter and his collection of 100 pipes. Unread books, some
in rotting packages from mail-order houses, lined his driveway.</TE>
<TE>   Poet Wanda Coleman met him at his Silver Lake abode in 1966 when
she was visiting a brother who lived downstairs.</TE>
<TE>   "John Thomas," she said with affection, "was my first mentor." If
Coleman's brother wasn't home, Thomas would invite her in for tea and
hours of rambling discussion about literature and L.A.'s underground
culture. He told her about cult figures such as satirist Lenny Bruce,
whom he knew.</TE>
<TE>   And he shared the adventures of the larger-than-life Bukowski,
whose antics inspired the 1987 film "Barfly."</TE>
<TE>   Bukowski would visit Thomas after working the graveyard shift as a
mail sorter at Terminal Annex.</TE>
<TE>   Although Bukowski eventually willed himself out of obscurity and
published far more widely than Thomas, Thomas was "one of the few
persons who could intimidate Bukowski even before Bukowski came into
the room," Cherkovski recalled. Bukowski died in 1994.</TE>
<TE>   Extremely well read, Thomas was an exacting wordsmith who was
rarely averse to pointing out the fallacies he saw in other poets'
work.</TE>
<TE>   "John was ruthless in that, and often very unpopular because of
it," said Paul Vangelisti, a poet who also was Thomas' editor. "He
was an exceptionally fine writer."</TE>
<TE>   He did not write poems for more than a decade, however. A person
who could spend hours in silence "listening to the trees," he devoted
most of the 1970s and early '80s to writing in a private journal.</TE>
<TE>   He published little over the last 20 years, a fact that Bukowski
noted in one of many kind poems he wrote about Thomas. In "Big John
of Echo Park," published in 1988, Bukowski said of his friend:</TE>
<TE>   It's a</TE>
<TE>   good thing</TE>
<TE>   for many of us</TE>
<TE>   in this stinking</TE>
<TE>   racket</TE>
<TE>   that he just</TE>
<TE>   doesn't like to</TE>
<TE>   type</TE>
<TE>   too much</TE>
<TE>   Thomas offered a cold-eyed assessment of himself in "Patagonia,"
the long prose piece published in 1983:</TE>
<TE>   Most writers would regard Southern California as banishment
enough. To live in Los Angeles, a minor poet of some local repute:
surely this satisfies any interpretation of the Doctrine of
Sufficient Disgrace. Well, for me, nothing has ever proved
Sufficient. The Fatal Flaw, amigo.</TE>
<TE>   "To me it's a tragedy so much of his work is out of print or
[never] published," said Dewey of Beyond Baroque.</TE>
<TE>   In an effort to bring Thomas to a wider audience, the literary
center is selling a CD of poems he wrote for Long and accepting
donations to the John Thomas Fund, payable to Beyond Baroque. Some of
the money also will be used to help cover funeral costs.</TE>
<TE>   One poem that may be long remembered is engraved in a concrete
wall on the Venice boardwalk. It is called "The Ghosts of the Poets":</TE>
<TE>   Even the barrel of my pen</TE>
<TE>   is full of the ghosts of uncouth poets.</TE>
<TE>   In case you wondered,</TE>
<TE>   they are the wild kidney. They are</TE>
<TE>   the bitter crackling sound I hear</TE>
<TE>   when Philomene brushes her hair.</TE>
<TE>   In case you wondered,</TE>
<TE>   they are the small transparent parasols</TE>
<TE>   all of us stroll beneath.</TE>

<CX>   Poet's obituary--An obituary of Venice beat poet John Thomas in the
April 7 California section incorrectly stated that he died at the
Veterans Administration hospital in Westwood. He had been treated
there earlier, but died at County-USC Medical Center. The obituary
also omitted some important facts that came to light after
publication of the story. At the time of his death on March 29 at age
71, Thomas was serving a 120-day jail sentence after he pleaded no
contest to a charge of sexually molesting his daughter in 1971 when
she was 14. His sentence included 60 months of probation, and he was
ordered to pay $200 in restitution. A change in state law lifting the
statute of limitations on unreported sex-abuse crimes in which the
victim was a child allowed him to be prosecuted.</CX>

<CX>   Thomas obituary--A correction in Thursday's Times regarding the April
7 obituary on Venice beat poet John Thomas misstated the charge that
led to his 120-day jail term. It said he pleaded no contest to a
charge of sexually molesting his daughter when she was 14. In fact,
the charge that led to his jailing was one count of sexual contact
with a 15-year-old.</CX>

<TE>   Man Critically Wounded as Deputies Return Fire</TE>
<TE>   The Sheriff's Department is continuing its investigation of a
deputy-involved shooting Saturday in Norwalk that left an
unidentified man in critical condition.</TE>
<TE>   The man was shot during one of two exchanges of gunfire that began
at 1:30 a.m. in the 11400 block of Alburtis Avenue and moved to the
15000 block of Corby Avenue.</TE>
<TE>   Sgt. Ken Davidson, a Sheriff's Department spokesman, said the man
ignored the deputy and began fumbling with an object in the front of
his waistband. The two exchanged gunfire. Then the man attempted to
enter a nearby home as police backup arrived. As he shot at officers
again, they returned fire, hitting him in the torso.</TE>

Hollywood, said Los Angeles Police Department Lt. Loren Farell.</LD>
<LD>   The youngster had been missing since 3:30 p.m. Friday, when
someone attacked Muniran Surani, the girl's mother, and took the
black Lexus from a Northridge Costco parking lot. Surani had just
placed her daughter in a car seat when she was attacked, police said.</LD>
<TE>   Investigators searched the SUV for clues to the identity of the
carjacker but have no strong leads, police said Saturday.</TE>

<LD>The Sheriff's Department is continuing its investigation of a
deputy-involved shooting Saturday in Norwalk that left an
unidentified man in critical condition.</LD>
<LD>   The man was shot during one of two exchanges of gunfire that began
at 1:30 a.m. in the 11400 block of Alburtis Avenue and moved to the
15000 block of Corby Avenue.</LD>
<LD>   Sgt. Ken Davidson, a Sheriff's Department spokesman, said the man
ignored the deputy and began fumbling with an object in the front of
his waistband. The two exchanged gunfire. Then the man attempted to
enter a nearby home as police backup arrived. As he shot at officers
again, they returned fire, hitting him in the torso.</LD>

<HD>Mahony, Bernardin Cases Have Parallels</HD>
<DH>Allegations: Cardinal defended Chicago prelate against
claim retracted months later.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LARRY STAMMER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When Cardinal Roger M. Mahony was privately informed last month that
a woman had accused him of sexual abuse, he found himself on familiar
ground.</LD>
<LD>   In 1993 Mahony had come to the defense of another leading American
prelate similarly accused, Cardinal Joseph Bernardin of Chicago.</LD>
<LD>   "I know him too well," Mahony said at the time, "to believe that
any of these outrageous allegations could have any basis in fact. I
fear that we are reaching a new level of contempt when anyone can
bring unfounded charges against church leaders of such integrity."</LD>
<TE>   The charges against Bernardin were disavowed four months later by
his accuser, a seminarian named Steven Cook, who said he had had a
faulty memory of an incident that occurred 20 years earlier, when he
was 17.</TE>
<TE>   The episode had historical significance beyond what it did to the
late Bernardin's reputation: It was regarded as a setback for a
movement by victims of priestly abuse, who had long struggled to
convince the public that the Roman Catholic Church was in denial.</TE>
<TE>   Now a Fresno woman has come forward with an accusation that Mahony
molested her on the campus of a Catholic high school there when she
was a teenager in 1970.</TE>
<TE>   The new allegations against Mahony are still under investigation,
but there are striking parallels between how the two cardinals
responded to the charges--and the reliability of their accusers'
recollections.</TE>
<TE>   The Fresno woman said the purported incident had "kept eating away
at me" over the years. But she told reporters there are lapses in her
recollection. She said she found herself blacked out on the grounds
of San Joaquin Memorial Catholic High School and looked up and saw
Mahony.</TE>
<TE>   In the Bernardin case, Cook said his faulty recollections of being
abused were based in large part on the use of hypnosis to help
recover repressed memories. He said that if he had known about the
limitations of recovered memory he would never have accused
Bernardin, or sued him for $10 million. Cook later died of AIDS.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, Mahony, like Bernardin years before him, strongly
denied the charges in virtually the same language.</TE>
<TE>   "I categorically [deny] ever having molested anyone either before
or after my ordination as a priest and as a bishop," Mahony said
Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Years earlier, Bernardin said, "The allegations are totally
untrue. They're categorically false. I have never abused anyone, at
any time and at any place."</TE>
<TE>   Mahony, like Bernardin, said he was praying for his accuser. Both
asked for the prayers of others.</TE>
<TE>   Bernardin held a Chicago news conference the day that Cook filed
suit, and another several days later in Washington during a meeting
of the National Conference of Catholic Bishops.</TE>
<TE>   Mahony, a media-savvy archbishop who advises Pope John Paul II on
communications matters, chose a different approach. He had dodged
reporters all day Friday after dozens of private e-mails from the Los
Angeles archdiocese's office about the church's sexual-abuse scandal
were leaked. But later in the day, as the media focused on several
e-mails mentioning the Fresno woman's accusations, Mahony issued a
written statement within an hour.</TE>
<TE>   Mahony personally reported the allegation to police on March 22,
the same day he was told about it by Fresno Bishop John Steinbock.</TE>
<TE>   Both cardinals showed no hesitancy to take on controversial
issues.</TE>
<TE>   Bernardin was a peacemaker who sought to reconcile competing
ideologies that have long pulled at the fabric of the American
church. He started an organization called Common Ground, which
encouraged dialogue on controversial issues within the church such as
ordaining women and allowing priests to marry. This was at a time
when the pope had disappointed liberal Catholics by firmly saying the
matters were closed.</TE>
<TE>   When Bernardin was dying in 1996, it was Mahony who rushed to his
bedside to offer comfort and a private Mass. And it was Mahony to
whom the mantle of leadership of Bernardin's Common Ground was
passed.</TE>
<TE>   The organization eventually faded, but Mahony is widely viewed as
one of the few cardinals who seems willing to at least entertain
dialogue between Catholicism's traditional and dissenting factions.
Two weeks ago in Long Beach, Mahony said he never believed that the
church should silence those who want to discuss a married priesthood.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever the outcome of the Mahony investigation, it will probably
have repercussions across the American church. If Mahony is
eventually cleared, the church would be able to claim some
vindication at a time when it faces what many believe is its greatest
crisis in modern times.</TE>
<TE>   Yet the past months' stunning revelations across the nation of
priestly abuse, and the way many archdioceses failed to remove errant
priests, make abuse crusaders less worried about the long-term
effects of such an outcome.</TE>
<TE>   Mahony's exoneration would not be nearly the setback it was in
1994 when Cook changed his story about Bernardin, said David
Clohessy, national director of the Survivors Network of Those Abused
by Priests.</TE>
<TE>   Clohessy, who lives in St. Louis, said Saturday that the Bernardin
case not only made journalists and attorneys more skeptical of sexual
abuse charges, but discouraged more victims from going public.</TE>
<TE>   But that is unlikely to be the case today, he said. After so many
years and so many proven disclosures of clergy sexual abuse, Clohessy
said, a "shaky" allegation, even against a prominent churchman like
Mahony, would not be as damaging.</TE>
<TE>   A similar outcome today "will hurt us," he said, "but it will be
less dangerous because of the preponderance of evidence since the
Bernardin situation."</TE>
<TE>   Mahony may have one more thing in common with Bernardin if he is
cleared like his friend was. Upon Bernardin's death, he was
remembered as one of the nation's leading cardinals, a reconciler, a
listener and a deeply spiritual man who, even as he was dying of
cancer, ministered to other cancer victims. Yet the obituaries all
mentioned the dismissed allegation of sexual abuse.</TE>
<TE>   "Even a false allegation is mentioned and included in the obit,"
said one of Mahony's confidants. "It's as good as being branded."</TE>

8700 block of Wakefield Avenue shortly before 6 a.m.</LD>
<LD>   Residents told the officers they had heard several shots about
2:15 a.m., police said.</LD>
<TE>   However, no emergency personnel were summoned, and the victims'
bodies were not discovered until hours later.</TE>
<TE>   The victims' grandfather, Paul Shellabarger, who lives nearby,
said his grandchildren were "good, nice kids who never got into
trouble."</TE>
<TE>   "I just saw Johnny Thursday and now he's gone," said Shellabarger
from his home Saturday night.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel terrible. I just left my son's house. Everyone is over

<HD>The Bell That Keeps on Ringing</HD>
<DH>History: More than 100 years old, it will help Baptist
church celebrate 50 years in West Hollywood.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BOB POOL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There's a ring of truth to Tom Stringfellow's warning that "this is
all kind of hard to believe."</LD>
<LD>   The West Hollywood pastor is talking about the 113-year odyssey of
the bell outside his Baptist church, the one that will be rung 50
times today in a salute to resiliency--and to Los Angeles' past.</LD>
<LD>   The 324-pound bell has been saved numerous times by Los Angeles
County firefighters. And each new rescue has been more unlikely than
the last.</LD>
<TE>   Banged and battered, the bell was a not-so-silent sentinel over
the Westside of Los Angeles from the first day it was hauled in 1890
into the tiny enclave then called Sherman.</TE>
<TE>   A salesman from the McShane Bell Foundry outside Baltimore had
shipped the bell west by train in hopes of selling it.</TE>
<TE>   He found a buyer with the Pacific Electric Railway trolley
system's Sherman terminal in what is now West Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   For decades, the huge bell clanged ear-splitting salutes to rail
passengers arriving and departing from the station, where the Pacific
Design Center now stands.</TE>
<TE>   When the Red Car system fell on hard times in 1920, the bell was
sold to the West Hollywood Community Church.</TE>
<TE>   At its sanctuary on what is now the corner of San Vicente Avenue
and Cynthia Street, Community Church leaders used the bell to ring in
Sunday services and to peal mournful farewells when locals died. It
was joyously clanged to celebrate national holidays. It sounded
urgent warnings during times of community emergencies.</TE>
<TE>   But the Community Church burned in 1940. The only thing county
firemen from the nearby one-truck Fire Station 7 could salvage from
the smoking ruins was the bronze bell. When a replacement church was
built, it was polished and hung in a newly built bell tower.</TE>
<TE>   According to Stringfellow, things started to get interesting after
that.</TE>
<TE>   As the tiny town grew, newcomers began complaining about noise
from the huge bell. Church workers reluctantly sealed off the belfry
in the 1950s, turning the bell tower into a signpost. In 1993, he
says, the Community Church disbanded and its building was boarded up.</TE>
<TE>   A short time later, county fire department officials purchased the
abandoned Community Church property as the site for a new Fire
Station 7--one big enough to hold six fire trucks.</TE>
<TE>   Workers razing the abandoned church to make way for the firehouse
discovered the bell hidden in the sign. County fire officials again
rescued the bell--this time lugging it out of the way of bulldozers
to a corner of the station's construction site.</TE>
<TE>   When their new $6-million station was finished, firefighters set
out to preserve the bell that sat rusting out back. They wanted to
install it on its own decorative tower at their new home. But
financial problems and red tape repeatedly stalled their plans.</TE>
<TE>   In late 2000, meanwhile, Stringfellow underwent surgery and
developed an infection. Paramedics and firefighters from the new
Station 7 were called to the church parsonage to assist him. As he
was rolled on a gurney to the ambulance, a firefighter recognized the
pastor and started talking about the orphaned bell at their station.</TE>
<TE>   "When I got out of the hospital and was strong enough to walk, I
went over to the fire station to thank the paramedics and asked to
see the bell," Stringfellow said. "I told them that bell belongs in a
church. They said they'd deliver it, and they did--in a firetruck
with its red lights flashing."</TE>
<TE>   Back at his church, which despite its location is called the First
Baptist Church of Beverly Hills, Stringfellow decided to incorporate
the bell into a remodeling project he was planning that would make
the church sanctuary accessible to disabled members.</TE>
<TE>   Founded in 1952 in a Beverly Hills real estate office, the Baptist
church moved shortly thereafter to West Hollywood, where it became a
fixture in the community. In fact, city officials have installed
official directional street signs around town that point to it at
9025 Cynthia St.</TE>
<TE>   Grammy-winning Nashville country music writer and performer Marty
Stuart was in town to score a movie when he spied one of the signs
and decided to visit the church the Sunday morning that Stringfellow
was discussing the planned remodeling. Stuart, who is president of
the Country Music Foundation, immediately underwrote about half of
the $100,000 project, according to church officials.</TE>
<TE>   In its newest home, the bell is mounted in a flower planter at the
side of the Baptist church. To the relief of neighboring condominium
and apartment dwellers, it is locked so it cannot be rung, except on
special occasions.</TE>
<TE>   Today's planned bell-ringing will be plenty special, according to
the church's 100 members.</TE>
<TE>   The Baptist congregation's 50th anniversary celebration will start
with an 11 a.m. service. At 12:45 p.m., the bell will be pealed by
89-year-old Myrtle Belland.</TE>
<TE>   "That's my real name," says Belland, a West Los Angeles resident
whose late husband, Stanley Belland, was once a pastor of the
Community Church. And it was her first husband who rebuilt the church
bell tower after it burned in 1940. His name was Burnell Little.</TE>
<TE>   Stringfellow predicted that much of West Hollywood will hear
today's bell-ringing. Among invited guests will be the crew from Fire
Station 7. For them, it's all going to have a familiar ring to it.</TE>

<LD>Troubled by the cancellation of dozens of conventions in the last

for an overhaul of the way events are booked at the Los Angeles

<LD>   The target of city officials' anger and frustration is the Los
Angeles Convention &amp; Visitors Bureau, the nonprofit independent group
that promotes the city-owned center.</LD>
<LD>   The city pays the bureau up to $17 million a year from hotel bed
taxes to promote the city as a tourist destination, maintain a steady
stream of major conventions at the downtown complex and keep local
hotels filled with conventioneers.</LD>
<TE>   But as they watch the Convention Center's business drop, officials
are beginning to ask what the city is getting for its money.</TE>
<TE>   Forty-two conventions have been canceled in the last three years,
an unprecedented number, according to bureau and city officials. And
only one of those was directly attributed to the Sept. 11 attacks. In
another measure of trouble, the Convention Center's occupancy rate
has dropped from 83% in the 2000 calendar year to 72% so far this
year.</TE>
<TE>   The future also looks bleak. Each year the sales staff books
conventions for coming years. In fiscal year 2000 it booked 74 in
advance. So far this fiscal year, which ends in June, only six
conventions have been booked for the future.</TE>
<TE>   The stakes are high for the city, which spent $500 million in 1993
to expand the center. The city is supposed to make money from the
rental of the facility and hotel bed taxes paid by conventioneers.
But this year, for the first time, the Convention Center will not
make a profit, and the city will be forced to spend $7 million in
general funds to make debt payments for the expansion.</TE>
<TE>   "The mayor is looking for aggressive solutions to turning this
around," said Deputy Mayor Troy S. Edwards. "Conventions are critical
to the regionwide economy, and they are critical to our hotel base
here downtown."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, the hotel industry has taken a huge hit. The bureau
estimates that the number of hotel room nights booked for conventions
dropped from 1 million in the 2000 fiscal year to 327,000 last year,
costing the local economy about $309 million.</TE>
<TE>   Peter Zen, chairman of the Convention Center Commission and owner
of the Westin Bonaventure Hotel, said the panel has launched an
examination into bureau operations and agreed last week to explore
ways to gain more control over bookings.</TE>
<TE>   If the bureau fails to improve its sales and booking record, Zen
said the city could cancel its contract for promotion and convention
booking.</TE>
<TE>   Shortage of Hotels, Inflexible Rents Blamed</TE>
<TE>   Bureau officials acknowledge that convention business is down, but
said the center suffers primarily from two problems beyond the
bureau's control: inflexible rents for hall space and a shortage of
quality hotels close to the facility that have made it less
attractive than centers in other cities.</TE>
<TE>   George Kirkland, president of the visitors bureau, said about
one-third of the 42 cancellations were because of the hotel space
situation.</TE>
<TE>   "That is the one issue that has most put us at a competitive
disadvantage with other cities," said Kirkland, who was paid $345,000
last year by the bureau, including a $60,000 bonus.</TE>
<TE>   Expansion of the Convention Center was supposed to be accompanied
by the addition of 4,000 hotel rooms very close to the complex.</TE>
<TE>   Only 460 such rooms have been added, said Michael Collins, the
bureau's vice president.</TE>
<TE>   Cities with thriving convention centers have many more hotel rooms
within half a mile of their facilities, Collins said.</TE>
<TE>   For example, Las Vegas has 9,400 such rooms; San Francisco, 5,000;
and Anaheim, 4,500. But Los Angeles has only 650, and major downtown
hotels are more than half a mile away.</TE>
<TE>   The other problem, according to bureau officials, is a city policy
that limits the rental discount that can be offered to convention
groups.</TE>
<TE>   Bureau board member John Stoddard, general manager of the Wilshire
Grand Hotel, has asked city officials in writing to give the bureau
flexibility to grant greater discounts.</TE>
<TE>   "Immediate changes are required in order to prevent other cities
from outbidding Los Angeles for business," Stoddard wrote last month
to the City Council.</TE>
<TE>   City commissioners complain that the bureau has offered
unwarranted discounts on convention halls, costing the city more than
$5 million that could have been used to pay off the expansion debt.</TE>
<TE>   To gain more control over the convention business, the commission
is considering setting performance benchmarks in the city contract
for the bureau sales staff, requiring monthly meetings to allow city
officials to monitor bureau activity and mandating that any rent
discounts be submitted to the commission for approval.</TE>
<TE>   Center Could Take Over Bookings, Promotions</TE>
<TE>   If the city decides to cut ties with the visitors bureau, it could
have the Convention Center take over all bookings and promotions; it
already books local trade shows, car shows and other annual events,
Zen said.</TE>
<TE>   The hotelier, appointed to the commission by Hahn, has led the
charge for change in the bureau. Some question his motives.</TE>
<TE>   Stoddard has filed a complaint with the city Ethics Commission,
saying Zen has a conflict of interest stemming from his dual role as
a hotel owner and a commissioner promoting changes that could benefit
his hotel.</TE>
<TE>   Zen denies any conflict and remains undeterred in raising
fundamental questions about how the bureau counts booked conventions.</TE>
<TE>   Zen said he is concerned that the bureau is listing what appear to
be tentative commitments as "definite."</TE>
<TE>   That would inflate its bookings and might boost bonuses received
by salespeople.</TE>
<TE>   He objected that salespeople get bonuses for meeting sales goals
in a given year, even if some of the conventions cancel in later
years.</TE>
<TE>   Collins acknowledged that salespeople are not asked to return
bonuses. But he said cancellations are counted against their goals in
future years.</TE>
<TE>   Zen countered that some conventions cancel years later, long after
salespeople leave the bureau with their unearned bonuses.</TE>
<TE>   In response to the concerns, the bureau last year hired the
accounting firm Arthur Andersen, which concluded that policies and
practices could be improved but that there was no fraudulent
inflating of bookings lists.</TE>
<TE>   Although the rhetoric has often been harsh, officials at the
commission and the bureau said they are trying to work out their
problems to avoid such drastic steps as canceling the bureau's
contract.</TE>
<TE>   Kirkland said the bureau has already started taking steps to
improve bookings and reduce cancellations, including the hiring of a
new sales manager and tightening its booking procedures.</TE>
<TE>   "Do we have challenges?" Collins asked. "Oh, brother, do we. But
we can find solutions."</TE>

<HD>Growth Is Key Issue in Municipal Races</HD>
<DH>Election: Residents in 14 L.A. County cities will head to
the polls Tuesday, help shape development in their area.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CARA MIA DiMASSA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Growth--whether planned at LAX or in the foothills--is a recurring
theme in 14 municipal elections to be held in Los Angeles County on
Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   In Santa Clarita, where the population is expected to swell by
50,000 over the next two decades, three of five council seats are up
for grabs.</LD>
<LD>   Most of the debate has focused on how, and whether, Santa Clarita
should allow growth. The positions range from those advocating
"controlled growth" to those saying they will oppose projects that
lack adequate schools and roads. One candidate wants the city to
aggressively lobby against growth on county land outside the city.</LD>
<TE>   In El Segundo, the possible expansion of Los Angeles International
Airport remains a major issue. Candidates William V. Wegner and
Spencer Shakstad have expressed a willingness to negotiate with
planners of the expansion project, while incumbents Kelly McDowell
and John Gaines say there is no room for compromise. The four
candidates are running for two council seats.</TE>
<TE>   The fight for two Malibu council seats spilled onto the letters
pages of community newspapers. A letter to the Malibu Times condemned
the candidacy of Robert Roy van de Hoek, an environmental activist
and part-time marine biology instructor who was arrested in 1997 for
damaging property at a wildlife preserve where he once worked.</TE>
<TE>   Van de Hoek, who described his actions as civil disobedience, said
the letter should not affect his campaign. ''My feeling," he said,
"is that people here want to protect the environment. Otherwise they
could live in Beverly Hills.''</TE>
<TE>   Real estate agent Beverly Taki, another candidate, drew criticism
from some who said her job would constitute a conflict of interest.
Although Taki supports low-density commercial projects, ''my job is
to sell quality of life,'' she said. ''As a Realtor, I probably have
a bigger stake in trying to conserve the quality of life here.''
Other candidates are Andy Stern, Sharon Barovsky and John Wall.</TE>
<TE>   Two years ago in Lancaster, Mayor Frank C. Roberts' only
competition was a man facing trial on stalking and drug charges. This
year, he faces four challengers, some of whom say Roberts has failed
to bring more lucrative employment opportunities to the city.</TE>
<TE>   As the Antelope Valley shifts from its reliance on aerospace,
neighboring Palmdale has attracted new retail stores. But Lancaster
has focused on courting regional distribution warehouses--a move that
has drawn criticism from candidate William F. Fender, a police
officer.</TE>
<TE>   Health-care executive Norm Hickling has emphasized the need to
create medical and biotech jobs for former aerospace workers.
Nineteen-year-old candidate Anthony Booth argues that Lancaster needs
to attract a few decent entertainment venues downtown. Candidate Gene
Gaynor says he wants to make government more accessible.</TE>
<TE>   In the San Gabriel Valley, Arcadia, Bradbury, Sierra Madre, Walnut
and Whittier will elect city council members Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Sierra Madre voters also will decide the fate of an ordinance
that, if approved, would allow owners of properties listed on the
city's historic registry to remove them from the list.</TE>
<TE>   Many owners of historical properties have said that their homes
were first placed on the list without their consent. Homes on the
registry are limited in the kinds of improvements their owners can
make.</TE>
<TE>   After voters passed a similar initiative, placed on the ballot
four years ago by the Sierra Madre City Council, a citizens group
sued to overturn it and prevailed in a case that went to the
California Supreme Court.</TE>
<TE>   The current measure was put on the ballot through a petition
drive, and its backers hope it will not encounter the problems that
scuttled the previous measure.</TE>
<TE>   Voters in South Pasadena and Lawndale will decide whether to
extend the cities' utility user taxes. Avalon and Long Beach voters
also will go to the polls, and the Lawndale ballot includes an
advisory vote on whether to permit the sale and use of fireworks for
the Fourth of July.</TE>
<TE>   In Culver City, where residents will pick a city clerk and fill
two City Council seats, the most highly charged debate has centered
on a culinary question: Should restaurants post the grades assigned
them by county health inspectors? The current council had voted down
grade posting twice before finally allowing the signs last week.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>In 1998, Los Angeles Cardinal Roger Mahony was a central figure in
one of the most notorious sex-abuse trials in Catholic church
history.</LD>
<LD>   The case involved two Stockton-area brothers who had been abused
by a priest from the time they were toddlers until they were in their
late teens, both before and after the Stockton diocese had received
complaints against the priest.</LD>
<LD>   A jury was so disturbed by the drama that unfolded in San Joaquin
County Superior Court, it awarded $30 million in damages to the
brothers, an amount later negotiated to $7 million.</LD>
<TE>   Mahony was not a defendant in the case, but he was the bishop of
Stockton during a critical period addressed in the lawsuit. He had
ordered an evaluation after the priest himself admitted he was a
molester, then reassigned him to another parish, where he abused
victims for years to come.</TE>
<TE>   "Mahony is the Teflon cardinal," says Jeff Anderson, who
represented the victims and was amazed that Mahony's reputation in
Los Angeles was scarcely tainted by the Stockton verdict, which at
the time was the largest-ever per-person settlement in such a case.</TE>
<TE>   One witness at that trial, Nancy Sloan of Fairfield in Solano
County, says that to this day, she doesn't know how Mahony can sleep
at night.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm absolutely convinced Mahony knew all about the priest," says
Sloan, now 37, who was abused by the same priest years before he
abused the two brothers and many others.</TE>
<TE>   Mahony, who insisted at trial that he was unaware of all the
allegations against the priest, did not answer my request for an
interview on the subject. But a review of the transcripts, which
seemed prudent in light of the growing church scandal in Los Angeles
and other cities, reveals a staggeringly familiar pattern: A priest
who was a known molester kept getting shuffled from one parish to
another, claiming more victims along the way.</TE>
<TE>   In this case, the priest was Father Oliver O'Grady. Nancy Sloan
says that in 1976, when she was 11, Father O'Grady molested her.
Father O'Grady wrote a letter of apology to her parents, who met with
church officials. Sloan deeply regrets that her parents didn't notify
the police, and, of course, the diocese didn't call the authorities,
either.</TE>
<TE>   "My parents went to the bishop [one of Mahony's predecessors],
because they trusted him to do what was right," Sloan says. What was
"right," by diocesan standards, was to pay for Sloan's therapy, file
the incident away, and leave it at that.</TE>
<TE>   Four years later, when Mahony was bishop, an entirely unrelated
case came before him. He became aware of an "improper relationship"
between Father O'Grady and the mother of the brothers who would later
be the subjects of the $30-million verdict. Mahony claimed he was
unaware of a report that O'Grady was seen alone with one of the
brothers, who was then 2. But he told O'Grady not to see the woman
again, and later transferred him.</TE>
<TE>   Now we come to 1984, when O'Grady himself confessed that he was a
molester. According to the police report, the priest told a county
medical practitioner "he had contact of a sexual nature approximately
two weeks ago and other past behaviors of a similar nature." O'Grady
also told the medical practitioner that he had touched the penis of
one of the brothers, then 9, while the boy slept. Police began a
child-abuse investigation that ended when the boy could not confirm
the abuse.</TE>
<TE>   The police report says the diocesan attorney assured police they
"interviewed the suspect and feel the incident only occurred once and
is an isolated incident. The suspect will be sent to counseling
through the church."</TE>
<TE>   Less than one month later, Mahony transferred O'Grady again, this
time to a church in San Andreas. In a letter dated Dec. 10, 1984,
Mahony said, "I commit you to the full care of souls in that parish
with all faculties, duties, rights, and privileges.... "</TE>
<TE>   For the next several years, O'Grady continued to molest his 1984
victim and as many as 10 others, according to attorney Anderson.
Finally, in 1993, after being molested for years, a 19-year-old
victim went to the police. Father O'Grady was criminally convicted
and sentenced to 14 years in prison.</TE>
<TE>   At the civil trial that followed, Mahony took the witness stand
and denied any knowledge of the 1976 molestation of Nancy Sloan,
denied knowing about the 1982 report of O'Grady being alone with a
2-year-old, denied knowing the full extent of O'Grady's molestation
confession in 1984, and denied ordering his attorney to tell Stockton
police there was only one known incident.</TE>
<TE>   "When I was informed," Mahony testified regarding the 1984
incident, "I was not informed that this priest had admitted to
molesting a child. That was not the information I was given. I was
operating under the assumption that an allegation had been made, been
thoroughly investigated, and dismissed."</TE>
<TE>   Plaintiffs' attorneys tried to chip away at Mahony, expressing
disbelief that the bishop of a small diocese of fewer than 100
priests would be unfamiliar with the entire file on a priest who had
admitted molesting an 11-year-old girl and a 9-year-old boy. They
asked how it was possible that a bishop could not know every detail
of a police investigation that took place on his watch. But Mahony
stood his ground, insisting that his underlings often handled such
matters for him.</TE>
<TE>   Mahony testified that he ordered a psychiatric evaluation of
O'Grady after the 1984 incident, and was satisfied with the results,
even though the report said: "Father O'Grady reveals a severe defect
in maturation. Not only in the matter of sex, but more importantly in
the matter of social relationships, and shows a serious psychological
depression."</TE>
<TE>   There were positive recommendations as well, Mahony testified, and
he was comfortable that with further counseling, Father O'Grady was
fit to continue in ministry.</TE>
<TE>   During a break in his testimony, Mahony spoke to reporters outside
the courtroom, telling them he thought the diocese did everything
humanly possible to make sure there was no problem with O'Grady
before sending him to San Andreas in December of 1984. When court
resumed, attorney Anderson repeated the cardinal's statement about
doing everything humanly possible, then asked:</TE>
<TE>   "At the time, Cardinal, did you talk to the police?"</TE>
<TE>   "No," Mahony said.</TE>
<TE>   "You could have."</TE>
<TE>   "Well, I'm not sure I could have. But .... "</TE>
<TE>   "What was restraining you?" Anderson asked.</TE>
<TE>   It went on like this for several minutes, Anderson knocking down
Mahony's claim that everything humanly possible had been done to
prevent future abuse.</TE>
<TE>   Did you send O'Grady to a doctor specializing in sex offense? he
asked.</TE>
<TE>   "At the time, I was really unaware that there were such
specialists," Mahony said.</TE>
<TE>   Did you check O'Grady's file?</TE>
<TE>   No, Mahony said.</TE>
<TE>   Did you conduct an investigation of your own?</TE>
<TE>   Sending him to a psychiatrist seemed appropriate enough, Mahony
answered.</TE>
<TE>   Did you interview witnesses? Anderson asked.</TE>
<TE>   No, Mahony said, but the police did in 1984, "and dismissed the
case."</TE>
<TE>   In 1986, after Mahony's move to Los Angeles, Nancy Sloan returned
to the Stockton diocese because she was wracked with guilt for not
making sure Father O'Grady never got near another child. O'Grady was
still at the church Mahony had sent him to, but church officials told
Sloan there was nothing to worry about. Sloan, a nurse, weeps as she
tells her story.</TE>
<TE>   "If I had any idea whatsoever when I had gone back there in 1986,
there are so many children who could have been saved from O'Grady,
because I would have blown the story out. And if Mahony says he
didn't know anything about O'Grady, my question is, how could you
possibly do your job as bishop and not read any of the files on your
employees?"</TE>
<TE>   Sloan says she has thought about paying a visit to Mahony.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd like to tell him he has a moral obligation. If any of these
bishops and priests would take responsibility instead of pretending
they didn't know what was going on, and then making excuses ... ,"
she says, not finishing the thought, and pausing to compose herself.</TE>
<TE>   "I have so much guilt for not doing more," she says. "I don't know
how Mahony can live with himself when I can barely live with myself."</TE>

<HD>Roadside Tributes Raise Safety Issue</HD>
<DH>Traffic: The memorials help ease families' pain, but
officials fear people gathered at accident sites such as the one near
Camarillo could get hit.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIMOTHY HUGHES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In December, Paul Bonds watched his 14-year-old daughter Jennifer get
hit by a car and die on Santa Rosa Road near Camarillo.</LD>
<LD>   Every weekday since, Bonds has tended to a collection of flowers,
balloons and candles that mark the site where she was killed.</LD>
<LD>   "When you lose your daughter, your whole world changes," Bonds,
53, said as he stood at the makeshift roadside memorial with his son,
two daughters and a few bystanders. "Everything she was and
everything she will be is gone."</LD>
<TE>   For the Bonds and others who have lost loved ones on state
highways, these tributes serve to honor the victims while easing the
pain of their families.</TE>
<TE>   But the roadside memorials have thrust city and county officials
into the unwitting roles of balancing respect for the dead with
safety concerns and complaints that busy roadways are not the place
for private grieving.</TE>
<TE>   In the case of the Jennifer Bonds memorial, authorities have
received numerous complaints that people gathered at the accident
site have come dangerously close to getting hit by cars themselves,
said Butch Britt, Ventura County deputy director of public works. The
busy two-lane roadway stretches from the Ventura Freeway in Camarillo
to Thousand Oaks.</TE>
<TE>   The almost daily gatherings usually occur about 4:30 p.m., about
the same time when the Camarillo High School student was struck by a
car while jogging with her father. The driver of the vehicle was
driving within the posted 55 mph speed limit and was not cited.</TE>
<TE>   The decision over whether to remove the 4-month-old memorial is
largely Britt's to make.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a judgment call on my part, and I am trying to make the
right decision," he said. "But I'm not real clear on an answer, and
it's not, frankly, something I am anxious to do. I would feel more
confident if Mr. Bonds would remove it on his own and put it on his
property. [Memorials] are what cemeteries are for."</TE>
<TE>   Faced with a similar dilemma last year, Thousand Oaks officials
chose to set a time limit for roadside tributes. They acted after a
spate of traffic fatalities involving teenagers was followed by a
flurry of memorials.</TE>
<TE>   Since August, city officials have enforced what is believed to be
the only city-imposed restrictions on roadside memorials in the
state. The policy places a 30-day time limit on memorials.</TE>
<TE>   Thousand Oaks public works crews had grown concerned over the
amount of debris--which includes everything from faded yearbook
photos to deflated balloons--that eventually winds up scattered on
city streets.</TE>
<TE>   "We had complaints from motorists indicating that items were
considered a safety hazard," said Hans Faber, a landscape maintenance
supervisor who helped craft the new policy. "Residents complained
they could not walk up and down the sidewalks."</TE>
<TE>   Under the policy, sheriff's officials notify the affected families
that after 30 days they must remove all memorial items. If they fail
to comply, city crews will be called in to do the work, Faber said.</TE>
<TE>   All items that may have value -- photographs, candles and other
mementos--are kept in a city warehouse for 14 days. Everything else
is thrown away immediately, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Families and friends of the dead have criticized the effort as an
example of bureaucracy run amok. They have asked how one determines
an appropriate time limit on something as personal and painful as a
person's right to grieve.</TE>
<TE>   "I just think it was a very insensitive thing to do," said
Thousand Oaks resident Kim Whittington, referring to the city's plan.</TE>
<TE>   Whittington's 17-year-old daughter Stephanie was killed last July
after the teenager lost control of her car and spun into oncoming
traffic near Hillcrest Drive and Citation Way.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to a memorial, the site became a regular gathering
place for students from nearby Newbury Park High School, Whittington
said. The memorial was removed by the city in August.</TE>
<TE>   Whittington keeps some items retrieved from the crash site in
Stephanie's bedroom. She also keeps her daughter's cremated remains
in her home and has replanted flowers left behind at the Hillcrest
Drive memorial.</TE>
<TE>   "I am not pleased with what [Thousand Oaks] did," she said. "They
want the city to maintain a certain image and they don't want people
to think anything bad" can happen.</TE>
<TE>   City and sheriff's officials said they had no choice but to take
some action. They said there were at least five memorials on Thousand
Oaks streets in the first half of 2001 after several teenagers died
in separate crashes.</TE>
<TE>   Some were maintained with an almost reverential care, said
Sheriff's Sgt. Patti Salas, traffic supervisor for the local police
agency. Others, including the one for Stephanie, would become the
site of impromptu gatherings near busy streets, she said.</TE>
<TE>   Salas said the city's new policy "is not about wiping someone's
memory away," but about the safety and welfare of others.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a matter of trying to maintain the streets while making sure
the mourners don't become casualties themselves," Salas said. "But we
have to be sensitive."</TE>
<TE>   Besides Thousand Oaks, Placer County in Northern California is the
only other jurisdiction in the state that has rules dealing with
roadside memorials. In January, the Placer County Board of
Supervisors approved replacing roadside tributes with standardized
memorial signs.</TE>
<TE>   "People don't have a right to use other people's right of way for
these memorials because it can become a visual distraction," said Tim
Hackworth, Placer County's director of public works. "We were
concerned that other people would look at the memorial and lose
control and have another accident."</TE>
<TE>   Hackworth said families of victims can order a 12-by-18-inch sign
attached to a wood post with the deceased person's name.</TE>
<TE>   He said relatives are given 30 to 45 days to remove homemade
memorials.</TE>
<TE>   Families also have the option of choosing another sign with the
message "Please Don't Drink and Drive" in large type with the crash
victim's name in smaller letters below. Hackworth said the signs cost
about $100 each and are paid out of the Public Works Department's
operating budget.</TE>
<TE>   Because it's a publicly funded project, no crosses or other
religious symbols are permitted on the signs, which remain in place
for three years, Hackworth said. Each sign is then offered to the
victim's family, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Officials from the California Department of Transportation say
erecting memorials along state highways is forbidden. Plagued by
continuing violations, however, the agency recently launched a
limited sign program. For a $1,000 fee, family members or friends of
those killed on state highways by a drunk driver can have a sign
erected memorializing the deceased. But it's not a simple process,
Caltrans spokesman Duncan McIntosh said.</TE>
<TE>   Before a sign is put in place, an accident report must be
submitted as well as court documents proving the accused was
convicted of drunk driving in connection with the crash, McIntosh
said.</TE>
<TE>   The first Caltrans sign in the state went up in February in the
Antelope Valley near Acton to honor a Caltrans surveyor who was
struck and killed while working on the Antelope Valley Freeway in
July 1992, McIntosh said.</TE>
<TE>   Paul Bonds said whether the current display memorializing his
daughter remains or a permanent sign is put in its place is not
important. Despite an investigation that showed the car that struck
his daughter was not speeding, Bonds is pushing to reduce the speed
limit.</TE>
<TE>   He said he will resist any attempt by the county to force him to
remove his daughter's memorial. He said he wants to convey the
message to passing motorists that Jennifer's death is proof that
Santa Ross Road is unsafe at high speeds.</TE>
<TE>   So far, he has been able to convince some county officials.</TE>
<TE>   Less than a week after his daughter was killed, the Ventura County
Board of Supervisors rejected a proposal for a bypass lane on Santa
Rosa Road after Bonds and other residents complained it would only
encourage speeding.</TE>
<TE>   In February, the board formed a panel of Santa Rosa Valley
residents to study ways to improve safety along the road. The panel,
of which Bonds is a member, is expected to make recommendations
within six months.</TE>
<TE>   Until then, Bonds said, he will continue to visit the accident
site. He stood there with his three adult children on a recent
afternoon. Cars passed and more than a few motorists honked and
waved.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to be here every day so it is safe for our children,"
Bonds said.</TE>
<TE>   "Our best is dead and we're not going to take this. I have nothing
else to do with my life."</TE>

<HD>Thefts Were Petty, but Ruling Won't Be</HD>
<DH>Courts: California's three-strikes law, embodied in cases
of two men, faces U.S. Supreme Court showdown.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CARLA HALL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Leandro Andrade, an unemployed veteran addicted to heroin, walked
into a Kmart in Ontario and stuffed five videos, one by one, into the
waistband of his slacks. His choices: "The Fox and the Hound,"
"Casper," "The Pebble and the Penguin," "Batman Forever" and "Snow
White."</LD>
<LD>   Gary Ewing, a drug addict who suffers from AIDS, walked into the
pro shop of an El Segundo golf course and stuck three Callaway clubs
down his pants leg. As a shop employee would later testify in court,
the odd thing was that Ewing walked in normally but walked out with a
limp.</LD>
<LD>   Andrade, then 37 years old, is now serving a prison sentence of 50
years to life. Ewing, then 38, is in prison for 25 years to life.</LD>
<TE>   Some term it draconian to give out such long sentences for petty
crimes.</TE>
<TE>   But others say the lengthy prison terms meted out under the
state's three-strikes law are justified for those with a long history
of criminal activity.</TE>
<TE>   Now, the U.S. Supreme Court will decide. The high court announced
last week that it would hear the appeals of both Andrade and Ewing,
who allege their rights have been violated by sentences that
constitute cruel and unusual punishment. Although judges have some
discretion under California's three-strikes law--they can decide
whether certain nonviolent crimes should be considered felonies or
misdemeanors--it is the toughest such law in the nation.</TE>
<TE>   The high court's decision could have ramifications for 331
prisoners who are incarcerated for up to life in prison in California
on third-strike convictions involving petty theft. Hundreds more are
in state prison for other nonviolent third strikes, including drug
possession.</TE>
<TE>   "I just answered six letters from people in state prison who said,
'How does that impact my case?'" said C. Christian Cruz, a San
Bernardino County deputy public defender who represented Andrade at
his 1996 trial.</TE>
<TE>   Andrade, now in state prison in Tehachapi, grew up in East Los
Angeles, married and then served in the military overseas, according
to Cruz.</TE>
<TE>   "He did try to support his family monetarily, emotionally and
socially. He wasn't just a bad guy out there living on the streets.
He had continual problems with drugs. We keep incarcerating people
who have drug problems," Cruz said.</TE>
<TE>   The transgressions that would come back to haunt Andrade started
with a rash of Stockton residential burglaries in 1982, all of them
nonviolent and all of which he pleaded guilty to at a court hearing
in 1983. Andrade went to prison for those crimes and was paroled in
late 1986. He later had a marijuana conviction, according to his
appellate attorney, USC law professor Erwin Chemerinsky.</TE>
<TE>   Then came the videotape incident. On Nov. 4, 1995, a Saturday,
Andrade took the five children's videos from the Ontario Kmart.</TE>
<TE>   Two weeks later, he did much the same thing at a Kmart in nearby
Montclair, stealing "Cinderella," "Little Women," "The Santa Clause"
and "Free Willy 2"--all under the watchful gaze of a store employee
standing 20 feet away.</TE>
<TE>   The stolen videotapes were worth about $153 retail. "It was just
before Christmas," Cruz said. "You know who the videos were for?
Family. I believe his sister had some kids."</TE>
<TE>   Because of Andrade's prior convictions, the video thefts were
considered felonies under the three-strikes law. Cruz tried to plead
with and cajole the judge into not treating the crimes as felonies.</TE>
<TE>   "Given that he hasn't picked up any offenses, or not much, in the
last 10 years," Cruz told the judge in 1996, "it's still worth
consideration for a misdemeanor, given the total value and four
wonderful videos which I've watched myself, and I think they're all
very good."</TE>
<TE>   San Bernardino Deputy Dist. Atty. Charles Blackwell said in
opposing a motion by Andrade's lawyers to have a prior conviction set
aside. "Although the instant offense committed by this defendant is
somewhat minor, he has shown his utter disdain for the law by his
15-year history of criminality."</TE>
<TE>   Cruz's plea didn't work. The petty thefts were deemed
felonies--and therefore constituted Andrade's third and fourth
strikes. The judge sentenced him to 25 years to life for each theft.</TE>
<TE>   After an unsuccessful appeal in state courts, Chemerinsky
represented Andrade before the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals,
contending that keeping him in prison until he was at least 87 was
cruel and unusual punishment. The 9th Circuit agreed.</TE>
<TE>   The state attorney general's office then appealed to the U.S.
Supreme Court, which is expected to hear the case in the fall.</TE>
<TE>   Ewing took his challenge directly from state courts to the U.S.
Supreme Court, which agreed to hear his case, too.</TE>
<TE>   Ewing, who is incarcerated at the California Medical Facility in
Vacaville has been ill with AIDS for several years. At the time of
his 2000 trial in Torrance, he was blind in one eye. Deputy Public
Defender Gail Bristo, who represented Ewing at his trial, says he is
now losing sight in the other eye.</TE>
<TE>   Ewing had nine prior convictions, one of them involving the use of
a knife in a residential break-in. "To my knowledge, he scared them
half to death but he didn't physically hurt them," Bristo said.</TE>
<TE>   On the morning of March 12, 2000, Ewing walked into the shop at
the Lakes golf course in El Segundo wearing a dark trench coat. He
purchased a small bucket of golf balls and asked for directions to
the driving range before walking out with three Callaway clubs, each
valued at $399.</TE>
<TE>   At sentencing, Bristo suggested the court consider striking some
of Ewing's previous strikes.</TE>
<TE>   She painted a picture of a terminally ill man with a drug problem
for which he was never treated.</TE>
<TE>   "The likelihood of him committing violent offenses in the future
is minimized," Bristo told the judge.</TE>
<TE>   The public defender noted that several people, including a jail
chaplain, had written letters on Ewing's behalf.</TE>
<TE>   But the facts of his recidivism were grim.</TE>
<TE>   "He has had 10 convictions in his lengthy criminal history for
someone as young as he is," argued Deputy Dist. Atty. Jodi Link. "He
has repeatedly been placed on probation. He has repeatedly failed
miserably at probation. He goes to state prison, he gets paroled. He
fails miserably on parole."</TE>
<TE>   Ewing asked the judge for mercy--a suspended sentence and "a
chance in a drug rehab to get my life together."</TE>
<TE>   He told her, "I don't have very long, and the little time I do
have left to live I want to do something, make myself better. When I
came home [from prison], everything hit me at one time and I left
drug rehab, you know. What really hit me was the loss of my mother,
my brother. My family wasn't there."</TE>
<TE>   But Superior Court Judge Deanne Myers was not persuaded.</TE>
<TE>   She indicated she realized the gravity of the sentence she was
about to impose but believed that Ewing deserved it. Ewing may not be
a violent threat, she said, but he was a threat to society as a
thief.</TE>
<TE>   She noted that less than a year after he was paroled from prison
in 1999, he stole the golf clubs.</TE>
<TE>   "You have hardly been out of the state prison," she said. "There
is just consistent criminal activity."</TE>
<TE>   In deciding to hear the two cases, the U.S. Supreme Court will
have the final say on whether such sentences for petty crimes are
constitutional.</TE>
<TE>   In Gail Bristo's mind, the unfairness of the law is clear. "A life
sentence for three golf clubs was something that really disturbed
me.... He kind of invaded the country club and got a life sentence
for it."</TE>

<HD>Did Errant Driver Have a Death Wish?</HD>
<DH>Tragedy: Long Beach man may have purposely driven his
pickup into a Laguna Niguel couple's car, witnesses say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JACK LEONARD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A 20-year-old man driving the wrong way down a busy Orange County
freeway did nothing to avoid oncoming vehicles before he slammed into
a luxury car, killing himself and a couple on their way to a poetry
reading class, witnesses said Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   Still shaken by their close brush with death in Friday evening's
fiery crash, witnesses Jerry and Barbara Lehman recalled how they
were driving north on the San Joaquin Hills tollway, heading to
dinner with friends, when they saw the headlights of a black Ford
Ranger pickup hurtling toward them.</LD>
<LD>   Jerry Lehman, who was at the wheel of the family Volvo,
instinctively swerved right, rubbing against another car on the
freeway's slow lane as the Ranger rushed past, inches away. Looking
into his rear view mirror, Lehman saw sparks fly as the pickup truck,
driven by Steven McLin of Long Beach, struck a Jaguar S-Type car that
had been immediately behind the Lehmans.</LD>
<TE>   "He was coming very fast--head on," recalled Barbara Lehman, 56.
"It looked like it was totally intentional, almost like it was a
suicide."</TE>
<TE>   The Lehmans stopped their car and ran 300 yards back to the
accident scene to see if they could help the injured.</TE>
<TE>   "There weren't any skid marks at all [on the freeway]," said Jerry
Lehman, 60. "I don't think he made any effort at all to stop."</TE>
<TE>   California Highway Patrol officers released few details Saturday
about their investigation of why McLin was driving on the wrong side
of the road.</TE>
<TE>   Killed along with McLin were the passenger and driver of the
Jaguar: Farzad Yaganeh and his wife, Fereshteh Sadeghi, both 41. The
Laguna Niguel couple, who had two daughters, 7 and 12, were on their
way to a reading of Iranian poetry in Irvine.</TE>
<TE>   Clad in black, friends and relatives gathered at the couple's home
Saturday. The two were college sweethearts and remained devoted after
17 years of marriage, friends said.</TE>
<TE>   "They were very much in love," said Mahasti Sadighi, a close
friend of the couple.</TE>
<TE>   "It was good that they died together. They couldn't have survived
without each other. They were always together."</TE>
<TE>   They came to the United States shortly before the 1979 Iranian
revolution and met as college students in Boston. Yaganeh owned an
Orange County property rental and investment business, said his
brother-in-law, Tony Sadeghi.</TE>
<TE>   Yaganeh's wife worked until recently as a commodities broker in
Aliso Viejo. But two months ago, she decided to quit work so she
could spend more time with her daughters, Sadighi said.</TE>
<TE>   The couple, she said, were fixtures at their girls' elementary
school, volunteering to take students on field trips and helping with
grading.</TE>
<TE>   Friday evening, the couple were heading to a meeting of the
Persian poetry group they attended each week.</TE>
<TE>   Shortly before 6:18 p.m., the CHP said, McLin drove his brand-new
pickup up an offramp and onto the freeway at Bonita Canyon Road.
Whether he did so mistakenly remains unclear. His family could not be
reached for comment.</TE>
<TE>   About two miles up the freeway from the offramp, McLin's pickup
whizzed by the Lehmans' car before smashing into the Jaguar.</TE>
<TE>   When the Lehmans made their way back to the crash scene, they saw
the pickup split in two. The rear of the Ranger lay atop a Toyota
Tacoma pickup whose driver, Debbie Kellog of Costa Mesa, escaped
serious injury.</TE>
<TE>   McLin and Sadeghi were already dead. Yaganeh was on the side of
the road. He was airlifted to Western Medical Center-Santa Ana and
later pronounced dead.</TE>
<TE>   "It was terrifying," said Barbara Lehman. "That was the closest
I've ever come to death. It could have been us."</TE>

<HD>Long Beach Mayor's Race Has Surprises</HD>
<DH>Politics: A strong gay candidate, a write-in campaign and
newly active minority groups are making things lively in diverse
city.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NANCY WRIDE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Long Beach mayor governs California's fifth-largest city, and the
job demands serving at least two starkly different communities.</LD>
<LD>   One is the middle-class population that generally owns property,
lives near the shore, university or country club--and is most likely
to vote in Tuesday's municipal election.</LD>
<LD>   The other is the low-income population, which may be as high as
half of the estimated 461,000 residents in a built-out city that,
like much of the region, lacks affordable housing.</LD>
<TE>   Primarily African American, Latino and Cambodian, this population
lives primarily in the west or central neighborhoods and is least
likely to vote.</TE>
<TE>   But new plot twists have emerged in the election script of this
city, which is home to a large gay population but is more
conservative than West Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   * The union at the Police Department, which only a few years ago
had its first gay officer come out, endorsed openly gay Vice Mayor
Dan Baker for mayor.</TE>
<TE>   * The write-in campaign for popular incumbent Beverly O'Neill, a
former college president who termed out as mayor yet won endorsement
by the Long Beach Press-Telegram and the formidable Greater Long
Beach Chamber of Commerce, appears by some polls to be doing better
than expected.</TE>
<TE>   * For the first time, the city's dozens of black churches and
community groups are joining Cambodian refugees to get out the vote,
and have endorsed Norm Ryan for mayor. Ryan, who also won
endorsements from the Green Party and the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers
Assn., has appealed to African American and Cambodian residents as an
outsider who actually got something done--writing a proposition that
reduced utility taxes.</TE>
<TE>   "I've heard over and over again that 'those people' don't vote,"
Ryan said of the African American and Cambodian communities. "But
angry people do vote. I'm hoping that will get many people to the
polls."</TE>
<TE>   There are seven candidates for mayor, and numerous candidates for
five of the nine City Council seats. The city prosecutor also is up
for reelection.</TE>
<TE>   But in a city the size of Portland, Ore., the centerpiece race is
for mayor, a job that pays $90,000 but has no voting power beyond the
veto.</TE>
<TE>   The winner will be faced with trying to bridge all sides of Long
Beach to ferry this port city into stable economic times.</TE>
<TE>   Long Beach was among the American cities hardest hit by the last
decade's aerospace and military downsizing.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the mayoral candidates have talked about the need to
continue the city's economic growth, but they quibble over how to go
about it. Should the city drive even harder toward becoming a
convention and tourist destination? Focus on neighborhood retail
development? Stick with the delayed $700-million Queensway Bay
waterfront project, or abandon it for a big park?</TE>
<TE>   But various community groups have tried to focus the debate on the
vexing problems of poverty, homelessness and a dire lack of housing.</TE>
<TE>   Those are problems facing other cities, but they become magnified
in such a big city, which is among the country's most racially
diverse. They are also issues of particular concern in the black
community.</TE>
<TE>   "Over the past several years, the African American voice in the
city of Long Beach has been quelled," said the Rev. Michael J. Ealey,
who is leading the African American Unity Coalition seeking to offer
one voice for black residents, churches and businesses.</TE>
<TE>   The crowded field of mayoral candidates features O'Neill, whom
supporters praise for boosting the city's image nationally by working
with Washington and business to promote the city's attributes and
international shipping port. She has served, they say, as an
ambassador at a time when the city sorely needed one.</TE>
<TE>   Although write-in campaigns are seldom successful, O'Neill's
mailers and success at getting the city to put pencils at polls make
her shot stronger than would be typical, according to consultants on
other campaign races.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to Baker and Ryan, candidates for mayor include
Councilman Ray Grabinski, police Cpl. John Stolpe, construction
contractor David Wong and Bob Livingstone, a coach and teacher.</TE>
<TE>   Grabinski, a resource coordinator for the University of
California, is thought to have strong name recognition and has been
on and off the City Council since the early 1980s.</TE>
<TE>   Having served two consecutive terms, by law the city limit, his
seat will be vacated. He has a populist speaking style, and opponents
of the Queensway Bay waterfront development and expansion of a police
substation at a park have voiced support for him.</TE>
<TE>   Despite being a relative newcomer to city politics, Baker was
early on the handicapped favorite, having raised the most money and
won endorsements from influential forces, such as the police union
and the Gay and Lesbian Victory Fund. He won benefits for gay city
employees and has vowed, among other things, to address environmental
issues including coke dust generated by the Port of Long Beach. Ryan
serves on the public safety commission but has earned more ink for
writing the successful city ballot Proposition J, which cut utility
taxes.</TE>

<HD>New Alameda Corridor Has Historic Roots</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It took about 150 years, but the river-on-wheels that a Los Angeles
pioneer once envisioned from the pueblo to the harbor is at last
coming true with this Friday's opening of the $2.4-billion high-speed
rail line known as the Alameda Corridor.</LD>
<LD>   The Alameda Corridor will be the new asphalt version of the Los
Angeles River, moving cargo back and forth between the port and
downtown.</LD>
<LD>   Long before 18-wheelers and freeways, Phineas T. Banning was the
"King of Transportation" and "Father of the Los Angeles Harbor,"
hauling people and freight along this same route 133 years ago.</LD>
<TE>   He was a pioneer, mule-skinner and entrepreneur. Using his charm,
wit and political clout as a state senator, in 1868 he won the
right-of-way on a new road called the Dominguez Route--now Alameda
Street--and built a 21-mile railway that unlocked the door to Los
Angeles' first business boom. Banning cut major deals and won
government contracts to build roads and ship supplies by wagon to
posts at Ft. Tejon; Yuma, Ariz.; and Tucson. He opened a rich trade
arrangement with Mormon leader Brigham Young that sent hundreds of
covered wagons of goods to Salt Lake City.</TE>
<TE>   But it was Banning's tiny railroad linking the harbor to Los
Angeles that eventually lured the Southern Pacific Railroad south,
transforming the dusty cow town into a sprawling metropolis.</TE>
<TE>   In 1851, when the Delaware-born, 21-year-old Banning arrived in
San Pedro, not much had changed since sailor and author Richard Henry
Dana Jr. had declared the boggy area of the harbor "the hell of
California."</TE>
<TE>   Banning saw possibilities in this place and soon became a partner
in a fledgling freight-transportation company. His reputation as a
businessman grew, as did his prowess for driving a six-horse
stagecoach faster, over rougher roads and better than any other
driver who cracked the whip.</TE>
<TE>   He cut quite a picture working at the harbor: coatless, without a
necktie, sleeves rolled up, wearing pants that stopped six inches
short of his ankles and bright red suspenders that would become his
trademark.</TE>
<TE>   Cleaned up, he caught the eye of Southerner Rebecca Sanford, whom
he married in 1854. She died in 1868 while giving birth to their
eighth child.</TE>
<TE>   Months later, he proposed to 22-year-old Mary Hollister, who gave
him three more children.</TE>
<TE>   Banning spent much of his time trying to make transportation
between the city and the harbor faster, more comfortable and more
profitable. Encouraging civic leaders to build a major transportation
route between the San Fernando and Santa Clarita valleys in 1854, he
invited potential investors to ride in his stagecoach as he proved
that travel was possible over the treacherous route.</TE>
<TE>   But when he reached the top of the mountain pass, the frightened
passengers got out. The intrepid Banning set out alone. The
stagecoach and horses tumbled down the mountain, a jumble of
splinters, chains and panicked animals. Banning emerged from the
wreckage saying: "Didn't I tell you so? Far easier than I thought it
would be."</TE>
<TE>   The group conceded the point and coughed up several thousand
dollars. Within a year, in 1855, a wagon train of five 10-mule teams
made the trip from Los Angeles to Ft. Tejon in nine days, opening
trade between Los Angeles and the north.</TE>
<TE>   In 1857, when a storm ripped apart his San Pedro wharf, Banning
bought 640 more acres five miles away to build a new wharf and town.</TE>
<TE>   It was known as Goose Town and soon ridiculed as "Banning's
Hog-Waller," a place where bulrushes, marshes and sandbars provided a
refuge for waterfowl and a paradise for hunters. Using hand pumps and
mud scows, Banning sucked away the shallow pools and filled the
marshes to build a shipping wharf at the end of what is now Avalon
Boulevard. There he carved out a town--five miles closer to Los
Angeles than San Pedro--and called it New San Pedro, later renaming
it Wilmington, after the capital of his home state.</TE>
<TE>   At the start of the Civil War, the U.S. Army moved south from Ft.
Tejon to safeguard the port of Wilmington. On land that Banning
donated for the Drum Barracks, the Army processed and trained
thousands of volunteers, including a battalion of Mormons. The Mormon
volunteers were assigned to live on a small island in the harbor and
build barges and tugboats. The 30-acre island became known as Mormon
Island, a designation it maintains today, even though it has since
been connected to the mainland. Banning wined and dined Army
officers, and in so doing won their hauling contracts. "His good
nature and his champagne were always on tap," a friend observed.</TE>
<TE>   For his trouble, he was appointed a brigadier general of the state
militia. Although his unit was never called up, his vanity got the
better of him and he insisted on being called "General."</TE>
<TE>   He went on to win two two-year terms to the state Senate beginning
in 1865, running for the sole purpose of building Los Angeles' first
railroad.</TE>
<TE>   Public despair and economic collapse set in after the war. Banning
sought to pull Los Angeles out of the doldrums and point it in the
right direction. He was tired of all the years of nothing but talk of
building a railroad, of increased harbor traffic and of more rivals
trying to muscle their way into his shipping enterprise.</TE>
<TE>   In 1868, Banning's railroad bill passed the Legislature and
Angelenos approved the $225,000 bond for the S.P. &amp; L.A. Railroad by
a 28-vote margin. Banning, a major stockholder in the railroad--a
conflict that did not trouble most people at the time--was awarded
the construction contract. Only one hurdle remained: whether to lay
the north-south tracks east or west of Dominguez Hill, a
175-foot-high landmark now known as the historic Dominguez Adobe
Museum, between Alameda Street and Central Avenue in Dominguez Hills.</TE>
<TE>   Banning favored the "Dominguez Route," drier and not as steep as
the marshy "Lake Route" west of the hill. The Lake Route was strongly
favored by railroad president and former Gov. John G. Downey, whose
ranch it crossed. Banning's forceful personality won the
argument--and made him a bitter enemy in Downey.</TE>
<TE>   The Dominguez Route--later Railroad Avenue, now Alameda
Street--was destined to become Los Angeles' major artery, pulsing
with the lifeblood of international trade dollars from across the
globe.</TE>
<TE>   On Oct. 26, 1869, more than five months after the Golden Spike was
driven at Promontory, Utah, creating a seamless transcontinental
route, Los Angeles' first railway south of the Tehachapi Mountains
opened.</TE>
<TE>   The San Pedro &amp; Los Angeles Railroad carried 1,500 passengers
south from the new barn-like Los Angeles Depot at Commercial and
Alameda streets to the Dominguez Hill depot and on to Wilmington
harbor. On the locomotive, a sign painter lettered "LOS ANGELOS," an
error discovered just in the nick of time for the maiden run.</TE>
<TE>   Setting a tight timetable for two trains a day, Banning charged
$2.50 per passenger and $5 a ton for freight. Towns such as Florence,
four miles south of downtown, began to sprout up, changing the
landscape along the tracks. Alameda and Commercial streets quickly
became the industrial center of town.</TE>
<TE>   For more than three years, Banning's twin engines, "Los Angeles"
and "San Pedro," chugged back and forth. Cowboys made a sport of
racing the great iron horse. In 1873, the rail line was used as bait
to lure Southern Pacific over the mountains and into Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   In 1875, Banning's dream was realized as Wilmington boomed and the
first large seagoing steamer, the Los Angeles, carrying 350
passengers, pulled alongside his wharf in the new deep-water port.</TE>
<TE>   In 1885, the champion of modern transport stepped off a San
Francisco streetcar and was run over by a horse-drawn taxicab. Soon
after, the "King of Transportation" died at age 55.</TE>
<TE>   Banning's seaport was eventually absorbed by the Port of Los
Angeles, and his railway is now the Alameda Corridor. His legacy is
preserved in the desert town of Banning, once a stagecoach stop, and
at his 1864 24-room Greek Revival-style mansion and stagecoach barn
at the Banning Residence Museum in Wilmington.</TE>

<HD>These Endangered Mice Will Have It Nice</HD>
<DH>Land: Rodent's historic stamping grounds is worth $30
million. Building industry sought 'more logical' option of moving
population.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SEEMA MEHTA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The last time federal wildlife biologists tried to gauge the Pacific
pocket mouse population at the Dana Point Headlands, they counted
only six of the endangered rodents. However, more than 24 acres of
ocean-view real estate--worth $30 million--is being set aside for
their protection.</LD>
<LD>   The mouse preserve is an important issue in a developer's attempt
to create 125 lots for custom ocean-view homes, a 65-room seaside inn
and commercial development on the 121-acre property. Property rights
advocates question preserving so much valuable land for so few
animals.</LD>
<LD>   "That doesn't make much sense," said Laer Pearce, spokesman for
the Building Industry Assn. of Southern California. "Doesn't it seem
like moving them is a much more logical option than preserving that
much land for them?"</LD>
<TE>   The construction project has received local approval, as well as
permits from state and federal wildlife officials. However, Headlands
Reserve LLC still must pass muster with the California Coastal
Commission, a powerful state agency that has stalled and modified
many projects along Orange County's coast.</TE>
<TE>   ''This mouse basically is going to be living on a nicer lot than
me," said developer Sanford Edward, who plans to build a home for
himself on the Headlands.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Edward says he's willing to sacrifice the land to get quick
approval for his project.</TE>
<TE>   "Even though we're doing it for the habitat and the mouse, we
recognize that the headlands portion of the property has become a
landmark in and of itself," he said. "So we've been willing to
consider relinquishing our development rights ... in hopes that we
will be able to move forward in a timely fashion."</TE>
<TE>   Little is known about the Pacific pocket mouse, a small, silky
mammal with fur-lined cheek pouches that was listed as endangered in
1994. Its historic range--sandy land no more than two miles from the
coast--stretched from Marina del Rey to the Tijuana Estuary, but the
burrowing mouse is now known to exist in only three places. In
addition to the six mice counted on the Headlands, they are found at
two spots on Camp Pendleton--about 50 mice live along the San Mateo
Creek, and up to 1,000 mice dwell north of the Santa Margarita River.</TE>
<TE>   Environmentalists argue that for the species to recover, it's
necessary to save as much of their habitat as possible.</TE>
<TE>   "They've been there for a long time and they've survived a lot of
neglect," said Dan Silver, coordinator of the Endangered Habitats
League. "Hopefully, with proper management, they will rebound. We
look upon it as vital. There are so few of these animals left that
you have to keep every one of these places going."</TE>
<TE>   Wildlife officials say the population at the Headlands is up for
debate. They counted six in 2000, but the number could be higher,
said Will Miller, a biologist in the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's
Carlsbad office.</TE>
<TE>   "I wouldn't say that's an accurate estimate of the population," he
said, "but the numbers are low.... We don't know enough about [the
species] to know definitively if the population is doomed or not."</TE>
<TE>   The population is small enough, though, that the mice could be
inbreeding, a threat to their future health. Once homeowners move in,
pets could prey on the rodents.</TE>
<TE>   "Domestic cats ... are extremely efficient predators, as I think
anyone that's had a pet can testify to in terms of them bringing home
local songbirds," Miller said.</TE>
<TE>   Nor is life necessarily safe for the other two populations. The
proposed Foothill South toll road may run near the creek and military
training exercises take place at the Marine Corps base.</TE>
<TE>   Permanent conservation of the 24 acres at the Headlands is a step
in the right direction and fits with the recovery plan for the
species, Miller said.</TE>
<TE>   Conservationists point to other animals brought back from far
lower numbers. The Przewalski's horse was down to 12 individuals, all
in captivity. Now there are 1,200 of the wild horses, many of which
are thriving in their native Mongolia.</TE>
<TE>   That's why environmentalists have petitioned the federal
government to protect the three mouse habitats, as well as 13
unoccupied swaths of land in Orange and San Diego counties that could
support new mouse populations.</TE>
<TE>   Miller said the service has been looking at areas where it could
establish pocket mouse populations.</TE>
<TE>   Edward said such moves are key to the species recovery. Otherwise,
he said, isolated populations, such as the mice at the Headlands,
might not survive.</TE>

<HD>With Growth, Northern Cities Stake a Claim to More Water</HD>
<DH>Resources: Invoking the 70-year-old 'area-of-origin'
statutes could shrink Southern California's supplies.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NANCY VOGEL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>FAIRFIELD, Calif.</DL>
<LD>This city to the east of San Francisco Bay is trying to cash in on a
promise made a lifetime ago.</LD>
<LD>   Invoking a 70-year-old law that was passed to keep one region from
drying up another, Fairfield and two neighboring cities are seeking
rights to water that for decades has been shipped south. Experts say
their application could inspire others in the north to do the same,
eventually shrinking Southern California's water supplies.</LD>
<LD>   The Bay Area cities argue that they have priority over Southern
California to take water from Barker Slough, which drains into the
Sacramento River. As justification, they point to a state law passed
not long after Los Angeles commandeered the water of the Owens Valley
and doomed its farms to dust and desolation. The law was designed to
ensure that growth in cities and counties along major rivers would
not be stymied by projects that diverted water hundreds of miles
away.</LD>
<TE>   Fairfield, Benicia and Vacaville have asked the state Water
Resources Control Board to grant them rights to enough water to
supply 155,000 people for a year--water that would otherwise be
channeled to San Joaquin Valley farms and Southland cities.</TE>
<TE>   "We're growing, we need the water and we don't have other
sources," said Rick Wood, Fairfield's assistant director of public
works.</TE>
<TE>   The cities' application is one of the first to push the boundaries
of what are known as California's "area of origin" laws. And it won't
be the last, many experts predict.</TE>
<TE>   These laws will get more attention, some say, because little water
is left for the taking and a new law requires builders of 500 or more
homes to prove they've got adequate water supplies. That requirement,
which took effect in January, will force many communities to legally
quantify their water rights instead of simply assuming the water will
be there when it's needed. Applying for more water under the old
area-of-origin statutes might be the easiest way for some cities and
counties to expand their supplies and justify growth.</TE>
<TE>   "We're going to see more and more petitions under these statutes,
because the Sacramento River is over-appropriated and the San Joaquin
River is over-appropriated and people are running out of water for
growth," said Michael Jackson, a Plumas County attorney for the
Regional Council of Rural Counties.</TE>
<TE>   Southern California water officials acknowledge that growth to the
north will cut into their supplies--planners decades ago assumed as
much--but nobody knows to what degree.</TE>
<TE>   The only recent application under such statutes to reach a final
decision by the state water board involved El Dorado County's request
to take more water--enough to supply nearly 90,000 people for a
year--from the American River east of Sacramento. The board granted
the county the water last year, with some conditions.
Environmentalists concerned that the increased diversion of water
will harm Sierra lakes and trigger explosive growth have challenged
the decision in court.</TE>
<TE>   Area-of-origin laws date to 1931, only a few years after desperate
Owens Valley farmers dynamited the Los Angeles aqueduct. Government
engineers at the time were plotting to shift the flow of northern
rivers south in schemes even more audacious than Los Angeles' tapping
of the Eastern Sierra.</TE>
<TE>   The 1931 law and several that followed decree that even though
huge quantities of water could be pumped hundreds of miles from
California's major rivers, communities near those rivers would get
priority to take more water when they grew enough to need it.</TE>
<TE>   The law does not guarantee the communities more water. They still
must apply to the state, show a need for it and, if necessary, build
a system to capture and move the water--a proposition too expensive
for many rural Northern California counties. The law simply gives
these "areas of origin" the opportunity to get higher standing in
terms of water rights than those cities and farms served by state and
federal water projects.</TE>
<TE>   "The whole logic of the statute is that, even though the water's
been exported to other areas for many years, if the water is now
needed in the area of origin, it should be possible to recapture
what's needed," said Harrison "Hap" Dunning, a retired UC Davis law
professor.</TE>
<TE>   For decades, the statutes have been fairly passive protections.
Many Northern California irrigation districts and cities had locked
up generous water rights long before the federal and state
governments built the dams and canals that serve Southern California.
For many years, those rights have ensured enough water for new farms
and subdivisions in the north.</TE>
<TE>   But now, in some places, that slack is disappearing. In the last
few years, water seekers have begun to lean on the area-of-origin
statutes.</TE>
<TE>   "What's happening is what you'd expect," said Fairfield's Wood.
"On the fringes of the Bay Area, where the development is occurring
and reaching out into the Central Valley, that's where you're going
to see this applied first."</TE>
<TE>   Largely untested by courts, the statutes may be tricky to apply.</TE>
<TE>   The statutes bestow protections on "watersheds," and it is fairly
simple to define the area that drains into a stream by watching which
way the rain runs off the land. But the laws also extend to areas
"immediately adjacent" to a watershed and "conveniently" supplied
with water from that area. That's more difficult to define, water
experts say.</TE>
<TE>   It's not clear, for example, whether Fairfield, Vacaville and
Benicia exist within the "area of origin" of the Sacramento River.
Benicia drains to the Carquinez Strait--a narrow neck of water that
dumps the flow of Sacramento and San Joaquin rivers into the bay.</TE>
<TE>   That's an issue the state water board may wrestle with when it
opens hearings on the cities' petition in June.</TE>
<TE>   Other applications are pending. A water district near Stockton
seeks to use the area-of-origin laws to get more reliable water
deliveries from a federal reservoir on the Stanislaus River.</TE>
<TE>   And the vast Westlands Water District near Fresno last year
applied to take a third of the flow of the over-tapped San Joaquin
River under the premise that the river runs through Fresno County.
That petition enraged farmers in nearby water districts who would see
their supplies cut drastically if Westlands wins its case.</TE>
<TE>   If granted by the powerful water board, these applications would
shift enough water to serve 3.5 million people for a year away from
San Joaquin Valley irrigators and southern coastal cities. That's a
significant chunk of the average 3.7 million acre-feet of
water--enough to serve 19 million people--that is pumped south each
year from the confluence of the Sacramento and San Joaquin rivers.</TE>
<TE>   Southern California water officials seem unfazed by the
area-of-origin applications. They say they stand by the Legislature's
promise.</TE>
<TE>   "There are legitimate area-of-origin projects that will come
online and will negatively impact supplies for Southern California,"
said Tim Quinn, a vice president with the Metropolitan Water
District. "But we have to honor the deal we struck a half-century
ago."</TE>
<TE>   But those who depend on water pumped from the north also say they
will be on guard against overreaching by water users there. The
Department of Water Resources, which operates the State Water
Project, has challenged the Bay Area cities' application.</TE>
<TE>   "We support the area-of-origin concept," said John Coburn, general
manager of State Water Contractors, a group of 29 cities and
irrigation districts served by the State Water Project. "However,
when you get into the definition of terms like 'conveniently
adjacent,' that's where we've got concerns.</TE>
<TE>   "Where would you draw the line?" he asked. "That's an issue that's
going to be coming at [the state water board]."</TE>
<TE>   Fairfield stands ready to make its case, Wood says.</TE>
<TE>   The town sits upstream of the watery maze that is the
Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, where big government pumping plants
feed the canals that stretch hundreds of miles south.</TE>
<TE>   Once a small farm town, Fairfield has become a bustling city of
98,000, a sanctuary for families fleeing San Francisco's costly real
estate. It is home to several candy factories, a Budweiser brewery
and an Air Force base.</TE>
<TE>   Fairfield, Benicia and Vacaville have grown by 20% in the last 10
years, and civic leaders figure to add another 78,000 residents in
the next two decades--enough to outstrip water supplies in dry years.</TE>
<TE>   "If we don't get something from this process," said Wood, "I think
there's going to be a feeling of betrayal that goes back to the Owens
Valley."</TE>

<HD>One Small Step for Rocket Science</HD>
<DH>Education: Students and adult hobbyists vie to see who can
launch a soda bottle the highest at O.C. competition.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DANIEL YI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>They came equipped with little more than empty soda bottles,
cardboard paper, masking tape and enthusiasm. Lots and lots of
enthusiasm.</LD>
<LD>   "I've never been in a competition like this," said 13-year-old
Jesus Sanchez from Carver Middle School in South-Central Los Angeles.
"I was so excited I couldn't sleep. I went to bed like at 12:30."</LD>
<LD>   Saturday morning, Jesus and nine classmates were standing on a
soggy field at Tustin High School for the seventh annual rocket
competition sponsored by Future Scientists and Engineers of America.</LD>
<TE>   The Stanton-based nonprofit promotes after-school science programs
nationwide. The rocket competition draws mostly Southland students,
but also adult hobbyists. About 100 contestants were busy Saturday
morning putting last-minute touches on their creations or building
brand-new rockets. It was the first time for the Carver contingency,
brought by their science teacher, Ari Sussman, a New York native who
two years ago joined Teach for America, the national teachers corps
that sends recruits to disadvantaged inner-city schools.</TE>
<TE>   "My first year, I was just trying to survive," said Sussman, a
soft-spoken 24-year-old who admits he was initially overwhelmed by
the "millions of challenges" of teaching in an overcrowded,
underfunded public school. "This year, I'm trying to have more
activities for my students."</TE>
<TE>   The rockets are made from plastic soda bottles fitted with plastic
foam wings and detachable, cardboard cone heads. The cone is supposed
to split from the body at the top of the rocket's climb, allowing the
parachute to deploy. The rocket with the longest time in the air
wins.</TE>
<TE>   Sussman's students Guillermo Aravina and Mario Quijada, both 13,
were ready to test their entry, a gray concoction with a painted
shark's face and "Jaws" scrawled on the side.</TE>
<TE>   The rockets are filled with water and pressurized air. The water
gives the projectiles mass and propulsion, but too much water can
weigh the whole thing down.</TE>
<TE>   Guillermo and Mario waited in anticipation before a practice
launch. They donned protective goggles and handed their rocket to an
adult volunteer who plugged the bottle with an air hose.</TE>
<TE>   Guillermo rubbed his hands before pulling on the cord that would
release the air. Psst, thud. The rocket made an arc about 30 feet
high before landing. No parachute.</TE>
<TE>   "Ya perdimos," Guillermo said in Spanish. "We are toast."</TE>
<TE>   But Sussman was not about to give up. He suggested his students
cut a little bit off the top to help extricate the parachute and
decrease the weight.</TE>
<TE>   The students ran in search of scissors. They were back a short
time later with a shorter version of "Jaws."</TE>
<TE>   This time, the rocket careened straight up in a stream of water,
the shark's head tumbled in the air, the parachute rolled out and ...
success.</TE>
<TE>   "We did it Mr. Sussman," Guillermo said. The clock marked 8.7
seconds.</TE>
<TE>   Jesus and his friend Miguel Lopez, 12, continued to work at a
nearby table on their rocket, the colorful "Chicano."</TE>
<TE>   "If there was a prize for artistic expression," said Sussman,
"we'd take home a medal."</TE>
<TE>   Jesus wanted to know if the strings on the parachute should be
equally spaced. Yes, Sussman told him.</TE>
<TE>   "But why?" Jesus asked.</TE>
<TE>   "It has to be symmetrical so the wind catches it evenly," Sussman
explained.</TE>
<TE>   "Oh!" was the answer.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Guillermo and Mario continued to trim their shark,
logging ever higher times.</TE>
<TE>   Another trial run and the rocket clocked 10.07 seconds. The
students and teacher traded high-fives.</TE>
<TE>   Their glory was short-lived. As their times improved, so did those
of their competitors.</TE>
<TE>   But Sussman's students seemed unfazed and continued to work
diligently on their rockets. Renee Nash, 12, and friend Faysha
Thomas, 13, were the only girls in the group.</TE>
<TE>   "We are representing the females," said Renee, who wants to become
a "cosmetologist for the dead," because funeral homes are "where the
money is."</TE>
<TE>   None of Sussman's students wants to be a rocket scientist, but
each has dreams.</TE>
<TE>   "The challenge is to think up good plans to keep these kids
engaged," Sussman later said. "Days like today, that's when you see
you are making an impact."</TE>

<HD>Mother's Tragic Tale a Lesson for Truants</HD>
<DH>Crime: By sharing the story of her daughter, who was killed
in 1998, the Ventura woman works through her own rage and guilt and
helps teenagers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TRACY WILSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Before she speaks, Shelly Holland scans the faces of a dozen teenage
truants slouched in plastic chairs and staring at her with
indifference.</LD>
<LD>   She has come to this Oxnard classroom, where police run an
after-school program for wayward teens, to tell the story of her own
daughter. She passes around a faded photograph and a tiny
silver-and-glass vial she wears on a chain around her neck.</LD>
<LD>   "So what do you think this is?" she asks the teens as they
silently examine the finger-thin decanter. "No guesses? This is my
daughter in this little bottle. She called one night and said, 'Mom,
I'll be right home; leave the door open,' and she never came home."</LD>
<TE>   Nichole Hendrix, 17, was stabbed and beaten to death, allegedly by
two skinhead gang members who mistakenly thought she had reported
them to police for selling stolen property.</TE>
<TE>   Her body was packed into a trash can filled with wet cement and
dumped into the Ventura County back country. When it was recovered
six months later, animals had dragged away most of the remains.</TE>
<TE>   "When I got her back, all that was left were three ribs, her head
and her pelvic bone," Holland tells the teens. "That is why she fits
in this little bottle."</TE>
<TE>   During the past few months, Holland, 40, of Ventura has appeared
five times as a guest speaker for the Student Truancy Offender
Program, which strives to keep youths cited for truancy in class and
out of Juvenile Hall.</TE>
<TE>   Though it's difficult, she talks about her experiences because she
knows firsthand that skipping school and doing drugs often lead to
more serious crime, and she hopes that her daughter's story will
prompt some teens to rethink the choices they make.</TE>
<TE>   "My daughter is dead and there is nothing I can do to bring her
back," Holland said of Nichole, one of two children by her first
marriage, who would have turned 21 today.</TE>
<TE>   "But if I could help one kid change their mind about the life they
are leading, then that is one less kid that grows up to be a thug or
a victim," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Many parents of crime victims turn to political activism and
volunteer causes as a way of coping with their grief. Some of the
most sweeping changes in public policy trace their roots to mothers
whose children were killed by drunk drivers, or fathers whose
daughters were kidnapped and slain.</TE>
<TE>   Holland's crusade exists on a more intimate scale.</TE>
<TE>   "She has a lot of issues she's dealing with and this is a way to
get it out," said Oxnard Police Senior Officer Karl Dyer, who
supervises the truancy program and asked Holland to share her
experiences.</TE>
<TE>   "She really wanted to talk to kids and tell her story to help deal
with her pain," Dyer said. "I jumped all over it, because it is a
good opportunity for the kids to hear what can really happen."</TE>
<TE>   During her presentations, Holland talks about her struggles
raising a rebellious girl who in middle school began skipping class
and experimenting with drugs.</TE>
<TE>   At one point, she followed her daughter to class every day for a
month to make sure she wasn't ditching. She didn't know what else to
do, she said.</TE>
<TE>   Nichole transferred to a continuation high school, but problems
persisted. When Holland picked up her daughter from the police
station after a drug-related arrest Oct. 15, 1998, she warned her:
"Nikki, something bad is going to happen to you if you don't
straighten up."</TE>
<TE>   Nichole was killed that same night.</TE>
<TE>   Holland is haunted by her words. She wonders whether she could
have done more to prevent her daughter's death.</TE>
<TE>   Just days before her disappearance, Nichole had agreed to enter a
lock-down drug rehabilitation program in Arizona.</TE>
<TE>   "She knew she needed help," Holland said. "She wasn't a perfect
person, but as a mother you don't want to see those things. And for
her to be killed, and so much left unsaid ...."</TE>
<TE>   After three years, Holland still fights to keep her emotions in
check. Regret, rage, guilt and depression have left her raw and
nursing an ulcer.</TE>
<TE>   In the crazed days that followed Nichole's disappearance, Holland
paged her repeatedly. She hounded Ventura County sheriff's detectives
for information and refused to leave the house, fearful Nichole would
call and no one would be there.</TE>
<TE>   As weeks and months passed, Holland ventured out seeking answers.</TE>
<TE>   She looked in ditches and called morgues in seven states and
Mexico. Frustrated by the investigation, she walked neighborhoods
frequented by drug sellers and knocked on doors in search of
information.</TE>
<TE>   "I did some crazy things," she said during a recent presentation.
"But I don't think what I did was any different from what any other
parent would do."</TE>
<TE>   While her work with the truancy program is cathartic, it has also
been a distraction from the protracted legal issues unfolding in the
murder cases pending against her daughter's alleged killers.</TE>
<TE>   Skinheads David Ziesmer, 29, and Michael Bridgeford, 25, both of
Oxnard, were indicted on murder charges in August 2000 after
admitting in interviews to stabbing Nichole. A grand jury also
indicted Bridget Callahan, 30, of Ventura for murder. She allegedly
witnessed the slaying.</TE>
<TE>   Legal Disputes Put Trials on Hold</TE>
<TE>   Trials for the trio were scheduled to begin this month but are on
hold, pending legal disputes.</TE>
<TE>   Callahan's lawyers last fall accused prosecutors of deceiving her
with false promises of immunity. The misconduct allegations, which
came amid a contested election for Ventura County district attorney,
led the state attorney general's office to take over the case.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, the case suffered another setback when state
prosecutors dismissed Callahan's indictment after reviewing a ruling
by a Santa Barbara judge, who found the grand jury contained too few
women and was therefore "defective."</TE>
<TE>   Callahan was arraigned on new murder charges Friday. Meanwhile,
Ziesmer is trying to have his indictment dismissed on the grand jury
issue. A hearing is set for next month.</TE>
<TE>   Through it all, Holland has watched in frustration from the front
row of a Ventura County courtroom.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't even imagine how it feels to be so helpless," she said.
"There are days I just want to scream."</TE>
<TE>   And there are days she wants to talk. So she talks to her
counselor. She talks to the parents of other crime victims she has
met, and she talks to the teens in Oxnard's program.</TE>
<TE>   Today, she will drive to the place where Nichole's remains were
found and talk to her. She will place flowers, balloons and a card at
the roadside.</TE>
<TE>   And she will wish her daughter a happy birthday.</TE>

<HD>Bus Ride on the Information Superhighway</HD>
<DH>San Diego: UC staff and students on campus shuttle stay
connected while they try out new technology allowing faster mobile
Internet access.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANICA BUTLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Staff and students at UC San Diego don't have to wait until they get
home to check their e-mail or get the latest news updates.</LD>
<LD>   The "CyberShuttle" takes commuters from campus to a popular
commuter rail station--all the while offering high-speed, wireless
Internet access.</LD>
<LD>   The shuttle bus is a result of a partnership between UC San Diego
and wireless technology firm Qualcomm Inc. Together they have
developed a faster mobile wireless service that allows people to use
their laptops, cell phones or hand-held computers to log on to the
Internet during what would otherwise be down time.</LD>
<TE>   "People can connect from the bus to the rest of the world," said
Elazar Harel, UC San Diego assistant vice chancellor for
administrative computing and telecommunications. "It's a very
exciting thing for us."</TE>
<TE>   Roberto Padovani, chief technology officer at Qualcomm, describes
the mobile access as a marriage of two technologies. The bus is
equipped with two boxes. One connects to the campus wireless network
while the other, called an HDR modem, uses cell phone towers to
provide continuous connectivity to the Internet.</TE>
<TE>   Both devices are powered by the vehicle's battery. The only
requirement for users is that they have a wireless network card. The
cards cost about $100, but many people on campus already use them to
connect to UC San Diego's network, Harel said.</TE>
<TE>   Mobile Internet access is not new, at least for those with
text-message pagers and cell phones. The difference on the UC San
Diego bus is in the speed and range of the technology, Padovani said.</TE>
<TE>   Current technology moves information at about 20 kilobits per
second, while the new technology's peak rate is more than 200
kilobits per second.</TE>
<TE>   It's faster than a cable modem, Harel says, and would have the
same feel as connecting a stationary computer via a digital
subscriber line, or DSL.</TE>
<TE>   "The joke that we tell is that the bus is moving at 55 mph on the
freeway but at 2 million bits per second on the information
superhighway," Harel said.</TE>
<TE>   The technology enables 50 to 100 commuters to be online at once,
and the range is a radius of about 10 miles.</TE>
<TE>   So far, the technology has been installed on a single shuttle,
which runs around campus and to the Sorrento Valley train station,
about 10 miles away.</TE>
<TE>   Several commuters found out about the service by accident, before
it was announced early last week.</TE>
<TE>   "People were on the bus, turned on their laptop and saw that they
had [Internet] access," Harel said. "They were very happy."</TE>
<TE>   Early feedback has been so positive, says Ramesh Rao, director of
the San Diego division of Cal-IT2, a partnership between UC San
Diego, UC Irvine and the private sector, that the school hopes to
outfit every campus shuttle.</TE>
<TE>   The San Diego campus may even expand use of the technology in the
fall by handing out the lunchbox-size wireless modems to a few
incoming freshmen. Those students, and anyone nearby, would then be
able to make speedy connections to the Internet from their dorm
rooms, the quad or the cafeteria.</TE>
<TE>   Rao already has his own wireless modem, which he says he usually
keeps at home but would gladly tote around.</TE>
<TE>   "I can throw it in my car," Rao said. "Sometimes you go on long
drives--I would love to stay connected."</TE>
<TE>   Giving the boxes to students, who would pay nothing for the
service, will give researchers new insight into possible uses.</TE>
<TE>   Qualcomm has licensed the high-speed technology to providers such
as Verizon, which is conducting a trial of the technology in
Washington, D.C. The service also will be tested in the city of San
Diego this June.</TE>
<TE>   To prepare for the trials, cellular towers will be outfitted with
technology equivalent to Rao's black box.</TE>
<TE>   Users would need only to install a special network card on their
laptops, said Daniel Jaurigue, Southern California executive director
of network for Verizon.</TE>
<TE>   He describes the cards as the size of a pen cap. The technology
should be available commercially in about a year, Jaurigue said.</TE>

<LD>Lots of scary news out there, but none worse than this: a new type of
Jerusalem cricket has hit town.</LD>
<LD>   It doesn't have a formal name yet, and scientists are whooping it
up because they've found the first one in the Santa Ana Mountains
along the eastern edge of Orange County. What scientists were doing
up there looking for crickets is beyond me.</LD>
<LD>   I go way back with crickets, having been frightened of them as a
boy of the plains, where they serenade people on hot summer nights.
Problem was, same song every single night and, after a while, it just
gave you the creeps. They have a sick habit of making noise until you
get close to them, then they clam up, then you walk away and they
start up again.</LD>
<TE>   A few years ago, I was surprised to hear crickets in our office
here in Costa Mesa. In all honesty, I thought we were a classier
operation than that. Somebody must have sent a memo to management,
because the crickets seem to have fled the scene.</TE>
<TE>   Now, the news arrives that this new Jerusalem cricket is in the
vicinity.</TE>
<TE>   Here's what the happy scientist who discovered the cricket said:
"It makes you wonder how many species there are in California that
have gone undiscovered."</TE>
<TE>   Always eager to get to know new neighbors, I sped to the Internet
to learn about the Jerusalem cricket. Here's what the University of
Nevada Cooperative Extension and the state Division of Agriculture
had to say about it:</TE>
<TE>   "People are frightened at first when they run across this
bizarre-looking creature. They wonder if it is real, and then if it
is a quirk of nature." With all due respect, is this really the kind
of new resident we need?</TE>
<TE>   The scientists say the bug can reach 2 inches in length (some
reports have it as big as 3 inches!) and describe it as having
"unusual features, especially the disproportionally large, bald,
shiny, 'humanoid' head....Two large, beady eyes are widely set just
below long, slender antennae."</TE>
<TE>   When we see things like that in my neighborhood, we run them out
of town.</TE>
<TE>   Needless to say, that isn't advised here. We're supposed to
welcome it as a vital cog in the ecosystem, even though the bug shows
such little respect for its species that the female may eat the male
after mating.</TE>
<TE>   The cricket serves as food for our old friends the owl, coyote and
fox. And as another Web site points out, "the horsehair worm can
inhabit the Jerusalem cricket's gut and feed."</TE>
<TE>   If that doesn't make you want to run out and save a few Jerusalem
crickets, nothing will.</TE>
<TE>   It's not fashionable to speak ill of our fellow eco-travelers,
because we're all God's creatures and inhabit this planet and must
get along with each other. Or something like that. Nor is it my
intention to offend any Jerusalem crickets or their advocates, nor to
reduce the number of cricket abdomens that horsehair worms can
inhabit. Everybody needs a place to go.</TE>
<TE>   It's just that, alas, I don't share the excitement of this
discovery. And when a scientist says that finding a Jerusalem cricket
only makes him wonder how many other species there are out there, I'm
forced to respond, "I hope not many."</TE>
<TE>   If that makes me a bit of an old poop, so be it.</TE>
<TE>   I admit that it's a poopiness born of fear and ignorance. I don't
like crawling things with regular heads, much less outsized ones that
can bite.</TE>
<TE>   Scientists say the cricket lives mostly in the soil and rarely
comes out in daylight.</TE>
<TE>   From what I've read, then, the chances of me and a Jerusalem
cricket ever meeting are slim. "People, often in fear, want to kill
them immediately," say the Nevada bug people. "Resist the temptation
in this case. They are not harmful to humans."</TE>
<TE>   Sorry, I've given bugs too many chances in my lifetime, only to be
terrorized by them later.</TE>
<TE>   And when it comes to large, shiny, humanoid-headed, beady-eyed
crickets with a belly full of horsehair worms, I'm not making any
promises.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A suspected carjacker was shot and wounded by police late Saturday
after he opened fire on heavily armed officers trying to flush him
from his mother's Santa Ana home, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   After 11 hours of trying to coax Manuel Arenas into surrendering,
police said they decided about 8:30 p.m. to fire tear gas into the
home to force him out.</LD>
<LD>   Minutes later, Arenas opened fire at Special Weapons and Tactics
team officers surrounding the home, said Santa Ana Police Sgt.
Baltazar De La Riva. The officers shot back, striking Arenas at least
once in the upper torso, he said.</LD>
<TE>   De La Riva said Arenas was taken to UCI Medical Center in Orange,
where officials said he was in critical condition. No officers were
injured.</TE>
<TE>   Police were summoned to the home early Saturday by Arenas' mother,
De La Riva said. The woman told police that her son, a parolee, had
arrived in a 2000 Toyota Camry she had never seen before. Police
checked the license plate and discovered it had been taken at
gunpoint a few days earlier in the city.</TE>
<TE>   About 9:30 a.m., officers arrived at the home in the 1600 block of
South Townsend Street, and saw the car in the driveway. A group of
men were near the vehicle, but fled into the home's garage as police
approached, De La Riva said.</TE>
<TE>   Police evacuated neighboring homes and after a short time
persuaded all of the home's occupants, except Arenas and his
9-year-old nephew, to leave. The sergeant said Arenas repeatedly
refused to let the boy leave the house, but relented at 6:15 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   Officers continued to urge Arenas to leave the home, calling him
on the telephone and using a bullhorn, but he refused to surrender,
De La Riva said.</TE>

<LD>One month after he lost the contest for the 2nd District seat on the
Los Angeles City Council, Assemblyman Tony Cardenas (D-Panorama City)
said Friday that he has filed papers to raise money to run in the 6th
District next year.</LD>
<LD>   Under a redistricting plan recommended to the council by a
citizens panel, the 6th District would be moved from the Westside to
the east San Fernando Valley. The proposed boundaries encompass the
neighborhood where Cardenas lives.</LD>
<LD>   Cardenas said his Assembly district includes 60% of the proposed
new 6th District. "I feel real confident that with my 51/2 years of
experience serving this area I have a lot to offer," he said.</LD>
<TE>   Two others--Michael Bonin and Sheila Bernard--earlier filed papers
for the 6th District, but did so before the new boundaries involving
the Valley inclusion were proposed.</TE>

mother's abandoned sport utility vehicle seven miles from where it
was carjacked the day before, but police said they still did not have
any suspects.</LD>
<LD>   Komal Surani was found inside the vehicle about 10:30 p.m. Friday
near Raymer Street and Bellaire Avenue in North Hollywood, said Lt.
Loren Farell of the Los Angeles Police Department's Devonshire
Division.</LD>
<LD>   The youngster had been missing since 3:30 p.m. Friday when someone
attacked the girl's mother, Muniran Surani, and took the black Lexus
from a Northridge Costco parking lot, police said.</LD>
<TE>   Surani had just placed her daughter in a car seat when she was
attacked.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators searched the vehicles for clues but have no strong
leads, police said.</TE>

<LD>Blanca Alarcon slid open the door of the Child Care Resource Center
van, which was parked in front of a pretty white house in Reseda with
purple pansies in the window boxes. "Wow," said 3-year-old Nicole
Christian, jumping up and down as she peered into the van. "You've
got lots of stuff."</LD>
<LD>   Packed with play equipment, toys, art supplies, books and
literature on child development, the van is in the field four days a
week, visiting caregivers like Mechelle Wiesenthal in their homes.</LD>
<LD>   Wiesenthal, 29, is a former preschool teacher who now tends six
youngsters, including her own 2-year-old son, Jacob.</LD>
<TE>   She has taken two of the older children--Nicole and fellow
3-year-old Nautica Savage--out to the van to pick new playthings.
Meanwhile, the van's other staffer, Cyndi Trujillo, plays with
Wiesenthal's four other charges in the backyard.</TE>
<TE>   "It's great to see the children's faces when the van pulls up,"
said Lorraine Schrag, executive director of the Van Nuys-based center
that provides child-care support services throughout the San
Fernando, Santa Clarita and Antelope valleys. "They know it's
bringing them special things."</TE>
<TE>   Those may include oversized blocks or a table for water play that
is beyond the budget of the person--usually a woman--who cares for
the children. The children get to keep the playthings until the van
makes its next visit, weeks later.</TE>
<TE>   Launched in 1993 with a grant from the American Business
Collaborative, the program now has four vans. A nonprofit agency,
whose budget comes from the California Department of Education and
other public and private sources, the center serves some 3,500
child-care providers who care for about 12,000 children in the
three-valley area, Schrag said.</TE>
<TE>   The vans currently visit about 70 family child-care providers who
have signed up for the free service.</TE>
<TE>   "Buttons!" cried little Nicole, spotting a clear plastic box
filled with buttons in the back of the van. Next, she exclaims over a
box of large wooden blocks.</TE>
<TE>   Ofelia Lozano, who runs Granny's Day Care in her Reseda home, is
another van client. She said her 13 preschoolers are thrilled to see
blocks and other classics in the back of the toy box on wheels.</TE>
<TE>   "In the beginning, I used to buy fancy toys with batteries and
things, and they played with them for one day," she said, with a
chuckle. When the van made a recent visit, several tiny girls grabbed
a box of tulle scarves, including an especially coveted hot-pink one,
and began dancing with them.</TE>
<TE>   But the children aren't the only ones who look forward to the
van's arrival. Their care-givers know that there are good things
inside for them as well, including the expertise of the van staff.</TE>
<TE>   "It's really an opportunity for the child-care provider to have a
consultation with a child-care professional," Schrag explained. "When
they make an appointment, the child-care provider may say, 'I'm
having a terrible problem with biting.'"</TE>
<TE>   Wiesenthal said the center's child-development specialists helped
her with just that problem on an earlier visit. Alerted to her
concern, the van staff arrived with literature on biting that pointed
out that it is common among toddlers. Wiesenthal was grateful to have
it to reassure concerned parents.</TE>
<TE>   "It's stressful for the parents of both the biters and the bitees,
and it was very helpful to have the handouts to give them,"
Wiesenthal said.</TE>
<TE>   The staff members also sat down with her to discuss strategies for
preventing future incidents. They recommended "shadowing" the biters,
keeping closer than usual watch on them and intervening before teeth
were sunk. It worked, Wiesenthal said.</TE>
<TE>   "There's nothing better than having a resource like that," said
Barbara Hill, director of child and family studies at Cal State
Northridge. "When you're a family child-care provider, you're very
isolated. You're in this little world, in this little house, with
these children."</TE>
<TE>   The opportunity to ask questions and swap ideas is invaluable,
Hill said. But, she cautioned, frequency is a major issue: "If it's
once every six months, or once a year, what's the point?"</TE>
<TE>   The Child Care Resource Center vans will start visiting
care-givers every eight weeks in the near future, up from every three
months.</TE>
<TE>   "Providers need to have more assistance in the home, in an
environment that's comfortable for them," Trujillo said of the van
program, which was the first in the Los Angeles area. Alarcon also
believes it's important to go to the provider, not just bring the
provider in for the occasional workshop or seminar.</TE>
<TE>   One of the center's vans will be open to the public April 14 at
CCRC's WordPlay, a free festival celebrating early literacy on the
Valley College campus in Valley Glen.</TE>
<TE>   For information, call (818) 773-3276.</TE>
<TE>   The staff thinks the van program benefits everybody with an
interest in seeing children well cared for. "I believe it promotes
quality child care, and it also acknowledges family child-care
providers as professionals," Alarcon said. "And it empowers children
to make choices."</TE>
<TE>   And the visits by the van also allow providers like Wiesenthal to
talk to other grown-ups from time to time.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm shut in here a little," said Wiesenthal, as she rejoined the
six small dervishes in her backyard. "It's really wonderful to have
adults around who understand the profession."</TE>

<HD>New City Requires Leap of Faith, League Says</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ZANTO PEABODY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a report released Saturday, the California League of Women Voters
concluded that a Valley secession election would be decided on faith
in "a rather vague notion."</LD>
<LD>   The league's local chapter has been interviewing heads of city
departments, the secession group Valley VOTE and the Local Agency
Formation Commission since October 2000. So far, it has determined
that information coming from pro-secession and anti-secession camps
is too different and too complex for voters to make a choice based on
facts alone.</LD>
<LD>   "Our position and voters' decisions will not be based on the
specifics of the LAFCO report [that concluded Valley secession is
viable], because there are too many ambiguities," said Xandra Kayden,
chairwoman of the league's secession committee. "Some will say the
devil we know--the city as it is right now--is better than the devil
we don't.</LD>
<TE>   "Others will decide they can live with a higher degree of
ambiguity." Some of the questions remaining are: Would residents of
the proposed city be guaranteed the same utility rates they now pay
the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power? Would the new city
contract services such as fire and police from Los Angeles or from
the county? Would the new city hire existing Los Angeles employees?</TE>
<TE>   Hermalee Schmidt, former chairwoman of the league's secession
committee, said: "We're buying a pig in a poke.</TE>
<TE>   "No one's statistics agree, and the terms are still being
negotiated," she said. "Some of them will still be worked out after
the election, and this is the most important issue in recent times
for this area."</TE>
<TE>   Schmidt said the league will try to take a position before
November, when secession proposals for the Valley, the harbor area
and Hollywood could go to a citywide vote. LAFCO is to decide that
matter next month.</TE>
<TE>   The league chapter has 600 active members, Kayden said. But its
influence goes beyond its membership, particularly through its Web
site, www.smartvoter.org, which is widely believed to be one of the
most comprehensive unofficial voter guides.</TE>
<TE>   "When the league takes a position, it's like the Good Housekeeping
seal [of approval], because people know we don't have a vested
interest and that we have looked at [the issue] in depth."</TE>

<HD>Proposal Extends Pay for County Reservists</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CATHERINE SAILLANT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ventura County government employees called into military service
after last year's terrorist attacks would get an extra two months of
supplemental pay and benefits under a plan before the Board of
Supervisors.</LD>
<LD>   Reservists and their families already receive full medical
benefits and six months of supplemental pay under policies approved
by supervisors last year. The latest proposal would cap the
pay-and-benefit extensions at eight months.</LD>
<LD>   The county has paid out $132,000 so far to ensure that 16
employees called up for reserve duty do not suffer cuts in pay while
fulfilling their responsibility. Adding two more months would cost
about $62,000, county officials said.</LD>
<TE>   If the extension is approved, the reservists would receive the
supplements through July 6, Human Resources Director Barbara Journet
said.</TE>
<TE>   "We figured it would be a good time to sunset the program at the
end of the fiscal year," Journet said. "If the board wants to
consider extending it again, they could do that during the budget
process [in June]."</TE>
<TE>   Supervisors agreed to provide supplemental salary after reservists
and their families said they would not be able to pay their bills on
military compensation.</TE>
<TE>   The board had precedent for its action. Supervisors in 1991
approved a five-month extension of medical benefits for employees
called to active duty in the Persian Gulf. But that board rejected a
proposal that the county supplement military pay.</TE>
<TE>   Cities across Ventura County approved similar benefits in response
to the Sept. 11 attacks on the World Trade Center and Pentagon. In
recent weeks, some cities have also approved extensions.</TE>
<TE>   Half of the county government employees who have been called up
work in the Sheriff's Department. Glen Kitzmann, head of the deputies
union, said the proposed extension would be good news for reservists
and their spouses.</TE>

<HD>Hernandez, Yankees Clamp Down Again</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>No wonder the rest of baseball is scared of the New York Yankees:
Their starting pitchers have stopped giving up runs.</LD>
<LD>   Orlando Hernandez, not even guaranteed a starting spot at the
start of spring training, became the latest pitcher to make shutout
ball seem routine. El Duque gave up one hit in eight innings, Ron
Coomer homered in his first at-bat with the Yankees and New York
defeated Wilson Alvarez in his return from a two-season layoff,
topping the Tampa Bay Devil Rays, 3-0, Saturday in New York.</LD>
<LD>   "He was the El Duque of old," Jason Giambi said.</LD>
<TE>   Since Roger Clemens was hit hard after taking a shot off his
pitching hand on opening day, starters David Wells, Mike Mussina,
Andy Pettitte and Hernandez have combined for 281/3 shutout innings.
The four-time defending American League champions have won four in a
row since losing their opener, taking sole possession of first in the
AL East. They have three shutouts--one-third of their 2001 total.</TE>
<TE>   "We feel pitching is our strong point, but what we've done we
can't expect to happen all the time," said Yankee Manager Joe Torre,
who got his 1,480th career victory and tied Earl Weaver for 18th on
the career list.</TE>
<TE>   Giambi went 0 for 1 with two walks and a hit by pitch, dropping to
two for 17 (.118) with no RBIs, but he did stir fans with a foul
upper-deck drive in the first. Unlike Friday, the fans at Yankee
Stadium didn't boo. Instead, they chanted "Let's go, Jason!" when he
batted against Doug Creek, who hit him near the right shoulder blade
in the seventh.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Boston 4, Baltimore 2--Nomar Garciaparra hit a three-run homer in
the eighth inning at Baltimore to ruin a fine pitching performance by
Scott Erickson and lift the Red Sox.</TE>
<TE>   Erickson (1-1) blanked the Red Sox through six innings and gave up
one run through seven. But with score tied at 1-1, the right-hander
ran into trouble in the eighth after retiring the first two batters.</TE>
<TE>   Rickey Henderson and Johnny Damon singled. Garciaparra followed
with a liner to left that was gloved by a leaping Melvin Mora, but
the ball fell into the seats after his mitt hit the top of the
seven-foot wall.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Oakland 8, Seattle 3--Mark Mulder pitched into the seventh inning
for his second victory, and Frank Menechino's tiebreaking homer
lifted the Athletics to the victory at Seattle.</TE>
<TE>   Miguel Tejada and Jeremy Giambi also homered off Freddy Garcia as
Oakland handed the Mariners their first loss since opening day.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Chicago 14, Kansas City 0--Magglio Ordonez had three hits, a
homer, four runs and three RBIs and Paul Konerko also drove in three
runs at Kansas City, Mo., as the White Sox posted their biggest
shutout victory in 15 seasons.</TE>
<TE>   Mark Buehrle (2-0) pitched six shutout innings and raised his
career record to 5-0 against Kansas City as the White Sox had their
most lopsided shutout since a 17-0 victory at Cleveland in 1987.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Cleveland 5, Detroit 3--Ellis Burks drove in two runs, Brady
Anderson homered and Bartolo Colon was solid as the Indians won at
Detroit.</TE>
<TE>   The Tigers (0-5) are baseball's lone winless team and are off to
their worst start since losing the first six games in 1992.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Minnesota 7, Toronto 5--Jacque Jones hit his third home run and
Doug Mientkiewicz and Jay Canizaro each had two RBIs as the Twins won
at Toronto.</TE>
<TE>   LaTroy Hawkins pitched 12/3 scoreless innings for the victory.
Eddie Guardado pitched the ninth for his fourth save in as many
chances.</TE>

<HD>Angels Go to the Wall, Beat the Rangers, 6-3</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ARLINGTON, Texas</DL>
<LD>If you would have looked at Alex Rodriguez, you would have sworn he
had just thrust a dagger into the hearts of the Angels. Rodriguez hit
the ball toward the left-field bleachers, pumped a fist toward the
sky, and started to celebrate his game-winning, game-ending grand
slam.</LD>
<LD>   But the ball never left the ballpark. Rodriguez slapped his hand
against his helmet in frustration, the teammates that had sprinted
onto the field to congratulate him shuffled back into the dugout, and
the Angels collectively exhaled. On a dark and stormy night, the cold
and damp air reduced what appeared to be a home run to a harmless fly
ball to the warning track.</LD>
<LD>   On the second day of life without All-Star closer Troy Percival,
the Angels flirted with disaster. Ben Weber and Al Levine combined to
walk four batters in the ninth inning before the Angels escaped with
a 6-3 victory that reminded them how precious Percival can be, with
his 100-mph fastball and nearly automatic saves.</LD>
<TE>   "It's more exciting when he does it," Levine said. "I almost made
everyone die in the dugout."</TE>
<TE>   The drama of the last inning obscured the heroics of Troy Glaus,
who hit two home runs and nearly hit a third, and Ramon Ortiz, who
held the powerful Rangers to two runs over seven innings in his first
start of the season.</TE>
<TE>   Glaus' second home run, good for three runs, gave the Angels an
apparently comfortable 6-2 lead in the top of the ninth. But Weber,
who retired three consecutive batters in the eighth inning, then
walked the bases loaded with two out in the ninth.</TE>
<TE>   Levine relieved Weber and promptly walked Herbert Perry on four
pitches, none of them close, to force home a run.</TE>
<TE>   Up stepped Rodriguez, the man with the Texas-sized contract, who
already had homered in the first inning. Ball one, strike one, two
foul balls, another ball--and then a hanging slider, and a
mighty-sounding fly ball.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought it was gone," shortstop David Eckstein said.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought he hit it out, no question," catcher Jorge Fabregas
said.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought the game was over," Levine said.</TE>
<TE>   Well, it was.</TE>
<TE>   "I mean, I thought it was a home run," he said. "I turned around
to look at [left fielder] Garret [Anderson] and I was like, what is
he doing? That ball is way out of here."</TE>
<TE>   Anderson settled onto the track and waited calmly for the catch,
and the final out.</TE>
<TE>   "The ball's not flying in this park right now," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Said Glaus: "If it's not cold and windy, maybe it goes. When it's
95 degrees here, the ball carries a little bit better than when it's
50, or 48, or whatever it was by the time it was over."</TE>
<TE>   It was 52 at game time, and the rain ranged from drizzling to
pouring for most of the evening. The Angels were mostly stumped by
Hideki Irabu, starting in place of the injured Chan Ho Park on Chan
Ho Park poster night at the Ballpark in Arlington.</TE>
<TE>   But Glaus hit a home run off Irabu in the fourth inning and
Orlando Palmeiro tagged reliever Steve Woodard for a two-run single
in the sixth.</TE>
<TE>   Glaus, rapidly replacing Tim Salmon as the Rangers' nemesis, has
hit three home runs in the first two games of this series and 11 in
the Angels' past 21 against Texas.</TE>
<TE>   Glaus hit 47 home runs to win the American League home run
championship two years ago. He hit 41 last year and won the preseason
home run derby this year, so a 50-homer season is a reasonable
proposition.</TE>
<TE>   "It's never that easy," Salmon said. "Sometimes I'm amazed that
the guy hits 50 home runs and they keep throwing him pitches."</TE>
<TE>   Said Glaus: "They threw balls over the plate today, and I took
advantage of them. When you're going bad, you don't take advantage of
them."</TE>
<TE>   Glaus has all three of the Angels' home runs this season. Of their
20 runs batted in, he has nine.</TE>
<TE>   Who can cool him down? Perhaps only Bob Watson, baseball's dean of
discipline, who suspended Glaus for two games for charging the mound
after being hit in a spring training game. Glaus will serve the
suspension today and Monday.</TE>
<TE>   "He could very easily have hit three home runs [Saturday]," Texas
Manager Jerry Narron said. "I'm just glad he can't play [today]."</TE>

<HD>Gil Criticizes Greer for Collision</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bill Shaikin</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>ARLINGTON, Texas</DL>
<LD>Infielder Benji Gil, put on the disabled list Friday after severely
spraining his left ankle in a collision with Rusty Greer of the Texas
Rangers, said Saturday the injury could have been avoided had Greer
not made a questionable decision to slide into first base.</LD>
<LD>   Gil, playing first base Friday, charged in front of the bag to
field a ground ball hit by Greer. Rather than retreat to tag the bag,
Gil opted to tag Greer as he passed. Greer then tried--and failed--to
slide beneath Gil's tag and into the base. As Gil applied the tag,
the two tumbled together, with Greer accidentally spiking Gil on the
ankle.</LD>
<LD>   Gil, who left the clubhouse on crutches Saturday, said he believed
Greer was too far from first base to slide into it, suggesting the
injury occurred needlessly.</LD>
<TE>   "I was upset," Gil said. "There was nowhere to go. There was no
way he would have been safe. I know he was trying to avoid the tag,
but I don't think there was any way he could have been safe."</TE>
<TE>   Greer said he believed he would have slid safely into first had he
avoided the tag. He also said didn't intend to injure Gil and simply
reacted out of instinct.</TE>
<TE>   "I wouldn't try to run over Benji. He's quite a bit bigger than
me," Greer said. "I'm just trying to make it to first base. That's
all."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   While the Angels publicly said Wednesday that closer Troy Percival
would miss this weekend's series to rest a strained rib cage, he said
they told him he would not be allowed to throw in the bullpen for
nine days and might not get into a game for 11 days. Since he can
come off the disabled list after 15 days, Percival told Manager Mike
Scioscia that the Angels might as well put him on the disabled list
and add another pitcher to the bullpen in the meantime. The Angels
did just that Friday.</TE>
<TE>   "I tried taking six days off in spring training, and it didn't
help," Percival said.</TE>
<TE>   Al Levine, who saved Friday's victory, will be the primary closer
in Percival's absence. The Angels promoted Brendan Donnelly from
triple-A to fill the bullpen vacancy.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Donnelly was all smiles Saturday, promoted to a major league
roster for the first time at age 30, after a 10-year minor league
career that included two stints in independent leagues and releases
from the White Sox, Cubs, Reds, Devil Rays, Pirates and Blue Jays.</TE>
<TE>   Along the way, Donnelly never gave up on his goal of getting to
the majors and never tired of explaining why he would not walk away
from baseball.</TE>
<TE>   "This is what I do," he said. "This is what I know the best."</TE>

<HD>War Emblem's Victory in Illinois Is Sterling</HD>
<DH>Horse racing: Jockey guides 3-year-old to fourth win in
seven starts in impressive fashion over favored Repent.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The $500,000 Illinois Derby was easy pickings for a certain
3-year-old Saturday at Sportsman's Park.</LD>
<LD>   Only it wasn't the colt everybody thought would win. War Emblem,
the 6-1 third choice, controlled things from the outset and dominated
1-2 favorite Repent and seven others.</LD>
<LD>   Winning for the fourth time in seven starts for owner Russell L.
Reineman and trainer Frank Springer, the son of Our Emblem completed
the 11/8 miles in 1:494/5 and won by 61/4 lengths.</LD>
<TE>   He was ridden by Larry Sterling Jr., who got the mount after
Alfredo Juarez Jr., who had been aboard for a 103/4-length victory at
the track on March 17, opted to ride California shipper Fonz's, who
was third, beaten by nearly 11 lengths.</TE>
<TE>   Seeking his fourth consecutive victory for trainer Ken McPeek,
Repent was hampered by the slow fractions (48 for the half-mile and
1:13 for six furlongs), but he failed to finish with a flourish under
jockey Jerry Bailey. In fact, he lost ground to the winner in the
final eighth of a mile.</TE>
<TE>   "We may be better off going into [the Kentucky Derby] losing today
rather than winning," McPeek said. "Nothing is a given in this game.
When a horse sets his own fractions like that, they are always
dangerous."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   While McPeek failed in Illinois, he got the money with favored
Take Charge Lady in the $500,000 Ashland Stakes at Keeneland.</TE>
<TE>   Ridden by Tony D'Amico, the 3-year-old Dehere filly earned her
first Grade I victory and sixth in eight starts. The 3-5 favorite won
by 41/4 lengths over 13-1 longshot Take The Cake in 1:431/5 for the
11/16 miles. Belterra, the 5-2 second choice, was third.</TE>
<TE>   "This filly has really developed," D'Amico said. "She's so much
bigger and stronger now. She's incredible."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Local jockeys Eddie Delahoussaye and Mike Smith enjoyed their
visit to Arkansas.</TE>
<TE>   Delahoussaye and 2-1 second choice Kudos rallied from last to win
the $500,000 Oaklawn Handicap going away, and three races later,
Smith and favored Azeri overcame a poor start to win the $500,000
Apple Blossom Handicap at Oaklawn Park.</TE>
<TE>   Owned by Mr. and Mrs. Jerry Moss and trained by Richard Mandella,
the 5-year-old Kudos trailed by 16 lengths after a half-mile, but
swung wide and wound up winning by almost five lengths in 1:481/5 for
the 11/8 miles.</TE>
<TE>   Azeri, the even-money choice in a field reduced to five after the
scratch of Fleet Renee, spotted her rivals a head start by breaking
in the air. But Smith kept her in the clear and she caught pacesetter
Miss Linda early in the lane and went on to win by 13/4 lengths in
1:423/5 for the 11/16 miles.</TE>
<TE>   Owned by the Allen Paulson Living Trust and trained by Laura De
Seroux, the 4-year-old daughter of Jade Hunter won for the fifth time
in six starts. Affluent, ridden by Delahoussaye, was second and Miss
Linda was third.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Santa Anita Derby wasn't the only stakes victory for owners
John Toffan and Trudy McCaffery, trainer Paco Gonzalez and jockey
Chris McCarron.</TE>
<TE>   Bosque Redondo, the 6-5 favorite, was pressured throughout, but
was able to hold off 7-1 longshot Mysterious Cat to win the $150,000
San Bernardino Handicap by a head.</TE>
<TE>   A 5-year-old son of Mane Minister, Bosque Redondo earned his sixth
victory in 13 lifetime starts and completed the 11/8 miles in 1:49, a
second faster than Came Home ran the distance in winning the Derby.</TE>
<TE>   "He loves Santa Anita," said McCarron, who added a record-setting
third graded stakes victory when 12-1 longshot Seinne ran down
favored Irish Prize in the final yards to win the $150,000 Arcadia
Handicap later in the card. "He gives me a tremendous amount of
confidence. When it comes down to a dogfight, he is there every
time."</TE>
<TE>   McCarron became the first jockey to ride three graded stakes
winners on the same day in the history of the track on what was the
11th anniversary of McCarron's last three stakes victory day at Santa
Anita.</TE>
<TE>   Besides winning the 1991 Santa Anita Derby with Dinard, the hall
of famer also won the Jan Jessie Stakes with Suziqcute and the Santa
Gertrudes Handicap with Jungle Pioneer. The Jan Jessie and Santa
Gertrudes were ungraded races.</TE>

<LD>As Barry Bonds was taking a hammer to the major league record book
last season, teammate Rich Aurilia was doing a number on the National
League book.</LD>
<LD>   The San Francisco Giants' shortstop, profiting from batting
second, ahead of Bonds, in Dusty Baker's lineup while also
contributing to Bonds' success, actually led all major league
shortstops with a .324 average and 206 hits. He also slugged 37
homers to become the first NL shortstop with three consecutive
seasons of 20 or more home runs since Ernie Banks, who did it in
1959-61 and is the only NL shortstop to have hit more than 37 in a
season.</LD>
<LD>   Because Aurilia finished 11th in most-valuable-player voting and
was the NL's All-Star starter at his position, it wouldn't be
accurate to say that his career-best season was totally overshadowed
by Bonds. Seldom, however, did he have the spotlight to himself--just
as his catalytic role in the Giants' season-opening sweep of the
Dodgers (he had five hits in three games) tended to be lost amid
Bonds' renewed fireworks.</LD>
<TE>   In addition, Aurilia's emergence as one of baseball's most
productive shortstops--he is the first to lead NL shortstops in both
home runs and runs batted in (97 last year) for three straight
seasons since Dave Concepcion in 1978-81--has not been enough to get
him classified with the Big Three of Alex Rodriguez, Derek Jeter and
Nomar Garciaparra.</TE>
<TE>   Should he be?</TE>
<TE>   "A few years ago, and certainly before last season, I would have
said that those guys are in a class of their own and deserve to be,
but I'd like to think now that maybe I do belong in that class,"
Aurilia said last week in Los Angeles. "It would be an honor to be
mentioned in the same sentence with those guys because I respect what
they've done, but hopefully I'm creating that same respect. I have a
lot of confidence after last year and feel I have a bunch of years
left to build on what I did."</TE>
<TE>   Last year was not really a breakthrough season because Aurilia had
been producing a series of breakthrough seasons, but he definitely
took it to a higher level when elevated in the batting order from
run-producing spots near the bottom to No. 2, ahead of Bonds.</TE>
<TE>   Aurilia initially opposed the switch, believing he would have to
sacrifice some of his RBI focus to take pitches and give up at-bats
to advance runners. Instead, his power flourished, but he bristles at
the theory that it was strictly because he was seeing more fastballs
from pitchers who didn't want to take a chance and walk a batter
ahead of Bonds.</TE>
<TE>   "Did I benefit, and do I benefit, from hitting in front of Barry?"
Aurilia said. "Of course. But it kind of gets blown out of
proportion. I mean, I probably see fastballs when I should see them,
on 2-and-0 and 3-and-1 counts when they'd rather pitch to me and hope
I get myself out than take a chance on walking me ahead of Barry. But
I also see curveballs and split-fingers and everything else. You've
still got to hit the ball no matter what they're throwing, and I
probably hit half of last year's home runs on breaking pitches.</TE>
<TE>   "I did surprise myself from a power standpoint, but I think that
came from maturity, understanding what I can and can't do, and being
able to take advantage of mistake pitches. To me, it would be nice,
since I'm always hearing how I've benefited from hitting in front of
Barry, if maybe it was suggested that Barry has benefited a little
from hitting behind me, getting the opportunity to drive in more
runs. I think it goes hand in hand."</TE>
<TE>   With Aurilia delivering 206 hits last year, and showing no letup
in the first week of the new season, pitchers consistently have to
work from a stretch position against Bonds and aren't apt to
automatically walk him with a runner already on base.</TE>
<TE>   There were several years when Aurilia--drafted by the Texas
Rangers out of St. John's and traded with infielder Desi Wilson to
the Giants for pitcher John Burkett in 1994--wondered if he would
ever get the chance to start regularly in the major leagues, let
alone develop into an All-Star.</TE>
<TE>   Now 30 and in the second year of a three-year, $14.750-million
contract, Aurilia had to be what Baker calls the "epitome of
patience" as the Giants brought in such experienced shortstops as
Shawon Dunston, Jose Vizcaino and Rey Sanchez.</TE>
<TE>   "There was a period of about three years when I was told I was
going to be the starting shortstop and it never happened," Aurilia
said. "It was frustrating because as a young player you always feel
you're ready to play at this level. I can honestly say now I probably
wasn't ready to play every day and succeed. The way it's turned out,
I wouldn't change a thing."</TE>
<TE>   Dunston, in particular, helped Aurilia develop, on and off the
field. At 6 feet 1 and 190 pounds, Aurilia doesn't have the long,
graceful lines of A-Rod. Nor does he have the speed, range and
howitzer arm of an impressive group of young NL shortstops:
Montreal's Orlando Cabrera, Atlanta's Rafael Furcal and
Philadelphia's Jimmy Rollins. In the lexicon of the game, the
Brooklyn-born Aurilia is a gamer who can stand the heat since he
spends much of the off-season in the kitchen, fueling an Italian
passion for cooking.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a self-made player who has always had the fire to excel,"
said Jim Fregosi, a former All-Star shortstop and San Francisco
executive who now scouts for Atlanta.</TE>
<TE>   "He might not be the fastest runner or have the greatest arm or
range, but he just might be the best shortstop in the league."</TE>
<TE>   There is no "might be" about his hand-in-hand effect on Bonds, and
Bonds' effect on him.</TE>
<TE>   If he has been overlooked at times, Aurilia smiled and said,
"Barry is arguably one of the top five players of all time, and to be
able to play with him and watch what he does is a great thing--not
only as a teammate but a fan of the game. If it takes a guy on my own
team to hit 73 home runs and overshadow me, that's fine. I mean, he
may hit 300 of them this year. He can have all the attention."</TE>

<LD>Major league security is tighter than ever. At Dodger Stadium, for
instance, reporters have to sign in when they enter the ballpark on
the top level and again when they enter the press box, go on the
field and enter either clubhouse both before and after games--when
the clock is ticking on deadlines.</LD>
<LD>   If tiresome, it's also true that you can never be too safe when
journalists are involved.</LD>
<LD>   However, even players are affected.</LD>
<TE>   A directive from the commissioner's office restricts access to
team facilities such as the clubhouse to players, union and baseball
officials, uniformed personnel, team trainers, doctors, media and
other essential team employees such as clubhouse attendants and
equipment managers.</TE>
<TE>   Two of baseball's top players, Jason Giambi and Barry Bonds, have
been directly affected. Each travels with a personal trainer--Bonds,
in fact, has two--and personal trainers do not have clubhouse access
under the directive.</TE>
<TE>   The Yankees have circumvented the directive by hiring Bob Alejo,
the former Oakland A's weight coach whom Giambi is paying $125,000 a
year to serve as fitness guru, as a batting practice pitcher and will
pay him on a per-diem basis.</TE>
<TE>   "Jason is committed to being the best he can possibly be in New
York, and he asked us to try to help him be the best he can be,"
Yankee General Manager Brian Cashman said. "It would be foolish of me
not to try and assist."</TE>
<TE>   Scott Boras, who represents Bonds and several other
players--including Alex Rodriguez and Gary Sheffield--who have
"invested in their careers" by hiring personal trainers, said
security is essential and that the clubhouse is not a place for "a
wide variety of friends, relatives and agents."</TE>
<TE>   However, Boras said, it shouldn't be necessary for clubs to
"conduct a charade" in which they give a phony title to a personal
trainer and pay him "a dollar a month" so he can have clubhouse
access.</TE>
<TE>   "Players are encouraged to maintain an optimum level of
conditioning and performance," Boras said. "To set up a system that
discourages that is not in the best interest of the game. Instead of
sending out an arbitrary directive without advance notice, there
should be a way to resolve both dynamics [of security and access for
personal trainers]. The Giants have assured us that they'll work with
Barry so that he can continue his program."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In and Out</TE>
<TE>   Jeff Kent returned to the San Francisco lineup Saturday, but it
could be construed as the beginning of the end for Kent with the
Giants.</TE>
<TE>   The National League's most valuable player in 2000 is eligible for
free agency in November and the Giants have little, if any, interest
in re-signing him.</TE>
<TE>   Sources say club officials are fed up with Kent's ongoing cover-up
as to how he broke his wrist March 1.</TE>
<TE>   In embarrassing himself and the club, Kent initially said he broke
it when he fell off his truck while washing it.</TE>
<TE>   The Giants are convinced he broke it when he fell off his
motorcycle while doing high-speed wheelies on a busy street in
Scottsdale, Ariz., an activity violating his contract.</TE>
<TE>   "If this was a court case, the Giants clearly have enough evidence
to indict," said a person familiar with the situation.</TE>
<TE>   General Manager Brian Sabean let his emotions show in Los Angeles
when Kent complained about opening the season on the disabled list.</TE>
<TE>   Sabean said he was "up to here" with Kent and added, "he should
have thought more about his actions that put him and the club in this
position. I didn't break his wrist. What I say is, 'Tough luck.'
Quote, unquote."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Desperation</TE>
<TE>   In his ongoing rehabilitation from a slight tear and fraying in
his rotator cuff, Pedro Martinez returns to the mound today after his
disappointing performance--nine hits, seven earned runs in three-plus
innings--in the Boston Red Sox opener.</TE>
<TE>   Martinez is so confused by the uncertainty he is experiencing that
he told Boston reporters, "You could even give me advice and I would
probably listen. I'm a rookie at this. I've never been hurt. Who
knows how long it's going to take me? All I can do is just go out
there and wonder."</TE>
<TE>   In reality, Martinez has been through the rehabilitation process
before, but that was when he was still in the Dodgers' minor league
system, and the surgery performed by Dr. Frank Jobe to repair a
separated shoulder involved his left or non-pitching shoulder.</TE>
<TE>   Jobe, however, conceded in a 1999 interview with The Times that
questions pertaining to Martinez's stature, stamina and shoulder
stability led him to point out those possible physical pitfalls--as
most doctors would--before Fred Claire and Tom Lasorda made the
now-infamous decision to trade Martinez to Montreal for</TE>
<TE>   Delino DeShields</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think I said, 'Get rid of him,'" Jobe said in the
interview. "I'd never say that, but the circumstances kind of spoke
for themselves. He had a delicate stature to start with, and there
were obviously questions about his stamina. It's a judgment call, but
you had to kind of wonder, 'Golly, is this kid going to break down?'"</TE>
<TE>   The breakdown came after two Cy Young awards and five-plus seasons
of never missing a start. As Jobe also said in that 1999 interview,
referring to Pedro and brother Ramon, "They may have [physical
drawbacks], but they're tough people."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Spokesman</TE>
<TE>   The players' union was undoubtedly delighted to see Forbes
magazine rip management's financial figures and portrait of doom and
gloom. If union executives bit their tongues, however, Minnesota Twin
infielder and player representative Denny Hocking may have spoken for
them.</TE>
<TE>   In voicing the union view, Hocking began taking shots at
Commissioner Bud Selig in the off-season, and after Selig criticized
the Forbes report, Hocking said, "Gee, should I believe a magazine
that spends 365 days a year researching finances, or someone who has
zero credibility?"</TE>

<KH>BOYS' BASKETBALL PLAYER OF THE YEAR</KH>
<HD>Adams Soared to New Level</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BEN BOLCH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Westchester High guard sprinted toward the basket on a
three-on-one fast break. An uncontested layup was his for the taking,
but instead he lobbed the ball to teammate Hassan Adams, who slammed
home a rim-rattling dunk.</LD>
<LD>   Coach Ed Azzam, watching from the sideline, immediately blew his
whistle to halt the practice.</LD>
<LD>   "That was not a smart play," Azzam barked.</LD>
<TE>   Countered the guard: "Coach, I know, but it's Hassan."</TE>
<TE>   He had a point. After all, it's easy to go for the flamboyant move
when there's a player the caliber of Adams in your midst.</TE>
<TE>   The Times' boys' basketball player of the year had a penchant for
the big finish, whether it was with a thunderous dunk late in the
Comets' City Section championship victory over Fairfax or two free
throws that secured a state Division I title against Oakland Tech.</TE>
<TE>   Adams wasn't one of the more prolific scorers in Southern
California--he averaged 18.3 points along with 5.4 rebounds and 3.1
assists--but that was primarily because he played on a virtual
all-star team, with four teammates averaging double figures in
scoring.</TE>
<TE>   What mattered was that the 6-foot-4 senior guard was at his best
when his team needed him most. Consider a sampling of Adams' big-game
performances:</TE>
<TE>   * In the Comets' first of four games with rival Fairfax, he scored
19 of his 26 points in the second half of a narrow victory.</TE>
<TE>   * Against national power Mouth of Wilson (Va.) Oak Hill Academy,
he made 12 of 16 shots and finished with a game-high 30 points.</TE>
<TE>   * In the state title game against Oakland Tech, he scored 24
points.</TE>
<TE>   "It wasn't about scoring with our team," Adams said. "It was about
winning. I did what I needed for us to win."</TE>
<TE>   Azzam said one of Adams' principal strengths was his
competitiveness. The fiery player would even get in Azzam's face in
practice if he felt the coach wasn't doing what he needed to get
everybody on the same page.</TE>
<TE>   "He's the kind of guy, if you're not ready to go out there and
give 100%, you just need to get out of the way ... even in practice,"
Azzam said. "If you're not going to fight for this, you're not going
to get it. That's his way of thinking."</TE>
<TE>   Even players from the teams that beat Westchester (32-2) were in
awe of Adams.</TE>
<TE>   "I respect his game, I respect him as a person, I respect
everything about him," Fairfax forward Evan Burns said. "I think when
we play against each other, our games both elevate."</TE>
<TE>   Adams and Burns will likely face off several more times in the
coming years, as Adams has signed with Arizona and Burns has
committed to UCLA. Adams said he picked Arizona in part because it
has been a pipeline to the NBA for guards such as Jason Terry, Miles
Simon and Mike Bibby.</TE>
<TE>   Adams' rise to stardom has been steep. He was considered a solid
but unspectacular player as a freshman at Wilmington Banning, a
sophomore at Los Angeles Verbum Dei and a junior at Westchester. Then
he broke through with a big showing last summer and continued his
rise to prominence during the season.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously, he's one of the best players to come through
Westchester with his athletic ability," Azzam said. "On a team with
less talent, he would have stood out even more."</TE>

<LD>It looked like checkmate for Tim Sweeney Jr. and Riverside King High.</LD>
<LD>   The Wolves had lost to Redondo Union in the Southern Section
Division II-A boys' basketball championship game on a last-second
three-pointer, an off-balance shot that Sweeney lamented "you
couldn't make one out of 10 times on a playground."</LD>
<LD>   With top-seeded Santa Ana Mater Dei looming in the Southern
California Regionals, King would go on, maybe win another game or
two, and call it a season.</LD>
<TE>   Hardly.</TE>
<TE>   The Wolves knocked off Mater Dei and went on to win the state
Division II championship, becoming the first team from Riverside
County to win a state boys' basketball title.</TE>
<TE>   The Times' boys' basketball coach of the year made his players
believe. That was a tall order for a team in only its second varsity
season.</TE>
<TE>   Yet, King played its best in its biggest games because its coach
put it in a position to win.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't expect this for four or five years, to be truly
competitive," Sweeney said. "It's really neat to see a true community
school with community players have the kids develop the way they have
and just show the character and really be able to adapt to the
system. It's a testament to the kids we have in the program."</TE>

<HD>Olowokandi Is Unapologetic</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Elliott Teaford</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Center Michael Olowokandi did not apologize Saturday for making the
comments about his contract situation that resulted in a $50,000 fine
Friday from General Manager Elgin Baylor. But he said his comments
were not directed at Baylor, but at owner Donald T. Sterling and
Executive Vice President Andy Roeser.</LD>
<LD>   Olowokandi also called the fine "excessive."</LD>
<LD>   "Maybe it's a gag order," he said.</LD>
<TE>   Olowokandi said he spoke out Wednesday to express the concerns of
his teammates, who have been reluctant to do so publicly.</TE>
<TE>   "What I said I don't think is false," he said Saturday. "It wasn't
a personal attack on [Baylor]. I was basically voicing the opinions
of my teammates. I'm trying to aid our team. It was said my comments
were detrimental to the team. Maybe they were detrimental to
management. I felt it was my place to say something."</TE>
<TE>   Among other things, Olowokandi said after the Clippers' loss to
the Utah Jazz on Wednesday: "We didn't play well together. Whenever
you have a group of guys that are very uncertain of their futures on
the team that will always happen. Whenever you have that situation,
you will never have a basketball team. Not this year, not next year,
not 10 years from now.</TE>
<TE>   "Things are very uncertain with the future of this team. It's
starting to affect the way we play the game."</TE>
<TE>   Olowokandi is eligible to become a restricted free agent this
summer and point guard Jeff McInnis is eligible to become an
unrestricted free agent. Several other players, including power
forward Elton Brand, are eligible for long-term contract extensions.</TE>
<TE>   Olowokandi's negotiations are viewed by many as a test case to see
how seriously the formerly woebegone franchise is committed to
continuing to build a winning team. He said Saturday he would like to
remain a Clipper.</TE>
<TE>   Said Coach Alvin Gentry of Olowokandi: "Michael is an integral
part of our future. Of course we want him here. I just know how we
all feel. There's never been a doubt that we want Michael here."</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, Gentry added, "Obviously, everybody felt it
[Olowokandi's comments] was out of line.... I agree with the fine."</TE>
<TE>   Olowokandi said he had not spoken with Baylor as of midday
Saturday. He did speak with his agent, Bill Duffy, however.</TE>
<TE>   "One thing my agent said was that maybe I worry too much, that
maybe I shouldn't worry about things that are out of my control," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Of making the comments, he added, "Apart from [eight-season
veteran Eric] Piatkowski, I've been on the team the longest. I've
seen players come and go. We've never really had a team that was
capable of making a run for the playoffs until now. We did play
selfishly and lackluster [against Utah]. We're not robots. We're not
machines. We do think for ourselves.</TE>
<TE>   "One of the things Alvin talked about before practice today was
that we've done a lot of good things this season and we can't let it
go to waste. But we came so close to the playoffs and it is really,
really frustrating."</TE>

<HD>Spain Hands It Over to U.S.</HD>
<DH>Tennis: Corretja's injury makes it easy for Martin, Blake,
whose doubles win gives Americans a 2-1 Davis Cup lead.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA DILLMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>HOUSTON</DL>
<LD>Of course Alex Corretja had a sore hand. Why wouldn't he?</LD>
<LD>   Nearly everyone connected with the Spanish Davis Cup team wanted
to high-five, low-five or simply grab Corretja's hand Friday after
his stunning five-set victory over Pete Sampras on grass at the
Westside Tennis Club.</LD>
<LD>   But, as it turned out, Corretja's highlight moment had a negative
impact a day later. When he dived for a volley on the first point in
the final game against Sampras, Corretja injured tendons in his right
hand and could not grip a racket</LD>
<TE>   So, instead of partnering with Juan Balcells in Saturday's doubles
match against Americans Todd Martin and James Blake, Corretja was on
the sideline, icing his hand and taping it. His withdrawal turned the
doubles into no contest, as Martin and Blake defeated Balcells and
Alberto Martin, 6-1, 6-4, 6-4, in 1 hour 40 minutes, interrupted by a
rain delay of more than 90 minutes in the second set.</TE>
<TE>   It was Todd Martin's first Davis Cup victory since April 1999
after seven consecutive losses, five singles and two doubles. The
victory gives the U.S. a 2-1 lead over Spain in this quarterfinal
round.</TE>
<TE>   In today's reverse singles, Andy Roddick is scheduled to play
Corretja, followed by Sampras against Tommy Robredo, if necessary.
Corretja had an MRI exam at a local hospital Saturday and said it
showed no additional problems. He is considered questionable for
today.</TE>
<TE>   "I was surprised he was hurt," U.S. captain Patrick McEnroe said.
"That's what's great or unique or whatever you want to say about
Davis Cup, it's about three days and it's about a team winning a
match. It's not about one player."</TE>
<TE>   Before Corretja's injury became known, the Americans spent a
"nervous evening," according to Todd Martin. Balcells and Corretja
are 5-2 in Davis Cup doubles together, including wins over Australia
and the United States. Alberto Martin, who replaced Corretja, is best
known for defeating Lleyton Hewitt in the first round at the
Australian Open in January, taking a controversial injury timeout in
the deciding fourth-set tiebreaker.</TE>
<TE>   (That is getting to be a trend. Robredo took an injury timeout for
a torn toenail at 7-7 in a third-set tiebreaker Friday, angering his
opponent, Roddick, and irritating McEnroe.)</TE>
<TE>   Alberto Martin is not known as a doubles specialist, though he did
win a minor ATP event in 2000. His serve was broken twice Saturday,
as was Balcells'. Even though Balcells is a better doubles player, he
had greater difficulty returning serve against Martin and Blake.</TE>
<TE>   The Spaniards had no aces and the Americans combined for 10.
Martin and Blake did not face a break point, and Martin's first-serve
percentage was an astonishing 84%.</TE>
<TE>   "When there's someone serving 84%, it makes it easier for me,"
Blake said. "He was returning great. I don't know if I was playing
well. It was just pretty easy with the way Todd was playing."</TE>
<TE>   Martin felt an emotional boost of sorts when Sampras arrived at
the site, smiling and ready to work out after the crushing singles
loss, having taken the first two sets against Corretja.</TE>
<TE>   "I said to James at lunch, 'I was not expecting the Pete that
showed up today,'" Martin said. "He had a great attitude. He was
happy and having fun. He was shooting baskets.</TE>
<TE>   "For me, it definitely gave me a real sense of comfort, knowing he
was still planning on being prepared if we didn't do our job today,
so he could win that fifth rubber."</TE>

<HD>Ishii Is Quickly Building Fan Base</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Rookie strikes out 10 and looks like crowd
favorite after impressive debut in 9-2 Dodger win.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GARY KLEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Dodgers spent $23.46 million to bring left-hander Kazuhisa Ishii
from Japan to Los Angeles. It was an investment that did not look as
if it would produce a windfall based on Ishii's spring-training
performance.</LD>
<LD>   But the rookie left the jitters behind Saturday night against the
Colorado Rockies and turned in a debut performance that might have
marked the start of Ishii-mania.</LD>
<LD>   Ishii gave up two hits, struck out 10 and walked three in 52/3
shutout innings as the Dodgers defeated the Rockies, 9-2, before
38,693 at Dodger Stadium. "He answered everybody's questions," Dodger
Manager Jim Tracy said.</LD>
<TE>   Ishii tied a Los Angeles Dodger record for strikeouts in a debut
set by Pedro Astacio on July 3, 1992, against the Philadelphia
Phillies. The major league record for strikeouts in a debut is 15,
held by former Brooklyn Dodger Karl Spooner and former Houston Astro
J.R. Richard.</TE>
<TE>   This is what the Dodgers expected when they paid $11.26 million to
the Yakult Swallows to earn the right to negotiate with Ishii, and
then signed him to a four-year, $12.2-million contract in February.
Ishii was 78-46 with a 3.38 earned-run average in the last 10 seasons
and pitched in six Japan Series.</TE>
<TE>   He looked nothing like a composed veteran during most of the
spring when he amassed a 12.96 earned-run average with 10 walks in
81/3 innings. Last Sunday, in his final exhibition start against the
Seattle Mariners at Safeco Field, he gave up five runs and walked
seven in 22/3 innings and pitched from behind in the count to 17 of
20 batters.</TE>
<TE>   "The biggest difference between my outing in Seattle and tonight
was my concentration level," Ishii said through interpreter Scott
Akasaki. "After my outing against Seattle, virtually all of my
teammates came up and gave me encouragement and I wanted to win for
them."</TE>
<TE>   Before Saturday night's game against the Rockies, Tracy described
what he would consider a good start for Ishii.</TE>
<TE>   "I think a positive start in his case or any other staff member is
to pitch deep enough into the game to give us a chance to win," Tracy
said.</TE>
<TE>   Ishii did just that, using a fastball, slider, curve and
split-fingered fastball to baffle Colorado hitters. He threw 95
pitches, 57 for strikes, as the Dodgers staked him to a 3-0 lead on a
run-scoring single by Eric Karros in the fourth and an RBI double by
Mark Grudzielanek and RBI single by Cesar Izturis in the fifth.</TE>
<TE>   After the Rockies pulled to within 3-2 in the seventh, the Dodgers
answered with a six-run inning highlighted by Brian Jordan's grand
slam into the left-field pavilion against reliever Todd Jones.</TE>
<TE>   But this game was all about Ishii, who helped the Dodgers rebound
from their 0-3 start to the season with their second consecutive win,
a night after right-hander Andy Ashby pitched seven shutout innings.</TE>
<TE>   Ishii got Mark Little to pop up the first pitch to second baseman
Grudzielanek, then struck out Juan Uribe and Larry Walker. In the
second inning, he sandwiched strikeouts of Todd Helton and Benny
Agbayani around a ground out by Todd Zeile. He retired the side in
order in the third.</TE>
<TE>   Ishii walked Little to open the fourth and, one out later, Walker
singled to right for the Rockies' first hit. Ishii, faced with his
first real test, struck out Helton for the second time with a slider
then caught Zeile looking at a 92-mph fastball for strike three.</TE>
<TE>   Ishii began to labor in the sixth, walking Uribe and Walker. After
Helton flied out, Ishii was replaced by right-hander Giovanni Carrara
and left to a rousing ovation.</TE>

<HD>Ashby Gives Bullpen a Break</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Less than 24 hours after pitching seven shutout innings against the
Colorado Rockies, Dodger pitcher Andy Ashby said Saturday that his
surgically repaired right elbow felt good.</LD>
<LD>   "There's a little bit of soreness, but that's about all," said
Ashby, who earned the Dodgers' first victory of the season Friday
night in his first appearance since last April 12.</LD>
<LD>   Ashby gave up one hit and struck out five in a performance Dodger
Manager Jim Tracy said preserved a bullpen that was stretched after
three losses to the San Francisco Giants.</LD>
<TE>   "If we had gotten into our bullpen early last night, that could
have been a somewhat devastating situation for us at this early
juncture of the season," Tracy said before Saturday's game. "He made
a very strong statement for himself. He picked our team up and he
picked the bullpen up."</TE>
<TE>   Ashby credited pitchers Darren Dreifort and Kevin Brown, among
others, for helping him in his return to the mound. Dreifort is
recovering from his second elbow surgery and Brown also had elbow
surgery last season.</TE>
<TE>   "They have been through the same things," Ashby said. "Last year,
we would put our heads together and watch games and talk a lot. As we
started to work out, we could ask each other, 'Does it feel like this
in the back of your arm? Is this how it felt when you did that?'"</TE>
<TE>   Dreifort, who said he has no specific timetable for his return,
was inspired by Ashby's outing.</TE>
<TE>   "Somewhere along the line, we all run into the same problems--the
stiffness, the achiness, control, velocity," Dreifort said. "So it
was good to see him go out and do what he did."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Tracy used the same lineup the first four games of the season, the
first time a Dodger manager enjoyed that much consistency since July
20-23, 1998.</TE>
<TE>   But on Saturday night, Tracy switched Adrian Beltre and Eric
Karros in the lineup. Karros, who went three for four with a home run
Friday night against the Rockies, was moved from seventh to sixth.
Tracy said the switch was not necessarily a reward for Karros but
"what's best for the club day to day."</TE>
<TE>   "[Karros] came out of spring training not exactly having set the
world on fire," Tracy said. "Right now, with the guy swinging the bat
the way he has and the opportunities we've been getting in the six
hole, I decided to make the move."</TE>
<TE>   Last season, Tracy used 114 starting lineups and never used the
same lineup more than three games in a row.</TE>

<HD>Ishii Provides a Shot in the Arm</HD>
<DH>Dodgers: Rookie left-hander's impressive debut is the third
consecutive strong outing for the rotation.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JASON REID</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Pitcher Kazuhisa Ishii was the center of attention Saturday night at
Dodger Stadium, putting the Dodgers on the spot too.</LD>
<LD>   The Japanese left-hander's major league debut would have been a
big deal under any circumstances, but Ishii's command problems in
spring training raised the stakes for him and concerned club
officials. It was finally time to raise the regular-season curtain
for better or worse, and the Dodgers were on the edge of their seats.</LD>
<LD>   Ishii put them at ease in the rotation's third consecutive strong
performance after consecutive flops, making the Colorado Rockies
uncomfortable in a 9-2 victory.</LD>
<TE>   After keeping the Dodgers guessing, Ishii delivered 52/3 shutout
innings and matched a Los Angeles franchise record with 10 strikeouts
in his first start. The Rockies were thrown off-balance from the
outset against his late-breaking slider, swinging wildly at Ishii's
best pitch, and sharp fastball clocked consistently at 92 mph.</TE>
<TE>   Talk about a collective sigh of relief.</TE>
<TE>   "I know he had some problems in the spring, so this might sound
crazy, but I really thought he was close to getting his rhythm,"
catcher Paul Lo Duca said. "I mean, you saw the stuff he throws, an
above-average fastball, curve, slider and split, and you just figured
he's too good not to get it all together at some point.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously, you need to see if he can do it every fifth day here.
That was a question that was going to be asked, especially with the
way it went for him in the spring. It's just a matter of him settling
in and getting used to all this media attention."</TE>
<TE>   The entire rotation is already under the microscope.</TE>
<TE>   Nos. 1 and 2 starters Kevin Brown and Hideo Nomo struggled in
their outings against the San Francisco Giants. However, Odalis Perez
worked 52/3 strong innings in his Dodger debut, and Andy Ashby was
sensational in shutting out the Rockies in seven innings Friday, his
first appearance since last April 12, while leading the Dodgers to
their first victory.</TE>
<TE>   With Ishii also delivering, General Manager Dan Evans believes the
new-look rotation is off to a solid start overall.</TE>
<TE>   "One through five, we're pretty good," Evans said. "I'm not going
to rank it, in terms of where our rotation is in relation to other
clubs, but we think that we will [avoid] longer losing streaks. The
advantage of having your strength in your pitching staff is that you
don't go into as many prolonged slumps with strong pitching staffs."</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers did not invest $23.46 million in Ishii to have him
work out of the bullpen, so he was going to begin the season in the
rotation no matter how he fared this spring. Of course, Ishii might
not have been so nervous had the Dodgers announced early in spring he
would open in the bullpen, but they couldn't change course with
Ishii's confidence already in question.</TE>
<TE>   "That's not something we were going to do because we believe in
this guy," Manager Jim Tracy said. "That's never been a question in
my mind, and I know [pitching coach Jim Colborn] feels the same way.</TE>
<TE>   "He's going to contribute to what the Los Angeles Dodgers are
trying to accomplish. And I'm not just talking about for this year."</TE>

<HD>Motorcycle Racer Died After Freak Accident</HD>
<DH>Motor sports: Lundgren, from La Mesa, was killed Friday,
getting hit by an airborne bike from another crash.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SHAV GLICK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Investigations of Ricky Lundgren's fatal motorcycle accident Friday
at California Speedway indicated that his fate was similar to that of
a highway driver hit head-on by an oncoming driver who crossed the
median.</LD>
<LD>   Only this time the oncoming bike had to catapult over a barrier
more than three feet high before smashing into Lundgren.</LD>
<LD>   Lundgren, 40, a La Mesa stockbroker with a wife and twin
2-year-old boys, died of injuries at Loma Linda University Medical
Center a little less than a hour after being hit in the freak
accident.</LD>
<TE>   "Another rider, Jeffrey Tigert, came through turn 8A and started
to enter turn 9, at which point he lost control of his motorcycle,
which then slid across the asphalt," explained Ron Barrick, American
Motorcyclist Assn. Pro Racing manager. "Based on reports from corner
workers, once [Tigert's motorcycle] got into a grass area it started
tumbling, which is nothing unusual.</TE>
<TE>   "As it got closer to the barriers that divide turn 9 from the turn
4 area, however, the [355-pound] bike somehow dug itself into the
ground and launched itself approximately five to six feet in the air.
The motorcycle then hit Lundgren's Suzuki as he was exiting turn 4."</TE>
<TE>   Tigert, a Suzuki rider from San Leandro, fell off his bike before
it got airborne and was treated and released from the speedway care
center with scrapes and shoulder pain.</TE>
<TE>   The incident occurred during the second qualifying session for 750
Superstock motorcycles, part of the three-day AMA Yamaha Challenge,
which will conclude today on the 2.3-mile, 21-turn course inside the
California Speedway oval.</TE>
<TE>   Reacting to the situation, track officials Saturday increased the
height of the barrier three times what it was Friday.</TE>
<TE>   AMA officials estimated that the distance from where Tigert first
lost control to where he reached the edge of the asphalt track was 60
to 70 feet. From the grass area to the barriers is about 100 feet.</TE>
<TE>   "I would estimate that the bike was six to eight feet from the
barrier when it had its last lurch and went into the air," said
Barrick. "From the barrier to where Ricky was struck was about 15 to
18 feet."</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Jeff Grange, speedway medical director, said that safety crews
were at Lundgren's side within seconds of the accident.</TE>
<TE>   "Fire truck personnel in turn 4 actually witnessed the accident
and immediately were initiating care of the rider," Dr. Grange said.
"Two ambulances were dispatched, but by the time they got there,
seconds after the crash, he wasn't breathing on his own. They were
able to secure an airway for him to breathe, and they started an IV.</TE>
<TE>   "He was taken straight to the helicopter for the trip to Loma
Linda. He still had a pulse, but on the way it lost his pulse."</TE>
<TE>   Lundgren was pronounced dead at 6:25 p.m., 45 minutes after the
accident.</TE>
<TE>   Superstocks are closer to showroom bikes than the more powerful
Superbike and SuperSport classes. One main difference is that they
use street tires, instead of the racing slicks used on the higher
classes.</TE>
<TE>   Lundgren rode regularly with the Willow Springs Motorcycle Club
and was making a move into faster company. Last month, at Daytona
International Speedway, he finished sixth, riding a Ducati, in the
Pro Thunder main event.</TE>
<TE>   Three other riders were injured during Friday's practice.</TE>
<TE>   Kurtis Roberts, son of former world champion Kenny Roberts,
injured his right knee and left ankle. Matt Hartlieb broke his left
wrist. Greg Esser had surgery to his left ankle and also suffered a
dislocated right shoulder. All were released.</TE>
<TE>   Barrick said that four accidents on the first day of practice and
qualifying on a new track is "below average."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Anthony Gobert, a factory Yamaha rider from Australia, won a
spectacular 100 kilometer Superbike race over Suzuki's Aaron Yates
after a delay that nearly caused AMA officials to call off the race,
No. 2 in the 16-race season.</TE>
<TE>   On-track activities were delayed seven hours because of wet and
cold weather before the first motorcycles took practice laps.</TE>
<TE>   Gobert was fastest qualifier with a lap of 97.126 mph, but
although he won from the pole it was far from a wire-to-wire win.
Gobert and Yates exchanged the lead several times with daring passes
through the tight turns of the new course.</TE>
<TE>   Daytona 200 winner Nicky Hayden finished third, with veteran Doug
Chandler fourth.</TE>
<TE>   The second 100-kilometer race of the AMA Yamaha Challenge is
scheduled for 3 p.m. today, following three support races that begin
at noon.</TE>

<HD>Galaxy's Ruiz Finds Mark</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GRAHAME L. JONES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There are nights when Zach Thornton is unquestionably the best
shot-stopper in Major League Soccer. Unfortunately for the Galaxy,
Saturday was one of those nights.</LD>
<LD>   Unfortunately for the Chicago Fire, Los Angeles has Carlos Ruiz in
its lineup, and no matter how imposing the opposing goalkeeper is,
the Guatemalan striker seems to find a way to beat him.</LD>
<LD>   In only his second MLS game Saturday night, Ruiz put the Galaxy
ahead in the 81st minute, watched Chicago tie it in the 89th, and
then stole a 2-1 victory with a goal 1:09 into overtime.</LD>
<TE>   Ruiz repeated the feat he pulled off in the season opener against
D.C. United two weeks ago, when he scored in regulation and 39
seconds into overtime to give the Galaxy a 2-1 victory.</TE>
<TE>   On Saturday, the 14,887 fans at the Rose Bowl had all but given up
hope of Los Angeles finding the back of the net after seeing Thornton
deny it time and again. For 80 minutes, the Galaxy threw everything
it had at Thornton but came up empty.</TE>
<TE>   A few examples:</TE>
<TE>   * Ruiz hammered a 25-yard volley that had goal written all over it
until Thornton got in the way.</TE>
<TE>   * Cobi Jones unleashed a shot from long range that
Thornton--remarkably agile for a 6-foot-3, 230-pound
netminder--leaped to tip over the crossbar.</TE>
<TE>   * Simon Elliott unloaded from 28 yards but Thornton was able to
fling himself to his left and turn the shot around the post.</TE>
<TE>   * Ezra Hendrickson crossed the ball in for Gavin Glinton to head
powerfully from point-blank range. Again, Thornton was in the right
place at the right time.</TE>
<TE>   Halftime came and went and still there was no breakthrough.
Finally, in the 81st minute, the Fire defense gave Thornton some help
he didn't need.</TE>
<TE>   Defender Billy Sleeth stepped in to cut out a cross from Glinton,
misplayed the ball and, to his dismay, saw Ruiz sneak in to stab it
into the open net, with Thornton having moved to cover the initial
cross that Sleeth should have left to him.</TE>
<TE>   The Galaxy appeared headed for a deserved victory when its defense
fell asleep, failing to clear the ball and allowing Ante Razov to
stick out a foot and poke it past goalkeeper Matt Reis.</TE>
<TE>   Regulation ended and Galaxy Coach Sigi Schmid sent Tyrone Marshall
into the game in place of Sasha Victorine. The former Miami Fusion
defender wasted little time in having an impact in his Galaxy debut.</TE>
<TE>   His cross from the right found Ruiz in front of the Chicago net
and the Guatemalan forward doesn't squander chances like that.
Thornton, who deserved better, was beaten from close range and was
left sitting on the ground in disbelief while the Galaxy celebrated
another improbable turn of events.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In other games Saturday:</TE>
<TE>   San Jose 2, New England 1--The Earthquakes were presented with
their 2001 MLS championship rings before the game, then went out and
beat the Revolution in front of 10,104 at San Jose. Midfielder Manny
Lagos put them ahead in the second minute, taking a pass from Ariel
Graziani and beating goalkeeper Juergen Sommer. Mamadou Diallo, the
league's 2000 scoring champion, tied it in the 38th minute with his
first goal for the Revolution. Denmark's Ronnie Ekelund netted the
winner in the 79th minute off a pass from Landon Donovan, who,
according to an Associated Press report Saturday, is considering an
offer to return to Bayer Leverkusen in Germany after the World Cup.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   New York/New Jersey 2, Columbus 1 (OT)--The MetroStars' "Turnpike
Triangle" offense of Clint Mathis, Rodrigo Faria and Diego Serna
caused the Crew defense all sorts of problems, but it was rookie Brad
Davis who scored the game-winner seven minutes into overtime in front

<LD>Not that Long Beach Poly came out of nowhere, but the Jackrabbits
were overachievers all season long.</LD>
<LD>   They lost only two games--to No. 1 Lynwood and No. 2 Harbor City
Narbonne--after winning their first 31. At 32-2, it wasn't perfect,
but it was close enough to raise eyebrows as well as expectations for
next season.</LD>
<LD>   For turning Poly into a state power when it was little more than a
regional top 10 team at the beginning of the season, Carl Buggs is
The Times' girls' basketball coach of the year.</LD>
<TE>   Buggs, in his third season, had a team without a player as tall as
6 feet. He utilized its quickness, calling for an aggressive defense
that caused opponents fits and often led to easy baskets for Kameca
Simmons, Cynthia Buggs and Aja Trotter.</TE>
<TE>   There were other outstanding coaching efforts this season,
including Ellis Barfield of Lynwood, who guided his team to an
undefeated season, and Yas Oda, who led Cantwell Sacred Heart, seeded
16th in the section playoffs, to its first title by beating teams
ranked Nos. 1, 4, 8 and 10 in Division IV-A.</TE>

<KH>GIRLS' BASKETBALL PLAYER OF THE YEAR</KH>
<HD>She's a Quinn-tessential Leader</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU>MARTIN HENDERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Richard Wiard walked off the court and you didn't even have to ask
him the question.</LD>
<LD>   "She's a pro," said the girls' basketball coach of La Puente
Bishop Amat High. "She's a pro."</LD>
<LD>   "She" is Noelle Quinn, who had just dismantled Wiard's team as she
had done so many others, putting on a show of style and grace, a dash
of flash and ending the day with a win and a smile.</LD>
<TE>   The 4.5 grade-point average, the 21.8 scoring average, the three
consecutive state Division III titles in her three years at Torrance
Bishop Montgomery are a testament to Quinn's focus, skills and
leadership, and she is The Times' girls' basketball player of the
year.</TE>
<TE>   Humility? "It is surprising," she said of the announcement,
"because there are so many good players in Division I."</TE>
<TE>   Leadership? "It's not all about scoring, but about everything else
... passing, rebounding, boxing out, those are all the fundamental
things we learned growing up, and we learned them for a reason. All
the little things add up to the big things."</TE>
<TE>   Talent? "She single-handedly raised that team three or four
notches," said Brea Olinda Coach Jeff Sink. "From the free-throw line
in, she's unstoppable. She's the prototype of what you're looking
for."</TE>
<TE>   A 6-foot junior guard who can also play forward, Quinn is quick, a
terrific jumper with a nice touch who could fit easily into any team,
but her coach, Lisa Cooper, is thankful it's Bishop Montgomery's.</TE>
<TE>   "The most impressive thing is that she's multi-talented and can
play more than one position," Cooper said. "Her desire to play is
outstanding; you can see it on the court, in her face, in her
effort."</TE>
<TE>   That effort yielded averages of 11.9 rebounds and 5.3 assists, as
well as 66.4% shooting from inside the three-point arc, 66.7% from
beyond (10 of 15).</TE>
<TE>   In her last five games--the Southern Section Division III-A final,
three state regional games and the state championship--Quinn's points
(23.2), rebounds (13.2), assists (5.4) and blocks (2.4) increased,
and her steals (3.6 to 3.8) were nearly identical.</TE>
<TE>   But for as talented as Quinn is on a basketball court, Cooper
said, "I like her personality best." "She's a team player, very
humble," Cooper said. "That only makes us better. She makes all the
other players step up and play to their potential. I think they all
have benefited, but Nykia [Peace] has benefited most because she's
following Nicole's footsteps, learning about her leadership and how
to control the game."</TE>
<TE>   Peace, a sophomore, is Bishop Montgomery's star of the future.
There is no doubt, though, who is the star of the present.</TE>

<HD>Goosen Surges Into Lead</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Retief Goosen has made several long putts at the BellSouth Classic.
Phil Mickelson couldn't make one from three feet--and it cost him the
lead.</LD>
<LD>   Goosen shot a four-under-par 68 in the third round Saturday at
Duluth, Ga., seizing a two-stroke advantage over Mickelson.</LD>
<LD>   Three days of sun and steady breezes turned the greens rock-hard
at the TPC at Sugarloaf.</LD>
<TE>   "If you get on the wrong side of the flag, anything can happen--no
matter how good your short game is," Goosen said.</TE>
<TE>   Mickelson found out how tricky those greens can be, four-putting
the 13th. Still, he wasn't too upset after shooting 71 in the
difficult conditions.</TE>
<TE>   "Retief played an incredible round to shoot four under on a day
like today," Mickelson said. "I feel like I've played three good,
solid rounds. I feel like if I can do one more good, solid round, I
should have a good opportunity to win."</TE>
<TE>   Goosen, whose only victory on American soil came at the U.S. Open
last year, was at 14 under with a 202 total.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm pretty happy where I am," Goosen said. "I've not been playing
well this week at all. But I've been putting great, and that's why I
am where I am."</TE>
<TE>   Mickelson is gunning for the 21st victory of his career. Only
Tiger Woods, who isn't playing this week, has more among active
players.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Doug Tewell made an eagle on the first hole to help vault him into
the lead after the second round of the Legends of Golf at St.
Augustine, Fla.</TE>
<TE>   Tewell used a six-iron to sink his second shot from 173 yards on
the par-four opening hole. It was the highlight of a round of
six-under 66 that left him at nine-under 135.</TE>
<TE>   One stroke behind was his playing partner, Stewart Ginn, who shot
67. Tom Jenkins shot the low round of the day, a 65 that left him
tied with Hale Irwin, two strokes back at 137.</TE>
<TE>   The shot of the day, of course, belonged to Tewell, who started
the second round tied for eighth place. Moments earlier, he had been
adjusting his setup on the driving range. Suddenly, he realized how
well the move worked, making eagle to climb six spots on the leader
board.</TE>
<TE>   "I equate it to NASCAR," Tewell said. "The car ran well after I
made the adjustment."</TE>

<DH>Horse racing: Came Home takes his time but still wins the
Santa Anita Derby, leaving McCarron confident about his chances in
Kentucky.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL CHRISTINE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The come-home time for Came Home was compared to molasses, and his
clocking for the entire race was the slowest since JFK was in the
White House, but Chris McCarron, the only jockey to ever ride him,
suggested that it would be foolhardy to use this data against the
colt.</LD>
<LD>   With Came Home, the winner of Saturday's $750,000 Santa Anita
Derby by 21/4 lengths before a crowd of 36,025, it's either one thing
or another. Going into Saturday, the widely held suspicion was that
McCarron's horse didn't have the lungs and the legs and the heart to
handle 11/8 miles. And now that he's done that, some of the same
critics are saying that he didn't do it fast enough. His winning time
was 1 minute 50 seconds.</LD>
<LD>   With the 11/4-mile Kentucky Derby less than a month away, at
Churchill Downs on May 4, the raw readings of the stopwatch seem to
be conclusive enough: The last time a Santa Anita Derby winner didn't
break 1:50 was Candy Spots' 1:501/5 performance in 1963; and Came
Home's final eighth of a mile in 132/5 seconds was the second slowest
for the race in the last 27 runnings.</LD>
<TE>   McCarron, winner of the Santa Anita Derby four times and twice the
winner of the Kentucky Derby, heard some of those things and went
into a defensive mode.</TE>
<TE>   "Anybody who places a lot of emphasis on that would be making a
mistake," he said. "The track wasn't as glib today as it might have
been."</TE>
<TE>   Then McCarron quoted his old friend Bill Hartack, who rode five
Kentucky Derby winners and once said, "The only time that time means
anything is when you're looking through those bars."</TE>
<TE>   McCarron went on to say that he likes his chances going into his
18th Kentucky Derby.</TE>
<TE>   "This horse has got everything it takes to win," he said. "Talent,
class, determination and speed. He's not a horse that runs from out
of the clouds, and with his kind of running style he won't have to
worry about traffic problems back there."</TE>
<TE>   It was a horse "from out of the clouds" that concerned McCarron
after he had disposed of Easy Grades in the final eighth of a mile,
but no one in the eight-horse field was able to put in that required
late run. Easy Grades, running with a misplaced chin strap, according
to his jockey, Gary Stevens, hung on for second, three-quarters of a
length better than Lusty Latin at 47-1, and they were followed across
by Mayakovsky and U S S Tinosa.</TE>
<TE>   At the rear were horses trained by Wayne Lukas and Bob Baffert,
who combined for five Kentucky Derby wins during the 1990s and aren't
likely to have starters this year. Lukas' Proud Citizen ran seventh
and Baffert's Danthebluegrassman finished last.</TE>
<TE>   The first three finishers are expected to return in the Kentucky
Derby, while Patrick Biancone, the trainer of Mayakovsky, said a
decision on his colt would be made later. Mayakovsky, stumbling badly
at the start, still made the lead and stayed there until the top of
the stretch.</TE>
<TE>   Came Home, paying $4.20 as the favorite, won for the sixth time in
seven starts and earned $450,000 for his owners, Californians Trudy
McCaffery and John Toffan, Will Farish of Kentucky and Texan John
Goodman. McCaffery and Toffan--and their trainer, Paco Gonzalez--have
been this way before, winning the 1997 Santa Anita Derby with Free
House before he ran third in Kentucky.</TE>
<TE>   McCaffery and Toffan, who also bred Came Home, unsuccessfully
tried to sell their undersized colt three times at auction.</TE>
<TE>   "There are no comparisons between Free House and Came Home,"
McCaffery said. "It's like apples and oranges, because Came Home is
such a beautifully bred colt."</TE>
<TE>   Came Home, whose only loss was a seventh-place finish in the
Breeders' Cup Juvenile, stalked Mayakovsky all the way. The winner
was a head back after a half-mile and a half-length from the lead
after six furlongs.</TE>
<TE>   Heading for home, Came Home and Easy Grades, who was four horses
wide, were bearing down on Mayakovsky. Just past the three-sixteenths
pole, Easy Grades edged ahead of Came Home by a neck. McCarron knew
he had to go to his whip.</TE>
<TE>   "That's the most I've ever hit him in a race," he said. "I've
never had to apply the stick as vigorously on him as I did today."</TE>
<TE>   Stevens, an eight-time winner of the race, was frustrated after
riding Easy Grades for the first time.</TE>
<TE>   "He ran well under the circumstances," the jockey said. "There was
a major equipment problem. The chin strap was above the reins as
opposed to below the reins, and I basically had no steering
throughout the race. That's why he was so wide, and every time I'd
pull on him it would have a reverse effect. It was hurting him, and
it would make him get out even worse on me."</TE>
<TE>   Ted West, father of Ted H. West, who trains Easy Grades, said the
horse's equipment was checked after the race and the chin strap was
indeed misplaced.</TE>
<TE>   "The guy who cleans the equipment put the strap in the wrong
place," the elder West said. "But I've watched the rerun, and I don't
think it bothered the horse and I'm not going to use that as an
excuse. It's strange that Gary didn't notice anything in the post
parade. But I can understand him saying what he said. He's such a
competitor and he was disappointed that he didn't win."</TE>
<TE>   The unsung Gonzalez was singled out by McCarron for an exceptional
training job. A couple of weeks ago, Came Home strained a back muscle
in a fluky, late-night stall accident and Gonzalez felt he was going
into Saturday's race one workout short.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of trainers would have put their horse to the test with the
workouts Paco was able to squeeze in," McCarron said, "but he took a
different route. He just breezed him easy."</TE>
<TE>   Gonzalez said almost every day was a headache leading up to the
race.</TE>
<TE>   "That's all right, Paco," McCarron said. "You can buy a lot of
aspirin now."</TE>

<LD>   Three years ago, Tel Aviv seemed like a great deal.</LD>
<LD>   The days were sunny and the people were nice. Nate Huffman figured
he could play a few seasons of professional basketball in Israel,
make some money, sharpen his game for another shot at the NBA.
Everything went as planned, even better, for a while.</LD>
<TE>   His team, Maccabi Tel Aviv, won a European championship and NBA
scouts took notice of the 7-foot center. One more season, Huffman
thought. Play one more season and head back home.</TE>

an intersection where, a few minutes later, there was an explosion.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to deal with the suicide bombers," he says. "You don't
know where to go."</TE>
<TE>   Not that anyone should feel sorry for him. In the grand scheme of
things, one scared American athlete doesn't stack up against millions
of Israelis and Palestinians who live with violence each day. This is
simply a tale of a small-town kid in a jam, a gym rat caught between
the insular world of sports and the real world.</TE>
<TE>   For now, Huffman, 27, is staying put. His wife and 8-year-old
stepson are determined to remain by his side.</TE>
<TE>   They are staying for reasons they can articulate and some they
cannot. They are staying until Maccabi finishes its schedule.</TE>
<TE>   "Two more months," Huffman says. "Knock on wood we get out of here
alive."</TE>
<TE>   If the name sounds vaguely familiar, that is because Huffman was a
rookie free agent with the Clippers in 1997, what he calls "a long
time ago" during a telephone interview from Tel Aviv. Undrafted out
of Central Michigan, he was considered a raw talent.</TE>
<TE>   "He's got to learn better techniques," former Clipper Coach Bill
Fitch said then. "It's tough to make it the first time around in this
league."</TE>
<TE>   Cut three days before the season, Huffman wasn't about to give up
on his dream, not with the NBA logo tattooed on his arm. The young
man from Battle Creek, Mich., set out on a journeyman's path.</TE>
<TE>   First came a season with the Idaho Stampede in the Continental
Basketball Assn., then a season with a struggling Spanish team.
Baloncesto Fuenlabrada unexpectedly made the playoffs that year and
the big man in the middle was no longer unknown.</TE>
<TE>   Maccabi, perennially the best team in Israel, signed him in 1999
to a roster that included several Americans. Averaging 17 points and
eight rebounds, Huffman--who is not Jewish--became a team leader and
celebrity in Tel Aviv. Kids wore replicas of his jersey and fans
asked for autographs on the street. His wife, Jennifer, whom he had
met in Idaho, fell in love with the seaside capital.</TE>
<TE>   "The people were amazing," she recalls. "They welcomed us like
family."</TE>
<TE>   The team went deep into the playoffs that first season. Then, in
2000-01, with Huffman earning Europe's player-of-the-year award,
Maccabi won the Suproleague championship, the first time an Israeli
squad had taken a European title in two decades. "I never looked
back," he says.</TE>
<TE>   Who could blame him for ignoring the battles that raged to the
north and south?</TE>
<TE>   On the day of Maccabi's historic victory last year, the Israeli
army carried out missile strikes on Palestinian security targets in
the Gaza Strip. Yet the news in Israel featured 50,000 delirious
basketball fans in Rabin Square and Huffman told himself Tel Aviv was
safer than traditional hot spots such as Jerusalem.</TE>
<TE>   The choice seemed easy when the San Antonio Spurs offered him the
league minimum of $332,000 last summer and Maccabi countered with a
reported $2 million. As fate would have it, the Israeli club tendered
its offer on Sept. 9. Two days later, after terrorists attacked New
York City and the Pentagon, Huffman's family begged him not to go
back.</TE>
<TE>   "I had to look at my future," he says. "They made me one of the
highest-paid players in Europe."</TE>
<TE>   Such is the appetite for basketball in Tel Aviv that people still
tell stories about 1991 when, with the Persian Gulf War raging and
Scud missiles landing on Israel, fans came to Yad Eliyahu Sport
Palace wearing gas masks. And now that the city is a more frequent
target for terrorists, the 10,000-seat arena is still packed for
games against European opponents.</TE>
<TE>   In much the same way, Huffman and his family have tried to live as
normally as possible. He lifts weights each afternoon and practices
in the evening. Sometimes they go to a restaurant or a movie, taking
advantage of the fact that such places are less crowded.</TE>
<TE>   "You almost forget," Jennifer says. "Then you go to a mall and
they're doing a full search and pat-down just to get into the Gap."</TE>
<TE>   Which raises the question: Why stay?</TE>
<TE>   Money is a big part of the answer. Those Maccabi checks are being
invested, building a nest egg for when basketball is over. After
that, the reasoning gets tricky.</TE>
<TE>   At times, Huffman flashes bravado, insisting he won't be
frightened away. "I don't want to change my daily routine," he says.
He can no longer rationalize that Tel Aviv is removed from the
conflict but insists his neighborhood is safer than others in the
city.</TE>
<TE>   Jennifer, meanwhile, wants to be with her husband and has adopted
a kind of fatalism: "You have a date next to your name. That's the
day you are going to die. You go about your life."</TE>
<TE>   As for Clayton, the son, he is developmentally delayed and does
not fully comprehend the danger. He likes going to school where they
teach him English, Hebrew and social skills.</TE>
<TE>   But for all their courage and obstinacy, the Huffmans admit being
scared. They watch where they go, staying out of crowded areas,
avoiding street markets. Jennifer is prone to shop on-line. She does
not know enough about accents or appearances, so when she is out with
an Israeli friend, she will discreetly ask if the man sitting across
from them could be Palestinian.</TE>
<TE>   The routine grows wearisome. As she says: "There's a thin line
between supporting your husband and saying, 'Forget it, I'm going
home.'"</TE>
<TE>   Some American players on other Israeli teams, particularly those
not in contention for the playoffs, have left the country.</TE>
<TE>   For now, the Huffmans have decided not to leave unless Israel
declares war. Nate has spoken to team officials and plans have been
laid. Jennifer and Clayton would fly immediately to Athens. He would
stay behind to pack up the apartment, then follow a few days later.</TE>
<TE>   The couple takes solace in knowing that, either way, they will
soon leave the bloodshed behind. Huffman says his agent has fielded
calls from several teams, including the Memphis Grizzlies and Boston
Celtics. "I'd like to come home and play," he says.</TE>
<TE>   Two more months. That's what he tells relatives when they call,
when brothers and sisters plead with him to return immediately.</TE>
<TE>   "That's the hardest thing," he says. "I tell them I have a job to
do and I want to finish it."</TE>

<LD>A little more than six months ago, many people had Officer primed to
do big things on the first Saturday in May.</LD>
<LD>   Now, those same folks will have to settle for the California-bred
being successful on the first Sunday of April.</LD>
<LD>   Proven a Kentucky Derby pretender with consecutive defeats in the
Breeders' Cup Juvenile, California Cup Juvenile and Hollywood
Futurity, Officer will make his first start as a 3-year-old in the
$100,000 Zany Tactics Stakes today at Santa Anita. The race is not
part of the pick six, which has a carryover of $243,519.</LD>
<TE>   Trained by Bob Baffert for owner Prince Ahmed Salman's
Thoroughbred Corp., Officer is the 3-5 favorite in the Zany Tactics,
a 61/2-furlong sprint restricted to Cal breds.</TE>
<TE>   The $700,000 2-year-old purchase who began his career with five
easy wins has trained quickly for his first start in nearly four
months and he is unbeaten in races around one turn. Victor Espinoza,
who is five for six on the colt, is back aboard.</TE>
<TE>   At Keeneland, Cashel Castle, who is unbeaten in four starts for
the Sandbar Farm and trainer Chris Block, will make his graded stakes
debut in the $100,000 Lafayette.</TE>
<TE>   The seven-furlong Grade III race also attracted Governor Hickel,
Axis, Laffit, Cicero Grimes, Storm Commander, Super Striker and Sky
Terrace.</TE>
<TE>   Race of the day: Geana Dawn, voted claimer of the meet at the
recently concluded Golden Gate Fields meet, will shoot for her sixth
win in a row in today's eighth, the fifth leg in a Bay Meadows pick
six that has a $132,947 carryover. The filly hasn't lost since being
claimed for $6,250 by trainer Jerry Hollendorfer for owner Mark
Murphy.</TE>
<TE>   Who's hot: John Kimmel. The trainer is winning at a 27% clip at
Gulfstream Park.</TE>
<TE>   Who's not: James Hatchett. The trainer is winless with his first
31 starters at Gulfstream.</TE>
<TE>   Exotically speaking: A pick three using Pressure Play and Complete
Class in the fourth, La Bandera and Glitterbend in the fifth and
Sonoita, Giotto and Poker Willy in the sixth.</TE>
<TE>   Winners: Previous day/meet total: 3/205. Money: Previous day/meet
total: $17.60/$1,197.40. Total money bet: $1,272.</TE>

<HD>Preparation Pays Off for Clanton</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Joey Clanton knew going into Saturday's qualifying for the American
Speed Assn. TireRack.com 300 at Irwindale Speedway that his biggest
challenge for the pole would come from Gary St. Amant and Kevin
Cywinski, two veterans of the short track series.</LD>
<LD>   "We pulled a couple of all-nighters to get the car ready for
today," Clanton said after posting a top qualifying time of 17.949
seconds on the half-mile track.</LD>
<LD>   Clanton, from Stockbridge, Ga., had held off St. Amant and
Cywinski two weeks ago to win the WJ Plemons Investments 200, the
series opener in Lakeland, Fla., but with the overcast skies keeping
the track cool Saturday, the qualifying times averaged just over 18
seconds.</LD>
<TE>   Cywinski had drawn the sixth qualifying spot, and had set an early
time of 18.008 seconds, with Clanton and St. Amant near the bottom of
the draw. Clanton overtook Cywinski for the pole, but then had to
wait and see if St. Amant would catch him with the final run of the
day.</TE>
<TE>   Before the qualifying started, the drivers had to work through two
practice crashes that thinned the field of three of the 33 cars. A
driver involved in the first crash, David Stremme of South Bend,
Ind., was able to get his backup car through the technical inspection
in time to qualify 14th.</TE>
<TE>   However, on Stremme's final qualifying lap, his tires came in
contact with the oil his original car dropped in the first accident
and his care slid into the wall along turn 3, damaging the rear end
of the car.</TE>
<TE>   As the regular card opened at the track, Stremme's crew was trying
to merge the damaged cars into one that could pass inspection for
today's event.</TE>
<TE>   Rip Michels of Mission Hills needed only 19 laps to take control
of the field and win the 75-lap Jani-King Super Late Model Series
feature before 3,620 fans at Irwindale.</TE>
<TE>   "We a lot of bad luck running out here last year," said Michels,
"but today we came out and ran as hard as we could today."</TE>
<TE>   Not only did Michels win the feature race, but he also claimed the
top qualifying speed and won the six-lap trophy dash.</TE>
<TE>   Tony Green of Oak Hills, who won the first race of the season, was
second and Ben Walker of North Hills was third.</TE>
<TE>   Walker, a former NASCAR Featherlite Southwest Series driver, had
taken the early lead by getting a jump on Michels at the green flag.
But Michels, who started third, snatched the lead on lap 19.</TE>
<TE>   Walker stayed close for the next six laps, but once Michels
cleared the lap traffic, his lead increased by as much as 2.5 seconds
until a yellow flag on lap 49, but Michels quickly regained his lead.</TE>
<TE>   In the 40-lap Vista Paint Super Stock series feature, Darren Cheek
made it three in a row, holding off Julianne Seeley and Greg
Crutcher. Seeley, who had been fourth entering lap 38, moved up to
second when Will Cottrell and Andrew Phipps collided at the
start/finish line and spun into the pit wall, knocking both out of
the race. Seeley's finish tied her with USAC Three-Quarter Midget
driver Randi Pankratz and Legends driver Dana Moore as the
highest-finishing women at the track.</TE>
<TE>   In the 35-lap Grand American Modified Series feature, Roger
Carufel, Jr. went wire-to-wire to win, holding off Steve Luecht and
Eddie Ernst by more than 6.5 seconds.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Jeff Purvis won the NASCAR Busch O'Reilly 300 at Fort Worth,
leading only the last six laps under caution after he took only two
tires on his final pit stop and was in front when rain ended the
race.</TE>
<TE>   Purvis was running 10th when the caution flag came out on lap 108
after Kasey Kahne spun out of control at the entrance to pit row.</TE>
<TE>   Soon after the drivers had completed their pits stops, rain began
to fall again with the caution flag still flying. The race, the start
of which was delayed 31/2 hours by rain, was finally called with only
116 of 200 scheduled laps completed.</TE>
<TE>   When the pits opened after Kahne's spinout, dark skies were again
threatening Texas Motor Speedway. Purvis' crew chief, Terry Shirley,
opted to take only two tires instead of four like the rest of the
front-runners.</TE>
<TE>   Purvis got out the pits first for a race that never went back to
green.</TE>
<TE>   Jack Sprague, who had taken the lead from polesitter Jeff Green on
lap 43 during another caution, finished second.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   John Force will go for his 100th career Funny Car victory today at
the NHRA SummitRacing.com Nationals from the top qualifying position.</TE>
<TE>   Force had the 109th top qualifying effort of his career and third
of the season with a quarter-mile run Friday of 4.831 seconds at
315.86. Those numbers held up Saturday, and Force will face Dean
Skuza in the opening round at Las Vegas Motor Speedway.</TE>
<TE>   Larry Dixon and Ron Krisher also had No. 1 positions.</TE>
<TE>   Top Fuel driver Dixon claimed his third No. 1 of the season and
15th of his career when no one improved on his 4.575 at 325.37.
Krisher had his fourth consecutive top qualifying effort in Pro
Stock, clocking a 6.954 at 198.23.</TE>
<TE>   Reigning 250cc EA Sports Supercross champion Ricky Carmichael won
his sixth consecutive main event and his eighth victory of the season
before 53,312 at St. Louis.</TE>
<TE>   Chad Reed won his first 125cc Eastern Regional championship and
extended his winning streak to eight.</TE>

<HD>Johnson Returns to Lineup</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The Kings' injury list was blank. Nobody was under suspension.</LD>
<LD>   For the first time all season, everybody was available to play
Saturday night against the Edmonton Oilers, including left wing Craig
Johnson, cleared to return after sitting out eight games because of
an eye injury.</LD>
<LD>   "Obviously, we've got some decisions to make," Coach Andy Murray
said before the game. "You'd like to play with as set a lineup as you
could and that's our plan. Obviously, individual performances dictate
how you handle that."</LD>
<TE>   The most pressing lineup issue Saturday was the reinsertion of
Johnson, who had surgery March 19 to repair a torn right retina.</TE>
<TE>   On the one hand, "he's been a very good player for us this year,
very efficient," Murray said. "He can play a number of different
roles."</TE>
<TE>   On the other, he hadn't played in nearly three weeks and inserting
Johnson would mean scratching Jaroslav Bednar or Ken Belanger, both
of whom played well in Thursday night's 3-0 victory against the
Detroit Red Wings.</TE>
<TE>   "It's tough," Murray said. "Before the Detroit game, I couldn't
wait for Craig Johnson to get back in the lineup. I kept telling our
trainers, 'We've got to have him in there for Detroit.' And now we
played pretty well and you come back and you say, 'Can we give him a
couple more days and have him ready for [Monday]?'"</TE>
<TE>   In the end, he used him against the Oilers. Bednar was scratched.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Brad Chartrand played so well centering the Kings' checking line
while Eric Belanger was sidelined for 21/2 months because of a wrist
injury that when Belanger returned to the lineup last week, Murray
did not reunite him with linemates Ian Laperriere and Mikko Eloranta.</TE>
<TE>   "You could switch Eric there for Brad Chartrand," the coach said,
"but I'm a little hesitant because I think Chartrand is playing very
well and I think that line's been as good a unit as we've had the
last two or three months."</TE>

<HD>Palffy Wins It for Kings</HD>
<DH>Hockey: His second goal of game 28 seconds into overtime is
difference in 4-3 victory over Oilers. L.A. is fifth in West.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JERRY CROWE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When Anson Carter of the Edmonton Oilers deprived the Kings of a
victory in regulation Saturday night, scoring the tying goal with 10
seconds to play in the third period, the Kings did not sulk.</LD>
<LD>   They did not hang their heads.</LD>
<LD>   They did not quit.</LD>
<TE>   Instead, they told themselves to make the most of the overtime.</TE>
<TE>   And when Ziggy Palffy scored his second goal of the game 28
seconds into the extra period, redirecting a pass from Jason Allison,
the Kings emerged with a 4-3 victory in front of a sellout crowd of
18,311 at Staples Center.</TE>
<TE>   "We just said, 'It's over with, let's go out and win the game
anyway,'" Allison said. "That's the type of character we have on this
team."</TE>
<TE>   The victory, extending their home unbeaten streak to nine games,
moved the Kings past the idle Phoenix Coyotes and St. Louis Blues
into fifth place in the packed Western Conference playoff race. They
are 7-0-2 at Staples Center since March 2, when they lost to the
Columbus Blue Jackets, 2-0.</TE>
<TE>   The loss, meanwhile, sent the Oilers home winless from their
Southland swing after they had lost Friday night to the Mighty Ducks,
2-0, though they earned a point and remained eighth in the playoff
race, two points ahead of the idle Vancouver Canucks and Dallas
Stars.</TE>
<TE>   Carter's goal pulled the Oilers even after Philippe Boucher had
given the Kings a 3-2 lead with 2:24 to play, but they were unable to
avoid becoming the 10th team in 12 games to lose to the Kings after
playing the night before in Anaheim.</TE>
<TE>   Palffy scored on a two-on-one breakaway after Allison chipped the
puck out of a scrum along the boards and carried it up the left wing.</TE>
<TE>   "I definitely wanted to give him a good chance," Allison said. "I
didn't want to give it to him too early. I wanted him to have
something to shoot at, so I moved over a little bit to give him some
room."</TE>
<TE>   Said Palffy, whose 30th goal lifted the Kings over the 90-point
plateau for the third consecutive season: "[The defender] was pretty
much holding but I was able to fight him off and the goal was pretty
much easy."</TE>
<TE>   Coach Andy Murray said everything happened so quickly that there
was no time for the Kings to experience a letdown, Carter's goal
notwithstanding.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought we played it really well," he said. "It was a great
play to win it. It's tough to have that responsibility to score in
this league every night. Jason and Ziggy have that, and they came
through. It was pretty exciting."</TE>
<TE>   With 91 points, the Kings are tied in the West with the Chicago
Blackhawks, with the Blackhawks holding the tiebreaker--and the No. 4
spot--because they have one more victory.</TE>
<TE>   As Saturday dawned, the Kings were seventh in the West, with the
three teams sitting directly behind them in the playoff race--the
Oilers, Stars and Canucks--lined up as their next three opponents.</TE>
<TE>   With nine days left in the regular season, they held their own
fate, as surely they were aware and their coach was only too happy to
remind them.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to retain a firm grip on the reins where we're in charge
of what happens," Murray said before the game.</TE>
<TE>   Ryan Smyth gave the Oilers a 1-0 lead with 24 seconds to play in
the first period, scoring with the Oilers enjoying a two-man
advantage.</TE>
<TE>   A power-play goal by Palffy and an even-strength goal by Brad
Chartrand in the second period put the Kings ahead, 2-1, but Carter
scored a power-play goal with 14:47 to play in the third, setting up
the wild final minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Boucher's goal, scored on a blast from the right point, looked
like the winner until a late turnover by the defenseman led to
Carter's second goal, scored after Ryan Smyth threaded a pass between
the legs of defenseman Mattias Norstrom.</TE>
<TE>   "It's still not out of my head," Boucher said. "I had time, but
the guy made a good play to keep it in. Let's say that I'm really
glad that we won it in overtime."</TE>

<DL>MIAMI</DL>
<LD>The Lakers left Los Angeles six days ago. They had hopes. They had
dreams. They had no idea.</LD>
<LD>   They play the dead-and-gone Miami Heat today in the last of a
four-game trip. No matter the outcome, they will have had a fairly
miserable time, losing twice in the Northeast without Shaquille
O'Neal, ruining the home-court aspirations they claimed not to have
and killing the momentum they said they didn't need.</LD>
<LD>   O'Neal's wrist is sprained and Coach Phil Jackson is limping worse
than usual, additional agony for a man beset by afflictions of the
back and hip. Assistant coach Kurt Rambis is carrying six stitches in
his lower leg and power forward Samaki Walker is short a few pounds
because of a viral infection. Lindsey Hunter has a nasty cough,
Robert Horry's Achilles' tendon is achy and trainer Gary Vitti has
sweat through a couple of suits running from patient to patient.</LD>
<TE>   The Sacramento Kings, meanwhile, went east, worked their way west,
and won all six games, so it seems they'll coast to the Pacific
Division title. While the Kings finished that up, Walker was in a
dingy locker room sharing his disappointment in teammates he believed
"gave up" during a blowout loss to the Boston Celtics. He did not
mention anyone specifically, but apparently only Jelani McCoy, who is
on the injured list, and O'Neal were without blame. Perhaps they all
regretted they didn't bother with a shoot-around Friday morning at
FleetCenter, since they turned that into a tidy 28-for-82 mess in a
99-81 loss.</TE>
<TE>   None of it matters if Shaq can become Shaq again in the next two
weeks, in time for the playoffs, in time to make the Lakers the
Lakers again.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson expects O'Neal to play today, though officially O'Neal,
who received more treatment Saturday, is a game-time decision.</TE>
<TE>   Before he injured his wrist, O'Neal appeared to be moving better,
suggesting his new shoes and orthotic devices were easing the
season-long pain from his arthritic big toe. O'Neal won't say. He
addresses the media only when moved, and lately that's often meant
after he scores a lot of points.</TE>
<TE>   Saturday's practice at AmericanAirlines Arena was optional, and a
handful of Lakers showed up, some to shoot, some to lift weights.
Derek Fisher shot jump shots and free throws, and a yellow-shirted
security guard pushed rebounds back at him.</TE>
<TE>   Hunter, Slava Medvedenko and Devean George played a three
point-shooting game, while Mark Madsen set up security guards like
cones and practiced his pull-up jump shot.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>

<TE>   2:30 p.m. PDT, Channel 4</TE>

<TE>   Radio--KLAC (570).</TE>
<TE>   Records--Lakers 53-23, Heat 33-42.</TE>

<TE>   Update--In last place the last time it played the Lakers, the Heat
got a little healthier and made a run at the playoffs before falling
off again. Pat Riley has clinched his first losing season as a coach.
Before beating Milwaukee, 102-97, the Heat had lost three in a row
and seven of eight. The Lakers have lost two in a row. They've lost
three consecutive games in the Phil Jackson era once, when they fell
to Atlanta, Portland and Boston over five days in February.</TE>

<HD>Pak Keeps Trying to Wear Down Field</HD>
<DH>Golf: Second-round 68 gives her three-stroke lead in event
where LPGA's quest for sex appeal is clearly evident.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PETER YOON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Let's forget about sex and the LPGA Tour for a minute. Granted,
that's not exactly easy with scantily clad models parading near the
clubhouse, as happened Saturday during the second round of the Office
Depot Championship Hosted by Amy Alcott.</LD>
<LD>   But let's try to put aside Commissioner Ty Votaw's plan to attract
more fan interest by, among other things, drawing more attention to
the physical appearance of players. What the tour really needs more
of, it is likely to get today in the final round: compelling
competition.</LD>
<LD>   Se Ri Pak, Annika Sorenstam and Laura Diaz, three of the fiercest
competitors on the tour, will lock horns in the final group at El
Caballero Country Club in Tarzana. Pak, a South Korean who won five
times last year, has the lead at eight under par after shooting a
second consecutive 68 on Saturday. Sorenstam, an eight-time winner
last year and two-time winner already this year, also shot 68 and is
three strokes back.</LD>
<TE>   Diaz, a feisty grinder who had three second-place finishes last
year before finally breaking through with her first career victory
March 24 in Tucson, is four behind Pak at four-under after a 69
Saturday. Sorenstam, Pak and Diaz finished first, second and sixth,
respectively, in the 2001 player-of-the-year standings. That gives
the final group all the makings of a classic showdown that should
test the will of three players who hate losing more than just about
anything else.</TE>
<TE>   Its potential for high drama could also draw attention away from
players' outfits and the amount of skin they should show, subjects
that seem to have surpassed all others as the main topic of
discussion on the tour.</TE>
<TE>   "This is what it's all about," said Sorenstam, the defending
champion. "I'm right in the heat of it and that's what I love. I'm
glad I'm playing in the last group to show Se Ri that I'm here and
I'm looking to [put pressure on] her."</TE>
<TE>   Pak won't be easy to catch. She has entered the final round with a
lead 11 times in her career and cashed a winner's check after nine of
them. Sorenstam, however, has made final-round rallies in 11 of her
32 career victories. Last year, she equaled a tour record by erasing
a 10-shot, final-round deficit to win this tournament.</TE>
<TE>   "She's a great player," Pak said. "I'm not going to go out there
and push myself too hard. No matter if you're behind or leading you
still have to play aggressive. I'm just going to do the best that I
can and try to make as many birdies as I can."</TE>
<TE>   Diaz is the wild card. Her career pattern suggests that she is the
player most likely to have a breakout season this year and join
Sorenstam, Pak and Karrie Webb at the top.</TE>
<TE>   Since joining the tour in 1999, Diaz has been 64th, 33rd and ninth
on the money list. She had two top-10 finishes in 1999, four in 2000
and 12 last season. Moreover, she will not be intimidated by playing
with the top players in the world.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd like to think I have the privilege of playing with two of the
best players in the world," Diaz said. "I'll take that opportunity
any time I can get it. I'll just go out there and play my own game
and I'd like to have the least number of strokes after 54 holes."</TE>
<TE>   It looked as if Pak would run away with the tournament. She
birdied Nos. 3, 7 and 13 to go seven under. At the time, she led by
six over Sorenstam and the nearest competitor was Michelle Estill,
four shots back. Sorenstam, playing a group behind Pak, birdied Nos.
13-15 and was within two shots after the leader bogeyed the par-three
16th. But Pak parlayed a booming drive on the par-five 17th into an
eagle and a four-stroke lead.</TE>
<TE>   Sorenstam, who birdied the same hole to narrow the margin to
three, said she likes her position anytime she is in the final group.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't want the lead to be too big but hopefully I can get off
to a good start and put some pressure on her," Sorenstam said. "I've
always said it's not over until it's over and I think I proved that
last year."</TE>

<DL>MIAMI</DL>
<LD>OK, Laker fans, it's ... exhibition season!</LD>
<LD>   In April, the NBA awakens as if from a nap, emerging from the
shadow of the NCAA tournament and the baseball openers, readying
itself for its stretch run and its own moment in the spotlight.</LD>
<LD>   The Lakers, of course, have been awaiting this moment since the
season started, although now that it's here, it isn't going the way
they pictured it.</LD>
<TE>   They came east last week off wins over the Portland Trail Blazers
and San Antonio Spurs, hoping to reprise last April's season-ending
streak. Instead, Shaquille O'Neal sat out and they lost twice, the
second time so badly, the debate among them was whether they had
"quit" (the word used by guileless Samaki Walker) or just uninspired
and numb (more experienced spokesman Rick Fox's perspective.)</TE>
<TE>   In either case, the moral of the story is the same: This ain't
last April.</TE>
<TE>   Forget the Kings. Barring a collapse by a team that just won seven
in a row, six on the road, Sacramento has locked up the No. 1 seed
and will have home-court advantage in any series.</TE>
<TE>   Now the Lakers are looking over their shoulders, not ahead. The
Spurs-Dallas Maverick winner is automatically seeded No. 2, but
home-court advantage in any second-round meeting with the
third-seeded Lakers would still be determined by the best record.</TE>
<TE>   Let's just say that opening against probable No. 6 seed Portland,
which has been hot since the All-Star break, then going to San
Antonio or Dallas before going to Sacramento to play the Kings
wouldn't be the easy route for the Lakers.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, everything depends on O'Neal, which is reassuring to
them, since no one can stand up to him ... or less so if the wrong
Shaq shows up.</TE>
<TE>   When the trip started, teammates were praising O'Neal for "pacing
himself" so deftly, as Kobe Bryant had put it, a nice way of saying
Shaq had looked like a zombie in the first half against the Spurs
last Sunday before stepping up at the end.</TE>
<TE>   Someone asked Coach Phil Jackson in Washington if O'Neal had,
indeed, been pacing himself for the last five or six games.</TE>
<TE>   "Fifty or 60 games?" said Jackson, rephrasing it with his little
Cheshire Cat grin. "I think he's just waiting until he really has to
get into it. It looks like he warms up, to me. It looks like he gets
more mobility as the game goes along.... We're hopeful. We think he's
getting more active as the season goes on and we'll see what it looks
like tonight."</TE>
<TE>   That night O'Neal looked more energetic, but his struggles
continued. He had already missed one dunk by the time Jahidi White
blocked one of his shots, after which Shaq grabbed the ball back,
went up to hurl one down that they'd have felt in Annapolis and
blasted it off the rim, too.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers nevertheless rolled to their third consecutive win. The
players told one another it was on again. The Washington media
gushed, "They're throwing their switch again."</TE>
<TE>   Wizard Coach Doug Collins called them "a vastly superior team ...
the big-time favorite ... a very underrated defensive team. When they
have to, they stop you," adding he'd been impressed as well by their
"championship arrogance."</TE>
<TE>   "The [Chicago] Bulls used to have that same swagger," said
Collins, "that they knew they were better than you."</TE>
<TE>   In New Jersey the next night, without O'Neal, the swagger
disappeared. Down 19 early, the Lakers played bravely but lost.</TE>
<TE>   Two nights later in Boston, the Lakers, themselves, disappeared in
a team no-show.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal is expected back today, but which one will he be? There
have been so many. Let us count only the recent ones.</TE>
<TE>   There was the 90% Shaq On A Mission in Jackson's first season,
playing harder than he had since his first years in the league but
with all the craft he'd acquired since, missing by one vote of
becoming the first unanimous most valuable player selection (seeming
to anger him at least as much as flatter him, in true Shaq style) ...
turning it up to 100% Fearsome Shaq in the NBA Finals when he
averaged 38 against the Indiana Pacers.</TE>
<TE>   There was last season's 80% Shaq In a Snit when he came in heavy
and fenced with Bryant ... before turning it back up to 90% Shaq in
the playoffs ... and becoming 100% Fearsome Shaq in the Finals when
the Philadelphia 76ers' Dikembe Mutombo was lucky to escape with his
life.</TE>
<TE>   This season, it has been Shaq Lite, the 70% version, overweight
with sore toes, although still a legitimate MVP candidate and, when
the mood is right, the ultimate terror weapon.</TE>
<TE>   If his current mood means anything, he isn't feeling great. He has
been grumpy and increasingly unavailable in recent weeks. Friday in
Boston, a dozen reporters, plus an ESPN camera crew, semi-circled him
before the game, but got nary a word.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, it's still a tad early in the season, as Shaq reckons
it, but his time is coming.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Faces and Figures</TE>
<TE>   Even in my role as buzzard over Clipper owner Donald T. Sterling's
head, I didn't think he'd blow it with Michael Olowokandi, which now
seems a possibility. Not that Olowokandi's vent in Utah about the
toll that contract situations take of them was appropriate, or that
he doesn't sometimes cop an attitude, but he's still a young,
happening 7-footer and the key to re-signing Elton Brand, which makes
him the linchpin to the whole deal and precious beyond description.
Thus, with career decisions coming up, there were better ways to
handle any insubordination than that absurd $50,000 fine.
Relationships have been wrecked by a lot less.... By the way, even if
Olowokandi shouldn't have said it, he was right. Other organizations
deliberately signal their players they'll take care of them. The
tone-deaf Clippers never say a word or wink an eye and with their
near-perfect history, guess what their players say amongst themselves
as soon as the outsiders leave the dressing room?</TE>
<TE>   Former NBA player David Benoit, now a Shanghai Shark, told the New
York Post that Yao Ming is "not like Shawn Bradley. He's the exact
opposite. If anything, he's more like Shaq. He's not a 7-5 stiff. He
can really move. He's got great feet." ... One of the stars of the
Portsmouth tournament for draft prospects: UCLA's Matt Barnes, who
may now even have a shot at the first round.... Generation Gap: Those
old Utah guys who thumped the Clippers, 4-0, are the same ones the
Clippers will have to get past to make the playoffs. Warming to what
could be an emerging rivalry, Jazz Coach Jerry Sloan, asked about the
Clippers' improvement, noted: "This team has had more top draft
choices than anybody in basketball. They should be a better team."</TE>
<TE>   The great unwritten story is what the Toronto Raptors really
thought about Vince Carter's lame performance, having started their
7-0 run as soon as he left. Said former Raptor Charles Oakley,
ripping General Manager Glen Grunwald: "Vince Carter's mom runs that
team. She's the GM." ... Carter, asked if he's confident teammates
believe he was hurt: "I just hope so. Everybody is entitled to their
own opinion. They might not believe me. They might." ... Count the
Cleveland Cavaliers with the Bulls and Golden State Warriors as teams
who'll shop their high draft positions, seeking established players.
Said Cavalier Coach John Lucas: "I've got to build me a team with our
young players and through the draft and do it before I get fired.
I've got six young guys having career years and that's still not good
enough." ...Jeff Van Gundy, on the false report he would coach
Chamique Holdsclaw and the WNBA Washington Mystics: "I'm all for
working with superstars. I was thinking more about Chamique O'Neal,
though."</TE>

<HD>Duncan Gets Last Shot, Last Laugh</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SAN ANTONIO</DL>
<LD>Tim Duncan's biggest contribution of the fourth quarter came when it
counted most.</LD>
<LD>   Duncan's only field goal of the fourth period was an 18-foot
jumper over Dirk Nowitzki with two seconds left to lift the San
Antonio Spurs to an 89-87 victory over the Dallas Mavericks on
Saturday in front of 34,739 at the Alamodome in a showdown of Midwest
Division leaders.</LD>
<LD>   The Spurs moved within half a game of the division-leading
Mavericks, and have an easier schedule down the stretch.</LD>
<TE>   Dallas (52-23) has seven games remaining, five against
playoff-bound teams. San Antonio (52-24) has six left, three against
teams heading to the postseason.</TE>
<TE>   Duncan led all scorers with 33 points, but scored just 11 points
in the second half.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been having some really horrible second halves lately," he
said. "That shot was huge for me."</TE>
<TE>   Nowitzki, who finished with 26 points and 21 rebounds,
second-guessed his defensive tactics on the final play.</TE>
<TE>   "I probably should have played him closer and made him drive," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   San Antonio Coach Gregg Popovich said the win was a matter of
simply hanging on as Dallas charged back from a nine-point deficit in
the last three minutes.</TE>
<TE>   "We were fortunate enough to have the ball last," Popovich said.</TE>
<TE>   Nick Van Exel led Dallas with 27 points, including 19 in the
second half.</TE>
<TE>   With 15 seconds remaining, Van Exel was fouled while shooting a
three-pointer. He made three free throws to bring Dallas within
86-85.</TE>
<TE>   Duncan made one of two free throws and Nowitzki hit a jumper that
tied the score at 87 with eight seconds remaining before Duncan hit
the game-winner.</TE>
<TE>   Dallas point guard Steve Nash, who is averaging 19 points and
eight assists, left the game at halftime with a stomach ailment.</TE>
<TE>   He was scoreless with two assists in 18 minutes.</TE>

<HD>Celebration Costs Greene in Relay Loss</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Maurice Greene pulled another surprise at the Texas Relays. In 1995,
he was an unknown who upset Carl Lewis. On Saturday, Greene was the
star who lost.</LD>
<LD>   Running his first outdoor race of 2002, the world record-holder
and 100-meter Olympic champion was overtaken by J.J. Johnson at the
finish in a 400-meter relay.</LD>
<LD>   Greene appeared to lose time by raising his hands in celebration
too soon.</LD>
<TE>   "You're supposed to run all the way through and not fool around,"
he told the crowd of 20,000 at the University of Texas at Austin. "I
took a look, threw my hand up and he came by."</TE>
<TE>   Greene anchored a relay team of Jon Drummond, Terrence Trammell
and Ken Brokenburr. Greene appeared to have a step on Johnson when he
took the baton in the final turn.</TE>
<TE>   Competing for a team that included Mickey Grimes, Gerald Williams
and Darvis Patton, Johnson kept pace and squeezed past Greene at the
line.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson's quartet finished in 38.34 seconds, 0.01 faster than
Greene's group. It's the fastest time in the world this year.</TE>
<TE>   Long Beach Poly and Long Beach Wilson dominated the relays in the
girls' high school division. Poly won the 4 x 200 relay in one
minute, 36.11 seconds to become the fourth-fastest team of all time.
The Jackrabbits also won the 4 x 400 relay in a nation-leading
3:39.80 with Wilson, the nation's second fastest team at 3:42.70,
taking second at 3:43.80. Houston Hightower won 4 x 100 relay in
46.74 with Wilson second at 46.82 and Wilson just nipped Poly for
third in the 4 x800 relay, 9:16.78 to 9:16.90.</TE>

<TE>   Grant Potulny scored on a power play 16:58 into overtime as
Minnesota beat Maine, 4-3, at St. Paul for its first NCAA hockey
title since 1979. Minnesota finished 32-8-4. Maine (26-11-7) wore
green shamrock-shaped patches on their jerseys in honor of Shawn
Walsh, the coach who died of cancer before the season began. Walsh
led the Black Bears to titles in 1993 and '99.</TE>
<TE>   The two-time defending NCAA champion UCLA women's gymnastics team
won the NCAA South Central Regional at Tempe, Ariz., with 197.425
points to qualify for the NCAA championships, along with Arizona.
Jamie Dantzscher, who won the all-around (39.7), vault (9.9, tied),
bars (9.95) and floor (9.95), was named the West Region gymnast of
the year.</TE>
<TE>   Clay Strother of Minnesota repeated as champion on the pommel
horse and floor exercise at the NCAA men's gymnastics championships
in Norman, Okla. Other winners were Marshall Erwin of Stanford on
rings and teammate Dan Gill the vault, Cody Moore of California on
parallel bars and Daniel Diaz-Luong of Michigan on the high bar.</TE>
<TE>   Washington's women had the top time, while defending champion USC
failed to qualify for the Jessop-Whittier Cup final in the Crew
Classic at San Diego. Washington, whose nine-year title run was ended
by USC last year, won the first heat in 6 minutes 44.10 seconds. The
top three crews advance in each heat. USC's women placed fifth in its
heat in 6:58.94.</TE>
<TE>   Jim Foster left Vanderbilt to coach Ohio State's women's
basketball team, ending an 11-year run with Commodores that included
10 NCAA tournament appearances.</TE>

<TE>   In an unusual move, the Green Bay Packers are allowing wide
receiver Antonio Freeman to speak with other teams about a trade, his
agent said. In a letter dated April 2, the Packers gave Freeman and
his agent, Joel Segal, permission for the seventh-year pro to visit
other clubs, undergo physical exams and talk about contract
requirements. Packer Coach Mike Sherman has said he would like to
keep Freeman, but not at his $4.3-million salary.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Seven seasons of embarrassment were finally wiped away as the New
York Islanders clinched a playoff spot Saturday night, one year after
posting the worst record in the NHL.</LD>
<LD>   Oleg Kvasha, Eric Cairns, Kenny Jonsson, Jason Blake and Michael
Peca scored in a 5-4 victory over the Washington Capitals at
Uniondale, N.Y., giving New York its first postseason berth since
1994. A sellout crowd chanted, "Playoffs, Playoffs," as New York
earned its first victory over Washington in five years.</LD>
<LD>   "Other seasons at this time, we were making travel plans for the
summer," said Jonsson, in his sixth full season with the Islanders.
"It was real frustrating, hard to focus."</LD>
<TE>   Washington rookie Nolan Yonkman, Jaromir Jagr and Glen Metropolit
scored in the third period to give the Islanders a late scare. Dmitri
Kristich had the Capitals' first goal.</TE>
<TE>   Washington, coming off a scoreless tie with Ottawa on Friday, is
fading in a fierce battle for the final playoff spot in the East. The
Capitals are now three points out of the final spot.</TE>
<TE>   That the Islanders could celebrate after playing the Capitals was
yet another remarkable feat: New York entered the game with a 22-game
winless streak (0-19-3) against Washington, longest in the NHL
between any two teams. The Islanders' previous victory against the
Capitals was March 2, 1997.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   New York Rangers 6, Boston 4--Matthew Barnaby set up a pair of
first-period goals by Petr Nedved and had an empty-net goal, helping
the Rangers boost their slim playoff hopes by defeating the Bruins at
Boston.</TE>
<TE>   Eric Lindros, Sandy McCarthy, and Martin Rucinsky also scored for
New York.</TE>
<TE>   Boston had power-play goals by Glen Murray and Brian Rolston. Bill
Guerin and Sergei Samsonov also scored for Boston.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Philadelphia 3, Pittsburgh 1--Justin Williams and Jeremy Roenick
had goals, and Roman Cechmanek made 17 saves at Philadelphia as the
Flyers ended a five-game losing streak.</TE>
<TE>   The Flyers, who won for only the second time in 10 games at home,
are three points behind Boston for the top spot in the Eastern
Conference with four games left. They are only 6-10-3 since the
beginning of March.</TE>
<TE>   Pittsburgh, which is out of the playoff race, has lost a
season-high six in a row.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Montreal 4, Columbus 1--Patrice Brisebois had a short-handed goal
and an assist, and Jose Theodore made 19 saves at Montreal as the
Canadiens extended their winning streak to five games.</TE>
<TE>   Stephane Quintal, Yanic Perreault, and Joe Juneau also scored for
Montreal as the Canadiens solidified their hold on the eighth and
final playoff spot in the Eastern Conference.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Columbus' Mike Sillinger scored with 4:24 left to ruin Theodore's
shutout bid.</TE>
<TE>   Toronto 2, Florida 2--Trevor Kidd made 46 saves for the Panthers,
who earned a tie by killing off a two-man advantage in overtime at
Toronto.</TE>
<TE>   Peter Worrell and Olli Jokinen scored for the Panthers, who were
outshot, 48-25.</TE>
<TE>   Mats Sundin had his 39th goal and Darcy Tucker his 20th for the
Maple Leafs, who are battling for home-ice advantage in the playoffs.
Toronto went one for eight on the power play.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Nashville 3, Calgary 1--Nathan Perrott made his first NHL goal a
game-winner for the Predators at Nashville.</TE>
<TE>   The victory was only Nashville's second in its last 10 home games
(2-7-1).</TE>
<TE>   Nashville's Scott Hartnell wasted little time scoring the first
goal of the game. With 91 seconds elapsed in the first period, Vitali
Yachmenev passed to Hartnell as he skated in from the right wing. His
shot beat Calgary goaltender Roman Turek.</TE>
<TE>   Calgary's Jarome Iginla scored his 49th goal.</TE>

<HD>On the Other Hand, Bonds a Good Fielder</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Barry Bonds helped the San Francisco Giants win their fifth
consecutive game with his glove, not his bat.</LD>
<LD>   Bonds made a spectacular sliding catch with the bases loaded, and
scored the go-ahead run on J.T. Snow's sixth-inning single as the San
Francisco Giants remained undefeated, defeating the San Diego Padres,
4-1, Saturday at San Francisco.</LD>
<LD>   "He's got some Gold Gloves," Giant Manager Dusty Baker said. "We
really aren't surprised by anything he does, either defensively or
with the bat."</LD>
<TE>   Bonds, who hit a record 73 home runs last season, was homerless
after hitting five in the first four games to tie Lou Brock's pace in
1967. Larry Walker hit six home runs in the first five games in 1997.</TE>
<TE>   Aaron Fultz (1-0) earned the victory in relief for the Giants, who
remain the only undefeated team in the majors. Robb Nen earned his
second save.</TE>
<TE>   San Francisco starter Kurt Ainsworth, an Olympic gold medalist
making his first career start, got into trouble in the third, loading
the bases with none out for Ryan Klesko, returning from a
season-opening suspension.</TE>
<TE>   Klesko popped up to shallow left, where Bonds sprinted before
making a dazzling sliding catch. Without missing a beat, Bonds jumped
up and hurled the ball to catcher Benito Santiago in time to catch
Padre starter Kevin Jarvis coming in from third.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   New York 11, Atlanta 2--New York scored nine runs in the ninth
inning--eight off Atlanta closer John Smoltz (0-1)--to defeat the
Braves at Atlanta.</TE>
<TE>   The Mets won at Turner Field for the second night in a row despite
losing All-Star catcher Mike Piazza because of a bruised knee in the
sixth inning. Piazza's replacement, Vance Wilson, hit a two-run
double off Smoltz in the ninth.</TE>
<TE>   Roger Cedeno drove in the go-ahead run in the ninth and Rey
Ordonez had a three-run double in the inning.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Arizona 6, Milwaukee 3--Randy Johnson defeated the Brewers for the
13th consecutive time, striking out 12 in seven innings for the
Diamondbacks at Milwaukee.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson (2-0), who is undefeated in his last 16 starts against
Milwaukee, gave up one run, five hits and three walks. He improved to
16-4 against the Brewers, who last defeated him on Aug. 5, 1992, at
old County Stadium.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   St. Louis 8, Houston 4--Albert Pujols hit his first homer of the
season and drove in three runs to lead the Cardinals for the second
game in a row at Houston.</TE>
<TE>   Matt Morris (2-0) gave up two unearned runs in six innings as he
ended a two-game losing streak to the Astros. He gave up six hits and
two walks and struck out seven.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Pittsburgh 6, Chicago 1--Josh Fogg pitched seven shutout innings
and gave up only five hits at Chicago in his first major league start
and the Pirates rolled to their fourth victory in five games.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Montreal 5, Cincinnati 2--Tomo Ohka gave up only a solo homer in
five innings and the Expos scored four runs on only one hit in the
sixth inning to win at Cincinnati.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Florida 7, Philadelphia 3--Eric Owens hit a tiebreaking RBI single
with two outs in the eighth inning and Alex Gonzalez had a three-run
homer in the ninth to lead the Marlins at Philadelphia.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For the first time in weeks, the Minnesota Timberwolves were pleased
with their play in the fourth quarter.</LD>
<LD>   Kevin Garnett had 32 points and 11 rebounds to lead the
Timberwolves to a 108-104 victory over the Phoenix Suns on Saturday
night at Minneapolis. Chauncey Billups had 19 points and 11 assists
for Minnesota. Wally Szczerbiak added 19 points.</LD>
<LD>   Shawn Marion scored 17 of his 20 points in the second half for the
Suns, who lost for the fourth time in five games.</LD>
<TE>   Stephon Marbury started the game on the bench because of a sore
left ankle, but contributed 23 points. Jake Voskuhl scored a
career-high 20 for the Suns, whose reserves outscored their starters
61-43.</TE>
<TE>   Trailing 106-102, the Suns closed the gap after Jake Tsakalidis
tipped in a missed shot with 11.1 seconds left. Then, Marion stole
Joe Smith's inbounds pass and had a chance to tie the game. But Smith
redeemed himself by blocking Marion's shot and Billups was fouled
after picking up the loose ball.</TE>
<TE>   Billups made both free throws with 7.2 seconds left to seal the
win.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Portland 113, Golden State 86--Derek Anderson scored 19 points and
Rasheed Wallace had 18 points and 13 rebounds to lead the Trail
Blazers at Portland, Ore.</TE>
<TE>   Shawn Kemp had 14 points and 10 rebounds in a reserve role for the
Trail Blazers, who remained one game behind fifth-place Minnesota in
the Western Conference playoff race.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Charlotte 93, Atlanta 86--Jamal Mashburn scored 25 points and the
Hornets overcame a poor shooting performance by Baron Davis to defeat
the Hawks at Atlanta.</TE>
<TE>   P.J. Brown had 14 points and 14 rebounds for the Hornets, who have
won eight of their last nine against Atlanta. Davis scored only five
points on two-for-15 shooting.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Washington 88, Memphis 85--Chris Whitney made two free throws with
13.4 seconds left at Washington, and Jason Williams missed two
three-pointers--including a wide-open look from the baseline at the
buzzer--as the Wizards ended a four-game losing streak.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Cleveland 120, Chicago 101--Andre Miller had 23 points and 16
assists, leading the Cavaliers past the Bulls at Cleveland.</TE>
<TE>   Miller had 14 points and four assists as the Cavaliers extended
their lead to 29 points in the third quarter.</TE>

<HD>It Would Behoove No One to Sell This Horse Short in
Kentucky</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bill Plaschke</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>He wasn't a horse, he was a "for sale" sign.</LD>
<LD>   Three times in his tender first two years, his owners futilely
peddled him on the street.</LD>
<LD>   Didn't have a name. Didn't have a buyer. Didn't have a prayer.</LD>
<TE>   At the first auction, he reared back and toppled, making him too
crazy.</TE>
<TE>   At the second auction, he was too small.</TE>
<TE>   At the third auction, he was a two-time loser.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of buyers thought if we had a horse for sale, something was
wrong with him," co-owner John Toffan said.</TE>
<TE>   In the cold business of breeding, something was indeed wrong.</TE>
<TE>   This horse didn't want to stand still for the flesh traders.</TE>
<TE>   This horse wanted to run.</TE>
<TE>   So he did Saturday, a brilliant golden flash churning up a deep
brown home stretch, charging down the middle to win the Santa Anita
Derby by 21/4 lengths, an expected victory for an unexpected
treasure.</TE>
<TE>   He is named Came Home because of what he did when nobody wanted
him.</TE>
<TE>   In a couple of weeks, that home will be a barn at Churchill Downs,
where the once-ignored colt will be the life of the feedbag at the
Kentucky Derby.</TE>
<TE>   Thirteen months ago, nobody would pay more than $145,000 for him.</TE>
<TE>   Now, you probably can't touch him for less than several million.</TE>
<TE>   "It just shows you, people who look at horses, you wonder how much
they know," said co-owner Trudy McCaffery. "You can't really measure
a horse's heart."</TE>
<TE>   And now it starts all over again, the rebukes, the questions, the
pinching, the prodding.</TE>
<TE>   Came Home flies to Kentucky in a couple of weeks carrying a heavy
legacy on a sore back.</TE>
<TE>   Three times in the last six years, a horse from the Santa Anita
Derby has won the Kentucky Derby.</TE>
<TE>   Yet this was the slowest Santa Anita Derby in 40 years, with a
winning time of 1:50.</TE>
<TE>   Six times in seven career starts, Came Home has finished first.</TE>
<TE>   Yet not once has he shown the sort of finishing strength that
would indicate he could triumph at Kentucky's 11/4-mile distance, in
his first effort at that length.</TE>
<TE>   There was some feeling that if runner-up Easy Grades had pushed
harder, he could have defeated Came Home in the final strides of
Saturday's 11/8-mile race.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd like to give [Came Home] some credit and say that he's
conserving his energy for that last furlong," jockey Chris McCarron
said after winning his second Santa Anita Derby in three years.</TE>
<TE>   In a couple of weeks, though, McCarron could be one of the only
ones giving him credit.</TE>
<TE>   We can see the headlines now.</TE>
<TE>   Came Home Late.</TE>
<TE>   Came Home Slow.</TE>
<TE>   Came Home Why?</TE>
<TE>   There will be murmurs that a pulled back muscle suffered nearly a
month ago--the reason given for his slow time Saturday--has not
properly healed.</TE>
<TE>   There will be talk that the horse just isn't big or strong enough
for the most difficult race in the world.</TE>
<TE>   And of course, somebody will ask Toffan and McCaffery ... if you
people are so smart, why did you try to sell him in the first place?</TE>
<TE>   "We always sell our best horses," said Toffan, whose minimum price
of $400,000 was never met. "It's too hard to make a living just
racing."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, after deciding they might as well throw a saddle on him,
the locally based team still sold part of Came Home.</TE>
<TE>   After he won his first three races, even.</TE>
<TE>   It was last fall, and Houston investors Will Farish and John
Goodman thought the horse had a great future.</TE>
<TE>   In stud.</TE>
<TE>   "That would be correct," Farish said Saturday with a sheepish
grin. "We were just going to let him take us as far as he could take
us."</TE>
<TE>   Who would have thought that eventually it would be further than
celebrated trainers D. Wayne Lukas and Bob Baffert, who saddled the
seventh- and eight-place finisher, respectively, in Saturday's
eight-horse race and will probably both be absent in Kentucky?</TE>
<TE>   Who would have thought it would be far enough to take McCaffery
and Toffan back to the Derby for the second time, after Free House
finished third in 1997?</TE>
<TE>   Who would have thought?</TE>
<TE>   "Somehow, we were just not meant to sell this horse," said
McCaffery.</TE>
<TE>   Just as, somehow, in 1989, an owner named Arthur Hancock was not
meant to sell a horse that he peddled twice before giving up.</TE>
<TE>   That would be Kentucky Derby winner Sunday Silence.</TE>
<TE>   And remember the horse that ran in a $62,500 claiming race only
three months before the 1999 Derby?</TE>
<TE>   A Derby that Charismatic would win?</TE>
<TE>   The speed numbers from Saturday may not look great for Came Home
in Kentucky.</TE>
<TE>   But watching 36,025 fans screaming for the neighborhood pony in
the final seconds Saturday, it became clear this is about more than
that.</TE>
<TE>   McCarron said he was worried even while steering Came Home into
the lead in the stretch.</TE>
<TE>   "I just hoping some horse didn't fly out of the clouds," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Oh, but one just did.</TE>

<LD>Treani Swain of North Hollywood Oakwood School placed second in the
girls' 800 meters in the state track and field championships last
year, but she probably won't post fast times in that event until May.</LD>
<LD>   Swain, a junior, was unable to train for most of January because
of tendinitis in her right knee and she had flu last month. So the
San Fernando Valley Invitational at Van Nuys Birmingham High on
Saturday was only her second meet of the season.</LD>
<LD>   Swain, running in the tight confines of Lane 1 on a cool and at
times breezy day, won the 400 in a hand-timed 56.4 seconds after
roaring away from the field in the final straightaway.</LD>
<TE>   "Normally, I don't run like that," Swain said of her strong
finish. "I get out well and coast the backstretch. But it would be
very difficult for me to run that way right now because I don't have
the [training background]."</TE>
<TE>   Swain's time was well off her career best of 53.71 set in 1999,
but she hasn't ruled out focusing on the 400 instead of the 800 at
the end of this season.</TE>
<TE>   "If I can get my [training] base back up to where we think it
should be, I think I can contend for the state title in the 800,"
Swain said. "If I don't [get my base up], then I'll focus on the 400
and hopefully contend for a state title in that event."</TE>
<TE>   In other events, Birmingham senior Michelle Rivera won the girls'
pole vault at 11 feet 6 inches, North Hills Monroe senior Arthur
Sulcer won the boys' 100 in 10.6 and Reseda Cleveland senior Antwine
Barfield won the boys' 110 high hurdles in 14.3.</TE>

<HD>After Inner Search, She Has Taken Control</HD>

<LD>Se Ri Pak came from South Korea and a culture where the word of the
father was final, where the daughter was to be obedient. She came to
the United States as an unworldly 20-year-old with limited command of
English and less command of life outside a golf course.</LD>
<LD>   Then Pak won two LPGA major titles in six weeks, a singular
accomplishment for a rookie of her age. Her powerful swing, her
winning smile, her unbridled enthusiasm did not need translation.
Galleries grew, TV ratings rose and all of Korea clamored to know
about Pak.</LD>
<LD>   Four years later, Pak has won only one more major and struggled
through a winless 2000 season. But winning majors is not the measure
of how much Pak has evolved or improved.</LD>
<TE>   "Se Ri is fearless," Lorie Kane said. Kane, an outgoing Canadian,
and Nancy Lopez, the LPGA Tour's greatest ambassador, have become
Pak's closest golfing friends. Kane helped Pak learn English and
introduced Pak to the Outback Steakhouse restaurant chain and to the
joys of shopping at North American malls.</TE>
<TE>   And Kane has watched Pak, 24, become a woman in charge and not an
obedient and unhappy girl.</TE>
<TE>   Pak's overpowering father is not her omnipresent traveling partner
anymore. In the last four years, Pak has fired a coach and a manager,
found herself a new caddie, a new management company, a new outlook
on golf, on life, on herself. Her career, she says, belongs to her
and not to her father, who once made Pak sleep in a graveyard to test
her mental strength. And it doesn't belong to her country, even if
she is adored and admired and is a role model to thousands of young
girls who want to be golfers like Se Ri.</TE>
<TE>   "It hasn't been easy for Se Ri," Kane said. "I went with her to
Korea last year and it's almost scary. People want to literally touch
her. And she had to make some hard decisions. She comes from a place
where it's important to obey the father. I give Se Ri so much credit
for making some of the decisions she's made."</TE>
<TE>   By 2000, Pak had gained nearly 30 pounds, was frowning instead of
smiling, became ill with exhaustion and unhappiness and ended up in a
Korean hospital where news cameramen sneaked in to film the fallen
star.</TE>
<TE>   "I had to think about so many things," Pak said of her
unsatisfactory 2000 season. "I had to come, in my mind, to decide who
would be in charge and what I wanted to be."</TE>
<TE>   What Pak decided was that she wanted to be a winner and she wanted
to do things her way.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm in charge of me now," Pak said. She smiles easily and has no
need of a translator. This "me" leads the Office Depot Championship
Hosted by Amy Alcott by three shots over Annika Sorenstam and by four
over Laura Diaz. "It will be a fun day," Pak said of playing today in
the final group with Sorenstam.</TE>
<TE>   Sorenstam, winner of eight tournaments in 2001 and two this year,
including the Kraft Nabisco, the season's first major, and Karrie
Webb have pushed themselves to a higher place than the other tour
players.</TE>
<TE>   With her performance as a rookie, Pak was supposed to be in that
place. With her maturation over the last four years, Pak will soon be
in that place. "I want to be with Annika and Karrie," Pak said after
her second consecutive round of 68 Saturday at El Caballero Country
Club in Tarzana. "I want to be the best. I am not with them yet, but
I am getting closer."</TE>
<TE>   Last year Pak won five tournaments and her third major. She found
in herself the love of the game and of the chase. She lost weight and
rediscovered her strength. When she had been in the hospital, unable
to lift her head off the pillow, Pak said she came to understand that
what had happened to her in 1998, the sudden, unexpected and
overwhelming success, the ascension to almost hallowed status in her
country, the demands that came from sponsors and her father, could
not define her.</TE>
<TE>   "I could not win every week and when I began to understand that in
my heart, I could begin to like the game and myself again," Pak said.</TE>
<TE>   Pak connects with her fans. She will pump a fist or slap her thigh
or even give a wink to the gallery after a good shot. She said she
can gain energy from the people who cheer. The fans get energy back.</TE>
<TE>   When Pak eagled the 17th Saturday, after making a double-bogey on
the same par-five hole Friday, she jumped and the fans howled with
happiness. There was an enthusiasm from both golfer and fan that is
too often absent on the tour.</TE>
<TE>   "I love what I am doing now," Pak said. "I am happier and happier.
I am working harder and harder. Maybe I didn't know what would happen
when I won so much and I was so young.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe I didn't understand what the pressure would feel like. No
female athlete in Korea had ever become popular like I was in 1998
and maybe it was overwhelming. But I have it inside me to want to be
the best and that is still my goal and always my goal."</TE>
<TE>   Said Kane: "It was not an easy thing for her to branch out on her
own, to take over her life. She did it with her whole country
watching and criticizing. And she's made it work."</TE>

<LD>I was trying to have a civil conversation with the wife about the
lack of babes on the LPGA Tour, and the tour's attempts to introduce
sex to their dull game, and I swear, I hadn't mentioned the lack of
jiggle on the links--yet--and she just snapped.</LD>
<LD>   "This is all about Cro-Magnon man having his tongue out," she
said.</LD>
<LD>   Now I've been to a few LPGA tournaments in my day and I can tell
you there are women out there who look as if they'd be delighted to
remove the tongue from some men, but I don't think the wife was
talking about the LPGA galleries.</LD>
<TE>   "From what you're telling me, the LPGA is just trying to make men
drool," she said. "Sex belongs in the bedroom, or somewhere in the
house."</TE>
<TE>   I probably shouldn't have stopped the car and made such a big deal
about putting that idea of "somewhere in the house" in writing,
because suddenly the conversation shifted to "some time in your
lifetime."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A DAY later when the wife was speaking to me again, I was just
kidding when I said the LPGA ought to stop all this nonsense about
getting attention and just announce that Annika Sorenstam will be
teeing off topless today at 8:05 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   "No one would forget to turn the clock ahead an hour," I said, and
I was just trying to lighten the mood, but this whole LPGA business
of adding sex appeal to the game had the wife mocking me--as if I'd
watch women's golf just because Lisa Guerrero was lining up a putt.</TE>
<TE>   "What's wrong with being just a pretty woman?" the wife said.</TE>
<TE>   "I loved Julia Roberts in 'Pretty Woman,'" I said. "She made a
very appealing hooker. In fact, I would think if they had a Hooker's
Tour the galleries would be huge."</TE>
<TE>   For some reason the wife was getting the idea this emphasis on sex
was being done just to attract the male audience. But I think it's
pretty well accepted in golfing circles the LPGA appeals in a large
part to fans of Rosie O'Donnell, and putting Rosie in a tank top and
short shorts probably isn't going to do it for most men.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   JUST IN case I had it wrong, I went to the El Caballero Country
Club in Tarzana on Saturday to check out the LPGA tournament. It's a
good thing, too, because ESPN2 cut away from televising the event
with tournament leader Se Ri Pak putting on No. 18 and 69 other
golfers on the course to show the Women's Fitness America Pageant.
You've got to give the people what they want.</TE>
<TE>   I'm not sure, but on one of those days when his arthritis isn't
acting up, I think Dwyre could beat most of these women, so the golf
is pretty much unwatchable.</TE>
<TE>   But that's all right, I was here to see just how far the LPGA was
willing to go when it came to sex. When I checked into the media
room, someone immediately took me to the side and pointed to the
scoreboard. "Just like in the PGA tournaments," she whispered, "a
title is placed above that board every day. Today's 'Moving Day,'
while the first day is always 'Coming Out Day.' The LPGA didn't like
that, and made them take it down Friday. They suggested, 'Here We
Go,' instead."</TE>
<TE>   I wonder what they had against "Coming Out Day"? I made it clear I
was coming out today, and they didn't lock the doors.</TE>
<TE>   Apparently there are a number of things I don't understand about
the LPGA. I was told the tour has a five-point plan to get more
attention, which includes making players approachable. I asked golfer
Laura Diaz a question at a news conference, and she said she had no
time to talk and walked off.</TE>
<TE>   I asked LPGA senior media relations director Neil Reid to put me
in touch with Jan Butterfield, the women's skin care, hair and
fashion consultant, and I never heard from him again until the end of
the day when he said Diaz wanted to know if I wanted to talk to her
on the phone.</TE>
<TE>   Knowing the LPGA's interest in sex these days, I presumed it was
going to be one of those 900 or 976 calls, so I declined. They are so
difficult to get approved when you put them on your expense report.</TE>
<TE>   Instead I talked to seven fans, making it the first time I've ever
spoke to half of the crowd in attendance at a professional sporting
event. "Some of these women need some work on the way they dress,"
said John H.</TE>
<TE>   "We were watching on TV last week," Marian H. said, "and there was
this one girl with a red top stretched real tight, who was
well-endowed, too. Her belly was showing and her pants were tight."</TE>
<TE>   I spent the next three hours looking for a golfer here who looked
anything like that, but came up flat. I suppose I could have asked
the LPGA senior media relations director, but I felt uncomfortable
trying to wake him up.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I DID find five skinny models showing a lot of skin by the main
scoreboard, and because I'm a paid observer I took note of every
change of clothes from the cocktail dresses to the swimming wraps to
the evening gowns.</TE>
<TE>   I noticed a guy gawking at the models, surprised to find the
gawker was Mark Warholy, a Times employee from our San Fernando
Valley office.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm just wondering what it would be like to take a test drive,"
he said, and I thought that was pretty crude of him. But then I
noticed the new car on display behind the models, and I guess if the
LPGA really wants to attract the guys, it should have the golfers
driving from hole to hole in new hot rods--with tinted windows.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   TODAY'S LAST word comes in an e-mail from Thomas F.:</TE>
<TE>   "Hey, Buster, what are you going to do when the Dodgers really
show you, and start hitting and pitching and win it all?"</TE>
<TE>   Probably celebrate my 103rd birthday.</TE>

<LD>With several veterans sidelined by minor injuries, the USC football
team expected to use Saturday morning's scrimmage at the Coliseum to
showcase reserves and younger players.</LD>
<LD>   As it turned out, familiarity was the theme of the day.</LD>
<LD>   Familiar names such as quarterback Carson Palmer and tailback
Sultan McCullough. And an offense that appeared more familiar with
its playbook than at this time last year, when Palmer and the others
were just getting acquainted with coordinator Norm Chow.</LD>
<TE>   "No one's guessing anymore," tight end Alex Holmes said. "We know
where to go."</TE>
<TE>   Palmer completed 12 of 15 passes for 137 yards, turning to Holmes
and Keary Colbert because leading receiver Kareem Kelly was nursing a
sore leg.</TE>
<TE>   McCullough carried 13 times for 42 yards even without starting
tackle Jacob Rogers, who sprained his knee this week. Reserve Darryl
Poston looked stronger, carrying 11 times for 86 yards. Chad Pierson
scored on three short runs.</TE>
<TE>   "That's key," Chow said. "High efficiency [passing] and being able
to run the ball."</TE>
<TE>   Barely three months removed from a dismal performance against Utah
in the Las Vegas Bowl, the offense needs to develop consistency this
off-season.</TE>
<TE>   So it was surprising the defense struggled to stop the ball
Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   The Trojans got steady performances from safeties Troy Polamalu
and DeShaun Hill, who combined for 13 tackles, and lineman Shaun
Cody, who had three sacks. Melvin Simmons, a transfer linebacker from
Washington State who sat out last season, also played well.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Coach Pete Carroll was disappointed. He talked about having
to replace several starters from last fall--including both
cornerbacks--and a lack of depth.</TE>
<TE>   It doesn't help that two key reserves, linebacker Chris Prosser
and defensive back John Walker, are ineligible because they dropped
classes and are not carrying enough units. They can make up for the
deficiency in summer school.</TE>
<TE>   Until then, Simmons figures the defense will improve with two more
weeks of spring practice.</TE>
<TE>   "It's definitely about feeling comfortable," Simmons said.</TE>

<HD>Wooden Headed to Early Choice</HD>
<DH>College basketball: Williams favored to win, despite
pressure from tournament standouts.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBYN NORWOOD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jason Williams of Duke has been the overwhelming choice for college
basketball's player-of-the-year awards, but the announcement of the
Wooden Award winner today holds a tiny bit of intrigue.</LD>
<LD>   That's because voting didn't end until March 25--four days after
Williams missed a free throw with four seconds left in Duke's
regional semifinal loss to Indiana, and one day after Drew Gooden of
Kansas and Juan Dixon of Maryland carried their teams to the Final
Four.</LD>
<LD>   "It's going to be interesting," said Duke Llewellyn, founder of
the Los Angeles Athletic Club award that has honored the top player
since 1977.</LD>
<TE>   In contrast to the Associated Press player-of-the-year award, for
which voting is complete before the NCAA tournament begins, the
Wooden Award seeks to include the tournament--but without becoming
simply a Final Four most valuable player honor.</TE>
<TE>   "We thought we'd like to have it cover the entire
season--preseason, conference play and tournament play," Llewellyn
said. "It was my feeling too many award decisions were being made at
the end of conference play."</TE>
<TE>   Williams, a junior guard who is entering the NBA draft, remains
the favorite--particularly because many of the 1,000 voters submit
their ballots by mail, and those had to be postmarked by March 19,
after the first and second rounds.</TE>
<TE>   Votes submitted over the Internet could be filed as late as the
Monday before the Final Four--but only 30% of votes were submitted
the final weekend, meaning 70% voted before Duke lost.</TE>
<TE>   Williams averaged almost 22 points and five assists a game and has
won every player-of-the-year award--though he shared the National
Assn. of Basketball Coaches award with Gooden, a junior who averaged
21 points and 11 rebounds a game for the Jayhawks and is weighing
whether to turn pro.</TE>
<TE>   Dixon, a senior guard, averaged 19 points and three assists.</TE>
<TE>   He upset Williams for Atlantic Coast Conference player of the year
and was named most outstanding player of the Final Four after leading
Maryland to its first NCAA title--after the Wooden voting was over.</TE>
<TE>   In 1988, Kansas' Danny Manning surged past Bradley's Hersey
Hawkins to win the award in late voting that ended after Manning led
Kansas to the NCAA title.</TE>
<TE>   The question this year is whether Williams' lead was
insurmountable.</TE>
<TE>   Cincinnati's Steve Logan and Gonzaga's Dan Dickau are the other
finalists invited to the ceremony at the Los Angeles Athletic Club,
which will be televised nationally on Fox Sports Net.</TE>
<TE>   Denny Crum, a former Wooden assistant at UCLA who led Louisville
to national championships in 1980 and '86 before retiring last year,
will receive the "Legends of Coaching" award.</TE>

<LD>Patrick J. Kiger's ruminations on the '80s brought back wonderful
memories ("Moonwalk Down Memory Lane," March 3). My wife and I consider
the '80s to be "our era" and have been waiting for a revival for years!
The mention of L.A. Gear shoes brought back the strongest feelings. While
living in England, we found a local shoe store that ordered them for us.
I was so proud, strutting around in my white-and-blue basketball-style
trainers, thinking everyone must be green with envy, when, in reality, I
was probably the only person in the town who knew what they were! But
that didn't matter--I had L.A. Gear and I was cool!</LD>

<TE>   Kiger's account is lacking in one important fact. The discovery of HIV
and the subsequent AIDS epidemic profoundly altered the attitudes of
Americans toward sexuality, drug use, morality, illness and life itself.
Does Kiger really expect us to believe that mullets and Madonna
influenced our culture more than the rise of AIDS? It is a tragic irony
that he fails to mention the epidemic once in his recounting of the
decade in which thousands were infected and died because America was
afraid to talk about it until it was too late. If we are doomed to repeat
that period of our history, let us hope that we have learned something
from the awful price that was paid.</TE>

<LD>Many readers have asked about the outcome of a parole hearing for
Joseph Luna, a California prison inmate featured in a March 3 article
("Taking a Life," by Fred Dickey) that voiced doubts about his 1985
murder conviction. The hearing, scheduled for early March, was postponed
for three months at the request of Luna's attorney, who sought more time
to explore developments in the case.</LD>

<LD>I am writing to object to the gratuitous insult of our organization
in the March 3 magazine. Phil Barber ("Pop Culture," Entertaining) wrote:
"Popcorn got a bad rap in 1994, when those old maids at the Center for
Science in the Public Interest revealed that cinema popcorn cooked in
coconut oil contained as much as 80 grams of fat per tub, sans butter."
Why denigrate us as "old maids"? First, it's not true. We're probably a
lot like you and your staff: young to middle-aged professional men and
women with families and children. Second, you're not disputing what we
said about popcorn. Why, then, insult us? Would you like your staff
dismissed in print as "old spinsters" or "old fogies" for no apparent
reason? It's sloppy thinking, writing and editing.</LD>

<LD>I have been a subscriber for more than 12 years and had all but
given up on the Sunday magazine containing anything more than fuzzy
"artsy" photos of strange clothes on not very attractive models. But lo
and behold! There was a genuinely interesting and well-written article
about car designer Freeman Thomas by Preston Lerner ("The Quest for
Cool," March 3)! I guess I'll have to keep looking through the
magazine--you never know when I might be surprised again.</LD>

with no center seam in back. "Like a fine sculptor, I craft each
individual canvas by hand, cutting each piece to the anatomy, not the
size of the customer," boasts the maestro, 75. For reference, he consults
a 1932 anatomy treatise complete with skeletal diagrams.</LD>
<LD>   "Nothing fits like a Gasbarri suit," says Mark Rosner, a screenwriter
on "The Rock" and other films. Rosner got hooked after his first Gasbarri
original. "I have a closet full of them. My wife said, 'You have to cut
this out.' " Rosner also owns vintage Gasbarri: "I have his personal
topcoat that he made for himself and which he talked me into buying," he
says. "It's a double-breasted herringbone coat with a belt in back, from
1951 or '52. It's Clark Gable-style, right out of another era."</LD>
<TE>   Gasbarri started as a tailor's apprentice at age 8 in his hometown of
Pacentro, Italy.</TE>
<TE>   "After World War II, I moved to Rome to finish my profession," he
says. "I went to school but I didn't like it." He built a clientele among
American diplomats who later helped him immigrate to America in 1958. At
first, he worked in Georgetown, dressing "lots of people during the time
of Eisenhower. I was very popular." He moved his family to California
"for the Italian climate," and worked for tailor Albert Mariani of
Beverly Hills on Rodeo Drive. "After two years I opened my shop here on
Vine," Gasbarri says.</TE>
<TE>   He quickly became sought after by Hollywood's elite, including film
actress  Mary Pickford, who he says sent him a bottle of Dom Perignon by
limousine to show her gratitude for the suits Gasbarri created for her
husband, Charles "Buddy" Rogers. Other smart dressers Gasbarri clothed
include Guy Williams, Red Skelton and Aldo Ray. His favorite client is
Kirk Douglas, who jokingly threatened to "send him back to Roma" if his
suit didn't fit. Scenes from "Spartacus," Gasbarri's favorite film, are
painted on the walls of his shop, which are lined with autographed photos
of luminaries such as Bob Crane, John Saxon, Merv Griffin, Lee Majors,
Marty Robbins and a clean-shaven Willie Nelson, circa 1963. Steve McQueen
was another customer. "He takes my coat to London's Savile Row and asks
for duplication," Gasbarri says of McQueen. "They told him they couldn't
do it."</TE>
<TE>   Actor David Starzyk believes that Gasbarri's suits have landed him
roles. "When I walk into an audition, I'm usually the best-dressed guy in
the room," says Starzyk, who has appeared on the TV shows "NYPD Blue" and
"The Practice." A tailor on one TV set was so impressed with Gasbarri's
workmanship that he suggested Starzyk buy 10 more suits. "I feel like
Cary Grant in Gasbarri's suits," the actor says. "They don't make them
like this anymore."</TE>
<TE>   Gasbarri will tell you his handiwork is a bargain. "If you buy in
Beverly Hills, it's $5,000 and up. From Gasbarri, it's $2,000 and up.
American people need a good high quality [suit] at a good price."</TE>
<TE>   His business comes mostly from regulars, but new customers receive a
flier headed "A message from Gasbarri for gentiluomo," explaining how his
work differs from mass-produced ready-mades. "Hollywood used to dictate
fashion, but not in the last 25 years," he says. "You want to find a good
tailor, go to the cemetery."</TE>

<HD>Well-Suited to His Profession</HD>
<DH>An Image Consultant Takes on the Fashion Faux Pas</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL T. JARVIS</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Martin Kedzior became a men's style consultant by accident. Seven
years ago, the former ad industry employee offered fashion input to
"someone who needed it badly." Word got around, and he's been an
independent image consultant since. Kedzior, 30, specializes in corporate
executive wear, and a number of Southern California hotels refer their
sartorially impaired guests to him. A frugal classicist about fashion
choices, Kedzior's emphasis can be summed up in one word: simplicity--and
plenty of it.</LD>
<LD>   Are your skills really that needed in L.A.?</LD>
<LD>   I come from Chicago, where people wear suits. They're  not used to it
out here. Most people don't know how to buy a sport coat. Some guys want
to wear suspenders with belts. There's a whole '80s thing going on with
agents with coats that look like they have shoulder pads.</LD>
<TE>   Why would a man pay someone to pick his clothes?</TE>
<TE>   Confidence is directly linked to the way one feels. I have  a client
who's an attorney, and his strong suit is law,  not Levi's. If someone
recognizes they're making the wrong choices, I'm a good investment. I do
the legwork and make it easy.</TE>
<TE>   But can't a guy just wear the corporate "uniform"?</TE>
<TE>   Relaxed work environments [are] forcing individuality  to become more
apparent. The past uniform--white shirt, a red-striped tie and a blue
suit--is becoming  uncommon, unless you're a flight attendant.</TE>
<TE>   How do you choose a client's wardrobe?</TE>
<TE>   It depends on the lifestyle and income bracket. An executive who flies
in a corporate jet will need clothing for multiple events and traveling.
The writer might need clothing for knocking around town and dinner
parties in Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   What are men's biggest fashion faux pas?</TE>
<TE>   A non-vented suit or sport coat with pleated pants. Also, ill-fitted
clothes and bad shoes. Good shoes and well-fitting clothing go a lot
further than a designer label. Most men wear button-down shirts with too
much fabric in the body. Or they're wearing a shirt where their stomach
is busting through the buttons. Lots of L.A. people don't dress their
age.</TE>
<TE>   Other appalling bloopers?</TE>
<TE>   Thin ties with wimpy knots. Ties should only graze the top portion of
the pants--it's not meant to cover the zipper. The label on the back of
the tie is not intended to hold the thin part of the tie, and 99% of
Americans are not aware of this. A chunky heel or too thick of a rubber
on any  part of a shoe combined with hints of Naugahyde are immediate red
flags. Or an overload of synthetic fibers on any item. A lot of Prada's
stuff is synthetic and looks like a plastic bag.</TE>
<TE>   What are today's ultimate "power" accessories?</TE>
<TE>   To me, the perceived status power watch is an antique Rolex, the
Cartier Pasha with leather strap, or any Franck Muller model other than
the entry-level "Casablanca." But I'm equally impressed with the $55 L.L.
Bean classic, which I bought my first year in college. The power shoe  is
the John Lobb Delano Havana Calf, single buckle.</TE>
<TE>   Should anyone want to impress me with a gift, a 101/2  will do just
fine.</TE>
<TE>   What would you like to see back in vogue?</TE>
<TE>   Pocket watches. They're cool conversation pieces and  can add a sense
of history.</TE>
<TE>   Where do you stand on the "corporate casual" question?</TE>
<TE>   The problem is, most people don't know what "business casual" means.
"Casual" is not another word for clothes you wear around the house. It
means relaxed clothing that you would wear at a stylish bistro. It means
if you're fat, no jeans for you. An AC-DC T-shirt from Fred Segal studded
with rhinestones is not corporate casual.</TE>
<TE>   Can a man care about fashion and still be a guy's guy?</TE>
<TE>   A guy's guy is usually interpreted as a dude. But I know just as many
dudes who are as concerned about their image as the Botox-beaten
has-beens from the '80s are.</TE>

<LD>Founded in 1880 for L.A.'s "best young men," the Los Angeles
Athletic Club downtown was the city's first private club and the first
building in Southern California with a swimming pool on an upper floor.
Women have been able to use the 12-story facility since 1914, except for
the cavernous men's locker room, of course. After a hard day's work, the
inner sanctum, which includes wet and dry steam baths, whirlpools,
showers and a relaxation area, may be a man's last refuge.</LD>
<TE>James Kawahara 38, federal Indian law attorney, Manhattan Beach</TE>
<TE>   How was your day?</TE>
<TE>   I was on the phone with clients and colleagues. I did legal research,
drafted memos.</TE>
<TE>   What does your job say  about you?</TE>
<TE>   I solve problems. I'm helping  people. My clients are Native
Americans, and I defend their rights and treaties. That's why  I went
into law. I'm Native  American and Japanese.</TE>
<TE>   What steams you at work?</TE>
<TE>   The opposition not telling the truth. Arrogance.</TE>
<TE>   How much of this is really  about exercise?</TE>
<TE>   You won't find the chairmen of many Indian tribes here, but I wouldn't
mind meeting some board chairmen.</TE>
<TE>   What do guys really talk about  in here?</TE>
<TE>   Women, work, other people's jobs.</TE>
<TE>   What qualifies as male bonding?</TE>
<TE>   Our basketball team lost every game. That's bonding.</TE>
<TE>   What is not male bonding?</TE>
<TE>   Watching "Sex and the City"  together.</TE>
<TE>   Is it really a man's world?</TE>
<TE>   Men are figureheads. But  sometimes it's good to be  the figurehead.</TE>
<TE>Arto Donikian  35, diamond dealer, Rancho Palos Verdes</TE>
<TE>   How was your day?</TE>
<TE>   I have about 500 active accounts. I'm on the phone a lot.</TE>

<TE>   What steams you at work?</TE>
<TE>   Late payments, receivables.</TE>
<TE>   How much of this is really about exercise?</TE>
<TE>   It's about 40% socializing. This place has character and history.</TE>
<TE>   What do guys really talk about in here?</TE>
<TE>   Business gossip, stock trading.</TE>
<TE>   What qualifies as male bonding?</TE>
<TE>   They offer a white-water rafting trip here at the club. It's just  the
boys.</TE>
<TE>   What is not male bonding?</TE>
<TE>   I hate shopping at malls.</TE>
<TE>   Is it really a man's world?</TE>
<TE>   I don't think so. You definitely see the influence of females in the
last decades.</TE>
<TE>Bob Arranaga  44, restaurant supply owner, Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   How was your day?</TE>
<TE>   I was up by 4:30 a.m. I was on the phone all morning and worked with
the sales staff.</TE>

<TE>   What steams you at work?</TE>
<TE>   Do you have 20 pages?</TE>
<TE>   How much of this is really about exercise?</TE>
<TE>   This is my oasis. It's 12 floors of therapy.</TE>
<TE>   What do guys really talk  about in here?</TE>
<TE>   Current events, sports. City  politics. That's one hot subject.</TE>
<TE>   What qualifies as male bonding?</TE>

<TE>   Sharing a six-pack in front of the TV watching the Home  Shopping
Network!</TE>
<TE>   Is it really a man's world?</TE>

it.</TE>
<TE>Steven Myers, 40, mortgage broker, Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   How was your day?</TE>
<TE>   I worked! I had escrow signings. I previewed some deals. I made a lot

<TE>   Mostly sports. I play in the basketball league. We're two-time
champions. We talk trash.</TE>
<TE>   What qualifies as male</TE>
<TE>   bonding? It's several men sitting around in a steam room or whirlpool
buck naked.</TE>
<TE>   Is it really a man's world?</TE>
<TE>   I wouldn't say that. We need women, too.</TE>

<LD>Seven years ago, chatting with an Orthodox Jewish friend, Sal
Rovero mentioned that his father was in the hat business. His friend,
tired of ordering from New York, suggested that Rovero start selling the
black, wide-brimmed Old World-style hats favored by Orthodox men. Rovero
ordered three dozen on credit from the Italian maker Borsalino and rented
a small second-floor space on La Brea Avenue near Beverly Boulevard. "I
had two things going for me there. Downstairs was a kosher pizza place
and next door was a shaatnez lab [for inspecting Orthodox men's suits;
biblical law prohibits mixing linen and wool in one garment]," says
Rovero, who comes from a Mexican Jewish family and grew up in East L.A.
and the San Fernando Valley.</LD>
<LD>   Two years later, Rovero moved Hollywood Hatters into a nearby suit
store catering to the Orthodox community. By then, he also carried
cashmere baseball caps, cowboy hats, fedoras, Panamas and newsboy hats.
His clientele diversified as well. Along with the Orthodox shoppers came
"Hispanics, gypsies, black gentlemen, women. Black gentlemen and Jewish
rabbis would be complimenting each other because of a mutual love of hats
in both communities."</LD>
<TE>   The store recently moved to a Melrose Avenue storefront not far from a
Jewish day school, an advantage since bar mitzvahs are Rovero's "bread
and butter." He also gets Melrose hipsters and stylists; his hats have
been worn by names such as Eminem, Dr. Dre and Sean "Puffy" Combs (red
derby, red derby, black fedora respectively).</TE>
<TE>   "It used to be you were half naked if you walked out without wearing a
hat," muses Rovero, who says hatters trace a postwar trade decline to
JFK, who was sworn in bareheaded. But things are, er, looking up. Not
only is the Orthodox community booming, "I think what's bringing hats
back is celebrity, especially in music. I've been in business seven
years, my father and uncle 20-some years. Right now they're more popular
than ever."</TE>

<LD>Contrary to the beliefs of some women, men's shoes are not all
alike--and neither are their footwear preferences. Men might not have
Manolos (yet), but be it Orange County, the Eastside or Beverly Hills,
there's a world of  variety when it comes to boots, Oxfords, loafers,
trainers and the men who buy them. We wore out some shoe leather tracking
down area bestsellers.</LD>
<TE>Neiman Marcus, Beverly Hills: Tod's Moccasin, $325 and up</TE>
<TE>   "This is like a classic moccasin with a rubber sole. We have a variety
of colors, but black is the most popular.</TE>
<TE>   It can be paired beautifully with anything Loro Piana,  as well as
Zegna. It's a man, average age 35, who's  buying these. It's classic,
dressy casual."</TE>
<TE>   --Parool  Campbell, director of public relations</TE>
<TE>Zapateria Banda, Compton: Marquez de Leon Snake Ankle Boot, $150</TE>
<TE>   "It's a short, pointy boot with a zipper on the side. It's  authentic
snake, kind of white and brown. You can feel the little scales. People
from Mexico buy them. Some might be poor, but they save up for those
boots. And some of  the African Americans in our area have horses, so
they  wear boots."</TE>
<TE>   --Margie Duron,  landlady</TE>
<TE>Silver Feet, South Coast Plaza: Prada Sport America's Cup, $290</TE>
<TE>   "This is a rubber-soled lace-up shoe, part leather and  part mesh, so
the shoe breathes. It's like a casual sport shoe, a step up from Nike. It
comes in [solid] black or green; [and] bone, red or blue with silver
mesh. Men from 20 to 50 are buying it. It's comfortable. And it's a
quality shoe."</TE>
<TE>   --Richard Valenciano, assistant manager</TE>
<TE>Industrial Safety Shoe Co., Huntington Park: Hy-Test Footrest, $139
and up</TE>
<TE>   "This is a black boot with a plain toe, and it has a green line on the
sole. The sole is polyurethane. Everything  else wears out faster. The
leather is kidskin. Pretty much everybody buys it. We deal with companies
from  Boeing [and] Raytheon to places where they work in warehouses."</TE>
<TE>   --Omar Lopez, manager</TE>
<TE>Paul Owen Shoes, Baldwin Hills: Marco Vicci Ankle Boot, $99.99</TE>
<TE>   "Young teenagers to older people are buying it. They can wear it with
jeans or dress it up. It has an alligator print, an inside ankle zipper
and a nice walking heel. It comes in black, burgundy and brown. Men today
are getting very involved with colors."</TE>
<TE>   --Fred Guzman, manager</TE>
<TE>Sportie L.A., Los Angeles: Nike Air Force II, $75 to $135</TE>
<TE>   "The color is red, white and blue. Everyone's looking for these shoes.
It's a leather high-top, retro from the '70s. They remake them now. It's
the second version of the Air Force. Young people from their 20s to 40s
usually wear it. It runs between $75 and $135. It's hard to get, so the
prices go up."</TE>
<TE>   --Eli Amzaleg, owner</TE>
<TE>Barneys New York, Beverly Hills: Prada Main Line Spazzalato, $330</TE>
<TE>   "This is a black loafer with a rubber sole and a banded vamp. It has a
semi-square toe. You can wear it with  jeans or a suit. Our fashion
customer is buying it--the guy who's buying Gucci, Jil Sander suits,
Prada suits. Not the Armani customer."</TE>

<TE>Country General Store, Van Nuys: Tony Lama Caiman Hornback
Alligator Boot, $599</TE>
<TE>   "This is a traditional cowboy boot. The foot is made of Caiman
alligator. These boots have little bumps, like  little horns, all over.
My customers go for that macho  look. We have a lot of the
professional-type person  who wears them with a three-piece suit,
attorneys  who wear them to court or with faded blue jeans.</TE>

<LD>We live in a land known for its excesses of freedom, but that
doesn't mean it's easy to describe the look of the Southern  California
man. The way he dresses depends on what he does, where he lives and his
self-perception. In the article below, we assess the impact of Casual
Friday in the land of the laid-back. Elsewhere in this issue, Laker
forward Rick Fox talks about style--and basketball. Plus, we share
secrets of the watch- obsessed and offer up a few thoughts on accessories
for guys.</LD>
<LD>   The birth of Casual Friday seemed so innocent. The first signs of the
trend appeared in the early '90s--decades after the Man in the Gray
Flannel Suit had become, by popular agreement, a symbol of all that was
rigid and wrong with American masculine aspiration.</LD>
<TE>   The old economy of corporate America began to look longingly at
entrepreneurial America and its minions, increasingly awash in what
appeared to be money. They looked at their own boardrooms and
gray-paneled fattening pens and gray-paneled workforce--which was being
lured to the new economy not only by what appeared to be barrels of
money, but also by an atmosphere (and dress code) reminiscent of a
Montessori pre-primary class--and gradually began loosening their
collars. Then, on Sept. 26, 1997, the New York Stock Exchange decreed a
day of freedom--the first day in 205 years to have allowed informal dress
on the trading floor--to be known henceforth as Casual Friday. From Wall
Street to Wilshire Boulevard, the mandate was to dress down--for better
or for worse.</TE>
<TE>   But who knew that this fashion Zeitgeist would have so profound an
effect on the American male? Talk to the movers and shakers in fashion
retailing and the men who keep them in business, and you can come away
with the impression that nothing--not the Women's Movement, the Green
Party, Iron John--has had as dramatic an impact on men as the seemingly
innocuous words, Casual Friday. Consider, for instance, the tone of the
recent pullback at Lehman Brothers. The New York-based financial
powerhouse recently canceled its Casual Friday policy, citing the need
for a return to tradition and stability in these uncertain times. In
other words, in the face of a national crisis, a guy's just gotta feel
more comfortable, more sure of his place in the world, in a three-button
wool number with French cuffs and some Allen Edwards lace-ups.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps clothes really do make the man.</TE>
<TE>   So what are we to think of the Southern California man, denizen of a
place reviled worldwide for its excesses of freedom? It depends on whom
you ask. How we dress in the Southland, and the choices we make, have as
much to do with our jobs as how we perceive ourselves, from our
upbringing to our current milieu and class--in the Marxist sense of the
word.</TE>
<TE>   It also depends on what side of town you live on.</TE>
<TE>   David Geffen and Steven Spielberg's uniform of jeans, T-shirts and
baseball caps may signal power in Hollywood on any day of the week--as in
"I don't have to dress up, I'm important no matter what I wear." But in
the rest of town, the Friday dress code is still up for grabs. Is it
enough to merely signal you know what you're doing rather than actually
dress to impress? For 29-year-old Diallo Marvel, an art director at the
advertising firm TBWA/Chiat /Day in Los Angeles, success is signaled
subtly.</TE>
<TE>   It's a typical Friday in the office. Interrupted mid-meeting, Marvel
is wearing a pair of vintage Pumas, Abercrombie &amp; Fitch jeans, "baggy,
but not bunchy at the bottom," and a white T-shirt under a blue
button-down. One attendee is shoeless.</TE>
<TE>   "Creative people are not held to the same standard as corporate," he
explains. "Clients want creatives to use their brains. Clothes aren't
what they expect you to think about."</TE>
<TE>   Here, what plays on a Friday is no different from the rest of the
workweek. But the dressed-down men at TBWA/Chiat/Day have learned a
lesson women have known for years, one we'll call the Lesson of the
Birkin bag. Available (at times) at Hermes, the Birkin bag is a large,
stitched-leather tote. It costs $5,000, when you can get one, since
there's an 18-month waiting list. It looks smashing with jeans and a
T-shirt, telling the world on behalf of the carrier: "I may be wearing
jeans, but mistake me for some middle-class Hausfrau at your peril." The
message is pure L.A.</TE>
<TE>   And there you have it, gentlemen. Throw a Yamamoto shirt over those
ratty jeans, or slap a Rolex on that wrist with your old Trojans T, or
some Tod's loafers under those sweatpants, and voila! You've sent a
message no three-piece suit can deliver.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of creatives wear really nice shoes or a really nice shirt,"
Marvel says. "They'll wear one fashionable and high-end item that says,
'I'm fashionable, but I'm not gonna scream it.' "</TE>
<TE>   Just don't try anything funny on Fridays at Washington Mutual in Los
Angeles. At least not if you work in Peter Villegas' office.</TE>
<TE>   Villegas, 34, a vice president at Washington Mutual overseeing
corporate affairs and government relations, characterizes himself as
strictly "old school." "I work with public officials, philanthropies,
community organizations, and I'm a lobbyist," explains Villegas, who
favors suits from Hugo Boss, Joseph Abboud and Armani and Cole Haan
shoes.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't afford to be too casual because I'm representing the company
at a corporate level," he says.</TE>
<TE>   While other branches of his company observe Casual Fridays, Villegas
himself resists. "In our office we have a lot of high-profile people
coming in. We can't afford to have clients come in looking at employees
in jeans and flip-flops."</TE>
<TE>   Doug Ewert, executive vice president of merchandising and general
merchandise manager for the Men's Wearhouse, says his company--which has
made a fortune selling $199 to $499 suits--has carved a lucrative niche
servicing the guy who hasn't yet mastered the art of corporate casual.
And with more than 500 stores nationwide and reported sales of $1.27
billion last year, that's a lot of guys.</TE>
<TE>   But the chain is branching out. "We're synonymous with suits" he
explains. "Seven years ago, we didn't really carry sportswear. We were
testing it, but it's since become a very important part of our market."
He describes the Men's Wearhouse Casual Friday look as mixing elements
from a tailored wardrobe with sportswear separates. "You might be wearing
a suit, but you add a fine-gauge merino knit sweater or substitute a
leather jacket."</TE>
<TE>   For the fashion uninitiated, "sportswear" is not to be confused with
"athletic wear." While the latter includes printed basketball jerseys and
high-tech sneakers, "sportswear" is more akin to what you might see Kevin
Costner wearing when he's being interviewed on "Entertaiment Tonight"
about his new movie. Sportswear consists of "select, key items that are
really versatile and work well," observes Ewert. Items such as silk and
cotton mock turtlenecks woven with a fine-gauge fiber that are
comfortable under a sport coat.</TE>
<TE>   Esquire's fashion/creative director Stefano Tonchi agrees with Ewert
on the basic problem posed by Casual Friday. "People get very worried
about what to wear, especially men who are so used to wearing a uniform,"
Tonchi says. "To have to wake up and think about what to wear--do I have
the right outfit?--it's kind of destructive somehow," he says. "Most
people don't want to confess their taste level."</TE>
<TE>   Which is why the Men's Wearhouse and other stores have done such a
booming business in sportswear by helping the average guy hide his taste,
or improve it, depending on your interpretation.</TE>
<TE>   Tonchi feels one of the reasons the whole Casual Friday phenomenon
took off is because the suit has gotten a bad rap.</TE>
<TE>   "It's very rare that people give you an idea of how versatile a suit
can be. You can wear them so many ways and break them up in so many ways.
Casual Friday should have been a deconstruction of the suit. A lot of the
newer suits are unlined, with soft shoulders. You can really express more
through them."</TE>
<TE>   What it really comes down to, says Tonchi, is dressing appropriately
for the job. Which means exactly what in Southern California?</TE>
<TE>   For Jim McMahon, a recent Chicago transplant in product development at
Blue Cross of California's Large Group Division in Woodland Hills, his
attire depends on his schedule. "We generally have a lot of flexibility
here. I typically wear dress pants and a dress shirt. In the summer, I
wear a short-sleeve shirt. Jeans are part of the dress code as long as
they're clean and neat. I don't typically wear jeans to the office,
especially if I have a presentation with a senior manager."</TE>
<TE>   McMahon, 38, buys most of his gear from Banana Republic because "it
matches, it's easy and I won't be raising any eyebrows."</TE>
<TE>   What does he think of the news that some companies are pulling back
from Casual Friday and returning to suits?</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think we'll be going back," he says. "So much of what we
wear--regardless of the day of the week--and do here is driven by the
climate, and our lifestyle is much more relaxed than in Chicago or Boston
or Washington, and about the last thing I want to do in the Valley in
August is wear a suit. The last time I wore a suit to Blue Cross when it
was 108 degrees was when I was interviewing for the job."</TE>
<TE>   But 28-year-old Nate Collins, who works as a trader for Wedbush Morgan
Securities in downtown L.A., still wears the uniform on most days:
"Brooks Brothers, Donna Karan, Banana Republic, Men's Wearhouse,
something like that. We're one of the few banks left in the financial
community that uses formal attire for most days."</TE>
<TE>   Except on Fridays in the summer (cue Don Ho's "Tiny Bubbles"), when
Collins apparently finds himself in the throes of abject misery. At the
offices of Wedbush Morgan, Aloha Friday is in full effect. Collins--who
grew up in the artsy community of Woodstock, N.Y., and "rebelled" by
attending the conservative College of William and Mary in
Virginia--admits he's a bit out of his element when it's time to pass the
poi.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm bad at this. I've only been on the West Coast for two years and
my Hawaiian shirts are heinous," he confesses. Before arriving here, he
worked in Jersey City for another financial firm where "they were very
business attire." One can almost hear him getting misty for the days of
gray flannel.</TE>
<TE>   However Paul Tsuchiya, chief operating officer of the National Academy
of Recording Arts &amp; Sciences, knows all about Aloha Fridays, having grown
up in Honolulu.</TE>
<TE>   "There's probably somebody in that firm from Hawaii," Tsuchiya laughs
when informed that there is a finance firm in L.A. where Hawaiian shirts
are de rigueur on summer Fridays. "In Hawaii there are different kinds of
aloha shirts, reverse print ones you wear to work, casual, more formal
ones you wear to weddings. Bankers and lawyers downtown used to wear
aloha shirts only on Fridays, hence 'Aloha Friday,' but nowadays I think
the only time you don't wear an aloha shirt is when you're going to court
or meeting with a client . . . who will inevitably be in an aloha shirt."</TE>
<TE>   Tsuchiya subscribes to the same philosophy of business attire as
McMahon. "If I'm having a meeting, a blazer and slacks. If not, jeans and
a sweater." But on Fridays, he confesses, he often wears an aloha shirt.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think I've ever been accused of having style," he laughs.
"When I don't have a meeting, I do the assistant basketball coach look."
But when he does dress up, it's black all the way.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm in the entertainment industry," he says. "It's so black!"</TE>
<TE>   He likes Hugo Boss, Armani and a tailor he used when he lived in Hong
Kong. Before coming to the recording academy, he worked for IMG's Digital
Media Unit in San Francisco, so he knows well the ways of the New Economy
(or is it now the Old New Economy?). "We were absolutely forbidden to
wear suits and ties, only salespeople wore that," he explains. But in
L.A., there is nothing verboten on his list. "You have to remember, it's
the music industry. People wear some funky stuff."</TE>
<TE>   And, like the guys at TBWA/Chiat/Day, Tsuchiya knows the importance of
the well-placed accessory. "I think of myself as fairly casual, but I
bought a Tag Heuer watch when I was in Hong Kong. They're totally
watch-obsessed and car-obsessed. It's so crowded, so things like watches
and cars are important because they can't have big, expensive houses. I
succumbed to the watch culture."</TE>
<TE>   He is perhaps the closest to the stereotypical successful SoCal guy.
Clothes are fun, clothes are comfortable, clothes are to get you through
the day, be it a Tuesday night dinner with recording executives or a
Friday afternoon staff meeting. The only time you need to dress up is
when you have to impress an outsider.</TE>
<TE>   No one knows that better than Jose Huizar. Huizar wears several hats,
among them deputy city attorney for Los Angeles and trustee of the Los
Angeles Unified School District. Born in Zacatecas, Mexico, Huizar came
to L.A. with his parents at age 2. With an undergraduate degree from UC
Berkeley, a master's in public policy from Princeton and a law degree
from UCLA, Huizar is used to finding himself in a variety of settings
that require different approaches.</TE>
<TE>   And he is well aware of how he would like to be perceived. "I used to
work at a law firm," he explains. "A lot of our clients were casually
dressed on Fridays and it made it more comfortable for us to dress
casually. If I had my way, I'd do away with ties altogether." But that
was before Huizar moved to the public sector.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't stand out, I'm a safe dresser," he explains, confirming that
he subscribes to the traditional wisdom that people want public officials
to embody dependability. "I think of my role as an elected official, and
the persona you want to give out is someone representing people. I can't
take fashion risks."</TE>
<TE>   So when it comes to suits, "I like to be on the conservative side:
blue, black, dark tan, olive, two light suits--all are three-button."</TE>
<TE>   He allows himself a slacks-and- dress-shirt outfit on Fridays, a look
he's never formally made office policy. It's an issue of mutual respect:
"As a member of the school board, I always make it a point to wear a
jacket and tie whenever I meet with a constituent or on any district
business." Weekends are work as well, but a different kind, says Huizar,
who lives in Boyle Heights. "I hardly ever put on a suit. I want to be
part of the people. I don't want to look stuffy."</TE>
<TE>   And it's important that he not look too slick, which is why he wears a
basic Kenneth Cole watch with a black wristband. "I purposely got this
after I left the law firm," he explains. "I felt that working in the
public sector, this was more comfortable."</TE>
<TE>   Sort of like trading in your Birkin for something from Kate Spade.</TE>
<TE>   But at whatever level you choose to play out your wardrobe on Fridays,
it's nice to know that most of us have options. "The word from management
here is that 'we need to be professional, but we want you to be
comfortable,' " McMahon says. "I like the fact that my company leaves my
attire up to my own good judgment."</TE>
<TE>   For Villegas, suits do more than set a productive tone. "I like
suits," he says. "I've always loved watching Cary Grant and Clark Gable
in the movies. I saw Magic Johnson and his personal style as a kid--and
that got me into GQ magazine and into what I wear. And besides, there are
not that many Latinos at the corporate level, and I like to put my best
foot forward."</TE>
<TE>   Ultimately, we're a community of chameleons, changing our clothes and
our demeanor to suit the occasion. Right, left, in between, we're
infamous for being a place of noncomformity. Californians don't even like
to be called "Westerners." We're Californians, and that's something
entirely different. Perhaps the whole concept of Casual Friday is besides
the point.</TE>

<HD>Down to Business</HD>
<DH>Laker Forward Rick Fox Has a New Look and a New Game Plan</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HEATHER JOHN</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Rick Fox is sitting in front of a mirror with his head covered in
shaving cream and a disposable Bic razor in his hand. It's a Monday
afternoon in a deserted furniture warehouse in Glendale, and halfway
through a fashion photo shoot he's decided that his locks, which have
taken a year and a half to grow, must come off.</LD>
<LD>   His wife, actress and singer Vanessa Williams, collects the curls in a
Ziploc bag while his 22-month old daughter, Sasha, lets out a wail. "It's
kind of strange to see myself with no hair," he says with a laugh. "I
don't look as friendly as I used to."</LD>
<LD>   In the week that follows, the Lakers win three consecutive games, with
Fox's hair (or lack thereof) receiving as much attention from the sports
media as his scoring averages, which have almost doubled since the hair
came off. "I don't think it's a coincidence. It's definitely a different
mind-set for me--a down-to-business look," Fox says. "At times [the hair]
was a distraction. All that's left to focus on is the game."</LD>
<TE>   The 32-year-old starting forward for the Lakers had returned this
season leaner, more muscular and more focused. "In the 2000 championship,
my ego would not let me accept [my performance] as being the best I could
bring to the table. So when Phil Jackson challenged me to take the summer
to come back at a different weight, and to come back with a different
mind-set, I really wanted to meet that challenge. Whatever goal he set
for me, I set one higher," he says. "This year, more than ever, I've
looked to be a facilitator, a creator of opportunities for my teammates.
I've improved in a lot of areas this year, and I think I'll definitely
continue to improve."</TE>
<TE>   Which, for an NBA player (or any professional athlete) in his 30s,
comes with a heightened level of challenge. After an 11-year career with
the Boston Celtics and L.A. Lakers, and two NBA championships, others
might have been content. But Fox has gotten a second wind. "I find myself
doing three times the work I did when I was trying to get into this
league. But that's the reality for any player in their 30s. I've made
some life-altering decisions in the areas of exercise and diet that have
rejuvenated my career," he says, adding that he's been following the Zone
diet, and has increased his cardio workout and weightlifting program.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel healthier and more athletic. I feel as young as I did in
college and that's something I guess a lot of athletes don't have once
they've hit 10 or 11 years in the league--they start to wind down. The
older you get, the more professional you have to be--that is, taking care
of your joints as well as your diet, your weight, your cardio. There are
younger players out there who want my job; there are other teams that
want our championship trophies, and there's an underlying sense of fear.
But fear is a strong motivating factor in life."</TE>
<TE>   For all of his intensity on the court, Fox's approach in his personal
life is decidedly more relaxed. Having a daughter, he says, "I've
definitely softened. She's been to every game. She's learned to chant
'defense' and she dances with the JumboTron. And she does her sprint
after the game to give her daddy a hug, so that makes my life 10 times
more enjoyable."</TE>
<TE>   Though Fox and his wife juggle bicoastal careers (Williams will star
in "Carmen Jones" at the Kennedy Center in Washington, D.C., next
season), he tries to spend most of his downtime with his family, talking
walks on the beach near their home in Marina del Rey, which reminds him
of growing up in the Bahamas, or frequenting local spots such as Baja
Cantina or Sushi Roku in Santa Monica. "I'm really a jeans and T-shirt
guy," he says. "Kids jump on you, spill food on you. I like to be
comfortable. I think anything too stiff makes me feel stiff. I like to
blend in." And that can't be easy when you're 6-foot-7. "That's why I go
with earth tones. I try to blend in with the earth . . . or the trees."</TE>
<TE>   He attributes any fashion discoveries to his wife. "Vanessa has
infused her style and taste into my life, not by accident, of course," he
says with a laugh. "She says when we met, my clothes were too baggy.
She's given me a greater outlook outside the world of sports, where if
you don't know where to go, then you're only going to buy what you see
other individuals wearing who are your size. But she's introduced me to
designers like John Varvatos--I'm right at the top of the [size] scale,
but I just fit in. It's nice to be able to put on a suit or sweater that
I would have never expected my frame to fit." "That's another thing I
like about L.A.," he adds. "Style is accepted across the board. There's
not a mandated dress code. People are appreciated for their style and
their personalities. You can go to a restaurant and be seated next to a
stylish New York couple and two people could walk in right off the beach.
That acceptance and flexibility is what my personality's all about."</TE>

<DH>There's the Man Whose Wristwatch  Merely Registers Minutes and
Seconds,  and Then There's the Man Whose  Watch Says Something Timeless</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KEVIN RODERICK</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A man in a decent suit enters a well-dressed room. he is
scrutinized by two groups of people who are aligned, loosely, by gender.
Women--and, yes, there are exceptions--silently judge the condition of
his footwear, overall attentiveness to grooming details--from haircut to
fingernails to the cut of his fabrics--and, perhaps, his physique and the
gleam in his smile.</LD>
<LD>   In the same split second, the fashion-aware males in the room scan for
any visible flaws in the new competition's muscular or financial
suitability to perpetuate the species. Odds are, both evaluations
ultimately will fix on the appendage that displays a man's most personal
and revealing style choice.</LD>
<LD>   That window into a man's wardrobe soul is his wristwatch. A $20 Casio
with a battery and a black plastic band says one thing about you--mainly,
that you just want to know what time it is. It will keep time fine, as
good or better than a watch costing 20 times as much. A $150 chronograph
with sub-dials for elapsed time, pulse rate and hour of the day in
Istanbul suggests that you really like to stay apprised of the time. It
also implies that you'd kind of like others to notice your abilities of
exactitude.</LD>
<TE>   Then there is the statement made by the man whose sleeve rises just
so, permitting a sly glimpse of a Patek Philippe or Audemars Piguet,
crafted in Switzerland in, say, the 1930s. A watch that the wearer winds
lovingly by hand each day or so, and must periodically adjust to the
correct time. If nothing else, this watch proclaims a man who has made a
choice to value aesthetics over the mere registering of minutes and
seconds, and has probably given some consideration to the heritage of the
timepiece he puts on his arm. After all, being on time only counts for so
much.</TE>
<TE>   The men with the magnificent watches can be intimidating, and it's not
because they can afford to dump a few thousand dollars on a watch.
Classic watches don't have to cost a lot. Look on EBay or visit Wanna Buy
a Watch? on Melrose. You'll find many vintage mechanical watches,
Swiss-made even, for a modest investment. No, these guys are threatening
because they grasp a wardrobe truth that many men don't get.</TE>
<TE>   The fashion advice Web site www.AskMen.com routinely finds it
necessary to remind its young male audience that "a classic watch is
undoubtedly a man's single most important fashion accessory." Adds the
site's fashion columnist Chris Rovny: "It's the only practical accessory
a man can wear. In my view, it's the only accessory a man should wear.
And his choice of a watch tells a lot about his style."</TE>
<TE>   If that is discomfiting to you, the real bad news is that these men in
the know are multiplying. Nowadays, it's easier and more inexpensive than
ever to buy a watch that keeps excellent time without any effort. But you
are missing a great chance to make some cool points if you go ahead and
strap just anything to your arm. Judging by EBay auctions, online
discussion forums and plain old street buzz, more men are appreciating
the classic beauty of vintage watches or going for new models with a
little elan. Rolex and Omega, of course, but also Breitling and Gruen and
other top brands.</TE>
<TE>   Aficionados prowl the monthly Rose Bowl flea market and shop at the
Antiquarius mall on Beverly Boulevard for deals on vintage watches. They
buy any of a half-dozen magazines devoted to watches and collecting, and
they flock to Web sites such as www.TimeZone.com and the newer
www.ThePuristS.com (based in Los Angeles) to discuss the intricacies of
ebauche and etablissage (French terms for a key component of the watch
movement and a method of assemblage). They voice their affection for
their watches in words they might otherwise use to describe an affair of
the heart.</TE>
<TE>   "I imagine we all experience 'honeymoon' periods with our new watches,
but for me, only a few of my acquisitions have managed to keep me
enthralled," began a recent posting on www.TimeZone.com titled, "Head
Over Heels in Love," a paean to the writer's vintage Hamilton Boulton:
"It's such a cool watch to wear. The case is a stunning example of '30s
Art Deco style and distinctly different from other watches from the same
era. I know it's common for us watch nuts to say that our collections are
'art we can wear,' but it's a classic of watch design in much the same
way that the Cord convertible is a classic car design from the same
period, and both embody the same streamlined, futuristic aesthetic. I've
got a feeling this is a love affair that's gonna last."</TE>
<TE>   my closest contact with this degree of epicurean appreciation came on
a European vacation, when my wife insisted we stay over in Lucerne so
we'd have time to shop for watches. Fun for her, agony for me. I tend to
own one functioning watch at a time and wear it until the battery quits
or the band splits. Then I go without until, exasperated by my asking her
the time, she gives me a new, invariably prettier watch. I'm up to a
Tissot quartz with a leather band, still a long way from a Vacheron
Constantin, but an improvement on my Swiss Army watch from REI.</TE>
<TE>   By canvassing friends, I found I'm about middle of the pack on the
watch question. My friend George in Dallas is the anti-watch extreme. He
works all day in a deadline environment, and even though he is often the
enforcer, he never wears a watch. There's always a clock around. Away
from the office, he doesn't want to know. "I'm a slave to the time at
work, so the rest of the time I just ignore it," he says. "I hate wearing
a watch."</TE>
<TE>   I also discovered closet watch fanatics lurking in my midst. My friend
Jeffrey runs his own business in Paris, a city not known for punctuality,
and he prizes his modest collection. "I am fond of the finer
collectibles, but my dreams of Audemars Piguets, Rolexes, Pions,
Blancpains and Cartiers are, let's say, reality-challenged." For now, he
adroitly adds less precious pieces, working them into his wardrobe as the
situation warrants. "I wear each one strategically, in the correct
context: the Casio Data Bank when teaching programming classes; the
self-winding Swatches for squash and bicycling; the Seikos for
all-purpose business wear and going out on the town; and a brown
leather-banded Swiss Army Wenger, worn while motorcycling in leather or
hiking in fatigues."</TE>
<TE>   Like any watch lover, he can wax on the attributes of his babies. "My
two Taboo-Taboos, one in gold and the other in silver, are classic French
quartzes with an unusual ball-shaped adjuster stem placed at the 4
o'clock position on the bezel." His favorite watch was handed down by his
father, a retired television writer. "A 1947 Glycine Swiss given to my
dad by Bob Hope and inscribed 'to Burt, my favorite ghost.' I'd be proud
to wear it while dining at Taillevent or Alain Ducasse."</TE>
<TE>   Closer to home, Robb Dalton, president of programming, production and
development at Twentieth Television, a division of Fox Television, also
received a treasured watch from his father. He's noticed that many of his
fellow collectors caught the horological bug with such a family heirloom
or a gift. He owns more than a dozen watches, mostly antique Americans
such as Gruen and Elgin, and a rare Hamilton Illinois. On a recent
Tuesday, Dalton sported a Gruen driver's watch, a sort manufactured in
the 1920s and '30s to sit on the inside of a motorist's wrist and be
visible when hands are on the steering wheel. "I bought it because it's
absolutely a work of art," Dalton says. That's the bottom line for many
admirers of fine watches. It's not about price or resale value. "It would
never occur to me to sell one of my watches," he explains. "It is about
craft and about appearance. I like a watch with some personality."</TE>
<TE>   He doesn't keep them hidden in his closet either. "There's not a watch
in my collection that I don't wear," Dalton says. Putting on a watch is
the most fun he has getting dressed. "Let's face it, men in business
don't have that many choices: you've got the blue suit, the black suit or
the gray suit. When I go in the closet in the morning and pick out what
I'm going to wear, I think about which watch will be right for that day."
Showing off and admiring vintage watches seems to have become a Hollywood
pastime. Now when executives and talent shake hands at the start of a
meeting, they often check out each other's wrists. This sets off a round
of compliments and swapping of tips on the best service technicians and
where to shop. (Feldmar on Pico Boulevard and Westime in West L.A. are
favorites of local collectors.) "We're sort of like a club without any
meetings," Dalton says. "We talk about watches all the time."</TE>
<TE>   So what explains this growing devotion to the watch? Michael
Friedberg, a well-known collector, took a stab at explaining: "I've had
and have many fine watches--Patek, Lange, Breguet, Audemars, Blancpain,
etc. They all keep time, so that's not the issue . . . Watches are
symbols that transcend timekeeping devices, that reflect a culture, a
history and an aesthetic."</TE>
<TE>   To some extent, he says, the rising interest is due to the fact that
American men are finally discovering the classic attraction of a
watch--part adornment and part practical device. And, he suggests, in
this high-tech age, when so much is electronic and invisible, a vintage
watch remains strictly mechanical, a formation of springs and jewels that
can be tinkered with and observed. Many collectors can--and do--take
their watches apart and explore the workings. Try that with a digital
camera, a radio or an automobile engine. Friedberg has been collecting
mechanical watches for about a dozen years. His personal obsession now is
pieces by IWC. He hosts busy discussions of IWC watches on Web sites, and
lately has been wearing IWC's limited edition Portuguese Automatic 2000.
As for IWC, "they don't keep time better than another dozen brands. But I
like their style, service, engineering and history. IWC has a highly
engineered approach to watchmaking that has survived for over a century."</TE>
<TE>   These true believers can recite the founding dates of the major Swiss
watch houses and they report to each other on vacation visits to the Old
Country. Some refer to themselves jokingly as Watch Idiot Savants, a
title that gives rise to some self-ribbing: "A WIS is so distracted by
his watch that he fails to note the time." "You know you're a WIS when
you accept a job because the interviewer wore a nice watch." "A WIS has
nightmares about Rolex world domination."</TE>
<TE>   Every manufacturer has its fans and detractors, but none gets roasted
among the faithful like Rolex. That is due, in part, to the brand's
reputation as the watch of choice for know-nothings who only want to buy
an expensive name and brag about it. A heated Internet exchange ensued
recently after a poster asked mischievously: "Why do so many fat
businessmen wear Rolexes?" This, of course, frosts the brand's more
learned worshipers. The chief Rolex advocate on www.TimeZone.com once
felt moved to post an impassioned defense of his favorite maker, which,
after all, has been around since 1905: "A little tolerance might be no
bad thing. For all intents and purposes, Rolex invented the wristwatch as
we know it."</TE>
<TE>   Ultimately, the enjoyment of a nice watch is a sensual experience.
Fans like to look at their watches, stroke them, listen to the purr of
the balance. Here's how one collector expresses his pleasure at the
simple act of turning the crown on his Patek Philippe: "Oooh, that feel
of a Patek winding experience--deliciously smooth and creamy, coming
together with that fine-pitched ratcheted sound--tactile ecstasy!"</TE>
<TE>   The allure is put another way by Thomas Mao, founder and executive
director of www.ThePuristS.com: "Time is too precious to measure on a
cheap watch."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The day I answered the ad for the position of doorman at a swank
West Los Angeles high-rise apartment building, I'd reached the end of my
rope. It was the mid-'70s, and after a particularly rough year of living
like a refugee, I did something many young creative types liken to
suicide: I got a real job.</LD>
<LD>   A disinterested building manager hired me on the spot, throwing a
young, labor-challenged trainee into the den of parking valets working
the evening shift. I wasn't supposed to last long. Indeed, even as I
filled out my first time card, I pondered what I considered more
honorable employment, like robbing 7-Elevens. But when the eagle spread
its wings that Friday, the sensation of a meager, steady paycheck plus
tips got the better of me. I decided to get measured for that uniform
and, for the time being, write by day and open a door at night.</LD>
<LD>   Over several weeks, the valets schooled me on the rite of the hustle.
I became obsessed. On my watch, no tenant or visitor ever got the
opportunity to touch that door. I was a ninja on it.</LD>
<TE>   Among the building's collection of wealthy retirees, foreign
diplomats, kept women, well-to-do working-class, financiers, high-class
hookers and corporate execs was a show business quotient that included
composer Marvin Hamlisch and Elvis' legendary manager, Col. Tom Parker.</TE>
<TE>   I remember introducing tenants Sly of Sly &amp; the Family Stone and
"Roots" author Alex Haley to each another in the elevator. Each was
tickled to make the other's acquaintance, with Sly even coming out of a
haze long enough to be sociable. (Later on, Sly got behind on his rent
and the office banned him from the building for a time. Usually following
house rules to the letter, I looked the other way when Sly and entourage
would sneak through.)</TE>
<TE>   However, my favorite tenant was hair-care icon Vidal Sassoon. Though
he'd made a fortune in the haughty beauty business, Sassoon, a fit and
handsome then-50something Brit, was affable and down to earth. He'd
return from the office in the evenings and we'd chat briefly about
whatever was going on in the world. With an ex-wife, a tribe of kids and,
at the time, a gorgeous, flirty young girlfriend in and out of his daily
life, it was clear that Sassoon loved women. Yet every now and then his
eyes would do a quick, discreet dance over me with a purpose and gleam
that I could only decipher as . . . The Look. Not a leer, and certainly
not offensive. Just, you know, The Look. I interpreted various strains of
The Look for the better part of a year until one Monday afternoon, when I
received great news: A music magazine wanted me full time. I was
overjoyed, but torn. Why venture back into the rickety world of creative
employment when I'd come to enjoy what the artistic sector smugly
referred to as "civilian life"?</TE>
<TE>   "Because writing is what you do," Sassoon said rather sternly during
our evening chat. "Is it your ambition to be a successful writer or a
doorman?" The following evening, he congratulated me on submitting my
week's resignation notice.</TE>
<TE>   "Tell you what," he said in a chipper English accent. "On your last
day, when you complete your shift, come up to the apartment and we'll
celebrate with a toast."</TE>
<TE>   "Oh, that'll be late," I said. "I don't get off until after 11."</TE>
<TE>   "That's OK."</TE>
<TE>   "That's pretty late, Mr. Sassoon," I pressed, not wanting him to feel
obligated. "Not too late to have a drink with you. To celebrate your new
job."</TE>
<TE>   "But . . . "</TE>
<TE>   "Let's do it. I won't take no for an answer."</TE>
<TE>   With that, Sassoon stepped onto the elevator. As the doors closed, he
gave me a wink, a smile and then laid it on me--a deluxe version of The
Look.</TE>
<TE>   Friday night I clocked out for the last time. I changed into my jeans
and secretly made my way up to Sassoon's apartment. Employees were
prohibited from socializing with tenants. I was no longer an employee,
but I was nervous about Sassoon. I knew The Look. As straight as an
arrow, I had no interest--even if I was flattered. And curious.</TE>
<TE>   In anticipation of my arrival, the apartment door was slightly ajar.
As I stood in the hallway, the silence was sliced by a female's lusty
giggle from within. My knock was answered by the voice of Sassoon: "Ah,
my friend! Bring those broad shoulders on in here."</TE>
<TE>   With some trepidation, I pushed open the door and found Sassoon and
his girlfriend relaxing on a couch in his sumptuous living room, sharing
a joke. I apologized for intruding, but Sassoon simply waved it off,
stood up and poured me a glass of Champagne. "Here's to your new job," he
toasted. Glasses clinked and we sipped.</TE>
<TE>   While the three of us sat and engaged in small talk, I found myself
miles away, recalling mid-'60s Oklahoma City--a child sitting with Daddy
in our powder-blue '50 Chevy Bel Air, parked outside Dr. Porter's white
middle-class home, waiting for Mama to get off work. Five days a week
Mama cleaned Miss Porter's house, cooked meals and helped raise kids.
Then she'd come home and do the same thing for us.</TE>
<TE>   Nightly, Mama brought home stories of middle-class America--tales of
annual vacations and family pets that lived indoors. In Los Angeles,
Jessie Turner--Mama's mother and my grandmother--did the same thing. But
on her days off she took home more than stories: We were grateful for
millionaire real estate agent  George Gregson's discarded monogrammed
bath towels, which grandmother dutifully distributed annually between
family in Oklahoma and Compton.</TE>
<TE>   Once upon a time, "the help" was about all black folk could be in
America. Being a doorman wasn't quite cleaning toilets, but it held its
challenges and lessons, the biggest being that the job doesn't make the
man. Standing sentry at that door, I learned that, ultimately, it's about
the personal pride and ingenuity you bring to the task. I became a damn
good doorman and ended up proud that I took the gig.</TE>
<TE>   Those thoughts were interrupted by something I didn't count on:
Sassoon's girl said she had a big day tomorrow and rose to leave. As he
saw her to the door, I drank up, hoping to make a quick exit as well. But
Sassoon was vigilant, motioning me to stay put.</TE>
<TE>   "So," he said, waving, "follow me." He walked into the bedroom. I was
now downright put off. I certainly wasn't interested in the man, but if
simply showing me to the bed was the extent of his romantic technique. .
.</TE>
<TE>   Sassoon spoke before I could.</TE>
<TE>   "I have a confession. I didn't invite you up here simply to have a
drink." Here it comes.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been watching you for a while now, and . . . " Pause. Whatever
Sassoon wanted to say, he was having trouble with it. "I've wanted to ask
you, but I didn't know your position on something like this. I didn't
want to offend you, but I thought, 'He's a nice guy. What the hell, just
ask him.' "</TE>
<TE>   With that, Sassoon turned and walked over to his closet. "Would you be
interested in this?" On a hanger was a suit--a tan-colored jacket and
trousers. Nothing flashy, but exquisitely, classically cut. For a second,
I was embarrassed. When that second passed, I said the only thing you can
say when a man with the taste and charm of Vidal Sassoon leads you to his
closet and presents you with one of his suits: "Man, if it's not
monogrammed, it's mine!"</TE>
<TE>   Sassoon observed with satisfaction as I slipped the jacket over my
white button-down work shirt. It fit like a glove. So this was what The
Look was all about--sizing me up for a suit.</TE>
<TE>   And this is who Vidal Sassoon was--a man who looked at a man opening a
door and saw something more.</TE>
<TE>   "Vidal, I love this," I gushed.</TE>
<TE>   "Great. Then it is yours."</TE>
<TE>   Sassoon explained that he'd had the suit custom-made a couple of years
before but could count on one hand the times he'd worn it. He'd had it
cleaned in anticipation of offering it to me, but said he forgot one
minute detail. "There's a small hole in one of the jacket pockets," he
cautioned. I stuck my hand in the left pocket and found no hole, but
slowly came out with a crisp $100 bill.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe it's in the right pocket," he said, looking concerned and
ignoring the money. I dug into the right jacket pocket and retrieved yet
another $100 bill. I looked up at Sassoon to see the mischievous grin of
a man whose little ruse had worked.</TE>
<TE>   "Hey, buddy," he reasoned, "if you're going to be a writer, you have
to look good and have a couple of bucks in your pocket." My eyes began to
water. A handshake became a hug. I kidded Sassoon that I thought he had
had something else in mind. He just laughed. "Ha! You WISH!"</TE>
<TE>   There were tenants in the lobby when I stepped off the elevator in my
new suit. Some offered the bewildered gaze that people give to familiar
faces seen out of uniform for the first time. Halfway across the lobby,
my walk worked itself into a dignified strut. I heard that door close
behind me for the last time as I went proudly into the night with a new
suit, some cash in my pocket and a dream in my heart. It was a start.</TE>

<DH>An Ambitious Remake of Raffles L'Ermitage's Restaurant Takes the
High Road</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>S. IRENE VIRBILA</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Hotel restaurants have it tough. Locals generally avoid them
because most are stuffy, overpriced and rarely exciting. Hotel guests
don't particularly want to eat in either, unless they don't know a soul
in town or are completely unadventurous. If you come to L.A., you want a
place where you'll see the life of the city--as well as eat better.</LD>
<LD>   That makes the remake of the restaurant at Raffles L'Ermitage, the
Beverly Hills luxury hotel, all the more remarkable. Its first
incarnation wasn't a success. I remember one dinner when the only other
table was a foursome in T-shirts, obviously hotel guests, jet-lagged and
sawing away at basically meat and potatoes. We had ordered the tasting
menu, a choice so unlikely that the chef came out to peer at our party.</LD>
<LD>   In making a change, the safe thing would have been to rewrite the menu
to look like that of every popular spot in town. Instead of bringing on
the chopped salads, seared ahi tuna and New York strip, the management
did something unusual. It involved chef David Myers in revamping the
entire restaurant, not just the menu. That meant redoing the decor,
investing in an expensive array of new tableware and hiring a new
front-of-the-house staff.</LD>
<TE>   The restaurant was renamed Jaan. The word is Cambodian for dish or
bowl, and is meant to convey the idea that Jaan fuses elements from
Indochine, French and American cuisines. Obscure and difficult to
remember, the name errs on the side of pretension. I thought the odds of
the restaurant being dreadful or interesting were about 50/50.  On my
first visit, I found my meal much better than those I'd had during the
restaurant's previous try, which was under the same chef. And subsequent
meals confirmed that impression.</TE>
<TE>   The small menu of six first courses and the same number of main
courses changes every few weeks. Some dishes are wonderful, like oyster
mushroom soup embellished with roasted Dungeness crab and a dreamy lemon
verbena fondant. Or a soup of celery root puree with pear and sea urchin.
Because the kitchen was out of sea urchin the night I tried it, Myers
substituted Santa Barbara spot prawn, cooked just two minutes and cut
into bite-sized pieces. For the first time in a long while, soup seemed
interesting again.</TE>
<TE>   Maine lobster goes into a beautiful salad of Belgian endive and
watercress, in which the bitter crisp greens and the sweet lobster meat
play off a slurry of green apple vinaigrette. For another fine appetizer,
skate wing is topped with thin strips of velvety Big-Eye tuna wrapped
around pickled, vinegary papaya. It's a delightful weaving of flavors.
Pickling is a theme that runs throughout Myers' new menu. It's
particularly effective in the combination of tender pickled veal tongue
with braised rabbit leg and gingered broccoli raab.</TE>
<TE>   Fish and shellfish are all incredibly fresh, sometimes excessively so.
I love the silken texture of slow-roasted Scottish salmon, every bite
rare and custardy, but perhaps it doesn't need the Santa Barbara prawns
sprawling on top. It is wonderful, though, with "forbidden rice" stained
black with squid ink. One night, the confit of black bass is virtually
raw, like a thick piece of sashimi still wearing its tough
diamond-patterned skin. That's a bit off-putting, but its garnish of
Manila clams and a risotto colored with mustard greens are both
delicious.</TE>
<TE>   When Myers cooks red meat, he gives even that a slight Asian twist.
I'm thinking of the braised Colorado lamb shank and roasted loin flavored
with bright, grassy cumin seed, set off with sweet and sour shallots
(there's the pickle idea again) and pea sprouts. The menu also offers
something optimistically called "Vision of Jaan." The chef's tasting
menu, which must be ordered by the entire table and can vary from six to
eight courses depending on the evening, is mostly culled from the regular
menu. Portions are smaller, of course, and the dishes are often
variations on a theme or a slightly different take on the original.</TE>
<TE>   When three of us tried the "vision" one night, it started with a
brilliant amuse bouche: a dab of shaved raw foie gras and hamachi belly
rolled up with shiso leaf and garnished with a few strands of soba
noodles. Then came lobster draped with uni (sea urchin) and served with
miniature mustard-flavored spaetzle drizzled with curry oil, which made
the lobster all the sweeter. That was followed by salmon confit topped
with seared black bass, which didn't seem to have much to do with each
other.</TE>
<TE>   As the meal progressed, the plates got larger and larger, but the
portions smaller. When a rectangular plate arrived with modest bites of
squab, pork belly and rabbit liver, it reminded us of the worst excesses
of nouvelle cuisine. My dining companions were worried that they were
going to go hungry for $85 a person. (They didn't. But then they weren't
exactly stuffed either.)</TE>
<TE>   Desserts are unusually good, especially the coconut milk panna cotta
paired with roasted pineapple infused with Szechuan peppercorns, and the
grapefruit trio, which features a fresh grapefruit salad, yogurt ice and
a tangerine gelee. Griottes, the dark French cherries, appear in an ice
cream topped with clever candied fennel in a subtle Chinese five-spice
broth.</TE>
<TE>   It's no surprise that the hotel's wine list is seriously overpriced,
but I would expect the wines by the glass suggested with each dish to be
more exciting. Though wine, shown off in glass cabinets, is certainly an
important element here, the list needs more bottles that complement the
food. Those big California Chardonnays or grassy Sauvignon Blancs just
don't do it.</TE>
<TE>   The staff is so eager to greet anyone coming in the door, the sheer
wattage brought to bear can be overwhelming. And whenever anyone asks for
anything, anything at all, the answer is always a fervent "absolutely." I
stopped counting at 15 in one evening. Is everybody here under a spell?</TE>
<TE>   Jaan's dining room is as sleekly tailored as an Armani suit, with silk
slipcovered chairs, pale orchids and floor-to-ceiling windows looking
onto an urban Zen garden. Though the space is inviting, and you can eat
outside on mild evenings, the restaurant never seems very busy, even
during Grammy week. The bar seems to do more business than the
restaurant. With that kind of turnout, it's not easy to stay focused, but
Myers doesn't seem fazed by it. It's a shame there aren't more takers for
his bold fusion cooking.</TE>
<TE>   With Jaan, Raffles L'Ermitage has taken the high road, and it can only
be good for the dining scene in Los Angeles if this promising young
restaurant succeeds. Whatever happens, Myers, who is just under 30, is
proving himself a chef to watch.</TE>

<HD>Korea Vets Bear Stigma of American Talib Lindh</HD>
<DH>Battle: After the conflict ended, 21 prisoners of war opted to live
in China; two remain there.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SHARON L. CRENSON</AU>
<AU>MARTHA MENDOZA</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The old man knows he is being asked the question for a special
reason.</LD>
<LD>   Is John Walker Lindh--the young Californian accused of fighting for
the Taliban--a traitor?</LD>
<LD>   Sam Hawkins remembers when Americans asked the same question about
him, back when he was a young soldier and a new, uneasy truce draped the
Korean peninsula</LD>
<TE>   "Traitor, yeah, they called me a traitor," he said. "But I wasn't
really." Lindh, he said, is a different story.</TE>
<TE>   In the winter of 1954, Hawkins was among 21 American prisoners of war
who refused to come home after the Korean War. Instead, they headed to
communist China, shocking their families and their nation.</TE>
<TE>   The Associated Press recently tracked down several surviving members
of the original "21 balky pro-Red POWs," as this wire service called them
back then. Eleven have died. Two reportedly remain in China. Two
apparently settled in Europe.</TE>
<TE>   And six live quietly here in the States. They were not pleased to be
found, and those who agreed to be interviewed spoke on the condition that
their locations not be disclosed. Judging by their words, they are
genuinely patriotic.</TE>
<TE>   "When you walk over this country line, you ought to get on the ground
and kiss it, baby, because we've got something that nobody else has,"
Hawkins said. Then he leaned way back and laughed loud and hard. "I'm
sure I ought to know."</TE>
<TE>   The widow of a CIA agent slain at the Afghan fort where Lindh was
captured later told the world: "John Walker is a traitor because of the
way he lived. It's so simple and I hope that all Americans will feel the
same way."</TE>
<TE>   Her words echo the outrage against Hawkins and his 20 cohorts, back
when communism was the enemy.</TE>
<TE>   The cases are quite different. Lindh reportedly joined the Taliban
willingly; the Korean War defectors were prisoners of war who decided to
go to China only after three years of communist indoctrination in the
camps. And unlike Lindh, who is scheduled to be tried in August on
charges of conspiring to kill Americans, none of the Korean War defectors
was accused of taking up arms against American troops.</TE>
<TE>   But there are also some parallels.</TE>
<TE>   "What strikes me as similar between these guys and John Walker Lindh
is the way this country reacted to them," said historian Adam Zweiback.
"It obviously opened a lot of insecurities that Americans felt about
themselves."</TE>
<TE>   Then, as now, the nation was shocked and bewildered that a young
American could decide to betray his country.</TE>
<TE>   Today, if prodded, that first group of "turncoats" has something to
say about being young, impressionable, and making bad decisions.</TE>
<TE>   "I could be blase and say, well, let's give him a fair trial and then
hang [him]," Hawkins said about Lindh. "But part of the thing people
forget is that if you isolate anybody, they can be transformed."</TE>
<TE>   Aaron Wilson, a retired heavy equipment operator who was among the
first in Hawkins' group to return to the States, agrees.</TE>
<TE>   "I think he's got hisself in a mess," he said about Lindh, speaking in
the drawl of man reared in the central Louisiana woods. "He was probably
just searching, following somebody or something."</TE>
<TE>   As Wilson once did.</TE>
<TE>   "That experience, I just try to put it behind me now," he said. "It
was a bad one."</TE>
<TE>   Most of the men who went to China with Wilson grew up poor.</TE>
<TE>   Born during the Depression, the eldest of eight children, Wilson was
reared in a Southern hamlet where most neighbors tilled vegetable gardens
and labored in the local mill. In good times, his father made 75 cents an
hour.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the 21 came from broken homes, unusual at the time, but
Wilson's family was close. He loved his "mother and daddy" so much he
almost couldn't stand to leave.</TE>
<TE>   In contrast, Lindh was seemingly eager to depart liberal Marin County,
where he grew up comparatively well off. At 17, he persuaded his parents
to send him to an expensive school in Yemen; and within months, his
letters home would have seemed eerily familiar to the parents of Korean
War soldiers like Wilson.</TE>
<TE>   In one, for example, Lindh suggested his mother move to England,
saying: "I really don't know what your big attachment to America is all
about."</TE>
<TE>   The sentiments echo those of the young defectors in Korea in late
1953.</TE>
<TE>   "It is impossible to fight for peace in the United States," wrote Pfc.
Arlie Pate. "Anyone who tries to fight for peace will be prosecuted and
even put to death."</TE>
<TE>   Scott "PeeWee" Rush told reporters, "I am determined to fight for
peace and this [China] is the only place where I will have the freedom to
do it."</TE>
<TE>   What changed them? How could any American choose the drab blue-gray of
Mao Tse-tung's cotton uniform or the turban and robes of Osama bin Laden?</TE>
<TE>   War erupted in June 1950 when North Korean troops invaded the South in
an attempt to unify the divided country. By November, American forces
defending the South were all but triumphant when the Chinese suddenly
entered the war on the side of the North.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the 21 Americans who eventually went to China were captured
during the first days of the Chinese attack, meaning they spent about
three years as prisoners before making their fateful decisions.</TE>
<TE>   According to U.S. military records, the POWs endured relentless
communist indoctrination including mandatory lectures on the evils of
capitalism.</TE>
<TE>   The Americans didn't react well to six-hour sessions in freezing
temperatures, so the Chinese switched to smaller, "voluntary" study
groups. GIs displaying "progressive" thinking might be rewarded with a
scrap of pork in their gruel, or perhaps with a job delivering camp mail.</TE>
<TE>   Even today, the names of Marx, Engels and Lenin trip disconcertingly
off the tongue for Wilson, one of the five American defectors who never
went beyond the eighth grade. He still remembers, though he no longer
believes.</TE>
<TE>   Morris Wills, another of the 21 and the son of an upstate New York
farmer, explained his sympathy for socialist ideals in his autobiography:
"Before I was a prisoner, I thought China was a terrible tyranny. But
what I got from them in camp was completely different. Everything was
nice, sort of orderly planned way for everyone to live together. So by
December 1952 or January 1953, I felt that if I got the chance someday, I
would like to go to China."</TE>
<TE>   Wills was one of the first prisoners the Chinese talked to about
refusing to go home.</TE>
<TE>   Thousands of Chinese and North Korean prisoners of war didn't want to
go home either, and American peace negotiators insisted they shouldn't be
forced to.</TE>
<TE>   The matter became a double-edged sword when 23 of the 4,300 Americans
who survived the POW camps refused to return home. Other allied
soldiers--one Briton, a few Belgians and about 350 South Koreans--also
chose communism.</TE>
<TE>   "They told me that if I wanted, I could go to China, and I said, 'Hey,
that sounds cool,' " recalled Hawkins.</TE>
<TE>   In the winter of 1953, as a delicate cease-fire held, Wills, Wilson,
Hawkins and the others were trucked to a compound near Panmunjom, where
peace talks were underway. The American POWs arrived, fists raised,
singing "The Internationale," a communist anthem.</TE>
<TE>   Hawkins remembers American soldiers shouting back the words to "God
Bless America."</TE>
<TE>   "We were in trouble already," he said recently. "No doubt about it."</TE>
<TE>   The American POWS were given 90 days to change their minds about
defecting. Two, Edward Dickenson and Claude Batchelor, crossed to the
U.S. side.</TE>
<TE>   Subsequently, both were court-martialed, Dickenson on charges of
communicating with the enemy and misconduct as a prisoner of war and
Batchelor on charges of collaborating with enemy. Dickenson was sentenced
to ten years and Batchelor to life, later reduced to 20 years. Both were
released after serving 3 1/2 years.</TE>
<TE>   At Panmunjom, as the 90-day deadline neared, American forces blared a
message to the remaining 21: "We believe that there are some of you who
desire repatriation."</TE>
<TE>   Defector Sgt. Richard Corden, then 25, of Rhode Island, stomped around
the compound with part of his blue prison uniform thrown over his
shoulder like a cape.</TE>
<TE>   "Do any Americans want to go home?" he shouted.</TE>
<TE>   "No!" the others called in chorus.</TE>
<TE>   "Each and every one of these ingrates should receive a dishonorable
discharge, and thereby be forever barred from any consideration for war
veterans' benefits."</TE>
<TE>   The year is 1954; the speaker U.S. Rep. William C. Cole, a Missouri
Republican.</TE>
<TE>   By the mid-'50s, the American public was alarmed by stories of
communist sympathizers working even within the U.S. government. U.S. Sen.
Joseph McCarthy led a series of investigations, fueled by accusation and
rumor.</TE>
<TE>   Other members of Congress held hearings about why some American
soldiers had apparently cracked.</TE>
<TE>   "We couldn't wrap our minds around the notion that American citizens
would choose to stay in Korea and so we came up with a mystical concept
that imbued a power to the people holding them," said James Richardson, a
social psychologist at the University of Nevada.</TE>
<TE>   Brainwashing, insisted Portia Howe, the mother of another of the men.
Her son must have been brainwashed.</TE>
<TE>   Today, Marilyn Walker says much the same of John Walker Lindh.</TE>
<TE>   "If he got involved in the Taliban, he must have been brainwashed,"
Walker said in an interview earlier this year. "He was isolated. He
didn't know a soul in Pakistan. When you're young and impressionable,
it's easy to be led by charismatic people."</TE>
<TE>   Young and impressionable. The 21 Americans who disappeared into China
nearly five decades ago were certainly that.</TE>
<TE>   "Brainwashing is not done with electrodes stuck to your head; you are
not turned into a robot obeying the orders of a Chinese master," Wills
wrote in his book. "What we call 'brainwashing' is a long, horrible
process by which a man slowly, step by step, idea by idea, becomes
totally convinced, as I was, that the Chinese communists have unlocked
the secret to man's happiness."</TE>
<TE>   About 4 a.m. on Feb. 24, 1954, a train carrying the 21 American
defectors rumbled across the Yalu into China.</TE>
<TE>   "It was misty and cold--very dark, very gray, very cold," Wills wrote.</TE>
<TE>   The first Sunday the group ventured out in Taiyuan, a crowd trailed
them.</TE>
<TE>   Soon, Chinese instructors began lectures on socialism, then moved on
to "criticism" sessions in which each man told his faults as others
verbally whipped him.</TE>
<TE>   "Your first reaction is to feel very, very small. You crawl," Wills
recalled. "This continuous barrage of accusations makes you feel the
whole thing is true."</TE>
<TE>   The Chinese then shipped some of the men off to the People's
University to study language and politics. Arlie Pate was sent to a paper
mill where, he would later say, he spent his days watching others work
and his nights dancing.</TE>
<TE>   William Cowart, Lewis Griggs and Otho Bell "were kind of the dummy
bunch," Bell later recalled for a historian. "They sent us to a
collective farm, 'cuz we wasn't educated enough to learn Chinese. We were
way out in the country--the people there thought we was from outer
space."</TE>
<TE>   The novelty wore off quickly for some. Within two years, the men began
to trickle home, some with help from the Red Cross, others through
friendly embassies.</TE>
<TE>   The first three to return--Cowart, Griggs and Bell--were arrested as
they set foot in the United States in 1955. Three months later a federal
judge turned them loose, saying the military courts no longer had
jurisdiction because the men had been dishonorably discharged.</TE>
<TE>   Wilson returned in 1956 and married his boot-camp sweetheart, who by
then had two boys Wilson adopted. The family traveled to New Mexico and
California, the dishonorable discharge haunting Wilson with each job
application.</TE>
<TE>   Later he returned home to Urania, La., to work at the mill like his
father. He used the job as a stepping stone to others around the South,
operating heavy equipment in shipyards.</TE>
<TE>   Hawkins--by many accounts the most dashing of the bunch--came home in
1957. His friends and family know he was a prisoner of war in Korea. They
know he's fluent in Chinese. But they don't know the Army labeled him a
"squealer," and that Mike Wallace once asked him on national television
whether he was a spy.</TE>
<TE>   "No one asks questions, and I don't offer details," Hawkins said.</TE>
<TE>   He petitioned the Army to reverse his dishonorable discharge, and
succeeded in having it upgraded to less than honorable.</TE>
<TE>   "When I came back, I knew I had to get on with my life. I didn't want
to dig ditches, so I got educated, I made a life for myself, I moved on,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   James Veneris, the dark-haired son of Greek parents, visited the
United States in 1976, but found himself a misfit and returned to China.
He and Howard Adams, a former corporal from Corsicana, Texas, are
reportedly the only two Korean War defectors remaining in China.</TE>
<TE>   Back in the United States, the remaining survivors have done the best
they could.</TE>
<TE>   Rush, a retired machinist, settled in the Midwest with the Chinese
wife he brought home. They live a quiet life, and he worries about
friends and neighbors somehow learning of his past.</TE>
<TE>   Wilson retired to a small, well-kept brick house and a yard crazy with
flowers. Plastic pink flamingos stand watch. In the middle of it all
flies an American flag atop an 18-foot pole.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the greatest country in the world," he said, "and maybe when
I was 17 years old I didn't know it, but I do now."</TE>
<TE>   Time will tell if Lindh ever feels the same.</TE>

<HD>Slain Bride's Parents Tormented by 'If Onlys'</HD>
<DH>Crime: Anastasia, 18, had a dazzling smile and a bleak life ahead
of her in Kyrgyzstan. Then she met an American via a matchmaking service.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID FOSTER</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>EVERETT, Wash.
</DL>
<LD>Anastasia's parents are tormented by thoughts of what might have
been.</LD>
<LD>   If only they hadn't pushed their daughter so hard to succeed, to seek
in America what they couldn't provide in Kyrgyzstan. If only they hadn't
given the matchmaking agency that photo of Anastasia looking so fresh and
innocent. If only they hadn't believed the lies of that fast-talking
American who wanted to make Anastasia his wife.</LD>
<LD>   "We were so blind," says her mother, a black shawl of mourning wrapped
around her shoulders. "If I had trusted him less, I could have saved my
daughter."</LD>
<TE>   Anastasia King was a mail-order bride, one of the 4,000 to 6,000 women
who come to America each year, marrying men they barely know.</TE>
<TE>   Many of them find economic security, and some even find love.</TE>
<TE>   Anastasia found her way to a shallow grave. Indle King Jr., convicted
of murdering his young bride, was sentenced March 25 to nearly 29 years
in prison.</TE>
<TE>   The punishment may be fair but it brings little solace, for nothing
can return Anastasia to them, say her parents, Anatolyi Soloviev and
Alevtina Solovieva. Memories will have to do, and of those they have no
end. Anastasia had an astonishing smile, her parents say. It was a smile
that turned heads and lit up the bleakest day like sunshine.</TE>
<TE>   She was their only child, and in her they invested the dreams they
could not realize for themselves in Kyrgyzstan, a former Soviet republic
where prosperity eludes all but a few.</TE>
<TE>   The parents, both music teachers in Bishkek, tried to shield their
family from worldly woes with what Alevtina calls "a wall of music." But
they worried about how to pay for a good education for Anastasia, a
diligent student and gifted pianist.</TE>
<TE>   When they heard that a relative had found an American husband through
a mail-order bride service, they signed up Anastasia. Soon a photograph
of their 18-year-old daughter--sitting on the floor, beaming that
astonishing smile--joined the pictures of dozens of other women in a
catalog.</TE>
<TE>   Before long, letters started arriving. There were piles of them, and
among them was one from a man named Indle King.</TE>
<TE>   He'd enclosed a photograph, but it was very small. Mother and daughter
peered at it. He seemed old and overweight. "Is that a beard, or a second
chin?" Alevtina wondered.</TE>
<TE>   But Indle King was persistent. He wrote, he called, and in December
1997 he arrived in Kyrgyzstan for a visit. He struck Anastasia's father
as an organized, efficient man. He impressed Anastasia's mother with his
interest in classical music.</TE>
<TE>   He was highly educated, with an MBA from the University of Chicago,
and was from a well-to-do family in Seattle, which the Solovievs knew as
the prosperous land of Bill Gates.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the parents had reservations. At 36, Indle was twice their
daughter's age, and at 270 pounds was nearly twice her weight. She was
beautiful, with silken hair down to her waist; he was dumpy and nearly
bald. He'd also been married and divorced before, to another Russian
mail-order bride, which they wondered about until he explained that she
had run off, abandoning him most cruelly.</TE>
<TE>   He had a keen sense of humor, and he swept up Anastasia with promises
of a wonderful life. She'd find adventure and a good education in
America, he told her, and she'd never want for money.</TE>
<TE>   "A man loves with his eyes, but a woman loves with her ears," Alevtina
says. "The girl just idealized him."</TE>
<TE>   Three months after meeting Indle in Kyrgyzstan, Anastasia flew to
America for a visit. One month after that, on April 30, 1998, they went
before a justice of the peace and were married.</TE>
<TE>   The honeymoon soon ended.</TE>
<TE>   Anastasia complained that her husband wanted to know where she was
every minute of the day. He wouldn't let her get a driver's license. They
argued a lot. He said he wanted children; she said she wasn't ready.</TE>
<TE>   He wasn't as well-off as he'd led her to believe, so they took in
boarders at their home in Mountlake Terrace, a suburb of Seattle.
Anastasia enrolled at the University of Washington and worked long hours
as a waitress and restaurant hostess. Indle took money from her account.</TE>
<TE>   Anastasia read books about how to save a marriage, but nothing seemed
to help. By the summer of 2000, two years into their marriage, "it was
warfare," her mother says.</TE>
<TE>   Indle was corresponding with other prospective mail-order brides.
Anastasia was seeing other men and keeping a list of her husband's
transgressions. He threatened to hurt her, forced her to have sex, and
forbade her from going to a counselor, she wrote in a journal that she
hid in a safe-deposit box.</TE>
<TE>   Anastasia grew depressed. One day, she showed up at work with bandages
covering cuts on her wrists, recalls her boss, Patty Swaney.</TE>
<TE>   "Nothing can be that bad, ever," Swaney admonished her.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a weak moment," Anastasia said. "I won't do it again."</TE>
<TE>   In August 2000, Anastasia flew to Kyrgyzstan, her second visit that
summer to see her parents. Shortly after she left, Indle filed for
divorce, telling his attorney that he had no idea where his wife was,
even though he talked with Anastasia frequently by phone.</TE>
<TE>   In September, Indle joined his wife in Kyrgyzstan. By this point,
Anastasia was telling her parents she was determined to go back to
America, get divorced and apply for permanent residence, now that she'd
been married for the required two years to a U.S. citizen.</TE>
<TE>   The couple arrived at the Seattle airport on Sept. 22, 2000, and took
a shuttle bus to their home. It was the last day Anastasia was seen
alive.</TE>
<TE>   Indle King initially told police he'd left his wife in Moscow,
changing his story only when confronted with records that showed them
clearing Customs together in Seattle.</TE>
<TE>   He still insists he had nothing to do with the death of his wife, but
jurors at his five-week murder trial earlier this year came to believe a
different tale told by Daniel Larson, 21, a boarder in the Kings' home.</TE>
<TE>   In December 2000, Larson led investigators to Anastasia's body, buried
in a shallow grave on an Indian reservation 25 miles away.</TE>
<TE>   At trial, Larson testified that Indle King had enlisted him to kill
Anastasia so he could avoid another expensive divorce like the one from
his first wife, which cost him $55,000.</TE>
<TE>   Larson said Indle lured Anastasia into the garage the night they
returned, then grabbed her in a bear hug while Larson slipped a necktie
around her neck. The trio lurched back into the house, where Indle lay on
top of her while Larson twisted ever tighter, Larson said.</TE>
<TE>   They stripped her body and cut off her long, blond hair, then stuffed
her into a shallow grave, Larson testified.</TE>
<TE>   Defense attorneys raised doubts about Larson, a convicted sex offender
who changed his story several times and testified only after prosecutors
offered him a plea bargain for second-degree murder.</TE>
<TE>   But the jury not only convicted Indle King of first-degree murder,
they fell in love with Anastasia.</TE>
<TE>   On Feb. 24, three days after handing down their verdict, all but two
of the jurors joined Anastasia's parents at a graveside service. They
held hands in a circle around the grave and prayed. Alevtina and Anatolyi
gave them each a chocolate egg, one of Anastasia's favorite treats, and
the jurors gave the parents a plaque.</TE>
<TE>   "In remembrance of Anastasia," it read, "who only wished to follow her
dream."</TE>
<TE>   Brought to America last year to help investigators, Anastasia's
parents now are asking immigration officials to grant them a special
humanitarian visa to stay, saying they want to remain close to their
daughter's grave.</TE>
<TE>   Alevtina tries to focus on memories of better times, such as the days
in September 2000, when Anastasia, finding strength among family in
Kyrgyzstan, regained her bubbly confidence. She started flashing that
astonishing smile again, and people turned to look when she walked by.</TE>
<TE>   But one memory leads to the next, and Alevtina cannot help but think
about how her daughter looked when she realized her husband soon would
arrive to take her back to America.</TE>
<TE>   She would be strong, Anastasia told her mother. She would do what she
had to do. But she did not look strong. Her whole body seemed to shrink
at the very thought of Indle King. Her green eyes stared vacantly, and
tears flowed down her cheeks.</TE>
<TE>   "Mama," Anastasia asked, "why do I feel so sad?"</TE>

<HD>Singing Praises of Cantonese Opera</HD>
<DH>Culture: Hong Kong children who have been introduced to the
traditional art form are helping spur the effort to keep it alive.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HELEN LUK</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>HONG KONG
</DL>
<LD>Clad in traditional bright-red Chinese bride and groom costumes,
Josephine Liang and Max Tse are preening in front of the mirror yet
again. She carefully fixes her bejeweled phoenix coronet; he straightens
his dragon-embroidered robe.</LD>
<LD>   But they are far too young to get married.</LD>
<LD>   Josephine is just 10 and Max is 8. They are about to play the leads in
a dress rehearsal of a classic Chinese opera, "Breaking the Red Lantern,"
a nuptial comedy of a haughty princess and her impertinent groom.</LD>
<TE>   As part of an innovative program, 30 Hong Kong children are breathing
new life into a traditional art form that once was immensely popular as
the sole form of entertainment in the rural villages of Hong Kong and
southern China.</TE>
<TE>   Chinese are now more likely to be entertained by television, movies
and trendy music, and as many opera fans age and die, there have been
worries the operas themselves could be doomed.</TE>
<TE>   "People commonly think that only grannies will listen to Cantonese
operas, but then I wondered whether children will be interested in
learning it too," says Stella Ma, an amateur performer who decided last
July to start teaching children the ways of opera.</TE>
<TE>   The experiment was met with an overwhelming response--the class
quickly doubled and more would like to join, says Ma, who studied
Cantonese opera for a master's degree in ethnic music.</TE>
<TE>   The kids, who have worked on the "Red Lantern" for two months, take
their work seriously and turn in a surprisingly good performance.</TE>
<TE>   Amid the music of gongs and cymbals, the groom is irritated at being
left alone by his snobby princess bride at their wedding banquet. "What
an insult," Max sings. "I must show my anger."</TE>
<TE>   While pondering how to punish the princess, he stops at the doors of
an imaginary wedding chamber, acting as if he has seen a red lantern
hanging up--a traditional sign that the groom cannot enter.</TE>
<TE>   "What? That silly rule. That stupid red lantern," the groom sings as
he pulls down the makeshift lantern and crushes it with his feet.</TE>
<TE>   Not knowing that the lantern has been trashed, the princess sings in
falsetto, "Tom, how dare you come in when the lantern is still up!"</TE>
<TE>   And so it goes in Cantonese opera.</TE>
<TE>   Josephine says it was love at first sight when her mother first took
her to an opera about the moon goddess Sheung-ngor, full of singing,
acting, dancing, acrobatics, posturing and bright makeup.</TE>
<TE>   "I love the songs, to sing and act," she says. Josephine is a tough
self critic, calling her performance in the rehearsal not "expressive
enough."</TE>
<TE>   Max says he had to be dragged to the classes by his parents, both
devoted opera fans.</TE>
<TE>   "It was boring and difficult," he says, fidgeting during an interview.
"But after I learned it for a while, I discovered that it's a lot of
fun."</TE>
<TE>   Parents rave about the benefits opera has brought to their children.
They say the kids benefit physically from practicing acrobatics, their
language skills get honed from memorizing lyrics and their gestures are
more graceful.</TE>
<TE>   Daisy Chan says her 6-year-old daughter, Lam Yu-tung, refused to take
off her costume after coming home from the first class. "She just loves
it and begged me to let her continue to learn."</TE>
<TE>   Like a young starlet, Yu-tung can spare a reporter just a few minutes
while a cosmetician paints her face.</TE>
<TE>   "I like to wear fairy dresses," she says as she gets patted with white
powder and spread with rouge before thick black eyeliner and vermilion
lipstick are added.</TE>
<TE>   Fitted out with a waist-length wig and glittering headdress, Yu-tung
looks the miniature diva as she heads out to dance with four fellow moon
fairies.</TE>
<TE>   The children seem intrigued by the highly stylized makeup and the
dazzling and colorful costumes--sewn by hand and decorated with sequins
and intricate embroidery.</TE>
<TE>   "We often have to tell the children to stop running around since the
clothes can't be washed," Ma says.</TE>
<TE>   The children often make a mess of themselves when they paint their
faces. But they can master difficult stunts like somersaults and
cartwheels within minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Lying flat on the ground, 8-year-old Tanya Kong easily arches her back
and legs forward to place them between her upturned head, with spectators
gaping at her ball-shaped body.</TE>
<TE>   "It's easy," she says.</TE>
<TE>   Some lyrics have been translated into English and the young actors

<HD>European Satellite Plans Draw Static</HD>
<DH>Science: Proposed system would rival--and some say threaten--U.S.
Global Positioning System. But EU says there's room for both.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL GEITNER</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>PARIS
</DL>
<LD>A bust of Christopher Columbus stands proudly outside the office of
the head of the European Space Agency, a reminder of Europe's grand
tradition of exploration and the riches it can bring.</LD>
<LD>   Nowadays, space is the new frontier and Europe has mostly ceded its
trailblazing role to the powerful nation in the New World whose
settlement Columbus initiated. But that doesn't mean the treasure hunt is
over.</LD>
<LD>   European leaders are pushing ahead with commercial ventures to exploit
outer space, despite sometimes blunt U.S. opposition with military
overtones.</LD>
<TE>   Having already snared half the global market for commercial space
launches with its Ariane rockets, Europe is set to give the go-ahead for
a $3-billion rival to the U.S.-run Global Positioning System.</TE>
<TE>   EU ministers decided to release $396 million in development funds at a
meeting in Barcelona late last month.</TE>
<TE>   That would resuscitate Galileo, a project tied up for a year by money
woes that recently came under attack by the Pentagon, which controls GPS
and--some Europeans feel--is loath to lose its monopoly.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials insist they're not trying to dictate to Europe. They
point out that GPS, which is also undergoing an upgrade, is already
available worldwide--for free.</TE>
<TE>   "The United States sees no compelling need for Galileo," said Ralph
Braibanti, the State Department official leading talks with the EU on the
project.</TE>
<TE>   Yet perceived attempts at U.S. interference may have helped rescue
Galileo. Just as it seemed the plug was about to be pulled a few months
ago on cost grounds, the debate shifted to geopolitics.</TE>
<TE>   French President Jacques Chirac warned that Europe risked "vassal
status" if it didn't keep up in the space race.</TE>
<TE>   EU Transport Commissioner Loyola de Palacio of Spain spoke of the
dangers of others "calling the shots."</TE>
<TE>   "Is it essential for Europe that we have our strategic independence or
not?" the head of the European Space Agency, Antonio Rodata, asked in an
interview, his rising voice and clenched fist providing his answer.</TE>
<TE>   Germany had been the key holdout, but finally decided to come on board
in late February. "Satellite navigation is one of the key technologies of
the future," German Transport Minister Kurt Bodewig said in Berlin.</TE>
<TE>   Swaying the cash-strapped German government was the "considerable
political, strategic and economic importance" of Europe having its own
system.</TE>
<TE>   The European Space Agency, which is separate from the EU, was set up
in 1975 with the express mission of helping Europe "catch up" with the
U.S. and Soviet space programs. It has a long history of cooperation with
NASA in scientific missions, as the photos decorating Rodata's office
attest.</TE>
<TE>   The agency provided the solar panels and one of the main instruments
on the Hubble telescope, for example, and built a probe for NASA's
Cassini spacecraft en route now to Saturn.</TE>
<TE>   But to remain competitive in the 21st-century economy, Europe believes
it must do more than just provide "bits and pieces" to NASA projects.</TE>
<TE>   This month the space agency launched its own $2 billion Earth
observation satellite to aid climate change research. It was also the
originator of commercial moneymakers like the Ariane launchers and
Eutelsat, which produces communications satellites.</TE>
<TE>   According to the agency, each euro of taxpayer money spent since the
1970s on the Ariane rockets has produced a three- or fourfold return on
investment in the form of increased economic activity.</TE>
<TE>   "It's important that we master this technology to create opportunity
in Europe," said Rodata, an engineer with more than three decades of
experience in Italian electronics firms.</TE>
<TE>   The space agency and the European Commission, the EU's head office,
announced plans for Galileo in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Private investment would help defray the cost of building and
launching 30 satellites, backers say. With six more satellites than GPS,
Galileo could provide added value and greater accuracy. Royalties from
decoder chip sales and revenues from customers would start pouring in
once the system is operational in 2008.</TE>
<TE>   An independent study by PricewaterhouseCoopers saw the strongest
commercial potential of Galileo in so-called "location-based" mobile
technologies, where Europe already leads the United States. Such services
allow cell phone users to track down the nearest pub, for example, or
zero in on friends.</TE>
<TE>   But the study also said EU governments would probably have to bear the
costs of getting Galileo up and running.</TE>
<TE>   That has worried some, notably Britain and the Netherlands, which
managed to garner enough votes to postpone releasing development funds in
December.</TE>
<TE>   EU spokesman Gilles Gantelet dismisses such concerns as a "pretext"
and instead blames "unfair" U.S. lobbying.</TE>
<TE>   Shortly before the December vote, U.S. Deputy Secretary of Defense
Paul Wolfowitz wrote EU colleagues questioning the "security
ramifications for future NATO operations" if Galileo goes ahead.</TE>
<TE>   His concern was that Galileo signals could interfere with the
next-generation GPS signals intended for military use.</TE>
<TE>   That, he wrote, "will significantly complicate our ability to ensure
availability of critical military GPS services in a time of crisis or
conflict and at the same time assure that adversary forces are denied
similar capabilities."</TE>
<TE>   Galileo backers say such technical problems can be resolved. And
although Galileo will not be operated by the military, as GPS is, they
insist security concerns are not being ignored.</TE>
<TE>   "Don't believe that Saddam Hussein will have access to Galileo,"
Gantelet said. "That's stupid. It will not happen."</TE>
<TE>   Rodata also dismisses worries that Galileo could aggravate
trans-Atlantic trade relations if the EU decides to generate revenue by
mandating the use of Galileo equipment, for example, on airliners flying
into Europe.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not sure Europe will take a protectionist attitude," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Other potential problem areas, such as ensuring compatibility with
GPS, are solvable, he said.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials are less sure.</TE>
<TE>   "There are two roads today: there is cooperation and there is damaging
competition," Scott Pace, deputy director of science and technology
policy at the White House, told Spanish reporters during a
videoconference last month.</TE>
<TE>   Braibanti, the State Department official, said he expects further
talks this spring.</TE>
<TE>   "There's some tough issues that have to be worked out," he said from
Washington. "The jury is still out as to whether a solid basis for
cooperation still exists."</TE>

<HD>Plans for a Building Shed Light on Its Dark Past</HD>
<DH>Lisbon: Former home of Portugal's secret police is to be converted
into luxury apartments. But some say a museum acknowledging abuses would
be a better fit.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BARRY HATTON</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>LISBON, Portugal
</DL>
<LD>The squat four-story building stands in a side street, a spooky
presence just off one of Lisbon's most popular shopping districts.</LD>
<LD>   Silent amid the downtown bustle, its thick, white-stone walls conceal
a bare, crumbling interior of shadows and doors that creak in the wind.
Pigeons peer out from shattered window panes.</LD>
<LD>   The city council lists it among 1,400 abandoned or decrepit buildings
in Lisbon, many of which are to be renovated as part of an urban renewal
program. Its ghostly insides are slated to become luxury apartments,
offering a prestige address and prized view of the River Tagus.</LD>
<TE>   But the plan has become a controversy because of the building's past.</TE>
<TE>   For three decades, it was the secret police headquarters for one of
western Europe's last dictatorships.</TE>
<TE>   Thousands of political dissidents were taken there, some to be
tortured, and some people are demanding it be preserved as a public
memorial to those who opposed the 41-year dictatorship of Antonio
Salazar, which ended with a 1974 army-led revolution.</TE>
<TE>   Antonio Dias Lourenco, an 87-year-old member of the Portuguese
Communist Party, accuses city politicians of disregarding the past in
their rush to modernize. He wants the building to be turned into a
museum.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a mistake," he said of the renovation project. "It's a building
of historical significance for Portugal, a monument to the struggle for
freedom. We can't just forget."</TE>
<TE>   Suspected dissidents were taken for interrogation to the building in
the Chiado, an elegant district renowned in the 19th century as a
gathering place for artists and writers.</TE>
<TE>   "I was barbarically beaten there on two occasions," in 1949 and 1962,
Dias Lourenco said. He spent a total of 17 years in prison for alleged
political crimes.</TE>
<TE>   He was taken to the infamous third floor, he said, where officers used
electric shock and truncheons to force him to reveal his contacts in the
underground opposition.</TE>
<TE>   "They used to tell us, 'The law doesn't enter here,' " he said.</TE>
<TE>   Known by its Portuguese acronym, PIDE, the International and State
Defense Police used undercover agents and paid informants to intimidate
dissidents into silence.</TE>
<TE>   Iva Delgado, widow of air force Gen. Humberto Delgado, who confronted
Salazar and was killed by the PIDE in 1965, noted that the Brazilian
ambassador's residence used to be across the narrow street from the
secret police headquarters.</TE>
<TE>   When the ambassador's wife complained about screams coming from the
building, the police told her it was the screech of the electric trolley
passing by, Delgado said.</TE>
<TE>   Nowadays, the relic of Salazar's rule barely elicits a glance from
commuters on the No. 28 trolley trundling down the sloping street toward
the broad Tagus.</TE>
<TE>   Lisbon, a city of about 550,000 people, has no landmark skyscrapers,
and the building fits snugly into its surroundings.</TE>
<TE>   The 18th-century building, in a district that was mostly destroyed by
a 1755 earthquake, has little architectural value, but has a rich
history.</TE>
<TE>   It was owned by the family of Portugal's last king, Manuel II. The
monarchy ended when he was deposed in 1910 and a republic established.</TE>
<TE>   The state paid the family rent for use of the building, but after the
fall of Salazar, it was abandoned and handed back to its owners.</TE>
<TE>   The only reminder of its inglorious past is a plaque next to the tall
main door. It memorializes four men who were shot to death in the street
by PIDE officers when the building was besieged by a vengeful mob on the
day of the 1974 revolution.</TE>
<TE>   The plaque is daubed with graffiti--another sign of the city's modern
trends.</TE>
<TE>   Next door, the Sao Luiz theater is an example of the city's successful
renovation program. After years of decay, it is now painted yellow with
white trim--a traditional Lisbon color scheme. Other renovated buildings
sport striking pink or bright-green paint.</TE>
<TE>   The city council says it cannot force the private owners of the PIDE
building to turn it into a museum. The Culture Ministry says it prefers
to spend its own budget on computerizing the dictatorship's archives.</TE>
<TE>   Julia Pereira Branco, 73, who has lived behind the old PIDE building
for 67 years, takes a pragmatic view. "It's falling down. I just want to
see someone do something with it," she said with a shrug.</TE>
<TE>   Margarida Barreto, whose real estate company plans to develop the
site, said she doesn't expect people to balk at living in the building
because of its dark past.</TE>
<TE>   "History passes," she said.</TE>

<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>MANAMA, Bahrain
</DL>
<LD>From North Africa to the Persian Gulf, tens of thousands of
protesters took to the streets Friday, defying rubber bullets and tear
gas to vent their anger against Israel's military offensive in the West
Bank.</LD>
<LD>   Protests turned violent in Bahrain, where demonstrators attacked the
U.S. Embassy, some breaking into the compound and smashing windows. Riot
police in Jordan used water cannons to disperse protesters marching on
the Israeli Embassy in Amman. In Tunisia, police stormed demonstrators
gathering despite a government ban, beating them with truncheons.</LD>
<LD>   Rallies in Egypt, Saudi Arabia and Lebanon went peacefully, but most
demonstrators appeared unimpressed with President Bush's call Thursday
for Israel to pull back from Palestinian areas and his decision to send
Secretary of State Colin L. Powell to the region.</LD>
<TE>   Some Arabs instead lamented Bush's comments lambasting the Palestinian
leadership and focused their hostility on the United States and U.S.
symbols, burning American flags and attacking McDonald's restaurants.</TE>
<TE>   In Bahrain, home to the U.S. 5th Fleet, demonstrators hurled stones
and gasoline bombs at the U.S. Embassy, some yelling, "Death to America!"
and "Death to Israel!"</TE>
<TE>   Riot police dispersed the protesters after about an hour and fired
volleys of tear gas to prevent them from regrouping, while helicopters
flew overhead.</TE>
<TE>   The demonstration was one of the biggest political gatherings in years
in the conservative Persian Gulf state.</TE>
<TE>   Jordan, under domestic and wider Arab public pressure to sever ties
with Israel, banned demonstrations Friday after allowing marches earlier
in the week.</TE>
<TE>   But about 6,000 people in and around the Kalouti mosque in the
capital, Amman, ignored the order and tried to march on the Israeli
Embassy. Riot police blocked the route of the demonstration and used
water cannons and tear gas to halt the crowd.</TE>

<HD>China's Antibiotics Breeding Trouble</HD>
<DH>Health: Experts say chronic overuse is leaving the population, and
perhaps the world, vulnerable to resistant new diseases.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARTIN FACKLER</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>YANDIAN, China
</DL>
<LD>Most of the people who come to Dr. Wang Yuhua's unheated rural
clinic in central China have minor complaints--runny noses, sore throats,
maybe a fever.</LD>
<LD>   For 1.4 yuan, or just 17 cents, Wang injects them all with penicillin
and sends them on their way. Empty drug vials quickly fill the bucket
under his unpainted wooden desk.</LD>
<LD>   While antibiotics like penicillin have done wonders to improve health
in China, experts say the drugs are being overused, leading to the
emergence of drug-resistant diseases. The problem is being seen in many
countries, but the experts warn that China is becoming a particularly
serious breeding ground.</LD>
<TE>   "Overuse is causing penicillin and other antibiotics to lose their
medical value. Doctors give them for coughs and sore throats without even
bothering to learn the cause" of the illness, said Wang Hui, deputy
director of bacteria research at Beijing Concordia Medical School.</TE>
<TE>   Antibiotics save countless lives by killing bacteria, the cause of
infections and deadly illnesses. But the more these drugs are used, the
greater chance of a genetic mutation that allows bacteria to protect
themselves. Drug-resistant strains then flourish as antibiotics kill off
other bacteria that compete for food.</TE>
<TE>   Although stronger strains are appearing worldwide, experts say China
is especially troublesome because of its huge population, the ready
availability of antibiotics and lack of awareness about the problem.</TE>
<TE>   "China is among the leading countries that are a concern," said Dr.
Stuart Levy, a Tufts University expert on drug-resistant infections. "The
situation is terrible because these drugs are essentially available over
the counter."</TE>
<TE>   Resistant strains are being discovered in China at an alarming rate.</TE>
<TE>   A survey last year in the central province of Hubei found that 60% of
large intestine infections could not be stopped by ciprofloxacin, a
common antibiotic best known as a cure for anthrax. No such infections
were found in 1993.</TE>
<TE>   A quarter of China's 5 million reported tuberculosis cases were
infected with strains that can survive one or more antibiotics, the
Beijing Youth Daily reported last April.</TE>
<TE>   More ominous, hospitals in Hubei and elsewhere reported a rise in
"super strains" of the bacteria MRSA able to resist several antibiotics.</TE>
<TE>   Things could get worse as antibiotics lead to ever tougher bacteria,
which in turn require stronger drugs, health officials say. The result
could be bacteria that survive all drugs, making routine surgery
dangerous by threatening incurable infections.</TE>
<TE>   "Overuse of antibiotics is like wasting the lives of your own soldiers
in a war. Eventually you'll have too few left to beat the enemy," said
Shen Zhengyi, who heads Hubei's Bacterial Resistance Monitoring Center.</TE>
<TE>   More than 70% of drug prescriptions nationwide in China are for
antibiotics, compared with about 30% in the West, Shen said.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, 6,000 tons a year are fed to livestock, finding their way
into milk.</TE>
<TE>   Experts say Chinese health workers have only rudimentary medical
training and often don't know the dangers of overuse of drugs. Health
workers say they are only beginning to be made aware of the problem, and
few government policies exist to curtail antibiotic use.</TE>
<TE>   The financial incentive to over-prescribe drugs is another problem.
Drugs are one of the few health costs not controlled by the government,
making them an inviting revenue source for medical workers.</TE>
<TE>   But the biggest reason for China's fondness for antibiotics may be
their proven success.</TE>
<TE>   In Yandian, the village in Anhui province where Wang's clinic is
located, antibiotics have slashed disease rates over the last decade.
Children are now two-thirds less likely to die before age 5 as they were
in 1990.</TE>
<TE>   "Antibiotics are advanced Western medicine. Everyone who comes in here
wants them," Wang said.</TE>
<TE>   Experts fear that misuse of antibiotics will increase as lower costs
and rising incomes put them within reach of even poor households.</TE>
<TE>   Li Jiawen's three-room farmhouse in Pingtang, a village near Yandian,
has dirt floors, mud walls and only two naked bulbs for light. But on the
crude wooden shelves in the main room are piles of white packages
containing oral antibiotics for his father's tuberculosis.</TE>
<TE>   The pills cost about 12 cents each--well within the means of his
family's income of $700 a year.</TE>
<TE>   "I want the best I can afford for my father," Li said.</TE>

<HD>Czechs Take Aim at Light Pollution</HD>

<BD>From Washington Post</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Czech Republic has become the first country in the world to
pass a law aimed at reducing light pollution, which has increasingly
become a problem for astronomers trying to study the heavens.</LD>
<LD>   The law, which passed both houses of Parliament and was signed by
President Vaclav Havel on Feb. 27, goes into effect June 1. It requires
citizens and groups to "take measures to prevent the occurrence of light
pollution of the air," defining light pollution as "every form of
illumination by artificial light which is dispersed outside the areas it
is dedicated to, particularly if directed above the level of the
horizon."</LD>
<LD>   Violators will be subject to fines of up to 150,000 Czech crowns
(about $4,200), according to a statement released recently at the
International Dark-Sky Assn. annual conference in Tucson, Ariz.</LD>
<TE>   "Many of my fellow citizens are as concerned as I am about the glare
created by poorly designed lighting; they're happy action was taken,"
said Jenik Hollan, a Czech astronomer who pushed for the new law.</TE>

<HD>Protection a Double-Edged Sword</HD>
<DH>Military: An overriding focus on protecting U.S. anti-terrorism
personnel from any harm can put them and their mission at risk.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DEB RIECHMANN</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>The U.S. destroyer Cole was operating under "Threatcon Bravo," one
of the lowest terrorist-threat conditions, when two suicide bombers in a
small dingy rammed it in Yemen and blasted a hole in its side, killing 17
sailors.</LD>
<LD>   The 40-by-40-foot gash left in the ship in October 2000 was an
unsettling reminder that despite greater protection efforts, U.S. troops
worldwide are at risk of terrorist attack.</LD>
<LD>   Worries about the safety of soldiers are heightened by President
Bush's decision to expand the war on terrorism. Sending military advisors
and troops to the Philippines, Yemen and the former Soviet republic of
Georgia means more time and money spent on protecting the military as it
helps protect the world.</LD>
<TE>   "We're sending people into harm's way, not quite in the same way as
Afghanistan, but in harm's way, and that can make them targets for
terrorists," said Dan Goure, a military analyst at the Lexington
Institute in Arlington, Va.</TE>
<TE>   As the threat against U.S. interests has risen over the last two
decades, the military has steadily stepped up safeguards. Force
protection ranges from Kevlar helmets to missile defense, strategic
intelligence and CIA penetration of terrorist groups.</TE>
<TE>   Shatterproof glass is installed, concrete barriers encircle buildings.
The Pentagon is trying out high-tech devices such as ultraviolet
radiation for neutralizing germ or chemical warfare agents in building
ventilation systems and infrared devices that can detect and track people
lurking in darkness outside military bases.</TE>
<TE>   "The target doesn't always have to be the bases themselves," Goure
said in an interview. "It's the guys coming into the airport, then
traveling the 20 miles down the road to the base, who might get shot up."</TE>
<TE>   When 19 American servicemen were killed by a truck bomb that exploded
at Khobar Towers in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, in 1996, the military worked
to better protect bases and other fixed installations. Local combat
commanders, for instance, were given more authority for force protection.
Troops in Saudi Arabia were relocated from the city to more desolate
quarters in the desert dunes.</TE>
<TE>   After the Cole attack, the focus shifted to better protecting moving
targets such as ships.</TE>
<TE>   The commission investigating the attack called for more specific
intelligence conveyed directly to ships. The active-duty military now
must complete anti-terrorism training every year, not just within six
months of being deployed overseas.</TE>
<TE>   The Pentagon also changed the name of the Threatcon levels to
force-protection conditions: Normal, Alpha, Bravo, Charlie and
Delta--each with a list of progressive measures to be taken for
protection. The change was made late last year to avoid confusion with
the threat levels used to categorize terrorism threats for entire
countries, not just specific troop locations.</TE>
<TE>   For obvious reasons, soldiers in the field clam up when asked what
they're doing to protect themselves against a terrorist attack.</TE>
<TE>   Sgt. 1st Class Tim, who would not give his last name, helps set up
equipment to detect a possible chemical, biological or radiation attack
at a base in Uzbekistan where 1,000 soldiers have been stationed
throughout the Afghan war. "Our job is to detect so we can warn," he told
an Associated Press reporter who was visiting the base, which is
surrounded by concrete barriers and barbed wire.</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes staying home is the best way to minimize risk, said Charles
Pena, senior defense analyst at the libertarian Cato Institute. He
opposes dispatching troops to the Philippines to help wipe out the Muslim
extremist Abu Sayyaf group, which has been linked to Osama bin Laden's Al
Qaeda terrorist network.</TE>
<TE>   "Abu Sayyaf guerrillas number fewer than 100," he said. "They were a
separatist Islamic organization, but have really just become a
kidnapping-for-money organization."</TE>
<TE>   In March, a team of U.S. military officers went to Yemen to lay plans
for training a few thousand local troops on how to fight Al Qaeda members
who may be hiding there.</TE>
<TE>   The Pentagon also plans to send as many as 200 Americans to help train
the military in the Georgia republic. Terrorists are believed to have
taken refuge in the Pankisi Gorge near Georgia's border with Chechnya.</TE>
<TE>   "Georgia could be dangerous," analyst Goure said. "If there are
elements of the Russian intelligence service who don't particularly want
us in Georgia, it would be a relatively easy thing to organize a
terrorist attack against us."</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes protecting the troops involves multiple threats with
competing solutions.</TE>
<TE>   Although concentrating troops and equipment at a base might thwart
some terrorist attacks, dispersing personnel might make them less
vulnerable to a missile attacks or biological or chemical agents.</TE>
<TE>   Local conditions also can hamper efforts to safeguard troops. Aviano,
Italy, a major base for forces operating in Kosovo, is a good example,
Goure said.</TE>
<TE>   "You fly in right over parts of the city," he said. "If somebody
wanted to put a Stinger [anti-aircraft missile] out a window, there's
really nothing you can do about it. You can't clear the city."</TE>
<TE>   There's also a danger of spending more time trying to keep troops safe
than executing the mission, said Marcus Corbin, a senior analyst at the
Center for Defense Information.</TE>
<TE>   "The Americans in Kosovo really had a bunker mentality--not going
outside the camp or not being allowed to go out without full combat gear
on," Corbin said. "That sort of puts a barrier between them and the local
civilians."</TE>

<DL>SANTA CLARA
</DL>
<LD>In the days after the Korean War, a new insidious and dramatic
weapon was unveiled to the horror of the American public: brainwashing.</LD>
<LD>   "The men who went into battle in Korea against tanks and minds of the
communist forces had not been given a hint regarding Red brain warfare,"
wrote journalist Edward Hunter, who coined the term "brainwashing" after
a Chinese informant called the process "hsi nao," or "cleansing the
mind."</LD>
<LD>   Now social psychologists and cult experts debate whether brainwashing
even exists--some call it junk science, while others say it is the
sinister process that sucked John Walker Lindh, a young man from Marin
County, into the ranks of the Taliban.</LD>
<TE>   University of Nevada social psychologist James Richardson, a leading
critic of the term and concept, said that people use the notion of
brainwashing to avoid the consequences of their decisions.</TE>
<TE>   "None of us find it easy to say I did it, I blew it, it's my fault,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   At the end of the Korean War, when 21 captured American soldiers opted
to stay with the enemy and hundreds more prisoners of war came home
accusing each other of collaborating with their captors, public officials
turned to brainwashing as the explanation.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Phillip Zimbardo, president of the American Psychological Assn.
and a Stanford University psychology professor, said the powers of social
influence cannot be denied.</TE>
<TE>   "They are variants of well-known social psychological principles of
compliance, conformity, persuasion, dissonance, reactance, framing,
emotional manipulation, and others that are used on all of us daily to
entice us: to buy, to try, to donate, to vote, to join, to change, to
believe, to love, to hate the enemy," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Cult expert Steven Hassan, who himself was a cult member, is convinced
that the Korean War POWs and Lindh were victims.</TE>
<TE>   "I believe that with proper counseling, Lindh would be horrified at
what brainwashing has made him do," he said. "Indeed, it appears that
mind control techniques similar to those used by my cult leader have been
used by Osama bin Laden and his cronies to recruit, train, and exploit
talented people to do their bidding."</TE>
<TE>   Congressional hearings following the Korean War prompted President
Dwight D. Eisenhower to adopt a new Code of Conduct for American soldiers
in 1955.</TE>
<TE>   It says: "If I am captured, I will continue to resist by all means
available. I will make every effort to escape and aid others to escape. I
will accept neither parole nor special favors from the enemy. . . . I
will never forget that I am an American, responsible for my actions, and
dedicated to the principles which made my country free."</TE>
<TE>   As for Lindh, Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft is apparently already arguing
against a mind-control defense.</TE>
<TE>   "Our complaint, based on Walker's own words, is clear," said Ashcroft
in January, when Lindh first appeared in federal court. "Terrorists
didn't compel John Walker to join with them. John Walker chose
terrorists."</TE>

<HD>Children's Sexuality Book Turns Up Heat on Publisher</HD>
<DH>Culture: Author warns of the danger of restrictive attitudes.
Conservatives condemn the provocative work and pressure University of
Minnesota Press.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID CRARY</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK
</DL>
<LD>A month before its publication, a provocative book about children's
sexuality is being denounced by conservatives as evil and prompting angry
calls for action against the University of Minnesota Press.</LD>
<LD>   The book, "Harmful to Minors: The Perils of Protecting Children From
Sex," argues that young Americans, though bombarded with sexual images
from the mass media, are often deprived of realistic advice about sex.</LD>
<LD>   "What's happening to me is a perfect example of the very hysteria that
my book is about," New York-based author Judith Levine said in an
interview.</LD>
<TE>   Levine has been working on the book since the mid-1990s. With the
recent sex scandals involving clergy and young people, she acknowledges
it's a particularly challenging time to make her case that American youth
are entitled to safe, satisfying sex lives.</TE>
<TE>   Publisher after publisher rejected the book--one called its contents
"radioactive"--before the University of Minnesota Press accepted the
manuscript a year ago.</TE>
<TE>   Writes Levine in her introduction, "In America today, it is nearly
impossible to publish a book that says children and teenagers can have
sexual pleasure and be safe too."</TE>
<TE>   From the outset, officials at the Minnesota press knew the book would
be controversial; they had the manuscript reviewed by five academic
experts, instead of the usual two, to be sure its contentions were based
on sound research.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the uproar exceeded expectations after the book was condemned
on conservative Internet sites.</TE>
<TE>   "We've never seen anything quite this angry," said the press director,
Douglas Armato. "The book isn't actually out yet. What people are
reacting to is not the book itself, but the idea of the book."</TE>
<TE>   In "Harmful to Minors," Levine argues that abstinence-only sex
education is misguided. She also suggests the threat of pedophilia and
molestation by strangers is exaggerated by adults who want to deny young
people the opportunity for positive sexual experiences.</TE>
<TE>   "Squeamish or ignorant about the facts, parents appear willing to
accept the pundits' worst conjectures about their children's sexual
motives," Levine writes. "It's as if they cannot imagine that their kids
seek sex for the same reasons they do."</TE>
<TE>   Levine said much of the furor over her book stems from an interview
she gave last month to Newhouse News Service, amid the Roman Catholic
Church sex-abuse scandal. Newhouse quoted her as saying a sexual
relationship between a priest and a youth "conceivably" could be
positive.</TE>
<TE>   Levine said this week that she disapproves of any sexual relationship
between a youth and an authority figure, whether a parent, teacher or
priest. However, she believes teenagers deserve more respect for the
choices they make in consensual affairs, and suggests that America's
age-of-consent laws can sometimes lead to excessive punishment.</TE>
<TE>   She cites the Dutch age-of-consent law as a "good model"--it permits
sex between an adult and a young person between 12 and 16 if the young
person consents. Prosecutions for coercive sex may be sought by the young
person or the youth's parents.</TE>
<TE>   "Teens often seek out sex with older people, and they do so for
understandable reasons: an older person makes them feel sexy and
grown-up, protected and special," writes Levine, who had an affair with
an adult when she was a minor.</TE>
<TE>   Several conservative media commentators and activists have accused
Levine of condoning child abuse.</TE>
<TE>   Robert Knight, director of Concerned Women for America's Culture and
Family Institute, is urging the University of Minnesota to fire the
university press officials who decided to publish the book.</TE>
<TE>   "The action is so grievous and so irresponsible that I felt they
relinquished their right to academic freedom," said Knight, who has
described the book as "very evil."</TE>
<TE>   Armato said he has informed university officials about the irate
reaction to the book and explained to them how the decision to publish
was made. He stressed that the book was accepted not out of hopes for a
profit but because the University of Minnesota Press thought its
arguments were worth public debate.</TE>
<TE>   "What we've encouraged them to do is let the book speak for itself,"
Armato said. "The book is very nuanced and very complex."</TE>
<TE>   Levine, a journalist and author who writes often about sex and gender,
has no children of her own. She writes in her introduction that some
publishers felt her book was insufficiently "parent-friendly."</TE>
<TE>   Parents deserve support and respect, but so do young people, she said.</TE>
<TE>   She said the weakening of comprehensive sex education programs has
left sexually active teenagers uninformed about ways to protect
themselves from AIDS and other diseases, and ignorant about
contraception.</TE>
<TE>   "Operating in an atmosphere of complete ignorance, it's very easy to
exaggerate threats and foment fear," she said. "America's drive to
protect kids from sex protects them from nothing. Instead, it is often
harming them."</TE>

<HD>Deaths Put Spotlight on Bouncers</HD>
<DH>Law: Bar patrons who died after confrontations with security staff
point out need for training regulations, officials say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LIZ SIDOTI</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>COLUMBUS, Ohio
</DL>
<LD>A dispute, large amounts of booze and nightclub bouncers proved to
be a deadly combination for Vincent Darling.</LD>
<LD>   The 41-year-old Army veteran died shortly after he was struck in the
neck during a scuffle with security personnel at a restaurant. The
coroner, who noted that Darling was severely intoxicated, ruled the
December death a homicide. No charges have been filed.</LD>
<LD>   Similar deaths have prompted lawmakers in some states, including Ohio
and Iowa, to introduce legislation that would encourage businesses to
teach bouncers how to do their jobs peacefully.</LD>
<TE>   "Training these people about how to handle confrontations without
resorting to violence can save lives," said Robert Smith, a San Diego
police officer and nightclub security consultant. "Their job is no
different than a police officer, so why aren't they given some of the
same tools?"</TE>
<TE>   Most states don't require or even recommend that bar and restaurant
security personnel--bouncers or doormen--undergo any training, even
though they work where alcohol is served and there is potential for
confrontation.</TE>
<TE>   Iowa enacted a law in 2000 that allows cities to require bouncer
training in mediation techniques and physical restraint methods as a
condition for obtaining a liquor license.</TE>
<TE>   The law was enacted after Charles Lovelady, 26, died in a
confrontation with two bouncers at a Des Moines nightclub. The bouncers
were acquitted of involuntary manslaughter.</TE>
<TE>   Des Moines, as well as other Iowa cities, require bouncers to spend
four hours in training.</TE>
<TE>   "No one should die in these situations," said Iowa Rep. Charles
Larson, who supported the provision.</TE>
<TE>   Last year in Rhode Island, legislation regulating clubs was introduced
in both House and Senate, but it died when the session ended. The measure
would have required clubs to provide private security from certified
companies.</TE>
<TE>   Bouncers in Alaska must receive the same training as those who serve
alcohol. Bill Roche, chief enforcement officer of Alaska's Alcoholic
Beverage Control Board, said part of the training covers how to control
unruly customers and spot intoxicated people, false identification or
underage drinkers.</TE>
<TE>   Oregon requires anyone working security anywhere receive some basic
training from the public safety department, but it is unknown how many
people have been trained, said Randy Silva, program coordinator for the
Oregon Liquor Control Commission.</TE>
<TE>   Ohio Sen. David Goodman is sponsoring the bill that would recommend
training for bouncers and doormen, after originally proposing that
training be required.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm trying to give these people the opportunity to get this kind of
training without being overly intrusive to small businesses," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Phil Craig, executive director of the Ohio Licensed Beverage Assn.,
supports Goodman's bill.</TE>
<TE>   Under the measure, businesses would be encouraged to train bouncers
because the Ohio Liquor Control Commission would take that training into
consideration when calculating any citation fines against such
establishments.</TE>
<TE>   "Bouncers are there to protect not only the property they are employed
with, but . . . the patrons they're selling the liquor to," said Keith
Carr, an attorney for Darling's family. "This wouldn't have happened had
the bouncer been trained."</TE>
<TE>   No charges have been filed against any bouncers or the Dallas-based
restaurant chain, Dick Clark's American Bandstand Grill, which declined
to comment. Police plan to give the case to prosecutors.</TE>
<TE>   Sean Croce, owner of Doc Rickett's Lab in Monterey, hired Smith, the
security consultant, for about $1,000 to spend six hours teaching the
staff of 30 how to recognize potential problems.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no price tag you can put on what can be taught to people,"
Croce said.</TE>

<HD>FDA OKs Secretin in Pancreas Care</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Doctors struggling to diagnose pancreatic illnesses will soon get a
new aid. The government approved the first synthetic version of the
hormone secretin on Friday.</LD>
<LD>   Secretin is a digestive enzyme best known as a controversial, unproved
treatment for autism. But the substance, derived from pig intestines,
long was used to help diagnose serious pancreatic dysfunction or a
pancreatic tumor called a gastrinoma. Then in 1999, the sole secretin
producer quit selling; dwindling leftover supplies have been available
since then only in clinical trials.</LD>
<LD>   The Food and Drug Administration gave approval Friday to SecreFlo, the
first synthetic secretin, for pancreatic diagnosis. It was classified an
orphan product because only about 15,000 patients a year may need it--but
for them, it is an important diagnostic tool.</LD>
<TE>   "Secretin is still the best way" to diagnose pancreas illnesses, said
Dr. Lilia Talarico, FDA's gastrointestinal drugs chief.</TE>
<TE>   The drug's effect on gastrointestinal secretions helps diagnose
pancreatic dysfunction, where thick mucus prevents essential enzymes from
breaking down food. Secretin's effects on another hormone in the
bloodstream can help doctors spot a gastrinoma earlier than with other
tests.</TE>
<TE>   A synthetic version carries less of a risk of allergic reactions,
Talarico said.</TE>
<TE>   Also, the new secretin is 99.6% pure, while the pig-derived product
was only 60% pure, said Edward D. Purich of ChiRhoClin Inc., a
five-person company in Silver Spring, Md., that came up with the
synthetic idea and hired a mix of other companies to help make it
reality.</TE>
<TE>   The drug will be marketed by RepliGen Corp., which is conducting
clinical trials of secretin and autism.</TE>
<TE>   A price has not yet been set, Purich said.</TE>
<TE>   The first batches should begin selling this summer, although he said
doctors can contact ChiRhoClin to get doses sooner for possible
gastrinoma patients.</TE>

<HD>Priest Sex Scandal Is Big Business for N.J. Attorney</HD>
<DH>Justice: Representing victims in abuse cases is a grueling but now
lucrative niche.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN CURRAN</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>MARGATE, N.J.
</DL>
<LD>"God gives only very special people the opportunity to do these
things with a priest," some were told by their molesters.</LD>
<LD>   "It is the most significant honor a lay person could have, to make
love to a priest," others were told.</LD>
<LD>   "You can't tell. Nobody would ever believe you anyway."</LD>
<TE>   Now they are telling. And business is booming for lawyer Stephen
Rubino, who is sometimes moved to tears by the stories of childhood
sexual abuse suffered at the hands of priests.</TE>
<TE>   Rubino, 52, one of the few lawyers specializing in priest sex abuse
cases, has represented about 250 victims, earning a reputation for
tenacity in the United States, Canada, Ireland and Australia.</TE>
<TE>   "They want acknowledgment. They want the perpetrator to admit it and
be held accountable. Their anger is being driven by the stories they're
hearing of the church ignoring the warning signs given to them by
predators," Rubino said.</TE>
<TE>   Every day, more alleged victims come forward. His office fields 10 to
15 e-mail messages or telephone calls daily from would-be clients.</TE>
<TE>   Some are teenagers. Some are in their 70s. They say they were molested
as children and are only now speaking up.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a great lawyer, but this isn't about being a great lawyer. It's
about being an advocate for change," said Jeffrey R. Anderson, a St.
Paul, Minn., a lawyer active in priest sex abuse cases. "In the end,
that's all our clients want and that's what we're working toward."</TE>
<TE>   A Roman Catholic, Rubino attended parochial schools and up until 1987
handled primarily environmental class-action suits and civil rights
cases.</TE>
<TE>   Then one summer day on the beach, a friend of his wife's approached
him with a tale of sexual abuse a 12-year-old relative had suffered at
the hands of a priest.</TE>
<TE>   The acts were so horrific, Rubino initially did not believe they
happened. He took the case, the priest was convicted and jailed, the
victim received a $700,000 settlement and Rubino had a new career.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, he has won settlements ranging from $35,000 to more than
$1 million. In every case, the victims first approached the church to
seek redress and were turned away, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't enjoy it, but there's no way to leave it. I wouldn't mind if
someone else was doing it," Rubino said. "But it must be done. This
behavior has to be exposed."</TE>
<TE>   Justice does not always come quickly. Rubino is working on a case in
nearby Atlantic City that was originally filed in 1994.</TE>
<TE>   "Abuse survivors are tough clients," said David Clohessy of St. Louis,
director of the Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests, a victims
group.</TE>
<TE>   "We are wounded, hurting, distrustful, sometimes impatient people.
It's one thing to wait for a lawyer to finish a will or a probate matter
so you can get the money. It's totally different to wait for a lawyer to
help you put your life back together, because the emotional stakes are
very, very high."</TE>
<TE>   The church's legal strategies in fighting victims' claims typically
center on the statute of limitations or the First Amendment guarantee of
freedom of religion.</TE>
<TE>   Rubino said the church will not begin to heal until its leaders
apologize in person to victims and listen to their stories.</TE>
<TE>   "Apologies don't count from the pulpit. They don't count from a
spokesperson, they don't count from a press release. They only count in
person," he said. "I learned that in first grade, from Sister Mary
Adele."</TE>

<HD>Information Flows on Volcano Risk</HD>
<DH>Geology: Researchers are getting closer to pinpointing not only the
timing of an eruption, but the lava's path.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CAROLYN THOMPSON</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>AMHERST, N.Y.
</DL>
<LD>Technology being developed at the State University of New York at
Buffalo has the potential to identify not just when and where a volcano
might erupt, but for the first time, the path of its destruction.</LD>
<LD>   Researchers say their work could save the lives of thousands of people
worldwide who live in the shadows of volcanoes.</LD>
<LD>   "There are people who are studying these volcanoes all the time and
making the forecasts of when it's going to erupt, and then everybody's
happy it erupts," said geology professor Michael Sheridan, part of a
multidisciplinary team of researchers. "Well, it erupts and then comes
down and kills the people, so the outcome is not a happy outcome, and we
are trying to focus on that."</LD>
<TE>   The research involves a blending of mathematical modeling, geologic
simulation, scientific computing and virtual reality. Three-dimensional
simulations of three active Mexican volcanoes are being created,
including the most active one in Colima, about 300 miles west of Mexico
City, which has been spouting smoke and ash. Nearby villages have been
evacuated.</TE>
<TE>   The detailed simulations of Colima, Popocatepetl, considered the
planet's riskiest volcano, and Pico de Orizaba, North America's tallest
volcano, will show scientists and the general public which way lava, rock
and mud could fall during an eruption. The technology, which can be
applied to other volcanoes throughout the world, is meant to help public
officials determine which areas to evacuate and the best routes to take.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a huge jump forward," said Sheridan, who has spent the last
decade developing small-scale computer simulations of geologic activity
in Mexico and has been honored by the Mexican government for his
assistance.</TE>
<TE>   Eventually, researchers hope to make the real-time information
available to everyone via the Internet, giving people the ability to
click on a map to determine whether their road or even building is in
harm's way.</TE>
<TE>   Vulcanologist Shan de Silva said it is a shared goal among volcano
researchers to develop an effective warning system.</TE>
<TE>   "That's an aim a lot of people have, to produce a product that is
easily disseminated and readily available to local authorities," said De
Silva, chair of the Space Studies Department at the University of North
Dakota at Grand Forks. The department's Volcano World Internet site
tracks volcanoes worldwide.</TE>
<TE>   Scientists pointed to a 1985 eruption of Nevado del Ruiz in Colombia.
The debris flow killed 26,000 people. Although a hazard map outlining
safety zones existed for the area, the residents were unaware of it.</TE>
<TE>   The project, which has the cooperation of several Mexican institutions
and the U.S. Geological Survey, is being conducted under a three-year,
$1.9-million grant from the National Science Foundation's Information
Technology Research Program.</TE>
<TE>   The purpose of the grant is to take advantage of technology so that a
tragedy similar to the one in Colombia does not happen again, Sheridan
said.</TE>
<TE>   De Silva said the technology would be useful to give people a "first
order" idea, but he cautioned the data must be interpreted by the holder
correctly.</TE>
<TE>   "If you don't know what the model is telling you, you run the risk of
just using it on face value," he said. "What [models] are very useful for
is giving a general idea of volcano hazards."</TE>
<TE>   Abani Patra, principal investigator on the grant, said the complexity
of volcanoes requires that scientists from a broad range of disciplines
be involved. The University at Buffalo, with its "supercomputing"
capabilities and access to expansive geographical information, is one of
few places equipped to conduct such research. It is also the only college
currently focusing on mitigating volcano disasters.</TE>
<TE>   Researchers estimate their initial predictions will be accurate about
half the time, but they expect the numbers will improve with time and
continued work.</TE>

<HD>Tortoises Nudge Cattle Out of Grazing Land</HD>
<DH>Preservation: A half-million acres of federal lands are being
cordoned off by officials to save a threatened species, and ranchers
aren't happy about it.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RENE SANCHEZ</AU>
<BD>WASHINGTON POST</BD>
<DL>BARSTOW
</DL>
<LD>The cowboys on Dave Fisher's ranch have an unwelcome new chore:
They are wrangling to save a reptile.</LD>
<LD>   In cattle roundups like none other in the West, they saddle up at
daybreak and set out for hours along rocky trails that wind through miles
of grazing land here in the Mojave Desert, searching for cows that may be
unwittingly wiping out small indigenous tortoises.</LD>
<LD>   The work is rough and slow, and Fisher, a grizzled rancher who prefers
the old rules of the open range, would rather not bother with it. But for
the first time, he has no choice.</LD>
<TE>   "The environmental folks," he said, "are changing everything."</TE>
<TE>   It all began last month. After years of lawsuits, studies and court
hearings, Fisher and every other cattle rancher in the Mojave are being
forced to remove herds from nearly a half-million acres of federal
grazing land during the six months that the imperiled desert tortoises
emerge from burrows to mate and forage for food.</TE>
<TE>New Turf Wars Are Heating Up</TE>
<TE>   The range may never be the same in this blazing, barren mountainous
region 150 miles east of Los Angeles--the latest battleground in the
West's chronic conflict over public land. Conservation groups are engaged
in new fights over protections won for threatened species in recent
years, and land interests that say their livelihoods are being ruined by
such campaigns hope a sympathetic White House will defend their cause.</TE>
<TE>   To keep cattle away from tortoises, federal land managers are erecting
fences across long stretches of grazing areas. Once a week, they patrol
for cows now considered trespassers on turf they have long roamed.
Ranchers, who face fines and other penalties if they fail to comply with
the regulations, are shutting off water wells in some areas in the hope
of moving herds.</TE>
<TE>   Environmentalists say the steps aren't too much to ask of ranchers to
help save the desert tortoise, which the federal government declared a
threatened species more than a decade ago. They say grazing cattle can
crush tortoises or their burrows, eat vegetation they need to survive and
trample ground plants they use to hide from desert predators.</TE>
<TE>   The tortoises, about a foot long, are also vital to the health of
desert wildlife, biologists say. Other species use their burrows as homes
too. The tortoises live underground when the desert climate is harsh but
come out during the spring and fall, when ranchers now must clear out
their cattle.</TE>
<TE>   By some estimates, hundreds of tortoises could once be found on every
square mile here. Now the tally, at best, is dozens.</TE>
<TE>   "Livestock is certainly not the only threat these tortoises face. It's
just the most unnecessary threat, and the one that we can most control,"
said Daniel Patterson, an ecologist with the Center for Biological
Diversity, which has led the fight to limit grazing in the Mojave. "All
ranchers have to do is move their herds off some of the land for some of
the year. It's a real reasonable deal, and it's what's most in the public
interest."</TE>
<TE>A Solution With Consequences</TE>
<TE>   But ranchers say they're reeling from the restrictions. The difficult
terrain and limited water supply make moving cattle from such large
swaths of land complicated and expensive, they say.</TE>
<TE>   Some ranchers contend the new rules could cost them several hundred
thousand dollars, forcing them to reduce the size of their herds or drive
them out of business altogether.</TE>
<TE>   "This is giving us a real hard time," said Ron Kemper, whose cattle
graze on 150,000 acres. "You just can't step outside and say, 'Come here,
cows.' I really think some people hope this makes us all go bankrupt and
leave the land."</TE>
<TE>   Officials in San Bernardino County, where most of the Mojave lies,
support the ranchers. Some say environmentalists are exaggerating the
trouble that cattle cause and contend the tortoises face much more danger
from ravens and the growing army of weekend warriors driving off-road
vehicles through the desert. They also worry the restrictions will harm
the local economy.</TE>
<TE>   Bill Postmus, a county supervisor, sees even bigger stakes: The clash
is in many ways a struggle over what the priorities of the West should
be, he said. "It's not just about a few old ranchers out here."</TE>
<TE>Change in Command Renews Debate</TE>
<TE>   The desert tortoise's plight has long been a subject of intense
federal debate. Near the end of the Clinton administration, after years
of scrutiny into what ails the species, the Bureau of Land Management
negotiated a settlement with environmental groups that had sued to limit
grazing in the Mojave.</TE>
<TE>   Ranchers were supposed to be ordered off sensitive land last spring.
But after dispatching investigators to the desert and spotting cows all
over newly restricted areas, environmental groups charged that the
federal land agency decided to ignore the agreement after President Bush
took office.</TE>
<TE>   They returned to court and won another victory when U.S. District
Judge William Alsup, a Clinton appointee who oversaw the settlement,
accused the Bush administration of violating "the letter, the spirit and
everything about" the limits on grazing. Alsup threatened to hold federal
officials in contempt and ordered the process to begin last fall.
Furious, the ranchers appealed.</TE>
<TE>   But an administrative judge appointed by the Interior Department to
hear the case upheld the earlier ruling, although he said the BLM did not
adequately consult with the ranchers about the change coming to the
range.</TE>
<TE>   Some ranchers appealed again and won temporary reprieves last fall
just as they began removing cattle. Since then, ranchers have reached an
uneasy truce over the issue and are cooperating with BLM officials. A few
are still plotting legal strategies to try to overturn the grazing
limits.</TE>
<TE>   Local authorities have feared the tense dispute would erupt into
violence, but none has been reported.</TE>
<TE>   "So far, so good," said Larry Morgan, a conservationist with the BLM's
Mojave office. "This is a big adjustment for everyone. The ranchers are
pushing the cattle out, but in some places there's nothing to stop them
from going right back. It's hard on them, and it's hard on us to get out
there and monitor what's going on."</TE>
<TE>   Environmentalists say they doubt federal officials are enforcing the
grazing limits and are sending their own investigators into the desert.</TE>
<TE>   "We realize things aren't going to change overnight," Patterson said.
"But we're not going away on this issue."</TE>
<TE>   Fisher, whose family has been ranching in the Mojave since the 1920s,
sounds both defiant and defeated about the new policy. He is president of
the local cattlemen's association and says all the talk on the range
these days is about whether to keep fighting or to give up and sell.</TE>
<TE>   He now must keep his 400 cows off 65,000 acres. Until BLM officials
finish building a fence stretching 12 miles across the land he uses, he
has cowboys working dawn to dusk to get cattle off the restricted area.
Many of his cows are native, he said, and don't want to leave the only
water spots and trails they know.</TE>
<TE>   "We've never been kept out of our spring country before," Fisher said.
"And when they want to start taking away my family's livelihood like
this, I've got to say, 'Whoa.' But heck, I suppose what's happening is
also probably just inevitable. It's all changing out here."</TE>

<HD>Angel Island's Hidden History</HD>
<DH>Immigration: A restoration project uncovers painful experiences of
those who followed their dreams to 'Gold Mountain.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DEBORAH KONG</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>ANGEL ISLAND, Calif.
</DL>
<LD>As their ships steamed through the Golden Gate in the early 20th
century, Chinese immigrants dreamed of opportunities awaiting them on
"Gold Mountain," as they called America.</LD>
<LD>   But instead of docking at San Francisco's fabled shores, they were
shuttled onto ferries and sent to Angel Island in the middle of the bay.
At the immigration station there, dreams of paradise quickly clashed with
reality.</LD>
<LD>   Many languished within a few miles of their destination for weeks,
sometimes carving melancholy poems into the walls of rough barracks while
their fate hung in limbo. In the station's earliest days, the Chinese had
to use a segregated entrance to the hospital.</LD>
<TE>   Details of Angel Island's difficult past--like the separate entrance
and a new trove of poems--are now being uncovered by researchers
examining the site and sifting through the National Archives and National
Park Service records as part of a restoration project.</TE>
<TE>   Their discoveries are adding texture to survivors' stories of
discrimination and grim circumstances at the immigration station, which
operated from 1910 to 1940.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like an archeological dig," said Katherine Toy, executive
director of the Angel Island Immigration Station Foundation. "The part
that we're at now is how do you go about uncovering a hidden history to
dig for a deeper story."</TE>
<TE>   Toy's group, founded by descendants of Chinese who were detained on
the island, is hoping to tell a more complete story by restoring the
station to the days when it was the Ellis Island of the West--the main
gateway into the United States for immigrants journeying across the
Pacific.</TE>
<TE>   The foundation is at the beginning of an estimated $32-million,
eight-year project with the California State Parks and National Park
Service. A team of historians, architects and others is combing through
archives and probing the barracks, hospital and heating plant for clues
to the past.</TE>
<TE>   About 1 million immigrants were processed on Angel Island, far fewer
than the 12 million who went through Ellis Island between 1892 and 1954.</TE>
<TE>   But unlike Ellis, where immigrants usually waited three to five hours
to be processed, the average stay for Chinese immigrants on Angel Island
was two to three weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Japanese, Korean, Filipino, Indians, Portuguese, Mexican and Russian
immigrants also went through Angel Island, but the Chinese were generally
kept the longest while officials determined if they were eligible to
enter the United States.</TE>
<TE>   Under the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882, Chinese laborers were not
allowed to enter the United States. Exceptions were made for wives and
children of American citizens, merchants, students, diplomats and
tourists.</TE>
<TE>   Although relatively few who made it to Angel Island were turned away,
the wait and uncertainty could be agonizing.</TE>
<TE>   "The kind of interrogation, the kind of treatment, is so abusive and
so inhumane that it's just no comparison" to the Ellis Island experience,
said Ling-Chi Wang, director of Asian American Studies at UC Berkeley.</TE>
<TE>   Albert Wong was 11 when he made the 21-day journey from his southern
China village to join his father, a U.S. citizen and owner of the
Oriental Cafe in San Jose.</TE>
<TE>   When Wong arrived in San Francisco in June 1934, he and about 30 other
Chinese were ferried to Angel Island and put in barracks. In a room of
about 100 men, Wong slept on the top mattress of a triple-decker bunk
bed.</TE>
<TE>   The doors were locked, armed guards patrolled the halls and chain-link
fences covered the windows. Detainees were allowed out only for meals and
to exercise in a dirt area surrounded by a 12-foot fence topped with
barbed wire.</TE>
<TE>   "Time goes very slowly because everybody is just waiting for that
interrogation," said Wong, who was detained for about five weeks. "We
were treated very harsh, more like criminals than immigrants."</TE>
<TE>   Wong, now 80, remembers that the Chinese were confined to separate
dining halls and sleeping quarters. Angel Island consultant Daniel Quan
recently discovered evidence of further segregation in the immigration
station's early days, in a letter from the station's architect.</TE>
<TE>   "The entrance for the Chinese and Japanese to their quarters is
entirely separate and distinct from the Europeans' entrance to the
hospital and their wards, practically making two distinct buildings,"
architect Walter Mathews wrote in a 1906 letter to the immigration
commissioner general, describing his site plan.</TE>
<TE>   After the hospital was remodeled sometime between 1911 and 1912,
traces of the segregated entrance were erased. A window replaced the
Asian entrance; a wall and an empty room occupy the area that was filled
by the Asian staircase.</TE>
<TE>   A 1907 San Francisco Chronicle article discussed plans for providing
water to the station, then under construction. Freshwater would be drawn
from a spring and brought in by barges. Saltwater pumped from the bay
"will be used for bathing purposes in the Asiatic quarters," the article
said.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think it was lost on the immigrants that they were being
treated differently," Angel Island Park Supt. Nick Franco said.
"Experiencing a saltwater shower versus a freshwater shower, I'm sure,
was pretty unexpected and pretty demoralizing."</TE>
<TE>   Immigration inspectors often asked detainees minute details about
their lives in China in an effort to weed out those who were trying to
enter under false pretenses, then compared their answers to those given
by relatives. Wong recalls that inspectors asked him how many steps led
from his hillside home to the orchard where he played.</TE>
<TE>   In the women's barracks, 18-year-old Lowshee Miu waited for 21 days
before she was allowed to join her husband on the mainland.</TE>
<TE>   "You just stay in and sleep," said Miu, now 90. "A couple of ladies,
they were really sad. They were always crying."</TE>
<TE>   As they waited to be interrogated by immigration inspectors, Chinese
men carved their sorrows on the barrack walls. One poem reads:</TE>
<TE>   How was I to know I would become a</TE>
<TE>   prisoner suffering in the wooden building? . . .</TE>
<TE>   When my family's circumstances stir my</TE>
<TE>   emotions, a double stream of tears flow.</TE>
<TE>   Saved from demolition in 1970 when a park ranger noticed the Chinese
calligraphy, the worn wooden walls tell immigrants' feelings of anger,
despair and ambition.</TE>
<TE>   While documenting the poems, researchers recently discovered there
were dozens more than the 135 that had been translated earlier.</TE>
<TE>   "Every one of those things is a separate voice," Quan said. "If we
really take the time to analyze all of those different things, there's
going to be a lot more history that comes out of there."</TE>
<TE>   They also found more voices from the past in the hospital. After a
researcher found a 1910 letter complaining of immigrants' writing on the
hospital walls, state park interpreter Darci Moore ran over to the
decaying building with a flashlight.</TE>
<TE>   Beneath peeling plaster, amid the green algae and mold spreading
across the walls, she found pencil drawings of birds and a bit of Chinese
graffiti.</TE>

<HD>Returning to Earth From Heaven's Gate</HD>
<DH>Faith: Suicide cult's sole survivor applies lessons of its leader,
who he says really was from another planet. He sees himself as a
messenger, but also 'a slave to commerce.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SETH HETTENA</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After three years of regimented life within the Heaven's Gate cult,
Rio DiAngelo walked away in 1997 because of a "disturbing" feeling that
he needed to escape.</LD>
<LD>   One month later, he received a message from Heaven's Gate members that
drew him back to the group's rented hilltop mansion in Rancho Santa Fe.
On March 26, 1997, DiAngelo uncovered the worst mass suicide on U.S.
soil.</LD>
<LD>   Five years later, DiAngelo is keeping the faith he shared with 39 men
and women who believed they were shedding their earthly "containers" to
catch a ride on a spaceship trailing the Hale-Bopp Comet.</LD>
<TE>   "I'm really the only one left," said DiAngelo, 48, of Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   The group's possessions have been auctioned off. The 9,000-square-foot
mansion in one of San Diego's northern neighborhoods was sold for a
fraction of its value and the street where it stands has been renamed.
But five years later, DiAngelo, or "Neody" as he was known in the group,
still sees himself as its messenger.</TE>
<TE>   Interviews with news organizations five years ago left DiAngelo angry
at the media, but he reluctantly agreed to a phone interview recently.</TE>
<TE>   Now a freelance designer who makes ergonomic items, DiAngelo is
applying all he learned from Heaven's Gate to his earthly life and, at
the same time, cashing in on it. DiAngelo is auctioning off the cult's
van on eBay to mark the anniversary of the mass-suicide.</TE>
<TE>   The androgynous-looking men and women of Heaven's Gate downed a lethal
concoction of pudding or applesauce spiked with vodka and barbiturates.
They sealed their fate by placing plastic bags over their heads.</TE>
<TE>   Clad in black outfits with "Away Team" patches and Nike tennis shoes
with their trademark comet-like swoosh, each packed a small bag and
carried identification, $5 and money for their journey toward what they
believed was a "level beyond human."</TE>
<TE>   Two other cultists later followed with similar suicides.</TE>
<TE>   "They weren't trying to kill themselves because of a crazy idea,
although some people saw it as a crazy idea," he said. "It really is an
advanced level of being."</TE>
<TE>   Cult leader Marshall Applewhite reportedly checked into a mental
hospital in the 1970s and asked to be cured of his homosexuality. But
DiAngelo says the leader, known as "Do" in the group, answered the
questions he spent years asking. He says Applewhite truly was from
another planet and taught DiAngelo to be more aware, honest and sensitive
to the world around him: in short, a better person.</TE>
<TE>   "What I've gained from this group is phenomenal," he said. "If he is
just a gay music teacher from Texas, how he could teach all these
advanced ways of being that really work?"</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, DiAngelo is not sentimental about the past. The
former cult member has spent the last five years relearning the way of
the world "like a born-again virgin." And now he's cashing in.</TE>
<TE>   DiAngelo is asking a minimum of $39,000 for a 1992 Ford van, with
185,000 miles on the odometer, that members of Heaven's Gate once used
for road trips to SeaWorld and Las Vegas.</TE>
<TE>   "It's just a piece of machinery," he said.</TE>
<TE>   His life today is far from his days in Heaven's Gate, where members
watched selected TV programs in assigned seats and wrote the "individual
needs department" when they ran out of deodorant.</TE>
<TE>   He earns his living working for various companies in the nation's
second-biggest city, slogging his way through daily traffic jams.</TE>
<TE>   "Here I am a slave to commerce like everybody else," he said.</TE>
<TE>   He no longer refers to his body in the third-person as "my vehicle" or
"this vessel," as he did five years ago. He has reestablished contact
with his 19-year-old son, a college student living in Orange County, and
the two now have regular contact, DiAngelo said.</TE>
<TE>   And in an example of his newfound wisdom, DiAngelo said a tabloid
offered him $1 million for exclusive rights to his story five years ago,
but he refused, preferring to preserve the dignity of his departed
friends. Today, he says, he'd take the money.</TE>

<HD>Weekend Paleontologists Just Love Getting Down and Dirty</HD>

<DL>DENVER
</DL>
<LD>Rita Ervin was a mom at home for more than 30 years before she
started excavating dinosaur fossils, using pickaxes and paint brushes.</LD>
<LD>   "I wasn't sure I could do this," she said. "Little did I know I'd be
unearthing bones and studying with professionals, and loving every minute
of it."</LD>
<LD>   Ervin, 53, from nearby Aurora, recently completed the amateur
paleontologist program at the Denver Museum of Nature and Science. The
program offers hands-on training at fossil excavation sites and classes
that include research methods, report writing, geology and vertebrate
paleontology.</LD>
<TE>   Richard Stucky created the program in 1990, and has seen teenagers,
brain surgeons, bankers and retirees come through. Most continue to
search for fossils on their own and go on digs years after they graduate.</TE>
<TE>   "The best part about the program is you don't need any experience,"
Stucky said. "In fact, many of the students didn't know a thing about
paleontology. They just have loved dinosaurs since they were kids."</TE>
<TE>   The two-year program is run mostly by museum staff. Tuition costs as
little as $700 depending on classes, which are taught in the evenings.</TE>
<TE>   Students are required to take field trips, camping out at digs in
Utah, the Dakotas, Wyoming and Colorado. They even help scout for fossils
and collect data.</TE>
<TE>   Volunteers must work in a laboratory located within the Prehistoric
Journey exhibit. They use dental picks, air scribes and paint brushes to
free fossils from their plaster and rock casings. The fossils are then
pieced together for the exhibit.</TE>
<TE>   Bob Rushforth, a 57-year-old chemical engineer, graduated four years
ago and continues to volunteer at the lab and go on digs.</TE>
<TE>   "I work at a computer all day in an office. Then I come here and I
have a chance to use my hands, and it's refreshing," he said as he
cleaned a fossil from the Triassic period.</TE>
<TE>   Children and parents lined the glass windows of the lab asking
questions about the fossils Rushforth and volunteer Sue Meyer were
cleaning.</TE>
<TE>   "I am learning all the time," Meyer said while touching up a fossil
from an Ankylosaurus, an 18- to 22-foot plant-eater with a club-like
tail. "And I get to impart a little dinosaur knowledge on others. It's a
great job."</TE>
<TE>   About 160 amateurs have graduated. Some go back to college for
advanced degrees in paleontology and geology, and many have published
papers in scientific journals.</TE>
<TE>   Former student Carol Weiskof even had a new species of a giraffe-like
dinosaur named after her. She helped dig up a Cedarosaurus Weiskopfae
skeleton at Arches National Park in eastern Utah.</TE>
<TE>   Graduate Bruce Young has found at least five sites that have yielded
bones. Most recently, he found the body armor of an Ankylosaurus on the
property of a computer company in suburban Broomfield. He also discovered
the tooth of an unidentified carnivorous dinosaur.</TE>
<TE>   Students studied the geology of each site to create the exhibit. Some
of their findings are on display at the museum. Exhibit walls and rooms
are set up as different prehistoric periods, and aim to explain the
science behind the birth and extinction of plant and animal species
before human evolution.</TE>
<TE>   The rooms are crammed with dinosaur skeletons, many of them pieced
together with real bones found by museum volunteers.</TE>
<TE>   "I love this place," said 9-year-old Rachel Seiff of Grand Junction.
"I studied dinosaurs last year in school and it's so interesting to see
what they look like in real life."</TE>

<HD>Bush Demands Israel Pull Out; Sharon to 'Expedite' Offensive</HD>
<DH>Mideast: Despite the pledge to wrap up the incursion, fighting
intensifies in the West Bank, killing 27 people.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EDWIN CHEN</AU>
<AU>PAUL RICHTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>CRAWFORD, Texas
</DL>
<LD>President Bush, showing his exasperation as Israeli tanks continued
to roll through the West Bank, demanded Saturday that Israel withdraw
"without delay" from the Palestinian cities it has occupied in several
days of outright war.</LD>
<LD>   "I don't expect them to ignore [me]," he said. "I expect them to heed
the call."</LD>
<LD>   After aiming those sharp words at the Israelis during a news
conference here, Bush followed up with a 20-minute phone call to Prime
Minister Ariel Sharon. "He told the prime minister that he meant what he
said: that Israel needs to withdraw without delay," an administration
official said.</LD>
<TE>   Sharon promised that he would wrap up his military incursion into
Palestinian cities "as expeditiously as possible," the official said, but
there was no immediate sign of a rollback.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, the fighting in the West Bank intensified Saturday as
Palestinian gunmen in Nablus and in a seething refugee camp in Jenin put
up the fiercest resistance yet to an offensive that Israel says it
launched to halt a wave of suicide bombings. At least 26 Palestinians and
one Israeli soldier died in the battles.</TE>
<TE>   Thus, on the eve of Secretary of State Colin L. Powell's urgent peace
mission to the region, the president found himself grappling with
Sharon's seeming defiance, a posture that threatened to undermine what is
already a profoundly difficult task for the Bush administration.</TE>
<TE>   If it continues, the fighting could jeopardize the administration's
new peace initiative and strain the U.S.-Israeli alliance, analysts said.
Yet Sharon would be damaged politically if he were seen as following U.S.
orders to withdraw.</TE>
<TE>   "Today's situation runs the risk of aggravating long-term bitterness
and undermining relationships that are critical to any hope of peace," a
State Department official said.</TE>
<TE>   Bush injected himself directly into the crisis for the first time
Thursday, calling on Israel to pull back its troops but without attaching
a deadline. On Saturday, the president used stronger language,
summarizing his position at one point with just three words: "Withdraw
without delay."</TE>
<TE>   Despite Bush's seemingly unambiguous demand, he didn't identify a
precise time or date for Israel to begin withdrawing. Analysts said the
absence of any publicly declared deadline could give Sharon enough wiggle
room to save face at home while appearing to be cooperative with the
White House. Still, an administration official quoted by Associated Press
described the two men's conversation as "pretty brutal."</TE>
<TE>   The president made his public remarks during an appearance with
British Prime Minister Tony Blair, who is visiting Bush at his ranch in
Crawford.</TE>
<TE>   The president's manner and tone clearly suggested a growing impatience
with the continuing turmoil in the region despite the emerging U.S.
intervention. He sought to strike a balance in his latest remarks,
demanding anew that Palestinian authorities "order an immediate and
effective cease-fire and crack down on terrorist networks" and declaring
that Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat "has failed in his
leadership."</TE>
<TE>   But as protests against Israel's military actions spread across the
Arab world and Powell prepared to leave for the Middle East, Sharon's
inaction was the immediate problem, as Bush's phone call suggested.</TE>
<TE>Israel Needs to 'Make Progress Now'</TE>
<TE>   Bush told Sharon that a withdrawal of Israeli troops could improve
Powell's chances of defusing the crisis in the region, an administration
official said here on condition of anonymity.</TE>
<TE>   "He told the prime minister that Israel needed to make progress now
and that Israel needed to defuse the situation so that diplomacy can
work," the official said. "The president called him as a friend to
express his deep concern about events in the region and to express
support as someone who cares about the future of the region."</TE>
<TE>   Bush has put the administration's prestige on the line, said Gordon
Adams, director of the security policy studies program at George
Washington University. If Israel continues to defy the U.S. call for a
withdrawal, "he's got a problem. . . . It could blow [the Powell trip]
up."</TE>
<TE>   Powell's mission is aimed partly at enlisting Arab countries to
pressure Arafat to help end the terrorist bombings that provoked Israel's
declaration of war. But if Israel's anti-terrorist offensive continues,
it will be all but impossible for Arab leaders to pressure Arafat.</TE>
<TE>   Widespread Arab anger has already made it difficult for Arab leaders
to cooperate publicly. And for the Bush administration, which has the
broader goal of lining up Arab support for a global war on terrorism and
possible strike against Iraq, the stakes go well beyond the
Palestinian-Israeli conflict.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts noted that Sharon is under sharply conflicting pressures.</TE>
<TE>   The operation in the West Bank is popular at home with an Israeli
public that has grown increasingly eager for action against the
Palestinians as the suicide bombings have left them shaken.</TE>
<TE>   Yet it threatens to open a fissure with the Bush administration and
within Congress and elsewhere in American society, where there have been
signs of impatience with Israel's military action, Adams said.</TE>
<TE>   "This is tricky for Sharon," Adams said. "He could lose a lot in the
United States."</TE>
<TE>   Blair, while backing the president's call for an Israeli withdrawal,
appeared to sense Bush's annoyance and moved to head off any further
tensions between the U.S. and Israel.</TE>
<TE>   "I think most people in Israel will realize that they don't have two
greater friends in the world than the United States of America or
Britain," the prime minister said. "But we are also trying to help secure
a way out of the present impasse, so that we can get into a political
process where some of these underlying issues can be resolved.</TE>
<TE>   "So I believe that Israel will heed the words of President Bush."</TE>
<TE>   Despite strong doubts among the British public about a Western strike
against Iraq, Blair also strongly backed Bush's desire to oust Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein.</TE>
<TE>   "The issue . . . cannot be ducked. It is a threat. It is a danger to
our world, and we must heed that threat and act to prevent it [from]
being realized," Blair said.</TE>
<TE>   "All options are on the table," he said. "Doing nothing . . . is not
an option."</TE>
<TE>Bush Praises Clinton's Mideast Efforts</TE>
<TE>   Bush was more blunt.</TE>
<TE>   "We support a regime change," he interjected. "I think 'regime change'
sounds a lot more civil, doesn't it? The world would be better off
without him." Also Saturday, Bush took pains to praise former President
Clinton for trying to bring peace to the Middle East, saying he didn't
want to leave unchallenged any impression that he had blamed his
predecessor for the current crisis.</TE>
<TE>   In a Thursday interview, Bush had expressed his opposition to
convening a peace summit, saying that failures of such conferences in the
past had led to renewed violence in the region.</TE>
<TE>   On Saturday, Bush put the blame for past failure on Arafat, saying the
Palestinian leader "has not lived up to the promises he made . . . to
fight off terror."</TE>
<TE>   He added: "I appreciate what President Clinton tried to do."</TE>

<HD>Middle East Conflict Blurs Bush's Anti-Terrorism Focus</HD>

<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Since the shock of Sept. 11, President Bush has pursued a sharply
focused foreign policy agenda with single-minded zeal: Terrorism was
civilization's mortal enemy, he said, and his historic mission was to
stamp it out, beginning in Afghanistan and moving on to Iraq.</LD>
<LD>   "My job isn't to try to nuance," Bush said recently. "My job is to
tell people what I think. And when I think there's an axis of evil, I say
it. I think moral clarity is important."</LD>
<LD>   But Bush's one-track agenda appears to have been hijacked by events in
the Middle East--and by Arab and European allies who want less attention
to moral clarity and more to the nuances.</LD>
<TE>   As a result, the president finds himself stepping grimly into the
nuance-ridden landscape of the Arab-Israeli conflict. On Saturday, that
meant taking the unfamiliar step of scolding Israel for ignoring his plea
to withdraw its tanks from the West Bank.</TE>
<TE>   The president has continued to make his larger aim clear: to keep the
global war against terrorism on track. That still includes overthrowing
the regime of Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, Bush said Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   But the Bush administration's road to Baghdad now appears to run
through Jerusalem.</TE>
<TE>   The uproar over Israel's military offensive in the West Bank could
endanger the stability of Egypt and Jordan, key allies that the United
States wants on its side for any action against Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   Stopping the fighting between Israelis and Palestinians will be
difficult enough. But as Vice President Dick Cheney discovered on his
trip through Europe and the Middle East last month, none of the United
States' major allies is yet willing to join in a public threat of war
against Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   If the road to Baghdad leads not only through Jerusalem but also
through Riyadh and Paris and Moscow, it might be a long journey.</TE>
<TE>   "Almost every Arab state and the Europeans were uncomfortable with the
logic of the war on terrorism and where it was taking them," said Leslie
H. Gelb, president of the Council on Foreign Relations. Refocusing on the
Arab-Israeli conflict "was a way to reestablish the old game. And they
won."</TE>
<TE>   "We had some clarity with Bush's proposition that a terrorist is a
terrorist," Gelb said. "But as soon as you go back to foreign policy as
usual, you're back to fighting and talking at the same time. And that's
going to make it difficult to maintain the cohesion of the war on
terrorism."</TE>
<TE>   In a sense, Gelb said, the Bush administration has run up against the
limits of U.S. power to persuade allies--let alone adversaries--to adopt
American priorities for the world. "The limits were always there," he
said. "But people refused to recognize them through the first
triumphalist months of the war."</TE>
<TE>   "The lesson is that the United States can do anything that depends on
our military strength, but it's much harder to get anything done when it
depends on the political strength of others," said Michael Mandelbaum of
Johns Hopkins University's School of Advanced International Studies.</TE>
<TE>   "The coalition against terrorism never did amount to much," he said.
"We did most of the fighting. There was never any indication that the
same coalition could be mobilized against Saddam Hussein.</TE>
<TE>   "We see the limits of superpower power not just in the Arab Middle
East, but in Afghanistan and Pakistan," he added. "It's one thing to
roust the Taliban. It's quite another to put together an Afghan
government stable enough to survive . . . or to persuade the government
of Pakistan, a government that's presumably friendly, to act against
terrorists."</TE>
<TE>   To Democratic foreign policy experts, the administration's struggle
with the ambiguities of the Middle East was an occasion for both
satisfaction and sympathy.</TE>
<TE>   "What happens to this administration happens to everybody; they came
up against reality," said James B. Steinberg, an aide to President
Clinton. "When you run for office, it's tempting to have a clear-cut,
fairly black-and-white view of the world. It makes for a more effective
campaign, and it gives clarity. Then, when you come into office, it
becomes complicated.</TE>
<TE>   "Then 9/11 happened," Steinberg said. "It seemed it [was] a new
opportunity to return to the black-and-white world. It suited the tenor
of the times and the president's instincts and made it easy again; it
allowed a simplified vision of national strategy."</TE>
<TE>   With the president's decision to get involved in the Middle East,
Steinberg said, he in effect acknowledges that the focus on the war
against terrorism is too narrow a framework.</TE>
<TE>   "What they recognized, which they had shown no awareness of until now,
is that it's in the U.S. interest to have stability between Israel and
its neighbors in a way that is independent of Israel's interests," he
said. "So when we said we can't want peace more than the parties, that
was wrong. We actually do want peace more than the parties, but for
independent reasons."</TE>
<TE>   To some of Bush's conservative allies, however, the president's shift
in focus was cause for concern.</TE>
<TE>   "It looks like an administration tough enough to wage war in
Afghanistan and target Iraq could not withstand a few days of heckling
from the European Union and the New York Times," William Kristol and
Robert Kagan complain in an upcoming issue of the Weekly Standard, a
conservative magazine.</TE>
<TE>   "How would the president have liked it--how would the American people
have liked it--had someone stepped in after two weeks of the war in
Afghanistan and said, 'Enough is enough'?" they write, quoting Bush's
statement on the Middle East.</TE>
<TE>   "President Bush needs to stay focused on Iraq," they write. "Many of
those who want him to become deeply and personally involved in the Middle
East peace process also want him to do nothing about Saddam Hussein. . .
. We trust the president will see and avoid this trap."</TE>
<TE>   Bush aides say the president is in no danger of abandoning his focus
on Iraq--and Bush confirms it by talking about Hussein every chance he
gets.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't imagine people not seeing the threat and not holding Saddam
Hussein accountable," the president said Saturday after meeting with
British Prime Minister Tony Blair. "History has called us into action."</TE>
<TE>   A European diplomat in Washington, in comments that could come as
solace to worried conservatives, agreed that the core of Bush's
anti-terrorism foreign policy is still intact.</TE>
<TE>   "The framework remains the fight against terrorism," he said, noting
that his own government has occasionally been critical of Bush. "Within
this framework, they have to make adjustments and take into account the
opinions of the rest of the world. But the boat is going in the same
direction."</TE>

<HD>Arabs Threaten to Snub Powell if He Doesn't Meet Arafat</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL SLACKMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>CAIRO
</DL>
<LD>The United States may hope to enlist Arab nations to help negotiate
a cease-fire between Israelis and Palestinians, but Arab leaders are so
furious with the West, they have discussed boycotting meetings with
Secretary of State Colin L. Powell when he visits the region this week.</LD>
<LD>   The message of anger and frustration was delivered Saturday in the
form of a communique after an emergency foreign ministers meeting of the
Arab League.</LD>
<LD>   The ministers closed ranks behind besieged Palestinian Authority
President Yasser Arafat, called on the United Nations Security Council to
intervene in the crisis and insisted that Israelis--not
Palestinians--were committing acts of terror.</LD>
<TE>   "We warn that we will not meet with any U.S. envoy who does not meet
Arafat, and we ask, how can Powell come and meet [Israeli Prime Minister
Ariel] Sharon the terrorist and not meet Arafat?" Palestinian Cabinet
Minister Nabil Shaath said in opening remarks to the conference. "I ask
that all Arab capitals refuse to welcome Powell if he doesn't meet
Arafat. The U.S. has to respect the Arab countries and their struggle in
the face of Israel."</TE>
<TE>   Powell has said he has no plans to meet with Arafat.</TE>
<TE>   Shaath made his comments before President Bush sternly ordered Israel
to withdraw its forces from the West Bank "without delay."</TE>
<TE>   At a typically fractious event of competing agendas, one point
everyone managed to agree on here was that it was time to get tougher--if
not necessarily tough--with the United States. The rhetorical attacks on
Israel were largely recycled. But the league stepped up its condemnation
of the U.S. and did so by name.</TE>
<TE>   The final statement said the meeting "affirms that the biased
treatment accorded to Israel on the part of some states, particularly the
U.S., makes Israel's actions as a state above international law and U.N.
resolutions. . . . It therefore calls upon these states . . . to show
awareness of the need to preserve [their] interest in the Arab region,
and to avoid further aggravating the frustration and anger of the Arab
people."</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration has said it doesn't want to make the same
mistake the Clinton administration did at the Camp David peace talks in
2000 by negotiating the conflict in a vacuum, with Israel and the
Palestinian Authority alone in a room with the U.S. president. Instead,
Bush has dispatched Powell to the region with orders to stop first in
some Arab states as part of an effort to bring the Arab community into
the administration's corner.</TE>
<TE>   That may be the plan, but even before the foreign ministers gathered
here, it was clear that the United States was becoming increasingly
unpopular among the Arab public and was shouldering almost as much blame
for the Israeli military operation as the Jewish state.</TE>
<TE>   Bush's Rose Garden speech Thursday did little to help the
administration's cause.</TE>
<TE>   Not only did the president turn off many Arab listeners with the first
half of his speech, in which he strongly criticized Arafat, but he also
alienated many with his insistence that suicide bombers weren't martyrs
but instead were "murderers" for blowing themselves up near Israeli
civilians.</TE>
<TE>   Bush spoke of such matters as secular, practical ones, while to many
people in the Mideast, martyrdom is a definition left to religious
leaders, not politicians.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, the Arab League opened its meeting Saturday with this passage
from the Koran: "Do not say of those who die in the name of Allah as
dead; they are alive with their Lord."</TE>
<TE>   In characterizing Bush's speech, the English-language Egyptian Gazette
ran a banner headline Friday in red ink declaring, "U.S. Harps on Blaming
Arafat." In the government-funded Al Ahram, Egypt's largest daily
newspaper, a Page 2 cartoon Friday showed two men in conversation:
"Didn't I tell you that Washington is the capital of Israel?" one man
said. The second replied, "You stupid man, it is Tel Aviv that is the
capital of America."</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, the Muslim day of prayer, religious leaders around the
region called on the public to demonstrate against Israel--and America.
And demonstrate they did, in the tens of thousands. In tiny Bahrain,
protesters even breached security at the U.S. Embassy and torched several
cars.</TE>
<TE>   Anti-American feelings have even surfaced in Kuwait, which is eager to
support U.S. policy in the region out of gratitude to America, which led
the war to liberate it from Iraq more than a decade ago.</TE>
<TE>   "I can find no explanation for Washington's policy toward what is
taking place in Palestine," Subhi Ghandour wrote recently in the Kuwait
daily Al Rai al Am. "Unless perhaps, the Sept. 11 events have also caused
a concussion of sorts in the minds of U.S. decision-makers."</TE>
<TE>   Outside the Arab League headquarters in the center of Cairo, a small
crowd of protesters chanted slogans such as "America, remove your army!
Tomorrow the Arab army will step on you!"</TE>
<TE>   Banners called for boycotting U.S. goods.</TE>
<TE>   Even away from the demonstrations and the political forums, there was
a sense that the United States had betrayed the Arab community.</TE>
<TE>   "After Sept. 11, the United States asked the Middle East to stand
behind it in its war against terrorism, and almost all the Arab states
did," said Ahmed Abu al Hassan, 39, a Cairo plumber. "Why now won't
America stand behind the Arab world in its war against terror?"</TE>
<TE>   The Arab League has long come up short in developing a cohesive plan
for addressing problems in a substantive way. It has even failed, over
nearly half a century of discussion, to develop an Arab common market. So
expectations weren't high for the foreign ministers' gathering Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, given the extent of the Israeli military attacks, and
the hot feelings on Arab streets, the ministers faced pressure to do
something.</TE>
<TE>   But just as in the recent Beirut summit, where the league's leaders
bickered before eventually endorsing a Saudi peace initiative, Saturday's
meeting fell far short of unity. Almost inevitably, hard-line states such
as Iraq and Libya clashed with more moderate states such as Jordan and
Egypt. Foreign ministers from Lebanon and Syria didn't even attend the
meeting.</TE>
<TE>   In the end, the ministers issued two documents, an action plan and the
communique. The action plan essentially called on the United Nations and
the European Union to pressure Israel to back off and to send in
peacekeepers to protect the Palestinians. The communique underscored the
idea that Arabs see Israelis as terrorists--and Palestinians as brave
resistance fighters.</TE>
<TE>   After the meeting, an Egyptian journalist asked Amr Moussa, the
league's secretary-general, why the final document did not call for
firmer action, such as imposing an oil embargo, as some hard-line states
had sought.</TE>
<TE>   Moussa replied: "This issue has been discussed during the
[conference], and there are other pressure cards that we could use. They
have all been taken into consideration and will be used when the time is
appropriate."</TE>
<TE>   Outside, the small but loud crowd chanted: "We don't want form and
condemnation! We want the gun and the shell!"</TE>

<HD>Crackdown on Terror Funding Is Questioned</HD>
<DH>Finance: U.S. officials say a lack of evidence and fighting among
agencies have hampered the drive.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSH MEYER</AU>
<AU>ERIC LICHTBLAU</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>The U.S. government's much-touted financial war on terrorism has
been hamstrung by bitter turf battles among federal agencies,
questionable evidence against targeted Middle Eastern groups and a lack
of cooperation by foreign allies, senior government officials said.</LD>
<LD>   In recent months, President Bush and his top Cabinet members have
hailed the U.S. government's effort to "shut down the money pipeline" as
an increasingly important, and successful, component of the broad
counter-terrorism strategy in the United States and abroad.</LD>
<LD>   But privately some administration officials are voicing growing
concern that the strategy isn't working as advertised.</LD>
<TE>   "You read the papers and it seems like everything is going great,"
said one senior law enforcement official. "But this is no way to run an
investigation. And the worst part is that this is the biggest case in
existence. And so much is at stake."</TE>
<TE>   Debate over the problems has occurred at the highest levels, according
to interviews with more than a dozen law enforcement, intelligence and
counter-terrorism officials familiar with the financial crackdown. Among
the concerns:</TE>
<TE>   * Infighting between the Justice and Treasury departments has spawned
two parallel and often conflicting bureaucracies pursuing financial
investigations of suspected terrorists, sending confusing signals to law
enforcement and intelligence agencies here and abroad over who is in
charge.</TE>
<TE>   Privately, some Treasury and Justice officials blame each other for
refusing to work together, withholding information and lacking the
required financial training, even as both concede that the current system
squanders precious resources, money, time and investigative leads.</TE>
<TE>   * At least some of the financial crackdowns on groups with suspected
terrorist ties, resulting in the freezing of tens of millions of dollars
in assets, were launched prematurely or based on insufficient evidence.</TE>
<TE>   The asset seizures have triggered lawsuits from targeted groups, as
well as a backlash from Muslims who say they are being unfairly branded
as terrorists. Some prosecutors now say they are concerned about whether
the seizure cases will hold up in court.</TE>
<TE>   * The United States is receiving far less cooperation than it needs
from many allied nations, which have pledged to help choke off the
terrorist money supply but lack the political will, technical know-how
and legal framework to make that happen.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, the financial crackdown risks being little more than a
symbolic effort because only a tiny fraction of the money believed to be
supporting terrorist activity resides within U.S. financial institutions.</TE>
<TE>   * Key financial provisions of last year's Patriot Act, which granted
authorities broader powers to track suspected terrorist money, are too
unwieldy and unrealistic.</TE>
<TE>   The law subjects an array of businesses--from currency transfer and
exchange firms to pawnbrokers and even car dealerships--to new auditing
and reporting requirements to help authorities detect potential terrorist
activity. The legislation gives an April 24 deadline for the new
regulations, but many businesses say they have no system for taking on
their expanded role as money cops, and authorities complain that they
will be overloaded with information.</TE>
<TE>   Leaders of the financial war on terrorism acknowledge the
investigations' shortcomings, but they point to success in some areas.</TE>
<TE>   The campaign has been instrumental, for instance, in determining who
was behind the Sept. 11 attacks and in establishing connections among the
19 hijackers and other co-conspirators around the world. It also has
provided a clearer picture of how Osama bin Laden's Al Qaeda network and
other terrorist organizations operate, officials said, adding that the
financial component of the war on terrorism ultimately could prove to be
instrumental in U.S. efforts to avert another attack.</TE>
<TE>   "Naturally, there are a few growing pains, but I don't detect a
systemic problem here," Deputy Treasury Secretary Kenneth Dam said
Friday. "No doubt there will be glitches here and there, but that doesn't
detract from the point that it's just an incredible joint effort, and
it's made a major impact on Al Qaeda and their ability to finance
themselves."</TE>
<TE>   Last week, FBI Director Robert Mueller said the crackdown has damaged
the ability of Bin Laden and other suspected terrorists to keep their
operations going.</TE>
<TE>   Dam, Mueller and other high-ranking leaders say they base those
assessments on classified information, intelligence and other indicators
that, as Al Qaeda's funding dries up, its cells are withering on the
vine.</TE>
<TE>   So far, authorities have frozen more than $100 million in alleged
terrorist money, about $70 million of it overseas. Several major
charities have been targeted for allegedly helping terrorist
organizations, as have currency transfer businesses that are popular
means of routing money from the United States to Africa and the Middle
East.</TE>
<TE>   But others involved in the investigation say they couldn't name any
cases in which criminal charges have been brought in the United States
directly related to the post-Sept. 11 funding of terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   And some said Al Qaeda's operations are too shrouded in secrecy to
gauge the effectiveness of the crackdown, particularly since terrorists
frequently use gold, diamonds and other noncurrency transactions to fund
their activities.</TE>
<TE>   "I would have no idea [how successful the effort has been], and I have
no idea how they would know," one senior law enforcement official said of
those who claim Al Qaeda has been financially crippled. Like many others
involved in the money-tracking effort, the official declined to be
identified by name or even by agency, citing political sensitivities and
interagency conflicts.</TE>
<TE>Agencies Can't Get Together</TE>
<TE>   That official and others said the financial counter-terrorism effort
has been faltering on operational and policy levels. Many fear that the
problems will only get worse unless something is done to streamline--and
de-politicize--the entire initiative.</TE>
<TE>   A bewildering array of law enforcement squads is involved in the
financial investigations, not to mention committees set up to oversee
them, including a high-level panel so secretive that no one will even
disclose its name.</TE>
<TE>   The FBI set up its money-tracking Financial Review Group within days
of the attacks and invited other agencies, including Treasury, the CIA
and the National Security Council, to join.</TE>
<TE>   Within weeks, however, the Treasury Department created Green Quest,
headed by Customs Commissioner Robert C. Bonner, a former U.S. attorney
in Los Angeles. It said the multi-agency panel would lead the effort to
track terrorist financing.</TE>
<TE>   Bonner and Treasury officials say they were following Bush's Sept. 23
executive order that sought to freeze the U.S.-based assets of
individuals and organizations involved with terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   Justice officials counter that the Treasury Department has interpreted
its role too broadly and that the FBI, which is part of the Justice
Department, is supposed to be leading the global effort to staunch the
flow of terrorist funds. The Treasury and Justice departments have opened
hundreds of financial investigations independent of each other.</TE>
<TE>   Things have degenerated to the point where the two FBI positions on
the customs panel are vacant, and the two customs agents in the FBI unit
left and never came back, according to people close to the
investigations.</TE>
<TE>   Treasury's Dam and other top officials said the interagency conflicts
are minimal and simply the natural outgrowth of forcing two massive law
enforcement and intelligence-gathering bureaucracies to work together and
share sensitive and often classified information.</TE>
<TE>   But others remain concerned.</TE>
<TE>   "I just find it absurd, especially in light of what we're going
through, that the agencies can't put this petty [conflict] behind them,"
said one law enforcement official.</TE>
<TE>   At a Feb. 12 congressional hearing, Rep. Doug Bereuter (R-Neb.)
questioned the "behind-the-scenes tug of war" between Treasury and
Justice.</TE>
<TE>   "I am concerned that if parallel financial intelligence databases are
set up, the U.S. government will both spend money unnecessarily and
decrease investigative and enforcement efficiency," Bereuter said.</TE>
<TE>   FBI officials have confidentially proposed merging the two panels, but
the Treasury Department has consistently rejected that idea, sources
said. Treasury Undersecretary for Enforcement Jimmy Gurule says the
groups perform important but separate functions. He says the Treasury
Department is responsible for the broader financial investigation into
terrorism, while the FBI pursues the Sept. 11 investigation and other law
enforcement actions.</TE>
<TE>FBI Request to View Records Is Denied</TE>
<TE>   The two camps are often working at cross-purposes. A few weeks ago,
the Treasury Department denied FBI requests to look at financial records
that the department seized from a New Jersey charity with suspected
terrorist ties. FBI agents had to go to the charity itself to seek
permission to see the records.</TE>
<TE>   Matthew Piers, an attorney for the Benevolence International
Foundation USA, agreed to the request because, he said, the charity has
nothing to hide. Piers said the episode struck him as bizarre and
symptomatic of what he described as the flimsy case the Treasury
Department has brought against the charity in freezing $800,000 in assets
and crippling the organization's relief efforts in Asia and Europe.</TE>
<TE>   He called the Treasury Department's methods draconian and noted that
no criminal charges have been filed against the charity or its employees.</TE>
<TE>   The Treasury Department alleges that Benevolence's chief executive has
ties to radical Islamic fundamentalists.</TE>
<TE>   "They're wrong," Piers said. "It's just plain and simple a case of
mistaken identity."</TE>
<TE>   If authorities think the executive has suspected terrorist ties, Piers
asked, "why have they not even questioned him? Why haven't they picked
him up?"</TE>
<TE>   Treasury officials refuse to discuss the case or details about any of
the orders blocking the assets of more than 190 individuals, charities
and businesses. The orders are often based on evidence that Treasury
officials say is classified and not available to the accused.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, a federal judge in Chicago supported the use of such
evidence when he allowed government attorneys to present their case
against another charity, Global Relief Foundation, without its lawyers
present. The hearing was part of Global Relief's lawsuit to recover about
$1 million in frozen assets.</TE>
<TE>   Dam and Treasury General Counsel David Aufhauser said they are
satisfied that there is ample evidence underlying all of the Treasury
Department's searches and its orders freezing assets. Aufhauser also said
all of the orders were issued after thorough investigations and
consultation with the Justice Department.</TE>
<TE>   But others within the administration dispute that. Sources who asked
not to be identified said the Justice Department has expressed concerns
to senior Treasury officials about the strength of the asset-freezing
cases, as well as the lack of coordination.</TE>
<TE>   Some officials fear that any evidentiary weakness will become an
embarrassment when organizations whose assets are frozen bring cases in
court here and overseas--and the Justice Department has to defend the
government's position.</TE>
<TE>   "There are going to be huge problems," one law enforcement official
said. In many of the cases, "I don't think there's a lot there. . . .
It's pretty thin."</TE>
<TE>   An official at a separate agency said that, although there may be
legitimate reasons to target many of these groups, he believes the
Treasury Department's rush to take action last fall may have been
"politically driven" and premature. "They were running and gunning," the
official said.</TE>
<TE>   Treasury officials disputed the charge. "The last thing we want to
engage in is political theater," Aufhauser said.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, the Treasury Department has had complaints of its own:
Officials say the FBI repeatedly hampered cooperation. For example, when
it requested intelligence information from the FBI last fall to prepare
orders for freezing assets, some of those requests were never acted on,
officials said. Only when higher-ups intervened did the Treasury
Department get the requested information.</TE>
<TE>A Parade of Official Visits to U.S. Allies</TE>
<TE>   Several senior law enforcement officials complained that the tug of
war extends overseas as well.</TE>
<TE>   As evidence that U.S. allies are getting mixed messages about the U.S.
operation, they cited the separate trips to Europe and Asia by Atty. Gen.
John Ashcroft, FBI Director Mueller, Treasury Secretary Paul H. O'Neill
and other top-level officials to talk up the financial war on terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   The Treasury and Justice departments also have been quietly sending
employees overseas to press U.S. allies into doing more to help in the
financial crackdown. Those include legal experts who are trying to help
the countries establish the legal frameworks needed to follow through on
any seizures. And technical consultants are working with those
governments and private banks to set up the appropriate computer systems,
officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Other nations "are asking for additional proof" of wrongdoing by
suspected terrorists, charities and other businesses before acting,
Aufhauser said.</TE>
<TE>   One of those countries is Switzerland. On a recent trip to Washington,
Switzerland's attorney general, Valentin Roschacher, complained that U.S.
officials told him to freeze the assets of several suspected terrorist
organizations but then said they couldn't hand over the underlying
evidence because it is classified.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials also said some of their allies, including some
suspected of having a major terrorist presence, such as Saudi Arabia,
Pakistan and the United Arab Emirates, are dragging their feet for fear
of a backlash from their Muslim populations.</TE>
<TE>   Amid all the logistical problems, an even more troubling question has
begun to emerge: How much good can tracking terrorist money really do?</TE>
<TE>   Everyone agrees that financial investigations are critically important
in uncovering, and even thwarting, terrorist activity. Credit card, phone
and travel records and other forms of payment can be used to identify
those involved in a conspiracy, to establish links between them and other
co-conspirators and to gather evidence.</TE>
<TE>   But much of the current focus appears to be on examining the entire
universe of financial transactions for signs of terrorist activity, which
many investigators liken to searching for a needle in a haystack the size
of Nebraska.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities note that the 19 hijackers were able to carry out the
Sept. 11 attacks on a budget of about $500,000, without any of their
financial transactions triggering red flags.</TE>
<TE>   "This was the Super Bowl of terrorist acts, and even in retrospect,
knowing what we do now, we would never have caught that," one law
enforcement official said.</TE>
<TE>   Oliver "Buck" Revell, a former top FBI official and counter-terrorism
expert, was equally skeptical that monitoring the flow of money will
prevent another terrorist attack: "I think you need to do it, but it's
not going to stop them."</TE>

<HD>Spain's Bulldog on the Bench Is Loved, Hated</HD>
<DH>Europe: The judge has been a fearless foe of terrorism and graft.
Some question his methods.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SEBASTIAN ROTELLA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MADRID
</DL>
<LD>Once a year, Judge Baltasar Garzon comes out from behind the
bodyguards and bulletproof cars of his vida blindada, the "armored life"
endured by endangered crime fighters in the Spanish-speaking world.</LD>
<LD>   Wearing cleats and goalie gear instead of a designer suit, Garzon
takes the field at a pro soccer stadium for an annual celebrity game he
organizes to benefit anti-drug charities.</LD>
<LD>   It's a risk. The list of potential assassins is long. Garzon has
prosecuted Basque and Islamic terrorists, Spanish Cabinet ministers and
police chiefs, South American tyrants, drug lords, weapons traffickers
and thugs of assorted nationalities.</LD>
<TE>   But the judge plays soccer the way he leads police raids, climbs
mountains, dances flamenco at parties, dabbles at bullfighting and
travels the world: with abandon.</TE>
<TE>   It takes a certain personality to throw yourself around in front of a
goal. You have to be tough and quick. It doesn't hurt to be cocky, a bit
reckless. You are the difference between triumph and disaster, a leader
who is profoundly alone at the moment of truth.</TE>
<TE>   At 46, Garzon is one of the most admired and criticized law
enforcement officials in Europe and Latin America. And a born goalie.</TE>
<TE>   "He accepts risk, he understands that risk is something circumstantial
that you accept like rainy or sunny weather," said Judge Tomas Sanz, a
close friend. "If he has to submerge 10 or 15 meters scuba diving in
Acapulco, he submerges. Participating to the utmost. . . . He tries to
enjoy everything, to get to know everything."</TE>
<TE>   In 1998, Garzon ensured his place in history with a stroke of a pen.
He issued a warrant for former Chilean dictator Gen. Augusto Pinochet,
whose 16-month house arrest in London amounted to a revolution for
international law. The attempted trans-border prosecution of
Pinochet--British officials eventually ordered his release--was a warning
shot that echoes in the nightmares of despots.</TE>
<TE>   An investigative magistrate who joined the elite Audiencia Nacional
court in 1988, Garzon has been a decisive, divisive force during Spain's
boom years. Economically and culturally, the country has caught up with
longtime European powers by balancing rich tradition and rapid change.
Garzon embodies modern Spain: brash, stylish, fun-loving, frenetic.</TE>
<TE>Law-and-Order Leftist Has Admirers, Enemies</TE>
<TE>   Garzon, who made a brief foray into politics in 1993, represents a
breed that may seem odd to a U.S. perspective: a law-and-order leftist.</TE>
<TE>   "I think a world can be created that differs from a strict and
voracious globalization that crushes the weakest sectors and creates
poverty and misery," he said recently in a rare interview. "If it's a
choice between economic power and solidarity, I'm inclined toward
solidarity. If being leftist is fighting against corruption, for better
income distribution, responsive public services and an economic power
that doesn't dominate us to the point of losing our identity, then I'm
leftist. If it's rightist, then I'm rightist."</TE>
<TE>   The judge has become a kind of national symbol, evoking paladins such
as the fictional Don Quixote and the real-life El Cid, a medieval warrior
who fought the Moors. Garzon has the courage of El Cid and the idealism
of Don Quixote, his admirers say.</TE>
<TE>   His enemies retort that, like Don Quixote, he is deluded; and that El
Cid, upon closer inspection, was less a gallant knight than a ruthless
zealot.</TE>
<TE>   "He'd like to be everything: president of the world," scoffed
Socialist Sen. Juan Alberto Belloch, a former Cabinet minister and
longtime nemesis. "No post is enough for him. His ambition is unlimited.
. . . His style clashes with what a judge should be. He doesn't do the
job well. There are errors, gaps in his work. He has a comic-book view of
the world."</TE>
<TE>   Although Garzon rarely speaks in public--he granted the interview with
The Times on the condition that he would not discuss open cases--his
critics call him a publicity hound. European investigative magistrates
have high profiles, combining attributes of U.S. prosecutors, judges and
police chiefs.</TE>
<TE>   Garzon's investigations have caught big fish, notably a former
interior minister and security chiefs who were convicted in the mid-'90s
of running anti-terrorist death squads. But he is also accused of filing
spectacular indictments that are whittled down by other courts, with
suspects released or acquitted.</TE>
<TE>   His defenders argue that police bring him hot leads because he is a
pioneer, building innovative cases that test the limits of a changing
justice system--and international jurisprudence.</TE>
<TE>   Most Spaniards praise his fight against the initials of fear: ETA. The
Basque terrorist group has killed more than 800 people since 1968. ETA,
short for Basque Homeland and Freedom, survives in this otherwise
peaceful society because some Spanish leaders believe that it's
politically incorrect to confront nationalist fanaticism, and others are
tacit accomplices of the terrorists.</TE>
<TE>   Not only has Garzon gone after the killers, he broke ground by
targeting ETA's once-untouchable support network: financiers, political
activists, and journalists accused of acting as a sinister intelligence
service.</TE>
<TE>   When it comes to making enemies, the judge is evenhanded. He inspires
hatred among terrorists but also the former anti-terrorist officials he
prosecuted. He irritated the center-right government with a crusade
against repressers in South America, where Spanish firms have
billion-dollar investments. He charged a Syrian arms trafficker in the
killing of wheelchair-bound U.S. tourist Leon Klinghoffer during a 1985
hijacking of a cruise ship by Palestinians, whose cause is dear to
European leftists. The arms merchant was acquitted in 1995.</TE>
<TE>   Garzon's latest exploit: In November, he became the first justice
official outside the United States to lock up Islamic extremists and
accuse them in the Sept. 11 attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Dismantling an Al Qaeda terrorist cell in Madrid, Garzon found links
to the World Trade Center hijackers. The phone number of Imad Eddin
Barakat Yarkas, the cell's alleged boss, surfaced in the apartment of
suspected hijacking ringleader Mohamed Atta in Hamburg, Germany. Barakat
allegedly discussed the attacks in code during wiretapped conversations
before Sept. 11, and allegedly traveled the world meeting with Al Qaeda
leaders.</TE>
<TE>   During a marathon weekend, Garzon interrogated 11 suspects starting at
11 a.m. on a Saturday. About 2 a.m. Sunday, he summoned the final
prisoner, Ahmad Raghad Mardini, and greeted him with a handshake,
according to defense attorney Jacinto Gil.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the late hour, Garzon wore a suit and looked crisp and alert,
said Gil, who was present. The judge asked quiet, precise questions of
Mardini, a Syrian-born shopkeeper with apparently tangential ties to the
case. Garzon was unfailingly polite toward the distraught prisoner,
according to the lawyer.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no pressure on the suspect," Gil said. "In fact, he helps
the suspect express himself. I remember Mardini, with his serious health
problems, had a moment when he could not even talk, so they brought him a
glass of water. [Garzon said] 'Calm down, sir, be calm.' "</TE>
<TE>   Garzon finished with Mardini, who was released without charge, about
2:30 a.m., Gil said. Then the judge lived up to the title of a recent
biography: "Garzon: The Man Who Saw Sunrise." By 8:15 a.m., he had
written the indictment and posted it on the Internet, according to Gil.</TE>
<TE>   Now the judge must prove that his suspects were accomplices of the
hijackers. So far, defense attorneys, say the case seems politically
driven by Spanish hopes of reciprocal U.S. assistance. "What you can see
is really weak," Gil said. "We are paying a price for U.S. help in the
fight against ETA."</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials see Spain as a model anti-terrorist partner. Garzon has
worked closely with U.S. counterparts and admires former FBI Director
Louis J. Freeh.</TE>
<TE>   But Garzon does not applaud the U.S. military campaign in Afghanistan.
A worldwide crackdown by police and intelligence agencies, he said, would
have been better than using troops who so far have not captured Osama bin
Laden.</TE>
<TE>   "What has been achieved?" he asked. "I focus more on the displaced
people, the people who lost their lives, the possible victims of human
rights violations. There are many dictatorial regimes in the world, but
they have not all received the same treatment."</TE>
<TE>   Like many Europeans, Garzon criticized the detention without access to
lawyers of suspected Al Qaeda members at the U.S. Navy base in Guantanamo
Bay, Cuba.</TE>
<TE>   "What does this mean?" he said. "Is this vengeance? Either you are a
terrorist or you are a prisoner of war. Which is it? What will happen
when the evidence from Guantanamo has to be evaluated?"</TE>
<TE>Judge Once Worked as a Gas Station Attendant</TE>
<TE>   Garzon once studied to be a priest. He rarely goes to Mass, but he
retains an air of the seminary. His glasses frame a stare that is solemn
but not pompous. A slicked-back crest of silver hair rises from the
middle of his forehead. He works to keep his thick-set frame in shape,
doing hundreds of sit-ups each morning.</TE>
<TE>   Ideological differences don't stop Garzon from calling the United
States "one of the most attractive countries there is." He lectures at
U.S. universities. His daughter, one of three children, studied in Ohio.
He likes Bruce Springsteen.</TE>
<TE>   Discussing music, Garzon grins and seems suddenly younger. "I really
like Dire Straits too. Mark Knopfler, what a guitarist. It's a shame that
band broke up."</TE>
<TE>   The decor of Garzon's office reflects his eclectic tastes and roots in
the Andalusia region of southern Spain, the home of bullfights and
flamenco. There are paintings of matadors, figurines of jazz musicians,
African and Latin American art, and photographs of Garzon with his
children, with Spanish King Juan Carlos I and with U.N. Secretary-General
Kofi Annan. Beneath a glass coffee table reclines a papier-mache statue
of a clown.</TE>
<TE>   He comes from peasant stock, the son of a gas station attendant.
Garzon paid for his studies with jobs at the gas station and as a waiter.
He married his college girlfriend and became a judge at 25.</TE>
<TE>   By 1993, Garzon had made a name for himself, and the politicians came
calling. Then-Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez, the charming and crafty
patriarch of the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party, invited Garzon to join
and help revive a government that was embroiled in corruption after
advancing an exemplary democratic transition.</TE>
<TE>   Garzon joined the Socialist legislative ticket in a coveted No. 2 spot
behind Gonzalez. After helping the prime minister win reelection, he
became a congressman and deputy interior minister.</TE>
<TE>   The judge says he became disenchanted when Gonzalez failed to clean
house. Critics say Garzon craved a Cabinet post but was blocked by Sen.
Belloch, who took charge of both the justice and interior ministries in
1994.</TE>
<TE>   Garzon resigned, returned to his chambers and resumed a longtime
investigation of government figures involved in death squads, a scandal
that helped topple the Socialists in 1996 after 14 years in power.</TE>
<TE>   Belloch accuses Garzon of pursuing the case as revenge.</TE>
<TE>   "It's preposterous. He shouldn't have been the judge in this matter,"
Belloch said. "The investigation was necessary. . . . But the methodology
was perverse."</TE>
<TE>   Garzon says the experience left him with no political appetite.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm fine where I am," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Speculation persists about his next move. A proponent of the
globalization of justice, he could be a contender one day for an
international justice post, perhaps with a war crimes court or a proposed
international criminal tribunal.</TE>
<TE>   For the moment, friends say, Garzon thrives on cheers he gets from
people on the street, especially in Latin America, which is starved for
heroes.</TE>
<TE>   "I have traveled with him to Mexico, Peru, Brazil, and in those
countries I have seen the great affection and respect and hope that
people feel toward Judge Garzon," Sanz said. "In terms of admiration,
he's a millionaire."</TE>

<HD>Rapid Growth of Advanced Placement Classes Raises Concerns</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>REBECCA TROUNSON</AU>
<AU>RICHARD LEE COLVIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>High school Advanced Placement classes, widely viewed as key to
admission to top-tier colleges, are proliferating so rapidly that many
educators say their quality is being diluted and school resources are
being strained.</LD>
<LD>   Designed to allow the most able students to get an early start on
college work, the program now reaches more than 1 million students each
year and is expanding at an annual rate of about 10%. Those who pass AP
exams can often dazzle college admissions officers, skip introductory
courses and even graduate from college early.</LD>
<LD>   But the program's tremendous growth--fueled by government subsidies
and the owner's aggressive promotion--is generating widespread concern
among education experts, admissions officers, counselors, teachers and
even some students. They fear that some AP classes don't live up to the
program's own high standards or prepare students to enter college with
advanced standing.</LD>
<TE>   "It's a very positive program, but it'll only stay that way if there's
a response to all this pressure for improvement," said Patrick Callan,
president of the National Center for Public Policy and Higher Education.</TE>
<TE>   AP's many supporters and even some critics say that the program, owned
by the nonprofit College Board, has improved academic standards and
teacher training, and has brought a stimulating atmosphere to classrooms.
It is still seen by many as the gold standard in high school education.</TE>
<TE>   But recent developments suggest it is losing some of its luster:</TE>
<TE>   * A recent report by the National Research Council criticized AP and
other advanced math and science classes for covering too much material in
not enough depth. The panel also raised concerns about teacher
preparation, quality control and access to the classes, especially for
minority students and those in rural and inner-city schools.</TE>
<TE>   The report echoed a 2001 study commissioned by the College Board
itself that acknowledged a growing shortage of qualified teachers and
weak academic backgrounds of some AP students.</TE>
<TE>   * Harvard University announced in February that it will award credit
only to incoming students who receive the highest AP exam score--a 5 on a
1 to 5 scale. (Many schools give credit for 3s or above.) Stanford, Yale,
Columbia and the University of Pennsylvania, among others, also are
rethinking their AP policies.</TE>
<TE>   * An elite private high school in New York, the Fieldston School,
recently dropped all AP classes, saying the prescribed curriculum was too
focused on rote learning and detracted from the in-depth study that is
the school's specialty. Other top prep schools are also reassessing its
value.</TE>
<TE>   * Many high school counselors, teachers and students say the courses
are outstripping resources--from classroom space to testing facilities to
the availability of trained teachers. The shortage of qualified AP
teachers could reach 100,000 within a decade, the College Board
estimates.</TE>
<TE>   College Board officials say they are trying to address these concerns
by expanding AP teacher training, establishing clearer guidelines for AP
classes and developing a program to better prepare middle school and high
school students for such classes by boosting their English and math
skills.</TE>
<TE>   Overall, the AP program is still "as powerful an educational engine
now as it has always been," said Jenny Oren Krugman, a Florida-based
College Board official. "We're talking about a program that has given
standards, a real assessment, and allows people to look at their
performance. That said, must it be 100% of the answer to every
educational question?"</TE>
<TE>   While they are committed to addressing the identified problems,
College Board officials say, they also are committed to extending the
reach of the program.</TE>
<TE>   "We think every school and every student should have access to this
program," said College Board President Gaston Caperton.</TE>
<TE>   Established in 1955, the Advanced Placement program enables high
school students to take its semester- or year-long college-level courses
in 19 broad subject areas, ranging from art history to physics. Students
may then opt to take the two- or three-hour exams. At some high schools,
students need a teacher's recommendation to get into an AP course; at
others, any student may sign up.</TE>
<TE>   The demand for AP courses stems largely from intensifying competition
for college slots among children of baby boomers. Lastyear, 820,880
students took nearly 1.4 million AP exams, bringing in $98 million for
the College Board. Nearly six in 10 high schools now offer AP classes.</TE>
<TE>   Nowhere has the program's growth been greater than in California,
where the number of students taking AP classes nearly tripled from 1988
to 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Much of that is because the University of California gives students
multiple incentives to take part in AP. Not only are UC students who pass
AP exams eligible for college credit, a transcript filled with such
classes improves chances of admission, UC officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Since 1984, students in AP or other honors courses also have received
a boost in their grade point averages simply for taking the challenging
classes.</TE>
<TE>   "We wanted to really push students to take more rigorous work," said
Carla Ferri, the UC system's undergraduate admissions director.</TE>
<TE>   For UC applicants, the advantages are so great that in 1999 the ACLU
sued the state on behalf of students at Inglewood High, alleging that its
total of three AP courses was not sufficient. The school now offers 11 AP
sections.</TE>
<TE>   Partly in response to the suit, the state has begun covering most of
the $78 cost of the exams for low-income students.</TE>
<TE>   More and more, students see AP classes as a necessary ticket to
college. One recent morning at North Hollywood High, which offers one of
the most extensive AP programs in the Los Angeles Unified School
District, a line of students stretched out the door of a college
counselor's office. They were waiting to sign up for next month's AP
exams.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't go to a good school unless you have them," explained junior
Diana Aguilar, who signed up for the English, U.S. History and Spanish
language exams, adding to two others she took last year. "It makes you
look smarter to colleges."</TE>
<TE>   At many urban high schools, the classes are the de facto college
preparatory curriculum.</TE>
<TE>   "The AP opens so many doors and it's my responsibility to go through
them," said Crenshaw High School senior Caridad Pena, a Salvadoran
immigrant who credits the program for her admission to UCLA.</TE>
<TE>   But the very urban schools that are under the greatest pressure to add
AP courses often are those that have the toughest times finding, training
and retaining qualified teachers.</TE>
<TE>   Crenshaw, a school with many low-performing students and significant
discipline problems, is hard-pressed to hang on to its teachers
generally, its administrators say, let alone more highly trained AP
instructors.</TE>
<TE>   "What I'm trying to do is develop a bullpen" of teachers to fill in
for those who depart "without sacrificing quality," said Marilyn Gavin,
the school's AP coordinator.</TE>
<TE>   The quality of classes can vary dramatically by school. AP English
classes, for example, typically require students to read extensively from
works by noted authors and write essays.</TE>
<TE>   At Fremont High in South-Central Los Angeles, however, members of the
Academic Decathlon team recently complained that they were expected to do
very little in their AP English classes.</TE>
<TE>   "I [didn't] even read one book the whole semester," said Paola
Valdivia, a Fremont junior. The final exam was to write a "friendly
letter," she said.</TE>
<TE>   The discrepancies among schools show up in pass rates. At Crenshaw,
18% of exams received a passing score of 3 or better, compared with 60%
of exams statewide.</TE>
<TE>   Even at competitive schools such as North Hollywood, some students
worry that they are pressed to take too many AP courses, covering too
much material too fast.</TE>
<TE>   Mia Lee, a 15-year-old senior who will graduate in June and has been
accepted to Stanford, will have taken 13 AP courses by the time she
leaves high school. Already, she said, she can remember relatively little
of what she learned in the courses she took last year.</TE>
<TE>   "You're learning so fast and doing all this intense cramming," she
said. "You forget it all after the test and then wonder if you really
learned anything."</TE>
<TE>   Facilities are stretched too. Counselors at several schools say so
many kids sign up for tests that they must seat them cheek by jowl,
against test protocol.</TE>
<TE>   The courses also contribute to inequities within schools, some
teachers and counselors say. With the best teachers assigned to AP, less
able instructors often teach those who need the help more, said Kati
Haycock, a Washington-based advocate for high academic standards. "In a
high-poverty, high-minority school, it may be that that's a bad use of
resources," she said.</TE>
<TE>   The AP program slipped a bit from its pedestal last year after
Fieldston, a selective school in the Bronx, withdrew from the program and
later found its decision did not harm students' ability to get into top
colleges. The school--backed by a supportive letter from the Stanford
University admissions office--opted to offer in-depth classes designed by
Fieldston teachers rather than the survey courses typical of AP.</TE>
<TE>   Other elite private schools say that they can design better courses as
well.</TE>
<TE>   Peter Gow, the academic dean of Beaver Country Day School in the
affluent Boston suburb of Brookline, says AP courses "probably have
tremendous value for school systems that are perhaps floundering a little
bit and are in search of high standards." But for schools with
established reputations such as his, it's a "misallocation of resources."</TE>
<TE>   Some top colleges are reassessing the AP program as well.</TE>
<TE>   With its announcement in February, Harvard apparently became the first
university to require students to earn 5s on AP tests to receive college
credit.</TE>
<TE>   Harvard's decision was based in part on a study of student performance
in second-year chemistry and economics courses, which showed that
students who had earned 4s on AP tests fared significantly worse in
advanced courses in those subjects than those who had earned 5s. Overall,
in fact, they did worse than classmates who had not taken AP classes in
high school.</TE>
<TE>   At Stanford, admissions dean Robin Mamlet said the university is
considering reducing the amount of total credit--now equal to a full year
of course work--that entering students may receive for AP test results.</TE>
<TE>   Yale, Columbia and the University of Pennsylvania are engaged in
similar, long-term reappraisals.</TE>
<TE>   At Penn, the math department recently decided to award credit only for
the highest score on the toughest AP calculus test after professors found
that some students who had passed the test had little or no understanding
of more basic math concepts, said Eric Schneider, associate academic
affairs director.</TE>
<TE>   A few elite colleges, including Caltech, have never awarded credit for
AP classes. "We feel the course work we offer at Caltech is better than
the course work the students typically take in AP courses," said
registrar Judith Goodstein.</TE>
<TE>   At the nine-campus University of California, attempts to reexamine the
role AP plays across the system have stalled, at least for now, as the
university undertakes a series of separate, sweeping admissions changes.</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, a top UCLA administrator said professors complain
increasingly that many students' AP scores and credits don't match their
performance in class.</TE>
<TE>   "We hear that students may have done reasonably well on an AP test,
but often their level of proficiency is not what we expect of UCLA
freshmen," said Thomas Lifka, an assistant vice chancellor who oversees
admissions.</TE>
<TE>   In response, some UCLA departments have gotten stricter about awarding
credit for middling AP scores or placing such students in advanced
courses, but Lifka said more reform is needed.</TE>
<TE>   UCLA student David Burke, 20, agrees. Burke, who earned senior
standing after only three years because he loaded up on AP credits in
high school, said he sometimes regrets doing so. The political science
and English major said he passed AP math, for instance, but felt so
unprepared for his advanced class at UCLA that he dropped it and enrolled
in the introductory level.</TE>
<TE>   Overall, he said, "I just wish I had spent more time learning in high
school and not studying for the [AP] tests."</TE>

<HD>Mahony's Accuser Describes History of Mental Problems</HD>
<DH>Scandal: Upset about cuts in disability payments, the woman says
she needs compensation.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK ARAX</AU>
<AU>LARRY STAMMER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>FRESNO
</DL>
<LD>A Fresno woman with a history of mental problems said Saturday that
her claim that Cardinal Roger M. Mahony sexually abused her 32 years ago
at a local Catholic high school was short on details and sounded
far-fetched. But she insisted that it was true.</LD>
<LD>   The 51-year-old woman said she was diagnosed with schizophrenia in the
early 1970s, and that she was motivated to press forward with her
allegations, in part, because the state is cutting her disability
payments and she needs a cash settlement from the church.</LD>
<LD>   She also said that nearly everyone she has encountered in her
life--from her parents and other family members to her high school
classmates to her former co-workers--have either molested, abused or
emotionally mistreated her.</LD>
<TE>   She said she never knew Mahony and only had one fleeting contact with
him in 1970--outside the band room during classes at San Joaquin Memorial
High.</TE>
<TE>   "I know it doesn't make sense," she said in an interview Saturday.
Although the woman said her name could be published, The Times generally
does not use the names of those who say they have been sexually abused.
"I can't even tell you when it happened. But I passed out one day near
the band room, and when I woke up my pants were off and then I saw
Mahony's face. And then I passed out again."</TE>
<TE>   When pressed for more details, she stood in the doorway of her
apartment under a large wall rug depicting Jesus surrounded by angels and
said, "I didn't imagine it. It really happened."</TE>
<TE>   Mahony, who was then a priest in Fresno and later became an auxiliary
bishop, categorically denied in a statement Friday "ever having molested
anyone."</TE>
<TE>   E-mails from Mahony and his staff that were obtained last week by the
media indicate that the Fresno diocese had tape-recorded a two-hour
interview with the woman.</TE>
<TE>   "Good work!" Mahony e-mailed his attorneys and media relations
director on March 28. "It will be key to get the [woman's] transcript
into the hands of both the Fresno PD and the LAPD. They should then
interview her themselves."</TE>
<TE>   Fresno police said Saturday they were looking into the allegations,
but could provide few details about the investigation or the woman's
background.</TE>
<TE>   "Regardless of how valid or invalid her allegations are, we have to
take them seriously," said Lt. Mike Guthrie. "It's unfortunate that
allegations of this nature put people's reputations on the line, and that
the answers never come quickly. But we're talking about something that's
32 years old."</TE>
<TE>   The woman said she worked for seven years at a Carl's Jr. in downtown
Fresno and filed one complaint involving alleged verbal abuses at work.
She said the complaint was never investigated by police.</TE>
<TE>   One of her former co-workers at Carl's Jr. said the woman was known
for telling stories of abuse at the hands of co-workers and customers.</TE>
<TE>   "I wouldn't take her word . . .," said Debra Richardson, a shift
manager. "From the time she started here, she has made statements that
all sorts of people were harassing her."</TE>
<TE>   But a manager at the apartment complex where the woman lives by
herself said she was an ideal tenant who distributed candy and cards at
Christmastime.</TE>
<TE>   "She has never been a problem, and the one time she complained about a
tenant with an unleashed dog, it was a legitimate complaint," said Pamela
Flores, a manager of the 220-unit apartment complex behind gates in
downtown Fresno.</TE>
<TE>   Efforts to reach the woman's family were unsuccessful. She said she
does not have an attorney.</TE>
<TE>   She said that her mental problems, despite taking the drug Risperdal
for schizophrenia, have grown worse in recent weeks as unknown people
have knocked on her apartment window and threatened her. (Schizophrenia
is a mental illness in which the victim is unable to tell what is real
from what is imaginary and experiences voices and visions that sound and
look authentic.)</TE>
<TE>   The woman said she was doubtful of her real age because she believes
her birth certificate was doctored by her parents and that they most
likely adopted her.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been molested by a lot of people, and then I slipped on some ice
and lost my job at Carl's Jr. I was the dining hostess and they were
harassing me there too," she said. "Even today, I've got no friends."</TE>
<TE>   The woman said her parents, migrants who left their native Oklahoma
and Louisiana years ago to come to the San Joaquin Valley, are both
deceased and that she has lost contact with her eight brothers and
sisters. She said she had a son who was taken from her years ago by her
mother.</TE>
<TE>   Her apartment is near St. John's Church, where she made her
allegations against Mahony two weeks ago. She said a priest at the church
listened to her story and then reported it to Fresno police.</TE>
<TE>   "I kept it to myself for a long time, and then I saw people on the
news who said, 'If something like this happened to you, come forward,' "
she said.</TE>
<TE>   "Then I got a letter from the state that they're going to cut my
disability to $235 a month. I won't be able to pay my rent. . . . I need
compensation."</TE>
<TE>   The allegations against Mahony, which surfaced Friday night, quickly
made headlines across the country in the midst of what has become a
nationwide child abuse scandal in the Catholic Church.</TE>
<TE>   The scandal erupted in January in Boston, when it was reported that a
priest who had allegedly molested more than 130 boys had been transferred
by superiors from parish to parish. Earlier this year, Mahony removed
eight archdiocese priests involved in past sexual abuse cases and has
refused to release their names.</TE>
<TE>   The e-mails from Mahony and his staff indicate that he was confidant
the accusation against him would not stand up under scrutiny.</TE>
<TE>   He began discussing a strategy for dealing with police and the media
from the first day he learned of the accusation on March 22, the e-mails
show.</TE>
<TE>   He received a telephone call March 22 from Fresno Bishop John
Steinbock, who told the cardinal that a woman had accused him of
molestation. That same day, Mahony reported the allegation to the Los
Angeles Police Department.</TE>
<TE>   "The Fresno PD can call me any time for a telephone interview; they
can tape-record the interview, and I don't need an attorney on the line
since I have no recollection of ever meeting the lady, I welcome the
interview," Mahony e-mailed on March 28.</TE>
<TE>   A day earlier, Mahony sent an e-mail outlining his plans for dealing
with the media once the woman's accusation became public.</TE>
<TE>   "I am sending along an updated possible press release/statement," he
wrote Tod Tamberg, his media relations director. "I agree fully with you:
Should we get any inquiries from the media about the Fresno matter, I
need to hold a press conf. The press conf would do two things: 1. I would
read the statement about Fresno, and respond to questions. Hopefully, we
would have more info about what the Fresno PD is doing, as well as a
transcript of the [Fresno diocese's] interview [with the woman] to hand
out."</TE>
<TE>   When the accusation became public Friday, Mahony issued only a written
statement denying the allegation. No transcripts were given to the media.</TE>

<HD>Bribery Scandal Kicks Up a Controversy in Chinese Soccer</HD>
<DH>Sports: Allegations of corruption in the pro game take the luster
off the nation's upcoming World Cup finals debut.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHING-CHING NI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>HANGZHOU, China
</DL>
<LD>The Chinese felt on top of the world. For the first time, their
national soccer team had made it to the World Cup finals. It was seen as
one more sign that the motherland had come of age on the international
stage.</LD>
<LD>   But before the country could sober up from the surge of nationalism
after last fall's success, a corruption scandal involving game-rigging
and referee-bribing has given this soccer-crazed nation a fresh kick in
the face.</LD>
<LD>   It's the kind of dirty laundry nobody wants to air, especially before
the start in May of the World Cup finals, which will open in South Korea
and Japan.</LD>
<TE>   Match-fixing scandals have on occasion marred the sport in Europe and
Latin America. But it appears that the practice has been more widespread
in China.</TE>
<TE>   The world's most-populous nation can ill-afford to have its image
tarnished. China is in the spotlight as a new member of the World Trade
Organization and the host of the 2008 Olympics. The international
community is looking for signs that this country can respect the rules of
the game and engage in fair play--on and off the field.</TE>
<TE>   "We knew [Chinese soccer] was dirty. But we didn't know it was this
dirty," said Song Weiping, a real estate developer and owner of Zhejiang
Lucheng, a professional soccer club based in this picturesque lakeside
city. He is one of the two whistle-blowers who broke the silence on the
game's open secret.</TE>
<TE>   "It was only after we got into the business that we realized giving
money to referees was standard operating procedure," Song said. "I can
say nine out of 10 referees have been offered bribes or have accepted
bribes. Even the most conservative estimates put the number at 50%."</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps nothing stands out more as a negative trademark of post-Mao
China than corruption. It greases the wheels of fortune in many walks of
life, as the Communist country shifts from central planning to a more
competitive economy. Some reports by Chinese academics put the economic
losses resulting from graft at between 13% and 17% of the gross domestic
product. The issue threatens the Communist Party's legitimacy and social
stability.</TE>
<TE>   And professional soccer, a relatively new business in China, already
has the potential to trigger strife in a nation with an estimated 300
million fans who are prone to staging mass protests or celebrations over
the outcomes of games. Last month, officials temporarily banned
professional games in the city of Xian after fans set fire to stadium
seats and attacked police following a tied game.</TE>
<TE>   The match-rigging scandal might never have come out into the open if
the two club owners had not done what no one else dared: confessed to
their roles in the scheme.</TE>
<TE>   "Of course, there is still the possibility I might go to jail for it,"
Song said during an interview in his chauffeured black Mercedes. "But if
we don't expose it, Chinese soccer will have no future."</TE>
<TE>   So far, the matter remains bogged down in red tape. The Chinese Soccer
Assn., which governs professional soccer, conducted an investigation but
took no action, citing a lack of evidence.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, however, the country's highest court told state media that
game-rigging could be considered commercial fraud and not just a sports
offense, opening the door to possible legal action.</TE>
<TE>   Cynical fans doubt that justice would result from any prosecution.
Some say they admire Song for telling the truth but wonder whether he
would have spoken up if his team had not lost several important games.</TE>
<TE>   The scandal erupted last fall while China was still reveling in World
Cup euphoria.</TE>
<TE>   In a generally low-scoring sport, a Sichuan team hoping to move up in
the standings defeated another team from Sichuan by a lopsided 11-2.</TE>
<TE>   A week later, Song's Zhejiang Lucheng lost a game 6-0, with four of
the goals scored during the final eight minutes. In another game
involving the team, a referee awarded a questionable goal to the
opponents from Shanghai that had been made while Song's players were
still taking their place on the field.</TE>
<TE>   Song fired five of his players, suspecting that they had taken money
from the other side.</TE>
<TE>   "I've never lost in my life 6-0," said Antony Grdic, 26, the team's
Croatian defender. "I'm ashamed."</TE>
<TE>   Public outrage forced the soccer association to act. It slapped six
suspected clubs with fines and suspensions. The latter cost Song 14 key
players and the coach, making it difficult for the team to remain
competitive in the new season, which is underway.</TE>
<TE>   That triggered the counteroffensive by Zhejiang and the Guangdong
Geely club, which led to a scandal labeled Heishao, or Black Whistle. The
name played off the Golden Whistle, an award for best referee of the
year. The allegations focused on the officials.</TE>
<TE>   "The going rate for referees is about $7,300 a game," Song said, a lot
of money in China for part-time referees. "At first, we refused to do it.
But our coach convinced us that if the other team pays up and we don't,
the referee could easily lean in their favor."</TE>
<TE>   So at the very least, a bribe buys a level playing field.</TE>
<TE>   The Guangdong Geely's owner, an auto manufacturer, pulled out of the
club in disgust. The club followed up by suing the semi-governmental
soccer association.</TE>
<TE>   "What we've exposed is old news," said Gui Shengyue, former manager of
the Guangdong club. "As the official governing body, they should have
dealt with it a long time ago."</TE>
<TE>   Association officials insist that they have always been tough on
graft.</TE>
<TE>   "It's impossible to stop referees from accepting bribes overnight,"
said Dong Hua, a spokesman for the Beijing-based association. "We are
doing our best."</TE>
<TE>   Noted a referee who refused to give his name: "If everybody takes a
bribe, is it still considered a bribe? Back in the planned-economy days
we got paid 5 cents a game. Sometimes we got bath coupons as a bonus.
They were worth only a little more than a penny. But at that time, it was
considered a lot. Does that count as taking a bribe?"</TE>
<TE>   The scandal created a whirlwind of public and media attention. At
least two books by reporters covering Black Whistle became bestsellers.
Some referees said the media stirred things up because the sport was
between seasons and news was slow.</TE>
<TE>   Until 1994, Chinese soccer on a national level was just another
lumbering state-owned enterprise. The creation of professional clubs
unleashed the world's largest soccer market from the grip of the state.
Clubs were free to hire and fire players and coaches, including
foreigners. Among them was Bora Milutinovic, a Yugoslav who coached the
Chinese team to victory last October when it qualified for this spring's
World Cup finals.</TE>
<TE>   The emergence of pro clubs caused soccer fever to sweep China. Every
respectable province wanted its own club. Zhejiang province, a
fast-growing economic stronghold on the coast, lacked soccer talent. Its
state-owned team had been disbanded in the 1980s after dismal
performances, and several businesses failed to revive it.</TE>
<TE>   Song emerged in 1997 as a godsend.</TE>
<TE>   "Lots of Chinese people like myself came to know soccer through the
Chinese [national] team's defeats," said Song, 44, a chain-smoking former
teacher who transformed the Zhejiang club into the nation's largest
soccer organization. "Lots of people have wondered how we could help end
this losing streak. When soccer became professional, it was our chance to
be more than a spectator."</TE>
<TE>   The roster of club owners reads like the who's who of big business.
Though most are from state-backed companies--such as the China
International Trust &amp; Investment Corp, the country's biggest investment
firm--private entrepreneurs are increasingly buying in.</TE>
<TE>   Initially, businesses were attracted because team ownership offers
good brand-making opportunity. Tax breaks and favorable government
policies also sweeten the deal.</TE>
<TE>   But most clubs are in the red. They get a small cut of the television
broadcasting rights, which are controlled by the state. Merchandising and
advertising are a far cry from world standards. Ticket prices are low.</TE>
<TE>   Reforms need to happen quick, critics say, before the sport loses its
most valuable asset: the fans. Confidence in the game is already low.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't trust anyone at this point," said Wang Qihao, president of
the Blue Devil Fan Club in Shanghai, which boasts more than 1,700
members. "We feel cheated. Our hearts have been broken too many times. If
our national team hadn't made it into the World Cup this time, a lot of
us simply wouldn't want to watch the game [of soccer] anymore."</TE>

<HD>Afghan Group Denies Plotting Assassinations</HD>
<DH>Asia: Leader of those targeted in a sweep says innocent people were
held. Arrests also are seen as an attempt to sabotage opponents.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBYN DIXON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>KABUL, Afghanistan
</DL>
<LD>Members of a group targeted in a swarm of arrests here stemming
from an alleged assassination conspiracy denied any plot Saturday and
said those seized were involved in legitimate political activity.</LD>
<LD>   The leader of a branch of the Hezb-i-Islami party said hundreds of
innocent people were rounded up in a dawn raid at his compound last week.</LD>
<LD>   "If the authorities had any problems with our party, they should
declare at the beginning that we cannot engage in any political
activities," said the leader, Wahidullah Sabaun.</LD>
<TE>   Sabaun appeared to be under a loose form of house arrest. In the days
since the arrests, intelligence agents have been slouching outside
Sabaun's compound. The agents, still present Saturday, said Sabaun would
not be allowed to leave the house without them.</TE>
<TE>   The arrests created a jittery atmosphere in this capital city
Saturday, two days after authorities claimed to have exposed a plot to
destabilize Afghanistan that called for the assassinations of the
country's interim prime minister, Hamid Karzai, and the former king,
Mohammad Zaher Shah, and attacks on foreigners in Kabul.</TE>
<TE>   About 160 people were still being held.</TE>
<TE>   One figure associated with Hezb-i-Islami, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said the arrests were an effort by some powerful Northern
Alliance members to sideline opponents from Hezb-i-Islami in the lead-up
to a June loya jirga, or grand council, which will decide the makeup of a
future government.</TE>
<TE>   The Northern Alliance, dominated by Tajiks from the Panjshir Valley,
fought the Taliban regime before it fell and now controls the interim
government's key security and military posts. Like the Taliban, the
Hezb-i-Islami group is dominated by Pushtuns, the country's main ethnic
group. Karzai is also a Pushtun.</TE>
<TE>   "If there were not peacekeeping forces in Kabul, Karzai would not be
in power now," the Hezb-i-Islami figure said.</TE>
<TE>   Describing the arrests, he said: "It's the Northern Alliance
Panjshiris trying to dominate. They would get rid of Karzai if there were
not international forces. I don't think the Northern Alliance will leave
power."</TE>
<TE>   He said the aim was to exclude Hezb-i-Islami from the loya jirga and
any future influence in the country.</TE>
<TE>   "Of course, when they are arrested, they cannot be active," he said.
"They'll be out of the scene."</TE>
<TE>   Although the roundup by the authorities seems to be over for now,
those arrested and later released appeared extremely wary in their
comments.</TE>
<TE>   On the record, there were no testy accusations about the arrests and
alleged plot from those detained, just muted criticisms that the
authorities appeared to have made a big mistake.</TE>
<TE>   Deputy Agricultural Minister Walam Mustafa Jawad, who was among those
taken into custody in the raid on Sabaun's compound, said security agents
swept down and seized everyone in sight, including passersby on the
street. Jawad, a former member of the Hezb-i-Islami party, was later
released.</TE>
<TE>   "They were arresting everyone. It was chaos and confusion. The
security intelligence officers did not know who was who," he said. "There
were no dangerous people there."</TE>
<TE>   Officials said Thursday that Sabaun was behind the assassination plot
and had reestablished links with Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, the leader of
Hezb-i-Islami.</TE>
<TE>   Hekmatyar was a moujahedeen commander against the Soviet occupation of
Afghanistan who went on to fight a bitter civil war against other
moujahedeen leaders in the early 1990s over control of the country. After
the rise of the Taliban, he fled the country and his influence waned,
although he reportedly is back in western Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   Sabaun denied any links with the warlord, saying Hezb-i-Islami had
split into two. He said he leads the branch that supports the Afghan
interim government and the upcoming loya jirga, while Hekmatyar leads the
branch opposed to the grand council.</TE>
<TE>   "I have no links with Hekmatyar," Sabaun said. "He hates me."</TE>
<TE>   Sabaun, a former finance minister with the ad hoc Northern Alliance
authority that immediately followed the fall of the Taliban last year,
reportedly was angered when he missed out on a post in the interim
administration. The current government was created in an agreement signed
near Bonn in December.</TE>
<TE>   But on Saturday, he insisted that he supports the government and that
many of those arrested also support the interim administration.</TE>
<TE>   Abdul Aslam, a former member of Hezb-i-Islami, said that because of
the dangerous climate for political opponents, none of those arrested and
later released could speak openly and frankly about what had happened.</TE>
<TE>   "They cannot tell you the truth. They cannot tell you the things that
have happened because of the current situation," he said. "The situation
has become very critical.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone who was opposed to the government was arrested. All these
arrests are based on political differences. They're trying to dominate
each other. They have been rivals before. They're still rivals."</TE>
<TE>   Shahmir Ameri, 31, an advisor at the Agricultural Ministry, urged
journalists to drop their reporting on the arrests, saying it could lead
to "problems"--although he wasn't specific as to what kind of problems.</TE>
<TE>   "There are not too many government opponents in Kabul. There are even
fewer now. They're in jail," he said. "But in the provinces, yes. There
may be opposition there."</TE>
<TE>   Sabaun said Zulmai Khan, a security official from Karzai's office,
visited him at home Wednesday. Sabaun said he had asked the authorities
to free those who are innocent.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not suspicious of the interim government," he said. "Why is the
interim government suspicious of me?"</TE>

<HD>For Mexican Mayor, Road to Presidency Has Two Tiers</HD>
<DH>Transport: Official seeks to add an upper deck to the capital's
expressways to cut gridlock. But he downplays the plan's potential
political payoff.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENNIFER MENA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MEXICO CITY
</DL>
<LD>This Mexican capital has an open secret: Mayor Andres Manuel Lopez
Obrador wants to be the country's next president. But first he needs to
tackle the traffic problem in this auto-choked metropolis before the 2006
elections.</LD>
<LD>   This feisty politician has a plan though, albeit an expensive and
controversial one making headlines here almost daily. He is rushing
through a $900-million project that would add an upper deck above 18
miles of roadways in this city of nearly 20 million people.</LD>
<LD>   The mayor unveiled in December the proposal to build a second tier on
the Periferico and Viaducto expressways. Construction is expected to
begin May 8. So far, the biggest opponents are federal officials, transit
experts and urban planners, not ordinary Mexicans yearning for the day
when they won't confuse a highway for a parking lot.</LD>
<TE>   Good thing Lopez Obrador is not running for office in California,
where many voters fear a repeat of the collapse of Oakland's Cypress
Street Viaduct in the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake. At recent public
hearings on a proposed second tier on the 101 Freeway in the San Fernando
Valley, members of the public came out strongly opposed.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike such nervous Americans, many Mexicans say they can overlook the
fear of earthquakes and other problems if only traffic rolls. The city's
two expressways were built in the 1950s and '60s, and vehicles travel 7
mph on average during rush hour, government studies show.</TE>
<TE>   "We should have already built the second level and be talking about
how to get a third level on. We need to get traffic moving," said
resident Miguel Camacho, a 53-year-old civil engineer who has watched
Mexico City's chaotic growth over recent decades.</TE>
<TE>   The project can reduce traffic, improve air quality and boost the
economy, says the mayor, who sought to downplay its potential role in his
presidential aspirations.</TE>
<TE>   "Many people think this is a very important project and that it could
help a mayor in 2006," he said at a recent news conference. "Just let us
work. The election is not our purpose. This is what the city needs, and
we are going to do it."</TE>
<TE>   The mayor, a member of the leftist Democratic Revolution Party, or
PRD, gained national attention when he lost the 1994 Tabasco state
gubernatorial election amid charges of fraud against his opponent. A
talented public speaker, Lopez Obrador continues to make a mark by
promoting programs that help niche communities, analysts say.</TE>
<TE>   The double-deck project resonates with many voters. When the mayor
asked them to call a toll-free number and give their opinion, 80,000
heeded and 72% said to pop on the second tier.</TE>
<TE>Middle-Class Appeal</TE>
<TE>   But almost everyone--from analysts to taxi drivers to political
opponents--says Lopez Obrador is using the road project to court Mexico
City's middle-class residents, who more often vote for the center-right
National Action Party of Mexican President Vicente Fox.</TE>
<TE>   Federico Estevez, a professor here at the Autonomous Technical
Institute of Mexico, said Lopez Obrador is "showing people that he is
interested in a mega-project with a distribution of benefits. . . . How
many politicians in this country can say they have pushed a project that
is seen positively by the people, the masses? Very few."</TE>
<TE>   The proposal comes after Lopez Obrador and Fox sparred on several
issues, including who should be Mexico City's police chief, whether the
capital should forgo daylight saving time and how the capital should
combat crime. The federal government opposed the second tier.</TE>
<TE>   "The federal government is opposed, but it is more for political
reasons," explained Claudia Sheinbaum, the environmental secretary for
the city's federal district, who serves as Lopez Obrador's spokeswoman on
the two-tier plan. "If the mayor can do a high-profile project that is so
important . . . it will give him great visibility."</TE>
<TE>   Environment Secretary Victor Lichtinger said the national government
is studying whether it can stop the plan, arguing that other projects,
such as a light-rail system or expansion of the subways, would be better
investments.</TE>
<TE>   "When there are scarce resources, projects with the greatest impact
should be chosen," Lichtinger said. "There is a greater need for more
public transportation. This will just increase the use of personal
vehicles."</TE>
<TE>   People who study transportation, smog and earthquakes also have
doubts, believing that Lopez Obrador is moving too fast.</TE>
<TE>   Robert W. Poole, transportation studies director at the Los
Angeles-based Reason Foundation, said a similar project in California
would take as long as 10 years to complete. Lopez Obrador is promising
that the first five miles of the Mexico City roadway will be finished in
less than 10 months.</TE>
<TE>   Although earthquakes downed two-tier roads in San Francisco in 1989
and in Kobe, Japan, in 1995, some Mexicans seem confident. Sheinbaum and
several earthquake specialists said that if certain standards are
applied, motorists have nothing to fear.</TE>
<TE>Air Pollution Concerns</TE>
<TE>   But Sergio Alcocer, research coordinator for the National Center for
the Prevention of Disasters in Mexico City, said he is worried that the
city will choose the lowest bidder for the project instead of the best.</TE>
<TE>   "I fear that if the second tier becomes weathered, its resistance to
an earthquake could be sacrificed," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The bigger question, Alcocer said, is whether the project will reduce
dangerously high levels of smog.</TE>
<TE>   Mario Molina, an atmospheric chemistry professor at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology who has studied Mexico City's pollution, said the
double-deck project "could reduce emissions in the short term, but over
the long term traffic would likely increase and pollution as it attracts
new vehicles. We know from other cities that this eventually happens."</TE>
<TE>   Sheinbaum said officials are studying the possibility of carpool lanes
or bus lanes. In addition, they are beginning other projects, including
subsidies that help van and taxi drivers replace older vehicles to reduce
emissions.</TE>
<TE>   Local officials recognize that the double-deck expressway might not be
the panacea for the city, but they insist that it is necessary to uncork
the traffic bottlenecks.</TE>
<TE>   "When you go [7 mph] in traffic, if you can increase the speed, you
will reduce the pollution at least some," Sheinbaum said. "And you get
people where they need to go."</TE>

<HD>Scientists Skeptical About Claim of Cloning</HD>
<DH>Health: Controversial Italian fertility specialist refuses to
confirm reports of a woman's pregnancy. Some doctors express outrage.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>LONDON
</DL>
<LD>Scientists reacted with skepticism and shock on Saturday to a
report that a woman taking part in a controversial human cloning program
for infertile couples was eight weeks pregnant.</LD>
<LD>   Italian fertility specialist Severino Antinori, who last year
announced his intention to create the world's first human clone, has been
quoted as saying one woman in his program is pregnant--but he has since
refused to confirm or deny it.</LD>
<LD>   "Our project is at a very advanced stage. One woman among the
thousands of infertile couples in the program is eight weeks pregnant,"
Gulf News, an English-language newspaper in the United Arab Emirates, on
Wednesday reported Antinori as saying.</LD>
<TE>   It said Antinori, who did not give any further details, had been
responding to a question at a lecture at the Zayed Center for Follow-up
and Coordination, an Abu Dhabi think tank.</TE>
<TE>   It was unclear if Antinori had clearly stated that the woman's
pregnancy was a result of cloning.</TE>
<TE>   Contacted by telephone Saturday, Antinori said, "I am not talking to
journalists," before hanging up.</TE>
<TE>   There was no information as to where the woman was, or from whom the
alleged fetus was cloned, if it was.</TE>
<TE>   Cloning and fertility experts expressed strong doubts about the
report.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Ehab Kelada, clinical director at the London Fertility Center,
said Antinori must clarify the report immediately.</TE>
<TE>   "The scientific community will be very alarmed," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "If this report is true, it is shocking. We don't know how safe
cloning is for humans, and it is dangerous to embark on this path without
proper regulations or guidelines," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Rudolf Jaenisch, professor of biology and a leading cloning scientist
based at the Whitehead Institute and the Massachusetts Institute of
Technology, said he was extremely angry at the news but very skeptical.</TE>
<TE>   He said the scientific community would have no way of verifying
whether the baby, if it existed, was a clone.</TE>
<TE>   "I do not trust these people to tell us the truth," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "It is totally outrageous and irresponsible to attempt cloning of
humans when we know there is a very high probability of severe
abnormalities, even if the baby survived to birth, which is extremely
doubtful. In fact, death before birth would be the best outcome."</TE>
<TE>   Antinori has been working with Panos Zavos, a former professor at the
University of Kentucky in the United States, to clone fetuses for
infertile couples.</TE>

<HD>Rebels Kill Colombian Whose Son's Dying Wish Was Unmet</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>BOGOTA, Colombia
</DL>
<LD>Rebels have killed the kidnapped father of a Colombian boy whose
plight came to symbolize the callousness of the country's insurgents,
authorities said Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   Leftist rebels shot and killed policeman Norberto Perez and another
officer, Victor Manuel Marulanda, after they apparently tried to escape,
said Gen. Ernesto Gilibert, the commander of the Colombian national
police.</LD>
<LD>   Perez was abducted more than two years ago when fighters from the
Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, or FARC, attacked the small town
where he was posted.</LD>
<TE>   His son, Andres Felipe Perez, who had cancer, later begged the rebels
to free his father so that they could see each other before he died.</TE>
<TE>   The sight of the emaciated boy on national television stirred the
country, prompting offers from prominent Colombians to swap places with
the father and a plea from President Andres Pastrana for the rebels to
show mercy.</TE>
<TE>   The rebels refused and, in December, the 12-year-old boy died.</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't clear whether news of the boy's death ever reached Perez,
who was being held by the rebels somewhere in the jungles of western
Colombia.</TE>
<TE>   "Not only do they kidnap him, they assassinate him after ignoring
calls from his dying son," Gilibert told reporters Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   FARC fighters delivered the bodies of the two policemen to members of
the Red Cross late Friday in the village of Santa Ana in Antioquia
province, 125 miles northwest of Bogota, the capital.</TE>
<TE>   Perez was shot in the head and back. Marulanda, who was kidnapped by
the rebels in June 1999, was shot nine times, Gilibert said.</TE>
<TE>   Lorena Carmona, Perez's wife and Andres' mother, told local radio
Saturday that the officers were killed after they tried to escape.</TE>
<TE>   The FARC rebels are holding about 50 state security force members
taken hostage in recent years during fighting. Hundreds of other
Colombians are kidnapped each year, most of them by guerrillas seeking
ransoms to fund their insurgencies.</TE>
<TE>   The 38-year civil war, pitting Colombia's two main rebel armies
against a paramilitary group and the government, kills an estimated 3,500
people each year.</TE>
<TE>   Violence has worsened in Colombia since February, when the government
ended a three-year peace process with the FARC.</TE>
<TE>   At least eight townships were without electricity Saturday after FARC
fighters blew up four electrical towers in Cundinamarca province,
authorities said.</TE>

</DL>
<LD>Israeli forces launched artillery and air attacks on areas in
southern Lebanon on Saturday in response to the shelling of a village in
the Golan Heights, security officials said.</LD>
<LD>   Men drove close to the Lebanese border and fired five mortar rounds on
an Israeli post near the village of Ghajar, then fled. Police were
looking for the attackers, the officials said.</LD>
<LD>   In Ghajar, an anti-tank shell hit a home, injuring three children ages
3, 6 and 15, the Israeli ambulance service said. Hezbollah guerrillas
fired on one of the ambulances as the wounded were being evacuated,
officials said.</LD>
<TE>   Ghajar lies partly in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights and partly in
Lebanon. Israel captured the Golan from Syria in the 1967 Middle East
War.</TE>
<TE>   Lebanese security officials said Israeli warplanes launched three air
raids on the hills of Kfar Chouba, one mile northeast of Ghajar, near the
disputed Shabaa Farms area.</TE>

<HD>Army Bears Down on 2 West Bank Cities</HD>
<DH>Conflict: Sharon's remarks suggest Israel will try to wipe out as
many militants as it can in the coming days.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD BOUDREAUX</AU>
<AU>CAROLYN COLE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>NABLUS, West Bank
</DL>
<LD>Israel's offensive in the West Bank met its fiercest resistance yet
Saturday as armed Palestinian militants in the labyrinthine alleys of
Nablus' old city and a seething refugee camp on the edge of Jenin fought
off helicopters, tanks and bulldozers.</LD>
<LD>   At least 26 Palestinians and one Israeli soldier were killed Saturday,
most of them in the two Palestinian strongholds, as fighting intensified
despite President Bush's demand for an Israeli withdrawal "without
delay."</LD>
<LD>   Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon, in a phone conversation with Bush
late Saturday, promised instead to "accelerate" the offensive, his office
announced. Sharon told Bush that his army was being slowed by opposition
from "a great deal of weapons, explosives and armed terrorists" and by
its own attempt to avoid civilian casualties.</LD>
<TE>   Israeli officials admit that U.S. pressure will oblige them to curb
the operation before Secretary of State Colin L. Powell arrives later
this week on a cease-fire mission. Sharon's remarks suggest that the army
will step up the operation, which had been designed to last weeks, to
wipe out as many militants as possible in the coming days.</TE>
<TE>   Hundreds of thousands of Palestinians remained trapped in their homes
Saturday, some enduring fierce gunfire without water, electricity or
ambulance services. In Jenin, an unarmed 22-year-old Palestinian man bled
to death within 15 feet of a hospital while Israeli soldiers shot at
nurses who tried to save him, a doctor there reported.</TE>
<TE>   "We're getting information about many people killed or wounded, but
nobody is able to reach them," Jamal Shati, a member of the Palestinian
parliament, said by telephone from Jenin's besieged refugee camp. "We
hear women yelling, screaming. The shelling is constant and hits almost
everything--mosques, nurseries. Nothing is spared."</TE>
<TE>   Elsewhere in the West Bank, Israeli soldiers and Palestinian gunmen
traded fire in Hebron, leaving three Palestinians dead, and at the
besieged Ramallah compound of Palestinian Authority President Yasser
Arafat. In Bethlehem, Vatican and U.S. officials tried to end a 5-day-old
standoff between Israeli soldiers surrounding the Church of the Nativity
and armed Palestinians holed up inside.</TE>
<TE>   Violence also erupted in the Gaza Strip, which has been tense but
relatively quiet during the West Bank offensive. Palestinian militants
attacked a Jewish settlement, prompting an Israeli tank assault on a
nearby village. One Israeli soldier and four Palestinians died in the
clashes, including a 6-year-old girl walking home from her first day at
school.</TE>
<TE>   Israel invaded Palestinian-ruled areas of the West Bank more than a
week ago after a series of suicide bombings killed scores of Israelis.
Tanks and armored vehicles have moved into every West Bank city except
Jericho, occupying most places with only limited resistance.</TE>
<TE>   Not so in Nablus and Jenin. The two cities, 15 miles apart in the
northern part of the West Bank, are home to large numbers of militants
and a number of the recent suicide bombers.</TE>
<TE>   As the Israeli army moved in last week, Palestinian gunmen massed for
a fight in the casbah, Nablus' old city, and the refugee camps on the
edge of Nablus and Jenin. The alleyways in both places are ideal for
urban guerrilla warfare, too narrow for tanks to enter.</TE>
<TE>   The Israeli army tried to overcome that obstacle Saturday by sending
bulldozers into the Jenin camp under the protective fire of helicopter
gunships, destroying at least 40 homes in the cramped settlement of
15,000 people, witnesses said. Other houses struck by Israeli shelling
were said to be in flames.</TE>
<TE>   In Nablus, the West Bank's largest city, troops that had ringed the
casbah with tanks for two days finally moved in on foot Saturday, going
from house to house by rooftop and breaking in from above to search for
gunmen, witnesses said.</TE>
<TE>   Resistance in both cities was described as bloody and round the clock,
with militants laying mines and firing automatic rifles from apartments,
homes and, according to the Israeli army, the minaret of a Jenin mosque.</TE>
<TE>   Jamal abu Haija, a leader of the militant Islamic movement Hamas in
Jenin, told Associated Press that fighters were distributing weapons,
including hand grenades and explosive belts like those used by suicide
bombers, to residents of the refugee camp.</TE>
<TE>   Alarmed by the bloodshed, the Palestinian Authority appealed to the
United Nations Security Council, the United States, the European Union
and humanitarian organizations worldwide "to intervene immediately to
stop the massacres."</TE>
<TE>   Palestinian and Israeli sources listed 15 Palestinians confirmed
killed in Jenin on Saturday, but many more were believed dead, their
bodies inaccessible to ambulances.</TE>
<TE>   "The army has taken up positions outside and will not allow our
ambulances to leave," said Mohammed abu Ghali, a doctor at Jenin
Hospital. "The hospital is running on a generator, but it is running out
of fuel."</TE>
<TE>   Nurses at Al Razi, a private hospital in Jenin, raised white flags as
they ventured outside to try to bring in Mahmoud Haj, 22, who was lying
in the street near the hospital entrance bleeding from gunshot wounds and
crying for help. They were turned back by Israelis firing from a tank,
said Ali Jabarin, a doctor at the hospital.</TE>
<TE>   Four hours later, after negotiations with the Palestinian Red Crescent
Society, the troops finally allowed medical personnel to leave the
hospital, Jabarin said. By that time, the young man had bled to death.</TE>
<TE>   An Israeli army spokesman said he had no information on the report. He
said the soldiers might have been battling gunmen near the hospital at
the time.</TE>
<TE>   In Nablus, Israeli forces also used helicopters that fire machine guns
or rockets to dislodge gunmen from the old city. The Israelis have also
surrounded the Balata refugee camp on the outskirts of Nablus and waged
fierce firefights but haven't gone into the camp, Palestinian witnesses
said.</TE>
<TE>   Four Palestinians were shot dead as they placed explosives along a
road to another Nablus refugee camp, the army said.</TE>
<TE>   Late Saturday in Ramallah, the Israeli army, which has surrounded
Arafat's headquarters, fired an armor-piercing antitank missile at the
building where the Palestinian leader is trapped. A senior Arafat aide
said four bodyguards were wounded.</TE>
<TE>   The army said the missile was fired in response to gunfire from within
the compound.</TE>
<TE>   Nabil abu Rudaineh, the aide who is at Arafat's side, told Arabic
television that the missile landed inside the Palestinian Cabinet meeting
room, near where Arafat is staying.</TE>
<TE>   The sound of explosions and bursts of gunfire could be heard from the
direction of the compound. The Israeli army has blocked journalists'
access to the compound.</TE>
<TE>   In Bethlehem, the Greek Orthodox bishop in charge of the Church of the
Nativity left the besieged compound in an armored vehicle, accompanied by
a deacon, a nun and two church employees. They were transported by
Israeli troops to Jerusalem.</TE>
<TE>   Bishop Ambrosius, an elderly man who has medical problems, left a day
after Israeli troops helped four Franciscan monks leave the adjoining
Roman Catholic church. Israeli and Greek Orthodox officials said his
departure was preceded by negotiations involving churchmen, Greek
diplomats and the Israeli army.</TE>
<TE>   He was transferred from the armored vehicle to a private car and
whisked away, shedding no light on the status of nearly 80 Catholic,
Greek Orthodox and Armenian Orthodox members of the clergy inside the
compound along with 140 Palestinian fighters and Palestinian Authority
officials.</TE>

<HD>Israelis Free Hundreds of Palestinians</HD>
<DH>Mideast: Flying a white flag, about 80 released men brave war zone
to walk back to Ramallah. 'We just wanted to go home,' one says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TRACY WILKINSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>RAMALLAH, West Bank
</DL>
<LD>First came the Palestinian man with the white flag.</LD>
<LD>   Then, behind him, in groups of five, men just released from
imprisonment in an Israeli army camp walked down the main avenue into
Ramallah, hands in the air, shirts lifted to expose their stomachs.</LD>
<LD>   Jittery Israeli paratroopers in combat mode took up positions at an
intersection and trained their weapons on the men. A tank and an armored
personnel carrier backed them up.</LD>
<TE>   Israel has begun releasing hundreds of the men rounded up in
house-to-house sweeps of this West Bank city. The dragnet was meant to
capture Palestinians whom Israel regards as terrorists, but interviews
with several of the freed men indicate that their interrogations were
cursory and there apparently was never any real suspicion that they were
involved in violent subversion.</TE>
<TE>   More than a week ago, Israel launched a massive offensive across the
West Bank, invading every major Palestinian population center except
Jericho, battling Palestinian gunmen in refugee camps and destroying
swaths of Palestinian property. Dozens of Palestinians have been killed
and about 1,200 arrested in a campaign that Israel says will stop suicide
bombers and other militants who killed more than 120 Israelis last month
alone.</TE>
<TE>   Of those arrested so far, however, around 30% have already been
released, security sources said. Some of the men had question marks in
their backgrounds, but many Palestinians believe that the army also
wanted large numbers to show success in its campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Maj. Gen. Giora Eiland, planning director for the Israeli army,
defended the arrests as effective. Of the people arrested, he said, "many
dozens of them are very dangerous terrorists."</TE>
<TE>Israel Forces Allow No One on the Streets</TE>
<TE>   Scores of men were released Friday night and taken to the Kalandia
refugee camp a couple of miles from Ramallah. Under severe Israeli
restrictions, no one is allowed on the streets. But about 80 of the
released men, eager to get home, decided to take a chance and Saturday
began walking from Kalandia into Ramallah.</TE>
<TE>   Flying the white flag, the group was approaching a main intersection
when soldiers spotted them and opened fire. The man carrying the flag,
chosen because he was the best Hebrew speaker of the bunch, continued to
walk toward the soldiers and beg safe passage.</TE>
<TE>   After tense negotiations, in which soldiers lay belly-to-the-ground
and held the Palestinians in the sights of their M-16 rifles, a
commanding officer relented and said the men could proceed but only in
groups of five. And they had to show their stomachs, because Israeli
soldiers fear a potential suicide bomber with a belt of explosives
strapped to his waist--an all-too-common M.O.</TE>
<TE>   The men looked a disheveled parade.</TE>
<TE>   Mohammed Ibrahim, a skinny engineering student with glasses, was among
them.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't want to fight. We just wanted to go home," he said.
"Getting home is a victory, a very great victory. Of course, I was angry,
because this was not a good way to enter our country."</TE>
<TE>   The stories of several men who were arrested and freed are consistent.
Some reported to detention centers, such as a school basketball court in
the Ramallah neighborhood of Al Birah, after Israeli troops on
loudspeakers summoned all men ages 15 to 45; others were taken from their
homes in raids. They were handcuffed and blindfolded and left for hours
in a nearby Jewish settlement, and then taken to the Ofer army base just
southwest of Ramallah.</TE>
<TE>   At Ofer, upward of 700 or 800 men were crowded into tents and crude
shelters, the interviewees said. The conditions of their confinement were
terrible, they said.</TE>
<TE>   Ibrahim, 22, said he was detained March 30 and kept in an open-air
field at Ofer for three days before being transferred to a more
substantial barracks. He was fed bread and a bottle of water to be shared
with seven or eight fellow prisoners.</TE>
<TE>   The only interrogation, he said, was five minutes of questioning,
mostly about personal biographical information. A student at Birzeit
University on Ramallah's northern edge, Ibrahim said he doesn't belong to
any political faction.</TE>
<TE>Man Says Old Arrests Led to New Detention</TE>
<TE>   Kamal abu Khadijeh, 40, is the financial administrator for the
Coca-Cola company in Ramallah. He also was arrested March 30, by troops
who came to his home, then released Wednesday. Khadijeh said he believes
his political activism during the 1987-93 intifada against Israeli rule,
and several arrests 10 years ago as a result, attracted Israeli
attention.</TE>
<TE>   "They needed some people [to arrest], and unfortunately I had a name
from before," he said in the home of a brother after his release. "They
were concerned about numbers more than anything else."</TE>
<TE>   While held, Khadijeh said, he and the other men were fed matzo, the
unleavened bread eaten by Jews for Passover, and uncooked frozen
schnitzel. His interrogation didn't go beyond basic biographical data.</TE>
<TE>   "I think they realized from the beginning that I was nobody," he said.
"If I had been something, I wouldn't have waited for them to come to my
house."</TE>
<TE>   Mohammed Yacoub was also freed. Yacoub, an administrator at the Music
Conservatory in Ramallah and a folk singer in a well-known Palestinian
band, said he was forced to spend 26 hours in a rain-soaked field that
smelled of sewage. He then slept on cardboard, and then on a thin
foam-rubber mattress.</TE>
<TE>   He had been arrested in 1989, which seemed to have put him on the
Israelis' radar screen. He predicted that the sweeping roundups of
Palestinians will backfire.</TE>
<TE>   "It's hatred in each of us," he said. "It's sleeping in each of us,
and when it wakes, it will never go back to sleep."</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>PARIS
</DL>
<LD>Tens of thousands of activists marched through Paris and Rome on
Saturday in protests demanding Israel stop its offensive in the West Bank
and expressing solidarity with the Palestinians.</LD>
<LD>   More than 20,000 people marched here to the Place de la Bastille,
where hundreds of police stood by. Some protesters carried shredded
American flags and shouted slogans against Israeli Prime Minister Ariel
Sharon.</LD>
<LD>   "Sharon Assassin" and "Arabs, Jews together against Sharon," they
chanted in the protest, organized by dozens of pro-Palestinian,
anti-racist and Communist groups.</LD>
<TE>   International pressure has been growing on Israel to end its operation
in the West Bank, launched March 29 after a series of suicide attacks.</TE>
<TE>   In Rome, about 20,000 protesters marched through downtown, ending up
at a rally in the Piazza del Popolo, where the crowd swelled to about
50,000 people.</TE>
<TE>   A few marchers at the front of Saturday's procession wore black face
masks and bandannas like those worn by Palestinian militants. Others
carried banners calling for "Intifada until victory," and chanted for a
"liberated Palestine."</TE>
<TE>   Italy's three main unions and two major leftist parties, however,
decided at the last minute not to participate in the march, amid
criticism of the protest by Jewish groups.</TE>
<TE>   Protester Andrea Parrella expressed some concern about the march
turning into a venue for anti-Jewish sentiments.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's important for me to show my support--these people
[Palestinians] have neither land nor water," he said, but added that
"there is a risk that this demonstration could be turned into something
anti-Semitic."</TE>
<TE>   Other pro-Palestinian marches took place in smaller French and Italian
cities.</TE>
<TE>   "We are here to condemn the Palestinian occupation of the territories,
but also to condemn the recent racist attack in France, against both Jews
and Arabs," said Jean-Claude Vessillier, a spokesman for MRAP, one of
France's leading anti-racism groups.</TE>
<TE>   As Mideast violence has escalated in recent weeks, there have been a
rising number of arson attacks and vandalism on Jewish sites in France,
including cemeteries and synagogues.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>HARARE, Zimbabwe
</DL>
<LD>Police cracked down on planned Saturday demonstrations against the
disputed presidential elections, arresting at least 22 people in the
capital and blockading strategic locations in towns across Zimbabwe.</LD>
<LD>   The arrested demonstrators include Lovemore Madhuku, who heads the
umbrella organization of civic groups setting up the protest against
President Robert Mugabe's reelection.</LD>
<LD>   Madhuku, speaking from the Harare police station on his mobile phone,
said detainees expect to be charged with defying security laws that ban
political gatherings of more than three people without police
authorization.</LD>
<TE>   Small groups of demonstrators, some waving banners demanding
democratic reform, were prevented from reaching the site of a planned
march through downtown Harare. Police closed off downtown with
roadblocks.</TE>
<TE>   Police blockades also prevented gatherings in Bulawayo, Zimbabwe's
second-largest city, and in the provincial towns of Mutare and Gweru,
said Douglas Mwonzura, spokesman for the National Constitutional
Assembly, the alliance of civic groups that called for nationwide
protests Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   Television journalist Edwina Spicer and her husband were arrested and
briefly detained Saturday, apparently after filming truckloads of police
deploying in the capital. Also, 354 activists arrested Thursday were
freed on bail Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   Thousands of government critics and opposition activists have been
arrested since the March election, in which the government said Mugabe
defeated opposition Movement for Democratic Change leader Morgan
Tsvangirai. The opposition asserts that the vote was rigged.</TE>

<HD>Hope, Caution in Cincinnati</HD>
<DH>Race: The Ohio city unveils much-debated police reforms a year
after it was shaken by three days of riots.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEPHANIE SIMON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>CINCINNATI
</DL>
<LD>The rhetoric on this tense anniversary is upbeat. A year after race
riots tore at this city, politicians--white and black--are hailing a new
agreement to address long-simmering complaints that police here brutalize
minorities.</LD>
<LD>   There is a 60-page police reform plan that promises tight controls on
the use of choke holds, dogs and Mace to subdue suspects. There is talk
of a new era. "A historic moment," says Mayor Charlie Luken. "A turning
point for this city."</LD>
<LD>   But off in the corner of the ornate council chambers, Police Chief Tom
Streicher sits apart, his uniform crisp, his face taut. He has prepared a
sound bite praising the reforms as "fair and progressive." It's clear,
though, that he does not think much of some of them.</LD>
<TE>   Take the civilian watchdog panel, a much-touted reform that will, for
the first time, give citizens power to investigate allegations of police
misconduct. The chief can see little point to that. In fact, he considers
it mainly a public relations sop, to "make the public feel better."</TE>
<TE>   He and several of his top deputies insist as well that all the
use-of-force reforms will not add up to much real change.</TE>
<TE>   Their take: Police have been following proper procedures all along. So
the package released last week in council chambers "will not
fundamentally change what our officers are doing," said Assistant Chief
Richard Janke, who commands the patrol bureau.</TE>
<TE>   The gulf in expectations--between politicians promising a new
Cincinnati and police brass saying not much needs to change--underscores
the tensions that persist here a year after the riots.</TE>
<TE>   There are other indications as well:</TE>
<TE>   * Charging the city with "systemic racism," some black leaders have
pressed a boycott of downtown businesses that has cost Cincinnati at
least $10 million so far.</TE>
<TE>   * Bill Cosby, Whoopi Goldberg, Wynton Marsalis and several other black
entertainers have honored the boycott by canceling shows here. The
Progressive National Baptist Convention scrapped plans to have 10,000
delegates convene in Cincinnati. And patrons of downtown restaurants have
at times been greeted by protest signs chiding "Eat, drink and be
racist."</TE>
<TE>   * Thousands of demonstrators are expected to march downtown this
morning to mark the day one year ago when 19-year-old Timothy Thomas was
shot dead as he fled a police officer in the middle of the night. Thomas
was wanted on multiple warrants, mostly for traffic violations.</TE>
<TE>   His death sparked three days of street violence--the worst racial
unrest in Cincinnati since Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated in
Memphis, Tenn., in 1968.</TE>
<TE>   City officials worry that the protest march could be volatile. "I
don't know how it's going to go," Mayor Luken said uneasily.</TE>
<TE>   In his view, and the view of many other civic leaders, the city has
taken enormous strides in the last year. There have been initiatives to
help blacks start their own businesses and to steer more construction
contracts to minorities. The private sector has created hundreds of
summer jobs for teens who complained of idle days on dangerous streets.</TE>
<TE>   The city has pledged $50 million to clean the decrepit neighborhoods
where many blacks live in despair. And the school board and the state
will spend nearly $1 billion over the next decade to replace dozens of
dilapidated buildings.</TE>
<TE>   "We should start seeing tangible changes in the neighborhoods soon,"
promised Vice Mayor Alicia Reece.</TE>
<TE>   In a mostly black neighborhood north of downtown, the Rev. Peterson
Mingo already has seen major change.</TE>
<TE>   He reports with delight that police officers there have been making a
conscious effort to reach out and to relax their authoritarian image. "A
philosophical and strategic shift," Lt. Col. Rick Biehl called it.</TE>
<TE>   Officers have started patrolling on foot more often so they are more
accessible. They have worked with civilians to develop strategies to weed
out drug pushers. The local commander even reassigned several officers
who Mingo complained were harassing black youths.</TE>
<TE>   The other day, Mingo said, he saw several neighborhood kids run up to
two cops, clamoring to be photographed with them.</TE>
<TE>   "There's been a lot of progress," he concluded. "A whole lot of
progress."</TE>
<TE>   To encourage such progress elsewhere in the city, the federal
government has pledged to train thousands of Cincinnati civilians on how
to cooperate with police to fight crime. And the police have pledged to
use Mingo's neighborhood as a model for improving relations.</TE>
<TE>   "Do we have a long way to go? Absolutely. But we'll get there," said
Tom Cody, the chairman of a civic improvement panel created after the
riots.</TE>
<TE>   That optimistic outlook received a boost Wednesday when city leaders
unveiled the proposals for police reform.</TE>
<TE>   The document was negotiated over 10 months by police, elected
officials, black leaders, the American Civil Liberties Union and the U.S.
Department of Justice to settle a lawsuit alleging decades of racist
policing.</TE>
<TE>   If all parties ratify it, the lawsuit will be dismissed and a federal
judge will appoint a monitor to make sure the police carry out every
condition.</TE>
<TE>   The promise of a federal monitor appeals to many wary citizens who say
they no longer trust the police or the city to make good on promises of
reform.</TE>
<TE>   "I really don't have much faith in any of them," said Brenda Owensby,
whose son was asphyxiated in a scuffle with police 17 months ago. "Saying
and doing are two different things."</TE>
<TE>   "So many city leaders just don't get it," agreed attorney Paul
DeMarco, who sits on a civilian panel that is supposed to review police
misconduct but has no teeth.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a deeply entrenched attitude, insidious in Cincinnati, that
the police are above the law," DeMarco said. "My confidence is in the
federal court, period."</TE>
<TE>   There is reason for such wariness. In 1968 and 1979 and 1981, in 1987
and again in 1995, federal and local panels were set up to address
persistent concerns of racism and police misconduct. In every case, the
investigators found troubling patterns.</TE>
<TE>   Reports were written, recommendations made. Landmark reforms were
pledged. Still, the problems endured.</TE>
<TE>   "Are we going to go through the same cycle again now?" asked the Rev.
Paula Jackson.</TE>
<TE>   Luken promises that this time it will be different.</TE>
<TE>   The boycott will wither, he says. The police will earn public trust.
The crumbling neighborhoods will be rebuilt. And Cincinnati will heal.</TE>
<TE>   "The city's been getting a bad rap, obviously. This has been a
difficult year for everyone," he said. "But if we keep our eye on the
ball and keep moving, we'll eventually get where we have to go."</TE>

<HD>Soft-Money Rules a Hard Row to Hoe</HD>
<DH>Campaigns: As FEC chief, David Mason is skeptical of success but
promises to follow Congress' will in enforcing a pending ban on unlimited
donations.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NICK ANDERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Five years ago, a conservative analyst named David M. Mason penned
a critique of the campaign reform movement titled "Why Congress Can't Ban
Soft Money." Earlier this year, as lawmakers sought to prove him wrong,
he attacked elements of their reform bill as "unworkable or
unenforceable."</LD>
<LD>   But now, as chairman of the Federal Election Commission, Mason is
responsible for enforcing the new law that soon will prohibit national
political parties from collecting the unlimited donations known as soft
money. Despite his own skepticism, Mason promises to follow the will of
Congress.</LD>
<LD>   "What the rule of law means is that the law governs behavior and
personal opinions don't," Mason said. "It will be our job to enforce the
law that's passed. I don't really see that as being a difficult
intellectual or moral proposition."</LD>
<TE>   Other commissioners interviewed in recent days said they too will
strive to carry out the broadest changes to federal campaign law in
nearly 30 years.</TE>
<TE>   But the FEC, created in 1974 after the Watergate scandal of the Nixon
administration, has long been belittled for taking what critics call a
hands-off approach to campaign regulation.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, FEC decisions over the years helped lead national parties to
pursue huge soft-money donations from corporations, labor unions and
wealthy individuals. Taking advantage of gaps in the law, many of those
checks were hundreds of times larger than what was allowed under the
system of limits Congress created to reduce the potential for political
corruption.</TE>
<TE>   For example, an individual could give a candidate no more than $1,000
per election cycle but could give a national party committee $1 million
or more, which could then be used to influence a specific election. Such
unlimited donations to the national parties will become illegal Nov. 6
unless federal courts intervene.</TE>
<TE>   As the FEC begins to set in motion the law enacted late last month,
critics fear that the agency may carve out new pathways for big money to
enter politics. Some even propose replacing the FEC, whose six
commissioners are evenly divided between Republicans and Democrats, with
an agency that has greater enforcement powers and more autonomy from
Congress and the parties.</TE>
<TE>   Historically, the FEC has been a restrained watchdog; critics would
say muzzled. While the agency is widely praised for keeping the public
records that disclose donors to federal campaigns, its investigative and
enforcement powers are sharply limited by statute, budget and politics. A
two-thirds majority vote of the commission is required for any action,
meaning that at least one of the six commissioners must cross party
lines. On high-profile cases, those bipartisan majorities can be elusive.</TE>
<TE>   "It's understaffed, it's underfunded, it's under-backboned," said
Trevor Potter, a former FEC commissioner who has advised Sen. John McCain
(R-Ariz.), the leading proponent of the new campaign law. "It is a weak
enforcement agency. One of the reasons we're in [this] soft money
situation is that the agency has not enforced existing laws."</TE>
<TE>   McCain has said his next goal is reforming the commission.</TE>
<TE>   McCain's chief foe, Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), has replied,
however, that the FEC should not be allowed to become "a Gestapo trying
to quiet the voices of American citizens."</TE>
<TE>   McConnell contends that the new campaign finance law is
unconstitutional and has filed suit here in federal court to overturn it.
That means that the Supreme Court eventually will rule on the
legislation, which cleared Congress only after years of debate and
received merely grudging approval from President Bush.</TE>
<TE>   For now, however, it's up to the FEC to interpret and implement the
law. It must issue new regulations on soft money by late June and on many
other campaign finance matters by year's end.</TE>
<TE>   These regulations--and subsequent FEC decisions on the scope of the
law and whether to pursue alleged violations--will ultimately shape how
candidates, political professionals and interest groups respond to
whatever mandate is upheld by the Supreme Court.</TE>
<TE>   In the complex realm of campaign finance, where parties vying for
power inevitably push the legal envelope, details matter.</TE>
<TE>   "How some of the particulars are applied, given different
circumstances, will really determine the long-term effectiveness of the
[new] law," said Anthony J. Corrado, a campaign finance expert at Colby
College in Waterville, Maine. "That's really the principal lesson of the
last round of reforms" in the 1970s.</TE>
<TE>   Mason points out several provisions of the new law that pose
interpretive challenges.</TE>
<TE>   For example, Congress told the FEC to write new rules establishing
when parties or politicians have "coordinated" activities with labor
unions, corporations or interest groups. Under the law, any political
advertisement sponsored by such outside groups must be paid for with
funds raised under federal contribution limits--if the ad was coordinated
with a party or a candidate.</TE>
<TE>   But defining "coordination" is tricky. Some FEC members have argued
that the term should be strictly defined as a formal arrangement between
a candidate and an outside group. Congress, however, asked the commission
to establish a broader definition. In the end, such subtleties as whether
a candidate and an outside group shared a consultant or vendor might
determine whether an ad could be funded with unregulated donations or
not.</TE>
<TE>   In another section of the law, Congress banned certain forms of
political advertising by interest groups during the weeks before an
election. But it made exceptions for news media, candidate debates and
"any other communication exempted under such regulations as the [FEC] may
promulgate" as consistent with the intent of the law.</TE>
<TE>   Still another provision will require the FEC to track how much
personal money candidates spend to get elected. Under a complex formula,
opponents of wealthy, self-financed candidates would be eligible for
special exceptions to the federal contribution limits. But applying the
formula in the hectic days before an election and ruling which candidates
are eligible for how many breaks will not be easy.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not a bill I'd have voted for had I been in Congress," Mason
said. "I really wish there had been an opportunity to engage Congress
more on some of these detail-level issues so they could produce a bill
that would be easy for us to implement and enforce."</TE>
<TE>   Yet Mason, a Republican and former Heritage Foundation analyst,
pledged to do his best. So did Bradley A. Smith, another Republican
commissioner, who has written a book titled "Unfree Speech: The Folly of
Campaign Finance Reform."</TE>
<TE>   Both were appointed by President Clinton to fill Republican vacancies,
Mason in 1998 and Smith in 2000. Clinton, who declared himself an
advocate of campaign reform even though he led the Democratic Party
during a time of fund-raising abuses, was forced to bargain over the
appointments with GOP congressional leaders. His nominees were confirmed
by the Senate.</TE>
<TE>   Commissioners, who oversee a staff of about 350 and an annual budget
of $43 million, say they are likely to need more money to implement the
biggest campaign overhaul in a generation. Whether Congress will help is
unclear. Historically, lawmakers have kept the FEC on a tight fiscal
leash. What's more, any discussion of funding is likely to generate
debate about overhauling the commission itself.</TE>
<TE>   Smith lamented that "supporters of the bill have immediately turned to
attacking the commission rather than saying, 'OK, what do you need to do
the job?' "</TE>

<HD>Tighter FAA Rules Killing the Messengers</HD>
<DH>Aviation: Pilots who tow banners say the restricted airspace at
arenas isn't for security but because ads harm the bottom line of
interests such as the NFL.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN-THOR DAHLBURG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ABOVE MIAMI BEACH, Fla.
</DL>
<LD>Fly through these skies and sooner or later you'll spot some
special pilots, people who hold themselves up both as heirs of the
barnstormers of old and guerrilla warriors of today's economy.</LD>
<LD>   They are the aviators who make a living, or try to, towing banners
plugging the $2.99 Grand Slam breakfast at Denny's, two-for-one
happy-hour specials at a beach bar, or a TV show on ABC. To vacationing
beach-goers, the periodic droning of the planes may be as welcome as ants
at a picnic. On the other hand, if you've forgotten how to call home
collect, the messages the fliers carry may provide a service.</LD>
<LD>   Since Sept. 11 and the measures hurriedly imposed to prevent another
terrorist onslaught from the air, this niche of the U.S. aviation
industry has been taking a financial beating.</LD>
<TE>   Tim West, 32, chief pilot of Aerial Sign Co. of Hollywood, Fla., is
paid according to how many flights he makes. For three years, he says, he
was saving to buy a home, but he has had to "burn up" his nest egg to pay
for food and other necessities.</TE>
<TE>   With no message to pull for income, West took a reporter up one
afternoon last week in a propeller-driven Piper Super Cub to show the
usual route he and other banner-towers fly along South Florida's hotel-
and condominium-lined Atlantic Coast. Flying as low as 300 feet, and
slowing to the customary sign-pulling speed of 40 mph, pilot and
passenger could see manta rays swimming near shore and nudists sunning on
Haulover Beach.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't beat the view from the window of my office," West said via
the on-board radio, as wind roared in the large opening in the fuselage
where a pilot can lean out to check whether the banner is flying
properly.</TE>
<TE>   "Most of our members are out of work," said Julian A. Hayes, general
counsel for the U.S. Aerial Advertisers Assn., a Tampa-based professional
organization that represents the interests of an estimated 600 firms,
mostly mom-and-pop operations, that do pull aerial banners. "All fall
there was no revenue. Millions of dollars were lost."</TE>
<TE>   At first, the pilots say, the airspace was closed to them after the
Sept. 11 attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon because of
legitimate worries about national security. But they contend that one key
restriction--flying over sporting events--remains, and it is not because
of homeland defense but because their aggressive style of advertising
hurts powerful economic interests, including those of the National
Football League and its sponsors.</TE>
<TE>   "What does it cost to put 'Miller' on a scoreboard? $200,000?" asked
Jim Goggin, 52, one of West's fellow pilots. "We can tow a banner that
says 'Budweiser' around the stadium all season for a lot less."</TE>
<TE>   Deprived of paying work for three months, Goggin said he has been
forced to mortgage his condominium.</TE>
<TE>   Jim Butler, owner of Aerial Sign, employs West and Goggin, and he owns
and subcontracts so many sign-pulling aircraft nationwide that he can put
90 planes in the air at one time in markets around the country.</TE>
<TE>   In South Florida, he says, "I'm the kingpin." The son of a
banner-tower and skywriter, Butler, 58, discovered his lifetime calling
when, as a boy, he watched his father write "Pepsi 5 cents" in the sky.</TE>
<TE>   "If you want to rain on somebody's parade, you can do it very easily
with an airplane," Butler said. When one of Miami's largest auto dealers
holds a major sale, for instance, competitors hire Aerial Sign to circle
the dealership with banners promising to beat the price on any car by
$500.</TE>
<TE>   "We're renegades," said the ruddy-faced, straight-talking Butler, who
relishes the role. "People don't like us, but we're an information
source."</TE>
<TE>   Aerial Sign, which has its offices, sign-making shop and maintenance
hangars at a small Broward County airport northwest of Miami, has been
clobbered since Sept. 11. In December, Butler said, business plummeted to
5% of normal. He laid off employees for two weeks, he said, then put the
ground staff on a three- or four-day workweek.</TE>
<TE>   Of late, demand has been improving but still is down 20% to 25%,
Butler said. One problem is that advertisers spent less on signs when the
number of vacationers coming to Florida dropped. Then there is the issue
of NFL games, a major target audience for aerial advertising.</TE>
<TE>   In mid-September, with the nation still reeling from the hijacked
airliner attacks, the Federal Aviation Administration banned all aircraft
from approaching at low altitude within three miles of "any major
professional or collegiate sporting event or any other major open-air
assembly of people."</TE>
<TE>   For banner-towers, who earn a significant chunk of their revenue by
orbiting baseball and football games and other sports contests, the FAA
notice spelled economic ruin, and they fought it.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. Aerial Advertisers Assn. has filed a petition, pending in a
federal appeals court in Atlanta, so its members can fly as they did
before.</TE>
<TE>   "We're saying we have the right to operate in navigable airspace,
unless there is a real reason not to," said Hayes, the trade group's
general counsel. "Aerial advertising planes are no threat. They carry not
much more fuel than a car, nor are they as heavy as a car. They present
minimal danger as a terrorist tool."</TE>
<TE>   In the 52 years that Aerial Sign has been in business, three of its
pilots have been killed in midair collisions. But in the history of
aerial advertising, which began in the 1920s, not a single member of the
public has been harmed, Butler said.</TE>
<TE>   On Dec. 23, when the NFL's Baltimore Ravens were playing at home,
sign-pulling aircraft were told by the control tower at
Baltimore-Washington International Airport to leave the area and return
to the ground. The reason given by the tower, according to a tower log
obtained by Butler, was that FAA Administrator Jane Garvey "had an
agreement with the NFL no one else knew about" to keep advertising planes
away from stadiums on game days.</TE>
<TE>   As he brandishes the log, Butler appears as outraged as any American
Colonist might have been when ordered to drink only English tea. "In
violation of FAA rules, they have let private interests control the
airspace," he said, fuming.</TE>
<TE>   "This is one of the few areas where the situation is not back to where
it was before 9/11," FAA spokesman William Shumann in Washington
acknowledged Friday. His agency's directive against flying over sporting
events still stands, he said, but aerial advertisers can ask for and do
obtain waivers. Shumann said there was no deal cut by Garvey to keep
banner-towers away.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no secret agreement with the NFL or any other sports
organization," he said. "Believe me, there is no agreement at all."</TE>
<TE>   Late last month, Aerial Sign received a letter from an FAA official
granting its waiver request to resume flying near sports events and other
public gatherings.</TE>
<TE>   But Butler worries that it will be a struggle to reclaim his
advertisers. Despite the letter, he worries aloud that permission to fly
over professional football games might be rescinded again and that in
such conditions of uncertainty it may be difficult to persuade
advertisers who draw up their budgets long in advance to go back to
banners.</TE>
<TE>   "We've got an uphill battle to go to reach where we were last year,"
Butler said. "We've had our constitutional rights taken away from us.
We've had our airspace taken away from us."</TE>

<HD>Kilts Parade for Pride, and a Cause</HD>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK
</DL>
<LD>Never has Manhattan seen so many men's bare knees, including Sean
Connery's, walking up the avenue.</LD>
<LD>   The Scottish-born actor, clad in a kilt, and Mayor Michael R.
Bloomberg led a band Saturday of about 10,000 bagpipers and drummers up
6th Avenue.</LD>
<LD>   The event marked Tartan Day, celebrating Scottish heritage.</LD>
<TE>   There were 1,200 participants from Scotland. Others represented 26
countries and all U.S. states.</TE>
<TE>   The parade benefited cancer patients and survivors through the
Britain-based Marie Curie Cancer Care group and New York's Gilda's Club
Worldwide, which is named for the late comedian Gilda Radner.
Participants pledged donations, and a fund-raiser was held Friday night.</TE>
<TE>   When the parade stepped off at 2 p.m., piper Curt Anderson had a
little something extra besides a wool kilt to ward off the 41-degree
chill.</TE>
<TE>   "I have a little bit of Scotch whisky. It's kind of cool today, so
I've already had some," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Any clothing under his kilt?</TE>
<TE>   "Just shoes and socks."</TE>
<TE>   It's Scottish tradition for men to wear nothing under their kilts,
parade producer Thomas Grotrian explained. He was one of about 20 men
wearing "trews"--or trousers.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a lot more comfortable in this sort of weather," Grotrian said.</TE>

<HD>Job of Protecting N.Y. Falls to 'Can-Do Guy'</HD>
<DH>Safety: Ex-FBI official Kallstrom directs an effort to guard
against attacks. His colleagues say he's up to the task.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN J. GOLDMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK
</DL>
<LD>From his corner office in Manhattan, James Kallstrom can see the
Chrysler Building with its gleaming steel spire and a thicket of other
skyscrapers. The vista is a daily reminder of the task he faces.</LD>
<LD>   Kallstrom's job description is starkly simple: Protect the almost 19
million people of New York state from another terrorist attack.</LD>
<LD>   Appointed after Sept. 11 by Gov. George Pataki as the state's director
of public security, the former FBI assistant director is responsible for
finding weaknesses in current plans and forming fresh strategies to guard
against threats to bridges, tunnels, nuclear plants, the New York Stock
Exchange, the Statue of Liberty, the Federal Reserve Bank, the Empire
State Building and other skyscrapers.</LD>
<TE>   Those are just the obvious targets. Kallstrom worries about all sorts
of possibilities, such as the safety of the state's milk supply.</TE>
<TE>   Add to the mix trying to ensure 75,000 police officers have better
equipment, training and relevant information from the federal government
and the job is mind-boggling in its complexity.</TE>
<TE>   "Between here and Washington, D.C., you are probably talking about 90%
of the targets," Kallstrom said.</TE>
<TE>   Former FBI colleagues say the job is tailor-made for Kallstrom. "He
thrives on emergency situations," said an agent who worked with him on
big cases. "He loves being in the game, being in the fight."</TE>
<TE>   More than six months after the attack on the World Trade Center, some
important security steps have been taken. But much remains to be done,
and Kallstrom's sense of urgency is punctuated by his belief that the
clock could be ticking down to further attacks.</TE>
<TE>   "I think most people don't realize we are at the beginning of this
thing. They think we are halfway through it or it is almost over," he
said, pausing in his office for an interview.</TE>
<TE>   "We're talking about people I think who obviously are obsessed with
weapons of mass destruction, are obsessed, I think, with killing a large
population and having a very negative impact on our economy and would
like to do both of these things simultaneously.</TE>
<TE>   "They are capable of doing it," Kallstrom said.</TE>
<TE>   Under his direction, the Office of Public Security has undertaken
various countermeasures:</TE>
<TE>   * Set up the nation's first anti-terrorism communication network
linking all of New York's 345 law enforcement agencies. The encrypted
computer system quickly separates critical intelligence from routine
criminal data and is anchored in the philosophy that officers on the
streets can identify abnormal situations and, if furnished proper data,
can help fight terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   * Increased protection at the Indian Point Nuclear Plant in
Westchester County, 45 miles northeast of New York City. In a pilot
program that could be replicated at the state's five other nuclear
plants, the Office of Public Security, the FBI, the Nuclear Regulatory
Commission and Entergy Corp., the owner of Indian Point, assessed the
plant's procedures in case of an attack, and the FBI has offered to train
its guards.</TE>
<TE>   * Surveyed the vast state government operations. It also focused on
personnel who would first respond to an attack. It found serious
shortages of protective gear and other equipment, including technology to
quickly identify chemicals that terrorists might use.</TE>
<TE>   * Inventoried every potential target in the state that could cause
grave harm to people and the economy. This has been coupled with trying
to predict terrorist scenarios and plan appropriate measures. It is a
massive undertaking assessing such targets as the power grid, the water
supply, airports, harbors and critical data networks.</TE>
<TE>   Some initiatives are less public for fear of tipping off terrorists.</TE>
<TE>   "We are using a lot of new technology that probably isn't obvious,"
Kallstrom said, declining to elaborate. "Our whole philosophy is to make
it as hard as possible to get to targets."</TE>
<TE>   When the two hijacked planes crashed into the World Trade Center,
Kallstrom was in his office at MBNA Corp. in Wilmington, Del., where he
made a successful transition into banking after retiring from the FBI in
1997.</TE>
<TE>   The World Trade Center was familiar territory. During his 28-year
career with the bureau, including heading its New York field office,
Kallstrom investigated the 1993 terrorist bombing of the complex.</TE>
<TE>   "I was shocked about the tragedy and how it happened," he said of the
second attack. "But I wasn't the least bit surprised. I knew immediately
what it was."</TE>
<TE>   Fast-forward to a sunny Saturday several weeks after Sept. 11.
Kallstrom was half asleep on his couch watching a football game when the
phone rang. It was Pataki, and the governor's message was clear: "I
really need you."</TE>
<TE>   Pataki already had cleared the move with Kallstrom's employer, MBNA
Chairman Alfred Lerner, who, in an act of patriotism, pledged to pay
Kallstrom's salary.</TE>
<TE>   In picking Kallstrom, the governor got an executive with broad skills
supervising large projects, and roots in New York and Washington's law
enforcement communities.</TE>
<TE>   "He is a total can-do guy," said Mary Jo White, the former U.S.
attorney in New York. "He has great relationships with everybody in every
segment of society."</TE>
<TE>   Kallstrom, 58, gained national prominence during almost daily
television briefings in the 1996 crash investigation of TWA Flight 800.
Terrorism was suspected when the plane plunged into the Atlantic shortly
after taking off from New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport.
Later, the crash was attributed to mechanical failure.</TE>
<TE>   Early in the inquiry, Kallstrom glanced around the FBI's command post.
"I see people walking when they should be running," he said. Someone
posted the comment on a wall and it became the FBI's mantra for the
probe.</TE>
<TE>   Agents who worked with Kallstrom on Flight 800 stress his attention to
detail and intense desire to gather sufficient resources.</TE>
<TE>   "If someone asked me what's the toughest job I had being head of the
FBI office, it was the information overload," Kallstrom said, "and that's
the same issue here."</TE>
<TE>   His philosophy has been to break down the security issues into
manageable segments.</TE>
<TE>   "I really do think we are getting stronger," he said. "As every month
goes by, we are better able to deal with these issues."</TE>

<HD>Irish Bishop Accused of Protecting Priest Resigns at Vatican</HD>
<DH>Religion: Church leader is the third to step down recently in a
string of sex-abuse cases.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>VATICAN CITY
</DL>
<LD>Pope John Paul II has accepted the resignation of an Irish bishop
who traveled here to step down in person over allegations that he
protected a pedophile priest, the Vatican announced Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   Bishop Brendan Comiskey, who announced his resignation Monday, became
the third Roman Catholic bishop to step down recently amid a series of
sex-abuse cases rocking the church. Comiskey, 66, has apologized for not
doing enough to halt the abuses perpetrated by the Rev. Sean Fortune, a
priest from his diocese.</LD>
<LD>   The Catholic hierarchy in Ireland said in a statement Saturday that
Comiskey's successor in the southeast Irish diocese of Ferns would be
Bishop Eamonn Walsh. The Vatican would not immediately confirm the
appointment.</LD>
<TE>   Pressure on Comiskey rose after the British Broadcasting Corp. on
March 19 showed a documentary on some of Fortune's victims. Fortune
committed suicide in 1999 shortly before he was to stand trial on 66
criminal counts of sexually abusing boys.</TE>
<TE>   Comiskey was ordained a priest in 1961, became auxiliary bishop for
Dublin in 1980, and became bishop of Ferns in 1984. Though resigning as a
bishop, he was to remain a priest.</TE>
<TE>   The church's leaders in Ireland had accepted Comiskey's decision, and
issued a wider apology.</TE>
<TE>   Walsh, in a statement, pledged to cooperate with efforts to
investigate the history of sex abuse.</TE>
<TE>   "In my caretaker capacity, I will cooperate fully with whatever
instrument of inquiry is deemed most appropriate in our search for the
truth," he said.</TE>
<TE>   But residents of New Ross, in County Wexford where Fortune committed
suicide, said they thought that Comiskey should not have resigned and
that the Vatican should not have accepted.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the church is on a bit of a low at the moment," one man told
state broadcaster RTE. "I think if we got answers to those questions and
get this case fully resolved, we might get back on a par that we should
be on with the Catholic Church."</TE>
<TE>   Two other bishops have resigned amid the church's recent series of
sex-abuse cases. Archbishop Juliusz Paetz of Poznan, Poland, stepped down
late last month amid accusations that he made sexual advances to young
clerics. In the United States, Bishop Anthony J. O'Connell resigned in
March from the Diocese of Palm Beach, Fla., admitting that he sexually
abused a former seminarian in the 1970s.</TE>
<TE>   The Irish government announced Friday that it had appointed a senior
lawyer to begin preparatory work for a judicial inquiry into the alleged
church cover-up of abuse in Ferns.</TE>

<HD>Oil Spill Blackens Louisiana Coast Area</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NEW ORLEANS
</DL>
<LD>A pipeline rupture sent about 90,000 gallons of oil pouring into a
southeast Louisiana coastal area known as Little Lake on Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   Owner BP Amoco shut down the pipeline as soon as it became aware of
the spill and notified Garner Environmental, which dispatched five boats
to begin containment and cleanup, said company spokesman Neil Chapman.</LD>
<LD>   It was not immediately clear what caused the rupture or to what extent
the spill may have damaged marine or coastal wildlife.</LD>
<TE>   "We're trying to keep the oil away from the critters, and if some do
get in trouble we have specialists who are trained to rehabilitate them,"
said BP spokesman Daren Beaudo, who was on the scene.</TE>
<TE>   Coast Guard officials said BP Amoco sent a plane to assess the damage.</TE>
<TE>   Little Lake is mostly surrounded by marshland but connects to
Barataria Bay and the Gulf of Mexico at Louisiana's far southeastern
coast, about 35 miles south of New Orleans.</TE>
<TE>   Cleanup crews had 40,000 feet of containment boom in the water, but
some oil had reached land and started up a canal.</TE>
<TE>   "There will be some shoreline impact, and we're trying to prevent any
more," Beaudo said. "The wind out here has been kind of tricky."</TE>
<TE>   He said the cleanup could take several days.</TE>
<TE>   Chapman said company engineers had yet to determine what caused the
rupture in the line, which runs from the Louisiana Offshore Oil Port to
the Alliance Refinery near New Orleans.</TE>
<TE>   Coast Guard spokesman Jeff Murphy described the slick as a large
ribbon being pushed by the wind toward the shoreline, where cleanup crews
were able to corral most of it.</TE>
<TE>   "It's staying in one area of the lake," he said. BP "had a fast
response with a lot of resources."</TE>
<TE>   The worst Louisiana spill in recent years dumped half a million
gallons from the tanker Westchester into the Mississippi River in
November 2000.</TE>
<TE>   The Westchester spill was the largest in U.S. waters since the Exxon
Valdez dumped more than 10 million gallons of oil in Prince William
Sound, Alaska, in March 1989.</TE>

<HD>Shooting of Pipeline Costs $20 Million</HD>

<DL>FAIRBANKS, Alaska
</DL>
<LD>The cost of repairing the trans-Alaska pipeline and cleaning up a
286,000-gallon oil spill caused by a bullet hole has risen to $20
million, according to Alyeska Pipeline Service Co.</LD>
<LD>   In October, Daniel Carson Lewis allegedly shot a hole in the pipeline
north of Fairbanks with a .338-caliber rifle. He will stand trial in
September.</LD>
<LD>   The cleanup has almost been completed, officials said. Less than 1,000
gallons remain trapped in the gravel pad of the pipeline's access road,
said Kalu Kalu, Alyeska project manager.</LD>
<TE>   About $6 million of the $20-million cleanup bill was for labor costs
and another $6 million will go toward the treatment and recovery of crude
collected from the contaminated soil, Kalu said. The rest went toward
equipment and remote camp costs.</TE>
<TE>   About 176,000 gallons have been recovered and injected back into the
pipeline, Kalu said.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm convinced that it is about as clean as it was before," said Ed
Meggert, supervisor of the Fairbanks Department of Environmental
Conservation. Meggert was one of the first state workers on the scene.</TE>

<HD>Winter Leaves Maine Parched</HD>
<DH>Drought: In fact, the entire Eastern Seaboard faces a potential
disaster this summer because of paltry snowfall totals.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID LAMB</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>POLAND SPRINGS, Maine
</DL>
<LD>With wells running dry and boats beached on the mud flats of
low-water marinas, Maine is gripped by its worst drought in 107 years. To
the weather-wise people of this rural state, the reason why is no secret:
They were betrayed by the winter.</LD>
<LD>   In normal times, old-timers say, Maine has nine months of winter and
three months of lousy sledding. But this year, the heavy snows that melt
to fill the state's wells, rivers and 6,000 lakes never fell. Portland,
for instance, the largest city, had less than half its usual 64-inch
snowfall.</LD>
<LD>   "You see that truck over there?" Roger Knights asked last week,
pointing to a red Dodge pickup equipped with a snowplow outside his home.
"I bought it in the fall and figured I'd make some money plowing. Well,
we didn't get but two or three snows, and none of them amounted to
[much]. I didn't make a plug nickel."</LD>
<TE>   Maine is one of the nation's most water-rich states, and it was widely
assumed the drought that began last summer would become history once
winter set in. Instead, the winter--mild and dry by local
standards--worsened conditions, and the water table dropped steadily,
from 17 feet below ground a year ago to 22 feet in February.</TE>
<TE>   "I've never seen such a wimpy winter," mechanic Ted Gray said. "And
I've never seen Lake Sebago when you could walk out over 100 yards of
beach. Course, the lake was down some this time last year too, but the
difference is then we had 4 feet of snow on the ground and now the ground
is bare."</TE>
<TE>   The precipitation that was due Maine--and the rest of the Eastern
Seaboard--was delivered instead to the Mississippi Valley, steered
southward by high pressure that lingered for months over the Atlantic
coast. The weather pattern has left wide regions of the East with a
potentially dangerous water shortage.</TE>
<TE>   New Jersey Gov. Donald T. DiFrancesco declared a water emergency in
March. New York City's reservoir storage is at 59% of capacity.
Washington, D.C.'s rainfall from September to February was 70% below
normal. Nationwide, the National Weather Service says, this winter was
the 14th driest and fifth warmest in 107 years of record-keeping.</TE>
<TE>   Although Maine may ask for federal assistance, the drought at this
point is no match for the long hot summer of 1988, when 35 states were
bone-dry, cattle died, fires scorched the West and Gov. Guy Hunt of
Alabama prayed for rain. (It poured the next day.)</TE>
<TE>   A National Weather Service meteorologist said a more normal weather
pattern seems to be settling in this spring, but unless
heavier-than-usual rainfall raises water supplies in the months ahead,
officials say a disaster could be in the making.</TE>
<TE>   In Maine's case, that would mean forest fires, water rationing, damage
to potatoes and other agricultural crops, and a devastating hit to the
state's tourist industry, its largest income-earner after pulp and paper.
Tourism is an $8.8-billion business for New England's poorest state,
raising $330 million a year in tax revenues and attracting 44 million
visitors, many of whom are lured by Sebago and other lakes.</TE>
<TE>   The town hall in Poland, adjoining Poland Springs and 25 miles
northwest of Portland, was without water for five months. Allen Theriault
spent the winter filling wells in Pigeon Hole from a 2,400-gallon tank on
his truck. And until a 1,200-foot-deep well was dug at Northern Springs
Mobile Home Park, Rita Cribbin needed two hours to wash her dishes under
the trickle of water from her faucet.</TE>
<TE>   Many residents have stocked up on bottled water--ironic because Poland
Springs is home to some of the nation's most famous drinking water and
the world's second-largest water-bottling plant. Once believed to have
healing powers, Poland Springs water was first bottled in 1845 and sold
in 3-gallon bottles that cost 15 cents. Now owned by Perrier, the company
had sales exceeding $450 million last year.</TE>
<TE>   But while Poland Springs' commercial water comes from a deep aquifer
and is filtered through glacial sand and gravel, many of Maine's 1.3
million residents get their water from shallow dug wells. As a step
toward requesting federal assistance, state officials are asking people
with dry wells to contact the Maine Emergency Management Agency. About
600 have done so.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been a struggle to get folks to notify us that they've got a
problem," said Ann-Marie Brett, the agency's assistant director. "The
Maine mentality and ethic is very much that of Yankee ingenuity and you
don't bother someone else with your problem."</TE>

<HD>Mass. GOP Backs Romney Bid</HD>
<DH>Politics: Party endorses the gubernatorial nominee but rejects his
choice for running mate.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>LOWELL, Mass.
</DL>
<LD>The state's Republican Party endorsed Mitt Romney's bid for
governor Saturday but rejected the Salt Lake City Olympic chief's choice
for lieutenant governor.</LD>
<LD>   Romney, the son of a former Michigan governor, pledged to apply the
same efficiency and managerial common sense to running state government
that he used to oversee the Winter Olympics.</LD>
<LD>   "With a message of change and reform, and the resolve I know is
necessary to lead this state to its fullest potential, I proudly accept
your nomination for governor," he said.</LD>
<TE>   Romney returned to Massachusetts riding a wave of Olympic glory and
forced an acting governor, Jane Swift, and her hand-picked running mate,
Patrick Guerriero, to drop out of the race.</TE>
<TE>   Romney chose Kerry Murphy Healey, the state party chairwoman, as his
running mate. But even Romney's popularity was not enough to help Healey
at Saturday's party convention, at which about 2,700 Republican delegates
favored former party chairman James Rappaport by a 55%-to-45% margin.</TE>
<TE>   Rappaport, a millionaire real estate developer, said the vote showed
Republicans believe he is more capable of leading the state if something
were to happen to the governor.</TE>
<TE>   "We want the lieutenant governor to be able to step up to the plate,"
said Rappaport, who pledged to support Romney.</TE>
<TE>   Romney said he was "thrilled" by the outcome. His nomination was
capped by a shower of red, white and blue confetti and balloons.</TE>
<TE>   Swift urged Republicans to support Romney. She pledged to campaign for
his ticket in coming months, but she left to spend time with her family
before Romney got up to speak.</TE>

<LD>Global Crossing--A Feb. 24 chart in the Business section
significantly understated proceeds for stock trades made by several
directors of Global Crossing Ltd. The figures provided to The Times by
Thomson/Lancer Analytics did not use the correct selling price in
calculating the profits from the trades.</LD>
<LD>   Here are the correct figures, based on trades reported to the
Securities and Exchange Commission:</LD>
<LD>   Former Chief Executive Robert Annunziata made a $3.5-million profit
instead of a $2.2-million profit; former CEO Thomas J. Casey,
$8.9-million profit, instead of $8.4 million; Co-Chairman Lodwrick Cook,
$35.5-million profit, instead of $31.6 million; Chairman and founder Gary
Winnick, $577.9-million profit, instead of $359.6 million; and former CEO
and director Jack M. Scanlon, $23-million profit, instead of $4.3 million
(the original figure did not include trades that were reported under the
name John M. Scanlon).</LD>
<TE>   Former director Hillel Weinberger made a $21.7-million profit from
stock sales, not $204.1 million. The original figure included proceeds
from the sale of shares owned by an insurance company that Weinberger
represented on Global Crossing's board. The insurance company, a unit of
Loews/CNA Holdings Corp., grossed $227.9 million.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, Global Crossing director Norman Brownstein, who was
correctly listed as making a $1.4-million profit from selling stock, sold
his shares before he joined the company's board.</TE>
