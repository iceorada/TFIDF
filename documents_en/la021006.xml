<HD>Rackauckas Falls Short</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Bill Lockyer must be so tired of Orange County and its district
attorney.</LD>
<LD>   Four times, the state attorney general has been called on to
intervene in one allegation or another involving the county's top
prosecutor, Tony Rackauckas.</LD>
<LD>   Lockyer's office looked into accusations that the D.A. had used
public employees to help run his humbly named Tony Rackauckas
Foundation, a charity set up to help troubled youth. The state found
the charity was mismanaging its money and Rackauckas agreed to close
it, forestalling further investigation.</LD>
<TE>   Next, Rackauckas accused two deputies of stealing files to
investigate one of his political supporters. Lockyer declined to file
charges.</TE>
<TE>   Then the Orange County Grand Jury asked for help investigating
Rackauckas' office. That collaboration led to a grand jury report
that gave in great detail a picture of a district attorney
exceptionally drawn to making and keeping political friends and
looking after his own interests. There's the time that job applicants
whom Rackauckas wanted to hire fell short in the screening process.
Rackauckas changed the process and went on to hire family members of
his supporters. "Deputy district attorneys should be hired on merit
alone," the report concludes. That doesn't seem too much to ask.</TE>
<TE>   There was the public-employee time spent looking into whether
Rackauckas' grown son was misbehaving in another county, or whether
police had legally towed a car owned by the son of the D.A.'s
investigative chief. You would think a history like this would lead
to quick change. Rackauckas' only reaction was to fire back with an
even thicker report saying that his detractors had fooled the grand
jury. The county Board of Supervisors, short on conspicuous bravery,
sent the report to another agency. Guess where.</TE>
<TE>   Lockyer quickly disposed of the report by announcing that there
was nothing to charge Rackauckas with criminally. Still, the attorney
general had a few choice words, saying that Rackauckas was sadly
refusing to fix or even admit his many management mistakes. He
likened Rackauckas to judges who were "used to being kings of the
courtroom."</TE>
<TE>   Rackauckas just as quickly showed what he thought of the attorney
general's criticisms. Displaying an extraordinary lack of regard for
taxpayer money, he changed policy to allow funds allocated for
witness protection and other vital investigation costs to be used for
the purchase of food and alcohol to entertain politicians and
lobbyists.</TE>
<TE>   Rackauckas has fallen far short of the integrity and
professionalism that the job demands. The California District
Attorneys Assn. handbook says prosecutors must be held to higher
standards of candor and impartiality than most public officials. But
who will hold Rackauckas to that standard?</TE>
<TE>   The Board of Supervisors could have censured Rackauckas, but it
cannot change the way he runs his office. The D.A. is an elected
official. His only boss is the voting public. Earlier this year, the
voters kept him in office. At that point they had no grand jury
report laden with fault-finding, no attorney general criticizing the
imperial way the office is run. But as Rackauckas tries to work his
way up the political ladder, his opponents--and the voters--will be
armed with more information.</TE>

<LD>Unlikely as it might seem, California law is easier on people who
drive under the influence of illicit drugs than under the influence
of alcohol.</LD>
<LD>   That's one of the strange conclusions to a horrifying accident in
Anaheim Hills last year involving an overloaded big rig with faulty
brakes, driven by a man with methamphetamine and morphine in his
blood. The truck careened out of control near a school, killing one
person and injuring six others.</LD>
<LD>   Truck driver Anthony Saiz, who cut a deal last month, faces just a
year in county jail and loss of his commercial driving license. The
company that overloaded the truck with 2,000 extra pounds and
neglected to take care of problems with seven of its eight brakes
faces no disciplinary action at all.</LD>
<TE>   And the family of the 53-year-old optometrist who died?</TE>
<TE>   Stunned, once by his death and again by authorities' weak response
when it comes to taking serious steps to solve life-threatening
situations.</TE>
<TE>   As it turns out, prosecution for driving under the influence of
drugs is difficult in California; the penal code does not define a
blood-drug level for impaired driving, as it does for alcohol.</TE>
<TE>   Considering that legislators are finding time to worry about the
dangers of heavy school backpacks, they ought to be able to set
guidelines for drivers impaired by drug use.</TE>
<TE>   The California Highway Patrol moved quickly to inspect equipment
at the trucking company, Peterson Brothers Construction of Brea. It
slapped the company with an "unsatisfactory" rating after finding
poor truck maintenance and bad record-keeping.</TE>
<TE>   The CHP pulled at least four of the company's trucks from duty
because of serious problems.</TE>
<TE>   This on top of 24 citations for safety problems the company
received from April to October 2000, and a previous history of brake
problems with the truck that crashed.</TE>
<TE>   So what happened to Peterson Brothers? Well, it had to fix the
trucks.</TE>
<TE>   That's it. That's what CHP's on-site inspections are aimed at;
they don't come with fines or other discipline unless the trucking
company flunks three times in a row.</TE>
<TE>   If the worst punishment for failing to keep things safe is that
two years later you get caught and then have to keep things safe,
what's the incentive for doing it right in the first place?</TE>
<TE>   The CHP generally does on-site inspections no more than once every
25 months. All the more reason to make the inspections count;
trucking companies should worry more about what will happen if the
CHP finds something wrong.</TE>
<TE>   Until the state takes stronger action on motorist safety, perhaps
a new program in Orange County will help. Stymied by a shortage of
officers to check on truck safety, several law enforcement agencies
are pooling manpower to set up monthly truck checkpoints.</TE>
<TE>   In September, officers handed out 45 citations, along with fines
for many of them, and yanked three trucks off the road for such
problems as bald tires and bad brakes.</TE>
<TE>   It's a small solution to a big problem, but at least lax truckers
feel some pain when they're pulled over.</TE>

<LD>As traditional sources of water dry up, increasingly thirsty Orange
County is being forced to learn what tech-enamored investors
discovered as the dot-com bubble burst--it pays to diversify your
portfolio. But, just as investors must do their homework before
diversifying, county residents and businesses will have to spend
considerable time, effort and money to ensure that the region's
future water needs are met.</LD>
<LD>   Chances are good that most of us don't know where the water we use
to shower and keep the lawn green originates. But where water comes
from and what it costs to transport and purify are issues that no
longer can be ignored. And proposed solutions that have been attacked
by those who don't want them in their backyards must be embraced--or
there won't be enough water to keep those precious backyards green.</LD>
<LD>   The county's water supply is being hit by a triple whammy. Too
much water is being drawn from the aquifer that supplies water to 2.2
million people in the northern part of the county. Cities from
Anaheim to Irvine are becoming more reliant upon imported water. But
California is under federal order to reduce water drawn from the
Colorado River and there's less water available from Northern
California. Topping it all off, evidence suggests that the region is
on the verge of a prolonged drought.</LD>
<TE>   The most immediate threat comes from the aquifer that supplies 75%
of the drinking water in North County. The overdrawn and
under-replenished reservoir has sunk to dangerous levels.</TE>
<TE>   Water agencies will have to cut back pumping next year. Just how
painful the impending cutback will be won't be evident until the
rainy season.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the proposed solutions rely upon new technology. A
consortium of Southern California water districts has proposed seven
oceanfront desalinization plants, including one in Dana Point, at a
cumulative cost of $1 billion. Others are controversial--including
the installation of pumps at the bottom of former sand and gravel
mines, a project that would help replenish the aquifer, but that also
would kill thousands of fish and temporarily send a putrid odor into
Villa Park and Orange.</TE>
<TE>   The perpetual plea for increased conservation will grow louder.
Water-wise Southern Californians who already manage with less water
per capita than residents elsewhere in the U.S. must recognize that
the end of cheap water means learning to conserve even more of the
precious stuff.</TE>

<LD>Re "Lowered Aquifer Will Raise Water Imports and Cost," Sept. 24:</LD>
<LD>   Considering that we're in the midst of a serious drought, I can't
say I'm surprised that Orange County has overdrawn its water supply
by 133 billion gallons.</LD>
<LD>   However, I find it interesting that just four days before this
article, The Times ran a story saying the state Department of Health
Services has given the green light to Poseidon Resources' proposed
seawater desalination facility in Huntington Beach. I hope the Orange
County Water District is working with Poseidon so that Orange County
has access to this vast new source of drinking water.</LD>
<TE>   Southern California will be getting less and less water from
Northern California and the Colorado River in the near future. And as
the supply of imported water goes down, the cost will go up. Instead
of continuing our reliance on imported water, we need to pursue local
water sources such as desalination.</TE>
<TE>   William D. Lochrie</TE>
<TE>   Fullerton</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The unfortunate mind-set of area planners seems to be that our
ocean is a trash receptacle.</TE>
<TE>   Case in point: a half-baked plan to build the largest desalination
plant in the country in southeast Huntington Beach.</TE>
<TE>   As a person who tries to stay involved in local water-quality
issues, I have gone to the trouble of attending several meetings held
by Poseidon Resources, the would-be builder of this nightmare waiting
to happen, as well as studying the environmental impact report it has
put forth.</TE>
<TE>   Let me be the first to debunk the myth that we need the water.</TE>
<TE>   As I write this letter, many gallons of water are being wasted,
and I have no reason to believe that, were we to procure more water
from the desalination process, we wouldn't waste that as well.</TE>
<TE>   Further, the Orange County Sanitation District dumps 243 million
gallons of effluent each day out of its outfall pipe.</TE>
<TE>   More than 99% of this discharge is water, ripe for full
reclamation. To those naysayers who think the public wouldn't drink
reclaimed waste water, may I point out that here in our area, we
already drink from the Santa Ana River, which is made up by and large
of treated waste water from sanitation districts upstream of the
Prado Dam.</TE>
<TE>   Further, it is easier to clean waste water than ocean water. And
what about the briny discharge? Poseidon plans to dump the discharge
into the ocean, and the 500-foot surrounding area is projected to be
10% above background salinity. Just imagine what this area would look
like after a few years of this.</TE>
<TE>   Building this expensive and destructive plant will lock us into a
primitive way of dealing with our coastal environment for many years
to come.</TE>

<TE>   Re "Attorney General to Probe Decision on Water Quality," Sept.
24:</TE>
<TE>   The Santa Ana Regional Water Quality Control Board is widening its
attack on perchlorate contamination in local ground water, not
weakening the investigation.</TE>
<TE>   At our Sept. 13 hearing, the board ordered an investigation of all
parties that may be responsible. The board's decision to rescind its
order against Goodrich Corp. and Kwikset Corp. was based on the
likelihood that focusing on two potential sources of the problem,
rather than up to 40, would not have yielded immediate progress.</TE>
<TE>   The board clearly recognizes the severity of this problem and the
need for immediate progress. Our revised approach is already bearing
fruit. Earlier this week Goodrich was ordered to begin an
investigation of perchlorate contamination at its former site in
Rialto.</TE>
<TE>   Many similar orders will be forthcoming in the days and weeks
ahead, as we move forward with maintaining the safety of our water
supply in the Inland Empire.</TE>

Sept. 22:</LD>
<LD>   Dean J. Slocum wonders why the true fans of the great game of
baseball are not whirling the turnstiles at Anaheim Stadi- ... er ...
Edison Field. Correctly, he points out that this year's Anaheim
Angels are playing the old-fashioned version of the game with smarts,
fundamentals, aggression, power, patience, execution and a little bit
of luck. So, Mr. Slocum asks, where are his fellow fans?</LD>
<TE>   The answer is that baseball continues to reap what it has sown,
and the evidence is in the bleachers in Anaheim and my living room in
Santa Ana, every night.</TE>
<TE>   I grew up here, my home was five minutes from the Big A, and I
watched it being built with great anticipation. I could not attend
the inaugural opening day in 1966 because I had a prior commitment: I
was playing left field for my own team in the Pee-Wee division of
Little League, and our fields were practically in the shadows of
Anaheim Stadium. My father had access to season tickets in the first
three rows behind home plate. Many a game I attended with my family
and sat in a pure adolescent rapture, close enough to hear the thump
of footsteps as my heroes trotted across the sweet-smelling, perfect
grass to and from the dugout.</TE>
<TE>   Then it all changed. The players rebelled against the abusive
tyranny of the owners and won the rights of fair employment that all
the rest of us enjoy. But in so doing, they ripped apart the very
fabric of the game that had melded the individual players into a
team, and fused that team into the very psyche of their fans. The
conflicts between owners and players have resulted in strike after
lockout after strike. As the costs of fielding a competitive team
rose, individual and family owners were forced to sell their stakes
in their clubs to those entities that could afford to step into the
void--corporations staffed with bureaucrats blind to the history of
the sport, or to the value and meaning it offers the community.</TE>
<TE>   Throughout the years we true fans were left behind. Over time,
more and more of us declared that we would never be back, and more
and more of us kept our word. Sometimes it happened after a labor
dispute, sometimes after a change in ticket distribution, sometimes
because there was no longer any connection to the corporation's
"staff" of players on the field. In any case, there will always be
other people and their beach balls to take up some, if not all, of
the slack, chatting on their cell phones and cheering for either side
as need be.</TE>
<TE>   So where are the true fans? Sitting at home, like me, watching the
occasional game on television or listening to the radio. It's a place
where we can follow the game without beach balls or sushi platters.
It's a place where we can smoke a cigar, or have a beer in the eighth
inning. It's a place where we can still afford a good-enough seat to
refine our studies of the game without dumping hordes of cash into
the wallets of the owners or the players.</TE>
<TE>   And, perhaps in the most fateful result, while thousands of folks
remain trapped in the parking lot trying to get away, home is where I
can walk outside immediately after the game and teach my son how to
play soccer.</TE>

fair to the fans and not to the scalpers!</TE>

<TE>   Effects of Unjust Drug Laws Aren't Unintended</TE>
<TE>   Re "Unintended Effect of War on Drugs Found in Study," Sept. 20:</TE>
<TE>   The article makes it abundantly clear that there has been a
decades-long process of "drug enforcement" that has resulted in the
incarceration of hundreds of thousands of minority and poor
individuals. Most of the prisoners are nonviolent, low-level
offenders, and a disproportionate share are minorities. Given the
information in the article, the headline is misleading and
outrageous. This outcome of the war on drugs is well-known and
predictable, not unintended. These punitive policies will continue to
have their intended effects until our lawmakers and opinion leaders
find it in their interests to change the unjust drug laws.</TE>

<TE>   Bloated Government Breeds Tax Cheaters</TE>
<TE>   Re "Prison Terms Affirm IRS Campaign on Tip Income," Sept. 28:</TE>
<TE>   The Times' Business section reported on four Nevada casino workers
who had been sentenced for cheating and helping others cheat on taxes
on tip income.</TE>
<TE>   The real story here is that our government has grown too big and
heavy. As a result, the taxes to feed it have become so crushing that
working-class people are increasingly willing to risk imprisonment to
avoid paying them. We know this because the article said the Internal
Revenue Service is pursuing other cases. Government's remedy is to
use brute force, or the threat of same. This is the wrong
prescription.</TE>
<TE>   The proper remedy, and the only just one, is to reduce the size of
government to the point where ordinary Americans no longer feel
compelled to take extraordinary risks to escape its weight.</TE>
<TE>   If our politicians cannot bring themselves to prescribe the proper
remedy, Americans will find other ways to escape the leviathan's
crush. Government's response will be to use more brute force, that is
to say, it will become more oppressive. As it becomes more
oppressive, we will lose our love and respect for our country and our
wonderful laboratory for self-government will begin to collapse.</TE>

<LD>Re "Handicap-Parking Crackdown on Target," Sept. 22:</LD>
<LD>   My wife and I are in our late 70s. She is badly afflicted with
arthritis. She has already had a hip replaced. When she has a good
day, we may go shopping. Her two-hour stroll around the mall can be
covered by me and many other people in about 20 minutes. She wishes
to be as independent as she can; she is just slower and rests more.
And those are the good days.</LD>
<LD>   I don't use the marked spaces when driving without my wife.</LD>

<TE>   Christine Hanley's article is well-written and an eye-opener, even
for me, a person with a disability who needs a handicap parking space
for my van's side-loading ramp. I had suspected some abuse of
handicap placard use, but I am surprised at the extent and the number
of violations in Irvine alone. I have found it extremely difficult to
find handicap parking at the Irvine Spectrum and local shopping
centers.</TE>
<TE>   Hats off to the Irvine police for their good work. I thank them
for making my life, and those of all legitimate handicap-placard
users in Irvine, a little easier. I encourage other cities to follow
Irvine's good example. Coffee, anyone?</TE>
<TE>   Phyllis Collier</TE>
<TE>   Irvine</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Not all handicaps are visible, and just because a person is not in
a wheelchair does not mean that person can walk very well or very far
without stopping.</TE>
<TE>   I had chemotherapy last year, which weakened me so much that many
times I could walk only 30 feet before I had to stop and rest. But if
I had let somebody push me around in a wheelchair all the time,
(there was no way I could have pushed it) I would have become even
more disabled. (I have recovered, thank you.)</TE>
<TE>   My late husband had kidney disease, which reduced his blood count
to the bare minimum. There were times he could barely walk.</TE>
<TE>   My daughter has a heart condition that could have killed her a
long time ago. Because of that health problem, she has a hard time
breathing and is rather weak. But she stays out of the wheelchair as
much as she can because she does not wish to depend on it.</TE>
<TE>   The author of the letter saying that only wheelchair users should
get handicap parking doesn't understand a whole range of illnesses
and disabilities. I hope he will never find himself in this position.
In the meantime, I can only say that his gripe is mean-spirited.</TE>
<TE>   Irena Weygold</TE>
<TE>   Irvine</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Hooray for the Irvine police crackdown and the article on the
abuse of handicap parking privileges in Irvine. I hope this attention
to the problem will eliminate the need to grocery shop at 7 a.m. on
Saturdays, just so I can park in a handicap spot.</TE>
<TE>   While placard abuse poses the biggest obstacle for disabled
individuals searching for a parking place, other habits displayed by
insensitive people that often translate to big problems for
mobility-impaired persons are:</TE>
<TE>   Contrary to popular belief, the striped areas around the handicap
parking spaces are not for shopping carts, motorcycles or very small
cars. Disabled drivers and/or passengers need this space to swing
vehicle doors open as wide as possible; to maneuver a wheelchair,
walker, oxygen tank or other device.</TE>
<TE>   Blinking hazard lights of an illegally parked vehicle don't send
any kind of clear, positive message to disabled drivers. Do the
blinking lights mean we should be understanding because there's some
kind of emergency in Ralphs that the able-bodied driver had to
address? Do they mean that we should sit and wait for that driver to
return to the illegally parked vehicle? Or perhaps they're intended
for the police--a plea of sorts to allow that driver to park
illegally for a short period of time.</TE>
<TE>   Carry on, Irvine police. Disabled drivers in Irvine and beyond
applaud you.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Davis' 1-2 Punch Helps O.C.," Sept. 29:</LD>
<LD>   The Times editorializes, "Let's hope that remaining holdouts get
the message that the war over El Toro is over." This message is
particularly true for the cities of North County that joined the
Orange County Regional Airport Authority.</LD>
<LD>   Prodded by Newport Beach, which has legitimate concerns about John
Wayne Airport in its backyard, other city councils put their time,
money and effort into the failed fight for El Toro. They sued the
county to try to overturn Measure W by litigation and lost. As losers
in the lawsuit, they could be liable for the initiative proponents'
legal bills if the Airport Working Group of Newport Beach won't cover
the costs.</LD>
<TE>   It's time to realize that North County residents opposed a county
park at El Toro not because they want another airport, but primarily
because they were deceived by the Airport Working Group that a park
would result in a "great tax."</TE>
<TE>   Irvine and the Navy have worked out a plan whereby the park will
be funded by private development. There will be no tax. It is time
these cities stop doing the Airport Working Group's bidding, to quit
the regional airport authority and put their energies back into city
business.</TE>
<TE>   Tell your city council it's time to let go of El Toro and move on.</TE>

<LD>Re "The Battle to Win Hearts and Minds Has to Begin at Home," Sept.
26</LD>
<LD>   I could not help but comment on the simple irony embedded in Norah
Vincent's op-ed piece on terrorism and "academia's left-lurching
views." She fears that young people are at risk to become un-American
because their leftist professors at the top universities don't
require them to study American history and its best traditions. She
takes comfort in President Bush's new initiatives on history
education, believing this will engender a pro-American sentiment. She
also reports that only about 3% of these subversive professors are
even "somewhat conservative," implying that they are, well,
un-American.</LD>
<LD>   Wait a minute. Shouldn't these professors be exemplars for both
Vincent and for the president's programs? After all, they are, if
anything, educated. And if the great majority of these highly
educated people--including scholars of American history--are
presumably un-American, why would she then assume that a good
education leads naturally to her brand of patriotism? Is it possible
that higher education may result in the construction of a view of
America, its history and its place on the world stage that is more
conflicted and complicated than the one possessed by Vincent?</LD>
<TE>   Be careful, Norah: Higher education--learning to think critically,
self-reflectively and for oneself--is a powerful, intellectual
experience that does not yield to any one, preconceived paradigm of
right and wrong, good and evil.</TE>

<LD>Re "Flight of the Night Owl," Sept. 13:</LD>
<LD>   It's great that the Orange County Transportation Authority has
decided to provide bus service for those who work the night shift.
Now they also should consider whether the "one-size-fits-all"
approach is appropriate.</LD>
<LD>   During many times of the day (and the night, I'm sure) there are
few passengers on these huge vehicles. How about providing equal or
better service with a mix of standard buses (for the busy routes) and
smaller vehicles (like the parking shuttle at the airport)? We don't
need the cost of so many standard buses or the diesel fumes they
produce.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Davis OKs Paid Family Leave Bill," Sept. 24:</LD>
<LD>   As I read the measure, most California workers will get 55% for up
to six weeks to care for sick family members. And they say the funds
will come from payroll deductions averaging about $26 a year. You
don't really believe this number will cover it, do you? There hasn't
been a liberal program that cost anywhere near the initial estimates.
Prime examples are Medicare, Social Security and welfare.</LD>
<LD>   Who will check to see if claims are legitimate? If this sounds
like another massive state bureaucracy, you're right. Why do we need
this? Most employees have paid vacations, paid sick leave and paid
maternity benefits. Why can't these be used? This is just another
attack on business by Democrats and another sop to labor unions in
order to keep their vote.</LD>
<TE>   Bob Franz</TE>
<TE>   Placentia</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The reason small business is opposed to the Family Leave Act is
that, first, it is seen as just a foot in the door; trust me, in the
future the door will be pried open more and more, and employers will
be required to pay for the benefit as another business tax.</TE>
<TE>   Second, the act interferes with an employer's freedom to negotiate
with valued employees in order to keep them, and dismiss employees
that were deadwood anyway. Now a marginal employee will be guaranteed
that his job will stay open, and his employer will be prevented from
hiring a permanent replacement, with the result that productivity and
income to the business (which is, after all, what pays the salaries
of the other employees) will be lost.</TE>

<LD>Re "Unity May Yet Break Out in Fractious Media Clan," Sept. 16:</LD>
<LD>   Pictures such as the ones of Tim Hoiles published in The Times
this morning, posing so proudly with the animals he shot and had
mounted, undeniably confirms the position of the newspaper (the
Orange County Register) his family owns. The stance of this
newspaper, as many know or should know, is anti-environment,
anti-animal rights and all-out development at blinding/breakneck
speeds.</LD>
<LD>   Tim Hoiles, great white hunter, would have much more of a
challenge with these creatures he killed if he ever were to consider
sneaking up on them and bagging them with a camera.</LD>
<TE>   But I imagine the mere thought of this is overwhelming to such a
being. What would he then fill his mansion's manly room with, mere
photos?</TE>

<HD>David Charnay, 90; Journalist, Publicist and TV Syndicator</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>DENNIS McLELLAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>David Charnay, a onetime journalist, public relations advisor and
industrialist who headed Four Star Television Productions from the
late 1960s through the early '80s, has died. He was 90.</LD>
<LD>   Charnay, who also wrote novels, died Wednesday of complications
from surgery at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   In 1967, Charnay led a syndicate that bought controlling interest
in Four Star Productions, the prolific television production and
distribution company founded in 1955 by several stars, including Dick
Powell, David Niven and Charles Boyer.</LD>
<TE>   As president, chief executive and chairman of the board of Four
Star, Charnay turned the company into a powerhouse syndicator of its
large library of shows, which included "The Rifleman," "Wanted: Dead
or Alive," "The Rogues" and "The Big Valley."</TE>
<TE>   Born in New York City, Charnay attended Wesleyan University and
New York University before going to work as a reporter for the New
York Daily News and the New York Daily Mirror. During World War II,
he served in the Office of Strategic Services.</TE>
<TE>   In the early '50s, he founded New York City-headquartered Allied
Public Relations, whose clients included John L. Lewis, Madame Chiang
Kai-shek, Cecil B. DeMille, Jimmy Hoffa, Richard M. Nixon and Hubert
H. Humphrey.</TE>
<TE>   After leaving public relations in the early '60s, Charnay served
as chairman of Highway Trailers, Clinton Engines and Ward La France,
and later was president and chief executive of Transcontinental
Industries.</TE>
<TE>   His first novel, "Target 1600," a political thriller, was
published in 1980. His second, "Operation Lucifer: The Chase, Capture
and Trial of Adolf Hitler," was published last year.</TE>
<TE>   He is survived by his wife, Martha, of Calabasas; a son, John, of
Los Angeles; two daughters, Janis Charnay of Palm Springs and
Jeannette Hower of Chaparral, N.M.; his sister, Beatrice Maybruck of
New York City; and seven grandchildren.</TE>
<TE>   His funeral will be Tuesday in New York City. A memorial service
will be held in Los Angeles at a later date. In lieu of flowers,
donations may be made to the Leukemia Society.</TE>

<HD>Donors Help Youths to Stand on Their Own</HD>
<DH>At Five Acres group homes, a special fund prepares teens
for when they must leave and become independent.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOCELYN Y. STEWART</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The worst thing about living in a group home was not the rules, or
the food or being away from family. The worst thing about living in a
group home was leaving it.</LD>
<LD>   For Dawn Hamilton, growing up in a Five Acres group home in
Altadena felt like being with family. The staff and other youngsters
loved her, and she knew it. As a teen, she also knew the grim
statistics about foster children who leave the system: About 25%
become homeless, 30% go on welfare, 45% are unemployed.</LD>
<LD>   Even as Hamilton felt the "going-away-to-college jitters" and the
uncertainty of leaving the only stable home she had ever known, she
also had a cache of life skills. A scholarship fund and emancipation
program set up by donors Merrill and Donivee Nash of Arcadia had made
sure of that.</LD>
<TE>   "They taught us how to budget, how to save money, even how to
change a tire," said the 21-year-old. "We learned things you'd learn
in a family. I think Five Acres kids are more prepared than most."</TE>
<TE>   Based in Altadena, Five Acres is a nonprofit therapeutic treatment
and education center for abused and neglected children. Often,
children arrive at Five Acres' door with numerous unsuccessful
placements in foster and group homes on their records. Hamilton had
17.</TE>
<TE>   Some, like Hamilton, stay because they have no possibility of ever
returning to their families. They live in one of four group homes in
Pasadena or Altadena. For Five Acres, there is a dual task: Staff
members seek to repair years of damage and abuse. They also prepare
teens for when they turn 18 and must leave.</TE>
<TE>   "They started from Day One, molding me into the man I am today,"
said Christopher Michael James Ervin, a 19-year-old Cal State
Northridge student, who now lives on campus. "They helped me be able
to stand on my own feet."</TE>
<TE>   The work begins well before they reach 18. To get children ready
for college, the fund often pays for tutoring and private schools.
The emancipation program teaches them an array of coping mechanisms
and life skills, from how to dress appropriately to being on time.</TE>
<TE>   Once emancipated, youths can call up staffer Mona Luther, a
beloved grandmother figure, for help with rent, furniture,
tuition--even car repairs. Assistance is not limited to the
college-bound. One student is in culinary school; another is at
drafting school.</TE>
<TE>   "All we want to do is help them become happy, productive,
self-sufficient adults," said Donivee Nash, who has served as head of
the scholarship committee.</TE>
<TE>   The Nashes, a retired couple who once owned a company that
manufactured forming systems for concrete, were searching for a
charitable cause when they visited Five Acres. Though impressed with
the organization, which was founded in 1888 as an orphanage, they saw
a gap: At 18, the children "were just sort of turned loose," Donivee
Nash said. "We thought something ought to be done to help them make
the transition."</TE>
<TE>   There is some governmental assistance to support the educational
pursuits of post-18-year-old teens who have been in foster care or
residential programs. "But it's not sufficient," said Cathy Clement,
Five Acres development director. "The Nashes are committed to
bridging the gap.</TE>
<TE>   "It's very hands-on philanthropy. You get to see very soon the
benefits of your giving."</TE>
<TE>   In 1988, the couple made a donation that has since grown to a fund
of more than half a million dollars--and has assisted more than 30
young people so far.</TE>
<TE>   Hamilton arrived at Five Acres when she was 5. The domestic
violence, abuse and mental illness in her own home meant she would
spend the rest of her childhood there.</TE>
<TE>   Even with the home's support and under the watchful eye of Jackie
Perry, a now-deceased group home manager she lovingly called Mom,
Hamilton had a hard time from 12 to 15. She experimented with
marijuana and boys and once attempted suicide, she said. She
questioned God.</TE>
<TE>   "When I was bad and doing the worst things, [Perry] punished me,
but I knew she loved me, and that's what broke through to me,"
Hamilton said.</TE>
<TE>   The fund sent Hamilton, an honor student, to a private high
school, where she flourished--and where she discovered a faith that
has helped her see her difficult past through a different prism. One
night, she was riding in a van with her group home family when she
spotted her father, tattered and dirty, sitting on a bus bench.</TE>
<TE>   "Even though he was homeless, he was reading his Bible. I just
broke down and cried," she recalled.</TE>
<TE>   At home, she prayed, pleading for help for her father, once the
object of her anger. She emerged changed, having decided to give her
life to God.</TE>
<TE>   Now a student at Biola University, a religious college in La
Mirada, she said her goal is to be a nurse and to continue surviving
on her own. Holidays are still tough, she said, especially when the
dorm is shut down and she has to spend time at friends' homes.
Because of the fund, she is in school and housed during the summer
months.</TE>
<TE>   "I wish there were more people like her in the world," she said of
Donivee Nash. "God will bless her many times over for everything
she's done."</TE>
<TE>   Ervin was a confused and emotionally battered 10-year-old when he
arrived at Five Acres. He had already been in nearly 30 homes. Perry
promised him that his moving days were over.</TE>
<TE>   "At the time, I took that with a grain of salt because of what I
had been through," Ervin said.</TE>
<TE>   Abandoned by a drug-addicted mother, who once kidnapped him from a
home, and by a father who was never around, Ervin had had no parental
figure in his life, and he had no confidence. Because of a malformed
jaw, he was the brunt of teasing and jokes.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't fit in anywhere," Ervin said. "I was a troubled child."</TE>
<TE>   But year after year, he saw Perry's promise fulfilled. The staff
there helped him wade through the muck of his past until the future
became clearer.</TE>
<TE>   Five Acres helped arrange for the successful surgery that repaired
his jaw and is helping him with his college education.</TE>
<TE>   Now, like Hamilton, his talk is mostly focused on plans for the
future: a career in real estate, a wife, kids, a home. His family, he
hopes, will have everything he missed.</TE>
<TE>   Their lives might have turned out very differently, had it not
been for Five Acres and the fund started by the Nashes, Hamilton
said.</TE>
<TE>   "Foster kids without an organization like Five Acres--how do they
do it?" Hamilton asked.</TE>

<LD>It's 11:30 a.m. Richard, a veteran Orange County teacher--exhausted,
but still committed--lines up his third-graders and leads them across
campus to the school's one working lavatory. As the line threads
through the crumbling halls, Richard and his students are suddenly
plunged into darkness.</LD>
<LD>   Richard sighs. The kids laugh and shrug. Just another rolling
blackout.</LD>
<LD>   Richard's wife, Lydia, works 26 miles from the couple's home, but
usually spends more than three hours each day commuting on the
impossibly crowded highways between her office and her house.</LD>
<TE>   Richard and Lydia's son, Paul, a lifeguard at a popular beach, has
the sad responsibility of ensuring that none of the thousands of
beachgoers venture anywhere near the water because of contamination.</TE>
<TE>   This fictional family's story is a dramatic example of what
happens when we do not invest in or pay attention to our
infrastructure. Every day, such nitty-gritty nuts-and-bolts issues
affect the millions of Orange County residents who use our school
facilities, drink and swim in our water, drive our highways, and use
our parks and airports.</TE>
<TE>   Critical infrastructure systems and facilities are fast
approaching the end of their useful lives in many regions of
California.</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately, Orange County is no exception. Its population
continues to grow, putting increasing pressure on an aging
infrastructure that is struggling to keep up, and more frequently
failing in the effort.</TE>
<TE>   Shortfalls in federal and state funding have placed a tremendous
burden on these aging systems. Another key factor, however, is that
Orange County residents consistently pay more in federal taxes than
the federal government returns to Orange County. Simply put, we are a
donor county in a donor state.</TE>
<TE>   For the past several years this deficit has averaged more than $28
billion per year, statewide, with Orange County's loss, in highway
funds alone, about $68 million last year.</TE>
<TE>   In contrast, states such as Alabama have congressional delegations
that understand the importance of infrastructure projects, and
federal funding in that state is at a surplus of more than $11
billion.</TE>
<TE>   Some months ago, a group of concerned people who place great value
on the quality of life in Orange County began meeting to determine
what it will take to turn this situation around.</TE>
<TE>   As a first step, the UC Irvine Civil and Environmental Engineering
Affiliates teamed with the American Society of Civil Engineers and
many other groups to take on the task of assessing the condition,
capacity and operations of Orange County's infrastructure.</TE>
<TE>   Months of research, evaluation and data analysis by these
professionals, drawn from both the public and private sectors, will
soon culminate in the Orange County Infrastructure Report Card. The
report card, to be released Thursday by the UCI Department of Civil
and Environmental Engineering Affiliates, will focus on eight areas:
aviation, transportation, schools, water supply, waste water, solid
waste, parks and recreation, and urban runoff/flood control.</TE>
<TE>   Though the report card will give us an idea of how to proceed,
ultimately it remains for Orange County residents themselves to take
the next steps toward restoring and improving our infrastructure. We
need to express our concerns to public officials at all levels of
government. We need to support local, state and federal officials who
understand and are committed to infrastructure renewal.</TE>
<TE>   Infrastructure should be an election issue, just like education,
crime and health care. We must also ensure passage of local bond
issues to repair, replace, and expand our transportation and water
systems as well as our schools and recreational facilities. Our
neighbors, governor and elected representatives in Sacramento and
Washington need to hear from us.</TE>
<TE>   The old joke about the human organs bickering about "who's the
king of the human body" is very appropriate--the "king" turns out to
be the organ we least like to talk about, because if it doesn't
function perfectly, it gums up the whole works!</TE>
<TE>   What is true for the human body holds equally for the body
politic. So if we wish to continue with the so-called higher
activities of human concern, we must immediately begin to pay
attention to issues like waste water treatment and sewer systems.</TE>
<TE>   It seems obvious that these issues of basic, essential urban
services that are required for all human activities go beyond
political party, ethnic identity or socioeconomic position. These
common (in all senses of the word) issues should unify us as
neighbors and spur us to establish effective coalitions that can
develop, articulate and advance coherent plans to renew the concrete
foundations of our life together. As "unsexy" as that sounds, it all
boils down to infrastructure.</TE>

<HD>Dark Day in Newport History</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAN D. VANDERSLOOT</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As a 20-plus-year resident of Newport Beach, I can't remember a more
naked abuse of power than the day the city government used the cloak
of darkness to cut down 23 of 25 ficus trees on Balboa Peninsula's
Main Street. On Sept. 18, the city showed a blatant disrespect for
its citizens, its policies and ordinances as it rushed to cut down
the trees before citizens could appeal a Superior Court decision to
an appellate court. As it turned out, the appellate court issued a
stay of the destruction at 11 a.m., but by that time the city had
managed to cut down 23 trees--an average of a tree every 10 minutes.</LD>
<LD>   In a stealth maneuver worthy of Desert Storm, the city mobilized
its police force and staff during the predawn hours to cordon off the
area. The city acted like a sleazy developer who takes advantage of
the lag time between courts to ensure that the natural resource is
gone.</LD>
<LD>   I'm sure the general services director, the city manager, and the
mayor are gloating over this subterfuge, but it stinks to high
heaven. This was nothing to be proud of, and it speaks volumes about
the city leadership's attitude toward its citizens.</LD>
<TE>   The city was disrespectful of its citizens because we were
negotiating to save the designated Special City Trees on the north
side of the street, and enough of the trees on the south side to
retain the arbor or canopy while removing the problem trees on that
side. The Special City Trees were protected by the city policy
because they were designated as landmark trees that could only be
removed because of death, disease or the creation of a hazardous
situation. Negotiations continued right up to the time the city took
the precipitous action to remove all the trees.</TE>
<TE>   On Sept. 13, the city offered to retain the 10 Special City
Trees--something it should have done anyway under its existing tree
policy--and just two of the 15 trees on the south side, clearly not
enough to maintain the arbor or canopy on the ocean side of the
street.</TE>
<TE>   The Balboa Arbor Society--a private, nonprofit group--was
evaluating this proposal and did not reject it, instead asking for
one more week to continue the court challenge and poll members. There
still would have been enough time for the city to remove the trees if
we could not arrive at a settlement. The society asked the city to
consider saving every other tree on the south side, but this was
flatly rejected by the city, which adopted a take-it-or-leave-it
negotiating stance.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile the Monday court date loomed, and once the Superior
Court decided in favor of the city on a technicality, the city
pounced. Forget the citizens, forget the trees, forget the settlement
discussions. Get the police out there, don't tell anyone, use
deception to spread the false word that the trees would be removed
next week, ignore the noise ordinance, start work before the courts
opened, and get rid of the trees once and for all.</TE>
<TE>   The rapidity of the tree removal Wednesday morning was astonishing
and showed military precision. It showed that the city could remove
the trees at any time along the way within a matter of hours,
ultimately not making a whit of a difference in the timing of the
Balboa Village Improvement Project, which will be continuing through
June. Clearly the trees could have stayed until the process played
out. A compromise was in the offing, and a win-win was possible.</TE>
<TE>   Instead the city acted like Big Brother. It did not show respect,
and it abused its power to bowl over citizen opposition. In the
meantime, the Balboa Arbor Society was uncovering evidence that
disproved the allegations of sewer blockage and property damage that
were claimed as the reasons for removing the trees.</TE>
<TE>   Sure, there were merchants with significant problems, and the
trees that caused these problems could be removed or the roots pruned
to eliminate the problems.</TE>
<TE>   This was acknowledged by all who were involved in the discussions.
The Balboa Arbor Society was also researching treatments that could
have preserved the trees while minimizing the problems caused by the
roots. The city could have used these solutions in other areas of the
city as well to solve problems caused by tree root and infrastructure
interactions.</TE>
<TE>   These solutions are needed to solve future problems as the urban
forest matures. We don't need to cut down mature trees that benefit
air quality, water quality, aesthetics and the general ambience. We
do need to find solutions, because trees and their roots continue to
grow and need to be properly maintained to reduce liability, sewer
blockage and property damage.</TE>
<TE>   The city needs the help of its citizens to be engaged and
cooperate in problem solving. If city leaders cannot work with
citizens as shown by this ficus tree fiasco, then we need a change in
leadership. City leaders come and go. The citizens stay.</TE>

<LD>"I want to make Los Angeles the safest big city in America."</LD>
<LD>   Mayor James K. Hahn's mission for a new LAPD must strike residents
of neighborhoods where homicides are skyrocketing and weapons poke
from passing cars as a naive dream. His choice of a brash,
goal-oriented, anti-crime crusader as police chief makes that vision
less farfetched.</LD>
<LD>   In picking former New York Police Commissioner William J. Bratton,
the mayor defied political convention and made an appointment based
on record and reputation. In picking an unyielding out-of-towner, he
showed that he can stand up to the LAPD's infamously insular
insiders. In nominating a showboat, he proved he's not afraid of
having his less-than-commanding presence overshadowed.</LD>
<TE>   Despite a few predictable squawks, the City Council will confirm
Bratton swiftly, and then the chief needs to attack two interlinked
priorities hard. Lowering violent crime must top his list. On Friday,
Bratton expressed an eagerness to take on the city's criminal street
gangs, and we encourage him to do so within the community policing
strategy he has embraced. Feasibility will be in the details. He
plans to bring the Los Angeles Police Department into the new century
by using computers to track crime and assigning cops (with Palms no
less) where needed. He also plans to focus on seemingly small,
"quality of life" issues, and has astutely targeted
graffiti--especially gang tags--as a problem that undercuts Los
Angeles' civic pride.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike in New York, however, he can't clean up this sprawling city
by sending in beat cops on foot and bicycle--even if he had New
York's 40,000 officers, even if the 9,000 men and women who wear an
LAPD badge were all perfect humans.</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately, they're not. And quality of life is a hollow
promise if some residents feel disrespected by and remain frightened
of the people who are supposed to protect and serve them. So, after a
decade bracketed by the Rodney King beating and the Rampart scandal,
Bratton also must face down criminal cops. He has to break the code
of silence, protect whistle-blowers and accelerate the department's
implementation of the internally unpopular consent decree--a bold
goal he and Hahn have already discussed. He has to push his cops from
their bunker mentality and into problem solving. All this will annoy
some cops, at least initially, making it even trickier to achieve
what should be Bratton's second goal: improving officer morale.
Without that, nothing else will happen. Luckily, his obvious
affection for his fellow cops will help. Bratton has been enamored of
the LAPD since he first watched TV's "Dragnet." "I loved that show,"
he said. "Now I'm getting to live it."</TE>
<TE>   He already has a plan for shaking up the command and a knack for
recognizing talent. Insiders he seems likely to lean on include
Cmdrs. Jim McDonnell, Sharon Papa, George Gascon and Deputy Chief
David Kalish. If the confidence he exudes is genuine, LAPD old-timers
who refuse to get with the program had better get out of the way.</TE>
<TE>   In this heavily Latino city, many hoped for a chief who could
trill his Rs. They got instead a native Bostonian who drops them
completely. But if Bratton can achieve the "pahtnership" he envisions
between the people and the police, Los Angeles just may stand a
chance of becoming the country's safest city.</TE>

<LD>Rebellious farmers and ranchers from along the California-Oregon
border threatened to seize U.S. Bureau of Reclamation water-diversion
facilities by force more than a year ago after the bureau took the
irrigation water they had been using and turned it back into the
Klamath River to save endangered species of fish.</LD>
<LD>   It was an ugly scene. In severe drought conditions, crops were
drying up and farmers were going broke. Finally in July, Interior
Secretary Gale A. Norton ordered the release of some water from Upper
Klamath Lake to the farmers.</LD>
<LD>   This year, the farmers were assured they would get their full
supply, reducing Klamath flows from the year before by 25%. Both
Norton and Agriculture Secretary Anne M. Veneman traveled to the
Klamath to make the high-visibility announcement, part of a campaign
to achieve "balance" between users of resources and the
environment--another way of saying the Clinton administration went
too far in protecting the environment.</LD>
<TE>   Now, in the last two weeks, 20,000 to 30,000 mature salmon
swimming upstream to spawn have died in the shallow waters of the
Klamath. Environmental groups, members of the Yurok tribe, the
Pacific Coast Federation of Fishermen's Assns. and businesses along
the river are up in arms.</TE>
<TE>   Fisheries experts say the chinook salmon, weighing up to 40
pounds, succumbed to a combination of protozoa and bacterial
infection. The exact cause may not be known for months. But water
temperatures on the Klamath reached as high as 72 degrees--lethal for
salmon. State officials also say the salmon were vulnerable because
so many of them were crowded into the same dwindling waters.</TE>
<TE>   Norton ordered increased river flows for 14 days in an attempt to
stop the die-off. But there isn't enough water in the Klamath to meet
all needs, especially in a dry year. Ultimately, the federal
government needs to buy up some of the farms and idle their fields.</TE>
<TE>   Soon, the endangered coho salmon and steelhead species will head
upstream, too. About half the adult chinook expected to spawn this
year died. The Yurok tribe has lived off salmon for centuries, but
has been able to run commercial fishing operations only five of the
last 15 years.</TE>
<TE>   The federal government should maintain adequate flows. And
everyone should hope for a nice wet winter.</TE>

<LD>Let us celebrate the silver lining in the painfully serious West
Coast waterfront shipping lockout--fewer giant big rigs on the
freeways. Sure, scores of ships squat idly outside nearly 30 ports
waiting to unload countless tons of cargo. Yes, we're told the
shipping dispute has cost the nation $1 billion a day in unloaded
baseball caps and running shoes and unshipped lettuce. So forego
running to eat salad awhile. Those estimates come from economists,
confident that no one else is counting. So, let's lock those
economists out of their nerdy little offices. Have them sit behind a
smoking truck hauling a rusty container and read the "Caution Wide
Turn" signs over and over.</LD>
<LD>   Some estimates (there they go again) say about 34,000 truck trips
have not been made daily in south Los Angeles County because of the
lockout. If we could prolong the work stoppage until 2020, that would
be, what, 92,000 estimated truck trips not made daily? Imagine the
congestion and smoke avoided.</LD>
<LD>   While we're at it, let's spread the work stoppage benefits to
northern Los Angeles County. Every other resident there seems to
change addresses each month. Moving-company truck drivers and Ryder
rental clerks could go on strike to help out, plus the drivers of
UPS, the Postal Service and FedEx, those sheriff's buses and all the
open landscapers' trucks that drive around while their loads of trees
grow up.</LD>
<TE>   Drivers of SUVs pulling boats ought to be locked out; there's
plenty of parking space offshore among the idled ships. While we're
at it, let's have an enduring strike by motorcyclists who dart
between stopped cars and the folks who make those precious license
plate holders proclaiming what their drivers would rather be
doing--hiking, cycling, skydiving. We'd rather they be doing that
too. So go do it.</TE>
<TE>   Let the New York Yankees be angels and strike to protest actually
having to play games to reach the World Series. Judging by the number
of checkout aisles never open in crowded groceries, discount stores
and banks, their checkers and tellers are already on strike. We also
could use a chat stoppage by people who insist on having private cell
phone conversations in public; we don't care what their doctor said.</TE>
<TE>   Speaking of chat, chipper morning show hosts and really jolly
weather forecasters need a lockout, as do moviegoers who can wait in
the concession line 14 interminable minutes but still need to ponder
their choices at the counter. While waiting in this line, we're
wondering why popcorn and a drink that's much more ice than drink now
cost more than the movie ticket itself.</TE>

Dead," Oct. 2). But there's plenty of money for terrorizing cancer
patients by assaulting our medicinal marijuana dispensaries and for
pouring into the rat-hole of Colombia and its endless civil war.</LD>

<DL>MADISON, Wis.</DL>
<LD>Photos of my children are scattered through my house--in drawers and
closets, on tabletops--like leaves in autumn. I don't know if it's
disorganization or the fact that I like being surprised by stray
images: one son wobbling his way through a first soccer game, the
other bonelessly asleep on my husband's shoulder.</LD>
<LD>   I found myself thinking about these sunlit accounts of family life
after seeing the video clip of 4-year-old Martha Toogood and her
mother. The Toogood tape comes courtesy of a security camera scanning
the parking lot of a Kohl's department store in Mishawaka, Ind. On
Sept. 13, it recorded the mother beating the child. What you begin to
realize, watching the tape, is how endless 30 seconds can seem.</LD>
<LD>   The little girl is strapped into a safety seat in the car. Or in
this case, trapped. The mother looks around, leans in, and then her
arm draws back for the first blow. And then the next. Local
television stations aired the tape at police request to help find the
family. It worked. But even in its flickering graininess, the tape
had enough drama to draw national media attention.</LD>
<TE>   Oh, the mother has tried to explain it away. She was having a bad
day; she'd been rebuffed on a refund request at the store; she was
"mortified" seeing herself on tape. She's had plenty of opportunities
to justify herself on the media circuit, assuring Larry King, for
one, that she was "not a monster."</TE>
<TE>   We don't know the little girl's opinion because--rightfully--the
child has been hustled into foster care. The system lets the
videotape speak for her, and it's eloquent enough. It will do its
work as evidence in the child abuse case now brought against
25-year-old Madelyne Toogood.</TE>
<TE>   And then it will be filed away until it disappears into the back
rooms of the court system, a dusty tape from a forgotten crisis. The
real record, though, has nothing to do with technology. The most
enduring, the most potent memory won't be in the tape at all. It will
be in the child.</TE>
<TE>   It's a kind of gospel of neuroscience that our brains do their
best job of preserving a memory when emotion helps burn it in. We
need photographic records of the easy moments because they slip away.
Our neurons, those busy nerve cells in our brains, are careless with
contentment. They don't pay close attention. It's the jolt of shock
or grief or fear that etches a memory deepest. So that most of us
recall with precision where we stood when we first heard of those
hijacked planes on Sept. 11. So that I still remember, as if
listening to a digital recording, the slow, weighted sound of my
father's voice on the day 10 years ago that he called to tell me that
my nephew was dead.</TE>
<TE>   When it comes to other people's crises, then, the rest of us need
the videotape. Obviously, Martha Toogood doesn't. What she needs is
protection against more of the same. Scientists warn against the
risks of accumulating too many such moments into a pattern.
Psychological research shows that a parent who routinely threatens or
frightens or hurts has real power to shape the way those young brains
develop.</TE>
<TE>   To understand just how powerful this effect is--like national
tragedy, like death in the family--you have to recognize just how
important a parent is to a small child. Actually, we ought to have
that one down by now. The most compelling experiments ever,
illuminating the inescapable bond between an abusive mother and a
child who needs her, were done in the 1960s. Let's not fool
ourselves: We've known for decades what a dangerous parent means to a
small child.</TE>
<TE>   The studies I'm thinking of were done by the late Harry Harlow, a
University of Wisconsin psychologist who used baby monkeys as his
model for small children. In this particular set of experiments, he
wanted to know what happens to a child whose mother rejects her. He
wanted to be very precise about the nature of rejection. So he and
his colleagues built a series of "evil" robot mothers. They had soft
padded bodies and blandly smiling faces. But they were evil, all
right. One shook infants until their teeth rattled. One was
spring-loaded to hurl the baby animals away. The most infamous came
equipped with brass knobs that would ram into a baby as it cuddled
in.</TE>
<TE>   Harlow and his colleagues expected that they would end up with
neurotic babies. And they did. But, unexpectedly, they also produced
devoted ones. No matter what the mothers did, the babies always came
back. A baby monkey would pick itself up, wait until the knobs
retracted, and once again wrap itself around the mother. It would
cling hopefully to the shaking mother, trying to stay on. The infants
seemed tireless in their willingness to try again to persuade their
mothers to, well, be mothers--be loving, be safe.</TE>
<TE>   Those studies represent only a fraction of Harlow's sometimes
lovely, sometimes explicitly painful research into parent-child
relationships. He believed that his other work, demonstrating the
importance of a loving touch, mattered more in everyday life. No one
grows up whole and healthy, he insisted, without "a solid foundation
of affection." But he was emphatic about the value of the darker
studies. Not every child gets that foundation; some get the opposite,
obviously. And yet all children need loving adult support. If you're
going to study love, Harlow insisted, you have to study all its
aspects.</TE>
<TE>   There can be an almost gut level response today, after years of
consciousness-raising about animals, to the plight of those baby
monkeys. But when Harlow did this work, there was no aggressive
animal rights community to criticize it. There was no 21st century
sense of ethics in animal laboratories. At the time, the real shock
value in the evil mother study was what it said about the strength of
the parent-child bond and the sometimes terrible power in that
relationship.</TE>
<TE>   We forget that until the mid-20th century, psychology was
dominated by experts who insisted that affection wasn't important in
parenting. They even argued that too loving a parent would damage a
son or diminish a daughter. "There are serious rocks ahead for the
overkissed child," wrote 1920s child-care guru John Watson. It took
years, it took decades and it took Harry Harlow's undeniable,
in-your-face studies of the impact of loveless parenting to change
that.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps we would be smarter about parenting now if science had
gotten the point earlier. Still, since the Harlow days, psychology
has leaped forward in illuminating our need for that foundation of
affection, and nurturing, and security. No psychologist argues that
parents need to be perfect, that we permanently damage a child
through the occasional gust of impatience or anger. But the emphasis
there is on occasional. Consider once again the accidental gotcha of
that parking lot security tape. Does anyone believe that this was the
one, the only time that Martha Toogood's mother took out her
frustrations on her child?</TE>
<TE>   Researchers such as Robert Sapolsky, at Stanford University, have
shown that a young brain does its desperate best to cope with an
environment of fear and threat. It restructures. It notches up the
stress response. It keeps the body poised for flight. It floods the
nervous system with angst. When the child grows up, the adult brain
is beautifully designed to hover right on the edge of panic. Although
there's a certain hyper-alertness in that, Sapolsky and his
colleagues see no advantage. They see cost. Stress-related hormones
and neurotransmitters put real wear and tear on the system and have
been linked to destruction of brain cells and to memory loss.</TE>
<TE>   And abuse wears away at the potential of the child in other ways.
Psychologists once thought that all people had an innate ability to
read facial expressions, were born knowing how to register a friendly
smile and an angry frown. Now studies contradict that. Experiments
instead show that abused children can be face-blind. Consistently,
these boys and girls will read anger into a smile, see real threat in
even the mild irritation of a raised eyebrow. Their brains show a
sudden furious leap of response, one that doesn't register in
children from more supportive homes.</TE>
<TE>   It's the photograph problem again. As if that videotape, that
moment when the mother's arm swings back in anger, could play itself
in an endless loop, override a friendly gesture or a casual one. The
brains of these children can become structured for that override. And
although research, from Harry Harlow on, suggests that other, better
relationships can help correct such reactions, ask yourself whether
that jittery, stress-prone reaction helps the Martha Toogoods of the
world make friends?</TE>
<TE>   So "I had a bad day" doesn't make it as an excuse, not for Martha
Toogood's mother, not for any of us. Let's go ahead and file the
videotape away. And, yes, let's give that child a break from home. I
hope she has a chance for some silly, happy moments, gets to pile up
some of those bright, casual photographs. Memories count. Let's not
forget that.</TE>

<HD>Why Bratton Has Edge Over His Predecessors</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOE DOMANICK</AU>
<BD>Joe Domanick, author of "To Protect and to Serve: The
LAPD's Century of War in the City of Dreams," is the senior fellow at
USC's Annenberg School Institute for Justice and Journalism.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Even before Mayor James K. Hahn picked former New York Police
Commissioner William J. Bratton as L.A.'s next police chief, the
political climate surrounding the selection process indicated that
the chances for genuine reform of the Los Angeles Police Department
are better now than at any time since 1950. That year, the creator of
the modern LAPD, William H. Parker, was sworn in as chief. He then
began transforming a lax, brutal, corrupt and politically manipulated
police force into a highly efficient crime-fighting machine that
became the model for police departments throughout the Southwest.</LD>
<LD>   Hahn's decision not to rehire Chief Bernard C. Parks ignited a
bitter and racially tinged political battle, costing the mayor
support in the city's African American community. Unlike previous
LAPD controversies, however, the acrimony quickly dissipated, and the
special-interest politics that marked the selection of a new chief
over the last decade retreated into the background.</LD>
<TE>   One big reason for the relative depoliticization of the selection
process was sheer public exhaustion. Since four LAPD officers beat up
Rodney King in 1991, the department has been mired in controversy,
from the Christopher Commission's condemnation of widespread officer
misconduct to the questionable police tactics of the 1992 riots, from
Daryl Gates' ouster as chief to the selection of Philadelphian Willie
Williams as its first black leader. Along the way, city voters passed
a series of charter amendments to reform the LAPD, but 10 years after
the King beating, outsider Williams and insider Parks, plagued by the
Rampart scandal, had failed to reform the department.</TE>
<TE>   But the racial tensions that had marred the selections and tenures
of L.A. police chiefs in the 1990s gave way to a consensus: The time
for symbolism was past. Race was no substitute for reform.</TE>
<TE>   The low profile of the Police Protective League also helped to
mute the politics of the selection process. The league didn't even
endorse a candidate. But union leaders may have concluded that there
was little to be gained from pressuring Hahn. After all, the mayor
had already repaid the debt he owed the league for its support of his
candidacy by successfully pushing for a work plan that allowed
officers to toil longer hours in exchange for more days off. Hahn's
decision not to rehire the disciplinarian Parks was also good news
for the police union. In any case, it would have been a huge
political miscalculation for Hahn to again be seen as doing the
league a favor.</TE>
<TE>   If the police union didn't get what it wanted--a current or former
LAPD insider--it also didn't get what it least wanted: John Timoney.
While head of the Philadelphia Police Department, Timoney had taken
no nonsense from its union, which was accustomed to throwing its
weight around and getting what it wanted. The Philadelphia Fraternal
Order of Police may have gotten a measure of revenge when it told
league officials that Timoney was bad news. "It was strictly a labor
issue," said a source close to the league.</TE>
<TE>   Members of the LAPD command staff didn't play politics, either,
though many were said to be seething over the Police Commission's
decision not to include at least one of their number in the final
list of candidates, a move they correctly interpreted as a slap in
the face. "It's like a morgue up there on the sixth floor," a Parker
Center veteran said of the department's administrative nerve center.
"People are angry, insulted and unhappy" at being excluded, said
another.</TE>
<TE>   But the most important reason for the politically muted selection
process was the manner in which the Police Commission went about its
business of drawing up a candidate list for the mayor. At first, its
members appeared to be inexperienced dilettantes without the will,
stature or knowledge to handle the job of overseeing LAPD reform. Now
they appear to be heavy hitters. After the Parks controversy died
down, the commission settled in and conducted a professional search
for a new chief. This in itself was a departure from the previous
selection process. In 1997, everyone knew that Parks was Mayor
Richard Riordan's choice to replace Williams, and the commission
essentially rubber-stamped his wish.</TE>
<TE>   This time, commissioners had other things on their minds, like the
slow pace of departmental reform, flagging officer morale and
mounting attrition, and a federal consent decree hanging over the
LAPD's head. Hahn also had made clear that the Police Department's
survival as a credible and effective law-enforcement institution
depended on aggressively reforming it. To its credit, the
commission's three finalists--Bratton, Timoney and Art Lopez--tested
Hahn's seriousness.</TE>
<TE>   By including Lopez as a finalist, the Police Commission had left
the mayor with an exit strategy. Lopez spent 27 years in the LAPD
before becoming Oxnard's chief and was the choice of many Latino
leaders to replace Parks. Furthermore, naming Lopez would have set up
Latino support for Hahn's reelection bid in 2005, not an
insignificant consideration since the mayor can no longer rely on the
loyalty of black voters. Finally, the Police Protective League would
have received yet another Hahn gift, this time a man not known for a
punishing hand.</TE>
<TE>   By choosing Bratton, however, Hahn has demonstrated that he is his
own man when it comes to reforming the LAPD. It will be ironic indeed
if Hahn, by picking Bratton, turns out to be the man who finally
transforms the LAPD. As city attorney during the 1990s, Hahn's office
defended LAPD officers in hundreds of police-abuse lawsuits whose
settlements cost the city more than $100 million. Throughout, Hahn
uttered nary a word about police reform. Only when the Justice
Department threatened to sue the city for its police department's
"pattern or practice" of abuse did Hahn get involved in the reform
process.</TE>
<TE>   Bratton, to be sure, faces many challenges in reforming the LAPD.
But because the selection process used to choose him was politically
defused, he has a leg up on his predecessors in modernizing the LAPD
that Parker created.</TE>

<HD>The Power Paradox</HD>
<DH>History teaches that holding a monopoly on might--as the
United States now does--is likely to provoke a backlash.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRISTOPHER LAYNE</AU>
<BD>Christopher Layne is visiting fellow in foreign policy
studies at the Cato Institute in Washington.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Conventional wisdom holds that Sept. 11 "changed everything,"
particularly with regard to foreign policy. But long before the Al
Qaeda attacks, the key foreign policy debate centered on the issue of
U.S. hegemony, our geopolitical dominance by virtue of overwhelming
military and economic capabilities. Since Sept. 11, hegemony has
become an even more crucial issue.</LD>
<LD>   By removing the only counterweight to U.S. power from the
geostrategic equation, the Soviet Union's collapse vaulted the United
States into the seemingly enviable position of global preeminence.
Since the Cold War's end, three successive administrations--Bush I,
Clinton, and Bush II--have explicitly embraced the strategic
objective of maintaining this hegemony. But it's a dangerous
business.</LD>
<TE>   Hegemonic powers are like monopolistic corporations.
Monopolists--and hegemons--don't like competition, and they act
strategically to prevent the emergence of rivals. The new National
Security Strategy of the United States that President Bush presented
to Congress last month is clear on this point, stating that the
objective of American strategy is to prevent any other state from
building up military capabilities in the hope of "surpassing, or even
equaling, the power of the United States." American strategy aims not
only to thwart the emergence of the "usual suspects" (a rising China
or a resurgent Russia), but also the rise to great power status of
America's principal Cold War allies (Western Europe and Japan). To
ensure that the U.S. remains "king of the hill, top of the heap"
geopolitically, the Bush National Security Strategy constitutes the
U.S. as a kind of global "Department of Pre-Crime" empowered to act
preemptively to cut down future rivals before they become actual
ones.</TE>
<TE>   So, why is this a problem? If power matters in international
politics--and it matters a lot--why should the United States not seek
to amass overwhelming power? Can a country ever, to paraphrase the
duchess of Windsor, be too rich, too powerful or too well-armed?</TE>
<TE>   Some armchair strategists residing in leading universities and
think tanks--the so-called "offensive realists"--argue that hegemony
is important for maintaining world order, that international systems
dominated by a hegemonic power are more stable and peaceful than
systems where power is more or less equally distributed among
multiple great powers. They believe that the U.S. will attain the
greatest security in a world where there are no other great powers.
Needless to say, offensive realism has found a receptive audience
among the current crop of U.S. policymakers.</TE>
<TE>   There is a problem with this picture, however. The historical
record shows that in the real world, hegemony never has been a
winning grand strategy. The reason is simple: The primary aim of
states in international politics is to survive and maintain their
sovereignty. And when one state becomes too powerful--becomes a
hegemon--the imbalance of power in its favor is a menace to the
security of all other states. So throughout modern international
political history, the rise of a would-be hegemon always has
triggered the formation of counter-hegemonic alliances by other
states.</TE>
<TE>   History is littered with the wreckage of states that sought
hegemony, and were defeated by such alliances--the Hapsburg Empire
under Charles V and Philip II, France under Louis XIV and Napoleon,
Victorian Britain, Germany under Hitler. The big question is whether
the same fate will befall a hegemonic America, or whether the United
States somehow is exempt from the lessons of history.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. strategists believe that "it can't happen to us," because the
United States is a different kind of hegemon, a benign hegemon that
others will follow willingly due to the attractiveness of its
political values and culture. While flattering, this self-serving
argument misses the basic point: Hegemons are threatening because
they have too much power. And it is America's power--not the
self-proclaimed benevolence of its intentions--that will shape
others' response to it. A state's power is a hard, measurable
reality, but its intentions, which can be peaceful one day but
malevolent the next, are ephemeral.</TE>
<TE>   Hegemony's proponents claim that the United States can inoculate
itself against a backlash by acting multilaterally. But other states
are not going to be deceived by Washington's use of international
institutions as a fig leaf to cloak its ambitions of dominance. And
in any event, there are good reasons why the U.S. should not
reflexively embrace multilateralism. When it comes to deciding when
and how to defend American interests, Washington should want a free
hand, not to have its hands tied by others.</TE>
<TE>   Today, the United States stands at the zenith of its power. But
there is a real paradox to American hegemony. On the plus side,
Washington has the military muscle, economic power and diplomatic
clout to assemble an impressive coalition against terrorism. And,
although there is evident unease about the administration's Iraq
policy, Washington has plenty of carrots--and sticks--to induce
support from states such as France, Russia and U.S. client regimes in
the Middle East that harbor deep misgivings about the wisdom of
Washington's use of military power to bring about regime change in
Baghdad. The United States is too powerful, and others too weak, for
its actions to be opposed or constrained successfully.</TE>
<TE>   But things often change quickly in international politics, and
America's displays of power today could well come back to haunt
Washington tomorrow. The lessons of the past tell us that the very
fact of America's overwhelming power is bound to produce a
geopolitical backlash. Even during the 1990s, other leading
powers--Russia, China, France, India--repeatedly called attention to
the dangers of American "hyperpower" and called for the creation of
counterweights to U.S. hegemony. The debate about Iraq has galvanized
others' fears that a too-powerful U.S. will act in ways detrimental
to their interests. The nasty tiff between the administration and
German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, and the clear reluctance of
France and Russia to support a U.S. military campaign aimed at
overthrowing Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, illustrate the worries
even our allies have about American hegemony.</TE>
<TE>   American strategists may think that U.S. hegemony is consolidated
firmly and is beyond challenge. But this surely is strategic myopia.
It is a pretty safe bet that in the first few decades of the 21st
century, U.S. primacy will prompt the same response that previous
hegemonic aspirants provoked: New great powers will emerge to offset
U.S. power, and they will coalesce to check America's ambitions.</TE>
<TE>   Terrorist attacks like Sept. 11 are also, in themselves, a form of
blowback against American geopolitical preeminence. Despicable and
brutal though they were, Al Qaeda's actions were coolly calculated to
achieve well-defined geopolitical objectives: the removal of the U.S.
military presence from the Persian Gulf (and in particular from Saudi
Arabia) and an alteration of the U.S. stance in the
Israeli-Palestinian conflict. In other words, Al Qaeda's goal was to
undermine U.S. hegemony.</TE>
<TE>   And at the end of the day, hegemons are defeated not just by the
counter-hegemonic behavior of other states and organizations, but by
mounting internal weaknesses--economic, political, and social--caused
by the burdens of hegemony, which are a consequence of their own
geopolitical and ideological ambitions. That is, hegemons fall victim
to what the historian Paul Kennedy famously called "imperial
overstretch."</TE>
<TE>   Events since Sept. 11 have underlined America's dominant role in
the international system, and talk of a "new American empire" echoes
inside the Beltway. Flushed with triumph and the awesome display of
American might, U.S. policymakers have succumbed to hubris in the
false belief that American hegemony is an unchallengeable fact of
international life. They believe the U.S. can use its muscle to bring
about regime changes and compel others to embrace American-style
democracy and free markets. They believe America can impose its will
on the world and stabilize endemically turbulent regions like the
Persian Gulf and Central Asia.</TE>
<TE>   It is only a short step, however, from the celebration of imperial
glory to the recessional of imperial power. The United States must be
careful not to overreach and fall victim to the "hegemon's
temptation" by overextending itself strategically. Today, it is
imperative that we look beyond the immediate exigencies of the war on
terrorism, and Iraq, and consider the broader geopolitical context of
American grand strategy. U.S. policymakers are deceiving themselves
if they ignore the likely boomerang consequences of U.S. hegemony.
That is why now, more than ever, it is imperative to have a great
debate about America's future grand strategy.</TE>

science and Hoover Fellow at Stanford University, and a senior

<DL>STANFORD</DL>
<LD>In asking the United Nations to discipline Iraq for its defiance of
the world body's disarmament resolutions, President Bush sought to
demonstrate that he is not an unbridled unilateralist, as his critics
claim, but a believer in international institutions. It was an
important first step toward renewing U.S. membership in the
international community. But before the United States can follow
through on its commitment, the United Nations must reform itself.
Ironically, an administration generally dismissive of international
treaties and agreements may be the catalyst the U.N. needs to regain
its relevance and credibility in world affairs.</LD>
<LD>   Many critics of the Bush administration erroneously assume that
its unilateralist impulses upset a finely tuned, efficient United
Nations. Their misconception of the world body is partly to blame.
They wrongly compare the U.N. General Assembly to the U.S. House of
Representatives and the Security Council to the U.S. Senate.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan is the world's chief executive, in their
view. This notion of how the international community works imperils
the continued existence of the U.N. as a meaningful organization.</LD>
<TE>   The United Nations and its Security Council have never been the
ultimate authority in deciding issues of war and peace. During the
Cold War, the Security Council was so deeply divided that it rarely
voted on anything meaningful. After the Cold War, the U.N.'s role
expanded but its effect on world affairs remained limited. For
example, the Clinton administration did not seek U.N. approval of the
NATO-led war against Serbia. Nor did the United States and Great
Britain seek U.N. approval for their last major bombing campaign
against Iraq, in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   Not only has it been absent on a multitude of international issues
involving war, genocide and the spread of weapons of mass
destruction, the United Nations has also failed to enforce its own
resolutions. As Bush rightly pointed out in his speech to the U.N.
General Assembly last month, the most glaring evidence of this is the
16 resolutions on Iraq that Saddam Hussein has defied for years.
Unfortunately, the list of unenforced U.N. resolutions numbers far
more than 16.</TE>
<TE>   This charade has to stop. Governments that claim authority to rule
but lack the means to do so eventually fall. Communities that cannot
enforce their norms fall apart. The same will happen to the United
Nations unless it changes.</TE>
<TE>   Key to that change is abandoning the distorting metaphor of the
U.N. as a world government. International treaties are not domestic
law writ globally. In the United States, only a majority is needed to
turn a bill into law. Minorities, even large minorities, opposed to
the bill cannot block it from becoming law. Once in place, laws are
enforced by third parties, not by their drafters.</TE>
<TE>   Treaties are not born this way. Every party to a treaty must
decide individually whether or not to sign it. Just because 150
countries sign a treaty, that doesn't give it the force of law over
the 151st country that refuses to sign, especially if that country is
the most powerful in the world. In addition, no third party can
enforce treaties, because there is, in fact, no world government.
Kofi Annan does not control a police force, an Internal Revenue
Service or an army. Rather, signatories to a treaty must also serve
as its enforcers.</TE>
<TE>   Accordingly, a more appropriate metaphor for an international
treaty is a contract, specifically, a self-enforcing contract.
Countries sign treaties because they have calculated it is in their
national interests to do so. Like contracts, good treaties offer
win-win solutions for all sides. If they make everyone better off,
treaties will be self-enforcing because every party to one will, out
of self-interest, want to preserve it.</TE>
<TE>   If treaties are construed as contracts among states rather than as
laws above them, all signatories will be obligated to give something
in order to get something. The U.N. Charter is one such treaty. As a
signatory to the charter, the United States should not expect to
secure U.N. endorsement for military action against Iraq without
giving something in return. That could be a more narrowly defined
military mission than Washington would prefer, or a strong U.N.
presence in a post-Hussein government.</TE>
<TE>   But in asking for more control over U.S. actions, U.N. members
should be careful not to ask for too much, lest they risk a break in
relations with the United States. U.N. resolutions, especially on
matters of war and peace, mean little without U.S. participation. The
United States is the only country in the world with the power to
enforce the U.N. resolutions on Iraq. As in the business world,
stronger, bigger and richer countries have more leverage in
negotiations than weaker, smaller and poorer ones. All members of the
United Nations are not equal members of the international community.</TE>
<TE>   To be successful partners, the United States and the rest of the
international community must soberly recognize the asymmetry of power
between them, and also realize that everyone can gain from
cooperation, even if the gains are not distributed equally. After
all, the costs of enforcement are not equally distributed. If the
United States bears the burden of making U.N. resolutions relevant,
other U.N. members should allow Washington to have a disproportionate
say in the drafting of the resolutions.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration and the United Nations are at an important
crossroads. If the Bush team and other members of the U.N. Security
Council fail to sign a new "contract" on Iraq, both parties will walk
away the weaker. But the U.N. will be the bigger loser, since the
United States has a far greater capacity to pursue its objectives
alone than the U.N. does without the United States.</TE>
<TE>   If, on the other hand, the U.S. and the U.N. can agree on a new
Iraq contract, the U.S. campaign against Iraq would have greater
legitimacy. U.N. cooperation would also ensure global participation
in the rebuilding of Iraq. Out of such cooperation might emerge a
more effective and relevant United Nations and a more internationally
engaged United States. And one of the most heinous regimes in the
world might also fall.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Last Monday, the state released the latest round of scores on
California's High School Exit Exam. More than half of the 431,000
10th-graders who took the exam last spring failed it--most for the
second time. They will have more chances to pass, but unless
something extraordinary happens, they can forget about a high school
diploma. They can also forget about attending any of California's
public universities, even if they've had all the right classes,
gotten good grades and taken the SAT.</LD>
<LD>   The exit exam is a blunt instrument, useful for exposing the
California schools in greatest need of attention and resources. But
it should not be used to bludgeon students whose misfortune it is to
attend those schools.</LD>
<LD>   Consider the prospects of 11th-graders at L.A.'s Crenshaw High
School. After one month of school, many have not yet received
textbooks for their classes. More than a third of their teachers lack
full credentials. This is not an exceptional year for these students,
who have faced similar or worse conditions year after year. Now,
though, the state has come along and threatened their futures with a
test that their school has not prepared them to take.</LD>
<TE>   This is the same test that students at Palos Verdes Peninsula and
Beverly Hills high schools take--students who, throughout their
school careers, have been taught by fully credentialed teachers who
are conversant with the curriculum standards on which the exam is
based. They have had access to high-quality textbooks and they have
learned in well-equipped classrooms that optimize instructional time.
Should we be surprised that only 20% of Crenshaw's class of 2004 has
passed the math portion of the test and 47% the language arts,
compared with 95% of Beverly Hills High students in math and 100% in
language arts?</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately, Crenshaw's 11th-graders are not unique. Many others
are far worse off, particularly students of color, many of whom are
clustered in the state's worst schools.</TE>
<TE>   Statewide, 72% of the African Americans and 70% of the Latinos who
took the exam last spring failed it. Of the 25 lowest-performing high
schools in the state, eight are in the LAUSD. These facts reveal not
the failure of children, but the failure of adults. Denying students
diplomas because we have withheld what they need to achieve simply
blames them for our state's failure to provide a decent basic
education.</TE>
<TE>   Consider the following:</TE>
<TE>   * At high schools where math pass rates fall in the bottom 10% in
the state, 24% of the teachers, on average, are without full
certification. In contrast, only 8% of teachers lack credentials at
schools where pass rates fall in the top 25%.</TE>
<TE>   * Statewide, minority students are five times more likely than
other students to have under-qualified teachers.</TE>
<TE>   * Schools with teacher shortages also have the worst shortages of
textbooks and instructional materials like calculators, measuring
tools and graph paper for math classes. A recent Louis Harris poll
found that 42% of teachers in schools with the largest concentrations
of low-income children don't have enough books for their students to
take home, and 21% use books that don't cover the state standards.</TE>
<TE>   * One in three California students attends an overcrowded school
or one in need of significant modernization, according to the state's
legislative analyst. Some 70,000 high schoolers are in buildings so
overcrowded that their schools must squeeze them into a multitrack,
year-round schedule. Students lose 17 days of instruction each year
as a result. To make up the time, their school day has been
lengthened--an ineffective strategy, according to many teachers.
Nearly all of these students are low-income Latinos; most are in Los
Angeles. The average exit exam passing rate in math at these
multitrack, year-round schools is 31%, while the rate of students on
normal schedules is 58%.</TE>
<TE>   Education leaders across the state have voiced concern this week
about the failure rates. Some argue that the state should either back
off its timeline or lower the bar for passing. Others argue for
"staying the course" in order to maintain high standards and
accountability. Such responses only foster cynicism and alienation.
The problems revealed by California's high school exit exam won't go
away by adjusting cutoff scores in order to make the failure rate
less shocking. Nor is postponing the consequences a solution. These
problems can be solved only by providing all students a real
opportunity to learn what's on the test. That requires extraordinary
action.</TE>
<TE>   In January 2000, Illinois Gov. George Ryan called for a moratorium
on his state's use of the death penalty. Ryan, a supporter of capital
punishment, decided that no one should suffer the severest of all
penalties until the system could guarantee that innocent people were
not being put to death. This moratorium opened public debate with a
sense of urgency. He established a prestigious commission and set it
up to operate outside the partisan world of state politics. The
commission made a comprehensive investigation of the system and
recommended ways to improve it. The people of Illinois were then
presented with a series of proposals for ensuring accuracy and
fairness.</TE>
<TE>   This is exactly the course that California must take with its high
school exit exam. The loss of life opportunities that stem from a
poor education is certainly not on a par with the loss of life
itself. But neither loss is acceptable. California needs a moratorium
on the diploma penalty, and it needs a rigorous, independent and
high-powered commission appointed by the Legislature to press the
state to take the extraordinary actions needed to guarantee
educational quality and fairness for all its students.</TE>
<TE>   The commission's work should begin with some basic questions. Do
certified staff have appropriate degrees and credentials to teach
core academic subjects? Are school staff teaching to the standards?
Has standards-based instruction been implemented in the grades
leading up to the test? Do teachers have the resources they need to
teach? Do students have the things they need in order to learn?</TE>
<TE>   They won't be starting from scratch: The Legislature's Joint
Committee to Develop a Master Plan for Education has already, with
input from hundreds of educators and others around the state, laid
out the problems and ways of attacking them. Now we need action.</TE>
<TE>   This year, the Legislature overwhelmingly approved SB 1408, a bill
that would require schools with high failure rates on the exit exam
to determine the reasons and develop specific plans to address
problems. But Gov. Gray Davis vetoed the bill, saying that California
already has all the information it needs and that implementing the
bill would cost too much money. Weighed against the personal, social
and economic costs of failing hundreds of thousands of young people,
fixing the state's schools could be the best bargain California has
ever found.</TE>

<KH>SADDAM HUSSEIN</KH>
<HD>Don't Just Fight Him; Indict Him</HD>
<DH>As with Yugoslavia and Nazi Germany, make the case against
Iraq's dictator in court.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL P. SCHARF</AU>
<BD>Michael P. Scharf, former attorney-advisor for United
Nations affairs at the U.S. State Department, is professor of
international law and director of the War Crimes Research Office at
Case Western Reserve University School of Law.</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Assuming that regime change in Iraq is inevitable, the question of
what to do with Saddam Hussein and the surviving members of his
governing clique becomes more pressing. Since Hussein has so often
been compared to Adolf Hitler, it makes good sense to turn to the
historic analogy of World War II for some guidance.</LD>
<LD>   As the Allies pushed into Nazi Germany in spring 1945, there was
considerable debate about what to do with the Nazi leaders after
Germany's defeat. British Prime Minister Winston Churchill suggested
a firing squad. Soviet Premier Josef Stalin agreed, adding that his
advisors had already come up with a list of 50,000 German candidates
for execution. The United States instead proposed an international
trial, which ultimately led to the establishment of the Nuremberg
Tribunal.</LD>
<LD>   Although the Nuremberg proceedings served many purposes, a main
one was to justify Allied conduct during and after the war by putting
an international spotlight on German atrocities. Once the world
learned of Nazi war crimes and genocide, it would accept the
controversial Allied firebombing of Dresden, as well as Allied plans
for occupation and de-Nazification of Germany.</LD>
<TE>   Fifty-four years later, the international indictment of former
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic proved similarly useful to the
United States and its allies. The International Criminal Tribunal for
the Former Yugoslavia indicted him for crimes against humanity in
March 1999, roughly two months into NATO's bombing campaign against
Serbia. The timing of the indictment was crucial. Popular support for
NATO's intervention in the Balkans was waning in several NATO
countries in the face of intense press criticism of its use of
cluster bombs and depleted-uranium munitions, attacks on civilian
trains and media centers, and the accidental bombings of the Chinese
Embassy in Belgrade and territory in neighboring Bulgaria. The
Milosevic indictment gave the North Atlantic Treaty Organization the
moral credibility it needed to sustain international support for its
military intervention. It also induced Milosevic to accede to NATO
demands.</TE>
<TE>   A judicial confirmation of the case against Hussein would
similarly build international support for action against Iraq, both
before and after military action.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. investigators are said to have collected bountiful evidence
of the atrocities committed by the Iraqi regime over the last 20
years. These include the taking of foreign nationals as hostages;
using foreign nationals as human shields; raping and killing foreign
civilians; torturing prisoners of war; pillaging civilian hospitals;
launching Scud missiles at civilian targets in neighboring countries;
releasing oil into the Persian Gulf; sabotaging oil fields in Kuwait;
deploying chemical weapons; and committing genocide-like crimes
against the Kurd and Shiite populations in Iraq. But this evidence
has not been entered into the public record through a fair trial that
can, in the words of Nuremberg lead prosecutor Robert H. Jackson,
"establish incredible events by credible evidence."</TE>
<TE>   In the aftermath of the attacks on the World Trade Center and
Pentagon, the chief prosecutor of the Yugoslavia tribunal, Carla Del
Ponte, proposed expanding the jurisdiction of the U.N. Security
Council-created tribunal to include prosecution of Taliban and Al
Qaeda leaders taken into custody. Although the Bush administration
prefers military tribunals instead, Del Ponte's proposal could be
easily implemented for Hussein and company.</TE>
<TE>   All that would be necessary to accomplish this is for the U.N.
Security Council to pass a resolution expanding the Yugoslavia
tribunal's jurisdiction to include violations of international
humanitarian law committed by Iraq during its war with Iran in the
1980s, Baghdad's invasion and occupation of Kuwait in 1990, its role
in the Persian Gulf War in 1991 and its subsequent, brutal repression
of the Kurd and Shiite rebellions in Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   The trials could take place down the road from The Hague at the
super-secure courtroom and detention center at Camp Zeist, where the
Pan Am Flight 103 bombers were tried two years ago. While the
international tribunal already has enough judges to staff this new
undertaking, the United States and allies could supply prosecutors to
prepare indictments quickly.</TE>
<TE>   The one obstacle to such a tribunal is the approval of the five
permanent members of the U.N. Security Council. The British, strong
supporters of the permanent international criminal court established
last summer, might view expansion of the Yugoslavia tribunal as a
U.S. effort to undermine the permanent court. But this objection
would be invalid, because the permanent international criminal court
is prohibited by statute from exercising jurisdiction over crimes
committed before July 1, 2002.</TE>
<TE>   The Russians and French, who have a huge financial stake in Iraqi
oil, may initially oppose an expanded Yugoslav tribunal because it
might imperil the current U.N. effort to induce Hussein to accept new
inspections. But in light of Hussein's history of frustrating U.N.
inspection teams, who can seriously believe that he will fully
cooperate this time? When he does block the inspectors, the U.S. must
be ready with the trial proposal.</TE>
<TE>   It is one thing for President Bush and Prime Minister Tony Blair
to assert that Hussein is evil and to expect the rest of the world to
believe unsupported claims about the threat he poses. It would be
quite another if, on the eve of military action against Iraq, a panel
of distinguished international jurists were to conclude that the
evidence of the Iraqi leader's war crimes and crimes against humanity
is sufficient to confirm an indictment and issue an international
arrest warrant. Thereafter, as was the case with Milosevic, every
reference to Hussein would be followed by the moniker "indicted war
criminal."</TE>

<HD>Imminent Threat to Our Security</HD>
<DH>No, it's not Iraq. It's the economy. And we're not stupid.</DH>

<AU>JOHN BALZAR</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I was stopped cold the other day when reading about threats to
homeland security. A writer with better credentials than mine
suggested that Herbert Hoover was more of an economic activist than
George W. Bush. No need to debate the point. Merely that you could
debate it should be enough to scare us good.</LD>
<LD>   Hoover, let's recall, was the original "trickle down,"
business-knows-best president. With the economy in trouble and the
stock market over-inflated back in 1929, he resolutely voiced
confidence in the status quo, offering assistance to industry and
counting on wealth to trickle down to working people. The result was
the Great Depression, and it lasted 11 years.</LD>
<LD>   Today, all eyes are turned to the confrontation with Iraq.</LD>
<TE>   Let me join those who think we ought to be equally engaged in
defending our livelihoods at home. Partisanship aside, our hopes and
well-being depend as much on economic stability as on overcoming
tyranny in the Mideast. If the doves are wrong about Saddam Hussein,
experts say we still have months or years of leeway.  But if the
laissez-faire crowd is wrong about the economy, we may not.</TE>
<TE>   As Hoover discovered--and remember, he was for a time popularly
regarded as "an extremely competent leader"--there comes a point when
it's too late to act. Sometimes busts become unstoppable chain
reactions.</TE>
<TE>   Are we approaching the point of no return this time? I can speak
with authority as one of the 200 million or so American consumers on
whose shoulders this whole shaky economy has been resting for a
couple of years now. The unsettling news is taking a toll: A new
report shows cracks in the housing bubble. Poverty is once again on
the rise. Median family income has fallen two years consecutively.
One family in 10 is behind in paying its bills. Health insurance
premiums are forecast to rise 15% in the next 12 months, and the
uninsured are growing in numbers. Who can bear looking at this
autumn's 401(k) statements? Every estimate of federal debt grows
chillingly larger and clearly undermines the long-term promises of
Social Security. State and municipal governments are whacking into
the bone on everything from school financing to emergency-room
facilities.</TE>
<TE>   If the fundamentals of our economy are sound, as the president
insists, why does this drumbeat of bread-and-butter financial news,
month after month, leave so many of us with an awful feeling in our
stomachs?</TE>
<TE>   Setting aside the interesting question of what new policies the
government should pursue, shouldn't we at least be airing our options
with the same vigor that we're discussing plans for Iraq's invasion?</TE>
<TE>   Everybody in Washington is now a copy editor--an expert on shades
of meaning in words written in resolutions meant to bring Hussein to
his senses or to his knees. The economic debate, by contrast, is
vague, partisan and secondary. Al Gore was correct, if belated, in
saying that second place is no place to relegate the economy.</TE>
<TE>   The president has advanced three planks to get us on the road to
prosperity: restoring confidence in the free-enterprise system,
restraint in federal spending and top-heavy tax cuts. I, for one, am
not reassured, and I'm getting less so by the week.</TE>
<TE>   Disclosures of corporate and Wall Street misfeasance continue to
outpace the efforts of understaffed regulators and compromised
members of Congress to rouse themselves in response. As for holding
the line on government spending, the staggering cost of waging war on
the other side of the world more or less renders that possibility
moot, don't you think?</TE>
<TE>   Which leaves the upcoming phase-in of income tax cuts. Among the
ever-changing rationales advanced for this idea (remember, originally
it was to hold down the growth of government by giving back a
Treasury surplus), we are now told that it will eventually fuel
investments to keep the country moving. And here's where the ghost of
Herbert Hoover rises from the ashes. It was just this kind of
tentative pump-priming that didn't work 73 years ago in the face of
bad news.</TE>
<TE>   In answer to the inattention in Washington, our family is doing
the only thing it can. We're cutting back. I see that friends are
too. One tells me that his relatives are proposing a suspension of
gift exchanges over the holidays. We all recognize that what we're
doing will make things worse. But it seems a fair time to ask: Why
aren't the people entrusted with leadership doing more to make things
better, in the name of homeland security?</TE>

<HD>Davis Can Expect to Be Haunted by Latino Issues</HD>
<DH>Split decision on driver's licenses, farm bill angers
constituents.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>FRANK del OLMO</AU>
<BD>Frank del Olmo is associate editor of The Times.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Halloween's just around the corner, so is California Gov. Gray Davis
more afraid of a Latino ghost than he is of dozens of angry Latino
legislators and thousands of Latino voters? Why else sign a
controversial bill pushed by liberal legislators on behalf of a few
rural Latinos, then turn around and veto a similarly controversial
bill by urban Latino legislators on behalf of their working-class
constituents?</LD>
<LD>   It must have been agonizing for an ambitious career pol like
Davis. He had to choose between two highly publicized bills of equal
importance to a fast-growing Latino electorate that gave him 70% of
its votes four years ago and helped other Democrats take control of
the Legislature.</LD>
<LD>   Not surprisingly, the notoriously risk-averse Davis opted for the
safe choice.</LD>
<TE>   He ran from the ghost of Cesar Chavez, the late and widely revered
founder of the United Farm Workers union, by signing a bill pushed by
Chavez's heirs at the UFW. It creates a state system for mediation
when farm-labor contract negotiations become deadlocked, as often
happens.</TE>
<TE>   The measure was fiercely opposed by California agribusiness, which
donated more than a quarter of a million dollars to Davis' reelection
campaign in the hopes he might veto the measure.</TE>
<TE>   To hold on to at least some of his agribusiness donors, Davis
weighed the risks of vetoing the UFW bill for a very long time. So
UFW leaders prodded the governor into line by using the political
theatrics Chavez refined while building his small but politically
potent union.</TE>
<TE>   What really scared Davis were UFW threats to stage protests at
campaign events in the final weeks before the Nov. 5 election.</TE>
<TE>   The last thing an unpopular Democratic incumbent needs is poor
campesinos shaming him at campaign rallies, holding up pictures of
Chavez and the Virgin of Guadalupe.</TE>
<TE>   Davis already has enough Latinos angry with him.</TE>
<TE>   After signing the UFW bill, he vetoed a measure by Assemblyman Gil
Cedillo (D-Los Angeles) aimed at helping a different group of Latino
workers.</TE>
<TE>   Cedillo's measure would have given illegal immigrants who have
applied for legal residency the right to apply for a California
driver's license. Although the bill also mandated criminal background
checks on all applicants, Davis cited security fears in the aftermath
of Sept. 11 for his veto.</TE>
<TE>   But Cedillo and other Latinos in the Legislature who backed the
measure--a group that includes Democrats and Republicans--are
convinced the decision was purely political. "His campaign staff says
that 'driver's-licenses-for-illegals' is not polling well with swing
voters," Cedillo said.</TE>
<TE>   Cedillo is aware that a significant segment of the
electorate--which eight years ago approved Proposition 187 to deny
public services to illegal immigrants--still worries about illegal
immigration. "But I warned them that a veto would turn off lots of
Latino voters," Cedillo said. "And we've been more loyal to him and
other Democrats than swing voters. I guess they figure we have no
place else to go. But it was a purely political move, not
leadership."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, leadership is what Davis' former boss, Oakland Mayor
Edmund G. Brown Jr., showed when he was governor in 1975. He signed
the Agricultural Labor Relations Act into law, also over some
resistance from agribusiness. It gave farm laborers the right to
union-representation elections for the first time and worked well
until rabidly anti-union growers began using legal technicalities to
avoid negotiating labor contracts, even after the UFW won elections.</TE>
<TE>   Fixing such a historic law--which is all the recent UFW bill
does--should have been a no-brainer for Davis. Cedillo's bill was a
tougher call, but a real leader would have also taken that political
risk while ordering state agencies such as the Highway Patrol and the
Department of Motor Vehicles to monitor the new law for unanticipated
problems.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, several members of the Latino Legislative Caucus
decided not to endorse Davis for reelection, a symbolic slap in the
face. A few are even talking about supporting an effort by
immigrant-rights groups to organize a protest vote in favor of Green
Party gubernatorial candidate Peter Camejo, a Latino of Venezuelan
descent.</TE>
<TE>   The Camejo move "could happen because of all the anger I'm hearing
toward Davis," said Antonio Gonzalez of the nonpartisan Southwest
Voter Registration and Education project. "Maybe it'll dissipate by
the election, but he sure won't get 70% of the [Latino] vote again."</TE>

<HD>How Many Sons and Daughters Will Die?</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ARIANNA HUFFINGTON</AU>
<BD>Arianna Huffington writes a syndicated column.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sitting on a desk somewhere in the Pentagon is a computer printout
listing projected American casualties for a range of Iraq invasion
scenarios. Unfortunately, these vital figures are the only numbers
that haven't been part of the war debate.</LD>
<LD>   We've heard all kinds of estimates about how much the war is going
to cost--including Ari Fleischer's ultra-macho Bullet to Hussein's
Head discount special-- how many troops will be deployed, how much
the price of oil may go up and how long our forces will have to
remain in Iraq. But no one in the administration is talking about how
many of our soldiers will be sent home in body bags. And not a single
reporter has stood up at a press conference--or at Bush's
fund-raising appearances--and asked, "Mr. President, how many
Americans are going to die?"</LD>
<TE>   Will the deaths number in the hundreds, as was the case in Desert
Storm and as would be again if Saddam Hussein collapsed like a cheap
umbrella? Or will they be closer to the 10,000 to 50,000 some experts
have predicted? And is Hussein the clear and present danger that
would justify asking our sons and daughters to give up their lives?
The question of casualties is all the more important given the weight
attached to polls showing that more than 70% of Americans support an
invasion of Iraq. This purported groundswell of public opinion is
being dropped like an old-fashioned "dumb" bomb to kill dissent.</TE>
<TE>   Let's set aside the ludicrousness of basing our national security
policy on the shoot-from-the-lip responses of a person interrupted in
the middle of dinner and asked by a pollster, "Do you support the
president's policy on Iraq?" The fact is the number of Americans in
favor of going to war with Iraq plummets--down to 39% in the latest
Zogby poll--when the prospect of "thousands of American casualties"
is added to the question. And such a bloody outcome is likely given
the kind of urban warfare it's going to take to oust Hussein. Forget
about the caves of Tora Bora or the open desert cakewalk of the last
Gulf War. Baghdad is a densely populated city of 4 million people.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to be prepared to fight block by block in Baghdad," says
Gen. Joseph Hoar, the former commander of the military's central
command. "All our advantages of command and control, technology,
mobility, all of those things are in part given up, and you are
working with corporals and sergeants and young men fighting street to
street. It looks like the last 15 minutes of 'Saving Private Ryan.' "</TE>
<TE>   The high number of casualties that would result from gaining
control of a heavily defended Baghdad is the main reason Colin
Powell, Norman Schwarzkopf and the president's father pulled up short
of the city the last time we took on Hussein. And Hussein is a master
of that ruthless strategy known as "the human shield." Even the
smartest of bombs will not be able to discern between his Republican
Guards and Iraqi children. That will be the dangerous business of
Army rangers, Marine expeditionary units and other special forces.</TE>
<TE>   And unlike the Gulf War, which was primarily about the liberation
of Kuwait, this war is about the elimination of Hussein. We've heard
again and again that this ruthless despot will do anything to
preserve his regime. We also know that he has been amassing
stockpiles of biological and chemical weapons, hideous
high-body-count instruments disdained by the civilized world.</TE>
<TE>   You don't have to be George Tenet to connect these dots. If
Hussein is going down, he's taking as many of us with him as he can.</TE>
<TE>   "The likelihood is very good that he could use weapons of mass
destruction," Gen. John M. Shalikashvili, the former chairman of the
Joint Chiefs of Staff, told the Senate Armed Services Committee in
September. "It could get very messy.... The casualties, in my
judgment, could be very high."</TE>
<TE>   We are told by the proponents of invading Iraq that it's necessary
to prevent future casualties. But in order to make an informed
decision on the war, shouldn't the people also be told how many
casualties we have to suffer now to avoid those future ones?</TE>

<HD>Research Scandal May Hang Up Future of Telecommunications</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>A. MICHAEL NOLL</AU>
<BD>A. Michael Noll is a professor and former dean at the
Annenberg School for Communication at USC.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The scandal at Bell Labs involving the fabrication by Jan Hendrik
Schon of scientific results may well be the final period in the
history of that great research institution.</LD>
<LD>   Yet the issues unearthed by the scandal extend beyond Bell Labs
and are indicative of systemic problems in the scientific profession
itself. One such issue involves the practice of multiple authors of
scientific papers.</LD>
<LD>   The coauthors of a paper must accept responsibility for the truth
and validity of the content of the paper. But in many scientific
disciplines, multiple authorship has become a means to give credit to
one's colleagues who have contributed to the work but who are not
responsible for the content and claims of the paper. This practice
should stop.</LD>
<TE>   Bell Labs should lead the revision of the abuse of coauthoring and
encourage a return to the use of acknowledgments in papers to make it
clear who did and contributed exactly what to the scientific work.
Like chief executives who are now required to sign off on the
veracity of corporate financials, all coauthors of a scientific paper
should, in effect, sign off on the veracity of the scientific results
and claims in the paper.</TE>
<TE>   The committee of five independent experts formed by Bell Labs
(headed by physicist Malcolm Beasley) was thorough in its lengthy
investigation of the allegations of "scientific misconduct" by Schon
and concluded that he "committed misconduct in 16" of the 24
allegations that were investigated. The committee sidestepped the
issue of coauthorship and also seemed cautious in chastising Schon
firmly.</TE>
<TE>   The management of Bell Labs should be responsible for ensuring the
truth and quality of the research performed there. It is almost
unbelievable that no one witnessed or saw any of the key experiments,
working devices or data to confirm Schon's claims.</TE>
<TE>   It was as if management and Schon's colleagues and coauthors were
asleep--or overly keen for publicity and occupied with other issues
(such as the price of parent company Lucent Technologies stock). This
could not have happened at the Bell Labs of the past, in which
management and colleagues would have been breaking down lab doors to
witness outstanding discoveries with their own eyes.</TE>
<TE>   The last few years have not been good for fundamental research in
telecommunications at Bell and other labs. The emphasis has been on
practical, short-term, product-related work and also on publicity to
confirm the premier role of Bell Labs in the Lucent empire.</TE>
<TE>   The continuing restructuring of Lucent, coupled with its financial
crises, have resulted in empty labs, the transfer of colleagues to
other companies and resignations. Morale is low, not only at Bell
Labs but at other telecommunication research laboratories.</TE>
<TE>   Manufacturers such as Lucent depend on fundamental research for
their long-term future. But the short-term success of manufacturers
will be determined by today's products and the ability to manufacture
them inexpensively and profitably. The vast majority of the work done
at Bell Labs involves the design and development of these products
and systems.</TE>
<TE>   Clearly, Lucent can survive in the short term without the basic
research of Bell Labs. It is the long-term future of
telecommunications that will be the real victim. That future depends
on the innovations in new fundamental knowledge.</TE>
<TE>   In the past, many of these innovations came from Bell Labs, such
as information theory, the photovoltaic solar cell, radio astronomy
and, of course, the transistor.</TE>
<TE>   Without research at Bell Labs, where will the future be?</TE>

<HD>High School Exit Exam Tests Student Standards</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "State Ponders Delaying Exit Exams Due to Failures," Oct. 1:</LD>
<LD>   During the deliberations of the High School Exit Exam Advisory
Panel from July 1999 to January 2002, I, along with many others,
suggested delaying the consequences of the exam from applying to the
class of 2004 to the class of 2008.</LD>
<LD>   My students have the benefit of a qualified mathematics teacher
who majored in math in college. Many students in our state are not so
fortunate. They are not being taught by qualified math teachers.</LD>
<TE>   The problem, as explained by members of the advisory panel, is as
severe in rural districts as it is in urban ones.</TE>
<TE>   The members of the class of 2004 have not had the benefits of
class-size reduction or other state-mandated reforms. Yet they are
being held accountable for concepts that are based on elementary and
middle school instruction.</TE>
<TE>   The entire process of the high-stakes California High School Exit
Exam was pushed through in haste.</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately, the students are the ones most likely to suffer if
the state Board of Education chooses not to delay the requirement.</TE>
<TE>   Betsy Adams</TE>
<TE>   Rancho Palos Verdes</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   As a high school math teacher I can sympathize with the ninth- to
11th-graders and their situation. For the first time in their
academic careers they are being held accountable for their learning.
Unfortunately, some students are being held accountable after being
promoted through the system for eight years.</TE>
<TE>   There is no exit exam for elementary or middle school, only high
school. It would make more sense to phase it in at the lower levels,
as the students would have more time for remediation should they fall
behind.</TE>
<TE>   However, the high school exit exam only tests through ninth-grade
English and mathematics skills. A high school senior unable to pass
this exam should not be awarded a diploma, as basic high school
proficiency has not been demonstrated.</TE>
<TE>   If the state delays implementation of the exit exam, the message I
hear is: "We will water down the test even more so that 90% of the
students can pass it so we will not be sued."</TE>
<TE>   The message I would like to hear is: "High school graduates must
demonstrate a minimum competency in ninth-grade English and
mathematics or a high school diploma will not be awarded."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>I quite agree with John Balzar's Oct. 2 commentary, "Quality May
Serve Us Better Than Quantity at the Polls," most especially his
observation that preparing oneself to vote--by researching the
issues--can be a very difficult process.</LD>
<LD>   I have never missed voting in an election, including primaries.
Ever since I began to vote, I have always been extremely frustrated
by what strikes me as an intentional tactic to keep voters confused.
Nowhere is this more apparent than with state initiatives, which
really seem to have become an industry all their own. When the sample
ballots show up in the mail, I'm always amazed at how different a
sense I get about each initiative when I read it in plain print, as
opposed to what I've just heard in the ad campaigns--they're never
the same!</LD>
<LD>   I wish that campaign finance reform had taken place in a real way,
not the emasculated do-nothing measure that Congress passed this
year. I wish it were illegal for candidates or initiative campaigns
to buy unlimited advertising. I wish the media exposure for
candidates was limited to free time given equally to all runners, or
limited to bought time allotted in equal amounts for all candidates,
so that these elections were not merely responses to who has the
better ad campaign.</LD>

<TE>   Port Hueneme</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Balzar presents an interesting but inherently dangerous argument
on why we need not be concerned over lack of voter turnout in
elections across the country. His argument that only those who have
done their homework on the issues and candidates are in an informed
position to cast a ballot smacks of the same logic that has been used
throughout history to deny voting rights to the working class, women
and minorities.</TE>
<TE>   In a democracy, everyone, no matter how ill-informed, has the
right to vote and should exercise it. That's the price you pay for
democracy.</TE>

<LD>Re James Johnson's Oct. 1 letter on union dockworkers: The Pacific
Maritime Assn., an entity composed largely of foreign-owned shipping
companies, makes billions off the backs of American workers and would
like nothing better than to pay them peanuts while charging retailers
the same cost for their cargo, pocketing the difference.</LD>
<LD>   The American workers are entitled to a share of the wealth they
create. Longshoring is no walk in the park; there have been six
work-related deaths on the docks this year alone. As for teachers and
police, there is no doubt they deserve more money, but their salaries
do not come from foreign profiteers, they come from our taxes. Most
people are not willing to accept a tax increase for any reason.</LD>

<LD>Re "Enjoyable Drive Foiled by Foliage," letter, Oct. 1: As a
professional artist, I couldn't agree more that Kent Twitchell's
murals are some of the best in Los Angeles. However, to remove a
healthy tree in downtown Los Angeles, next to a busy freeway no less,
would be a criminal act. If those trees were removed, as your letter
writer suggests, and "the traffic comes to a complete standstill,"
she still wouldn't be able to study the mural--it would be impossible
to see through the smog.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Mayor Shows Bolder, Politically Savvy Side," by Beth Shuster and
Henry Weinstein, news analysis, Oct. 3: Why should Angelenos be
surprised at Mayor James Hahn's choice of William Bratton as police
chief simply because the new chief has a strong personality and might
generate more press than the mayor? A look at Hahn's record shows a
man who has always been more interested in serving the people of L.A.
than chasing headlines. We should be grateful for a mayor who is
willing to make the choice he feels is best for the people,
regardless of the risk. How many cities can lay claim to a mayor
whose primary motivation is service rather than ego?</LD>
<LD>   Bud Hayes</LD>
<LD>   Los Angeles</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Politically savvy? Shuster and Weinstein must be a comedy team.
For decades prior to Chief Willie Williams, white police chiefs were
standard fare for L.A., mostly appointed by white mayors. What is so
bold about that? Hahn isn't low-key; very simply, he is the typical
wimp who was born with a silver spoon in his mouth. He's only the
mayor because he took advantage of what his father gave him, i.e.,
the black vote. He messed that up too. I'm sure Bratton's a good cop,
but so were the other candidates.</TE>
<TE>   The minority communities that make up the majority in L.A. feel
disenfranchised by the LAPD. The only way this was politically savvy
is if those voters remain apathetic at the next election.</TE>

<LD>Re "Saddams Everywhere," editorial, Oct. 2: Finally, some humor on my
morning newspaper's editorial page. Thank you. But your comments on
Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle (D-S.D.) and former Vice President
Al Gore invite a little balance. Imagine, with a little hair dye and
mustache, the Great Little Mr. Bush could stand in for Saddam Hussein
and, mixing metaphorical casting, Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld
could stand in for Field Marshal Erwin Rommel in a reprise of the
1951 movie with James Mason, "The Desert Fox." Isn't control of the
oil fields still the ancient feud?</LD>
<LD>   Regime change happens. Of course, not to threaten our field
marshal, Rummy should be promised safety on return from another
desert dust-up to yet again be an overpaid CEO for his next giggle.</LD>

<LD>Brides today are sickening and self-centered and only care about
showing up people who are supposed to be their friends ("Brides Pay
Princely Sum to Be Cinderellas," Oct. 2). I hope Renee Rodriquez and
Michael Matthews feel good that part of their $42,000 could have been
contributed to a good charity, many of which are in need of
donations. What makes the day special is the gift of togetherness,
not how much you spend on a cake that assuredly will taste bad and a
lame serving dish to add to the 10 never used anyway. For men, a keg
of beer and a good football game on TV are all you really need for a
good wedding reception.</LD>

<TE>   With half of all marriages ending in divorce, and financial
problems being at the root of most of those divorces, it seems that
spending what would amount to a 15% down payment on the median

<LD>Re "We Carried the Torch Far Too Long," Commentary, Oct. 2: I can

of Sen. Robert Torricelli's self-serving, teary-eyed, belated but
forced announcement that he was withdrawing from his race to be
reelected senator from New Jersey is right on the mark.</LD>
<LD>   The most outrageous of his many infamous farewell statements was
his pleading, "When did we become such an unforgiving people?"
Arianna, it was even before Torricelli slipped that Rolex watch on
his wrist. Torricelli finally realized that New Jersey voters found
out about all of his sleazy dealings.</LD>

<LD>The voice coming over the line from Wellington, New Zealand--an
unmistakably Kiwi voice--crackles with mock indignation. His new book
a hoax? "The very nature of hoaxes is that a hoaxer would never admit
to hoaxing," Burton Silver says. "But this book is not a hoax, of
course."</LD>
<LD>   Uh-huh.</LD>
<LD>   So, Burton Silver, you're telling us that there are artists who
paint cats--not pictures of cats, but using cats as the canvas--and
that said cats submit to the indignity of being tarted up as a
butterfly, a peacock, a giraffe, a pig, a leopard, a tartan blanket,
a skeleton or Santa Claus--or just to match their owners' home decor?</LD>
<TE>   Is it just possible that the fancied-up felines in "Why Paint
Cats: The Ethics of Feline Aesthetics" (Ten Speed Press) are
computer-generated creations?</TE>
<TE>   "We never talk about how the artwork is done," replies Silver,
adding, "I stand by everything that's said in this book."</TE>
<TE>   Sure. And cats are born artists, too, as Silver and photographer
Heather Busch showed us in an earlier collaboration, "Why Cats
Paint," their earlier book that has sold 675,000 copies.</TE>
<TE>   About the new book one thing is indisputable: It is very, very
funny. Now, it's no secret that in the cats-as-artists book, Silver
and Busch were spoofing art criticism. Still, Silver says, "some of
the art world took it seriously and wrote reviews in a very serious
way and clearly had no idea it was a parody."</TE>
<TE>   Others played along. Silver particularly delights in telling how
the Sunday Times of London piled parody upon parody and "ripped into
the book for not including the Renaissance period of cat art."</TE>
<TE>   Silver notes, "It's very hard to use human artists to spoof
artists and the art world. It's crazy what's happening. It's art if
you say it's art, no matter what you throw out there. I could take a
carrot and split it in half and put a line of toothpaste down each
half and put a little spotlight on it and, provided I put [a price
of] $1,500 on it, it would be regarded with some concern."</TE>
<TE>   So now, it's the cats who are themselves getting painted. And,
just as some people believed--really believed--that cats paint, there
are those who believe that there are artists who really painted these
cats, and for fees in the five figures.</TE>
<TE>   Asked what he is spoofing this time--cat lovers, animal activists
or perhaps psychiatrists?--Silver seems to be suppressing a laugh as
he shoots back, "It's not a spoof. Who said it was a spoof? Why are
you people all so negative?"</TE>
<TE>   His text is tongue-in-cheek scholarly, complete with footnotes and
a bibliography. And there are two book cover blurbs praising the
book, one from the nonexistent L.A. Art Times, whose reviewer lauded
it as a celebration of "an exciting new art form," the other from the
nonexistent U.K. Cat Weekly, which found it "a work that will be
truly inspiring for some and deeply disturbing for others."</TE>
<TE>   Putting to good use his degrees in psychology and sociology, he
has sprinkled the text with references to obscure cultures that
pioneered cat painting. He has his "artists" and "critics" spouting
scholarly sounding prose about things such as transforming cat into
god, observations on contemporary sexual mores, how painting cats
gives us new insights into their psyches and even the palliative
potential of painted cats.</TE>
<TE>   The footnotes cite activist organizations including Artists for
the Ethical Treatment of Animals and F.L.A.P (Free Laboratory Animals
Permanently), C.R.O.K.(Cats Rule OK) and the Journal of the
Embellished Cat. Vol. II. "Just because you can't find such an
organization doesn't mean to say it's not true," Silver insists. The
"artists," some of whom appear quite mad, natter on in the book about
"kinetic observationalism" (how painting cats with moons and stars
enables them to tune into the cosmos), "neo-totemism" (the
appropriation of the art of indigenous cultures to assuage
imperialist guilt), "transfigurationalism" (toward a more spiritual
understanding of the cat), "re-environmentalism" (imposing the image
of another species onto the cat to increase our understanding of
territorial prerogative) and "transmogrificationism" (confronting our
prejudices by transforming the lovable cat into a less appealing
species).</TE>
<TE>   Asked for phone numbers for some of the artists, Silver regretted
that they were unavailable. Matt Gauri, an Angeleno who became a
full-time cat painter after being fired from his pet motel grooming
job over a mix-up in which he painted the wrong white cat to resemble
a pig, was, alas, in India, Silver said. San Francisco hairstylists
Jackie and Jay Bloomfield had given up cat painting after an Arab
client's cat, on whom they'd painted Arabic slogans, was either run
over or mutilated by anti-Islamists.</TE>
<TE>   Likewise, the books in Silver's selected bibliography were, well,
elusive. Among these: "Simply Unfurgettable," "The Cat as Canvas,"
"Purrmutations" and "Financially Feline."</TE>
<TE>   Now, assuming that one can paint a cat, how does one go about it?
Before applying peroxide and nontoxic dyes, we're told, some artists
employ pre-paint petting therapy, others swear by hypnosis and still
others just kind of sneak up on the sleeping cat.</TE>
<TE>   Deadpans Silver, "Fortunately, cats spend a great deal of their
time asleep. I'm told that, provided you do the right pre-painting
preparation exercises, where you take a damp brush and kind of brush
the cat quietly while it's asleep, it will get used to that and wake
up a vivid green and wonder why it's getting a lot of attention."</TE>
<TE>   One artist describes how he paints cats' whiskers in a multicolor
striated pattern, numbing them first by gently massaging each whisker
with the pointed end of a paintbrush. Having one's cat painted is
pricey, considering that the average dye job lasts two months. But
most artists offer the equivalent of root touch-ups.</TE>
<TE>   In his text, Silver describes new airbrushes that use static
electricity to draw the cat's fur up in small tufts and tells about a
cat owner who spent $400 to have her kitty painted like a K9 dog so
as to intimidate the neighbor's fox terrier. He also passes along one
artist's observation that cats painted with fish designs spend more
time near water while those painted with birds spend more time
climbing trees.</TE>
<TE>   A book buyer from Seattle protested in an e-mail to Amazon.com
that the book should come with a disclaimer. "Like a fool, I was
taken in ... and tried to paint my cat, Mr. Pie. Needless to say, he
did NOT go for it. The peroxide burned his eyes and he scratched the
hell out of my arms.... What was I thinking? Paint+cats=disaster."</TE>
<TE>   But a reader in New Zealand was mesmerized by the "compliant
felines," opining that their willingness to submit to, and strut,
their body art speaks volumes for their eccentricity. And more than
one newspaper reviewer has bought it lock, stock and scratching
post--even the bit about a New York stockbroker paying $16,000 to
have an image of Charlie Chaplin painted on his cat's bum to express
his sentiments about Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   That painter cats and painted cats sprang from the brain of
57-year-old Silver is no stretch given that--and he swears this part
is true--he has been a safari guide and a buffalo shooter, has taught
art to aboriginal lepers, written a cartoon about a hedgehog and
worked at an Indian high altitude warfare school in Kashmir.</TE>
<TE>   He also invented a game called GolfCross, which is much like golf
except that the balls are oval and instead of holes, there are
suspended goals through which players must shoot the balls. He is
also founder of the International Fringe Games, a venue he is pushing
in hopes of popularizing events such as slalom running, bicycle
hurdling and sprints enlivened by inserting cartwheels and
handsprings. "Sport has become very unexplorative," he explains.</TE>
<TE>   Between the giggles, there is a serious message in "Why Paint
Cats." Silver says, "I think anybody would very clearly see that it
is not a how-to book. It's a why book. We want to encourage the
ethical discussion of whether we should be allowed to manipulate
animals in this way." He hopes the book will initiate a broader
discussion of how people treat animals, of whether they should be
bred to conform to societal standards of beauty, having their tails
knotted or docked or whatever, or be otherwise costumed or fancied up
for our entertainment. Silver is "appalled" when someone sees the
pictures and says, "I want one of these cats. Where can I get one?"
He hopes people will look at the pictures and say, "Hang on--should
we be doing that? Is it OK to alter the look of a cat for our own
enjoyment? It's very hard to justify that it's for the cat's
welfare." He can justify painting giant eyeballs on cats so as to
alert birds to danger.</TE>
<TE>   "Why Paint Cats" didn't ruffle any fur at PETA, People for the
Ethical Treatment of Animals. President Ingrid Newkirk thinks Silver
and Busch's work is a "just a stitch." While suggesting that perhaps
"Why Paint Cats" should come with a disclaimer, Newkirk says, "This
is having fun with animals that doesn't hurt them in the least. It's
pure whimsy, all good fun."</TE>
<TE>   Although some people may buy into it and take a fling at painting
their cats, Newkirk isn't too concerned. "You just try to hold a cat
down and convert it into a porcupine. They're not turtles, where you
rub their tummies and they just go into a trance."</TE>

<HD>Author's Angry Worlds Have a Cult Following</HD>
<DH>In the novel 'Lullaby,' words can kill, but they're author
Chuck Palahniuk's real-life 'coping mechanisms'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUSAN SALTER REYNOLDS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"You scare me," a visitor recently tells Chuck Palahniuk, author of
the newly released "Lullaby: A Novel," and, more famously, 1996's
"Fight Club," a cult novel that was made into a movie starring Brad
Pitt and Edward Norton. He looks shocked and wounded.</LD>
<LD>   And he should. Palahniuk, 40, is not a scary person. He is neat,
almost fastidious in his appearance and manner. He speaks clearly in
complete sentences and fully formed ideas. But the eyes give it away.
The eyes are wild.</LD>
<LD>   They are the eyes of the man who wrote in "Fight Club": "Pounding
that kid, I really wanted to put a bullet between the eyes of every
endangered panda that wouldn't screw to save its species and every
whale or dolphin that gave up and ran itself aground. Don't think of
this as extinction. Think of this as downsizing."</LD>
<TE>   They are the eyes of the man who wrote in "Lullaby": "Spraying
blood, Helen says, 'No, No, No!' and crawling through the sharp
slivers of broken color, her voice thick and blurred from her ruined
teeth, she grabs all the pieces. Sobbing, covered in bile and blood,
the room stinking, she clutches the broken blue pieces. The hands and
tiny feet, the crushed torso and dented head, she hugs them to her
chest and screams, 'Oh, Patrick! Patty!' "</TE>
<TE>   These are the kinds of passages that upset Lynne Cheney. They are
also the kinds of passages that make "cult" authors out of plain, old
fiction writers. What does it mean to be a cult writer? It means you
have Web sites dedicated to your work, people who try to re-create
the world you created, people who dress up and act out and
reinterpret again and again the meaning of your words as they apply
to their lives.</TE>
<TE>   "That's just my friends Amy and Dave," Palahniuk jokes of the
myriad places floating in cyberspace where you can read about him.</TE>
<TE>   Well, shucks. Critics love him too. Kirkus Reviews let its hair
down in an uncharacteristically chummy review. "Outrageous, darkly
comic fun." And from Booklist: "It's a fun ride, but what separates
this novel from Palahniuk's previous work is its emotional depth, its
ability to explore the unbearable pain of losing a child just as
richly as it laments our consume-or-die worldview."</TE>
<TE>   "Lullaby" (Doubleday) has a totally engaging, thoroughly ingenious
plot: There is a book, "Poems and Lullabies From Around the World,"
that contains poems to quiet children so they can sleep. It contains
one lullaby (on page 27) that also kills them. The mysterious deaths
are attributed to crib death.</TE>
<TE>   It turns out, mild-mannered reporter Carl Streator learns, it also
kills adults. All you have to do is think it and bam, that person's
dead.</TE>
<TE>   This poses a dilemma for Streator, a fairly angry person who
frequently feels he would like to kill people (but not really kill
them). He is forced to count vigorously to distract himself whenever
he feels the poem coming on. Helen Hoover Boyle is a highly coiffed
real estate agent who knows the secret too. Her assistant Mona is a
lovely hippie into Wicca. Mona's boyfriend is an obnoxious hippie
named Oyster who is the novel's main pedagogue.</TE>
<TE>   Streator tries very hard not to kill him but ultimately does.</TE>
<TE>   The four team up to round up all existing copies of the book in
libraries around the country so they can destroy page 27. If the poem
were actually printed in the book, it would, no doubt, strike fear in
readers.</TE>
<TE>   Many of Palahniuk's five novels contain the idea that civilization
must be destroyed before it can be cured of all its many evils.
Palahniuk, who seems to have digested a lot of literary theory,
attributes this to Foucault. "You have to offer a viable, spectacular
third option somewhere between things remaining the same and violent
change. Look at Y2K. Everyone was hoping something would change, but
it didn't."</TE>
<TE>   Palahniuk, who lives in Portland, Ore., grew up in a trailer in
the Southern California desert, where train derailments were the only
excitement. His mother worked in a nuclear power plant. His father
was murdered three years ago.</TE>
<TE>   "Writing is my chief coping mechanism," he says. "In a way, I'm
just killing time, trying to distract myself. I like writing active
stuff and anger is such an active emotion. Without it, there's
depression. We have a real inability in this society to live side by
side with our anger. That's why it explodes in places like Columbine.
We need bursts of chaos. We need to be able to hurt each other in a
consensual way."</TE>
<TE>   Palahniuk discusses his theories on society's ills over a plate of
lettuce at a Westside restaurant. The restaurant is quiet. An old
woman eats alone. A clock ticks. On the hour, a little band comes out
and plays a show tune. Palahniuk is wearing khakis and a
short-sleeved shirt tucked in. He sits so upright and attentive that
one is instantly aware of one's own bad posture.</TE>
<TE>   "I was flying to Great Britain recently, and the guy behind the
ticket counter at the airport was in a terrible mood. It turns out
his back was killing him. I offered him a Vicodin, and he just beamed
at me. 'Are you a doctor?' he said. 'No,' I said. 'I'm a writer.' "</TE>
<TE>   Palahniuk adheres to the principles of minimalism, as outlined by
writer and writing teacher Gordon Lish. Don't use adverbs. A reader
should feel the writing physically. And it only takes one idea to
drive a book. You use the same set of horses or ideas to get your
characters from Michigan to Oregon and back again.</TE>
<TE>   Which horses does Palahniuk use? "You mean what is my personal
investment? We all think if we can just get away from the nest, we'll
be OK. Then we find ourselves longing for community. By the end of my
books, the main character has found community. The rest is just
hamburger."</TE>

<LD>Soon my high school senior will be sitting for what has come to feel
like the most important exam of her life, the one capable of laying
waste to all those late nights of homework we once thought were
enough to chart her course.</LD>
<LD>   And while I have spent years deriding the SAT as a test measuring
nothing that really matters, it seems to have become the barometer of
her success, and I've come to regard it as fearfully as she. So I am
willing to pay through the nose to help her cram for the magic
numbers that she believes will unlock the door to the college of her
dreams.</LD>
<LD>   She needs to raise her score, she says, to improve her chance of
getting in. So she sits night after night at the kitchen table,
hunched over a thick binder of test-taking tips and practice exams,
studying math worksheets and vocabulary lists. Prevaricate, gambol,
avarice ... drop is to downpour as what is to blizzard?</LD>
<TE>   And I feel the pressure building in both of us, as the clock winds
down in her college quest.</TE>
<TE>   "You would know these words if you'd read more books," I say with
irritation, when she checks with me on a definition. I look over her
shoulder, scolding her as she ponders a complicated analogy. "All
those times I told you to read ....This wouldn't be so hard if you
had listened to me."</TE>
<TE>   She slams the book shut in frustration, yells something about
being too busy working a job and doing homework and taking care of my
kids--her sisters--to read. She stomps upstairs to her room, in
tears.</TE>
<TE>   And I feel angry not at her, but at myself, because I fear we are
allowing one test, one choice, one imperfect process, to become a
litmus test of my daughter's worth and, by extension, my mothering.</TE>
<TE>   I've never been the sort of mother to place academics above
everything else. I insisted on homework being done, but beyond that I
simply sent my three girls off to school each morning with a kiss and
a prayer, and an admonition to "do your best."</TE>
<TE>   And now, as my oldest stands on the threshold of a life on her
own, away from me, I'm forced to consider that her best might not be
good enough for some faceless college admissions committee.</TE>
<TE>   I've always told her to be herself, that her soul shines through
her eccentricities. But now, I feel her comparing herself to the
brainiacs--kids who spent their weekends doing research in medical
labs and their summers digging for fossils in Greece--and I wonder if
I've shortchanged her by not being more demanding.</TE>
<TE>   Like tuning forks that vibrate at the same pitch, we feed on each
other's insecurities. She frets about essays and exams and whether
she's done enough to compete. I nag her to strike the word "like"
from her speech and wish that she could recite passages from
Shakespeare's plays as fluently as she does the dialogue from Austin
Powers movies.</TE>
<TE>   I can't help wondering how a college recruiter will rate a kid who
drops everything and opens her arms whenever she sees a child in
need, who puts her homework on hold and stays up all night when a
troubled friend needs consoling, who worries before a track meet not
just about whether she'll win the race but whether her competitors
"will be nice girls who like me."</TE>
<TE>   And my daughter must be wondering how her mother has come to see
her as a package of grades and SATs, and turned her strengths into
deficiencies.</TE>
<TE>   She's in bed when I get home from work, surrounded by textbooks
and lab sheets and calculators. Her eyes are glazed and rimmed with
dark circles from lack of sleep. "Mommy," she says, in a voice that
suggests the little girl she used to be, "will you lay next to me?"</TE>
<TE>   I slip in beside her as she slides over, making room for me in the
tiny bed she's slept in since she was 3. I rub her head and she
closes her eyes, and our conversation flows easily ... from my car's
squeaky brakes to her English test to what she should wear for
homecoming.</TE>
<TE>   And I find even the mundane bittersweet, our every interaction
overlaid these days with the relentless sound of a clock ticking. A
year from now, there will be no chance for moments like these.</TE>
<TE>   I look at her and my heart seizes up, as I imagine her on a
college campus miles from me, with professors who never learn her
name, a roommate who likes smoking weed, a boyfriend I might not get
to meet.</TE>
<TE>   She drifts off to sleep as I stroke her hair, just as she did when
she was a baby. And for that moment, at least, I forget about grades
and essays and SATs. She is perfect just the way she is.</TE>
<TE>   This is not a measure of my daughter's worth or of my mothering,
just a passage that will require us both to meet another of the
challenges that growing up brings.</TE>

<LD>There were no last-minute regrets from this star. Not only did Reese
Witherspoon host a benefit that raised $600,000 for the Rape
Treatment Center of Santa Monica-UCLA Medical Center, she did it with
a broken foot and on the weekend her new film, "Sweet Home Alabama,"
broke box-office records. "It's a testament to her character that
she's here," said "Friends" star David Schwimmer as he introduced the
winsome actress to 800 guests during the brunch last Sunday at the
Beverly Hills estate of Ron Burkle.</LD>
<LD>   As a "mother of a 3-year old girl, recent media attention on the
sexual abuse of children has been at the forefront of my mind,"
Witherspoon told the crowd. "I've asked myself, 'How do people seek
treatment?' 'Where do they go?' " She said it has been an "amazing"
discovery to learn about the Rape Treatment Center and the Stuart
House program for child victims.</LD>
<TE>   Since it was established in 1974, the center has treated 26,000
rape survivors, founder Gail Abarbanel told attendees who included
Ryan Phillippe (Witherspoon's husband), Jim Belushi, Corbin Bernsen
and Susan Dey. Only recently, patients at the center's Verna Harrah
Clinic ranged from a "3-month old baby to an 87-year-old woman," said
Abarbanel. "Most [rape victims] go to hospital emergency rooms and
wait for hours to get care while the evidence deteriorates." The
center is working with local, state and federal agencies to ensure
that evidence in rape cases is processed in a timely way. The most
prevalent form of rape is called "acquaintance rape," she said.
"Eighty-percent of rapes are committed by someone the victims know."</TE>
<TE>   Museum Awards</TE>
<TE>   Surrounded by friends, family members and fellow industry leaders,
actor Ted Danson and producer Dick Wolf were honored for their
contributions to prime-time entertainment at a benefit that raised
$625,000 for the Museum of Television &amp; Radio. "Both have had
extraordinary careers. Both are respected for their work," museum
president Robert Batscha said as he stood on the red carpet at the
Regent Beverly Wilshire Hotel. Attending with his wife, actress Mary
Steenburgen, Danson said he would use the opportunity to "go onstage
and thank everybody who has helped me and tell them I love them."</TE>
<TE>   Wolf, creator of such television blockbusters as "Law &amp; Order" and
"Crime &amp; Punishment," called being singled out by the museum a
"thrill." "The museum has been a part of my life for a long time," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   With locations in New York and Beverly Hills, the museum that has
preserved more than 110,000 programs is "the only place in the world
where the public can come and see historical performances," Batscha
said at last Sunday's gala.</TE>
<TE>   The museum's most popular TV show? " 'I Love Lucy,' " he said.</TE>
<TE>   Guests included Dennis Franz, Mariska Hargitay, John Ritter,
George Lopez, Catherine Bell, Doris Roberts, Tom Schlamme, Christine
Lahti, Larry David and Dennis Weaver.</TE>
<TE>   Gourmet Fests</TE>
<TE>   To cap the 20th anniversary of the American Wine &amp; Food Festival
on Sept. 28 at Universal Studios, Wolfgang Puck and his wife, Barbara
Lazaroff, hosted a Chef's Grand Tasting Dinner the following day at
Spago Beverly Hills. The two events raised $500,000 for the Meals on
Wheels programs of Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "We support Meals on Wheels because we always see the people who
have enough money and food and we need to take care of those who
don't--who can't get out of their homes," said Puck, as he mingled at
Spago with 200 guests, including Priscilla Presley, Suzanne Somers
and Lionel Ritchie. Among items on the mouth-watering menu: truffle
soup prepared by Paul Bocuse, who came from Lyon, France; medallions
of veal with mango glaze from Paul Prudhomme; and twice-baked almond
croissants with Santa Rose plum ice cream from Nancy Silverton and
Kimberly Boyce.</TE>
<TE>   More than 1,500 people attended the festival staged on the back
lot of Universal that showcased the specialties of 31 chefs,
including New York's Tom Colicchio of Craft and Gramercy Tavern
restaurants, Jonathan Waxman of Washington Park, and San Francisco's
Michael Mina of Aqua.</TE>
<TE>   "We started this event in the parking lot with four chefs," said a
festival spokeswoman. "We've grown because chefs really love this
cause."</TE>
<TE>   Romancing the Stone</TE>
<TE>   The ruins of its Great Stone Church lighted for the first time,
historic Mission San Juan Capistrano provided the backdrop for a
benefit raising $100,000 for its preservation projects. Presented by
the Friends of the Mission, the Sept. 27 gala gave guests the chance
to view the restored ruins--sometimes referred to as "the American
Acropolis"--and dine on a tequila-laced feast in the main courtyard
prepared by chefs John Sedlar and Christian Rassinoux. The church was
completed in 1806 and devastated by an earthquake in 1812. "We are on
holy ground--one of the most beautiful sites in California," said
Janet Curci Walsh, co-chairwoman with Cecilia Nott and Ann Raney.
Honorary chairpersons were Sandra Segerstrom Daniels, John Daniels,
John Dravinski and Nora Webster.</TE>
<TE>   Hollywood Habitat</TE>
<TE>   It was the last thing you expected of a pad belonging to James
Bond: humble, low-slung, casually furnished. But that's exactly what
guests saw when they visited the Malibu beach house belonging to
Pierce Brosnan and Keely Shaye Smith. Part of the House &amp; Gardens
Luxuries of the Garden Tour benefiting Hollywood for Habitat, the
yellow, one-story house--one of two the couple own in the Malibu
area--was the site of a formal tea staged on the sand under a
sprawling white canopy.</TE>
<TE>   Smith wanted to participate in the benefit tour because she
believes in the work of Habitat for Humanity, the nonprofit
organization which helps provide housing for low-income families.
Hollywood for Habitat is the branch supported by the entertainment
industry. "I think everyone should have the opportunity to live
somewhere wonderful," she said at the Sept. 28 event that raised
about $20,000. "This charity is so profound--it gives people a break,
a leg up, a chance to start over."</TE>
<TE>   Brosnan was in Thailand promoting his new James Bond flick, "Die
Another Day."</TE>

<HD>Village Sheds Light on Solar Power</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BENJAMIN FORGEY</AU>
<BD>WASHINGTON POST</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Take the energy of several hundred college students, mix well with
donations from companies big and small, add generous dashes of
inspiration and a bucketful of opportunity, and you get ... a solar
subdivision on the National Mall.</LD>
<LD>   It is an odd, invigorating sight: 14 diminutive houses, each
meeting all of its own energy needs by harnessing the power of the
sun, lined up right down the middle of the Mall's central greensward.</LD>
<LD>   Called the Solar Decathlon, the temporary village is the
brainchild of a dedicated bureaucrat at the Department of Energy.
With the Capitol dome and the Washington Monument as background
decoration, it's probably the best advertisement solar housing has
ever had in this country.</LD>
<TE>   "There are two myths about solar energy for homes," says Richard
King, the 16-year Energy Department veteran who conceived the
decathlon. "One is that it doesn't work, the other is that it doesn't
look good. We're here to prove the opposite."</TE>
<TE>   Most of us know at some level that solar power works, that we
cannot live without the sun and that, somehow, we ought to live
better with it. And we know, or ought to, that solar power is a
potent, clean alternative to dirty--if so far cheap--fossil fuels.
Even the most outsized McMansion utilizes sunlight for heat and
comfort</TE>
<TE>   But in the competitive market to furnish our homes with energy,
solar power has been a dud because it doesn't deliver the amounts we
demand at prices most of us would be willing to pay. And for decades
solar design suffered outcast status because in reality most of the
solar homes produced since the energy crises of the 1970s look like
outcasts.</TE>
<TE>   This is changing, though seemingly at a snail's pace--renewable
energy sources such as the sun account for only 4% of the nation's
energy consumption. Still, the technology for transforming sunlight
into electrical energy gradually has improved, and prices are coming
down. Awareness is slowly spreading about the advantages of "passive"
solar design; for example, situating a house to take proper advantage
of prevailing sunlight and winds.</TE>
<TE>   The Solar Decathlon is intended to speed up the pace of change,
and it may well succeed. It is guaranteed to sharpen the awareness of
anyone who visits the village, for it is a spirited outpouring of
mental and physical energy.</TE>
<TE>   Each house was designed and built by a collegiate team, mainly
architecture and engineering students. The teams, each drawn from
different institutions, had to follow a few basic rules concerning
size (of necessity, very small), height (18 feet, tops) and internal
uses and fixtures (kitchen, bedroom, living-dining area, bathroom,
laundry facilities, home office).</TE>
<TE>   In all other respects, the teams were free to follow their own
inclinations, though costs were a big factor. The figures I heard
most often during visits to the site were $240,000 and $250,000, and
these did not include major equipment donations from local and
national companies or thousands of hours of student labor. Clearly,
fund-raising was a big deal for the past two years in 14 college
towns.</TE>
<TE>   The proof of all this work will come in the testing. Each house
has 32 monitors, measuring things such as the efficiency of
appliances; interior comfort (a constant temperature of 72 degrees is
required); hot water for bathing, laundry and dishwashing; lighting
quality; home business operation; power generation for an electric
car; and overall energy efficiency.</TE>
<TE>   Information from these monitors will be wirelessly fed to a
databank every 15 minutes (and can be checked at
www.solardecathlon.org). At the end of the houses' stay on the Mall,
the one with the highest point total (100 points max per test) will
win the monitored part of the competition. Three other tests,
however, will be judged by humans: graphics and communication,
presentation and simulation, and design quality.</TE>
<TE>   The design test, deservedly, gets a little more weight than the
others: 200 points. "Architecture is just so important," explains
King. "We need the architects of the world to learn about solar
energy and start using it."</TE>
<TE>   Basically, there are two strategic approaches on view on the Mall.
One emphasizes marketability: designing a solar house that looks like
any conventional one. The other stresses a more integrated,
innovative approach: designing a solar house that looks more like the
future than the past.</TE>

<LD>"Today I shall see the world," said Ladybug. She donned her polka-dot
dress and her black bonnet. Then Ladybug left her leaf home and began
to walk.</LD>
<LD>   Soon Ladybug saw Miss Butterfly sitting on a fat yellow bud. Her
wings opened and closed slowly. "Where are you going, Ladybug?" asked
Miss Butterfly.</LD>
<LD>   "To see the world," said Ladybug.</LD>
<TE>   "I'd go too, but I must dry my wings," said Miss Butterfly. "Come
back and tell me all about the world."</TE>
<TE>   "Certainly," said Ladybug. Then Ladybug walked and walked and
walked.</TE>
<TE>   Soon Ladybug came to Brown Beetle, chewing on a tender leaf.
"Where are you going, Ladybug?" asked Brown Beetle.</TE>
<TE>   "To see the world," said Ladybug.</TE>
<TE>   "I always wanted to see the world," said Brown Beetle. "But I am
too hungry to travel. Come back, and tell me all about it."</TE>
<TE>   "Certainly," said Ladybug. Then Ladybug walked and walked and
walked.</TE>
<TE>   Along the way, Ladybug met Small Ant carrying a drop of honeydew.
"Where are you headed, Ladybug?" asked Small Ant.</TE>
<TE>   "To see the world," said Ladybug.</TE>
<TE>   "If I were not busy helping the Aphids," said Small Ant, "I would
go too. Let me know how the world looks."</TE>
<TE>   "Certainly," said Ladybug. Then Ladybug walked and walked and
walked. By evening, she was sure she had walked to the end of the
world. So Ladybug turned around and walked and walked and walked back
to her leaf home.</TE>
<TE>   The next day Ladybug invited Miss Butterfly, Brown Beetle and
Small Ant to come for tea.</TE>
<TE>   "Well, what does the world look like, Ladybug?" they asked.</TE>
<TE>   "The world looks lovely, long and green," said Ladybug. "It was
quite nice except ... "</TE>
<TE>   "Except ... ?" said Miss Butterfly, Brown Beetle and Small Ant
together.</TE>
<TE>   "Except home is where my friends live," said Ladybug. "Home is so
much better."</TE>

<HD>What's in a Name, You Ask? Sometimes It's a Punch Line--or
Two</HD>

<AU>GENE WEINGARTEN</AU>
<BD>WASHINGTON POST</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>I love funny names. I notice them, collect them, remember them. Some
names are funny because they are eerily appropriate to the person or
his occupation, as with the hard-serving tennis pro Anna Smashnova or
the glad-handing, vote-schmoozing Iowa state legislator Steve Sukup,
or Secret Service Agent Jeffrey Undercoffer, or Federal Trade
Commissioner Orson Swindle.</LD>
<LD>   But some names are just plain hilarious on their own, like the
former head of the Washington-area United Way, Oral Suer. (To be
entirely fair to Mr. Suer, I should point out his name is not
pronounced like a waste sluice. It's pronounced "swear," like %&amp;%!)</LD>
<LD>   From time to time, I have seen fit to laugh at names like these,
and each time I receive a letter or two from outraged readers.</LD>
<TE>   Sure, the letter writer is often named something like Orkney
Gruntflaster, but his point is not without merit: People do not
choose their names; ridiculing them is unfair and immature.</TE>
<TE>   I have come to see the wisdom of this. As a public act of
contrition, I decided to apologize to people whom, in my former
immature state, I might well have made fun of.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm just phoning to tell you that I do not find your name even
remotely amusing, Dr. Gesundheit."</TE>
<TE>   Neil Gesundheit is a prominent endocrinologist and professor at
Stanford University's school of medicine.</TE>
<TE>   "You're calling about my name?"</TE>
<TE>   "Yes, but definitely not to make fun of it."</TE>
<TE>   "I've been working on the medical school curriculum here, and when
you said the Washington Post I thought you'd be asking how the new
curriculum is going to be distinctive."</TE>
<TE>   "Yes, in fact, that is much more interesting than your name.
Please tell our readers about your new curriculum, Dr. Gesundheit."</TE>
<TE>   "Each student is not only going to be a physician when he
graduates, but a real scholar in his field of choice."</TE>
<TE>   "Wow!" I said. Dr. Gesundheit sounded pleased.</TE>
<TE>   This catharsis thing seemed to be working. So I called to
apologize to Cantwell Muckenfuss III, another innocent who might
formerly have been a victim of my childish humor. Muckenfuss is a big
muckety- ... I mean a big-shot Washington lawyer, a banking expert
who served under four presidents in the Treasury Department. He goes
by "Chuck." Chuck Muckenfuss. I told him I found his name
interesting, though certainly not comical, and wondered where it came
from, purely as a matter of genealogical curiosity.</TE>
<TE>   "It means something like mosquito foot." "Ha-ha-ha," I observed.</TE>
<TE>   "Yes, I suspect the roots are not aristocratic."</TE>
<TE>   Next I called another lawyer whose name is not funny. New York
City litigator Sue You does mostly defense work, anyway, so where's
the joke? Believe it or not, though, she has heard some snickers over
the years. "I am Miss You, so that can lead to comments," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Eventually, I found myself talking to one of the most prominent
pediatric endocrinologists in America. He has one of these really
grave and wise and dignified doctor voices, rich with age and wisdom
and compassion, a voice that can make a person feel very puny indeed.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Wellington Hung asked why I had called. I tried, but I just
couldn't get it out. Apologized for bothering him.</TE>
<TE>   The conversation left me shaken. Sure, I had changed, but was I
letting myself off too easy? I needed absolution, and there was only
one place to find it--back where I began.</TE>
<TE>   "Dr. Gesundheit, do you feel that someone who finds your name
funny, or might have found your name funny at some more immature
point in his past, is ... a bad person?"</TE>
<TE>   He paused. I braced for the answer.</TE>
<TE>   "No, not necessarily."</TE>
<TE>   God bless you, Dr. Gesundheit.</TE>

<HD>Pastor Shows Bikers Road to Redemption</HD>
<DH>Religion: Richard Fish welcomes leather, tattoos and
Harleys at Simi Valley church he founded after a serious motorcycle
accident.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>AMANDA COVARRUBIAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After a 1997 motorcycle accident left him with a broken back and a
crushed leg, Richard Fish embarked on a new journey.</LD>
<LD>   "I was a mess," said Fish, 38. "I heard the Lord speak to me that
night. He said, 'You're going to be a minister,' and [told me that]
the name of my church would be Live Ride."</LD>
<LD>   Five years later, Fish is an ordained minister with his own
church, located in a Simi Valley strip mall, where leather, tattoos
and Harleys are welcomed.</LD>
<TE>   This is a church where Christian services are held on Saturday, so
they don't conflict with popular Sunday morning ride times. The
atmosphere is come-as-you-are casual--no such thing as "Sunday best"
here. The parking lot is so crowded with black metal and chrome that
passersby often mistake it for some kind of outlaw hangout.</TE>
<TE>   "Some people see all the bikes in the parking lot and think it's a
place where they can score some drugs," said Fish, who has overcome
his own battles with alcohol and drug abuse. "We had one guy come in
with $1,000 in his wallet, ready to buy some [cocaine]. But they come
here and get saved."</TE>
<TE>   The 150-member congregation--mostly bikers--has found a spiritual
home at the church, a close-knit community where people are not
judged and pasts are left behind.</TE>
<TE>   "This church is for square pegs," said parishioner Jim Barros, who
wore a black leather vest, black T-shirt and dark jeans to a recent
service. "It's a hospital for sinners as opposed to a sanctuary for
saints."</TE>
<TE>   The mission of the church is praised by other religious leaders in
Simi Valley.</TE>
<TE>   "Rick [Fish] deals with a type of person all churches want to
reach out to but really don't know how to," said Kevin Dieckilman,
pastor at Simi Hills Christian Church.</TE>
<TE>   "Live Ride crosses both gender and cultural boundaries. There are
people there in suits and ties, as well as bikers. It's one of the
truest examples of what Christ had in mind in building a church and
reaching out to all types of people."</TE>
<TE>   Fish runs the Live Ride Christian Church with his wife, Joye.
Their four children are often in the sanctuary when Fish conducts
Saturday night services in front of a mural depicting two
leather-clad bikers riding into the sunset past a skull-shaped hill
topped with three crosses.</TE>
<TE>   People sway and raise their arms to the music played by the Live
Ride Band, whose bluesy, Christian rock often brings the congregation
to its feet. Some worshipers, including Fish, close their eyes as the
music washes over them.</TE>
<TE>   As the service begins, Fish, wearing a black shirt with red flames
across the bottom, slowly makes his way to the front. During his
sermon, he refers to his life-changing motorcycle accident, using it
as a lesson in how one can be redeemed.</TE>
<TE>   "God grabbed me in the midst of destruction and said, 'I'm going
to save you, and you're going to make an impact on people's lives,' "
Fish said during a service last month. "I was saved from the depths
of fire and you can be, too.</TE>
<TE>   "Some of you backslide," he said. "You let life beat you up and
let the enemy slip under your skin. But it doesn't have to be that
way."</TE>
<TE>   Aside from services, church activities are a mix of the usual and
the slightly offbeat. Live Ride offers Bible study, a youth ministry
and "fellowship rides"--Fish rides with a group of local pastors who
call themselves Bikers of the Cloth.</TE>
<TE>   "We deal with a lot of intimate, personal problems that people
bring to us," Fish said. "Sometimes you need to get away from it all,
and riding is a good release."</TE>
<TE>   Church members said they appreciate the all-accepting atmosphere.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no egos," said Amy Krowpomar, a Newbury Park chef who
regularly attends services with her husband and their two young
children.</TE>
<TE>   Although not a biker herself, Krowpomar said she's always been
attracted to the lifestyle and once worked for Easyriders magazine.
For that reason, she's chosen to worship at Live Ride instead of a
more traditional church.</TE>
<TE>   "It's just one big family," said Krowpomar, who kicked off her
sandals during a recent service and swayed to the music.</TE>
<TE>   Santa Clarita resident Helen Duncan said she attends services
whenever she visits friends in Simi Valley.</TE>
<TE>   "I can lift my hands, do whatever I want. No one cares," Duncan
said. "People who are broken, people with tattoos, or whatever, they
need to feel like they have a place to go."</TE>
<TE>   Church member Jon Klingaman discovered Live Ride nearly two years
ago. Distraught over a broken relationship, Klingaman said he was
driving home one night from an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting, planning
to get his roommate's gun and kill himself.</TE>
<TE>   But Klingaman couldn't get the wheel to turn in the direction of
his apartment and instead steered toward the church.</TE>
<TE>   "The Holy Spirit pulled me in. I said, 'God, what am I doing
here?' I thought this was a biker bar. I was either going to start
drinking again after 11 years of being clean and sober or I was going
to get beaten up. I was scared of bikers because I'm a surfer kind of
guy."</TE>
<TE>   He tentatively walked in the front door.</TE>
<TE>   "Pastor Rick came up to me and gave me a big hug and said,
'Welcome, neighbor, we've been waiting for you," Klingaman said.
"When he did that, I sat down and felt like a 60-pound block of
concrete had been lifted off my shoulders.... I feel like my life was
saved at the 11th hour."</TE>
<TE>   Fish received his degree in church ministry in 1994 at Pacific
Christian College in Fullerton, now Hope International University.</TE>
<TE>   After earning his ministry credential, he became a deacon at the
Christian Church of Thousand Oaks and told elders about his hope of
becoming an ordained minister. The elders agreed to sponsor his
ordination in 1996.</TE>
<TE>   Soon after, he became youth minister at Simi Hills Christian
Church and co-pastor of the fledgling Life Christian Church. His
motorcycle, street smarts and vaguely bad-boy image appealed to young
people.</TE>
<TE>   "I was the coolest youth minister in town," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The pastors at Life Christian held services in members' homes
until they could raise enough money to rent a local dance school for
weekly gatherings. After the accident, Fish broke off from Life
Christian with the blessing of church leaders to start Live Ride.</TE>
<TE>   He poured his insurance settlement money into the ministry and
held services at the dance school. Eventually, he raised enough money
through donations to lease the current space.</TE>
<TE>   Although money was tight, Fish said he never lost sight of his
dreams, working odd jobs until two years ago to make ends meet. Now
he and his family live on his $42,000 pastor's salary. The church's
operating expenses are paid through tithing, offerings and gifts, he
said.</TE>
<TE>   With Live Ride outgrowing its present location, Fish is in the
midst of a fund-raising campaign to purchase larger quarters. He will
soon hold a second service on Saturday nights.</TE>
<TE>   Mark Fisher has been with Fish from the beginning, as front man
for the Live Ride Band. He said people are drawn to Live Ride because
it fills a need unmet by more mainstream churches.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know if it's a fear, because they look a little rough, or
if it's a lack of awareness," said Fisher, safety director for a
plumbing company. "All I know is people love coming to this place. We
provide an atmosphere where people can feel good without fear of
condemnation."</TE>
<TE>   Fish puts it more bluntly.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a church where bikers are welcome, where people drive by
and say, 'That looks like my kind of church.' This is the
come-as-you-are party. But we're serious about God."</TE>

<HD>A Legislative Year That Fit Labor's Bill</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GREGG JONES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>A simple epitaph sums up the 2002 bill-signing season: Labor won big.</LD>
<LD>   That's the conclusion of legislators, lobbyists and other experts
after watching Gov. Gray Davis decide the fate of more than 1,100
bills in September.</LD>
<LD>   Davis turned labor's legislative triumphs into state law by
signing most of the union measures that reached his desk, from
comprehensive paid family leave for most Californians to pay raises
for prison guards. He made national headlines with the family leave
bill, and by granting a form of binding arbitration to unionized farm
workers.</LD>
<TE>   "Labor absolutely was a big winner," said Kent Wong, director of
the Center for Labor Research and Education at UCLA.</TE>
<TE>   In sheer political terms, Davis, who is running for reelection
Nov. 5, shored up his base with the labor measures and legislation
favored by environmental groups, gun-control activists,
abortion-rights advocates and trial lawyers. He also set new curbs on
auto emissions blamed for global warming and supported controversial
stem cell research, again garnering national attention.</TE>
<TE>   "The governor's campaign has caused him to need his friends more
than he's seemed to think he has in the past," said V. John White, a
veteran lobbyist for environmental and renewable-energy causes. "On
both the global warming bill and farm labor bill, he moved faster
than people thought he would move on big issues."</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, demonstrating the political dexterity that has
become a defining trait of the self-described centrist governor,
Davis didn't exactly shun his Republican detractors.</TE>
<TE>   He signed several anti-crime and homeland security measures
applauded by prosecutors, law enforcement agencies and victims'
rights advocates. Among them were a bill by state Sen. Bruce
McPherson (R-Santa Cruz) that prevents criminals from profiting from
their crimes and legislation by state Sen. Jim Brulte (R-Rancho
Cucamonga) that allows authorities to forcibly extract DNA from
prisoners who may have committed other unsolved crimes.</TE>
<TE>   And, after incurring the wrath of the state's $27-billion
agriculture industry and other business interests by signing the farm
labor and paid-leave legislation, Davis handed business four major
victories on the final day of bill signings. Among those was a veto
of Senate Bill 1828 by Senate leader John Burton (D-San Francisco),
which would have given Native American tribes new powers to protect
sacred sites from developers.</TE>
<TE>   "You have winners and losers any time you go through this," said
Jeanne Cain, vice president for government relations at the
California Chamber of Commerce, the state's biggest business group.
"Our losses were big. And our wins were big."</TE>
<TE>   By the reckoning of some members of the Latino caucus, California
Latinos were the biggest losers in the annual bill-signing
sweepstakes that ended at midnight Monday.</TE>
<TE>   For many Latinos, the goodwill the governor generated by signing
the farm worker legislation was lost when he vetoed a pair of
bills--AB 60 and SB 804--that would have given driver's licenses to
illegal immigrants.</TE>
<TE>   Davis killed similar legislation last year and promised to sign
the measure this year if law enforcement concerns were satisfied. The
legislation was the focal point of long and tortuous negotiations
between the governor and Latino legislators this year.</TE>
<TE>   Now, some Latino lawmakers are accusing the governor of bargaining
in bad faith and breaking his promise--charges he rejects.</TE>
<TE>   The list of disappointments for Latino legislators doesn't end
there. Citing severe budget restraints, Davis vetoed a number of
other bills on education, housing and health initiatives aimed at
Latinos.</TE>
<TE>   The Latino caucus responded Friday by denying Davis its
endorsement for reelection.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Davis has his defenders among Latino legislators.</TE>
<TE>   "Overall, I think he's done a pretty good job for the state of
California," said Assemblyman Tony Cardenas (D-Sylmar), a member of
the Latino caucus. "We've had some pretty big constraints the last
couple of years, particularly with the budget deficit and the economy
taking a nose-dive."</TE>
<TE>   He faults Davis for vetoing the driver's license bills but praises
him for signing the farm labor legislation and supporting other
measures important to his constituents. Overall, he gives the
governor a grade of B this year.</TE>
<TE>   Davis' critics say it's no coincidence that unions--the single
biggest source of campaign cash for the Democratic governor--were the
year's biggest winners. Davis signed 16 of the 19 California Labor
Federation-backed bills that reached his desk.</TE>
<TE>   Union leaders say their victories were a triumph for working
Californians, not a tribute to labor's massive political
contributions.</TE>
<TE>   "These are issues that are important to your average family," said
Art Pulaski, secretary general of the federation.</TE>
<TE>   Labor's victories went far beyond the headlines. Unions succeeded
in inserting "prevailing wage" language in dozens of bills on various
issues, in the process nearly scuttling a hard-won overhaul of the
state's construction-defect law and gumming up renewable-energy
legislation sponsored by environmental groups, lobbyists and
legislators said.</TE>
<TE>   Such tactics weren't limited to labor groups and their supporters.
On the eve of the Sept. 11 anniversary, Davis touted a piece of
legislation he signed as a measure aiding families affected by last
year's terrorist attacks. Four paragraphs of the seven-page bill did
just that; the rest of the bill gave trial lawyers, a major
Democratic and Davis constituency, a two-year filing period, rather
than one, for personal injury and wrongful death lawsuits in the
state.</TE>
<TE>   Environmental groups scored their biggest victory in years when
Davis bucked automakers, oil companies and the United Auto Workers by
signing legislation limiting future tailpipe emissions of greenhouse
gases. He also signed major legislation promoting the use of
renewable energy.</TE>
<TE>   Environmental groups didn't get everything they wanted. Davis
sided with Silicon Valley against them when he vetoed a so-called
e-waste bill that would have slapped a $10 fee on the sale of
television sets and computer monitors.</TE>
<TE>   In general, Republicans don't have nice things to say about Davis.
But McPherson, a candidate for lieutenant governor, says he was
personally pleased that Davis signed a number of public safety and
security bills, including the Republican senator's "Son of Sam II"
bill preventing criminals from profiting from their crimes.</TE>
<TE>   He also credits Davis for signing legislation strengthening
technical education and after-school programs. But, like other
Republicans, McPherson castigates Davis for what he describes as the
governor's failure to make the tough budget decisions needed to
"return the state to some fiscal sanity." And he contends that Davis'
love for labor will result in "huge costs placed on business in
California."</TE>
<TE>   Business groups say the impact will vary from industry to
industry.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't see anything that damaged the high-tech industry," said
Cain, the Chamber of Commerce lobbyist, noting that Davis signed nine
bills on the group's annual "job-killer list" and vetoed four. "The
farm community, agricultural community, I think, had some truly
damaging setbacks. The paid family leave and [expansion of the
workers' compensation program earlier this year] will have
significant implications for business, especially small business."</TE>
<TE>   Voters won't pass judgment on Davis' actions for another month.
But the governor had their inclinations in mind as he made his
decisions, experts say.</TE>
<TE>   "Gray Davis is a very cautious politician," said Wong. "He
generally wants to do the right thing. At the same time he's always
looking at the polls and seeing the impact that a piece of
legislation will have on the polls, on his reelection, on his
political career."</TE>
<TE>   Not surprisingly, the winners say the governor ensured his
reelection by signing their bills.</TE>
<TE>   Before, "there wasn't a particular reason for people to say,
'That's my guy', " said labor leader Pulaski. "I think now with these
new actions that Gray Davis has done, he begins to overcome some of
the skepticism. Skepticism is healthy, but now people need to look at
the record, and informed voters will do that."</TE>

<HD>Bratton Takes His Show on the Road</HD>
<DH>Police: Chief-designate keeps up a grueling schedule of
meetings with community groups and sings L.A.'s praises.</DH>

<LD>One thing became clear as William J. Bratton made the rounds of civic
groups and politicians this week as he prepares to take the helm of
the Los Angeles Police Department: He knows how to work a room.</LD>
<LD>   The chief-designate kept up a punishing schedule of public
appearances from Thursday, when his selection was announced, through
Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   And from the moment he touched down, Bratton showed a knack for
the artful compliment and the bold declaration--tempered with a touch
of humility. But when it came to his prescription for the LAPD, he
seemed to pull no punches, criticizing the performance of department
brass and the rank and file, bluntly.</LD>
<TE>   Bratton seemed to strike a chord with audiences by singing L.A.'s
praises in his Boston accent, calling the country's sun-drenched
second-largest metropolis "one of the great cities of the world."</TE>
<TE>   In a nod to West Coast sensibilities, he apologized for the
accent, joked about needing an interpreter, and even promised "to
work on changing that so I can fit more closely into this city." He
explained its origins as Bostonian, with New York nuances.</TE>
<TE>   He repeatedly paired the name of Los Angeles with New York,
calling them "literally the cities of this century."</TE>
<TE>   "Now is the time to get these cities safe," Bratton told
journalists Friday.</TE>
<TE>   At one point, Bratton airily dismissed years of debate over
whether San Fernando Valley residents should secede from Los Angeles,
which voters will decide next month, with a simple question: Why, he
asked, in an incredulous tone, would anyone want to do such a thing?</TE>
<TE>   Everywhere he went, people seemed hungry to hear praise. For some,
it seemed to balance out the jarring East Coast-ness of his speech.</TE>
<TE>   "His accent was very thick," observed Meg Barclay, 28, a public
policy student at USC who attended a Saturday meeting of neighborhood
council members at the Los Angeles Convention Center.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not sure if he lays it on for effect. But he was very
positive about Los Angeles."</TE>
<TE>   Similarly, Ray Covarrubias, a printer, who is on the Lincoln
Heights neighborhood council's steering committee, spoke of Bratton's
"passion for the city," after hearing him speak at Saturday's
meeting.</TE>
<TE>   And Orlando Ward, an associate director of the Midnight Mission
and a member of the Downtown Los Angeles council, walked out a
believer: "He has a level of enthusiasm that holds out hope for us.
It's a new era," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Still, some of those he sought to win over seemed inclined to
withhold judgment, such as a group of Watts residents, most of whom
were black, members of the local police station's community advisory
board.</TE>
<TE>   The meeting was in stark contrast to those of a few months ago,
when black South Los Angeles residents packed standing-room-only
community meetings to voice concern over the ouster of Bratton's
African American predecessor, Bernard C. Parks.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, only a handful turned out to get a glimpse of the
incoming chief. Most of the comments dealt with concerns about new
traffic signals and remedies for other local nuisances.</TE>
<TE>   But Bratton also got his first taste of some of the skepticism
that has long existed toward the LAPD.</TE>
<TE>   "Just how well-informed are you about any of our problems here?"
one woman asked him pointedly.</TE>
<TE>   Bratton's initial response to the question was to tout his
experience with the federal court case mandating LAPD reforms. But
when his audience gazed back at him with impassive stares, he
smoothly switched gears, admitting ignorance and expressing a desire
to learn.</TE>
<TE>   "What I have to learn about the neighborhoods here, I don't
profess to know at all," he told the questioner, who leaned back in
her chair, regarding him.</TE>
<TE>   "Well," she responded archly, "I don't have anything negative to
say, but we will be watching."</TE>
<TE>   Throughout his whirlwind tour, Bratton's message about policing
was consistent--toughness, compassion, professionalism and above all,
change.</TE>
<TE>   There was just one constituency Bratton did not seem to be trying
to please--the existing hierarchy of the Los Angeles police force. In
stop after stop, the LAPD took a drubbing from the chief-apparent.</TE>
<TE>   Although Bratton announced his command staff would be selected
mostly from department veterans, at every turn he found fault with
the department, frequently referring to LAPD's tarnished badge.</TE>
<TE>   He repeatedly stated officers have resisted meeting the promises
made to reform since the LAPD was accused by federal officials of a
pattern of civil rights violations. Bratton has said his service
helping monitor reform over the last year has shaped his perspective.</TE>
<TE>   "Officers are literally--and they admit it--just driving by and
waving," he said at one point Friday.</TE>
<TE>   For those who might resist change, he sent a warning. He referred
pointedly to "overt resistance" to reform within the LAPD, saying it
permeates the department "at all levels, particularly coming from
senior levels."</TE>
<TE>   The comments signaled that Bratton, who has a reputation in
policing circles as a disciplinarian, "is not coming in trying to be
warm and cuddly," said Greg Berg, a former LAPD deputy chief.</TE>
<TE>   Bratton's words also seemed crafted to frame himself as a
turnaround artist. He repeatedly promised to restore the luster of
the department, and create "the most brilliantly shining badge of any
in the United States."</TE>
<TE>   Bratton was liberal in praising allies, and careful to acknowledge
community concerns.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, in a bid to build political momentum, he was
forceful in exhorting the public to back his agenda for the LAPD. Nor
did Bratton neglect the man who picked him, Mayor James K. Hahn,
offering effusive praise for his vision of community policing. He
talked up the rank-and-file cops while a beaming police union
President Mitzi Grasso looked on approvingly.</TE>
<TE>   And in a nod to LAPD history, he talked about the department's
spit-and-polish image from the era of "Dragnet" and "Adam 12."</TE>
<TE>   Bratton visited the Hollenbeck Youth Center in East Los Angeles,
and then before a largely African American crowd Friday--members of
the Los Angeles Urban League at the Westin Bonaventure Hotel in
downtown Los Angeles--he gave a nod to historic black grievances
against the LAPD.</TE>
<TE>   Bratton vowed to run a department that is "of the people, for the
people, and respectful of the people."</TE>
<TE>   He struck the right note, said Don L. Bardo, director of the Los
Angeles Urban League's Pasadena-Foothill Branch. Bardo left the
gathering saying he believes that Bratton will "remove the bad
elements of the LAPD, and that will mean fairness on the streets."</TE>
<TE>   Willie Solomon, 78, a black resident of southeast Los Angeles
succinctly summarized his reaction to Bratton's Saturday appearance:</TE>
<TE>   "We have to give him a chance."</TE>

<HD>Die-Hards' Cry: 'Finally!'</HD>
<DH>Baseball: The Angels eliminate the powerful Yankees,
delighting long-suffering fans. Scores of revelers party in the
parking lot.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KIMI YOSHINO and MIKE ANTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>So this is how it feels.</LD>
<LD>   On a Saturday when the legendary New York Yankees were all too
human, offering up more mistakes than mystique, long-suffering
Anaheim Angels fans exorcised the ghosts of playoff failures past.</LD>
<LD>   And they didn't even need the Rally Monkey to do it.</LD>
<TE>   The Angels win means their first World Series appearance is one
best-of-seven series away. That left fans at Edison International
Field and across Orange County wondering whether this team has been
sprinkled with a little Disney pixie dust.</TE>
<TE>   "I think Gene Autry has come down from heaven and given them the
power," said Gilbert Gonzales, 43, of Ontario, who sat in the right
field stands. "This is the most exciting time of my life."</TE>
<TE>   They stood until their legs were weak. They screamed until their
throats were raw. They hugged and cried and pulled out cell phones to
share a moment when memories are made.</TE>
<TE>   For many, words couldn't describe what they felt.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't describe it," said Jeff Willis, 32, of Rancho Santa
Margarita, who had camped out at the stadium overnight to get his
tickets.</TE>
<TE>   And when he did, it took only one word: "Finally."</TE>
<TE>   Finally, these blue-collar Angels stepped from the shadow of
obscurity and earned the baseball world's respect with heart and
determination, knocking the game's bluebloods back to the Bronx.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's proving a point that the Angels are something to
deal with," said Yiotis Tsarnas, 28, of Orange. "They're finally
going to be recognized."</TE>
<TE>   A three-panel sign made by Lake Forest fans Heather Dwyer and
Bryan Helmick said it all:</TE>
<TE>   "Angels payroll $60 million."</TE>
<TE>   "Yankees payroll $167 million."</TE>
<TE>   "Yankees sent home crying. Priceless."</TE>
<TE>   Those who didn't come prepared to celebrate scrambled to get in on
it. When it became apparent that maybe, just maybe, this October is
for real, a woman offered 27-year-old Brant Houk of Huntington Beach
$75 for his red shirt.</TE>
<TE>   What about $100? he asked.</TE>
<TE>   Houk watched the rest of the game in a tank top.</TE>
<TE>   "I was probably born with a halo on my head and a rattle with an
'A' in my hand," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Scott Brown attended Friday night's game wearing red shoes, red
socks, red shorts, a red shirt and a red cap. The Angels won. On
Saturday, he was back at Edison after only four hours of sleep.</TE>
<TE>   New day, same outfit. Don't mess with success.</TE>
<TE>   "I sleep, drink and eat the Angels," said the 37-year-old
season-ticket holder who works at Home Depot. "I'm taking vacation
this week, but I told them at work I'm not coming back until they
lose. I don't know how much more excited I can be if we get to the
World Series."</TE>
<TE>   A moment of thought brought an answer. "I'll strip my clothes off,
paint myself red and run through the stands naked," Brown said.</TE>
<TE>   In the middle of the eighth inning, police, some on horseback,
took to the field. With each out, the place got louder. With each
Yankee sent packing, the stadium shook.</TE>
<TE>   "We're used to Angels fans being in the closet," said Michael
Beamer, 24, of Brea--one tiny ripple in Edison's sea of red. "This is
like being in the Twilight Zone."</TE>
<TE>   When it was over, after the last high-five had been slapped and
the confetti and streamers had all been launched and landed, some
fans didn't want to leave the stadium.</TE>
<TE>   They hung out in the parking lot long after the last pitch was
thrown.</TE>
<TE>   This was a day to savor.</TE>
<TE>   "Now it is time to collect our bet with the mayor of New York,"
said</TE>
<TE>   Anaheim Mayor Tom Daly, speaking of the Nathan's hot dogs and H&amp;H
Bagels he should soon receive. (Daly had pledged Anaheim oranges and
chiles had he lost.)</TE>
<TE>   "The energy inside that stadium was phenomenal," Daly said. "The
Angels are making Anaheim proud."</TE>

<HD>Bratton Has More Than First and Last Words on the LAPD</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Lopez</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>He speaks without commas and if I were going to tell you about my
first encounter with Los Angeles police chief-in-waiting Bill Bratton
I wouldn't even know where to begin because he talks so fast even I
was out of breath and amazed at his ability to segue onto the subject
of the Renaissance and the future of the American city without ever
completely answering a single question about things like whether the
LAPD is going to have a bigger gang unit and how exactly he's going
to storm the streets and bring down the crime rate immediately and
into eternity without indiscriminately beating people up.</LD>
<LD>   Bill Bratton is the kid you knew in school who could hold his head
underwater for three minutes.</LD>
<LD>   He hasn't even moved here yet and Broadway Bill's already the
biggest star who isn't in the movies, and the former Bostonian also
brings to Los Angeles the only accent we didn't already have.</LD>
<TE>   "Two to one, he ends up hosting the Oscars next spring," says Mike
Barnicle, a Boston and New York newsman who's known Bratton for 30
years.</TE>
<TE>   Only time will tell whether the former New York City police
commissioner, who clashed with Mayor Rudy Giuliani in a war of egos,
can deliver. But we know he can talk. He swaggers into a room chest
first, and although it's a little scary that he keeps talking about
Sgt. Joe Friday's "Dragnet" as if it were real, you have to admire
the confidence of a man who promises results before he's even been
sworn in.</TE>
<TE>   Graffiti?</TE>
<TE>   He's going after it fast and hard and without delay because he
hates it oh he hates it with a passion and even his wife the Court TV
anchor who came along with him to the editorial board meeting hates
it and they went traveling to other cities that were beautiful cities
and they were covered with it.</TE>
<TE>   It has to be eliminated.</TE>
<TE>   The LAPD?</TE>
<TE>   It's an under-performing department and they know it and the
public knows it and all of that is going to come to an immediate halt
as soon as he decentralizes the centralization and takes care of the
training division mess and if there's a cop out there who doesn't get
with the program and realize that assertive policing is about
productivity and activity and creativity (and at least several other
itys) he can send in his retirement papers because guess what folks.</TE>
<TE>   There's a new sheriff in town.</TE>
<TE>   His relationship with the mayor?</TE>
<TE>   They're on a honeymoon and getting along just famously because
first of all they have the same vision for what the Police Department
should be and secondly and of course most importantly you can put the
two of them in a room together and ask a question and Bratton can be
relatively certain that whatever else happens he can bet his badge on
one thing.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn will not interrupt him.</TE>
<TE>   After a half-hour with Bratton my ears were bleeding, and so I
walked across the street to City Hall and sat down with the mayor,
not just to see if he uses earplugs, but to find out how he narrowed
the field to Bratton.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn recalled a moment several months ago, when his search had not
yet begun and Bratton dropped by his office while working as a
monitor of the LAPD.</TE>
<TE>   "I was sitting there," Hahn said, pointing to the sofa, "and he
was sitting there, and he said, 'I know exactly who you need to be
your next police chief, but you'd never hire me.' "</TE>
<TE>   My guess is that Bratton went up to the front of the class in
second grade, told the teacher to take a break, and never let her
back in the room.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn said he gave Bratton big points for doing his homework,
cobbling together a detailed plan, and making it clear he badly
wanted the job.</TE>
<TE>   As for Bratton's Jupiter-sized ego, Hahn could only see it working
to the city's advantage. When it comes to the two main goals they
share--reducing crime and advancing the reform of the
department--Bratton does not intend to fail.</TE>
<TE>   But was Hahn at all worried that Bratton only intends to be here
long enough to get his own star on Hollywood Boulevard, or that he'll
use too much rough stuff on the streets to get results?</TE>
<TE>   You're bound to be a star as chief of the second-largest city in
America, Hahn said. "Bernard Parks was one of the 50 sexiest men" in
America, according to People magazine.</TE>
<TE>   As for the rough stuff, he said, he pressed Bratton on how he
intended to implement his so-called assertive policing philosophy
without going too far. Bratton said, among other things, that he
would get the community's "authorization," meaning he would bring
law-abiding citizens in on the deal.</TE>
<TE>   We'll see. It isn't going to be easy in a vast city-nation, with
only 9,000 officers as compared to New York's 40,000. And Bratton's
success in New York can be attributed in large part to a strong
national economy that also dropped the crime rate in many cities.</TE>
<TE>   But Bratton already has L.A. cops buzzing, some out of fear
they'll have to get out of the office and work, and some out of
respect. One lieutenant told me Bratton was the first LAPD chief in a
while who seems to like cops.</TE>
<TE>   "I am very certain I made the right decision," Hahn said.</TE>
<TE>   But not as certain as the man who speaks without commas and might
already have made several arrests just for the exercise because he's
a professional who's done the job wherever he's gone and does not
intend to be parked behind a Vegas buffet table like Willie Williams
or locked in his office like Bernie Parks and if anyone has any
doubts that Bratton invented modern police science here's the
shortest quote I have from him in my entire notebook:</TE>
<TE>   "It's what I do. I'm very good at it."</TE>

<HD>Logjam of Cargo Ships Grows Off Coast as Port Talks Drag On</HD>
<DH>Labor: As the longshore lockout approaches its second week,
a deal is reached to allow critical cargo deliveries to Alaska and
Hawaii.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ABIGAIL GOLDMAN and NANCY CLEELAND</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The high-stakes battle of wills that has closed all commercial West
Coast ports, causing billions of dollars in economic losses,
continued Saturday, with little progress on key contract issues.</LD>
<LD>   As a federal mediator shuttled between negotiators for the
longshore union and port employers in a San Francisco hotel, a deal
was forged allowing crucial shipments to Alaska and Hawaii. Both
states rely heavily on imports for daily necessities. But most ports
remained silent, and dozens of container vessels carrying food,
garments, electronics and other imports joined the growing logjam off
the coast.</LD>
<LD>   The Bush administration issued its strongest statement to date on
the lockout, calling on both parties to "go back to work and resolve
the problems." But White House spokesman Ari Fleischer declined to
say whether Bush was considering federal intervention, which has been
urged by a growing number of business and political leaders.</LD>
<TE>   "The president's message to labor and management is simple: You're
hurting the economy. You are hurting your fellow workers and unions
in other parts of the country, whose jobs depend on the products you
ship," he told reporters in New Hampshire, where the president was
attending a political fund-raiser. "People in the rest of the
country, who depend on the products that your ports provide, are
starting to suffer setbacks."</TE>
<TE>   Robin Lanier, director of the West Coast Waterfront Coalition,
which represents retailers and manufacturers who use the ports, said
her group was "extremely disappointed" in the administration. "When
we are going to have virtually all factories in the U.S. closed down
by this, it's not enough to have your press guy read the riot act to
both sides," she said. "This statement that was made by the press
secretary should have been made many days ago, so it really looks
like too little too late."</TE>
<TE>   The Pacific Maritime Assn., which represents shipping lines and
terminal operators, closed the ports last Sunday after a series of
worker slowdowns. It said it would reopen the ports only if the union
signed a new contract or agreed to extend the old one, which would
prevent workers from staging disruptions.</TE>
<TE>   But a contract extension "will never happen," said an
International Longshore and Warehouse Union spokesman, Steve
Stallone. He said union leaders were pleased to see "cracks"
appearing in the shutdown, referring to the exceptions granted for
Alaska and Hawaii, and were pushing for further exceptions for
perishable produce and grains.</TE>
<TE>   The union and shipping group have been in contract negotiations
for nearly five months. Talks bogged down on the employers' desire to
introduce labor-saving technology, such as scanners, remote cameras
and electronic tracking devices. The union says it will allow such
technology only if it is guaranteed control of the information and
jurisdiction over all related jobs. In addition, the union wants to
control planning jobs that are crucial to the flow of goods through
the ports. "If they want technology, they have to give on
jurisdiction," said a union officer who asked not to be identified.</TE>
<TE>   Both sides consider the outcome of the dispute, which involves
only about 100 jobs, to be key to their futures. Negotiations, which
were expected to continue until midnight Saturday, were set to resume
today. "We're at the table. We're continuing to negotiate. We expect
to negotiate late into the night," said Steve Sugerman, a spokesman
for the shipping group. "We are working hard to get a deal."</TE>
<TE>   The ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach were quickly filling up.
At midday Saturday there were 107 cargo ships scattered in the
harbors and off Huntington and Newport beaches. Capt. Dick McKenna,
deputy director of the Marine Exchange, said 40 more vessels were
expected by the end of Monday. "We are approaching our limits," he
said. "For a while, it looked as if everything was going to
stabilize, but then the numbers took off again."</TE>
<TE>   In a statement released late Friday night, Labor Secretary Elaine
L. Chao urged both sides to settle the dispute. "The continued
closure of the ports on the West Coast is having effects beyond the
immediate parties," Chao said. "Both management and the union should
recognize that workers, farmers and consumers are paying a price for
this continued impasse.</TE>
<TE>   Businesses across the country watched the clock nervously as the
impasse approached its second week. If the dispute is not settled
soon, growers face the ruin of their produce. Sellers of toys and
clothing predicted bare shelves and plummeting holiday profits.</TE>
<TE>   Many retailers, including Gap, Best Buy, Williams-Sonoma and
others, said they had contingency plans for at least part of their
imports, including the rerouting of some shipments to the East Coast
and, at much higher costs, sending critical merchandise by air
freight.</TE>
<TE>   But the nation's largest retailer and No. 1 importer of goods,
Wal-Mart Stores Inc., said it has few alternatives to waiting for the
ports to reopen, because the company's enormous loads make other
shipping methods impractical. Although Wal-Mart has already received
most of its holiday merchandise, company executives said the stores
depend on a constant flow of goods, which the company splits almost
evenly between East Coast and West Coast ports.</TE>
<TE>   "All the ships that are planned to the East Coast are full with
planned cargo. There is no additional capacity," said Tim Yatsko,
Wal-Mart's vice president of direct imports. "Air cargo is not an
option for us with the volume we do. And the air capacity, just like
ships, is pretty tight right now."</TE>
<TE>   In a letter last week to the Bush administration requesting
immediate intervention, one retail trade organization said the quick
processing of toys, consumer electronics, shoes, clothing and
housewares is becoming critical.</TE>
<TE>   "With the retail industry and consumer spending largely propping
up a weak economy, the inability to get goods off the ships will
quickly result in idling of distribution centers, closure of stores
and layoffs of workers," wrote Tracy Mullin, president of the
National Retail Federation. "U.S. consumers will also quickly see an
impact, as goods become unavailable and prices rise."</TE>
<TE>   One study estimated economic losses from the shutdown at $1
billion a day, with costs snowballing the longer the ports remain
closed because of the ripple effect on the economy. A study
commissioned by the Pacific Maritime Assn. said a 10-day shutdown
would cost the U.S. economy nearly $20 billion.</TE>

<HD>A Sense of Place</HD>
<DH>Unlike older cities, L.A. remains resolutely enigmatic,
daring each of us to create and recreate the city inside us.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LEO BRAUDY</AU>
<BD>Leo Braudy holds the position of University Professor
at USC and is the author of "The Frenzy of Renown: Fame and its
History."</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I like cities. I like their ins and outs, their odd corners, their
ghostly overlays of past and present, like a living, breathing
archeological dig.</LD>
<LD>   During the years I lived in New York, Baltimore, Paris and Rome,
it was easy to see myself in the old image of a city dweller. I was
the flaneur, the stroller of boulevards, the "Walker in the City" (as
the title of Alfred Kazin's 1951 book on New York put it)--making my
way through the crowds, jauntily observing the scene.</LD>
<LD>   Now I live in Los Angeles, where city means something else. In
Paris or New York, a tour of the monuments--the Eiffel Tower, Central
Park, Notre Dame, St. Patrick's Cathedral--is in some sense a tour of
the city. But show people the Getty, the new Moneo cathedral and the
rising Disney Hall, and what do they know about L.A.?</LD>
<TE>   This is not a place of famous landmarks and historic squares.
Instead of such easily mappable concentrations, L.A. is a scattering
of riches, where a wrong turn or a detour on purpose can discover a
whole new world, a neighborhood where the fairway trees are coated in
tinfoil for Christmas, or a fine restaurant glowing unobtrusively in
a seedy strip mall. In other places, I lived in the city. But
ultimately, L.A. is the city in me, the city I weave together for
myself out of the wealth of materials it provides, a fabric that
constantly changes from year to year.</TE>
<TE>   When I first moved here almost 20 years ago, I wanted to get my
bearings, and so I learned the freeways, the city's skeleton. But
like a skeleton, the city I got to know had a bloodless feel. The
freeways get us around, but they divide up the whole.</TE>
<TE>   Now we're being told by secession promoters that we should follow
the logic of the freeways and carve the body of L.A. up into even
more self-involved fragments. Perhaps, instead, each of us could try
at least once a week to get out of our narrow day-to-day arteries and
explore the messy, unmanageable, wonderful whole. Drive on surface
streets and get lost on purpose. Follow odd avenues and enter
neighborhoods just to see what they are like and how they form the
real veins, muscle and flesh of the city.</TE>
<TE>   If you have no idea where to begin, I have developed a tour of
sorts that I give to visitors. If you can't grasp why the city should
remain whole, perhaps you should take it.</TE>
<TE>   We will start--selfishly, because I live nearby in Los Feliz--at
the Griffith Observatory, a good place to satisfy the cliche-seekers
eager to see the Hollywood sign. Here, rather than existing as a
detached icon, it is set in its proper context, with Hollywood, the
Baldwin Hills, Palos Verdes, the beach, and Catalina (on a clear day)
sprawling out to the south and west. From there, we head down through
Fern Dell, with its Gabrielino spring (now a water fountain)--a handy
symbol of the importance of water in creating the city we just gazed
upon, as well as a reminder of the native tribes that were here
before the first settlers came.</TE>
<TE>   Water especially transformed the Valley, and part of its story
could be traced down Los Feliz Boulevard, past the Mulholland
Fountain, to the L.A. River, whose sandy bottom here somehow escaped
the attention of the Army Corps of Engineers and its concrete mixers.
Following the river north to the Valley, we pass the Ferraro Soccer
grounds where the De Anza party camped in 1776 on the way to San
Jose. Here, past the zoo and the Autry Museum, the river turns west
toward an even more bucolic life in the Sepulveda Basin, but we might
continue north to the Mission San Fernando--founded not many years
later--where the Valley got its name.</TE>
<TE>   So much of that California past still exists in Los Angeles on
both sides of the mountains. But the more familiar influence on the
image of L.A. past and present is the film industry, and its own
shrines dot the landscape. Back in Los Feliz and Hollywood, on busy
Franklin Avenue near the 101 overpass, we look up at the Alto Nido,
where Billy Wilder housed the heroes of both "Double Indemnity" and
"Sunset Boulevard." On nearby Ivar is the apartment house where
Nathanael West spent time as the manager to help pay the rent while
he contemplated writing "The Day of the Locust."</TE>
<TE>   Of course, the locations have changed since their glory days. The
Cansino Dance Studio, where Rita Hayworth, nee Margarita Cansino,
learned her steps as a girl, is now a gift shop, having also been
over the years a check-cashing agency and a distressed furniture
store called Nostalgia, L.A. A few miles away in Silver Lake, the
sets for D.W. Griffith's "Intolerance," which languished for years at
the corner of Sunset and Hollywood, have disappeared. But his old
sound stage is now part of the flamenco restaurant El Cid.</TE>
<TE>   If some of the city's residents came to pursue the fleeting
illusions of film, others have come in search of deeper truths. North
of Franklin Avenue is the Hindu temple, where in the 1940s
Christopher Isherwood and Aldous Huxley explored Vedanta with Swami
Prabhavananda. On Glendale Boulevard, across the street from Echo
Park, is the Angelus Temple where evangelist Aimee Semple McPherson
preached her Foursquare gospel in the 1920s. The congregation is now
predominantly Korean, but you can still get postcards of Sister Aimee
in the gift shop.</TE>
<TE>   Crucial to the creation of the city from the beginning were the
migrations--of white Midwesterners, of blacks from the rural South,
of Mexicans along with Central and South Americans, and of Asians
from the Pacific Rim. There's always Olvera Street or Chinatown for
dipping a toe in the waters of immigration, but I prefer to drive
downtown along Broadway to experience one of the most dynamic urban
shopping streets in America--and home of a great place to stop for
lunch, the Grand Central Market.</TE>
<TE>   Just beyond downtown, on the other side of the 5 Freeway, across
Art Deco bridges built when the Army Corps started paving the sides
and bottom of the L.A. River, is Boyle Heights, where Sunset
Boulevard turns into Cesar E. Chavez Avenue. Now a vibrant Latino
neighborhood sporting numerous examples of that indigenous L.A. art
form, the wall mural, Boyle Heights is also part of the history of
Jews, African Americans, and Japanese Americans in Los Angeles. In
the early 1940s, the Japanese inhabitants here were moved to
relocation camps in the scrub near Lone Pine. A year or so later, the
Zoot Suit riots marked another sorry chapter in the history of local
racism.</TE>
<TE>   Next up on the tour are Simon Rodia's improbable Watts Towers,
which embody as much as anything can the kind of eccentric creative
vision that helped to shape the city. On the way back, we drive up
Central Avenue, the heart of the South-Central jazz scene in the '40s
and rock 'n' roll in the '50s. Then we could jog west to Phillip's
Barbecue in Leimert Park for some takeout to eat in the renovated
park, or sit down at the counter of Stevie's on the Strip for a
Cajun-style oyster loaf sandwich.</TE>
<TE>   It's been a long day, but it's a big city, filled with variety and
unexpected pleasures. Even so, my tour is incomplete, a mere
smattering of the city's offerings. It's one of a hundred, a thousand
tours you could take. But it suggests, I hope, something about what
holds Los Angeles together, what makes it unique.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike older cities, which impose their pasts upon us, L.A.
remains resolutely enigmatic, daring each of us to make our own
stories of its multiplicity, to create and recreate the city inside
us. L.A.'s widespread corners and the personal realities of its
inhabitants certainly cause trouble when people get together to solve
real political and economic problems. But the act of creative
imagination that living here demands can, if well nourished, become
the source of the energy and innovation needed to get those things
done.</TE>

<KH>IRAQ</KH>
<HD>A Remedy That Harms More Than It Heals</HD>
<DH>War would devastate the innocent. Change is needed, but it
must come from within.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HAIFA ZANGANA</AU>
<BD>Haifa Zangana is an Iraqi British novelist.</BD>
<DL>LONDON</DL>
<LD>I believe Saddam Hussein is responsible for leading Iraq from a
situation of great promise into one of unmitigated catastrophe. I
believe he must be held to account for the country's abject failure
and for the crimes his regime committed against the Iraqi people,
against Arabs and Kurds alike.</LD>
<LD>   But I do not believe the U.S. and British-led war now being
contemplated will benefit Iraq.</LD>
<LD>   I say this as someone who knows firsthand how bad things are for
Iraqis under Baath Party rule. In August 1971, when I was in my third
year of pharmacy school at Baghdad University, Hussein had not yet
come to power, but his party had. Its excesses were legion. I had
taken the risk of joining a radical opposition party that advocated
such things as developing the Iraqi national economy, granting
popular freedoms, freeing all political prisoners and securing
self-rule for Iraqi Kurdistan.</LD>
<TE>   Inevitably, my political activities came to the attention of the
regime, and one day I returned home to find security officers waiting
for me. They arrested me and drove me to Qasir Al Nihaya, a political
detention center, where I was forced to stand naked in the middle of
a room in front of four men. A man sitting behind a desk was clearly
in charge, although he did not say much. He was of medium height with
dark skin and wore sunglasses with gold rims. He had a dark suit on
and fingered a rosary, which held his attention when he wasn't
looking at me.</TE>
<TE>   Another of the men circled me. Then he touched me. I could hear
the laughter of the others. He began beating me and kicking me in the
groin. Soon, I was wet with blood and urine. He kicked me again in
the head and then stopped.</TE>
<TE>   I was held in prison for months. Everything around me emphasized
what seemed like inevitable death. They brought in my friends, one by
one, and I saw their tortured bodies and the same strange emptiness
in their eyes. In January 1972, three of my friends were executed.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, I was released, in part, perhaps, because the Baath
regime was trying to polish its image internationally, and executing
a young women was unlikely to help. More important to my getting out,
in all probability, was that I had an influential relative: Sabah
Mirza, Hussein's friend during his college years and later his most
faithful bodyguard (although he is currently under house arrest).</TE>
<TE>   After my release, I remained imprisoned by my memories. I could
still hear human howling and see the bodies of the dead. Fearful of
further violence, I fled Iraq on a false passport and settled in
London where, 15 years later, I wrote an autobiographical novel,
"Through Vast Halls of Memory." Even today I am burdened--as are
other friends who survived--with the guilt of being alive.</TE>
<TE>   Now I watch as my adopted country prepares to join the United
States in a war it says will liberate the Iraqi people from Hussein's
dictatorial regime, establish democracy and save the world from
weapons of mass destruction. These are all things I believe in
fervently, but I am horrified by the wrongheadedness of what I see
unfolding.</TE>
<TE>   The Iraqi people's experience of U.S. interest in their country
has not been positive. When 5,000 Kurds were massacred in Halabja in
1988, the U.S. did nothing--other than continue cozying up to
Hussein, whom it viewed as an important counterweight to Iran. There
was no war on Iraq to defend the Kurds. There was no U.N. resolution
to condemn the atrocity.</TE>
<TE>   A couple of years after Halabja, though, when the Iraqi regime
occupied Kuwait--an important oil producer and former ally of Hussein
in his war against Iran--the U.S. leapt into action. The trouble was,
the 1991 war on Iraq was really a war on the Iraqi people, who were
Hussein's primary victims.</TE>
<TE>   For 43 days, the attack was constant. Bombs rained down on water
purification plants and pumping stations, on electrical power
stations and oil refineries, on warehouses that stored seeds and
animal vaccines. Three of Baghdad's historic bridges were destroyed.
On the road to Basra, thousands of retreating soldiers were killed,
most of them conscripts.</TE>
<TE>   The terror for average Iraqis didn't stop with the cease-fire.
Children who went through the siege continued to be terrified by loud
noises. Newlywed women refused to have children for fear of giving
birth to deformed babies resulting from the depleted uranium
ammunition used by British and U.S. troops.</TE>
<TE>   And there was great bitterness toward the U.S. A month into the
war, on Feb. 15, 1991, the first President Bush called on the Iraqi
people "to take matters into their own hands and force the dictator
to step aside." Many Iraqis answered the appeal, only to see the U.S.
agree to a cease-fire that left Hussein in place.</TE>
<TE>   Then came the sanctions, which have been catastrophic for ordinary
people. Instead of the old way of buying and selling food in a free
market, the Iraqi government has created a massive food-distribution
program that makes citizens more dependent than ever on the regime.
Most Iraqis are allocated a monthly ration, which includes basic food
supplies like tea, sugar, cooking oil and rice. And it is never
enough. A friend in Iraq, an accountant, recently wrote to me: "If
you can put aside [$15] monthly and send me [$45] every three months,
you'll save my life." Another friend wrote, "All we think about is
food. Praise be to God for this miserable life which doesn't give us
enough to eat. And do we dare think about tomorrow? Will we be able
to survive, or will we just continue to suffer the same humiliation?"</TE>
<TE>   The all-encompassing sanctions included such things as medical
journals, scientific research papers, books and, until 1996, erasers,
sharpeners and pens. UNICEF reported that the child mortality rate
more than doubled in the years after the war, which meant an
additional half-million children dying. Letters coming out of Iraq
often include some version of this question: Why are we punished for
the crimes of our persecutor?</TE>
<TE>   And it isn't just the sanctions: The bombing of Iraq has never
stopped and has killed hundreds of civilians. The Bush administration
is adamant that war is the only way to change the "evil regime" in
Iraq. But another war will crush a vulnerable society and increase
the suffering of the Iraqis. A remedy is not a remedy if it causes
greater damage to the innocent.</TE>
<TE>   Change is certainly needed in Iraq, but it must be initiated from
inside Iraq by its own people--not imposed by the U.S. or Britain.
The best way to help the Iraqi people would be to lift the sanctions
and end the paralyzing bombardment and daily threat of war. Once the
people of Iraq have a chance to regain their strength and dignity,
they will be quite capable of changing the oppressive regime--and
they will do it in a way that serves the country better than if the
U.S. is calling the shots about the next government.</TE>
<TE>   Among the most disturbing aspects of the current crisis is that
the U.S. seems to see the Iraqi National Congress as the future of
democracy in Iraq. The group, set up in the early 1990s with CIA help
and now funded by the State Department, does not have the support of
most Iraqis, and its rhetoric is chilling. In an editorial published
in the group's mouthpiece, Al-Mutamar, last month, the editor in
chief recounted an interview he gave recently to German TV. "I was
asked about the [resistance] of some groups in the Iraqi opposition
to the expected regime change," he wrote. "I said: First of all, they
are not groups, they are individuals. They know that they are only
free and alive as long as Saddam is alive.... They are living an
illusion. None of them will be able to go back to Iraq. [If] finally
we do meet those scoundrels in Baghdad, we'll ... [have them brought]
back, hands and feet in chains, heads bowed, eyes downcast."</TE>
<TE>   If this is the vision the U.S. has for Iraq, then the future is
bleak, indeed.</TE>

boulevards, Bishop Stephan Hoeller has presided since 1977 at
Ecclesia Gnostica, the tiny, incense-infused chapel of the Gnostic
Society. Gnosticism, an ancient form of Christianity that flourished
in the 1st to 3rd centuries, rejects doctrines such as original sin
and emphasizes transcendence through inward, intuitive knowledge
("gnosis") of the divine spark in each individual. Condemned as
heresy by early Roman Catholic authorities, gnosticism has drawn
renewed interest in recent decades thanks in part to the writings of
Carl Jung and religious scholar Elaine Pagels. Hoeller, 70, a
Hungarian emigre whose parish extends to Portland and Salt Lake City,
recently published "Gnosticism: New Light on the Ancient Tradition of
Inner Knowing" (Quest Books).</LD>
<LD>   Where exactly do mainstream Christians and Gnostics part ways?</LD>
<LD>   Where it comes to what is considered salvific, or what saves. We
don't proselytize. There's no belief that coming to us you'll be
immediately saved and by not coming to us that you'll be lost.
Gnosticism has often been described as "salvation through knowledge,"
but Gnosis doesn't mean knowledge of particular data. Rather, it's an
inner "knowingness," a change of consciousness. Salvation through the
death and suffering of Jesus is not part of our thought.</LD>
<TE>   What is the place of Jesus in Gnostic tradition?</TE>
<TE>   The Gnostics have held that there are always messengers of light
who come from the inner worlds as archetypes of transformation,
though many feel that Jesus was perhaps the latest and the greatest
of these. However, you'll have no difficulty finding experiences
resembling gnosis within other religious contexts--the samadhi of the
yogis, the nirvana of the Buddhists, satori within Zen Buddhism.</TE>
<TE>   How would you explain the revived interest in gnostic thought?</TE>
<TE>   I believe there are two reasons for this. The first is the
so-called Nag Hammadi Library [1,500-year-old papyrus codices found
in Egypt in 1945], the largest body of original Gnostic literature
ever discovered. It was translated into English in the mid '70s,
giving us a more accurate look than we'd had through hostile
secondhand sources. This allowed people to see that gnosticism is
really far less bizarre and marginal than has been assumed. The
second issue is a certain harmony between this material and modern
and postmodern thinking. Some of these convergences occur within the
depth psychology of Carl Jung. I also believe we are beginning to
find echoes of Gnostic philosophy within the study of chaos theory or
the approach of deconstructive thinkers.</TE>
<TE>   Is Los Angeles "Gnostic-friendly"?</TE>
<TE>   When I came from Hungary, I had a kind of poetic intuition that
the city was re-embodiment of the cultural and spiritual diversity of
ancient Alexandria where the Gnostics, the Neo-Platonists and all
these old boys were. America enjoys exceptional religious freedom,
particularly among those who have migrated to the West Coast and no
longer feel compelled to simply follow the faith of their parents.</TE>
<TE>   Gnosticism was mentioned in some discussions of the 1997 Heaven's
Gate cultist suicides in Rancho Santa Fe. Can you comment on that?</TE>
<TE>   People in the press and even some scholars jumped to the
unjustified conclusion that because Gnostics feel earthly life is a
relatively lowly condition, they are therefore disposed toward
religiously motivated suicide. But nowhere in our tradition do we
find any indication of this. We believe in overcoming the darkness,
not plunging into it.</TE>
<TE>   How does a Gnostic transcend worldly entanglements?</TE>
<TE>   It's sort of what our Buddhist friend Alan Watts called "the
shifting of the psychological point of gravity." Gnostics aren't
exhorted to embrace poverty or chastity or vegetarianism. We look
inward, but don't deny the outer world. We can smell the
flowers--maybe even pick a few along the way. But we must keep
walking.</TE>
<TE>   Where does Gnosticism fall in with the New Age movement?</TE>
<TE>   New Agers are very much "in denial" of the dark side, and the
Gnostics not at all. We feel that we must recognize both dark and
light.</TE>
<TE>   Have you personally ever been called a heretic?</TE>
<TE>   Not since my youth. When I'd have the occasional dispute with
Catholic clergy and fellow students, I'd hear, "Ah, there goes
Hoeller the heretic." Even then it was rather jocular.</TE>

<DH>How Did the Carousel of Hope Become the Superlative-Buster
on L.A.'s Charity Circuit? It's Hard to Say No to Barbara Davis.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The commander stands in her silver chanel ballet slippers and surveys
the battlefield.</LD>
<LD>   Out there, it is still quiet and dark and empty.</LD>
<LD>   The first skirmishes will commence just past sunset on Oct. 15.
The battlefield will be brilliant with explosions of light, and
clamorous with the roar of large-caliber buzz. Halle Berry, Sting,
Sidney Poitier, Oprah Winfrey and Elton John will reach the front
lines through a glitzkrieg gantlet of paparazzi. Elizabeth Taylor has
promised to reenlist.</LD>
<TE>   The struggle for field position will be hand-to-hand; important
people have been known to send their assistants sneaking onto the
battlefield to switch the numbers on tables to get their superiors
closer to the action.</TE>
<TE>   All this the commander knows, for she has waged this campaign 14
times before. The war zone is the ballroom of the Beverly Hilton
Hotel; her weapon, the Carousel of Hope Ball; her fight, against
juvenile diabetes.</TE>
<TE>   This ball of hers is the superlative-buster, the 800-pounder on
the charity calendar, the biggest, richest, puttin'-on-the-ritziest,
arguably the most successful and longest-running good-deed society
event in town--so large and lavish that it's only given every other
year, lest the charity tap get tapped dry.</TE>
<TE>   In mainline Old Hollywood and some of what remains of mainline old
money in Los Angeles, the Carousel of Hope ball is referred to glibly
as the Oscar night of its ilk. It's a facile phrase but not a very
precise one, the differences being of kind as well as degree. Case in
point: Women who go to the Oscars may borrow their jewels,
Cinderella-like, from the vaults of Van Cleef &amp; Arpels or Fred
Leighton; women who go to the Carousel Ball open their safes and wear
their own. And to put it baldly, a lot of the people who go to the
Oscars are the hired help--exalted, but hired. The people at the
Carousel Ball often are or have been their bosses. And where the
Oscars are essentially a high-wattage office party, over time the
chairs at the Carousel of Hope have been filled by players who may
only encounter one another because Barbara Davis got them to say
''yes'': Fergie, the Duchess of York, presidents Ford and Reagan,
Wayne Gretzky, Hillary Rodham Clinton, Oliver Stone, Patty Hearst,
Ted Kennedy.</TE>
<TE>   The supreme commander of all this is a trim woman of 71, perhaps
the last grande dame hostess in Los Angeles. Barbara Davis has been
married for 51 years to Marvin Davis, a Denver oil billionaire who
bought 20th Century Fox Studios in 1981. His wife was an unstoppable
Molly Brown, airdropped out of Denver and onto the top of the
Hollywood heap. The first party she threw here was a little do for
the Queen of England, on Sound Stage 9 of her husband's movie studio,
a celebfest for which Davis hired some of the same party hands--the
valet parking company, the party-rentals firm--that she still uses
nearly 20 years later.</TE>
<TE>   She is the mother of five, the grandmother of 14, and up close has
a chivvyingly fond, motherly manner to her. Lunching with her, you
just know that if you had trouble wrangling a bit of food on your
plate, she would cheerily lean over and cut it up for you. But it's
the mom-in-field-marshal mode that explains why Barbara Davis' ball
goes on and on, where other charity events may soar and then sink.</TE>
<TE>   Her film-producer son, John Davis, says she is ''a mother on a
mission ... She's got a velvet glove with an iron fist underneath.''
That she goes about it carrying a pale blue, four-figure Hermes Kelly
bag clenched in a hand glittering with a band of brilliant-white
first-water diamonds makes it no less a crusade.</TE>
<TE>   Marvin Davis was a Denver oil gajillionaire in the 1970s when the
youngest of the Davises' five children, 7-year-old Dana, was
diagnosed with juvenile diabetes. ''Fix it,'' said Marvin, with a
rich man's certainty. When he found it couldn't just be ''fixed,'' he
gave his wife a million dollars--the first of many millions he'd
give, as it turned out--to start a hospital to get about fixing it.</TE>
<TE>   A quarter-century later, there is the Barbara Davis Center for
Childhood Diabetes in Denver, where more than 25 doctors treat 4,000
children and their families each year. Some of the children are flown
in gratis from as far off as Chile and are treated for free. To
support the center's work and research for a cure, there is the
Children's Diabetes Foundation.</TE>
<TE>   In 25 years, more than $60 million has found its way to the
foundation and a few other diabetes groups. Perhaps $20 million of
that is from Marvin Davis' own pockets. Most of the rest is the box
office from the Carousel Ball, the ticket sales and objets de luxe
that movie stars and auto dealers and jewelers have parted with to
help Barbara Davis' cause, and also, conveniently, their own cause:
to keep their names or their goods in the papers and themselves on
the right guest lists.</TE>
<TE>   The first ball, in Denver, raised all of $210,000. To inject a
frisson into that first event, Davis ducked into a Denver jeweler and
bought a gold Rolex, ''which I thought at the time was the biggest
deal in the whole world.'' That night, Lucille Ball's husband, Gary
Morton, held up the watch to auction it off. Nobody bid. Undaunted,
he kept raising the ante, pointing at nonexistent bidders, faking
like mad and ending up buying the watch himself.</TE>
<TE>   These days the auction offers nearly 500 items worth more than
$1.5 million: an hour one-on-one with Shaquille O'Neal, opening bid
$25,000; a work by artist Julian Schnabel, opening bid $10,300; a
$75,000 Cadillac XLR; a gift-certificate dinner in Vail, on the
presumption that you can get there on your own and frequently do.
There are items that Davis has turned down--chiefly on grounds of
taste, most memorably a divorce package from a high-priced
attorney--but not many.</TE>
<TE>   Her work succeeds, she says, ''because it matters to me. It's not
just a charity, it's not just an event, it's my child's life, it's
the life of so many other people like her.''</TE>
<TE>   Like a Rose Parade, the ball takes a year to pull off, which is
one reason it's biennial. Davis also doesn't like putting the touch
on people every single year. And there's a third reason, says her son
John: ''I think my father would tell you he's endured 12 years of her
up late at night, sitting next to him, talking on the phone, working
on the ball, working on the center or raising money, and he says it
gets especially tense at times. About now, he doesn't have a chance
to get a word in edgewise with her.''</TE>
<TE>   Over the months, elements click slowly into place like the
tumblers of a Mosler safe. Snagging a big entertainer comes early;
that one magical name may be the jewel-like pebble that unleashes the
avalanche of acceptances. And if Star A knows Star B is coming, Star
A will make sure to be there--out of comradeship or competition, it
doesn't matter, just as long as the check clears.</TE>
<TE>   All this Davis finesses with ''such polite and charming steel.''
So says her admirer and friend of decades' standing, Merv Griffin,
who emceed several Carousel Balls and is hosting this one. He stands
first and perhaps most consistently generous among the ranks of her
volunteers, for he gives her the use of his Beverly Hilton Hotel and
underwrites some of the gala. (This means Davis has two of the city's
richest men in her corner: the L.A. Business Journal puts Davis at
No. 2 in L.A.'s top 50, with $6.4 billion, and Griffin at No. 20,
with $1.2 billion.)</TE>
<TE>   Griffin has seen her in Carousel Ball mode: ''Suddenly a very firm
look comes on her face and she says, 'That's the way I want it,' and
she's always right. If Barbara hadn't been what she is today, the
great hostess of Beverly Hills, she would have been some kind of a
producer.'' Or a great politician, or telemarketer. If Barbara Davis
is calling you for a favor, or to thank you for one, odds are it is
Davis on the phone, not some aide. (A wise burglar breaking into the
Davis mansion would pass up the silver and head straight to Barbara's
Rolodex.) When she sells a table at the ball--top price $100,000--she
does it herself. ''Sometimes you feel like you're being a pain in the
neck and you probably are, but . . . .'' she trails off, her cause
being justification enough.</TE>
<TE>   Diabetes is a grisly ailment, stealing limbs and kidney function
and eyesight. Dana Davis was legally blind for a year before multiple
laser surgeries saved her vision. Children with diabetes may inject
themselves with insulin four times a day; the shock-value of the
sight of a preschooler in a frilly dress sticking a needle in her arm
is why such pictures are on the cover of Davis' foundation reports.</TE>
<TE>   In a quarter-century, Davis has learned to spiel about
diabetes--about receiver cells and pancreatic function--like an M.D.
on grand rounds. She can deliver a brief on insulin varieties with
the patter of a pharmaceutical rep. In a perfect world, she'd like to
squeeze in a medical seminar at every Carousel Ball, between the
shrimp salad and baked Alaska. But she knows her audience better than
that.</TE>
<TE>   If they want to read about diabetes, there's a program, thick as
an Aspen phone book with congratulatory ads from pharmaceutical
companies, film folk, couture houses and other people's charities, at
$2,500 per ''platinum page.'' But once her guests are there, ''I want
them to have a fun evening''--the more fun, the more big names, the
likelier they'll write their checks and come back again in two years.</TE>
<TE>   ''I've been to a few evenings where they've had the doctors stand
up making speeches and speeches about things that people don't
understand, and you know what? Better the doctors talk to each other,
seriously, and make progress.'' (So they do, at a seminar in the
hotel the same day as the ball, updating one another on research
while le tout Los Angeles is struggling into its Spandex foundation
garments and spangles.)</TE>
<TE>   It troubles Davis not at all that some of the 1,350 people who
will swan into the Beverly Hilton ballroom in nine days' time don't
know diabetes from dengue fever. ''I think that's just fine. They've
given a lot of money, they're there to have a good time,'' she says
with a shrug in her voice.</TE>
<TE>   John Davis is a producer--his latest project is an Eddie Murphy
film, ''Daddy Day Care''--and he recognizes a kindred soul in his
mother. ''She's a showman. She realizes if you're going to continue
to get people to pay $50,000 for a table or $5,000 for a seat,
there's a lot of competing [charity] opportunities in this town. You
have to give people something to make them want to come back.''</TE>
<TE>   How Barbara Davis does this is by navigating the tangled Gordian
knot of friendships and patronage and favors and courtesies that
thread their way through the circles and loops within loops of big
names and big money in area codes from 310 to 212. Some small
for-instances: singer Kenny Rogers played the ball twice in Denver,
and in 1984 the Davises bought his Beverly Hills estate, The Knoll--a
place so vast that Bob Newhart once walked in and asked, ''Where's
the gift shop?'' A guest cottage at The Knoll was rented for a time
by Lionel Ritchie, who sang at a Carousel Ball. Henry Kissinger, a
Carousel Ball fixture, served on Fox's board. Sting is playing next
week, for free, along with Elton John and B.B. King; the Davises just
rented Sting's Malibu beach house.</TE>
<TE>   Davis had been trying for years to get Elton John, but in June
2001, after he sang ''Happy Birthday'' at a friend's party in London,
Davis buttonholed him again and asked, ''Would you do the Carousel
Ball next year? I really need you and it would mean so much to us,
and he said, 'I'm there.' '' (Getting one evening when both Elton
John and Sting could make it is the reason the 2002 ball is on a
less-than-chic Tuesday night.)</TE>
<TE>   What with those quids pro quo, and the volunteers (from Emmy
winners to gift-bag stuffers), the Carousel of Hope comes in with a
high-yield, low-overhead bottom line--maybe 20% to 25% of the take
going to pay for what cannot be donated, the rest to diabetes
charities, estimates Christine Lerner, the executive director of the
foundation. The Carousel Ball of 2000 took in close to $6 million,
including $1.5 million from Marvin Davis, and netted about $4.5
million. By Hollywood's oh-poor-me accounting standards, the Carousel
Ball's net points are dazzling.</TE>
<TE>   People rarely say no to Barbara Davis. Merv Griffin, who long ago
happily succumbed to her siren song, says when she meets someone new,
''It's almost, 'How do you do. Nice to meet you. Would you like to
come to the Carousel Ball?' ''</TE>
<TE>   Sponsorship? No? Then how about buying a table? All right, what
about something for our gift bags, 1,500 of them. The bags are a
Davis hallmark, ''lovely parting gifts,'' as the game-show hosts
would put it, the take-away tangibles that even the rich covet. At
the last Carousel Ball, someone stole a truck full of the gift bags,
and even after he abandoned it in a chase, ran off with a few of the
bags.</TE>
<TE>   This year there will be three gift bags, crammed like pinatas with
goods--trinkets from MAC cosmetics, a teeth-whitening kit from
Rembrandt, a Barbie doll, a Christopher Radko Carousel Ball Christmas
ornament--all coaxed from companies by Davis and her committee, who
sometimes put the potential giver in a competitively charitable frame
of mind by telling what some of the others are giving. After 11 p.m.
on Oct. 15, the line of guests heading for cars will look like
well-heeled refugees, loaded down with bags. Home Depot has agreed to
donate wheelbarrows to help get the loot to the boots of the BMWs and
Jaguars.</TE>
<TE>   Merv Griffin knows why so many companies give so much: ''She's
their best customer!'' Saks and Neiman Marcus give window space to
the celebrity-painted plates by the likes of Oprah and Britney Spears
and John Travolta and Chris Rock that will be auctioned off Oct. 15.
Sotheby's is throwing a party Wednesday to exhibit the art and
photographs from 60 artists and celebs, from Richard Meier to Ringo
Starr. Then there are the corporate $100,000 sponsors such as
Chopard, the luxury jeweler; General Motors; American Airlines;
Guess? Inc.; and Toys R Us, whose chairman is an old Denver friend of
the Davises</TE>
<TE>   Barbara Davis practices the art, the sport, the science of mutual
patronage. ''You've got to go to people that you also reciprocate
with. Let's face it, if somebody gives to me, I give to them.'' She
explains her technique: ''I never bother anybody where I don't go to
shop. In other words, I only go [for donations] to places where I
give them business--which is everywhere,'' she says, mocking her
Olympic-caliber shopping reputation. ''But if they string me along, I
just don't go in . . . and they know it. And usually I get a phone
call, 'We found we can do this.' And that's not nice but . . . . I
really think that if you patronize them, they've got to care about
you. As I say, this is not just an event, it's a lifetime's caring.''</TE>
<TE>   Late in the summer, team Davis meets at the Beverly Hilton. ''This
is the year,'' Davis is saying, ''that we attack people, and anybody
we know that has anything, we ask them for it.''</TE>
<TE>   Someone arrives with a souvenir T-shirt from another charity
fund-raiser. ''There's a lot of sponsors on this shirt,'' daughter
Nancy notes. ''Oh, let's grab their sponsors!'' her mother says. This
is classic Davis, trying to squeeze more money into her foundation's
coffers, and everyone laughs. ( At one point Davis' cell phone rings.
It is Viacom chief Sumner Redstone, whom she invites to dinner a few
nights later along with his fiancee, Paula, who will no doubt wind up
as one of the nearly 600 names on a Carousel committee.)</TE>
<TE>   Nancy sits on her mother's right. She has multiple sclerosis and
has launched her own benefit gala, the Race to Erase MS. On Barbara's
left is the show's producer, George Schlatter. He is a force behind
productions ranging from ''Laugh-In'' to the George Bush Deux
inaugural--neither of those for free, he will have you know, unlike
the Carousel of Hope, to which he donates his own and staff hours, so
many that he can't reckon, because ''my accountant would have a
stroke.''</TE>
<TE>   Around these tables is the core committee, the Carousel Ball
cabinet, which comprises several hundred years of ties and loyalties.
Christine Lerner left a radio production assistant's job to help
Davis out for ''a few days.'' A quarter-century later she is
executive director of the foundation and Davis' alter ego. The
Carousel invitation list, too, is deep with old friends from Houston
and Denver, and actors whose stars may have dimmed in the public's
eyes but not in Davis'.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, a long list of friends brings its own set of problems.
The ball is weeks away and Davis is already bracing for the worst
part, the morning after--the seating chart fallout. ''To do the
seating is the most death-defying job in the world. You don't want to
hurt anybody's feelings . . . I want everybody to have the best time
they've ever had, and they're not going to have that best time if
they don't like their seats.'' So even an hour before the doors open,
she will be down in the ballroom, still fussing over the seating.
Some people are invariably stuck near the back, or in the foyer,
watching it all on monitors, and the next day, early, the complaints
begin. ''I just suffer. I send flowers. But . . . .'' and her voice
fades; it can't be helped.</TE>
<TE>   There is also a dinner committee, and regional committees for
out-of-towners, and the auction committee co-chaired by 34-year-old
Dana Davis, whose diabetes began all this so long ago. She teaches at
a private school. She is quieter than her mother and sister, but has
the silent auction drill down cold.</TE>
<TE>   The massive entertainment committee is not so much a committee as
a roll call of 200-some luminaries who serve chiefly to ornament the
event, for it's absurd to think of getting a fraction of them in the
same room to vote on some motion. Madonna, Barbra Streisand, Arnold
Schwarzenegger, Judi Dench and Pamela Anderson, Tom Hanks, Gregory
Peck, Stevie Wonder, Tom Cruise (and Penelope Cruz and Nicole Kidman,
separately), Sylvester Stallone, Bob Hope, Billy Crystal, Liam
Neeson, Sharon Stone, Dennis Hopper, Bill Cosby, Shirley MacLaine,
Shaquille O'Neal. The list is a testament to celebrity snowballing.</TE>
<TE>   Davis has made this an indispensable must-show, must-go soiree
spread across the society pages of two continents. But it is far from
a high-voltage venue of choice for the hip, the under-35 stars and
younger moguls, the way the Cinematheque event, the Vanity Fair Oscar
party or certain AFI awards are. This is old-school society, with an
impeccably mannered hostess and a laudable cause that gives
protective coloring to having it and flaunting it. Actress Jennifer
Tilly, casting a covetous eye on diamond earrings auctioned a few
balls ago, once neatly conveyed the formula that makes it all right
to put on the ritz with a self-congratulatory conscience: ''It's for
a good cause, so I can buy jewelry and feel like Mother Teresa.''</TE>
<TE>   But even Mother Teresa couldn't hold this fickle crowd for three
hours, and Schlatter knows it. The Show is fraught with crisis second
only to The Seating Chart: every time, same problems, different
characters.</TE>
<TE>   If there's anything tougher than getting stars to do a favor,
Schlatter likes to say, ''it's getting them to do you a short
favor.'' In the old Denver days, Kenny Rogers sang for an hour for
bedazzled Denverites. Angelenos would be fumbling for the valet claim
check after three songs, and Davis knows it.</TE>
<TE>   Nancy Davis says they should make sure Elton John, Sting and B.B.
King sing familiar tunes, not just their new stuff. ''I think it's
real important we get the songs that are the hits that people in this
audience like.'' David Foster, the musical director who also donates
his labors, warns her, ''Well, you're not going to get that from
Sting. He's already wanting to do jazz, that's all he's been doing.''
It turns out fine because Sting's new stuff is, in fact, arrangements
of old stuff like ''A Foggy Day in London Town,'' which will go over
smashingly with this crowd. Problem resolved.</TE>
<TE>   As the show winds down, something curious happens in L.A. that
happens almost nowhere else. No matter how good a time people are
having, they want to get out of there and home by midnight, or even
11 o'clock, perhaps to see themselves on the late news. One local
fund-raising group, the Library Foundation, gently mocks this quirk
by giving an annual ''Stay Home and Read a Book Ball''; send in your
check and just stay in that night and read.</TE>
<TE>   That would never be Barbara Davis' style. At home at The Knoll,
when midnight has come and gone, when the signature pink couture
ballgown is hung up and the diamonds are back in the safe, she'll go
to bed, and wake up not to the morning after the Carousel Ball, but
to Day One of the countdown to the next.</TE>

<HD>Dinner Dates</HD>
<DH>Californians Are No Longer Taking the Versatile Fruit for
Granted</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HENRY FENWICK</AU>
<BD>Henry Fenwick last wrote for the magazine on the
Children's Hospital of Orange County Follies.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>California taught me that dates have a season. As a child in England,
I thought of dates strictly as a holiday sort of fruit, dried and
sticky, perfect, in their long, round-ended boxes for shoving into
stockings, with a tangerine nestled beside them in the toe. I enjoyed
them on those terms, especially when, in my childhood, they were
lovingly stuffed with marzipan by my mother. The richness of that
almond-date combination was my first experience of luxury. With more
culinary experience under my belt, I've discovered that Southern
California oranges and dates are an equally delicious pairing, the
tartness of the orange and the rich sweetness of the date making the
mouth come alive. Alice Waters sometimes serves fresh dates at her
Berkeley restaurant Chez Panisse alongside tangerines.</LD>
<TE>   The difference between the dried fruit of my childhood and what
many in Southern California take for granted, fresh dates, is huge.
In the Coachella Valley some 100 different varieties are harvested
from September to December, and more than 1,000 are grown throughout
the world. Eighty percent of the dates grown in California are Deglet
Noor, which are ideal for cooking and available fresh at local
farmers' markets from October to December. The popular Medjool, which
is better for eating than the Deglet Noor, accounts for 15% of
California dates. The remaining five percent consists of such
fascinating varieties as the Barhi, nicknamed the "honeyball" for its
sweetness and color, the Halawy, small and intense, and the Khadrawy,
firm with a caramel flavor. In the fall you can eat your way through
the date gardens of the desert. Probably the best stop for those
wanting to do some serious taste testing is the Oasis Date Gardens,
surrounded by date orchards beside Highway 111 in Thermal. There you
can buy a wide variety of loose dates, so you can take samplings of
as many kinds as you like. In early September I bought a selection of
six different types, freshly harvested, including yellow Barhi dates
still on the branch; smooth, sharp, crisp to the bite like an apple,
though they ripen quickly to a honey-colored, honey-tasting delight.</TE>
<TE>   Experimenting with dates is an increasingly popular trend on
Southern California menus, sometimes in an expectedly Middle Eastern
way, in variations on couscous, in a Moroccan orange salad, sometimes
in surprising new combinations. La Quinta caterer Sherry Pena makes a
date tamale with a brilliant juxtaposition of Mexican and Middle
Eastern flavors. And last Thanksgiving a friend served up a delicious
date sauce to accompany roast duck. But it is that insistent, subtle
sweetness that brings us back to desserts: date custards, dates
drizzled with yogurt, dates with almonds, walnuts, dates with soft
cheese, dates spun in sugar and matched with a bittersweet chocolate.
There are not enough days between October and December to try all
these fresh treats.</TE>

<DH>Garden Designer Eric Nagelmann Plants a Tropical Palette at
His Santa Barbara Home</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUSAN HEEGER</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>You won't find roses above Eric Nagelmann's front door in his Santa
Barbara garden. The garden designer has gone a nontraditional route,
planting yellow stigmaphyllon vine, its leaves and blooms packed so
densely among fuchsias and staghorn ferns that the house itself,
fully wreathed, seems alive. Nearby, maidenhair ferns and polypodiums
sprout with kalanchoes and orange impatiens. ''Poor plant, it's had a
bad rap. But you should see impatiens in the Costa Rican rain
forest,'' says Nagelmann, who is known for charging even formal
landscapes with dreamy, unexpected details. Lotus ponds. Black
fishtail palms. ''The magic comes with how you use the plant.''</LD>
<LD>   In his own garden, on a narrow, 50-by-100-foot slope above the
Santa Barbara harbor, there were few plants when he arrived in 1998.
Wall-to-wall concrete and chain-link set the scene around the boxy,
late-'60s era house. But to a designer, emptiness equals opportunity.
Once Nagelmann moved in he began stripping down the house, removing
carpets, chandeliers and tatty wallpaper, painting the indoors white.
Outside, he chose gunmetal green for walls that he would swath in
leaves, then added a pink front door, what he calls ''shades of the
Caribbean.'' After jackhammering the cement, and uncovering
hard-packed clay soil, he brought in truckloads of compost, sand and
gypsum and spent days digging into the ground.</LD>
<TE>   Then came the fun part: choosing the exotic palette. ''I knew I
wanted big-leaved ficus, schizolobium and cussonia,'' he says, naming
trees which, along with some favorite palms, would evoke the spirit
of the tropics. He added logical shade companions such as fuchsias,
coleus, hydrangeas, crinum lilies. On the lower hill, which gets
direct sunlight, he planted most of his succulents, a class of plants
he has collected since he started gardening as a child. In other
spots, light- and shade-lovers grow together, in the dappled shadows
of a path, for instance, where bougainvillea twines above crassula
and graptopetalum and Spanish moss drips from coral trees. ''I can
mix these because I hand-water everything,'' he says, describing the
garden as ''a fantasy based on contrasts. What's alien is
interesting--those elements that don't belong and that make you
suddenly look twice.''</TE>
<TE>   Among the aliens are some Arizona junipers feathering up from a
stand of palms. Or the colorful marigolds he tucked in last year
among his succulents. Tomatoes hidden by euphorbias. ''Humor is
important too,'' Nagelmann says. ''We should have fun with our
gardens, and not make them all about show.''</TE>
<TE>   The designer also makes room for new, or old, plant passions: the
ivy geranium, say, that reminds Nagelmann of his childhood. The Puya
alpestris, a blue-green succulent with otherworldly orange blooms.
''I'm not into 'pretty,' '' he says. ''I look for plants that touch
my emotions or challenge my perceptions. To me, this is what life's
about. Being open to seeing things with fresh eyes.''</TE>
<TE>   He is open to editing, too, as plants grow and crowd or shade out
other plants. Two years ago, sweet peas raged up one of his fences.
Last year, given the density of trees, he didn't bother to replant
them. And he has fewer bananas than he once did, and one lemon tree
instead of two. Still, it's not as easy as it was to see his ocean
view, or even to see across the lot.</TE>
<TE>   Nagelmann loves highly textural combinations--furcraea spiking
among banana leaves, opuntia popping up behind cycads, poppies
blooming in their midst. If you ask him where he's going with these,
he laughs. ''I'm pretty spontaneous,'' he says. ''I mostly listen to
my instincts. But, a true garden is never finished. And I'm anxious
to see what happens next.''</TE>

<DH>Can an Independent Producer Turn Obscure Asian Films Into
Hollywood Blockbusters? Roy Lee Finds Out With the Oct. 18 Debut of
DreamWorks' "The Ring."</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS WARREN</AU>
<BD>Chris Warren is a freelance writer living in Santa
Monica.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An eerie quiet pervades Dimension Films' offices in West Hollywood.
Mostly abandoned since the bulk of the studio's staff moved to new
headquarters on Sunset Boulevard, the cavernous complex feels
downright tomb-like compared to the typically frenetic pace of
business at a studio such as Warner Bros. But Roy Lee isn't
complaining as he picks a Japanese movie with a goofy title from a
pile in his office and slips it into his DVD player. The opening
credits roll for "Transparent: Tribute to a Sad Genius," and Lee--an
independent film producer based at Dimension who sits behind an
immaculately clean desk--folds his arms across his chest and focuses
on the large-screen TV that dominates his back wall.</LD>
<TE>   This is work for Lee. Unlike many producers and executives who
pitch projects by phone or hustle to get the hottest available
scripts, the 33-year-old Lee spends much of his time in solitude,
wading through stacks of tapes and DVDs of Korean and Japanese
movies, looking to find something a Hollywood studio might want to
remake--with him as a producer, of course. Although he watches most
of the films at home--he tries to see two or three a day--he has the
kind of work setup that's ideal for viewing movie after movie.
Besides the TV set and DVD player--both gifts from Asian companies he
has worked with in the past--Lee also has a machine that inserts
English subtitles, important because although he's of Korean descent,
Lee doesn't speak or understand either Korean or Japanese.</TE>
<TE>   During the past two years, Lee has carved out a niche for himself
as the sole go-between for Korean and Japanese filmmakers eager to
sell the remake rights to their movies and Hollywood executives
scrounging to find new sources of commercial ideas. Since Lee first
discovered Asia as an untapped reservoir for Hollywood-friendly
concepts, he has helped broker the sale of 10 Korean and Japanese
films. The first, a Japanese movie called "Ringu" ("The Ring"), was
sold to DreamWorks for about $1 million in early 2001. The American
version of the film, also called "The Ring" and featuring "Mulholland
Dr." star Naomi Watts, hits theaters Oct. 18. Last October, Lee
arranged the first-ever purchase of the remake rights of a Korean
movie by an American studio; Miramax paid almost $1 million for the
action-comedy "My Wife Is a Gangster," for which a script is being
written.</TE>
<TE>   All this has raised Lee's profile in Hollywood--he and his
partner, Doug Davison, last year were awarded office space and a
first-look deal by Dimension, a Miramax-owned studio that has
developed "Spy Kids" and the "Scream" movies--and it has transformed
him into a veritable Lew Wasserman in much of the Asian film
community. "All Korean film people know him and, as far as I know,
everyone is approaching him regarding the remake rights potential of
their films," says Josh Lee (no relation to Roy), senior manager for
international business at Cinemaservice, a Korean film company.</TE>
<TE>   Their interest is understandable: the checks Hollywood is writing
for their movies is enough to cover the entire budget of some
originals. Not surprisingly, Lee is being inundated with movies from
across the Pacific, typically receiving 10 per week. Some filmmakers
can't even wait until they shoot their movies. "I'm getting scripts
from directors, saying, 'What do you think of this? Do you think you
could sell the remake rights after we make the movie?' "</TE>
<TE>   Lee tries to read and watch some of everything sent to him. With
its opening credits finished, "Transparent" begins in dramatic
fashion: a plane crashes into a desolate forest; a fleet of
helicopters crosses the sky, presumably on its way to find survivors.
That Lee has quickly made a place for himself in the Hollywood system
by peddling obscure Asian movies like this one raises some intriguing
questions about the state of the movie industry today. Has Hollywood
run out of fresh ideas? Has the industry's obsession with making
movies with international appeal made it more receptive to ideas that
have already proven themselves with foreign crowds? It's probably a
little of both. What's clear, though, is that Roy Lee, through
instinct and maybe a little luck, is in a perfect position to take
full advantage.</TE>
<TE>   Virtually from the moment he arrived in Los Angeles in 1996, after
an eight-month stint as a corporate attorney in Washington, D.C., Lee
has been trying to innovate. At Alphaville, the production company
behind the "Mummy" movies, he was a tracker, a person whose job it is
to be aware of, and get, all the available scripts, books and
material floating around town. Historically a time-consuming task
done on the phone, Lee decided to put the whole process online,
creating an Internet tracking board where people could quickly post
and share information about available scripts. Importantly, as the
person maintaining the board, Lee established a wide network of
grateful contacts and a deep knowledge of what kind of material sold.
Later, Lee co-founded ScriptShark.com, a Web site that allows
aspiring writers the chance to have their scripts evaluated by
industry experts.</TE>
<TE>   When Lee decided to become an independent producer in 2000, he
already understood how tough the competition was for the best
material and, as a relative neophyte, how minuscule his chances were
of getting them. "I just wanted to look in a different place for
ideas that could be good movies," says Lee, a man more inclined
toward one-sentence answers than long expositions.</TE>
<TE>   His chance came in January 2001, when a friend of a friend--who
runs a film festival in Puchon, South Korea--urged him to watch
"Ringu." He got a little more than halfway through before he was too
spooked to continue. In the film, a strange videotape circulates
among a group of friends; everyone who watches it dies exactly a week
later. As Lee watched it the first time, he found the tone and
imagery of the movie chilling. One scene in particular--he refuses to
divulge its details because a similar scene is in the remake--scared
him enough to abandon watching altogether.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't be this much of a wimp," he remembers telling himself.
"I'd push the videotape in again, trying to watch it, and something
else weird would happen. I finally just turned it off."</TE>
<TE>   Trusting his visceral reaction to the movie, Lee popped the tape
out of the player, jumped in his car and drove to the house of Mark
Sourian, an executive he knew at DreamWorks SKG. Together they
watched the movie all the way through. The next day, Sourian drove
the film to the house of Walter Parkes, co-head of the motion picture
division at DreamWorks, and they watched it together. "Don't lose
this," Sourian remembers Parkes commanding him once the film was
over. "When you get that kind of edict from the co-head of the
studio, you want to make sure you don't screw it up."</TE>
<TE>   He didn't. DreamWorks bought the remake rights for the film and
made Lee an executive producer, a role that requires him to help the
studio find a writer and director for the remake and, along with his
partner Davison, help shape the direction of the new film.
Encouraged, Lee sought more titles from the woman at the film
festival and, during the past year, visited and networked with
filmmakers in Korea and Japan. Impressed with what he saw, Lee also
discovered he was the only American showing any interest in Korean
and Japanese films. "We've brought films [to Hollywood] before," says
Youngjoo Suh of Cineclick Asia, a film company in Seoul. "But they
thought Korean films were small and not interesting."</TE>
<TE>   That's not the case anymore. In fact, having a movie, rather than
a script or a book, to show people may be helping Lee immensely.
"It's tough enough to get a studio executive or an executive anywhere
to read a script," says Mark Morgan, president of Maverick Films,
Madonna's company, who, along with Lee, is producing the remake of
"My Sassy Girl," a Korean romantic drama with a surprising ending.
"They're much more likely to put the movie in, relax and watch it."
Just as important for Lee, people in the industry trust his
instincts. "It's hard to get through the clutter of Hollywood, and
you look for people who consistently have good taste," says Greg
Silverman, an executive at Warner Bros., which bought a Korean film,
"Il Mare," through Lee. "Roy is usually right. He gets my attention
when he calls to say he has something."</TE>
<TE>   Whether Lee is able to build on his early success is, of course,
an open question: Hollywood is famously fickle. But Hollywood as a
whole is more focused than ever on making movies that have as much
appeal to viewers in Berlin as in Burbank. "Since the mission of
Hollywood is now more global than ever--to make as much money as
possible all over the world--the tastes of the world come into play
with greater frequency and importance," says Tom Abrams, an associate
professor at the USC School of Cinema-Television. "Thus, remakes of
foreign movies make even more sense and are less likely to have been
seen here, or even by a global foreign audience."</TE>
<TE>   Lee says the remakes may even do well in their original markets,
because a film's fans might want to see how a more expensive version
of a movie turns out with better special effects. And he doesn't see
this ending anytime soon. He points out that the Asian film
industries are making more and more movies. "There are always fresh
new ideas constantly coming out of these foreign countries," he says.
"I don't think it's a well that's going to run dry."</TE>
<TE>   Back at Kee's office, "Transparent" plays on. He's picked it from
a pile of films that share one trait: they come from companies that
have granted Lee the freedom to shop the remake rights. If he gets
someone interested, he steps aside and lets the Asian and American
companies negotiate; if they can work out a deal, Lee becomes a
producer on the Hollywood version of the film. These companies also
share an allegiance to Lee. "I give all [suitable] tapes to Roy,"
says Cineclick Asia's Suh. "I always want to give the first chance to
Roy."</TE>
<TE>   Lee says these relationships make him confident that no one in
Hollywood can do what he does. He swings the monitor of his Sony
flat-screen computer to show an e-mail from a colleague in Korea: the
production company of a prominent Hollywood actor has contacted them
about the remake rights of one of their films, and they want to know
if Lee wants to see it first.</TE>
<TE>   Initially, when Asian filmmakers were more discriminating in what
they sent, one in five movies he watched had potential as a remake;
now it's one in 30. Lee says he has been careful not to dilute his
standards, which are based primarily on his gut reaction to a film.
"If I enjoy it, there's a chance that other executives would enjoy
it, too." There are other, more specific, questions he asks as well.
"What city in the U.S. could we set it in? What actor could that be?
If I can pick a certain city and a certain actor, and the story is
not too cultural to Asia, then I can figure out a way to set it up,"
he says.</TE>
<TE>   In general, Lee says, the Asian films don't require wholesale
changes. "The thinking is, if something worked really well in another
culture and has universal themes and story lines, why screw with it
too much?" he says. In "The Ring," for example, the setting is
changed from Japan to Seattle, and character names are Americanized.
The basic elements of the story and the tone of the original movie
remain intact, he says.</TE>
<TE>   After watching the opening crash and rescue scenes in
"Transparent," Lee is optimistic. "Nothing says this has to be
Japan," Lee says of the nondescript terrain. Despite the dramatic
start, as the movie unfolds it turns out to be a comedy.
Transparents, it's revealed, are geniuses so smart that their
thoughts escape their heads, audible to anyone within 10 meters of
them. They're also vital to society, working on solving big problems,
such as global warming (it's a Japanese movie, after all). But
there's a catch: If transparents discover people can hear their
thoughts, they may become despondent. To prevent that, and to avoid
losing out on their good works, the rest of society is trained to
ignore what they're thinking.</TE>
<TE>   Lee embraces the concept quickly and, to be honest, the movie does
have its moments. It follows one rather bumbling transparent, whose
thoughts are both inane and biting. Convinced of the salability of
the movie, Lee starts brainstorming casting ideas for the male lead.
"I'm thinking we can't do Jim Carrey, since he did 'The Truman Show,'
" he says. He throws out other names: Nicolas Cage, Ben Stiller, Jack
Black. The movie plays on in the background, but he's no longer
watching, but plotting his next move. It's been 25 minutes since the
movie began. "This one is going to be easy," he says.</TE>

<LD>S. Irene Virbila's one-star rating of Chez Mimi is ludicrous ("French
Re-Connection," Restaurants, Sept. 8). She praises the charming
restaurant as unpretentious and a breath of fresh air where one can
enjoy simple French food. Yet she categorizes it as limited for the
same reasons. She can't have it both ways! Chez Mimi's consistently
divine food, warm hospitality and reasonable prices are a testament
to what fills the restaurant on a daily basis.</LD>

<LD>Michael Weinberger wonders how he could have prevented his son's
murderous rampage ("Confession of a Child Killer," by Tim Reiterman,
Sept. 15). Outside sources say that Justin Weinberger exhibited
abnormal signs, including a violent temper and withdrawn
demeanor--signs of depression. Isn't that sufficient for his father
to see that he needed immediate intervention? These are not defenses
for the murder of Courtney Sconce, only explanations for a life
slipping away and the absence of parental guidance.</LD>

<TE>   "Fortunately," the article states, "there was a way to rule out
suspects--DNA testing." Unfortunately, thousands of criminal cases
remain unsolved because there aren't enough analysts to process DNA
evidence. DNA samples collected from victims of violent crime in Los
Angeles may not be tested for months or years. Unless we work to
educate the community about the threat to public health caused by the
grave shortage of personnel, the potential benefit of DNA testing to
identify suspects more quickly will be lost.</TE>

<LD>State officials do not claim that a prison will be the "economic

Matthew Heller, Sept. 1). Economic impacts of a prison are normally
spread over a region and the host community receives some of the
benefit. We could have told Heller how many paychecks from North Kern
State Prison go to people who live in Delano: 229. We also could have
told him that the state Board of Equalization has a model suggesting
those paychecks generate annual wages and salaries of $15,510,027,
which generates retail sales of $7,599,913.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The piece by Richard A. Serrano ("Poignant Protest," Sept. 15) about
the ill-treatment of the mothers and wives of black servicemen killed
in Europe in World War I was an interesting revelation of an
all-but-forgotten incident subsequent to an all-but-forgotten war in
an all-but-forgotten era. But the article was notable for its
omissions as much as its revelations.</LD>
<LD>   Although Serrano pointed out that "most of the black soldiers and
sailors had worked as support staff" and that "they were not felled
by enemy bullets," he neglected to mention that thousands of black
Americans were assigned as combat infantrymen and aviators under the
French flag and that many were wounded and died under enemy fire,
earning France's highest decorations for their valor. Serrano may
have contributed to the stereotyping of blacks, which plagues the
recounting of history in our country.</LD>

<LD>S. Irene Virbila's gratuitous insult of union waiters in "Corporate
Cuisine" (Restaurants, Sept. 15) is even less appetizing than the
beef carpaccio she tasted at Bice. Our union lost 43 members on Sept.
11, 2001. They were working at Windows on the World, a restaurant
known internationally for its extraordinary service as well as its
menu and vistas. To suggest that they, and union servers in general,
were and are "without a shred of interest in the restaurant or the
business" betrays both bias and ignorance on Virbila's part. Assuming
her criticism of the service at Bice is accurate, I'd say a union is
just what those waiters need.</LD>

<HD>The Education of Patrick McCabe</HD>
<DH>Everyone Is Talking About Education Reform. At Least One
Guy Decided to Do Something About It.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANDY MEISLER</AU>
<BD>Andy Meisler is a freelance writer living in Los
Angeles. He last wrote for the magazine about the Professional
Bowlers Assn.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>On Monday, July 2, 2001, 45-year-old Patrick S. McCabe took up the
post of Head of School and CEO at the elementary and middle school
campus of Newbridge School, a private educational institution.
Newbridge's K-8 facility is located primarily in four wooden
bungalows rented from the Good Shepherd Baptist Church at 16th and
Pearl, cater-corner from Santa Monica College.</LD>
<LD>   That morning McCabe discovered that Newbridge School had debts of
nearly $250,000 and a total of $900 in cash. That week he met a
polite IRS employee named Lester, who presented McCabe with an
overdue payroll tax bill for $130,000. McCabe also learned that
Newbridge was being sued by a former administrator, represented by
Gloria Allred's law firm, who claimed her firing had been the result
of sexual discrimination.</LD>
<LD>   Three weeks later McCabe came to work and found that during the
weekend someone had broken into Newbridge and stolen the computers
and office equipment. Also, the school's pet puffer fish, Mr. Fugu,
was dead. When two Santa Monica cops arrived, one mentioned that
school thefts were common in the neighborhood. McCabe, outraged at
the very notion, became agitated and had to be told firmly to calm
down.</LD>
<TE>   It might be timely to mention here that Pat McCabe is (a) 6-foot-4
and weighs 290 pounds; (b) a child of privilege, a devoted husband
and father, and affluent by any conceivable definition of the word;
(c) a person who had neither taught at nor administered any private
or public school before July 2, 2001; and (d) was exactly 21 days
into the most challenging, frustrating and personally fulfilling year
of his life.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, to not-quite-unanimous acclaim, McCabe started another
school year at the helm of Newbridge--and another turn in his
corkscrew journey through the American Dream. He hasn't exactly taken
a scholastic vow of poverty. And unlike former Colorado
politico-turned-Los Angeles Unified School District honcho Roy Romer,
he hasn't taken on the challenge of turning around a 750,000-student
urban school system. But let's face it: These days, when everyone
from W on down has his own pet theory on how to solve the nation's
educational woes, McCabe has gotten his hands dirtier and gotten
closer to the solution than any think-tank theorist.</TE>
<TE>   Even before Pat McCabe became only the second head of School in
the 30-year history of Newbridge--after walking away from a
sports/television/marketing career for which millions of middle-aged
men would have traded every remaining hair on their heads--a
persistent buzz had developed about him in certain upper-income
sectors of Los Angeles. Other observers who knew a good story line
when they heard one were also intrigued:</TE>
<TE>   Was McCabe a saint? A dilettante? A point of light? A bull in a
China shop? A dose of corrective medicine for an outmoded institution
mired in the 1960s? Or maybe just a rich guy working through a
midlife crisis?</TE>
<TE>   At 8:45 a.m. on a Friday last fall, an invited guest perched on a
metal folding chair at Newbridge's weekly All-School Meeting. In a
long, narrow loft located directly over the church's pews sat 85
students. They ranged from giggling kindergartners in the first row
to determinedly blase 11th graders in the rear. Their diverse mix of
races, nationalities, sizes and shapes would have warmed the heart of
many a TV sitcom casting director.</TE>
<TE>   During a brisk 30 minutes, the student body heard, among other
things, Juliet Biederman, Newbridge's 32-year-old school director,
read a letter from the director of a local theater company praising
the contributions of a blushing sixth grader to the theater's special
post-Sept. 11 performance. A seventh grader played a tuneful
rendition of a Bach prelude on his cello. Two guitar-playing teachers
led a sing-along of one of the school's favorites, "Why Must I Be a
Teenager in Love?"</TE>
<TE>   During those proceedings, Pat McCabe, wearing khakis and a polo
shirt, stood off to one side, arms crossed and working hard to look
headmasterly. McCabe's main contribution to the program was to step
front and center and announce, in his capacity as head coach of two
of the three athletic teams at Newbridge, a nugget of good news: the
middle school boys basketball team, which because of enrollment
limitations has only seven players (including a guard and a forward
who, technically, are girls) had that week defeated Willows School, a
rival so big and strong that it even has its own rooftop court.</TE>
<TE>   "What are our priorities when we play sports?" he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Have fun," came the ragged response.</TE>
<TE>   "And?" said McCabe.</TE>
<TE>   "Try your hardest," chanted the students.</TE>
<TE>   "And the third and most important?"</TE>
<TE>   A slight delay.</TE>
<TE>   "Sportsmanship?" ventured one or two brave souls.</TE>
<TE>   "That's right," said McCabe. "Now, everyone!"</TE>
<TE>   "Sports! Man! Ship!" said the students and adults, in unison.</TE>
<TE>   "When i told my family i was going to take this job," McCabe said
a few minutes later from behind his desk, "my son started crying. He
said, 'Are we going to lose our Lakers tickets?' "</TE>
<TE>   A good question. McCabe won't disclose his Newbridge salary--there
are rumors he donates all of it, whatever it is, back to the
school--but he does concede that it's less than his annual expense
account at a previous job. But no, he told 12-year-old Will McCabe,
their pair of $150-a-game season seats were safe. So was the family's
north-of-Montana house in Santa Monica; Will and his younger sister
Katie's then-enrollment at John Thomas Dye School in Bel-Air; his
family's membership in The Beach Club, an exclusive enclave on PCH;
and his mother Nancy's own 2-year-old midlife career change from TV
movie development executive to freelance "life coach."</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, as McCabe says during the course of numerous
conversations during his first school year, there have been major
lifestyle changes for him and his family.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm working harder than I ever have," he says. "I used to be able
to walk out of my office and forget my job immediately. My time at
home was strictly family time. Now I think about my job all the time.
It's like I have 75 families and 85 kids. I wake up at 3:05 in the
morning like, 'Oh, my God, I've got 85 kids and how am I going to
keep the school going, where is the money going to come from? How are
we going to do this? The lease is up next July. What happens then?' "</TE>
<TE>   Although he likes his office at Newbridge (a small first-floor
room with a great view of a sandbox) better than his previous one (in
a Century City high-rise looking out over the neighborhood in which
he grew up), and he treasures the daily contact with "his" kids, any
Mr. Chipsian fantasies McCabe might have harbored evaporated his
first day on the job. Since then, he says, he's gotten support from
friends and peers, although he suspects some wonder if he's gone
nuts. He also has made several other major discoveries and decisions
since his arrival at Newbridge. One is that the school needs about 25
more students paying the average full fee of $11,500 per year to be
financially viable. Another is that the vast majority of its
teachers, who make a guilt-inducing $40,000 a year, are so talented
and dedicated that he has no business whatsoever meddling in their
classrooms. Most important, perhaps, is his certainty that without
drastic changes the school he's trying to rescue is doomed.</TE>
<TE>   "To survive," McCabe says, "Newbridge School has to be primarily
for kids who are middle-to-upper income and middle-to-upper learning.
But the middle kid who's got a few problems, not totally disruptive,
I want that kid."</TE>
<TE>   That means, he explains, that the percentage of students on
financial assistance must be reduced from 40% to 15%. And that kids
with special behavioral or learning problems who take up more than
their share of class time--even a class that holds only 10 or 12
students--should attend a public or more specialized (probably more
expensive) private school tailored to their needs.</TE>
<TE>   "Schools aren't businesses, but they have to be run like a
business or they're not going to succeed," he says. Thereby, as they
say in the made-for-TV movie world, hangs our "B Story."</TE>
<TE>   A K-12 private school founded in 1972, Newbridge was the
brainchild--practically a real child, friends say--of the late Dr.
Myron "Mike" Jacobson, who received his doctorate in education at NYU
and was a Ford Foundation fellow. How people recall Jacobson these
days is a Rorschach test of how they relate to pre-Reagan educational
theory.</TE>
<TE>   In the 1970s and 1980s, say alumni and former teachers, Newbridge
contained a heady mixture of scholarship students from the inner
city; middle-class kids battling (or not) their learning problems;
and celebrity offspring, including, according to former Newbridge
teacher Irwin Russo, the children of Quincy Jones and Peggy Lipton,
and Britt Ekland and Lou Adler.</TE>
<TE>   Newbridge and another "alternative" school, Crossroads, were
founded at about the same time. Jacobson was a friend of Paul
Cummins, the former headmaster and recently retired president of
Crossroads, now a prosperous and highly regarded institution with a
partly unfair reputation for attracting overachieving children of
rich and famous Westside liberals.</TE>
<TE>   "The kids who Mike took in," says Cummins, "were kids who, in some
cases, were just on the verge of giving up on education as a viable
means of preparing for their future, kids who were kind of mavericks,
kids who were just not making it in their current school. And Mike
would take them and give them affection, a reasonably demanding
academic program--but make them feel like they could do it. And so he
turned around a lot of lives."</TE>
<TE>   Scott Hunter, who has taught at Newbridge since the mid-'90s,
remembers "Dr. Mike" giving him special instructions. "Mike took me
aside and said: 'One of your classes this year is going to be
one-on-one with this kid who is very bright and has had a nervous
breakdown. He's spent many months out of the loop. He loves
computers, hates books and reading. You're going to be his English
teacher.' "</TE>
<TE>   Hunter fondly recalls having him read Douglas Adams' "The Hitch
Hikers' Guide to the Galaxy," then segueing successfully into Tom
Stoppard's "Arcadia." That year he helped the student overcome his
fear of school and set him on the path to college. He also remembers
that Jacobson never groomed a successor. Others remember another
quirk: He would talk for hours about teaching but never about
administration or finance.</TE>
<TE>   Adds Cummins, "Mike was a pioneer who never got settled. He didn't
keep up with what was happening in the independent school world. He
didn't join the California Assn. of Independent Schools, which cuts
down on the number of foundations you can go to [for money]. If you
don't have that Good Housekeeping Seal of Approval, then the major
foundations are going to say, 'Well, that's pleasant what you're
doing, but it's not really substantial enough for us to invest in
you.'</TE>
<TE>   "And because Mike kept control of the school pretty close to
himself, he never developed a strong board of trustees who could
provide him with the financial support and the contacts to help him.
He didn't really do much fund-raising--except within his own little
community."</TE>
<TE>   You might say the same thing about Pat McCabe, except that McCabe
is perhaps one of the most well-connected men in Los Angeles. Among
the individuals in his community, assembled during a hyper-gregarious
life, are: Steve Kerr, the former Chicago Bull now with the San
Antonio Spurs; exercise guru Kathy Smith; actor Chris O'Donnell;
Michael Segal, CEO of FS Fred Segal; Scott Powell, an orthopedic
surgeon and former member of the retro-rock group Sha Na Na; Ed
Wilson, president of NBC enterprises and syndication; Thomas Hudnut,
headmaster of Harvard-Westlake School; Joe Fitzgerald, executive vice
president of investor relations and corporate communication for Metro
Goldwyn Meyer Inc.; jazz bassist Marcus Miller; and Chris Lewis,
Richard Riordan's business partner.</TE>
<TE>   McCabe is the son of the late Ted McCabe, a physically imposing,
well-known attorney who taught a class for 13 years at USC Law
School. Pat McCabe was raised in Cheviot Hills. He went to Harvard
School (now Harvard-Westlake School), where he was captain of the
basketball team. He graduated from Wesleyan University, where he was
president of his fraternity.</TE>
<TE>   Says McCabe, "When I got out of Wesleyan, I was at a fork in the
road and I could have walked right into Columbia grad school of
education. I thought, OK, I am a coach. I see myself as a teacher.
[But] I really wanted financial independence from my dad. Everyone
always told me, 'You're big, you're a good athlete, you're funny,
people like you, you should be in sales.' I got a job as a textile
salesman."</TE>
<TE>   McCabe says he hated selling, but because he was big and funny he
managed to fall upward into sales management. "My real success," he
says, "came on the management side. When you are in management you
are a teacher, a coach. A motivator."</TE>
<TE>   McCabe moved back to Los Angeles, married Nancy Kendall, the
daughter of a wealthy real estate developer, and entered the ad
business. He also became active in coaching youth sports teams and in
fund-raising for Harvard-Westlake and Wesleyan.</TE>
<TE>   In 1989 McCabe hit ex-jock pay dirt: he became national
advertising manager for Cablevision's SportsChannel regional
networks. A big part of his job was wooing clients by taking them to
major sports events. Sometimes he just went; taking clients wasn't
mandatory.</TE>
<TE>   "I remember one time we had this great trip," says Steve Berger, a
top L.A.-based adman and a longtime McCabe friend. "We flew to
Chicago and actually saw three sporting events in less than two days.
We saw the last hockey game of the year that night, then the next day
took the train to Wrigley Field, scalped a couple of Cubs tickets,
sat a few rows over the dugout. Afterward [we] saw the Bulls play.
With Jordan."</TE>
<TE>   In 1997, however, Fox Sports bought into Cablevision in a
complicated transaction valued at $850 million. McCabe's stock
options had vested, and he came away a short time later with a lot of
cash but didn't see himself as "one of those guys at The Beach Club
who drink mai tais for the rest of their lives." Instead he "sat on a
park bench for about six months," then bought into a boutique sports
management firm.</TE>
<TE>   His new job included, in one instance, taking a phone call from a
professional basketball player who reported that his sprinkler system
wasn't working. The player wanted to know what McCabe intended doing
about it. During that same period, McCabe's father died.</TE>
<TE>   One day McCabe met with Hudnut at Harvard-Westlake. "I said, 'You
know what, Tom, I am done. I'm 43. I have my own little company. I
don't like it. I want to be a coach and a teacher. I want to coach
the seventh-grade basketball team and I want to teach eighth-grade
English.'</TE>
<TE>   "And Tom said, 'That is the stupidest thing I have ever heard.
Because that is a job you get right out of college--and middle-aged
guys like you who go teach school make that mistake every time. Why
would you go back to something you could do when you were 23? You
have all this managerial experience. You have to wait for a school
you can run.' "</TE>
<TE>   In 1988, a group of Newbridge teachers, at odds with founder
Jacobson, broke away from the school and started their own. The split
cost Newbridge nearly half its staff and student body. Jacobson
uprooted Newbridge from its longtime home on Robertson Boulevard and
started a peripatetic trek through several temporary locations. By
the late '90s the school was divided into K-8 in the Baptist church
and high school in another church in Culver City. Enrollment never
recovered.</TE>
<TE>   In March 2000, about the time that McCabe had his meltdown,
Jacobson died of complications related to heart surgery. Afterward
the school was run by two of his lieutenants, a man and a woman.
According to several accounts, they ran Newbridge with Jacobson's
paternalism and secrecy but little of his vision or charisma.
Enrollment dropped even more. By 2001, a number of concerned
Newbridge parents had wrested control from the "old" school board,
which consisted of Jacobson's widow and several of his friends, and
formed a search committee to find a new Head of School.</TE>
<TE>   The new board consulted with Cummins--yet another Harvard School
alum to whom Michael Segal, a prep school classmate, had introduced
McCabe a few months earlier. Cummins submitted a list of five
potential Heads of School. Pat McCabe's name was on it.</TE>
<TE>   According to McCabe, he began his job interview with the admission
that he didn't know the difference between a curriculum and a
cucumber. According to members of the search committee, the parents
sensed McCabe's love for children and respect for the value of
private education. More to the point, they liked his extensive
business and fund-raising experience. One week before McCabe's
arrival, the board fired the two administrators. Hence the rocket
from Gloria Allred's office and the "restatement" of the school's
deficit.</TE>
<TE>   "After that first day," he says, "I went home and said, 'This is
not good.' I knew I was in way over my head--that I'd taken a giant
leap into a big hole."</TE>
<TE>   McCabe's first decision was to appoint as school director Juliet
Biederman, who before moving to Los Angeles and Newbridge spent two
years teaching in Louisiana. In her new role she was in charge of
managing teachers and curriculum. McCabe's second move was to close
the high school.</TE>
<TE>   "There were too few students in grades nine through 12 to support
it," says McCabe. However, the 18 students in 11th grade, with
support from their parents, petitioned to stay affiliated with
Newbridge. McCabe arranged for them to attend classes in a room
rented from a nearby YWCA and take courses at Santa Monica College.
In June they'll graduate, then turn off the lights behind them.</TE>
<TE>   After making those tough decisions during his first weeks, McCabe
recalls his relief at finally coming to work to a school filled with
children. His first day of classes? Sept. 10, 2001.</TE>
<TE>   "So the next day I come to work and an 8-year-old asks me, 'Mr.
McCabe, is a plane going to hit our building?' "</TE>
<TE>   For the next few days teachers in all grades included discussions
of the terrorist attacks in their lessons. Also, everybody absorbed
some changes instituted by McCabe and Biederman: Heads of School
would not be addressed by their first names. Tardiness would be
changed from an encounter group topic to a parent-administrator
meeting. In short, the disciplinary system would leave much less to
the imagination.</TE>
<TE>   The final step in that disciplinary system leads directly to
McCabe's office, where, more often than not, he's doing his best to
raise cash, stall creditors and scare up new tuition-paying students.
He started negotiations with the IRS agent, hoping to reduce and/or
stretch out the tax bill.</TE>
<TE>   He also settled what he calls the "nuisance lawsuit" filed by the
former female administrator. (Neither fired employee responded to
requests for an interview; however, in a letter one wrote: "Mike
Jacobson was a wonderful mentor who gave me the latitude to create,
build, nurture and lead the lower school at Newbridge. I am grateful
for his encouragement and the autonomy that allowed me to create the
excellent program that I hope still exists today.")</TE>
<TE>   McCabe began visiting preschools to recruit kindergarten students.
He requisitioned a dozen PCs from a friend whose company was buying
new ones. A 1995 Infiniti, which another friend was going to donate
to charity, was turned into $5,000 for Newbridge. He put the bite on
10 of his well-heeled friends, then invited them to a school tour and
thank you donor lunch at Valentino.</TE>
<TE>   McCabe restored the middle school's sports programs, which had
withered away over the years. At a basketball road game against a
private school, a woman rooting for the opposing team approached
McCabe and said, "You look exactly like someone who goes to our
private beach club." She figured McCabe wasn't the guy, though, since
there was no way that a middle school basketball coach could afford
to belong.</TE>
<TE>   During his first semester McCabe also met with angry parents whose
children had been disciplined. "The parents are shocked," he said in
his office one fall afternoon. "They're like, 'It never was like that
with Dr. Mike.' 'Well, it is now,' I told them."</TE>
<TE>   He added, "Now, you want to help people. [There are] five kids who
don't pay anything. And you've got to have that. You've got to have
economic diversity."</TE>
<TE>   And, he said, paying full tuition doesn't excuse lapses in
discipline. "[I've expelled ] two so far and there are two on the
horizon. I don't think they're going to make it. So somebody says,
'Well, they pay full tuition. You can't kick them out.' Well, you
know what? I don't care."</TE>
<TE>   On the positive side, McCabe said he had taken special interest in
two athletically gifted eighth graders whose behavior was borderline
at best. "They remind me of myself at that age. Real smartasses. So I
sat them both down and gave them The Talk: 'As far as your lives are
concerned, you're at a fork in the road. Which way are you going to
go? The right way? Or the wrong way?' "</TE>
<TE>   During an April interview McCabe reported that friends were
crossing to the other side of the street when they saw him coming.
The school's coffers already held $150,000 in donations from Friends
of Pat, though, and negotiations with the IRS were going well. The
basketball team had made it through two rounds of its league
playoffs. One of its female stars seemed a lock for a full
scholarship to New Roads School, an experimental offshoot of
Crossroads.</TE>
<TE>   McCabe also had noticed that many of the parents in arrears on
their kids' tuition were picking them up and dropping them off in
shiny new Explorers, Durangos and Cherokees. "I have a great idea,"
he growled one afternoon, glaring at the SUV caravan. "Why don't we
ask everyone to switch their monthly lease payments with their
tuition payments? I think we'd make out pretty good on that deal."</TE>
<TE>   McCabe actually put that policy in effect, saying that if a
parent's car payment is more than the monthly tuition payment, he or
she will no longer receive aid. Perhaps out of embarrassment, not
many off-road capable parents bought $100-a-seat tickets to The
Newbridge School's First Annual Fund-Raising Dinner and Auction, held
at The Beach Club on May 4. Except for three tables of slightly
uncomfortable-looking teachers, the dining room was filled
predominantly with Friends of Pat. They ate and drank and "gave back"
liberally. There was a silent auction. Then a very noisy auction. And
plenty of mai tais for everyone.</TE>
<TE>   At one point in the proceedings, McCabe stood up and declared
happily, "It's a wonderful life. And I'm George Bailey--I think! This
has been the best year of my life. The best job I've ever had."</TE>
<TE>   With four weeks to go in the school term, and a net of $60,000
from the dinner, McCabe was able to declare the budget
balanced--pending, of course, final agreement from the IRS.</TE>
<TE>   One of the problematic students had gotten into a public high
school, where his athletic talents were eagerly anticipated. The
other was on the waiting list for a private high school--there were
doubts about his self-control and attitude. Late in May he insulted a
teacher in graphic sexual terms. The next day the school called
McCabe to tell him that the boy had been admitted. McCabe, who had
previously fought hard to get him in, told them sadly to forget it,
that he'd been expelled. He was the fourth student McCabe expelled
during his first year, and two were not invited back.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the incoming K-1 class looked good. And McCabe spent the
summer working the phones--reducing the school's remaining debts;
collecting the still-unpaid tuition bills that turn his face bright
red; and brainstorming Newbridge's long-term future. Try to just keep
the K-8 growing? Merge with another school? Lobby a local college to
make Newbridge its lab school?</TE>
<TE>   But before that--before 10 eighth graders graduated on June
14--there was one more Newbridge tradition to introduce. In a raffle,
one graduate won the chance to be Head of School for a day.</TE>
<TE>   On the last day of classes McCabe drove the lucky kid to see
Newbridge benefactor Michael Segal, who was working part-time on
development and special projects for Harvard-Westlake. The young man
told the retail mogul what a good experience he'd had at Newbridge,
then asked him to repeat his four-figure donation to the Santa Monica
school. He looked around at Harvard-Westlake's scholastic splendor
and said, "Mr. Segal, all schools need help. Not just big ones like
this one."</TE>
<TE>   Segal, trying hard not to laugh, agreed. Then the boy turned to
Pat McCabe and said, "OK, that's one down. Only 159 more calls to
go."</TE>

<HD>Rhythm and Ouds</HD>
<DH>Class Is in Session for World Music in Highland Park</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NELSON HANDEL</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Walk down the main drag in the mostly Latino, working-class
neighborhood of Highland Park on a quiet night, and you might hear a
most incongruous sound: the droning of an Indian sitar. Or a strum on
a Middle Eastern oud. Or the breathy call of the Bulgarian kaval
flute. Follow the music and you'll discover the rehabilitated
storefront that houses one of L.A.'s most unusual and inspired
grass-roots endeavors, the Sangeet School of World Music and Dance.
"We're committed to making creative world music--the music of India,
Africa, the Middle East and Latin America--available to everyone,"
says founder and artistic director Paul Livingstone. "This is world
music in the 'hood."</LD>
<LD>   They speak their own secret language at Sangeet. When the melody
from an Armenian duduk meets the rhythmic strumming of a Bolivian
charango, you have what the gang at Sangeet like to call a "shplang."
"Shplang is the sound of instruments from different cultures coming
together in one place at the same time," Livingstone explains with a
mischievous smile. And if that sound reaches a transcendent place
where musician and audience get lost together for a sublime moment,
well, then, they say at Sangeet, "that crowd be glangin'."</LD>
<TE>   Livingston, a sitarist and player of various "world" guitars with
an MFA from CalArts, founded Sangeet nearly five years ago to provide
classes in traditional music and dance. Instructors include
L.A.-based master musicians from around the world along with
homegrown artists, some of them veterans of programs such as that
offered by CalArts' world music department. Like any idealistic young
nonprofit arts group, Sangeet struggles to survive, subsisting on
fund-raisers, $25 membership fees and contributions from private
foundations. The space is decorated with Oriental rugs and Indian
wall hangings. There is also a dazzling panoply of instruments whose
names make their own music--surdo, darabukka, tanpura, djembe--and an
ambience that shouts that life lived within sound is glangin' good
fun.</TE>
<TE>   Classes (and periodic concerts) run from classical Indian
modalities to Brazilian percussion to Guinean kora. In World Drumming
for Youth and Children, kids ages 3-12 converge on Saturday mornings
to learn the rhythms of the planet. "My 7-year-old son loves it,"
says psychotherapist Brenda Varda. "It's the joy of drumming, but
it's also about listening, and how a group works together. And he's
getting a truly L.A. experience, the cultures and rhythms of the
city."</TE>
<TE>   "Sangeet's a treasure for this area," says Highland Park resident
Julia Hernandez. "It's something you'd expect to find on the Westside
or in Hollywood." Neighbor Patricia Parra agrees. "Sangeet adds to
the wide range of cultural diversity here. It's a part of our family
now."</TE>
<TE>   "We all live on the same planet," says Livingstone, by way of
explaining the philosophy that guides the school and its bonds with
Highland Park. "There is nothing 'not mine' or 'not yours' about
music from another culture. We're finding the commonalities where
music can just be music."</TE>

<LD>Once, children had piano lessons and ballet class. Now there's Fairy
School. The eight-week sessions led by "Fairy Glimmer'' (a.k.a.
Sheryl Cancellieri) at Creative Space in the Larchmont area teach 4-
to-7-year-olds the finer points of pixiedom, including wand and wing
making. Lesson one: "We don't want to be annoying fairies. We want to
be victorious fairies." We stopped in for a little impish fun.</LD>

<DH>The Garden at Il Cielo Is Known for Romance. But How's the
Food?</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>S. IRENE VIRBILA</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As of Oct. 16, S. Irene Virbila's commentary and reporting will move
to the paper's newly redesigned Food section. This is her last review
for the Magazine. Coverage of Entertaining will continue in these
pages.</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<LD>   Everybody talks about how romantic the garden at Il Cielo is, with
its twinkling lights and secluded setting. Located on a quiet stretch
of Burton Way in Beverly Hills, it's close to several high-end
boutiques--Pratesi (Italian sheets), Christian Louboutin (Parisian
shoes) and the exclusive vintage clothing store Lily et
Cie--positioned to lure the ladies who lunch. Until recently, I
hadn't heard anyone say a thing about the food. Il Cielo never
warranted a spot in any foodie's address book, though there was a big
to-do a few years back when neighbors wanted to close down the garden
because the noise was disturbing them.</LD>
<TE>   Like Orso or Le Dome, both of which have been around forever, Il
Cielo had its regulars and existed outside of trends and change. Then
in 1999, Il Cielo's owner, Pasquale Vericella, hired Vittorio
Lucariello away from Primi, Piero Selvaggio's now-shuttered
restaurant, where the young Italian chef had made a splash cooking
refined southern Italian dishes. In L.A., where northern Italian
cuisine reigns supreme, Lucariello's light and flavorful dishes from
the Amalfi coast and his native Naples were a revelation.</TE>
<TE>   I wanted to see what Lucariello would do at Il Cielo on his own.
Months after he arrived, though, he'd barely had any effect on Il
Cielo's stolid menu. My meal wasn't particularly good, and certainly
not interesting, which left me puzzled. Why hire a talented chef if
you're not going to let him cook? It seemed a waste, and I didn't
think Lucariello would stay long. This food didn't come close to what
he'd been cooking at Primi.</TE>
<TE>   Recently, I looked at Il Cielo's menu again. He's finally had the
chance to write his own menu. Optimistic, I set off for Il Cielo. But
while the ideas are Lucariello's, the execution leaves a lot to be
desired. Is he even in the kitchen? That night he isn't, my server
tells me. For my second visit, I make sure Lucariello is scheduled to
be there that night.</TE>
<TE>   Even so, the meal is mixed. The beer batter coating fresh calamari
is greasy, and the "zesty" aioli tastes more like Thousand Island
dressing. Tomato soup garnished with basil leaves reminds me of V8
juice: it's the quality of the tomatoes. A special salad combines
lobster, fig, fennel and asparagus, but none of the ingredients seem
to have much reason to be together.</TE>
<TE>   Pork tenderloin with farro salad and grape sounds interesting, but
the meat is very dry, and the dish is presented unattractively. My
grouper is smothered in those same generic-tasting tomatoes and
vegetables, and whole striped bass with fennel is so overcooked that
it has the texture of Kleenex. The mashed potatoes that come with it
taste old. What is going on?</TE>
<TE>   I'm wondering, again, if Lucariello really is there that night,
when the chef strolls through the dining room and recognizes us as
patrons from his days at Primi. Would our meal have been any
different if he'd realized earlier that we were there?</TE>
<TE>   Just when I think I have a fix on Il Cielo, disappointed more that
the talented 30-year-old Lucariello has let down southern Italian
cooking, I go back for one more meal. This time the food is
wonderful--two stars at the very least.</TE>
<TE>   We begin with burrata pugliese, fresh mozzarella with a heart of
cream perched on feathery frisee and accented with olives and salted
red radishes. Carpaccio, in this case warm Angus filet strewn with
the prettiest little lima beans, peas and diced potatoes, is drizzled
with a lively celery-lemon dressing. It's one of the best versions
I've had. Inch-wide rigatoni, cooked al dente, are sauced with peas
and bacon that's both soft and crisp, plus a lashing of hot chiles.
Wonderful.</TE>
<TE>   Risotto with braised veal cheeks is marvelous, too. It's topped
with chunks of melting tender veal cheeks, really more like a main
course surrounded with a perfect risotto flecked with vegetables in a
rich and gelatinous broth. Even something as potentially dull as
tomato stuffed with shrimp is unusually well-conceived--rosy little
shrimp and delicate artichoke quarters cloaked in mustard sauce and
stuffed into a yellow tomato. Now this is the kind of cooking I
remember from Primi!</TE>
<TE>   Cutting into a golden free-range chicken breast reveals sweet,
milky ricotta, set off beautifully by a slightly sweet Pinot Grigio
sauce studded with raisins. This time the branzino (striped bass) is
fileted tableside, and tastes moist and fresh. It's even better with
a little of the deep green parsley and olive oil sauce drizzled over
it. The other fish lover at my table ordered Lake Superior whitefish,
a special, strewn with baby clams out of the shell in a white wine
sauce. Long-boned little lamb chops arrive a bit raw, easily
corrected with another minute under the broiler, and nicely
accompanied by a rough puree of celery root and a Barbaresco sauce
embellished with candied fruit.</TE>
<TE>   Will the real Il Cielo please step forward?</TE>
<TE>   The wine list has needed overhauling for years, and the restaurant
could use serious wineglasses if it's going to charge these high
markups. That said, I do like that our waiter asks with no nuance at
all whether we would prefer tap or bottled water.</TE>
<TE>   The garden is lovely, but if you're ever seated in the dining
room, it's hard not to notice the kitschy "romantic" decor complete
with badly painted cherubs on the ceiling, tchotchkes everywhere,
swaths of fabric and garlands of Christmas lights encased in
netting--and ivy and bougainvillea. The large garden room, open only
on busy nights, has a retractable roof that opens like L'Orangerie's,
but the entire decor could use some refurbishing.</TE>
<TE>   Desserts mysteriously improved, too, on that last visit. I loved
the cannoli filled with a pastry cream and dotted with cherries and
served with amarena ice cream. But Lucariello won my heart with his
creme brulee, a mound of custard on the plate encased in caramelized
sugar and strewn with sugared rose petals. If that's not romantic, I
don't know what is.</TE>
<TE>   From this last meal, it's clear Lucariello hasn't lost any of his
skills. If he can be disciplined enough to keep that kind of cooking
coming every night, Il Cielo stands a chance of gaining more
recognition for what's on the table than who's in the garden.</TE>

<LD>You might not sense a great yearning in California's collective
unconscious for car antenna balls. But it's there--just ask Playa del
Rey entrepreneurs Maria Losch, 30, and her musician husband Scott
Peterson, 32, who unleashed their demented collection of
anthropomorphic Goof Balls on the roadways early this year. The cast
of characters includes two dog-collared punks (your choice of mohawk
or spiked coif), a masked "Canni-Ball" homage to Hannibal Lecter and
a slouch-hatted smoker. In the pipeline are a devil and a
mullet-head, which Losch says is "having hair issues right now."
Losch says negotiations are pending for an Ozzy Osbourne goth ball.
The novelty gimcracks retail for $3 to $4 and sell at Hot Topic and
Tower Records, as well as online. "We get orders from all different
states," says Losch. "But the biggest appetite for antenna balls is
[in] the Inland Empire and Northern California. Maybe it's just
'cause we drive a lot out here."</LD>
<TE>   Losch estimates sales at 10,000 units a month and says customers
have included members from Rob Zombie's band and the Offspring.
"Kelly Osbourne has a mohawk one on her Mercedes SUV," adds Losch.
Then there's Losch's mom, Yueh-Chai Loomer. "She's crazy," says
Losch. "She went and bought three of those fake [car] antennas and
she has three lined up on the back window. She was like, 'We have to
promote our products.'" There's also the street cred factor. "When my
mom and her husband are driving," says Losch, "since they have the
punk ones, young kids give them the thumbs up, like, 'you're cool.' "</TE>

<LD>Paul Frank's first fashion successes were like early Beatles
hits--cheeky, packed with gently satiric humor and enthusiastically
embraced by (mostly) girls and their smart alecky older sisters.</LD>
<LD>   But when the Newport Beach-based designer began brainstorming
ideas for men's threads in 1999, he made a choice that would give a
music industry executive heart palpitations: The man made his proven
star scarce on the new project. Paul Frank Mens Department offers few
pieces featuring Julius, the pie-eared cartoon chimp who has made
millions of dollars for Paul Frank Industries and adorns most Paul
Frank wear, from T-shirts to bikini tops.</LD>
<LD>   The Mens Department designs instead salute a landscape that's
cartoonish in a different way. It's called rock 'n' roll. Frank
painted archetypal rock imagery--vintage guitars, crusty amps,
distortion pedals, and so forth--then silk-screened the designs onto
T-shirts, V-neck sweaters and button-down shirts in a pop art graphic
strategy worthy of early Velvet Underground impresario Andy Warhol.</LD>
<TE>   Music is a way of life as well as an aesthetic for Frank, who also
plays guitar in his garage band, the Moseleys. Many items in his
men's line, sold in stores such as Bloomingdales and Urban
Outfitters, are inspired by thrift shop clothes, an aesthetic dear to
anybody who has ever cruised the punk scene. Frank looked at thrift
fashions worn by his employees and other hip kids and came up with
the secondhand sizzle of his Western-themed pieces--shirts, jacket,
even a plaid entry dubbed Old Man Pants. "We research thrift clothes
and update them, but it's not about flashy fabrics. A lot of it is
about designing a better pocket."</TE>
<TE>   Cro-Magnon macho rock posturing isn't part of Frank's scene. "I
don't sit there with a piece of paper with two columns labeled
'girls' colors' and 'guys' colors.' That's not how I think. I'm the
guy who wore a pink alligator shirt in junior high. In high school I
wore pink Converse high tops or pink pleated pants. I was just trying
to be like [rock band] the Stray Cats."</TE>

<LD>THE DIG TREE: A True Story of Bravery, Insanity, and the Race to
Discover Australia's Wild Frontier, By Sarah Murgatroyd, Broadway
Books, $24.95</LD>
<LD>   For a great read, for a history lesson you didn't know you needed
and for a fascinating probe of what can come of greed, idiocy, valor,
good luck and bad timing in the middle of a large, empty and
unfriendly continent, step this way, please, to Sarah Murgatroyd's
first book.</LD>
<LD>   "The Dig Tree" is about an 1860-61 expedition that was supposed to
be the first to cross Australia overland, south to north. The tree of
the title plays a role so pivotal and excruciating that no novelist
would dare put it on a page. Yet the story, even though I knew it
would end badly, kept me up reading until 2 a.m. one night. The book
is everything the expedition wasn't: shrewdly paced, thoroughly
researched and over too soon.</LD>
<TE>   Here is Murgatroyd describing Menindee, an outpost at the desert's
edge on the banks of the Darling River: "As the summer heat melts the
landscape into a quivering canvas of deception, the only solid point
of reference is found around the riverbank, where lines of river red
gums stand like sentinels guarding the precious water of the
Darling.... To stare across the dunes, screwing up your eyes against
the dust and the sun, is like gazing at an overexposed photograph.
Only rain will restore the balance."</TE>
<TE>   To enjoy the book, it's not necessary to know much about
Australia, except that in this part of the 19th century--as the Civil
War was beginning in the U.S.--its entrepreneurs and provincial
politicians were vying over where the first transcontinental
communication cable would be laid. Heavy bets were made that the
cable, and economic development, would follow the route of the first
successful north-south expedition.</TE>
<TE>   At the book's center is Robert O'Hara Burke, a transplanted
Irishman chosen by a committee of Melbourne's most important men to
lead this expedition north to the Gulf of Carpentaria. Burke was
spectacularly unqualified for the job, having been a policeman for
most of his career, but he had allies in the right places.</TE>
<TE>   The result was that an epic task and a lavish budget (including
imported camels) were handed to a man whose judgment and endurance
truly blurred the line between brave and foolish.</TE>
<TE>   From the beginning, big things went wrong. Burke squandered
resources and made impetuous decisions that ultimately cost several
men their lives, yet succeeded in crossing the continent once and
almost twice before his luck ran out. (This success, however, was
thanks in large part to the skills of navigator William John Wills
and the charity of Aborigines Burke viewed as inferior.) The
committee back in Melbourne had several chances to stop the trouble
from deepening, but at every turn did too little too late.</TE>
<TE>   But this story soon widens to include much more than one overblown
personality. Drawing from diaries and her own travels along the
route, Murgatroyd deftly sketches half a dozen expedition members and
their changing environs, along with the concurrent adventures of
Burke's far more competent rival, John McDouall Stuart.</TE>
<TE>   Because Australia and North America have so much in common as
upstart British offshoot societies (awesome landscapes, idealized
frontiersmen and decimated native peoples, to begin with), any tale
of old Australia also works as a western in thin disguise, and gets
you thinking about more universal themes.</TE>
<TE>   And thanks to the strange characters and events of this particular
fractured journey--in the last, desperate days, the expedition's
beleaguered men are in three parties, starving and groping through
the wilderness for one another in the shadow of Mt. Hopeless--we have
something more than a B-movie western. We have John Ford, Ken Burns
and the Coen brothers, metaphorically together at last amid butchered
camels and spinifex plants.</TE>
<TE>   In Murgatroyd's expert telling, everything good, bad and weird
that happened among the men of Burke's expedition hints wisely about
human folly and open space everywhere.</TE>
<TE>   The worst thing about this book is that it is the author's last.
Murgatroyd, an England-born radio journalist who moved to Australia
in 1993 and began the Dig Tree project in '99, fended off cancer
throughout the researching and writing of this book and lived to see
its publication in Australia. She died on March 26, just 34 years
old.</TE>

<TE>   CALIFORNIA WINE COUNTRY, By Randy Leffingwell (foreword by Francis
Ford Coppola), Voyageur Press, $29.95</TE>
<TE>   Here's a coffee table book you may be tempted to lug along in the
car.</TE>
<TE>   Along with its evocative color photography--beyond the usual
manicured green vineyards, Leffingwell is an enthusiastic student of
winery architecture--this book is full of service information,
delivered in a way that works, whether you're an oenophile or not.</TE>
<TE>   Best tidbit from the historical section in front: Back in the bad
old days in Massachusetts, Leffingwell notes, the adulterers weren't
the only ones compelled to wear letters in public. The excessive
drinkers had to wear big D's.</TE>

<TE>   BACK ROADS TO THE CALIFORNIA COAST, By Earl Thollander and Herb
McGrew,Sasquatch Books, $21.95</TE>
<TE>   Before summer recedes completely from memory, this book, published
in June, is worth a mention. Illustrated with Thollander's charming
ink-and-watercolor pictures, it sets itself a simple task: tracing 15
routes that link inland sights with likely spots along the coast.
Among the chapters: the Salton Sea to Oceanside; Palmdale to
Carpinteria via Ojai; Bakersfield to Morro Bay.</TE>
<TE>   The authors aren't interested in proving their cool to
anyone--they're just Herb and Earl on the road, one a retired
psychiatrist and part-time farmer, the other a veteran illustrator in
his 70s. (Thollander died in 2001 after completing illustrations for
this book.)</TE>
<TE>   The book's hand-drawn maps are helpful; there's not much
information on restaurants or lodgings.</TE>

<HD>Once Considered a Problem, Traveling Solo Now Has
Advantages</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ARTHUR FROMMER</AU>

<LD>There's a growing consensus that single people should travel alone.
In seminar after seminar, arguments are made that unaccompanied
adults become more sensitive to the local culture and language, and
that they are more likely to meet people when they travel without a
friend of their own background.</LD>
<LD>   Though I've been married for most of my life, my profession as a
travel writer has required that I travel alone for large parts of the
year. And though I missed my wife, I value the rewards of solitary
travel: time to ponder, reflect, absorb and "listen" to foreign
lifestyles.</LD>
<LD>   But what about when women travel alone? There are fewer problems
than there used to be. People no longer stare at a woman dining
alone. Countries such as Spain and Turkey no longer treat the
solitary female traveler as if she were a libertine. With the
increasing participation of women in business travel, attitudes have
improved toward solo women in almost all parts of the world, other
than in some rigid societies of the Middle East. That's not to say
that a woman tourist should go strolling the docks of Liverpool.
There are obviously common-sense limits to observe. But by keeping to
safe areas and adopting normal precautions, many women have found
that it is sometimes advantageous to travel alone.</LD>
<TE>   What problems remain? The big bugaboo is the single-room
supplement, which can't be overcome; it is part of the economics of
hotel-keeping or cruise-operating that most rooms and cabins are
capable of being occupied by two people. Therefore, the single
traveler may pay the same amount for that room as two persons would
pay. The solution? Bargaining. Just as many Americans have learned
that hotel prices are sometimes negotiable, a single traveler should
be conscious of his or her right to request a better price and to
"shop around" until such a rate is secured.</TE>
<TE>   And might I suggest that single travelers consider the various
learning vacations and volunteer vacations that are currently given
such prominence on the Internet? On a volunteer vacation, where
people are focused on a goal outside themselves--for Earthwatch, say,
or Habitat for Humanity--the fact that one is traveling alone and not
as a couple becomes unimportant.</TE>
<TE>   Beyond that, the "alternative traveler" usually stays in a dorm.
On an educational trip, like an Elderhostel study week or at foreign
universities, the same applies.</TE>
<TE>   If you feel you must travel with a companion (but don't have one),
remember that both commercial and nonprofit services exist to aid
you. Jens Jurgen's long-established Travel Companion Exchange, (631)
454-0880 or www.travelcompanions.com, enables singles to advertise
inexpensively and effectively for a travel partner.</TE>
<TE>   One other solution? Seek out a travel companion, perhaps using the
above service, but hedge your bets. Tell the prospective companion
that sharing costs is your main aim and that you will be sightseeing
and dining alone, unless the two of you prove especially congenial. I
know someone who has done that on numerous occasions and enjoyed the
best of both worlds.</TE>

<HD>Studying the Food Chain in Chiang Mai</HD>
<DH>From the market to cooking class, tourists poach some
culinary secrets</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JERRY V. HAINES</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>CHIANG MAI, Thailand</DL>
<LD>Oh, this was my kind of school. Instead of pencils, we had spatulas.
Instead of blackboards, we had black woks. Instead of notebooks,
noodles.</LD>
<LD>   As at most schools, we learned much from our teachers' lectures,
learned more when they demonstrated and learned the most when we did
the work ourselves, however badly. But unlike most classrooms, the
Chiang Mai Thai Cookery School let us eat our lessons. We graduated
magna cum stuffed.</LD>
<LD>   My wife, Janice, and I love to cook. She's better at it, but I
have more fun, probably because, unlike her, I am not burdened by the
belief that cooks should clean up after themselves. We've taken
cooking classes--even in tropical cuisine--at home near Washington,
D.C. But somehow one is not in the proper frame of mind to execute
tropical dishes when one must slog through snowbanks to reach class.
In Chiang Mai we had the right setting.</LD>
<TE>   This old northern Thai city has many enticements: a cuisine with
such rich, complex spices that a seemingly simple noodle dish becomes
a seminar in contrasting flavors; ancient Buddhist temples whose
golden adornments communicate sensuousness along with their
spirituality; people so welcoming that jaded visitors quickly set
aside their skepticism. And then there are the prices.</TE>
<TE>   In light of all of its cultural attractions, it seems crass to say
so, but Chiang Mai is a bargain. Two people can eat well for less
than $5. Luxurious hotel rooms are the price of a Motel 6 in the U.S.
And the dirty clothes you left with the family-operated laundry in
the morning will be ready that evening--washed, dried, ironed and
folded--for 30 baht, about 70 cents.</TE>
<TE>   Janice and I came to Chiang Mai after discovering that Bangkok was
just too much city for us. I don't regret our three days in Bangkok.
The majesty of its temples is almost greater than the human brain can
process. But the city is so crowded, so busy, so unwalkable.</TE>
<TE>   Chiang Mai is about 435 miles northwest, in the little lobe of
land squeezed between Myanmar and Laos--and it feels even farther
away. The city was founded in 1296 by King Mengrai, at the time a
prince from southern China, who gave it the name Nopburi Sri Nakorn
Ping Chiang Mai (understandably shortened to Chiang Mai, or "New
City") and put walls and a moat around it. Although its control
subsequently passed back and forth between Thais and Burmese, it
became a regional capital and the center of commerce and Buddhist
culture.</TE>
<TE>   The population is about 173,000, making it Thailand's
second-largest city. Clearly modern, the city nonetheless reveres its
ancient treasures. No high-rise construction is permitted near
temples, and the old moat has been cleaned up and improved with
fountains that keep the water moving.</TE>
<TE>   After arriving, we located the hotel we had selected through a
reservation service at the Bangkok airport. The comfortable though
plain Chiang Mai Gate Hotel is typical of what's considered mid-range
accommodations here. We paid $31 a night; some hotels and guest
houses were $5 or less but didn't have a private bath. Turns out our
bath was one of those setups where the shower stall is the entire
bathroom, which meant that, if we showered at night, we started the
next day with a disheartening walk on a wet floor.</TE>
<TE>   Such mild annoyances aside, we had grand days in Chiang Mai,
particularly when we happened upon the Chiang Mai Thai Cookery School
and signed up for a full day of English-language instruction.</TE>
<TE>   Sompon and Elizabeth Nabnian have operated this school since 1993,
offering daylong courses for casual cooks like Janice, me and our
eight classmates, each of whom seemed to find it as we did: while
strolling along the moat.</TE>
<TE>   The school (www.thaicookeryschool.com) changes menus daily, so one
could make a week of it. Students prepared six courses and got to eat
what they cooked--another bargain, considering the tuition was only
$43.21 for Janice and me. Heck, the complimentary cookbooks were
worth almost that.</TE>
<TE>   The class began with a trip to the Somphet Market, so we could
start like real Thai cooks--assuming that real Thai cooks wander
around smelling this, prodding that. Or asking dumb questions. Or
taking flash pictures of stacked bamboo shoots, muddy-looking mounds
of chili paste, baskets of marble-size miniature eggplants or snarls
of "snake beans" (imagine foot-long string beans).</TE>
<TE>   In the large, open-air hall, we saw and sniffed all the aromatic
ingredients we would be using: galangal, lemon grass, kaffir lime
leaves, turmeric, coconut, and red and green chilies in various
grades of lethality.</TE>
<TE>   A fishmonger efficiently dispatched a fish with the unglamorous
name of "serpent head" and quickly scaled and gutted it. Was it
destined to be part of the red curry with fish we would cook? Should
I have felt guilty?</TE>
<TE>   Back in the classroom each student received a wok, a saucepan, a
small propane stove, a wicked cleaver and other utensils. Our
instructors demonstrated the process of making a dish--chopping,
searing, stirring, garnishing--then watched us attempt the same.
(They were vigilant about sanitation and particularly watchful about
cross-contamination of raw and cooked food.)</TE>
<TE>   We began with a soup of chicken, lemon grass and coconut milk. In
the process we learned how to dice straw mushrooms so that they
become their own cooking thermometers, opening up as they reach the
peak of flavor. Soon the classroom--actually the dining room of a
restaurant co-owned with the school--was filled with zingy aromas. I
was tempted to dab soup behind each ear.</TE>
<TE>   Next was red curry with fish, which taught us to be attentive to
the heat of our woks, as the first commandment is: Thou shalt not
burn chili paste. Many Thai dishes start by frying the paste, whose
distinctive and intense aroma filled our lungs and assaulted our
sinuses as we passed roadside food stalls throughout the country.</TE>
<TE>   We recharged our woks and made stir-fried mushrooms with baby
corn, and then "big noodles" with pork and vegetables. By lunch break
we had four dishes, each with a distinct personality. Like the proud
parent of multiple children, I loved them all best.</TE>
<TE>   In the afternoon session, we prepared a traditional Thai green
papaya salad made from shreds of the namesake fruit, lime juice, palm
sugar, dried shrimp, high-octane chilies and some of those snake
beans, cut up bite size.</TE>
<TE>   Our only failure was the dessert, banana cake, which tasted less
like cake and more like a stiff banana-coconut pudding. Oh, well. It
was fun to make, steaming it in a banana leaf rather than baking it.</TE>
<TE>   Overall I was pleased. Usually my standard for my culinary
creations is "no one actually died." But in Chiang Mai, I would have
been willing to match some of our cooking against that of Thai
restaurants at home. For farang (Westerners), we weren't bad Thai
chefs.</TE>
<TE>   Janice and I paid attention to soul nourishment as well. Finding
Buddhist temples, or wats, is easy in Chiang Mai, as 300 are in or
near the city.</TE>
<TE>   Wat Chiang Man is the city's oldest, founded in 1296, the same
year King Mengrai established the city.</TE>
<TE>   Inside is a small crystal Buddha statue, a spiritual treasure
estimated to be 1,800 years old, set inside two sets of barred
windows and surrounded by candles and larger Buddhas. The mood in the
darkened sanctuary appropriately communicates veneration, although in
a corner of the room I saw a young monk, dressed in the traditional
orange robe, clicking away at his computer.</TE>
<TE>   Although age sets Wat Chiang Man apart, its exterior shares
typical features: stone nagas (serpents), which rear up from the
staircases; elephant themes in the statuary; chedi (spired monuments,
often containing relics); and intricate gold-covered carvings,
particularly around windows and doors and along roof lines.</TE>
<TE>   And gentle entrepreneurship. At Wat Chiang Man, Janice bought a
small basket-like cage that held two live birds, which she released
for good luck. The birds reportedly are trained to return so that
they can be caged again, sold again and released again. This may be
the perfect business: a perpetually self-restocking inventory.</TE>
<TE>   Taxi operators, a self-confident bunch, can plan a tour of Chiang
Mai's major wats. After they pointedly ask how long you expect to be
in town, they happily will take command of your schedule, guiding
your sightseeing, transporting you to restaurants and markets, and
returning you to the airport. I suspect they would be delighted to
arrange your marriage, your children's educations and your funeral
too, if you wanted.</TE>
<TE>   Although some taxis in Chiang Mai are small sedans, the vast
majority fall into three classes: samlor (bicycle-powered rickshaws),
usually operated by old guys looking so frail that I couldn't bring
myself to hire one in the 90-degree heat; motorized versions called
tuktuks because of their sputtering two-cycle engines; and the
zeelor, a red pickup with two benches mounted in its covered box.
(The human spine was not designed to withstand the forces of riding a
zeelor in stop-start Chiang Mai traffic, but we did.) Janice, our
family's designated bargainer, discovered that rates for all are
negotiable.</TE>
<TE>   A tuktuk driver talked us into a tour of the remaining major
religious sites. With its small motor screaming like a weed whacker,
the three-wheeled vehicle carried us from temple to temple along the
ancient avenues. Although I am hardly of NBA height, my head bumped
the canopy, and the only view I had was of the pavement. I felt as
though I were wearing a hat 300 sizes too large.</TE>
<TE>   We went to another school, but not as students. Our son, a visitor
to Chiang Mai years ago, encouraged us to find "Mama Nit, a little
old lady with hands of steel." She presides over a small school that
teaches traditional Asian massage.</TE>
<TE>   I have enjoyed massages at fancy resorts but was unprepared for
Baan Nit school. It had no sophisticated massage table, no New Age
music, no aromatherapy. It was a non-air-conditioned room filled with
mattresses.</TE>
<TE>   But the international corps of student masseurs and masseuses
approached their tasks with an almost spiritual intensity. A young
Costa Rican reverently ran me through a routine that seemed more like
professional wrestling than a massage at the Four Seasons. Sometimes
he lifted me, bending limbs back against themselves. But it was never
painful.</TE>
<TE>   Janice got a few minutes with Mama Nit herself before being handed
off to a young student. The venerable maestra of massage speaks
little English but does have strong, searching hands, smoothing out
muscle knots and points of stress. We left feeling refreshed, healthy
and about an inch taller. Our sessions went over an hour. The cost:
$3.57 each.</TE>
<TE>   But it was the food I loved most, especially when I wasn't cooking
it. The big open-air restaurant called Aroon Rai, for example,
specializes in northern Thai cuisine, distinguished by its use of
sticky rice, which is both side dish and utensil. I had to
eat--sorry, Mom--with my fingers. The rice came to our table hot and
moist in a tightly covered basket. I took a big pinch of it, formed
it into a ball and wrapped it around a piece of papaya salad or
curry. It got messy--I suggest packing a turmeric-colored wardrobe to
make laundry simpler--but many restaurants have sinks in the dining
room so that you can rinse your hands. Repeatedly.</TE>
<TE>   I also loved the street food. We planned big dinners at nice
sit-down restaurants, but then on our way there from our hotel, we
passed through the night food market, along the southern moat by
Chiang Mai Gate. Batter-fried fish fresh from the wok, or satay, or
prawns, or sweet little sausages distracted us. We had to eat them.
This was cultural research, after all.</TE>
<TE>   Not that everything was a winner. Sometimes we bit into something
new, stopped, looked at each other and wondered, what the heck was
that?</TE>
<TE>   But then some other scent--freshly fried Chinese doughnuts,
perhaps--would grab us. And then some hot, custard-filled dumplings.
Then we were no longer interested in that big dinner.</TE>
<TE>   On our last full day in Chiang Mai, we hired a zeelor to take us
10 miles out and up to Wat Phra That, a 14th century temple with a
commanding view of the city from its post on Doi Suthep, a mile-high
hill northwest of town. Wat Phra That has the granddaddy of naga
staircases, extending 300 steps. At the top we found a virtual wat
city: a brilliant chedi, soaring red and gold roofs, huge gold-lace
umbrellas, elephant shrines. The temples were crowded with people
bringing offerings of flowers, kneeling in devotion in the
incense-clouded sanctuaries and being blessed by monks who sprinkled
holy water on them with long-stemmed lotus flowers.</TE>
<TE>   Epilogue: We left Chiang Mai to go to Malaysia, Cambodia and
Taiwan, and now we're home. The pictures we took are a big hit with
friends. But I'm not engrossed in the photo album as much as I am in
cookbooks from the school.</TE>
<TE>   "Look at this," I'll say. "On the fifth day they make red curry
with duck." For me, it's always back-to-school time.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A standard joke told by cruise directors at welcome-aboard parties
is, "You came aboard as passengers, and after a week of dining you'll
go off as cargo." Although nearly everyone laughs, weight gain is a
fear that many cruise passengers face. After all, eating is a major
pleasure of a cruise vacation, and aboard most ships there are three
full-service meals a day, plus midmorning snacks, afternoon tea, and
midnight and 24-hour buffets, not to mention assorted grills and ice
cream service.</LD>
<LD>   Despite the abundance of food, passengers can minimize the amount
of weight they gain on vacation by eating low-calorie, low-fat spa
and vegetarian options, which are standard on many shipboard menus.
And they can exercise excess calories away. Aboard the newer, larger
ships, there are more exercise options: pools, spas and exercise
areas with treadmills, stair machines, and jogging and walking
tracks.</LD>
<LD>   But what if you have special dietary needs, such as diabetic,
gluten-free or lactose-free, kosher or perhaps spicy Asian
vegetarian?</LD>
<TE>   Even the large ships will accommodate some special diets, such as
low salt, low fat, low sugar or vegetarian, but your chances of
getting a diet that requires special preparation--Asian vegetarian,
gluten-free, macrobiotic, lactose-free, fructose-free and diabetic
menus that even have desserts--are better aboard smaller and, in most
cases, more expensive ships, such as those of Seabourn Cruise Line,
with advance notice.</TE>
<TE>   Toni Neumeister, vice president of food and beverage for Crystal
Cruise Lines, offers suggestions for passengers requiring special
diets:</TE>
<TE>   * When searching for a cruise, contact the lines to ask whether
they can handle your diet.</TE>
<TE>   * Arrange for special diets through your travel agent if you are
booking at least 30 days in advance. Usually the line's onboard guest
services department will contact passengers to learn their dietary
requirements and purchase the food, prepare the menus and notify the
ship. In some cases, special food items may have to be flown to the
vessel. Passengers may have to pay extra for the product, shipping
and inspection fees.</TE>
<TE>   * Make sure your dietary requirements are in the record when you
book passage. Then, when boarding, check with the dining room maitre
d' to make sure kitchen personnel are aware of it.</TE>
<TE>   * Aboard the ship, contact the headwaiter in the dining room,
identifying yourself and your diet needs. If you are allergic to a
particular item, let your waiter know, since some soups or sauces
could contain that item without your knowledge. This is also true for
anyone traveling with a small baby. Before sailing, check with the
line to see if they will provide infant formula. And be aware that
there are differences between U.S. and European formulas.</TE>
<TE>   * If you plan to eat one night in an alternative restaurant
instead of the main dining room, notify the headwaiter ahead of time
and, if it's possible, he will arrange for your dietary items to be
available.</TE>
<TE>   * Most important is communication with the wait staff. If you ask
the wait person if he or she speaks English and the reply is, "Si, un
poco," find another waiter who speaks your language. Then dine at the
same table with the same waiter throughout the cruise.</TE>
<TE>   On premium lines the staff in all restaurants should make an
effort to accommodate dietary requests. Again, notify the guest
services department well before sailing.</TE>
<TE>   Orient Lines, a division of NCL, has separate kosher kitchens
aboard its ships. The line is offering a series of kosher cruises on
the Crown Odyssey and Marco Polo. Offered on western Mediterranean
and Scandinavian itineraries between April and October 2003, the
package features menus prepared by kosher chef Malcolm Green,
lectures, Jewish-oriented shore excursions and performances by
renowned cantors. A supplemental fee from $175 to $565 will cover
meals on board and ashore, tours and pre- and post-sailing stays and
transfers.</TE>
<TE>   Kosher menus are available on a number of ships, including First
European Cruises, which requires three weeks' notice to serve frozen
meals on trays for an additional charge of $20 a day for lunch and
dinner. First European also offers vegetarian, low-salt, low-fat
dishes with no advance notice, although it helps to mention important
dietary restrictions when booking.</TE>
<TE>   Luxury lines, such as Crystal Cruises, are able to offer more
variety on a kosher menu. Crystal buys frozen kosher dinners from a
supplier in London, but also offers a "kosher-style" menu prepared
with separate pots and pans in a separate part of the galley.
Passengers can use the same plates, silverware and glassware
throughout the cruise if they request it. The plates will be new upon
the guests' arrival. Kosher wines are also available. Aboard Crystal
ships, kosher meals can only be served in the dining room.</TE>
<TE>   For more information, contact a travel agent or Orient Lines,
(800) 333-7300, www.orientlines.com; First European Cruises, (888)
983-8767, www.first-european.com; Crystal Cruises, (800) 820-6663,

<HD>Esalen Builds a Bathhouse Befitting Its New Age Spirit</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Compiled by Jane Engle</AU>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Goodbye, funky redwood tubs. Hello, $6-million bathhouse.</LD>
<LD>   Esalen Institute, the 40-year-old New Age retreat in Big Sur known
for its seminars, massages and hot mineral springs, has reopened its
cliff-side baths in a new stone-and-concrete structure. The original
baths, in a building that dated to the 1930s, were destroyed four
years ago by a storm-driven landslide. Three redwood hot tubs were
used in the interim.</LD>
<LD>   The new bathhouse, perched about 50 feet above the Pacific, is a
two-level structure with clerestory windows, verandas and sandstone
floors warmed by the springs. It can hold about 60 bathers in seven
tubs. Some tubs are outdoors; some are covered. One has a lift for
wheelchair users, project manager Jerry Parks said.</LD>
<TE>   So far only overnight guests are being allowed in the baths,
Executive Director Andy Nusbaum said. But starting Nov. 15, visitors
can use them for very limited hours, 1 a.m. to 3 a.m., by paying a
$20 fee, he added.</TE>
<TE>   Esalen guests can stay on a room-and-board plan that includes
meals, classes and bath access for $150 per person per night ($170
starting Nov. 1) on weekends; weekday rates are lower. Or they can
attend residential seminar programs of varying lengths that begin at
$485 for a weekend ($545 starting Nov. 1), with lower rates for
bunk-bed rooms. For information, call (831) 667-3005 or visit
www.esalen.org.</TE>
<TE>   The private, nonprofit institute is auctioning off the three
interim redwood tubs Nov. 2. Bids are due by Nov. 1; e-mail
info@esalencampaign.org.</TE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Participants in a new tour of San Diego get a taste of military life
at the Marine Corps Recruit Depot.</LD>
<LD>   "Get off my bus! And you better do it quickly!" a drill instructor
orders after he boards their amphibious tour vehicle inside the gate.
Tourists are required to stand in line, on painted yellow footprints,
while their IDs are checked before they can visit the depot's museum,
obstacle course and other areas.</LD>
<LD>   The stop at the depot, which administers basic training to
recruits from across the Western U.S., is part of the 2 1/2-hour Tour
of Patriotism run by Old Town Trolley Tours. Riding SEAL sea-and-land
vehicles, visitors splash and roll past the North Island Naval Air
Station, the Navy submarine base along Point Loma and other sites
related to the city's military.</LD>
<TE>   The tour leaves at 9:15 a.m. Tuesdays from Old Town. Tickets are
$24 for adults, $12 for ages 4 to 12. Reservations are required. Call
(619) 298-8687.</TE>

<HD>Airline to End Movie Fee; Vouchers Will Be Limited</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>American Airlines will eliminate its $5 charge for in-flight
entertainment in the U.S., Canada, Mexico and the Caribbean starting
Nov. 1. Instead, coach passengers will pay $2 to buy a personal
headset that they can reuse. (Entertainment continues to be free for
non-coach passengers on these flights and for all classes on
international flights.) Spokesman Todd Burke said the move will save
the cash-strapped airline about $6 million per year in labor and
reprovisioning costs.</LD>
<LD>   In another change, American has reduced vouchers to passengers who
volunteer to give up their seats on overbooked flights. Such
vouchers, formerly $100 to $1,000, are now capped at $300 in most
cases, Burke said. Also, meal vouchers will not be given to those
stranded by delayed or canceled flights unless an overnight stay is
involved and "the reason for the delay is within our control," Burke
said. The previous policy varied by airport, he added.</LD>

<LD>Revolutionary War buffs have a new place to visit, thanks to the Fort
Montgomery State Historic Site, which opens today on the bluffs above
the Hudson River four miles south of the West Point military academy.
The 14-acre area has an interpretive trail linking the foundations of
fortifications involved in a 1777 battle in which British forces
overwhelmed the American defenders, killing 70 Americans. It is open
daily through October and then will reopen April 15. Admission is
free. (845) 786-2701, www.nysparks.com (expected to be posted soon)

<HD>Basketball Museum Is Something to Shoot For</HD>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Hoops fans visiting Boston or Hartford, Conn., might consider a
detour to Springfield, Mass., where the Naismith Memorial Basketball
Hall of Fame reopened last weekend as a $45-million high-tech museum.</LD>
<LD>   The striking new building, with a nine-story spherical dome
lighted by hundreds of colored bulbs, is about twice as big as the
previous one, spokesman Howie Davis said. It's part of a $100-million
redevelopment of the Connecticut Riverfront area.</LD>
<LD>   Besides viewing tributes to more than 200 Hall of Famers, visitors
can shoot baskets, play sportscaster (and record their play-by-play
narratives), match wits with professional coaches' calls and learn
about the history of the game. Among more than 900 artifacts is an
1891 list of basketball rules with handwritten notes by James
Naismith (1861-1939), who is credited with inventing the sport that
year.</LD>
<TE>   The museum, a half-hour drive north of Hartford and two hours from
Boston, is open daily; hours vary. Admission is $15 for adults, $10
for ages 5-15, free for children younger than 5. (877) 446-6752,

<HD>Trip Insurer's Policy Takes Care of Business</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Compiled by Jane Engle</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Access America is selling trip cancellation insurance that covers
employees who are terminated or whose firms are merged or acquired by
another, among other business reasons. It does not routinely cover
workers whose bosses deny them time off to take a trip. Although some
cruise and tour operators allow customers to purchase
"cancel-for-any-reason" coverage, general trip insurers typically do
not cover business reasons for canceling a trip.</LD>
<LD>   The Access America Navigator policy also provides concierge
services, such as arranging restaurant reservations and golf tee
times. The cost varies by age and trip. For instance, a person age 31
to 60 would pay a $153 premium to cover a trip costing $2,001 to
$2,500, a spokesman said. For information, see your travel agent or
call (800) 284-8300.</LD>

<HD>Syrah and Siesta in Baja's Wine Country</HD>
<DH>Drinking in the charms of quiet vineyards and a restful B&amp;B
in the Guadalupe Valley</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KAREN E. KLEIN</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>FRANCISCO ZARCO, Mexico</DL>
<LD>"At the stop sign adjacent to the Unidad Medica Familiar, turn
right," I read aloud, grateful for directions in the absence of
street signs.</LD>
<LD>   My husband, Steve, steered down a rutted dirt road, turned right
at Family Medical Unit, passed a church and a tiny grocery store,
then traversed a hill. Suddenly Adobe Guadalupe appeared, an oasis
among vineyards.</LD>
<LD>   A long driveway led toward a beautiful Mediterranean-style
courtyard graced with an enormous fountain, the winery's six guest
rooms somewhere beyond. We wandered into the large kitchen and found
the staff awaiting us--with two glasses of wine.</LD>
<TE>   The liquid refreshment was our reward for making the long, hot
drive into the Valle de Guadalupe, or Guadalupe Valley, a wine region
in Baja California about half an hour northeast of Ensenada. The
sunny, dry Mediterranean climate--similar to that of Southern
California's inland valleys--is ideal for grapes, and the vineyards
here have earned the respect of wine aficionados, though they're
overlooked as a tourist destination.</TE>
<TE>   Valle de Guadalupe is big--about two-thirds the size of Napa
Valley--though during our visit last month we never worried about
long lines, overdevelopment or snooty people. This place feels
smaller and more personal. Many tours are conducted by the
winemakers, with tastings in their homes or offices.</TE>
<TE>   But before we could indulge in the rough, unspoiled charm of the
valley, we had to get there.</TE>
<TE>   The low point of our Saturday morning drive came near La Jolla,
where the crawl on southbound Interstate 5 slowed to a stop. By the
time we reached the border, bought mandatory Mexican car insurance
and followed Mexico Toll Route 1 to Ensenada, it was after 2 p.m. A
cruise ship was in port, and hot spots such as Hussong's Cantina and
Papas &amp; Beer were thronged, so we walked to El Palmar and enjoyed a
quiet lunch of fish tacos and fresh halibut filet.</TE>
<TE>   Two-lane Highway 3 led northeast over rocky hills and into the
Guadalupe Valley, where the glasses of Merlot welcomed us to the
Adobe. After we were shown to our lovely guest room, Steve cranked up
the air-conditioning and settled down for a siesta. (The nightly room
rate was $125 plus tax and an unexpected 10% credit-card processing
fee.)</TE>
<TE>   More hot than tired, I left for the pool, whose tile design
includes an octopus holding a wineglass. I found similar whimsical
touches all around the property. A water tank in the vineyard is
painted in swirls of maroon and gold and festooned with angel wings.</TE>
<TE>   Co-owner Don Miller and his two Weimaraners greeted me by the
pool. He and wife Tru built the Adobe in 1998 and moved here from
Orange County, harvesting grapes for the first time in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   When Steve came out for a swim, Don told us that our fellow guests
were part of a group celebrating a birthday that night. We had made
reservations for dinner at the Adobe ($50 per person, tip included,
but still subject to the 10% credit-card fee). Rather than crash the
party, we tried nearby Restaurante Laja, where the food would be
"five star," Miller said.</TE>
<TE>   "Be on time, and don't wear T-shirts," he warned.</TE>
<TE>   Steve and I set out on the bumpy, unmarked roads again, jostling
along a winding path lined with garbage and tree branches strung with
barbed wire to deter roaming horses. At a nondescript adobe house, a
hand-scrawled sign announced: Restaurante Laja. Two scruffy dogs
trotted across a tiled porch to greet us on the dirt lot.</TE>
<TE>   "This place serves five-star cuisine?" I asked with a laugh. Steve
shrugged.</TE>
<TE>   An hour later we were eating more than crow: fat, buttery sea
scallops with caramelized lemon peel; fresh tomato and basil salad
with sheep's milk ricotta; lamb grilled rare with mushrooms; and a
crostata topped with fresh peaches and honey-vanilla bean ice cream.
The food was incredible. The airy, wood-beamed interior was as
pleasant a setting as I've experienced anywhere.</TE>
<TE>   Laura Reinert (the "La" in the restaurant's name) and her husband,
chef Jair Tellez ("Ja"), mentioned during our three-hour prix fixe
dinner that they always dreamed of opening a place near Jair's
hometown, Tijuana. (Jair trained at Daniel in New York and cooked at
the Four Seasons in Mexico City.) Laja is only a year old, but
already it draws tourists and well-heeled residents from all over
Baja, and we understood why.</TE>
<TE>   The next morning we had our choice of omelets, huevos rancheros or
pancakes in the Adobe dining room. Then we strolled through the
Millers' rows of merlot, syrah and grenache vines and hiked to a
chapel at the edge of the property that is a shrine to the Virgin of
Guadalupe.</TE>
<TE>   The rest of the day we toured vineyards and tasted wines. At Monte
Xanic, which led the area's wine renaissance with its first
production in 1988, UC Davis-trained winemaker Hans Backoff pipes
classical music into the plant, explaining that the workers like it.</TE>
<TE>   At Vina de Liceaga, the tasting room is part of owner Eduardo
Liceaga-Campos' home. Between pourings of his Merlot Gran Reserva, he
chatted about plans to open a wine store and a 40-room inn.</TE>
<TE>   Our favorite stop of the day was the winery called Casa de Piedra.
Winemaker Hugo D'Acosta walked us through the vineyard and down into
his wine cave, where dirt floors and stone walls provide the right
humidity and temperature for French oak barrels. There he gave us a
taste of his signature wine.</TE>
<TE>   The largest winemaker in the area, L.A. Cetto, operates more like
a typical California winery, with guided tours and tastings daily.
L.A. Cetto produces 800,000 cases annually, more than all the
boutique wineries in the valley combined. The tour at Cetto was in
Spanish, however, and Steve soon tired of my halting translation.</TE>
<TE>   We ducked out early and enjoyed a lunch of burritos and
quesadillas at Campestre los Naranjos, a restaurant and picnic ground
off Highway 3.</TE>
<TE>   By the time we returned to Adobe Guadalupe, a siesta was in order.
Later in the afternoon, the temperature reached 104, so we lounged on
rafts in the cool pool, reading and chatting. Don brought out a
pitcher of margaritas and local olives and nuts.</TE>
<TE>   The birthday party guests had departed, but a San Diego couple and
their 6-year-old daughter joined us at 7 in the dining room. Dinner
wasn't quite as good as at Laja, but the corn and cauliflower soup,
salad, chicken mole and chocolate cake were tasty, and we were
treated to a different Mexican wine with each course. The
conversation at the table extended long after the dishes were cleared
and coffee was served. Sometime after 10, Steve and I finally drifted
outside for a walk in the warm night, brilliantly lighted by stars
and silent except for a mooing cow.</TE>
<TE>   The next morning I went early to Rancho Cucapa, about 10 minutes
away, for a horseback ride. The ranch, which offers lessons and trail
rides, soon will relocate its rental operation to new stables at
Adobe Guadalupe.</TE>
<TE>   During my hourlong ride, I practiced my Spanish and my riding
technique with a teacher and her student. We ended with a thrilling
gallop up a hill behind the stables.</TE>
<TE>   The Adobe staff advised us to take Highway 3 north and cross the
U.S. border at Tecate rather than in Tijuana. This time we hit no
traffic. The drive home provided a rare chance to talk about our
plans for the fall--and how our relaxing weekend had proved to be
exactly what we needed.</TE>

California.) An alert warns if a complete sample wasn't measured, and
there is a low-battery warning. The unit runs on two AA batteries,
measures 3 1/2 by 1 1/4 inches and weighs less than 2 ounces.</LD>
<LD>   AlcAlert Digital Alcohol Detector (BT5500) is $49.95 from PNI
Corp.; (888) 422-6672, www.pnicorp.com.</LD>
<TE>   Bedding down: When the gang's all there, sometimes there aren't
enough beds to go around. But the problem is solved with this
comfortable queen-size, self-inflating mattress--worth keeping in the
trunk just in case. The electric-powered integrated pump inflates the
mattress in less than a minute, and a release valve deflates it even
more quickly. The cotton-surface mattress provides as much support as
a quality bed; a control button allows you to fine-tune the firmness.
The bed rolls for storage in its own duffel. It weighs 14 pounds, so
you won't want to take this backpacking, but it's great for a car
trip.</TE>
<TE>   Ultimate Support Self-Inflating Mattress (73899) is $179.95 for
queen (also available in twin and full sizes) from Hammacher
Schlemmer; (800) 321-1484, www.hammacher.com.</TE>
<TE>   Parking spotter: Finally, a solution to the exasperating question,
Where did I park? With Brook- stone's battery-operated Park Smart key
chain, users can enter the level, section and space where the car is
parked with push-button controls, and then lock in the location. The
featherweight unit measures 3 inches by 1 1/2 inches and operates on
a button cell battery. It comes with five key rings that attach to
the clip.</TE>
<TE>   Park Smart Key Chain (C293399) is $20 from Brookstone; (800)
351-7222, www.brookstone.com.</TE>
<TE>   'Slaw and order: Back-seat organizers that dangle behind the
front-seat headrest are nothing new, but Lewis N. Clark's latest
model includes a cooler. The Insulated Back-Seat Organizer has four
mesh pockets at the top for stashing a flashlight, tissues, maps or
other items; elastic straps in the middle for holding a thermos; and,
at the bottom, a spacious zippered insulated compartment for keeping
food hot or cold. The adjustable strap can be used for hanging in the
car or as a back strap. The organizer folds flat and fastens with
Velcro for storage.</TE>
<TE>   Lewis N. Clark Insulated Back-Seat Organizer (8842) is $30 in
stores. For information, contact L.C. Industries; (800) 575-6611,
www.lewisnclark.com.</TE>
<TE>   Back beauty: Long an innovator in neck rests, Bucky Products has
introduced a backrest for the car. The 7-inch-square faux-suede
cushion, dubbed Otto, hangs from the headrest by a shoestring cord
that can be adjusted to hit the right spot. If the pillow feels too
full, unzip the back and pour out some of the millet hull filling.
The cushion is machine washable (with the inner millet-filled sack
removed).</TE>
<TE>   Otto Auto Backrest (T910) is $24.95. For information, contact

<DL>GEORGETOWN, S.C.</DL>
<LD>To hear Zella Mae Wilt, the silver-haired volunteer at the Rice
Museum, tell it, the Civil War happened only yesterday. And with all
the sweet grace of Andy Griffith's Aunt Bee, Zella Mae was now
politely referring to it as "the late unpleasantness."</LD>
<LD>   As an Ohioan and a descendant of Union Army soldiers, I
appreciated her polite hospitality. Even more, I appreciated her time
and effort: I was the only visitor in the upstairs of the 1842 Greek
Revival Old Market Building, and I was still getting the complete $5
tour. That was good because there are lots of fascinating things to
be told about this small, unpretentious town of 10,000 that makes
regular appearances on lists of America's most charming small towns.</LD>
<LD>   "Back in 1850," Zella Mae explained with obvious pride,
"Georgetown County accounted for half of the rice production in the
U.S.--more than 1 million pounds. And at an average price of 32 cents
a pound, that made some people very, very wealthy. In fact,
Georgetown was the wealthiest city in the state, and South Carolina
was the wealthiest state in the country--except for Massachusetts."
She hesitated before the next line: "Of course, this was all made
possible only by slave labor, and that came to a screeching halt
after the late unpleasantness."</LD>
<TE>   Now schooled in polite Southern conversation, I refrained from
pointing out the even more recent unpleasantness: the ongoing NAACP
boycott of South Carolina because of its refusal to remove the
Confederate battle flag from state property. If you come looking for
remnants of the Old South, you shouldn't be surprised to find them.</TE>
<TE>   My wife, Stacie, our 2 1/2-year-old twin daughters, their nanny
and I had found Georgetown, which is thick with such remnants, almost
by accident in May. We wanted a beach vacation in the historically
evocative South but without shelling out big bucks at the gated
resort islands south of Charleston.</TE>
<TE>   So nearby Pawleys Island, which prides itself on being "arrogantly
shabby," got the nod, and Georgetown became our second base. At 14
miles away, it was the farthest we would wander from our four-bedroom
rented beach house over the next week.</TE>
<TE>   It turned out to be an enlightened choice. Not only is Pawleys
Island one of America's oldest beach resorts, established in the
1790s, but its strict no-rise edifice complex makes it the only place
in the Myrtle Beach area where you can watch the sun rise over the
green Atlantic from your back porch and set over the brown-black
tidal estuary from your front porch. And we had all of Georgetown
County to explore.</TE>
<TE>   Founded in the early 1700s by the scions of well-connected English
families from Charleston, Georgetown, both city and county, was named
for King George II. For the next 30 years, Georgetown was true blue
in name and deed: Its original cash crop, indigo, was essential for
the dyes for royal and navy blue. But when the Colonies revolted
against those same bluebloods, the dye trade dried up.</TE>
<TE>   Georgetown's first reconstruction was therefore purely economic.
According to local legend, rice had been introduced to South Carolina
in 1685, when an itinerant ship captain from Madagascar paid for
repairs with a bag of seed rice. Whatever its origins, the confluence
of five rivers--the Black, Pee Dee, Waccamaw, Santee and Sampit--and
the 4-foot tidal surge at Winyah Bay made the appropriately nicknamed
Lowcountry ideal for cultivating "Carolina gold."</TE>
<TE>   Ideal, that is, if you overlooked 46,000 acres of thick cypress
cover. The narrator of the 15-minute video shown in the Rice Museum
annex equated the task of clearing the land with the building of the
Pyramids. The work was done by slaves brought specifically from
Senegal and Gambia for their rice-cultivation skills, and it
benefited only a dozen extended families, the owners of Georgetown's
150 rice plantations. Nowhere in the antebellum South was the
numerical discrepancy between white owners and slaves more
pronounced: In 1850, Georgetown County's population was 85% black. On
Georgetown's streets, shaded by live oaks, it was apparent how easy
life had been for the landed gentry. A total of 63 homes in the
town's 40-block historic district are on the National Register of
Historic Places. Among the most impressive 18th century manors--and
one of the few open to the public--is the white, porticoed Kaminski
House, named for the Polish-born merchant who supplied lumber and
hardware to rebuild Georgetown after the Civil War. Built in 1760
with a commanding view of the Sampit River, the house is now a museum
laden with 17th and 18th century furnishings.</TE>
<TE>   The Rice Paddy Restaurant, a converted Victorian in vibrant coral
and rich brown wood, is redolent of Georgetown's golden age,
especially if you order their old-time rice purleau (pilaf).</TE>
<TE>   The next morning, our effort to see how the privileged few lived
led Stacie and me to Cap'n Rod and his Lowcountry Plantation Tour, a
three-hour pontoon boat trip through the littoral heart of the
county. We weren't the only ones looking for Cap'n Rod: His crew had
lost track of him too, and offered to refund our $40 if he didn't
show. But show he did. And show he gave, keeping the flat, reedy
waterscape from getting boring with a flowing commentary of history
and remembrances.</TE>
<TE>   It took Cap'n Rod's experienced eye to pick out the remnants of
the feeder canals and leveed trunk docks that once defined the rice
fields along the suitably named Black River. Only the most
trustworthy slaves were allowed to tend these fluvial gateways, for
once breached by salt water, a rice field took two years to cleanse
itself.</TE>
<TE>   Our first float-by sighting was of Whitehall Plantation, where
President John Quincy Adams' minister to Mexico, Joel Poinsett, began
the commercial cultivation of the red-leafed plant that he had
brought from Mexico and then named after himself. One chimney is all
that remains of the house, which was burned by the Union Army in 1863
in retaliation for a sneak attack.</TE>
<TE>   Because of thick foliage and their location on high ground,
fleeting glimpses were all we got of other former plantations, all
but one in private hands.</TE>
<TE>   With so much water everywhere, it is only natural that Georgetown
County supports a diverse fishing industry, and Murrells Inlet, a
sheltered waterfront community, is the self-proclaimed seafood
capital of South Carolina.</TE>
<TE>   The saleswoman at Harrelson's Fish Market recommended the grouper,
pan-fried with butter and paprika. And it was as good as promised,
especially when accompanied by the crashing of the surf beneath our
back porch and chased by a generous slice of pecan pie from
Georgetown's Kudzu Bakery. Even old Percival Pawley himself, the
original (1711) land grantee, would have been pleased.</TE>
<TE>   The Pawleys were among Georgetown's plutocrats, and their "island"
came into prominence in the 1790s, when they discovered that steady
offshore breezes kept malaria-carrying mosquitoes at bay. It wouldn't
be until 100 years later, however, that Pawley Island's other claim
to fame, the knotless rope hammock, was invented.</TE>
<TE>   The following morning, while the rest of my family took to the
water, I made my way to Mansfield Plantation, now a B&amp;B. A two-mile
unpaved driveway leads to a vintage slice of the Old South: two rows
of whitewashed slave cabins and a 200-year-old allee of billowing
live oaks dripping with Spanish moss. If Mansfield Plantation looks
just like a movie set, that is because scenes in "The Patriot" were
filmed here, even though the original manor house wasn't built until
1812.</TE>
<TE>   "It took them two months of preparation for what turned out to be
only four days of filming," said innkeeper Sally Smith Cahalan as she
swatted away another aggressive deer fly during a tour of the
grounds.</TE>
<TE>   Alas, traces are all that are visible of Mansfield Plantation's
heyday. In an abandoned field is the county's last surviving
winnowing house--a foursquare whitewashed wood structure from whose
elevated floor rice was swept so the wind could separate the kernels
from the husks.</TE>
<TE>   It was Mansfield's slave cabins that were refurbished to house the
servants of Philadelphia investment banking mogul Col. Robert L.
Montgomery, who used to fly his boardroom buddies here in the '30s
and '40s.</TE>
<TE>   What happened to Mansfield Plantation after the Civil War was
typical. By substituting sharecroppers for slaves, most managed to
limp into the 20th century only to be undone by a series of
hurricanes that flooded the fields with salt water. The last
commercial rice crop in Georgetown County was harvested in the 1930s.</TE>
<TE>   The Great Depression opened the floodgates of opportunity to a
second wave of Yankees, this time industrialists who came not to
conquer and subjugate but to acquire and retire. Northern
capitalists--Tom Yawkey, late owner of the Boston Red Sox; and
Vanderbilts, Rockefellers and Mellons--bought vast tracts of then
overgrown plantations.</TE>
<TE>   For dinner, my wife and I headed back to Murrells Inlet, but this
time to walk the plank, the waterfront boardwalk that links half a
dozen seafood restaurants on the inlet side of the road. We selected
the outdoor patio at Captain Dave's Dockside, where Stacie went for
the catch of the day (grilled red snapper), while I chose the spicy
shrimp and grits and local ale.</TE>
<TE>   A day on the beach and a trip to Myrtle Beach left us with only
one day to see Georgetown's two other antebellum showcases. The
first, Hopsewee Plantation, was the home of the Thomas Lynches,
senior and junior, both of whom were to sign the Declaration of
Independence, although the elder died before he had the chance.</TE>
<TE>   Serendipitously, we had saved the best for last: Hampton
Plantation, built on the banks of the Santee River in the 1750s by
the Horry (pronounced OR-ry) family. In the late 1700s, the
four-story whitewashed wood manor was the home of Eliza Lucas
Pinckney, who produced the state's first indigo crop--at the age of
16. Among her many distinguished guests was George Washington, who
advised against cutting down the live oak that blocked the front view
of the house. The oak still stands.</TE>
<TE>   One hundred and fifty years later, Clark Gable came to soak up
local color for an upcoming role. While there he saw 7-year-old Will
Alston climb inside and begin rocking the pivoting metal-frame bell
that announced quitting time to the sharecroppers. It became the
opening scene in "Gone With the Wind."</TE>
<TE>   Naturally, Rhett Butler, the fictional blockade runner and South
Carolina native, is much revered in Georgetown, a port he would have
known well.</TE>
<TE>   And naturally I politely refrained from observing that Clark Gable
was a Yankee from Ohio. It only would have ruined it--for all of us.</TE>

<HD>From the Redwoods to the Sea in Marin's Mt. Tamalpais State
Park</HD>

<AU>JOHN McKINNEY</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the language of the Coast Miwok tribe, "tamal" means bay and
"pais" means mountain. So it makes sense that from the 2,571-foot
east peak of Mt. Tamalpais, visitors overlook the Pacific and San
Francisco Bay, not to mention the city of San Francisco,
redwood-lined creeks, stands of Douglas fir and oak-dotted pastures.</LD>
<LD>   The fight to preserve this Marin County landmark began about 100
years ago, but Mt. Tamalpais State Park didn't open until 1930.
Thanks to continued conservation efforts, the park has grown to
6,300-plus acres with more than 50 miles of trails.</LD>
<LD>   These trails connect to 200 more miles of paths leading through
the wooded watershed of the Marin Municipal Water District and over
to Muir Woods National Monument and Golden Gate National Recreation
Area.</LD>
<TE>   One of my favorite Mt. Tam journeys is the one-way hike from the
Mountain Home Inn in Mill Valley to Stinson Beach. The fine inn,
which has a restaurant and a small bar with fabulous views of San
Francisco Bay, is very hospitable to hikers.</TE>
<TE>   You can ramble down the mountain through the redwoods to the
Pantoll ranger station, which dispenses maps and other trail
information and has an adjacent picnic area.</TE>
<TE>   For an even more glorious adventure, keep descending to Stinson
Beach.</TE>
<TE>   Golden Gate Transit bus No. 63 passes the Mountain Home Inn, the
Pantoll ranger station and Stinson Beach. For more information about
this line and others, call Golden Gate Transit at (415) 455-2000 or
look up the Bay Area Transit Information Project at
www.transitinfo.org.</TE>
<TE>   Directions to the trail head: From U.S. 101 in southern Marin
County, take the Stinson Beach/Highway 1 exit toward Mill Valley.
After three-quarters of a mile, turn left at a traffic light so that
you remain on Highway 1. Go about 2 1/2 miles and bear right at a
fork (sign says "Mt. Tamalpais") onto Panoramic Highway.</TE>
<TE>   Continue three miles to the Mountain Home Inn, which is on the
right side of the highway. The trail head and parking area are on the
left.</TE>
<TE>   The hike: This gorgeous ramble through redwoods begins by
following Alice Eastwood Road, a paved route closed to vehicles.
Alice Eastwood Group Campground has picnic tables and portable
toilets.</TE>
<TE>   From the camp, take a sign-marked connector trail to Bootjack
Trail, which descends west along lovely Redwood Creek. The path
climbs, quite steeply in places, to tiny Van Wyck Meadow, then to the
Pantoll ranger station.</TE>
<TE>   At this point, sign-marked Steep Ravine Trail heads south,
following switchbacks down through redwood, Douglas fir and
huckleberry. After half a mile, the trail reaches Webb Creek and
begins descending Steep Ravine.</TE>
<TE>   Wood ferns, sword ferns and five-finger ferns line the trail.
Climb down a ladder, built by the Civilian Conservation Corps in the
1930s, and cross a couple of footbridges.</TE>
<TE>   About 1 1/2 miles from the trail head, Steep Ravine Trail is
joined by the Dipsea Trail, coming from the east over a footbridge.
Most hikers choose to keep right on Dipsea and head for the town of
Stinson Beach.</TE>
<TE>   The trail ends near the junction of Panoramic Highway and Highway
1 (Shoreline Highway). Follow the latter to Stinson Beach's fine
restaurants, its sand strand with picnic ground nearby and the bus
stop.</TE>

<HD>A Service That Bears All When Bags Are a Burden</HD>
<DH>Companies that send luggage to your destination are gaining
clients tired of airport security hassles.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JANE ENGLE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Three years ago the idea of paying $50 or $100 to ship a bag to your
destination seemed like a luxury for the rich, the famous or perhaps
a few eccentrics with phobias about airport luggage carousels.</LD>
<LD>   "People thought we were way ahead of the curve," says Richard
Altomare, who founded such a shipping service in 1999 after he popped
a shoulder hoisting a bag. At first his service was not widely used:
"I was happy if my wife and her girlfriends signed up for it."</LD>
<LD>   But since the Sept. 11 attacks, as security-related luggage
hassles have grown, so has Altomare's business--by 20% per month, he
estimates. He heads Universal Express Inc. in Boca Raton, Fla., which
runs Luggage Express, (866) 744-7224, www.usxpluggageexpress.com, and
a similar company, Virtual Bellhop, (877) 235-5467,
www.virtualbellhop.com, which it bought last year.</LD>
<TE>   At least two other companies, Sports Express in Durango, Colo.,
(800) 357-4174, www.sportsexpress.com, and Skycap International in
Anchorage, (877) 775-9227, www.skycapinternational.com, specialize in
luggage shipping for airline passengers.</TE>
<TE>   Typically such services pick up bags from your home and ship them
to your destination hotel using FedEx or other couriers, timing them
to arrive when you do or sometimes the day before, and coordinating
with the hotel staff. On return, they ship the bags back to your
home.</TE>
<TE>   Airlines, cruise lines and upscale hotels are starting to refer
customers to such services. So don't be surprised if your travel
agent asks you, "Window seat? Aisle seat? Baggage shipping?" when
booking your plane ticket. That's now an option, thanks to a deal
between Virtual Bellhop and Sabre, which has loaded the service onto
its computerized reservation system, widely used by agents.</TE>
<TE>   Bypassing the baggage carousel remains a pricey indulgence. "It's
not oxygen. It's ice cream," Altomare says. But for certain travelers
it may make sense. Here are some examples:</TE>
<TE>   * Extra bags: If you have excess baggage, you may find it doesn't
cost much more to ship it than to check it, and the convenience may
be worth the price.</TE>
<TE>   Recently more airlines have begun charging if you have more than
two checked bags. The so-called third-bag fee is $40 to $80 per
piece, depending on the airline. Among those that impose it: Alaska,
Continental, Delta, Northwest and United. (Some exempt first-class
passengers.) America West allows three bags total, checked and
carry-on; above that, the fee is $80 per bag. As of last week,
Southwest wasn't charging for a third checked bag, but charges $40
each for a fourth and fifth bag.</TE>
<TE>   By comparison, some luggage services may charge less than $100 to
ship a bag, depending on the weight, dimensions and distance. For
instance, shipping a 50-pound bag from Los Angeles to New York City,
using two-day delivery, Virtual Bellhop recently quoted me $111.83;
Luggage Express, $99; Sports Express, $96.71; and Skycap
International, $79.96.</TE>
<TE>   Lighter bags can cost less. Sports Express quoted $67.17 for
two-day delivery of a 32-pound bag from Los Angeles to New York.</TE>
<TE>   These rates are close to FedEx and United Parcel Service fees. But
most of these luggage shippers include extra services, such as
monitoring your bag en route (Sports Express) and calling you to let
you know your luggage has arrived (Virtual Bellhop).</TE>
<TE>   Packages and discounts can drive these prices lower. Luggage
Express sells $995 annual memberships that cover up to 20 one-way
deliveries in the continental U.S., which can bring the per-bag cost
down to $49.75 if you're a frequent traveler.</TE>
<TE>   If you book the Sports Express service through America West, you
get $10 off each order; Delta gives $5 off, according to deals
recently posted on the airlines' Web sites. Factor in the few dollars
you save in tips to the skycap and bellhop, and the costs of shipping
your third bag versus checking it may be about the same.</TE>
<TE>   * Lengthy trips: If you've invested thousands in an extended
vacation and you have lots of luggage, shipping may not be so
onerous. In fact, Holland America is picking up the tab for
passengers on its around-the-world cruise on the Amsterdam, departing
Jan. 4 from Fort Lauderdale, Fla., to ship 100 pounds of luggage or
more, depending on the cabin category, from a traveler's home to the
ship.</TE>
<TE>   This summer, the high-end Seabourn cruise line began offering to
send passengers' luggage by way of DHL to any of its ships'
embarkation points for a fee. (It's about $200 to ship a 30-pound bag
from the U.S. to London, the line says.)</TE>
<TE>   * Health issues: If you use a wheelchair or have heart, back or
other health problems, lugging your luggage may be unfeasible. You
could pay skycaps, but shipping is also an option. Skycap
International got its start several years ago handling luggage for
travelers with disabilities and has since expanded to all customers,
says company President Gary Hovanec.</TE>
<TE>   * The hassle factor:  Avoiding an hour or two in line to check
your baggage could be worth $50, $100 or more to some people. Others
dread intrusive bag searches. "How much is it worth to you [to avoid]
having someone unzip your suitcase and take everything out, and you
need to repack everything?" Universal Express' Altomare asks.</TE>
<TE>   How safe is your luggage with shipping services? Probably pretty
safe. The four I contacted primarily use FedEx.</TE>
<TE>   Spokesmen for the four say their companies have never lost a bag,
although they concede some bags have been delayed or damaged. Such
claims total about 1.2% of orders at Virtual Bellhop and 1.5% at
Luggage Express, says Cecilia Vesnesky, logistics and development
director for Universal Express. Sports Express' delayed-or-damaged
complaint rates total 1.1% of bags handled, says spokesman Mike
Smedley. Skycap International's Hovanec says he does not have figures
but that such claims are rare.</TE>
<TE>   The 10 biggest U.S. airlines averaged 3.99 mishandled baggage
complaints per 1,000 passengers in July, the latest figure available
from the U.S. Department of Transportation. Comparison with luggage
services is difficult because the DOT figure isn't tracked against
the number of bags moved, and it lumps together complaints of lost,
damaged, delayed and pilfered bags. The definitions of "delayed" and
other terms also vary.</TE>
<TE>   If you use a luggage service, ask about insurance. Some include
coverage in their rates; some don't. Buying insurance can raise the
total price above the initial quote.</TE>

<HD>For Parents and Offspring, This Journey Is Unlike Any Other</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>"Are you going to cry, Mom?" my son Matt asked me on the plane ride
to California.</LD>
<LD>   I wasn't sure. After all, we were on the family trip that we had
spent more time preparing for than any other--18 1/2 years, to be
exact. We were taking Matt, our oldest child, to college.</LD>
<LD>   "At first it feels like any vacation," says Mary Quigley, a New
York University professor who just deposited her second son at the
University of Notre Dame in Indiana. "Then it's time to say goodbye,
and you leave your child and walk away from that dorm."</LD>
<TE>   There are at least a quarter of a million more college freshmen
than there were a decade ago, the National Center for Education
Statistics reports. That adds up to more than 1.7 million kids who
are entering colleges and universities this fall, loaded down with
computers, refrigerators, TVs, DVD players, coffee makers and
posters. Nervous parents trail behind, arms full of bags containing
enough toothpaste, soap and peanut butter to last two years.</TE>
<TE>   "Girls tend to pack their entire bedroom," says Sue Tober, a New
Hampshire resident who was forced to rent a minivan to take her
daughter to Syracuse University. "Let them take what they want, and
then just smile and take home the stuff that doesn't fit."</TE>
<TE>   There's no question that the trip to college will be frustrating
and emotionally charged, but like other big parenting moments, it's
probably not going to be exactly the way we've been imagining it.
Parents who expect one Kodak moment after another will invariably be
disappointed--like the time the kids whined at Disney World, or it
rained in Hawaii. That's life.</TE>
<TE>   "Don't take it personally if your child wants to get rid of you,"
says Jennifer Fugett Wyatt, who along with University of Washington
psychologist Laura Kastner wrote the book "The Launching Years:
Strategies for Parenting From Senior Year to College Life" (Three
Rivers Press, 2002). "You've got to be ready to back off if they give
you the signals they don't want you there anymore." (For more tips,
visit www.launchingyears.com.)</TE>
<TE>   Sure, we deserve better (at least a heartfelt "thanks, Mom and
Dad") after helping them navigate the college application process,
calming their I'll-never-get-accepted-anywhere jitters and, of
course, agreeing to foot the bill for their higher education.</TE>
<TE>   But remember that the kids are nervous too, even if they won't
admit it, says Karen Levin Coburn, assistant vice chancellor for
students at Washington University in St. Louis and coauthor of
"Letting Go: A Parents' Guide to Understanding the College Years"
(Harper Perennial, 1997).</TE>
<TE>   "You may find yourself arguing over the silliest things," says
Coburn, who has interviewed students all over the country about their
freshman experiences. "Don't expect a lot of quality time."</TE>
<TE>   Wyatt, who has sent two daughters to college, recommends that
parents back off. "Parents need to remember they're not in the
control seat now," she says.</TE>
<TE>   To ease the transition, growing numbers of universities and
colleges offer parent orientation programs, complete with parent
handbooks and, in some cases, parent Web sites.</TE>
<TE>   That might help, but the experience is still an emotional roller
coaster that has memories tumbling out at every turn. It seemed like
just last week that my preschooler pushed a Wisconsin innkeeper's cat
into the pond "to see if he could swim." That little escapade got us
kicked out of the hotel and sparked the beginning of this column. We
laughed about that on our way to California and reminisced about
other misadventures.</TE>
<TE>   We made the shopping rounds--I learned that these dorm beds
require extra-long sheets--and were able to squeeze in dinner with
Southern California friends. We bickered, but there were also a few
special moments that reminded me of why I'm so glad to be this
confident young man's mom.</TE>
<TE>   And I convinced myself that with e-mail and cell phones, Matt
won't have to line up for a hall phone or write letters--the steps I
had to take to stay in touch with the family when I was in college.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we have a better relationship now than when she was
home," says Cincinnati graphic artist Lisa Fryxell, whose daughter
just started her sophomore year of college.</TE>
<TE>   Fryxell was perplexed that co-workers thought she'd be sad when
Courtney, her only child, left for college. "Why should I cry? She
was starting the adventure of her life!"</TE>
<TE>   I didn't cry either. I think Matt was disappointed.</TE>

<HD>Recalling Stresses of Travel for Seniors</HD>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Susan Spano's column, "Careful Planning and Little Comforts Can Help
Smooth the Way for Seniors" (Her World, Sept. 15), brought back
memories of air travel with my mother. I travel frequently, and
whenever I was somewhere I thought my mother would enjoy, she would
fly out from Los Angeles to join me. I usually timed it so she only
had to fly one way alone and we flew back together. But I worried the
whole time she was on her own. Until you have traveled with an
elderly person, you have no idea of how difficult it can be.</LD>
<LD>   My mother wore hearing aids but had to take them out before she
flew because the background noise on airplanes is so loud. Then she
would worry that she couldn't hear, not just safety instructions but
anything the flight attendant said to her. She had to have bulkhead
seats because she had bad knees and needed to stretch her legs out.
Airlines won't assign those seats in advance, so she worried until
the time she checked in.</LD>
<LD>   As she got older, even a trip to the airplane lavatory was
stressful. If she was flying alone, she worried about being able to
locate it. The closest ones were usually in first or business class,
and frequently, but not always, flight attendants would allow her to
use those.</LD>
<TE>   I learned fast that arranging a car service was the best way to
get her from the airport to the hotel when she arrived in a strange
city.</TE>
<TE>   I see fewer elderly people flying since Sept. 11. If it was
stressful before, it is much more so now. My mother would get rattled
if she set off the metal detector. How would she react now to taking
off her shoes or having her bags searched by hand?</TE>

<LD>Rosemary McClure's article, "All Aboard for a Grand Canyon Getaway"
(Weekend Escape, Sept. 22), caused me to marvel at our different
perceptions. My friend and I had no complaints about the Grand Canyon
Railway package we took in July.</LD>
<LD>   Yes, the meals at Max &amp; Thelma's Restaurant are heavier than most
health-conscious people prefer, but we walked off the extra calories
by heading into historic Williams on Route 66. The friendly rangers
at the Visitors Center offered a walking tour map, and the high
desert's balmy evenings were perfect for strolling.</LD>
<LD>   When describing the canyon, McClure neglected to mention wildlife,
especially that most majestic sight, soaring California condors. With
their 9-foot wingspan, the condors put on an awe-inspiring show each
afternoon at the South Rim.</LD>
<TE>   Next time, the writer should forget about the food, leave the city
behind, take a deep breath and open herself to the natural wonders of
the Grand Canyon.</TE>

guest with my wife, Sandy, at the new Four Seasons Resort in the
desert just north of Phoenix, I watched where I stepped.</LD>
<LD>   In this part of the country, the good life comes with a drawback
or two.</LD>
<LD>   I never did see a snake--although lots of rabbits hopped just
beyond my feet as I strolled to the pool each morning. But I did
suffer a bad scrape when I inattentively brushed too close to a tall
cactus. And that's how I learned how far some luxury resorts here
will go to pamper a guest.</LD>
<TE>   I thought nothing of my wound, which I sustained while entering
the Crescent Moon cafe for breakfast. But a waitress, noting a bit of
blood on my arm, called security. And, lo, as my melon was served,
along came a medic toting his black bag. As the whole room looked on,
my arm was cleansed with antiseptic and soothed with medicinal
lotion.</TE>
<TE>   Ain't the rich life grand?</TE>
<TE>   Not that this is the life I customarily lead. But fate has smiled
on me sporadically in recent years, allowing me to stay at four of
the finest resorts in the greater Phoenix area--which means, by most
preference polls, among the finest anywhere in the country. Besides
the Four Seasons, they are the Boulders, the Phoenician and the Royal
Palms.</TE>
<TE>   Each of the resorts I've stayed in is very different, but happily,
each delivers on its promise of elegance and indulgence: attentive
service (I never waited for a valet to park my car or return it),
fine dining, spacious rooms, marble baths, glorious views, soothing
spa treatments. If you have the wherewithal--a lot of wherewithal--or
are splurging on a special occasion, go for it.</TE>
<TE>   Graced with a near-perfect climate from fall to spring, the
Phoenix area has emerged as a major resort capital. Vacationers
fleeing the chill of winter come here to swim, golf, play tennis,
hike, horseback ride or just relax under a usually warm, sunny sky.</TE>
<TE>   To be honest, I'm normally a budget-conscious traveler. Resorts
cater mostly to golfers and tennis players, and I'm neither. But when
my wife's employer dispatched her to each of these places, I was
happy to tag along. Even with free lodging, though, I still managed
to spend a bundle on meals and recreation.</TE>
<TE>   We stayed first at the Boulders, and after that trip I was hooked.
But would I spend my own money? I ponder this each time I return to
Phoenix. And my best answer is, "Yes, I would be tempted." I like
living rich, if only for a few days.</TE>
<TE>   So here is a peek into Phoenix's finest vacation retreats.</TE>
<TE>   The Boulders</TE>
<TE>   Families of quail paraded among the desert cactus, and bushy
cottontail rabbits scampered everywhere. Lucky them. They live
year-round at the Boulders, a posh resort that rates at the top of
nearly every list of best places to stay in America.</TE>
<TE>   On these trips, my wife worked and I idled. At the Boulders I was
up at dawn each day. I stepped from our adobe casita onto our private
patio. Within minutes the first quail or rabbit would appear, darting
among the cactus. The Boulders fits as gracefully into its rugged but
lovely setting as my early-morning visitors did.</TE>
<TE>   The resort covers 1,300 acres of Sonoran Desert foothills in the
suburb of Carefree, about 33 miles north of the Phoenix airport, and
much of the land is untouched. Our patio faced a natural desert-scape
of cactus, mesquite, odd-looking paloverde trees and waxy jojoba
bushes. The fragrance of the desert filled our room.</TE>
<TE>   Lodging is in 160 spacious and cozy Southwestern-style casitas
scattered among the soaring granite boulders that give the resort its
name. The buildings, painted in the same pinkish color as the rocks,
are all but hidden in the natural shrubbery. Southwestern is the
theme throughout; a giant terra-cotta pot stood above our room's
wood-burning fireplace, and rough log beams called vigas crossed the
ceiling. The room was more than big enough for two overstuffed
leather chairs, a wet bar, a desk and two six-drawer dressers. A
walk-in closet held two fluffy robes. The Boulders justly calls its
tiled bathrooms "oversize." Ours was larger than many hotel rooms
I've stayed in, and abundantly supplied with amenities.</TE>
<TE>   The Boulders has two 18-hole golf courses and six tennis courts,
but I found plenty of other things to do. I jogged one morning to
explore the grounds and exited through the guarded gate into the
community of Carefree. Enviable homes dot the steep, winding streets,
which have names like Languid, Meander and Leisure. The resort boasts
separate pools for loungers and lap swimmers; I often had the lap
pool to myself.</TE>
<TE>   Folks looking for other activities needn't fret--the staff can
keep you busy. One day I joined other guests for a 90-minute trail
ride in the hills. On another, I joined in on a five-mile hike and
picnic in nearby Tonto National Forest. The Boulders charges $70 per
person for each of these outings; next time I'd do the hike on my own
at no cost. Still, both were agreeable experiences that got me out
into the beautiful desert.</TE>
<TE>   If you want a romantic dinner alone--perhaps to propose
marriage--the staff will set up a table for two on the eighth hole of
the South Course and deliver a gourmet dinner for $100--plus the cost
of food and drinks.</TE>
<TE>   Since our stay, the Boulders has opened a branch of the Golden
Door spa. I stopped by for a look earlier this year and was
flabbergasted by the Ultimate Spa Suite, an indoor/outdoor massage
room for two featuring--can you believe it?--a fancy sitting room
with patio, indoor and outdoor massage tables, private steam showers
(indoors) and a private Jacuzzi on the patio. The six-hour Ultimate
Spa Experience, as it is called, features four 50-minute treatments
each and lunch on the patio for a heady $1,400. (A Golden Door
massage is $115 for 50 minutes.)</TE>
<TE>   I can dream, can't I?</TE>
<TE>   Four Seasons at Troon</TE>
<TE>   Like the Boulders, the Four Seasons occupies many acres of desert
(40) studded with rock-strewn hills, and here too the natural
landscape has been preserved. This accounts, I suppose, for the
reported presence of an occasional rattler and the stately old cactus
into which I stumbled.</TE>
<TE>   The resort's style is Southwestern and tastefully so. Its 210
rooms occupy a series of one- and two-story brown adobe structures
resembling an ancient pueblo. They are arranged in a giant oval
surrounding a huge swimming pool with waterfall. On hot days at the
pool, attendants drape you with cool towels and spritz you with
mineral water. About 3 p.m., they appear with complimentary ice cream
bars, distributing them to everyone.</TE>
<TE>   We were assigned an upper-level room, reached by a zigzag series
of 33 steps. To some guests, I'm sure, this would be less than
luxurious. But the climb gave us privacy. We could open our windows
to a desert panorama without fear of anyone peeking inside.</TE>
<TE>   Our generously sized casita came equipped with a gas-burning unit
built in Southwestern kiva style, but the weather never turned cool
enough to use it. I moved the two overstuffed chairs away from the
fireplace toward the floor-to-ceiling sliding glass door and the
desert beyond. The decor--cream and tan and lots of solid wood
trim--blended with the rocks and sand of the landscape outside. The
walk-in closet added to the sense of spaciousness. And left on my own
while my wife worked, I made good use of the deep soaking tub in the
bathroom.</TE>
<TE>   Guests enjoy priority use of two challenging 18-hole golf courses
nearby, Pinnacle and Monument at Troon North. On the resort grounds
are four tennis courts and a full-service spa. I chose the
eucalyptus-scented steam room and a basic feel-good massage ($110).</TE>
<TE>   The "daily activities guide" suggests other pursuits, both free
and not. Among them: power walks, body-toning classes, balloon rides,
horseback riding, mountain biking, yoga lessons and stargazing. Now
that I'm home, I regret that I didn't sample some of them.</TE>
<TE>   The Acacia, specializing in grilled game and meat, is the resort's
dress-up restaurant. We preferred an outdoor table under the stars at
the casual Crescent Moon. Our choice that evening was pan-roasted
salmon wrapped in prosciutto and served with yellow beans, fennel and
potatoes with Chianti-flavored butter ($22).</TE>
<TE>   The Phoenician</TE>
<TE>   The Phoenician is lovely, of course, but it's my least favorite of
this group--though I would never give up a chance to stay here again.
Where the Boulders spreads out in open countryside, the Phoenician is
an urban resort occupying 130 acres in downtown Scottsdale. With 640
rooms and suites, it bustles, and I longed for the serenity of the
Boulders. But as a tag-along, I wasn't about to complain.</TE>
<TE>   Given its in-town location, the Phoenician is nicely situated at
the base of a looming, rocky cliff that suggests the nearby desert
wilderness. The Phoenician is a landscaped garden of bright flowers
and expansive green lawns, an oasis of greenery in the earth-toned
winter scenery here.</TE>
<TE>   Lodging is in two long, multistory buildings that form parallel
crescents. They partly encircle an amazing acre of water gardens--the
Oasis--where guests have a choice of seven terraced swimming pools,
including an adults-only cluster of tiled hot tubs. Fountains bubble,
waterfalls cascade and a discreetly hidden water slide spirals from
one level to the next.</TE>
<TE>   Tucked between the main lodge buildings and the cliff behind them
is a well-tended two-acre cactus garden, where you can study Sonoran
Desert vegetation. Near the pools, a creek tumbles through a
landscaped ravine, and a hibiscus-draped grotto there offers some
solitude from the crowds.</TE>
<TE>   The Phoenician maintains 27 holes of golf and 12 tennis courts.
But I chose a wonderful afternoon (Sandy's treat) at the full-service
spa, called the Centre for Well-Being. Before and after a massage
($110), I soaked in the hot tub, steamed in the steam room and rinsed
away any remaining cares in the multi-headed Swiss shower.</TE>
<TE>   Our agreeably large room opened onto a balcony view of the cactus
garden. In the closet we found terry robes; the bathroom was Italian
marble. I counted three telephones for the two of us.</TE>
<TE>   The resort's top restaurant is the elegant Mary Elaine's, where
huge windows open onto the twinkling lights of Phoenix and the desert
beyond. On our final night, I ordered the grilled dorado on a bed of
curried rice with mango and coconut. Sandy chose the herb-crusted
rack of lamb. Entrees begin at $42, making Mary Elaine's the most
expensive restaurant in the four resorts.</TE>
<TE>   Of the four, the Phoenician looks the most regal. The artworks and
tapestries might grace a palace. The 11 Steinway grand pianos, most
available in the public rooms for guests to play, are impressive.</TE>
<TE>   Royal Palms</TE>
<TE>   At the foot of Camelback Mountain, the Royal Palms is a resort for
non-resort-goers--that is, folks like me. I loved the place, partly
because nobody was playing golf or tennis. Neither is available on
the premises; the concierge will arrange times elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   But what delighted me most was the resort's lovely Spanish
colonial flavor--a step back into Old Seville with its splashing
tiled fountains, fragrant orange trees, hidden courtyards and
palm-shaded archways. Colorful flowers bloom in countless clay pots
on the property's nine walled acres.</TE>
<TE>   Stay here for romance, just the two of you in one of the 116
casitas (my choice) or plaza guest rooms. Because Sandy was working,
romance wasn't on our agenda, so I spent much of one day seeking out
cozy niches in which to read, periodically wandering over to the
swimming pool for a dip. In January, a full-service
10,300-square-foot spa is scheduled to open.</TE>
<TE>   The villa-like principal buildings, which house the reception
area, restaurant and cozy public lounges, were constructed in 1929 as
a retreat for Delos Willard Cooke, a nephew of J.P. Morgan and a
wealthy New York industrialist. He and his wife planted 900 palm
trees, many from Egypt, thus the name. In 1948 the mansion was
converted to a glamorous but intimate hotel. Like the Phoenician, its
neighbor, it sits in the heart of Phoenix's sprawl, fortunately
shielded from the traffic of Camelback Road by its high wall.</TE>
<TE>   T. Cook's, the inn's restaurant, is reputed to be among the best
in Phoenix, and I agree. The decor is Mediterranean, as is the menu;
the food is divine. The pork tenderloin with balsamic cabbage and
apricots ($25) caught my eye. Sandy favored the John Dory, a light,
mild fish, with baby beets, fennel and white truffle celery jus
($28).</TE>
<TE>   Our deluxe casita--Sandy sometimes gets upgraded--featured a
canopy bed of handwrought iron, a fireplace, French doors leading to
a small patio, and a gorgeous marble bathroom. Our cluster of half a
dozen casitas  opened onto a secluded grove of orange trees.</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes Sandy tells me she is ready to retire. I look forward to
that day. But maybe not until she's taken a few more of these
hard-duty assignments.</TE>

<CP>PHOTO: Cam Sanders of Los Angeles found seashells by the
seashore on Providenciales, part of the Turks and Caicos Islands in
the Caribbean. In April he and a cousin stopped at Boogaloo's Conch,
a roadside stand on Providenciales' west side, where they ordered
conch fritters and a conch stew made with coconut milk and
vegetables. "The chef took the conch right out of the water, removing
it from its shell in a couple of deft strokes," writes Sanders, who
took this photo of empty shells drying in the sun. "It was delicious.
We went to the fancy restaurants on the island, but this was the best
meal we had."</CP>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I used to have a collection of beaded Indian belts--the kind made in
Taiwan, not Navajo country--bearing the names of places I visited
when I was growing up: Springfield, Ill., the Missouri Ozarks,
Kentucky Lake in the southwestern part of that state. At some
misguided moment, I threw them away. Now the only souvenir belts I
have are recent acquisitions reminding me that I've been to Santa Fe
and Carlsbad Caverns in New Mexico.</LD>
<LD>   Suddenly and inexplicably, I have grown wistful for the kitschy
travel souvenirs I bought and abandoned in my life: belts, tea
towels, cedar boxes, silver spoons and the snow globes that produce
preposterous blizzards on the beaches of Honolulu and Miami.
Nostalgia and regret are common as we grow older, especially among
aging baby boomers like me, who amassed those souvenirs on family car
trips.</LD>
<LD>   Such bric-a-brac is still popular at shops catering to travelers,
like Stuckey's, a chain of roadside gas, snack and souvenir stores
that has become an institution on American highways since it was
founded in the mid-'30s. "Cedar boxes always sell, year after year,"
says Williamson S. Stuckey Jr., the company chairman and son of the
founder. The boxes with pictures of Niagara Falls are especially
strong sellers, he says, even at stores that are nowhere near upstate
New York.</LD>
<TE>   Certain antique and old-timey travel souvenirs have become
valuable collectibles. Jen Segrest, a self-styled snow globe fanatic
from Cincinnati, says she's seen snow globes on eBay, the Internet
auction site, for $200. At Global Shakeup, an Internet snow globe
store based in Pasadena, most of the offerings are more reasonably
priced, about $5 to $10. But Global Shakeup also has such treasures
as a Hawaii-under-glass snow dome, featuring dolphins, beaches,
high-rise hotels and a built-in music box that plays "Somewhere Over
the Rainbow," for $35.</TE>
<TE>   Segrest, a graphics designer who started her collection with a
Mammoth Cave, Ky., snow globe and now doesn't have enough shelf space
to display all of them, says quality varies widely among the snowy
souvenirs. "The good ones have white bases and blue backs with
hand-painted scenes inside," Segrest says.</TE>
<TE>   The Design, Architecture, Art and Planning Library at the
University of Cincinnati has a world-class collection of almost 400
snow globes on display throughout the stacks. These include examples
from China, Stonehenge and several from New York City with the World
Trade Center. "At the time we buy these things," says library head
Jane Carlin, "we don't think things will change."</TE>
<TE>   But, of course, things do. The octogenarian mother of a colleague
found a silver souvenir spoon of the Golden Gate when she was a
little girl growing up in Kansas. She buffed it up and still proudly
shows it to friends, who don't immediately see what's special about
it. Then she points out that it shows the Golden Gate without the
bridge, which wasn't completed until 1937.</TE>
<TE>   Volumes have been written about silver souvenir spoons, which bear
pictures of people and places on the handle or the bowl. The Royal
Ontario Museum in Canada has an important collection of silver
souvenir spoons, all made before 1913 and given by Toronto lawyer
George Ferguson Shepley to his wife. Jane Bradley, co-owner of
Antiques Etc. in New Castle, Colo., has a small but beloved
collection of spoons dedicated to sights on the western slope of the
Rockies. Her favorite, from about 1910, portrays a girl in a bathing
costume, diving into the thermal pool at Glenwood Springs. "The
spoons talk to you," Bradley says. "Souvenirs now are mass-markety,
plastic, impersonal."</TE>
<TE>   Susan Jessup, retail director for Aurora, Colo.-based Xanterra
Parks &amp; Resorts, says the gift shops at Yellowstone, Mt. Rushmore and
the Grand Canyon used to be full of kitschy items, like ashtrays with
such lines as, "Put your butt here." Now, says Jessup, "We work to
buy gift and souvenir items that are really interpretive of the
park."</TE>
<TE>   For those of us who favor tacky keepsakes, there's still
Stuckey's, the roadside purveyor of pecan rolls and silly souvenirs.
The company, founded in rural Georgia by pecan merchant Williamson S.
Stuckey Sr., foundered in the '60s and '70s after being sold to Pet
Milk Inc. But in 1985, his son and two partners repurchased the
company, which now has 200 franchise stores in 19 states.</TE>
<TE>   Stuckey's buyer Chaz Grimaldi says that when gas was cheaper,
people paid for their fuel with a $20 bill and used the change for
snacks and junk. Despite the increased price of gas, tacky souvenirs
remain popular. He has noticed a resurgence of interest in salt and
pepper shakers, shot glasses, key chains with pictures of state
flowers or birds, bobble-head figures and dashboard hula girls. "Our
stuff is fun to look at," Grimaldi says.</TE>
<TE>   Stuckey Jr. says the kitschy keepsakes are all "part of the
American way."</TE>
<TE>   That's how I see it too. So I'm going to start collecting beaded
belts again, unashamed.</TE>

<LD>Explore the ancient world of the pharaohs on a cruise and tour of the
Nile River with Abercrombie &amp; Kent, a tour company known for high-end
adventure travel--and hefty price tags. On this trip the company is
using a word usually not found in its vocabulary: "discount."</LD>
<LD>   "I've never seen them do this before," said Pamela Lassers, media
director for the 40-year-old firm. "But there aren't a lot of
Americans traveling to Egypt right now. There are lots of Europeans
and Australians--our worldwide clientele--but not Americans."</LD>
<LD>   The Abercrombie &amp; Kent cachet is luxury travel: private escorts,
fine food, small groups, lavish accommodations. The discounted trip,
called the Nile Explorer, is an 11-day tour, including a five-day
cruise through the Nile Valley and visits to the Great Pyramids, the
tomb of King Tut, the statues of Ramses II at Abu Simbel and the
temples of Thebes. There are several departures through Dec. 24.</LD>
<TE>   The tour price is $3,490 per person, with 50% off for the second
passenger sharing a cabin. For singles traveling alone, the single
supplement is being waived, a savings of $970. Air fare from the
United States to Cairo is an extra $1,141 to $1,645, depending on the
date.</TE>

<HD>Nostalgia Ain't What It Used To Be</HD>
<DH>IGNORANCE, A Novel, By Milan Kundera, Translated from the
French by Linda Asher, HarperCollins: 196 pp., $23.95</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAROSLAW ANDERS</AU>
<BD>Jaroslaw Anders is a writer and translator living in
Washington, D.C., who often writes about Eastern and Central Europe.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Since the fall of communism, Eastern and Central Europe have been
living in the time of returns. The region is supposed to be
returning, after decades of Soviet-imposed hibernation, to its
legitimate place in Europe and in Western civilization. There is a
rush of returning exiles, sometimes exiles' children, who spent the
better part of their lives abroad. Returning to this hitherto
fatalistic domain are the very notions of the future, of second
chances, of free choice but also of envy, loneliness and moral
ambiguity that can no longer be blamed on the "political system." All
those returns, and the tricks played by memory on people and nations
in transition, are the subject of "Ignorance," the new novel by Czech
writer Milan Kundera--by far his most successful since "The
Unbearable Lightness of Being."</LD>
<TE>   It may appear that "Nostalgia" would have been a more fitting
title. The word, as the author reminds us, is derived from the Greek
nostos ("return") and algos ("pain, grief, sorrow"). In Kundera's
novel, however, the term assumes a double meaning: not only of sorrow
caused by the desire to return but also of pain caused by actual
return. For Kundera, nostalgia is a profoundly deceptive sentiment.
The author points out that in Spanish, the word for nostalgia or
longing is anoranza, related, via the Catalan, to the Latin word
ignorantia. We feel nostalgic because we no longer know the place or
person or the moment in the past we long for. When nostalgia settles
in, the object of desire is already fading. Nostalgia, writes
Kundera, is a self-sufficient sentiment, "fully absorbed ... by its
suffering and nothing else." In other words, it is a form of not
knowing, and it rarely survives a confrontation with reality.</TE>
<TE>   This is what happens to the novel's two Czech protagonists, Irena
and Josef, who left Czechoslovakia in the gloomy post-1968 years.
Irena, who has been living in Paris, travels to Prague to join her
companion, a doting but sexually withdrawn Swedish businessman who
wants to relocate them there permanently. Recently widowed Josef, who
ended up in Denmark, is flying to his native country to see if his
antipathy for his countrymen has abated in the years of his absence.
The two meet accidentally in the Paris airport, and Irena recognizes
Josef as a man who many years ago tried to pick her up in a Prague
bar. She suddenly feels nostalgic for that moment--perhaps a missed
chance to push her life into a different groove--and starts to flirt
with Josef on the plane. Josef remembers nothing of their past
encounter and has no idea who Irena is, but he plays along out of
embarrassment and curiosity. They agree to meet in Prague.</TE>
<TE>   What looks like one of Kundera's "laughable loves"--sexual farces
of misdirected desires and casual lies--will be postponed, however,
until the novel's closing chapters. First the couple must cope with
the ambiguity of their return to the place they left more than 20
years ago. On an earlier visit to Prague, Irena discovered that her
old friends were not only completely uninterested in her life abroad
but also struggled hard to make her forget it as well--to force her
to remember only what they remembered. But attempting to connect her
old and new lives was a hasty, painful surgery: It resulted in the
amputation of the most vital part of her experience and the stitching
of her nearly forgotten past to the present moment. The process left
her feeling "shortened, diminished, like a dwarf."</TE>
<TE>   This time, Irena notices, with dismay, that her old self, a timid,
insecure woman dominated by her mother--the self she thought she had
shed forever during her tough and lonely years in Paris--is
inexplicably resurfacing and taking over her life. Her relationship
with the kindly Swede grows even more frustrating and strained, then
takes a bizarre turn. Her Parisian friends drift away--no longer
interested in a former exile turned mere expatriate.</TE>
<TE>   Irena has a chilling sensation of living through the familiar
dream of all exiles but with a new, sinister twist: You return to the
old country and realize that you never will be able to leave it
again. This time you are ensnared not by the police or border guards
but by your old, discarded life that has been lying in wait all those
years, ready to pounce on you as soon as you show up. For Irena, the
political freedom--freedom of movement and of choice--turns into a
trap. She even surprises herself feeling nostalgic for the old
impermeable borders.</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, Josef--who thinks he suffers from "nostalgic
insufficiency" or "masochistic distortion of memory" and recalls only
the ugly and shameful events from his past (although he has curiously
forgotten the ugliest and most shameful one of all)--discovers that
his country has already started to forget about itself. Everything
looks different, and Josef has difficulty finding his mother's grave;
billboards in his hometown are meaningless to him; even the spoken
language has changed its melody. Josef's old friend, once an ardent
communist, refuses to discuss the failure of a Marxist utopia. When
Josef visits his brother, the past comes back only in innuendoes,
recriminations and coy remarks about property rights: "During his
absence, an invisible broom had swept across the landscape of his
childhood, wiping away everything familiar; the encounter he had
expected never took place."</TE>
<TE>   Josef also observes a political paradox: the country, though
nominally free, seems to be less independent and less aware of its
recent history: It is quickly dissolving into the blandly homogenous
"modern world." Noticing his own old watch on his brother's wrist,
Josef realizes that he is merely an unwanted shadow passing through
this transformed reality. "He had the sense he was coming back into
the world as might a dead man emerging from his tomb after twenty
years: touching the ground with a timid foot that's lost the habit of
walking; barely recognizing the world he had lived in but continually
stumbling over the leavings from his life."</TE>
<TE>   A break in a life's continuity, says Kundera, cannot be repaired.
No one really returns. Only people living side by side in constant,
daily contact remember roughly the same things and inhabit the same
universe. When lives diverge, memories fall out of sync and all sense
of commonality evaporates. "It's only when you come back to the
country after a long absence that you notice the obvious: People
aren't interested in one another, it's taken for granted," says Josef
when he meets Irena in Prague.</TE>
<TE>   Still, in Kundera's fiction, the heroes who understand everything
often fall again into the same trap. Their sense of closeness, even
sameness, after the failure of their attempted "Grand Return" proves
to be another illusion. Not only is their coming together based on an
"unjust and revolting inequality" caused by Irena's sentimental
self-deception and Josef's awkward lie, but their recent experiences
are pushing them in opposite directions. Irena dreams of an
escape--this time a real one--not only from Prague but also from her
old self, from "the life this city is weaving for her." Josef is
closing old accounts and getting ready to return to his real, private
Ithaca--his home in Denmark and his wife's grave.</TE>
<TE>   "Ignorance" culminates in one of Kundera's typically inconclusive
endings--with Irena sleeping in a drunken stupor and Josef departing
unaware that, by shutting the door on his Czech past, he has probably
trapped Irena in the rubble of her own life.</TE>
<TE>   "The novelistic exploration of the theme of forgetting has no end
and no conclusion," Kundera remarked in one of his essays. In
"Ignorance," he returns to one of his earlier observations, that
forgetting is not really an opposite of remembering, but is part of
it. Since our memory can hold only a minuscule fraction of our
experience, we must constantly forget in order to remember. As a
result, the author points out in one of the novel's digressions how
remembered "reality" consists of accidental fragments, gaps, jump
cuts, broken narratives and falsehoods substituting for forgotten
causal links. This accidental, unreliable and constantly shifting
entity constitutes, nevertheless, a significant part of what we take
for our "self." It certainly defines our understanding, our moral
choices, our emotions, our ability or inability to love.</TE>
<TE>   Should we be surprised by the results? This is one of Kundera's
general "existential statements" and also one that is particularly
pertinent to today's Eastern and Central Europe. As Kundera correctly
intuited in his earlier novels, the most persistent problems of the
region have less to do with tyranny, oppression or other political
injustices and more to do with distorted, suppressed memories and
deposits of shame, resulting, he says, in incessant "punitive
expeditions into the past to hunt down the guilty parties."</TE>
<TE>   Finally, "Ignorance" itself presents an interesting paradox. In
his three previous, rather unsatisfactory novels, "Immortality" (his
last one written in Czech), "Slowness" and "Identity" (like
"Ignorance," written in French), Kundera tried to distance himself,
thematically and psychologically, from his native Central European
realm. In "Ignorance," which tells about the impossibility of
returns, he makes his own successful return to familiar ground and to
his old literary excellence. His irony and wit are back on target,
his characters vivid and convincing, his intelligence no longer
groping for a topic. So welcome back, Milan. Yes, this is still your
home--it seems you cannot do without it.</TE>

<HD>In Pursuit of Goya</HD>
<DH>OLD MAN GOYA: By Julia Blackburn, Pantheon Books: 240 pp.,
$23</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BRIGITTE FRASE</AU>
<BD>Brigitte Frase is critic at large for Ruminator Review.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's difficult to pin a label on "Old Man Goya." It's not a book of
art criticism, though it describes his work and contains
reproductions of etchings. It isn't a biography either, though Julia
Blackburn offers a fair amount of information about his life,
particularly the years after age 49, when an illness left him
completely deaf. It is, like her previous books about Napoleon in
exile and the eccentric Englishwoman Daisy Bates among the Australian
aborigines, an imaginative attempt to penetrate the feel of their
minds and the quality of their experience of the sensuous world.</LD>
<LD>   This modest book is a digressive ramble alongside Francisco Goya
(he later added the ennobling "de"), who lived to be 82. Blackburn
retraces his journeys, from the village of Fuendetodos, where he was
born in 1746, to the places he inhabited in Madrid, Zaragoza, in the
countryside and finally in Bordeaux, where he died in 1828. She looks
for faces and bodies that resemble his subjects, fancies him sitting
by her side as she watches a bullfight and tries to imagine the
creative process that went into his "Tauromachia" series of etchings.</LD>
<TE>   Blackburn's book is also a ruminative essay on resilience and
mortality. She begins with her own artist mother's dying and recalls
that her first childhood encounter with Goya came from looking at her
mother's copy of a series of etchings called "Caprichos." Despite
their name, these are not whimsical caprices but ambiguous, sometimes
ugly depictions of people, animals, nightmarish creatures. They,
along with a later series he called "Disparates," or nonsense tales,
anticipate the eerie and sinister atmospherics of Surrealist painters
such as Max Ernst and Giorgio de Chirico.</TE>
<TE>   Goya was an amazingly inventive artist. He became the court
painter to King Carlos IV and painted single portraits and group
scenes. What Blackburn notices but does not attempt to explain is
that Goya not only doesn't flatter his subjects, he shows them as the
inbred feebleminded family they are. (Amazingly enough, they didn't
object. Maybe they only noticed Goya's attention to details of
clothes and backgrounds.) And he paints heir Ferdinand with the
prescient look of an artist who has studied faces and recognizes an
evil mind behind a bland face. It's in the eyes. Ferdinand restored
the Inquisition in Spain after France sacked it; Spain was a sideshow
to Napoleon's war with England in the years 1808 to 1812.</TE>
<TE>   The only reason I know what those portraits look like is because I
went to a bookstore and looked them up in a glossy art book.
Blackburn only describes them. Also, she's made the rather
viewer-unfriendly decision of reproducing the copper plates of Goya's
etchings rather than the final black-and-white images. So the hues
are reversed, which makes them hard to decipher; all the more
difficult because the reproductions are in dull dark and pale grays.
Her reasoning is that she wants us to see what Goya first looked at
in his etching process, but her decision blunts the force of the
pictures; we're looking through fog.</TE>
<TE>   When war came to Spain, Goya was living in his country house west
of Madrid with his mistress Leocadia and her or their daughter
Rosario. He began to cover every wall of the house with strange and
terrible pictures. When he went to Madrid and Zaragoza, he saw the
pillage and destruction, the mutilated carcasses, the obscene
hangings and maimings that became the subject of his paintings and
etchings called "The Disasters of War." Here Blackburn makes an
interesting point. He could hear nothing, but his pictures seem full
of noise, guns, shouts and lamentations. It is as if his eyes were
doing double duty. His pictures gain a terrible intensity from that
synesthetic merging.</TE>
<TE>   When Ferdinand's Inquisition began asking questions about Goya's
loyalty, he fled to Bordeaux. Old, often sick--even a bout of yellow
fever--he kept working and experimenting. He began carving ivory
miniatures and learned lithography. He wrote, "I lack everything but
my will power and that I have in excess."</TE>
<TE>   Blackburn's impressionistic approach to Goya is too lax. She
admits her Spanish is rudimentary and claims, "Goya leaves everyone
free to make their own interpretation of the kind of person he was;
what he believed in or did not ... who he loved ... whether he was
tormented by savage nightmares ... or was simply a witness ...." In
other words, "Old Man Goya" is a personal memoir with a novel about
Goya woven into it. She wrote what she liked, but whether she has
truly served Goya is doubtful.</TE>

<DH>GORGEOUS LIES: A Novel, By Martha McPhee, Harcourt: 336
pp., $25</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL HARRIS</AU>
<BD>Michael Harris is a regular contributor to Book Review.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Martha McPhee's previous novel, "Bright Angel Time," thrust us back
into the countercultural promise and chaos of the 1970s. Narrated by
8-year-old Kate Cooper, it described the merger of two broken
families in a van driven cross-country by her mother Eve's new
boyfriend, a Texas-born ex-Jesuit and gestalt therapist named Anton
Furey. The three Cooper girls and the five Furey kids--two boys and
three girls--were along for the ride, bound for nobody knew where.</LD>
<LD>   In "Gorgeous Lies," McPhee fast-forwards to the present. Anton is
dying of pancreatic cancer at Chardin, the hilltop New Jersey farm he
dreamed would represent French theologian Pierre Teilhard de
Chardin's Omega Point, a "perfect meeting place of the human and the
divine." His scattered offspring converge to nurse him and to quarrel
among themselves. They include Alice, his and Eve's "uniting child,"
who takes on the role of peacemaker.</LD>
<TE>   In times like the '70s, when traditional certainties fade, it's
harder than ever to tell a charismatic, visionary leader from a
charlatan, especially when they are the same person. A
quarter-century later, Anton's children, his wife, his ex-wife, his
wife's ex-husband, his mother-in-law, his current mistress, the
architect who built Chardin, the enlightenment-seekers who received
therapy from Anton and the local businesspeople to whom he
chronically owed money are still unsure of which he was.</TE>
<TE>   All agree on one thing: Anton was a charmer. His "beautiful,
wicked grin," his assurances that no matter how bad a situation
looked, "it'll be all right," his way of calling everyone "Babe," his
idealism and sense of fun all managed to disarm skeptics and seduce
even the marginally willing. And if Chardin, once a magnet for
reporters and TV crews, didn't change the world, if Anton never got
around to writing his revolutionary book on human sexuality, did this
mean he was a failure? That the trip wasn't worth taking?</TE>
<TE>   The story McPhee gives us this time--using multiple points of
view, so that it's often hard to tell the children apart--avoids the
extremes of hippie nostalgia and conservative revisionism and doesn't
provide any simple answers.</TE>
<TE>   Her prose captures the Chardin mood: Elegant and airy, it seems to
levitate even the grubbiest details--theft and drug addiction and
plumbing problems, Anton's tyrannical side and the querulous
"impostor" who takes over his mind as the pain of illness racks him
and his lapsed Catholicism rekindles as a fear of hell.</TE>
<TE>   Anton's failure, McPhee shows in the novel's flashbacks, is always
relative. He fails upward. After washing out of a Jesuit seminary
because of a homosexual affair, he marries the heiress to a Texas oil
fortune. After buying Chardin with her money, he meets Eve and tries,
with their blended tribe, to respond to California guru George
Leonard's 1970 call for American families to be "bigger, less
well-defined." The Furey-Cooper children don't evolve into higher
beings, but neither do they crash and burn. They turn out about the
same as other bright kids of their economic class, except that they
have more adventures--a mixed blessing, according to one of Anton's
daughters:</TE>
<TE>   "We made movies all the time, taking turns on who'd be the star
.... We had fine parties and listened to good music and ate well and
read poetry to each other on the roof of the barn while the sun set
into the fields. We traveled all over the world, or the Western
Hemisphere, anyway. But I'd trade it all--who wouldn't?--for my
mother and father to have remained married." Anton fails to write his
book, partly because he's distracted and unorganized, partly because
it's no easy task to set Western civilization straight on sexual
matters it has been bungling (he thinks) for millenniums. His
success, deeper yet more ephemeral, is in the realm of personality:
He defines reality for everyone who meets him.</TE>
<TE>   This is a priceless gift and a crime, McPhee shows us. For with
Anton dying, all these people, even those who dislike him, are faced
with the loss of their lives' meaning. They still want Anton's love,
though he's past being able to give it. They want the trip to
continue because they don't know how to get out of the van, even when
it stops.</TE>

<DH>BROTHERHOOD OF THE BOMB: The Tangled Lives and Loyalties of
Robert Oppenheimer, Ernest Lawrence, and Edward Teller, By Gregg
Herken, John Macrae/Henry Holt: 450 pp., $30</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID HOLLOWAY</AU>
<BD>David Holloway is the author of "The Soviet Union and
the Arms Race" and "Stalin and the Bomb." He is the director of the
Institute for International Studies at Stanford University.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In "Brotherhood of the Bomb," Gregg Herken has written an immensely
readable account of the lives of three physicists who led us into the
Nuclear Age. Robert Oppenheimer directed the wartime effort to design
and make the atomic bomb at Los Alamos; Ernest Lawrence developed the
method that produced the uranium-235 for the Hiroshima bomb; and
Edward Teller, the only one of the three still alive, was the chief
designer of the hydrogen bomb. Much of the story is familiar
territory, but Herken provides a new angle by looking at the
intersecting lives of his three protagonists.</LD>
<LD>   Herken begins his story in the 1930s in Berkeley, where Lawrence
was building machines to accelerate elementary particles; in 1939,
Lawrence received the Nobel Prize for this work. Oppenheimer was the
leading theoretical physicist in Berkeley, and he and Lawrence became
close friends in spite of differences in temperament and political
outlook. Teller's role grew after 1942, when he was recognized as one
of the main advocates of research on the hydrogen bomb.</LD>
<TE>   Herken shows how Lawrence brought the enthusiasm and the skills of
an American entrepreneur to physics, ushering it into the age of Big
Science. A brilliant organizer and director of research, he could do
unexpected things. It was Lawrence who twice proposed, in meetings in
May and June 1945, that the bomb be demonstrated to the Japanese in
"some innocuous but striking manner" to persuade them to surrender
before the bomb was used to destroy cities. In the mid-1950s, when it
became possible to meet Soviet physicists, he was taken with the
prospect that such contacts might lead to breaking down the Iron
Curtain.</TE>
<TE>   But Oppenheimer and Lawrence fell out over politics and personal
matters. And after the war, Oppenheimer resisted Teller's push for
the hydrogen bomb and opposed the creation of a second nuclear weapon
laboratory. Despite his opposition, however, by the time the book's
narrative ends, in the mid-1950s, the United States had tested a
hydrogen bomb 1,000 times more powerful than the Hiroshima bomb and
set up a second nuclear weapon laboratory named for Lawrence (the
Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory) to work on the hydrogen bomb.
After loyalty-security hearings on Oppenheimer, the U.S. government
declared him a security risk and deprived him of security clearance.</TE>
<TE>   Herken had access to government documents, personal papers and
memoirs, as well as to FBI transcripts of recorded telephone
conversations. "Brotherhood of the Bomb" also benefits from new
evidence about Soviet espionage from declassified Russian documents
and from the Venona documents, consisting of U.S. intercepts of coded
messages between Moscow and its agents in the United States. With
these sources, Herken provides a collective biography of three men
who left a huge mark on history through their political advice and
administrative skill as well as through their scientific research.</TE>
<TE>   There is one important new source, however, that Herken was not
able to use and assess: Soviet documents listing Oppenheimer as a
secret or covert member of the Communist Party, which have recently
been declassified. The suspicion that Oppenheimer was a Communist is
a major element in Herken's story, as are Oppenheimer's consistent
denials that he was ever a member of the party.</TE>
<TE>   All three men worked hard to develop nuclear weapons and became
deeply involved in Washington councils on nuclear policy. The great
disagreement among them, however, was over what priority to give
development of the hydrogen bomb. Teller, supported by Lawrence,
pressed for an all-out effort. Oppenheimer, though he changed his
mind from time to time, opposed its development in the late 1940s and
early 1950s for moral, political and technical reasons.</TE>
<TE>   At Oppenheimer's security hearing, Teller testified in a way that
suggested that Oppenheimer should be deprived of his security
clearance because he had taken the wrong position on the hydrogen
bomb. As a result, Teller experienced hostility and ostracism from
the physics community, which apparently caused him considerable pain.</TE>
<TE>   Oppenheimer was undoubtedly the most complex of the three men. He
proved to be an unexpectedly brilliant director of Los Alamos. But
his close ties to the Communist Party raised questions from the very
beginning about his suitability for such a position. He was granted
the necessary security clearance only at the insistence of Gen.
Leslie Groves, the head of the Manhattan Project.</TE>
<TE>   In 1943 a communist friend, Haakon Chevalier, mentioned to
Oppenheimer that he had been told of someone who could pass
information discreetly to the Soviet Union. Oppenheimer quickly cut
off the conversation. Subsequently he gave different accounts of it
to Groves and the security people in the Manhattan Project. When he
was confronted with these differences at the security hearing, he
could not explain them. His behavior was hard to fathom, and it
fueled suspicions about his loyalty to the United States. Herken
suggests, plausibly though without proof, that Oppenheimer's evasions
were designed to protect his brother, Frank, who may have been
involved as well.</TE>
<TE>   Oppenheimer was an enigmatic figure. The decision not to renew his
security clearance was a terrible blow to him, and he appeared to
many to be a victim of McCarthyism. He was too complex a figure,
however, to conform to the image of a persecuted liberal. In the
summer of 1945 he helped to quash Lawrence's proposal for an atomic
bomb demonstration, thus making certain that it would be used against
Hiroshima and Nagasaki. He opposed the hydrogen bomb through the
early 1950s but at the same time encouraged the development of
tactical nuclear weapons and more powerful fission weapons.</TE>
<TE>   Herken quotes a revealing comment made to Oppenheimer by a Dutch
physicist: "Robert, the reason you know so much about ethics is that
you have no character." Oppenheimer characteristically quoted this in
a letter to a colleague. Perhaps he did not have a very clear sense
of his own self, which he sometimes presented to others in a playful
manner. Some people saw Oppenheimer as a poseur, but that seems
unfair in view of the deep seriousness with which he regarded nuclear
weapons and the effort he made after the war to secure international
control of atomic energy.</TE>
<TE>   Do the recently declassified Soviet documents listing Oppenheimer
as a member of the Communist Party change our understanding of him
and his role? Assuming that the documents are genuine, they do indeed
throw into sharper relief the contradictions in Oppenheimer's
character and in his actions. They do not prove that he was a spy or
an "enabler" of spies. There was extensive espionage at Los Alamos,
but Oppenheimer cannot be shown to have known or approved of it. The
documents do indicate, however, that unless Oppenheimer persuaded
himself that he had not really been a member of the party (what does
"membership" mean?), he perjured himself in the 1954 hearings.</TE>
<TE>   Herken tells this story with great skill, making excellent use of
copious sources. What he does not do, however, is stand back from his
narrative to analyze the issues that it raises.</TE>
<TE>   One of the charges made by Oppenheimer's critics, for example, was
that his advice on the hydrogen bomb would, if followed, have
imperiled the security of the United States. Twenty-five years ago,
Herbert York, a Lawrence protege and the first director of the
Lawrence Livermore Laboratory, demonstrated that U.S. national
security would not have been harmed if Oppenheimer's advice had been
taken.</TE>
<TE>   One can be skeptical about the possibility of the Soviet Union's
reciprocating American restraint in the development of the hydrogen
bomb and still believe that restraint could have been tried without
harming the United States. Herken does not address this question but
sticks to the narrative of the arguments as they were presented at
the time, which is a pity. We should nevertheless be grateful for
"Brotherhood of the Bomb," a well-written, well-documented, exciting
and yet unhappy tale of a crucial encounter between science and
politics.</TE>

<DH>NATASHA'S DANCE: A Cultural History of Russia, By Orlando
Figes, Metropolitan Books: 730 pp., $35</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The "Natasha" whose "dance" Orlando Figes has chosen as the
identifying metaphor for his "cultural history of Russia" is Natasha
Rostova, heroine of Tolstoy's "War and Peace." After an exciting day
of fox-hunting, she and her aristocratic party repair to the modest
home of "Uncle," a distant relative much lower in social status.
There a very "Russian" (nonaristocratic) meal is topped off by some
equally "Russian" guitar music, which inspires Natasha, taught only
the most refined "European" ballroom dancing, to
perform--perfectly--a very "Russian" (peasant) folk dance.</LD>
<LD>   Tolstoy (quite implausibly) attributes this miraculous act of
cultural cross-dressing to the "Russian air she breathed"; for him
the dance symbolized a much-desired symbiotic unity of the whole
Russian nation, lord and peasant, shown in his novel in their common
determination to expel the French invaders of 1812 and, as here, to
some degree sharing a common "culture." In Orlando Figes' history of
this culture, the major theme is the interaction thus symbolized
between the European culture first assimilated by the nobility and
the "native" culture of the peasant masses.</LD>
<TE>   Figes, author of two earlier books on Russian history (a study of
the pre-Revolutionary peasantry and a prize-winning history of the
1917 Revolution), begins the story of Europeanization with the
reforms of Peter the Great in the early 18th century and continued
less coercively by his successors. Not surprisingly, this program of
cultural assimilation triggered a reaction. Were Russians nothing but
copycats? Even in the 18th century, latent patriots therefore sought
to celebrate what was native in their culture. This highly charged
internal face-off between European influence and Russian tradition
continued even after the Revolution of 1917. It is a complex and
fascinating story, and Figes tells it well, with lots of picturesque
detail.</TE>
<TE>   Figes has formulated the nature of this confrontation impartially
and clearly, recognizing that no cultures are "pure"; all are
amalgams of various influences developed over time, some home-grown,
but mostly borrowed. He also does not claim completeness; an
all-inclusive history would require many volumes, even if it confined
itself to "high" culture (literature, art, architecture, music)
rather than to culture in the larger anthropological sense. Instead,
he has selected certain recurrent themes, which he formulates and
selectively illustrates.</TE>
<TE>   We begin with St. Petersburg, Peter's fiat city, his "window to
Europe." As Figes aptly puts it, St. Petersburg was not only a new
city, it was also a "project of cultural engineering." Peter
compelled the leading noble families to build Western-style houses in
the new capital. One such family was the Sheremetevs, whose
extravagant palace on the Fontanka Canal much later contained the
humble dwelling of the great poet Anna Akhmatova, providing Figes
with a neat symbolic linkage. Where once a serf orchestra had
performed European music, a poet of European stature, whose portrait
by Modigliani hung on her wall, recorded in immortal words the
devastation her country suffered from the nightmarish cruelty and
cultural vandalism of Stalin's tyranny.</TE>
<TE>   Between these two poles, Figes takes us through successive stages,
among them the "Decembrist" conspiracy of 1825, when the "children of
1812" made a hopelessly ineffective attempt to "Europeanize," by coup
d'etat, the archaic Russian autocracy. Figes then focuses vividly on
one of the conspirators, Sergei Volkonsky, scion of a prominent
aristocratic family, who spent 30 years in Siberian exile. During
those years, the stifling reign of Nicholas I, the confrontation
between "Europe" and "Russia" continued on many levels, the
government's efforts to isolate the country from baneful Western
influences being countered by the intelligentsia's determination to
continue importing them.</TE>
<TE>   Yet elements of that same intelligentsia also sought earnestly for
authentic cultural values among the Russian folk, and reflections of
such values found their way into the work of writers (Aleksandr
Pushkin, Nikolai Gogol, Mikhail Lermontov, later many others),
painters (Aleksei Venetsianov, later Ilya Repin) and composers
(Mikhail Glinka, later Modest Musorgsky, Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov,
Aleksandr Borodin). Figes next takes up a favorite theme in Russian
literature (and life): the contrast between St. Petersburg and
Moscow. St. Petersburg was the quintessential "geometric" planned
European city, locus of the court; Moscow was the overgrown Russian
village, where gentlefolk maintained capacious mansions where they
spent their winters and overspent their incomes on lavish
hospitality. Figes provides succulent details of gluttonous Moscow
banquets. Figes also traces, later in the century, Moscow's enormous
growth as a commercial and industrial center and the development of
merchant dynasties, some of which became notable patrons of the arts.
Finally, after 1917, Moscow triumphed, replacing St. Petersburg as
the capital and becoming an "imperial city."</TE>
<TE>   The populist movement of the 1870s was another effort to bring the
two cultures together, as hundreds of educated youth "went to the
people," hoping to bring the peasants "European" enlightenment and to
assimilate what was valuable in the peasants' own culture, especially
their communal landholding system, idolized as a natural nucleus of
socialism. The attempted integration was a failure, but
peasant-worship survived. Count Leo Tolstoy dressed and longed to
live like a peasant but continued to read in four languages and write
profusely. Yet disillusionment did set in. Anton Chekhov's "Peasants"
and Ivan Bunin's "The Village" shocked the peasant lovers with images
of a peasantry as debased in culture as they were impoverished.
Perhaps, as Maxim Gorky believed, the peasants were no repository of
a uniquely Russian culture but simply savages with a propensity for
violence. Paradoxically, in the same pre-revolutionary period, Igor
Stravinsky and Sergei Diaghilev captivated Europe with Russian music
and ballet that drew heavily on Russian folk culture.</TE>
<TE>   One cultural locus that the Russian upper and lower classes could
have shared was the Orthodox Church, but even this linkage was
flawed. Much of the peasant population had broken with the church in
the 17th century, becoming known as the "Old Believers" and later
splitting into many sects; and the Europeanized elite traditionally
took their religion lightly, many following Western leads and
becoming atheists. Yet a contrary tendency was also present,
manifested in the belief of such writers as Gogol and Feodor
Dostoevsky that Russian peasant Christianity was destined to save the
world.</TE>
<TE>   Figes also takes us on a welcome excursion among the Asian
minorities of the empire, showing that they too left their mark on
Russian culture, using the painter Vasily Kandinsky as his example.
Clearly, the centuries of Mongol-Tatar domination must have had an
effect, not all of it negative. Though not strictly Asian, the
Caucasus, conquered by Russia in the 19th century, was likewise an
area of cultural ambiguity. Were the Russians carrying civilization
to such peoples as the Armenians and Georgians, who had embraced
Christianity six centuries before they did?</TE>
<TE>   Crossing into the Soviet period, we find a new configuration, a
small minority struggling to impose a European utopian ideology on
the masses, capitalizing on and manipulating their accumulated
discontents. Society was upended, and the former "haves" became the
lowest of "have-nots," 2 million or so of them being driven out of
the country altogether. Still, the proletarian Soviet regime needed
the services of the surviving intelligentsia to create a culture that
would "engineer human souls," according to communist specifications.
Literature, theater, cinema and music were all pressed into service,
and Figes provides striking detail on the troubled careers of such
figures as poet Vladimir Mayakovsky, theater director Vsevolod
Meyerhold, film director Sergei Eisenstein and composer Dmitry
Shostakovich. The regime was a capricious taskmaster, little
concerned with artistic integrity; and these and many others had
grave difficulties complying with its demands, their careers often
ending in arrest, exile and even execution.</TE>
<TE>   Figes ends his wide-ranging tour with a welcome chapter on the
Russian diaspora, which carried Russian culture to foreign soil. The
exiles' creativity remained extraordinary. Such figures as Bunin,
writer Aleksei Remizov, poet Vladislav Khodasevich, poet Marina
Tsvetaeva and writer Vladimir Nabokov; artists Mikhail Larionov,
Natalia Goncharova and Marc Chagall; composers Sergei Rachmaninov,
Sergei Prokofiev and Stravinsky; and many others, though living in
the West, each in his or her own way remained Russian. Figes
concludes with a moving account of Stravinsky's first return to
Russia, in 1962. "The smell of Russian earth is different," the
composer proclaimed. "I love it."</TE>
<TE>   The amount of material Figes has at least surveyed is staggering.
He tells us that he relied on a team of assistants, and the book has
a formidable apparatus of endnotes and "suggestions for further
reading." Perhaps his process of supervising his assistants was
faulty; at any rate, a disturbing number of errors made it into the
text. Many are trivial, but even the trivial ones undermine one's
confidence in other "facts" the author adduces. One example:
Lexicographers believe that it was not, as Figes claims, Napoleon's
soldiers who created the now international word "bistro" by demanding
fast service in Moscow (bystro is Russian for "fast"), but Russian
soldiers in 1814 doing the same in Paris.</TE>
<TE>   However, no doubt such mistakes are troubling mainly to scholars.
From "Natasha's Dance," the ordinary reader will get a vivid,
entertaining and enlightening account of what it has meant to be
culturally a Russian over the last three centuries.</TE>

<DH>A BED FOR THE NIGHT: Humanitarianism in Crisis, By David
Rieff, Simon &amp; Schuster: 384 pp., $26</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SAMANTHA POWER</AU>
<BD>Samantha Power, a fellow at the Open Society Institute,
is the author of "'A Problem From Hell': America and the Age of
Genocide."</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"If Auschwitz were operating today," said Rony Brauman, the former
head of the Nobel Prize-winning Doctors Without Borders, "it would
probably be described as a humanitarian emergency." It was the tired
perspective of a tired humanitarian.</LD>
<LD>   In the public imagination, "humanitarians" emerged from the
chaotic and bloody 1990s as saintly antidotes to the ethnic
chauvinists, dictators and other spoilers who got in the way of the
"end of history." College applicants declared their aim of becoming
"relief workers." Hundreds of millions of dollars poured into
humanitarian organizations, which put the money to noble--if not
always efficient--use, tackling crises in Bosnia, Burundi, Rwanda,
Sierra Leone, East Timor, Kosovo, Sudan, Chechnya and the like. And
by the end of the decade, even Western governments were latching on
to the appeal of the humanitarian epithet. War, it seemed, was
obsolete; henceforth, the just, bloody battles fought by the West
would be sanitized and spruced up as "humanitarian interventions."</LD>
<TE>   For all of the presumed righteousness of the humanitarian
enterprise, detractors have long abounded. Some government officials
turned up their noses at those they envisaged as Scandinavians in
Nelson Mandela T-shirts engaged in squishy and expendable "social
work." But none have been as critical as the humanitarians
themselves: the men and women who worked within nongovernmental
organizations (NGOs) and suffered their bureaucratic foibles and
donor-driven turf warfare. Those, like Brauman, who found themselves
proffering food, shelter and medicine when confronted with mass
murder, rampant disease, starvation and enormous refugee flows,
suffered grave existential doubts, knowing that the source of misery
was political rather than humanitarian. Nongovernmental groups could
attempt to treat symptoms, aid workers knew, but only powerful
governments could tackle causes.</TE>
<TE>   David Rieff, a journalist and author of four previous books,
including "Slaughterhouse: Bosnia and the Failure of the West," has
become a category of critic unto himself. He spent the last decade
roaming the world's conflict zones and refugee camps, often with the
aid of the aid givers themselves, making himself the most forceful
and, in the nongovernmental aid world, influential exposer of the
institutional contradictions, hidden agendas and confusion of roles
among those who have enlisted in what fellow critic Alex de Waal has
called the "Humanitarian International."</TE>
<TE>   Rieff understands that life is hard for low-paid relief workers
(whom he calls "the last of the just"), that political support and
financial resources are often spare and that their day-to-day choices
are unenviable. But these realities must not shield the self-styled
altruists from criticism. Rieff is an outsider's insider, one who can
identify the perverse consequences of and the dangerous hubris behind
humanitarian intrusions in needy societies but who doesn't bring the
defensiveness of a stakeholder.</TE>
<TE>   In his provocative new polemic, "A Bed for the Night:
Humanitarianism in Crisis," Rieff offers us the big picture--and oh,
what a dispiriting picture it is. Rieff writes that the apparent
"triumph" of humanitarianism in the 1990s--the decision by frustrated
aid workers to urge governmental intervention and of governments to
dabble in humanitarian work--has proved "both morally and
operationally, to be a poisoned chalice." The meaning and mandate of
humanitarian relief work has been so distorted by mission creep that
the aid industry stands "verging on cognitive and moral meltdown."
The rescuers, Rieff suggests, are in dire need of rescue, less from
the world's evil-doers than from themselves.</TE>
<TE>   Rieff argues that relief workers emerged from the 1990s
punch-drunk and transformed into politicized advocates. In Bosnia and
Rwanda, aid organizations saw they were being manipulated and
degraded by timid Western statesmen. In Bosnia, beginning in 1992,
the United States and Europe used the delivery of humanitarian aid as
an alibi to avoid military action. Unwilling to stop genocidal
attacks on civilians but under pressure to "do something," the major
powers gave the United Nations more than a million dollars a day to
feed civilians under threat or in flight. Then they gallingly turned
around and said they could not undertake much-needed military action
because doing so would interfere with the life-and-death feeding
operations.</TE>
<TE>   But the worst was yet to come. As Rieff writes, "If Bosnia turned
humanitarianism on its ear ideologically, Rwanda broke its heart."
During the genocide, while about 800,000 Rwandans were murdered, the
United States blocked military action. More egregiously, because the
Clinton Administration feared it would eventually be called upon to
rescue embattled UN peacekeepers, U.S. officials demanded the
withdrawal of the armed blue helmets. The few relief workers who
remained lacked the means to stem the extermination campaign. Indeed,
NGOs were powerless even to protect their Rwandan employees. Most of
the Tutsis who had worked for humanitarian organizations (and those
who worked for Western embassies, for that matter) were murdered.
Once relief workers finally got geared up to offer help, they
supplied assistance not to the victims of the genocide but to the
victimizers, the genocidaire who had fled Rwanda and been struck by a
fatal wave of cholera. Again, the bystanders to genocide cited their
relief efforts as proof of their generosity. But this time, by
tending to the refugees' humanitarian needs, Western governments and
aid agencies helped the killers regroup for more murderous attacks.
Rieff quotes one aid worker who was deployed at the height of the
emergency and who realized only upon returning to the United States,
"Hey, I've been busting my butt for a bunch of ax murderers!"</TE>
<TE>   Here, according to Rieff, many humanitarians (a term he never
actually defines) decided they had had enough of neutrality in the
face of mass murder and enough of putting "Band-Aids on malignant
tumors." If NGOs did not become advocates, they would become
accomplices. Since only states could properly stem the carnage, aid
workers began to call for and work with state power. The
long-standing notion of "humanitarianism against politics" was
replaced by a politicized humanitarianism.</TE>
<TE>   In subsequent emergencies in Kosovo and Afghanistan, Rieff tells
us, aid groups worked in dangerously collaborative fashion with
states. In Kosovo, when NATO bombed the Serbs in the spring of 1999,
he claims that humanitarianism had "all but begged for the chance to
be used as a moral warrant for warfare." In Afghanistan, U.S.
officials anxious to win over public opinion dropped precision-guided
munitions along with (imprecisely guided) meals-ready-to-eat. U.S.
forces also tried to coordinate their efforts with the relief and
refugee groups. As Secretary of State Colin L. Powell said in October
2001, "The NGOs are such a force multiplier for us, such an important
part of our combat team."</TE>
<TE>   In this original but overly tidy synopsis of the last decade,
Rieff suggests that Afghanistan marked the end of the era of
independent humanitarianism. He argues that Oxfam, CARE, the
International Rescue Committee, the office of the U.N. High Commissar
for Refugees and other aid agencies are increasingly becoming tools
of governments, and he fears aid givers and war fighters will
henceforth be indistinguishable. A skeptic that anything governmental
can ever be humanitarian, he urges NGOs to return to neutrality,
whatever its imperfections. CARE should not be building human rights
monitoring into its refugee camp contracts. Aid agencies should not
be pulling out of Zimbabwe on human rights grounds. Politicians
should play politics, while the humanitarians should supply macaroni
and tents. "Let humanitarianism be humanitarianism," Rieff concludes.
"Let it save some lives, whatever the compromises it has to make
along the way, and let it tend to the victims .... [I]s that really
so little?"</TE>
<TE>   As is true of most of Rieff's critiques, his plea here for
humility and mission retrenchment will inject a valuable degree of
self-consciousness into organizations known for their ad hoc and
reactive decision-making. Instead of forever "fighting the last war,"
as they have been prone to do, Rieff urges them to pull back and
respond not merely to short-term need but also to long-term
sustainability.</TE>
<TE>   But while the critiques can be helpful and often quite brilliant,
they contradict one another and leave readers groping for a
take-away. Having criticized the aid groups for operating while
Western governments did nothing in Bosnia and Rwanda, he then seems
to bash them for operating while Western governments did something in
Kosovo and Afghanistan. He seems to be suggesting that
humanitarianism once was, and again can be, apolitical. Yet he would
be hard-pressed to offer historical examples of pristine, apolitical
humanitarian work. Was the Red Cross really neutral in World War II
when it went ahead and inspected concentration camps and then kept
silent? Was it an act of neutrality for the United Nations to give
the Bosnian Serbs 70% of its relief deliveries in return for access
to Muslim territory? And, in Afghanistan, before the Taliban's fall,
which organizations were behaving neutrally: those that supplied food
to agents of the Taliban regime or those that stomped back home to
protest the persecution of women?</TE>
<TE>   When confronting most crises, whether historic or contemporary,
aid agencies generally muddle along on a case-by-case basis. They
weigh insufficient information, extrapolate somewhat blindly about
long-term pros and cons, and reluctantly arrive at decisions meant to
do the most good and the least harm. By choosing to be involved, most
of these organizations have long ago eschewed the possibility of
neutrality. And surely the best test of their performance is not a
cookie-cutter demand that they avoid consideration of human rights
but Rieff's worthy (and not at all neutral) inquiry as to whether
they have "kept a single jackboot out of a single human face."</TE>
<TE>   Part of the confusion in "A Bed for the Night" stems from the fact
that Rieff claims to be taking aim at aid workers when in fact it is
Western governments that are the main target of his ire. It is the
United States and its allies that have most contributed to the
blurring of roles, by first leaving aid workers to tackle political
problems and then, belatedly, undertaking humanitarian tasks for
geopolitical reasons. While Rieff blames the aid organizations for
pulling governments into humanitarianism, he knows that it was not a
humanitarian summons that led Western governments to bomb Yugoslavia
or Afghanistan; it was the major powers' strategic concerns.</TE>
<TE>   It is true that many Western relief workers welcomed these bombing
campaigns, which enabled them to intensify their relief efforts. But
the views of NGOs neither influenced NATO planning nor rendered the
aid workers more vulnerable to retaliation than they would otherwise
have been as NATO nationals. The NGOs may wish to do more to distance
themselves from governments. But they will be powerless to stop
determined governments from appropriating the humanitarian mantle.</TE>
<TE>   Rieff sounds sorry when he writes, "What Afghanistan demonstrated
was that humanitarianism was too important a matter to be left to
humanitarians." But if he regrets Western military involvement in
humanitarian missions, he need not worry. The Kosovo and Afghanistan
interventions are exceptional, and it is unlikely that NATO will
spend the coming decades clamoring to assume roles traditionally
performed by Doctors Without Borders.</TE>
<TE>   The tragic reality is that American and European leaders are
generally determined to steer clear of those causes that are "merely"
humanitarian. The vast majority of NGOs thus operate in obscurity,
with neither television cameras nor Western soldiers present to
confuse or attempt to control them. Today's sufferers of AIDS,
genocide and politically induced famine can be heard wishing out loud
for Al Qaeda operatives to infiltrate their neighborhoods so that the
mighty might cast a glance or a buck their way.</TE>
<TE>   Under such circumstances, it should not be surprising that
humanitarianism will remain in a state of perpetual crisis. What is
surprising, in light of the impossibility and thanklessness of the
tasks they face, is that the humanitarians remain at all.</TE>

<HD>When Rules Are Made to Be Broken</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN RECHY</AU>
<BD>John Rechy is the author of 13 novels, including the
forthcoming "The Life and Adventures of Lyle Clemens."</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The three most often repeated "rules of writing," recited by rote and
left uninvestigated and unchallenged in virtually every writing
workshop and English class are capable of doing terrible damage to
good writing. The Terrible Three are:</LD>
<LD>   Show, don't tell.</LD>
<LD>   Nonsense. Good writing involves "showing"--that is,
dramatizing--as well as "telling"--employing exposition. An avoidance
of "telling" may convolute clear motivation (exemplified by
"showing"). It compromises setting. It obfuscates situation.</LD>
<TE>   We do not speak of "story-showing"; we speak of "storytelling."
Many great works of literature are largely expositional, including
Swift's "Gulliver's Travels," Cervantes' "Don Quixote" and--try this
one--Proust's "Remembrance of Things Past." In the latter's
"Overture," Proust roams, in exposition, through the inner landscape
of the child Marcel's need for his mother's nightly bedtime kiss. Now
he can move on to exemplify--"show"--the drama of his foiled
attempts. Thomas Bernhard's masterpiece, "Concrete," is all gasping
exposition until the end opens into eerie dramatization.</TE>
<TE>   The effect of "scenes"--showing--may be created through refined
"telling," as in Gabriel Garcia Marquez's "One Hundred Years of
Solitude," which is in major part exposition, with scant dialogue
often used as dramatic punctuation: "The world is round, like an
orange."</TE>
<TE>   A good way to add life to exposition is to capture a dramatic
moment, to hear someone speak, see someone move, act--yes,
show--since time is the accumulation of moments.</TE>
<TE>   Even in film, the quintessential art of "showing," great directors
like Ingmar Bergman, Akira Kurosawa and Billy Wilder use bold
exposition. Alma, in Bergman's "Persona," announces, "I am a
24-year-old nurse." The psychiatrist involved informs that an older
actress went silent during a performance of "Electra" as we see the
actress' anguished face. A mysterious male voice tells us that the
nurse and the actress were advised by the psychiatrist to go into the
country, as we see them moving along a jagged landscape that projects
(a la Alain Robbe-Grillet) the emotional entanglement they are
entering.</TE>
<TE>   Write about what you know.</TE>
<TE>   Many great works of art would never have been written had the
author restricted himself to what he "knows." The moody spinster
Emily Bronte wrote of a love so passionate that it finds its only
safe place in hell. Think about Dostoevsky's "Crime and Punishment."
Purportedly, Vladimir Nabokov was outraged when little girls popped
up at his door on Halloween, inferring that he wrote in "Lolita"
about what he knew. Gustave Flaubert, asked how he came to understand
Emma so well, answered, "Madame Bovary, c'est moi." The good fiction
writer relies primarily on imagination, not information, not
investigation.</TE>
<TE>   The writer doesn't deal with "reality." He deals with
verisimilitude. We would be just as jarred if, along the weary way to
California, Ma and Tom Joad encountered crazy old Dorothy trudging
along dusty paths, as we would be if crazy old Dorothy encountered Ma
and Tom Joad skipping along her yellow brick road. In both
instances--Steinbeck's "The Grapes of Wrath" and L. Frank Baum's "The
Wonderful Wizard of Oz"--it is not reality or fantasy but
verisimilitude that would be jarred.</TE>
<TE>   A better admonition: Write about what you feel. Too lofty. Write
about what you feel you know. Too elevated. This is it: Write about
whatever you want.</TE>
<TE>   Always have a sympathetic character for the reader to relate to.</TE>
<TE>   Shakespeare's Macbeth, Lady Macbeth, King Lear, the annoying
Hamlet--none grasps our sympathy entirely; nor does Othello. Albert
Camus' "The Stranger" is no lover of humanity. In Greek tragedy, just
as in popular bestsellers, the most villainous and unsympathetic
characters are the ones we remember, including Medea (about whom this
writer, however, wrote sympathetically in a novel, proving that Jason
was the villain). Ellen Berent, in that underrated novel "Leave Her
to Heaven" by Ben Ames Williams, is chilling and unforgettable; she
blithely kills everyone who comes close to her husband. Blanche
DuBois is sympathetic until we imagine her taking up quarters in
one's own house and then our sympathy might rush to villainous
Stanley. Willy Loman is most often irritating, Lolita is dumb but
cunning and Humbert Humbert is a pervert.</TE>
<TE>   We love hateful, selfish, manipulative characters--Scarlett
O'Hara, Rhett Butler, Iago. Catherine and Heathcliff are horrors (and
still manage at times to tear our hearts out). Whom do you sympathize
with in any of Kafka's books? The governess in Henry James' "The Turn
of the Screw" is a driven demon. In Carson McCullers' perfect novel,
"Reflections in a Golden Eye," it is instantly apparent that the
author despises every one of her characters, and so does the reader,
but one reads on. Despicable, awful, frightening--but fascinating.
That's the key: Fascinating. Write about characters, good or evil,
who fascinate.</TE>

<LD>THE ADVENTURES OF PINOCCHIO, Story of a Puppet, By Carlo Collodi,
Translated from the Italian by Nancy Canepa , Illustrations by
Carmello Lettere, Steerforth Italia: 209 pp., $12.95</LD>
<LD>   PINOCCHIO, By Carlo Collodi, Translated from the Italian</LD>
<LD>   by M.A. Murray, Illustrated by Gris Grimley , Tor: 221 pp., $15.95</LD>
<TE>   Powerful stories are often twisted and kneaded (sometimes beyond
recognition) in various media and by new generations of artists and
writers. "Pinnochio" first came to life in the hands of Carlo Collodi
in 1881. It was serialized in a children's magazine, Il Giornale dei
Bambini, and went on to be translated into 100 languages.</TE>
<TE>   It is also in the nature of great stories that they possess a
generous capacity for interpretation; some see Pinocchio as a hero
fighting to become real in a world of stale and callous grown-ups, an
Italian Huckleberry Finn. For others, it is a morality tale: "Why It
Is Important to Be Good," "How the Good Are Tested," "What Are the
Ingredients of Goodness?" and "What Happens to Those Who Are Bad?"
These have always been the conflicting messages of children's
literature: Don't listen to the big people, they're just crazy, or if
you don't listen to the big people, you'll end up, as Collodi's blue
fairy said, "in hospital or prison."</TE>
<TE>   Nancy Canepa's is a very intimate translation, and it feels more
like literature than theater, which is important, because most of us
have seen "Pinocchio" performed; we have not read it. Hers is not a
cartoon or a simple morality tale. In the background of her world is
poverty and cruelty and violence. In a tossup between a more
sophisticated word and a more visual word, she will choose the more
complex: Tuna instead of Tunny (the fish Pinocchio meets in the belly
of the whale), "casket" instead of "stretcher," a nose that is
"purple" rather than simply "red."</TE>
<TE>   The Tor edition is more popularized, uses simpler language and
presents Pinocchio more as a naughty imp with a slight chance of
redemption than as a poor child lost in a cruel world. Carmello
Lettere's illustrations are more arty, with background and
foreground. In Gris Grimley's very imaginative, almost frightening
drawings, there is only foreground; Pinocchio has altogether less
personality in the Grimley drawings.</TE>
<TE>   Here's an example of the nuances of translation. From M.A. Murray:
"Woe to those boys who rebel against their parents, and run away
capriciously from home. ... [S]ooner or later they will repent
bitterly." From the Canepa translation: "Woe to those children who
rebel against their parents and who abandon their homes to indulge
their whims. ... [S]ooner or later they will have to face a bitter
repentance." To which Murray's Pinocchio replies: "Sing away
cricket!" Canepa's lesser rogue replies: "Go ahead and sing as you
will and wish, my dear Cricket."</TE>
<TE>   But in these new editions of this classic tale, there is little
symbolic embellishment. Every time you read this story you feel
differently about it, which is another mark of a great story. It
reflects the culture and the face of your child.</TE>

<TE>   THE CHILD THAT BOOKS BUILT: A Life in Reading, By Francis Spufford
, Metropolitan Books: 214 pp., $23</TE>
<TE>   THE BOOK THAT CHANGED MY LIFE: Interviews With National Book Award
Winners and Finalists, Edited by Diane Osen, The Modern Library: 184
pp., $12.95</TE>
<TE>   WHAT IS A BOOK? By David Kirby, University of Georgia Press: 208
pp., $19.95 paper, $44.95 hardcover</TE>
<TE>   Some writers, like Francis Spufford, admit to being addicted to
books the way some are addicted to soap operas. Many writers
interviewed by Diane Osen admit that certain books have shaped their
style. David Kirby remarks on the powerful ability of books to create
divisions in academia and among readers. Spufford, whose book is the
most personal, is awed by the amount of information a child absorbs
and by all the questions a child has about how to live that are
answered by books.</TE>
<TE>   "The association between books for children and autonomy for
children is very strong," he writes. It gives him comfort, in
adulthood, to see his own life as a story.</TE>
<TE>   Osen's interviews are a similar homage to books: Grace Paley
speaks of the "relief of fiction"; Phillip Levine tells how the poems
of Wilfred Owen helped him as a young man to feel "normal" in the
world of the 1940s. Kirby's book is full of interesting principles,
hard-earned on the front lines of academia: "Devotion is more
important than dissection" and "Practice is more important than
theory."</TE>
<TE>   Critical writing is better when it is done by a critic who is also
a writer, if only he did not refer to himself as "a professional
reader." The very idea makes Collodi turn in his grave and makes
puppets of us all.</TE>

<DH>THE HARD WAY: Stories of Danger, Survival, and the Soul of
Adventure, By Mark Jenkins, Simon &amp; Shuster: 224 pp., $22</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBIN U. RUSSIN</AU>
<BD>Robin U. Russin is the coauthor of "Screenplay: Writing
the Picture" and an assistant professor of screenwriting at UC
Riverside.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the wind-swept Wyoming countryside east of Laramie, on each side
of Interstate 80, are two remarkable phenomena. To the north is
Vedauwoo, a park of gigantic granite boulders piled into fantastic
hill formations. Native Americans long held the area sacred; its name
is Arapaho for "earthborn." Nowadays it's a magnet for picnickers and
rock climbers. A few miles south rises the Ames Monument, a 60-foot
pyramid built in 1882 to honor two brothers who helped complete the
transcontinental railroad. Set at the line's highest elevation, once
the site of a vanished rail town, it was designed by the great H.H.
Richardson, with portrait reliefs by renowned sculptor Augustus
Saint-Gaudens. It now sits eerily alone above a desolate high plain.</LD>
<LD>   These two monuments, one shaped by the elements, the other by
ambition, are appropriately in the backyard and background of Laramie
native Mark Jenkins. An accomplished mountaineer and professional
wanderer, Jenkins is also the son of a math professor and is a
student of philosophy; he prefaces his new book, "The Hard Way," with
a quote from the controversial existentialist Martin Heidegger. And
flowing just beneath the surface of Jenkins' beautifully crafted
stories one can sense Heidegger's obsession with achieving a
consciousness of self without alienation from the world.</LD>
<TE>   Heidegger thought the anxiety of facing mortal danger was
clarifying, that stripping away the inauthentic created a means to a
joyfully active life. Jenkins makes himself no stranger to peril in
his search for the authentic. He traverses the most remote and
literally forbidden parts of the globe, at the risk--and cost--of
illness, injury and frequent incarceration. But the lure is
irresistible: "Anxiety is building now. The footloose jubilation of
setting out on a new adventure masking the anguish of saying goodbye
to my wife and two daughters. This is the conundrum of my life: I do
not want to leave, but I am yearning, madly, to go. The plane is
waiting. Shoulder on the pack, kiss Sue and the girls, I'm gone."</TE>
<TE>   Jenkins' previous two books, "Off the Map" and "To Timbuktu," were
in-depth accounts of single adventures: bicycling across Siberia and
following the Niger River from its source to the ocean. Each
represented a prolonged vision-quest into deeply mysterious
territory, geographical and metaphysical. "The Hard Way" is a
selection of articles, mostly from Outside magazine, for which he is
adventure columnist. Each recounts a smaller, simpler exploit, each
providing its own more particular epiphany. But here, grouped by
theme--"Crossings," "Iconoclasts," "Mountains," "Kin"--each acquires
a deeper resonance.</TE>
<TE>   Brought to life by a poetic and muscular style, Jenkins' writing
is a brew of history, philosophy and raw emotion. His journeys are as
intellectual and spiritual as they are physical, and we are by his
side, in his head. Cresting a mountain ridge in Ethiopia: "In a
nanosecond the eyes gauge the fantastic drop, the mind imagines the
plummet to death, instinct secretes a warning into the blood and the
body recoils." Nearly freezing in Canada: "Something was happening to
us. It was what we'd come for. We were being immersed back into the
physical life. It was almost as if all the rain, the frigid river,
the wilderness itself were an acid dissolving the shell of urban
existence." Upon hearing a night chorus of nearly extinct African
wolves: "The faint call and response and refrain, like a faraway
psalmody in some ancient language, had cheered me immensely. Somehow,
through everything, they were still alive. They were out there, even
if we never saw them."</TE>
<TE>   Despite his passion for nature, at heart the book is about the
human connections he finds everywhere--partners, family, strangers he
meets along the way: "Nov. 7, somewhere in Tibet--Expected a
Wilderness. Instead, am riding through an empty landscape of people.
The mountains are incidental." Of course people, like nature, are
inextricably wonderful and terrible. An expedition through the
Dardanelles elicits a meditation on the World War I horrors of
Gallipoli. A boating trip in Louisiana provokes an indictment of a
ravaged ecology. Attacked by thieves in the Balkans: "I am not
feeling the blows not the first boot to the side of my head not the
kicks or the punches or the blood because my hands are desperately
scrambling for my knife in the blackness over the tent floor...."</TE>
<TE>   But Jenkins remains an optimist. Come what may, to travel is "to
throw yourself into the world like a boy leaps into a lake." And
homecoming, too, is sweet, although it usually involves a jaunt to
Vedauwoo to teach his girls how to climb, or to marvel at the
man-made mountain, now all but forgotten, built to celebrate a
conquered continent. In "The Hard Way," he takes us on a wild ride to
the realization that, whether sipping yak-butter tea with a Tibetan
monk high in the Himalayas, breaking into the underworld in northern
Greece or simply hitching across Colorado to see a friend, the world
outside our doors remains a constant source of surprise and awe.</TE>

<DH>TROPICAL TRUTH: A Story of Music and Revolution in Brazil,
By Caetano Veloso, Alfred A. Knopf: 354 pp., $26</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TOM SCHNABEL</AU>
<BD>Tom Schnabel produces KCRW's radio program "Cafe LA"
and is the program director of World Music at the Hollywood Bowl.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I've loved the sound of Caetano Veloso since I first heard his music
years ago. He is a rara avis, both reigning pop superstar and
intellectual. His book of memoirs, "Verdade Tropical," was published
in Brazil in 1997 and generated controversy. The book is now,
finally, translated as "Tropical Truth: A Story of Music and
Revolution in Brazil." It is a dense and challenging book, filled
with Brazilian history, politics, philosophy and sociology, focusing
on the tumultuous 1960s and '70s, an extraordinarily fertile social
and musical period in Brazil.</LD>
<LD>   Veloso was born in 1942 in the small northern town of Santo Amaro
da Purificacao, in the northern state of Bahia, which he declares "is
to Rio what the Old Testament is to the New." He was part of a large
and happy family. His father worked for the Postal and Telegraph
Service, and his mother still lives in the house on Amparo Street
where he grew up. It is a house Veloso describes as "the seat of the
most important events of my formation. It was here that I was to
discover sex, see 'La Strada,' fall in love ... and--most
important--hear Joao Gilberto."</LD>
<TE>   Veloso had an eclectic intellectual appetite; in his teens during
the 1950s, he savored whatever was new and provocative: the Italian
neo-realist cinema of Vittorio De Sica, Michaelangelo Antonioni,
Roberto Rossellini and Federico Fellini. He admired the films of
Sergei Eisenstein, Alfred Hitchcock and Jean-Luc Godard. He read
Stendhal, James Joyce, Federico Garcia Lorca, Ezra Pound and Claude
Levi-Strauss (who lived in Brazil and based "Tristes Tropiques" on
his sojourn). Veloso was fascinated by language and was captivated by
the concrete poetry of Brazilian Oswald de Andrade. He also loved the
paintings of Piet Mondrian, Roy Lichtenstein, Casimir Malevich,
Brazilian painter Mario de Andrade and, later, Andy Warhol.</TE>
<TE>   Veloso was in his teens when 1950s rock 'n' roll came to Brazil.
He didn't like Elvis Presley or Bill Haley and the Comets; he found
it all rather primitive. He especially didn't appreciate seeing
Brazilian musicians aping Elvis and the new sound from up north; he
thought they performed it without understanding it. Luckily, it was
in a rich Brazilian musical milieu that Veloso passed his teens and
early 20s.</TE>
<TE>   In 1959, Joao Gilberto made a landmark recording that became bossa
nova's launching point and a national anthem, called "Chega de
Saudade" (No More Blues). It galvanized Brazilian musicians with its
unusual rhythms, vocal phrasing and lyrics. Veloso speaks of the
classic song early in "Tropical Truth": "Even today whenever any of
us sings 'Chega de Saudade' ... bossa nova's anthem--in any stadium
in Brazil, we are accompanied by a chorus of tens of thousands of
voices of all ages singing each syllable and note of the long and
rich melody." It is difficult now to estimate the newness of its
sound; one can compare it to Charlie Parker's music or John
Coltrane's first Impulse! recordings, which, like Gilberto's song,
mesmerized a generation of musicians.</TE>
<TE>   In 1963, jazz saxophonist Stan Getz recorded the Antonio Carlos
Jobim-Vinicius de Moraes song "The Girl From Ipanema" with
Gilberto--whom Veloso deifies, calling him the "alpha and omega" and
"my supreme master." Bossa nova was born, and albums appeared from
artists like the Tamba Trio, Baden Powell, Luis Bonfa and Vinicius de
Moraes (who was vice consul at the Brazilian Consulate in Los
Angeles, which still displays his photo). And thus it was that bossa
nova, a blend of cool jazz, Claude Debussy and sophisticated but
understated Brazilian rhythms--played not infrequently by shaking
wooden match boxes and with tapping brushes on telephone
books--became not only the "in" music among jazz fans but also among
jazz musicians, particularly the lapidary gems penned by Jobim. Bossa
nova painted a pretty picture of Brazil, of beautiful girls walking
along tropical beaches, music that exuded a sunny optimism and Latin
hedonism.</TE>
<TE>   Storm clouds soon darkened the tropical skies. In early 1964, the
democratic government of Joao Goulart was overthrown by the military,
beginning two decades of dictatorship. Defying the military junta was
a rallying point for the artistic left during the second half of the
1960s. Of the two main musical movements that surfaced--Tropicalia
and Musica Popular Brasileira--the latter became the most widespread.
MPB, as it became known, urged singers and songwriters to focus on
Brazilian themes, using Brazilian musical motifs drawn from samba,
bossa nova and other regional styles. It stressed a high level of
poetry and required sophisticated musicianship, and kept its distance
from American pop, rock and the British Invasion, considering them
forms of cultural imperialism. The short-lived Tropicalia (also
called Tropicalismo, though Veloso refers the former designation) was
by far the most provocative movement. Tropicalistas followed the
youth movements in France (May 1968) and the U.S. (anti-Vietnam
protests) and proceeded to create their own musical statements
relevant to life under the dictatorship. They loved the sound of the
Beatles' "Strawberry Fields Forever" and other pop music from America
and England. Though never formalized as a written document, the
Tropicalist manifesto urged artists to make use not only of Brazilian
ingredients but also of all the arts coming into Brazil, including
'60s rock 'n' roll, surrealism, dada and concrete poetry. Together,
MPB and especially Tropicalia took the position that bossa nova songs
about girls on beaches were not only no longer appropriate but also
escapist. Tropicalistas went a step further: They wanted to defy,
protest and provoke not only the junta, its repression and ridiculous
edicts but also the complacency of music audiences and the existing
musical establishment.</TE>
<TE>   By the mid-1960s, Veloso already was a famous songwriter. He won a
prestigious and widely watched TV contest in 1966 with a song called
"Alegria, Alegria" (Happiness, Happiness), that quoted, of all
things, Sartre's "The Words." His music career was assured, and he
began making enough money to be far more comfortable than most of his
peers. Even as he recorded his first album, "Domingo," with Gal Costa
in 1967, however, he harbored the desire for a film career, an art
form that in his opinion offered maximal impact, using music,
language and image, united by the creative vision of the director.</TE>
<TE>   Ironically, it was somebody else's film that set Veloso's artistic
life on course. "Terra em Transe" (Land in Anguish), made in 1967 by
Brazilian director Glauber Rocha, depicted Brazil in ways that Veloso
had never before seen. The film electrified Brazil's avant-garde with
its harsh depiction of the country's reality, a far cry from the
simplistic, but nonetheless charming, portrayal in Marcel Camus' 1959
film, "Black Orpheus"; it crystallized everything that Veloso was
thinking about and helped establish Brazil's fledgling Cinema Novo.
"Land in Anguish" was also a crucial factor in the formation of the
Tropicalistas the next year, in 1968.</TE>
<TE>   There were only five initial recordings: by Gilberto Gil, Gal
Costa, the group Os Mutantes, the group album Tropicalia (with Rita
Lee, Tom Ze, Djalma Correia, Nara Leao, Torquato Neto, Costa and
Gil), and Veloso's first solo album. All but one were released in
1968. Together, the Tropicalistas combined electric instruments, a
psychedelic look, surrealism, existentialism, dada and "everything in
Brazil's real cultural life ... our raw material." Tropicalia was not
only a break with the bossa nova, it was also a subversive break with
the leftist student movement and with Musica Popular Brasileira. It
did, however, follow ideas put forth 40 years earlier by the
Brazilian modernist movement .</TE>
<TE>   One modernist concept Veloso and the Tropicalistas embraced was
anthropophagy, an idea first promulgated by the Brazilian artistic
vanguard in Brazil's Semana de Arte Moderna Exhibition of 1922; this
influential show marked the beginning of Brazilian modernism. Oswald
de Andrade, whose concrete poetry Veloso admired, wrote a tract
called the Manifesto Antropofagio in 1928, which borrowed from the
dadaist-surrealist manifesto published 10 years earlier in France.
Anthropophagy means cannibalism, and the allusion is to the early
Portuguese settlers' having been eaten by cannibals. It proposed that
Brazilian artists embrace omnivorous cultural borrowing, not only, as
Veloso says, the "raw materials of Brazilian life but everything else
as well," and transform these elements into a new art.</TE>
<TE>   Andrade's piece helped inspire the Tropicalistas to put everything
from sound bites and fuzzy guitars to rock rhythms into the mix,
echoing Picasso's use of newspaper clippings 50 years earlier and
foreshadowing the ubiquitous sampling used in pop music today. Though
their music was often playful, it wasn't about entertainment. Rather,
it was an expression of aesthetic revolt against the dictatorship and
complacency in general.</TE>
<TE>   Tropicalia became for Veloso and his cohorts the ideal way to use
the mass medium of music to provoke the public and defy the generals.
Eventually they roused the military's ire. Veloso's exile was
precipitated by a sign he and Gil displayed at a concert that said,
"Be a Criminal, Be a Hero." The sign caused the generals to jail
them, then exile them to England (they were "invited" to leave the
country), where they spent two years before being allowed to return
home in 1972. By then, the dictatorship had grown harsher (Veloso
noticed bumper stickers that said, "Brazil, Love It or Leave It" when
he returned in 1971 for a brief visit). But he was armed with a new
vocabulary of musical materials.</TE>
<TE>   Today, Veloso is a national icon and tastemaker, one of the few
Brazilian artists from the 1960s, besides Chico Buarque and Gilberto
Gil, who still commands the respect and devotion of the younger
generation. He also is successful outside of Brazil, winning a Grammy
in 1998 with his album "Livro," released shortly after the Brazilian
publication of this book. His voice caresses like a soft and
seductive lullaby, and his lyrics reveal subtlety, great
inventiveness and poetic finesse.</TE>
<TE>   "Tropical Truth," however, is much tougher going than his lilting
music. Partly it's that the book--a set of memoirs and reflections
rather than a chronological narrative--meanders through so many
intellectual currents that it's hard to follow. It is often insular
and opaque.</TE>
<TE>   Veloso devotes many pages to the question of Brazilian
identity--how the world sees Brazil and how Brazilians see
themselves, so reading it is much like reading a sociological
treatise. It reads better later, when Veloso recounts his experiences
being jailed and his forced exile in London; his chapter on being in
jail is especially moving. In a case of superb irony, he recounts how
his first wife, Dede, slipped him a copy of the Brazilian journal
Manchete; from his dark and stifling Rio jail cell, he beheld the
U.S. astronauts' stunning first photos of the Earth taken from the
moon. He later penned his song "Terra" (Earth), based on the
experience.</TE>
<TE>   Another problem is that we don't enter into "Tropical Truth"
equipped with much knowledge about Tropicalia, which isn't Veloso's
fault. The five albums produced by its members, including the joint
project Tropicalia, have not been issued or reissued in the U.S. in
their original form, and the available imports have no English
translations of the lyrics. The little we know is fragmentary: David
Byrne has released compilations of Os Mutantes' and Ze's work, and
groups like Sonic Youth and pop artist Beck (who would definitely
qualify as a Tropicalista) have celebrated or used similar ideas in
their songs. But this isn't enough to help us appreciate Veloso's
book.</TE>
<TE>   What is certain is that the Tropicalia movement was highly
influential on the entire next generation of Brazilian musical
artists, especially those albums coming after the fall of the
dictatorship in the mid-1980s, when censorship was finally lifted.</TE>
<TE>   One lesson of Sept. 11 is that we as Americans need to know more
about how people outside our borders feel and think. All the world
knows about Michael Jackson and Madonna, whose records are
distributed and marketed everywhere on Earth, but nobody knows much
about Buarque, Maria Bethania (Veloso's sister) or Gil. Added to this
musical globalism, there is the dearth of books about Brazilian music
for the general reader. A few stand out: For Musica Popular
Brasileira, there's Charles Perrone's excellent "Masters of
Contemporary Brazilian Song" and Chris McGowan and Riccardo
Pessanha's "The Brazilian Sound." For bossa nova, try Ruy Castro's
superb and entertaining "Bossa Nova." For the African-Brazilian
musical connection, there's Peter Fryer's interesting study "Rhythms
of Resistance."</TE>
<TE>   "Tropical Truth" offers an insider's view of an extraordinary
period, written by someone on the inside. His insights help us
understand the psyche of that vast "other," our huge South American
neighbor, and to celebrate a music that has blessed the world.</TE>

<DH>THE VANISHING VOTER: Public Involvement in an Age of
Uncertainty, By Thomas E. Patterson, Alfred A. Knopf: 256 pp., $25</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Does your vote matter? After the intensely close presidential
election of 2000, some people might be inclined to say yes. Others,
noting how the conservative majority on the Supreme Court aborted
Florida's vote-counting process, would argue otherwise.</LD>
<LD>   Does your vote matter in the presidential primaries? The candidate
who wins the wealth primary--the invisible money chase that takes
place before any voting occurs--has gone on to win his party's
nomination every year since 1984. So unless you live in Iowa or New
Hampshire, the states where the first two votes are held, your
franchise means little during the nomination process.</LD>
<LD>   Should we keep our archaic winner-take-all method of doling out
representation, which disenfranchises tens of millions of voters
consigned by gerrymandering to live in districts where their parties
can never win? Should we keep forcing voters to choose between the
lesser of two evils, or should we experiment with preference voting
and instant runoffs, which are prevalent in Ireland, France,
Australia and elsewhere overseas, and which eliminate the spoiler
problem? Why are younger, less educated and working-class people more
likely to believe that there are no significant differences between
the two major parties, and thus less reason to bother voting? Who
benefits from the system now in place, and what will it take to force
them to change it?</LD>
<TE>   Alas, Thomas E. Patterson's thought-provoking "The Vanishing
Voter" doesn't wrestle with any of these issues. Instead, he confines
himself to a much narrower question about the presidential selection
process surrounding the 2000 election: "What draws people to the
campaign and what keeps them away?"</TE>
<TE>   Patterson's research, which involved weekly polls from November
1999 through the post-election mess, confirms what we already know:
Voters are turned off by "too much money, too much theater, too much
fighting and too much deception." The process, he writes, "starts way
too early and lasts far too long ... provides too many dull stretches
and too few high points, and ... holds out opportunities that often
turn out empty."</TE>
<TE>   To fix it, Patterson calls on the parties to shorten the campaign
and give voters of every state a more meaningful vote, ideally by
holding a series of single-state primaries in the late spring and
concluding the process with a giant "Ultimate Tuesday" national
primary a month later. He also calls on the networks to increase
their prime-time coverage of the candidates and admonishes the
political press to spend less time hyping minor gaffes, the horse
race and their own pontifications. Finally, he urges elected
officials to adopt some useful reforms, like election day voter
registration (which has significantly boosted turnout in the six
states that have it, and which Californians will vote on in
November).</TE>
<TE>   Patterson's findings, however, suggest that even some
well-intentioned rejiggering of the process will not be enough to
bridge the chasm between average voters and the electoral industrial
complex.</TE>
<TE>   Consider these nuggets from his book:</TE>
<TE>   * At the start of 2000, two-thirds of the public had no idea which
candidates they supported, contrary to the drumbeat of media polls
claiming this or that candidate was the front-runner (this is because
the media polls forced people to choose between named candidates,
while Patterson's polls allowed voters to say they hadn't made a firm
choice).</TE>
<TE>   * Despite heavy news coverage, half the public didn't know that
Arizona Sen. John McCain beat George W. Bush in New Hampshire. People
were so turned off by the race that "by the first convention in 2000
... 80% had no idea it was about to begin," Patterson reports.</TE>
<TE>   * More people watched the Nixon-Kennedy debates of 1960 than
watched the Bush-Gore debates of 2000, even though there were 100
million fewer people then.</TE>
<TE>   * By election day, after more than a year of campaigning and
nearly a billion dollars spent, a majority of those surveyed by
Patterson flunked a series of 12 questions seeking to ascertain
whether they knew the candidates' positions on prime issues like gun
registration, defense spending, tax cuts, abortion, school vouchers,
prescription drug coverage, offshore oil drilling and affirmative
action.</TE>
<TE>   "The gap between the practitioner and the citizen--despite the
intimacy of television and the immediacy of polling--has arguably
never been greater," Patterson writes. "The world occupied by the
hundreds at the top and the world populated by the millions at the
bottom still overlap at points, but they do so less satisfactorily
than before. The juice has been squeezed out of elections."</TE>
<TE>   But it's not just the juice that's gone; the essence of
self-government has been eliminated. We the people don't rule
ourselves. Big campaign contributors, big-foot journalists, political
incumbents and party leaders set the terms by which the rest of us
live. And so people ask themselves why they should bother voting.
Today, thanks to the Voting Rights Act and the motor-voter law, most
of the legal barriers to individual voter participation have been
cleared away. (Though, Patterson reports, America still
disenfranchises a stunning 10% of its population, compared with just
2% in the United Kingdom, by taking away ex-felons' voting rights and
prohibiting legal aliens from voting). Education levels, another
predictor of citizen involvement, are up, and beginning with the
1960s, women have been turning out at the same pace as men.</TE>
<TE>   But despite all this, voting--the basic act of citizenship--is
slowly dying in America. Despite the closeness of the race, only 55%
of all eligible adults voted in the presidential election of 2000,
compared to 70% in 1960. In off-year elections, only about one-third
vote. Voting rates of 10% or less are commonplace in many
congressional primaries, and single-digit percentages are no longer a
rarity. Most ominous for the future are turnout rates among people
younger than 30, which barely hit 30% in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Would politics be any different if more people voted? Yes, because
the active electorate tilts toward older, wealthier and more
Republican. Patterson points out that Democrats would be in charge in
the White House and on Capitol Hill if all eligible adults voted in
2000. Of course, if politicians expected more people to vote, they
would adjust their campaigns accordingly. Still, we could expect
somewhat different policy outcomes. Patterson's Vanishing Voter
Project found that likely voters in 2000 were more inclined than
nonvoters to spend the federal budget surplus on a tax cut, debt
reduction or strengthening Social Security. Nonvoters were more
likely to want it spent on health, education and welfare.</TE>
<TE>   Patterson observes that today's minimum wage (adjusted for
inflation) is lower than it was in 1979, that median income has
stagnated and that top-dog wealth has soared. Yet these core economic
issues, which would undoubtedly motivate millions of disaffected
voters, are not pursued with any vigor by the major parties. Why?
Start with the fact that business interests give 15 times as much in
campaign contributions than labor interests. National Democrats are
more beholden to their donors than to their voters.</TE>
<TE>   Then add in the amazing lack of political competition for most
offices: Three-quarters of the U.S. House wins re-election by a
landslide, one out of seven don't even have a major party challenger,
while more than 40% of state legislative candidates run without major
opposition. Why should these political and economic interests stir up
more voter engagement when things are so cozy for them now? (To get a
better answer than Patterson supplies, turn to Frances Fox Piven and
Richard A. Cloward's invaluable "Why Americans Still Don't Vote: And
Why Politicians Want It That Way.")</TE>
<TE>   It's striking that, in a book focused on vanishing voters,
Patterson omits any consideration of Jesse Ventura's shocking win in
Minnesota, where turnout soared thanks in great part to his
working-class appeal (along with his inclusion in televised debates,
his ability to get significant public financing and election-day
voter registration). Patterson also gives scarce mention to other
outside-the-box political challenges, like Ross Perot's in 1992 and
Ralph Nader's in 2000, that demonstrably increased voter interest and
participation. He does recognize how real political competition upped
turnout during the Bush-McCain battle and in some of the Bush-Gore
battleground states in the fall. But his prescriptions fall far short
of his diagnosis.</TE>
<TE>   Democracy in America is dying because the incumbent class of both
major parties, working in tandem with each other and their funders,
consultants and a complaisant press, have figured out how to snuff
out real competition. Patterson's book suggests that, if we want to
revive it, we're going to have to create a truly level playing field
for all parties and their candidates with fair treatment by the
media, equal access to the ballot, an end to partisan gerrymandering,
public funding to free politicians from their dependence on big
money, more inclusive debates and more representative ways of
counting votes. In a word, we need to apply antitrust thinking to
electoral politics. Otherwise, the political market will stay closed,
leaving more and more voters little choice but to stay home on
election day.</TE>

<DH>NO STAR TOO BEAUTIFUL: Yiddish Stories From 1382 to the
Present, Edited and translated by Joachim Neugroschel, W.W. Norton:
710 pp., $39.95</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KENNETH TURAN</AU>
<BD>Kenneth Turan is a Times film critic and the author of
"Sundance to Sarajevo: Film Festivals and the World They Made."</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Do you have a story for me?"</LD>
<LD>   "All kinds, all kinds.... "</LD>
<LD>   These words, the closing ones in a tale by Y.L. Peretz, are the
best possible epigram for the anthology that contains them, Joachim
Neugroschel's massive "No Star Too Beautiful: Yiddish Stories From
1382 to the Present."</LD>
<TE>   A prodigious job of research and translation, this ambitious
volume contains work from writers as well known as Peretz, Sholom
Aleichem and Isaac Bashevis Singer and as obscure as the anonymous
18th century author of "The Princess and the Seven Geese."</TE>
<TE>   Even when it comes to the 20th century, Neugroschel has sought out
work from storytellers rarely if ever translated before--such as
Menakhem Kipnis, who offers an unconventional take on the legendary
fools of Khelm, and Bertha Lelchuk, author of the O. Henry-ish "The
Aunt From Norfolk," who "supposedly ended up in Hollywood in 1940,
playing bit roles under various names," Neugroschel tells us.</TE>
<TE>   Though the book has unaccountably left out such modern masters as
Chaim Grade and Joseph Opatoshu, overall it does fulfill
Neugroschel's stated aim to "show the overwhelming variety of Yiddish
fiction" and to do justice to the breadth of a language that was
vibrant enough to have 11 million speakers worldwide by 1939, before
the Holocaust and the Soviets wiped out the greater part of its
writers and readers.</TE>
<TE>   If you assume Yiddish fiction confined itself to "Fiddler on the
Roof" territory, Neugroschel has some surprises for you. A tale by
Y.Y. Trunk concerns the life of Roman philosopher Seneca, while
another, "In the Mountains" by Hersh Dovid Nomberg, turns on what is
likely the first tobogganing accident in Yiddish literature. These
stories were nothing if not ambitious, which seems to be why
Neugroschel took his title from a line from Bertolt Brecht's "Mother
Courage": "I've seen so many storm the sky. No star was far too
beautiful or far too far."</TE>
<TE>   "No Star Too Beautiful" is the first all-purpose Yiddish anthology
since 1954's classic "A Treasury of Yiddish Stories," edited by
Irving Howe and Eliezer Greenberg. That book had a more specific
scope, including fewer writers and covering a more limited time. But
while Howe and Greenberg used a variety of translators, Neugroschel
has chosen to render every story himself, an approach that, as shall
be seen, causes some difficulty.</TE>
<TE>   While Neugroschel clearly knows a great deal about his subject,
"No Star" suffers from an assumption that the readers know just as
much. Though the situation vis-a-vis Yiddish that Howe and Greenberg
described half a century ago ("It is a literature virtually unknown
to Americans") no longer exists in a post-Bashevis Singer world,
Neugroschel's introduction, as well as his author notes, are too
skimpy by half, especially when compared, for instance, to the much
more comprehensive critical apparatus of the recent "Jewish American
Literature: A Norton Anthology."</TE>
<TE>   Still, it doesn't do to be too picky about this book. If the
Talmud is famously described as a vast sea, Yiddish fiction is one as
well, and one that has been too long undiscovered and uncharted.</TE>
<TE>   Encountering the literature over a six-century reach turns out to
be revealing in unexpected ways. What's on view here is more than
just a succession of stories, it's the history of a people, a record
of what Jews were concerned about and how those things shifted and
changed. To read through "No Star" is surprisingly like observing the
life cycle of an individual, from unsophisticated beginnings to the
getting of wisdom to, in the case of Yiddish, a bleak and unfortunate
denouement.</TE>
<TE>   The first record of written Yiddish, Neugroschel tells us, are 11
words jotted in a prayer book in Worms, Germany, in 1272. The
earliest manuscripts in Yiddish appeared in 1382, and the first part
of "No Star" is devoted to the Old Yiddish period that lasted from
that year to the mid-18th century.</TE>
<TE>   "Neglected as Yiddish culture may be," Neugroschel writes, "the
Old Yiddish period is even more overlooked." It's not hard to see
why, as these mostly anonymous fairy tales and wonder stories are
frankly more fascinating to analyze for what they show about the
medieval Jewish state of mind than to actually read. Stories of pious
men having forced sex with savages indicate how much Jews felt at the
mercy of the gentile world, while a tale of the son of a rabbi who
becomes the pope without his parents knowing about it is the kind of
wish-fulfillment fantasy that only the most downtrodden engage in.</TE>
<TE>   In the 18th and 19th centuries came a series of battles for the
Jewish soul. The rise of Hasidism and its emphasis on ecstatic,
joyous worship, as opposed to the legalistic rigidity of the
established orthodoxy led ultimately to one of the great works of
Jewish literature, the mystifying, elliptical, surprisingly modern
"Tales of Rabbi Nakhman of Braslev," first published in 1815.</TE>
<TE>   The next battle pitted all forms of religion against the Haskala,
the Enlightenment and its insistence that Jews immerse themselves in
the modern, secular world. The highlight of this section is the first
work by the man considered the grandfather of modern Yiddish
literature, Mendele Moykher-Sforim. His "The Little Man" of 1864, a
biting satire about what it takes to get ahead, confirms critic
Zalman Reyzen's contention that "the first great Yiddish author ...
raised Yiddish literature from its primitive condition to a high
artistic level."</TE>
<TE>   "No Star's" fourth and final section, "Modernism: Nineteenth
Century to the Present," takes up more than half the book and has by
far the most interesting selection of stories.</TE>
<TE>   As with the rest, the writings are also valuable for getting a
sense of what life was like for Jews in that day and age, in this
case the difficulties of coping with the pains and pangs of
assimilation, with what Yankev Dinezon calls (in his 1905 "The
Crisis") "our awful situation, our poverty, our ignorance, our lack
of free choice."</TE>
<TE>   All the big names of Yiddish literature are well-represented here,
as the stories chosen demonstrate Peretz's modern sophistication,
Aleichem's gift for creating complicity, Dovid Bergelson's delicate
and melancholy lyricism and Bashevis Singer's vivid sensuality.</TE>
<TE>   The few stories Neugroschel has included on the horrors of pogroms
and the nightmare of the Holocaust--Alexander Kapel's "How Long Does
a Pogrom Last?," Lamed Shapiro's "The Cross," Rokhl Korn's "The End
of the Road" and Frume Halpern's "Dog Blood"--are among the most
savage and indelible of the anthology.</TE>
<TE>   Neugroschel does some of his better work with these stories, but
overall it seems not such a good idea to have a single voice, even
one that has previously worked on more than 180 books, translating so
many varying and idiosyncratic sensibilities.</TE>
<TE>   Especially unfortunate is Neugroschel's weakness for the
vernacular, the clunky choices he makes when it comes to translating
casual language. Phrases like "I may have been scared out of my
gourd," "C'mon in and wet your whistle," "the old geezer of a
sawbones" and "Once I get some cash, we'll party like there's no
tomorrow" reappear with numbing regularity, breaking the flow of the
stories and leaving a trail of dispiriting sameness.</TE>
<TE>   But if "No Star" has weaknesses, its strengths outweigh them, and
those include pointing the way to newly translated writers. The
anthology concludes with excerpts from two enticing novels by living
authors ("The Empire of Kalman the Cripple" by Yehuda Elberg and
"Bociany" by Chava Rosenfarb) just translated and published by
Syracuse University Press. As long as Yiddish can continue to attract
readers with works like those, its story will not be over.</TE>

<DH>IN THE HAND OF DANTE: A Novel, By Nick Tosches, Little,
Brown: 378 pp., $24.95</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEFF TURRENTINE</AU>
<BD>Jeff Turrentine is an essayist and critic whose
articles have appeared in Book Review, the New York Times Magazine,
Slate.com and other publications.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Midway along the journey of his life, Nick Tosches woke to find
himself in a dark wood, for he had wandered from the straight path.</LD>
<LD>   That straight path was a long record of obsessively researched and
rhapsodically written studies of figures from popular culture: Jerry
Lee Lewis, Dean Martin, boxer Sonny Liston and others. Tosches'
sympathy for his haunted subjects, combined with his writerly
exuberance--he sometimes seemed to be careening through his own prose
at 100 miles an hour, with only his trusty thesaurus for
ballast--made for aerobic, exhilarating reading that might best be
described as gonzo biography.</LD>
<TE>   The dark wood in which this brooding, iconoclastic son of Newark's
mean streets now finds himself is "In the Hand of Dante," a novel
that juxtaposes the tale of the Italian poet's struggle to complete
his masterwork, "The Divine Comedy," with a modern caper involving
the theft of that book's original manuscript by bloodthirsty New York
City gangsters. It's a brilliant idea, rife with all sorts of
opportunities for thematic linkage: the paralleling, for instance, of
Dante's intricately rendered blueprint of an infernal underworld with
the bada-bing version inhabited by La Cosa Nostra, or maybe an
exploration of contemporary vulgarity's connection to the vulgate in
which the poet worked. Any writer with a literary bent, a flair for
perverse comedy and an understanding of the ways of mobsters and
crooks (along with Tosches, Elmore Leonard comes to mind) could have
a blast with a milieu this promising.</TE>
<TE>   Alas, Tosches has taken this truly great idea and squandered it.
"In the Hand of Dante," to put it quite plainly, is a mess of a book.
Reviewers sometimes graciously qualify that epithet--"a
well-intentioned mess," "a beautiful mess"--but, sadly, no such
qualifiers apply here. The author's intentions are dubious, and there
is scant beauty to be found in passages that alternate between
cartoonishly gruesome violence, excruciatingly long and impenetrable
discourses on cabalistic numerology and the purple musings of Dante
Alighieri as imagined by his impassioned scholar.</TE>
<TE>   Here, sort of, is what happens. When an appropriately
Mephistophelean gangster named Joe Black learns that the original
manuscript of "The Divine Comedy" may be sitting in a wooden box just
outside Palermo, he dispatches his pathologically violent henchman,
Louie, back to the old country to retrieve it. Since neither Joe
Black nor Louie is equipped to vouch for the manuscript's
authenticity once it has been secured, they must turn to the writer
Nick Tosches, who has not only written "In the Hand of Dante" but is
one of the novel's two main characters as well.</TE>
<TE>   With Louie, Nick heads off to Italy, where, after taking part in
the manuscript's theft, he watches his new partner brutally gun down
an aging mafia don, a priest, a woman and a dog in order to leave
absolutely no witnesses. To Nick's eyes, their prize appears to be
the genuine article, though he knows that it won't be salable until
it has been authenticated by more official sources. Nick takes the
manuscript to a number of Italian archives and libraries, then on to
Chicago, where it is subjected to the most advanced and rigorous
compositional analysis in the world. (Apparently you can just call
the place and make an appointment. Who knew?) Once he's absolutely
sure that he's in possession of the real thing, he meets up with his
gangster cohorts and settles up with them in a way that will come as
a surprise only to those who have never encountered a single snippet
of "The Godfather."</TE>
<TE>   Far worse than all of the novel's senseless violence is all of the
senseless nonviolence. Even the gentlest of readers may find
themselves welcoming the arrival of chapters that track Nick's
descent into this inferno of his own making: At least they make
sense. Those passages that attempt to show Dante's inner turmoil as
he consults with an ancient Jewish sage, obsesses over the number
three and its mystical multiples, pines for his beloved Beatrice and
is eventually thrust into exile are painfully overwrought,
chockablock with laughably convoluted writing. Like this, for
instance: "That the most innocent child should be stilled and taken
to grave seemed to him empirical proving enough that the unheeding
and inviolate will of God, which we should pray only to serve, could
not be bent by even the purest, guileless, sincerest, and humilisimus
of askance for the good either of a single unborn soul or of all
mankind." That's a typical sentence. I'm not kidding.</TE>
<TE>   Tellingly, the only part of "In the Hand of Dante" that works is a
section that has no place whatsoever in the story, a lengthy
excoriation of the various editors and publishers who have wronged
Tosches over his 30-year literary career. With all the
misappropriated fervor of Lenny Bruce railing against the government
in his comedic swan song or perhaps Ezra Pound denouncing the usurers
from his asylum bed, Tosches lashes out at all of those shortsighted
souls who would dare to compromise his art by editing his vision.
This crazed digression has a vituperative intensity that gives it
real life and thus distinguishes it from any other part of the book.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe Nick Tosches' editor, fearing such blistering censure,
simply decided that the lightest of touches was called for when
marking up the proofs of "In the Hand of Dante." It's anybody's guess
why this novel is the mess that it is, instead of the triumph that it
could and should have been. It's not because Tosches is a bad writer;
he's actually a good one, even a very good one, when he exercises
some self-control. No one was asking him to compose "In the Hand of
Dante" in terza rima, or anything like that. But readers do have the
right to ask authors to try harder than this.</TE>

<HD>It's No Mystery: France Does It Better</HD>
<DH>Psychological thrillers are the province of the French.
Their ambiguity gets lost in the American translations.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANDRE CHAUTARD</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Like a stiff cognac or a soft camembert, the psychological thriller
has long been a specialty of the French. This year alone has brought
the almost unanimously well-reviewed films "Read My Lips," "Merci
Pour Le Chocolat" and "Murderous Maids." They come on the heels of
last year's suspenseful art-house hit "With a Friend Like Harry."</LD>
<LD>   The latest acclaimed thriller to make it to U.S. screens is Claude
Miller's "Alias Betty," in which a bereaved mother finds a
replacement for her deceased child in a boy who's been kidnapped from
an abusive mother. The film opened in Los Angeles on Friday.
Meanwhile, plans have been announced to make English-language
versions of "With a Friend Like Harry" (with Wes Craven attached) and
the 1996 thriller "L'Appartement" (to star Josh Hartnett and be
retitled "Wicker Park"). And current festival favorite "The Good
Thief," starring Nick Nolte and directed by Neil Jordan, is based on
Jean-Pierre Melville's 1955 film "Bob le Flambeur;" the film will be
released by Fox Searchlight early next year.</LD>
<LD>   Why are the French so accomplished in this genre? Is there a
certain kinship French filmmakers (and audiences) feel for the
thriller? One reason may be more prosaic: money.</LD>
<TE>   "We feel like we will never have the big budgets Hollywood has,"
says Remi Fournier Lanzoni, assistant professor of French and Italian
at Elon University in North Carolina and author of the forthcoming
book "French Cinema: From Its Beginnings to the Present." Because
psychological thrillers can be made on smaller budgets, it's a genre
in which the French can compete with Americans and one that travels
well across different cultures, he says.</TE>
<TE>   For his part, Miller says he is attracted to the genre because of
the extreme, passionate emotions stirred in the characters. "The
genre is based on the feeling of guilt linked to crimes and murders,
and that starts a chain of events that are based on vengeance and
fatality and destiny that are absolutely fascinating. It's similar to
what happens in ancient tragedy."</TE>
<TE>   Director Claude Chabrol noted in the press notes for his film
"Merci Pour Le Chocolat," "For a long time now, from Fritz Lang to
Alfred Hitchcock, this genre is the best popular vehicle for
[exploring] any abstract subject."</TE>
<TE>   Two other well-received French films released this year, "Time
Out" and "How I Killed My Father," stretch the boundaries of the
genre---they are less thrillers than contemplative dramas in which
crimes are committed.</TE>
<TE>   "The French have always been more on the cutting edge of
psychological conflict, of unusual sexual behavior," says influential
American film critic Andrew Sarris, noting that they "have always had
an interest in bizarre social arrangements."</TE>
<TE>   "French thrillers tend to offer more than a mechanical intrigue,"
Lanzoni says. The filmmakers use a popular, "established genre to
engage in deeper reflections on morality, on ethics, on human
nature."</TE>
<TE>   These films are also more willing than Hollywood thrillers to end
on an ambiguous note. "Merci Pour Le Chocolat," in which Isabelle
Huppert plays a wealthy matron who may be poisoning her family
members, culminates in a "peculiar fatalism," Sarris observes.</TE>
<TE>   "Not everything needs to be tied up, not everything needs to be
resolved, not everything needs to be explained," Lanzoni says. "The
sense is we're living in a world where morality isn't clear-cut."</TE>
<TE>   The French, in fact, seem to have a higher artistic regard for the
thriller genre. "There is a strong tradition of crime thriller
fiction and film in France," says Dana Polan, professor of critical
studies at the USC School of Cinema-Television.</TE>
<TE>   Such authors as Patricia Highsmith and Chester Himes have remained
consistently in print there, while they have been less appreciated in
the United States or seen as lesser literary figures, Polan notes.</TE>
<TE>   In making "Alias Betty," Miller adapted the novel "Tree of Hands"
by noted British mystery author Ruth Rendell, whose work he was
introduced to after seeing Chabrol's 1995 "La Ceremonie," also
adapted from a Rendell novel. For "Merci Pour le Chocolat," Chabrol
found a book by the more obscure American author Charlotte Armstrong,
"The Chocolate Cobweb," which he adapted with his "La Ceremonie"
co-writer, Caroline Eliacheff, a child psychologist.</TE>
<TE>   Early on, French critics wrote about the existential themes in
American hard-boiled fiction, and they were the among the first to
consider Hitchcock as a masterful artist. The films of the French New
Wave in the 1960s were heavily influenced by the American film noir
of decades prior, which in turn was influenced by the French "poetic
realist" films of the 1930s.</TE>
<TE>   "When those American films came to France, they had so much
[impact] that they influenced a whole generation of directors,"
Lanzoni says, "and from that generation it just never stopped."</TE>
<TE>   Filmmakers like Henri-Georges Clouzot and Rene Clement followed in
the Hitchcock mold in making films like, respectively, 1955's "Les
Diaboliques" (remade here as "Diabolique" in 1996) and 1960's "Purple
Noon" (remade as "The Talented Mr. Ripley" in 1999, based on the
Highsmith crime series).</TE>
<TE>   "There's been a constant interaction between Hollywood and
France," Lanzoni says. "It's a French cinema that's reacting to and
trying to find the best in American popular culture."</TE>
<TE>   "Once upon a time, we used to make great thrillers ourselves,"
Sarris says. "We don't lead the way so much [anymore], at least the
mainstream doesn't."</TE>
<TE>   When Hollywood tries to remake the French thrillers, however, the
new versions usually suffer by comparison. This summer's "Unfaithful"
was a reworking of Chabrol's 1969 "La Femme Infidele," and 2000's
"Under Suspicion," with Gene Hackman and Morgan Freeman, was a remake
of Miller's 1981 "Garde a Vue."</TE>
<TE>   Most critics agreed that the originals were more psychologically
nuanced than the new versions.</TE>
<TE>   Miller says that though he's happy the remake kept the themes of
morality from the original, he notes that they aged the little girl
victim in the original to a 12-year-old. "I think it was fear.
Hollywood was not daring enough," he says.</TE>
<TE>   The studio impulse is usually to smooth down the edges. "A lot of
big stars here will not play certain roles that are completely
unsympathetic," and that limits the range of behavior Hollywood films
can explore, Sarris says.</TE>
<TE>   Polan adds, "A friend of mine said one of the ironies is Hollywood
will always go to a foreign culture, incorporate it, and then
specifically eliminate the thing you would have thought they went to
the foreign culture for. So basically [they're] taking out of these
films everything that made them interesting as ambiguous thrillers."</TE>
<TE>   A steady stream of new French psychological thrillers will be
flowing stateside next year.</TE>
<TE>   Coline Serrau's "Chaos" is scheduled to open in January, and "He
Loves Me, He Loves Me Not," a romantic comedy spin on the genre
starring "Amelie's" Audrey Tautou, is slated for February.</TE>
<TE>   Patrice Leconte's "L'Homme du Train" (The Man on the Train), about
two strangers who decide to swap identities after meeting on a train,
will also open next year, and the controversial Cannes entry
"Irreversible," with Monica Belluci and "Read My Lips' " Vincent
Cassel, arrives in March.</TE>
<TE>   After somewhat of a migration to television in the past two
decades, "there seems to be a comeback of this [thriller] genre in
recent years in France in terms of popularity with the movie
audience," Miller says.</TE>

<HD>The Wolves at Bay</HD>
<DH>Two decades after the landmark Kevin Costner film, Native
American actors have a watershed moment</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SCARLET CHENG</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>They are the first Americans, but in films they have often been the
last. In traditional movie westerns, they served as all-purpose
villains, swooping down with bloodcurdling war cries upon hapless
white settlers, scalping men, kidnapping women and children, stealing
horses.</LD>
<LD>   "The only good Injun is a dead Injun," was a familiar line. The
irony was that often the Injuns were played by non-Injuns.</LD>
<LD>   Then came the late '60s, when America became sensitized to
cultural imperialism and racial stereotyping. Soon films such as
"Soldier Blue" (1970), "Little Big Man" (1970) and "Billy Jack"
(1971) indicted white society for its prejudice and brutality against
Native Americans.</LD>
<TE>   Twenty years later, the Oscar-winning "Dances With Wolves" (1990)
proved a landmark in theme and casting. Though the movie starred a
white hero (played by Kevin Costner, who also directed), it was
deeply sympathetic to the plight of the Lakota Sioux and made a point
to seek Native American actors for the many Native American roles.
While this may seem standard procedure today, Graham Greene, who won
an Academy Award nomination for his portrayal of Kicking Bird in the
film, says, "There weren't that many native actors back then. I
myself drifted into acting slowly."</TE>
<TE>   "It was a major step forward in casting native actors," says Rene
Haynes, who found the extras for "Dances" and is now an L.A.-based
casting director widely known for her focus on Native American
actors.</TE>
<TE>   This may be another watershed time in that history. Several recent
or upcoming theatrical releases and a television movie feature new
discoveries among Native American actors, as well as showcase
veterans. "Windtalkers," which opened in June, was based on the true
story of Navajo soldiers whose native language provided an
unbreakable code for use in the Pacific theater during World War II.
Director John Woo cast actors Adam Beach and Roger Willie in key
roles, although the movie still relied on a white lead (Nicolas Cage)
for star appeal. Next come two grittier features created by native
talent about contemporary native life in the U.S., Chris Eyre's
"Skins" (which is scheduled to open next month) and Sherman Alexie's
"The Business of Fancydancing" (scheduled for release in Los Angeles
on Oct. 25), as well as the PBS "Mystery!" special "Skinwalkers"
(also directed by Eyre), based on a Tony Hillerman novel. Taking
place largely on today's Indian reservations, the projects have casts
that are mostly Indian.</TE>
<TE>   Also, scheduled for release later this year is Spike Jonze's
"Adaptation," which includes pivotal Indian characters, while Kate
Montgomery's "Christmas in the Clouds," featuring a Native American
cast in a romantic comedy is seeking a distributor.</TE>
<TE>   For some it is high time there were more films about contemporary
Native American life, rather than those that regurgitate the romance
of the noble savage, usually by white filmmakers. For actors, it's a
chance to move beyond the grunt and sink their teeth into far meatier
stuff.</TE>
<TE>   "Nine times out of 10 in these period pieces there wasn't much
acting involved," says Eric Schweig, who co-stars with Greene in
"Skins." "There were a lot of monosyllabic dialogue, a nod here and
there--that's all they wanted. You can't do much acting when you're
just grunting."</TE>
<TE>   While "Dances With Wolves" moved beyond grunting, it still lacked
the right point of view, according to native filmmaker Eyre. His
directorial debut "Smoke Signals" (1998) was the first feature by a
native director to gain national theatrical release. " 'Dances With
Wolves' served a great purpose--it was a beautiful movie, but it was
not an Indian movie," he says.</TE>
<TE>   And what was that purpose? "It galvanized Indian men and women to
want to take acting on as a craft."</TE>
<TE>   Exact head counts are hard to come by, but there is consensus that
more native acting talent is available than ever before. Casting
directors may still find this area a challenge, but it just means
they have to stretch and go beyond the usual talent pools in Los
Angeles and New York.</TE>
<TE>   Take "Windtalkers," for example. From the beginning the producers
sought the support of the Navajo Nation, which, says co-producer
Terence Chang, had felt burned by past movie portrayals. "You know,
like all those films where Lou Diamond Phillips played Indians," he
says. Although only one-eighth Cheyenne, Phillips has played a string
of Indian characters in such films as "Shadow of the Wolf" (1992) and
"Sioux City" (1994).</TE>
<TE>   At first the tribe insisted on Navajo actors for the Navajo parts
in "Windtalkers," then eventually agreed that at least "they should
be 100% Native Americans," Chang recalls. In addition to a six-month
search through the usual channels, casting director Mindy Marin set
up open casting calls in six cities in Arizona, Colorado and New
Mexico. Five hundred people responded.</TE>
<TE>   In a Cinderella twist, Roger Willie, an artist who showed up at
one casting session to chaperon two hopeful nephews, was noticed by
Marin and asked to audition. They ended up sending him and two other
nominees to Los Angeles, and after a week with an acting coach,
Willie was selected for the part of Charlie Whitehorse.</TE>
<TE>   "Whenever we see American Indians in big Hollywood movies, we
never know what they're thinking, we never know how they
feel--they've only got one expression, pretty wooden," director John
Woo says. "Roger was really natural, I liked his charm and his
realism."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, they couldn't find a Navajo suitable for the Ben Yahzee
role, so they went with Adam Beach, a Saulteaux native from Canada.
They had liked him from "Smoke Signals," Chang says, and felt that
"Adam was the best actor for the job."</TE>
<TE>   "Smoke Signals" set a benchmark for Native American actors. It
debuted auspiciously at the Sundance Film Festival in 1998, winning
the Audience Award and the Filmmaker's Trophy. The story of two
friends, stoic Victor Joseph (Beach) and chatty Thomas (Evan Adams),
who try to reconcile the past to the present, it touched on the
pervasive reservation problems of alcoholism and broken families,
while maintaining a voice of dry humor.</TE>
<TE>   The success of the film has proved a jumping board for writer
Sherman Alexie, who has gone on to direct his own film, "The Business
of Fancydancing," actors Beach ("Windtalkers," "Skinwalkers") and
Adams ("The Business of Fancydancing") and, of course, director Eyre.</TE>
<TE>   For Eyre, the characterization of the native roles was key. "I
believe it is a landmark movie in that it revolves around the
humanity of the characters and not the romance of the loincloth," he
says. "I know for a fact that Native American actors want to stretch.
They want to play characters that are people, people that exist in
the gray area. They want to be challenged by human complexity. Those
movies before 'Smoke Signals' were about using Indian actors as
vehicles for some non-Indian writer's liberal political message.
They're history lessons in guilt, and I'm not into that. I'm into
examining my characters and their story."</TE>
<TE>   In his new film "Skins," two adult brothers live in uneasy
proximity on the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in South Dakota. Rudy
(Schweig) is a local cop turned vigilante by all the trouble he has
seen; Mogie (Greene) is a down-and-out alcoholic who, despite his
joking, is on a downward spiral no one can stop, not even his
well-meaning teenage son (newcomer Noah Watts).</TE>
<TE>   For "Skins," casting director Haynes saw actors from L.A., New
York and Canada, in person and on tape, then took the extra step to
go to South Dakota. There she set up workshops in schools on the Pine
Ridge and Rosebud reservations to find potential 10-year-olds to play
Mogie and Rudy as boys.</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, casting the two adult leads was easy. Eyre
contacted his friend Eric Schweig for Rudy, and after reading the
script, he threw his name into the hat. "Eric's a very focused,
intense individual," the director says. "He says very little on
screen, but he's powerful." Eyre and producer Jon Kilik agreed that
Graham Greene would make an ideal Mogie "for the depth that he had,"
Eyre says. Greene agreed after some hesitancy. "The role was so
dark," explains the actor, who decided to lighten things up by
inserting his own jokey ad-libs during shooting.</TE>
<TE>   These days it is de rigueur to seek Native Americans for native
parts, even non-headlining ones. For "Adaptation," which includes
Seminole Indian parts, casting director Kim Davis-Wagner says that
she and her colleague Justine Baddeley "cast a very wide net; we even
auditioned in Canada." They finally chose L.A.-based Jay Tavare for a
supporting role opposite Meryl Streep.</TE>
<TE>   For Sherman Alexie, "the tricky part was not the lack of great
actors, but we couldn't afford them." He adds: "Certainly in Canada
there are dozens and dozens of seriously trained actors." Indeed,
Canada has been the training ground for many native film actors
today--Beach, Greene and Gary Farmer, for example.</TE>
<TE>   To keep under the $1-million budget, "The Business of
Fancydancing" was shot on digital and includes native actors from
both sides of the border.</TE>
<TE>   The protagonist is Seymour Polatkin (Adams), a successful poet
who, after a long absence, returns to his Spokane reservation for a
funeral, and faces the jealousy and resentment of those left behind.
In flashbacks, we see Seymour and pal Aristotle (Gene Tagaban) look
forward to college in Seattle, then their explosive rift when
Aristotle decides to head back to the reservation and thinks Seymour
should go too. As an adult, Seymour has created another life, that of
a man on the literary circuit, that of a gay man.</TE>
<TE>   "Ideally you would love to cast people within your tribe to play
your tribe," says Alexie, but he says that it's not always possible.
Many extras in his film are Spokane Indian, but while Adams is from
the Northwest coast, Tagaban is a mixture of Tlingit, Cherokee and
Filipino and doesn't look particularly Spokane, Alexie says.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't draw lines about blood content--[whether a person is] a
quarter, a half, a full blood," Haynes says. "I don't draw lines
about what tribe actors are because that would be too limiting to my
options." In the end, the choice was "always for the best actors for
the role."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, native actors are keenly aware of the limited roles
offered them--in number and in type--and most are delighted when they
have a chance to break out of the box.</TE>
<TE>   Recently, Schweig and Greene were happy to take on roles that were
not the usual for them. Schweig mentions a part as a gay man in the
upcoming "Mister Barrington," in which there is only a passing
reference to his Indian background. Greene, who finds himself swamped
with acting offers, especially relishes a comic part he had in
"Christmas in the Clouds," a romantic comedy set in a ski resort run
by a native tribe in Utah. He plays a vegetarian chef who tries to
convert all his diners. "I like being funny," he says.</TE>
<TE>   So far, "Christmas," unveiled at Sundance in 2001, has been
hitting a block in terms of distribution. Writer-director Kate
Montgomery set out to make a film about contemporary Indian life that
would be funny, upbeat, even heartwarming. "There's no self-pity in
this script, it's all positive without being schmaltzy," she says. "I
chose to really celebrate the humor and poke fun at the stereotypes."</TE>
<TE>   Sheila Tousey, a veteran actress of stage and screen and
co-producer of the film, has a key part as Mary, the resort's
overeager marketing director, sporting giant glasses and a beehive
hairdo. And if good native roles are hard to come by, good native
roles for women are even harder, Tousey says.</TE>
<TE>   In 1996 the actress had the lead in an HBO special, "Grand
Avenue," and its success prompted her to move to Los Angeles to be
closer, she thought, to work. Instead, she says, "I found it much
more difficult. In New York, casting directors go to plays and
actually see you. In L.A., they look at photos and demo tapes. It was
more difficult to get parts here; the funny thing is that I would get
offers through New York for parts here!"</TE>
<TE>   On stage, she says, "I've played everything under the sun." But in
films she's faced heavy-duty typecasting. Interestingly, as a result
of her strong performance in "Grand Avenue" as an alcoholic Native
American, "I was offered roles for any kind of drunk woman."</TE>
<TE>   "I'm quite choosy about the native parts I pick," she says.
"Hollywood expects leather and feathers or some serious drama that
usually involves dysfunctional behavior." Thus, "Christmas" proved a
welcome relief. "It was really refreshing to play something fun and
light," she says. "It's exciting to do something that hasn't been
seen before."</TE>

<DH>The only Siqueiros mural left intact in L.A. completes a
four-year trek to a Santa Barbara museum</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>When Mexican muralist and Communist agitator David Alfaro Siqueiros
came to Los Angeles in 1932, he was a man on a mission. His goal in
L.A., he wrote in his notebook, was to create "the great uncovered
mural painting in the free air, facing the sun, facing the rain, for
the masses."</LD>
<LD>   It is no small irony that of the three murals Siqueiros painted
during his eight-month stay here, only "Delivery of the Mexican
Bourgeoisie Born of the Revolution in the Hands of Imperialism"
(a.k.a. "Portrait of Mexico Today, 1932") survives intact--precisely
because it was the only one never to have faced the sun, the rain or
the masses.</LD>
<LD>   Now the masses are about to get their chance. After 70 years
sequestered on private property, "Mexico Today" will meet the people
at the Santa Barbara Museum of Art, not as an open-air revolutionary
salvo, but as a precious masterwork that has taken nearly four years
and a million dollars to acquire, transport, restore and display.</LD>
<TE>   "I think if Siqueiros were alive, he'd be amused at the irony of
this work's survival and pleased that he has a public legacy," says
Santa Barbara Museum of Art curator Diana du Pont, who oversaw the
Siqueiros project.</TE>
<TE>   However, Du Pont adds, "it is one thing to acquire a work like
this, and another to move it. It was worth bringing the best talent
in the world together to see if we could do it, rather than say it's
too difficult, and just walk away."</TE>
<TE>   The great mural move got its start in early 1998, shortly after
the Santa Barbara Museum of Art's well-received exhibition "Portrait
of a Decade: David Alfaro Siqueiros, 1930-1940." Du Pont, who had
brought that exhibition to the museum, got a phone call inviting her
to take a look at a Siqueiros mural in the courtyard of a private
residence in the Pacific Palisades. The owners, she was told, might
be interested in donating the mural, if the museum would take the
responsibility for getting it off the property.</TE>
<TE>   "It was like a dream," says Du Pont, who knew of the mural's
existence but had never seen it. "You walk through the front gate,
the main house is below, and to the right, connected to the front
gate, is a garden portico where Siqueiros painted the mural."</TE>
<TE>   Thirty-two feet long and 8 feet high, the brightly painted
depiction of corrupt leaders and noble peasants wrapped around the
interior walls of a semi-enclosed patio, topped by a weathered shake
roof and complete with a brick floor dotted with splatterings from
Siqueiros' brush.</TE>
<TE>   "The folklore is, Siqueiros stood and framed the mural from the
living room," Du Pont says. "It was part of the ambience of the home.
You would see it coming out the front door."</TE>
<TE>   With the blessing of the museum's director, Robert Frankel, Du
Pont dispatched a team of conservators, contractors and scholars to
the Pacific Palisades house. Could the mural be safely moved? How
much would it cost? Where would they put it? Was it worth it? It took
2 1/2 years of brainstorming and discovery before they were ready to
take action.</TE>
<TE>   "The due diligence was phenomenal," she says.</TE>
<TE>   To Du Pont's eye, the mural had made it to the end of the century
in pristine condition. But under the microscopic scrutiny of the
conservators, it suddenly seemed in imminent peril. The old roof was
in danger of breaking loose and swinging into the face of the mural.
Moisture from landscaping was seeping in from the outside wall. The
front gate was sending vibrations through the approximately
260-square-foot structure. And if that weren't enough, in places, the
painted surface was separating from the wall, and in some spots the
paint was "dusting."</TE>
<TE>   "The original paint was there," says Perry Huston, former chief
conservator at the Amon Carter Museum and Santa Barbara's lead
consultant on the mural project. "But the medium had gone, so it was
just like chalk."</TE>
<TE>   Moving so large a work of art presented even bigger problems.
First, the team considered a common technique: stripping the paint
layer off the wall and attaching it to another backing. "It would be
the same paint that Siqueiros used," said Scott Haskins, an
Italian-trained fresco specialist and principal of the Fine Arts
Conservation Laboratory in Santa Barbara, "but it would destroy the
mural."</TE>
<TE>   The next choice was a method that went back to the 16th century,
when writer-artist Giorgio Vasari used it to move a fresco out of the
church of Santa Croce in Florence. Vasari cut through the wall
surrounding the fresco, explains another team member, Andrea Rothe,
senior conservator for special projects at the Getty, "put a wooden
frame around it and pulled the whole thing out."</TE>
<TE>   For the Palisades mural, the Vasari method meant cutting the patio
enclosure into two or three pieces. "At the other end you put it back
together," Huston explains.</TE>
<TE>   But the Santa Barbara Museum decided it wanted something more.
"They were interested in preserving a piece of history with the very
best integrity possible," says Haskins--which is to say, keeping the
entire structure intact: roof, bricks, walls and mural, and
displaying it as much as possible as it existed in situ.</TE>
<TE>   The team thought it could be done. "I'd cut foundations off and
done all sorts of weird retrofits," says John Sullivan, a Santa
Barbara contractor who was brought in to assess the heavy lifting,
with engineer Gregory Van Sande. "I viewed the move as if it were a
little earthquake."</TE>
<TE>   The final plan called for stabilizing the mural's fragile painted
surface, slipping a new steel foundation under the old walls, sawing
the structure free, encasing it, lifting it onto a truck, driving it
north and setting it down in front of the museum. All without
cracking the walls or losing a flake of paint.</TE>
<TE>   Du Pont and Frankel took the plan to the Santa Barbara museum
trustees. According to Mercedes Eichholz, the board president, they
raised $1 million to cover the budget for the project.</TE>
<TE>   "The board had the vision to say go for it," Du Pont says, and the
mural's owners, Robert and Justine Bloomingdale, turned the mural
over to the museum as an anonymous gift.</TE>
<TE>   In terms of time, resources and expertise, it would be the most
ambitious acquisition in the museum's history.</TE>
<TE>   These days, Mexico claims David Alfaro Siqueiros as one of its
preeminent 20th century artists. But in 1932, he came to L.A. as
persona non grata in his home country.</TE>
<TE>   Two years earlier, his participation in a May Day rally had landed
him in house arrest in Taxco. While there, he exhibited paintings of
suffering peasants that did nothing to improve his legal situation.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S., however, already under the spell of Mexican muralists
Diego Rivera and Jose Clemente Orozco--with Siqueiros, they would
become known as the Big Three of Mexican art--was ready to welcome
him with open arms. At first.</TE>
<TE>   An invitation to teach at Chouinard Art School in Pasadena
provided Siqueiros' ticket out of Mexico. With his students, he
created "Street Meeting" on an exterior wall. When the composition
was nearly complete, Siqueiros sent the students home. He stayed up
all night to complete the central figure. At the mural's unveiling,
Siqueiros surprised and offended his politically conservative patrons
with what he described as a "red-shirted orator" rallying  "a hungry
people."</TE>
<TE>   Though there is no clear consensus as to whether the mural was
deliberately destroyed or whether it vanished under the elements,
within a year it would be gone.</TE>
<TE>   Next, Siqueiros was commissioned to paint a mural on Olvera
Street, in downtown L.A. By then, he was experimenting with
quick-drying cement, industrial paints and an airbrush. The
commission had asked for a rendition of a cheerful tropical paradise.
Instead, he painted a pyramid, a jungle and indigenous Mexican
symbols surrounding a crucified Indian hanging beneath the talons of
an American eagle. In the upper right corner, a Mexican revolutionary
and a Red Guard stood ready for revenge.</TE>
<TE>   Again, the negative reaction was noisy. The mural was whitewashed,
and over time, it has wasted away in the elements. (See sidebar.)</TE>
<TE>   Siqueiros' final L.A. mural had to please only one man: Dudley
Murphy, the director of "Emperor Jones," collaborator with Man Ray
and Ferdinand Leger on "Ballet Mechanique," and owner of a
Spanish-style home in Pacific Palisades.</TE>
<TE>   "Siqueiros and I became great friends," Murphy would write in an
unpublished memoir, "and to help him out, I put all my furniture from
my house in the garden and held a three-day exhibition of Siqueiros'
paintings in my house.... Siqueiros sold about 10 of his paintings.
Charles Laughton bought two.... Josef Von Sternberg bought one. In
gratitude, Siqueiros offered to do a mural for me on the wall of the
enclosed patio."</TE>
<TE>   Murphy also got a long-term house guest--Siqueiros, lying low
because his visa had run out, moved in and began painting. On the
patio's long back wall, he put two mournful women and a naked child
on the steps of another pyramid. Nearby sits Plutarco Elias Calles,
president of Mexico from 1924 to 1928. He had come to power as a
Communist and the artist dresses him as a revolutionary, but his red
mask is falling off, and money bags lie at his feet.</TE>
<TE>   On the patio sidewalls, two murdered peasants are wrapped in red
and blue serapes, and a soldier of the Red Army arrives to aid the
cause. The front of the patio is mostly open, with two short walls at
either end. Siqueiros painted one a warm amber, and on the other,
across from Calles, he "hung" a gold-framed picture of American
financier J.P. Morgan.</TE>
<TE>   "Morgan played an ugly role in subverting the oil industry in
Mexico," says Shifra Goldman, a Los Angeles-based art historian who
has written extensively on Siqueiros. "Morgan is the person who gave
the gold to Calles."</TE>
<TE>   Unlike Siqueiros' other patrons, Murphy cherished his mural. When
he sold the house in 1946 to Minna and Willard Coe (ironically, Coe
was a nephew of Morgan), they threatened to paint it out. "I had told
him what a tragedy it would be," Murphy recalled. "But it wasn't
until [Carlos] Chavez, the famous Mexican conductor, raved about the
mural ... that they decided not only to preserve it, but to install
special lighting and use it as a background for their entertaining."</TE>
<TE>   The Bloomingdales, who declined to be interviewed for this story,
acquired the house and the mural in 1986.</TE>
<TE>   "Each successive year the reputation of Siqueiros and the
importance of the work was gaining," says Du Pont, speaking for the
couple. "They had a feeling of what is this doing here? It was not
created for a public forum, but it belongs there now."</TE>
<TE>   In 1991, the Bloomingdales offered the mural at
auction--Christie's valued it at between $1.5 million and $2
million--with the stipulation that the buyer would be responsible for
its removal. There were no takers. Seven years later came the call to
the Santa Barbara Museum.</TE>
<TE>   "The task of moving it was so great," says Du Pont, "that only a
museum or an institution could do that."</TE>
<TE>   It was July 2001 when Huston, Sullivan and the others arrived in
Pacific Palisades to begin the move. Huston started by photographing
the mural inch by inch. He gently brushed the dirt off its surface
and, where there was dusting, applied medium to stabilize the color.</TE>
<TE>   Then the conservators systematically tapped the surface, listening
for hollows where the paintmight have separated from the wall
beneath. Using a veterinary syringe, Haskins injected an adhesive
behind the most precarious sections.</TE>
<TE>   Solvents, to remove more dirt, came next, a step made more complex
because Siqueiros had experimented with different kinds of paints.
Mostly, though, he "used a synthetic resin-based paint onto Portland
cement, thinking that if he applied it wet it might sink in better,"
Haskins says. "What happened is closer to getting oil and water to
mix. He's lucky he got it to stick at all."</TE>
<TE>   Keeping it stuck during the move was the conservators' biggest
challenge--and, like Siqueiros, they decided to experiment.</TE>
<TE>   In 1995, German conservators had developed a paraffin-like
substance called cyclododecane. "This is one of the most remarkable
materials in modern time," says the Getty's Rothe. Used on fragile
surfaces, cyclododecane protects paint. Because it melts at low heat,
it can be applied without exposing the artwork to radical changes in
temperature. And it possesses one spectacular characteristic: It
evaporates when exposed to air, leaving no residue.</TE>
<TE>   "For the Siqueiros mural we used the cyclododecane in a molten
state, applying a thin layer with a brush," says Gary McGowan, a New
Jersey conservator imported for his cyclododecane expertise. "Then we
applied a layer of gauze and layered up the cyclododecane. The gauze
binds the wax layers together like a rigid surface, like a cast."
When the cyclododecane "sublimates," the gauze falls away.</TE>
<TE>   Until McGowan got his hands on the material, it was mostly used in
small doses. He became its first industrial-sized user, protecting
carvings made by slaves in the foundation of a church on the
Underground Railroad. The application on "Mexico Today" expanded that
usage six-fold.</TE>
<TE>   Next, the coated surface was covered with sheets of plastic and
plywood lined with foam. Then it was Sullivan's turn. His crew pulled
off the patio roof (a replica would be made later), and removed the
floor brick by brick, mapping and marking all the pieces. They
wrapped a fiberglass skin around the outside of the structure for
added strength and temporarily filled in the front gap to keep the
walls from wracking.</TE>
<TE>   The most dangerous moment came next. The crew dug a 4-foot trench
around the patio, cored holes through the original foundation and
inserted a cross-hatching of I-beams to support the walls. Then they
cut below the beams, while Rothe, anxious about vibration, held his
hand on the protected surface of the mural. To his amazement, the
saws generated less vibration than the front gate.</TE>
<TE>   On Oct. 10, 2001, the protected structure was strapped into a
harness and hooked to a crane. "I was double-checking and
triple-checking everything," Sullivan says. "I kept thinking, 'I know
we cut the whole thing off--but maybe we didn't.' It really choked me
up; I was very embarrassed. The guys were laughing at me."</TE>
<TE>   His fears were well placed. The package weighed about 51,000
pounds, Van Sande says. "Any torquing could have destroyed the mural.
Old plaster is very brittle."</TE>
<TE>   The crane lifted its load over the front of the Palisades property
and onto a 40-foot-long flatbed truck. Chained and bolted in place,
it was driven up Highway 101 and stored overnight in Santa Barbara
under police guard.</TE>
<TE>   Before sunrise a small, coffee-cup-wielding crowd of museum
staffers, trustees, Justine Bloomingdale and the mayor of Santa
Barbara congregated on State Street. At dawn a crane drove into
place. A few minutes later, a man on a bicycle launched into "Here
Comes the Bride," as the delivery truck arrived.</TE>
<TE>   The crowd, hands on heads, mouths open, watched while the mural
floated over the tops of trees, executed a delicate 180-degree
pirouette and hovered a few inches above its new foundation near the
museum's main entrance.</TE>
<TE>   After it was secured, Frankel and Huston pried off a section of
plywood and scraped off a thumbnail sized bit of gauze and goo. So
far, so good.</TE>
<TE>   The Santa Barbara Museum of Art had planned to unveil "Mexico
Today" in June, but by March, it was clear it wouldn't be ready--a
cool winter had delayed the sublimation of the cyclododecane and the
outlines of the mural were just starting to ghost through the milky
surface.</TE>
<TE>   Already, the brick floor had been puzzled back together and a
replica of the original roof topped the old patio enclosure. The
exterior walls were stuccoed over the fiberglass sheath and painted.</TE>
<TE>   Then, a warm April accelerated the sublimation and, in May, the
conservation team reconvened. Again, they went over the mural with a
fine-tooth comb. The verdict? Pure glee. Even Huston, characterized
by one of his colleagues as "Mr. Please" for his polite persistence
and preternatural precaution, was excited. The mural looked right,
and according to Huston, even the dust lodged in the existing cracks
had made the trip from the Palisades to Santa Barbara intact.</TE>
<TE>   Rothe pronounced the move an unprecedented success. "Absolutely
spectacular. I think it is a 99.9% success rate, which is impossible
with any intervention."</TE>
<TE>   Du Pont was more than ready to begin what she referred to as "the
presentation phase" of the project, when conservation gives way to
restoration.</TE>
<TE>   "Less is more," she said in May. "I don't like to go back to works
of art and, what is it Ted Turner does? Colorize them. It does have a
patina of age, that is part of its history. We're not going to give
it a high-gloss finish. It never had it, and we're not going to apply
it."</TE>
<TE>   Still, obvious damage was repaired, such as the underside of
Calles' sombrero, which had lost its contour and original color due
to oxidation. "We'll just paint in reversible materials so you can
take it off in the future without threatening the [original] paint,"
Huston said.</TE>
<TE>   Though no one seemed to regret it, there was one major, inevitable
loss: the way Siqueiros' composition related to its original domestic
setting. Rothe acknowledged the problem: "In some ways the museum
destroys the purpose of the work of art, but it protects it and
preserves it and makes it available. This is an appropriate setting,
even though it is not exactly where it was painted."</TE>
<TE>   But Du Pont sees much to be gained by the new setting. In her
view, critics and art historians have tended to under-appreciate
"Mexico Today," ranking it too far below "America Tropical " on
Olvera Street.</TE>
<TE>   "It is not what one would call the best Siqueiros around," says
Los Angeles Times art critic Christopher Knight, who has yet to see
the mural in person. Its value in his view is more historical than
artistic: "This is a fairly conservative example of an artist's
in-your-face politically based painting."</TE>
<TE>   Experts dismiss it "because they have not had the opportunity to
examine it," Du Pont counters. "The beauty is that this is the very
thing that preserved it. Murals are supposed to be public art, this
work, in its monumentality and simplicity is there. Our hope is this
is the beginning of the research and meaning of the piece."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>

<HD>Latin Grammys' Crossover Bid Lost in the Translation</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>AGUSTIN GURZA</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If the Latin Grammys were a chemical experiment instead of a cultural
one, a dark cloud of acrid smoke would have engulfed the Kodak
Theatre in Hollywood the night the third annual awards were handed
out.</LD>
<LD>   Something went terribly wrong with this attempt to bring Latin
music to a mainstream audience. Ratings of the prime-time CBS
telecast proved that "crossover" is an unstable element: The show
bombed.</LD>
<LD>   The question now is: Shall we brave the laboratory again? Or
should we just let this exciting music crawl back to the ethnic
ghetto where some people think it belongs?</LD>
<TE>   It would be a shame if this year's poor ratings meant the end of
the Latin Grammys. The awards have made a strong contribution to
Latin music, acknowledging excellent artists we may never have heard
of otherwise. Finally, Latin music was starting to get its due.</TE>
<TE>   But at this point in the Latin Grammys' brief history, it's time
to either give up or get smart. Surely, there must be better ways to
present Latin music to uninitiated, English-speaking viewers than
simply ignore the fact that they are, well, uninitiated and
English-speaking.</TE>
<TE>   The telecast didn't seem to care whether anybody understood what
was going on. Most of the songs and many speeches were in Spanish.
And there was no attempt to explain who anybody was or why we should
care who wins.</TE>
<TE>   For example, mariachi singer Vicente Fernandez was introduced as
the person of the year, having been honored the night before at an
annual fund-raising banquet for Grammy charities. But viewers learned
little about this larger-than-life personality, a man whose hits are
like anthems for immigrants ("Volver Volver") and the poor ("El
Rey"), and who endured the kidnapping of one of his sons, singer
Vicente Jr., who had two fingers cut off in the ordeal.</TE>
<TE>   Why not run a short film tribute to "Chente," as fans call the
King of Rancheras? Why not visit his ranch and interview him with a
voiced-over English translation?</TE>
<TE>   And for heaven's sake, why not make it clearer to viewers that he
is competing with another son, the handsome heartthrob Alejandro, for
best ranchero album?</TE>
<TE>   A father-and-son rivalry could add a touch of drama to the
otherwise overlooked category. Instead, after Fernandez finished his
number, his son simply appeared in his tight leather charro suit and
sang his own song. Viewers unaware of the family connections must
have wondered: Who's this guy?</TE>
<TE>   And so it went all night, one missed opportunity after another.</TE>
<TE>   The point that escaped the producers is that culture is composed
of a million bits of shared data, stored information that groups
accumulate all their lives.</TE>
<TE>   Without that bank of common understanding, things don't make much
sense or have much emotional impact. Elton John's "Candle in the
Wind" gains power and meaning if you know about the lives of Marilyn
Monroe and Princess Diana.</TE>
<TE>   People bring a lot to these pop culture events. We care who wins
because we know enough to care.</TE>
<TE>   This is where the Latin Grammys failed their potential audience.
The show didn't give them a reason or a way to relate.</TE>
<TE>   The Latin Grammys debuted in 2000, after Ricky Martin's crossover
success. But "Livin' La Vida Loca" was an American, not a Latin, pop
music phenomenon. Martin's lyrics and sexiness required no
translation.</TE>
<TE>   Same for Shakira, this year's crossover sensation. She's a global
hit partly because the whole world appreciates a talented pelvis. And
the whole world embraces pop music in English.</TE>
<TE>   Thus, American and British rock stars don't have to struggle to be
accepted in Latin America. Spanish-speaking fans follow the Rolling
Stones (nicknamed Los Rolling, not the Stones) whether they
understand the lyrics or not.</TE>
<TE>   Selling culture in the other direction takes a lot more work. The
occasional Spanish-language act sneaks through to the U.S.
mainstream, but it's either a novelty such as "La Macarena" or a
fluke, a la the Buena Vista Social Club.</TE>
<TE>   There will never be enough crossover acts to carry a Latin Grammy
show year after year. And reaching for ratings by trotting out the
same ol' names every year, such as Gloria Estefan and Celia Cruz,
only makes the scene seem stale.</TE>
<TE>   But that doesn't mean the show is doomed. It simply means it must
change its approach.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps the Latin Grammy ceremony should not be aired live. Maybe
it should be taped and then prepared for later broadcast. That would
give producers the chance to fill in all that missing
information--the background on artists, the musical context in
various countries, the trends in the different categories. And most
important, subtitles could be provided for lyrics and acceptance
speeches.</TE>
<TE>   A small taste of what this show might look like was provided four
days after the Latin Grammy fiasco. That Sunday, KABC-TV's weekly
public affairs show "Vista L.A." focused on the Latin Grammys, the
artists and the music. With background interviews and reporting, the
show seemed so much more interesting and understandable.</TE>
<TE>   This year's disappointing awards show led some people to ask why
we need a separate Latin Grammy anyway. We don't have Chinese
Grammys, do we?</TE>
<TE>   Every bold experiment is bound to spark a backlash. But let's not
let ignorance or cultural narrow-mindedness spoil a good thing. Let's
not put such a rich culture back in its little ghetto box. Instead,
let's find smarter ways to present it so others can come to
appreciate it too.</TE>

<LD>Since I saw the 14-year-old Reese Witherspoon in her first film,
Robert Mulligan's 1991 "Man in the Moon," I've been watching for the
realizations of her potential. The character, the irrepressibility
and the determination were all there ("Anything but Dumb," by Lynn
Smith, Sept. 29).</LD>
<LD>   One can never predict what the future holds for precocious child
actors, so I, for one, am delighted with what the future held for
this one.</LD>

<TE>   I'm not impressed that Reese Witherspoon earns $15 million a

entertainment industry in this town starts paying its secretarial and
support staff more than $10 to $12 an hour.</TE>

<LD>Bill Wolfe's railing against the money spent on the Cathedral of Our
Lady of the Angels, when it could have been spent on the poor,
parallels the Gospels, including Matthew 26:6-13 (Letters, Sept. 29).</LD>
<LD>   In the Gospels, a woman uses expensive oils to wash and consecrate
the feet of Jesus. This act outraged the Apostles, saying that the
money spent for the oils should have been spent on the poor. Jesus
replied that the poor will always be with us, but there are times
when men and women need to spend money to consecrate God in our
humanly ways.</LD>
<LD>   Since the cathedral is a house of God dedicated to the woman who
gave birth to Jesus and while, unfortunately, the poor are still with
us 2,000 years after Jesus, I do not believe it is immoral to have
spent money for the cathedral.</LD>
<TE>   Efforts to eradicate poverty and feed the hungry must always be a
pressing priority of the church, and the church, while imperfect in
an imperfect world, has not, I believe, abandoned efforts to feed the
hungry. But if everyone has a big house, as Wolfe suggests, it only
benefits the owners and their private guests. But if men and women
use their God-given talents of architecture, art, science,
construction, finance and so forth to build a house of worship
dedicated to God and consecrate it to Jesus as the woman did with her
oils, then we have striven to give praise to God with our meager
abilities.</TE>
<TE>   The cathedral, unlike a private house, is open to all, and rich
and poor can enter and present themselves to God whenever they so
choose, and indeed in it seek spiritual nourishment.</TE>

<TE>   Groovy, a big Sunday Calendar story on that mediocre '60s rock
group the Electric Prunes. What a trip, since the night before I read
this I had gone to a concert featuring a truly classic and
influential '60s group, Love Featuring Arthur Lee, and like most of
the people in the capacity crowd was blown away.</TE>
<TE>   This is the same Arthur Lee who while touring in England this
summer was invited to Parliament because members had approved a
motion declaring "Forever Changes" the greatest album of all time.</TE>

<LD>I just want to say the French have it right. They're obviously more
mature and sophisticated ("For the French, Age Is Just a Number," by
Lorenza Munoz, Sept. 29). They also have their focus clearer by
considering the movie media more an art form than a business matter.</LD>
<LD>   Hollywood, on the other hand, has taken the form and warped it by
turning it into a business and much less an art. But as to
appreciating the so-called older woman, I really could identify with
the French view on this subject.</LD>
<LD>   In Hollywood, "older" is anything above 30 but below 39. Above 40,
you're practically a hag. The entertainment media in general have
long been projecting a shallow image of feminine pulchritude as only
young, beautiful, overly curvaceous and with little other worthwhile
traits. Is she good in bed? Otherwise, who needs her?</LD>
<TE>   They've been doing a great disservice by their failure to see that
the older woman has her own special beauty, refined by years of
learning and experience. She's actually gallons sexier than her
twentysomething sister.</TE>
<TE>   There are a lot of us "older women" out here who would like to see
our image portrayed on the screen in a flattering manner. And I
think, too, that there are a sufficient number of mature men who
would enjoy that as well.</TE>
<TE>   Hollywood has written us off as irrelevant. But, in my estimation,
they've become irrelevant. That's why I rarely go to the movies
anymore, or even bother renting them.</TE>

<TE>   C'mon, Calendar, get real. Danner, Cattrall, Janney, Helgenberger
do not represent older, mature women ("Wanted: Women of a Certain
Age," by Janice Rhoshalle Littlejohn, Sept. 15).</TE>
<TE>   These are all striking, very attractive, svelte women who look 10
years younger than their actual age.</TE>
<TE>   Barbara Walters, aided with numerous face-lifts, and Diane Sawyer
also fall into the "beautiful" category. Do any of you actually
believe that a 50- or 60-year-old looking like everyday women of that
age would ever make it on television? Of course not. We saw lawsuits
from anchorwomen here because they were fired due to their "age."</TE>
<TE>   There are no older, mature 60- to 70-year-olds, and no woman over
50 who is not a comedian, or looks that age, appearing in a leading
role. Men of all ages, some close to 80, are still active on
television. Yet there aren't any female Andy Griffiths or Dick Van
Dykes around. Even, sadly, Angela Lansbury admitted she had cosmetic
surgery.</TE>
<TE>   Women, especially the National Organization for Women, are totally
responsible because they have done not one thing to correct this over
a lifetime of discrimination in the entertainment industry.</TE>
<TE>   The day will never come when a craggy-faced, deeply etched,
old-looking actress equivalent to Sean Connery, James Caan or Clint
Eastwood holds a leading romantic role on either screen.</TE>

<DH>Sean Curran, an alumnus of Jones/Zane and 'Stomp,' kicks
around ideas in his own troupe.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>VICTORIA LOOSELEAF</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sean Curran might be called a hybrid for dance's new century: He's
been at the top of the serious dance game for nearly 20 years, having
been a member of the Bill T. Jones/Arnie Zane Dance Company for a
decade, and yet he also knows the ropes of commercial dance, hoofing
for the off-Broadway mega-hit "Stomp" for four years.</LD>
<LD>   Adding spice to this mix, Curran, whose parents immigrated to
Boston in the 1950s from Ireland, was a step-dancing whiz as a child.</LD>
<LD>   What he's made from all this diversity is the Sean Curran Dance
Company. Founded in 1997, the troupe features athletic, quirky and
accessible dance, run through a decidedly postmodern mill.</LD>
<TE>   One of the pieces coming up this weekend at the Irvine Barclay
Theatre is "Sonata (We Are What We Were)," a work that was slated for
DanceCleveland's opening night performance in July but was deemed too
serious for an outdoor venue.</TE>
<TE>   Curran the showman was sympathetic; Curran the serious
choreographer was disappointed. "Outdoors generally means light,
happy works. That's what they were thinking," he explains by
telephone from his current hometown, Manhattan. "This piece is a
response to Sept. 11. It's about a community having a shared sense of
grief and loss. At the last minute, they wanted us to do 'Folk Dance
for the Future,' which is my response to 'Riverdance,' and is kind of
an old joke now."</TE>
<TE>   Curran spent his childhood years literally kicking around at Irish
weddings, Celtic dance festivals and retirement dinners in Boston. He
moved to New York for college, earning a degree in dance from New
York University.</TE>
<TE>   Shortly thereafter, in 1984, he segued into one of contemporary
dance's most respected ensembles, the Bill T. Jones/Arnie Zane Dance
Company. Within a year, he won a Bessie Award for his solo
performance in Jones/Zane's "Secret Pastures."</TE>
<TE>   "I always say that from Bill I learned a respect for
outrageousness. From Arnie, I learned about art history and
formalism," Curran says. "They were two very different artists, but
it was a great way to learn how to make a dance."</TE>
<TE>   By the time Curran left the company, Zane had died of
complications from AIDS, Curran was battling alcohol and substance
abuse (Curran says he's been sober for the last nine years) and Jones
had achieved star status. Jones and Curran are somewhat tight-lipped
about Curran's departure. The dancer says, "I left to do my own
work." Jones says only that it was time for Curran to leave.</TE>
<TE>   But Curran took a detour. "A casting director found out I'd left
the company and called because he knew I did Irish step dancing. I
was hired to be in the first New York City-based company of 'Stomp.'
The thing that 'Stomp' taught me is that the more accessible it is,
the more lucrative it is. If you're a modern dancer, your salary
doesn't go up."</TE>
<TE>   "Stomp" allowed Curran to save money and present his own
choreography. The success of the annual shows he presented from 1995
to 1997 at Manhattan's St. Mark's Church encouraged him to form the
Sean Curran Company.</TE>
<TE>   "At the time, I said I'll never have a modern dance company," he
said. "You'll have your hand out the rest of your life looking for
help. Last year, I was pleased when I did my taxes and saw that we
paid my four women and four men for 29 weeks of work."</TE>
<TE>   The company of nine dancers, including Curran, who dances a little
less since turning 40 last year, has been to Europe three times, has
received grants from the likes of the Philip Morris Cos. and
regularly receives commissions for new works. In addition to doing an
annual season at New York City's Joyce Theater, the company averages
about 10 domestic gigs yearly. In between, Curran has managed to
squeeze in other choreographing duties, for the 2000 Broadway show
"James Joyce's 'The Dead,' " as well as two works for Trinity Irish
Dance Theater.</TE>
<TE>   With appearances in Los Angeles last year and in Orange County
this year, the Southland has had a chance to see Curran's newest work
within months of its premiere. "Sonata," with music by Leos Janacek,
debuted to strong reviews in March. The non-narrative dance features
linked-arm ensembles, implying fellowship, as well as duets and
smaller groups.</TE>
<TE>   "I wanted to make a well-crafted, old-fashioned work in the
tradition of Jose Limon," Curran says. "I've made a lot of dances to
Janacek--I think I was Eastern European in a former life.</TE>
<TE>   "The music is unruly, beautiful and ugly. I love the four-section
sonata form--an opening, a men's section, a women's section and a
resolution. There is a Balanchine-blue [background] with clouds, and
tiny white children's chairs ring the space. I showed the video to a
class at the Alvin Ailey School, and one of the dancers said the set
reminded him of the Oklahoma City bombing memorial."</TE>
<TE>   The theme of loss also courses through "Six Laments," another West
Coast premiere slated for Irvine and created in 1999 for the Jacob's
Pillow Dance Festival. Curran had recently lost 20 pounds, but he
was, more important, thinking about his transition from performer to
choreographer. A series of six solos and duets, it is danced to an
original, elegiac score by Seamus Egan.</TE>
<TE>   "I was in my late 30s then and was in the process of losing my
powers as a performer," he says. "I'm still performing, but I can't
just call upon that technique. I have a natural, God-given ability,
but with time, age and fatigue, I was losing it."</TE>
<TE>   Still, Curran will dance in Irvine, in another work that's new
this year, "From the Ether, With Instinct." He calls the piece, which
rounds out the Irvine concert, a deconstruction, a homage to '80s
dance music, in this case, the Scottish band Young Marble Giants.</TE>
<TE>   "I wanted to make something that looks back to discos and clubs.
It's more a flip and irreverent look at people and courting and
mating dancing. The band is pre-punk, a naked guitar sound."</TE>
<TE>   There are more new Curran works coming soon in New York. In
November, New York City Opera, with Glimmerglass Opera, will present
Chabrier's "L'Etoile," which Curran choreographed. Curran likens the
production of the 1877 opera to a music hall piece and says it's
"very show biz," including a glitzy cancan number. Next year,
Playwrights Horizon mounts "My Life With Albertine," based on
Proust's "Remembrance of Things Past," which will reunite Curran with
"The Dead" writer-director team, Richard Nelson and Jack Hofsiss.</TE>
<TE>   Curran confesses that he would like to do a full-fledged Broadway
musical, but he then counters that notion. "I make very athletic,
robust, sweaty, physical dance," he says. "People have said I'm a
maximalist--my dances collapse under their own weight. Although I'm
interested in theater, I'm not a storyteller."</TE>
<TE>   Curran pauses, then adds, "The 'Stomp' guys came up with this one
brilliant idea, worked it to death, and it made them millionaires. I
wish I could think of my version of that. People tell me, 'You've got
to make the St. Patrick's Day "Nutcracker." ' I'm not interested. I
want to be known as a good craftsman."</TE>

<HD>Bollywood Meets Lloyd Webber</HD>
<DH>The canny composer's production of 'Bombay Dreams' is the
pick of the latest litter of musical theater CDs</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DARYL H. MILLER</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It seemed that once upon a time, every family owned a copy of
"Oklahoma!" and "My Fair Lady."</LD>
<LD>   But with rare exceptions, cast albums have always been a niche
market, and their share has fallen so low that nowadays they must
pass through radically downsized divisions at major labels or hope to
find a guardian angel at an independent specialty label.</LD>
<LD>   So when cast recordings or other related albums make their way
through the pipeline, the faithful say a little thank-you to the
theater gods and head to the store with credit cards handy. Here are
a few recent arrivals:</LD>
<TE>   *** 1/2</TE>
<TE>   "Bombay Dreams"</TE>
<TE>   Sony Classical</TE>
<TE>   For better or worse, Andrew Lloyd Webber's ability to spot trends
is key to his success. His early musicals in the '70s helped solidify
rock 'n' roll's place in theater, and his grand visions in the '80s
reflected and perpetuated the gaudy opulence of that era.</TE>
<TE>   Now he has caught wind of the growing popularity of Indian music,
envisioning a musical for which he invited film composer A R Rahman
to write the score. The result is an appealing if not entirely
successful marriage of the Western stage musical and the exuberant,
melodically irresistible Indian film musicals for which Rahman is
famous. ("Dil Se" and "Lagaan" are just a couple of the movies that
have made him among the most-listened-to songwriters on the planet.)</TE>
<TE>   "Bombay Dreams" opened in London in June with a story typical of
the musicals turned out by the hundreds by Bollywood (so called
because Bombay is India's Hollywood). Young slum-dweller Akaash (Raza
Jaffrey) dreams of Bollywood stardom and gets his chance when he
meets and falls in love with Priya (Preeya Kalidas), the daughter of
a film mogul. Their happiness, however, is quickly threatened by the
business' corrupting nature.</TE>
<TE>   The best songs pulse with the herky-jerky, techno-driven rhythms
that fuel the elaborate dance numbers in Rahman's movies. "Shakalaka
Baby" was born for the dance floor and has been released as a single
in the U.K., while Akaash's dream theme "Like an Eagle" is propelled
by a chorus of voices chanting "Bollywood."</TE>
<TE>   "The Journey Home," on the other hand, is a quietly insinuating
ballad in which Akaash describes the simpler joys of his original
life.</TE>
<TE>   The drawback: Rahman and Lloyd Webber (the show's producer) stick
so closely to the conventions of the Western musical that you can
almost hear the songs straining against their shackles. It's a rare
instance in which Lloyd Webber should have trusted his instincts
still more.</TE>
<TE>   The show is expected on Broadway in spring 2004.</TE>
<TE>   ***</TE>
<TE>   "Miss Spectacular"</TE>
<TE>   DRG Records</TE>
<TE>   Today as in the mid-'60s, when he introduced "Hello, Dolly!" and
"Mame," Jerry Herman writes songs that seem to parade right off the
stage.</TE>
<TE>   He has turned out another batch of irresistibly hummable tunes for
"Miss Spectacular," commissioned for a lavish Las Vegas casino show.
After plans for the production fell through, the songs were released
on this concept album.</TE>
<TE>   Nothing here quite equals Herman's best writing, but it's a
pleasant accompaniment to all that has come before, with the
lyricist-composer bringing his pep to styles ranging from early
Broadway to Rat Pack-era Vegas.</TE>
<TE>   The plot focuses on a Kansas girl who travels to Vegas in hopes of
winning a casino's nationwide spokesmodel search. Her daydreams erupt
as a Ziegfeld Follies number ("Ziegfeld Girl," crooned by Michael
Feinstein), a Jerome Kern/Irving Berlin-like cakewalk (the choral
number "Sarah Jane") and so on.</TE>
<TE>   The breakout songs are a ritzy ode to "Las Vegas," sung with
champagne sparkle by Steve Lawrence, and the comic "Where in the
World Is My Prince?," performed by Faith Prince.</TE>
<TE>   ***</TE>
<TE>   "Only Heaven"</TE>
<TE>   PS Classics</TE>
<TE>   Like the Langston Hughes poems that inspired them, the Ricky Ian
Gordon melodies in this song cycle are suspended between yearning and
ecstasy, between life's troubles and its transcendent joys.</TE>
<TE>   Audra McDonald has disseminated a couple of these songs in concert
and on compact disc: the evanescent "Daybreak in Alabama" and the
heartbreaking "Song for a Dark Girl," in which a woman's world cracks
after her lover's lynching. The rest of this music has been roaming
around for several years, with the show receiving a handful of small
New York outings. This version was recorded live earlier this year at
a production in Dayton, Ohio, that particularly pleased Gordon.</TE>
<TE>   Opera meets the blues in the voices of Adrienne Danrich, Darius de
Haas, Jonita Lattimore, Jay Pierce and Sheila Ramsey. Particularly
lovely are their renditions of "Heaven," which leaps with the refrain
"happiness is everywhere"; "Poor Girl's Ruination/The Dream Keeper,"
which dissolves at the end into sobs; "Love Song for Antonia," in
which a man is transported by the intensity of his feeling; and
"Litany," sung as a benediction to this wide-ranging journey through
human experience.</TE>
<TE>   ** 1/2</TE>
<TE>   "Mandy Patinkin Sings Sondheim"</TE>
<TE>   Nonesuch</TE>
<TE>   Mandy Patinkin has a love-it-or-hate-it voice. He can sound sort
of freaky when he punches up into his pinched upper register; he
seems barely in control of his vibrato; and he has a proclivity for
hyperactive, curveball interpretations.</TE>
<TE>   His insight into the music of Stephen Sondheim, however, might
prompt even his detractors to purchase this double CD (due Oct. 29),
recorded live in Philadelphia in February. Though Patinkin and
pianist/co-arranger Paul Ford have included some of Sondheim's
best-known songs (including "Send In the Clowns" and "Broadway
Baby"), they more often than not opt for the unexpected, as with two
little-heard songs from "Evening Primrose" ("When?" and "If You Can
Find Me, I'm Here").</TE>
<TE>   Still more fascinating is Patinkin's decision to treat long
stretches of the music as thematic units, with each song spilling
into the next. On the second disc, all but one of the dozen songs are
linked so that they seem to trace the emotions of someone progressing
from the euphoria of being single ("Free") through the ups and downs
of relationships ("Waiting for the Girls Upstairs," "Losing My Mind")
to contented commitment ("Take the Moment").</TE>
<TE>   Patinkin treats almost every number with supreme tenderness,
keeping his voice reined in while letting his emotions run free.</TE>
<TE>   **</TE>
<TE>   "Wall to Wall Richard Rodgers"</TE>
<TE>   Fynsworth Alley</TE>
<TE>   These 15 live selections have been culled from a 12-hour marathon
of Rodgers' music that in March helped to inaugurate the renovated
Symphony Space, a cultural touchstone on Manhattan's Upper West Side.</TE>
<TE>   Longing seeps up through the airy sophistication of these songs,
most of which have been chosen from the catalog of melodies written
to words by Lorenz Hart, not Oscar Hammerstein II.</TE>
<TE>   The renditions--by a smattering of Broadway's big names--are nice
enough, but aside from Judy Kaye's tender "Little Girl Blue" (from
"Jumbo"), these are the songs that everyone sings, in the styles that
everyone sings them.</TE>
<TE>   Still, there are pleasures to be found in Billy Stritch's jaunty
"Manhattan Greenery," Maureen McGovern's aching "It Never Entered My
Mind" and, especially, James Naughton's lushly romantic "You Are Too
Beautiful."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Albums are rated on a scale of one star (poor), two stars (fair),
three stars (good) and four stars (excellent). The albums are
released unless otherwise noted.</TE>

<HD>Getting Steeper All the Time</HD>
<DH>The theater is costly, and with good reason. But how many
people are turned off by having to pay five times what they would at
the movies?</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SEAN MITCHELL</AU>

<DL></DL>
<LD>One of the many things that appear to cost too much in our
entertainment-based culture of immense gratifications remains the
theater, the fabulous invalid of the arts that won't go away but also
won't let us down from the balcony for less than $50. Or so it often
seems, especially on trips to New York. And by the way, have you
tried to get your tickets for the "The Producers" at the Pantages
yet?</LD>
<LD>   The high cost of the ancient art of Shakespeare and O'Neill and
Shepard and Sondheim is not good news to those among us who want to
believe that theater can remain relevant to society at large and not
disappear behind the velvet ropes marking off territory reserved for
the rich. This fall brings the first $100 ticket to off-Broadway--for
Brecht, yet, even if it is Brecht ("The Resistible Rise of Arturo
Ui") performed by Al Pacino, Billy Crudup, Steve Buscemi and John
Goodman. Without regard to the quality of the show, it's hard to see
how at that price an entertainment does not qualify as elitist.</LD>
<LD>   When "The Producers" opens here at the Pantages in May, with
Martin Short and Jason Alexander, it will carry a top ticket price of
$90, a new local threshold.</LD>
<TE>   Compared with New York, prices remain, if not cheap, somewhat
lower in L.A. A survey of recent ticket prices here would reveal a
$45 top at our leading institutional theater, the Mark Taper Forum;
at the larger Ahmanson, $75; at the Geffen Playhouse, $46; the
Pasadena Playhouse, $60; "The Lion King" at the Pantages, $77; and
"The Full Monty" at the Orange County Performing Arts Center, $64.50.</TE>
<TE>   At smaller theaters like the Odyssey, the Falcon, Theatre West and
A Noise Within, tickets are in the $15-to-$40 range.</TE>
<TE>   That's still lot of money to spend on entertainment for anyone who
has to pay a baby-sitter while stretching to make the rent or
mortgage payment. But the first thing the producers at those theaters
will tell you--after they tell you it's not the theater's fault it
costs so much (and that no one is getting rich)--is that you can get
in for less if you really try. And they're right on both counts.</TE>
<TE>   In many a consumer's mind the theater suffers mainly from
comparison to that other more popular form of two-hour storytelling,
the movies, where you can usually get in for less than $10. To pay
two, three, four or five times that to see a play, you have to value
the difference: that film is a mass medium, with individual titles
showing on thousands of screens across the country at once, while a
play is a live event, being performed by actors in real time in a
single place for an audience of from 100 to 2,000 people. A
particular movie might be good and a particular play bad, but the
relative economics of each remain the same.</TE>
<TE>   It's mainly in competition with films that the theater looks
expensive, because when you check out the continued inflation in the
cost of attending other live events like rock and pop concerts, you
wonder who's paying those prices. The cheapest Bruce Springsteen
tickets on his current tour are $49.50, with many selling through
ticket services for upwards of $500. Top ticket for the Rolling
Stones concert at Staples is more than $300; for the Who, $153; Luis
Miguel, $140; Cher, $125; Jimmy Buffett, $75; Sheryl Crow, $60. When
the new Disney Hall opens next year, the best seats for Los Angeles
Philharmonic performances will increase from the current $82 to $120.</TE>
<TE>   Tickets to sporting events are also no bargain. Good seats to see
the Kings and the Lakers at Staples are $70 or more (with parking at
a price-gouging $15 to $20).</TE>
<TE>   But professional sports and pop music benefit from mass marketing,
television and radio exposure and iconography that only occasionally
touch the theater. Whatever the price of a ticket to a pop concert,
the audience often has a good idea of what to expect and can decide
whether it's worth the money. Likewise, while you can't be sure the
Lakers are going to win, you have a pretty good idea what the
experience inside Staples is going to be like.</TE>
<TE>   Going to theater is riskier. You have to be ready for anything.
Even if a play is familiar, it is likely to have unfamiliar actors,
and new plays are uncharted territory. Theatergoers have to value the
unique experience of being in that room with the actors and the other
members of the audience while something hand-made and human takes
place to allow for the possibility that what's on stage might not
transport them. Hope springs eternal that it will.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike sports and rock 'n' roll, the theater does provide ways to
bring down the carriage trade prices for students and others who
otherwise couldn't afford it. Any number of theaters have a weekly
pay-what-you-can night, like the one at Actors' Gang, the 99-seat
theater in Hollywood where "The Guys" is playing.</TE>
<TE>   Stage actors themselves--or at least the ones without a recurring
role on a prime-time sitcom--are sometimes among the first to take
advantage of such discounts. Brian Brophy, an actor, director and
educator associated with Actors' Gang, says he often tries to attend
pay-what-you-can nights at other theaters. "I usually end up not
paying full price," he says. "I'll pay $75 to see the Berliner
Ensemble at UCLA, but only because I see that as a personal
investment."</TE>
<TE>   Recently, a new discount program, Play7, was introduced by 15
sub-100-seat theaters (including Met Theatre, Circle X and the
Evidence Room) offering a one-year subscription for $77 that would
entitle the subscriber to seven unrestricted admissions to any of the
member theaters, reducing the individual ticket cost to $11.</TE>
<TE>   At larger theaters, including the Taper and the Ahmanson, a
limited number of "public rush" tickets are offered (as many as 250
at the Ahmanson and 55 at the Taper, on occasion) two hours before
curtain for each performance during the first weeks of a run at a
cost of $10 to $15.</TE>
<TE>   Most larger theaters offer other forms of discounts, beginning
with preview performances that are marked down from a few dollars to
50% of full-ticket price. In addition to a couple of pay-what-you-can
performances for each show, the Taper also provides a number of $6
tickets distributed through city social-service agencies.</TE>
<TE>   The last of these would seem to be essential for the people who
make up the subject of the Taper's current offering "Nickel and
Dimed"--that is, the working poor--to ever see the show.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a responsibility to make theater accessible," says Jim
Royce, the director of marketing and communications for Center
Theatre Group, which includes the Taper and the Ahmanson. "And there
are ways for people to get into the theater if they're willing to
explore a little bit."</TE>
<TE>   Theatre LA, which represents more than 150 local theaters (the
great majority of which have fewer than 100 seats) makes half-price
tickets available (with a $2-to-$6 service charge) on its Web site
for many shows on the day of performance, following the model of New
York's TKTS booth at Times Square. Instead of paying $50 to see
Reprise!'s "Anything Goes" at UCLA, you could have bought a ticket on
the Theatre LA Web site for $27.50. You can still see Harold Gould in
"Fellow Traveler" at the Malibu Stage Company for $10 rather than pay
the regular $20.</TE>
<TE>   "I think ticket prices are very scalable," says Lee Wochner,
president of Theatre LA, itself a nonprofit organization whose
half-price WebTix service has grown in two years, he says, from 1,000
registered users to 12,000. "You can make a point of going to see
'The Lion King' on a Saturday night and pay $127 [for special VIP
tickets], or you can find a way to go on another night for half that
or less."</TE>
<TE>   In fact, "The Lion King" offers senior and student discount
tickets for $25 (when available) and offers the last two rows of the
mezzanine for $12 in advance, as well as discounts through group
sales.</TE>
<TE>   It remains an irony that theater, which is far cheaper and more
accessible to produce than movies, costs far more to attend--simply
because it can only recoup its expenses a few hundred seats at a
time. And nonprofit theater, like dance, opera and symphony
orchestras, still requires private and public subsidy to meet its
budget. Although the need for funding beyond the box office is a
long-established fact for such cultural institutions, it's not a need
most Americans necessarily yet understand. It was only seven years
ago that our elected representatives in Congress nearly extinguished
the National Endowment for the Arts.</TE>
<TE>   I still remember hearing a well-known food critic remark around
the time of the debate over arts funding that he didn't see why a
theater deserved a subsidy any more than a restaurant. The market
should rule and quality would survive. That's a nice idea, but it
doesn't explain McDonald's, not to mention acknowledge the completely
different economics of scale and production involved.</TE>
<TE>   "The decrease in subsidies has continued year after year, and now
you have theaters operating in arrears and escalating ticket prices,"
says Wochner, even as he points to the discounts available through
his organization.</TE>
<TE>   Only increased subsidies, comparable to what European governments
spend, could bring the cost of theater tickets down in the U.S., and
that seems highly unlikely in the privatizing spirit of our age.</TE>
<TE>   We will probably never be like London, where, because of
tradition, the number of subsidized theaters, competition and lower
labor and advertising costs, theater prices for some of the world's
finest productions are still cheaper than in Los Angeles and New
York. In fact, theater is one of the few things that is cheaper. Top
ticket to a West End musical is about $62.</TE>
<TE>   Here, theater companies have to continue to battle the image of
elitism that sadly marginalizes the popular art they often put on
their stages. "You have to fight for the relevance of theater," says
Brophy, who has worked in big-budget feature films but also staged
plays with homeless actors downtown.</TE>
<TE>   "We live under the misapprehension that this is not a theater
town," says Wochner, who makes the claim that at whatever price, more
people attend the theater in Los Angeles County than all professional
sports events combined.</TE>
<TE>   Can this possibly be true? Imagine, then, what would happen if
more people weren't scared off by the prices they see at the box
office.</TE>

<HD>Black Flag, Unfurled</HD>
<DH>Those avatars of alienation may have flamed out in the
'80s, but a new CD preserves their spirit</DH>
<SE></SE>

<LD>American punk would not be the same without Black Flag.</LD>
<LD>   The Hermosa Beach-spawned band not only inspired hordes of
alienated '80s youths to vent their discontent, but also showed them
how to do it themselves. Its furious music, wailing vocals, intense
work ethic, sarcastic-to-shocking humor and egalitarian notions have
come to represent the principles, if not usually the reality, of
punk.</LD>
<LD>   Formed in 1977, the group kicked up controversy on many fronts.
Its anti-status-quo lyrics and provocative artwork (nuns in bondage
and the like) were extreme for the times. Its blue-collar values were
at odds with the more laid-back Hollywood punk scene, and its
audiences could be alarmingly destructive. Black Flag's tendency to
experiment with jazz, spoken-word and noise alienated different fans
at various points. The band endured a protracted early legal battle
with an MCA Records affiliate, and relationships among the players
were sometimes strained.</LD>
<TE>   Still, the group gained followers all over the country through
relentless touring, and it exposed listeners to some of its own
favorite acts via its label SST Records, which in its late '80s
heyday boasted such key alternative acts as Husker Du, the Minutemen,
Sonic Youth, Bad Brains and Dinosaur Jr. Before breaking up in 1986,
Black Flag had even begun to fuse metal and hard-core, foreshadowing
punk's next era.</TE>
<TE>   But Black Flag never realized--or wanted, at least in founding
member Greg Ginn's case--the commercial success that followers such
as the Offspring and Green Day found in the '90s. Singer Henry
Rollins went on to a higher-profile solo career in music and spoken
word, as well as in writing and publishing. The reclusive Ginn
released several solo albums in the '90s and still quietly runs SST
and affiliate Cruz Records in Long Beach.</TE>
<TE>   While a reunion is as unlikely as Johnny Rotten wearing flared
jeans, Black Flag--or at least its music and its nose for a good
fight--is back, in a way.</TE>
<TE>   "Rise Above: Twenty-Four Black Flag Songs to Benefit the West
Memphis Three," an album due in stores Tuesday from Sanctuary
Records, features Rollins' current band (a.k.a. Mother Superior)
backing a wide array of guest vocalists--including Rollins himself,
original Black Flag singer Keith Morris and bassist Chuck Dukowski,
Iggy Pop, Exene Cervenka, Ice-T, Hank Williams III and Nick Oliveri
from Queens of the Stone Age--on vintage Black Flag songs.</TE>
<TE>   Its proceeds will benefit three youths who many believe were
wrongly convicted in the 1993 murders of three 8-year-old boys in
tiny West Memphis, Ark. The case has already inspired a 2000 benefit
album and numerous fund-raising concerts, and it has been examined in
two documentary films, "Paradise Lost: The Child Murders at Robin
Hood Hill" and "Paradise Lost 2: Revelations," which HBO2 will air
again on Oct. 15 and 16, respectively.</TE>
<TE>   Launched with a menacing call-out by rapper Chuck D before
Rollins' blistering update of "Rise Above," the album preserves the
spirit of Black Flag. The metallic crunch on some tracks underscores
the music's timelessness, updating the sound while preserving its
eccentric rhythms. And the variety of performers reflects how deeply
Black Flag's righteous fury touched a collective rebellious nerve.</TE>
<TE>   "They were kind of like therapists, in a way," Hank Williams III
(who performs "No Values" on the album) says of the band. "Whenever
my mom used to yell at me or tell me to go to my room, I'd just put
on Black Flag and freak out."</TE>
<TE>   Named after an anarchy symbol, Black Flag initially consisted of
Ginn, Dukowski, Morris and drummer Brian Migdol. Morris left in 1978
to form the equally seminal Circle Jerks, and by 1981, when Rollins
joined, the group had gone through two more singers.</TE>
<TE>   Ginn's spastic, time-warped guitar style was the band's hallmark,
and it remains unique, a sonic expression of his own internal
cadences. Other than that and the four-bar band logo created by his
brother, artist Raymond Pettibon (who parlayed his vivid work on
Black Flag covers and posters into a thriving career as an artist),
Black Flag deliberately avoided creating an image.</TE>
<TE>   The players' inattention to fashion and refusal to identify with
any single group put a distance between them and the Hollywood punk
scene. They did play gigs in L.A., but they also held countless shows
everywhere from garages to concert halls around the South Bay.</TE>
<TE>   By taking their music away from the metropolis, Black Flag helped
expand punk's range into the suburbs. All that touring put them in
the ranks of such hard-core Johnny Appleseeds as Canada's D.O.A., who
eventually made punk accessible to just about everyone, anywhere, who
cared.</TE>
<TE>   Yet for an act that had such an effect on one genre, its members
certainly didn't identify with it.</TE>
<TE>   "We never felt any kinship with punk rock," Rollins says. "I mean,
the Sex Pistols--Greg and Chuck thought those guys were the biggest
fakes." That duo didn't like anybody except such friend-bands as the
Minutemen, Saccharine Trust, Redd Kross, Descendents, Husker Du, and
D.O.A., along with Black Sabbath, Television, the Velvet Underground,
Lou Reed, Iggy Pop and John Coltrane.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, Ginn thought of Black Flag's music as updated blues.
"That's not something I would say all the time, because then you
offend blues purists," says Ginn, who is generally reluctant to
analyze Black Flag's effect beyond relating the facts and describing
his own motivations.</TE>
<TE>   He formed the group for fun, and because he didn't like how
progressive rock had brought neo-classical elements into mainstream
'70s rock. Ginn thought rock should move back toward its blues base,
and he believed there was a continuing need for the visceral
experience provided by such groups as Black Sabbath.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not like 1-4-5 blues, but it's coming from that
open-emotion, raw-integrity thing," Rollins says. "Dukowski used to
say it's like when a dog barks. It's not trying to get signed; it's
just telling you how it is, in a very unrestrained way. That's how
[Ginn's] songs are."</TE>
<TE>   To many disenfranchised listeners, a Black Flag song didn't just
describe a moment. It was the moment. Hilarious and harrowing tunes
such as "Nervous Breakdown," "Fix Me," "Police Story" and "TV Party"
bluntly and often with extreme irony expressed the boredom,
frustration and harassment of chafing against a world of conformity
and consumerism. And what is Ginn's "Rise Above" but a spiritual that
spits, rather than prays, in the face of adversity?</TE>
<TE>   Jealous cowards try to control</TE>
<TE>   Rise above we're gonna rise above</TE>
<TE>   They distort what we say</TE>
<TE>   Rise above we're gonna rise above</TE>
<TE>   Try and stop what we do</TE>
<TE>   Rise above</TE>
<TE>   When they can't do it themselves</TE>
<TE>   We are tired of your abuse</TE>
<TE>   Try to stop us it's no use ...</TE>
<TE>   Yet despite lyrics that decried police harassment, inattentive
women and heroin use, along with pretty much anything remotely the
norm, Ginn wasn't trying to shock people. Like a blues performer, he
was just telling stories. "The songs were pretty autobiographical and
personal," he says. "Not always about myself, but coming from
situations [involving] either myself or people I knew."</TE>
<TE>   Rollins, who has been strongly dismissive of musicians who don't
move forward creatively, found it intense to revisit those situations
two decades later as he oversaw the tribute album, even though he
didn't write the lyrics. Yet he also was enlightened by the
experience. "Talk about putting a lot of stuff into a little bit of
time!" he says. "Those songs are like a minute and a half, and it's a
meal in the size of a bonbon. It's astounding." The music's emotional
intensity also came back, Rollins says. "You start registering all
that old stuff, and you see how thoroughly hectic and unrelenting
those lyrics were."</TE>
<TE>   As was life in Black Flag. Rollins recalls that Ginn had them
practicing even while touring. "We were a really good band because of
[Greg and Chuck's] work ethic," Rollins says.</TE>
<TE>   Yet that work ethic, and Black Flag's emphasis on perfection,
wasn't part of punk, Ginn says. "We were looked down upon for
considering [having our own] PA system important, for example," he
says. "The attitude was, 'Why do you care? Why are you doing all this
work? You should be hanging out.' "</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, the focus on putting resources back into the music was
singular to a fault. Some might even call it ironically dogmatic for
a band so opposed to dogma. "We were very poor, all sleeping on the
floor, with bugs in our hair," Rollins says. "We were shoplifting for
food, eating off people's plate."</TE>
<TE>   In this dire environment, he says, the members often clashed. "It
was not an easy bunch of people to mingle with. It was hard for us to
be around each other. It was hard for us to be around ourselves."</TE>
<TE>   What really torpedoed Black Flag, however, was Ginn's refusal to
yield to changing times. By the mid-'80s, when the commercial
possibilities of punk became apparent, some people around the band
saw a career option, Ginn says. "That was kind of the end," he adds.</TE>
<TE>   In a world where "punk" has gone from cottage industry to
registered trademark, where even Kurt Cobain lamented fame but still
took that major-label ride, it might be tough to believe someone
would actually shut down his band rather than see success destroy his
ideals. Ginn acknowledges this. "When 'It's all about the music' is
an MTV slogan, it's hard to talk about these things" without drawing
cynicism, he says.</TE>
<TE>   If not compromising meant Black Flag was doomed to mere
underground-legend status, well, Ginn doesn't seem too upset. Indeed,
you get the feeling he'd be more distressed if his songs were
selling, say, flared jeans.</TE>
<TE>   "All of a sudden there was something to lose, and it brought in
that thing of, 'What do we have to hold onto?' " Ginn says of punk's
'80s paradigm shift. "Where I had always enjoyed being reckless about
those things."</TE>

<TE>   All the albums are on the SST label.</TE>
<TE>   Damaged (1981). The definitive Cali hard-core album. Henry Rollins
debuts here, with a roar to match Greg Ginn's furious guitar work on
such sardonic, defiant commentaries as "Rise Above," "TV Party" and
"Gimmie Gimmie Gimmie."</TE>
<TE>   Who's Got the 10 1/2 (1986). This live album mixes older material
with selections from the less-than-stellar "Loose Nut," but sharp
playing and Rollins' spoken-word bits make it worthwhile.</TE>
<TE>   The First Four Years (1983). A collection of the band's

<HD>Lisa Germano's Ineffable Way With Alcohol</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>In pop music, alcohol generally gets served up two ways. You can have
it as party fuel embraced as part of the lifestyle, or a demon held
at bay by 12-step sobriety.</LD>
<LD>   This side of vintage George Jones, though, you rarely hear someone
say she may drink too much for her own good but is going to live with
it.</LD>
<LD>   That's exactly the ground singer-songwriter Lisa Germano stakes
out with a new album, "Lullaby for Liquid Pig," a poetically dark and
frank song cycle due in January.</LD>
<TE>   "For two years it was just going to be called 'Liquid Pig,' "
Germano says. "I was disgusted with how much I was drinking. I was
saying to myself, 'You have a problem, don't you? Well, you don't
have any friends anymore.' "</TE>
<TE>   In the course of making the album, the scope expanded to address
anything that might be used as an emotional crutch. And she does have
friends, including musician-producer Joey Waronker, who helped her
craft the seductively impressionistic atmospheres, with contributions
from such associates as Neil Finn and former Smiths guitarist Johnny
Marr.</TE>
<TE>   But Germano, a former John Mellencamp violinist who has made a
series of intensely personal, probing albums as a solo artist and has
played with Eels and Finn in recent years, says that her alcohol
consumption remained the focus of the songs. And it's a matter on
which she has not reached any conclusions.</TE>
<TE>   "I still haven't decided," she says. "I don't think I'm an
alcoholic, but I was watching it. The honest truth is I don't think I
have a problem. I don't think I need to go to rehab."</TE>
<TE>   She knows this is a sensitive subject.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been a little scared," she says. "People may go, 'Oh yeah,
Lisa Germano, she's the alcoholic.' I don't care what people think
about me in the media or the music business. I think of it as
expression."</TE>
<TE>   Expression was the great attraction for Tony Berg, an A&amp;R
executive at ArtistDirect Records who chose "Liquid Pig" to be the
inaugural album for a new label he has started to showcase artists
exploring personal expression and challenging music. Berg, a producer
and former executive at Geffen Records (where he signed Beck) and
Virgin Records, has been developing the concept of his new label,
named Ineffable, for more than three years.</TE>
<TE>   "Once upon a time, the most ambitious and most original music was
also the most commercial music," Berg says. "So there's a generation
of listeners that grew up with that expectation of its artists, and I
bring that expectation to the artists I'll work with at Ineffable.
And Lisa clearly articulates an ambitious, challenging point of
view."</TE>
<TE>   Key to Ineffable, Berg says, is a nontraditional structure
involving only one-album deals, higher royalty rates than standard
contracts and, most distinctively, an arrangement in which each
artist will also be a partner in the label. He hopes to cultivate
touring and recording collaborations among the acts and perhaps even
attract major-label artists looking for a home for a creative
side-trip.</TE>
<TE>   "Since I'm the first one on the label, I'm eager for there to be
more people and for us to play together," Germano says. "It will be
really fun to see how this progresses."</TE>
<TE>   THOSE '70S SHOWS: Jim Freek left his job as pop music columnist
for the recently folded New Times L.A. to start the Teenacide Records
label, but it seems he stepped into a time warp. Freek is launching
two projects echoing '70s rock. One is Cheap Chick, billed as the
world's first all-female Cheap Trick tribute band--a claim that is
probably true, if unsubstantiated.</TE>
<TE>   But the big extravaganza in the works is Cal Jam III. Freek and
publicist Pam Utterback (who doubles as Cheap Chick bassist Pam
Cheaterson) are putting together a Nov. 30 event at Spaceland in
homage to the massive 1974 and 1978 California Jam festivals at
Ontario Motor Speedway that featured Black Sabbath, Deep Purple,
Aerosmith and others.</TE>
<TE>   Cheap Chick will perform at the show, which will also feature
'70s-inspired (though not specifically tribute) bands Teen Machine
and Authorized Dealer, with guest stars expected. Freek and Utterback
say the show will re-create the aura of the original fests, if not
the scale, right down to the tailgating scene in the parking lot.</TE>
<TE>   SMALL FACES: TLC's Tionne "T-Boz" Watkins and Rozonda "Chilli"
Thomas joined Missy Elliott for "Can You Hear Me," a song dedicated
to TLC member Lisa "Left Eye" Lopes, who died in a car crash in
April, and other hip-hop and R&amp;B singers who have passed away in
recent years. The song will close Elliott's album "Under
Construction," due from Elektra Records on Nov. 12. Other guests
elsewhere on the album include Jay-Z, Method Man, Ludacris, Beyonce
Knowles and Ms. Jade....</TE>
<TE>   They Might Be Giants was first known for the "Dial-a-Song" tunes
it placed on its phone answering machine. Now the duo is auctioning a
chance for a customized phone-message song. The weeklong auction
starts today on EBay and closes next Sunday, co-sponsored by Rhino
Records (which has released TMBG's "Dial-a-Song" anthology) with all
proceeds going to the Reading Is Fundamental charity....</TE>
<TE>   Plans are being finalized for the first L.A. edition of Ladyfest,
a showcase for women in music and entertainment originated in
Olympia, Wash., in 2000 and since taken to other cities across the
country. The event will run Nov. 8-11 at the downtown Palace Theatre
with performers including Anna Waronker, Jenny Toomey and Kira
Roessler (with Mike Watt). The entire venture is nonprofit and
volunteer-run and will benefit the East Los Angeles Women's Shelter
and various after-school arts and music programs. In a preview
concert, singer Phranc will host a "Tupperware Pajama Party" on
Monday at the Echo....</TE>
<TE>   L.A. musician Kristian Hoffman, who as a close friend of Lance
Loud was prominent in "An American Family," the '70s PBS documentary
series chronicling the life of the Louds, has been asked to re-record
the show's instrumental theme for a new documentary update on the
family that will premiere Jan. 6. The new show was filmed last year
and concludes with Lance's death in December from complications of
hepatitis C.</TE>

<LD>   "Punch-Drunk Love," right, is not your typical Adam Sandler movie.
Nor is it what you might expect from Emily Watson. Paul Thomas
Anderson directed the unlikely romantic comedy that also features
Anderson regulars Philip Seymour Hoffman and Luis Guzman. Opens
Friday.</LD>
<LD>   Also: Bullets and sparks fly in "Bowling for Columbine," Michael
Moore's provocative examination of America's gun culture. The first
documentary in 46 years to compete in the Cannes Film Festival opens
Friday in selected theaters.</LD>
<TE>   Theater</TE>
<TE>   Diverse cultural elements converge on a magical soundscape in
"Hashirigaki," a new music theater piece by German composer Heiner
Goebbels. Taking its title from the classic "talking while walking"
element of Kabuki theater, the show weaves together the sounds of the
Beach Boys and Japanese folk music as well as a Gertrude Stein novel,
"The Making of Americans." Opens Thursday at UCLA's Freud Playhouse.</TE>
<TE>   Also: "Breaking New Ground" is the theme of this year's Edgefest
2002, the fourth annual Edge of the World Theater Festival. It
features more than 60 stage productions, 40 of them world premieres,
as well as special events--from round-table discussions about
intellectual property law and the definition of "edgy," to works in
progress exploring the history of L.A. and a safari through the heart
of Hollywood, tracing its theatrical roots. At venues throughout Los
Angeles County from Thursday through Oct. 20.</TE>
<TE>   Music</TE>
<TE>   A performance of the Verdi Requiem at the Orange County Performing
Arts Center tonight marks the farewell concert by the William Hall
Chorale and Orchestra, as founder-music director William Hall steps
down after 47 years. The chorale will become a resident component of
Chapman University in Orange. On this occasion, Hall, dean of the
Chapman School of Music, celebrates his 40th anniversary on the
university faculty. With the addition of the university and alumni
choirs--along with soloists Kathryn Carpenter, Catherine Stoltz,
Robert MacNeil and Louis Lebherz--more than 400 musicians will
perform.</TE>
<TE>   Pop Music</TE>
<TE>   Sweet-faced heartlander Conor Oberst sure has rattled the walls of
the rock academy this year. Desaparecidos, which is just his side
group, released a seriously rocking indictment of contemporary
conformity called "Read Music/Speak Spanish" in February. In the
summer, Bright Eyes, his primary platform, delivered the breakthrough
long predicted for the indie-rock wunderkind, "Lifted." The Omaha
prodigy brings Bright Eyes to town Thursday and Friday at the Henry
Fonda Theatre.</TE>
<TE>   Art</TE>
<TE>   The UCLA Hammer Museum opens its fall season today with three
exhibitions devoted to contemporary artists who employ radically
different approaches. "Dave Muller: Connections" will feature about
200 drawing and watercolor interpretations of art exhibition
announcements and invitations, including "Supergraphic," below. A new
multimedia video installation incorporating Arthur Penn's 1962 film
"The Miracle Worker" will compose "Catherine Sullivan: Five Economies
(big hunt/little hunt)." And Tokyo-based artist Tomoko Takahashi
creates an installation using found materials from the streets of
L.A.</TE>
<TE>   Jazz</TE>
<TE>   "Calle 54," Fernando Trueba's acclaimed film tribute to Latin
jazz, will come alive on stage when pianists Eliane Elias, Bebo
Valdes and Chano Dominguez, plus percussionist Giovanni Hidalgo,
flutist Dave Valentin and others perform Wednesday at Campbell Hall
at UC Santa Barbara and Thursday at UCLA's Royce Hall.</TE>

<LD>   JURASSIC 5</LD>
<LD>   "Power in Numbers"</LD>
<TE>   Interscope</TE>
<TE>   On its sophomore album (due in stores Tuesday), Jurassic 5 proves
that it's the spiritual evolution of not only South-Central hard-core
such as N.W.A, but also black power '60s-'70s proto-rappers the Last
Poets, vaporizing the inane muck of tired R&amp;B references like a blast
of pure ammonia with their intelligent rap. On "If You Only Knew,"
built, like the rest of the album, on funk and soul beats even more
spare than on their debut "Quality Control," J5 spit a fierce and
positive mission arc no one else dare follow: "We're humble, but
don't mistake us for some corny ... crew / What we do is try to give
you what you ain't used to / Soul music somethin' we can all relate
to."</TE>
<TE>   Now and again they slip into old-fashioned street corner cutting,
as on "One of Them," a kind of Pharcyde romp about self-involved
playboy gangstas preening in front of the mirror to the recurring
phrase, "Oh, you're one o' them...."</TE>
<TE>   "Thin Line," featuring vocals by Nelly Furtado, is the closest the
album comes to pop, but it never slips into the too-many-notes vocal
goo that's destroying the rest of hip-hop. The album's soaring,
defining moment is on the self-explanatory "I Am Somebody," a
Motown-via-'80s disco celebration of the common man that's bound to
be an uplift party anthem.</TE>
<TE>   --Dean Kuipers</TE>
<TE>   ***</TE>
<TE>   TOM PETTY</TE>
<TE>   &amp; THE HEARTBREAKERS</TE>
<TE>   "The Last DJ"</TE>
<TE>   Warner Bros.</TE>
<TE>   Petty has always seemed to have more in common with Joe Rock Fan
than the larger-than-life stars with whom he shares membership in the
Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. It's no surprise, then, that the anger,
frustration and sadness over the state-of-the-rock-union in this
loosely thematic album (due Tuesday) reflect the view of the
disheartened classic-rock fan more than that of the jaundiced rock
star.</TE>
<TE>   The album works on a number of levels, but the ambition behind the
songs and the off-the-cuff production doesn't slap you in the face.
On the surface, several numbers are straight-out poison-pen letters
to the commercial forces that compromise the art--and the fun--of
rock 'n' roll.</TE>
<TE>   It's hardly a revolutionary idea; the Kinks devoted much of their
1970 album, "Lola Versus Powerman and the Money-Go-Round, Pt. 1," to
the dispiriting machinations of the music business, and such
complaints have surfaced regularly ever since.</TE>
<TE>   But Petty brings a disarming, regular-guy passion to his treatise,
invoking many of his '60s and '70s rock heroes along the way: John
Lennon circa "Imagine" (the wistful "Like a Diamond" ), "Sticky
Fingers"-era Stones (the moody "Blue Sunday"), the Kinks (the jaunty
"The Man Who Loves Women"), Pink Floyd (the expansive "When a Kid
Goes Bad") and Bob Dylan (the benedictory "Have Love Will Travel").</TE>
<TE>   It makes for a heartfelt pastiche that feels like Petty's answer
to such recent rock-rooted movies as "High Fidelity" and "Almost
Famous." It even has a happy ending, closing with the resounding
"Can't Stop the Sun." Petty and the Heartbreakers launch a U.S. tour
with shows being televised live to theaters on Oct. 15 and 16 from
the Grand Olympic Auditorium.</TE>
<TE>   --Randy Lewis</TE>
<TE>   ***</TE>
<TE>   SINEAD O'CONNOR</TE>
<TE>   "Sean-Nos Nua"</TE>
<TE>   Vanguard</TE>
<TE>   There's something about the innocence and purity of traditional
music that can make it feel especially cleansing--as the response to
the Buena Vista Social Club and the "O Brother, Where Art Thou?"
album have underscored in recent years. In this collection of songs
from her childhood in Ireland (in stores Tuesday), O'Connor achieves
some of the same pristine beauty of those mini-sensations.</TE>
<TE>   In gingerly updating the traditional sound, O'Connor is joined on
the album by several of Ireland's most respected contemporary folk
musicians, including the Waterboys' Steve Wickham on fiddle and
Kieran Kiely on whistle. Mostly, though, it's O'Connor's voice--as
lovely and soulful as ever--that stands out, with an authority and
viewpoint that can make you lose track of everything else on the
album.</TE>
<TE>   O'Connor put aside her own songwriting once before, in the 1992
collection of pop standards "Am I Not Your Girl," but these 13 songs
(all but two in English) feel more focused and heartfelt.</TE>
<TE>   Given the singer's history of outspokenness, it's not surprising
that some of the songs deal with politics, from the antiwar
sentiments of "Paddy's Lament" to the social-class examination of
"Molly Malone." But the best of her vocals and arrangements convey a
humanity and warmth that transcend genres or labels.</TE>
<TE>   --Robert Hilburn</TE>
<TE>   In Brief</TE>
<TE>   ** 1/2 Xzibit, "Man Vs Machine," Loud/Columbia. Xzibit's Snoop
Dogg and Dr. Dre affiliations garnered the once-lauded underground
rapper heaps of mainstream attention in 1999 and 2000. With his
fourth album, the Los Angeles-based wordsmith continues his
metamorphosis from underground rhymer to mainstream gangster rapper.
His hard-core wordplay isn't as clever as it once was, but his menace
quotient has increased exponentially. The brutal beats from Dre and
others add muscle, but Xzibit tries too hard to convince you of his
legitimacy.</TE>
<TE>   --Soren Baker</TE>
<TE>   *** The Black Heart Procession, "Amore del Tropico," Touch and Go.
Playful dread from San Diego's alchemists of dark, baroque pop,
locating the sound of Leonard Cohen hosting an Addams Family
marathon. The 56 minutes of early-morning ambience, Old World
eccentricity and occasional tropicalia in "Amore" (due Tuesday) offer
real drama, not melodrama, in mostly acoustic grooves. There's a
western swagger (and a fine saw solo) in "Why I Stay" and a touch of
romance within the cryptic waltzing piano of "The Invitation."
Taunting, haunting, creepy, kooky. The group plays Saturday at the
Knitting Factory Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   --Steve Appleford</TE>
<TE>   *** 1/2 Mr. Airplane Man, "Moanin'," Sympathy for the Record
Industry. It's easy to understand why Morphine frontman Mark Sandman
stopped to listen when he heard them on a Boston sidewalk in 1998.
The two young women were playing white-hot, punk-inflected,
juke-joint blues as if they meant it, and they were doing it with
nothing but a guitar and drums, wrenching every bit of soul and sound
from their instru- ments. Staying that course on its second record,
Mr. Airplane Man shows that it deserves a top spot on the list of
current rock revivalists.</TE>
<TE>   --Susan Carpenter</TE>
<TE>   *** Yumuri, "Tiene Bilongo," Ahi-Nama. The career of this Cuban
singer-songwriter dates back two decades to his stint with the
seminal Afro-Cuban band of Elio Reve. This is the first album
released domestically by this excellent but overlooked sonero, born
Moises Valle and brother of better-known bandleader Orlando "Maraca"
Valle. The 11 well-chosen songs offer solid, unpretentious salsa by
Yumuri's accomplished band, enriched by a tasty horn section,
charanga-style strings and guest solos by Maraca on flute and Pancho
Amat on tres. Couched in the cool grooves and intriguing textures are
Yumuri's warm and expert vocals.</TE>
<TE>   --Agustin Gurza</TE>
<TE>   *** Porcupine Tree, "In Absentia," Lava/Atlantic. The British
quartet's seventh album (due Tuesday) is a prog-rock lover's delight,
replacing the much maligned genre's occasional clunkiness with tight,
post-grunge riffs ("Blackest Eyes") and tasty choruses you can
actually hum ("The Sound of Muzak"). As much as the ethereal "Lips of
Ashes" re-creates the autumnal vibe of Genesis circa 1976, Porcupine
Tree avoids getting stuck in the past by incorporating hints of
electronica in its lean, emotional sound.</TE>

<HD>Within A Noise Within</HD>
<DH>As three productions are mounted simultaneously, running
the classical theater company is no easy task</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DON SHIRLEY</AU>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A former Masonic Temple, built in 1929, looms nine stories over the
east side of Glendale's Brand Boulevard, its bone-colored walls
somewhat forbidding. It's at the southern end of a busy shopping
street--but looking at it, you know you're not at Mervyn's anymore.</LD>
<LD>   Yet the apparent fortress is hardly as grim as it appears. It's
the home of A Noise Within, "California's classical theatre
company"--or so says a big sign out front, a valiant attempt to
mitigate the austere architecture.</LD>
<LD>   A few summer-only theater festivals might quibble with the
banner's claim. But if "California's classical theatre company" means
a professional, year-round group that stages a range of nonmusical
classics from Shakespeare to Shepard but nary a new play, most
observers of California theater would endorse the sign's claim.</LD>
<TE>   The often-acclaimed A Noise Within produces fall and spring
seasons of three plays each in repertory--usually with a few actors
who overlap in more than one production. In its 144-seat theater, the
company pays actors higher wages than in any of the 99-seat companies
that do classical theater. It stages a holiday show and tours in the
winter--mostly in California--and runs a classical training program
for teenagers in the summer.</TE>
<TE>   On a recent Sunday, a technical rehearsal of the season-opening
"Macbeth" occupies the third-floor stage, which thrusts sharply out
into the audience. Simultaneously, the season's second show, the 18th
century French comedy "The Triumph of Love," has taken over the
basement rehearsal studio.</TE>
<TE>   Upstairs, most of the theater is dark except the stage. Sitting at
an electronic console in the front row are the stage manager and
lighting designer. Co-director Julia Rodriguez Elliott hovers behind
them, sometimes stopping the action to venture on stage and talk to
an actor.</TE>
<TE>   From out of the darkness comes an occasional remark by her unseen
husband and co-director, Geoff Elliott. He sits first on one side of
the stage, then the other, gauging the look and sound of the play.
"Can we go back and start the dagger scene again?" asks the voice.
"Is that OK?"</TE>
<TE>   "Yes," agrees his co-director.</TE>
<TE>   Later, Geoff Elliott explains that he and his wife disagreed for
two weeks about whether the lights should come up on the silent
witches during Macbeth's dagger scene. "She thought the image was
very powerful; I thought we should focus on the words." When they
disagree, "we talk about it at home," he says. "We don't make a
scene." In this case, "I realized after the lights and costumes were
added that she was right."</TE>
<TE>   Generally, however, "we have very similar tastes." This time
around, with their infant son, Jack, at home, Geoff Elliott took the
more active role in the production's earlier phases in the rehearsal
room. But his wife became more involved when the company moved into
the theater.</TE>
<TE>   He takes a moment to demonstrate how cramped the backstage is. The
passage across the back of the stage is about 2 feet wide. Three
potentially precarious steps connect it to the tiny side of the
stage. Actors who exit the stage down the aisles toward the rear of
the auditorium, he says, often "have to go tearing around the corners
of the lobby and the greenroom to get backstage again for their next
entrance, telling people to get out of the way."</TE>
<TE>   The greenroom is on the other side of the auditorium's south wall.
Inside, actors on sofas alternately chat and doze while awaiting
their next entrance.</TE>
<TE>   Mitchell Edmonds has little time for dozing. He is the only actor
who is in both productions that are being rehearsed, so he shuttles
between floors.</TE>
<TE>   Downstairs at the "Triumph of Love" rehearsal, Edmonds points out
the mirrors on the walls and pillars of the room, which was once a
discotheque. A platform for the DJ still occupies one end of the
room. Just as the darkness upstairs seems right for "Macbeth," the
brightness in this room is eminently suitable for Marivaux's light
comedy about affairs of the heart.</TE>
<TE>   Edmonds, 62, a mainstay of many A Noise Within productions, used
to manage a dance club himself. But his chief source of current
income is residuals from a Fixodent commercial he made nine years
ago. "It has been a real life-saver," he says.</TE>
<TE>   A Noise Within "has kept us sane," he says. Playing three roles in
two plays at once isn't a problem for him. But he quotes a director
for the company who said, "It's not about the work, it's about the
scheduling." That isn't completely true, Edmonds adds. "It's about
the work, or none of us would be here. But there's a lot of
scheduling involved in the work."</TE>
<TE>   The scheduling of the fall season began in January, when the
Elliotts--also the company's artistic directors--invited directors to
discuss possibilities. Although they usually select a Shakespeare
production first as a season anchor, "The Cherry Orchard" got the nod
this time, because director Adrian Giurgea--who directed "The Wild
Duck" for A Noise Within last season--considers "The Cherry Orchard"
to be "the greatest play ever written," Geoff Elliott says. "That
kind of enthusiasm is hard to pass up."</TE>
<TE>   "The Triumph of Love" came next. They had long wanted to stage a
Marivaux play, but it seemed an especially good fit with "Cherry
Orchard" and a Shakespeare tragedy because of its lighter tone and
smaller cast--a financial consideration. Picking a translation proved
the hard part; rights weren't available for their first choice.
However, they also liked a translation by James Magruder and got the
rights. After interviewing five candidates in May, they chose Anne
D'Zmura as the director because of her credentials and availability.</TE>
<TE>   The Shakespeare slot was programmed last. The original selection
of "Othello" fell through in the late spring after the actor who was
to play the title role withdrew because of family responsibilities.</TE>
<TE>   "Macbeth" had been on the Elliotts' minds for years. They wanted
to direct it themselves; they had never co-directed a Shakespeare
play. "You do a spiritual check of yourself to see if your particular
universe is willing to take it on," Geoff Elliott says.</TE>
<TE>   Not only is the play deeply dark, but it also comes with a famous
curse. Superstitious theater artists avoid saying the name of the
play inside the theater, referring to "the Scottish play" instead. If
someone slips, an elaborate exorcising ritual is prescribed.</TE>
<TE>   This year, however, Geoff Elliott felt a sense of equilibrium had
returned to the company after a turbulent time in 1999-2000, when A
Noise Within spent an ill-fated year at Luckman Theatre at Cal State
L.A. Now ensconced back in Glendale, Elliott felt that his company
could weather any manifestation of the curse.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, "I've never been big on the curse," Julia Rodriguez
Elliott says. "I didn't go in with trepidation. I was intrigued by
the love story. It's more about the dissolution of a marriage than
just these two evil titans wreaking havoc."</TE>
<TE>   One of the company's board members pledged a gift of $10,000 if
"Macbeth," Shakespeare's shortest play, had a running time of less
than two hours, the Elliotts say. They didn't quite manage that, "but
we're trying to find out when he'll be here and make a few judicious
cuts that night," Rodriguez Elliott jokes.</TE>
<TE>   Three days later, the cast of "The Cherry Orchard" gathers with
director Giurgea for its second reading of the script in a
first-floor room, just off the main entrance of the building.</TE>
<TE>   Giurgea is a burly man with a shaved head and a Romanian accent.
Most of the actors sit at long tables arranged in a rectangular
pattern. But one of them, Stephen Rockwell, is taking care of his
remarkably serene 4-month-old son, Ethan, so he sits farther back to
tend the baby in the stroller without distracting his colleagues.</TE>
<TE>   Rockwell himself isn't distracted. Before the actors begin
reading, they fall into a discussion of those Chekhovian moments in
which a character suddenly makes a serious observation in the midst
of more mundane chatter--and Rockwell recalls a similar incident from
the preceding day. Fellow cast member (in "Macbeth" and "Cherry
Orchard") Robertson Dean had suddenly observed that his mother died
five years ago. Rockwell remembered his colleague's mother's death,
because he had covered for Dean at the theater. Dean's remark seemed
very Chekhovian.</TE>
<TE>   "It doesn't strike me as strange," says Ann Marie Lee, another A
Noise Within veteran. "This is what you'd say in a family, and we've
been together so long, it's a family."</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes siblings in a family compete for attention, and this is
also the case at A Noise Within. The Elliotts and the directors of
each production collaborate on picking designers and the cast, and
the Elliotts ask the 26 "resident artists"--a formal affiliation that
entails some behind-the-scenes duties--if any assignments in the
coming season are of special interest, hoping to place them first.
Next they turn to other artists with whom they have previously
worked. Then, if there are still acting spots to fill, they hold
auditions. For this season, there were two summertime audition
sessions for each play, and a total of 11 roles were filled from
them.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes company members aggressively lobby for parts," Geoff
Elliott says, "sometimes to great effect." This season, "we got a
call from an actor who said he had an epiphany and knew how to play
role X." They were convinced by his explanation and switched their
original plan, which had not yet been announced.</TE>
<TE>   However, "there always is some disappointment," Julia Rodriguez
Elliott says. "But company members have so many opportunities here,
it works out."</TE>
<TE>   "Or we ignore it," Geoff chimes in. "Ha, ha."</TE>
<TE>   Two days later, "Cherry Orchard" director Giurgea is in an
automobile accident on a nearby freeway, the aftermath of which is
witnessed by a member of his cast, Maria Bergman. He isn't seriously
injured, but he is taken to the hospital with a gash in his forehead.
It was so bloody, he later tells the Elliotts, that Bergman, at the
scene of the accident, was "screaming like a Russian woman"--which
not only fits her character in the play but also applies to Bergman
herself, who grew up in Russia. The rehearsal is canceled. The first
preview of "Macbeth" goes on that evening.</TE>
<TE>   In "Macbeth," Jill Hill must make a quick costume change from her
role as a witch to her role as a pregnant Lady Macduff. The next
night, during the second preview, she inadvertently puts on her
"pregnancy pad" backward and plays "with a big hump on her rear end,"
in the words of Geoff Elliott.</TE>
<TE>   The following day, near the end of a "Macbeth" rehearsal, the cast
is told to insert a fierce roar into the scene in which Macbeth's
severed head is displayed. A few hours later, during the preview,
Thomas Anawalt, a 16-year-old who's playing young Fleance, is the
only actor who remembers to roar.</TE>
<TE>   "While I was doing it, I realized nobody else was with me,"
Anawalt later says. "The audience laughed. But since Macbeth killed
my character's father, I thought it was right for me to do it."</TE>
<TE>   Some of the other actors who weren't looking at Anawalt when he
roared suspected that perhaps the noise came from a member of the
audience who was disgusted at the sight of the bloody head.</TE>
<TE>   Opening weekend of "Macbeth." The Friday performance goes well and
is followed by a party. The Elliotts return home at 2 a.m., only to
be awakened at 4:30 a.m. by the coughing of their dog Rosie, who has
taken ill and dies. "It's been a rough day," Julia Rodriguez Elliott
says on Saturday night.</TE>
<TE>   The Friday and Saturday performances are preceded by a pep talk to
the audience from Todd Dellinger, A Noise Within's first managing
director. He began his job the previous week but is already talking
about how "one of my missions is to help the theater secure a plot of
land and build a proper theater."</TE>
<TE>   Audience members may wonder what's so "improper." On Saturday
night, Dellinger begins to tell them. The building was never designed
as a theater. After tonight's performance, he says, "the stage is
going to move away for another show--and guess who's going to do it?
The actors."</TE>
<TE>   Sure enough, after the Saturday performance ends, the theater is
briefly empty while the actors change. Then stage manager Dana
Vasquez-Eberhardt emerges to start scrubbing "blood" stains off the
stage. A few minutes later, most of the male actors begin to drift
back into the theater to help dismantle the "Macbeth" set, so the set
for "Triumph of Love" will be ready for a technical rehearsal on
Sunday morning.</TE>
<TE>   With no storage space backstage, the set pieces are hauled by the
actors, interns and a handful of crew members into storage areas on
one side of the theater space and in the prop room across the lobby.
Meanwhile, other actors put away the "Macbeth" costumes and props
elsewhere in the building.</TE>
<TE>   Julia Rodriguez Elliott watches some actors drape the backdrop
curtain for "Macbeth" over the seating area before folding it for
storage. "Hanging lights here is a nightmare," she says. "There is no
grid. You have to move those seats and use ladders.</TE>
<TE>   "Right about now, we usually ask ourselves why we do repertory,"
she adds. "The final product is great in the sense of intimacy. But
it's just a killer to put it together."</TE>

<HD>Siqueiros' 'America Tropical': A Tangled Tale of
Conservation</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Suzanne Muchnic</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>David Alfaro Siqueiros' other extant mural in Southern California,
"America Tropical," also painted in 1932, has a long preservation
tale of its own. Like "Portrait of Mexico Today, 1932" it too has
been hidden from view for most of its life, but not because it was
created on private property.</LD>
<LD>   The problem began with the image on the 18-foot-by-80-foot mural:
a crucified Indian peon with an American eagle perched on top of the
cross. Predictably, local authorities were outraged by what they
interpreted as an indictment of U.S. economic imperialism. Only a
small portion of the artwork was visible from Olvera Street because
the mural was painted on a second-floor wall, facing a rooftop beer
garden. But what could be seen from the street was promptly
whitewashed. The rest disappeared under a coat of paint two years
later.</LD>
<LD>   In 1969, a drive to uncover "America Tropical" got underway, but
its proponents didn't have enough money or political clout to achieve
their goal. That changed in 1987, when the Getty Conservation
Institute joined forces with El Pueblo de Los Angeles Historical
Monument, the city department that administers the historic site.
Plans developed for a $4.5-million project funded by the J. Paul
Getty Trust, the city, the National Endowment for the Arts, local
foundations and in-kind contributions.</LD>
<TE>   The goal was to clean, stabilize and document the badly faded
mural--and in keeping with current conservation philosophies, to
conserve what was left of the painting rather than try to restore it
to what it might have looked like in 1932. The project also included
funds to create an interpretive center to tell the mural's story, and
to build a viewing platform on the second-floor roof where the beer
garden once operated.</TE>
<TE>   Completion of the project has been forecast every year or so since
1990, but bureaucratic tangles, changes of personnel, a multilayered
approval process and technical problems have caused repeated delays.
At this point, most of the conservation is done and designs for new
structures are complete, but construction has yet to begin.</TE>
<TE>   The next step is a meeting on Tuesday, when the mural project team
will request final approval of the viewing platform, shelter and
interpretive center from the eight-member El Pueblo Commission. A
building permit is also pending.</TE>
<TE>   "We hope to obtain a final go-ahead from the commission," says Tim
Whalen, director of the Getty Conservation Institute. Whalen won't
venture a guess as to when the project might actually be finished,
but he offers a provisional time frame: "Once all the approvals are
received, including the building permit, we expect the work to take
about 12 months."</TE>

<LD>A new work of architecture has just gone up on Wilshire Boulevard in
front of the Page Museum. Strategically built to keep its interior
cool, the work is an impressive example of functional design,
especially when you consider who the architects are: termites.</LD>
<LD>   Through decades upon decades of mixing saliva with dirt, and
sometimes with dung, termites in Africa can create mounds up to 20
feet, larger in relative size than anything human beings have ever
built, explains Steve Tobin, the artist who thought to bronze the
mound and bring it to this busy traffic corridor.</LD>
<LD>   "Termite hills are the apex of natural shelters," says Tobin, 45,
who came across the mounds during a 1994 trip to Ghana, in West
Africa. "We don't have the power of this form and this kind of
powerful nature in our cities," he says. "I wanted to bring that
back, to compare our architecture with the power of insect
architecture."</LD>
<TE>   For a full year, the Natural History Museum and its sister, the
Page Museum, will offer us that chance, with "Tobin's Naked Earth:
Nature as Sculpture." Situated on the grounds of both museums, the
exhibition includes the artist's sizable bronzes cast from animal
bones, towering tree roots and samples from a forest floor as well as
12 more termite mounds--which, with their authentic core, are meant
to complement the information inside the museums.</TE>
<TE>   "Tobin's work is really at the intersection of art and science,"
says Jim Gilson, administrator for the Page Museum. "These are
dramatic pieces, and their technical quality and aesthetic beauty are
the first things people will notice. But then they may go from there
to 'Look how complex our world is and where is my place in that?'
That will lead them into the Page Museum, where there is a whole lot
more on that story."</TE>
<TE>   "Naked Earth" is the museums' first shared exhibition and their
largest art exhibition to date. Under the new leadership of Jane
Pisano, executive director since September 2001, the museums are
attempting "new ways to interact with new audiences and new ways to
tell our existing audience about the world they live in," Gilson
says. The show is sponsored by Barbara Lazaroff, who met Tobin
several years ago when he approached her and husband Wolfgang Puck
about creating a house of bronze pizzas. Though that project never
materialized, Lazaroff kept in touch with Tobin, visiting his studio
outside Philadelphia at one point, and jumped at the chance to bring
his work to L.A.</TE>
<TE>   "Art, at its very least, should create a response," says Lazaroff,
who won't disclose the exact amount of her financial contribution to
the exhibition. "With Steve's art, it's not so much shock as it is a
wow factor, and then you get further fascinated when you begin to
notice the intricate detail." Lazaroff is currently showcasing some
of Tobin's smaller pieces, bronzed high heels teeming with exotic
vegetables, at Spago Beverly Hills.</TE>
<TE>   Ask Tobin about his artistic inspiration, and he's instantly back
in his childhood backyard outside Philadelphia, up in his tree house.</TE>
<TE>   "I spent my time in the woods and played with bugs, and got my
nourishment from there," he says. "So I really am making work
consistent with who I am, and I can't imagine any scenario that would
take me away from that."</TE>
<TE>   Although a math major at Tulane in the late 1970s, Tobin spent as
much time as he could in the university's art studio, experimenting
with clay and glass and helping build Tulane's first glass furnace.
In 1979, his senior year, Tobin had his first solo show, at a New
Orleans gallery.</TE>
<TE>   Always true to his analytical background, he creates his pieces
through a process reminiscent of the scientific method. He observes
and in his own way takes detailed notes. For his termite pieces, he
spent six weeks in Ghana making molds directly from more than a dozen
abandoned mounds, to show a variety of the insects' building
techniques.</TE>
<TE>   His latest series takes him out of the field and into his studio,
which also serves as his foundry and laboratory of sorts. The pieces,
which he calls "exploded clay," represent a 3 1/2-year attempt to
"capture an explosion and the movements from order to chaos."</TE>
<TE>   "I've probably made around 10,000 exploded clay pieces--I call
them experiments--to develop the visual language of the piece," he
says.</TE>
<TE>   Beginning with either a cube or a cylinder of clay, Tobin textures
the outside with sweepings from the floor of his studio, such as
bronze or glass dust, then puts fireworks inside the clay and sets
them off. After the explosion opens up the piece, he dries it for
four months and fires it for a month. The cobalt and copper from the
fireworks become embedded in the surface of the clay, so colors
emerge that trace the explosion.</TE>
<TE>   Tobin started small, with clay pieces that were just a few inches
across. As he and his crew of 10 assistants have mastered the
technique, however, the works have grown larger. He has installed
some pieces in the fountain of the Natural History Museum that are 7
feet across and weigh about 1 ton.</TE>
<TE>   During his experiments, Tobin asked Brian Greene, a physics
professor at Columbia, to visit him at his studio. "We spent the day
exploding clay and talking about how these were related to the big
bang and galaxies. The formation of the universe was created with an
explosion. That was the ultimate creative event.</TE>
<TE>   "The inside of these is the event horizon of the 'universe' we've
created. We can read the event horizon because it's embedded in the
exploded clay," he says. "So it really is related to scientific
process."</TE>
<TE>   It's also related to one of Tobin's central themes, to reveal the
unseen or undervalued complexity of nature. For his signature piece,
"Roots," at the Page Museum, Tobin excavated a tree root and made a
sculpture 12 feet high and 15 feet in diameter.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't always travel with our minds where we can't visually
see," he says. "By putting the roots above ground and transforming
them into bronze so they will last, it's like shining a light into
the shadows."</TE>
<TE>   Likewise, in his "Forest Floor" bronzes, he brings the leaves, the
pinecones, the debris from under our feet and turns it on end,
shaping them like doors through which we can "pass back into the
Earth."</TE>
<TE>   "I have to have a thesis for everything I do," he says. But Tobin
also embraces the importance of the wow factor that Lazaroff refers
to--making objects that can have an impact, even from a car passing
along Wilshire Boulevard.</TE>
<TE>   "If I can catch the viewer off guard with my presentation, the
effect of the work may enter the subconscious before reason dissects
it," he writes in "Reconstructions," a book about his work. "For that
fraction of a second the unreal becomes real. Once this door is
opened it can never be closed."</TE>

<DL>BAGRAM, Afghanistan</DL>
<LD>Shots were fired at a U.S. helicopter in Afghanistan, wounding a
crewman in the foot, the military said Saturday. The helicopter
returned fire, killing one enemy fighter and wounding another.</LD>
<LD>   The wounded American was taken to a U.S. base in the southern city
of Kandahar and was in stable condition after Friday night's
shooting, said Col. Roger King, a U.S. military spokesman. He did not
identify the crewman but said it was not the helicopter pilot or
co-pilot.</LD>
<LD>   The special operations helicopter, a twin-rotor MH-47 Chinook, was
hit by small-arms fire northwest of Kandahar, King said. The aircraft
was damaged slightly but was able to return to Kandahar.</LD>
<TE>   King would not detail the helicopter's mission.</TE>
<TE>   At Bagram air base, the United States' military headquarters in
Afghanistan, a U.S. helicopter brought a 10-year-old Afghan girl for
medical treatment Friday night after she was injured by a land mine
near Asadabad. It also picked up an Afghan militia soldier suffering
complications from an amputation. Both were in stable condition, King
said.</TE>
<TE>   An Afghan military commander said Saturday that fighting between
rival warlords in the western part of the country has killed at least
six people, including three children, and injured more than 20
others.</TE>
<TE>   Ethnic Tajik forces loyal to Ismail Khan, governor of Herat
province, clashed with forces loyal to Pushtun commander Amanullah
Khan for four days in Zer-i-Koh district, about 15 miles south of
Shindand air base, said Haji Mohammed, a deputy commander loyal to
Amanullah Khan.</TE>
<TE>   The fighting, which ended Friday, began after the Pushtun leader's
forces refused to hand over to Ismail Khan an Iranian citizen they
had arrested in the area, Mohammed said.</TE>
<TE>   The Iranian was detained after being questioned by Amanullah
Khan's forces and reportedly told them that he was Afghan. The man,
who was wearing Afghan clothes and had no weapons, was sent to
Kandahar and later handed over to American forces there, Mohammed
said.</TE>
<TE>   Ismail Khan's militiamen launched an offensive with rocket and
artillery fire. Two women, three children and a young man were
killed, Mohammed said. Twenty civilians also reportedly were wounded,
as were several of Amanullah Khan's fighters.</TE>

<HD>Soaring Crime Keeps Night Owls of Buenos Aires In After
Dark</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>VANESSA PETIT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BUENOS AIRES</DL>
<LD>Tony Lauria runs a custom vault business called The Inviolable One.
He helps people take care of their money, a growing concern here in
Argentina, where people keep an estimated $28 billion hidden in walls
and mattresses.</LD>
<LD>   "People are desperate," said Lauria, whose business has jumped 50%
in the wake of a crime wave and the collapse of the country's banking
system late last year. "They don't know where to hide the little
money that they have left."</LD>
<LD>   Lauria's safes are hidden in places where the armies of burglars
and kidnappers who roam this city will have a hard time finding them.
"We are building them in the floors, under countertops, in backyards
under trees, in bathrooms," he said.</LD>
<TE>   Once known as one of Latin America's safest big cities, Buenos
Aires has suddenly become one of its most violent. The lawlessness
has been a boon to security outfits, but it has also forced changes
among a people famous for being flashy night owls.</TE>
<TE>   Portenos, as residents of Buenos Aires are known, are suddenly
less ostentatious. Until recently, most never worried about going
anywhere at any time of the day or night. Restaurants began serving
dinner at 9 p.m.; bar-hopping began at 2 a.m. Teenagers often would
not return home until the next morning, and many young adults would
go to work without sleeping at all.</TE>
<TE>   But now, safety is an issue that Argentines dwell on. People think
twice about where to go and how to get there. And it's not a question
of avoiding certain places--crime is everywhere.</TE>
<TE>   A few years ago when the economy was booming, Luis Paul, a
pediatrician, decided to sell his city apartment, buy a house in the
suburbs and commute to work.</TE>
<TE>   Now he regrets the move. Sometimes he has to drive through
"liberated zones" where corrupt police allow criminals free reign.</TE>
<TE>   In the suburbs, he has discovered, "it's easier for robbers to
just disappear into thin air. Once we get home, we rarely go out."</TE>
<TE>   Since the end of last year, crime has skyrocketed and kidnappings
have become a nationwide phenomenon. Federal police officials
estimate that one person is abducted every 36 hours, five times the
rate of last year. Most are held for ransom.</TE>
<TE>   Businesspeople who bought expensive imported cars in the boom
years of the early 1990s are being urged to sell them or keep them in
garages until crime diminishes; drivers of luxury cars are prime
kidnapping targets.</TE>
<TE>   "I stopped using my 1999 Nissan Pathfinder and bought a beat-up
1980 Ford," Matias Marquez, 41, said. "I fear for my life and for my
family. I'd rather have a lower profile. Melt in, go by unnoticed."</TE>
<TE>   The capital's woes are on display on its streets. There are more
homeless, more children begging.</TE>
<TE>   "I've never felt so unprotected against crime than now," said
Marina Calcanio, a 30-year-old waitress in Palermo Hollywood, an
upscale neighborhood where century-old homes have been converted into
restaurants. "We've been robbed at gunpoint. I always carry money
with me, just in case I get mugged. It's to please the robbers."</TE>
<TE>   Not far away, along the Rio de la Plata, the crime wave has forced
a nightclub catering to teenagers to take new measures to keep their
young customers.</TE>
<TE>   Teens who used to come to the Pacha club by bus were staying away
in droves, afraid to be out on the streets so late. But they didn't
like their parents driving them either. "It was too embarrassing,"
employee Claudio Suarez said.</TE>
<TE>   So the club came up with a solution: a shuttle service that runs
back and forth from the club to nearby plazas, where parents can pick
up their children until 1 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   At airports and hotels, visitors are alerted about the growing
crime. Anita Maria Correa, a Chilean tourist, said she was warned in
her hotel about cabs, because many tourists and even locals have been
assaulted in pirate taxis.</TE>
<TE>   "We're a little scared and haven't ventured off too far away from
the hotel," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Rosa and Nestor Romera, who have owned a drugstore on one of this
city's busiest avenues for 30 years, had never given their safety a
second thought--until now. Since the beginning of the year, about 300
business owners have been killed in assaults in greater Buenos Aires.
An additional 500 have been wounded.</TE>
<TE>   "Sure there was crime before, but never like this," Nestor Romera
said. "We are prisoners in this godforsaken city."</TE>
<TE>   The Romeras have invested in a state-of-the-art alarm system and
security bars. On weekends, their son brings his German shepherd to
scare off thugs.</TE>
<TE>   "When we compared ourselves with other South American cities, we
used to think we lived in a sort of paradise," Rosa Romera said.
"Now, we are no different from Brazil, Venezuela or Colombia."</TE>
<TE>   Last month, the government eased restrictions it had placed on
banks in the wake of last year's crash. Many people withdrew their
money and brought it home.</TE>
<TE>   "My business is about that," said Lauria, the vault maker.
"Finding ways of hiding money or jewelry in places that are invisible
to criminals."</TE>

republic, which is on the verge of entering the European Union and
NATO.</LD>
<LD>   With about 96% of the vote tallied, New Era had 23.5% support,
according to Latvia's Central Election Commission. The party, founded
less than a year ago by a former central bank chief, had campaigned
on an anti-corruption platform.</LD>
<LD>   Of the 19 other parties competing, For Human Rights in a United
Latvia was second with 18.8%. The center-right People's Party, part
of the governing coalition, was third with 16.6%, results showed.</LD>

<LD>Rwanda withdrew its last troops from neighboring Congo, with about
1,100 soldiers marching single file out of the country, Rwandan Maj.
Gen. James Kabarebe said.</LD>
<LD>   Thousands of civilians lined the roads and a helicopter gunship
flew overhead as the troops, who were deployed in the border town of
Goma and surrounding areas, walked the few miles from a sports
stadium to Gisenyi, Rwanda.</LD>
<LD>   The withdrawal was approved under a July 30 peace deal aimed at
ending Congo's four-year war. Congolese President Joseph Kabila
pledged to disarm and repatriate Rwandan rebels who fled to Congo
after carrying out a 1994 genocide in Rwanda.</LD>

<LD>China has placed Yang Bin, the controversial governor of North
Korea's fledgling economic zone, under house arrest in Shenyang after
releasing him from detention, South Korea's Yonhap news agency
reported.</LD>
<LD>   The agency also quoted Chinese sources as saying China had sent a
vice minister-level official to North Korea to explain the
Chinese-born Dutch citizen's detention.</LD>
<LD>   Yonhap quoted a Chinese source as saying Yang was unlikely to be
allowed out of Shenyang anytime soon. Chinese police bundled away the
chief executive of the new Sinuiju special administrative region
Friday, fueling speculation that he had been picked up for failing to
pay taxes.</LD>

<SE>ENRIQUE'S JOURNEY</SE>
<AU>SONIA NAZARIO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"You are in American territory," a Border Patrol agent shouts into a
bullhorn. "Turn back."</LD>
<LD>   Sometimes Enrique strips and wades into the Rio Grande to cool
off. But the bullhorn always stops him. He goes back.</LD>
<LD>   "Thank you for returning to your country."</LD>
<TE>   He is stymied. For days, Enrique, 17, has been stuck in Nuevo
Laredo, on the southern bank of the Rio Bravo, as it is called here.
He has been watching, listening and trying to plan. Somewhere across
this milky green ribbon of water is his mother.</TE>
<TE>   She left him behind 11 years ago in Tegucigalpa, Honduras, to seek
work in the United States. Enrique is challenging the unknown to find
her. During her most recent telephone call, she said she was in North
Carolina. He has no idea if she is still there, where that is or how
to reach it. He no longer has her phone number.</TE>
<TE>   He had written it on a scrap of paper, but it blew away while he
was being robbed and beaten almost four weeks ago while riding on top
of a freight train in southern Mexico. He did not think to memorize
it.</TE>
<TE>   Of the estimated 48,000 youngsters from Central America and Mexico
who go north illegally on their own every year, many do not memorize
telephone numbers or addresses. They wrap them in plastic and tuck
them into a shoe or slip them under a waistband. Some of the numbers
are lost, others are stolen. Occasionally kidnappers snatch the
children themselves, find the numbers and call the mothers for
ransom.</TE>
<TE>   Stripped of phone numbers and destinations, many of the children
become stranded at the river. Defeat drives them to the worst this
border world has to offer: drugs, despair and death.</TE>
<TE>   It is almost May 2000, nearly two months since Enrique left home
the last time. He is a hardened veteran of seven attempts to reach El
Norte. This is his eighth. By now, his mother must have called
Honduras again, and the family must have told her that he was gone.
His mother must be worrying.</TE>
<TE>   He has to telephone her.</TE>
<TE>   Besides, she might have saved enough money to hire a smuggler, or
coyote, who can take him across the river.</TE>
<TE>   He remembers one number back home--at a tire store where
he worked. He will call and ask his old employer to find Aunt Rosa
Amalia or Uncle Carlos Orlando Turcios Ramos, who had arranged his
job, and ask them for his mother's number. Then he will call back and
get it from his boss.</TE>
<TE>   For the two calls, he needs two telephone cards: Fifty pesos
apiece. When he phones his mother, he'll call collect.</TE>
<TE>   He cannot beg 100 pesos. People in Nuevo Laredo won't give.
Mexicans along the border, he notices, are quick to proclaim their
right to immigrate to the United States. "Jesus was an immigrant," he
hears them say. But most won't give Central Americans food, money or
jobs.</TE>
<TE>   So he will work by himself. He'll wash cars.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A REFUGE</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The encampment he has joined is a haven for migrants, coyotes,
junkies and criminals, but it is safer for him than anywhere else in
Nuevo Laredo, a city of half a million and swarming with immigration
agents, or la migra, and all kinds of police, who might catch him and
deport him.</TE>
<TE>   The camp is at the bottom of a narrow, winding path that slopes to
the river. Each evening, without fail, he summons his courage and
goes to the Nuevo Laredo city hall with a large plastic paint bucket
and two rags. From a spigot on the side of the building, he fills the
bucket. Then he goes to parking places across the street from a
bustling taco stand. One of his rags is red. Each time someone
arrives to eat dinner, he waves the red rag to guide the customer
into a parking space, like a ground crew ushering a jetliner to a
gate.</TE>
<TE>   Usually there is competition. Two or three others immigrants set
up their buckets along the same sidewalk.</TE>
<TE>   Enrique approaches a woman driving a yellow Chevrolet Impala with
chrome-spoke wheels. She is talking on her cell phone. May he wash
her car?</TE>
<TE>   She ends the call and declines.</TE>
<TE>   A man and his young daughter drive up.</TE>
<TE>   "May I clean your car?"</TE>
<TE>   "No, son."</TE>
<TE>   The woman with the Impala returns with her tacos. Enrique waits
until traffic is clear, then waves his red rag and guides her out.</TE>
<TE>   Suddenly, she reaches out her car window and presses 3 pesos into
his hand.</TE>
<TE>   Enrique approaches dozens of people, but just one or two say yes.
By 4 a.m., when the stand closes, he has eked out 30 pesos, or $3.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A LIFELINE</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The air around the taco stand fills with the aroma of barbecue.
Enrique watches workers pull strips of meat from a vat, put them on
large chopping blocks and cut them up. Customers sit at long
stainless steel tables and eat. Sometimes, when the stand closes, the
servers slip him a couple of tacos.</TE>
<TE>   Otherwise, for his only meal every day, he depends upon
Parroquia de San Jose, or St. Joseph's Parish, and another church,
Parroquia del Santo Nino, the Parish of the Holy Child. Each gives food
cards to migrants. One is good for 10 meals and the other for five.
Enrique can count on one meal a day for 15 days. The cards are like gold.
Sometimes they are stolen and turn up on a meal-card black market.</TE>
<TE>   Each day, Enrique goes to one church or the other to eat. It is
safe; the police stay away. Like clockwork, Leti Limon, a volunteer,
swings open the double yellow doors at San Jose and shouts, "Who's
new?"</TE>
<TE>   "Me! Me!" men and boys cry out from the courtyard.</TE>
<TE>   They rush to the door and jostle against it.</TE>
<TE>   "Get in line! Get in line!" Limon is poor herself; she cleans
houses across the river in Laredo, Texas, for $20 apiece. But she has
helped to feed these immigrants for a year and a half, figuring that
Jesus would approve. She issues the newcomers beige cards and punches
the cards of those who enter. A parish priest counts 6% children.</TE>
<TE>   One by one, the migrants stand behind chairs at a long table. At
the head is a mural of Jesus, his hands extended toward plates of
tacos, tomatoes and beans. Above him are his words: "Come to me, all
you who are weary and find life burdensome."</TE>
<TE>   The lights dim, and two big fans spin to a stop, so everyone can
hear grace. Some who have not eaten in two or three days cannot wait;
from behind their chairs, they grab at the tacos with one hand, bread
with the other.</TE>
<TE>   Chairs screech as everyone pulls them out at once. Spoons of stew
touch lips before bottoms hit the seats. In a clatter of forks
against plates, beans, stew, tomatoes, rice and doughnuts disappear.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A SMUGGLER</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   For permission to stay in the relative safety of the encampment,
the leader, El Tirindaro, who is addicted to heroin, usually wants
drugs or beer. But he has not asked Enrique for anything. El
Tirindaro is a subspecies of coyote known as a patero, because he
smuggles people into the United States by pushing them across the
river on inner tubes while paddling like a pato, or duck. Enrique is
a likely client.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to smuggling, El Tirindaro finances his heroin habit
by tattooing people and selling clothing that immigrants have left on
the riverbank. Enrique stares as El Tirindaro lies on a mattress,
mixes Mexican black tar heroin with water in a spoon, warms it over a
cigarette lighter, draws it into a syringe and stabs the needle
straight into a vein.</TE>
<TE>   Besides migrants, the camp has 10 perpetual residents. Seven are
addicts. They call heroin la cura, or the cure.</TE>
<TE>   Also among the permanent campers are several immigrants who are
stuck. One, a fellow Honduran, has lived on the river for seven
months. He tried to enter the United States three times. Every time,
he was caught. He has descended into depression and a life of glue
sniffing.</TE>
<TE>   Each time he tried to cross, he says, he went alone.</TE>
<TE>   Enrique listens. They call him El Hongo, the mushroom, because he
is quiet, soaking everything in.</TE>
<TE>   Enrique is protected. Because he is so young, everyone at the camp
looks after him. When he goes at night to wash cars, someone walks
him through the brush to the road. They warn him against heroin. But
leaving the camp scares him, and they give him marijuana to calm him
down.</TE>
<TE>   Car washing goes poorly. One night, he earns almost nothing.</TE>
<TE>   The 15 days on his meal cards pass quickly. Now he needs part of
his money to eat. Every peso he spends on food cannot go toward the
phone cards. He begins to eat as little as possible--crackers and
soda.</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes Enrique does not eat at all. Friends at the camp share
their meals. One teaches him to fish with a line coiled on a shampoo
bottle. The line, fitted with a hook, has three spark plugs at the
end to sink it. Enrique swings the spark plugs around his head, then
casts toward the middle of the Rio Grande. The line whirs as it
spools off the bottle. He hauls in three catfish.</TE>
<TE>   Even El Tirindaro is generous; the sooner Enrique can buy a phone
card and call his mother, the sooner Enrique will need his services.
When one of Enrique's meal cards is stolen, El Tirindaro gives him the
unexpired card of a migrant who has crossed the river successfully.  He
knows that Enrique cannot swim, so he paddles him back and forth on the
water in an inner tube to quiet his fears.</TE>
<TE>   Enrique learns that El Tirindaro is part of a smuggling network. A
middle-aged man and a young woman, both Latinos, meet him and his
clients after they cross the river. Then they all drive north
together, and El Tirindaro walks his clients around Border Patrol
checkpoints, giving wide berth to the agents. After the last
checkpoint, El Tirindaro returns to Nuevo Laredo, and the couple and
others in the network deliver the clients to their destinations. The
price is $1,200.</TE>
<TE>   El Hongo listens as his camp mates talk about dos and don'ts: Find
an inner tube. Take along a gallon of water. Learn where to get into
the river, where not. They talk about the poverty they came from;
they would rather die than go back. Enrique tells them about Maria
Isabel, his girlfriend, and that she might be expecting.</TE>
<TE>   Enrique talks about his mother. He says he is extremely depressed.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to be with her," he says, "to know her."</TE>
<TE>   "If you talk, it's better," a friend says.</TE>
<TE>   But it gets worse. Enrique defends a friend against a street
gangster and is spared a beating only by the intervention of another
gangster from his neighborhood back home. Then his luck runs out with
the authorities. He is arrested in town--twice, both times for
loitering. Police call him a street bum and lock him up. In jail, the
toilet runs over, and drunks smear the wall with its contents. Both
times, Enrique wins his release by sweeping and mopping.</TE>
<TE>   One night, as he walks 20 blocks back to the river from washing
cars, it rains. He ducks into an abandoned house, finds some
cardboard and places it on a dry spot. He removes his sneakers and
puts them and his bucket near his head. He has no socks, blanket or
pillow. He pulls his shirt up around his ears and breathes into it to
stay warm. Then he lies down, curls up and tucks his hands across his
chest.</TE>
<TE>   Lightning flashes. Thunder rumbles. Wind wails around the corners
of the house. The rain falls steadily. On the highway, trucks hiss
their brakes, stopping at the border before entering the United
States. Across the river, the Border Patrol shines lights on the
water, looking for immigrants trying to cross.</TE>
<TE>   With his bare feet touching a cold wall, Enrique sleeps.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   MOTHER'S DAY</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   It is May 14, 2000, a Sunday when many churches in Mexico
celebrate Mother's Day.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, Enrique has saved 50 pesos. Eagerly, he buys a phone
card. He gives it to one of El Tirindaro's friends for safekeeping.
That way, if the police catch him again, they cannot steal it.</TE>
<TE>   "I just need one more," he says. "Then I can call her."</TE>
<TE>   Every time he goes to Parroquia de San Jose, it makes him think
about his mother, especially on this Mother's Day. In addition to the
refectory, on the second floor are two small rooms where up to 10
women share four beds. They have left their children behind in
Central America and Mexico to find work in El Norte, and they have
found this place to sleep. Each could be his mother 11 years ago.</TE>
<TE>   They try to ignore a Mother's Day party downstairs, where 150
women from Nuevo Laredo laugh, shout and whistle as their sons dance,
pillows stuffed under their shirts to make them look pregnant.
Upstairs, the women weep. One has a daughter, 8, who had begged her
not to go. She asked her to send back just one thing for her
birthday: a doll that cries. Another cannot shake a nightmare: Back
home, her little girl is killed, and her little boy runs away in
tears. Daily she prays: "Don't let me die on this trip. If I die,
they will live on the street."</TE>
<TE>   Enrique wonders: What does his mother look like now?</TE>
<TE>   "It's OK for a mother to leave," he tells a friend, "but just for
two or four years, not longer." He recalls her promises to return for
Christmas and how she never did. "I've felt alone all my life." One
thing, though: She always told him she loved him. "I don't know what
it will be like to see her. She will be happy. Me too. I want to tell
her how much I love her. I will tell her I need her."</TE>
<TE>   Across the Rio Grande on Mother's Day, his mother, Lourdes, thinks
about Enrique. She has, indeed, learned that he is gone. But in her
phone calls home, she never finds out where he went. She tries to
convince herself that he is living with a friend, but she remembers
their last telephone conversation: "I'll be there soon," he had said.
"Before you know it, on your doorstep." Day after day, she waits for
him to call. Night after night, she cannot sleep more than three
hours. She watches TV: migrants dying in the desert, ranchers who
shoot them.</TE>
<TE>   She imagines the worst and becomes terrified that she might never
see him again. She is utterly helpless. She asks God to watch over
him, guide him.</TE>
<TE>   On the afternoon of the Mother's Day celebration, three municipal
police visit the camp. Enrique does not try to run, but he is
jittery. They ignore him. Instead, they take away one of his friends.</TE>
<TE>   Enrique has no money for food. He takes a hit of glue. It
makes him sleepy, takes him to another world, eases his hunger and
helps him forget about his family.</TE>
<TE>   A friend catches six tiny catfish. He builds a fire out of trash.
It grows dark. He cuts the fish with a lid from an aluminum can.</TE>
<TE>   Enrique hovers nearby. "You know, Hernan, I haven't eaten all
day."</TE>
<TE>   Hernan guts the fish.</TE>
<TE>   Enrique stands silently, waiting.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A SETBACK</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   It is May 15. Enrique washes cars. He has a good night and
makes 60 pesos. At midnight, he rushes to buy his second phone card.
He puts only 30 pesos on it, gambling that his second call will be
short. If his old employer finds Aunt Rosa Amalia and Uncle Carlos
and gets his mother's number, then it won't take many minutes to call
his boss a second time and pick it up.</TE>
<TE>   Enrique saves his other 30 pesos for food.</TE>
<TE>   He and his friends celebrate. Enrique drinks and smokes some
marijuana. He wants a tattoo. "A memory of my journey," he says.</TE>
<TE>   El Tirindaro offers to do it free. He shoots up to steady his
hand.</TE>
<TE>   Enrique wants black ink.</TE>
<TE>   But all El Tirindaro has is green.</TE>
<TE>   Enrique pushes out his chest and asks for two names, so close
together they are almost one. For three hours, El Tirindaro digs into
Enrique's skin. In gothic script, the words emerge:</TE>
<TE>   EnriqueLourdes.</TE>
<TE>   His mom, he thinks happily, will scold him.</TE>
<TE>   The next day just before noon, he stirs from his dirty mattress.
He is hungry. Hours pass. His hunger grows. Finally, he cannot stand
it. He retrieves the first phone card from the friend who is holding
it, and he sells it for food.</TE>
<TE>   Worse, he is so desperate that he sacrifices it at a discount, for
40 pesos. He saves a few pesos for the next day and uses all of his
money to buy crackers, the cheapest thing that will fill his stomach.</TE>
<TE>   Now he has gone from two phone cards to one, worth only 30 pesos.
He regrets surrendering to his hunger. If only he can earn 20 pesos
more. Then he will go ahead and phone his old boss and hope that his
aunt or uncle will call back on their own, so he won't need a second
card.</TE>
<TE>   But someone has stolen his bucket. A friend at camp lends him one.
He trudges back out to the car wash across from the taco stand. He
sits on the bucket. Carefully, he pulls up his T-shirt. There, in an
arch just above his belly button, is his tattoo, painfully raw.</TE>
<TE>   EnriqueLourdes. Now the words mock him.</TE>
<TE>   For the first time, he is ready to go back home. But he holds back
his tears and lowers his shirt.</TE>
<TE>   He refuses to give up.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   THE MOMENT</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   He considers crossing the Rio Grande by himself. But his friends
at camp warn him against it.</TE>
<TE>   They talk about river bandits who kill, a man sucked under by a
whirlpool, dogs at Border Patrol checkpoints that respond to German
and can smell sweat, the 120-degree desert, diamondback rattlers,
saucer-sized tarantulas and wild hogs with tusks. Some immigrants,
dehydrated and delirious, kill themselves. Their leathery corpses
sway from belts around their necks on whatever is sturdy and tall.
Water jugs lie empty at their feet.</TE>
<TE>   El Hongo listens. Finally, he decides against going alone. "Why
should I die doing this?" he asks himself. Somehow, he will call his
mother and ask her to hire El Tirindaro.</TE>
<TE>   On May 18, he awakens to find that someone has stolen his right
shoe. He spots a sneaker floating near the riverbank. He snags it. It
is for a left foot. Now he has two left shoes. Bucket in hand, he
hobbles back to the taco stand, begging along the way. People give
him a peso or two. He washes a few cars, and it starts to rain.
Astonishingly, he has put together 20 pesos in all.</TE>
<TE>   That is enough to trade in his 30-peso phone card for one worth 50
pesos.</TE>
<TE>   He will use the 50 peso card to call his old boss at the tire
store. If the boss reaches his aunt and uncle, and if they know his
mother's number, and if his aunt or uncle will call him back ...</TE>
<TE>   It is May 19. Father Leonardo Lopez Guajardo at Parroquia de San
Jose is known to let migrants phone from the church if they have
cards. Each day, he serves as their telephone assistant. In
flip-flops, he pads to the door every 15 minutes or so and summons
someone for a return call.</TE>
<TE>   In late afternoon, Enrique reaches his old boss with his request.
Two hours later, the padre bellows Enrique's name. As always, word
spreads through the courtyard like wildfire: Someone named Enrique
has a phone call.</TE>
<TE>   "Are you all right?" asks Uncle Carlos.</TE>
<TE>   "Yes, I'm OK. I want to call my mom. I've lost the phone number."</TE>
<TE>   Somehow, his boss has neglected to tell them this. Do they have it
with them? Aunt Rosa Amalia fumbles in her purse. She finds the
number. Uncle Carlos reads it, digit by digit, into the phone.</TE>
<TE>   Ten digits.</TE>
<TE>   Carefully, Enrique writes them down, one after another, on a shred
of paper.</TE>
<TE>   Just as Uncle Carlos finishes, the phone dies.</TE>
<TE>   Uncle Carlos calls again.</TE>
<TE>   But Enrique is already gone. He cannot wait.</TE>
<TE>   When he talks to his mom, he wants to be alone; he might cry. He
runs to an out-of-the-way pay phone to call her. Collect.</TE>
<TE>   He is nervous. Maybe she is sharing a place with unrelated
immigrants, and they have blocked the telephone to collect calls. Or
she might refuse to pay. It has been 11 years. She does not even know
him. She had told him, even harshly, not to come north, but he has
disobeyed her. Each of the few times they have talked, she urged him
to study. This, after all, was why she left--to send money for
school. But he has dropped out of school.</TE>
<TE>   Heart in his throat, he stands on the edge of a small park two
blocks from the camp. Next to the grass is a Telmex phone box on a
pole.</TE>
<TE>   It is 7 p.m. and dangerous. Police patrol the park.</TE>
<TE>   Enrique, a slight youngster with two left shoes, pulls the
shred of paper from his jeans. They are worn and torn; he is too
tattered to be in this neighborhood. He reaches for the receiver. His
T-shirt is blazing white, sure to attract attention.</TE>
<TE>   Slowly, carefully, he unfolds his prized possession: her phone
number.</TE>
<TE>   He listens in wonderment as his mother answers.</TE>
<TE>   She accepts the charges.</TE>
<TE>   "Mami?"</TE>
<TE>   At the other end, Lourdes' hands begin to tremble. Then her arms
and knees. "Hola, mi hijo. Hello, my son. Where are you?"</TE>
<TE>   "I'm in Nuevo Laredo. Adonde estas? Where are you?"</TE>
<TE>   "I was so worried." Her voice breaks, but she forces herself not
to cry, lest she cause him to break down too. "North Carolina." She
explains where that is. Enrique's foreboding eases. "How are you
coming? Get a coyote." She sounds worried. She knows of a good
smuggler in Piedras Negras.</TE>
<TE>   "No, no," he says. "I have someone here." Many smugglers deliver
their clients to bandits. Enrique trusts El Tirindaro, but he costs
$1,200.</TE>
<TE>   She will get the money together. "Be careful," she says. Go to a
hotel. Get the telephone number and the address of Western Union in
Nuevo Laredo. She will wire money for a room.</TE>
<TE>   "No," he says. He is camping by the river. But he will call back
with the Western Union information, so she can send a little money
anyway.</TE>
<TE>   The conversation is awkward. His mother is a stranger. This is
probably expensive; he knows that collect calls to the United States
from back home in Honduras cost several dollars a minute.</TE>
<TE>   But he could feel her love. He places the receiver in its cradle
and sighs.</TE>
<TE>   At the other end, his mother finally cries.</TE>

<DL>BERLIN</DL>
<LD>German authorities searched properties in three cities Saturday in an
investigation of a group of suspected Islamic militants believed to
have been planning attacks in the country, the federal prosecutor's
office said.</LD>
<LD>   Prosecutors said five people, most of them in the eastern city of
Cottbus, were believed to have formed a group "with the aim of
committing attacks" that they hoped would "defend and spread Islamic
values."</LD>
<LD>   The prosecutors gave no information on the identity and background
of the people involved, who are suspected of membership in a
terrorist organization. Prosecutors refused to say whether anyone had
been detained.</LD>
<TE>   Eleven properties were searched Saturday, the federal prosecutor's
office said in a statement. They were in and around Cottbus; in
Gross-Gerau, near Frankfurt; and in Leinfelden-Echterdingen, near the
southwestern city of Stuttgart.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors added that authorities had no information on what kind
of attacks were planned, or on any targets the group had planned to
hit.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier Saturday, the German newsweekly Focus cited as suspected
targets the U.S. air base at Spangdahlem, near the border with
Luxembourg, and a number of Jewish facilities in Berlin and
Frankfurt.</TE>

<HD>A Military That Lacks One Crucial Element: Weapons</HD>
<DH>Afghanistan: The new national army has to make do while
warlords are fully supplied.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID BUCHBINDER</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>KABUL, Afghanistan</DL>
<LD>On a sunny day in September, U.S. special operations troops combing a
complex of mud-and-wattle buildings in eastern Afghanistan surrounded
the compound of a suspected Taliban sympathizer. What they found
inside astounded them: stacks of 107-millimeter rockets, Russian
rocket launchers, Chinese machine guns, nearly 20,000 rounds of
antiaircraft ammunition, even a Panzerfaust, a World War II-era
German antitank weapon.</LD>
<LD>   The massive arms cache filled three "jingle trucks," heavy
transports decorated with intricate grillwork and metal chimes.</LD>
<LD>   The next day, a U.S. military spokesman declared the weapons haul
"off the market" and said most would be destroyed. Guns and ammo
deemed functional would be handed over to the Afghan National Army, a
multiethnic fighting force that is being created with U.S. help to
support democracy in Afghanistan.</LD>
<TE>   The new national army is a key to wresting control of the country
from warlords, and supplying the fledgling force with weapons is an
easy way to help. Records maintained by the U.S. military dating to
last October show that the national army has received confiscated
mortars, antiaircraft machine guns, shoulder-fired rocket launchers
and 1,185 assault rifles--all in good working condition--courtesy of
the American military.</TE>
<TE>   There's just one problem: Hardly any of the weapons have reached
the fledgling force.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, Afghanistan's national army has faced chronic weapons
shortages in a country saturated with 10 million small arms,
according to United Nations estimates. Weapons seized by U.S. forces
and earmarked for the national army find their way into regional
militias instead. And the Afghan Defense Ministry, itself dominated
by a factional army, has been reluctant to open its weapons stocks to
the fledgling force.</TE>
<TE>   Even as the country stumbles toward peace after 23 years of war,
military hardware remains the primary currency of power in
Afghanistan. By that measure, the feckless national army, along with
the civilian authority it represents, is bankrupt, while the warlord
armies are rolling in it.</TE>
<TE>   American troops routinely stumble across arms caches during
exercises in the Afghan countryside; and just as routinely, U.S.
officials announce that the best of the weapons are being turned over
to the national army. However, closer examination reveals that the
usable portions of the arsenals are instead distributed among the
militiamen who are with American soldiers when the weapons are
discovered.</TE>
<TE>   Col. Roger King, a U.S. military spokesman, said that whatever is
left over after local factions are outfitted is handed over to the
national army, but that "not a lot is making it."</TE>
<TE>   According to Martha Brill Olcott, senior associate at the Carnegie
Endowment for International Peace, the United States is hampering the
development of civilian authority by supporting warlords in a bid to
roust Al Qaeda and Taliban remnants.</TE>
<TE>   "One of the problems with dealing with warlords is that they
behave in the way that their name implies," Olcott said. "The
warlords are unlikely to go quietly into the night, especially after
topping up their weapons stores, thanks to the generosity of the war
on terrorism's main supporters."</TE>
<TE>   U.S. forces have been providing support for factional militia
groups since the ground war in Afghanistan began late last year.</TE>
<TE>   "Part of the American game is to play with the local commanders,
give them big money and strengthen their power locally," said one
Western diplomat in Kabul, who requested anonymity because of the
sensitivity of the issue. "For that money, weapons are procured
easily. Those weapons are too often being used not against Al Qaeda
and the Taliban, but against political opponents and enemies."</TE>
<TE>   One of the U.S. military's key allies in Afghanistan has been
Mohammed Qassim Fahim, a top commander of the Northern Alliance, who
became defense minister after the Taliban regime fell. At the same
time that Fahim holds the nation's highest civilian defense
portfolio, he heads a powerful ethnic Tajik militia from the Panjshir
Valley, north of the capital, which dominates the Defense Ministry.</TE>
<TE>   "Fahim is fiercely protective of his power, and he sees [the
national army] as a threat," said Paul Burton, South Asia editor for
Jane's Sentinel, a defense publication. "It's small now, but the
thing to bear in mind, if you follow the [national army] through to
its natural end, is that it entails the end of Fahim's force."</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps because of the conflict between his status as a faction
leader and the more democratic aims of the national army, Fahim has
been reluctant to support it; when the first battalion began training
in April, weapons that were supposed to come from the Defense
Ministry never arrived.</TE>
<TE>   "It was like pulling teeth from a mouth that didn't have any
teeth," said Lt. Col. Kevin McDonnell, commander of the U.S. Special
Forces troops who are helping train the new army. "I had soldiers
literally going out and robbing caves to recover weapons and ammo
because we weren't getting anything" from the Defense Ministry.</TE>
<TE>   With the national army receiving little support from the Afghan
military establishment, Romania donated 1,000 reconditioned
Kalashnikovs to the training academy in April. Since then, other
Eastern European countries have jumped on the arms-donation
bandwagon, with Bulgaria handing over 400 used Kalashnikovs, along
with a batch of new 73-millimeter recoilless rifles. In addition,
Russia, Albania, Slovenia and Hungary have expressed interest in
making contributions, and Ukraine has earmarked nearly 1,000 tons of
guns and ammunition. The national army will be happy to take delivery
of the donations, which are said to range from rifles to helicopters,
but the Defense Ministry is reluctant to release the hardware.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't want to give these new weapons to the national army
because we have enough weapons all over Afghanistan," said Deputy
Defense Minister Atiqullah Barialai, who is in charge of overseeing
the creation of the national army.</TE>
<TE>   Barialai said imports of new weapons will be held in storage
pending a round of general disarmament. Once enough firearms have
been collected, the donated weapons will be distributed to the
national army, he said.</TE>
<TE>   One European ambassador is skeptical that the weapons committed to
the national army will make it into the hands of recruits.</TE>
<TE>   "They will go to the Ministry of Defense, and presumably into
Panjshiri units," the ambassador said.</TE>
<TE>   Because of concerns about where the weapons will end up, some
countries have earmarked donations for the national army training
center only. However, once cadets graduate, they leave their weapons
behind, and it is up to Fahim to outfit the national troops with
combat arms.</TE>
<TE>   Some observers believe that Fahim is warming to the idea of the
national army, in part because of pressure from Western powers and
Afghan President Hamid Karzai to project the air of a national
politician. Fahim has taken to wearing a three-piece suit and has
spoken in favor of the national army in public speeches and private
meetings alike.</TE>
<TE>   "In the beginning, he was opposed to the idea ... but his stated
position has transformed," says a Western intelligence analyst in the
capital, Kabul.</TE>
<TE>   "Did it change because it was something he can manipulate? Or
because he has ambitions beyond his parochial interest in keeping the
military in his corner?"</TE>
<TE>   Compelling Afghanistan's warriors to sign on with civilian rule,
leaving defense matters to the national army, is crucial to peace in
Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   As Special Forces commander McDonnell put it, "This is a must-win
deal."</TE>

<HD>7 Kashmiri Militant Suspects Held</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>SRINAGAR, India</DL>
<LD>Indian security forces said Saturday that they had arrested seven top
members of a Kashmiri rebel group involved in a series of attacks
during the state assembly election.</LD>
<LD>   The militants of the Hezb-ul-Moujahedeen group, which is fighting
for Kashmir's merger with Pakistan, were arrested Friday in separate
raids by the Border Security Force.</LD>
<LD>   "We achieved a major breakthrough by apprehending the battalion
commander of Hezb-ul-Moujahedeen along with six top associates during
raids in Srinagar city on Friday," a security force spokesman said.</LD>
<TE>   He said the group was involved in a series of attacks on security
forces during elections in India's Jammu and Kashmir state.</TE>
<TE>   A large quantity of weapons and ammunition, including two dozen
grenades, was recovered from the militants.</TE>
<TE>   In a separate incident, three paramilitary soldiers were killed
when suspected Muslim rebels set off a bomb at a polling station late
Friday in a school in Lolab, the spokesman said.</TE>
<TE>   No militant group has claimed responsibility for the attack in
Lolab in northern Kashmir, which will vote Tuesday.</TE>

<LD>Italian police have arrested three Egyptians in a port town near Rome
and are investigating whether they were planning an attack on a U.S.
military cemetery, authorities said Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   Explosives and a map of the cemetery were found in the men's
apartment in Anzio, about 35 miles south of Rome, after police
conducted a raid Friday.</LD>
<LD>   Police officials in Rome confirmed the arrests but declined to
immediately give details Saturday.</LD>
<TE>   The map of the Nettuno cemetery had two of its entrances marked,
said a U.S. official in Rome, speaking on condition of anonymity. The
official confirmed news reports that more than 4 pounds of TNT were
found.</TE>
<TE>   Security at the cemetery, which draws tourists and relatives of
the U.S. military personnel buried there, was stepped up after the
Sept. 11 attacks.</TE>
<TE>   The identities of the three men arrested were not immediately
released, but Italian news reports said they worked as fishermen in
Anzio.</TE>

<HD>Signing of Ivory Coast Cease-Fire Bogs Down</HD>
<DH>Africa: Mediators from six regional nations blame the
government for the delay. They hope to proceed with talks to end a
rebel uprising.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>YAMOUSSOUKRO, Ivory Coast</DL>
<LD>The signing of a cease-fire to stop Ivory Coast's deadliest uprising
in three years was delayed Saturday, forcing an uneasy wait for an
end to fighting.</LD>
<LD>   High-ranking mediators, who flew to Yamoussoukro, the capital, for
the signing blamed the government for the delay.</LD>
<LD>   Although rebels were ready to approve the cease-fire, an army
officer who was to sign for the government was still waiting for
written authorization from Abidjan, the former French colony's
commercial capital, mediators said.</LD>
<TE>   "We have not encountered any difficulties on the side of the
rebels," said Lassana Traore, Mali's foreign minister. They "are
ready to sign."</TE>
<TE>   Late in the afternoon, French troops providing transportation and
security for the mission said it was too late to continue, prompting
the mediators' return to Abidjan.</TE>
<TE>   The participants, including foreign and defense ministers from six
West African countries, said they would seek an explanation for the
delay from Ivorian President Laurent Gbagbo.</TE>
<TE>   Regional leaders have pressed for a cease-fire to clear the way
for peace negotiations.</TE>
<TE>   The signing was originally planned for Friday, but instead
government ministers and mediators spent the day locked in an Abidjan
hotel discussing the document's wording.</TE>
<TE>   Traore said Ivorian ministers contacted Saturday promised that an
official mandate allowing regional commander Col. Philippe Mangou to
sign would be carried to Yamoussoukro. But as daylight faded, there
was no sign of the document.</TE>
<TE>   Government officials could not immediately be reached for comment.</TE>
<TE>   A negotiator, Cheick Diarra, said late Saturday that the delegates
were told that Mangou had since been given authorization to sign.
Diarra said the envoys planned to meet with Gbagbo today and will
travel to Yamoussoukro again.</TE>
<TE>   Gbagbo's administration appeared caught between regional heads of
state pressing for a truce and popular pressure to rout the rebels,
who have taken control of the north.</TE>
<TE>   In Abidjan, government backers, many draped in national flags,
marched through the business district to show their support.</TE>
<TE>   In Lakota, west of Abidjan, government supporters rallied to mourn
a Cabinet minister shot dead in the rebellion's first hours. Women
with leaves in their hair and painted faces performed ritual funeral
dances.</TE>
<TE>   The rebels, however, appeared to have garnered support in the
north, where people complain that the southern-based government
treats them as second-class citizens. Northerners are predominantly
Muslim and come from different ethnic groups than the largely
Christian southerners.</TE>

<HD>From Prison to the Brink of Power</HD>
<DH>Latin America: The man poised to win Brazil's presidency
doesn't forget his radical roots. His candidacy inspires some and
worries others.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HECTOR TOBAR</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAO BERNARDO DO CAMPO, Brazil</DL>
<LD>Djalma Bom remembers the radical leader who got his start outside the
doors of this city's factories, making impassioned speeches about
capitalism, class warfare and Brazil's socialist future. A generation
ago, Bom shared time in prison with him.</LD>
<LD>   Today, the legend of that man, known simply as Lula, looms large
over Brazil. As the country prepared for elections today, Luiz Inacio
Lula da Silva was the overwhelming favorite to become president and
bring his leftist Workers' Party to power, a fact that filled
millions of Brazilians with hope--and millions with dread.</LD>
<LD>   "Lula has the profound sense of compassion and justice that Che
[Guevara] had," said Bom, comparing Lula to Latin America's most
famous guerrilla fighter.</LD>
<TE>   "The country is about to be subjected to political laboratory
experiments," countered Ariosto Texeira, a columnist for O Estado de
Sao Paulo newspaper.</TE>
<TE>   According to all polls here, Lula had double the support of his
nearest competitor. He might even win an outright majority and avoid
a runoff--a prospect that has sent Brazil's currency and its
financial markets tumbling.</TE>
<TE>   If Lula wins, it will be in large measure because the election has
become a referendum on Brazil's decade-long embrace of free trade and
globalization. As the consummate outsider of the Brazilian political
scene, he rode a wave of popular discontent with corruption and 8%
unemployment.</TE>
<TE>   Although he has tried to move to the political center, Lula would
likely make major shifts in this country's relations with the United
States if he won. He has accused the U.S. of trying to "annex" his
nation with unfair trade policies and says the Bush administration
has shut off U.S. markets to Brazilian agricultural exports.</TE>
<TE>   "The United States has been intransigent in the defense of its
interests," Lula told foreign journalists in Sao Paulo last week. "We
Brazilians also have to be intransigent in defense of our own
interests."</TE>
<TE>   With ruling-party candidate Jose Serra running a distant
second--some polls showed him trailing by as much as 26 percentage
points--a host of Brazilian commentators and business leaders has
begun preparing for what had been unthinkable just a year ago: a Lula
presidency.</TE>
<TE>   Roberto Setubal, president of Banco Itau, Brazil's largest bank,
tried to reassure investors in Washington on Tuesday. "Lula's victory
is not a revolution," he said. "He's going to have to make alliances
with others, and he knows it."</TE>
<TE>   Setubal, like many here, blamed the ruling party's poor showing in
the polls on Serra's failings--the former health minister has a
reputation as an unfeeling technocrat--rather than on a rejection of
Brazil's current economic "model."</TE>
<TE>   "Lula is an honest man," Setubal said. "Lula speaks from the
heart. Serra also is a good man, and he is honest. But he doesn't
speak to people's hearts."</TE>
<TE>   Although some business leaders, such as Setubal, don't expect a
President Lula to bring drastic changes, many Wall Street analysts
believe that a Workers' Party administration would toss out the
budget targets set in a $30-billion loan deal between the
International Monetary Fund and the outgoing government of Fernando
Henrique Cardoso.</TE>
<TE>   Those analysts also think that Lula would try to make good on
promised reforms in health and education--forcing the government to
default on Brazil's $260-billion debt. (Lula has given mixed signals
about whether he would abide by the IMF agreement, but he has said
Brazil will not default on the debt.)</TE>
<TE>   On Sept. 24, when a poll put Lula within a few percentage points
of an outright majority, the Sao Paulo stock market plummeted. So did
Brazil's currency, the real, which has continued to fall. In June, $1
bought 2.5 reals; at one point last week, it bought 3.8.</TE>
<TE>   Although the real's fall has, in effect, made most Brazilians
significantly poorer in relation to the rest of the world, it has
done little to affect Lula's standing in the polls. Instead, the
slide seems only to have confirmed a central theme in his campaign:
that Brazil is being hurt by powerful outside forces, including the
"speculators" of the world's financial markets.</TE>
<TE>   "A country the size of Brazil can't be crying, watching television
as the dollar goes up and the stock market falls," Lula told the
foreign press. "The stupidity of these speculators has no limit.
Brazil will not go bankrupt."</TE>
<TE>   To his most loyal supporters, the devaluation is just another
chapter in the Lula legend.</TE>
<TE>   Brazil's elite have always tried to bring Lula down, the
supporters argue, recalling the military dictators who threw Lula the
union leader into jail in the late 1970s, as well as the media barons
at TV Globo network, who party militants believe conspired to
sabotage his first campaign for president, in 1989.</TE>
<TE>   "This time won't be like before because the Brazilian people are
informed now," declared Fred Maia, a Workers' Party activist who
joined 100,000 people for a rally in Sao Paulo on Sept. 29. "Lula's
victory has become inevitable."</TE>
<TE>   Most observers agree that the political panorama of 2002 is
completely different from the days when the Workers' Party was
mounting its first campaigns. The party is finding allies in places
where it used to find enemies. Last month, Lula received a rousing
ovation from military leaders gathered in Rio de Janeiro. Many top
generals are angry that Cardoso cut their budgets; Lula promised that
they will be well-funded.</TE>
<TE>   And every day, it seemed, another leading capitalist jumped on
Lula's bandwagon. Fernando Gasparian, a Sao Paulo business leader,
Cardoso ally and co-founder of the conservative ruling party, joined
two weeks ago. "Lula is a statesman, he has grandeur and is well
informed about Brazil's problems," Gasparian said.</TE>
<TE>   To many in the political center, Lula is a more palatable
alternative to the two other left and center-left candidates: Ciro
Gomes, a mercurial former economy minister, and Anthony Garotinho, a
former governor of Rio de Janeiro state.</TE>
<TE>   David Fleischer, a political scientist at the University of
Brasilia, said Lula has managed to pull off a political high-wire
act: assuring moderate voters that he isn't the "scary" radical of
old, while convincing people hungry for change that an old radical is
really the best man to break Brazil out of its crisis.</TE>
<TE>   "People are unhappy about what's happened these last eight years
under Cardoso," Fleischer said. Polls show that unemployment,
corruption and crime are top concerns. Although many Brazilians blame
Cardoso's "neo-liberalism" for the country's ills, they also fear a
return to the hyperinflation that he brought under control.</TE>
<TE>   Lula's dance between the left and right, change and continuity,
was evident in the last days of the campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Last weekend, he met with top business leaders and repeated a
campaign promise to promote domestic business. But two days later,
Lula announced that, if elected, he would not reappoint Arminio Fraga
Neto to head the Central Bank. Fraga Neto, one of the architects of
Cardoso's pro-business policies, is popular with the financial
markets and the IMF.</TE>
<TE>   "We are going to pick someone who loves Brazil and who, at the
same time, understands the subtleties of the market," Lula said. "But
we also want someone who understands the subtleties of hunger, of
unemployment."</TE>
<TE>   For most of these appearances, Lula wore a suit and tie, breaking
a lifelong habit of jeans and rolled-up sleeves. The new look is
among the many changes instituted by Lula's campaign marketing
specialist, Duda Mendonca, who also reportedly persuaded the
candidate to have his teeth straightened.</TE>
<TE>   Mendonca has crafted TV ads that recount the saga of Lula's life,
a story that begins in a small town in Brazil's impoverished north,
then moves to this industrial suburb of Sao Paulo, where Lula lost a
finger in a workplace accident and became a union organizer.</TE>
<TE>   That's the Lula that Bom, a retired union activist, remembers. "He
told the workers that if they stood in front of their machines with
their arms crossed, they would change history," Bom said, recalling
the speech that preceded the first major strike here.</TE>
<TE>   A few days later, 1,600 workers marched into an auto factory
chanting, "Stop the machines! Cross your arms!" The strike failed,
and Lula and Bom were jailed.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, about 10,000 people gathered in Sao Bernardo do Campo
for the last public act of the campaign. Lula told the crowd:</TE>
<TE>   "On Sunday, if God wills it, a metalworker will be president of
the largest country in Latin America. Never again will anyone be able
to think less of the Brazilian worker."</TE>

<HD>Palestinian Is Killed in Clashes</HD>
<DH>Mideast: A new round of diplomacy is set to begin. Arafat
signs a symbolic bill calling Jerusalem the capital of a future
Palestinian state.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>NABLUS, West Bank</DL>
<LD>A Palestinian youth was killed during clashes here with Israeli
troops Saturday, just ahead of a round of peacemaking efforts.</LD>
<LD>   European Union foreign policy chief Javier Solana, who was set to
begin a mission shuttling between the two sides, said he would
emphasize the need for resumed negotiations between the Israelis and
Palestinians.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. Middle East envoy William Burns is to visit within days, and
an American official said President Bush would meet with Israeli
Prime Minister Ariel Sharon in Washington on Oct. 16 to discuss the
Middle East conflict and possible U.S. action in Iraq.</LD>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat signed
2-year-old legislation defining Jerusalem as the capital of a future
Palestinian state, parliament Speaker Ahmed Korei said.</TE>
<TE>   Korei said Arafat decided to sign the bill Saturday in response to
a U.S. congressional measure that required Washington to recognize
Jerusalem as Israel's capital.</TE>
<TE>   Israel proclaimed Jerusalem as its capital in 1950, but most
countries, including the United States, have their embassies in Tel
Aviv.</TE>
<TE>   Israel captured East Jerusalem from Jordan in the 1967 Middle East
War and later annexed it.</TE>
<TE>   The new Palestinian law is only symbolic: Israel fully controls
both parts of the city and Sharon has pledged not to redivide it.</TE>
<TE>   In Nablus, the shooting of 15-year-old Amer Hashem came during the
sort of confrontation that has become common in the area. Youths
often defy the nearly continuous curfew Israel has imposed since
mid-June in response to suicide bombings by Palestinian militants.</TE>
<TE>   The Israeli army said soldiers fired in self-defense after they
were attacked with stones and at least one bomb but were not aware of
any casualties.</TE>
<TE>   More than 230 Palestinian children and teenagers are among those
who have lost their lives during the 2-year-old uprising against
Israeli occupation.</TE>

<DH>Paternity: Men are assumed responsible unless DNA tests
prove otherwise.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN JOSE, Costa Rica</DL>
<LD>Maria Jimenez doesn't seem like she would have the energy to be part
of a legal revolution.</LD>
<LD>   She's a single mom, living in a poor town about two hours outside
this sleepy capital. She has four kids, no job and no husband.</LD>
<LD>   But Jimenez has seized on a controversial new law here that gives
her the upper hand in winning child support from the man who she
believes is the father of her children.</LD>
<TE>   "My children have the right to know who their father is," said
Jimenez, 32.</TE>
<TE>   The law, which came into effect March 2001, is believed to be the
first of its kind in the world. It allows a mother to name the father
of the child in a simple administrative process that begins in the
hospital's birthing room. The man is asked to submit to a DNA test;
if he does not agree, he is assumed to be the father, with the duty
to pay child support.</TE>
<TE>   The test is legally binding, though the man can appeal the results
in court. The entire process is free.</TE>
<TE>   This procedure contrasts dramatically with the nation's former
paternity system, which was similar to the ones in effect in most of
the U.S. and nearly every other Western country. In those systems,
paternity is determined through court hearings that can take years
and cost thousands of dollars in lawyers' fees.</TE>
<TE>   Since its inception last year, more than 8,000 Costa Rican women
have taken advantage of the new law. A preliminary study shows that
the number of newborns whose fathers' names are not declared in the
country's civil registry has dropped from 30% to about 10%.</TE>
<TE>   "We think it's revolutionary," said Maria San Roman, director of
the clinical laboratory at the country's largest public hospital,
which performs the DNA tests.</TE>
<TE>   The law had plenty of detractors. Many legislators feared that it
would prove too costly because the state pays for the tests. This
year, the lab will spend about $700,000 -- a significant amount in a
country with an annual budget of about $2 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Others feared that it would enable poor women to take advantage of
rich men by naming them as fathers. There were worries that notorious
lotharios would be hit with dozens of requests for DNA tests.</TE>
<TE>   And some lawmakers had philosophical objections. Only women can
force DNA tests under the law. A man has no right to force a DNA test
if he suspects a woman of having borne another man's child.</TE>
<TE>   If a man denies that he is the father, he automatically sacrifices
paternal rights, such as visitation. But in absence of DNA
exoneration, he still has a duty to pay child support, and if he
wants his full paternal rights restored, he must petition the court.</TE>
<TE>   "The law is not proportional. The father is left out," said
Federico Malavassi, the vice president of the legislature who opposed
the law. "It's vindictive."</TE>
<TE>   But the legislation's supporters -- a coalition of women's
groups--say the law has many safeguards to discourage abuse. For
instance, women who falsely accuse men of fathering children can face
civil prosecution.</TE>
<TE>   The government lab has begun taking blood samples from couples and
children, and initial results show that women named the wrong men in
10% of cases.</TE>
<TE>   Women's groups said the new law was needed because the old
paternity system was open to abuse. First, few women used it, because
it took an average of three years to process a case, resulting in
lawyers' fees that few could afford.</TE>
<TE>   Second, men, knowing that they had nothing to lose, often fiercely
fought the paternity suits.</TE>
<TE>   "The thought of child support is like a boogeyman for men here,"
said Montserrat Sagot, a sociologist who specializes in gender
studies at the University of Costa Rica. "They have no vision of
being committed to a woman or to the children they father."</TE>
<TE>   The push for the law came after Costa Rica's then-first lady,
Lorena Clare de Rodriguez, became alarmed at the rising number of
illegitimate children born in the country. Between 1990 and 1999, the
number of children born without declared fathers rose from 21% to
30%.</TE>
<TE>   The issue is more important than simply avoiding the stigma of
being labeled a bastard. Children who have a father listed in the
nation's registry automatically receive rights to inheritance, social
security benefits and child support, regardless of whether the mother
is married to him.</TE>
<TE>   "Everything is easier if they have their father's last name," said
Jimenez, who is still waiting for an appointment to take the DNA test
with the presumed father of her 3-month-old, Monica.</TE>
<TE>   But Costa Rican officials believe that the law might do more than
simply help ensure economic support for fatherless children. They
also hope that men will be more aggressive in using birth control.
Even more, officials hope that the process will persuade men to be
better fathers.</TE>
<TE>   "The idea is not only that the child gets economic support," said
San Roman, the clinic director. "It's also that maybe the child can
receive paternal love and care."</TE>
<TE>   The initial results have given officials some encouragement.</TE>
<TE>   In 56% of the 8,368 cases filed by July, the man named by the
mother admitted that he was the father without taking a DNA test.</TE>
<TE>   In only 7% of cases, in fact, have couples and children actually
taken the test. The rest involved men who couldn't be found. Men must
be served in person with a summons to take the test for the process
to begin.</TE>
<TE>   Ibelis Velazco, a women's rights lawyer who is widely regarded as
the mother of the new law, said the debate over it helped women
realize their rights.</TE>
<TE>   "I believe this law has already brought about important changes,"
Velazco said. "We are empowering women. A cultural change is
happening."</TE>
<TE>   One of those women is Nelsy Chacon, a 42-year-old single mother of
three. All women whose children were born before the new law took
effect must continue to apply to the courts, so she is now fighting
under the old system to establish paternity for her 9-year-old son,
Sebastian, and 7-year-old daughter, Fabiola. The courts have been
deluged with such cases--before, they were handling about 34 a month
but now have 430.</TE>
<TE>   Sipping a cup of coffee after 12 hours of work at a San Jose
supermarket, Chacon said she just wanted to ensure that her children
would have enough money to buy books for school.</TE>
<TE>   The father "thinks the kids live on air or sun," Chacon said. "I'm
tired of worrying about money."</TE>

<HD>Spate of Saudi Bombings Puts Foreigners on Edge</HD>
<DH>Mideast: The killing of a German adds to fears of attacks
by terrorists trying to weaken ties with the West and topple the
monarchy.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL SLACKMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>RIYADH, Saudi Arabia</DL>
<LD>A car bombing that killed a German businessman here last week has
increased fears that terrorists are seeking to undermine needed
social and political reforms at home while once again taking aim at
the kingdom's fragile ties with the West.</LD>
<LD>   No one knows for sure why the 56-year-old German was blown up, but
in this capital, already overheated by fears of terrorism and war
against Iraq, many people say they are worried there will be more
attacks against Westerners and on the oil industry, the source of
this nation's wealth and its lifeline to the world economy.</LD>
<LD>   In both cases, terrorists would be striking against the West, but
the real target would be the ruling House of Saud. They hope that the
collapse of the monarchy--or at least a change in the top
leadership--would usher in a more conservative, anti-Western
government that could carry out Osama bin Laden's goal of ridding the
peninsula of all non-Muslims.</LD>
<TE>   Saudi Arabia is at a pivotal point. Reformers are hoping to use
the shock of the Sept. 11 attacks as a catalyst to bring the country
into the modern world by promoting change in everything from
education to women's rights. But hard-liners see an opportunity to
capitalize on the anger people feel over American scrutiny of their
religious system and the Palestinian-Israeli conflict.</TE>
<TE>   Although the vast majority of Saudis appear to support the
monarchy, many people here worry that an invasion of Iraq could tip
the balance in favor of the extremists.</TE>
<TE>   "There are risks certainly that an attack on Iraq, particularly
unilateral, would ignite those who would like to prevent the kingdom
from moving into the 21st century," said a senior Western diplomat
based here.</TE>
<TE>   Saudi Arabia has always been seen as a low-crime area, especially
for Westerners, who have brought needed business and technical
skills. "Personally, I like living here," said a security analyst
with two decades of experience here. But "professionally, I think it
is ready to explode."</TE>
<TE>   The government quickly denied that the attack on the German
employee of a communications company was linked to any anti-Western
movement, but it fits in a pattern of similar incidents. A British
banker was killed when a car bomb exploded as he drove away from his
Riyadh compound in June. Authorities initially blamed the killing on
a feud between alcohol smugglers but later conceded that the banker
had no ties to the illicit trade, Western diplomats said.</TE>
<TE>   Ten days after the banker died, an American couple escaped injury
when a bomb fell off the undercarriage of their car and failed to
explode. Around the same time, another American spotted a bomb under
his car and called police, who defused it.</TE>
<TE>   Security experts say the car bombings could be practice runs for
something bigger. So far, the devices have been small, attached to
the bottom of cars with magnets and detonated with a homemade mercury
switch and a timer. Although they are simple devices, they show a
deadly expertise and sophistication, experts said.</TE>
<TE>   The attacks have taken a psychological toll. Few Westerners are
seen shopping in the malls these days--and, if they are, they are in
groups. Parties in the desert, once routine, have stopped for the
most part. Many people carry flashlights and mirrors to check beneath
their cars.</TE>
<TE>   "You keep a low profile," said Lisa Saturno, a native of Seattle
who is among the 15,000 Americans in Riyadh.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think people feel frightened, but they feel anxious,"
said Mike Goodman, 60, a retired British physician who moved here to
run a medical program.</TE>
<TE>   Still, foreign and Saudi officials have stepped up security
efforts. Fearful that terrorists will attack schoolchildren, a
strategy that would probably cause many Westerners to flee, many
businesses have stopped their employees from putting their children
on school buses.</TE>
<TE>   Foreigners live in their own walled and guarded compounds, but in
the new tense climate, perimeter walls are being raised to better
ward off intruders and snipers. Western embassies have cautioned
their citizens not to leave their cars unattended--and, if they must,
to examine them carefully before entering. The U.S. Embassy, a
fortress inside the specially protected diplomatic neighborhood, has
posted warnings, reminding employees to stay away from the windows
because "curiosity kills."</TE>
<TE>   If the embassy is the key symbol of the U.S. role, oil is a
special target. The kingdom has about one quarter of the world's
known reserves in fields that are exposed in the desert near the
border with Iraq. The fields are vulnerable to a terrorist planting a
bomb under the pipeline or to missiles the Saudis fear could be
launched by Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   "It certainly is an area of caution and concern for the Saudis,"
the senior Western diplomat said.</TE>
<TE>   Combating the threat from Iraq is almost easier than trying to
anticipate and stop an act of sabotage. Officials said the government
is confident that its sophisticated, computerized system of shut-off
valves could mitigate any damage caused by a blow to the pipeline.
The government has also deployed a battery of Patriot missiles to
protect the petroleum infrastructure.</TE>
<TE>   Facing a restive population and a possible war on its border, the
Saudi leadership has to navigate a difficult path. It has always
tried to balance its relationship with its fundamentalist religious
elements against its desire to maintain strategic ties with
Washington.</TE>
<TE>   The difficulty in that balancing act can be seen in a place like
Buraydah, 200 miles northwest of the capital and home to some of the
government's most vocal critics. Buraydah is a potential tinderbox,
one that could easily ignite a nation that is young, angry at America
and in many cases disillusioned with recent openings to Western
culture.</TE>
<TE>   One recent Friday, Toyota Land Cruisers and pickup trucks loaded
with men in flowing robes parked alongside a sprawling whitewashed
mosque glistening under the midday sun. Their sandaled feet kicked up
a cloud of hot desert dust as they headed inside for prayers, a
weekly ritual that often turns as much on politics as on prayer.</TE>
<TE>   The message was one they and other Saudis have heard repeatedly in
mosques, classrooms, newspapers and even on the Internet. "The words
in the Bible have been altered," said Imam Suleiman Odah, in comments
that echoed over the neighborhood from speakers fixed outside the
mosque. "It is a pity to see that the greatest nation of the world
follows or judges by an altered book, and how all Christians who know
the truth accept President Bush as the guardian for this altered
book, while deep down they know the truth."</TE>
<TE>   He finished by asking Muslims to pray "that God give you strength
over the aggressor Jew, and to enlighten the helpless Christian."</TE>
<TE>   Sheik Salman Odah is one of the most respected religious scholars
in the country. He was imprisoned in the 1990s for calling on the
government to expel all foreign troops from the Arabian peninsula and
for leading an extraordinary 36-hour act of civil disobedience.</TE>
<TE>   He is free now, and, though banned from teaching in schools or
lecturing in the mosques, he holds classes in his home. He is
cautious in what he says but unambiguous in his message:</TE>
<TE>   "Put yourself in the position of people here who see the killing
of the Palestinian people, and they know this all comes from the
money which America pays to Israel and the weapons and airplanes
America gives to Israel. America knows about nuclear weapons in
Israel, but it thinks, without even knowing, there is something in
Baghdad, and look what it does. Put yourself in the position of a
Muslim and Arab. What would you think of America?"</TE>
<TE>   The Buraydah region may be among the most conservative in Saudi
Arabia; even smoking on the streets is discouraged by the religious
authorities. But the attitudes are similar even to those in the
toniest shopping district of the capital.</TE>
<TE>   "America treats the rest of the world with such a sense of
supremacy, like the rest of us are kids," Omar Grbou, 43, said as he
sipped coffee in a cafe in Riyadh's upscale Olaya district.</TE>
<TE>   In the end, observers here say, the direction the nation takes
could hinge on what happens with Iraq. Though the government opposes
any invasion, it still sees its alliance with America as vital, so it
will probably aid the U.S. if it attacks. But Riyadh will do it
reluctantly, part of a political calculation that will also rely on
promoting anti-American rhetoric as a way of maintaining credibility
at home.</TE>
<TE>   "I am moderate," said Prince Walid bin Talal, a multibillionaire
businessman with strong ties to the United States. "I am for America
publicly, but these days if you are for America, you are looked at
suspiciously.</TE>
<TE>   "I believe that if you have a U.N. resolution and you go by it, I
think everybody can hide behind it," he said. "Everybody wants Saddam
Hussein to go. Everybody in their right mind would like Saddam
Hussein to go. Otherwise they're not saying the truth."</TE>

<HD>Sharing a Fear: Will Their Children Forget Them?</HD>

<SE>ENRIQUE'S JOURNEY</SE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>She arrives at the Rio Grande exhausted, worried and crying.</LD>
<LD>   It has taken Lourdes Izaguirre, 26, of Honduras three months to
get here. She cannot call home; her family has no phone.</LD>
<LD>   She has walked away from Byron, 5, and Melissa, 10, as well as her
10-year-old sister and 11-year-old brother, whom she had been raising
for her ailing mother. She is heading north to find work in the
United States and has gotten as far as Nuevo Laredo, across the
border from Texas.</LD>
<TE>   Izaguirre and other mothers have gathered on the second floor of
Parroquia de San Jose--St. Joseph's Parish--a haven for women on the
journey.</TE>
<TE>   "We try to keep each other from going crazy," says Agueda Navarro,
34, who left behind her children, 14 and 4, a few weeks earlier.</TE>
<TE>   Another mother, Belinda Caceres, 29, prays that her children, ages
12, 9 and 2, will have enough to eat and will not get sick while she
is gone.</TE>
<TE>   The women are part of a stream of mothers, many single and from
Central America, who pause at the 2,000-mile-long U.S.-Mexico border
before making their final push into El Norte. They share the same
fears. Will their children forget them? Will they see their children
again?</TE>
<TE>   Back home, Izaguirre says, making Tommy Hilfiger-labeled shirts
netted her $30 a week. It was not enough to feed her son and daughter
each night, even when her ex-husband helped with the light and water
bills.</TE>
<TE>   Byron, her son, went to a birthday party and saw a pinata. He
asked why he could not have a party too. Melissa, her daughter,
needed books and school supplies. She asked why she could not have
them.</TE>
<TE>   Izaguirre said she would go to the United States and send money
for pinatas and books.</TE>
<TE>   Melissa offered to quit school and go to work so their mother
would not leave.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm going to work so you can study," she told them.</TE>
<TE>   Now she fears something will happen to them and she will be too
far away to comfort or help. Worse, she fears that the separation
will last too long and her children will give her the same icy
reception she has watched other mothers endure.</TE>
<TE>   "You lose the love of your child," she says.</TE>
<TE>   She begins to cry. "I feel bad for doing this. It wasn't worth it.
I'd rather starve with my children. But I've come this far. I can't go
back." She mortgaged her property and borrowed money from a neighbor for
her journey. Her voice turns firm again. "I can't go back empty-handed."</TE>
<TE>   "I worry about dying along the way. I know going into another
country is wrong. I know God would be against this. But I hope he
understands."</TE>
<TE>   The torrent of single mothers from Central America began as a
trickle in the 1980s, when women pioneered and dominated migrations
from Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua and Guatemala. Many had been
unwilling to endure the more difficult parts of their relationships
with men: drunkenness, beatings, mistresses. Alone, most found
supporting their children difficult.</TE>
<TE>   Father Ovidio Nery Rodriguez, a priest in Tegucigalpa, Honduras,
explains: "To not prostitute themselves, to feed their children, they
leave."</TE>
<TE>   They were following in the footsteps of mothers from the West
Indies who went to work in New York City, New England and Florida
during the 1960s and '70s as nurses and nannies, often leaving their
children behind.</TE>
<TE>   A Harvard University study last year determined that such
separations are now common: In the United States, one in five
children is raised in an immigrant household and 85% of migrant
children from Central America, Mexico, the Dominican Republic, Haiti
and China have been separated from one or both parents.</TE>
<TE>   The pattern is especially pronounced in Los Angeles, which has
more Central American immigrants than anywhere else. A 1998 USC study
found, for instance, that 82% of Central American live-in nannies
were separated from children they left behind.</TE>
<TE>   Though many mothers expect the separations to be short, typically
they last six to eight years, says Analuisa Espinoza, a Los Angeles
Unified School District social worker who specializes in immigrants.</TE>
<TE>   By then, they are strangers. Some mothers, picking up children
from smugglers, hug the wrong ones.</TE>

<HD>'Ticket to Hell' Is Cheap, Popular and Risky for Kenyan
Commuters</HD>
<DH>Africa: Nairobi's flamboyant minibus taxis are prone to
deadly accidents, but reformers find it's tough to tackle an urban
institution.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVAN MAHARAJ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NAIROBI, Kenya</DL>
<LD>Operators of Kenya's garishly painted minibus taxis seem to revel in
their lawlessness, unabashedly inviting passengers to board vehicles
emblazoned with names such as "The Terrorist," "Highway Massacre" and
"The Ticket to Hell."</LD>
<LD>   Each year, accidents involving the largely unregulated taxis,
known as matatus, kill hundreds of passengers--far more than the
marauding bandits who roam parts of this East African nation.</LD>
<LD>   With their earthquake music and graffiti art, matatus are reigned
over by fearless crews of at least three young men, many of whom hang
out of the careening vehicles to solicit passengers. Several times a
day, the drivers cough up bribes to police officers who pull them
over for cramming more than 25 people in minivans designed to carry
no more than seven.</LD>
<TE>   But the dreaded matatu--which one prominent guidebook describes as
Kenya's contribution to the world--may be about to get a makeover.</TE>
<TE>   Taxi owners, who have to battle cartels that control the matatu
trade, are pressuring authorities to enact a code of conduct that
they say will finally bring civility to their rough-and-tumble
business.</TE>
<TE>   The proposed rules of the matatu owners are telling: They would
prevent drivers from chewing khat, smoking marijuana or indulging in
other drugs while on duty. Operators would have to possess driver's
licenses and not be "morally decadent."</TE>
<TE>   Loud music and most graffiti art would be outlawed. Touts--brash
conductors who solicit passengers--would be required to wear
uniforms. Matatus would sport strips of cautionary orange painted
over their original colors.</TE>
<TE>   Many Kenyans believe that the campaign to rescue the country from
what is known here as "matatu madness" is destined to fail.</TE>
<TE>   "Asking a matatu driver to display good manners is like pleading
with a lion to stop hunting for meat," said George Mvudi, who drives
a matatu with the name Oprah emblazoned on the windshield. "It's a
jungle out there, and if you don't follow rules of the jungle, you
don't survive."</TE>
<TE>   "Let the people of Nairobi have a song and a bit of color," said
Mutuma Mathiu, a columnist for the Daily Nation newspaper. "Life is
hard as it is without adding mousy matatus and touts in smocks."</TE>
<TE>   Matatu counterculture, Mathiu said, is a porthole into the chaotic
soul of Nairobi, the Kenyan capital.</TE>
<TE>   "The matatu man epitomizes the impatient, aggressive, virile and
energetic qualities of our city," he said. "The up-yours literature
and art on the matatu ... is the language of a polluted, poor and
unplanned city."</TE>
<TE>   The history of the matatu dates to Kenya's 1963 independence from
Britain, when young entrepreneurs bought used military vehicles to
ferry people from the suburbs to jobs in the city. Riders paid
tatu--the Swahili word for three--cents. (Rides in Nairobi now cost
about 15 to 40 cents, depending on the distance.)</TE>
<TE>   As workers flocked to Nairobi, matatus became wildly popular,
providing a cheaper alternative to Kenya's inefficient bus service.</TE>
<TE>   The matatus began reflecting the hobbies, personal fantasies and
dreams of their drivers and touts. Today, matatus are likely to bear
the names of hip-hop artists--Snoop Doggy Dogg, P. Diddy, Ice T--or
sports idols such as Marion Jones, Mike Tyson and Kobe Bryant.</TE>
<TE>   Other drivers simply try to cash in on hot news topics. John
Okana, 29, named his Nissan matatu Monica Lewinsky after the
revelation that she was romantically involved with former President
Clinton.</TE>
<TE>   "I love her toughness and her abilities to stand things," Okana
said. "Plus, it has given me an upper hand on women [passengers], who
love riding this vehicle."</TE>
<TE>   Driver Stephen Macharia found that naming his matatu Oprah--"I
just fell in love with her, her beauty, her show"--meant more riders.
Several copycats have since splashed the name of the talk-show host
on their matatus.</TE>
<TE>   Names aren't the only way that crews compete. Matatus are mobile
discos, pumping out the latest hip-hop, lingala (Congolese pop) and
reggae dance-hall tunes at an ear-shattering 200 decibels.</TE>
<TE>   A doctor at Kenyatta National Hospital here said many passengers
have suffered "mental disturbance, stress, dizziness and vertigo"
after being bombarded with the loud music.</TE>
<TE>   A common rule for matatu operators is that there is always room
for one more. Because some passengers have to sit on others' laps,
women are frequently groped. Many riders tumble out of the barely
stopped vehicles, their wallets, cell phones and other valuables in
the possession of pickpockets.</TE>
<TE>   It doesn't help that matatu crews are often sleep-deprived
teenagers who use their meager wages to buy booze, marijuana and
shoots of khat, a mild stimulant.</TE>
<TE>   Police say horrific matatu crashes account for most of the 3,000
Kenyans who die in road accidents each year. According to media
reports, Kenya has the highest vehicular fatality rate in the world.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, 23 people were killed and 35 injured when their
speeding, 25-seat matatu plunged into a river south of Nairobi.</TE>
<TE>   Survivors described how frightened passengers had pleaded with the
drunk driver to stop speeding.</TE>
<TE>   "We [begged] the driver to slow down since he was not familiar
with the road, but his two [touts] cheered him on," said Makau
Mutune, who survived the crash along with the driver.</TE>
<TE>   In its latest guide to East Africa, Lonely Planet offers tourists
on safaris tips on how to survive a matatu ride and notes: "Valium is
available over the counter in Kenya."</TE>
<TE>   Despite their reputation, matatus have become cash cows. By some
estimates, the country's 40,000 matatus rake in about $100 million a
year, which means that many Kenyans stand in line to collect their
share.</TE>
<TE>   A few years ago, the government began requiring matatu owners to
pay a few thousand dollars before allowing their vehicles on the
road.</TE>
<TE>   Now Mafia-style cartels--one calls itself the Taliban--charge
matatu owners as much as $1,000 to operate on a route, and they
insist on hiring the drivers and touts. During the last year, several
people have died in violent clashes between rival cartels.</TE>
<TE>   And there are the daily police checkpoints, or unofficial toll
stations, where matatus have to pay nearly $3, a tidy sum in Kenya.
Traffic officers, who earn less than $100 a month, use the bribes to
supplement their wages.</TE>
<TE>   John Githongo, a prominent local commentator who heads the local
chapter of corruption-watchdog group Transparency International, said
many traffic officers--who must share the bribes with their
superiors--compete fiercely to be assigned to lucrative routes.</TE>
<TE>   Four years ago, retired banker Dickson Mbugua, who owns three
25-seat matatus, decided to bring some order to the matatu business.</TE>
<TE>   He formed the Matatu Welfare Assn., a group of owners that would
fight the cartels, corrupt police officers and unkempt drivers and
touts.</TE>
<TE>   Mbugua decided that before the group tackled corruption, matatu
owners first had to put their own houses in order--hence the code of
conduct.</TE>
<TE>   Drivers and touts have come out strongly against the code,
particularly the uniform requirement. Some say uniforms and hip-hop
culture don't mix.</TE>
<TE>   "No one is going to respect us if we wear aprons," said David
Kariuki, a tout who earns about $4 a day. "Uniforms are for girls.
This is a man's job."</TE>
<TE>   The proposed code of conduct has yet to be approved by
transportation authorities.</TE>
<TE>   But Mary Mwangangi, a deputy commissioner of police and the
country's top traffic officer, said the new rules have her blessing.</TE>
<TE>   What about reining in her own gangs of corrupt officers?</TE>
<TE>   "I have a plan," she said, and paused. "But if I tell you, they'll
find out."</TE>
<TE>   Many passengers, accustomed to obnoxious matatu crews, don't
believe that the code of conduct will make a difference.</TE>
<TE>   "A rude and smelly tout in a uniform will still be a rude and
smelly tout," 24-year-old Esther Onyango said as she alighted from
the Princess Diana.</TE>

<HD>U.S. and N. Korea Wrap Up Meetings</HD>
<DH>Asia: Envoy says he conveyed Washington's 'serious concern'
about Pyongyang's weapons programs, human rights record and 'dire
humanitarian situation.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>VALERIE REITMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SEOUL</DL>
<LD>A U.S. envoy dispatched by President Bush concluded three days of
talks with officials in North Korea on Saturday but offered few clues
about any improvement in relations between their nations.</LD>
<LD>   Assistant Secretary of State James A. Kelly said that his
consultations with senior officials of the country Bush has labeled
part of an "axis of evil" were candid and that he had conveyed
Washington's "serious concern" about North Korea's missile and
weapons programs, human rights record and "dire humanitarian
situation."</LD>
<LD>   Kelly's was the first visit to North Korea by a senior U.S.
diplomat since former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright met with
leader Kim Jong Il two years ago in Pyongyang, the capital, raising
toasts at dinners and attending a "mass games" performance at his
side.</LD>
<TE>   But the warm and friendly tone struck by Albright has turned
frosty since Bush took office. He lumped North Korea together with
Iran and Iraq in the "axis of evil."</TE>
<TE>   Kelly's four meetings in Pyongyang included sessions with Kim Yong
Nam, second in North Korea's hierarchy under Kim Jong Il and the
North's ceremonial head of state, and with First Vice Foreign
Minister Kang Sok Ju, who negotiated a U.S.-North Korean nuclear
agreement eight years ago.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. keyed in on North Korea's weapons of mass destruction,
missile development programs, missile exports and conventional force
deployment, telling North Korean officials that their nation's
conduct "could have implications for regional and global security,"
Kelly said. A comprehensive effort by North Korea to address those
concerns could lead to an improvement in bilateral relations, he
said.</TE>
<TE>   "The meetings were frank, as befits the seriousness of our
differences, and they were useful too," Kelly said in brief remarks
to the media in Seoul. He refused to take questions or elaborate.</TE>
<TE>   State Department officials said the meetings weren't anything on
the order of the summit last month between Japanese Prime Minister
Junichiro Koizumi and Kim Jong Il, which paved the way for talks on
diplomatic normalization to begin between their countries. During
that summit, North Korea acknowledged kidnapping 13 Japanese in the
1970s and '80s, and Japan apologized for its occupation of the Korean
peninsula and wartime activities in the first half of last century.</TE>
<TE>   No decision on additional meetings between the U.S. and North
Korea has been made, Kelly said, "nor did we expect any following my
visit."</TE>
<TE>   Reaction from North Korea was not available Saturday night.</TE>
<TE>   Kelly and his nine-member delegation--including representatives
from the National Security Council, the Defense Department and the
Joint Chiefs of Staff--flew back to Seoul earlier in the day. Kelly
then briefed South Korean officials on the meeting and planned to fly
to Tokyo to do the same for the Japanese.</TE>
<TE>   Officials in Washington will review the results and decide "what
the next step should be," Kelly said.</TE>

<HD>Iraq War Crimes Dossiers in Works</HD>
<DH>Strategy: The U.S. effort to document abuses by Hussein and
his 'dirty dozen' reflects preparation for the aftermath of conflict.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBIN WRIGHT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Bush administration is laying the groundwork for prosecuting
Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein and a "dirty dozen" other officials for
genocide, "ethnic cleansing," mass executions, rape and other crimes
against humanity.</LD>
<LD>   The push to prepare dossiers for war crimes prosecutions, which
now involves the State Department, the Pentagon and the intelligence
community, reflects the growing momentum in Washington toward ousting
Hussein and the increasing preparation for the days afterward -- even
though President Bush has not yet made a decision on going to war
against Iraq.</LD>
<LD>   "We need to do our part to document the abuses, to collect the
evidence that points to who is responsible," said Pierre-Richard
Prosper, the State Department's ambassador at large for war crimes
and a former U.N. war crimes prosecutor for the Rwanda tribunal. "We
feel there has to be accountability for what has occurred. You can't
brush aside the deaths of more than 100,000 people."</LD>
<TE>   In a telling reflection of how the Iraqi leader relies on family
and tribe to enforce his rule, half of the dozen on the U.S. list are
members of Hussein's family: two sons, three half brothers and a
cousin.</TE>
<TE>   After Hussein, the next name on the list is Ali Hassan Majid,
nicknamed "Chemical Ali" for his role in a 1988 operation--code-named
Al Anfal, or "the spoils"--that used chemical weapons to kill tens of
thousands of Kurds in northern Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   Majid, a cousin of the Iraqi president, was also responsible for
putting down 1991 uprisings by northern Kurds and southern Shiites
after the first Bush administration called for Iraqis to oust
Hussein.</TE>
<TE>   At least 130,000 civilians have been killed as a result of
deliberate regime policies during Hussein's 23-year rule, although
that might prove to be only a fraction of the final tally, according
to U.S. officials and human rights groups. Tens of thousands,
including women, children and the elderly, were victims of chemical
weapons attacks.</TE>
<TE>   In a massive ethnic cleansing campaign, more than 120,000
Iraqis--primarily Kurds, Turkomans and Assyrians, none of whom are
Arabs--have been forcibly expelled from the area around the northern
city of Kirkuk to "Arabize" the oil-rich region, government and
private groups say.</TE>
<TE>   In the northern region known as Kurdistan, ethnic cleansing that
began in 1991 has accelerated in recent months, according to Human
Rights Watch. Every week, anywhere from three to 20 families are
forcibly expelled from their homes and towns, said Hania Mufti, an
Iraq specialist with Human Rights Watch who just returned from a
fact-finding mission to the region.</TE>
<TE>   The issue of justice is also key to Iraqis, both for healing deep
wounds and for rebuilding the nation.</TE>
<TE>   "For Iraqis and the international community, the issue of
addressing Saddam's crimes against humanity is as important as
addressing his possession and use of weapons of mass destruction,"
said Sermid Sarraf, an Iraqi American lawyer based in Los Angeles who
works with the State Department on government transition issues.</TE>
<TE>   The United States, with varying degrees of support from Iraqi
opposition groups and human rights organizations, is looking at a
three-tiered system of tribunals to deal with the thousands of army
commanders, ruling Baath party officials, government employees, and
security and intelligence agents implicated in war crimes.</TE>
<TE>   In a break with the recent pattern of international war crimes
prosecutions for the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda, the administration
now favors a tribunal to try top officials inside a "free Iraq," with
Iraqi and foreign judges, probably including Americans, according to
administration officials.</TE>
<TE>   The tribunal would prosecute the leadership--which could well
expand beyond the original 12 after further investigations--for
violations of both Iraqi law and international conventions.</TE>
<TE>   "If and when there is a regime change, the appropriate forum
should be at home, in a free and democratic Iraq," said Prosper, a
former deputy district attorney in Los Angeles who dealt with
hard-core gangs.</TE>
<TE>   The concept has been endorsed by the Iraqi Jurists Assn., an exile
group based in London, and by more than 40 Iraqi emigre judges, law
professors and legal experts who met last month in Italy to discuss a
transitional justice system in the event of Hussein's ouster.</TE>
<TE>   The hybrid is also a model necessitated by the Bush
administration's opposition to the International Criminal Court,
human rights groups say. Washington would look hypocritical if it
asked for a United Nations-mandated war crimes tribunal now.</TE>
<TE>   "Other nations would see the U.S. action on Iraq to be
particularly self-serving in the absence of cooperation on an
international criminal court, which the rest of the world is keen
on," said Michael Amitay, director of the research group Washington
Kurdish Institute.</TE>
<TE>   A similar hybrid of local and foreign judges and lawyers is being
used to deal with war crimes trials stemming from the decade-long
civil conflict in the West African nation of Sierra Leone, although
human rights experts are concerned about the precedent this model
would establish if used in Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a practical approach, but the international community would
like to see these people dealt with in a way that conforms with the
developing law on crimes against humanity, especially given that
these crimes are so much more severe than anything dealt with
anywhere recently," said Charles Forest, chief executive of Indict,
an international group based in London that is amassing information
on Iraqi war crimes.</TE>
<TE>   After the trials of the top leaders, the next level--potentially
dealing with hundreds or even thousands of offenses, because the war
crimes go back a full generation--would be left to local courts, U.S.
officials say.</TE>
<TE>   "The pattern globally is that midlevel cases can be dealt with by
a conventional domestic system which is accepted and known by the
people. It also serves as an important means of reviving the justice
system," said an administration official who requested anonymity.</TE>
<TE>   The third and largest group of cases might never go to trial but
would instead be worked out through a group similar to the Truth and
Justice Commission in South Africa that would grant a form of amnesty
in exchange for a full accounting of crimes committed.</TE>
<TE>   "One thing we have learned with war crimes around the world is
that it's impossible to prosecute each and every perpetrator, as the
number is so large," Prosper said. "You have to deal with the leaders
to send a strong signal that justice will prevail. But the treatment
of the balance of cases is more flexible, depending on the needs of
society."</TE>
<TE>   To avoid violent retribution after regime change in Baghdad, the
exile group of jurists has issued a communique calling on fellow
Iraqis not to take the law into their own hands.</TE>
<TE>   "There are millions of Baath party members who joined the party
mainly to advance their jobs or survive but aren't guilty of crimes,"
said Sarraf, who attended the meeting last month in Italy. "Then
there's the guy in the army who killed someone on orders and to stay
alive. Those individuals who can raise defenses such as
'involuntarily killed on threat of losing their own lives' ought to
be allowed to use that as a defense."</TE>
<TE>   The decision to prepare for war crimes prosecutions follows 11
years of inaction on Iraqi war crimes despite a wealth of data,
eyewitness accounts and more than 18 tons of seized Iraqi documents,
according to the Iraqi opposition and human rights groups.</TE>
<TE>   Ironically, the first Bush administration opted not to push for
such prosecutions even after the 1991 uprisings, which were called
for personally by President George H.W. Bush.</TE>
<TE>   The Clinton administration also did not push the U.N. Security
Council for either a tribunal or a "commission of experts" on Iraqi
war crimes, and that resulted in missed opportunities to put pressure
on Hussein's regime, according to Iraqi and human rights groups.</TE>
<TE>   "Over the years, the U.S. has failed to take a leadership role in
bringing this regime to justice, which could have been done without
toppling it. The U.S. could have pushed for an apparatus that would
demonstrate the regime's criminality and further isolate it by
obligating other countries to arrest and extradite any Iraqi official
who left Iraq," Amitay said.</TE>
<TE>   "We might not be where we are today if there had been action."</TE>

<TE>   Accusations Against Hussein</TE>
<TE>   War crimes claims against Saddam Hussein:</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Genocide of the Kurds: About 100,000 Kurds were killed in eight
1988 military offensives during systematic extermination campaign
code named Al Anfal, or 11the spoils.'' Chemical weapons were used to
kill, terrorize and force northern Kurds to flee.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   ``Ethnic cleansing'': More than 120,000 Kurds, Turkomans and
Assyrians  around Kirkuk have been forcibly expelled since 1991 to
`arabize' the oil-rich region. Expulsions have accelerated over the
last year.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Mass civilian executions: After the 1991 uprisings in northern
Kurdistan  and the Shiite-dominated south, between 30,000 and 60,000
people were killed in hospitals, homes, mosques and streets.
Civilians were tied to tanks and used as human shields, corralled
into stadiums or suburbs where helicopter gunships opened fire,
drowned by being weighted with rocks and thrown into the Shatt al
Arab waterway, and thrown from windows.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Prison cleansing: Thousands of mainly political prisoners have
been executed in irregular emptying of jails. At Abu Ghraib, west of
Baghdad, about 2,000 were shot or hanged in 1988 in less than 48
hours.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Religious persecution: Repeated attacks on civilian Shiite Muslims
living in the southern marshes, at least 90% of which have been
deliberately drained to destroy the local economy and displace tens
of  thousands. In the south, religious leaders have been assassinated
and mosques destroyed since 1991.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Rape: Regular government practice of raping females to intimidate
or coerce male relatives.</TE>

<HD>The Plots Thicken in Foreign Markets</HD>
<DH>Movies: With roughly 50% of annual revenue coming from
overseas, Hollywood studios try to tailor campaigns to local tastes
and sensibilities.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CLAUDIA ELLER and LORENZA MUNOZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Remember those steamy trailers for last year's acclaimed movie
"Moulin Rouge," the ones with Nicole Kidman locked in a swirling,
sensual dance with her smitten lover?</LD>
<LD>   Now imagine the same slinky redhead taking her final breath, her
body sprawled on a bed of blood-red rose petals, a heartsick young
man sobbing at her side.</LD>
<LD>   That's the promo they saw in Japan, where "tragic love is
considered most noble and honorable," said the film's director, Baz
Luhrmann. No matter that the trailer gave away the ending, a strategy
that would prompt most American moviegoers to chuck their popcorn at
the screen.</LD>
<TE>   The split personality of the "Moulin Rouge" ads
reflects Hollywood's continuing struggle to figure out how to extend its
global reach. Although the overseas markets have been very good to
the industry, they have not produced the riches once imagined, given
the size of the potential audience.</TE>
<TE>   Some blockbusters such as "Spider-Man" and the "Star Wars" movies
virtually sell themselves because of the simplicity of their plots,
their muscular action scenes and dazzling special effects. But most
of Hollywood's exports require the sensibilities of a cultural
anthropologist to understand the nuances and norms of countries
around the globe.</TE>
<TE>   "It isn't one world when it comes to laughing, crying or being
frightened," said industry veteran Warren Lieberfarb, president of
Warner Home Video. "There is not one homogeneous appetite for
American movies, and that is what poses this huge challenge for the
U.S. studios."</TE>
<TE>   Universal Pictures had hoped that its sleeper hit "The Fast and
the Furious" would rev up business abroad, but foreign audiences
weren't interested in its uniquely American backdrop of illegal
street racing. Domestic comedies, meanwhile, rarely catch fire
abroad--even when headlined by such major stars as Adam Sandler and
Jim Carrey. The jokes often don't translate well.</TE>
<TE>   New Line Cinema's tear jerker "I Am Sam," in which Sean Penn
portrays a mentally challenged dad, hit big in Japan but flopped in
England, Germany and France.</TE>
<TE>   "It was too sappy for them," explained Rolf Mittweg, head of
international marketing and distribution at New Line.</TE>
<TE>   On the flip side, high-profile movies that withered in the U.S.
sometimes find audiences abroad. Steven Spielberg's sci-fi drama
"A.I.," which grossed less than $80 million domestically, made that
much in Japan alone, where audiences worship Spielberg and were wowed
by the movie's futuristic themes.</TE>
<TE>   During the last decade, as the U.S. market has plateaued, foreign
territories have become increasingly important to the studios.
Roughly 50% of their annual theatrical revenue comes from overseas.
Sometimes it can be far more. Last year's blockbuster "Harry Potter
and the Sorcerer's Stone" earned more than twice as much on foreign
soil--$651 million--as it did here. That's the equivalent of six hits
in the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   Still, industry executives acknowledge that the vast majority of
their offerings are not selling abroad as they once hoped.</TE>
<TE>   Ten years ago, the studios were predicting that, by now, foreign
ticket sales would constitute 70% of their business. They
underestimated the difficulties of drawing people to theaters in
countries with unique personalities. Here, people go to the movies an
average of 5.2 times a year. In Europe, it's 1.3. Compared with the
relative predictability of the domestic landscape, "the international
marketplace is the Wild West," said Revolution Studios founder Joe
Roth.</TE>
<TE>   The foreign market has become so important that no studio boss
today would "greenlight" a movie--particularly an expensive
one--without factoring in its international potential. "It would be
like crossing the street and not looking both ways," said 20th
Century Fox Co-Chairman Tom Rothman.</TE>
<TE>   And to make sure they don't get flattened, Hollywood marketers are
increasingly tailoring their campaigns to indigenous tastes.</TE>
<TE>   Rothman's studio scored one of last year's biggest--and most
unexpected--triumphs in the U.S. with its animated feature "Ice Age,"
starring TV comedian Ray Romano as the voice of a woolly mammoth
named Manny. Romano, the star of CBS' "Everybody Loves Raymond," was
the centerpiece of the "Ice Age" ad campaign.</TE>
<TE>   So when the movie opened big overseas, Rothman immediately picked
up the phone to share the good news with Romano.</TE>
<TE>   "You're knocking them dead in Germany," Rothman gushed.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't speak German," Romano wryly reminded him.</TE>
<TE>   In his exuberance, Rothman had forgotten Otto Waalkes,
who headlined the German campaign. One of the country's hottest comics,
he dubbed the voice of the film's frenetic wise-cracking sloth, Sid.</TE>
<TE>   Besides online chats, Waalkes went on radio and TV to stump
for the film. He produced funny jingles. He showed the movie trailer on
his comedy tours. At the premiere, he autographed posters.</TE>
<TE>   "I am a German comedian, and to make the Germans laugh is
not easy," he said. "In dubbing, I used some specific German things like
a yodel.... People stop me in the streets and ask me to do Sid now."</TE>
<TE>   Maybe, as Waalkes insists, Germans are a tough crowd, but at least
they flock to U.S. films as no one else in Europe. The Italians are
another matter. They spend the summer at the beach, when Hollywood
wants them indoors, watching its most expensive offerings. The goal
has been to get Italians into the country's recently built
air-conditioned multiplexes year round.</TE>
<TE>   "I really respect local customs," said Jeff Blake, head
of worldwide marketing and distribution at Sony Pictures. "But it's in
our long-term interest to make it a 12-month-a-year business."</TE>
<TE>   Hoping to draw larger crowds this past summer, nearly every major
studio released more big-ticket titles than ever, including Sony's
"Spider-Man," Fox's "Star Wars: Episode 2 Attack of the Clones,"
Warner Bros.' "Scooby-Do" and Disney's "Lilo &amp; Stitch."</TE>
<TE>   Still, the Italians proved stubborn.</TE>
<TE>   Although "Spider-Man" soared on its opening weekend, ticket sales
fell nearly 60% the next week when it was upstaged by gorgeous
weather and World Cup soccer. "Lilo &amp; Stitch" had an even tougher
time. To build momentum, Disney built a giant outdoor screen in the
seaside city of Ostia, near Rome, for the movie's premiere. It didn't
work. In Italy, the film took in a disappointing $4 million.</TE>
<TE>   "It's going to take a few years to educate Italians to go to the
movies in summer," said Giampaolo Letta of Rome-based Medussa Film,
which operates 42 screens in Italy. "People prefer to go outside with
ice cream or take a walk."</TE>
<TE>   But Hollywood knows that there are many other countries
where people will stand in line, rain or shine, to see an American
movie--if the marketing works.</TE>
<TE>   The plotting begins in studio conference rooms like the one at MGM
in Santa Monica, where five executives recently gathered for a
brainstorming session. The topic: how to sell James Bond overseas to
a new generation that prefers edgier action heroes.</TE>
<TE>   The international market is especially important for the
Bond movies because, historically, two-thirds of their total box office
has come from abroad.</TE>
<TE>   Sitting around a conference table are five top marketing
executives debating the ad campaigns for the upcoming "Die Another
Day." Their goal is to make actor Pierce Brosnan cooler and his new
co-star, Halle Berry, sexy without being a sex object. No more
leading ladies with names like Pussy Galore. Both actors have been
photographed in various outfits to suit specific international
tastes. "Halle, we shot in a gown, in a black leather dress, in her
action outfit with swords and knives," says Linda Goldin, vice
president of creative advertising. "We did everything to try to cover
what we might need in every market."</TE>
<TE>   "I think Halle in a bikini will be really great for older Bond
fans too," adds marketing strategist Megan Crawford.</TE>
<TE>   Ian Sutherland, head of MGM's international division, asks about
Brosnan. "Do you have him in the button-down look? Or do you make him
more accessible, a bit more cool, open-necked and looking suave?"</TE>
<TE>   Along the walls of the conference room is a collection of
international posters from past Bond campaigns, including a couple
from "The World Is Not Enough."</TE>
<TE>   One, from France, gave the star treatment to a secondary
character, who happened to be played by French actress Sophie
Marceau.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the Italian ads featured no 007 actors. Marketing
executives said the Bond character is simply too uptight for Italian
tastes. So in place of the perfectly coifed Brosnan is a shirtless,
shaggy-haired, despondent-looking convict with his forearms pressed
through prison bars. The copy line, translated from Italian, reads:
"You better have a good reason to miss the next James Bond film."</TE>
<TE>   Savvy stars like Berry know that their own success also depends on
filling seats outside the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   "It's about dollars and cents," said Berry. "The more dollars and
cents you generate, the more work you get as an actress."</TE>
<TE>   And the stars aren't the only ones crucial to Hollywood's
marketing machine.</TE>
<TE>   When Warner Bros.' star-studded remake of "Ocean's Eleven" was
released in France last year, the media requested more interviews
with director Steven Soderbergh than with Brad Pitt, Julia Roberts or
George Clooney, according to the studio.</TE>
<TE>   Movie directors with distinctive styles are regarded in France as
the creators, or auteurs, of the films they make, a tradition dating
to cinema's earliest days.</TE>
<TE>   In the case of the "Ocean's Eleven" French campaign, Warner Bros.
wanted to put Soderbergh's name above the movie's title. The director
turned down the offer, insisting that it would detract from the
ensemble cast, said Warner Bros. international marketing head, Sue
Kroll.</TE>
<TE>   In France, marquee directors reign supreme. "All other
information," she said, "is secondary."</TE>
<TE>   Although studio bosses know what sells in France, Japan is another
story. It is Hollywood's top-grossing territory--and its most
confounding.</TE>
<TE>   "You think that, if you have a film that is powerful, you can
overcome cultural differences," said Stephen Moore, head of Fox
International. "But I give up when it comes to Japan. You have to
accept that you're always starting from scratch."</TE>
<TE>   It's partly a matter of gender.</TE>
<TE>   In the U.S., Hollywood's most avid moviegoers are
18- to 24-year-old males. In Japan, the market is driven by young women
known as "O.Ls"--Office Ladies. Typically reserved, they rarely
express emotion in public but they feel comfortable letting loose in
darkened theaters.</TE>
<TE>   These women made winners of such weepies as the Winona
Ryder/Richard Gere romantic drama "Autumn in New York" and "Sweet
November," with Charlize Theron and Keanu Reeves. Both movies bombed
in the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   "Young males in Japan are finicky," said Universal Pictures'
international marketing chief, Randy Greenberg. "You hope and pray
that they go ... but they don't necessarily show up en masse, as you
need them to do on your opening weekend."</TE>
<TE>   Besides praying, the studios rely heavily on their own marketing
and distribution teams in each country for guidance on how a movie
might be received.</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes, the feedback can be painful, as Disney learned when it
screened the "Pearl Harbor" trailer for its Japanese staff in Tokyo.</TE>
<TE>   The trailer's themes of American patriotism and heroism earned
high marks from U.S. test audiences. But in Japan, viewers did not
respond well to a trailer that was filled with explosive footage of
the surprise attack on unsuspecting Americans.</TE>
<TE>   Mark Zoradi, who oversees Disney's international film and home
video division, described the audience reaction: "There was silence.
Not a word. I looked at the guy I was with and said, 'Man, do we have
some work to do!' "</TE>
<TE>   The studio neutralized the trailer's war scenes by excising "all
the flag-waving stuff," Zoradi said.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, Disney emphasized the story's romance and added a
scene in which a Japanese fighter pilot motions to some boys playing
baseball to get out of harm's way.</TE>
<TE>   In the end, Japanese audiences embraced "Pearl Harbor's" softer
angle, helping to make Japan the film's top-grossing foreign market.</TE>
<TE>   Such was not the case for Fox's "Moulin Rouge."</TE>
<TE>   Despite the best efforts of the studio and director, not even the
tragic scene in the trailers could seduce Japanese audiences. Only a
fraction of the movie's $120-million overseas gross came from Japan.</TE>
<TE>   Luhrmann was disappointed and dumbfounded.</TE>
<TE>   "We never cracked Japan at the level we thought we could," he
said. "I can't explain it."</TE>

<HD>Cheers Greet Ahmanson Critics at Rally</HD>
<DH>Protest: Celebrities and politicians denounce the
3,050-home proposal. Developer shuns what was billed as a debate.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WENDY THERMOS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>One side billed it as a town hall meeting to debate issues. The other
side shunned it as a publicity stunt.</LD>
<LD>   And so a leather desk chair set aside for Kerry Killinger, chief
executive of Washington Mutual Bank, sat empty on a platform Saturday
as 250 people listened to about a dozen celebrities and politicians
denounce the proposal for the Ahmanson Ranch mini-city. The project
near the border of Los Angeles and Ventura counties is being
developed by Washington Mutual.</LD>
<LD>   With virtually every person in the room cheering loudly in
opposition to the project, the assembled personalities seemed to be
preaching to the converted.</LD>
<TE>   "It was clearly one-sided," acknowledged Chad Griffin, spokesman
for Rally to Save Ahmanson Ranch, sponsor of the event at Taft High
School in Woodland Hills and a major opponent of the 3,050-home
development. "I think there was probably only one person there from
the other side."</TE>
<TE>   He said he hoped that the speeches in pep rally style by actor
Dylan McDermott, producer Rob Reiner, political commentator Arianna
Huffington, Los Angeles Mayor James K. Hahn and others would spur
those who attended to "be more active" in writing letters, lobbying
neighbors and canceling loans or accounts with Washington Mutual.</TE>
<TE>   Washington Mutual representatives, who declined to answer the
group's written requests for a debate, stayed away from the meeting
and characterized it as a Hollywood-driven stunt.</TE>
<TE>   "It's part of Rob Reiner's PR strategy," said a bank spokesman,
Tim McGarry, referring to Reiner's co-chairmanship of the Rally to
Save group. "We think it's really a rally against new housing."</TE>
<TE>   The word "housing," however, barely came up. Speeches focused on
traffic to be generated by an estimated 10,000 residents who would
move in just north of Calabasas in Ventura County.</TE>
<TE>   Reiner scoffed at a recent proposal by Ventura County Supervisor
Frank Schillo to require a $30-million traffic mitigation fee from
Washington Mutual. Caltrans "will have to build an extra lane on the
101 in each direction" to handle the load, he said, and "everyone
knows that will cost $200 million to $300 million."</TE>
<TE>   Hahn joined others in predicting added air pollution, degraded
water quality and fouling of Surfrider Beach with sewage and other
harmful substances. "Washington Mutual, listen to the people. They
don't want this project," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Huffington accused the developer of "one of the worst examples of
corporate abuse" in its pursuit of development in spite of effects on
neighboring communities.</TE>
<TE>   Washington Mutual has said it hopes to break ground in late 2003.</TE>
<TE>   McDermott, who appears in the television show "The Practice," told
the audience that he recently learned about the project from his
wife. "Washington Mutual is all about money, and they're just trying
to make more money," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Other speeches criticizing the development proposal came from
former Monkees band member Micky Dolenz, Los Angeles County
Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky, Assemblywoman Fran Pavley (D-Agoura
Hills), Los Angeles City Councilman Dennis Zine and actress Amy
Smart.</TE>
<TE>   McGarry said a 1992 environmental impact report "fully studied the
traffic consequences of Ahmanson Ranch and disclosed what they would
be."</TE>
<TE>   Opponents want a new study, but Ventura County and Caltrans
officials back Washington Mutual's contention that the study was
accurate, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "The problems of the 101 highway are problems of regional growth
and require a regional solution," McGarry said.</TE>
<TE>   "To my knowledge, no project in Southern California has ever been
required to mitigate traffic on major highways," he said.</TE>

<LD>A key Ventura County hearing on the proposed 3,050-home Ahmanson
Ranch project is being delayed to give the public more time to review
environmental documents.</LD>
<LD>   The hearing, slated for Wednesday, will be held on Oct. 14 because
defects have been found on compact discs containing a 4,000-page
environmental study, said Bruce Smith, a planning manager.</LD>
<LD>   Several pages of information were missing on some of the discs,
Smith said, adding that Ventura County will make replacement copies
available at no charge.</LD>
<TE>   A county review board is to vote on the technical adequacy of the
study, which must be approved before construction can begin.</TE>
<TE>   The hearing will begin at 9 a.m. at the Hall of Administration in
Ventura.</TE>

<HD>Minister Guides Bikers on Road to Redemption</HD>
<DH>Religion: Richard Fish welcomes leather, tattoos and
Harleys at his Simi Valley church, which he founded after a serious
motorcycle accident five years ago.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>AMANDA COVARRUBIAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After a 1997 motorcycle accident left him with a broken back and a
crushed leg, Richard Fish embarked on a new journey.</LD>
<LD>   "I was a mess," said Fish, 38. "I heard the Lord speak to me that
night. He said, 'You're going to be a minister,' and [told me that]
the name of my church would be Live Ride."</LD>
<LD>   Five years later, Fish is an ordained minister with his own
church, located in a Simi Valley strip mall, where leather, tattoos
and Harleys are welcomed.</LD>
<TE>   This is a church where Christian services are held on Saturday, so
they don't conflict with popular Sunday morning ride times.</TE>
<TE>   The atmosphere is come-as-you-are casual--no such thing as "Sunday
best" here. The parking lot is so crowded with black metal and chrome
that passersby often mistake it for some kind of outlaw hangout.</TE>
<TE>   "Some people see all the bikes in the parking lot and think it's a
place where they can score some drugs," said Fish, who has overcome
his own battles with alcohol and drug abuse. "We had one guy come in
with $1,000 in his wallet, ready to buy some [cocaine]. But they come
here and get saved."</TE>
<TE>   The 150-member congregation--mostly bikers--has found a spiritual
home at the church, a close-knit community where people are not
judged and pasts are left behind.</TE>
<TE>   "This church is for square pegs," said parishioner Jim Barros, who
wore a black leather vest, black T-shirt and dark jeans to a recent
service. "It's a hospital for sinners as opposed to a sanctuary for
saints."</TE>
<TE>   The mission of the church is praised by other religious leaders in
Simi Valley.</TE>
<TE>   "Rick [Fish] deals with a type of person all churches want to
reach out to but really don't know how to," said Kevin Dieckilman,
pastor at Simi Hills Christian Church.</TE>
<TE>   "Live Ride crosses both gender and cultural boundaries. There are
people there in suits and ties, as well as bikers. It's one of the
truest examples of what Christ had in mind in building a church and
reaching out to all types of people."</TE>
<TE>   Fish runs the Live Ride Christian Church with his wife, Joye.
Their four children are often in the sanctuary when Fish conducts
Saturday night services in front of a mural depicting two
leather-clad bikers riding into the sunset past a skull-shaped hill
topped with three crosses.</TE>
<TE>   People sway and raise their arms to the music played by the Live
Ride Band, whose bluesy, Christian rock often brings the congregation
to its feet. Some worshipers, including Fish, close their eyes as the
music washes over them.</TE>
<TE>   As the service begins, Fish, wearing a black shirt with red flames
across the bottom, slowly makes his way to the front. During his
sermon, he refers to his life-changing motorcycle accident, using it
as a lesson in how one can be redeemed.</TE>
<TE>   "God grabbed me in the midst of destruction and said, 'I'm going
to save you, and you're going to make an impact on people's lives,' "
Fish said during a service last month. "I was saved from the depths
of fire and you can be, too.</TE>
<TE>   "Some of you backslide," he said. "You let life beat you up and
let the enemy slip under your skin. But it doesn't have to be that
way."</TE>
<TE>   Aside from services, church activities are a mix of the usual and
the slightly offbeat. Live Ride offers Bible study, a youth ministry
and "fellowship rides"--Fish rides with a group of local pastors who
call themselves Bikers of the Cloth.</TE>
<TE>   "We deal with a lot of intimate, personal problems that people
bring to us," Fish said. "Sometimes you need to get away from it all,
and riding is a good release."</TE>
<TE>   Church members said they appreciate the all-accepting atmosphere.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no egos," said Amy Krowpomar, a Newbury Park chef who
regularly attends services with her husband and their two young
children.</TE>
<TE>   Although not a biker herself, Krowpomar said she's always been
attracted to the lifestyle and once worked for Easyriders magazine.
For that reason, she's chosen to worship at Live Ride instead of a
more traditional church.</TE>
<TE>   "It's just one big family," said Krowpomar, who kicked off her
sandals during a recent service and swayed to the music.</TE>
<TE>   Santa Clarita resident Helen Duncan said she attends services
whenever she visits friends in Simi Valley.</TE>
<TE>   "I can lift my hands, do whatever I want. No one cares," Duncan
said. "People who are broken, people with tattoos, or whatever, they
need to feel like they have a place to go."</TE>
<TE>   Fish received his degree in church ministry in 1994 at Pacific
Christian College in Fullerton, now Hope International University.</TE>
<TE>   After earning his ministry credential, he became a deacon at the
Christian Church of Thousand Oaks and told elders about his hope of
becoming an ordained minister. The elders agreed to sponsor his
ordination in 1996.</TE>
<TE>   Soon after, he became youth minister at Simi Hills Christian
Church and co-pastor of the fledgling Life Christian Church. His
motorcycle, street smarts and vaguely bad-boy image appealed to young
people.</TE>
<TE>   "I was the coolest youth minister in town," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The pastors at Life Christian held services in members' homes
until they could raise enough money to rent a local dance school for
weekly gatherings. After the accident, Fish broke off from Life
Christian with the blessing of church leaders to start Live Ride.</TE>
<TE>   He poured his insurance settlement money into the ministry and
held services at the dance school. Eventually, he raised enough money
through donations to lease the current space.</TE>
<TE>   Although money was tight, Fish said he never lost sight of his
dreams, working odd jobs until two years ago to make ends meet. Now
he and his family live on his $42,000 pastor's salary. The church's
operating expenses are paid through tithing, offerings and gifts, he
said.</TE>
<TE>   With Live Ride outgrowing its present location, Fish is in the
midst of a fund-raising campaign to purchase larger quarters. He will
soon hold a second service on Saturday nights.</TE>
<TE>   Mark Fisher has been with Fish from the beginning, as front man
for the Live Ride Band. He said people are drawn to Live Ride because
it fills a need unmet by more mainstream churches.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know if it's a fear, because they look a little rough, or
if it's a lack of awareness," said Fisher, safety director for a
plumbing company. "All I know is people love coming to this place. We
provide an atmosphere where people can feel good without fear of
condemnation."</TE>
<TE>   Fish puts it more bluntly.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a church where bikers are welcome, where people drive by
and say, 'That looks like my kind of church.' This is the
come-as-you-are party. But we're serious about God."</TE>

<DH>Development: City Council to consider 156-unit plan where

<DL></DL>
<LD>In time-honored Orange County fashion, the last large piece of
farmland in Santa Ana will probably give way soon to a gated
community, joined by a cathedral, high school and YMCA.</LD>
<LD>   The 90-acre parcel on the city's southern flank is mostly furrowed
dirt. The yellow clapboard church not far from the property hints at
a lifestyle nearly erased in a county once heavily agrarian.</LD>
<LD>   The development plan for the homes, to be considered by the City
Council on Monday night, calls for houses of four or more bedrooms,
more like fast-growing South County, with prices expected to top
$600,000, a big stretch for most Santa Ana residents.</LD>
<TE>   In an area where the median home price is about $372,000, the 2000
census shows that 88% of the city's households have incomes of less
than $50,000. But city officials say the higher-priced homes are
important for the mix in a town that too often gets a bad rap for
being a sea of poverty.</TE>
<TE>   Planning Commissioner Glenn Mondo said the development can provide
"move-up housing for people who want to stay in the city, or attract
people from outside."</TE>
<TE>   Santa Ana already has plenty of affordable housing, said Mondo,
who is among the majority of planning commissioners who approved the
project and forwarded it to the City Council for the final OK.</TE>
<TE>   "We are already doing more than our fair share," Mondo said of
affordable housing. "This is a diverse city and we need a diverse
housing stock."</TE>
<TE>   The homes will replace lima beans that have long been the yield on
the old Armstrong Ranch. The land encompassing the homes and the
other projects is bordered by MacArthur Boulevard, Greenville Street,
Alton Avenue and Bear Street.</TE>
<TE>   Tustin resident Barbara Armstrong Phillips said the farm was
developed by her grandfather, a Civil War veteran who helped build
the yellow clapboard Greenville Country Church, the longest
continuously operating Protestant church in Orange County.</TE>
<TE>   The family farm once produced alfalfa, corn and tomatoes, then
switched to lima beans. In 1931, the Armstrongs sold the 90-acre
property to the Segerstrom farming family, Phillips said. The
Segerstroms bought adjacent parcels in 1936 and 1955, said David
Wilson, a spokesman for C.J. Segerstrom &amp; Sons, which owns and
operates South Coast Plaza.</TE>
<TE>   If approved by the council as expected, developer Shea Homes plans
to build 156 houses ranging from 3,100 to 3,800 square feet on lots
of 6,000 square feet.</TE>
<TE>   The Roman Catholic Diocese of Orange is buying 16 acres in hopes
of winning city approval for a cathedral with a 45,000-square-foot
parish hall and 24,000-square-foot administration building.</TE>
<TE>   The remaining land is expected to be the campus for Segerstrom
High School, named for the family that developed much of south Santa
Ana and north Costa Mesa. The Segerstrom company also plans to donate
2 acres for a YMCA.</TE>
<TE>   There is widespread support for the housing plan, from the City
Council to affordable-housing advocates who all say Santa Ana has
done more than other area cities to provide low-cost housing.</TE>
<TE>   "It's unfair to look at the City Council in the city of Santa Ana
and ask for more affordable housing," said Helen Brown, president of
Civic Center Barrio Housing Corp., a Santa Ana nonprofit
organization. Santa Ana "is housing the majority of the entire
service sector for the county of Orange. I cannot rag on them for a
few luxury homes. It's just one bean field."</TE>
<TE>   Councilman Jose Solorio, who said he plans to vote for the
project, lamented the extinction of the farmland, one of the last
major pieces of undeveloped property in the city.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a bit sad, but it is exciting that that large a parcel will
have a new dynamic life that will impact our future forever," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Only Planning Commissioner Chris Leo has gone on record opposing
the project.</TE>
<TE>   "The developer had submitted apartments, condominiums and attached
homes; [the plan] ended up coming to us with none of that," Leo said.
"Where are people going to live? I'm not even talking about
low-income. I'm talking about firefighters, nurses, teachers. Not
only are they good to have in the community, but they get involved in
community activities. It's hard to conceive how we can allow
construction of these kind of homes."</TE>
<TE>   The property's zoning initially permitted development of
multiple-family homes. But Cindy Nelson, deputy city manager for
development services, said the provision was eliminated "because the
council was only seeking to see single-family housing on the site."</TE>
<TE>   "We can have areas for everybody," Nelson added.</TE>
<TE>   Bob Yoder, Shea Homes vice president, said his company was open to
building multiple-family dwellings, but went along with city
officials' preferences. "You have to meet the objectives of the
city."</TE>
<TE>   Yoder, who builds so-called infill housing developments that are
increasingly in demand in older cities, said he is convinced there
are plenty of families who will buy the houses to be near their jobs
and shopping. "We think the location is phenomenal because of the
convenience."</TE>
<TE>   If approved, construction could begin early next year, Yoder said.</TE>
<TE>   Real estate agent Phil Schaefer, one of a number of agents who
specialize in vintage homes in the city's higher-priced north end,
said only a dozen or so Santa Ana residential properties have sold
for more than $600,000 in the last 12 months. Still, he thinks people
will snap up the Armstrong Ranch homes.</TE>
<TE>   "They will sell because they are gated, they are near South Coast
Plaza and they are new," Schaefer said.</TE>

<HD>Faithful Giver Receives Accolades for Years of  Serving the
Homeless</HD>
<DH>Charity: Well-wishers honor Gloria Kim for feeding and
clothing the needy around L.A.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIKA HAYASAKI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Calling her an angel, a friend, a servant of God, nearly 50
well-wishers gathered Saturday in Koreatown to honor 61-year-old
Gloria Kim, a petite minister who serves up hot meals to dozens of
homeless people daily.</LD>
<LD>   For 16 years, Kim has awakened at 2 a.m. each day to pray, cook
and make her rounds across the city, feeding the homeless. Her
service drew praise from those who attended the anniversary
celebration of Kim's nonprofit Zion Gospel Missionary Church at 3113
W. Venice Blvd.</LD>
<LD>   Several homeless people, a gospel singing group from South Central
Los Angeles, a Korean businessman and a handful of local volunteers
and philanthropists expressed their gratitude.</LD>
<TE>   "She comes and finds me wherever I am," said Tanya Holland, 50, a
homeless woman who has known Kim since 1985. "She wakes up every day,
whether she is tired or sick. I think she gets her energy from us. I
just pray there are more people like her."</TE>
<TE>   In 1998, Kim used her personal savings and donations to buy the
two-room church building, which houses the mission, her soup kitchen
and a shower facility for the homeless.</TE>
<TE>   After a two-hour prayer service Saturday, five singers and four
musicians called the Mighty, Mighty Travelers performed in front of
the church. Homeless people took turns showering in the back bathroom
and were given socks, towels and clothes. Others picked through piles
of blouses, sneakers, sweaters and purses. They also received fruit,
bagels and cups of homemade soup.</TE>
<TE>   Kim, who turned her life over to religion 20 years ago, immigrated
from South Korea in 1976 and first worked as a nurse in Florida. In
1984, she moved with her mother, Mok Lim Kim, to Los Angeles, and the
two began their mission for the homeless out of a Koreatown garage
they rented and lived in. Her mother died in 1990, but Kim continued
the work, relying on donations and volunteers.</TE>
<TE>   "I believe in her 100%," said pastor Billy Watkins of the Freedom
of Spirit Church in South Central Los Angeles. "She's faithful to
every alley, every curb, every street. We love her."</TE>
<TE>   Watkins said he met Kim 20 years ago at his congregation. There
were times, Watkins remembered, when Kim carried her mother into his
church on her back because the elderly woman was too fragile and ill
to walk on her own.</TE>
<TE>   Kim has long been a familiar face to the homeless in MacArthur
Park, Lafayette Park, Koreatown, Griffith Park and downtown Los
Angeles. After an article about her mission appeared in The Times in
January, donations poured in from across the state.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, she has collected several thousand dollars, along with
food, clothing and supplies. A handful of volunteers now regularly
works at the mission. She saved enough money to buy a used Toyota
pickup truck, with the mission's logo printed on its side and a white
Toyota van. Both vehicles are used to deliver food and clothes to the
homeless. Before, she delivered the goods in a beaten-up blue Dodge
van.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a miracle from God," Kim told the crowd Saturday. "Every
day, I receive so many blessings."</TE>
<TE>   Kelly Erwin, 42, a Studio City resident who works in a recording
studio in Hollywood, said she regularly sends money or clothes.</TE>
<TE>   "I like Gloria's operation because it is hands on," she said. "I
know if I send money, it's going to go straight back to the streets.
She touched me because it is not corporate, it is grass roots."</TE>
<TE>   Won Ung Cho traveled from South Korea last week to attend the
event.</TE>
<TE>   He has known Kim for 25 years and said that, even back in South
Korea, she had helped those less fortunate by providing them with
food and clothes.</TE>
<TE>   "She loves the poor, the needy, the homeless," he said. "From
early morning to the night she helps, without care for herself."</TE>
<TE>   After the celebration, at 3 p.m., Kim gathered several bowls of
vegetables and fruit, bags of bread and a crock pot full of hot soup,
and once again set off on her route.</TE>

<HD>New Laws Cover Wide Range of Subjects</HD>

<AU>NANCY VOGEL and CARL INGRAM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In 2002, state lawmakers introduced 2,554 bills and resolutions. Of
those, 1,116 died in the Legislature. The governor signed 1,173
measures, vetoed 264 and allowed one to become law without his
signature. Here are highlights of those actions, by subject.</LD>
<LD>   Abortion</LD>
<LD>   Davis and the Legislature enacted a law that aims to preserve the
right to an abortion in California even if federal rights are
weakened. The "Reproductive Privacy Act" makes the state's scattered
statutes referring to abortion consistent with the Supreme Court's
Roe vs. Wade decision.</LD>
<TE>   The governor also signed bills to keep abortion clinic workers'
addresses private, guarantee sexual assault victims access to
emergency contraception and make it a crime to threaten or attack
abortion clinics. A fifth new law reinforces a requirement that
obstetrics and gynecology training programs teach students how to
perform an abortion. Students may opt out on religious or ethical
grounds.</TE>
<TE>   Consumers</TE>
<TE>   The Legislature and governor toughened restrictions on the payday
loan industry.</TE>
<TE>   Typically, these loans are a short-term advance in which a
borrower writes a check for $100 to $300. It is held by the lender
and not cashed until the borrower's next payday. However, substantial
charges and fees and high interest rates can be imposed, which,
critics argue, keep the borrower in debt for long periods.</TE>
<TE>   Effective Jan. 1, payday loan companies will be regulated by the
Department of Corporations in the same way other financial
institutions are regulated. Additional restrictions will be imposed,
including prohibiting a charge for merely opening an account. Also,
the industry will pay substantially higher regulatory fees.</TE>
<TE>   A new law will require calling-card companies to disclose certain
hidden charges and fees and will require that consumer information be
printed in languages other than English.</TE>
<TE>   One key bill would have required financial institutions to get
consent before disclosing a consumer's private information to other
enterprises, including affiliates.</TE>
<TE>   The bill, fought by major national businesses, was passed by the
Senate but so weakened in the Assembly that the author, Sen. Jackie
Speier (D-Hillsborough), killed it.</TE>
<TE>   Crime</TE>
<TE>   As an offshoot of the Rampart police scandal, a new law will
require that a felon sentenced to death or life without parole can
get access to evidence that may have been false.</TE>
<TE>   The legislation was introduced in response to Los Angeles cases in
which convicted felons were voluntarily freed by the district
attorney and courts because their convictions depended heavily on the
testimony of law enforcement officers that turned out to be false.</TE>
<TE>   For inmates in custody, habeas corpus procedures have long been of
assistance. But until now, there was no remedy in California law that
enabled someone who had been freed to return to court and seek to
reverse a fraudulent conviction.</TE>
<TE>   Amid concerns over terrorism, the Legislature also approved and
Davis signed a bill that extends until 2008 the state law authorizing
law enforcement to place wiretaps on telephones and other
communication devices.</TE>
<TE>   Education</TE>
<TE>   Unlike in recent sessions in which the Legislature and governor
enacted major education initiatives, lawmakers in 2002 generally
preferred to fine-tune earlier reforms. However, the year was not
without controversy.</TE>
<TE>   The California Teachers Assn.'s top-priority bill would have
created "academic partnerships" between teachers unions and school
district officials to make decisions jointly on the operation of
public schools. The bill also proposed giving the unions a voice in
the selection of textbooks and other instructional materials, a
provision that critics, including Davis, said went too far.</TE>
<TE>   The bill was stopped in its tracks in the Assembly when the
governor warned that he would veto it. The Legislature undertook a
major reform of the charter schools system, clamping new fiscal
accountability standards on such schools, which can operate outside
the statutory and regulatory systems required of regular public
schools.</TE>
<TE>   Supporters of the bill said the need for tighter standards for
charter schools was dramatized by operations at Gateway Charter
Academy, which ran multiple satellite campuses far from its Fresno
headquarters.</TE>
<TE>   Gateway's charter was revoked when education authorities
discovered that the recently opened school had piled up $1 million in
debts in a single year, hired employees with criminal records and
recruited teachers without credentials.</TE>
<TE>   The new law will establish tighter fiscal controls, including the
requirement that charter schools each year file a financial statement
to the officials who approved its charter. In applying for a charter,
such schools also will be required to detail how they intend to keep
parents informed of the transferability of courses and whether the
courses meet college eligibility requirements.</TE>
<TE>   Energy</TE>
<TE>   Private utilities must increase by 1% a year the share of
electricity they sell that comes from the sun, wind and geothermal
heat. The ultimate goal is to reach 20% from such sources by 2017
under a law enacted by Davis.</TE>
<TE>   Public utilities such as the Los Angeles Department of Water and
Power can set their own targets.</TE>
<TE>   The private utilities may tap a $135-million fund to offset the
cost of the "green" power, which tends to be more expensive than that
produced by burning natural gas. The subsidy comes from a charge that
amounts to roughly $2 a month for the average residential utility
customer.</TE>
<TE>   The governor also enacted legislation to make it easier for
private utilities to sign long-term electricity contracts. A lack of
such contracts worsened the electricity crisis of 2000-01. When power
prices rose, the utilities were forced to buy from the costly spot
market. The new law aims to return Pacific Gas &amp; Electric, Southern
California Edison and San Diego Gas &amp; Electric--by the end of this
year--to their historic task of buying electricity.</TE>
<TE>   Environment</TE>
<TE>   Davis won national and worldwide attention when he signed a bill
requiring the Air Resources Board to set limits on car and truck
tailpipe emissions of greenhouse gases, primarily carbon dioxide, for
the first time.</TE>
<TE>   Resisted mightily by the auto industry, the new law requires
vehicles sold in California starting in 2009 to achieve a "maximum
feasible reduction" in emission of gases that trap heat in the
atmosphere. Proponents say that technology to reduce such emissions
already exists and that the law will result in more fuel-efficient
cars and trucks.</TE>
<TE>   The governor also acted to prevent the expiration of hundreds of
offers by private landowners to provide public access to California's
1,100-mile coast. Many offers are nearing the end of their 21-year
terms. The Coastal Conservancy, a state agency, must accept the
offers.</TE>
<TE>   Another new law requires state regulators to solicit the input of
low-income and minority communities when they decide where to locate
future landfills.</TE>
<TE>   Davis vetoed a bill that would have imposed a $10 tax on
televisions and computer monitors to pay for recycling and public
education programs. Each monitor contains several pounds of lead and
other potentially toxic materials and cannot legally be disposed of
in landfills. In a veto message, Davis urged electronic equipment
makers to devise recycling solutions.</TE>
<TE>   Gay Rights</TE>
<TE>   Davis signed into law a measure that gives gays who lose a
domestic partner the same inheritance rights as married heterosexuals
who lose a spouse. But he vetoed a bill that would have banned
discrimination against gay youths in foster care and required gay and
lesbian sensitivity training for foster parents.</TE>
<TE>   Health</TE>
<TE>   Davis challenged the Bush administration with a new law that
encourages stem-cell research in California.</TE>
<TE>   Scientists say the cells, which can divide and become any kind of
cell in the body, may hold the cure to such diseases as Parkinson's
and cancer. But anti-abortion groups oppose stem-cell research
because it involves the destruction of a human embryo. President Bush
has restricted federal funding for stem-cell research, and the issue
divides Congress.</TE>
<TE>   While several state legislatures have banned research involving
human embryos, California is the first to encourage it. The governor
also enacted a law that allows judges, after a hearing, to order the
treatment of seriously mentally ill people against their will.
Backers called it "Laura's law," after a 19-year-old Nevada County
woman killed by a man whose mental illness had gone untreated.</TE>
<TE>   Before people can be forced into treatment, a judge must find that
they have histories of failing to comply with treatment and have
demonstrated "serious violent" behavior against others or themselves.</TE>
<TE>   Davis vetoed a bill that would have allowed adults to buy
hypodermic needles without a prescription. Proponents said the bill
would have limited the spread of disease among drug users, but the
governor said it would have undermined official needle exchange
programs.</TE>
<TE>   Other new health laws require health-care providers to give
patients appointments and referrals in a timely manner and ban health
insurers from forcing doctors to take on more patients than they can
reasonably handle.</TE>
<TE>   Insurance</TE>
<TE>   The governor vetoed a bill that would have allowed automobile
insurers to offer discounts to customers who have continuously
purchased coverage. Those ineligible for the discount would have paid
higher rates. Sponsored by Mercury Insurance Group of Los Angeles,
which has contributed to most members of the Legislature, the bill
would have reversed a decision by Insurance Commissioner Harry Low.</TE>
<TE>   Tens of thousands of poor people in San Francisco and Los Angeles
counties will qualify for discount automobile insurance under a new
law. The expansion of the discount program reduces the cost of a
policy from $450 to $347 a year in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Transportation</TE>
<TE>   The governor signed a law to let voters decide in 2004 whether to
spend $9.9 billion building a bullet train that would whisk riders
between Los Angeles and San Francisco in two hours.</TE>
<TE>   He also enacted legislation to allow the Orange County
Transportation Authority to buy 10 miles of privately owned express
lanes on the Riverside Freeway between Anaheim and Corona. The new
law clears the way for $1.6 billion in upgrades to the highway. It
ends a toll-road experiment in which the California Department of
Transportation gave a private company the power to veto improvements
along a 30-mile stretch of the freeway until 2030.</TE>

<HD>Victim's Family Frustrated by Unsolved Blast at O.C. Arab
Site</HD>
<DH>Crime: Brother of anti- discrimination activist slain in
'85 doubts FBI will find the bomber.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>H.G. REZA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The wheels of justice have turned slowly for Sami Odeh, and after 17
years of waiting, he is losing hope the FBI will ever solve his
brother's slaying.</LD>
<LD>   Alex Odeh died Oct. 11, 1985, after a bomb exploded as he opened
the front door to the Arab-American Anti-Discrimination Committee
headquarters in Santa Ana, where he served as West Coast chairman.</LD>
<LD>   Authorities say they continue to chase leads in the case and that
the pace has quickened since last year's terrorist attacks. Alex
Odeh's name has come up repeatedly during meetings between U.S. law
enforcement officials and national leaders of the Arab American group
in Washington.</LD>
<TE>   But there has been little for Odeh's family to hang their hopes
on. Theirs has been a quest fueled by suspicion, rumor and attempts
to squeeze meaning from vague FBI comments.</TE>
<TE>   A man now serving a life term for the bombing death of a woman in
Manhattan Beach, for instance, was mentioned as a possible suspect
more than 15 years ago. But he has never been charged.</TE>
<TE>   The man's wife was listed as a probable witness in Alex Odeh's
killing. But she died of a heart attack several years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Two other possible suspects live on the West Bank, Sami Odeh said
he has been told. But he knows little else.</TE>
<TE>   Last summer, the lead agents in the case traveled to Israel, but
Odeh said they declined to tell him whether the trip was related to
his brother's killing.</TE>
<TE>   Frustrated by the lack of progress yet intrigued by the clues he
has been left to piece together, Odeh wonders--in his darkest
hours--whether his brother's case is being taken seriously anymore.</TE>
<TE>   "For the past 17 years the FBI has told me that the case is still
open and under investigation," said Sami Odeh, a real estate agent
from Orange. "I find it very hard to believe that with all our
resources, the killers haven't been brought to justice."</TE>
<TE>   On the day of the bombing, Alex Odeh had gone to his second-floor
East 17th Street office early to work on a speech he was going to
give later that day at a Fountain Valley synagogue. The night before,
he had appeared on a local nighttime news program where he called
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat a man of peace.</TE>
<TE>   The bomb, rigged to explode when the door opened, ripped apart the
office and injured seven others in the building. Alex Odeh died two
hours after the blast.</TE>
<TE>   A Palestinian and Roman Catholic whose family had moved from
Palestine to escape the violence, the 41-year-old was an outspoken
opponent of Israeli policies against Palestinians. He led
demonstrations in front of the Israeli consulate in Los Angeles,
where Arabs frequently clashed with members of the Jewish Defense
League.</TE>
<TE>   The protests had led to threats against Alex Odeh and his
organization, authorities said at the time. Yet his family said he
never openly worried for his safety.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators said they believe it is likely that Alex Odeh wasn't
even the intended target, that the bombing was a terrorist-style
attack on the Arab committee.</TE>
<TE>   Officials at the committee's office in Washington said little
ground has been gained in the investigation over the years, but
tracking the case remains a priority for them.</TE>
<TE>   "It's an issue that continuously comes up when we sit down with
them and they ask what's on our mind," said Hussein Ibish, spokesman
for the committee. "We're frustrated, but there's not much we can do
to shift the FBI into action."</TE>
<TE>   Steven Berry, FBI spokesman in Washington, declined to comment
about the investigation.</TE>
<TE>   The investigation is being conducted by agents from the Los
Angeles Joint Terrorist Task Force, which includes the FBI. Laura
Bosley, FBI spokeswoman in Los Angeles, said Alex Odeh's death "is a
case that's being worked on." But she conceded there are few leads
and no firm suspects.</TE>
<TE>   What frustrates Sami Odeh and committee officials is that
convicted bomber and former Jewish Defense League member Robert
Manning emerged as a possible suspect about three years after the
Santa Ana bombing. Federal sources told The Times in 1988 that
Manning and three others, all living in Israel at the time, were
involved in the killing.</TE>
<TE>   The FBI has never publicly identified Manning as a suspect.
Federal sources also said his wife, Rochelle Ida Manning, had a
"peripheral role" in the bombing but, like her husband, was never a
named suspect.</TE>
<TE>   As the years have passed, Sami Odeh said his hopes are fading that
those responsible for his brother's death will ever be brought to
justice. "I try to think good about the FBI. I believe the two agents
on the case have their hearts in the case. I want to believe my
government," Odeh said. "But after 17 years of them telling me this
is a top priority, well, it's getting harder to believe them."</TE>

<DH>Arab Victim's Family Frustrated by Unsolved Santa Ana Blast</DH>

<AU>H.G. REZA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The wheels of justice have turned slowly for Sami Odeh, and after 17
years of waiting, he is losing hope the FBI will ever solve his
brother's slaying.</LD>
<LD>   Alex Odeh died Oct. 11, 1985, after a bomb exploded as he opened
the front door to the Arab-American Anti-Discrimination Committee
headquarters in Santa Ana, where he served as West Coast chairman.</LD>
<LD>   Authorities say they continue to chase leads in the case and that
the pace has quickened since last year's terrorist attacks. Alex
Odeh's name has come up repeatedly during meetings between U.S. law
enforcement officials and national leaders of the Arab American group
in Washington.</LD>
<TE>   But there has been little for Odeh's family to hang their hopes
on. Theirs has been a quest fueled by suspicion, rumor and attempts
to squeeze meaning from vague FBI comments.</TE>
<TE>   A man now serving a life term for the bombing death of a woman in
Manhattan Beach, for instance, was mentioned as a possible suspect
more than 15 years ago. But he has never been charged.</TE>
<TE>   The man's wife was listed as a probable witness in Alex Odeh's
killing. But she died of a heart attack several years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Two other possible suspects live on the West Bank, Sami Odeh said
he has been told. But he knows little else, not even their names.</TE>
<TE>   Last summer, the lead agents in the case traveled to Israel, but
Odeh said they declined to tell him whether the trip was related to
his brother's killing.</TE>
<TE>   Frustrated by the lack of progress yet intrigued by the clues he
has been left to piece together, Odeh wonders--in his darkest
hours--whether his brother's case is being taken seriously anymore.</TE>
<TE>   "For the past 17 years the FBI has told me that the case is still
open and under investigation," said Sami Odeh, a real estate agent in
Orange. "I find it very hard to believe that with all our resources,
the killers haven't been brought to justice."</TE>
<TE>   On the day of the bombing, Alex Odeh had gone to his second-floor
East 17th Street office early to work on a speech he was going to
give later that day at a Fountain Valley synagogue. The night before,
he had appeared on a local nighttime news program and called
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat a man of peace.</TE>
<TE>   The bomb, rigged to explode when the door opened, ripped apart the
office and injured seven others in the building. Alex Odeh died two
hours after the blast.</TE>
<TE>   A Palestinian and Roman Catholic whose family had moved from
Palestine to escape the violence, the 41-year-old was an outspoken
opponent of Israeli policies against Palestinians. He led
demonstrations in front of the Israeli consulate in Los Angeles,
where Arabs frequently clashed with members of the Jewish Defense
League.</TE>
<TE>   The protests had led to threats against Alex Odeh and his
organization, authorities said at the time. Yet his family said he
never openly worried for his safety.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators said they believe it is likely that Alex Odeh wasn't
even the intended target, that the bombing was a terrorist-style
attack on the Arab committee.</TE>
<TE>   Officials at the committee's office in Washington said little
ground has been gained in the investigation over the years, but
tracking the case remains a priority for them.</TE>
<TE>   "It's an issue that continuously comes up when we sit down with
them and they ask what's on our mind," said Hussein Ibish, spokesman
for the committee. "We're frustrated, but there's not much we can do
to shift the FBI into action."</TE>
<TE>   Steven Berry, FBI spokesman in Washington, declined to comment on
the investigation.</TE>
<TE>   The investigation is being conducted by agents from the Los
Angeles Joint Terrorist Task Force, which includes the FBI. Laura
Bosley, FBI spokeswoman in Los Angeles, said Alex Odeh's death "is a
case that's being worked on." But she conceded there are few leads
and no firm suspects.</TE>
<TE>   What frustrates Sami Odeh and committee officials is that
convicted bomber and former Jewish Defense League member Robert
Manning emerged as a possible suspect about three years after the
Santa Ana bombing. Federal sources told The Times in 1988 that
Manning and three others, all living in Israel at the time, were
involved in the killing.</TE>
<TE>   The FBI has never publicly identified Manning as a suspect.
Federal sources also said his wife, Rochelle Ida Manning, had a
"peripheral role" in the bombing but, like her husband, was never a
named suspect.</TE>
<TE>   Ibish said his group recently was told by the FBI there are two
suspects still living in Israel, but their extradition has not been
requested for diplomatic and political reasons.</TE>
<TE>   "It's an awkward situation for the FBI. They've told us two people
living in Israeli settlements on the West Bank have relevant
information. But the West Bank is an occupied territory, and we've
been told that if we ask for their extradition it would be the same
as recognizing Israel's sovereignty there," Ibish said.</TE>
<TE>   State Department spokesman Duncan Maciness said "the West Bank has
never been declared officially a part of Israel," suggesting that the
U.S. extradition treaty does not extend to the West Bank or other
occupied areas. Manning, originally from Los Angeles, had dual
U.S.-Israeli citizenship and was living in Israel with his wife when
he was extradited in 1991 for the 1980 bombing death of Patricia
Wilkerson in Manhattan Beach. His wife, Rochelle, was tried for
Wilkerson's death in 1988, but her trial ended in a hung jury.</TE>
<TE>   After she returned to Israel, she was arrested pending extradition
to U.S. for her second trial in the Wilkerson death. She fought
extradition for three years before dying in prison.</TE>
<TE>   Wilkerson, a secretary at Prowest Computer Corp, had opened a
package addressed to her boss and was killed when it exploded.
Prosecutors alleged that the Mannings were hired to do the bombing by
a JDL member who had a business dispute with Wilkerson's boss.</TE>
<TE>   Manning was convicted in Wilkerson's murder in 1993 and sentenced
to life in prison. Now serving his sentence at a federal prison in
Victorville, he turned down a request for an interview.</TE>
<TE>   At the time of his extradition, the FBI declined to publicly say
whether it thought he was involved in Alex Odeh's slaying, though
other U.S. law enforcement officials had privately identified Manning
as a suspect.</TE>
<TE>   As the years have passed, Sami Odeh said, his hopes are fading
that those responsible for his brother's death--whether in Israel,
the U.S. or someplace else--will ever be brought to justice. "I try
to think good about the FBI. I believe the two agents on the case
have their hearts in the case. I want to believe my government," Odeh
said. "But after 17 years of them telling me this is a top priority,
well, it's getting harder to believe them."</TE>

<DH>Lawsuit: Northridge woman will give money won in
discrimination case to youths in India.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TRACY WILSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After collecting a $150,000 federal court settlement, Prabha Rao
could have splurged for a new car or put a down payment on a new
home.</LD>
<LD>   But she had other ideas.</LD>
<LD>   Last weekend, the 52-year-old former probation officer boarded a
plane for India with plans to give the money she received in a racial
discrimination lawsuit against Ventura County to organizations
benefiting orphans.</LD>
<TE>   Specifically, she intends to use the funds to educate girls in
Calcutta, where Rao grew up and her family still lives. And she hopes
to travel to the western state of Gujarat to funnel money to children
abandoned during a bloody conflict between Hindus and Muslims earlier
this year that left more than 1,000 dead.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel very fortunate that I have an education," Rao said. "I'd
like to share that with other children not as fortunate as me."</TE>
<TE>   Rao, who lives in Northridge with her husband, said she sued the
county not for money but to force an admission of wrongdoing after
she was denied promotions--on the basis of race, she believes.</TE>
<TE>   Rao worked for the probation agency for 19 years, handling adult
and juvenile cases. She was elevated to a senior probation officer
during her seventh year on the job and wanted to become a supervisor.
But the goal eluded her.</TE>
<TE>   In 1991, after a decade with the agency, Rao began to attend law
school classes at night, in part, she said, to improve her chances at
advancement. She passed the state bar exam in 1995.</TE>
<TE>   In January 1997, Rao interviewed for a supervisory position. She
had worked for the agency for 16 years at that point and had a
master's degree in English literature, in addition to her law degree.
She felt confident she was a strong candidate. But the job went to
someone else.</TE>
<TE>   She questioned whether race played a role in the decision and her
supervisor denied any discrimination, she said.</TE>
<TE>   But after other promotions passed her by, Rao said, she filed a
complaint with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission. It was
the first of two grievances she would bring against the probation
agency. After a two-year investigation, the EEOC found that Rao was
denied a promotion on the basis of her race and national origin.</TE>
<TE>   But a promotion still didn't come. In November 2000 she retired,
and a few months later she filed a racial discrimination lawsuit
against her former employer.</TE>
<TE>   In July of this year, Rao accepted the county's offer of $150,000,
and U.S. District Court Judge John F. Walter entered a judgment in
her favor.</TE>
<TE>   Oxnard attorney Philip Erickson, who represented the county, said
the settlement was not an admission of wrongdoing.</TE>

had worked for the agency for 16 years at that point and had a
master's degree in English literature, in addition to her law degree.</TE>
<TE>   She felt confident she was a strong candidate. But the job went to
someone else. "I felt very hurt," Rao said. "My education and
experience were really irrelevant."</TE>
<TE>   She questioned whether race played a role in the decision and her
supervisor denied any discrimination, she said. But after other
promotions passed her by, Rao said, she filed a complaint with the
federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.</TE>
<TE>   It was the first of two grievances she would bring against the
probation agency.</TE>
<TE>   After a two-year investigation, the EEOC found that Rao was denied
a promotion on the basis of her race and national origin.</TE>
<TE>   But a promotion still didn't come. In November 2000 she retired,
and a few months later she filed a racial discrimination lawsuit
against her former employer.</TE>
<TE>   "We defended it vigorously," said Oxnard attorney Philip Erickson,
who represented the county in the suit</TE>
<TE>   Regardless of the EEOC decision, Erickson said, probation records
showed that women and minorities had been promoted within the agency.</TE>
<TE>   Two of three top deputies in the department are women.</TE>
<TE>   In Rao's case, Erickson said, the panelists who reviewed her
applications agreed that despite her experience and good performance
reviews, her interviews were poor.</TE>
<TE>   Erickson felt the county had a strong case. Nevertheless, he said,
settlement offers were made to avoid a costly trial.</TE>
<TE>   "She had maybe a 30% to 50% chance of prevailing," he said. "Under
those circumstances, we thought it would be in the best interest to
settle."</TE>
<TE>   In July of this year, Rao accepted the county's offer of $150,000,
and U.S. District Court Judge John F. Walter entered a judgment in
her favor.</TE>
<TE>   Oxnard attorney Philip Erickson, who represented the county, said
the settlement was not an admission of wrongdoing. Rao disagrees.</TE>
<TE>   "I do feel the message has gone through," she said. "Hopefully,
people will think about it so this doesn't happen again."</TE>
<TE>   Since her retirement, Rao has volunteered as a legal aid attorney
in Los Angeles County.</TE>
<TE>   She plans to spend the next four months in India, traveling,
visiting family and finding a nonprofit group that can help her get
money to children in Gujarat.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a purpose to everything," said Rao, who does not have
children of her own.</TE>
<TE>   "I think our purpose is to help people. The purpose, maybe, for
me, is to do this."</TE>

<LD>   Organic choices made it onto the school lunch menu this year as
part of a fledgling effort to bring healthier, responsibly farmed
nutrition options to Palo Alto's elementary schools--a project
spearheaded by local parents, politicians and a prominent Bay Area
restaurateur. Despite a somewhat rocky start, they hope the effort
will become a model for other school districts.</LD>
<LD>   The quality of school lunches has received renewed attention in
recent years, as childhood obesity and diabetes rates have spiked
nationwide. A state law signed last year, set to take effect in 2004,
will restrict high-fat, high-sugar foods at elementary and middle
schools and will limit the sale of sodas at middle schools to
non-school hours.</LD>
<TE>   In the Bay Area, where local farmers markets are so popular that
towns are often hard-pressed to find enough farmers to meet demand,
there is no shortage of adults who would rather see chicken-free soy
nuggets on the menu than BBQ rib sandwiches. But whether the kids
will go for it, and how much parents are actually willing to pay for
those choices, is unclear.</TE>
<TE>   Across San Francisco Bay at Berkeley High School, a year-old
program that allowed local restaurants to sell healthy lunches on
campus was recently canceled.</TE>
<TE>   The program drew celebrity chef Alice Waters from her nearby
restaurant Chez Panisse, but it was dropped last month for lack of
interest. High schoolers, it seemed, like their junk food.</TE>
<TE>   Despite that program's lack of success, the Berkeley Unified
School District is committed to move toward organic and locally
farmed products for its school lunch programs. "Whenever we can find
something affordable that is packaged in a way that makes sense for
the schools, we bring it in," said Karen Candito, Berkeley Unified's
nutrition services director.</TE>
<TE>   In Palo Alto, price has been an obstacle to the organic lunch
program's success. Although a special taste-test event last year drew
rave reviews, fewer than 10% of the lunches sold to elementary school
children are from the organic menu.</TE>
<TE>   The organic lunches were originally offered for $4.50, while the
regular school lunch is only $2.50. The price for organics was
quickly lowered to $2.50, in part because the district hasn't been
able to offer enough organic food options to put together a whole
lunch every day. Kids can get the organic entree a la carte, but no
organic side dishes are available.</TE>
<TE>   Not only is price a concern, but so is finding enough organic
choices to keep kids interested.</TE>
<TE>   Many organic food companies don't package or distribute their
products in a format that's practical for use in large-scale
food-service projects, said Alva Spence, the area manager for
Sodexho, the firm that provides food service for the Palo Alto
Unified School District.</TE>
<TE>   "It hasn't been easy," Spence said. "We've had to forge a little
bit of new territory to get some of these products in."</TE>
<TE>   So far, there are just enough organic entrees available to offer
something new each day of the week, from macaroni and cheese to bean
and rice burritos. Cool has been working closely with Spence to
identify products that might be incorporated into the district's
lunch program.</TE>
<TE>   "At this point we're just trying to test the waters and see what
we can do," Spence said. "Already there are a lot of districts asking
me questions. There's a lot of interest."</TE>
<TE>   Alex Tseng, a second-grader, said he doesn't know what organic
means, although he thinks it might be healthy. He just thought the
organic cheese lasagna sounded really good and he was able to
persuade his mother to let him have it.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't really follow organic food at home. I think it's good,
but it's quite expensive," said Alex's mother, Weili Tseng. "If they
can lower the price, I think maybe I'm going to let Alex have the
organic lunch."</TE>
<TE>   At school last Wednesday, Alex was indeed looking forward to his
special lunch. Alex waited patiently for what seemed like hours, and
when he reached the front of the lunch line he learned that pizza
pockets had been substituted for lasagna at the last minute. It was
fine with him; he likes those too.</TE>
<TE>   And then he realized something really cool. The price for organic
lunch had been lowered, and Alex found he had an extra dollar in his
hand. He quickly did the math and ordered up a package each of Oreo
cookies and Cheez-Its crackers to go with the pizza pocket, orange
and milk on his Styrofoam tray.</TE>
<TE>   The pizza pocket was a hit. "It tastes like tacos," he said.</TE>
<TE>   His only hurdle now was finishing it all up before the lunch hour
was over.</TE>

<HD>Beeps, Bleeps for Iraq War Protest</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>While President Bush made another pitch Saturday for congressional
approval of a resolution allowing U.S. military action against Iraq,
demonstrators in Costa Mesa called on the White House to scale back
its war rhetoric and find a peaceful resolution to its confrontation
with Saddam Hussein.</LD>
<LD>   About 75 protesters, including many who lived through every U.S.
war since 1941, lined the sidewalk on Bristol Street across from
South Coast Plaza carrying placards with such slogans as, "No blood
for oil" and "Regime change, Yes. Stop Bush."</LD>
<LD>   Dozens of passing drivers honked in approval of the demonstration,
but a few responded with obscene gestures or screams.</LD>
<TE>   "You ought to be shot!" yelled a male driver while waiting for the
traffic light to change.</TE>
<TE>   Grace Steiner, a World War II Army nurse and member of Veterans
for Peace, was not moved by the man's comments.</TE>
<TE>   "He ought to get educated on the issue. We're not against the
United States. We're saying that the president is making a grave
error. This obsession to get rid of Saddam is all about oil. I don't
think that's worth the life of a single young man or woman in our
military," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Dennis Clark, who was drafted and served with the 25th Infantry
Division in Vietnam, noted that except for Secretary of State Colin
Powell, many top government officials favoring a military strike
against Iraq avoided service during the Vietnam War. The 60-year-old
retired UCI Medical Center employee worked at a field hospital during
his year in Vietnam.</TE>
<TE>   "If I brought anything back from the war, it is that people have
to experience death to appreciate life. It's easy for [advocates of
war with Iraq] to push for this war. They'll stand on the sidelines
just like they did during Vietnam and let somebody else's son die for
the cause," Clark said.</TE>
<TE>   The comparison with Vietnam was also made by observers in a nearby
restaurant parking lot.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not unpatriotic to question the president and our
government," said Rose Hodges of Washington state, who said she was
in college during the Vietnam War. "Maybe if more older people had
questioned the government about Vietnam, there wouldn't have been so
many senseless deaths."</TE>
<TE>   But Lane Russell, a Navy veteran who said he served in Vietnam,
blamed antiwar demonstrations in that era for contributing to the
U.S. defeat.</TE>
<TE>   "They should've supported our troops, then and now," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Chuck Anderson, a member of the "No War on Iraq" committee that
led the demonstration, said talk of war is distracting from pressing
economic issues.</TE>
<TE>   "The president should be looking for ways to preserve people's
retirement money instead of looking for a way to get rid of Saddam,"
he said.</TE>

<HD>Sen. Clinton, Torres Stump for Davis</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEAN MERL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Gov. Gray Davis got a hand from two prominent Democrats during a
high-spirited campaign rally Saturday: Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton of
New York and Art Torres, chairman of the California Democratic Party
and one of the state's most enduring Latino political figures.</LD>
<LD>   "This governor has done more for Latinos in California than any
other governor in modern history," said Torres, emceeing the
get-out-the-vote rally of party faithful outside the Century Plaza
Hotel in Century City.</LD>
<LD>   Torres, a state lawmaker for 20 years before taking the reins of
the state party in 1995, made his remarks the day after the
Legislature's Democratic Latino caucus declined to endorse Davis'
reelection bid against Republican businessman Bill Simon Jr. Caucus
members said they were angry that Davis had vetoed legislation to
allow some illegal immigrants to get drivers' licenses.</LD>
<TE>   Torres made no mention of the Latino legislators' slap at the
governor, but he rattled off a list of Davis actions--from signing
legislation to strengthen farm workers' rights to appointing the
first Latino to the California Supreme Court--as evidence that Davis
"has never forgotten us."</TE>
<TE>   The former first lady, who spoke just ahead of Davis and drew
louder cheers, said Californians need to send a signal to the
Republican administration in Washington by turning out a "roaring
vote" for Davis and Democrats up and down the state next month.</TE>
<TE>   Acknowledging that voters are "not excited" about the candidates
this election season, Clinton urged Democrats to "just imagine what
would happen to California if there is not a roaring vote that comes
out and reelects Gray Davis ...</TE>
<TE>   "We need to come together," Clinton said. The thunderous applause
that greeted her appearance was punctuated with shouts of "We love
you, Hillary!" and "Hillary for president!"</TE>
<TE>   Davis, grinning and asking in halting Spanish for four more years,
said that "it makes a difference who holds this office."</TE>
<TE>   He touted accomplishments he credited to himself and the
Democrat-controlled Legislature: health insurance for 1 million
children of the working poor, rising test scores in California
schools, improvements in air and water quality, a lower crime rate.</TE>
<TE>   And he reiterated a familiar theme--that Simon is out of step with
mainstream Californians.</TE>
<TE>   "My opponent is a true-blue think tank conservative.... He is out
there," Davis said emphatically. He rattled off a list of issues that
he and Simon disagree on: gun control, stem cell research, abortion
rights and employer-paid family leave, among others.</TE>
<TE>   "This is as clear a contest as you can have," Davis said.</TE>
<TE>   The rally drew enthusiastic partisans who waved red and black
Davis placards and wore yellow "Every Vote Counts" stickers. Before
the speakers joined Democratic candidates and Democratic National
Committee Chairman Terry McAuliffe on the outdoor stage, some in the
crowd traded catcalls with a small group of protesters who walked by
carrying hand-lettered "Dump Davis" signs.</TE>
<TE>   A man in a star-spangled baseball cap paraded briefly along the
edge of the gathering. He carried a sign that read, "Gray Davis Is a
Prostitute," an apparent reference to the governor's prodigious
fund-raising from interest groups.</TE>
<TE>   Comedian Elayne Boosler warmed up the crowd with a joke about
Florida voting and took a swipe at those who stay home from the polls
because they don't like any of the candidates.</TE>
<TE>   "Don't like? It's not dating," she said. "It's the future of the
world."</TE>

<HD>Broken Glass Found in Beach-Building Sand</HD>
<DH>Environment: Crews are cleaning up shards and jagged pieces
of concrete in material used to replenish shoreline.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NICHOLAS RICCARDI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Los Angeles County sand replenishment project dumped material that
included jagged concrete, glass and pipe fragments onto Will Rogers
State Beach, refuse that lies just beneath the sand even after county
workers spent last week trying to clean it up.</LD>
<LD>   County officials said Saturday that ongoing beach erosion requires
them to import sand from other areas to maintain the shoreline and
that it is not unusual for hauls to include "foreign material." The
4,000 cubic yards they deposited on a swath of beach just north of
Gladstone's restaurant, for example, is from a construction site in
Playa del Rey.</LD>
<LD>   But what Mindy Marin and other Pacific Palisades residents
uncovered during a seaside jog prompted complaints to local
officials. The county promised to clean up the debris, and officials
with the Department of Beach and Harbors said they will review their
beach renourishment policies.</LD>
<TE>   On Saturday, Marin, 42, scooped out a chunk of brick and a
6-inch-long glass shard in two shovels of sand. "Look!" she cried.
"That's what our beach is made of."</TE>
<TE>   Her neighbor, John Neidlinger, discovered the debris last weekend,
when he and his 15-year-old son went for a run on the beach.
Neidlinger's son began to turn cartwheels, but had to stop for fear
of shredding his hands on stray chunks of concrete and sheet metal.</TE>
<TE>   "To grow up on this beach all my life and see this happen, I was
just hysterical," Neidlinger said.</TE>
<TE>   He dashed over to Marin's home and rallied a group of neighbors
who called City Councilwoman Cindy Miscikowski last Sunday night.
Miscikowski called the office of Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky, whose
district includes the beach, the next morning. That day, the dumping
stopped.</TE>
<TE>   "There was stuff in there that was just not appropriate,"
Miscikowski said. "They have to be there posting [signs about] it and
making sure it is as clean as when they started."</TE>
<TE>   Kerry Gottleib, chief deputy director of Beaches and Harbors, said
in an interview Saturday that the project ended Monday and the
complaints did not prompt a work stoppage. Workers have shifted to
mixing the new material into sand and sifting the debris.</TE>
<TE>   Gottleib said that the sand from the construction project was
initially tested for compatibility and toxicity and found to be
appropriate. The Environmental Protection Agency and California
Coastal Commission then signed off on the project. She portrayed the
situation as common.</TE>
<TE>   "Whenever you do a sand renourishment project ... there's foreign
debris that's in the sand," she said, recalling how in an earlier
project, tires were mixed into sand on a Marina del Rey beach. "We're
out there cleaning it now," she said of the Will Rogers project.</TE>
<TE>   Yaroslavsky has asked Beaches and Harbors for an explanation and
additional tests to ensure the new material is not toxic, said
Yaroslavsky spokesman Joel Bellman.</TE>
<TE>   Gottleib acknowledged that the county should have warned the
public about potentially dangerous materials in the sand. "We really
need to figure out a way the public can be protected while we're in
the middle of a renourishment job," she said.</TE>
<TE>   On Saturday, the giant machines used for cleaning sand were idle
in the beach's parking lot as crews of workers picked through the
sand, digging out cracked bricks and shards of concrete and glass.
The machines had apparently pressed unknown amounts of debris deeper
into the sand. The new material is far darker than the whiter sands
farther north.</TE>
<TE>   Wherever Marin and Neidlinger dug, they found leftover
construction materials. They argued that the material dumped onto the
beach was primarily dirt, not sand, and said the entire strand needed
to be replaced.</TE>
<TE>   "We want our beach back," Marin said.</TE>

<HD>'Hotshots' Are Under Fire for Racy Photos</HD>
<DH>Forest Service: Elite firefighting force is accused of
sexual harassment for displaying pictures of scantily clad women.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WILLIAM OVEREND</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SANTA BARBARA</DL>
<LD>The 20 members of the special crew of forest firefighters barracked
in the mountains east of here--19 men and one woman--are part of an
elite national force known as the Hotshots.</LD>
<LD>   Based at the Los Prietos Ranger Station in the Los Padres National
Forest, they travel the country wherever needed, fighting fires 12
hours a day for weeks at a time and sleeping on the ground. They go
as far as Colorado and New Mexico, usually in trucks called "crew
buggies."</LD>
<LD>   The U.S. Forest Service takes a special pride in its Hotshots
teams. But now the group in Santa Barbara County is at the center of
something the federal agency is not so proud about.</LD>
<TE>   In the latest in a long series of sexual harassment controversies,
the Forest Service is trying to figure out what to do about numerous
photos of scantily clad women plastered inside the Santa Barbara
team's two crew carriers.</TE>
<TE>   A complaint was officially lodged with local supervisors Sept. 17
and reported to the state's highest forest officials by the following
day. It was backed up with photographic evidence secretly taken, and
Forest Service critics saw it as a final proof of what they have been
saying for years.</TE>
<TE>   The top management of the Forest Service has turned a blind eye to
sexual harassment for too long, they say. And worse, they charge, the
agency has taken a punitive approach to anybody who complains about
it.</TE>
<TE>   Lesa Donnelly worked for the Forest Service for 14 years. But now,
under terms of a class-action lawsuit settled last year, she is one
of three monitors tracking the agency's approach to sexual harassment
claims involving female Forest Service employees in California.</TE>
<TE>   "The pictures have given us tangible evidence of what we have been
saying for years. The tone is set by management, and there are sexual
harassment issues all over California," she said.</TE>
<TE>   "But the Los Padres National Forest has one of the biggest
problems, and management simply hasn't done its job. There are
Hotshots groups throughout the country, and they do a wonderful job.
But the Los Prietos Hotshots are not professional. They have brought
shame on the entire Forest Service."</TE>
<TE>   Almost two weeks after the Sept. 17 complaint about the photos in
the Hotshots trucks, California's top Forest Service official, Jack
A. Blackwell, announced what many in the agency's management ranks
consider a tough response to the incident.</TE>
<TE>   Repeating earlier statements that the Forest Service has a
zero-tolerance policy toward sexual harassment, Blackwell called the
photos offensive and added that "this behavior is intolerable."</TE>
<TE>   Last Monday, Blackwell ordered one-hour sessions for all 8,300
permanent and temporary Forest Service personnel at the 18 national
forests in California "to ensure that all employees understand our
zero-tolerance policy." About 33% of that group is female.</TE>
<TE>   According to Donnelly, nobody on the Hotshots crew at Los Prietos
had objected to the photos, including the one female member. But
Blackwell said that wasn't the issue, and he ordered all agency
managers to report back by the end of the week that no inappropriate
material existed anywhere.</TE>
<TE>   Blackwell defined inappropriate material as "pictures of nude or
scantily clad (swimsuits or the like) people, magazines and books
with such pictures or with sexually explicit information, or
inappropriate objects."</TE>
<TE>   The incident in the Los Padres National Forest wasn't the only
blatant problem in recent months, he noted. There were suggestive
photos found at the Tahoe National Forest in July, which resulted in
the firing of two employees and the resignation of three others. And
there has been pornographic e-mail floating around, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Jack was pretty upset," said Matt Mathes, spokesman at the
Vallejo headquarters of the agency's Region 5, which covers all of
California.</TE>
<TE>   "We are a large and diverse organization, however," he added.
"There probably are some people who don't treat it as seriously as
Jack does, but our response is you will treat it."</TE>
<TE>   None of that was very persuasive to Donnelly and other entrenched
critics of the Forest Service. She noted that it took almost two
weeks for Blackwell to announce his actions, and speculated that both
the words and actions were aimed at U.S. District Judge Lowell Jensen
in Oakland, who is monitoring the class-action settlement to make
sure that all sides act in good faith.</TE>
<TE>   "He's not doing anything to work with us to get the supervisors to
really take this seriously," she said. "At Los Prietos, one
supervisor started off by telling everybody she knew they all worked
hard and played hard. That wasn't the tone to take. It was a way of
winking and saying I really don't care."</TE>
<TE>   In Donnelly's opinion, the Hotshots at Los Prietos should be
disbanded and management officials disciplined or replaced. Along
with the secretly taken pictures of the semi-nude photos, there were
photographs inside the Hotshots barracks showing stacks of six-packs
of beer.</TE>
<TE>   "They really think they are the hottest thing around, and they act
like they are a bunch of frat boys," Donnelly said. "They also have
started intimidating people since this controversy started. I am
going to ask Forest Service officials in Washington that they be
removed for the safety of the people they think are talking about
them."</TE>
<TE>   The Forest Service announced it has hired an outside investigative
contractor to determine exactly what happened at Los Prietos and who
knew what and when.</TE>
<TE>   A typical punishment for a first offense in such a case could be a
letter of reprimand or a 30-day suspension, one official said.</TE>
<TE>   One female employee also housed at the Los Prietos Ranger Station,
who has filed 17 complaints against the agency for everything from
sexual harassment to slander, said she is frightened by the mood of
anger toward the whistle-blowers in the case.</TE>
<TE>   "I am afraid somebody is going to get hurt, and it could be me,"
said Janine McFarland, an archeologist who says she was removed from
a Chumash Indian project because of her complaints. "I'm very
concerned for my safety."</TE>
<TE>   Los Padres Forest supervisor Jeanine Derby minimized that
prospect, but said she has notified local law enforcement officers
about the concerns. Derby, the chief target of many of Donnelly's
complaints, also defended her actions in dealing with sexual
harassment issues, saying she takes the latest incident very
seriously.</TE>
<TE>   Members of the Hotshots team approached by The Times declined
comment last week, but the group was described by several co-workers
as being angry. Along with that, there was some confusion among
others about exactly what constitutes inappropriate material.</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SANTA BARBARA</DL>
<LD>A tradition for candidates trailing in the polls is to fend off
questions about the possibility of losing by professing faith in a
come-from-behind victory.</LD>
<LD>   Bill Simon Jr. dispatched with that tradition Wednesday on a bus
trip from Fresno to Modesto. What will he do if voters reelect his
Democratic rival, Gov. Gray Davis?</LD>
<LD>   "Just continue to look at ways to be of service to the people of
California," Simon said. "Probably go back to the firm."</LD>
<TE>   Coming 10 months after he left the helm of William E. Simon &amp; Sons
to run for governor, the candidate's open contemplation of
post-election opportunities marked a rare unguarded moment in a
campaign that has come to resemble a rescue mission.</TE>
<TE>   Simon has just 30 days to recover from a raft of campaign
troubles, ranging from a money shortage to staff upheaval. He has
even less time to make his case to the state's millions of absentee
voters, who can begin casting ballots Monday.</TE>
<TE>   A Times poll released last week found Simon 10 points behind
Davis, with only one scheduled event--Monday's Los Angeles Times
debate between the two men--that analysts say could prompt a quick
turnaround.</TE>
<TE>   For all that, Simon is upbeat in public, and supporters try to
keep him that way.</TE>
<TE>   "Bill, hang in there," GOP volunteer Jim Hurst of Goleta told the
candidate Friday at a Santa Barbara campaign stop. "You're going to
make it."</TE>
<TE>   To Hurst, a retired engineer, Simon has been "too much of a
gentleman" in responding to Davis' TV spots that depict him as a
corporate swindler who cannot be trusted to govern the country's most
populous state.</TE>
<TE>   "I think he should be harsher," Hurst said.</TE>
<TE>   By and large, Simon's public demeanor is indeed gentle; a favorite
exclamation is "my golly." But the nice-guy talk has given way more
and more to scathing indictments of Davis. At campaign stops last
week from Orange County to Silicon Valley, Simon's focus was on
raising more doubts about the governor's competence and integrity
than Davis has raised about Simon's.</TE>
<TE>   By Simon's telling, the governor has neglected California's
schools, spoiled its air and water, undermined its farmers and
squandered the bounty of its 1990s economic boom. Simon casts Davis
as an unscrupulous career politician with an insatiable thirst for
campaign money.</TE>
<TE>   "I call on the governor to stop selling public policy to the
highest bidder," Simon told supporters at a fairgrounds luncheon here
at the foot of the Santa Ynez Mountains.</TE>
<TE>   Simon expands the list of alleged Davis misdeeds whenever
opportunities arise. At Los Angeles Harbor in San Pedro Friday, he
blamed Davis for the shutdown of West Coast ports in a labor dispute.
Simon said Davis "should have encouraged negotiations that would have
kept our ports open." Thanks to the governor, he charged, the dock
lockout could soon deprive California kids of new toys.</TE>
<TE>   "Davis threatens to leave children with a big lump of coal in
place of Christmas gifts," Simon said.</TE>
<TE>   Davis campaign spokesman Gabriel Sanchez denied all of Simon's
accusations, saying they "smack of desperation."</TE>
<TE>   In a vast state where television is the essential vehicle for
communicating with voters, the dearth of TV news cameras at most of
Simon's public events has limited the reach of his counter-assault.
Like many other candidates, he has struggled to generate TV coverage
of his chosen themes. Only one camera crew showed up in San Pedro;
the local news of the day was the selection of a new LAPD chief.</TE>
<TE>   So for Simon, swamped since June by Davis attack ads airing
statewide, the launch of a TV spot introducing himself on his own
terms last week was a big step forward. He said he hoped to show
voters "that I'm a regular guy."</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of people don't know me, and they don't know my message,"
Simon told a Santa Barbara reporter who asked about voters' holding
their noses as they choose between him and Davis. "Once they hear me
and my message, I don't think they'll be holding their noses any
more."</TE>
<TE>   In the ad, Simon says: "Do you know me? I survived millions of
dollars of Gray Davis lies and distortions."</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe because I've made money, I'm not corrupted by it, like Gray
Davis," he goes on.</TE>
<TE>   Hamstrung by a campaign war chest millions of dollars smaller than
the governor's, the Republican candidate has broadcast his previous
ads sporadically. But Simon, who has plowed more than $9 million of
his personal fortune into the race, said a new surge of donations
would enable him to stay on TV every day until the election.</TE>
<TE>   Among the biggest recent contributions have been $100,000 from
Julie Simon Munro, a sister, and $50,000 apiece from Beverly Hills
realtor William W. Singleton and the Firearms Freedom Fund of
Fullerton, a group that--like Simon--opposes new gun control laws.</TE>
<TE>   On the stump, Simon has combined his jabs at Davis with efforts to
repair his own image, often by calling attention to his charitable
donations.</TE>
<TE>   "Some people criticize Republicans for being a little harsh,"
Simon told GOP loyalists Monday at the Richard Nixon Library &amp;
Birthplace in Yorba Linda. "The fact is, our heart is right. You can
be compassionate and be Republican. I am compassionate. I care about
people. My wife and I have helped thousands of people these last 20
years."</TE>
<TE>   And although he marketed himself as a "conservative Republican" in
the primary, he has tried to tailor his general-election message to
moderates and independents, notably by stressing education.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, he campaigned in front of a San Jose high school,
where he criticized Davis for California test scores that remain low
despite an overall rise during the governor's term.</TE>
<TE>   A cluster of Simon supporters chanted, "Dump Davis" and "Time for
a Change."</TE>
<TE>   But bricklayer Victor Meras, a bystander dressed in bluejeans, a
T-shirt and construction boots, asked Simon what he was doing in a
prosperous neighborhood where schools are far from desperate.</TE>
<TE>   "How come you don't go to the east side, where they really need
help?" he asked.</TE>
<TE>   Simon, dressed in a business suit, told Meras that he had paid
visits to a wide assortment of schools and that his family had long
been dedicated to the ones in need. Simon squatted down to greet two
of Meras' four kids and told their father: "You've got a beautiful
family."</TE>
<TE>   But Meras was unmoved by Simon's pledge--which included few
details--to fix the public school system. "I don't think he really
means it," he said. "He just wants to get elected."</TE>
<TE>   In Santa Barbara, Simon returned to another issue he has
used--albeit sparingly--to position himself toward the political
center: the environment. The Sierra Club and other major conservation
groups have endorsed Davis, but in his speech Simon cast himself as
more dedicated than the governor to fighting offshore oil drilling
and the dumping of radioactive waste.</TE>
<TE>   Simon acknowledged later that he has invested in oil-drilling
companies. He also reaffirmed his opposition to a bill signed by
Davis that requires a cut in tailpipe emissions to combat global
warming. Simon declined to say whether California should address
global warming. Scientists, he said, remain divided on whether it
exists.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not prepared to tell you today where the weight of the
evidence is," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Simon's difficulty in reaching to the middle without alienating
conservatives was underscored more visibly last week on gun control.
On Tuesday in Sacramento, he said he was glad to score the National
Rifle Assn.'s endorsement. But in a radio interview two days later in
Los Angeles, he said: "Just because they endorse me doesn't mean that
I endorse everything they stand for." He declined to specify any
disagreements with the NRA.</TE>
<TE>   For Davis, Simon's opposition to gun control, like his stand
against abortion rights, has been a tool to court moderates,
particularly women, by arguing that his GOP rival is out of step with
mainstream Californians. Asked to respond to that argument Tuesday in
Sacramento, Simon shifted attention back to Davis and the economy.</TE>
<TE>   "I believe that we need to be in step with our people," he said.
"But we need to be focused on what's important to our people each and
every day."</TE>
<TE>   That was his reason, Simon said, for promising to improve schools
and stimulate the economy by rolling back state regulations, reducing
employers' costs for insuring workers injured on the job, and cutting
the state's tax on capital gains. On the bus ride to Modesto, Simon
returned to those themes, but also looked forward to the end of
Davis' ad campaign.</TE>
<TE>   "People's memories are short, so on Nov. 6, or a couple weeks
thereafter, many people won't really remember a lot of these
baldfaced lies," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Would Simon run for public office a second time?</TE>
<TE>   "Sure," he said. "Absolutely."</TE>

<HD>A Murder Mystery Prompts Man's Quest</HD>
<DH>A relative believes he's solved the puzzle of Clyde and
Lulu Dayton's deaths, but their stash of money is still missing.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CECILIA RASMUSSEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>What really happened to Clyde and Lulu Dayton? The health food
pioneer known as the "Red-Ripe Honey-Man" and his wife were shot and
burned to death in their isolated cabin more than 80 years ago, their
deaths officially unsolved.</LD>
<LD>   Now, a distant relative thinks he has the answer. But even he
doesn't know what happened to their buried treasure.</LD>
<LD>   Clyde Dayton was something of a demented, miserly eccentric. When
he wasn't pushing a wheelbarrow full of honey five miles east to
Owensmouth, he could be found performing as the "bee-wizard" (bees
swarming around his head) at Los Angeles' cultural center, Hazard's
Pavilion. He reputedly made a fortune, but he never owned a car, or
even a horse and buggy.</LD>
<TE>   The Daytons' 138-acre ranch stretched from Roscoe and Valley
Circle boulevards in the San Fernando Valley community of West Hills
to the Ventura County line. It included a canyon and creek named for
the Daytons.</TE>
<TE>   Now it's being transformed into Dayton Canyon Estates, where
developers are building 150 luxury homes. Project archeologists have
unearthed bone fragments in 32 individual American Indian graves. But
there's been no sign of Dayton's fortune--reputed to be thousands of
dollars buried in Mason jars.</TE>
<TE>   Since 1922, members of the family have believed that Clyde, 60,
and Lulu, 52, were victims of a double murder because there was talk
of "suspicious holes in their skulls," a "blood-bespattered trail"
and buried treasure.</TE>
<TE>   As a child, Robbie Wilson of Coalfield, Tenn., had been told that
his great-great-aunt and uncle had been murdered for their money. But
after watching "Roots," the 1977 television miniseries based on Alex
Haley's novel, 12-year-old Robbie wanted to know what really
happened.</TE>
<TE>   He spent more than two decades digging through archives, poring
over family letters and microfilm stories from eight newspapers, and
interviewing family members across the nation.</TE>
<TE>   After sorting through a maze of contradictory information,
including death certificates that listed the cause of death as
unknown, Wilson believes he has the answer.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   New York-born Clyde Dayton arrived in Los Angeles in the 1890s and
squatted on land tucked into a canyon of sagebrush, a creek and
twisting ravines. In 1896, he married Katie McNeill, an Iowa native.
She moved to his ranch in the farming community of Chatsworth. (The
community's present name, West Hills, was adopted in 1987.)</TE>
<TE>   Dayton suffered from chronic indigestion, which sparked his
interest in healthy eating. He proselytized about nutrition and
became a professional beekeeper, believing that honey held the key to
health.</TE>
<TE>   He built himself a shack with corrugated metal and made hundreds
of wooden beehives.</TE>
<TE>   Local fruit growers depended on Dayton's bees to pollinate their
crops. But the bulk of his income came from his honey, which he never
sold without peddling his philosophy via his free health food
pamphlets.</TE>
<TE>   Despite all her presumably healthful eating, Katie contracted
tuberculosis. In 1903, she left Dayton Canyon for treatment at a
renowned Seventh-day Adventist sanitarium in Michigan. Two years
later, as she was about to die, she returned to Los Angeles with a
student nurse, Lou "Lulu" Adkisson. After Katie's death, the nurse
stayed in California, working as a seamstress and living downtown
with Dayton's mother.</TE>
<TE>   Four years later, Dayton and Lulu were married. Both were strict
vegetarians and devout Seventh-day Adventists.</TE>
<TE>   Lulu moved into the shack where Clyde still wrote and printed
pamphlets about the nutritional benefits of raw vegetables and honey.</TE>
<TE>   Dayton believed that cleaning up the nutritional clutter in a
person's body required eating uncooked green vegetables, red honey
and fruits with red pulp. In an era when most of America was strictly
meat and potatoes, he strongly suggested avoiding fats for good
digestion.</TE>
<TE>   An article he wrote for the March 30, 1917, issue of the
Owensmouth Gazette, headlined "How Honey Heals," declared:</TE>
<TE>   "There is not any kind of food that is nutritious if it is white,
unless it is combined by its molecules with red or green. White honey
is a conglomerate mass of colors until it has been ripened by cold
weather so that its red is more intensified and the white eliminated.
White is the color disease germs thrive in."</TE>
<TE>   A Fortune From Honey</TE>
<TE>   Over more than a quarter-century, Dayton made a fortune selling
large barrels of his "Red Ripe Honey"--some of which he buried for
seven years to "enhance" its medicinal value. He shipped it by
railroad car, along with boxes of his health food pamphlets.</TE>
<TE>   He evidently didn't trust banks any more than he trusted red meat.
He gloated over his cache of silver and gold coins, which he
supposedly buried somewhere on his vast property.</TE>
<TE>   Over time, life in the cabin grew difficult and cramped with piles
of magazines and pamphlets competing for space. Lulu complained to a
friend that her husband rarely bathed, talked to himself and argued
with her constantly. She begged him to build her a larger cabin and
take a vacation, but he refused. Instead, he threatened to kill her
if she didn't shut up.</TE>
<TE>   On April 12, 1922, Dayton was last seen returning from Owensmouth
with an empty wheelbarrow and a pocketful of profits. Hours later,
his life and 12-year marriage ended tragically with the crack of a
gun and the flick of a match.</TE>
<TE>   When the ashes cooled, sheriff's deputies found the Daytons'
remains side by side on twisted steel bedsprings. Lulu's body had
been doused with coal oil. (A half-empty jug was found outside.)
There weren't enough skull fragments left to determine if there had
been violence before the fire. But a trail of blood led from the
cabin to the road, then disappeared. Or was it from the road to the
cabin? At first, authorities reported that it was a double murder
with robbery as the motive. Half the community speculated that
Dayton's neighbor, rancher Lon Gates, might have killed the couple
for money or even revenge. Gates, the son of Calabasas Constable
William Gates, was known throughout the area as a "bad hombre." He
had been arrested on three different occasions for cruelty to
animals, including beating horses unmercifully with an iron chain.</TE>
<TE>   One of the police investigators, a part-time rancher who kept some
of his own beehives on Dayton's ranch, said he believed Gates got
even with the Daytons. Apparently, Lulu had soured a cattle deal
after overhearing Gates lie about the condition of a prize calf.</TE>
<TE>   But other evidence surfaced to support a murder-suicide theory.
Neighbors reported that the couple had quarreled frequently. And
Lulu's friend gave police a letter in which Lulu said she feared for
her life and asked the friend to notify relatives if anything
happened to her.</TE>
<TE>   Still, police were perplexed. At the end of the six-day
investigation, all they could come up with was a "possible
murder-suicide." Although evidence pointed to Clyde's killing Lulu,
setting her body afire, then shooting himself, police questioned the
location of his three guns: in the corner. None was near his body.
(Of course, the cabin was tiny--just 12 by 12 feet.)</TE>
<TE>   Compounding the mystery, it was impossible to tell if any of the
guns had been fired. And if there were any shell casings, they melted
in the conflagration.</TE>
<TE>   It seemed that everyone in town, including sheriff's deputies, had
an opinion about the Daytons' cause of death.</TE>
<TE>   Search Ends in Theory</TE>
<TE>   Now, after decades of research, Wilson has one of this own: He
believes that Clyde soured on life amid the sweet smell of
health-food honey and killed Lulu, then himself.</TE>
<TE>   Dayton was "probably insane," Wilson says. He thinks that a
jerking reaction as he died most likely caused the gun to fly a few
feet away from his body.</TE>
<TE>   "The fire was so intense because of the cabin's corrugated metal
frame and the amount of paper inside, making it impossible for a
brass bullet casing to survive the fire," he says.</TE>
<TE>   "My grandmother's recollection of 'suspicious holes in their
skulls' can probably be explained by the fact that she, a 7-year-old
in 1922, probably heard the family mention 'pieces of their skulls'
and, from that, assumed that they had been struck on their heads
prior to the fire."</TE>
<TE>   But the clincher for Wilson was a two-paragraph story in the Los
Angeles Evening Herald that mentioned Lulu's letter about fearing for
her life.</TE>
<TE>   Clyde and Lulu's remains were buried in separate caskets in the
same grave at Evergreen Cemetery in East Los Angeles. Clyde's eternal
legacy was penurious: There was no headstone.</TE>
<TE>   On the 80th anniversary of their deaths last April 12, Wilson
visited Los Angeles and purchased a headstone to mark their grave.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   One mystery solved, at least to Wilson's satisfaction. But what
happened to the money?</TE>
<TE>   "I've always wondered about the possibility of buried money still
being in existence, since I learned from a Glendale title company
back in 1988 that their property was still undeveloped," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "The newspaper articles state that it was an assumption that Clyde
kept a large sum of money hidden inside his and Lou's cabin. However,
my grandmother's first cousin, who worked and stayed on the ranch in
1919, knew it was buried somewhere in the bee yard. Every time Clyde
paid him, he would go outside into the bee yard and return with gold
and silver coins."</TE>
<TE>   Dayton Canyon--or, rather, Dayton Canyon Estates--is about to get
a multitude of new homeowners.</TE>
<TE>   Some of them will be armed with metal detectors, and they'll be
heading for whatever remains of the bee yard.</TE>

<LD>Heaven, for these Angels, always had to wait.</LD>
<LD>   For more than four decades they were stuck in the shadow of the
Dodgers, their big-city neighbors to the north, always struggling,
always stumbling, always coming up short in the end</LD>
<LD>   Only three times in their 42 years did they so much as make the
playoffs--and each time they lost in the first round.</LD>
<TE>   Until Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   On a sun-drenched afternoon at Edison Field, the Angels finally
stepped out of the darkness of their dismal past, chasing away both
their demons and the playoff-hardened New York Yankees with a 9-5
victory that advanced them to the American League championship
series.</TE>
<TE>   Saturday's victory in front of a red-clad, rally-stick-waving
crowd of 45,067 was especially sweet because it came against the
Yankees, winners of four of the last six World Series and a
league-best 103 games in the regular season.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels, with 99 victories, came into the best-of-five series
as the league's wild card, not expected to last long. The Yankees had
home-field advantage, which meant the Angels would have to face the
mystique of baseball's fabled Yankee Stadium where the dreams of many
a previous visiting team had dissolved under the historic facade and
the monuments of Yankee greats such as Babe Ruth, Joe DiMaggio and
Mickey Mantle.</TE>
<TE>   But on Saturday it was the Yankees who dissolved in the face of
relative unknowns such as Angel relief pitcher Francisco Rodriguez
and role players Shawn Wooten and Benji Gil.</TE>
<TE>   Rodriguez, a 20-year-old with barely six weeks of big-league
experience, pitched 1 2/3 innings of hitless relief, striking out
three of the seven batters he faced. Wooten, a longtime minor leaguer
who started the year injured, had three hits, scored three runs and
started an eight-run fifth inning with a solo home run that tied the
score, 2-2.</TE>
<TE>   As for Gil, Manager Mike Scioscia raised a few eyebrows by
starting him at second base in place of red-hot Adam Kennedy. So all
Gil did was respond with three hits, , including two in the fifth,
when the Angels sent 13 batters to the plate in setting a
division-series record for runs in an inning.</TE>
<TE>   All of which helped set up the grandest of finales, a capacity
crowd roaring with pent-up anticipation as fireballing closer Troy
Percival faced Yankee designated hitter Nick Johnson with two outs
and two runners on base in the ninth inning.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson popped a ball up in the direction of shortstop David
Eckstein. And what was running through Eckstein's mind as the ball
sailed downward?</TE>
<TE>   "Don't drop it," he said.</TE>
<TE>   He didn't, and the celebration was on.</TE>
<TE>   "We did it the Disney team way," said Michael Eisner, chairman of
the Walt Disney Co., which owns the team. "This is a great morale
booster for our whole company, which is going through tough times.
It's good for L.A. It's good for Orange County. It's good for the
whole Disney organization."</TE>
<TE>   Yet even as he stood soaking in the spray of champagne and beer
flying around the Angel clubhouse in the postgame celebration, Eisner
conceded that, under the right circumstances, he would still sell the
team, which has been on the market.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not out there auctioning it," he said. "But if the right
buyer with the right attitude and the right way of doing things came
along, we'd be interested."</TE>
<TE>   At Garf's Bar and Grill in Costa Mesa, the celebration began
during the Angels' big fifth inning.</TE>
<TE>   "The Yankees are done! Start spreadin' the news!" yelled bar
customer George Mejia, who promptly began talking about buying World
Series tickets. Never mind that Anaheim still has to beat the winner
of the Oakland-Minnesota playoff series to get there.</TE>
<TE>   When the television camera zoomed in on a photo of Gene Autry, the
team's first owner, a group at the back of the bar began chanting,
"Gene! Gene!"</TE>
<TE>   Formed as an expansion team in 1961, Autry's club started play as
the Los Angeles Angels and played its first season in Wrigley Field,
the Los Angeles version, where the Angels of the Pacific Coast League
had played before them.</TE>
<TE>   After one year, Autry moved the club to Dodger Stadium for four
seasons. Desperate to establish their own identity, the Angels
refused to refer to their home as Dodger Stadium, calling it instead
Chavez Ravine.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, Autry carved out his own territory in Anaheim. But he
died without realizing his dream of winning a championship.</TE>
<TE>   "It's overwhelming to all of us," said Jeff Horel, 26, of
Huntington Beach, who was at the game. "We all wish that Gene Autry
could be here."</TE>
<TE>   "I feel elation. I feel vindicated," said Chris Damore, 34, of
Fullerton, who works as a teacher in Santa Ana. "The greatest feeling
is going to be going to work to shut down all the ... Yankee fans who
aren't even from New York.... You stick with the team you grew up
with."</TE>
<TE>   In New York, fans who had stuck with their beloved Yankees were
crushed.</TE>
<TE>   "Where is Anaheim?" asked Jerry Siracusa, staring numbly at a
television set at Carmine's, a raucous sports bar and restaurant on
Manhattan's Upper West Side. "Who is Anaheim?"</TE>
<TE>   His pal, John Finamore, tried to be helpful, saying: "Anaheim is a
famous place out there, you know? It's about 50 miles south of San
Diego."</TE>
<TE>   The packed crowd at Carmine's groaned after the Angels turned a
2-1 deficit into a 9-2 lead in the fifth inning, and a sense of doom
trickled through the room as one Yankee rally after another
sputtered.</TE>
<TE>   "This hurts, man," said Delvi Rodriguez, who couldn't believe that
the Yankees' run of four straight World Series appearances was coming
to an end. "I feel like my wife just left me, and I also lost the
kids. Actually, it hurts even worse than that."</TE>
<TE>   You couldn't blame the loss, said one fan, on bad managing or
lousy pitching or the law of averages finally catching up to the most
successful team in American sports history.</TE>
<TE>   "There's something much bigger going on here," said a glum Rod
Phillipo at the bar. "When the Yankees don't get in the World Series,
there's something wrong with the universe."</TE>

<HD>Bush Promises Postwar Aid if Hussein Toppled</HD>
<DH>Iraq: The president says U.S. would play a role in
rebuilding the country after a war. He keeps up pressure to receive
the authority to attack.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES GERSTENZANG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MANCHESTER, N.H.</DL>
<LD>President Bush said Saturday that if the United States goes to war
against Iraq, Washington would work with other countries after combat
ends to rebuild the country and form "a just government" there.</LD>
<LD>   His declaration, never stated so directly in the past, goes to the
heart of some of the gravest concerns he is facing in the United
States and in the U.N. Security Council about what Washington would
do to avoid chaos, and a new dictatorship, if it ousts Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein.</LD>
<LD>   At the same time, he has kept up steady pressure to win approval
for the use of force against Iraq, even as he said that he would
direct U.S. forces to attack Iraq and rid it of weapons of mass
destruction only if it is "essential to security and justice."</LD>
<TE>   "Delay, indecision and inaction are not options for America,
because they could lead to massive and sudden horror," the president
said.</TE>
<TE>   In three speeches Saturday delving into the tensions over how to
confront the weapons of mass destruction the U.S. believes Iraq has,
the president kept his focus on a message intended to win as great a
margin as possible for a congressional resolution authorizing use of
force. He also sought to overcome the strong reluctance of France and
Russia, two Security Council members with veto power, to a resolution
before the council giving Bush the go-ahead for military action if
Iraq does not quickly disarm.</TE>
<TE>   "We owe it to a peaceful world to deal with the threats we see,"
the president said. "We cannot ignore history. We must not ignore
reality. We must do everything we can to disarm this man before he
hurts one single American."</TE>
<TE>   Separately, at a political luncheon, he added forcefully: "If
Saddam Hussein makes the choice not to disarm, the United States and
a lot of our friends will disarm him. For the sake of peace, for the
sake of freedom, for the sake of our future and our children's
future, we will disarm him."</TE>
<TE>   In his weekly radio address, the president said that in the event
of war, "the United States will work with other nations to help the
Iraqi people rebuild and form a just government."</TE>
<TE>   "We have no quarrel with the Iraqi people," he said. "They are the
daily victims of Saddam Hussein's oppression, and they will be the
first to benefit when the world's demands are met."</TE>
<TE>   The president is in the midst of an intensifying campaign to
overcome objections in Congress to the resolution that the House is
likely to vote on early this week, and the Senate sometime later.
Both chambers are considered almost certain to approve the measure.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday evening in Cincinnati, Bush is scheduled to deliver what
the White House hopes will be a major speech putting forward his
strongest argument for holding out the threat of certain force
against Hussein if he does not comply fully with disarmament demands.
The president's remarks at a rally, the Republican fund-raising
speech in New Hampshire on Saturday and his radio address amounted to
a preview of that prime-time message, which already has undergone
several drafts and will be delivered on the anniversary of U.S.
military action in Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   During a rally that included camouflage-clad soldiers and
firefighters in dress blues at Manchester's National Guard Armory--a
site of political events during the state's storied presidential
primaries--Bush said Hussein was "a man who hates America and yet
still possesses weapons of mass destruction."</TE>
<TE>   And, Bush said, "had this man not been checked in the 1990s, he
would have had possession of a nuclear weapon." Various experts
disagree how quickly Hussein could gain possession of a nuclear
weapon, with some saying the period could be as short as a year.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a man who would be a tremendous threat to world peace and
security if he ever were to have and possess a weapon of mass
destruction as devastating as a nuclear weapon," he added.</TE>
<TE>   The president also renewed an argument he has been making with
increasing frequency lately that seeks to link Hussein to the risk of
terrorist actions like the Sept. 11 attacks.</TE>
<TE>   "We're dealing with these treacherous terrorist organizations who
have designs and desires to hook up with nations such as Iraq that
develop weapons of mass destruction," Bush said at the rally, adding:
"See, old Saddam might not have to show up, but he might get a
surrogate who can do it for him."</TE>
<TE>   Presenting the case against Hussein as one that bridges partisan
divides, Bush said, "A lot of folks--Republicans, Democrats, people
who could care less about political parties--now are beginning to
understand the true threat."</TE>
<TE>   And in the radio speech, he urged Americans "to call their members
of Congress to make sure your voice is heard." Seeking to ease the
political tensions the debate has brought out, he praised the
"tremendous work" of House Speaker J. Dennis Hastert (R-Ill.), House
Minority Leader Richard A. Gephardt (D-Mo.) and Senate Minority
Leader Trent Lott (R-Miss.) in assembling bipartisan support for the
congressional resolution.</TE>
<TE>   "By supporting the resolution now before them," Bush said,
"members of Congress will send a clear message to Saddam: His only
choice is to fully comply with the demands of the world. And the time
for that choice is limited."</TE>
<TE>   The luncheon, supporting Rep. John E. Sununu, the Republican
running for the Senate against Gov. Jeanne Shaheen, collected
$250,000 for Sununu and $250,000 for the state Republican Party.</TE>
<TE>   The president used the event to make a pitch for party unity,
saluting the work of Sen. Bob Smith, the New Hampshire Republican
defeated by Sununu in a bitter party primary last month.</TE>

<HD>Child-Care Issue Frames Welfare Reform Debate</HD>
<DH>Congress: Driving the conflict are waiting lists for
subsidies, differing views on reducing them. New work rules likely
would increase demand.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JONATHAN PETERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>CHAPEL HILL, N.C.</DL>
<LD>Like other parents throughout the United States, Sonya Brown
scrambles every day to meet commitments for work and the care of her
young child.</LD>
<LD>   For Brown, 25, who juggles her $6.15-an-hour job with college
courses, a government benefit pays for her 3-year-old son's day care.
Without it, she says, "I would be in big trouble."</LD>
<LD>   Rashida Walker, 32, is already struggling. "I wanted to keep my
son in day care, but I couldn't afford it," said Walker, who was laid
off in January from her job on a computer help desk. Since then she
has been unemployed, and her 16-month-old remains on the waiting list
for a child-care subsidy.</LD>
<TE>   As Congress attempts to launch the next phase of welfare reform,
the cost of child care has emerged as one of the biggest obstacles to
moving ahead. Legislators remain billions of dollars apart, and the
rift is complicating efforts to extend the nation's welfare programs,
which had been authorized only through last Monday until Congress
passed an emergency three-month extension.</TE>
<TE>   Fueling the conflict are waiting lists for child-care subsidies
that have emerged in 21 states, and sharply divergent views about how
to reduce them. Moreover, tougher work rules proposed for welfare
recipients are expected to push up demand for child care even
further, as mothers spend more time away from home as a condition of
government aid.</TE>
<TE>   North Carolina knows well the difficult choices faced by parents
and government officials in a world where the clamor for subsidized
child care exceeds the availability. As in most places, North
Carolina officials give priority to families on welfare or seeking to
move off the dole--meaning that other low-income households may be
less fortunate. Almost 20,000 children are waiting for the benefit in
North Carolina, compared with the nearly 100,000 who already get it.</TE>
<TE>   "The goal is to get that [welfare] client to work," explained
Peggy Ball, director of the North Carolina Division of Child
Development in Raleigh. "And they can't work without child care."</TE>
<TE>   With little fanfare, demand for child-care aid has skyrocketed,
and child care now costs taxpayers more than $10 billion a year. A
growing number of states spend more on child care than on welfare, a
remarkable shift in just the last five years.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been a huge change, and it's been virtually beneath the
surface," said Mark H. Greenberg, director of policy at the Center
for Law and Social Policy in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   Child-care subsidies involve not only welfare recipients, but also
the working poor and even families closer to middle-class income
levels. Households far above the poverty line may qualify for
subsidies, with an estimated 15 million children technically
eligible, according to the Center for Law and Social Policy. Of
these, just 2.2 million are getting the aid.</TE>
<TE>   California's waiting list for subsidized care has reached 280,000
children. In Florida, 40,000 are waiting.</TE>
<TE>   Without subsidies, which typically vary according to household
income, parents may pay child-care centers $4,000 to $10,000 a year.
The financial burden pushes many to seek cheaper alternatives with
relatives, neighbors or other in-home providers.</TE>
<TE>   Current federal funding contains "plenty of money" for welfare
families and the working poor, said Wade F. Horn, assistant secretary
for children and families in the U.S. Department of Health and Human
Services.</TE>
<TE>   "If the taxpayers' pockets were bottomless, we'd give everybody a
subsidy," Horn said in an interview. "But that's not the way the real
world works."</TE>
<TE>   In the real world of North Carolina, people closely tied to the
issue insist that a large number of low-income families are not
getting the child care they need.</TE>
<TE>   Of the 95,562 children getting subsidized care in North Carolina,
more than 8 in 10 come from families earning less than $25,000 a
year.</TE>
<TE>   Officials believe that the waiting list, which recently numbered
19,930, mirrors that same modest level of income. But they say the
waiting list reflects only a fragment of the overall demand. People
often quit waiting out of frustration, perhaps also giving up the
search for work, and some never bother to put their children's names
on it in the first place.</TE>
<TE>   "The waiting list is the part of the iceberg that you see above
the water," said Ball, the state's top child-care official.</TE>
<TE>   Walker would be the first to agree. She and her son live in a
trailer with her 91-year-old grandmother. She has survived on
unemployment insurance since getting laid off, but no longer can
afford the $105 a week she used to pay her son's day-care provider.</TE>
<TE>   Walker symbolizes a rarely discussed aspect of welfare reform:
Households that have avoided welfare are typically given lower
priority for child care.</TE>
<TE>   "There are people out there that don't want to work, and they're
just getting help left and right," Walker said.</TE>
<TE>   "When it comes to someone who's been working and paying taxes,
there's no help for them. It is very unfair."</TE>
<TE>   Some advocate child care for the nonwelfare population as a way to
keep low-income households from slipping onto the rolls of cash
assistance if they run into a major problem.</TE>
<TE>   Anna Mercer McLean, director of the Community School for People
Under Six--a cheerful, red-brick center on a hilltop in Chapel
Hill--says she sometimes sees a disturbing chain of events: First, a
parent loses a job. Then she loses child care. Then it becomes harder
to put the pieces back in place.</TE>
<TE>   "How do you expect a parent to get their job back when they've
lost their child care?" she asked.</TE>
<TE>   Ball says officials should view child care as part of the
infrastructure of the state economy, a crucial nutrient for healthy,
growing companies. Employers, she said, "move to North Carolina and
ask, is there a good water system? Is there a good electrical
utility? They look at the schools. The other piece is whether there's
sufficient child care for their employees."</TE>
<TE>   Adding heat to the national debate is the reality that states
across the country are suffering the fiscal fallout of a weak
economy, and a growing number are looking for ways to curb child-care
costs.</TE>
<TE>   Iowa, Massachusetts, Nebraska, New Mexico and West Virginia are
among the states that have imposed a variety of cost-saving measures
on their child-care efforts, with proposed restrictions being
considered in various other states, according to a recent report by
the Children's Defense Fund. Waiting lists have been expanding in
Florida, Indiana, Texas and Tennessee, it noted.</TE>
<TE>   "Low-income working families--those families working hard to stay
off of welfare--have suffered the most from cuts in state child-care
programs," according to the advocacy group.</TE>
<TE>   In North Carolina, the picture is mixed: Lawmakers cut one early
childhood program but sought to expand others. They recently added
$15 million to help those on the waiting list and a larger amount for
at-risk 4-year-olds. "Now we look to the federal level to see if
there are going to be additional funds," said Ball, who is closely
following proposals that would increase work requirements for parents
on welfare.</TE>
<TE>   In Washington, the House and Senate are billions of dollars apart
on what to spend on child care.</TE>
<TE>   This year, the House passed a welfare bill that would add $1
billion in mandatory funding for child care over the next five years.</TE>
<TE>   The Senate Finance Committee later approved its own welfare bill,
with a $5.5-billion increase for mandatory child-care spending over
the same period. In a noteworthy move, Senate Majority Leader Tom
Daschle (D-S.D.) opposed the bill of the Democrat-controlled
committee, declaring that he wanted to raise the dollar figure for
child care even more.</TE>
<TE>   As Congress struggles to resolve the issue, the matter of waiting
lists--and those who don't even bother to leave their names--will be
mentioned frequently. "If there's not an infusion of new child-care
money this year, you're leaving all these families in the lurch,"
said Helen Blank, director of child care at the Children's Defense
Fund.</TE>
<TE>   Still, those who counsel restraint in spending insist that such
fears are overblown and that those truly in need will be taken care
of.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not saying that a family that makes $28,000 a year could not
use some help in accessing child care," the HHS' Horn said. But, he
added, "The fact of the matter is, when you have a budget, there are
finite resources, and you have to set priorities."</TE>
<TE>   But he conceded that those seeking more child-care spending had
become a significant political force. "We understand that this is a
legislative process," he said, "and at the end of the day there's
probably going to be a higher [budget] number for child care."</TE>

<HD>High Court Scene of Showdown on Copyright Law</HD>
<DH>Constitution: The case will test Congress' power to extend
protection. Films from Hollywood's Golden Age play a key role in the
dispute.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID G. SAVAGE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Supreme Court for the first time this week will take a hard look
at one of the most important powers in the original Constitution,
under which Congress "for limited times" can give authors, inventors
and other creators the exclusive right to their works.</LD>
<LD>   How the court reads that phrase will decide who owns and controls
the films, books and songs that were created in the 1920s and 1930s.</LD>
<LD>   "This is about the movies from the Golden Age of Hollywood, and
the beginnings of American popular music," said Tyler T. Ochoa, a
copyright law expert at Whittier Law School. "There are literally
billions of dollars at stake here."</LD>
<TE>   This big-money Hollywood fight is not being waged by agents and
lobbyists. Instead, it involves historians and scholars of
"intellectual property" law.</TE>
<TE>   They say that Congress has lost sight of the original purpose of
the Constitution's copyright clause.</TE>
<TE>   "Their hope was that the government might help spur learning and
innovation," said Stanford Law School professor Lawrence Lessig,
referring to the authors of the Constitution. "Monopolies were to be
allowed, but only 'to promote progress' ... and only for limited
times," he said in his brief to the court.</TE>
<TE>   In the first copyright and patent acts, Congress in 1790 gave
authors and inventors a 14-year monopoly. After 14 years, living
authors could seek a 14-year extension of their copyrights, for a
total of 28 years.</TE>
<TE>   However, since the advent of the film industry in the 20th
century, Congress has extended the terms of copyrights repeatedly.</TE>
<TE>   In 1998, Congress with little debate added 20 years to all
copyrights. Now, works created by groups of people, such as films,
are protected for 95 years. Copyrights for individual works,
including books, extend for 70 years after the author's death.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, books, magazines, poems, films and songs that
appeared in the 1920s remain under copyright protection, even if
these works are long forgotten and have no commercial value.</TE>
<TE>   Between 1927 and 1931, 66,947 books were published in the United
States. Only 646 of them, fewer than 1%, remain in print, according
to the American Library Assn.</TE>
<TE>   Internet archivists say they could make such material easily and
freely available. For example, the New Yorker magazine from its early
days in the 1920s could be revived for a new audience, but Internet
publishers say the extended copyrights block them from adding such
material.</TE>
<TE>   Until this year, it was assumed the proper term for copyrights was
a matter for Congress alone. After all, the Constitution says, "The
Congress shall have the power to ... promote the progress of science
the useful arts, by securing for limited times to authors and
inventors the exclusive right to their respective writings and
discoveries."</TE>
<TE>   But under Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, the Supreme Court
has cast a skeptical eye at Congress.</TE>
<TE>   Rehnquist and his colleagues regularly repeat a line written in
1803 by Chief Justice John Marshall in Marbury vs. Madison, that the
"powers of the legislature are defined and limited." The Rehnquist
Court is happy to add the limits to Congress' power when lawmakers
exceed them.</TE>
<TE>   In recent years, for example, the justices have struck down
federal laws on gun possession and violence against women on the
grounds that these had nothing to do with the regulation of commerce.
Congress can regulate interstate commerce, Rehnquist said, but a
sexual assault is not commerce.</TE>
<TE>   In February, the court surprised copyright experts and
entertainment industry lawyers when it took up a broad challenge to
Congress' power to extend copyrights.</TE>
<TE>   The challengers say this extension of copyrights for older works
does not promote progress. It simply enriches the heirs of earlier
creators.</TE>
<TE>   But film industry leaders and the families of famous composers and
authors have fought back, arguing that they have the greatest
commitment to reviving old works for today's audience.</TE>
<TE>   Lawyers for the Motion Picture Assn. of America point to the
economics of restoring old movies.</TE>
<TE>   "Films are chemically fragile," they said in a brief to the court.
"They are very costly to preserve and restore, and yet they have the
potential--particularly because of recent technologies such as cable
television, videocassettes and DVDs--to remain commercially valuable
for many decades after they were originally released."</TE>
<TE>   "Extended copyright terms give [studios] the incentive to bear the
expense" of restoration, they argue. And therefore, Congress was
correct in thinking it would "promote progress" in the arts to extend
the copyrights for the films of the 1920s and 1930s, they conclude.</TE>
<TE>   Some film archivists say the reverse is true, that extended
copyrights are blocking new entrepreneurs and film buffs from
restoring forgotten works.</TE>
<TE>   "For those who care about film preservation, this [copyright
extension law] is a disaster," says Duke Law School professor James
Boyle.</TE>
<TE>   He filed a brief on behalf of Michael Agee and Hal Roach Studios,
which has restored the early Laurel and Hardy films.</TE>
<TE>   "The vast majority of the films that are 75 years old are orphans.
No one is watching over them. And because they are locked up by the
copyright extension, film buffs can't restore them," Boyle said.</TE>
<TE>   Another brief on behalf of children's authors, including Dr. Seuss
and E.B. White, argues that old characters can have a new life,
thanks to the commitment of the author's heirs.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Seuss' "How the Grinch Stole Christmas" was published in 1957.
Two years ago, it became a feature film hit during the Christmas
season. Similarly, E.B. White's lovable mouse, "Stuart Little," was
the star of two recent films.</TE>
<TE>   "These works have extended well beyond the lives of the author,"
says San Diego attorney Karl ZoBell. "And without the copyright
protection, it wouldn't have happened."</TE>
<TE>   He argues that the heirs can preserve the special character of an
earlier creation. "If you have T-shirts with the Cat in the Hat
smoking dope, it would destroy the attractiveness of the character,"
he said. Copyright owners can forbid such uses of the character.</TE>
<TE>   ZoBell also does not see why the "Internet crowd" should be given
a free right to make money on the creations of others.</TE>
<TE>   "Mr. Eldred hasn't created anything," he said, referring to Eric
Eldred, a retired computer programmer from Derry, N.H., who became
the lead plaintiff in the lawsuit.</TE>
<TE>   When his daughters were struggling with a homework assignment
involving "The Scarlet Letter," Eldred decided to scan several of
Nathaniel Hawthorne's books on to a Web site. He added helpful bits
of information as well.</TE>
<TE>   "It began as an experiment, and then it became a hobby," Eldred
said. But when he turned to short-story writer Ring Lardner, Eldred
ran into potential copyright troubles.</TE>
<TE>   "It's impossible to find out who owns the copyright when the
author is dead," he said.</TE>
<TE>   So, Eldred, a literary buff, became the plaintiff in the lawsuit
attacking the copyright extension.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, the Supreme Court will hear arguments in the case of
Eldred vs. Ashcroft.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Solicitor General Theodore B. Olson will be defending the law
and Congress' right to decide the proper terms for copyrights.</TE>
<TE>   In 1998, lawmakers moved to bring U.S. copyrights into line with
the longer terms that were standard in the European Union, and their
judgment should be upheld, Olson argues.</TE>

<HD>Coral Bleaching Found for First Time in Hawaiian Reefs</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>HONOLULU</DL>
<LD>Scientists have found the first evidence of coral bleaching in the
Hawaiian Islands, providing a worrisome sign of more potential
environmental damage from global warming.</LD>
<LD>   Coral bleaching happens when the algae that populate and build the
coral die off.</LD>
<LD>   The bleaching was discovered around the northwestern Hawaiian
Islands, 10 mostly uninhabited islets and atolls that extend 1,200
miles northwest of the main Hawaiian Islands. The reefs are some of
the most pristine in the world.</LD>
<TE>   Scientists said that the reefs probably will recover in a few
weeks but that the condition should be watched closely.</TE>
<TE>   "It's important not to overreact to the evidence of coral
bleaching we've observed during this trip," said Greta Aeby, a coral
biologist with the state. "In severe cases, coral bleaching can cause
mortality, but most mildly bleached colonies will recover in a few
weeks."</TE>
<TE>   Coral bleaching has increased worldwide over the last several
decades, particularly in Florida.</TE>

<HD>Vigil Presses for Defeat of Nevada's Anti-Gay Marriage
Initiative</HD>
<DH>Election: Question 2 says only a man and a woman may wed.
It passed easily in 2000, but must be approved again this year to
amend constitution.</DH>

<DL>RENO</DL>
<LD>An anti-gay marriage measure on Nevada's ballot for November was
branded as "discriminatory" and "hateful" on Saturday night at a
candlelight vigil sponsored by opponents of the initiative, Question
2.</LD>
<LD>   About 150 people, some holding placards reading "Support All
Families--Vote No on 2," gathered on the steps of the Washoe County
Courthouse to urge defeat of Question 2.</LD>
<LD>   The one-hour event was sponsored by the Stonewall Democrats of
Northern Nevada, an advocacy group for the gay, lesbian and bisexual
community.</LD>
<TE>   Speakers accused proponents of stirring hatred against gays and
lesbians, and of resorting to distortions to try to sell Question 2.</TE>
<TE>   They said the real purpose of Question 2 is not to protect
marriage, but to deny gays and lesbians the same rights enjoyed by
everyone else. They also noted that state law already defines
marriage as between only a man and a woman, and that Question 2's
defeat would not change that.</TE>
<TE>   "What Question 2 is really about is homophobic bigotry, plain and
simple," said Rabbi Myra Soifer of Reno's Temple Sinai. "If it
passes, the next thing we'll see is efforts to discriminate against
gays in other areas."</TE>
<TE>   The initiative, which defines marriage as only between a man and a
woman, passed in 2000 with 70% in favor; it must pass again this year
in order to amend the Nevada Constitution.</TE>
<TE>   Other speakers said they fear its final passage would influence
state legislators to side against same-sex couples on issues such as
hospital visitation rights, emergency health-care authority, joint
property rights and estate inheritance.</TE>
<TE>   "Question 2 is based on fear and hatred. Don't we already have
enough fear and hatred in the world?" asked the Rev. Sandy Jacob of
Circle's Edge Spiritual Center in Reno, a Religious Science Church.</TE>
<TE>   "It doesn't protect marriage," Jacob said. "It only promotes
discrimination."</TE>
<TE>   The Rev. Bruce Taylor of the Spanish Springs Presbyterian Church
of Sparks said that he and his church believe marriage is a
relationship between a man and a woman, but that he opposes Question
2.</TE>
<TE>   "Whose marriage will be endangered if Amendment 2 is not adopted?
No one's. The purpose of Amendment 2 is nothing but a spiteful
censure of good people," Taylor said.</TE>
<TE>   Dave Ward, a Reno businessman who's married with three children,
said he thinks the day is coming when U.S. society will embrace the
same rights for gays and lesbians.</TE>
<TE>   "They [supporters] call Question 2 protection of marriage. That's
ludicrous," he said. "It's about protecting the status quo that
denies same-sex marriage and other rights [to gays and lesbians]. The
change is coming and it's coming fast. Never doubt it."</TE>
<TE>   Republican Eddie Anderson of Reno also urged defeat of Question 2,
saying it's divisive and "demonizes those who live outside the
religious mainstream."</TE>
<TE>   After the speeches, the crowd lighted candles and joined in a
closing prayer.</TE>
<TE>   Harold Ballinger, head of the Stonewall Democrats chapter, said
opponents are encouraged by polls that show support for Question 2
has declined since 2000.</TE>
<TE>   A statewide poll in July conducted by the Las Vegas Review-Journal
newspaper and reviewjournal.com found that 55% of those responding
supported recognition of marriage only if it is between a male and a
female, 38% opposed the proposal, and 7% were undecided.</TE>
<TE>   The Stonewall Democrats of Southern Nevada plans to hold a similar
candlelight vigil in Las Vegas this month.</TE>

<HD>Democratic Presidential Hopefuls Differ on War in Iraq</HD>
<DH>Iowa: Two possible candidates question a military solution
at a party fund-raiser; a third tells the dovish crowd he would back
use of force.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RONALD BROWNSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>DES MOINES</DL>
<LD>Three likely 2004 Democratic presidential candidates differed over
President Bush's policy in Iraq on Saturday night before an audience
of influential grass-roots Democratic activists openly skeptical of a
second war in the Persian Gulf.</LD>
<LD>   At a fund-raising dinner for the Iowa Democratic Party, Sen. John
F. Kerry (D-Mass.) and Vermont Gov. Howard Dean drew sustained
applause with sharp questions about the move toward war with Iraq.
Sen. John Edwards (D-N.C.) has indicated he would support a
congressional resolution authorizing Bush to use force against Iraq,
but he alluded only briefly and obliquely to that view in his speech.</LD>
<LD>   Iowa is a critical audience for the possible Democratic
presidential contenders because its caucus in January 2004 will kick
off the race for the party's nomination. Historically, the Democratic
activists who participate in the Iowa caucuses have leaned toward
dovish positions on national security issues--and that inclination
was evident again Saturday night in the applause for the criticism
from Kerry and Dean. Kerry repeatedly expressed skepticism about
launching an American attack on Iraq without broad international
support--though he never explicitly said that he would oppose a
resolution authorizing Bush to invade when the Senate votes, probably
this week.</LD>
<TE>   "I am prepared to hold Saddam Hussein accountable and destroy his
weapons of mass destruction," Kerry declared. "I would be willing to
be the first to put my uniform back on and go defend this country.
But I don't think we should pretend that protecting the security of
our nation is defined by turning our back on a century of effort ...
to build an international structure of law and to live by those
standards." Kerry, citing his experience as a Vietnam veteran, was
most impassioned in defending the right of critics to ask questions
and dissent from Bush's policy.</TE>
<TE>   "We need to understand that you have to ask those questions now,
because you don't go to war as a matter of first resort; you go to
war as a matter of last resort," he said. Dean, who is already
actively seeking the nomination, said he feared that the nation "will
engage in unwise conduct and send our children to die without having
an adequate explanation from the president of the United States." And
he argued that Bush has not fairly explained to the nation how long
American troops may need to be stationed in Iraq after a war.</TE>
<TE>   "The president has never said that if we go into Iraq we will be
there for 10 years to build that democracy ... and the president must
tell us that before we go," Dean said. He implied that the drive
toward war was being fueled by concern over access to oil. "If we had
a renewable energy policy in this country," he charged, "we would not
be sending kids to die in Iraq." Edwards cited his support for Bush
on Iraq only in passing--and muffled it in a charge that the
administration was rolling back civil liberties at home. "It is right
in my judgment to stand up to Saddam Hussein," Edwards said to
notable silence. Then he drew applause when he added: "But it is
wrong in the name of war, in the name of the war on terrorism, to let
this administration take away our rights." Among the potential 2004
Democratic candidates, Dean has most directly opposed Bush's moves
toward war in Iraq. Kerry and former Vice President Al Gore have
pointedly questioned Bush's direction, while indicating they could
support the use of force under some circumstances. Edwards, House
Minority Leader Richard A. Gephardt of Missouri and Sen. Joseph I.
Lieberman (D-Conn.) have said they will back Bush's push for
congressional authorization to use force against Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   The evening was a testament to the cross pressures facing the
potential 2004 Democratic presidential candidates on Iraq. Though
polls show the country overall would support military action against
Hussein, Democratic partisans have been much more skeptical than
other Americans. And in Iowa, which exemplifies the historic
Midwestern suspicion of foreign entanglements, those sentiments are
probably stronger than elsewhere. Because the state picks its
presidential delegates through a caucus, where turnout is usually
much lower than in a primary, well-organized anti-war and arms
control groups have been able to exert significant influence in years
when their issues are prominent. In 1984, for instance, the
controversy over the nuclear freeze propelled George McGovern to a
surprise third-place finish in the caucus.</TE>
<TE>   "Given what a small number of Democrats go to the caucus, if the
peace groups organize themselves on this issue--as they will--they
can play a much larger role than people expect," said David W.
Loebsack, a professor of political science at Cornell College in
Mount Vernon, Iowa. In the hallways before the dinner, the talk among
the Democratic activists was overwhelmingly hostile toward the
prospect of another war with Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   Democrats filing into the dinner questioned the morality, the
costs and the timing of the war--often in highly pointed language.
Several said they believed Bush was manufacturing the confrontation
to benefit Republicans in the midterm elections and to divert
attention from dissatisfaction over the economy. "It's so obvious
what is going on and nobody will speak up," said Richard Black, a
retired professor from Farnhamville. "It's all political, a means of
keeping attention away from the economy and the stock market." Some
argued that it was against American tradition for the U.S. to
initiate a war without the threat of an imminent attack. "The U.S.
doesn't start wars; it finishes them," said Jerry Alexander from
Ames.</TE>
<TE>   Others worried about the commitment the U.S. would face to
reconstruct Iraq after a war. "We need to be very cautious about
getting into another conflict that could tie us up for decades," said
Tom Beell, a Vietnam veteran who teaches journalism at Iowa State
University in Ames. Several of those awaiting the speeches said they
were less likely to support a candidate, such as Edwards or Gephardt,
who was backing Bush on the war. "I don't think war is a solution for
anything; it just causes more problems," said Yvonne Gaudes, a
teacher from Oelwein.</TE>
<TE>   Local observers say these anti-war sentiments are probably more
intense among hard-core Democratic activists than among Democrats
overall--much less the state itself. Despite his support for Bush on
the war, Edwards was received at least as enthusiastically as Kerry
and Dean. And its unclear whether any rancor over Iraq would last
long enough to influence a vote more than a year away. But the
strength of the emotions expressed at the dinner suggest that
opposition to the war may open a vein of support among activists for
candidates critical of the war, like Dean or Gore.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, Gore--who didn't attend the dinner but is expected in the
state to campaign for Democratic congressional candidates next
week--received lavish praise from several attending for his recent
San Francisco speech raising sharp questions about Bush's direction
on Iraq. "Quite frankly, I'm really happy that Gore broke the ice and
talked about something that was important, and I'd like to hear more
of that from the others," Black said.</TE>

<HD>Louisiana Residents Look Beyond the Wild Weather for
Flooding Source</HD>
<DH>Disaster: After staying dry during decades of hurricanes,
some folks see human hands behind community's latest woes.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SLIDELL, La.</DL>
<LD>Back-to-back floods have residents of the sedate community of Palm
Lake wondering if more than wretched weather is to blame.</LD>
<LD>   Tropical Storm Isidore unleashed torrential rains and 8-foot tidal
surges, flooding 295 homes in the town nestled in a thick canopy of
pines on the north shore of Lake Pontchartrain.</LD>
<LD>   Hurricane Lili added to the misery Thursday. Residents watched as
homes flooded again. Lili was a Category 4 hurricane packing 145-mph
winds before it weakened substantially and hit land.</LD>
<TE>   But residents are puzzled: After staying dry during decades of
hurricanes, why did Palm Lake flood this time?</TE>
<TE>   Lakefront development adds to runoff, and closing New Orleans
floodgates swells Lake Pontchartrain even more.</TE>
<TE>   But some residents say a recently installed city pumping station
is pumping water out of Slidell's streets and into canals through
Palm Lake, a subdivision within the larger town.</TE>
<TE>   "Nah," said John Menner, a retired ironworker who has been living
in Palm Lake since 1979. "I can bet you a buck that a pump didn't
flood us out."</TE>
<TE>   "I think you're wrong," his son, James Menner, a 37-year-old
commercial fisherman, shot back.</TE>
<TE>   When the pump's going, James Menner said, he's seen the waters
rise. "It would be like pouring a 12-ounce beer into a 6-ounce cup.
Where's it going to go?"</TE>
<TE>   Pumping stations have been a point of contention for years,
Slidell Mayor Ben Morris said. But, he says, blame nature, not
engineering mistakes.</TE>
<TE>   "People have suffered a tragedy. They're looking for answers.
They'll blame anything," Morris said.</TE>
<TE>   Mel Standridge, a retired pharmaceutical salesman, says he'll go
to his congressman if need be. After Isidore, Rep. David Vitter
(R-La.) said the solution was to raise homes on pilings out of the
flood plain at government expense.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm going to sit down and have a talk with him if I have to go to
Washington," Standridge said, taking a break from packing a rental
truck with what's left of his soggy belongings.</TE>
<TE>   "This is something that needs to be done. I've seen the government
send money overseas, send it to New York for the disaster there.
We're asking for but a few million dollars," Standridge said.</TE>
<TE>   Some coastal areas were just being reopened Saturday to residents
who had evacuated. Among them was Cypremort Point in south St. Mary
Parish, one of the first communities struck by the storm.</TE>
<TE>   Electricity still was out in the area and only homeowners were
allowed back in for cleanup, and they were asked to leave by
nightfall. "There'll be no sightseeing down there for a while,"
Sheriff David Naquin said.</TE>
<TE>   Across the state, power remained out for at least 130,000
residents. Federal Emergency Management Agency teams were reviewing
damage but had yet to set a damage estimate. FEMA officials said
nearly 30,000 property owners had registered damage by Saturday
afternoon in the state.</TE>
<TE>   Also Saturday, a Mississippi company bought an ad in a New Orleans
newspaper apologizing for Gov. Ronnie Musgrove's refusal to make
Interstate 59 a one-way hurricane evacuation route in the state for
Louisiana residents.</TE>
<TE>   "We believe Gov. Ronnie Musgrove's decision is lacking moral
soundness and stewardship associated with good leadership," said the
ad in the Times-Picayune paid for by TCB Construction Co. of
Poplarville, Miss.</TE>
<TE>   Musgrove announced his decision shortly after Isidore hit in late
September, saying it would drain manpower needed if the hurricane hit
his state.</TE>
<TE>   When Lili worsened to Category 4, Louisiana Gov. Mike Foster said
Musgrove had assured him that the 21 miles from the state line to
Poplarville would be made one-way if needed. But it wasn't.</TE>
<TE>   Also, rough surf from Lili in the Gulf of Mexico off Florida was
blamed for a woman's drowning.</TE>

<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Gov. George Pataki won the endorsement of former Democratic governor
Hugh L. Carey.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm proud of the job Gov. Pataki has done and believe he's the
best choice to lead us through the challenges we face ahead," Carey
said at a Manhattan news conference with the incumbent governor.</LD>
<LD>   "He has been a master at managing New York through some of our
most difficult times, and he's the right person to keep our state on
the road to recovery. George ... you are the top Republican governor
in history."</LD>
<TE>   Moments earlier, Pataki was endorsed by the New Era Democrats--the
first time the independent group has endorsed a Republican for
statewide office. Other Democrats, including former New York City
Mayor Edward I. Koch, former Queens Borough President Claire Shulman,
state Sen. Olga Mendez and the Chinatown Democratic Club have already
backed Pataki.</TE>
<TE>   The endorsements came a day after Pataki reported to the state
Board of Elections that he had nearly $12.2 million for his campaign.
His Democratic rival, H. Carl McCall, said he had just over $1.1
million.</TE>

<HD>Caution the Watchword as Sniper Sought</HD>
<DH>Crime: As the hunt goes on for a sharpshooter who has
killed six, residents try to carry on life as usual--though it isn't
usual at all now.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<DL>SILVER SPRING, Md.</DL>
<LD>Matt Olsen's soccer team has 13 girls, a baker's dozen, and every one
of them showed up to play Saturday morning in their blue shirts and
shin guards. It looked like any other glorious weekend on the grassy
field at Oakland Terrace Elementary School here in the Washington
suburbs. Except for the police cars posted along the sidelines.</LD>
<LD>   As the hunt continued for a sharpshooter who is killing innocents
with chilling precision, the people of Montgomery County pretended to
carry on life as usual when it wasn't usual at all. Late Saturday,
police confirmed that a seventh person had been targeted in random
attacks by a skilled marksman whose victims crossed lines of gender,
race and age.</LD>
<LD>   All were struck down by someone with no apparent regard for day or
night or location. Until late Saturday, the linked shootings were all
within a 20-mile radius in suburban Washington. Five people were
killed in Montgomery County, a sixth on a street corner in
Washington. Confirmation of a seventh victim late Saturday indicated
the shooter had broadened his sights: authorities said a woman shot
in the back Friday in Frederickburg, Va., about 80 miles from
suburban Washington, was a victim of the same shooter. She survived
the attack.</LD>
<TE>   The settings seem haphazardly chosen. On Saturday evening, police
still had no profile of a killer to offer.</TE>
<TE>   The slayings left Montgomery County on edge. On Saturday morning
chores were dispatched with a watchful eye. A grocery store manager
pumped gas just after dawn, making sure the pump was between him and
a clear shot from the street. An elderly couple out for a morning
constitutional in the park ducked into a shopping mall to get off the
streets. A mother offered to pick out a pair of homecoming shoes so
her daughter wouldn't have to go out. A high school junior drove to
the full-serve island at the gas station, paying extra for the
reassurance of not having to get out of her car.</TE>
<TE>   Here, they are struggling to make sense of a situation that is in
the heart of their neighborhoods and beyond their control, on the
fringes of a capital city debating war, across the river from a
Pentagon still rebuilding.</TE>
<TE>   The soccer field where Olsen's team plays sits about a mile from
the Shell service station where Lori Ann Lewis-Rivera, 25, was shot
dead Thursday morning while vacuuming her minivan. Parents conferred
before allowing their children to play outside on the breezy autumn
day. They decided to go ahead with the game, but at 10 a.m. the coach
called police and asked for protection.</TE>
<TE>   "Do you just stay home?" Olsen, a federal prosecutor in
Washington, asked as his players devoured their postgame snacks.
"These girls are 8 years old and there is definitely a psychological
cost to saying we aren't going out today because there is a bad man
out there shooting people."</TE>
<TE>   Parents were careful not to say too much in front of their
children. What was there to say, anyway? Someone with a high-powered
rifle and expert marksmanship is shooting people in the course of
ordinary life--a cabdriver fueling up at a Mobil station, a woman
sitting on a bench in front of a business, a man on a lawn mower,
another man walking in a parking lot.</TE>
<TE>   So residents in this county pumped gas, walked dogs, shopped and
peered over their shoulders, unsure precisely what they were looking
for. A figure lurking in the distance? There are 873,000 people here.
A white box truck? There are more than a million registered vehicles
in suburban Maryland.</TE>
<TE>   After all, it is a white box truck that delivers cigarettes to the
Wheaton Shell station that Trevor Wetzlaff manages, several blocks
from the Shell where bouquets and U.S. flags now sit. And with all
the publicity, would the killer be foolish enough to still be driving
one?</TE>
<TE>   "I'm looking for something out of the ordinary, something out of
place, but I'm not sure what," said Wetzlaff, whose business has
dropped by half since word of the killings got around. "I think
people are just nervous about being at a gas station in general.
Everybody who comes in talks about it."</TE>
<TE>   Outside Wetzlaff's glass office, Debbie Skolnik filled the tank of
her black Acura, squinting to keep the sun out of her eyes. The
prices are higher than the station she usually patronizes, but
somebody died there, so she avoided it.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been watching, looking," said Skolnik, a librarian at
Suburban Hospital in nearby Bethesda, where two of the victims were
taken. "I've been in every place in Montgomery County that killer
struck. Now I have to think, 'Where am I going to get gas? Which
station might be safer than another?' "</TE>
<TE>   The string of random killings has been made worse by the thought
of terrorism--a theory police have not ruled out. Some people
confessed they'd feel slightly relieved if it turned out to be just
one nut with military-style training acting alone. No matter who is
behind it, though, it felt like terrorism just the same.</TE>
<TE>   Ken Warden, a facilities manager for a boat owners association,
sat in a Jeep Wrangler outside a Safeway store in Kensington. He
happened to be in front of the Pentagon the morning of Sept. 11,
2001; the roar of the plane rang in his ears for months afterward.
Now he found himself in a parking lot where some believe the killer
might have stationed himself to draw a bead on Lewis-Rivera as she
vacuumed her vehicle.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the same kind of uneasiness and vulnerability," Warden said.
"Whether or not it's linked to Al Qaeda or the Middle East, it has
the same effect."</TE>
<TE>   With nothing official to go on, some took comfort in the
statistics. "There are 3 million people living in the Washington area
and we have maybe two shooters, so the probability of being shot is
rather low," Jerry Carter, a 61-year-old artist from Silver Spring
said, repeating what he told his 8-year-old daughter when she
wondered why a police car was parked outside of her school last week.</TE>
<TE>   But the police chief had another statistic--the Montgomery County
murder rate just jumped 25%.</TE>
<TE>   "These are equal opportunity murderers, they don't discriminate.
Their trucks take the same route we all take," Carter conceded,
heading into Safeway for milk and fruit. On the way, he handed a
dollar to 80-year-old Vincent Sebastiano, a loyal member of the
Knights of Columbus, standing outdoors in plain sight and proud of
it.</TE>
<TE>   "My wife said, 'Don't go out there!' " shouted Sebastiano, who
came here from Italy in 1946 but still has his accent. "I'm a
grandfather and a family man. I've served the Knights of Columbus 20
years. I'm not gonna be a chicken! Whatever will be will be."</TE>
<TE>   Montgomery County Police reported receiving nearly 7,000 tips, but
no real leads. They know that five of the seven victims were shot
with the same .223-caliber rifle. Police Chief Charles A. Moose said
the bullets from the other two shootings were probably too damaged to
yield clues.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Myrna and Van Olsen watched their granddaughter trot
off the soccer field. They've lived in Montgomery County for more
than 45 years and lately, it seems there is always some new kind of
worry.</TE>
<TE>   "It feels like we are always waiting for the other shoe to drop,"
said Myrna Olsen, a retired school nurse who raced to pick up her
grandson last week when afternoon kindergarten was canceled. "Not
that many years ago, the most disruptive thing that happened at
school was a snowstorm."</TE>

<HD>Working With Chicago Requires a Disclosure on Slavery</HD>
<DH>Policy: The city is the first to demand that companies
report any links to the trade.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC SLATER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>CHICAGO</DL>
<LD>The City Council was about to vote on an ordinance requiring all
companies doing business with the city to reveal any past
"investments or profits from the slave industry." Alderman Burton F.
Natarus made it quite clear how he expected his colleagues to come
down on the issue.</LD>
<LD>   He insisted on a roll call vote, "in which everybody says 'aye' or
'nay' and stands up for the right thing to do," Natarus announced at
the council meeting last week.</LD>
<LD>   Two of the city's 50 aldermen were not present, and Mayor Richard
M. Daley publicly and uncharacteristically excused them. That left
48. Four abstained from the vote.</LD>
<TE>   The final tally: 44 ayes, 0 nays.</TE>
<TE>   With the passage, Chicago--whose 1.1 million African American
residents make up about one-third of the city's population--became
the first city in the United States to require all businesses to
research and report on any ties they had to the slave trade. The
effort is likely to affect a handful of insurance companies, perhaps
a railroad or two and a couple of banks.</TE>
<TE>   The vote seemed so clearly political, however, the Slavery Era
Disclosure Ordinance so lacking in teeth, it is unclear what, if any,
effect the law might have on its sponsor's ultimate goal: securing
reparations for the descendants of slaves.</TE>
<TE>   If companies "don't come clean, they won't get anything,"
Alderwoman Dorothy J. Tillman, a vocal supporter of reparations, told
reporters after the vote on her proposal. She went so far as to
suggest that companies that might have conducted slave-related
business, often through predecessor companies, could be shut out of
city contracts even if they do acknowledge such histories.</TE>
<TE>   Alderman Edward M. Burke, arguably the second-most powerful
Chicago politician after Daley, announced from the council floor that
CSX Railroad--a company whose predecessors are believed to have used
slave labor--would not be granted zoning approvals it is seeking
until the company pays reparations, even though such compensation is
not included in the ordinance.</TE>
<TE>   "If they start threatening companies ... then we may be talking
about extortion," said Robert Bennett, former dean of Northwestern
University Law School.</TE>
<TE>   "It's all pretty bizarre," he added. "It's politics. There is a
public interest in having history about slavery, but this is a
strange way of going about compiling that history."</TE>
<TE>   The national debate over reparations for African Americans has
simmered off and on for years, with Rep. John Conyers Jr. (D-Mich.)
doing much to keep it alive by introducing a bill to study the issue
in every congressional session since 1989. His bill has never been
passed, however.</TE>
<TE>   The reparations movement has picked up at least some steam in
recent years after compensation was awarded to Holocaust survivors
and Japanese Americans interned during World War II, and proponents
have begun to focus their efforts.</TE>
<TE>   Two years ago, the California Legislature passed the Slaveholder
Insurance Policy Act, which requires insurers who did business during
the slavery era to research their records and report the names of
slaves they insured and the slaveholders who took out the policies.</TE>
<TE>   The vast majority of California insurers reported that they had
been incorporated after slavery was outlawed, according to a report
by the California Department of Insurance. A few others said they had
conducted business during the period but could find no records
relating to slave policies. Eight companies said they had issued life
insurance policies on slaves and revealed the names of 614 insured
slaves and 433 slaveholders.</TE>
<TE>   The department has published the findings on its Web site but
plans no further action. The law requires only that insurers disclose
their activities, not that they pay reparations.</TE>
<TE>   The Chicago ordinance is based on the California law, but goes a
step further in that it requires all businesses with city contracts,
not just insurance companies, to research and report any slave trade
history, with documentation to be filed with the city's Department of
Purchasing. Beyond that, it is not clear what will happen with the
information.</TE>
<TE>   Supporters of the ordinance are eagerly awaiting the filings of
several companies, including CSX and FleetBoston Financial Corp. Both
companies are defendants in a class-action lawsuit filed this spring
that alleges they, or their predecessor companies, profited from
slave labor.</TE>
<TE>   One of the founders of a FleetBoston predecessor, the Providence
Bank of Rhode Island, owned slave ships, though the company says
there is no evidence the bank itself was involved in the slave trade.
FleetBoston, through a trust, recently received a $27-million city
subsidy to construct a 31-story building in the city's financial
district, the Loop.</TE>
<TE>   CSX, some of whose predecessor companies are believed to have used
slaves in building their rail lines, has a large facility on
Chicago's South Side and, like many businesses, has sought financial
and political help from the city.</TE>
<TE>   When such companies reveal their past, ordinance supporters argue,
they may not receive the warm welcomes of the past.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm sure there would be a great deal of reluctance on the part of
many members of the council to do business with some of the companies
... unless the company states that it regrets what it's done and lays
out the steps it has made to become a good corporate citizen," Burke
said in an interview.</TE>
<TE>   Sean McManamy, spokesman for the American Insurance Assn., said
the group's member companies that conducted business with Chicago
would adhere to its rules.</TE>
<TE>   But, he added, "Can you go back and right a societal wrong by
opening up insurance contracts from 150, 200 years ago? Certainly
there was plenty of societal guilt to go around with respect to
slavery. Will this help? I don't know."</TE>
<TE>   Passage of the ordinance was Tillman's second local success in an
effort she hopes eventually will lead to reparations nationally for
about 30 million descendants of slaves.</TE>
<TE>   Known for her big hats and sometimes over-the-top rhetoric,
Tillman, who represents the city's largely African American 3rd Ward,
sponsored a 2000 ordinance urging Congress to pass a reparations
bill. That ordinance passed 49 to 1.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike the 2000 ordinance, which simply made a recommendation, the
new law mandates action by the companies; but it provides no
enforcement tools, no budget to investigate, nor guidelines
indicating what should happen if a company did profit from slavery.
Skeptics predicted it would do little, and likely be invoked only
when an alderman sought to block a contract or project.</TE>
<TE>   Proponents of slave reparations face all the legal and moral
questions Japanese American internees faced in their quest for
compensation, and more: from who might receive it--seven or eight or
nine generations removed from the enslaved person--to the fact that,
under the law of the time, slavery was legal.</TE>
<TE>   Before its unanimous vote, the Chicago City Council did little to
probe such difficult questions. All the witnesses addressing the
aldermen spoke in favor of the ordinance.</TE>

<HD>Terrorism Case Shows U.S. Moving Proactively</HD>
<DH>Oregon: Some groups question tactic, wonder whether Muslims
are being targeted for beliefs.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICK J. McDONNELL and PETER Y. HONG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>PORTLAND, Ore.</DL>
<LD>The alleged terrorists headed for Afghanistan at a time when the
Taliban were on the run. They left the United States at a time when,
authorities say, Al Qaeda's leadership was eager to have recruits on
the ground here.</LD>
<LD>   Money for their alleged scheme came from associates using real
names and easily traceable wire transfers--with amounts typically
just a few hundred dollars. They took target practice openly at a
rural gravel pit, attracting the attention of a deputy sheriff.</LD>
<LD>   The indictment against the six alleged terrorists unveiled here
Friday is more suggestive of a group of bumbling, would-be holy
warriors than the case's chilling implication: the nurturing of
terrorist soldiers on U.S. soil. "The enemy recruits in this country,
it trains in this country, it plans in this country and acts in this
country," Charles Mathews, chief FBI agent in Portland, said in
announcing the arrests.</LD>
<TE>   Of course, the court filings only sketch the case against the six
U.S. citizens. Officials refused to offer details, and they say much
evidence remains secret. Still, federal authorities note that the
lack of criminal sophistication apparent in this and other recent
terrorism cases does not mean the suspects were not capable of deadly
violence--or manipulation by the professional terrorist groups that
they allegedly sought out.</TE>
<TE>   "The potential consequences are very serious, especially when
you're talking about international terrorists finding a recruiting
ground in our country," cautioned one FBI official in the Northwest.
"What would happen if they had a Mohamed Atta to help them?" the
official added, referring to one of the leaders of last year's
terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon.</TE>
<TE>   Since Sept. 11, 2001, authorities explain that they have adopted a
deliberate strategy of preventive arrests--even if the evidence is
imperfect--in the hopes of disrupting terrorist plans.</TE>
<TE>   "It's important for us to be out there preventing attacks," John
McKay, the U.S. attorney in Seattle, said after U.S. native Earnest
James Ujaama was charged with aiding Al Qaeda.</TE>
<TE>   The proactive approach provokes concern from civil libertarians
and others who question the evidence and wonder whether Muslims are
being targeted for unpopular political beliefs.</TE>
<TE>   "While everyone agrees that fighting terrorism must be a top
priority at all levels, there is no evidence that any of these U.S.
citizens was planning an attack," said Peter Schey, executive
director of the Center for Human Rights and International Law in Los
Angeles. "And one has to question the arrests of a handful of alleged
sardines while the big fish are apparently swimming away."</TE>
<TE>   And even veteran prosecutors acknowledge that the task of
preventing prospective attacks poses a challenge for a justice system
geared toward catching and convicting criminals who have already
committed crimes.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't want to prosecute people for their beliefs or their
thoughts, but rather for their actions," said Robert S. Litt, a
former senior Justice Department official in the Clinton
administration. "On the other hand, the goals of national security
sometimes require that you take action against people before they
have a chance to act on their beliefs."</TE>
<TE>   In the Portland case, there is no public allegation that any of
the six suspects planned attacks on the United States or had contacts
with known Al Qaeda members. It is not even clear if any of the
suspects ever made it into Afghanistan, where five of them allegedly
sought to fight on behalf of the Taliban after the Sept. 11 attacks.
That alleged desire--and the suspects' efforts to act on it--is at
the core of the case against them.</TE>
<TE>   The four-count indictment, which includes charges of conspiring to
"levy war against the United States," alleges that the suspects
attempted to provide support to the Al Qaeda terrorist organization
and Afghanistan's ruling Taliban government. The indictment alleges
that as early as the summer of 2001, the six suspects began
unspecified physical training with an eye toward traveling to
Afghanistan and joining the Taliban jihad.</TE>
<TE>   After last year's attacks, the indictment alleges that the
suspects began weapons training. It charges that four of the men
traveled from Portland to a rural gravel pit on private property just
across the Columbia River in Washington to practice their shooting
skills there.</TE>
<TE>   The next month, the five male defendants began plans to go to
Afghanistan, buying airline tickets to Hong Kong with mid-October
departures from Portland, the indictment says. One defendant
discarded his personal belongings in preparation for the trip, it
says.</TE>
<TE>   The indictment places several of them in Hong Kong, mainland China
and Bangladesh at various times, and notes that three of the five who
left the country returned to the U.S. after apparently failing to
gain entry to Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   All but one are U.S. natives, including several African American
converts to Islam. Several are believed to have worshiped at a mosque
here, the Islamic Center of Portland (or Masjed As-Saber), which is
close to the apartment complexes where three suspects lived. The
mosque's prayer leader was arrested last month by a federal
anti-terrorism task force on charges of Social Security fraud. No
terrorism charges have been brought in that case, but prosecutors
argued that the imam was a potential threat to the community and
should remain jailed.</TE>
<TE>   Worshipers at the large, well-appointed mosque have complained
about being targeted, and, after the indictments were released
Friday, men there turned away waves of inquiring journalists who
approached during prayer hours.</TE>
<TE>   "We are being followed everywhere," said one obviously distressed
worshiper, who declined to give his name.</TE>
<TE>   Another former mosque frequenter, Ali Khaled Steitiye, was
sentenced last month to 2 1/2 years in prison for various weapon and
fraud charges. But the federal judge refused prosecutors' requests to
impose a harsher penalty because Steitiye, a naturalized U.S.
citizen, ideologically supports the militant Middle Eastern group
Hamas, which the U.S. government lists as a terrorist organization.</TE>
<TE>   Steitiye figured prominently in last week's Portland arrests as an
"unindicted co-conspirator" who allegedly participated in the target
practice session in rural Washington on Sept. 29, 2001. The
indictment calls the training episode a warmup for fighting alongside
the Taliban. A neighbor complained about the shooting and a sheriff's
deputy responded, later writing a report documenting his suspicions
about men in Muslim garb firing a Chinese assault rifle and other
weapons less than three weeks after the Sept. 11 attacks. That report
eventually helped break the case, authorities say.</TE>
<TE>   The six suspects have varied histories, but apparently shared
political kinship opposing U.S. polices in Afghanistan, as well as
religious beliefs.</TE>
<TE>   Patrice Lumumba Ford, 31, is a scholar in Mandarin Chinese and the
son of a former member of the Black Panther Party, according to
reports here. After graduating from Portland State University with a
degree in international studies, the Oregonian newspaper reported, he
completed a yearlong language program at Johns Hopkins University. He
changed his name in honor of the former leader of the Congo, ousted
in a plot aided by the CIA. He was also a former intern for Portland
Mayor Vera Katz, but in August 2001 he sent messages to the mayor's
staff that were regarded as threatening and were reported to police.
Neighbors said he spoke Chinese with his wife, had an 18-month-old
son and taught physical education for a time.</TE>
<TE>   Jeffrey Leon Battle, 32, is an ex-Army reservist who struggled to
make a living as a security guard and support his young son. The
indictment alleges that he joined the Army Reserve "in order to
receive training in United States military tactics and weapons which
he ultimately intended to use against the United States and in
support of [Al Qaeda] and the Taliban." Military officials, however,
say he enlisted in 1999, two years before the Sept. 11 attacks.</TE>
<TE>   He went to basic training in South Carolina in February 2000 and
then failed to show at his reserve unit in Oregon later that year. He
was administratively discharged in 2002.</TE>
<TE>   Battle's ex-wife, October Martinique Lewis, also was indicted--one
of only two U.S. women known to have been charged in post-Sept. 11
terrorism cases. She allegedly wired money to her ex-husband as he
attempted to enter Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   Two other brothers--Muhammad Ibrahim Bilal, 22, who was arrested
in Michigan, and Ahmed Ibrahim Bilal, 24, who is still at large--were
somewhat of an oddity at a suburban mosque here because they spoke
fluent Arabic and have family ties to Saudi Arabia.</TE>
<TE>   The eldest suspect is a 36-year-old Jordanian, Habis Abdullah al
Saoub, who allegedly left behind a mysterious "martyr's will"
directed to a well-known holy warrior before departing en route to
Afghanistan. He also is a fugitive.</TE>
<TE>   Many details about the six suspects' lives remained obscure
Saturday as relatives living in the Portland area hunkered inside
their homes, refusing to open their doors to reporters or return
telephone messages.</TE>
<TE>   One exception was James Britt, a Eugene attorney, who vociferously
denied that Ford, who is his brother, has terrorism links.</TE>
<TE>   "It's all a political game. It's all hype. It's all part of the
hysteria," Britt told Associated Press. "We are going to be with him.
We are going to support him every step of the way."</TE>

<HD>First Female Pilot for Airlines Honored at Women's Hall of

<DL>SENECA FALLS, N.Y.</DL>
<LD>Pilot Emily Howell Warner recalls basking in the accolades that
greeted her assignment as the first woman to join the flight crew of
a U.S. airline in February 1973.</LD>
<LD>   But the glory faded fast.</LD>
<LD>   On her second flight, when the captain stepped into the cockpit,
"I walked over and put out my hand," she said. "He looked at me and
said, 'I don't shake hands.' He only said six more words to me,
'Don't touch anything on the airplane.' And I said 'OK, sir." '</LD>
<TE>   That was then. On Saturday, Warner was inducted into the National
Women's Hall of Fame, alongside trailblazers such as Justice Ruth
Bader Ginsburg, the second woman appointed to the U.S. Supreme Court,
and the late Katharine Graham, who built the Washington Post into a
leading force in journalism.</TE>
<TE>   The honor roll of 19 women includes 13 whose enshrinement in 2001
was postponed by the Sept. 11 attacks. Among them are actress Lucille
Ball, former First Lady Rosalynn Carter and Althea Gibson, the first
black tennis champion at Wimbledon.</TE>
<TE>   The hall was established in 1969 in Seneca Falls, a village in
western New York's Finger Lakes region where the first known women's
rights convention was held in 1848. Women won the right to vote in
1920.</TE>
<TE>   Warner had accrued 7,000 hours as a flight instructor in Denver by
the time Frontier Airlines broke the barrier against hiring female
pilots. Her historic flight as second officer went from Denver to Las
Vegas on Feb. 6, 1973.</TE>
<TE>   Early on, the trick was "trying to be professional, not trying to
be pushy or anything," Warner said. Within six months, she'd been
promoted to first officer and took her turns at the controls. She
soon progressed to captain and, in 1986, commanded the first female
flight crew.</TE>
<TE>   Warner spent 15 years at Frontier and later flew for Continental
Airlines and United Parcel Service. She retired this summer at age
62.</TE>

<HD>New Law Aids Deposit Returns</HD>

<AU>Diane Wedner</AU>

<DL></DL>
<LD>After intensive lobbying by renters' advocates, Gov. Gray Davis last
week signed into law a bill that helps ensure that tenants receive a
fair share of their security deposits when they vacate an apartment.</LD>
<LD>   The law gives tenants the right to a landlord inspection two weeks
before moving out, allowing them to make minor repairs as specified
in the rental agreement, and to clarify the extent of cleaning
necessary to receive back as much of the security deposit as
possible, said Peter Kuhns, a spokesman for the Assn. of Community
Organizations for Reform Now, a leading supporter of the bill, which
was AB 2330.</LD>
<LD>   Under the terms of the law, which had been sponsored by
Assemblywoman Carol Migden (D-San Francisco), landlords are
prohibited from charging expensive "tenant initiation fees," padded
costs sometimes imposed on tenants seeking rentals in low-vacancy
cities such as San Francisco.</LD>
<TE>   Additionally, it increases the maximum damages that tenants can
collect from landlords who, in bad faith, fail to return security
deposits. The ceiling had been $600. Under the law, which takes
effect Jan. 1, a tenant may collect up to twice the amount of the
security deposit.</TE>

<HD>Management Company Won't Shield the Homeowners</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEPHEN GLASSMAN and DONIE VANITZIAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Question: We are a small complex of only nine homes with no
amenities, elevators, saunas, pools or hot tubs. The board has
reacted to the threat of lawsuits by hiring a management company,
telling homeowners that we are safer with a management company
because it acts as a "shield" for the association.</LD>
<LD>   The board said that the management company will save us money
because if we are sued, the management company shares in the
liability.</LD>
<LD>   The homeowners believe the board, but I have seen the management
company contract. It has a condition that says our association agrees
to indemnify the company and all of its employees of "all" wrongdoing
and liability.</LD>
<TE>   What does this mean, and are we shielded because we hired a
management company?</TE>
<TE>   Answer: If your homeowners association, or HOA, is sued, the
management company will likely claim that it is only the "agent" and
therefore not responsible. When it comes to paying for your board's
defense or paying out on a judgment, it will likely be the
association's insurance company, not the management company, that
pays. Should the amount of the judgment exceed the amount of your
insurance coverage, every homeowner will have to contribute to make
up the total of the judgment.</TE>
<TE>   Management companies and attorneys who work closely with them, or
with HOA boards, make their living from your dependence.</TE>
<TE>   The longer you are dependent, the more they get paid.</TE>
<TE>   Boards should spend more time responding to homeowner complaints,
replacing burned out light bulbs, fixing concrete and correcting
other conditions affecting the condition of a complex or presenting
the real risk of liability for all homeowners rather than worrying
about possible lawsuits.</TE>
<TE>   By indemnifying the management company, your board has added a
layer of potential expense each homeowner may ultimately have to pay.
The indemnification flows in one direction, toward the management
company.</TE>
<TE>   The contract guarantees that if the management company does
anything wrong, and the HOA is sued because of that wrong, the HOA
pays any damages awarded and the management company pays nothing.</TE>
<TE>   Imagine having the capability to act in any way you want and not
worry about being sued. That is what indemnification means.</TE>
<TE>   You don't know who the management company's employees are, what
their qualifications are or what they will do, yet you are agreeing
to pay for their mistakes--even if they steal from you. They can
slander and libel your homeowners, and if they are sued, you pay.</TE>
<TE>   A management company does nothing to make your HOA safer with
regard to lawsuits and in fact may make it worse. But often these
firms convince those signing the contract that the one big advantage
they can offer is to "keep the HOA abreast of all the laws and ensure
that you remain in compliance."</TE>
<TE>   If they hire attorneys to provide that information, they charge
the association for a service the volunteers on the board could
provide: finding and hiring an attorney to give them the same advice.</TE>
<TE>   Some companies have computer programs or specialists they want you
to pay for to ensure you are in "compliance" with changes in the
Davis-Stirling Act.</TE>
<TE>   If someone tells you to be afraid but for a fee will protect you
from that fear, get a second opinion. Tell them you want all the
homeowners to vote on it, but do not sign the contract.</TE>
<TE>   If your HOA has ever functioned without a management company and
only hired an attorney when it had a specific project requiring legal
help, then your association does not need to change its operating
procedures now.</TE>
<TE>   Allaying your fears is why you have insurance, and a board that
uses sound judgment and common sense can function without a
management company.</TE>

<LD>The Los Angeles County Community Development Commission is requesting
proposals for a City of Industry Funds program allocation of more
than $10 million, which will help fund multifamily, senior,
affordable and special needs housing developments.</LD>
<LD>   The Industry Funds program is the county's largest funding source
for new, affordable housing. It originates from tax revenue generated
from Industry's redevelopment areas and can be used within a 15-mile
radius of the City of Industry.</LD>
<LD>   Five previous funding rounds have allocated $85 million in
Industry Funds, which will add 4,200 units to the county's affordable
housing stock. The program is scheduled to extend through 2017.</LD>
<TE>   The request for proposals is posted on the Web at www.lacdc. org.</TE>

<LD>This steel, slate and glass residence stands out among the

Palos Verdes Estates.</LD>
<LD>   The house, built for the sellers in 1998, is futuristic in style
with a curved balcony running the length of its upper level.</LD>
<LD>   In the kitchen, a granite counter reflects the same graceful
curves in the industrial steel beams and glass walls.</LD>
<TE>   A piece of contemporary art itself, the home has a gallery-like
entrance highlighted by slate walls and light maple floors.</TE>
<TE>   It also has unobstructed ocean, coastline and mountain views.</TE>
<TE>   About this house: It was designed by James Tyler, who worked on
plans for the original building of the Art Center College of Design
in Pasadena and designed a large wing added later. This light and
airy house is wired with a programmable lighting system, but its open
floor plan is infused with natural light, some of it coming from a
central skylight.</TE>
<TE>   Asking price: $4.2 million</TE>
<TE>   Size: The home has three bedrooms in 5,735 square feet on a
27,000-square-foot lot. The upper level has two master bedrooms, each
with a walk-in closet and bathroom, divided by an office with space
that can be reconfigured to provide two additional bedrooms. The
third bedroom is on the lower level.</TE>
<TE>   Features: The gated home has a living room with a Douglas fir
ceiling and white maple floor, an upstairs family room, a security
system and a three-car garage. The property has a large, grassy area,
two patios and room for a pool.</TE>

<HD>Starting From Scratch in Venice</HD>

<AU>RUTH RYON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Frank Gehry, architect of the rising Walt Disney Concert Hall in
downtown Los Angeles and the Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao, Spain, has
purchased a half-acre home site in Venice for $1.6 million.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm 73 years old, and I always wanted to build a house from
scratch," Gehry said.</LD>
<LD>   He and his family have been living in Santa Monica since 1978,
when he redesigned his current residence, a former Dutch Colonial now
clad in such signature Gehry materials as corrugated metal, plywood
and chain-link fence.</LD>
<TE>   "We're going to have to do something with the Santa Monica house
when we move," he said. The National Trust for Historic Preservation
has expressed an interest in owning it, he added.</TE>
<TE>   In the '70s, Gehry wanted to live in Santa Monica to be near his
work. Now that he's moving his offices just north of Jefferson
Boulevard near Centinela Avenue, he wants to live in Venice.</TE>
<TE>   He will also be closer to his sailboat, which he keeps in Marina
del Rey.</TE>
<TE>   For Gehry, Venice is a return to what might be called his roots,
because he had offices there before he opened some in Santa Monica.</TE>
<TE>   His home site, vacant for 35 years, was once the location of one
of the original houses in Venice. Gehry envisions building "a fairly
modest home with a large garden."</TE>
<TE>   Gehry's house plans are "conceptual at this point," said his
Realtor, Jack V. Hoffmann, but the architect will have more room,
especially outside, to entertain friends and dignitaries.</TE>
<TE>   "We just closed escrow, so I'm having a survey made and looking at
the views from a cherrypicker," Gehry said. "I'm doing what I do for
a client. I'm starting to understand the neighborhood."</TE>
<TE>   Hoffmann, broker-owner of Venice Properties, represented Gehry in
his purchase and co-listed the residential site with Dannie Cavenaugh
of Century 21 in Culver City.</TE>
<TE>   Sky Dayton, founder of Internet-service provider Earthlink, has
sold his Santa Monica home for $13.5 million, according to Westside
brokers.</TE>
<TE>   Dayton, also founder and chief executive officer of the high-speed
Internet service Boingo Wireless, purchased the eight-bedroom,
14,000-square-foot-plus home from computer software magnate Peter
Norton last fall for about $12 million. The asking price this year
was just under $15 million.</TE>
<TE>   Dayton, 31, has been looking at scaling down to a house in the
$8-million range, Realtors said. He bought a Malibu home for about
$5.9 million in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Built in 1989, the Santa Monica home is on 1.2 acres overlooking a
golf course. The Mediterranean-style home also has a two-bedroom
guest house, a game room, gym, tennis court and pool.</TE>
<TE>   The longtime Bel-Air home of the late Wilt Chamberlain has been
sold in the high $2-million range.</TE>
<TE>   Marketed in 2000 at $7.45 million, the former basketball great's
six-bedroom, 7,200-square-foot, wood-and-glass contemporary was
reduced in 2001 to about $4.4 million.</TE>
<TE>   The buyers, described as "a pair of young, talented television
writers" who want to remain anonymous, plan to refurbish the house,
maintaining its architectural integrity.</TE>
<TE>   Dave T. Rich designed the home in the shape of an equilateral
triangle. Paul Lubowicki and Sue Lainier will do the restoration.</TE>
<TE>   "It took ... adventurous buyers to see beyond the flashy
reputation of the former owner and his lifestyle," said the buyers'
agent, Jo Wilder of Coldwell Banker, Beverly Hills North.</TE>
<TE>   While living in the home from the time it was built in 1971 until
he died in 1999, the legendary Lakers center was also known as a
ladies' man. In his bedroom, there is a mirrored ceiling that
retracts to reveal the sky, and a large triangular tub at the foot of
the bed with 18-karat gold tile.</TE>
<TE>   The house, on 2.5 acres of a peak with city-to-ocean views, also
has a moat/swimming pool that leads into the living room, and a front
door 14 feet high and 5 feet thick.</TE>
<TE>   Stephen Dorff, who co-starred as Mike Reilly in the horror movie
"feardotcom" and had the title role in the comedy film "Cecil B.
DeMented" (2000), has purchased a Malibu home listed at just under $3
million.</TE>
<TE>   The actor, 29, bought a three-bedroom, 2,300-square-foot house on
the beach with walls of glass and high ceilings.</TE>
<TE>   Built in the '60s, the house was recently remodeled and has an
ocean-view deck off the master suite.</TE>
<TE>   Dorff, who plays the villain in the upcoming movie "The Devil's
Throat," played a villain in the martial arts action film "Blade"
(1998), and he starred as a boxing South African schoolboy in the
movie "The Power of One" (1992).</TE>
<TE>   Steve Hilton, a grandson of the late hotel scion Conrad Hilton,
and his pianist-composer wife, Lisa, have listed their Malibu home at
nearly $3.1 million. The couple plans to move in the area.</TE>
<TE>   They built the house in 1991. It has five bedrooms and 5.5
bathrooms in 6,300 square feet. On a nearly 4-acre knoll top, the
house has panoramic canyon and ocean views. The property is adjacent
to hiking and riding trails.</TE>
<TE>   Among its other features are a sauna, office, game room, gym,
deck, orchard and vegetable garden.</TE>
<TE>   The grounds are landscaped with native California plants, and the
home is heated by solar panels on the roof and radiant floor heating,
partly warmed by the solar panels. Rainwater is kept in an
underground tank for irrigation, and there is a system for collecting
water from the showers and sinks, also for irrigation use.</TE>

<LD>Regarding "Cutting Costs or Corners?" by Jeff Bertolucci, Sept. 29: I
used a "discount brokerage" to sell my single-family home, and have
no regrets. Now I am preparing to sell my condo, and there is no way
I would utilize a "full service" (that moniker is misleading) broker
to do what a discount broker can do for less than half the price.</LD>
<LD>   In today's market, there is no "selling," as the properties sell
themselves. Agents/brokers are simply "clerks" at a checkout stand.
The biggest threat to the discount brokers are the "full service"
brokers who will do anything to protect the standard 6%, which in
today's market, is exorbitant.</LD>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   At any major art auction the fees range from 10% on up. A lawyer
handling a contingency fee case charges 33% (plus expenses). In real
estate, it is accepted practice to negotiate lower commissions before
any work has been done.</TE>
<TE>   An agent who has pounded the pavement for six months with buyers
is not rewarded for failing to find the right house. And if he/she
manages to find the right house and negotiate a sales contract, will
receive a maximum of 3% of the sales price. That's hardly "too much"
for six months' work.</TE>
<TE>   As for the listing agent making 2.5% or 3% commission, the agent
often had to "work" the listing for months before the owners would
agree to list the property.</TE>
<TE>   And even if the property sells within 24 hours, the real work
begins once escrow is opened. Ask any agent. Furthermore, not all
listings sell. And certainly most "buyers" never wind up buying
anything, often leaving a corps of disappointed (and non-paid) agents
in their wake.</TE>

<LD>If the scenic patch of bluff at the far end of San Pedro's Point
Fermin had been stable, the vacant and vandalized 1914 Craftsman
cottage that Bill Roberts and his partners renovated a few years ago
might have ended up as wood chips on the bottom of some landfill,
making way for new construction.</LD>
<LD>   "Everyone else who was making bids on it was going to tear it
down," said Roberts, 86, a retired general contractor.</LD>
<LD>   Roberts bought the 1,280-square-foot two-bedroom house for
$340,000 in the mid-1990s--along with his wife, Nan, 70, and two
partners, Jackie Law, 79, and her son Jeff Law, 50--and subsequently
worked on and supervised the one-year, $58,000 renovation.</LD>
<TE>   The 8,000-square-foot parcel has what Nan Roberts calls "a
million-dollar view," overlooking breaking waves, windsurfers and the
Port of Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   But the geologically unstable lot will not hold a large, heavy
house without prohibitively expensive shoring up and the approval of
the California Coastal Commission. "The bluff is so iffy," Bill
Roberts said.</TE>
<TE>   Certainly, if the bluff were granite, "the house would have been
bulldozed," said Gordon Teuber, the San Pedro Realtor who brought the
partners together, whom he knew to be fans of old homes.</TE>
<TE>   The Laws have bought and fixed up San Pedro properties for
decades. "The more of a junker it is, the better she likes it," Jeff
Law said of his mother.</TE>
<TE>   The Roberts, relative newcomers of 15 years in this close-knit
community, are known for their efforts to revamp the 1899 Muller
House Museum and for helping to bring about a multimillion-dollar
restoration of the 1932 Cabrillo Beach Bath House. "You don't ever
tear down anything old," Nan Roberts said. "You restore it."</TE>
<TE>   Nan Roberts is past president of the San Pedro Bay Historical
Society. Before moving to San Pedro, Bill Roberts was president of
the San Fernando Valley Historic Society, and he is a member of the
Twentynine Palms Historical Society.</TE>
<TE>   Their goal was to return the house to its original simple grace.
It had been built in 1914 during a vibrant period--the Port of Los
Angeles had been founded in 1907 and the Panama Canal was just
opening, bringing more ships to the port. Oil was discovered nearby
that same year, and World War I began.</TE>
<TE>   Renovating the bluff house proved daunting. A former owner had
chopped it into a duplex, with a bathroom cobbled into the hallway
off the living room. Part of the exterior was covered with 1
1/2-inch-thick pink plaster, and many of the old double-hung windows
had been replaced with aluminum ones.</TE>
<TE>   One of the first tasks was clearing trash. "It was a junkyard,"
said Jeff Law, a sailor and shipwright who worked on the project as
the main laborer under Bill Roberts' direction. The team hauled off
an old camper that may have served as a guesthouse, chain-link
fencing, rebar, water pipes and other wreckage of the past.</TE>
<TE>   Bill Roberts said the former owner was a packrat, but that also
was beneficial as some of the materials needed to reconstruct the
original details, including moldings, were found in the piles and set
aside.</TE>
<TE>   Jeff Law and a helper chipped the plaster off the house and
garage. It took six weeks of prying and pounding, bracing a
two-by-four against the studs to get a solid base for the pry bar.
The effort uncovered the original 1-by-6-inch beveled redwood siding.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't know it was there," Nan Roberts said. "That was a nice
surprise." One of her jobs was to fill in the holes to get the boards
ready to paint.</TE>
<TE>   After the plaster was gone, the sills, which had been sheared off,
were replaced to replicate the original design, and the aluminum
windows were replaced with wooden double-hung models.</TE>
<TE>   The single-car garage had termites, a dirt floor and no
foundation. With the heavy plaster gone, the garage was jacked up and
a concrete foundation and floor poured under it.</TE>
<TE>   Inside, the house had signs of age, use, misuse and neglect, but
still had a leaded-glass window, wainscoting, coffered ceilings,
original hardware, push-button light switches and even a few original
light fixtures, which were rewired.</TE>
<TE>   Restoration was helped by the relatively good condition of the
3/4-inch-thick wood floors made of maple and close-grain Douglas fir.
"It's beautiful stuff," Bill Roberts said.</TE>
<TE>   Big expenses for the interior included gutting and replacing the
kitchen and bathrooms, reworking access to the added bathroom so it
opens to a hall instead of the living room, new copper plumbing,
enlarged electrical service and a forced air furnace.</TE>
<TE>   A wall of French doors was added in the dining room to replace an
aluminum slider, and a set of brick stairs replaced rickety wooden
ones. The front door was replaced by a thick wooden door Bill Roberts
had saved from a remodel he did at least 25 years ago.</TE>
<TE>   There were a few differences of opinion. Nan Roberts and Jackie
Law wanted to see another slider replaced by French doors, but Bill
Roberts insisted that would put them over budget. Jeff Law would have
liked the kitchen and bathroom cabinets to be fancier, but Bill
Roberts wanted them plain, to match the style of the era.</TE>
<TE>   The project was completed with full permits. It attracted the
attention of the neighbors, and several stopped by to ask Bill
Roberts for construction advice. The final touches were paint inside
and out and new landscaping.</TE>
<TE>   During the year of labor, Bill and Nan Roberts, along with Jeff
Law, were on the site almost every day, with Jackie Law pitching in
for painting. They enjoyed watching migrating whales from the covered
porch, and Nan planted a vegetable garden on the cleared lot.</TE>
<TE>   Jackie Law considered living in the house but decided to stay at
her own view home. The Roberts said they were tempted to live there
too but are pretty well settled into their own home nearby. And Jeff
Law said he couldn't afford to live in the house.</TE>
<TE>   In the end, it became a $2,200-a-month rental, now used as a
part-time office/studio by music producer Leo Rossi and his company,
Highway One Management. His idea was to bring musicians there to work
out lyrics and rearrange music away from Los Angeles' corporate
environment.</TE>
<TE>   "It's an inspirational place, especially when there's a full
moon," said Rossi, a San Pedro native who has dubbed the house "The
Point." Members of established and emerging bands, such as Dishwalla
from Santa Barbara, bring sleeping bags to use on the twin beds.</TE>
<TE>   Rossi assured the Robertses that his musicians would use acoustic
instruments only and not disturb the neighbors. "I promised that I
would keep it cool and keep it clean."</TE>
<TE>   Once the house was returned to its original charm, it was
discovered by television and movie location scouts, who have paid
$2,000 a day to use it as a set. There have been seven shoots there
in the last few years, including two "JAG" television shows and a
Hallmark Hall of Fame movie called "Follow the Stars Home."</TE>
<TE>   Nan Roberts remembers the project as "quite an adventure," while
Bill Roberts said: "It was a fun thing more than anything."</TE>
<TE>   With age taking its toll, Bill Roberts said he probably won't be
taking on any more large restoration jobs, but he remains happy about
his accomplishments. "I'm glad I was able to do what I was able to do
when I was able to do it."</TE>

<LD>Question: I had to give one of my tenants a three-day notice to pay
rent. She paid the rent on time but asked if the notice to move would
appear on her credit report. Being a fairly new resident manager, I
didn't know the answer to her question. Do you?</LD>
<LD>   Answer: A 3-Day Notice to Pay Rent or Quit is a standard rental
form used by landlords or their agents to notify tenants that their
rent is past due. These notices, along with 30-day notices to move,
do not appear on credit reports and therefore do not affect a
tenant's credit as long as the tenant fulfills the condition of the
notice, i.e. pays the rent or moves within the required period of
time.</LD>
<LD>   The only time a tenant's credit is affected is when a tenant does
not fulfill the conditions of a notice and successful legal action is
completed through the court system. However, in some very unusual
cases, all the parties to the legal action can agree to suppress the
results of any legal action, but the suppression is not guaranteed.
Any money judgment as well as an eviction record can remain on a
credit report for up to 10 years and could impact a prospective
tenant's chances of being accepted for a future tenancy.</LD>
<TE>   In some instances, even legal action that has been dismissed can
appear on a tenancy report that can be ordered from certain housing
and rental agencies. The best approach is to attempt to resolve all
housing matters and to avoid any type of legal action.</TE>
<TE>   Tenant Contends Repair Staff Must Be On-Site</TE>
<TE>   Q: I manage an 18-unit apartment complex that does not have an
on-site repair staff. All the tenants have my phone number to report
repairs, but a new tenant says it is illegal not to have a separate
on-site maintenance person available for repairs and emergencies. Is
this true?</TE>
<TE>   A: There is no legal requirement for a rental complex to provide
on-site maintenance personnel. The only legal requirement for on-site
staff comes from California Code of Regulations, Title 25, 42, which
requires rental complexes with 16 or more units to have a manager
reside on the property.</TE>
<TE>   Obviously it is impossible for you to be available 24 hours a day,
seven days a week, therefore you need to provide the tenants with a
specific reporting procedure as well as an emergency contact number.
The tenants should know exactly what to do at 2 a.m. on a Sunday
morning if the bathroom plumbing backs up. Perhaps you could give
them the telephone number of the plumbing and electrical services you
use for exactly these times.</TE>
<TE>   Understandably, there need to be specific guidelines as to when
they would call these services directly or when they would go through
you.</TE>
<TE>   Landlord Wants Access for Twice-Yearly Inspections</TE>
<TE>   Q: My new landlord sent me a notice that she will be doing a
general inspection of my apartment every six months. I have no
problem giving her unlimited access for repairs, but I think every
six months is too often. As long as she gives me a proper notice in
advance, I would agree to a yearly schedule. I feel her request is
unreasonable. Can she evict me if I don't agree to every six months?
I have a month-to-month rental agreement.</TE>
<TE>   A: There are several California civil codes that could protect you
from a 30-day notice of termination of tenancy. Civil Code 1954
limits a landlord's access to rental property except in the case of
an emergency, to make necessary or agreed upon repairs, when a tenant
has abandoned the property, or pursuant to a court order. This code
does not include "inspections."</TE>
<TE>   Even though your landlord has requested "every six months," Civil
Code 1953(a)(1) states that a tenant cannot give up or waive rights
given to them by Civil Code 1954 (as defined above). Additionally,
Civil Code 1942.5(c) states that it shall be unlawful for a landlord
to increase rent, decrease services, cause a tenant to move
involuntarily, take legal action to recover possession of the
property, or threaten to do any of such acts, for the purpose of
retaliating against the tenant because he or she has lawfully
exercised one of the rights listed above.</TE>
<TE>   The fact that you are comfortable with allowing her unlimited
access for repairs is a positive approach on your part. Convey this
position to her as well as discuss why she feels every six months is
necessary. For more assistance, contact your local housing mediation
program, which can help you both to negotiate a mutually acceptable
schedule.</TE>

<HD>Portugal May Have Put America on the Map</HD>
<DH>Geography: A self-styled historian says a 1507 print of the
South American coasts suggests that someone beat Magellan to the
punch.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>THOMAS H. MAUGH II</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A fresh look at the ancient Waldseemueller Map, commonly called the
baptismal certificate of America, is offering tantalizing clues that
it was Portuguese navigators, and not the Spanish, who first explored
the west coast of South America--a finding that could recast the
early history of New World exploration.</LD>
<LD>   The 1507 Waldseemueller Map--the first document that gave the name
America to the New World--has such an accurate depiction of the
coasts of South America that it could only have been based on
firsthand knowledge of the continent, according to amateur historian
Peter W. Dickson, a retired CIA analyst who will present his
conclusions Thursday in a lecture at the Library of Congress.</LD>
<LD>   A close reading of the map suggests that some as-yet-unknown
explorer sailed through the South American straits later named after
Magellan and traveled north as far as Acapulco no later than 1506,
and perhaps several years earlier, Dickson said. In either case, the
date is well before Magellan's discovery of the Pacific Ocean and
circumnavigation of the world in a voyage sponsored by Spain that
began in 1519.</LD>
<TE>   The Portuguese kept the discovery secret because of their intense
trade rivalry with the Spanish, who had claimed the New World as
their own sphere of influence, he added.</TE>
<TE>   Dickson's proposal, which will be published in a forthcoming issue
of the cartography journal Exploring Mercator's World, has not yet
been widely circulated, and those who are familiar with it have mixed
feelings.</TE>
<TE>   "I think there is merit here," said cartographer John Hebert of
the Library of Congress, which is in the process of purchasing the
Waldseemueller Map for $10 million. "Until proven otherwise, his
observations are correct. There is some exciting stuff on that map
that really needs additional study. It shows what happens when a
scholar looks at something with fresh eyes and begins asking the
right questions."</TE>
<TE>   Independent cartographer and map dealer Kenneth Nebenzahl embraced
the idea less quickly. "My first reaction to something like this
always is, here comes another quack," he said. "Then I stared at that
map again, and I said 'This guy is not completely crazy.' Later, I
said to myself, 'Why didn't I notice that?' "</TE>
<TE>   Geographer David Woodward of the University of Wisconsin's Madison
campus is still skeptical. "I would take issue with" Dickson's
conclusions, he said. "I think it [the map's resemblance to the known
coastline] is simply a coincidence ... I would like to see some more
solid, archival evidence to back that up."</TE>
<TE>   On that point, at least, everyone is in agreement, including
Dickson. The Spanish and Portuguese archives have already been mined
pretty thoroughly, all agreed, but now that scholars have something
specific to look for, they might find some previously overlooked
nugget of information that will shed more light on the map.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the ultimate human artifact," Dickson said. Not only is
the map the first to bear the name of America, but it is also the
first to show the New World as separate continents distinct from Asia
and the first to show the presence of a major ocean separating the
New World from Asia.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know of another artifact that has that much information
packed into it," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The Waldseemueller Map is a massive work, a woodcut print on paper
in 12 sections that together measure 8 feet by 4.5 feet. Before it
was produced at a Catholic monastery in Saint Die in the Lorraine
province of France, maps showed a world composed only of Europe,
Africa and Asia, with the New World drawn only as vague appendages to
Asia.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the map, cartographer Martin Waldseemueller
produced a 103-page book, "Cosmographiae Introductio," which noted
that the Italian navigator Amerigo Vespucci had recently discovered
"a fourth part" of the world. "Since Europa and Asia have received
names of women, I see no reason why we should not call this other
part 'Amerige,' that is to say, the land of Americus, or America,
after the sagacious discoverer [Amerigo]."</TE>
<TE>   The name was applied only to the southern continent, with the
north left unlabeled.</TE>
<TE>   Hidden away for centuries in the family castle of Prince Johannes
Waldburg-Wolfegg in southern Germany, the map resurfaced in 1901.
Five hundred copies were made at the time, with one going to the
Library of Congress. The library has been trying on and off to
purchase the original, and last year struck a deal with the prince's
heirs to buy the map for $10 million.</TE>
<TE>   The library is still $3.5 million short of its fund-raising goal
for the map, Hebert said. The authenticity of the Waldseemueller Map
has never been seriously questioned.</TE>
<TE>   Dickson spent 20 years as a political and military analyst for the
CIA and the State Department and frequently lectures on foreign
affairs topics at the Foreign Service Institute in Washington. For
the last 10 years, he has devoted his free time to studying
Christopher Columbus and the political impact of the voyages to the
New World.</TE>
<TE>   Last January, he began preparing a bibliography of everything that
has been written about the map for the Library of Congress,
researching materials that included a small globe produced at Saint
Die at the same time as the Waldseemueller Map.</TE>
<TE>   That globe, he said, indicated a passage to the Pacific through
what is now the Straits of Magellan. When he measured the latitudinal
distance of the passage from the equator, "it was virtually spot on,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   Reexamining the map itself, he noted an abrupt northwestern shift
in the South American coastline at about 15 degrees south in the
small map inset in the Waldseemueller Map and at about 18 to 19
degrees south in the larger map, roughly where Chile and Peru meet.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no way somebody could draw something like that without
firsthand knowledge," he said.</TE>
<TE>   He then measured the longitudinal width of South America at
various latitudes on the map and confirmed that this, too, correlated
well with modern knowledge.</TE>
<TE>   "I concluded that, on this clandestine expedition, they must have
reached Acapulco," he said. "Clearly they stopped there, because
mapmakers drew a straight line from there to the North Pole"--meaning
that they didn't know what the rest of the coastline looked like.</TE>
<TE>   Why did the explorers keep it a secret? Because Spain and Portugal
were the two main maritime powers of the period, with each trying to
find a profitable route to Asia to ship back spices and other goods.
"A pound of pepper at the time was worth a pound of gold," Hebert
said.</TE>
<TE>   Portugal had already established a route to Asia around the tip of
Africa, while Spain had attempted to reach it by sailing west, only
to be blocked by the unbroken coastline of the New World. By
conducting an expedition to the western coast of the Americas,
Portugal would have been encroaching on a region it had tacitly ceded
to Spain.</TE>
<TE>   New geographical knowledge, furthermore, was closely guarded. The
Spanish, for example, had a large map called the Padron Royale or
Royal Map, in Seville that was updated as soon as each expedition
returned. "It was a capital offense to disseminate information from
that map," cartographer Nebenzahl said. The Portuguese had a similar
map.</TE>
<TE>   When Waldseemueller drew his map, he clearly wanted to depict all
that was known about the world at the time, but he had to be careful
to avoid spilling trade secrets. "The mapmakers had sensitive
information that had to be kept from the Spanish, and they were
devilishly clever in how they handled it," Dickson concluded. Only
500 years later has the true extent of their knowledge become
apparent.</TE>

<CX>   Waldseemueller Map--A story in Section A on Sunday about the 1507
Waldseemueller Map incorrectly ascribed the Europeans' discovery of
the Pacific Ocean to Ferdinand Magellan. Magellan was the first to
sail into the Pacific through the Straits of Magellan, although Vasco
Nunez de Balboa was the first European to sight the ocean. The story
also misspelled the name of Spain's royal map. The correct spelling
is Padron Real.</CX>

ankle as he limped off the field after USC's 30-27 loss to Washington
State on Saturday. You could feel it in every slow step defensive end
Kenechi Udeze took on the Trojans' long trek back to the locker room.
It felt as if they had to walk halfway across Washington State's
campus as they went out of Martin Stadium, around the athletics
building and into the old gym that housed their locker room.</LD>
<LD>   "It was a very difficult ballgame," USC Coach Pete Carroll said.</LD>
<TE>   They usually are when you can't run the ball effectively and your
defense can't stop the other team. The Trojans were so deficient in
those two essential areas that it felt as if they had missed out on a
chance for a big upset, not as if they were a mighty power that
toppled.</TE>
<TE>   USC's rushing efforts totaled 72 yards, or 2.2 per carry. The same
defense that shut down Oregon State last week allowed 516 yards to
Washington State, prompting Carroll to call his defensive scheming
"lousy."</TE>
<TE>   The only championship quality USC demonstrated throughout the game
was heart. It showed in the first quarter when quarterback Carson
Palmer avoided a sack, buying enough time to get the ball to Kareem
Kelly, who absorbed a hit and stayed on his feet long enough to draw
a facemask penalty that enabled the Trojans to keep their first
touchdown drive alive.</TE>
<TE>   It showed when Polamalu returned to the game late in the third
quarter after a sprained ankle sent him to the sideline in the first
half. ("I felt like I needed to do anything I could to help the team
out," he said.)</TE>
<TE>   And it showed when the Trojans scored two touchdowns in less than
four minutes to turn a 24-14 deficit into a 27-24 lead.</TE>
<TE>   They lived up to the corny slogan hauled out at every booster
luncheon: "Fight On."</TE>
<TE>   But they didn't fulfill the mantra constantly repeated by Carroll.</TE>
<TE>   "The key word is 'finish,' " free safety DeShaun Hill said.</TE>
<TE>   The defense couldn't do it, as USC's two second-half leads lasted
a total of 2 minutes 55 seconds.</TE>
<TE>   Kicker Ryan Killeen couldn't do it. After USC stunned Washington
State's homecoming crowd with a 55-yard touchdown pass from Palmer to
Mike Williams, Killeen missed an extra point that could have put the
Trojans ahead by four and forced the Cougars to go all the way to the
end zone.</TE>
<TE>   A field goal was no challenge at all for a Washington State
offense that gained more than 100 yards in every quarter. The Cougars
moved 62 yards in six plays and booted the game-tying kick with 1:50
left.</TE>
<TE>   And they had to do even less work in overtime after a sack and a
five-yard loss led to a missed 52-yarder by Killeen. A couple of
simple runs set up the game-winning 35-yard kick by Drew Dunning.</TE>
<TE>   That left the Trojans to ponder everything they did wrong,
including two trips inside the Washington State 15-yard line that
produced no points, thanks to an interception and a missed field
goal. And 10 penalties worth a costly 103 yards.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a long way back to L.A.," Williams said. "Everybody's going
to sit around and think about it."</TE>
<TE>   At some point they need to think long and hard about establishing
a running game. That was supposed to be a strength of this year's
team, but it isn't happening.</TE>
<TE>   The only time the Trojans have rushed for more than 100 net yards
was against Colorado (181). Quarterback sacks count against the
team's rushing yardage, but the only time that was a significant
factor was when Kansas State sacked Palmer three times for 31 yards.
Remove the 23 yards Palmer lost in sacks Saturday night and the
Trojans still didn't crack 100 against Washington State.</TE>
<TE>   Palmer put up big numbers Saturday. He threw the ball 50 times,
with 32 completions for 381 yards and two touchdowns.</TE>
<TE>   But he isn't ready to win games by himself, and that's basically
what the team asked him to do by throwing so much and not dedicating
itself to the run. Palmer made two great scoring plays: his long pass
to Williams and a three-yard run to the end zone when he couldn't
find someone open.</TE>
<TE>   He also committed two big mistakes, throwing an interception in
the end zone when the Trojans were at the Cougar nine, and taking a
sack on the second play of overtime.</TE>
<TE>   It's also obvious that the defense isn't going to win games for
the Trojans week in and week out.</TE>
<TE>   Washington State didn't try to challenge the Trojans head-on; the
Cougars ran a lot of screens and reverses to keep USC off-balance.
Not every team can execute that plan as well as quarterback Jason
Gesser and the Cougars, but they can try.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, the Trojans don't have a chance to play at their peak
without Polamalu.</TE>
<TE>   "Troy's a senior, he's the captain of the team, he gets us riled
up when we need to," Hill said. "We definitely notice when Troy's not
out there."</TE>
<TE>   It was never more obvious than when Washington State's Jermaine
Green took off for a 75-yard run on the Cougars' first play of the
second half. It's hard to imagine a running play lasting 16 seconds
and covering three-fourths of the field without Polamalu finding his
way to the ball at some point. Doesn't he always work into the thick
of things?</TE>
<TE>   There will be other times this season that a leader will go down
and the Trojans will have to continue without him. They showed on
Saturday that they're capable of battling through adversity.</TE>
<TE>   They also learned that trait alone isn't enough.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>FIRST INNING</LD>
<LD>   YANKEES: Angels 0, Yankees 0--Oh goody, Tim McCarver is back. We
won't be able to tell how loud the crowd is over his droning. Alfonso
Soriano struck out swinging. Derek Jeter singled to right. Jason
Giambi was hit by a pitch. Bernie Williams grounded into a 4-3 double
play. No runs, one hit, one left.</LD>
<LD>   ANGELS: Angels 0, Yankees 0--David Eckstein singled to left. Darin
Erstad grounded into a 3-6 double play. Tim Salmon flied to right. No
runs, no hits.</LD>
<TE>   SECOND INNING</TE>
<TE>   YANKEES: Yankees 1, Angels 0--Jorge Posada singled to right. Raul
Mondesi flied to center. Ron Coomer, who was a hot prospect with the
Dodgers in 1950, singled to shallow left, Posada taking third. Robin
Ventura doubled off the wall in right-center, Posada scoring, Coomer
stopping at third. Juan Rivera grounded to third. Soriano flied to
right. One run, three hits, two left.</TE>
<TE>   ANGELS: Yankees 1, Angels 0--Garret Anderson grounded to second.
Troy Glaus flied to center. They showed Reggie Jackson, and Reggie
acknowledged the camera. That's a surprise, because Reggie usually
shuns the spotlight. Scott Spiezio flied to right. No runs, no hits.</TE>
<TE>   THIRD INNING</TE>
<TE>   YANKEES: Yankees 1, Angels 0--Jeter grounded to third. Giambi
struck out swinging. Williams singled to center. Posada grounded to
third. No runs, one hit, one left.</TE>
<TE>   ANGELS: Angels 1, Yankees 1--Shawn Wooten singled to center.
Bengie Molina sacrificed. Benji Gil singled to left, Wooten stopping
at third. Eckstein grounded to second, but the ball went through
Soriano's legs, Wooten scoring, Gil to third. David Wells shook his
head and was upset after the play. The Yankees sure get annoyed at
their teammates easily. That "team of class" stuff is not true.
Erstad grounded into a 4-6-3 double play. One run, two hits, one
left.</TE>
<TE>   FOURTH INNING</TE>
<TE>   YANKEES: Angels 1, Yankees 1--Jack Nicholson is in the crowd. When
does he ever find time to make movies? Wonder if he was one of the
fans who camped out the night before playoff tickets went on sale.
Probably not. Mondesi walked. Coomer fouled out to right. Ventura
grounded into a 3-6-3 double play. No runs, no hits.</TE>
<TE>   ANGELS: Angels 1, Yankees 1--Salmon hit a grounder to the left of
the pitcher's mound and Wells threw the ball away, Salmon taking
second. Soriano should come over and shake his head at Wells now.
Anderson flied to center. Glaus grounded to third. Spiezio flied to
center. No runs, no hits, one left.</TE>
<TE>   FIFTH INNING</TE>
<TE>   YANKEES: Yankees 2, Angels 1--Rivera grounded to third, Glaus'
throw was too high, pulling Spiezio off the bag, so Rivera was safe.
Soriano doubled to left. Jeter flied to left, Rivera scoring. Good
thing Anderson is left-handed. A right-handed left fielder would not
have made the catch. Giambi flied to left. Williams lined to third.
One run, two hits, one error, one left.</TE>
<TE>   ANGELS: Angels 9, Yankees 2--Time for another of those lame Fox
Instapolls. Here's one for you: How many think the Instapoll is a
waste of time and get annoyed that the dumb thing takes up half the
screen while the game is going on? Wooten got a fat pitch to hit and
homered to left. McCarver pointed out how many solo homers Wooten has
hit. It's really, really hard to hit a two-run homer when you lead
off the inning, Tim. Molina flied to right. Gil singled up the
middle. Eckstein grounded a hit-and-run single to right, Gil to
third. It's about 150 degrees in Edison Field, and some guy in the
stands has his 5-year-old dressed in a monkey suit. Nice parenting
skills. Erstad hit a ball that fell behind Soriano into center, Gil
scoring, Eckstein to second. Soriano better hope all the league MVP
votes were in before this series started. Salmon singled to left,
Eckstein scoring, Erstad to third. Anderson singled to right, Erstad
scoring, Salmon to third. Glaus flied to right. Spiezio singled to
left, Salmon scoring, Anderson to second. Ramiro Mendoza pitching.
Wooten singled to center, Anderson scoring, Spiezio to second. Molina
doubled to left, Spiezio and Wooten scoring. Wow, the Angels are
taking the Yankees to school. Orlando Hernandez pitching. Gil singled
to center, Molina to third. Eckstein flied to center. Eight runs, 10
hits, two left.</TE>
<TE>   SIXTH INNING</TE>
<TE>   YANKEES: Angels 9, Yankees 3--Brendan Donnelly pitching. Posada
homered to center. Mondesi flied to center. Nick Johnson hit for
Coomer and struck out swinging. Ventura walked. Rivera bounced to
third. One run, one hit, one left.</TE>
<TE>   ANGELS: Angels 9, Yankees 3--Erstad flied to center. Salmon struck
out swinging. Anderson struck out swinging. No runs, no hits.</TE>
<TE>   SEVENTH INNING</TE>
<TE>   YANKEES: Angels 9, Yankees 4--Soriano popped to second. Jeter
singled to left. Scott Schoeneweis pitching. Giambi singled to right,
Jeter to second. Francisco Rodriguez pitching. Williams walked,
loading the bases. The runners moved up a base on a wild pitch, Jeter
scoring. Posada struck out swinging. Mondesi walked. Johnson grounded
back to the pitcher. One run, two hits, three left.</TE>
<TE>   ANGELS: Angels 9, Yankees 4--Glaus struck out swinging. Spiezio
singled to left. Wooten popped to second. Molina popped to second. No
runs, one hit, one left.</TE>
<TE>   EIGHTH INNING</TE>
<TE>   YANKEES: Angels 9, Yankees 4--Ventura flied to left. Rivera struck
out swinging. Soriano struck out swinging. This Rodriguez kid might
have a future in this game. No runs, no hits.</TE>
<TE>   ANGELS: Angels 9, Yankees 4--Steve Karsay pitching. Adam Kennedy
hit for Gil and flied to right. Eckstein grounded to short. With the
count 1-and-1, Joe Torre removed Karsay and brought in Mike Stanton.
That's weird. Angel fans are waving their Rally Monkeys. Hello, the
Angels are leading already. Don't waste the power of the Rally
Monkey. Erstad doubled to left. Salmon popped to first. No runs, one
hit, one left.</TE>
<TE>   NINTH INNING</TE>
<TE>   YANKEES: Angels 9, Yankees 5--Troy Percival pitching. Jeter struck
out swinging. Giambi flied to center. Williams singled to center.
Williams took second on defensive indifference. Posada singled to
right, Williams to third. This can't be happening, can it? Is the
Angel jinx alive and well? Mondesi singled off Kennedy's glove,
Williams scoring, Posada to second. Johnson popped to short. The
Yankee dynasty is officially over. One run, three hits, two left.</TE>

<HD>The Yankee Rippers</HD>
<DH>Angels use an eight-run, 10-hit fifth inning to get their
first postseason series win</DH>

<AU>BILL SHAIKIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Hello there, America. Meet some new heroes of October. Derek Jeter
has gone home for the winter. Bernie Williams has gone home too, and
Mariano Rivera, and the rest of the All-Star cast in pinstripes. In
their place, in this week's American League championship series, meet
the Angels, a team assembled from the farm system and the scrap heap.</LD>
<LD>   These heroes are guys like Shawn Wooten and Benji Gil, rescued by
the Angels from the pile of unwanted players. These heroes are guys
like Jarrod Washburn and Darin Erstad, small-town kids from the
Midwest. These heroes are guys like Tim Salmon and Garret Anderson
and Troy Percival, whose sustained excellence was long obscured by
the failings of this team. And these heroes extended their season
Saturday, conquering the mystique and aura in the visiting dugout and
the ghosts in the home dugout.</LD>
<LD>   For the first time in the 42-year history of a star-crossed
franchise, the Angels won a postseason series, with Wooten and Gil
leading a hit parade in a 9-5 victory over the New York Yankees at
Edison Field.</LD>
<TE>   For the first time since 1997, the World Series will go on without
the Yankees. After losing the first game of this best-of-five
division series, the Angels stormed back to win the next three,
earning a ticket to either Oakland or Minnesota for Tuesday's opener
of the league championship series. The Yankees, the mighty Yankees,
have been vanquished.</TE>
<TE>   "They're going to have to wait 'til next year," Gil said. "This
just might be the Halos' year."</TE>
<TE>   There would be no argument from the Yankee clubhouse. The Angels
ended all suspense in the fifth inning, sending 13 batters to the
plate, getting 10 hits and scoring eight runs. They hit .376 in the
four games, best ever in a postseason series.</TE>
<TE>   "If they keep playing the way they're playing, no one is going to
beat them," Jeter said.</TE>
<TE>   Washburn set the tone Saturday, willing his way to victory. The
Yankees forced him to throw 94 pitches in five innings, exhausting
for any pitcher and doubly so for one working on three days' rest.</TE>
<TE>   "I was gassed after about one inning," he said. "I was running on
fumes the rest of the day."</TE>
<TE>   But he refused to yield. With runners on second and third, one run
in and one out in the second inning, the Yankees did not score again.
With runners on second and third and none out in the fifth, the
Yankees scored once.</TE>
<TE>   And then the magic show started.</TE>
<TE>   Wooten led off the bottom of the fifth with a home run, tying the
score, 2-2. Bengie Molina flied out, and then the Angels strung
together five consecutive singles. Troy Glaus flied out, followed by
two singles, a two-run double by Molina and another single.</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody wanted to make the last out," Wooten said. "Next thing you
knew, it was eight runs later."</TE>
<TE>   Said Washburn: "I almost passed out a couple times from jumping up
and down. It was unbelievable."</TE>
<TE>   Wooten had two hits in the inning. So did Gil. The 10 hits tied a
postseason record set by the A's.</TE>
<TE>   The Philadelphia A's. In 1929.</TE>
<TE>   And so the countdown was on, the countdown to victory. With a
sellout crowd of 45,067 banging their red sticks together and
chanting "Go Home, Yankees" and otherwise making nonstop noise as the
innings passed, a relay team of relievers--Brendan Donnelly, Scott
Schoeneweis and Francisco Rodriguez--passed the lead to Percival. In
the ninth inning, Percival walked past the police officers and
security guards and horses, all ringing the field in anticipation.
The crowd stood for his every pitch.</TE>
<TE>   Upon the final out, a pop fly hit by Nick Johnson and caught by
shortstop David Eckstein, Percival dropped to his knees, then jumped
and pumped his fist. He then disappeared under a pile of teammates.
The Angels retreated to the clubhouse, where they enjoyed their
second champagne bath in 10 days. This one was less intense, Erstad
said, because the one that clinched the Angels' first playoff berth
in 16 years was the one that marked the end of curses, jinxes and
hexes transferred onto the backs of the current players.</TE>
<TE>   "We had to get the monkey off our backs, all that history with the
Angels," he said. "Now it's just fun. The pressure is off."</TE>
<TE>   As the Angels sprayed alcohol in every direction, Yankee Manager
Joe Torre and General Manager Brian Cashman appeared in the back of
the clubhouse. They had walked down the hallway to congratulate Angel
Manager Mike Scioscia and General Manager Bill Stoneman, a gesture
noted and appreciated among the Angels.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels can sleep late this morning, while the A's and Twins
stress out over the fifth and deciding game of their series. The
Angels will report to Edison Field this afternoon and board a plane
for the next round of the playoffs, for at least another week of a
magical season. The Yankees will be home by then, packing up for the
winter. For all those fans sick and tired of watching the Yankees
every October, well ...</TE>
<TE>   "They always say you either love the Yankees or hate the Yankees,"
Washburn said, "so I think we made a few new fans."</TE>
<TE>   America, meet the Angels. Their most popular player is Eckstein,
the shortstop who looks like somebody's kid brother lost on the
field.</TE>
<TE>   Eckstein caught that last out, then gave the ball to Percival. The
closer gave the ball right back and told Eckstein to keep it.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels have 102 victories and counting, and with four more
Percival might find himself with the game ball that puts the Angels
into their first World Series.</TE>

expected to start the league championship series opener Tuesday at
either Minnesota or Oakland. The Angel coaches will meet today to set
the rotation for the rest of the seven-game series.</LD>
<LD>   Ace Jarrod Washburn struggled Saturday, while working on three
days' rest, and the Angels aren't sure whether to try him again on
three days' rest Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   That start could go to Ramon Ortiz or rookie John Lackey. While
the excitable Ortiz did not survive the third inning Friday, walking
four, Manager Mike Scioscia said he did not believe Ortiz let his
emotions overcome him and would not hesitate to use him in the
championship series.</LD>
<TE>   "I don't think he got flustered," Scioscia said. "He was a little
too pumped up, and he was trying to generate more velocity than he
needed."</TE>
<TE>   Bill Shaikin</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Under the heading of not knowing what you're missing until it's
gone, Yankee Manager Joe Torre acknowledged before Saturday's game
that his team could have benefited from the presence of Paul O'Neill.</TE>
<TE>   A fiery competitor who often vented his frustration by beating up
on the water cooler or tossing his bat in the dugout, O'Neill retired
after last season.</TE>
<TE>   "Now that he's gone, we miss that stuff," Torre said, smiling.
"When he was here, everybody was critical of the fact he was hitting
things.... We miss O'Neill, no question. You miss the passion he
brings to the table."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Torre, who never hesitated to compliment the Angels for their
accomplishments, lavished even more kind words upon their fans for
the superb atmosphere that heightened the dramatic tension of Game 3
Friday.</TE>
<TE>   "I remember being here in '86 as a broadcaster and it was
exciting, but [Friday] night was deafening," he said. "I don't
remember it as loud as it was [Friday].</TE>
<TE>   "I know the rap Southern California fans get is that by the
seventh inning, they're off to the freeway, but you didn't see that."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Torre conceded the Yankees, though well prepared by detailed
scouting reports on the Angels, hadn't anticipated 20-year-old Angel
reliever Francisco Rodriguez would play such a prominent role in the
series. Rodriguez, a late September call-up by the Angels, was
credited with the wins in Games 2 and 3 and pitched 1 2/3 scoreless
innings Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   "He's got that big slider, and you can see he's young and
confident and got that inner conceit you need, the 'I dare you to hit
me,' " Torre said. "He was a surprise guy because we hadn't seen him,
but he certainly hasn't been affected by what's gone on."</TE>
<TE>   Scioscia said he didn't envision Rodriguez playing the role of
secret, Yankee-killing weapon when he included the young right-hander
on the team's division series roster.</TE>
<TE>   "Francisco Rodriguez was going to come to us when he was ready to
pitch," Scioscia said. "This is a guy who last year was pitching in
the Cal League. There's nothing covert here. We weren't trying to
spring him on the Yankees.... If he was ready in June, and some
people on our club thought he was, he would have been here in June.
He's certainly shown he's ready for the challenge of pitching in a
major league playoff game."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Yankees sent Roger Clemens back to New York on Friday for a
possible Game 5 start.</TE>

<HD>Special Day for Gil and Wooten</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE SPRINGER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Shawn Wooten found an empty spot in the corner of the Angel dugout,
far from all the screaming and laughing and high-fiving, and sat down
for a moment of reflection with his father, Bob, who died last year.</LD>
<LD>   Benji Gil screamed and laughed and high-fived until he was certain
he had exorcised the demons lurking in his mind from Game 2 of the
division series between the Angels and New York Yankees.</LD>
<LD>   The scene in the Angel clubhouse at Edison Field after the team's
series-clinching 9-5 victory Saturday afternoon was one of unbridled
joy. But nobody could have enjoyed it more than Gil and Wooten.</LD>
<TE>   Gil, a right-handed hitting second baseman, has been platooned
with Adam Kennedy, usually getting the start against left-handers.</TE>
<TE>   Gil got the call in Yankee Stadium in Game 2. In the sixth inning,
with the Angels holding on to a 4-3 lead, the Yankees had a man
aboard with one out. Juan Rivera hit a potential double-play grounder
to shortstop David Eckstein. Eckstein flipped to Gil, but the ball
appeared to stick in Gil's glove, causing him to make a bad throw to
first. With the inning kept alive, Alfonso Soriano followed with a
two-run homer to put the Yankees ahead.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels came back to win, 8-6, but Gil couldn't forget his
error.</TE>
<TE>   "That win was bittersweet," Gil said, "because I made a mistake
that was costly."</TE>
<TE>   With David Wells, a left-hander, starting Game 4, Gil figured to
be in the lineup. Or did he?</TE>
<TE>   Kennedy, after hitting .312 in the regular season to Gil's .285,
hit .571 (four for seven) through the first three games of this
series. In Game 3, Kennedy went three for three, including a home
run, and made a highlight-reel play at second base.</TE>
<TE>   Add to that the fact Gil was one-for-17 lifetime against Wells
(Kennedy was 0 for 6) and an argument could certainly be made for
sticking with Kennedy. Several reporters made that argument with
Angel Manager Mike Scioscia before the game.</TE>
<TE>   As for Gil, he didn't lose any sleep over the decision. Just the
opposite.</TE>
<TE>   "I wanted the opportunity to play," said Gil, "but I knew it was
no sure thing. Yet, even though normally I don't sleep well the night
before a game, this time, I slept like a baby."</TE>
<TE>   And he could have been excused if he cried like a baby when he
entered the Angel clubhouse and saw his name in the No. 9 spot.</TE>
<TE>   "I was so pumped up," Gil said.</TE>
<TE>   The Yankees soon felt the force of that emotion. Gil went three
for three, including two singles in the fifth inning, the inning in
which the Angel scored a division-series record eight runs.</TE>
<TE>   It's been a long road for Gil, from Castle Park High in Chula
Vista to Butte, Mont., where he broke into professional baseball on a
rookie-league team, to the Texas Rangers, and finally the Angels the
last three seasons.</TE>
<TE>   "If you had told me two or three years ago, I'd be standing here,"
said Gil, as he paused in the Angel clubhouse after chasing teammates
around with a bottle of tequila, "I might have told you, you must
have just fallen out of a tree."</TE>
<TE>   Wooten, who platoons with Brad Fullmer at designated hitter, might
have made the same statement. He seemed destined to be a career minor
leaguer, having played everywhere from Bristol, Conn., to Moose Jaw,
Saskatchewan, of the independent Prairie League.</TE>
<TE>   That would pretty much be the end of the line in the minds of most
players. But Wooten always had his father, Bob, whispering in his
ear, giving him confidence, even when injuries got him down. "He told
me that I could always go back to school," Wooten said, "but if I
still had a love for the game, I should play it out."</TE>
<TE>   Wooten finally made it to the Angels for seven games in 2000. A
year later, his father, his biggest fan, died of cancer.</TE>
<TE>   Wooten started Saturday and went three for four with a home run.
After scoring in that wild fifth inning, he took time out for a
private conversation with his father.</TE>
<TE>   "I sat on the bench and thanked him," Wooten said. "Without him, I
wouldn't be here today."</TE>
<TE>   Without Wooten, Gil and the other role players, the Angels
wouldn't be where they are today, preparing for the American League
championship series.</TE>

<HD>Unearned Run Isn't Average</HD>
<DH>American League: Bizarre seven-run rally in fourth inning
propels Twins to 11-2 win over A's, forcing a Game 5.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE DiGIOVANNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MINNEAPOLIS</DL>
<LD>Had the baseball gods conspired to concoct their most bizarre inning,
one in which everything imaginable could go right for one team and
wrong for another, it might have looked something like the Minnesota
Twins' fourth Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   The Oakland Athletics committed two errors, one on what looked to
be an easy toss by usually sure-handed shortstop Miguel Tejada; threw
two wild pitches, both allowing runners to score; hit a batter; gave
up four hits, and could blame none of it on the quirky, often
game-altering Metrodome.</LD>
<LD>   By the time the Twins had sent 11 men to the plate, they had
scored seven unearned runs and were well on their way to an 11-2
blowout of the A's in Game 4 of the American League division series,
evening the best-of-five match at two games apiece.</LD>
<TE>   The teams will meet for a decisive Game 5 today in Oakland, where
A's left-hander Mark Mulder will oppose Twin right-hander Brad Radke.
The winner advances to the AL championship series against the Angels;
the loser goes home for the winter.</TE>
<TE>   The heavily favored A's will need to shake off one of their worst
games of the year, an effort third baseman Eric Chavez described as
"comical" and "ugly." The Twins, playing with a chip on their
shoulder because Commissioner Bud Selig tried to eliminate them last
winter, seem loose, confident, as if they have nothing to lose.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone counts us out," center fielder Torii Hunter said. "We
get tired of people telling us we have no chance. We have a chance.
We're underdogs, and we like it. No team wants to get eliminated. Our
whole team almost got eliminated last winter, so we're used to it."</TE>
<TE>   Both teams will face demons. The A's have lost Game 5 of the
division series for the last two years, both to the New York Yankees,
while the Twins have gone 23-31 in games against left-handed starters
this season, including a Game 2 loss to Mulder.</TE>
<TE>   "The media makes a big deal of how we do against left-handers, but
we've lost to some pretty good lefties," Minnesota left fielder
Jacque Jones said. "We just need to be patient, make him throw the
ball where we can hit it. We can't be overanxious. We've been
overanxious this whole series, this whole season."</TE>
<TE>   Saturday, the Twins got a solid start from their left-hander, Eric
Milton, who gave up two runs and six hits, including Tejada's two-run
homer in the third, and struck out three in seven innings.</TE>
<TE>   Minnesota countered with two runs in the bottom of the third on
RBI at-bats by Cristian Guzman (groundout) and David Ortiz (double),
and then the A's collapsed in the fourth.</TE>
<TE>   Doug Mientkiewicz, who had three hits, including a two-run homer
in the seventh, and made a superb diving stop of Terrence Long's
grounder to end the top of the fourth, opened the bottom of the
inning with a single to center. Michael Cuddyer struck out, and A.J.
Pierzynski walked.</TE>
<TE>   Luis Rivas hit a grounder to the shortstop hole, and Tejada,
fielding the ball as he moved to his right, needed a mere 25-foot
flip to third to force Mientkiewicz. But the ball slipped out of his
hand and his throw sailed about five feet over Chavez's head and
bounced into a camera well, allowing a run to score.</TE>
<TE>   "Miguel usually makes that play with his eyes shut," said Oakland
pitcher Tim Hudson, who started on three days' rest and didn't make
it out of the fourth. "That started a chain reaction, and things
started snowballing from there."</TE>
<TE>   It was more like an avalanche. Hudson bounced a splitter past
catcher Ramon Hernandez for a wild pitch, Pierzynski scoring to make
it 4-2, and Jones was hit by a pitch, putting runners on first and
third.</TE>
<TE>   Guzman slapped a grounder to first baseman Scott Hatteberg, who
had such an easy play at the plate that Rivas, running on contact,
stopped about 15 feet from home, hoping to get caught in a rundown.</TE>
<TE>   But Hatteberg hesitated before firing a one-hop throw in the dirt
that Hernandez couldn't handle. Rivas tiptoed around the catcher to
score, and the Twins were ahead, 5-2. Manager Art Howe pulled Hudson
in favor of Game 1 goat Ted Lilly, who gave up an RBI single to Corey
Koskie that made it 6-2.</TE>
<TE>   Guzman scored on Lilly's wild pitch for a 7-2 lead, and Hunter's
RBI double to left-center, a play on which Long, the A's center
fielder, fell on his back after fielding the ball, made it 8-2.</TE>
<TE>   Mientkiewicz, whose single started the madness, capped the rally
with an RBI single that made it 9-2, setting a division series record
for runs in an inning--a record eclipsed by the Angels' eight-run
fifth later Saturday--and leaving both dugouts stunned.</TE>
<TE>   "Miguel Tejada is an MVP candidate, a Gold Glove candidate, but
when we get guys running around the field and force teams to play
catch, sometimes that happens," Jones said. "Anybody can make an
error any time. You're not immune."</TE>

<KH>TWIN-A'S REPORT</KH>
<HD>Can They Find a Way to Outfox Mulder?</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE DiGIOVANNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MINNEAPOLIS</DL>
<LD>In the postgame interview room Saturday, Minnesota first baseman Doug
Mientkiewicz said it seemed as if Oakland left-hander Mark Mulder had
beaten the Twins "300 times in a row." Fifteen minutes later, in the
Twins' clubhouse, Mientkiewicz said it seemed Mulder had beaten the
Twins "400 times in a row."</LD>
<LD>   By the time Minnesota squares off against Mulder and the A's in
Game 5 of the American League division series today in Network
Associates Coliseum, Mulder will have an 800-game winning streak
against the Twins.</LD>
<LD>   For the record, Mulder was 4-2 with a 2.16 earned-run average in
eight career starts against the Twins going into Game 2 of this
series, when he limited Minnesota to one run and five hits in six
innings of a 9-1 Oakland victory. But to the Twins, Mulder might as
well be the second coming of Sandy Koufax.</LD>
<TE>   "We are going up against the best pitcher in our league,"
Mientkiewicz said of Mulder, who went 19-7 with a 3.47 ERA this
season. "Hopefully he'll let us win one for a change."</TE>
<TE>   Mulder didn't have his best stuff in Game 2, but he found a
cooperative group of Twins, who swung at pitches out of the strike
zone and often took him off the hook.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to do some things different against Mulder," Twin center
fielder Torii Hunter said. "We have to watch some videotapes, make
some adjustments. But he's human. He's not a robot."</TE>
<TE>   Mulder, like Game 4 starter Tim Hudson, will be starting on three
days' rest for the first time in his career, "but I don't have any
problem with it," Mulder said. "With the adrenaline that gets going
for the playoffs, it's not going to make a bit of difference whether
it's two days or three days or four days."</TE>
<TE>   The A's are certain they have the right guy on the mound.</TE>
<TE>   "I just hope he has one more big game left in him," Oakland third
baseman Eric Chavez said. "Everyone said from the beginning of the
year that if we win, it will be because of our pitchers. If these
guys don't carry us, we're not going to go very far."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   After Mientkiewicz homered in the seventh inning Saturday, he
crossed the plate and pointed to his wife, Jodi, in the crowd.</TE>
<TE>   "She's losing her mind," Mientkiewicz said. "She can't take much
more of this. I told her, 'Hopefully we'll stick around some more.' "</TE>
<TE>   The Twins are 5-0 when facing elimination at the Metrodome in the
postseason. They'll try to win another elimination game today, but in
Oakland.</TE>
<TE>   "We've been through hell and back together, and everybody makes a
big thing about our backs being against the wall," Mientkiewicz said.
"Our backs have been against the wall since pretty much the day we
were born in this group, so this is nothing new for us."</TE>

<HD>Texas, Oklahoma Set Up a Showdown</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Texas Longhorns said they weren't looking past Oklahoma State to
their matchup with rival Oklahoma.</LD>
<LD>   Right.</LD>
<LD>   Second-ranked Texas will have a hard time getting anyone to
believe that after Saturday's 17-15 victory at Austin, Texas, over
the Cowboys that took cornerback Rod Babers' defensive stop on a
two-point conversion and a drive-killing interception in the fourth
quarter to seal the victory.</LD>
<TE>   Meanwhile, at Columbia, Mo., No. 3 Oklahoma almost got caught
looking ahead too.</TE>
<TE>   The Sooners needed a touchdown on a fake field goal with 6:33 left
to escape with a 31-24 victory over Missouri.</TE>
<TE>   The victories set up next Saturday's showdown at Norman, Okla.,
with the winner taking the inside track in the Big 12 Conference's
South division.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a good, hard fight," said Texas quarterback Chris Simms,
who passed for 267 yards and a touchdown and also ran for one. "I
think it's really good we got a good hard test like this."</TE>
<TE>   Entering next week's game against Oklahoma, Texas is 5-0 for the
first time since 1983. The Longhorns went undefeated in the regular
season that year.</TE>
<TE>   Leading 17-9 in the fourth, Texas pinned Oklahoma State (2-3, 0-1)
on its own one-yard line after a punt. Josh Fields then passed to
Rashaun Woods for a 25-yard completion, and a 25-yard run by Seymore
Shaw quickly moved the ball to midfield for the Cowboys.</TE>
<TE>   Facing third and 23 from the Texas 33, Fields threw a prayer to
John Lewis, who came down with the ball just inside the goal line for
the touchdown.</TE>
<TE>   On the two-point try, Fields found Woods at the goal line, but his
back was turned to the end zone and Babers stopped him before he
could get across.</TE>
<TE>   Texas tailback Cedric Benson ran for 117 yards in 27 carries.
Simms was 24 of 46 with one interception.</TE>
<TE>   Brad Smith, Missouri's redshirt freshman quarterback, also made
Oklahoma (5-0, 1-0) earn its victory.</TE>
<TE>   Smith had the Sooners on the run all game. He carried 26 times for
213 yards--a record for Missouri quarterbacks--and two touchdowns. He
also threw for 178 yards and a score, accounting for 391 of the
Tigers' 449 yards.</TE>
<TE>   "As a team and as a head coach, I feel very fortunate--lucky--to
have been able to have fought through this and won," Oklahoma Coach
Bob Stoops said.</TE>
<TE>   The winning touchdown was a stunner. Holder Matt McCoy took the
snap, waited a moment, then threw a perfect lob to freshman tight end
Chris Chester, who went up and caught the ball between two defenders
for his first career reception. Nate Hybl's two-point conversion pass
to Curtis Fagan made it 31-24.</TE>
<TE>   The Tigers (3-2, 0-1) had the ball at their 23 with 1:39 left and
drove to the Oklahoma 35, but Smith was sacked on fourth down with
five seconds left.</TE>
<TE>   Texas Tech 48, No. 23 Texas A&amp;M 47--Kliff Kingsbury threw his
fifth touchdown pass in overtime and Robert Treece followed with the
extra point as the Red Raiders (4-2, 1-0) rallied from an 18-point
deficit to defeat the Aggies (3-2, 0-1) at College Station, Texas.</TE>
<TE>   The Aggie loss spoiled a stellar performance by quarterback Dustin
Long, who threw seven touchdown passes to set a conference record,
and completed 21 of 37 passes for 367 yards. His last touchdown was a
three-yard pass to Terrence Thomas in overtime that put Texas A&amp;M
ahead 47-41. But John Pierson missed the extra point--his second one
of the game--to leave the door open for the Red Raiders.</TE>
<TE>   Kingsbury completed 49 of 59 passes for 474 yards and passed to
Nehemiah Glover for a 10-yard touchdown on Tech's overtime
possession. Treece followed with the winning extra point. Earlier he
kicked two 42-yard field goals, the second of which forced overtime.</TE>
<TE>   Baylor 35, Kansas 32--Daniel Andino kicked a 33-yard field goal
with a half-second left, ending four years of Big 12 misery for the
Bears as they defeated the Jayhawks at Waco, Texas, to end a 29-game
conference losing streak.</TE>
<TE>   Baylor (3-2, 1-0) blew an early 14-0 lead but scored 11 points in
the last 1:18 to defeat Kansas (2-4, 0-2). Baylor also defeated
Kansas for its last Big 12 win in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   Nebraska 38, McNeese State 14--Jammal Lord set Nebraska records
for total yards and rushing yards by a quarterback as the Cornhuskers
(4-2) bounced back from consecutive losses with a victory over the
Division I-AA Cowboys (4-1) at Lincoln, Neb.</TE>
<TE>   Lord ran 17 times for 218 yards and three touchdowns, breaking the
school's single-game rushing mark of 199 yards, set by Tommie Frazier
in the 1996 Fiesta Bowl against Florida. Lord also completed 12 of 18
passes for 151 yards with a touchdown and an interception.</TE>

<HD>Colorado, Hodge Handle Kansas State</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>BOULDER, Colo.</DL>
<LD>He didn't throw well enough, they said, and he was too small to be an
effective major-college quarterback.</LD>
<LD>   Robert Hodge had a resounding response to his skeptics Saturday,
completing 13 of 20 passes for 289 yards and three touchdowns as
Colorado defeated No. 13 Kansas State, 35-31.</LD>
<LD>   "I don't know what people think of me," Hodge said. "I just want
to go out there and do what I can for my team to help us win."</LD>
<TE>   Hodge got his first start three weeks ago against USC, after Craig
Ochs was sidelined because of a concussion, and Hodge was dreadful.
Colorado managed only 61 total yards in a 40-3 drubbing.</TE>
<TE>   "I knew I could be a lot better than that," he said. "I wanted to
prove to my teammates I could get it done."</TE>
<TE>   Hodge's passing performance on Saturday was the sixth-best by a
Colorado quarterback.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought Robert played very valiantly," Colorado Coach Gary
Barnett said.</TE>
<TE>   "He just keeps getting better. He has improved every game he's
played. I've told a number of people that he throws a great deep
ball, and he proved it today."</TE>
<TE>   Chris Brown ran for 167 yards and two scores as the Buffaloes held
on to win the Big 12 Conference opener for both teams.</TE>
<TE>   Colorado (3-2) opened defense of its conference championship with
483 total yards and scoring plays of 94, 85 and 71 yards.</TE>
<TE>   Kansas State (4-1), which had scoring plays of 71 and 80 yards,
rallied from a 35-14 deficit early in the third quarter but had to
settle for Jared Brite's 35-yard field goal with 2:16 left instead of
a tying touchdown.</TE>
<TE>   Wildcat quarterback Ell Roberson, who ran for 178 yards and threw
for 83 more, was sacked by defensive tackle Sam Wilder for a
nine-yard loss on third down at the Colorado 18 in the waning
minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Brite kicked the field goal, but Kansas State didn't get the ball
back. On third down, Hodge's pass fell incomplete, but defensive back
James Dunnigan was called for pass interference, giving Colorado a
first down with 1:24 left.</TE>

<LD>There really was no one play to point to, only a series in the fifth
inning when the Angels sent 13 batters to the plate and strung
together 10 hits for eight runs to take a 9-2 lead. Every Angel got a
hit in the inning except Troy Glaus, and Shawn Wooten got two hits,
including a home run to lead off the inning.</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<LD>   Angel fans: You have to wait all the way until Tuesday to see this
team play again. Yankee fans: Your starting pitching was atrocious.
Clemens, Pettitte, Mussina and Wells finished with a combined ERA of
10.38. Everyone was concerned whether closer Mariano Rivera was 100%
for this series, and it turned out they didn't need him.</LD>

<TE>   The Yankees grounded into six double plays against Washburn in two
games. Only eight batters grounded into double plays against Washburn
during the season. Also, the 10 hits by the Angels in the fifth
inning tied the postseason record set by the Philadelphia Athletics
in the fourth game of the 1929 World Series.</TE>

DID YOU NOTICE?</TE>

<TE>   The Yankees continued to point fingers at one another during the
game, the most notable example being David Wells getting upset with
Alfonso Soriano for an error. Things like that never happened when
Paul O'Neill and Tino Martinez were on the team, because they would
have gotten all over a teammate who did that.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Lee Evans' absence finally caught up with Wisconsin, on the day he'd
hoped to return to the Badgers' lineup.</LD>
<LD>   Zack Mills guided Penn State on seven scoring drives, Robbie Gould
kicked four field goals and Jimmy Kennedy had four sacks, and the
20th-ranked Nittany Lions beat the 19th-ranked Badgers, 34-31,
Saturday at Madison, Wis.</LD>
<LD>   Larry Johnson had 171 all-purpose yards for Penn State (4-1, 1-1
Big Ten) before leaving with a hamstring injury in the second half.</LD>
<TE>   The Badgers (5-1, 0-1) were hoping to have Evans--their star
playmaker--back for their first conference game. But the Big Ten's
leading receiver in 2001 was on the sideline in shorts. He injured
his left knee in a spring game April 20.</TE>
<TE>   Trailing, 28-23, with 11:24 left, the Badgers got the ball at the
Penn State 47, their best field position in the game. But Darren
Charles had his second drop of the game, then Jonathan Orr let a pass
from Brooks Bollinger bounce off his chest at the 25 on third down.</TE>
<TE>   Then Gould kicked field goals of 51 and 40 yards, giving the
Nittany Lions an 11-point lead with 2:55 left. The Badgers pulled to
within 34-31 with 1:17 left, as Bollinger hit Orr for a 28-yard
touchdown and Dwayne Smith ran in the two-point conversion. But Penn
State linebacker LaMar Stewart recovered the onside kick and the
Nittany Lions ran out the clock.</TE>
<TE>   No. 24 Iowa 31, Purdue 28--Brad Banks engineered an 87-yard
scoring drive with 2:16 remaining and no timeouts, capped by a
seven-yard touchdown pass to Dallas Clark on fourth and goal to lead
the Hawkeyes at Iowa City, Iowa.</TE>
<TE>   The winning drive was the most consistent offensive effort for
Iowa (5-1, 2-0), which was outplayed by Purdue (3-3, 1-1) for much of
the game. Iowa needed two special teams touchdowns and a 95-yard
touchdown pass from Banks to Clark just to have a chance to win at
the end.</TE>
<TE>   Purdue reserve quarterback Brandon Kirsch took the Boilermakers on
their final possession to the Iowa 25 before his pass was deflected,
then intercepted by Adolphus Shelton.</TE>

<HD>Ohio State Sputters, but Stops Northwestern</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>EVANSTON, Ill.</DL>
<LD>Freshman Maurice Clarett ran for two touchdowns on the way to his
fourth consecutive 100-yard game--one shy of the school record--and
Mike Nugent kicked two field goals as fifth-ranked Ohio State held
off scrappy Northwestern, 27-16, Saturday night.</LD>
<LD>   Clarett finished with 140 yards rushing, giving him 715 in five
games, but he also fumbled three times. Craig Krenzel completed 11 of
22 passes for 170 yards and ran for 62 yards for Ohio State (6-0, 2-0
Big Ten).</LD>
<LD>   It was the Buckeyes' 23rd consecutive victory over Northwestern
(2-4, 0-2 Big Ten), a streak dating to 1971.</LD>
<TE>   The Wildcats had plenty of chances to break their losing streak,
but they missed two field goals and had to settle for field goals on
two other possessions inside the Ohio State 10.</TE>
<TE>   "There were critical plays and the credit goes to Ohio State. They
made them and we didn't," Northwestern Coach Randy Walker said. "You
can't get some of those plays back on the goal line."</TE>
<TE>   The Buckeyes didn't score until the second quarter, on a
three-yard run by Lydell Ross. They added another touchdown on
Clarett's two-yard run with 2:43 left in the half for a 14-9 lead.</TE>
<TE>   Northwestern had a chance to seize the momentum just before
halftime when Wright had a 31-yard run and 31-yard reception, putting
Northwestern at the Ohio State four. But the Wildcats couldn't get
into the end zone, and Wasielewski's 18-yard field goal attempt was
wide right.</TE>

<HD>Baker Feels Heat for Loss</HD>
<DH>National League: His decision to go with Aybar in
bases-loaded situation backfires and Braves beat Giants, 10-2.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JASON REID</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>Manager Dusty Baker may not have much time left with the San
Francisco Giants, who hear the clock ticking in the National League
division series.</LD>
<LD>   Baker's contract expires at the end of the Giants' season, which
could come today after the Atlanta Braves capitalized on his
questionable pitching move Saturday, breaking open Game 3 in a 10-2
victory at Pacific Bell Park.</LD>
<LD>   With one out in the sixth, the score tied, 1-1, and starter Jason
Schmidt having walked the bases loaded, Baker turned to journeyman
Manny Aybar to face No. 6 batter Vinny Castilla, and things quickly
turned ugly for the Giants.</LD>
<TE>   Aybar broke Castilla's bat with his first pitch, but the ball
landed in shallow left field for a two-run single and 3-1 lead for
Atlanta, which became 6-1 when light-hitting Keith Lockhart connected
on Aybar's second pitch for a three-run home run to right, silencing
a sellout crowd of 43,043.</TE>
<TE>   Baker summoned Aybar, once traded five times in a span of 20
months, instead of middle reliever Felix Rodriguez or setup man Tim
Worrell to face Castilla. Baker then stuck with Aybar over a
left-hander to challenge the left-handed batting Lockhart.</TE>
<TE>   Castilla had been two for eight with a home run in his career
against Aybar and Lockhart was one for three against the middle
reliever.</TE>
<TE>   "Jason had lost control of the strike zone and walked three guys
in a row with Castilla coming up," said Baker, 2-8 in three playoff
series. "Manny had had relative success against him, Vinny is prone
to the double play, and Manny is probably my best guy down in the
bullpen.</TE>
<TE>   "He also has the ability to throw the sinker and slider to try to
get double plays, so that's what led to the pitching change. I know I
had a left-hander warming up [for] Lockhart, but Lockhart had not
hurt us in the series."</TE>
<TE>   Of course, that changed, and Greg Maddux benefited from the
support.</TE>
<TE>   The four-time Cy Young Award winner pitched well for six innings,
giving up two runs and Barry Bonds' second homer in the series among
five hits, after being moved back in the playoff rotation because of
a lingering blister problem. Then Manager Bobby Cox relied on his
league-best bullpen with the Braves en route to their second straight
rout over the Giants.</TE>
<TE>   Chris Hammond, Mike Remlinger and Kevin Gryboski each worked a
perfect inning, and the Braves scored four more runs in the ninth to
compound the Giants' frustration while moving within a victory of
winning the best-of-five series.</TE>
<TE>   Despite a successful 10-year run at the Giants' helm, Baker has
taken heat for the club's recent postseason flops, and the
temperature rose Saturday in the sixth.</TE>
<TE>   "After that big inning, it was kind of tough," first baseman J.T.
Snow said. "You kind of felt the air go out of the stands, and our
dugout was a little flat. It just all happened so fast."</TE>
<TE>   Schmidt, a rookie on the Braves' 1995 World Series title team,
matched his former teammate through five innings but labored in the
sixth after Julio Franco struck out, walking Gary Sheffield, Chipper
Jones and Andruw Jones.</TE>
<TE>   "They had their big heart of the lineup coming up there, so I just
tried to be a little bit more careful to a couple of the guys," said
Schmidt, who threw 104 pitches in 5 1/3 innings. "Looking back, I
could have been a little more aggressive."</TE>
<TE>   Lockhart was aggressive against Aybar, jumping on a first-pitch
sinker after watching Castilla's first-pitch success.</TE>
<TE>   Aybar declined to speak with reporters as he left the clubhouse.</TE>
<TE>   "Mainly, he's a sinker/slider pitcher, and I was expecting
sinkers," said Lockhart, two for five with four runs batted in. "I
kept my hands back a little bit and kind of got it pretty good."</TE>
<TE>   And now a loss today could be Baker's last with the Giants.</TE>

<HD>Facing Hernandez Is Painful Reminder</HD>

<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>How long can the Atlanta Braves carry a grudge?</LD>
<LD>   Well, at least six years, judging by comments Manager Bobby Cox
made Saturday about the last game San Francisco Giant right-hander
Livan Hernandez started against the Braves in the postseason.</LD>
<LD>   As a 22-year-old rookie with the Florida Marlins in 1997,
Hernandez, scheduled to start Game 4 today at Pacific Bell Park, tied
the league championship series record with 15 strikeouts in a 2-1
victory over Atlanta.</LD>
<TE>   The Braves complained about the wide strike zone of Eric Gregg,
saying Hernandez's pitches were unhittable because of the former
umpire's help, and Cox revisited that topic. Atlanta is leading the
best-of-five series, 2-1.</TE>
<TE>   "We could have blown that game wide open in the first inning," Cox
said, "but everything he threw was called a strike, and about 90% of
them were not even close."</TE>
<TE>   Not surprisingly, Hernandez, who started Game 5 because Kevin
Brown had a stomach virus, had a different recollection.</TE>
<TE>   "I was really pitching in that game," said Hernandez, named the
most valuable player of the championship series Florida won in six
games before defeating Cleveland for the World Series title. "They
were looking for an excuse."</TE>
<TE>   Hernandez struggled this season, going 12-16 with a 4.38
earned-run average, but is 5-0 with a 2.75 ERA in six postseason
appearances. Hernandez's playoff record, and his history in October
against the Braves, prompted Giant Manager Dusty Baker to use a
four-man rotation for the series.</TE>
<TE>   "We would much rather go with a rested Livan than somebody else on
two or three days' rest," Baker said.</TE>
<TE>   The Braves are turning to Tom Glavine on three days' rest, needing
the two-time Cy Young Award winner to rebound quickly after his
ineffective five-inning outing in Game 1.</TE>
<TE>   The left-hander, who relies on precision command, threw only 49
strikes in 86 pitches, giving up 10 hits and six earned runs in an
8-5 loss. The all-time leader in playoff victories and losses,
Glavine said his approach won't change much today.</TE>
<TE>   "There will be some things I'll do differently, but not anything
in terms of my mechanics," he said. "I thought I threw the ball well.
I just didn't get good results."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Second baseman Keith Lockhart enjoyed a moment in the spotlight
after hitting the first playoff home run of his career in the Braves'
five-run sixth inning Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   "Well, everything happens for a reason," he said. "I've always
felt pretty comfortable in the postseason when I had a chance to
play, and I feel like I'm in the right spot. Bobby has had a lot of
confidence in me the whole time, and I'm just glad I can give
something back."</TE>

<LD>Rick Telander of the Chicago Sun-Times commenting on--make that
ridiculing--the membership of Augusta National: "USA Today released
the formerly secret names of the high-profile old geezers who make up
the membership. They are old geezers, by the way--average age is 72,
with the youngest being 39 and the oldest, if he hasn't keeled over
face-first into Amen Corner, 97--and something about that list made
my flesh crawl....</LD>
<LD>   "I was thinking that if the starter said it was time for me to tee
off with my foursome, of, say Sam Nunn, the former senator turned
Coca-Cola board official; Peter Coors, chairman of the Coors brewing
company and the guy who does those smarmy mountaintop beer ads; and
Lou Holtz, the lisping little con man who currently coaches football
at South Carolina, I would ask if simply killing myself was an
option."</LD>
<LD>   Trivia time: Who was the first running back to gain 1,000 or more
yards in the Pacific Coast Conference?</LD>
<TE>   Did she practice? Queen Elizabeth will drop the ceremonial puck
today in an exhibition game between the San Jose Sharks and Canucks
in Vancouver.</TE>
<TE>   With the queen's busy schedule, a media coordinator thinks it's
unlikely she will practice her technique.</TE>
<TE>   Comment: It isn't that difficult, is it?</TE>
<TE>   Different attitude: Mike Bianchi of the Orlando Sentinel, on what
it's like for college football teams to play in Tallahassee: "They
used to come here without hope. They used to come here to die. No
more.</TE>
<TE>   "Now they come here not only thinking they might be able to defeat
Florida State, but believing they can.</TE>
<TE>   "The Clemson Tigers did not beat the Seminoles Thursday night
[losing, 48-31], but that is not the point. The point is they thought
they would and played as if they could."</TE>
<TE>   Out of place: From comedy writer Jerry Perisho: "The Utah Jazz
signed veteran point guard Mark Jackson to a one-year contract to
back up John Stockton.</TE>
<TE>   "Mark Jackson in Salt Lake City? That's as good a fit as asking
the Mormon Tabernacle Choir to open for the Rolling Stones."</TE>
<TE>   Read at your own risk: Jerry Greene in the Orlando Sentinel: "Two
eskimos sitting in a kayak were chilly, but when they lit a fire in
the craft, it sank--proving that you can't have your kayak and heat
it too."</TE>
<TE>   Looking back: On this day in 1968, the St. Louis Cardinals
defeated the Detroit Tigers, 10-1, to take a three-games-to-one lead
in the World Series. However, the Tigers rallied to win the Series.</TE>
<TE>   Bay watch: From the Caught on the Fly column in the Sporting News:
"With the Rams, Seasquawks and Cardinals sinking, it should be smooth
sailing for the Forty-whiners in the NFC-minus West, but Frisco
forecasters are spotting disturbing trends. Jeff Garcia's deep balls
are anything but, and his quick outs have been as crisp as soaking
sourdough."</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: Morley Drury of USC, 1,163 yards in 1927.</TE>
<TE>   And finally:  Scott Ostler in the San Francisco Chronicle: "Cops
find pot residue in Randy Moss' ashtray and Moss is baffled. Who
would have done such a thing to him? Moss vows to devote the rest of
his life to finding the real stoners."</TE>

<HD>Boller's Best Helps Defeat Washington</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SEATTLE</DL>
<LD>Kyle Boller waited his whole life to play such a great game. The way
he saw it, the Washington Huskies just happened to be the team on the
other side of the line.</LD>
<LD>   Boller threw for 266 yards and a career-high five touchdowns as
California defeated No. 12 Washington, 34-27, on Saturday, ending a
19-game losing streak in the series.</LD>
<LD>   "I can honestly say this is the best game I've ever played, high
school or college," Boller said. "It was the best feeling to look up
in the stands afterward. I saw my mom jumping up and down."</LD>
<TE>   The Golden Bears (4-2, 1-1 Pac-10) beat Washington (3-2, 0-1) for
the first time since Nov. 9, 1976. They also ended a 17-game
home-field winning streak by the Huskies.</TE>
<TE>   "We can say, 'It's history. It's over,' " Boller said. "People
will remember 2002 as the year the Golden Bears came in here, played
a good game and won."</TE>
<TE>   Boller completed 13 of 24 passes without an interception,
outdueling Washington's Cody Pickett, the nation's No. 2 passer.
Pickett completed 35 of 59 for 399 yards, but two of those passes
were intercepted.</TE>
<TE>   The Huskies rallied to beat California the last three years, and
they seemed ready to do it again. Pickett's one-yard touchdown run on
an option play pulled Washington to within 34-24 with 4:03 remaining.</TE>
<TE>   Greg Carothers recovered a fumble by Joe Igber on Cal's ensuing
series, and the Huskies reached the final margin on John Anderson's
fourth field goal of the day, a 37-yarder with 1:54 to play.</TE>
<TE>   "That was scary, how similar this game was to what's happened
before," Boller said.</TE>
<TE>   Cal's Geoff McArthur recovered the ensuing onside kick, and the
Bears ran out the clock.</TE>
<TE>   "I would have never dreamed in my wildest dreams that I would lose
to Cal," Washington guard Elliott Zajac said. "It was horrendous."</TE>
<TE>   Said Boller: "All that matters is we won. I could have thrown for
eight yards or 800 yards. I don't even know how many yards I had.
It's just awesome to see everybody so happy. We just performed."</TE>

<HD>Brand Stays Optimistic About Season</HD>

<AU>ELLIOTT TEAFORD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>PALM DESERT</DL>
<LD>Elton Brand went for a swim Saturday, the first step in
rehabilitating his surgically altered right knee.</LD>
<LD>   The Clippers' latest estimate for Brand's return from arthroscopic
surgery to remove torn cartilage is four to six weeks from Saturday,
which would sidelined him for the season-opening game Oct. 30 against
the Cleveland Cavaliers.</LD>
<LD>   Brand, who was joining his teammates at training camp for the
first time, said it will be "only a couple of weeks" before he's
ready to go.</LD>
<TE>   "It feels much better than before the surgery [Sept. 26]," he
said. "It's lots better already. I'm looking forward to a great
season. I think we can do some big things. There's lots to prove."</TE>
<TE>   Brand and the Clippers were unable during the off-season to
complete a long-term contract for the All-Star power forward,
agreeing to pick up the negotiations next July 1.</TE>
<TE>   Brand sought a six-season contract worth about $75 million. The
Clippers offered $60 million over the same span.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not worried," Brand said of the stalled contract talks. "I'm
very confident. I'm going to have a great season. The team is going
to have a great season. I won't worry about that."</TE>
<TE>   Brand discounted the notion that the young and immature Clippers
will be distracted by the task at hand because so many of them have
contract issues. Brand, Corey Maggette, Andre Miller and Lamar Odom
are eligible for long-term contracts until the NBA's Oct. 31
deadline.</TE>
<TE>   Michael Olowokandi agreed to take the team's one-season qualifying
offer of $6.1 million last month and will be an unrestricted free
agent next summer.</TE>
<TE>   Depending on the day and the person asking the questions,
Olowokandi is either content to prove his status as a so-called
"max-out" contract player next summer or frustrated beyond hope.
He'll either listen to the Clippers' offer or sign with another team
even if it's for less.</TE>
<TE>   Brand, the Clippers' resident optimist and their leading scorer
and rebounder last season, isn't concerned.</TE>
<TE>   "A great season and a winning record is going to work well for
everyone," said Brand, who averaged 18.2 points and 11.6 rebounds
last season. "I think we all understand that.... Players are judged
by stats. Coaches are judged by wins."</TE>
<TE>   He hopes the team doesn't let contract concerns get in the way of
a standout season.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm excited to play with my team now," he said. "I really can't
wait to get the season started. I think we'll do some great things.
There's not a weakness out there. Well, there's not too many
weaknesses."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>No. 1 Miami couldn't be any more ready for rival Florida State.</LD>
<LD>   Ken Dorsey threw three touchdown passes, Willis McGahee ran for
107 yards and three scores and the Hurricanes dominated Connecticut,
48-14, Saturday night at Miami to extend the nation's longest winning
streak to 27 games.</LD>
<LD>   Next up: No. 11 Florida State--the team the Hurricanes call their
annual "measuring stick." Miami has won two in a row in the series,
and after losing to Louisville and struggling against Iowa State and
Clemson, the real question is: Are the Seminoles ready for the
Hurricanes?</LD>
<TE>   Miami (5-0) scored on five of its six first-half possessions and
added a defensive touchdown. Then they took the opening kickoff of
the second half 86 yards for another score and a 48-0 lead over the
overmatched Huskies (2-4).</TE>
<TE>   Dorsey completed 19 of 26 passes for 216 yards. The three
touchdown passes gave him 14 this season and 79 for his career. He
also threw his fifth interception, the lone time the offense stalled
in the first half.</TE>
<TE>   McGahee logged his fourth consecutive 100-yard game on only 11
carries. He scored on Miami's first three possessions.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Pittsburgh defense gave up only 39 yards in the first half and
Brandon Miree scored twice as the Panthers (5-1, 2-0) rolled to a
48-24 victory over Syracuse (1-4, 0-1) at Syracuse, N.Y., to end an
11-game losing streak against the Orangemen. It was the fourth
consecutive victory for Pitt and its first in the Carrier Dome in 20
years.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   ATLANTIC COAST</TE>
<TE>   Tarence Williams scored on a 10-yard run with 5:29 left to lead
Wake Forest (3-3, 1-2) to a 24-21 upset over Georgia Tech (4-2, 2-1)
at Atlanta. Williams, a senior running back who gained more than
1,000 yards last season, rushed 19 times for a season-high 99
yards.... Freshman reserve Josh Allen rushed for 116 yards and two
touchdowns, helping Maryland (4-2) to a 28-point first quarter on its
way to a 48-17 victory over West Virginia (3-2) at Morgantown, W.Va.
The bright spot for West Virginia was Avon Cobourne, who rushed 30
times for 123 yards, setting a school record with his 22nd 100-yard
game.... Matt Schaub completed 27 of 45 passes for 315 yards and one
touchdown to compensate for Virginia's poor ground game as the
Cavaliers (4-2, 2-1) held on for a 27-22 victory over Duke (2-4, 0-2)
at Durham, N.C.</TE>

Losman passed for 300 yards and four touchdowns to lead visiting
Tulane (3-3) to a 52-9 over Louisiana Monroe (0-5). Losman threw

Davis in the third quarter to give Tulane a 38-9 lead.</TE>

<TE>   MID-AMERICAN</TE>
<TE>   Josh Harris threw four touchdowns and ran for two more as Bowling
Green (4-0, 1-0) had an easy time in a 72-21 rout of Ohio (1-5, 1-1)
at Bowling Green, Ohio. Harris completed 19 of 24 passes for 292
yards with touchdown passes of 29, 11, 20 and 28 yards.... Byron
Leftwich overcame two early interceptions and threw four touchdown
passes, leading Marshall (3-1, 2-0) to a 42-21 victory over Kent
State (2-4, 0-3) at Kent, Ohio. Leftwich completed 31 of 45 passes
for 377 yards. Marshall outgained Kent State, 645-407.... Quarterback
Joel Sambursky threw a six-yard touchdown pass to Brandon Robinson as
time expired to give Southern Illinois (3-3) a 54-52 victory over
Western Illinois (4-1) at Carbondale, Ill. Southern Illinois running
back Mo Abdulqaadir ran for four touchdowns and 261 yards in 31
carries a week after rushing for a school-record 312 yards....

<LD>Say this about the budding rivalry between Texas Tech and Texas A&amp;M,
and then say no more: Even the kickers were taking potshots at each
other after Saturday's game, the latest chapter in the suddenly
acrimonious in-state free-for-all.</LD>
<LD>   The teams combined for 12 touchdown passes, 1,061 yards and, most
important, two missed extra points--both by Texas A&amp;M--in Texas
Tech's 48-47 overtime victory at College Station.</LD>
<LD>   The team that refused to acknowledge Texas Tech as a worthy
opponent earlier in the week--"It's not Texas, so I don't see it as a
rivalry.... It's just another game on the schedule," said Texas A&amp;M
receiver Jamaar Taylor--has now lost six of its last eight against
the Red Raiders.</LD>
<TE>   This one was particularly embarrassing for the Aggies, who let
Texas Tech overcome an 18-point third-quarter deficit and gave Red
Raider fans the last chuckle in a yearlong battle of insults.</TE>
<TE>   The animosity began last year when Texas Tech fans celebrated a
12-0 victory by jamming a goalpost into the stands near a group of
Aggie fans, sparking a brawl.</TE>
<TE>   Texas A&amp;M fired back with a story in its media guide that called
Red Raider fans "uglier than the barren stretch of dirt some West
Texans call a city," a not-so-subtle shot at Lubbock, where Texas
Tech is located.</TE>
<TE>   Fast-forward to Saturday, where Texas A&amp;M scored first in the
overtime, but John Pierson missed the extra point--his second miss of
the game--to leave the door open for the Red Raiders.</TE>
<TE>   Texas Tech's Kliff Kingsbury completed 49 of 59 passes for 474
yards and five touchdowns, including a 10-yard touchdown to Nehemiah
Glover on the Red Raiders' overtime possession.</TE>
<TE>   Most important, Robert Treece made the crucial extra point.</TE>
<TE>   "In my head, I like to think extra points are guaranteed," Treece
said. "High school kids and junior high kids make them all the time.
There's no greater feeling than helping your team, especially over
the Aggies."</TE>
<TE>   Said Pierson, the less fortunate kicker: "It was my fault.... I
guarantee you it'll never happen again."</TE>
<TE>   The loss wiped out a record-setting day for quarterback Dustin
Long, who began the season as Texas A&amp;M's No. 2 quarterback, but set
a Big 12 record with seven touchdown passes Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   Said Long: "The bottom line is that we didn't get it done."</TE>
<TE>   Somebody Save Us</TE>
<TE>   Nebraska fans had one thought in common after last week's debacle
against Iowa State: Lord help us.</TE>
<TE>   So he did.</TE>
<TE>   Jammal Lord, Nebraska's embattled quarterback, set school records
for total offense and rushing yards by a quarterback in Nebraska's
38-14 victory over Division I-AA McNeese State.</TE>
<TE>   Lord, who had to win back his starting position during practice
last week, had 218 yards rushing and three touchdowns, breaking the
Nebraska single-game quarterback rushing mark of 199 yards set by
Tommie Frazier in 1996. Lord also threw for 151 yards and a
touchdown, and his 369 total yards topped Eric Crouch's record of 360
set last year against Colorado.</TE>
<TE>   Lord, who didn't speak to the media in the days leading up to the
game, continued his silence Saturday, although other people were
willing to talk.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody in the state, everybody in the country had been
doubting him," Nebraska tight end Jon Bowling said. "Very few thought
he could get it done."</TE>
<TE>   It was a stormy few days for McNeese State, which was forced to
leave St. Charles, La., two days earlier than planned because of
worries that Hurricane Lili could make traveling difficult.</TE>
<TE>   The extra motel nights and earlier airplane departure cost the
Cowboys about $40,000. Then they went out and got pasted by Nebraska.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a tough day for the Cowboys," McNeese State Coach Tommy
Tate said.</TE>
<TE>   Macho, Macho Men</TE>
<TE>   OK, so maybe Georgia is manly enough.</TE>
<TE>   The Bulldogs, angered by comments from former Auburn Coach Pat Dye
that they were "not man enough" to beat Alabama, won the Southeastern
Conference showdown, 27-25, on a last-minute field goal by Billy
Bennett.</TE>
<TE>   Dye fanned the flames of controversy earlier in the week during a
radio interview in Birmingham, Ala., ripping the Bulldogs and then
repeating his thoughts twice when prodded by the show's host.</TE>
<TE>   "Alabama is gonna line up and run the football and they're gonna
play defense and I don't believe Georgia is man enough to beat that,"
said Dye, who, believe it or not, was a two-time All-American
offensive lineman at Georgia.</TE>
<TE>   All the Bulldogs did was keep alive a shot at their first SEC
title in 20 years, outrushing the conference's top running team
161-109.</TE>
<TE>   "What he said helped motivate us some," Georgia Coach Mark Richt
said of Dye's remarks. "It does help a little bit when you're tired
[in the fourth quarter] and want to quit and your manhood's
questioned."</TE>
<TE>   How's Roy Hobbs this week?</TE>
<TE>   In a jab at Kansas State Coach Bill Snyder, the Colorado sports
information folks withheld injury updates from their weekly notes
because Snyder is notorious for hiding his players' injuries.</TE>
<TE>   The Buffaloes' injury report this week included fictitious
injuries from familiar movies.</TE>
<TE>   Vito Corleone of "Godfather" fame was listed with injuries
suffered from "five gunshot wounds," his recovery time estimated at
"2-3 months."</TE>
<TE>   Eric "Otter" Stratton, Tim Matheson's character in "Animal House,"
was listed with assorted bruises--he "survived the toga party
uninjured, but was roughed up by Neidermeyer."</TE>
<TE>   Even the Black Knight from "Monty Python and the Holy Grail" made
the injury list, with "multiple amputations" and a reference to "a
mere flesh wound."</TE>
<TE>   Whatever works: Colorado defeated Kansas State, 35-31.</TE>
<TE>   Somebody Call Bill Walsh</TE>
<TE>   Brown receiver Chas Gessner caught 24 passes and tied Jerry Rice's
single-game reception record in a 38-28 loss to Rhode Island.</TE>
<TE>   Gessner, who leads the nation in receptions and receiving yards,
made 14 catches in the first half and finished with 207 yards and two
touchdowns.</TE>
<TE>   Rice caught 24 passes for Mississippi Valley State against
Southern on Oct. 1, 1983.</TE>
<TE>   Louisiana Frightening</TE>
<TE>   Maybe they should wait another 64 years before rescheduling this
one.</TE>
<TE>   Louisiana State easily handled Louisiana Lafayette, 48-0, holding
the Ragin' Cajuns to 17 yards rushing and 53 yards passing.</TE>
<TE>   Louisiana Lafayette has been outscored 542-0 in the last 10
meetings with LSU. The last time they played was 1938.</TE>
<TE>   "We just did not execute like we should," Lafayette quarterback
Jon Van Cleave said.</TE>
<TE>   The victory came with a price for Louisiana State: Running back
LaBrandon Toefield broke his left arm in the first quarter and may be
lost for the rest of the season.</TE>
<TE>   Withholding Comment</TE>
<TE>   When you lose the way Syracuse did--48-24 against Pittsburgh--it's
a struggle to come up with positives.</TE>
<TE>   Syracuse Coach Paul Pasqualoni tried ... sort of.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously, we were excited about the way it started. We tipped
the first pass," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Pasqualoni deflected several questions about his team's
performance, one of the most humiliating defeats in his 12 seasons at
Syracuse. The Panthers won in the Carrier Dome for the first time in
20 years.</TE>
<TE>   Said Pasqualoni: "I have to watch the film after such a
disappointing game before I make critical comments."</TE>

<TE>   Passing Grades</TE>
<TE>   It was no surprise that Texas Tech quarterback Kliff Kingsbury put
up big passing numbers Saturday against Texas A&amp;M. What was
surprising was the passing performance by Texas A&amp;M's Dustin Long,
who began the season competing for a backup quarterback job and was
firmly entrenched as the starter after a change in offensive
coordinators two weeks ago. Long's seven touchdown passes in Texas
A&amp;M's 48-47 overtime loss to Texas Tech set a Big 12 record that had
been established the previous week by Kingsbury. A look at
Kingsbury's passing statistics in Texas Tech's first five games and
Saturday and those by Texas A&amp;M quarterbacks in the first four games
and by Long Saturday:</TE>

<TE>   It's a two-sport parlay reminiscent of Bo Jackson and Deion
Sanders with one important difference: Neither Jackson nor Sanders
ever faced the kind of sacrifice Bloom was forced to make this
summer.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, Bloom was a high school grad who put his football
scholarship on hold to pursue an unlikely berth on the U.S. Olympic
team as a moguls skier. He made it, and came in ninth in Salt Lake.
Then he ripped through the World Cup season, finishing as champion,
the top-ranked moguls man in the world.</TE>
<TE>   The spoils, such as they are for skiing, were there for Bloom's
taking. But he also was ready to return to his first love: playing
football for the Buffaloes. That's where Bloom ran afoul of the NCAA.</TE>
<TE>   Among the organization's many bylaws governing amateurism is one
which says you can be a professional in one sport and an amateur in
another, but you cannot earn anything more than salary as a pro.
Endorsements are taboo.</TE>
<TE>   In real life, that means Serena Williams could go to college to
play basketball, continue as a tennis pro and win $900,000 at the
U.S. Open. But she would not be able to hold up her brand-name racket
and say, "This is what brought me the title."</TE>
<TE>   Bloom went to court. Although the judge chastised the NCAA for
inflexibility, he agreed with its stance. If Bloom wanted to play
football, the endorsements had to go.</TE>
<TE>   "When the decision came down," Bloom said, "it was like a ton of
bricks."</TE>
<TE>   Endorsements are manna in skiing, where there are no salaries.
National teams pick up travel costs and training expenses but top
skiers otherwise support themselves with sponsorships. With his
sudden success and matinee-idol potential, Bloom had deals signed or
pending with Tommy Hilfiger, Oakley, Under Armour, Nike, Dynastar,
MTV and Nickelodeon. Bloom's agent, Andy Carroll, estimates the total
package as "easily hundreds of thousands of dollars."</TE>
<TE>   Tough choice?</TE>
<TE>   Not really.</TE>
<TE>   "College football was something I dreamed about my whole life,"
said Bloom, raised as a gridiron runt in Loveland, Colo.</TE>
<TE>   "He hadn't grown up being an MTV person and a model, that's not
who he is. That's what he had a chance to be," Colorado Coach Gary
Barnett said. "He's a product of 19 years of growing up and being on
teams and being in a community and state where football is important
and loving that sport as much as he did anything else. You just don't
walk away from that, especially Jeremy."</TE>
<TE>   Bloom's lawyers filed a motion to reconsider. But Bloom was bound
for Boulder and two-a-days. After a year away from the game, his
impact has been startling.</TE>
<TE>   A wide receiver/punt returner, the 5-9, 165-pound freshman scored
touchdowns on a 59-yard punt return and a 65-yard reception in
Colorado's intrasquad scrimmage. In the season opener against
archrival Colorado State, he was third on the depth chart, but
Barnett played a hunch and inserted Bloom in the fourth quarter. On
the first punt he handled as a collegian, Bloom reeled off an
electrifying, 75-yard return for a touchdown.</TE>
<TE>   He returned two the next week for a total of 36 yards against San
Diego State but broke a toe and missed the game against Southern Cal.
He played in last week's victory over UCLA, but the Bruins kicked
away from him all day.</TE>
<TE>   Barnett says Bloom has paid dividends in the locker room, too.</TE>
<TE>   "I told my players repeatedly: How many times have you had a
chance to be around a world champion?" Barnett said. "You have a
chance to get inside a guy's head about what he thinks about before
he goes out and does what he does better than anybody else in the
world. ... Pick his brain."</TE>
<TE>   What Bloom thinks now is that he'll finish the semester and the
season at Colorado, then take correspondence classes and return to
the slopes for the rest of the World Cup. He hasn't figured out yet
how he'll finance that. A call to the NCAA is in the offing. Then
it's back to Boulder for summer camp.</TE>
<TE>   He says graduating is important. So are the 2006 Winter Olympics.
He doesn't know how long he'll play football, or how long he can
afford to be less than a full-time skier. He doesn't know whether
he'll ever get the endorsements back. But he'll juggle as long as
possible ... unless frustration gets him first.</TE>
<TE>   It surfaces every time fans ask about skiing, and say they would
have gone for the money. It surfaces when a national magazine coming
to do a photo shoot of Bloom inside Folsom Field gives up because the
crew can't find a spot that doesn't have some corporate logo in the
background. It surfaces when he pulls on his Nike uniform and drinks
from the Gatorade cooler on the sidelines.</TE>
<TE>   It surfaces especially hard when Bloom picks up his football
helmet.</TE>
<TE>   Look closely at the front. The shield is made by Oakley. Bloom has
represented the sunglasses maker since he was 12. Until the ruling in
August, that is. The firm's name appears twice on his helmet. Bloom
still is endorsing, after all.</TE>
<TE>   He laughs mirthlessly. But it's OK. He has his revenge.</TE>
<TE>   The NCAA sticker on the back of every college football player's
helmet? Bloom took his off.</TE>

<HD>Sweep by Cardinals Dedicated to Kile</HD>
<DH>National League: After beating Arizona, 6-3, to eliminate
the defending champions, they remember late pitcher.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>ST. LOUIS</DL>
<LD>As the St. Louis Cardinals ran onto the field to celebrate their
three-game sweep of the Arizona Diamondbacks in the National League
division series, Matt Morris remembered to carry the No. 57 jersey of
Darryl Kile.</LD>
<LD>   "We did it for D.K.," Miguel Cairo said. "I know in our hearts he
was here."</LD>
<LD>   After getting past Randy Johnson and Curt Schilling, St. Louis
quickly and emotionally finished off the defending World Series
champions.</LD>
<TE>   Cairo, starting in place of injured Scott Rolen, drove in two runs
and scored twice as the Cardinals beat the Diamondbacks, 6-3,
Saturday night.</TE>
<TE>   Kile, a former 20-game winner, died in June, four days after
longtime Cardinal broadcaster Jack Buck.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes it's hard," Cairo said, "but we're going to keep going,
we're going to keep going to work for him."</TE>
<TE>   The Cardinals had inspired play down the stretch, winning 21 of
their last 25 in the regular season, and advanced to the National
League championship series for the second time in three years.</TE>
<TE>   "I wasn't trying to put pressure on myself," Cairo said. "I was
just trying to take it like a regular game, relax and have fun. It
was an excellent approach."</TE>
<TE>   It was typical for the Cardinals, who kept adjusting en route to
the NL Central title. They were forced to use 14 starting pitchers
and 26 overall.</TE>
<TE>   Now they've advanced to the NLCS, against the Atlanta Braves or
San Francisco Giants starting Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   "We really wanted to try to win it and get some rest before the
next round," leadoff hitter Fernando Vina said. "We didn't want to
face Randy and Curt, we wanted to get it over with."</TE>
<TE>   There's no telling when Rolen will return.</TE>
<TE>   The All-Star third baseman sprained his left shoulder in Game 2,
which Cairo won with an RBI single.</TE>
<TE>   The Diamondbacks, who won the World Series in record speed--it
took them only four years--lost their crown in just three games.</TE>
<TE>   Minus injured star Luis Gonzalez, who separated his shoulder in
the final week of the regular season at Busch Stadium, Arizona
totaled only six runs and 18 hits in the series against St. Louis,
the team it defeated in five games in the first round last year.</TE>
<TE>   The Diamondbacks batted only .184.</TE>
<TE>   "Our bats were silent an awful lot," said David Dellucci, who hit
a two-run homer in the second inning. "That's something this team's
not used to. But you have to look at the people they had on the
mound."</TE>
<TE>   The Diamondbacks also missed Craig Counsell and Danny Bautista,
two more injured players.</TE>
<TE>   "It puts a strain on the offense," Manager Bob Brenly said. "It
gives the opposition the opportunity to pitch around the hitters they
think can hurt them the most. It started to show up at the end of the
season, and really here in the playoffs."</TE>
<TE>   The Cardinals have swept their way into the NLCS three times since
baseball expanded its playoffs in 1995, also taking the Braves in
three straight in 2000 and the Padres in 1996.</TE>
<TE>   Counting the regular season, the Cardinals have beaten the
Diamondbacks seven consecutive times, including a victory over
Johnson in Game 1.</TE>
<TE>   Schilling started Game 2, and St. Louis won after he departed.</TE>
<TE>   Cairo tacked on a run-scoring double in the eighth as the
Cardinals scored twice off Byung-Hyun Kim.</TE>
<TE>   Pinch-hitter Kerry Robinson added a run-scoring single in the
eighth.</TE>
<TE>   Pitcher Andy Benes squeezed home the go-ahead run for St. Louis.
Albert Pujols drove in a run and saved a run with his second outfield
assist to highlight this victory.</TE>
<TE>   Pujols saved a 4-3 lead in the fifth when he threw out Chris
Donnels at the plate from left field on Steve Finley's two-out hit.</TE>
<TE>   Manager Tony La Russa started Pujols, who led the team with 127
runs batted in during the regular season, in left field instead of at
third base to allow him to concentrate more on hitting.</TE>
<TE>   Cairo had an RBI single in the second off Miguel Batista.</TE>
<TE>   The St. Louis bullpen overcame a wild outing from Benes, who got
the start in Game 3 in place of injured Woody Williams.</TE>
<TE>   Benes walked four and gave up two homers, Dellucci's two-run shot
in the second and a solo drive in the fifth by Rod Barajas that cut
the Diamondbacks' deficit to 4-3.</TE>
<TE>   The homers were the only hits allowed in 4 2/3 innings by Benes,
who entered with a string of 17 consecutive scoreless innings.</TE>
<TE>   Benes' biggest contribution was a squeeze bunt in the fourth that
put the Cardinals ahead, 3-2.</TE>

<HD>Return of Durazo Is Not Much Help</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Wire Reports</BD>
<DL>ST. LOUIS</DL>
<LD>There was talk in Arizona of sending out a search party to find
once-promising slugger Erubiel Durazo, who did not appear in the
first two games of the National League division series even though
the Diamondbacks were desperate for offensive punch.</LD>
<LD>   Durazo finally showed up as the No. 5 hitter in the Diamondbacks'
lineup Saturday night for Game 3.</LD>
<LD>   The whisper around Bank One Ballpark was that Durazo was locked in
Manager Bob Brenly's doghouse after refusing to play the outfield
late in the season.</LD>
<TE>   He prefers to play first base, which is where he was Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   Brenly reiterated that the decision to sit Durazo in the first two
games was strategic, not vindictive.</TE>
<TE>   "As I said before Game 1, we were anticipating low-scoring
ballgames with runs at a premium and defense at a premium," Brenly
said.</TE>
<TE>   "We decided to go with Mark Grace, our best defender. Game 2
against Chuck Finley, we went with our lefty-killer Greg Colbrunn.
[Now] is Erubiel Durazo's turn."</TE>
<TE>   Durazo didn't take advantage, going hitless in four at-bats.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Cardinal Manager Tony La Russa continued to express hope that
injured third baseman Scott Rolen will bounce back quickly from the
shoulder sprain he suffered in Game 2.</TE>
<TE>   "I asked him if he needed help taking his shirt off," La Russa
said. "He said no, he was all right, so I think it's just a case of
hang with it and wait a few days and see how he feels."</TE>
<TE>   The official timetable is 10 to 14 days, but there is no way of
knowing how long it will take for Rolen to overcome the injury he
suffered when baserunner Alex Cintron slammed into him. It's unlikely
he will play in the National League championship series, but he might
be sound in time to play in the World Series, if the Cardinals get
there.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Diamondback pitcher Miguel Batista is a sensitive guy who has a
way with words. He has a book of Spanish poetry in print in the
United States and his native Dominican Republic, with the proceeds
benefiting the Diamondbacks Charities and the Miguel Batista
Foundation.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Carole Buck, widow of longtime Cardinals' broadcaster Jack Buck,
threw out the ceremonial first pitch.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Fernando Vina was two for four Saturday and went nine for 15 in
the series for the Cardinals after a subpar .270 average in the
regular season.</TE>
<TE>   "You always want to be confident," Vina said. "As a leadoff hitter
the weight is on your shoulders to try to get something going for the
ballclub."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Miguel Batista was 8-9 with a 4.29 earned-run average during the
regular season, a decided step down from Randy Johnson (24-5) and
Curt Schilling (23-7). But Brenly never considered using Johnson on
three days' rest, reasoning someone other than his big two would have
to beat the Cardinals for the Diamondbacks to advance.</TE>
<TE>   "The Cardinals just had a great approach," Brenly said. "They
stayed disciplined and used short, contact swings."</TE>

<HD>He's Pushing It</HD>
<DH>Moss wasn't suspended for traffic incident, the latest
problem for talented receiver</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SAM FARMER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The TV cameras were rolling last month as Randy Moss walked through
the lobby of the Hennepin County Adult Detention Center in
Minneapolis. Several reporters waited outside in the drizzle, and,
even through the thick glass windows, they could hear the Minnesota
Viking receiver whistling a tune. He popped open an exit door and the
throng was there to greet him.</LD>
<LD>   "Randy, can you fill us in on what happened?" a reporter shouted.</LD>
<LD>   "No. You'll hear about it later."</LD>
<TE>   "What can you tell us?" asked another.</TE>
<TE>   "What you already know."</TE>
<TE>   More prodding. Moss grew increasingly agitated.</TE>
<TE>   "You're going to hear my side later.... When I feel like talking,
that's when later's going to be."</TE>
<TE>   He said he was "treated bad" during his night in jail, that it was
all a misunderstanding, that he was confused a day earlier when he
allegedly used his 2002 Lexus to push a traffic-control agent a
half-block when she tried to stop him from making an illegal turn. He
didn't want to talk about the incident now, though, not three steps
out of jail. A reporter persisted.</TE>
<TE>   "Was it a wrong turn ..."</TE>
<TE>   "What'd I just tell you, woman?" Moss snapped. "I'm not getting
into that."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Whistling? Yes. Carefree? Hardly.</TE>
<TE>   The pressure is building on Moss, and the 25-year-old receiver is
at a troubling crossroads. He faces two misdemeanor charges for his
traffic transgressions, and one count of drug possession after police
found a small amount of marijuana in his car. Although the drug
charge carries a maximum $200 fine, it could wind up costing Moss a
lot more. He reportedly failed an NFL drug test last year, and a
second such violation might lead to suspension.</TE>
<TE>   His public image is in tatters, and his team isn't doing much
better. The Vikings are 0-4 for the first time since 1967, and
first-year Coach Mike Tice is desperately trying to halt the free
fall, against the backdrop of published reports that the team is on
the verge of being sold. Two Minnesota groups are the leading
candidates; one is headed by Timberwolves' owner Glen Taylor.</TE>
<TE>   Mercifully, this the Vikings' week off.</TE>
<TE>   It was Tice who came up with the idea of the "Randy Ratio," having
quarterback Daunte Culpepper throw to Moss at least 40% of the time.
Instead of producing spectacular pass plays, the Culpepper-Moss
pairing has been a spectacle, with the two screaming at each other on
the sideline.</TE>
<TE>   "The word is already out that I'm a demon," Moss said in a tearful
interview with ESPN's Andrea Kremer, granted after his arrest.
"Before that, I was just a bad guy. I'm just ... attitude, this and
that. Now, I'm reckless and a demon. My head is already chopped off."</TE>
<TE>   Often, it seems, Moss acts as if he had no head in the first
place. Despite his tremendous physical ability and a record-breaking
college career at Division I-AA Marshall, he fell to the 21st pick in
the 1998 draft because of character questions.</TE>
<TE>   He first ran afoul of the law in 1995, during his senior year at
DuPont High in Rand, W.Va., when he pleaded guilty to two counts of
battery and was sentenced to 30 days in jail for kicking another
student. Sixty days were tacked onto Moss' sentence after he tested
positive for marijuana during his first week in jail.</TE>
<TE>   Not only did those convictions cost Moss scholarship offers to
Notre Dame and Florida State, they scared off plenty of NFL scouts
who saw him as enormously talented but far too much of a risk. The
Vikings gave him a chance, and he made them look brilliant. As a
rookie, he was the NFL's most dominant receiver, catching 69 passes
for 1,313 yards with 17 touchdowns.</TE>
<TE>   His numbers improved in 1999 and 2000 as he ascended to stardom
and took his place among the greatest receivers in NFL history. There
were embarrassing episodes--squirting a water bottle at an official;
bickering with fellow receiver Cris Carter; berating Viking corporate
sponsors who joined the team on a trip and demanding those
benefactors move to the back of the airport bus--but nothing that
team officials couldn't stomach.</TE>
<TE>   Moss was seldom scolded, often rewarded. Before last season, the
Vikings signed him to an eight-year deal worth $75 million. Months
later, he drew the ire of many in the sports world--not only the
NFL--when he said he truly plays only when he wants to play.</TE>
<TE>   "That's an insult to all professional athletes," said Pat Croce,
former owner of the Philadelphia 76ers. "It's an insult to all
athletes. When you're getting paid to play, you don't have the
determination of playing when you want to or not. That's your job.
It's an insult to the fans, who want to pay to watch, whether it be
on TV or in person. When someone says, 'I play when I want to play,'
that insults our intelligence."</TE>
<TE>   That said, Croce added that it's important that the Vikings stand
by Moss, as they have. Croce steadfastly stood alongside All-Star
guard Allen Iverson throughout all the player's legal problems.</TE>
<TE>   "One of the things that Allen and I had was a relationship, and
not owner-player," he said. "He felt like I was real, because when
times were good--when he won a scoring title, or rookie of the year,
or a big game--I was there. But I was also there for him in the bad
times. I was responsible for suspending him in Boston. I was
responsible for suspending him in Miami. But when he got thrown in
jail, when he got in trouble for the gun and the pot in the car
during his second year, I was the one who went to his hearing. He saw
me in court."</TE>
<TE>   Tice has been unwavering in his support of Moss and was criticized
by many people when he opted not to suspend him after the traffic
incident, even for one game.</TE>
<TE>   Moss has another supporter in Michael Irvin, a former All-Pro
receiver for the Dallas Cowboys. He thinks of Moss as a kindred
spirit. They both rose to stardom from underprivileged backgrounds,
both ran afoul of the law from time to time, both have known the
harsh light of media scrutiny. Irvin even defends the
I-play-when-I-want-to-play mentality.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody in the NFL takes a play off now and again," said Irvin,
now a fixture on Fox's "Best Damn Sports Show Period."</TE>
<TE>   "You've got a four-quarter game. If I know I'm not getting the
ball on this play, why should I sprint down there? I've got to
conserve my energy."</TE>
<TE>   Irvin, who has embraced Christianity since his playing days,
reached out to Moss with a supportive phone call after learning of
his most recent troubles.</TE>
<TE>   "I think this whole thing has been blown out of proportion," Irvin
said, referring to Moss' traffic arrest. "I can imagine that lady
telling Randy, 'You can't turn this way.' Randy hears that like it's
somebody challenging him. All he knows is to try to beat a challenge.</TE>
<TE>   "Then, when he's sitting there in jail he's thinking, 'Why did I
do this? Oh, forget them all. I'm not bowing down, I'm not giving in.
I'm OK. I made it this far.' "</TE>
<TE>   A day after being released from jail, Moss stood at a lectern and
gave a rambling, nine-minute address. He said his public image had
been "shattered" by the arrest, and apologized to the Vikings, their
fans, even fellow Nike pitchman Michael Jordan.</TE>
<TE>   But Moss did not apologize to Amy E. Zaccardi, the traffic-control
agent who wound up on his hood, then was slightly injured falling to
the pavement.</TE>
<TE>   "What we're really lacking here is a sense of maturity," said Dr.
Martha Ewing, interim director of the Institute for the Study of
Youth Sports. "We're sending a very mixed message to kids. If you're
not very good at sports, you've got to be good at interpersonal
skills, have good character, good sportsmanship, because, boy, we
value those things. If you're an elite player, to heck with it."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Moss snapped at the reporter, and the videotape kept rolling. At 6
feet 4, he was significantly taller than the throng. He gave a few
more clipped answers and scanned the street for his ride.</TE>
<TE>   Nearby, a fan shouted some words of support and offered him a
ride. Moss gladly accepted, relieved to rid himself of the reporters.
He lifted the collar of his windbreaker over his head and walked into
the drizzle, proclaiming his newfound friend "a true citizen."</TE>
<TE>   Moss didn't need the lift after all. Within moments, a black
Mercedes-Benz with darkened windows arrived. Two well-dressed men got
out--his legal team?--and offered him the front seat.</TE>
<TE>   Practice had started and he was running late.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   (BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX)</TE>
<TE>   LESS WAS MORE</TE>
<TE>   The Vikings might have underestimated Cris Carter's value. Randy
Moss caught 308 passes for 5,396 yards in 64 games in his first four
seasons when teamed with Carter. This season, Moss has 27 receptions
in four games but his yardage and touchdowns per game are lower than
previous seasons.</TE>

<HD>Bad Teams (Bengals, Vikings) Abound</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVE GOLDBERG</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dave Lapham was a guard for Cincinnati when the Bengals were a
legitimate NFL team in the 1970s and early '80s.</LD>
<LD>   Now a broadcaster, he's seeing and hearing firsthand just how bad
the team is.</LD>
<LD>   On Sunday, he heard Tampa Bay assistants in an adjoining booth
laughing at the Bengals' ineptitude and said he's heard the same
during games with San Diego and Atlanta.</LD>
<TE>   "They were shaking their heads, smiling, laughing," Lapham said.
"It was unbelievable. I've seen it more than once this year. They're
in the booth making fun of everything."</TE>
<TE>   The Bengals are 0-4 and have been outscored 119-23, even poorer
than usual for a team that has the worst record in the NFL for more
than a decade.</TE>
<TE>   Yet Gil Brandt reported on NFL.com this week that they're the only
team with three quarterbacks on the roster each being paid more than
$1 million this year. Gus Frerotte, Jon Kitna and Akili Smith have a
combined quarterback rating of 44.3, awful by any standard.</TE>
<TE>   They're not the only horrid team. The caliber of football this
year has been exciting. But it's also been bad all over the NFL.</TE>
<TE>   The two prime-time games last week are prime examples of the low
level of play.</TE>
<TE>   Minnesota managed to allow 45 points in the first half to a
Seattle team that had scored just 36 in total in its first three
games.</TE>
<TE>   Denver, which started 3-0, was dreadful in Baltimore, allowing,
among other things, Chris McAlister's 107-yard missed field goal
return on the final play of the Ravens' 31-point second quarter.</TE>
<TE>   The Broncos should bounce back, the Vikings probably won't.</TE>
<TE>   There are other sorry examples beyond the Bungles:</TE>
<TE>   * New York Jets (1-3). In hindsight, the opening week overtime win
in Buffalo was a fluke. Without Chad Morton's two kickoff returns for
touchdowns, they'd be 0-4. They were supposed to challenge for the
AFC East title. Instead, they've been outscored 102-13 by New
England, Miami and Jacksonville; Vinny Testaverde is out at
quarterback; and the supposedly upgraded defense is the second worst
in the NFL statistically.</TE>
<TE>   * St. Louis (0-4). The problem goes beyond Kurt Warner's broken
pinkie. Warner was a standing target because of a gaping hole at
right tackle, compounded when All-Pro left tackle Orlando Pace went
down with a torn calf muscle.</TE>
<TE>   Even before the injuries, opponents were more aggressive
defensively because the loss of Az-Zahir Hakim to Detroit via free
agency and the offensive line problems negated the deep threat.</TE>
<TE>   * Minnesota (0-4). Why does everyone think the Vikings' slide is a
surprise? In the last two years, Cris Carter and Robert Smith have
retired and Korey Stringer died of heat stroke in training camp in
2001. No team can afford to lose players like that.</TE>
<TE>   The Vikings' defense has always been suspect. Someone suggested
last week that the "leader" of the defense go to Randy Moss and talk
him into behaving. What "leader?" Third-year defensive tackle Chris
Hovan is the senior Viking (and best player) on the unit, but he's
still only 24 years old. The rest of the guys are still getting
introduced.</TE>
<TE>   * Pittsburgh (1-2). The Steelers, sliced and diced by Tom Brady
and Rich Gannon in their first two games, came back from a bye week
with Kordell Stewart on notice that he had to produce or be benched
against Cleveland.</TE>
<TE>   He was benched in the fourth quarter in favor of much-traveled
Tommy Maddox, who led the Steelers to a late touchdown and an
overtime win. Maddox starts this week, but he's probably not the
longterm answer. Stewart has had more bad seasons than good ones, and
the gears on the Bus (Jerome Bettis) seem worn.</TE>
<TE>   There's time to rebound in a weak division, but the Steelers are
weak, too.</TE>
<TE>   * Detroit (1-3). Despite an impressive win over New Orleans, the
Lions are bad.</TE>
<TE>   The good news is that Joey Harrington showed promise last week,
especially on a two-play sequence when he lofted a perfect 40-yard
pass to Hakim, then zinged a perfect 38-yard TD pass to Bill
Schroeder.</TE>
<TE>   * Tennessee (1-3). The Titans allowed two punt returns for
touchdowns last week, the pass defense that was supposed to be fixed
ranks 29th, and Eddie George is averaging 2.9 yards a carry.</TE>
<TE>   * Washington (1-2). No one should question Steve Spurrier's
credentials. But he can't win with Shane Matthews and Danny Wuerffel
at quarterback. The defense is talented but ancient in spots (Bruce
Smith and Darrell Green) and has had trouble learning Marvin Lewis'
complicated schemes. A meddling owner doesn't help.</TE>
<TE>   * Seattle (1-3). More talent than the record shows. Or did Shaun
Alexander have a record-setting game Sunday night because he was
facing Minnesota?</TE>
<TE>   * Houston (1-3). Excused, because it's an expansion team and the
two offensive line bookends, Tony Boselli and Ryan Young, haven't
played yet because of injuries. GM Charley Casserly knew taking
Boselli in the expansion draft was a gamble. So far, he's lost.</TE>

<HD>You Lose, You're Fired</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Half-dozen managers are shown the door after
failing to post winning seasons.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HAL BOCK</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Baseball executives have a hundred different ways of saying the same
thing when they fire managers. The bottom line never changes, though.
Win, and the manager sticks around. Lose, and it's out the door.</LD>
<LD>   A half-dozen of them went down last week, a particularly difficult
stretch for the men who are paid to outthink one another. That pushed
the casualty count for the season to 13, not counting interim John
Mizerock, who bridged Tony Muser and Tony Pena for a couple of days
in Kansas City. In each case, the trap door opened after a losing
record--or sometimes a losing legacy.</LD>
<LD>   The next time Tampa Bay has more wins than losses in a season will
be the first time. So long, Hal McRae.</LD>
<TE>   The Milwaukee Brewers went through the worst season in franchise
history. See you later, Jerry Royster.</TE>
<TE>   Detroit has a lovely ballpark and a lousy ball club. It's been
nice knowing you, Luis Pujols.</TE>
<TE>   The Texas Rangers have finished last three straight times. That
meant the end of the line for Jerry Narron.</TE>
<TE>   The Chicago Cubs haven't been to a World Series since 1945 and
didn't get close this season. Tough luck, Bruce Kimm.</TE>
<TE>   Two years after they were in the World Series, the New York Mets
finished in last place. Have a nice life, Bobby Valentine.</TE>
<TE>   Three of the victims--Pujols, Royster and Kimm--had less than a
season on the job, each plugged in after their teams got off to shaky
starts under other managers. Kimm made a particularly brief cameo
appearance, hired on July 6, fired on Sept. 29.</TE>
<TE>   Does that seem a tad unfair?</TE>
<TE>   Consider McRae's task. Win with an anonymous Devil Rays lineup
devoid of any marquee names. Or Narron's situation, with 17 Texas
players spending 1,429 days on the disabled list.</TE>
<TE>   Sorry, guys. No excuses. It was football's Al Davis who put it
best: "Just win, baby."</TE>
<TE>   In baseball, the accepted code for fired managers is to take the
shot and walk away quietly, waiting for the next opportunity that
invariably comes. In an attack of honesty, Royster chose a different
route, terming the Brewers team he took over "an absolute mess."</TE>
<TE>   And what would you call the Tigers and Devil Rays, who, like
Milwaukee, also lost 106 games?</TE>
<TE>   There was plenty of mess to go around with the Mets. Valentine,
who so often got in hot water because of his mouth, tried to be
diplomatic this time when asked if he thought his dismissal by owner
Fred Wilpon was fair.</TE>
<TE>   "It's fair that I'm not managing the team," he said, probably
biting down hard on his tongue. "Fred wants to base that on
performance."</TE>
<TE>   And the Mets' performance left plenty to be desired.</TE>
<TE>   It should be noted that the Milwaukee mess reached record
proportions. The Brewers and Pittsburgh Pirates are the latest
additions to the list of franchises that have endured at least 10
consecutive losing seasons.</TE>
<TE>   Heading that group are the Philadelphia Phillies, who went from
1918-1948 with just one winning season and had five consecutive
100-plus losing seasons in that stretch.</TE>
<TE>   Talk about a slump.</TE>
<TE>   The Phillies' lone winning season in that stretch was 1932, when
they barely made it at 78-76. In those three decades, the team went
through 16 managers--Hans Lobert had two chances--before they found
the winning combination in 1949 under Eddie Sawyer.</TE>
<TE>   Sawyer's team won the pennant in 1950 but two years later, he was
gone, only to be rehired in 1958. In his second managerial
incarnation, Sawyer lasted through the first game of the 1960 season.
The Phillies lost that day and the manager announced his resignation.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm 49 years old," he said. "I want to live to be 50."</TE>
<TE>   Most managers know when they're cornered by a bad team. They do
the best they can under what are difficult circumstances. It was the
immortal Joe Schultz, manager of the Seattle Pilots of blessed
memory, who sat through a doubleheader blowout one day and was asked
his thoughts about the performance of his expansion team.</TE>
<TE>   Schultz thought for a moment and then offered a comment that,
although probably not original, still captured the essence of every
manager who was ever stuck in a losing situation.</TE>
<TE>   "I managed good," he said, "but they played bad."</TE>

<HD>Rookie Handling NASCAR Pressure Just Fine</HD>
<DH>Auto Racing: With seven races to go, leader Jimmie Johnson
trying to become first first-year driver to win points title.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE HARRIS</AU>
<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL>TALLADEGA, Ala.</DL>
<LD>Jimmie Johnson already has accomplished something no other first-year
driver has done: lead the Winston Cup points standings.</LD>
<LD>   Suddenly, a rookie winning the championship isn't such an
outlandish thought.</LD>
<LD>   Going into today's EA Sports 500 at Talladega Superspeedway,
Johnson is out front in the closest points race in NASCAR history.</LD>
<TE>   The California native, who turned 27 on Sept. 17, is only 11
points ahead of second-place Mark Martin, while Tony Stewart, Jeff
Gordon, Rusty Wallace and fellow rookie Ryan Newman all remain within
striking distance of Johnson with seven races to go. Fifth-place
Sterling Marlin will miss the rest of the season due to injury.</TE>
<TE>   Like everything else thrown at him, Johnson appears to be handling
the added pressure of a title race just fine.</TE>
<TE>   "We've been in the top five since the midway point at least, maybe
even earlier, and have been hanging around the top five all season
long," Johnson said. "That has given us the reality that we might
have a shot at it.</TE>
<TE>   "But ... it's kind of a novelty item to be leading right now.
There are just so many opportunities at Talladega for things to
change and shake up again. It's great to be in the position we're in
but until we get through the superspeedway race [Talladega] and the
short track race [Martinsville], I don't think there's any sense
getting too worked up over it."</TE>
<TE>   It's ovals such as 2.66-mile Talladega and .526-mile
Martinsville--the longest and shortest on the circuit--on which
Johnson has the least experience.</TE>
<TE>   The former off-road racer who mastered the jolting terrain of Baja
is quick to adapt. Johnson simply regards racing at those tracks as a
chance to get some hands-on learning.</TE>
<TE>   "I've gained a lot of confidence in my abilities as a driver and
my abilities to communicate what I feel under the race car," he said.
"But, most importantly, I've learned how important it is to have the
right chemistry with the people that surround you and how important
that is in the level of competition in Winston Cup."</TE>
<TE>   He was hired to drive the No. 48 Chevrolet by four-time Winston
Cup champion Gordon. He knew Johnson would be good, and now Gordon is
enjoying the unexpected situation of having his driver in the
championship hunt.</TE>
<TE>   "I just like the fact that he's got confidence," Gordon said.
"There's an old saying that he 'races like he doesn't know any
better,' that he shouldn't be able to do all that he has accomplished
in the sport this early in his career. That's Jimmie."</TE>
<TE>   Among Johnson's accomplishments in the first 29 races this season
are four poles, three victories--matching the rookie record set in
1999 by Stewart--and 18 top-10 finishes, closing in on Stewart's
record of 21.</TE>
<TE>   There have, of course, been some disappointments. The car broke a
gear at Sonoma in June, and then there was Bristol and Robby Gordon.</TE>
<TE>   In the heat of the moment at the rough and tumble Bristol track,
Johnson lost his cool for the only time this season. He flipped his
middle finger at Robby Gordon, who had hit him on a restart and sent
him into the wall.</TE>
<TE>   "With so much on the line, contending for the championship, my
emotions got the best of me," Johnson said. "It's something I won't
do again in the future--I'm a professional and need to be acting like
a professional, and not out there making obscene gestures."</TE>
<TE>   Now he faces the high banks of Talladega, a place where the
championship can't be won but could be lost.</TE>
<TE>   With horsepower-sapping restrictor plates bunching up the cars on
the big track, it seems as if there's always at least one big
accident, involving a number of cars.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson avoided trouble here in April, finishing seventh.</TE>
<TE>   "When you strap yourself in, you know the odds aren't going to
work in your favor," he said. "One of the times you strap yourself in
there, something's going to happen and you're going to hit something
hard.</TE>
<TE>   "I really try to put some positive energy out there and get the
team to think the same way. We'd like to make sure that that
everybody on the team puts forth some creative thoughts toward us
coming home with all the fenders on the car."</TE>
<TE>   Very little has intimidated Johnson all year, and this dangerous
race isn't going to change his approach.</TE>
<TE>   "You never know what's going to happen at Talladega," Johnson
said. "So we're not really worrying about it too much."</TE>

<LD>These are not good days to be a quarterback in the NFL, Donovan
McNabb's recent $115-million contract notwithstanding. The season's
barely a month old and quarterbacks across the league are getting
pulled and replaced at a pace usually reserved for kickers and major
league managers. Six teams have made changes already, with more
assuredly to come....</LD>
<LD>   CINCINNATI BENGALS</LD>
<LD>   Week 1 starter: Gus Frerotte.</LD>
<TE>   Current starter: Jon Kitna.</TE>
<TE>   Reason for change: The Bengals have a major problem. (Actually,
the Bengals have many major problems, but space here is limited. For
a complete listing, please consult the hard-bound 26-volume
collection, titled "Ickey Forever.") The Bengals have convinced
themselves they have a playoff-caliber roster--Really! There are
on-the-record quotes to this effect--and now at their usual 0-4, they
figure it must be the quarterback's fault. Frerotte lasted less than
three full games, getting pulled after opening a nationally televised
Sunday night game 0 for 7. Akili Smith got the call last week; he
lost, 35-7. Now the Bengals are going back to Kitna, who started 15
games for Cincinnati last season, which is the reason Cincinnati
opened this season with Frerotte in the first place.</TE>
<TE>   What's next: Smith has asked to be traded; smart kid. Cincinnati
is Frerotte's fourth team in five years; now the Bengals know why. So
it's probably Kitna playing out the string, Cincinnati getting the
No. 1 draft choice in the 2003 draft ... and using it on an offensive
tackle.</TE>
<TE>   DETROIT LIONS</TE>
<TE>   Week 1 starter: Mike McMahon.</TE>
<TE>   Current starter: Joey Harrington.</TE>
<TE>   Reason for change: The Lions just finished building a $300-million
stadium and wanted to fill at least half of it for the Sept. 22 grand
opening. McMahon was something of a cult hero in Detroit, actually
winning a couple of games last December and saving the Lions from an
0-16 season, but he started the 2002 season 0-2 and the Lions had
burned the No. 3 pick in the draft and $36 million on Harrington.
McMahon could do the math--another sorry victim of a numbers game.</TE>
<TE>   What's next: Harrington is 1-1 in two starts, completing 20 of 35
passes for 267 yards in last week's victory over New Orleans. Not
surprisingly, the Lions have gone around the bend--consider this
quote from Detroit cornerback Todd Lyght: "He's going to be the
quarterback of the ages here." Which suggests Harrington could be
starting for the Lions for a while. Lucky him.</TE>
<TE>   NEW YORK JETS</TE>
<TE>   Week 1 starter: Vinny Testaverde.</TE>
<TE>   Current starter: Chad Pennington.</TE>
<TE>   Reason for change: Testaverde has been playing on borrowed time
for several seasons while the Jets bought time to develop Pennington,
who has yet to convince many he has been worth the wait. According to
his birth certificate, Testaverde turns 39 next month. Four starts in
September suggested a different number, maybe 47? The Jets won their
opener on two kickoff returns by Chad Morton, are 0-3 since, getting
outscored, 102-13. Pennington mopped up last week's 28-3 loss to
Jacksonville and makes his first NFL start today against Kansas City.</TE>
<TE>   What's next: Testaverde has been through this before, most
recently in 1995, when he was AFC player of the month in September
and backing up Eric Zeier by November. Testaverde remembers asking
his coach then, Bill Belichick, "Why are you making me a scapegoat in
all this?" Belichick told him, "I can't change the left guard and get
a spark. I've got to change the quarterback." So the Jets aren't
changing their left guard this week. The season's long, the Jets are
bad. Testaverde hasn't made his last start.</TE>
<TE>   PITTSBURGH STEELERS</TE>
<TE>   Week 1 starter: Kordell Stewart.</TE>
<TE>   Current starter: Tommy Maddox.</TE>
<TE>   Reason for change: The Steelers were less than 15 minutes away
from an 0-3 start when Coach Bill Cowher pulled Stewart last Sunday
and replaced him with Maddox. Maddox drove the Steelers to their only
touchdown of the day, tied the score and brought on overtime. Then
Maddox threw an interception, Cleveland missed a field goal, Maddox
completed six of his next seven passes, Cleveland blocked a field
goal on second down, Pittsburgh recovered and kicked the winning
field goal on third down. Cowher waffled initially as to who would
start in Week 5, but apparently got tired of watching game film of
Stewart throwing interceptions (15 in his last seven games) and
opposing defenses stacking eight men at the line of scrimmage,
because the Steelers can't run the ball anymore. So Maddox gets the
start today and Stewart's handlers have spent the week reassuring
him, "It's all Jerome Bettis' fault."</TE>
<TE>   What's next: Maddox is forever branded with the three dreaded
scarlet letters: XFL. The New Orleans Saints, as he is about to
discover, are not the Memphis Maniax. Stewart will be back.</TE>
<TE>   ST. LOUIS RAMS</TE>
<TE>   Week 1 starter: Kurt Warner.</TE>
<TE>   Current starter: Jamie Martin.</TE>
<TE>   Reason for change: Dallas defensive back Roy Williams fell on top
of Warner last Sunday, breaking the little finger on Warner's passing
hand. Initial prognosis: Warner out eight to 10 weeks, Rams 0-4 and
over-and-out way before then.</TE>
<TE>   What's next: Martin makes his second NFL start today, at San
Francisco, against the Rams' longtime NFC rivals, who are rumored to
be a bit miffed over having lost their last six games to the Rams.
Next week, Martin gets the Oakland Raiders. Having inspected the
schedule, Warner predicts he'll be back within five weeks.</TE>
<TE>   WASHINGTON REDSKINS</TE>
<TE>   Week 1 starter: Shane Matthews.</TE>
<TE>   Current starter: Danny Wuerffel.</TE>
<TE>   Reason for change: Last off-season, the Redskins hired a new coach
named Steve Spurrier. He does these things.</TE>
<TE>   What's next: With Spurrier, who can tell? Worth noting: He has a
third quarterback on the roster, rookie Patrick Ramsey. Some time
this season, Spurrier will start him. If Spurrier had a fourth and a
fifth quarterback on the roster, he'd eventually start them too.</TE>
<TE>   Who's Next?</TE>
<TE>   Teams most likely to join in on the NFL's favorite pastime,
quarterback roulette:</TE>
<TE>   Denver Broncos: Brian Griese injured himself tripping over his dog
(his story), then got tripped up by the Baltimore Ravens (that we saw
with our own eyes). Coach Mike Shanahan's patience is getting as
short as the conservative passing scheme to which he has tethered
Griese. Another shaky start today, at home to San Diego, and Steve
Beuerlein, surgically repaired and ready, could get the call.</TE>
<TE>   Dallas Cowboys: Jerry Jones spent a second-round pick on Quincy
Carter, then cut Tony Banks to get him out of the way for the start
of a sure-fire Pro Bowl career, then watched Carter flounder through
his first 10 NFL starts. "I don't know if I would say I'm pleased,"
Jones said a few days before Carter did just enough not to blow the
Cowboys' 13-10 victory at St. Louis. It's still week to week with
Carter, with ex-minor league pitcher Chad Hutchinson warming up in
the bullpen.</TE>
<TE>   Baltimore Ravens: Brian Billick didn't get to the Super Bowl
without changing quarterbacks, didn't get through last season without
changing quarterbacks and with a former Pro Bowl quarterback, Jeff
Blake, sitting while a jittery Chris Redman runs for cover, Billick's
trigger finger is going to start itching soon.</TE>
<TE>   Houston Texans: Rookie David Carr has already been sacked 26
times, an average of nearly seven a game. No human can withstand that
kind of pounding over the course of 16 games. Backup Banks must wince
every time Carr drops back to pass.</TE>

<HD>South America a Continent Adrift</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GRAHAME L. JONES</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Europe does not have a monopoly on soccer news. It only seems that
way sometimes.</LD>
<LD>   If South America could ever get its act together--a dubious
proposition given the weak and/or corrupt leadership of its 10 soccer
federations--it might one day hold its own, but don't count on it.</LD>
<LD>   Even CONMEBOL, the acronym by which the South American
confederation is known, needs to put its chaotic house in order.
Nicholas Leoz, the Paraguayan president of CONMEBOL, can start by
upgrading the continent's major club championship, the Libertadores
Cup.</LD>
<TE>   This is supposed to be the equivalent of the European Cup, now
organized as the vastly popular and profitable Champions League, but
it doesn't even come close.</TE>
<TE>   What sort of nonsense is it that qualifying games for the
Libertadores Cup take place in Los Angeles between second- or
third-string teams from Mexico?</TE>
<TE>   Small wonder local fans turn out in small numbers for such
non-events. They are far wiser than the organizers.</TE>
<TE>   Time Out</TE>
<TE>   Unless the financially plagued Bolivian league can somehow find a
cure for its current woes, it will be a long time before the country
again produces players of the caliber of Marco Etcheverry and Jaime
Moreno.</TE>
<TE>   Mexican Mix-Up</TE>
<TE>   Then there is the farcical situation in Mexico City, where Club
America, arguably one of the leading teams in the Americas, has lost
a coach who was unbeaten 10 games into the season.</TE>
<TE>   Under interim Coach Mario Carillo, "Las Aguilas" had compiled an
8-0-2 record before Carillo announced last week that he was stepping
aside to allow Coach Manuel Lapuente to take back the reins.</TE>
<TE>   Javier Perez Treuffer, Club America's president, expressed
surprise. Or at least he feigned it.</TE>
<TE>   "It is a rare and strange case," he said in Mexico City. "I don't
believe there is any other case in the world of a coach whose team
are undisputed leaders simply getting up and saying, 'I'm off.'
Everybody is confused."</TE>
<TE>   Not everybody. Those whose word means something understand it
completely.</TE>
<TE>   Carillo agreed to serve as interim coach for a set period of time
when Lapuente needed time off. Club America should have understood
that it was only a temporary arrangement.</TE>
<TE>   Lapuente did, and thanked Carillo for his achievements and his
integrity in stepping aside despite his success with the team.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't want any confusion," said Lapuente, who coached Mexico at
the 1998 World Cup in France. "It [was] an agreement of loyalty to a
companion, a brother and a friend."</TE>
<TE>   American, Not Scotch</TE>
<TE>   If and when he ever signs a new contract, will U.S. Coach Bruce
Arena do the right thing and call the wonderfully named Johnny Walker
in for a trial with the national team?</TE>
<TE>   Walker has long been earning positive reviews in Chile, where he
is the starting goalkeeper for Universidad Catolica.</TE>
<TE>   The memorable playoff goal that Tony Meola allowed the Galaxy's
Chris Albright to score almost from the halfway line when the Kansas
City Wizards' Meola inexplicably had his back turned indicates that
it might be time to give Walker a shot at the No. 3 spot, along with
the MetroStars' Tim Howard and D.C. United's Nick Rimando.</TE>
<TE>   Brad Friedel and Kasey Keller, of course, remain the top dogs.</TE>
<TE>   Too European</TE>
<TE>   Osvaldo "Ossie" Ardiles was on the ropes. Having taken over as
coach of Racing Club, the defending Argentine champion, he suffered
through one bad result after another and was on the verge of being
fired.</TE>
<TE>   Then things suddenly clicked as Racing rediscovered its form and
began winning again, saving Ardiles' job.</TE>
<TE>   Ardiles, a World Cup-winning winger on Argentina's 1978 team, said
the turnaround is easily explained.</TE>
<TE>   "As a severe self-criticism, I believe that I was too quick in
trying to play a more European type of football, more dynamic,
pressing in all areas of the field," he told the Buenos Aires radio
station Del Plata.</TE>
<TE>   "It needed much more physical effort than we could give and the
players were not in condition to carry it out."</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps that's also why England beat Argentina at the World Cup,
and why Juan Sebastian Veron has struggled with Manchester United.</TE>
<TE>   Dance of the Coaches</TE>
<TE>   It was sad to see Valdir Espinosa dismissed last week as coach of
Brazilian champion Atletico Paranaese. Sad, but hardly surprising.
Brazilian clubs fire coaches at the drop of a hat, and fans call the
constant flux "the dance of the coaches."</TE>
<TE>   Espinosa was the 14th coach to dance his way out of a job in a
season that is barely two months old. His replacement is Gilson
Nunes, who, some might recall, coached Costa Rica during its
qualifying campaign for the 2002 World Cup before he too lost his
job.</TE>
<TE>   Steve Sampson, Costa Rica's new coach, knows the risk he is
taking.</TE>
<TE>   Colombian Supreme</TE>
<TE>   Ever wonder whatever happened to flamboyant Colombian goalkeeper
Rene Higuita, he of the famed "scorpion kick"?</TE>
<TE>   Well, Higuita, 36, is involved in his latest comeback, playing for
unfashionable--not to say unheard-of--Pereira in the Colombian league
and enjoying every moment of it.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm happy to be doing what I enjoy most, which is to play
football," Higuita said.</TE>
<TE>   Futbol de Primera</TE>
<TE>   Futbol de Primera, the international Spanish-language soccer radio
network put together by Argentina's Alejandoro Gutman and Andres
Cantor, again will host a top-level soccer symposium in Beverly Hills
on Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   The event, at 9 a.m. at the Beverly Hilton Hotel, will feature
guest speakers Angel Villar, president of the Spanish soccer
federation and a FIFA and UEFA vice president, and Tim Leiweke,
president of the Anschutz Entertainment Group. They will speak about
the future of the sport, globally and in the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, Sampson and Hermes Navarro, president of Costa Rica's
soccer federation, will be present to discuss Sampson's appointment
as coach of the Ticos, and special presentations will be made to
Carlos Hermosillo, the former Galaxy striker who is the Mexican
league's all-time leading goal scorer, and Clay Berling, founder of
Soccer America magazine.</TE>
<TE>   The event comes one day after Futbol de Primera stages its annual
Honda player of the year luncheon, at the same venue at 11 a.m.
Tuesday. U.S. World Cup stars Friedel, Landon Donovan and Claudio
Reyna are the finalists for the award.</TE>

<HD>Disney May Keep a Piece of Angels</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL SHAIKIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As he joined in the merry celebration after the Angels' victory over
the New York Yankees on Saturday, Disney Chairman Michael Eisner for
the first time raised the possibility that the company might retain a
partial ownership stake upon selling the team.</LD>
<LD>   Disney recently hired an investment bank to sell the money-losing
team, a decision that reflected in part a corporate urgency to sell
nonessential assets at a time company stock has plunged to eight-year
lows and in part an admission that the company has been unable to
attract buyers it deems qualified. In a sputtering economy, and with
Disney insisting that prospective buyers keep the team in Anaheim,
Eisner acknowledged Saturday that what he called "the right buyer"
has not been easy to find.</LD>
<LD>   "There are not a lot of people like that," he said. "We may or may
not sell. If we do, we may very well stay in as a partner."</LD>
<TE>   Disney valued the Angels at $300 million during sale discussions
three years ago, but major league sources believe the company might
accept as little as $180 million to make a deal. As part of a sale,
Disney could retain an interest in the Angels' retail merchandising
and licensing.</TE>
<TE>   Since Disney retained the investment bank, potential buyers
expressing interest in buying the team include Mexican billionaire
Carlos Peralta, former baseball commissioner Peter Ueberroth and the
Nederlander family, theater impresarios.</TE>
<TE>   Eisner, drenched in champagne after the game, saluted the Angels
for their first postseason series victory.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's great for all of Southern California, for Orange
County in particular and for the Walt Disney Co.," he said. "It
demonstrates the kind of teamwork we like to have in everything we
do--making movies, building theme parks, whatever.</TE>
<TE>   "We like to use sports analogies. For our company, this becomes a
sports analogy for the future: Remember the '02 Angels!"</TE>

<HD>Galaxy Makes Rapid Advance</HD>
<DH>Soccer: L.A. gets to play the style it enjoys most, and it
shows in a 4-0 rout of Colorado in Game 1 of semifinal playoff
series.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL GUTIERREZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>These are the kinds of games in which the Galaxy enjoys playing.</LD>
<LD>   Technical yet wide-open games with spacious running lanes, plenty
of offense and a large and involved crowd making tons of noise by
clapping together its free thundersticks.</LD>
<LD>   Sound familiar? Well, all that was missing here was the Rally
Monkey.</LD>
<TE>   But then again, the little guy's services weren't needed Saturday
night in the emotionally charged atmosphere of the Rose Bowl, some 35
miles north of his Edison Field habitat.</TE>
<TE>   The Galaxy saw to that with its dominating 4-0 victory over the
Colorado Rapids in front of 24,742 to take a three-points-to-none
lead in the first-team-to-five-points Major League Soccer semifinal
series.</TE>
<TE>   One more victory--either at Denver on Wednesday night or at Cal
State Fullerton next Saturday--and the Galaxy will be heading to the
MLS Cup title game for the third time in four years, the fourth time
overall.</TE>
<TE>   The Galaxy, which has not won a league title, is 7-0 in playoff
series when winning Game 1.</TE>
<TE>   "It's obviously a great night in L.A., isn't it," said Colorado
Coach Tim Hankinson, lumping the Galaxy victory with the Angels
defeating the New York Yankees earlier in the day. "The Galaxy had a
great game and beat us all over the park. They had us chasing the
game."</TE>
<TE>   The Rapids also were left chasing Carlos Ruiz. The Galaxy's
first-year striker from Guatemala continued his scoring binge,
getting two goals and lifting his playoff total to six, equaling the
1996 MLS postseason record shared by Roy Lassiter and Raul Diaz Arce.
Ruiz's 14 points (six goals, two assists) also ties the mark set by
Ante Razov in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't know that," said Ruiz, who led the league with 24 goals
in the regular season. "That's good, but just like the regular-season
race with Taylor [Twellman, the New England forward], that's not the
big thing. The big thing is getting the championship."</TE>
<TE>   Cobi Jones contributed two assists after taking a hard fall four
minutes into the game in a collision with Rapid defender, and former
Galaxy teammate, Robin Fraser. After being carried off on a
stretcher, Jones returned and played the rest of the game with what
was diagnosed as a slight abdominal strain.</TE>
<TE>   "You get more space against [Colorado] than you do against Kansas
City," Jones said, referring to the Galaxy's rough-and-tumble
first-round playoff opponent. "But in turn, [the Rapids] are more of
an offensive threat."</TE>
<TE>   Not on this night.</TE>
<TE>   The Galaxy outshot the Rapids, 22-12, and Galaxy goalkeeper Kevin
Hartman made seven saves, including a clutch block of a John Spencer
penalty kick in the 37th minute with the Galaxy ahead only 2-0.</TE>
<TE>   The first Galaxy goal came in the 21st minute when Danny Califf
beat Ritchie Kotschau to the ball on a Jones corner kick and headed
it into the ground and past three Colorado players--goalkeeper David
Kramer and midfielders Mark Chung and Chris Henderson. Ruiz's two
goals came in the 24th and 84th minutes and sandwiched Ezra
Hendrickson's goal in the 71st minute, when Hendrickson followed the
ricochet of Mauricio Cienfuegos' shot off Kramer.</TE>
<TE>   "It's more rewarding to win at home, where the fans support you
and can relish it with you," said Hartman, who has saved six of the
15 penalty kicks he has faced in his six-year career. "It's playoff
time and you can't take anything for granted. Our expectations are so
high that anything less than a championship is unacceptable."</TE>

Dan Hendricks, beaten 2 1/2 lengths by Oak Leaf entrant Espy. The
barn does better with maidens second time out of the box and she will
be right with the lead as David Flores takes over. LEGINIT is a
firster by Dehere from a winning barn (Laura De Seroux) and the
stable can pop with a rookie--Azeri won at a monster price at this
meet last year in her bow--and she had 59 1/5 and 35 2/5 drills at
San Luis Rey. She will race on Lasix. BALCOVY disappointed after a
slow start at 7-2 down south, but fits off her previous pair for
Eduardo Inda. She has trained well locally for her first appearance
in more than two months.</TE>

<TE>   Comments: HECANDIGIT was overmatched in his latest on the grass
when last at nearly 30-1 in the Del Mar Derby. Back in with maidens,
the son of Marlin can get the job done against a rather weak group
and he did work a mile in 1:43 and a half in 47 flat for Warren
Stute. MAYOR MURPHY is another trial horse with 13 defeats on his
resume, but he did run well in his lone start down south for Vladimir
Cerin and is an obvious must use in the exotics. He has been second
or third six times. HABANEROS will be part of the pace as he goes
long and tries turf for the first time in his third appearance for
Ray Bell. The runner-up in his last race (Prime Time Event) ran well
to be second on the local lawn behind Vronsky on Wednesday.</TE>

<TE>   Comments: SHAMEFUL makes her first start since July 24 for Bob
Baffert and the Flying Chevron miss is clearly the one to catch as
she returns to the scene of both of her victories. She won the first
two outings of her career here in January and February. She sizzled
six furlongs in 1:11 4/5 a week ago. REAL PARANOIDE bids for her
fourth consecutive win and the late running sprinter is on top of her
game for Pete Eurton. She has been 1-2 in nine of 14 at this trip,
but will she get enough help to set up her charge? FARAH LOVE is a
hard knocking mare who has to be respected with the move to Arcadia.
A four-time winner, 'LOVE has earned three of those victories at this
place. She won a pair during the winter-spring meet.</TE>

<TE>   Comments: APALACHIAN THUNDER was the runner-up to Norfolk
participant Listen Indy when stretched to a mile, and finished four
lengths clear of a next out winner. 'THUNDER looks to be sitting on
his maiden victory for Howard Zucker and can get the money if he
takes to the turf. He worked five furlongs in 1:00 3/5 a week ago.
SAVONAROLA is bred for the sod and should improve on the stretch out
for Eoin Harty. He will show his speed with Patrick Valenzuela.
SWELTER finished a distant second to the promising Man Among Men and
is one of only three in here with grass experience. He has had four
local works for Dave Hofmans since racing on Aug. 26.</TE>

<TE>   Comments: MORE INFLUENCE was rushed into a speed jam while wide
going short down south in a spot where he looked as if he would
settle behind the leaders and make a late run. Not surprisingly, he
had nothing to give late and wound up fifth as the 17-10 favorite.
The gelding goes long again today, and although he was no match for a
then-sharp California Goal, he did run decently in a Del Mar route.
He worked in 59 1/5 for Cliff Sise Jr. and gets the call in a
contentious race. FRENCH REBEL dominated maidens as the even-money
choice and may be coming around for Bill Spawr. Warn Me Again, who
finished seven lengths behind him, was a next out winner. TRIMONTIUM
scratched from a turf race to go here and now tries the dirt for the
first time. The son of Mt. Livermore has trained well on the main for
Carla Gaines and he will race on Lasix for the first time.</TE>

<TE>   Comments: SEA JEWEL was a distant fourth in the Del Mar Debutante
but missed third money by only a head and acts like a filly who will
improve routing. Her maiden win for John Shirreffs was visually
impressive and she has trained well enough at 'Anita. Tab in a weak
renewal of the Oak Leaf. ESPY dominated maidens in her second start
for Richard Mandella and is another who should be able to handle the
additional yardage. She's by Mt. Livermore, who is a son of Blushing
Groom, out of a Cox's Ridge mare. COMPOSURE got her act together in
her third start for Baffert and remains well regarded by the stable.
Fast works continue for the daughter of Touch Gold. She went a bullet
1:11 2/5 a week ago and had a 1:37 4/5 move six days earlier.</TE>

<TE>   Comments: MOMENTUM is due for some luck after narrow losses in the
Hollywood Gold Cup and Pacific Classic. He lacked room into the lane
in the race at Del Mar and it can be argued that he would have beaten
Came Home had he found an opening earlier. He's reunited with Corey
Nakatani, who won the 2001 Native Diver Handicap with this
4-year-old. KELA was given too much to do and was caught wide while
rallying when chasing Congaree home in the Del Mar Breeders' Cup
Handicap last month. The Numerous colt blew out in 33 2/5 on Friday
morning and Gary Stevens rode him perfectly when they collaborated in
an allowance race at Del Mar in July. PLEASANTLY PERFECT was fourth
in the Pacific Classic and the improving Pleasant Colony colt has
never been worse than second in three races over this track. He
prepped in 1:12 4/5 for Mandella eight days ago.</TE>

<TE>*--*</TE>
<TE>   Comments: SARAFAN missed by a head to Beat Hollow in the Arlington
Million and isn't facing any such competition in a race that probably
does not deserve Grade I status given its recent history. The
consistent gelding has been 1-2 in nearly half of his 27 starts and
he has trained well, including 1:25 and 1:27 2/5 over this oval.
SKIPPING was only beaten two lengths behind With Anticipation, who
would be very hard to handle in this spot, and the 5-year-old did run
well in his only other try on this course for Bobby Frankel. He has
yet to finish off the board in his four races in the U.S. THE TIN MAN
has won five times in 10 starts for Mandella and four of the scores
have been local. This will be his first try at 10 furlongs, but he
was only beaten a neck by longshot Delta Form going 1 3/8 miles in
the Del Mar Handicap.</TE>

<TE>   Comments: BINNY'S TRICK has trained as if he has some ability for
Nick Canani, working five furlongs in 59 1/5 six days before a 48
flat drill. The son of Phone Trick has the comfortable outside box
and looks as good as any in a race where eight of the 10 entrants are
firsters. MIDDLEWEIGHT is a son of Grand Slam, who is off to a good
start as a sire, and the presence of David Flores suggests he may
have some zip. The chestnut had a 1:12 2/5 work on Sept. 18 for
Mandella. GOLDEN EMBERS is a gelded son of Danjur who blew out in 35
1/5 for Inda and also had 1:00 4/5 and 59 1/5 spins. The barn does
well with rookies.</TE>

<TE>   Comments: SHAMEFUL makes her first start since July 24 for Bob
Baffert and the Flying Chevron miss is clearly the one to catch as
she returns to the scene of both of her victories. She won the first
two outings of her career here in January and February. She sizzled
six furlongs in 1:11 4/5 a week ago. REAL PARANOIDE bids for her
fourth consecutive win and the late running sprinter is on top of her
game for Pete Eurton. She's been 1-2 in nine of 14 at this trip, but
will she get enough help to set up her charge? FARAH LOVE is a hard
knocking mare who has to be respected with the move to Arcadia. A
four-time winner, 'LOVE has earned three of those victories at this
place. She won a pair during the winter-spring meet.</TE>

<TE>   Comments: APALACHIAN THUNDER was the runner-up to Norfolk
participant Listen Indy when stretched to a mile, and finished four
lengths clear of a next out winner. 'THUNDER looks to be sitting on
his maiden victory for Howard Zucker and can get the money if he
takes to the turf. He worked five furlongs in 1:00 3/5 a week ago.
SAVONAROLA is bred for the sod and should improve on the stretch out
for Eoin Harty. He will show his speed with Patrick Valenzuela.
SWELTER finished a distant second to the promising Man Among Men and
is one of only three in here with grass experience. He's had four
local works for Dave Hofmans since racing on Aug. 26.</TE>

<TE>   Comments: MORE INFLUENCE was rushed into a speed jam while wide
going short down south in a spot where he looked as if he would
settle behind the leaders and make a late run. Not surprisingly, he
had nothing to give late and wound up fifth as the 17-10 favorite.
The gelding goes long again today, and although he was no match for a
then-sharp California Goal, he did run decently in a Del Mar route.
He worked in 59 1/5 for Cliff Sise Jr. and gets the call in a
contentious race. FRENCH REBEL dominated maidens as the even-money
choice and may be coming around for Bill Spawr. Warn Me Again, who
finished seven lengths behind him, was a next out winner. TRIMONTIUM
scratched from a turf race to go here and now tries the dirt for the
first time. The son of Mt. Livermore has trained well on the main for
Carla Gaines and he will race on Lasix for the first time.</TE>

<TE>   Comments: SEA JEWEL was a distant fourth in the Del Mar Debutante,
but missed third money by only a head and acts like a filly who will
improve routing. Her maiden win for John Shirreffs was visually
impressive and she has trained well enough at 'Anita. Tab in a weak
renewal of the Oak Leaf. ESPY dominated maidens in her second start
for Richard Mandella and is another who should be able to handle the
additional yardage. She's by Mt. Livermore, who is a son of Blushing
Groom, out of a Cox's Ridge mare. COMPOSURE got her act together in
her third start for Baffert and remains well regarded by the stable.
Fast works continue for the daughter of Touch Gold. She went a bullet
1:11 2/5 a week ago and had a 1:37 4/5 move six days earlier.</TE>

<TE>   Comments: MOMENTUM is due for some luck after narrow losses in the
Hollywood Gold Cup and Pacific Classic. He lacked room into the lane
in the race at Del Mar and it can be argued that he would have beaten
Came Home had he found an opening earlier. He's reunited with Corey
Nakatani, who won the 2001 Native Diver Handicap with this
4-year-old. KELA was given too much to do and was caught wide while
rallying when chasing Congaree home in the Del Mar Breeders' Cup
Handicap last month. The Numerous colt blew out in 33 2/5 on Friday
morning and Gary Stevens rode him perfectly when they collaborated in
an allowance race at Del Mar in July. PLEASANTLY PERFECT was fourth
in the Pacific Classic and the improving Pleasant Colony colt has
never been worse than second in three races over this track. He
prepped in 1:12 4/5 for Mandella eight days ago.</TE>

<TE>   Comments: SARAFAN missed by a head to Beat Hollow in the Arlington
Million and isn't facing any such competition in a race that probably
does not deserve Grade I status given its recent history. The
consistent gelding has been 1-2 in nearly half of his 27 starts and
he has trained well, including 1:25 and 1:27 2/5 over this oval.
SKIPPING was only beaten two lengths behind With Anticipation, who
would be very hard to handle in this spot, and the 5-year-old did run
well in his only other try on this course for Bobby Frankel. He has
yet to finish off the board in his four races in the U.S. THE TIN MAN
has won five times in 10 starts for Mandella and four of the scores
have been local. This will be his first try at 10 furlongs, but he
was only beaten a neck by longshot Delta Form going 1 3/8 miles in
the Del Mar Handicap.</TE>

<TE>   Comments: BINNY'S TRICK has trained as if he has some ability for
Nick Canani, working five furlongs in 59 1/5 six days before a 48
flat drill. The son of Phone Trick has the comfortable outside box
and looks as good as any in a race where eight of the 10 entrants are
firsters. MIDDLEWEIGHT is a son of Grand Slam, who is off to a good
start as a sire, and the presence of David Flores suggests he may
have some zip. The chestnut had a 1:12 2/5 work on Sept. 18 for
Mandella. GOLDEN EMBERS is a gelded son of Danjur blew out in 35 1/5
for Inda and also had 1:00 4/5 and 59 1/5 spins. The barn does well

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When they ran the $500,000 Yellow Ribbon at Santa Anita on Saturday,
owner Gary Tanaka was closely watching his filly, Golden Apples, but
he had an eye for Banks Hill as well. No matter how good your own
horse, it's difficult to ignore last year's Breeders' Cup Filly and
Mare Turf winner.</LD>
<LD>   "When I saw those Juddmonte silks [the colors of Banks Hill's
owner], I thought, 'Is this going to be Del Mar all over again?' "
Tanaka said after the race.</LD>
<LD>   Golden Apples, who was second, a neck behind Affluent, in the John
Mabee Ramona Handicap at Del Mar in July, won the Yellow Ribbon by a
length over Voodoo Dancer as favored Banks Hill, caught behind horses
in the stretch, finished third, beaten by four lengths. With wins in
the Yellow Ribbon and the Beverly D. at Arlington Park, Golden Apples
will be favored in the Filly and Mare Turf when Arlington plays host
to the Breeders' Cup races on Oct. 26.</LD>
<TE>   "Now if she only lives up to that role," said Ben Cecil, who has
trained Golden Apples since Tanaka bought the Irish-bred filly in the
summer of 2001. "And even if she gets soft ground in Chicago, I don't
think that should be a problem."</TE>
<TE>   Golden Apples, ridden by Pat Valenzuela, paid $4.80 as the second
choice, running 1 1/4 miles in 1:59 3/5.</TE>
<TE>   The Yellow Ribbon was one of seven Breeders' Cup preps this
weekend at Santa Anita. Three more are scheduled today. In other
races Saturday, Kalookan Queen, a 6-year-old mare, beat males in the
$207,875 Ancient Title Handicap but will probably stay home while her
stablemate, Kona Gold, tries to win the Breeders' Cup Sprint for the
second time; Kafwain and Bull Market gave trainer Bob Baffert a 1-2
finish in the $200,000 Norfolk; and trainer Nick Canani, winning the
race that his father, Julio, had won in 1999 and 2001, saddled 9-1
shot Night Patrol for a narrow win over Kachamandi in the $234,000
Oak Tree Mile.</TE>
<TE>   Other horses used Kentucky and New York as their sendoffs for the
Breeders' Cup. At Keeneland, Xtra Heat, runner-up to Squirtle Squirt
in last year's Sprint, beat males for the first time as she won the
$250,000 Phoenix Stakes by three lengths; and undefeated Sky Mesa,
the expected Breeders' Cup Juvenile favorite, won the Lane's End
Breeders' Futurity by four lengths over Lone Star Sky.</TE>
<TE>   At Belmont Park, Toccet, a 9-1 shot who had won two races in
Maryland by almost 20 lengths, closed on the rail to beat
Icecoldbeeratreds, the Del Mar Futurity winner, by 1 1/2 lengths in
the $500,000 Champagne. Undefeated Storm Flag Flying became a heavy
favorite for the Breeders' Cup Juvenile Fillies with a two-length win
over Santa Catarina in the $500,000 Frizette. In the $750,000
Beldame, Imperial Gesture led all the way for a 2 3/4-length win, and
Green Fee, at 9-1, beat Forbidden Apple by a half-length in the Kelso
Handicap.</TE>

<LD>   The defending state Division I champion Cowboys defeated Crescenta
Valley, 35-49, in the boys' race as Ryan Morgan placed first with a
15-minute 30-second clocking over the three-mile course. Teammate
Troy Werner was third in 15:39 for a Canyon team that had six of the
top 13 finishers.</LD>
<LD>   The Canyon girls defeated Rolling Hills Estates Peninsula, 29-66,
to snap Peninsula's streak of Staub titles at three. Freshman Brenda
Cohen of Canyon placed second in 18:50 and senior teammate Brenda
Stevens was third in 19:11. Junior Lindsay Flacks of North Hollywood

Division I race by 26 seconds over second-place Mike Powers of Santa

invitationals the previous two weeks. Trafeh's time ranks as the
second fastest on the course behind the 14:52 set by Ryan Hall of Big

fastest girls' time of 19:33 to win the Division I race.</TE>

spent a year being home-schooled, making him a fifth-year senior.
Although the player could have petitioned the section for
eligibility, "the school never filed the necessary paperwork,"
Simmons said.</TE>

with a 35-0 loss to Colton and is now 1-3.</TE>

<LD>The $500,000 Goodwood Breeders' Cup Handicap, which will be run for
the 21st time today, has been a key prep in recent years for the
Breeders' Cup Classic.</LD>
<LD>   In five of the last six years, horses exiting the Grade II have
gone on to finish either first or second in the Classic.</LD>
<LD>   Tiznow, who was third in the Goodwood a year after winning the 1
1/8-mile race, has won the last two Classics. Budroyale, the 1999
winner, finished second to longshot Cat Thief in the Breeders' Cup,
and Silver Charm was second in 1998 after taking the Goodwood.</LD>
<TE>   Alphabet Soup, who upset Cigar in the Breeders' Cup Classic in
1996, had finished third in the Goodwood.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the nine participants in this year's Goodwood hope the
pattern holds true in 2002.</TE>
<TE>   Momentum, second in the Hollywood Gold Cup and Pacific Classic,
will be favored as he tries for his first win since the Native Diver
Handicap on Dec. 9 at Hollywood Park.</TE>
<TE>   There are two other stakes at Santa Anita that are preps for the
Breeders' Cup. Espy and Composure head the field in the $200,000 Oak
Leaf, and Sarafan is the favorite in the $300,000 Clement L. Hirsch
Memorial Turf Championship.</TE>
<TE>   Race of the day: Take Charge Lady and You will be getting ready
for the Breeders' Cup Distaff in the $500,000 Spinster Stakes at
Keeneland. Beat Hollow will try for his fourth Grade I win of the
year in the $600,000 Shadwell Keeneland Turf Mile.</TE>
<TE>   Who's hot: Omar Figueroa. The apprentice is winning at about 21%
at Bay Meadows.</TE>
<TE>   Who's not: F.A. Lowery. The trainer, based in Northern California,
has won with only two of 50 starters in 2002.</TE>
<TE>   Exotically speaking: A pick three singling Shameful in the third,
using Savonarola and Apalachian Thunder in the fourth and French
Rebel, More Influence, Stokin Coal and Trimontium in the fifth.</TE>
<TE>   Winners: Previous day/meet total: 0/9. Money: Previous day/meet
total: $0/$38. Total money bet: $70.</TE>

<LD>As the Lakers prepare for their first exhibition game Tuesday night
at Bakersfield against the Clippers, the big news is still Shaquille
O'Neal's big toe.</LD>
<LD>   O'Neal, recovering from toe surgery, shot free throws and did some
light work on exercise equipment Saturday while his teammates went
through a grueling 3 1/2-hour practice session at the Lakers'
training facility in El Segundo.</LD>
<LD>   Although Phil Jackson said he remains hopeful that O'Neal might be
ready for the Lakers' regular-season opener Oct. 29 against San
Antonio at Staples Center, O'Neal is more cautious than his coach.
O'Neal won't make any predictions.</LD>
<TE>   "I'll play when I'm pain free," he said. "When that will be, I
don't want to say. I don't want to say I'll be ready at a certain
time, and then not be."</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers began their practice session Saturday with weight work
and stretching, then did a lot a scrimmaging, both half court and
full court. They finished by doing three sets of wind sprints--two
times up and back, then three times, then four.</TE>
<TE>   Afterward, Jackson did not seemed particularly pleased with the
practice session.</TE>
<TE>   "It was OK," he said, "but not as good as Friday's. There was more
play than execution, but that's understandable this time of year."</TE>
<TE>   Jackson said he hopes the team shows more organization against the
Clippers on Tuesday night.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a preseason game, but still people are paying money to see
you," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Tickets for the game at Bakersfield's Centennial Garden and
Convention Center are priced from $10 to $150.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson said Kobe Bryant and the regulars will play about half the
game.</TE>
<TE>   "I know the fans would like to see Kobe play 48 minutes, but he'll
probably play only 24," Jackson said. "We've got to assess our young
players."</TE>
<TE>   The game will be televised by Channel 9. For Paul Sunderland, who
filled in for Chick Hearn for 56 games last year, this game will mark
his first since being named the Lakers' new full-time play-by-play
announcer.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers will be back at their El Segundo training center for
morning and afternoon practice sessions today.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>It was the ultimate vindication for Mike Scioscia, for an Angel
manager in the postseason.</LD>
<LD>   Four days after he threatened to be swallowed by the same demons
of controversy that engulfed Gene Mauch when the Angels last went to
the playoffs 16 years ago and have haunted the franchise ever since,
it all came up golden for the manager Saturday, including the
champagne.</LD>
<LD>   How sweet.</LD>
<TE>   How silly that ultimate interpretation, Scioscia implied after his
fearless and frolicking Angels demolished the New York Yankees again,
9-5, and eliminated the masters of the October universe from the
postseason tournament.</TE>
<TE>   In another battering of another Yankee starting pitcher, an
eight-run fifth inning was decisive, as were several Scioscia
decisions that might have generated controversy again.</TE>
<TE>   If instead they helped uncork nearly two decades of emotions for
the Angels and their reborn partisans, if instead they thrust the
Angels into the American League championship series and created a
World Series scenario without the Yankees for the first time since
1997, Scioscia refused to categorize the success of those decisions
as vindication or redemption for his much-debated decision to keep
Troy Percival in the bullpen as the Yankees were scoring the decisive
runs in Game 1.</TE>
<TE>   Percival, of course, came back to save Games 2 and 3, and there he
was in the ninth-inning shadows of Game 4, pumping 95-mph fastballs
to the dazed Yankees, wrapping up the Angels' first victory in a
postseason series, and there he was as well amid the champagne of the
clubhouse, dismissing the critics much as his team had dismissed the
Yankees.</TE>
<TE>   "Let 'em second-guess all they want," he said. "The manager makes
the decisions and we live with them. He's taken us to where we've
never been before."</TE>
<TE>   On Saturday, the decisions represented business as usual for
Scioscia.</TE>
<TE>   Second baseman Adam Kennedy, for instance, may have delivered a
home run, double, single and sacrifice fly in the stunning Game 3
victory Friday night, but wasn't left-hander David Wells starting for
the Yankees on Saturday and didn't the right-handed-hitting Benji Gil
represent a better matchup to Scioscia's thinking even though Gil was
one for 17 against Wells and even though Scioscia had said in the
spring that Kennedy had become an everyday player?</TE>
<TE>   Well, that everyday situation has taken on the same look of a
platoon that the designated-hitter position has, and as Gil went to
second base Saturday, the right-handed-hitting Shawn Wooten again
replaced Brad Fullmer as the DH.</TE>
<TE>   The bottom line was that Gil and Wooten each had three hits,
including two each as 13 batters went to the plate in the
fifth-inning barrage that began with a game-tying home run by Wooten.</TE>
<TE>   Wooten went six for nine in the series, a .667 average that
provided a resounding complement to Gil's .800 average and Kennedy's
.500.</TE>
<TE>   "As a manager," Scioscia said, "you try to put players in the best
position to succeed. No one is happy when they don't play, and I
wouldn't expect it or want it to be different, but sacrifice is as
important to a team's success as accomplishment. I thought it was an
easy call today."</TE>
<TE>   He referred to the Kennedy/Gil decision. For Kennedy, seventh in
the AL in hitting at .312 and coming off that big performance in Game
3, he seemed to wish that it hadn't been such an easy call.</TE>
<TE>   After exchanging a long embrace with Gil in the soggy clubhouse,
Kennedy said:</TE>
<TE>   "It's not in a player to be happy when he doesn't play, but you
accept it, there's no other choice. Benji and I have become so close
that we've helped each other try to understand the way it is."</TE>
<TE>   So, as Gil and Wooten produced four of the 10 hits in that
remarkable fifth inning and six of the Angels' 14 overall, there was
Scioscia calling for a hit-and-run that David Eckstein turned to
magic during that fifth-inning barrage. And there he was refusing to
apply a quick hook to Jarrod Washburn, working on three days' rest,
who threw 44 pitches in the first two innings but went on to give up
only two runs in five. And there he was showing faith again in the
20-year-old Francisco Rodriguez, who responded with 1 2/3 innings of
scoreless (although somewhat shaky) relief, striking out three while
walking two with a wild pitch.</TE>
<TE>   It all worked, and now the Angels have 102 wins this year and
Derek Jeter is saying no one will beat them if they continue to play
the way they have been. That certainly is a more dramatic reflection
of the manager's impact than any Game 4 decision, because it all
started in the spring when Scioscia and his staff convinced the
players that they needed to embrace a situational approach at the
plate and aggressiveness on the bases, and now, seven months later,
they turned it into a nonstop embarrassment of the Yankees.</TE>
<TE>   "These guys have taken it and rode with it, but I don't really
think we put in anything that wasn't there," Scioscia said, meaning
he has a roster of grit.</TE>
<TE>   "To beat a team as great as the Yankees shows the depth of our
club and that it wasn't intimidated and won't be.</TE>
<TE>   "I suppose in the sense that not a lot of people gave us much of a
chance in this series that validation has to be a part of it, but I
think that's a lot different than vindication."</TE>
<TE>   Maybe it is.</TE>
<TE>   After all, hasn't Scioscia been saying from the start,
broadcasting through the media to help convince his players, that
they are championship caliber?</TE>
<TE>   After all, hasn't he insisted, as he did again Saturday, that the
controversy in Game 1 wasn't a controversy at all but only a
difference of opinions?</TE>
<TE>   And didn't he react matter-of-factly to the final out Saturday,
saying later this was only the first rung on the ladder to the
Angels' ultimate goal?</TE>
<TE>   Yankee Manager Joe Torre had purposely watched Scioscia's reaction
to "see if the son of a gun would let his guard down." When it didn't
happen, when Scioscia merely walked out, shook hands with his
celebrating players, and walked off, Torre said he wasn't fooling
anyone, that it was a "lot of baloney because you know what's going
on [inside of him]."</TE>
<TE>   On this day, in this October, you have to believe it was a lot
different than what was going on inside the Yankee manager.</TE>

<TE>   ** New York Giants (2-2) at Dallas (2-2), 10 a.m., Channel 11:
Measuring stick? Both teams have defeated the Rams this season, but
that doesn't really tell us anything, does it? LINE: Pick.</TE>
<TE>   **** Oakland (3-0) at Buffalo (2-2), 10 a.m., Channel 2, KMPC
(1540): "He's on fire," Raider Coach Bill Callahan says of Bill
quarterback Drew Bledsoe. No wonder this one has a potential for
fireworks. LINE: Oakland by 3.</TE>
<TE>   ** Tampa Bay (3-1) at Atlanta (1-2), 10 a.m.: Since leaving Tampa
Bay to sign a $28.5-million deal with Atlanta, running back Warrick
Dunn wins Kevin Brown award by averaging 40.3 yards per game. LINE:
Tampa Bay by 1.</TE>
<TE>   ** Arizona (2-2) at Carolina (3-1), 10 a.m.: Panthers last week
barely miss out on first 4-0 start? With a victory, Cardinals could
match best start since 1991? What in the name of Jesse Ventura is
going on here? LINE: Carolina by 4.</TE>
<TE>   ** Washington (1-2) at Tennessee (1-3), 10 a.m.: Steve Spurrier
never has been too popular in Knoxville. Now he tries to conquer
Nashville. By the way, past conquests of Vanderbilt don't count on
the resume. LINE: Tennessee by 5.</TE>
<TE>   * Cincinnati (0-4) at Indianapolis (2-1), 10 a.m.: Says Bengal
linebacker Takeo Spikes on winless start: "I don't know if it's the
all-time low, but it ain't too far from it." Don't sell your team so
short, Takeo. You've arrived. LINE: Indianapolis by 13 1/2.</TE>
<TE>   **** New England (3-1) at Miami (3-1), 10 a.m., KNX (1070): "We
have to fix this now," Patriot defensive lineman Steve Martin says of

to brace for two big storms the last two weeks. Now Hurricane Cowher
comes to town, but chances are it will fade into a tropical
depression. LINE: New Orleans by 3.</TE>
<TE>   ** Kansas City (2-2) at New York Jets (1-3), 1 p.m.: Hmm, let's
see ... Chiefs are NFL's highest-scoring team and Jet defense ranks
31st out of 32. Go ahead and draw your own conclusions. LINE: Kansas
City by 3.</TE>
<TE>   **** San Diego (4-0) at Denver (3-1), 1 p.m.: After what happened
to the Chargers last season in wake of 3-0 start, it's good to hear
their enthusiasm has been tempered this year. Win this one and then
you can pop off. LINE: Denver by 5 1/2.</TE>
<TE>   *** Philadelphia (3-1) at Jacksonville (2-1), 1:15 p.m.: Last week
Eagle safety Brian Dawkins caught a TD, made an interception,
recovered a fumble and recorded a sack. This week he comes home to
Jacksonville for victory party. LINE: Philadelphia by 3.</TE>
<TE>   ** St. Louis (0-4) at San Francisco (2-1), 1:15 p.m., Channel 11,
KNX (1070): Considering the opponent, it's Catch-22 week for the
49ers. If they win, people will complain that it wasn't by enough
points. If they lose, fans will turn their attention back to the
Giants. LINE: San Francisco by 7.</TE>
<TE>   *** Baltimore (1-2) at Cleveland (2-2), 5:30 p.m., ESPN: Last time
Browns were on national TV, they lost to Pittsburgh, 43-0. That, and
the fact the "old" Browns are coming to town, should provide plenty
of incentive. LINE: Cleveland by 6 1/2.</TE>
<TE>   *** Green Bay (3-1) at Chicago (2-2), Monday, 6 p.m., Channel 7:
Maddening stat of the day for Bear fans: Brett Favre is 9-1 at

what if he's never played there. LINE: Chicago by 1 1/2.</TE>

<LD>The kids are all right ... at least, that's what Mighty Duck
management is banking on.</LD>
<LD>   The Ducks, who lost, 2-1, at San Jose on Saturday, could start the
season with four rookies on their roster: forward Stanislav Chistov,
forward Alexei Smirnov, defenseman Kurt Sauer and goalie Martin
Gerber. Sauer and Gerber are already locks to make the team, with
Chistov and Smirnov likely to remain as well.</LD>
<LD>   "We're ambitious," General Manager Bryan Murray said. "These are
the players who are going to make you better as the season goes on.
They're the ones who can improve the most."</LD>
<TE>   Sauer, a 6-foot-4, 225-pound defenseman, has been the most
impressive. Where Chistov and Smirnov will fit is to be seen. They
will not play on the same line, Coach Mike Babcock said.</TE>
<TE>   Chistov scored the Ducks' only goal in a 4-1 loss to Minnesota on
Tuesday. He also took a run at Wild tough guy Matt Johnson, earning a
little respect. Smirnov has been a solid player, who could fit on a
checking line.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to see these guys play," Murray said.</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks are not gambling their season on the performance of
those two.</TE>
<TE>   "These guys will eventually have to score some goals for us,"
Murray said. "But we brought in Adam Oates, Petr Sykora and Freddy
Olausson to improve the offense."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks brought defenseman Josh DeWolf back from minor league
Cincinnati for Saturday's game as insurance in case the injuries to
defenseman Pavel Trnka (strained groin) and Vitaly Vishnevski
(strained knee) linger.</TE>
<TE>   Chris Foster</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The MGM Grand sports book lists the Kings as 20-1 shots to win the
Stanley Cup this season. But Coach Andy Murray suggests that the odds
could grow even longer if the Kings don't find some offensive support
for their top line of Jason Allison, Ziggy Palffy and Adam Deadmarsh.</TE>
<TE>   The trio combined for 80 goals last season, Palffy netting 32,
Deadmarsh 29 and Allison 19. Nobody else scored more than 15.</TE>
<TE>   "Some of our secondary offensive guys get in a comfort zone
playing pretty good defense," Murray said Saturday before the Kings
closed their exhibition schedule with a 6-5 victory over the Colorado
Avalanche in front of a sellout crowd of 11,863 in the MGM Grand
Garden at Las Vegas. "But that's not enough. We can't survive this
year having only two or three guys with more than 19 goals.</TE>
<TE>   "We've got to have some guys extend themselves, and the problem
when you extend yourself a little bit, there's a risk because you
might not do it. You might fail. And some guys are afraid to go after
it."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Avalanche, which plays the Kings on Oct. 17 at Staples Center,
is a 7-2 choice to win the Stanley Cup. The defending Stanley Cup
champion Detroit Red Wings are the favorites at 5-2 and the Mighty
Ducks are listed at 75-1.</TE>

<HD>Little Power but Lots of Glory for Irish</HD>
<DH>Nonconference: Defense again bails out struggling offense
as Notre Dame beats Stanford, 31-7, and hits the big 5-0.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS DUFRESNE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SOUTH BEND, Ind.</DL>
<LD>Notre Dame's "Return to Glory" campaign, backed by a prominent sports
magazine, the New York Times computer poll and loads of T-shirt
sales, appeared in tatters late in the third quarter with the home
team trailing unranked Stanford by four points Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   But then, almost like a movie, just when it seemed as if the
breaks might beat the boys, Notre Dame scored four lightning-strike
touchdowns in a span of 6:54 to turn a close game into a 31-7 rout
before 80,795 at Notre Dame Stadium.</LD>
<LD>   What can you say about the No. 9 Irish, who improved to 5-0 for
the first time since 1993 and continue to give new meaning to the
word "opportunism"?</LD>
<TE>   The Notre Dame defense, holding down the football fort until the
offense comes around--will it ever?--returned two second-half
interceptions for touchdowns and set up the Irish's last score with a
third interception.</TE>
<TE>   Through five games, the Irish offense has scored more touchdowns
than the defense but only barely, seven to five.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to take over every game on defense," cornerback Vontez
Duff said.</TE>
<TE>   Stanford held a slender 7-3 lead late into the third quarter when
the Irish offense finally got directions to the Stanford end zone,
driving 57 yards in six plays and taking the lead on Rashon
Powers-Neal's three-yard scoring run.</TE>
<TE>   Then came the onslaught.</TE>
<TE>   On Stanford's next possession, cornerback Shane Walton stepped in
front of Chris Lewis' pass in the right flat and returned the
interception 17 yards for a touchdown.</TE>
<TE>   That made it a 17-7 game.</TE>
<TE>   On Stanford's next possession, Lewis completed a second-down pass
from his own 26 to tight end Alex Smith, but Notre Dame linebacker
Courtney Watson ripped the ball out of Smith's arms and ran 34 yards
for a score.</TE>
<TE>   That put Notre Dame up, 24-7.</TE>
<TE>   "Now," Watson said of his play, "you've got the stadium rocking."</TE>
<TE>   Next, it was strong safety Gerome Sapp's turn. His interception of
a Lewis pass with 14:54 left set up Notre Dame's last score, Ryan
Grant's one-yard scoring run with 12:28 left.</TE>
<TE>   In a matter of minutes, just under seven, the game was over.</TE>
<TE>   "We hit a stretch in the third quarter when it all seemed to come
together," Notre Dame Coach Tyrone Willingham said.</TE>
<TE>   There was more coming together afterward, as Willingham, who
coached Stanford for seven seasons before leaving to coach Notre
Dame, stood near the end zone and hugged a succession of his former
players.</TE>
<TE>   Six former Stanford assistant coaches joined Willingham on the
Notre Dame staff.</TE>
<TE>   "Overall it was good to see them," Stanford tailback Kerry Carter
said, "even though it was hard to see them this way after a tough
loss."</TE>
<TE>   You wouldn't have blamed a few Cardinal players if they whispered
in his ear, "Wish you were back."</TE>
<TE>   Stanford fell to 1-3 and appears to be nowhere near the 9-3
program that Willingham left behind.</TE>
<TE>   Stanford Coach Buddy Teevens admitted that, in the third quarter,
"the wheels kind of came off a bit."</TE>
<TE>   You could call lucky some of what Notre Dame has done this season,
winning its last three games before Saturday by seven points or
fewer, but Willingham has no doubt brought a tenacity to the program
that was lacking under Bob Davie.</TE>
<TE>   Willingham's almost deadpan demeanor has served the Irish well in
tight situations.</TE>
<TE>   "We're never worried," said Powers-Neal, the sophomore tailback.
"He stays calm so we stay calm. It rubs off."</TE>
<TE>   Willingham knows there are miles to go before he sleeps.</TE>
<TE>   Asked for his reaction at his team being 5-0, he said, "It's too
early to have a reaction. We'll kindly take 5-0 and keep going."</TE>
<TE>   Asked if he thought his team was one of the nation's best, he
said, "I don't even have those thoughts."</TE>
<TE>   The Irish still have issues, especially on offense. Pat
Dillingham, a former walk-on, started the game for the injured
Carlyle Holiday and played just well enough to win, completing 14 of
27 passes for 129 yards, with no touchdowns and an interception.</TE>
<TE>   "We won, so I'm happy with it," Dillingham said.</TE>
<TE>   The Irish ran the ball well, amassing 249 yards. Powers-Neal had
108 yards in 13 carries and Ryan Grant added 103 in 18, yet the
offense generated only one touchdown on its own against a Stanford
defense that allowed 65 points last week to Arizona State.</TE>
<TE>   Holiday sat out Saturday's game with an injured left
(non-throwing) shoulder, and Willingham wasn't saying afterward
whether he would be ready for next week's game against Pittsburgh.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the gap in the final score, there were plenty of knotted
stomachs in the first half.</TE>
<TE>   Vontez Duff thought he had scored on a 92-yard punt return, but
the Irish were penalized for a personal foul committed against
Stanford's long-snapper, allowing the Cardinal to retain possession
at the Irish 37.</TE>
<TE>   On second and eight, Stanford ran a trick play, sort of a
wide-receiver version of the "Fumblerookskie," Lewis sandwiching the
ball between the legs of Nick Sebes, who raced 21 yards around left
end to the 14.</TE>
<TE>   From there, Lewis hit Teyo Johnson on a slant pattern for a
14-yard scoring pass with 1:38 left in the first quarter to put
Stanford up, 7-0.</TE>
<TE>   Yet, it all worked out in the end, and is there anything better
than being 5-0 at Notre Dame?</TE>
<TE>   "Being 6-0," Powers-Neal said.</TE>

<DL>FAR HILLS, N.J.</DL>
<LD>The 2008 U.S. Open was awarded to the South Course at Torrey Pines in
La Jolla by the U.S. Golf Assn. on Saturday, pending approval of the
San Diego City Council.</LD>
<LD>   It would be the second public course to play host to the
tournament. The Black Course at the Bethpage State Park in New York,
where this year's U.S. Open was played, is the only public layout to
have been the site of the championship.</LD>
<LD>   Riviera Country Club in Pacific Palisades was thought to be the
other finalist.</LD>
<TE>   The Open has been played in California nine times, most recently
at Pebble Beach in 2000. The Open was last played in Southern
California in 1948 at Riviera.</TE>
<TE>   Torrey Pines, which uses the South and North courses at its PGA
Tour event, was designed by William Bell Sr.</TE>

<LD>Onterrio Smith tied an Oregon record with his fifth consecutive
100-yard rushing game as the eighth-ranked Ducks pulled away to
defeat Arizona, 31-14, Saturday night at Tucson, Ariz. in the
conference opener for both teams.</LD>
<LD>   Smith gained 145 yards in 28 carries, including touchdown runs of
six and 10 yards, to tie the school mark set in 1971 by Ahmad Rashad,
then known as Bobby Moore.</LD>
<LD>   Jason Fife threw second-half touchdowns of 34 yards to Keenan
Howry and nine yards to Terrence Whitehead as the Ducks (5-0, 1-0)
won their 10th in a row, the second-longest streak in NCAA Division
I. Fife completed 18 of 26 passes for 244 yards and no interceptions.
He completed 11 of 12 for 138 in the second half.</LD>
<TE>   Bobby Wade, the Pac-10's leading receiver, set career highs with
12 catches and 151 yards, including a 16-yarder for a touchdown, for
Arizona (3-2, 0-1). Jason Johnson completed 24 of 41 for 302 yards
and two touchdowns. He was intercepted once.</TE>
<TE>   Keith Lewis intercepted Johnson's long pass deep in Oregon
territory midway through the third quarter. Wade knocked the ball
loose, but Garret Graham recovered for the Ducks at their 22. Oregon
went 78 yards in five plays, with Fife passing to Howry in the end
zone to put the Ducks ahead 24-14 with six minutes left in the
quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Oregon added a touchdown on Fife's nine-yard pass to Whitehead on
the first play of the fourth quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Arizona drove to the Duck two-yard line with six minutes left, but
Johnson's fourth-down pass fell incomplete.</TE>
<TE>   North Carolina 38, Arizona State 35--Darian Durant passed for
career highs of 417 yards and five touchdowns--including a
record-setting four to Chesley Borders--as the Tar Heels (2-3)
defeated the Sun Devils (4-2) in a nonconference game at Tempe, Ariz.</TE>
<TE>   Durant's five TD passes tied the school record set by Kevin
Anthony against Wake Forest in 1985. Borders broke the school mark of
three TD receptions, held by seven players and matched most recently
by L.C. Stevens against Maryland in 1996.</TE>

<LD>The Angels tied the score on a ball that skipped between a second
baseman's legs.</LD>
<LD>   That was for Bobby Grich.</LD>
<LD>   The Angels tied it again after a beach ball floated into center
field, stopping play, diverting a pitcher's attention moments before
allowing a bomb.</LD>
<TE>   That was for Brian Downing.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels scored the go-ahead run on a bloop that a charging
center fielder and retreating second baseman turned into a blooper.</TE>
<TE>   That was for all of them, bless their halo-ed, hallowed souls.</TE>
<TE>   That was for the hundreds of Angels and millions of fans whom fate
teased and tortured for 41 years of death, disillusionment and Dave
Henderson.</TE>
<TE>   On Saturday, the baseball gods paid them all back.</TE>
<TE>   With interest.</TE>
<TE>   With a four-hour roar that turned Orange County red.</TE>
<TE>   With Troy Percival thrusting his fist into the air as fireworks
crashed and players danced and demons fled.</TE>
<TE>   With a new sentence, never before written but engraved forever at
4:57 p.m. in a strange new sports capital whose gentle residents are
today pinching their Armanis and clicking their Guccis.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels win a playoff series.</TE>
<TE>   And they win it by beating arguably the greatest playoff team in
baseball history.</TE>
<TE>   Angels 9, Yankees 5, jinxes zilch.</TE>
<TE>   Angels win the American League divisional series three games to
one, curses get swept.</TE>
<TE>   Angels leave Edison Field for the American League championship
series in either Oakland or Minnesota, 1986 is thrown out the door
behind them.</TE>
<TE>   "How do I feel?" a beaming Tim Salmon asked afterward, soaked in
beer and champagne and memories. "How does it look like I feel?"</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't a World Series championship, but afterward they partied
like one, the rock-thumping clubhouse lined in plastic and cigar
smoke and relief.</TE>
<TE>   Salmon was throwing teammates in a bucket of ice. Percival was
chasing them around with beers. Everyone was sucking on stogies and
draping arms around one another and posing for photos, almost like a
collection of new fathers.</TE>
<TE>   Which, come to think of it, they were.</TE>
<TE>   "We never cared about history," said Scott Spiezio, he of the red
whiskers and pastel-smooth swing. "We're trying to rewrite history."</TE>
<TE>   It started appropriately Saturday, with a ceremonial first pitch
that was oddly and perfectly caught by a pitcher.</TE>
<TE>   It was former hard-luck shortstop Gary DiSarcina throwing to
Percival, who hugged his old friend and waved his cap and walked him
off to a standing ovation.</TE>
<TE>   "This has always been about more than just us," Percival said
later. "All those players who have been through those hard times,
they are right there with us."</TE>
<TE>   The players were introduced, as usual, to the opening strains of
"Spirit in the Sky."</TE>
<TE>   With every cuticle-biting game of this series, that song made more
sense.</TE>
<TE>   The teams then took the field and ... nothing.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels looked as tight as they did while taking five days to
clinch a playoff spot. Quick plate appearances against David Wells.
Shaky fastballs from Jarrod Washburn.</TE>
<TE>   The Yankees were inches from a three-run homer when Robin
Ventura's ball hit the top of the wall in right-center field. They
were inches from another homer when Alfonso Soriano's line drive
whacked into the wall in the left-field corner.</TE>
<TE>   By the time they took the field in the bottom of the fifth, the
Angels were lucky to be trailing only 2-1.</TE>
<TE>   But it was the Yankees who felt lucky. It was the Yankees, with
aging pitching and undisciplined hitting, who spent the entire series
looking as if they were trailing.</TE>
<TE>   Said Derek Jeter: "They were a better team. They had their way
with us."</TE>
<TE>   Said Darin Erstad: "We have been through enough tough times that
when we have a chance to do something special we're not going to lay
down and die."</TE>
<TE>   So the Angels promptly executed baseball's best inning of
postseason offense in 73 years.</TE>
<TE>   Ten hits that landed everywhere, 41 years of frustration sprinkled
across the field like so much fertilizer, Yankee Manager Joe Torre
freezing on the bench, his team wilting on the field.</TE>
<TE>   In the end, the Angels didn't just beat the Yankees, they ran them
out of town.</TE>
<TE>   In the end, the 45,067 balloon-banging fans didn't just cheer,
they derisively chanted, "Go Home, Yankees" in the same annoying clap
pattern used in the Bronx for "Let's Go, Yankees."</TE>
<TE>   Mystique and Aura have been replaced by a couple of surfer chicks
named Savvy and Steel.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't believe in curses, I don't believe in mystique, I don't
believe in any of that stuff," said Percival. "I believe only in good
baseball."</TE>
<TE>   Here's a series worth of good baseball:</TE>
<TE>   The Angel hitters were retired 1-2-3 only seven times in 34
innings.</TE>
<TE>   The Angel fielders gave up only one unearned run.</TE>
<TE>   The Angel pitchers, despite a 6.17 team ERA, held leadoff hitter
and MVP candidate Soriano to two lousy hits.</TE>
<TE>   A final step toward a World Series awaits.</TE>
<TE>   A final step from a world of hurt is completed.</TE>
<TE>   "We old guys never talked about the curse, because we never wanted
the young guys to listen," Salmon said, pointing his champagne bottle
out toward a field swept clean of everything but wide-eyed belief.
"Today, finally, we're burying those ghosts."</TE>

<HD>Twins, A's Complain About Rock-Hard Field</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>OAKLAND</DL>
<LD>When A.J. Pierzynski's grounder through the right side of the infield
rolled all the way to the right-field wall for a triple, the
Minnesota Twins' catcher had the Oakland Raiders to thank.</LD>
<LD>   The Coliseum changed dramatically when the Raiders returned to
Oakland from Los Angeles in 1995, changing a baseball-only facility
into a dual-use stadium that no longer is very baseball friendly.</LD>
<LD>   Soil erosion from Sunday's Raiders-Titans game left parts of the
outfield rock hard for the first two games of the AL division series.</LD>
<TE>   Pierzynski's RBI triple in Game 1 on Tuesday looked like a shot on
a well-worn miniature golf course that just refuses to stop.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like playing on concrete. It's incredible how fast it is.
It's almost faster than the turf in the Metrodome," Pierzynski said.</TE>
<TE>   The infield was not much better.</TE>
<TE>   "The field was horrible," said A's third baseman Eric Chavez. "I
know on TV that it didn't look that bad, but it was just awful."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   HAPPY NOT TO BE A MET: Minnesota Twins pitcher Rick Reed was
jokingly asked how much he misses playing for the New York Mets.</TE>
<TE>   He was polite in his response.</TE>
<TE>   "I would rather be here having a fabulous year," said Reed, the
starter for Friday's Game 3 against Oakland in the AL division
series.</TE>
<TE>   He was traded from the Mets on July 30, 2001. New York had an
embarrassing 2002 season that ended with a 75-86 record. The Mets
were last in the NL East for the first time since 1993 and finished
below .500 for the first time in six years. Manager Bobby Valentine
was fired Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Reed is happy he's still with Minnesota this season.</TE>
<TE>   "I am glad things worked out the way they did," said Reed, who
played on the Mets' 2000 World Series team. "I guess I got used to
the New York lifestyle. I mean, I am not the kind of guy that goes
out and stays out in bars all the time. My wife and I, we got used to
it, we loved New York, and right now we are getting to love
Minnesota."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   DARK SHADOWS: Outfielders for the A's and Twins struggled to pick
up fly balls in the glaring sun in the first two games of the
division series, and hitters battled late-inning shadows at the
Coliseum.</TE>
<TE>   The starting time of the games was not unusual--both began shortly
after 1 p.m.--but the position of the sun in early October caused
problems.</TE>
<TE>   Oakland center fielder Terrence Long fell while catching a fly
ball in the eighth inning of Tuesday's series opener, and Minnesota's
Torii Hunter went to his knees to snare a fly moments later.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought I was dead. The sun was deadly out there. I lost it
completely and I could never refind it. I just put up my glove to
protect myself," Hunter said.</TE>
<TE>   For hitters, it was tough seeing pitches that started on a sunny
mound and ended in the shadows around the plate. That made it crucial
to score runs early.</TE>
<TE>   "I could see the eighth and ninth innings were going to be
affected by the shadows, and I was hoping we could get some runs
before that took place," A's manager Art Howe said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   MORALE BOOSTER: A late rally had the Atlanta Braves feeling better
about themselves, even though they lost Game 1 of the NL division
series.</TE>
<TE>   Trailing 8-2, Gary Sheffield hit a solo homer and Javy Lopez added
a two-run shot in the eighth inning to get the Braves close.</TE>
<TE>   In the ninth, Atlanta put the first two runners on against Giants
closer Robb Nen, but Julio Franco flied out and Sheffield grounded
into a game-ending double play.</TE>
<TE>   "Hitting a home run in the postseason is the best thing you can
do, especially when your team is trying to rally to win the game,"
said Lopez, who got a second chance when San Francisco catcher Benito
Santiago dropped a popup.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't come out with a win," Lopez added, "but we'll take this
good feeling with us into tomorrow's game."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   GIANTS ROTATION: While the Braves are going with a three-man
rotation in the opening round of the playoffs, San Francisco plans to
use four starters.</TE>
<TE>   Livan Hernandez (12-16, 4.38 ERA) is scheduled to pitch Game 4 at
Pac Bell Park on Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   "That's the plan," manager Dusty Baker said. "But we could change
our minds."</TE>
<TE>   Russ Ortiz pitched well in Wednesday's opener, won by the Giants
8-5. Kirk Rueter will go in Game 2, followed by Jason Schmidt when
the series shifts to San Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   Hernandez is best remembered for a three-hit, 15-strikeout
performance while pitching for Florida against the Braves in the 1997
NL championship series. He was named MVP of the both the NLCS and the
World Series.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   JOB SEARCH: Yankees third-base coach Willie Randolph had a
three-hour interview Wednesday with Detroit general manager Dave
Dombrowski about the Tigers' managerial opening.</TE>
<TE>   Randolph met at a Manhattan hotel with Dombrowski and four of his
assistants, including Al Kaline and Willie Horton about the opening
before New York played Game 2 of the AL division series against
Anaheim.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll wait and see what happens," Randolph said. "It was a very
productive day."</TE>
<TE>   The Tigers fired Luis Pujols on Monday after he was 55-100 after
replacing Phil Garner in April.</TE>
<TE>   The Tigers will also interview San Diego Padres first-base coach
Alan Trammell, a former star shortstop with the Tigers; Bruce Fields,
who managed at Triple-A Toledo the past two seasons; and Oakland
bench coach Ken Macha.</TE>
<TE>   Randolph estimates that he has interviewed for six or seven
openings in recent years.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been through it before," Randolph said. "I'm comfortable
with the process."</TE>

<LD>Joe Torre stood, transfixed, leaning against the rail of the
visitor's dugout.</LD>
<LD>   He stared at Angel Manager Mike Scioscia.</LD>
<LD>   He watched a pile of ecstatic Angels envelop pitcher Troy
Percival.</LD>
<TE>   He saw a team of young, confident, talented, wide-eyed,
hard-working, smart, mostly anonymous men who had just accomplished
something great and surprising. They had beaten the Yankees, 9-5, and
won the series, 3-1. The Angels are moving on to the American League
championship series.</TE>
<TE>   And Torre thought back six years ago, to the 1996 Yankees, to
young, confident, talented, wide-eyed, hard-working, smart, mostly
anonymous men who won a World Series and started a glorious run of
four championships in six years.</TE>
<TE>   The run is over. Probably for good for many of this group.</TE>
<TE>   Having blown leads in the last three games of this American League
division series, having had its pitching staff whacked around, having
its defense become fumble-fingered, its high-priced, midseason
acquisitions become meaningless, having watched his team, the mighty,
mighty Yankees, become querulous whiners with the umpires, Torre
looked ahead squeamishly.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously," he said, "all of us aren't going to be back in the
spring. But hopefully the experience here will help whoever is back."</TE>
<TE>   Yankee owner George Steinbrenner wasn't here. But he wasn't happy.
Everybody knows that. Steinbrenner would not find invigorating the
refrain that came from the New York clubhouse.</TE>
<TE>   The Yankees won 103 games this year.</TE>
<TE>   That's what they kept saying.</TE>
<TE>   "We won 103 games," General Manager Brian Cashman said.</TE>
<TE>   "We won 103 games and you want to tear us apart?" pitcher David
Wells said.</TE>
<TE>   "We won 103 games and I'd say that's good enough to win a
championship," pitcher Andy Pettitte said.</TE>
<TE>   Steinbrenner isn't going to care about the 103 wins. He's only
going to care about these three consecutive losses. To a team that
had never won a playoff series. Steinbrenner considers it a failure
if the Yankees don't win the World Series.</TE>
<TE>   But so many of them wanted to tell us everything is OK because
winning 103 games means things aren't so bad.</TE>
<TE>   Derek Jeter, who had said defiantly a year ago when the Yankees
lost in Game 7 of the World Series that "it feels like failure," sat
in front of his locker in the visitor's clubhouse at Edison Field and
said he didn't see the need for major reconstruction.</TE>
<TE>   "I mean, we won 103 games," Jeter said.</TE>
<TE>   But for the first time since 1997, the mighty Yankees were
eliminated from the playoffs in the division series.</TE>
<TE>   They were eliminated in emphatic fashion, getting pushed around
Saturday afternoon, standing flummoxed while the Angels posted an
eight-run fifth inning, watching a pitching staff Torre called his
best ever, get hammered over and over, starters and relievers, young
and old.</TE>
<TE>   Roger Clemens, 40; Pettitte, 30; Mike Mussina, who turns 34 in
December, and Wells, 39, were made to look like the old guys in the
softball league down the street. In 17 1/3 innings pitched, they
threw 308 pitches, gave up 32 hits and 20 runs. Twenty runs.</TE>
<TE>   "To be honest," Pettitte said, "with the way we relied on home
runs, I was a little worried about our offense going into the
playoffs. But our offense was great. If we score four, five runs, in
the past, we won those games."</TE>
<TE>   In the past, a lot of things happened. The Yankees won four world
championships over the last six years and, as usual, Steinbrenner
spent prodigiously to buy whatever he thought he needed this year.</TE>
<TE>   Extra pitching? Welcome, Jeff Weaver, Detroit's ace. Extra hitting
and fielding? Come on down, Raul Mondesi.</TE>
<TE>   Steinbrenner personally signed Wells last winter after the Arizona
Diamondbacks thought they had the portly pitcher committed to them.
Wells had an 8-1 postseason record. Steinbrenner wanted that. Even
before his disastrous fifth inning, Wells made an ugly error in the
fourth when Tim Salmon dribbled a nothing ball to Wells. He picked it
up and whizzed it down the right-field line. Salmon ended up on
second. He didn't score, but Wells' composure seemed fragile after
that.</TE>
<TE>   Second baseman Alfonso Soriano, who will finish high in the AL
most-valuable-player voting, seemed awed by the circumstances of the
playoffs this year. He hit .118 and committed a damaging error in the
third inning, booting a certain double-play ball that allowed the
first Angel run to score and seemed to spark the Anaheim ignition.</TE>
<TE>   "It just bounced high," Soriano said. "I just did not have my good
series here."</TE>
<TE>   Neither did catcher Jorge Posada (.235). Mondesi hit .250 and made
more bad plays than good in right field. While the bottom of the
Angel order provided hits, runs and power, the bottom of the Yankee
order provided many rally-killing outs.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think it was a failure," Cashman said. "We have a lot of
strength and a couple of weaknesses. What it came down to was, we
didn't play our best baseball this week. And if you don't play your
best, you're going to get beat. Pitching makes or breaks a team.
Usually it makes us. This time it didn't."</TE>
<TE>   Wells, who gave up eight runs and 10 hits in his 4 2/3 innings,
talked for 40 minutes after the game. Over and over he mentioned the
103 wins. All credit to the Angels, he said. And don't tell him about
numbers, Wells said. He didn't want to hear about ERAs or innings
pitched or when the last time the Yankees had done this or that bad
thing.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know numbers," Wells said. "I just know that everything
ends. It was gonna happen sometime. We were going to lose early. So
it's happened. So what? Are we bad now? We won 103 games."</TE>

<HD>Sixth Overtime Is the Charm for No. 10 Tennessee</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>KNOXVILLE, Tenn.</DL>
<LD>Tennessee Coach Phillip Fulmer said a lack of discipline and youthful
mistakes were keeping the No. 10 Volunteers from playing their best.
He had nothing to complain about Saturday night.</LD>
<LD>   Jason Witten caught a 25-yard touchdown pass from Casey Clausen in
the sixth overtime to give Tennessee (4-1, 1-1) an exhausting 41-38
victory over Arkansas.</LD>
<LD>   "This is the type of game that jells a football team. I am excited
about the way we played," he said. "We had the heart and the guts to
take it to them."</LD>
<TE>   For the Razorbacks (2-2, 0-2), who beat Mississippi, 58-57, in a
record-setting seven-overtime game last season, it was a
heart-wrenching loss.</TE>
<TE>   They pushed into the final overtime but had to settle for a
47-yard field goal by David Carlton in the sixth extra period before
the Vols got their last chance.</TE>
<TE>   "When it went into overtime, I said, 'This is our game. We're
ready,' " Arkansas Coach Houston Nutt said. "This was bitter, bitter.
There were a lot of times we outplayed them."</TE>
<TE>   The teams kicked field goals in the first two overtimes and were
held scoreless in the third.</TE>
<TE>   Arkansas finally scored a touchdown in the fourth, on Matt Jones'
run, but the Razorbacks couldn't convert the two-point conversion.
Under NCAA rules, teams must go for two points after touchdowns
starting with the third overtime.</TE>
<TE>   Tennessee scored a touchdown on Clausen's 25-yard pass to Tony
Brown, but the Vols also failed on the two-point conversion attempt.</TE>
<TE>   Jabari Davis, who scored two touchdowns in regulation, ran from 12
yards out to start the fifth overtime for Tennessee. He fumbled, but
the ball was recovered in the end zone by Troy Fleming. Clausen was
then stopped on the conversion attempt.</TE>
<TE>   De'Arrius Howard scored a touchdown for Arkansas, but a pass
attempt on the conversion attempt was intercepted by Tennessee's
Julian Battle at the goal line.</TE>
<TE>   Arkansas scored two touchdowns in a 4 1/2-minute span of
regulation to tie the score at 17 with 3:30 left.</TE>
<TE>   The Razorbacks trailed, 17-3, after Davis scored on a 58-yard
touchdown run a minute into the fourth quarter. Arkansas got the ball
back, drove 60 yards and scored when Howard had a 10-yard run.</TE>
<TE>   Arkansas scored next when Jones passed to Richard Smith at the 40,
and Smith ran down the sideline untouched to the end zone for a
92-yard touchdown to tie it.</TE>
<TE>   "The coaches have told us never to quit, and we were down seven at
our own eight, I kept thinking about that," Jones said.</TE>
<TE>   Clausen completed 19 of 28 passes for 291 yards and two
touchdowns.</TE>
<TE>   The Razorbacks lost their fifth consecutive game in Knoxville.</TE>
<TE>   Mississippi 17, No. 6 Florida 14--Matt Grier returned the second
of his two third-quarter interceptions 24 yards for the go-ahead
touchdown and the Rebels shut out the sixth-ranked Gators in the
second half at Oxford, Miss.</TE>
<TE>   Mississippi (4-1, 2-0) defeated a top 10 team for the first time
since 1997, when it beat No. 8 LSU on the road.</TE>
<TE>   The Gators (4-2, 2-1) found themselves in a defensive struggle as
Rex Grossman had four passes that were intercepted. He was 19 of 41
for 205 yards and two touchdowns.</TE>
<TE>   Eli Manning was 18 for 33 for 154 yards, and for the first time in
his career he didn't throw a touchdown pass as a starter. But he did
become the first member of his family to beat the Gators. His
brother, Peyton, was 0-4 against Florida while at Tennessee.</TE>
<TE>   No. 21 Louisiana State 48, Louisiana Lafayette 0--Matt Mauck threw
three first-half touchdown passes to lead the Tigers (4-1) at Baton
Rouge, La. LSU gave up only six first downs to the Ragin' Cajuns
(1-4). LSU scored 41 points in the first half, the most first-half
points for LSU since the Tigers scored 42 against Akron on Sept. 27,
1997.</TE>
<TE>   South Carolina 34, Mississippi State 10--Corey Jenkins threw for
one touchdown and ran for another as the Gamecocks (4-2, 2-1) beat
the Bulldogs (1-4, 0-3) at Columbia, S.C. South Carolina held
Mississippi State to 97 yards of offense in the first half and did
enough after halftime to win their third consecutive game.</TE>
<TE>   Jenkins, a 26-year-old player who was a former first-round pick of
the Boston Red Sox, had a 16-yard run as part of an 89-yard
first-quarter drive that ended with Andrew Pinnock's one-yard
touchdown run.</TE>

<HD>Bennett Kicks Georgia Past Alabama</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>TUSCALOOSA, Ala.</DL>
<LD>In the end, the smallest man on the field showed just how tough
Georgia really is.</LD>
<LD>   Billy Bennett kicked a 32-yard field goal with 38 seconds left as
the seventh-ranked Bulldogs blew a 12-point fourth quarter lead and
recovered to beat No. 22 Alabama, 27-25, Saturday in a Southeastern
Conference game.</LD>
<LD>   "I was just thinking that we do this in practice everyday," said
Bennett, who is 5-feet-8, 168 pounds. "I saw time running down and I
thought, 'Oh goodness, this is coming down to me.' "</LD>
<TE>   Thomas Davis intercepted Brodie Croyle's pass on the next play
from scrimmage to seal the win for Georgia (5-0, 2-0), the last
unbeaten team in the conference.</TE>
<TE>   The Bulldogs are off to their first 5-0 start since 1982 and ended
a seven-game losing streak in Tuscaloosa.</TE>
<TE>   "It's just a great victory," Georgia Coach Mark Richt said. "I'm
proud to be with a group of men that made some history here."</TE>
<TE>   Alabama (4-2, 1-1) scored two touchdowns in a 63-second span
midway through the fourth to take their first lead, 25-24, with 8:24
left. Croyle was stopped short on the subsequent two-point conversion
attempt.</TE>
<TE>   Both teams couldn't do much with their next possessions, but
Georgia got the ball back after Damien Gary's 15-yard punt return at
the Alabama 34 with 3:45 left.</TE>
<TE>   Georgia's Musa Smith rushed six consecutive times for 19 yards
against the SEC's top run defense, setting up Bennett's kick.</TE>

<LD>As we know now, George Steinbrenner spent $135 million on a bunch of
players who can't maintain intensity in the first round of the
playoffs after posting the best regular-season record, and I would
imagine right now George is trying to figure out a way to monopolize
the "Thunder Stick" market.</LD>
<LD>   You arm 50,000 to 60,000 New York wackos with clubs and have them
bang them together, and that might get the attention of those Yankee
millionaires. Oh well, the Yankees haven't heard this too often, but
they'll have to wait until next year.</LD>
<LD>   That's right, the baseball season continues in Anaheim, while it's
over in New York, and holy contraction, is this a great sport or
what?</LD>
<TE>   All these years, and we thought Disney was trying to kill off the
Angels with a measly $60-million payroll, only to discover it was
preparing the guys to become the "never-say-die" overachievers it
would take to perform a national service, and keep the Yankees out of
the World Series.</TE>
<TE>   In the clubhouse, Disney honcho Michael Eisner, dressed in Angel
cap and T-shirt, stood drenched in champagne, which I presume he
poured over his own head. Eisner gushed that it was a great day for
the Autry family and Team Disney and said winning will attract more
calls from bidders interested in buying the team.</TE>
<TE>   I told him he never returns telephone calls, so how would he know,
and for some reason the interview went downhill after that.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   ANYONE WHO watched this series is probably going to tell you the
Angels won "because there is no quit in these guys."</TE>
<TE>   Just think if the Choking Dogs had tried that approach--we'd still
have the chance to watch a Freeway World Series.</TE>
<TE>   If the key to the Angels' success is "there is no quit in these
guys," then they acquired it this year, because they lost 19 of their
final 21 last season. I just wish someone had suggested not quitting
sometime in the last 41 years, so it didn't take so long for this
franchise to win a postseason series.</TE>
<TE>   I guess the conclusion we can draw from all this is that there is
some quit in the Yankees because they lost. I know Bernie Williams
gave up on a fly ball that second baseman Alfonso Soriano misplayed,
and Manager Joe Torre was slow to remove pitchers in trouble
throughout this series. I suspect they realized there was no quit in
the Angels, so why bother?</TE>
<TE>   Most of us who are familiar with the Lakers have a tough time
grasping this concept of "there's no quit in these guys," because the
Lakers usually don't give it their all until March, and still win the
ring.</TE>
<TE>   I guess you could go back to ancient history and a time when the
Dodgers refused to quit, in 1988, which coincidentally is the last
time they won a playoff game. In fact, I was going to suggest having
Mike Scioscia talk to the guys about a time when the Dodgers never
quit, and maybe even throw on a uniform to see what he'd look like as
Dodger manager, but I'm afraid he wouldn't fit into Jim Tracy's
uniform.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   NOW THAT we know there is no quit in the Angels, it pretty well
guarantees a World Series celebration for the Halos. (That reminds
me, they've painted "The Halos are back" on top of the Edison Field
dugouts, and how can you come back when you've never been there?)</TE>
<TE>   The parade will probably start or finish at Disneyland, and start
or finish at California Adventure with half the kids in the crowd
holding Rally Monkeys, and the other half beating the little furry
critter over the head with their Thunder Sticks. And knowing kids,
and the way they behave, I suspect there will be no quit in the ones
swinging the Thunder Sticks.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   THE SCREAMER, who was doing the broadcasting on the Angels' radio
network, yelled after Friday night's 9-6 win that this was the first
playoff game in Anaheim in 16 years, and for the fans, it was "well
worth the wait." I'm sure that's what every Angel fan has been
thinking the last 16 years--I'll wait forever to watch a playoff game
in Anaheim, if it means seeing one exciting victory.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I VISITED the Clippers in Palm Desert and watched as Quentin
Richardson became the latest key player to get hurt, and then chatted
with Coach Alvin Gentry, who pronounced the team a playoff contender.
As soon as I get the dates, I'll let you know when Gentry is
appearing at the Comedy Club.</TE>
<TE>   Utah, the eighth and final qualifier for a playoff spot in the
West last season, finished with 44 wins.</TE>
<TE>   "I would say we could win 45 games--up from 39 last year, which
would be a 10% improvement," Gentry said, and if you don't tell the
players that a 10% improvement would mean only 43 wins this year and
missing the playoffs, I won't.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   SO ERIC Karros goes under the knife to repair a sore shoulder and
the next day he gets another one stuck in his back with GM Dan Evans
saying, "We're contemplating things to get better, and one thing we
need is more power at first base. Thirteen homers are not enough....
If that means we have to find someone to share time with [Karros], we
have to do that." Ouch.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   THE ARREST of Raider kicker Sebastian Janikowski for driving under
the influence with a blood-alcohol count twice the legal limit is
another reminder why we don't need an NFL team. The streets are safer
with fewer pro athletes in town.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   THE 2008 U.S. Open was awarded to Torrey Pines on Saturday rather
than Riviera. Everyone knows how tough the rough is at Riviera, while
an errant shot at Torrey might find the nude beach.</TE>
<TE>   I wonder why they picked Torrey over Riviera.</TE>

<LD>If someone wants to put together a father-daughter volleyball
tournament, one of the favorites to win would be the Fishburns, Andy
and Jessica.</LD>
<LD>   "I think we'd have a good chance to be unbeatable," Andy said.</LD>
<LD>   Andy is 47 and looks as fit in shorts as he did nine years ago,
when he stopped competing professionally after winning 20 pro beach
tournaments.</LD>
<TE>   Daughter Jessica, 15, is an outside hitter at Brentwood School.</TE>
<TE>   "Volleyball is my life," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Before she could walk, her parents would bring her to the beach
for Andy's matches.</TE>
<TE>   "I remember being distracted by her crying in the middle of a
match," Andy said.</TE>
<TE>   Since she was 3, Jessica has been receiving training from her
father.</TE>
<TE>   "He taught me everything I know," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Jessica has become one of the top sophomores in the state. As a
freshman, she helped Brentwood reach the Southern Section Division
IV-A final and was chosen co-player of the year in the Delphic
League. This season, she has led the Eagles to an 8-0 start.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, she won her first beach tournament, which created an
emotional moment for her teary-eyed father.</TE>
<TE>   "I was so happy for this little girl growing up," he said. "It's
an absolute passion for her, and it was for me. Watching your child
excel in sports is about as meaningful a thing you can do. It's so
fun."</TE>
<TE>   What's impressive about the Fishburns is that no one forgets where
sports fit in. They're second, behind academics. Andy was a
straight-A student at North Hollywood Harvard, now Harvard-Westlake,
in the 1970s, went to Yale for two years, then Stanford.</TE>
<TE>   Jessica is matching her dad in the straight-A competition, and her
older brother, Mike, who doesn't play sports, also is a good student.</TE>
<TE>   Andy, who's 6 feet 3, was such a dominant player that he helped
Yale make its first and only NCAA Final Four appearance in 1975. He
played on the beach tour for 14 years, winning world championships in
1980 and 1984.</TE>
<TE>   Chris Marlowe, who competed against Andy in beach tournaments,
calls him "one of the top players of his era."</TE>
<TE>   Andy has gone on to work behind a desk and wear collared shirts as
a senior vice president for CarrAmerica Realty Corp.</TE>
<TE>   But he still finds time to play volleyball at the Beach Club in
Santa Monica. When he plays on the same team as his 6-foot daughter,
Jessica is the one barking out orders.</TE>
<TE>   "She yells at him to move," mother Michelle said.</TE>
<TE>   Jessica has inherited her father's competitiveness, so much that
she has been known to sulk in the locker room after losing a match to
him.</TE>
<TE>   "He's the one person I really want to beat," she said. "He's where
I'm trying to get, or above him."</TE>
<TE>   Jessica possesses a terrific jump serve and has solid passing
skills. She has prided herself on becoming an all-around player,
something that the beach game requires.</TE>
<TE>   "I've always been a believer that the beach game hones your skills
because you have to do everything," Andy said.</TE>
<TE>   Watching his daughter play is more nerve-racking for Andy than
when he was playing for money.</TE>
<TE>   "It revives my desire to play, but I did as much as I wanted in
sports and it's not like I'm trying to re-create my life through
her," he said. "She's always had this great desire to play. I've
never had to ask her. She asks me."</TE>
<TE>   Jessica has focused so much on volleyball that it forced her to
give up other interests, such as playing piano, singing in a chorus
and playing goalie for the soccer team.</TE>
<TE>   Andy worries about the emphasis on specialization in high school.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's bad to expect kids at this age to specialize so
young, but the bar has been raised," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Brentwood Coach Jeff Porter said he believes Jessica could develop
into the best player in school history.</TE>
<TE>   "She's the real deal," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Jessica is determined to achieve excellence.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm so into sports it's incredible," she said. "It's my life."</TE>

<HD>Some Quick-Change Artistry Lifts Bruins</HD>
<DH>College football: UCLA erases early 14-0 deficit and beats
Oregon State, 43-35, in Pac-10 opener.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE HENSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>CORVALLIS, Ore.</DL>
<LD>Adversity came early for UCLA, the way a man steps out of bed and
trips on the dog, then regroups only to spill coffee on his tie.</LD>
<LD>   Tough start, but the rest of the day awaits, doesn't it?</LD>
<LD>   There is plenty of time for atonement in a football game too, as
the Bruins discovered in a rollicking 43-35 victory over Oregon State
on Saturday.</LD>
<TE>   UCLA trailed by two touchdowns and lost its starting tailback six
minutes into the game.</TE>
<TE>   "We're fighters," tight end Mike Seidman said. "They had a sudden
change but eventually we changed things for good."</TE>
<TE>   "Sudden change" is a favored phrase of Bruin coaches, meaning a
big play that brings the jolt of a triple espresso.</TE>
<TE>   Beaver Coach Dennis Erickson calls them "hammers," and his team
had two--an 80-yard run by Steven Jackson on the game's first
scrimmage play and an 83-yard return of a blocked field goal five
minutes later.</TE>
<TE>   UCLA punted on its next two possessions and the crowd of 35,529
was braced for another Beaver cleaver.</TE>
<TE>   Then, all of a sudden, change.</TE>
<TE>   Suddenly, Bruin receiver Tab Perry's 25-yard catch led to a field
goal and Seidman's 24-yard catch-and-run with a screen pass scored a
touchdown, triggering a career-best passing day by quarterback Cory
Paus.</TE>
<TE>   Suddenly, linebacker Marcus Reese tackled Jackson for a safety one
play after UCLA failed to score on fourth down, cutting the deficit
to 14-12 at halftime.</TE>
<TE>   Suddenly, Paus rattled off four consecutive completions and Tyler
Ebell scored from five yards to complete a whirlwind eight-play,
81-yard drive to begin the second half and hand the Bruins a lead
they wouldn't lose.</TE>
<TE>   Suddenly, Ricky Manning Jr. returned an interception 33 yards for
a touchdown to stretch the lead to 16 points.</TE>
<TE>   Suddenly, Ebell raced 73 and 35 yards to set up fourth-quarter
touchdowns that answered Oregon State scores.</TE>
<TE>   And just like that--presto, change-o--UCLA (4-1, 1-0) had won its
Pacific 10 Conference opener and notched its third win without a loss
on the road.</TE>
<TE>   It's too early to pop corks, but the superlatives flowed.</TE>
<TE>   "There were a lot of great individual performances," Coach Bob
Toledo said. "Cory Paus did a tremendous job. Tyler Ebell went in and
just did a fantastic job. Tab Perry had an outstanding game and Mike
Seidman was fantastic."</TE>
<TE>   Paus passed for 378 yards, completing 24 of 32 passes with no
interceptions. He boosted himself into second place behind Cade
McNown on the Bruin career passing yardage list.</TE>
<TE>   Seidman, a senior, had eight catches for 138 yards, eclipsing last
week's then-career-high totals of six for 134 against San Diego
State. Perry, a junior, had seven catches for 145 yards, both career
bests.</TE>
<TE>   The diminutive Ebell proved quicker than e-mail, rushing for 203
yards in three quarters. A redshirt freshman who emerged as a
dangerous punt returner in recent games, Ebell played tailback only
because Manuel White was sidelined with a strained hamstring.</TE>
<TE>   The Bruins amassed 625 yards, the most since 1998 and ninth most
in school history. And they kept the ball like a pit bull holds a
bone, keeping it for more than 40 minutes and running 86 offensive
plays.</TE>
<TE>   "They had the ball forever," Erickson said. "They wore us down.
They are very big on the offensive front and that little back ran
well."</TE>
<TE>   After taking the 14-0 lead, Oregon State (4-2, 0-2) did not score
on its next nine possessions. Jackson, the leading rusher in the
Pac-10, gained only 24 yards in 14 carries after the 80-yard run.</TE>
<TE>   "That play was a fluke," linebacker Brandon Chillar said. "We felt
confident it wouldn't happen again."</TE>
<TE>   Beaver quarterback Derek Anderson completed only 16 of 41 passes
and had two intercepted.</TE>
<TE>   Bruin linebacker Spencer Havner appeared to have sealed the
victory with an interception with 3:42 to play and UCLA leading,
43-28, but he fumbled during the return and Oregon State recovered.</TE>
<TE>   It marked the first time all season UCLA lost a fumble.</TE>
<TE>   The second time came moments later when a fumble by tailback Akil
Harris was caught in the air by Beaver defensive end Noah Happe and
returned 19 yards for a touchdown with 2:09 to play.</TE>
<TE>   But Perry recovered an onside kick and Ebell made a first down in
two carries, enabling UCLA to run out the clock and overcome a shabby
fourth quarter filled with penalties, fumbles and one particularly
dubious coaching decision.</TE>
<TE>   Nursing a 29-14 lead one minute into the fourth quarter, UCLA
inexplicably went for it on fourth and one near midfield. Paus was
stopped on a sneak and Oregon State quickly went 51 yards for a
touchdown.</TE>
<TE>   Ebell bailed out Toledo two plays after the Beaver score when he
broke loose on the 73-yard run, setting up a one-yard touchdown run
by Harris.</TE>
<TE>   "It was one of those deals where we didn't make it," Toledo said
of the fourth-down call. "We could have got out of the [next] series
all right but we jumped offsides on the punt and they scored a
touchdown."</TE>
<TE>   All five UCLA penalties came in the second half. Mike Saffer and
Dave Ball were called for personal fouls, and Ball was ejected.</TE>
<TE>   "I was disappointed in the penalties," Toledo said. "You have to
have discipline in this game, and we lost a little of our poise and
discipline."</TE>
<TE>   Occurring as it did in the fourth quarter of a game the Bruins led
handily, the unraveling was not terribly costly. Paus preferred to
recall the poise his team displayed when Oregon State jumped out to
its early lead.</TE>
<TE>   "I just stayed on everybody and said, 'Don't worry about it. We're
going to be all right,' " he said. "After a while, our defense played
awfully well.</TE>
<TE>   "The offense started clicking and I could tell things were going
to change."</TE>
<TE>   Suddenly.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   (BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOXES)</TE>
<TE>   Starts and Fits</TE>
<TE>   Coach Bob Toledo's UCLA football teams started the season under
.500 only twice through five games, but recently have had
difficulties finishing strong:</TE>
<TE>*--*
Year  Start  Finish
1996  2-3    5-6
1997  3-2    10-2
1998  5-0    10-2
1999  2-3    4-7
2000  4-1    6-6
2001  5-0    7-4
2002  4-1</TE>
<TE>*--*</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   KEYS TO THE GAME</TE>
<TE>   Steve Henson's keys to the game and how the Bruins measured up:</TE>
<TE>   1. Take advantage of injuries to the Oregon State offensive line
and pressure quarterback Derek Anderson: Brandon Chillar, Asi Faoa
and Dave Ball each sacked Anderson, who also had to hurry several
passes and had two intercepted. Anderson threw two touchdown passes
to give him 17 this season but completed only 16 of 41 passes.</TE>
<TE>   2. Quarterback Cory Paus must play relatively mistake-free against
a Beaver defense that averages 2.4 interceptions a game: Paus was
more than mistake-free, throwing for a career-high 378 yards with no
interceptions and a touchdown. He completed 24 of 32 passes and used
nine different receivers.</TE>
<TE>   3. Maintain poise in a hostile road environment and commit fewer
penalties and turnovers than Oregon State: UCLA displayed great poise
in coming back from a 14-0 deficit. Neither team had a penalty in the
first half, but the Bruins lost their composure at times in the
fourth quarter and finished with five penalties. Each team had two
turnovers.</TE>

<HD>Leisle Has Stress Fracture</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE HENSON and ROBYN NORWOOD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>CORVALLIS, Ore.</DL>
<LD>One Bruin didn't have a spring in his step after the victory over
Oregon State.</LD>
<LD>   Defensive tackle Rodney Leisle was hobbling on crutches. He
suffered a stress fracture in his right foot and is expected to be
sidelined for several games.</LD>
<LD>   The foot had been bothering him for a couple weeks.</LD>
<TE>   "It was a stress reaction to begin with and I finally broke it,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   Sean Phillips and Ryan Boschetti will replace Leisle, who is
considered the Bruins' best defensive lineman.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Leisle won't be the only Bruin defensive lineman sitting out when
the game against Oregon begins next Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   Dave Ball was ejected with 8:56 to play after throwing a punch at
an Oregon State player.</TE>
<TE>   Under Pacific 10 Conference rules, Ball, a junior who leads the
Bruins with three sacks, must sit out the first half against Oregon.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to do a better job of keeping our poise," Coach Bob
Toledo said. "Football is an emotional game, but there is a line you
can't cross."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Mike Saffer did not inform coaches until about an hour before the
game that he could play despite having a broken rib. But in his
heart, he'd known all week.</TE>
<TE>   Saffer, a Bruin senior, played every snap at right tackle.</TE>
<TE>   "I felt all week I'd play," he said. "I knew from the word go."</TE>
<TE>   He played well, helping the Bruins rack up 625 yards, but lost his
cool once. He was flagged for a personal foul after retaliating
against linebacker Richard Seigler. "The guy gave me a shot to the
ribs," Saffer said. "I didn't like that."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Manuel White, making his first start at tailback this season,
suffered a strained hamstring in the first quarter and left after
gaining seven yards in five carries.</TE>
<TE>   White also caught a screen pass, turning it into a 28-yard play.</TE>
<TE>   Akil Harris, the starting tailback in the first four games this
season, wasn't the choice to take over after White left the game.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, Tyler Ebell carried the bulk of the load and Harris got
only 12 carries, picking up 25 yards and scoring two short
touchdowns.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't know what was up. But when they called my number I was
in there," Harris said.</TE>
<TE>   He didn't help his cause when he fumbled inside the 20 with just
over two minutes left. Oregon State's Noah Happe returned the fumble
for a touchdown that cut the lead to eight.</TE>
<TE>   "Just a feeling of disbelief," said Harris, whose feeling turned
to relief after the Bruins recovered Oregon State's onside kick and
held on to win.</TE>
<TE>   "Akil scored two touchdowns and did some nice things," Toledo
said. "I wish he hadn't fumbled. He just needs to focus more. He'll
[continue to] play."</TE>

<HD>Here He Comes to Save UCLA's Day</HD>
<DH>College football: Ebell, Bruins' Mighty Mouse tailback,
replaces White and burns Oregon State with 203 yards rushing and a
touchdown.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBYN NORWOOD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>CORVALLIS, Ore.</DL>
<LD>Tyler Ebell raised his left sleeve to reveal his tattoo.</LD>
<LD>   Mighty Mouse.</LD>
<LD>   Small but powerful. That's Ebell.</LD>
<TE>   He is no more than 5 feet 9 and 170 pounds, a redshirt freshman
who was averaging just over three carries a game until Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   He finished with an astonishing 203 yards against Oregon
State--the 14th-best rushing game in UCLA history and the second-best
ever by a Bruin freshman. Only Eric Ball, who ran for 227 as a
freshman in the 1986 Rose Bowl, had more.</TE>
<TE>   UCLA hadn't had even a 100-yard rusher yet this season.</TE>
<TE>   Against Oregon State, Manuel White earned his first start over
Akil Harris--only to leave the field with a hamstring injury after
five carries.</TE>
<TE>   Enter Ebell, who came out of the blue to become the only UCLA back
besides DeShaun Foster to break 200 yards since 1995.</TE>
<TE>   "He brought electricity," Coach Bob Toledo said. "Tyler Ebell did
a fantastic job."</TE>
<TE>   Suddenly, he looks like the new starter.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll wait until Monday," Toledo said, hedging slightly.
"Certainly he's going to play a lot."</TE>
<TE>   Ebell was a workhorse against the Beavers, carrying the ball 29
times and scoring one touchdown on a five-yard run. He also broke a
73-yard run to the Oregon State one-yard line in the fourth quarter,
setting up a crucial touchdown in the Bruins' 43-35 victory.</TE>
<TE>   "I mean, I tried to get to the end zone. Unfortunately I didn't,"
said Ebell, who was brought down just shy of the goal line.</TE>
<TE>   Some people thought one of the officials got in the way. Ebell
said he didn't even see him.</TE>
<TE>   "You know what, I didn't, actually. I just see flashes," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Then he thought a moment.</TE>
<TE>   "Yeah ... he got in my way," Ebell said, grinning.</TE>
<TE>   Ebell set national records with 4,495 yards rushing and 64 rushing
touchdowns as a Ventura High senior and was the West regional winner
of the high school Heisman Trophy--an award that was presented to him
by Tony Dorsett at an all-star game.</TE>
<TE>   Though he was a redshirt last season and had appeared mostly as a
punt returner this season, other Bruins say they knew what he could
do.</TE>
<TE>   Quarterback Cory Paus said he wasn't worried when he saw Ebell
instead of Harris come in for White.</TE>
<TE>   "I couldn't have been happier," Paus said. "I love all the
tailbacks we have, and I've been saying for a long time those young
kids could really run the ball. So I wasn't even worried one bit. I
was excited about Tyler's chance to play."</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps the most surprising thing about the slight Ebell is that
he doesn't hesitate to take the ball up the middle.</TE>
<TE>   "No, he doesn't. He can handle it," Paus said.</TE>
<TE>   Toledo even jokes with Ebell about his size.</TE>
<TE>   "I told him, 'You're too small to play this game,' " Toledo said.
"But he's a powerful guy--powerful, quick and fast."</TE>
<TE>   Ebell's speed provides a threat to get around the corner the
Bruins haven't had, but he said he prefers another route.</TE>
<TE>   "Yeah, I've got a little bit of speed, but I'd rather run inside
and break it outside," he said. "I just like running up the middle.
It's the quickest way to get upfield."</TE>
<TE>   It's also evidence of the little-man's chip on his shoulder, right
next to Mighty Mouse.</TE>
<TE>   "I like to show I'm not just a speed runner or a third-down back
or a scat back," Ebell said. "I like to run it up the middle and show
I can't just be brought down by a little arm tackle....</TE>
<TE>   "People always told me throughout my whole football career that I
wasn't big enough to play the position I play.... A lot of colleges
told me that.</TE>
<TE>   "I got my shot to play running back, and I think I showed pretty
well [what I can do]."</TE>

<HD>USC Has No PAT Answers in Loss to Washington State</HD>
<DH>College football: Killeen's missed extra point looms large
as No. 18 Trojans fall in overtime, 30-27.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GARY KLEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>PULLMAN, Wash.</DL>
<LD>Judging from the score and statistics, USC's top-rated defense
finally met its match against Washington State on Saturday at Martin
Stadium.</LD>
<LD>   Washington State quarterback Jason Gesser passed without much
pressure and the No. 17 Cougars broke off big rushing plays in a
30-27 overtime victory over the No. 18 Trojans before a delirious
crowd of 36,861.</LD>
<LD>   But there is no defense for missed opportunities on offense and
special teams, and USC wasted plenty that proved far more damaging in
a defeat that dropped the Trojans to 3-2 overall and 1-1 in the
Pacific 10 Conference.</LD>
<TE>   "We moved the ball and had some chances," USC Coach Pete Carroll
said.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the most costly :</TE>
<TE>   * With the Trojans trailing, 10-7, in the second quarter,
quarterback Carson Palmer threw a nine-yard pass that was intercepted
in the end zone.</TE>
<TE>   * Kicker Ryan Killeen missed a 47-yard field goal attempt in the
second quarter that bounced off the upright.</TE>
<TE>   * Perhaps most critically, Killeen missed an extra-point attempt
in the fourth quarter that would have given the Trojans a 28-24 lead
with 4:10 to play.</TE>
<TE>   "Those points are huge," Carroll said.</TE>
<TE>   Drew Dunning's 35-yard field goal in overtime--his third of the
game--provided Washington State with the winning points and improved
the Cougars to 5-1 and 2-0 in the Pac-10.</TE>
<TE>   But Gesser, with a large amount of help from his offensive line,
engineered the victory.</TE>
<TE>   The senior from Hawaii was playing with a flak jacket to protect a
dislocated rib. He anticipated numerous hits from a Trojan defensive
line that recorded five sacks and knocked Oregon State quarterback
Derek Anderson out of the game in a 22-0 shutout last week.</TE>
<TE>   Gesser, however, mixed in quick drops and screen passes with
deeper routes over the middle and along the sidelines and got great
protection from his line while completing 23 of 44 passes for 315
yards and two touchdowns.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought they were going to blitz a lot more and they didn't
except on third down a few times," said Gesser, who was sacked only
once. "I told my offensive line, 'If you can block their front four
and they're not blitzing, we'll be able to do what we want.' "</TE>
<TE>   Defensive end Kenechi Udeze, who recorded USC's lone sack, said
Trojan linemen could not penetrate an offensive front that did not
tire.</TE>
<TE>   "They blocked us pretty good," he said. "[Gesser] was holding the
ball long enough and we just didn't get there."</TE>
<TE>   Washington State also benefited from a rushing attack that
produced 201 yards and helped the Cougars amass 516 total yards.</TE>
<TE>   Jermaine Green gained 92 yards in six carries, including a 75-yard
touchdown run that gave the Cougars a 17-14 lead with 12:39 left in
the third quarter. The Cougars also ran reverses and fake reverses
that helped set up Gesser's passes.</TE>
<TE>   "Every time you looked up they were running a screen or a reverse
and that tends to hold the linebackers up," said linebacker Melvin
Simmons, who transferred to USC from Washington State in 2000.
"That's what gave them great opportunities to do other things."</TE>
<TE>   USC overcame a 10-7 halftime deficit and a 24-14 deficit in the
fourth quarter but could not finish off the Cougars, who beat the
Trojans in Pullman for the first time since 1986 and won an overtime
game for the first time since 1997.</TE>
<TE>   USC pulled to within 24-21 with 7:54 left on a three-yard
touchdown run by Palmer.</TE>
<TE>   The Trojans got the ball back with 5:24 remaining when safety
Jason Leach, who was playing in place of injured All-American Troy
Polamalu, intercepted a pass at the Trojan 47. Three plays later,
Palmer connected with freshman wide receiver Mike Williams on a
55-yard touchdown pass play that gave the Trojans a 27-24 lead.</TE>
<TE>   Killeen, however, missed the extra-point out of a hold by punter
Tom Malone, who was working with Killeen for the first time this
season.</TE>
<TE>   "It was about six inches above my mark," Killeen said. "I didn't
get a good look at it. I had to reach for it and I missed the kick."</TE>
<TE>   On the ensuing possession, which started at the Washington State
20, Gesser completed an eight-yard pass to flanker Devard Darling,
then connected with wide receiver Sammy Moore on a 53-yard pass play
that moved the ball to the USC 26.</TE>
<TE>   Three plays later, Dunning shook off a bad snap and kicked a
wobbly 35-yard field goal with 1:50 remaining to tie the score.</TE>
<TE>   Washington State won the toss and elected to give USC the ball
first in overtime at the 25-yard line.</TE>
<TE>   Tailback Sultan McCullough gained three yards on first down, but
Palmer was sacked for a seven-yard loss on the next play.</TE>
<TE>   "I should have thrown it away," said Palmer, who completed 32 of
50 passes for 381 yards and two touchdowns. "I was trying to get it
to Mike Williams and I should have just thrown it over his head."</TE>
<TE>   Said Williams: "I wasn't open and they rolled over the double
team. By the time Carson got to his next option, they had pressure."</TE>
<TE>   Tailback Justin Fargas was tackled for a five-yard loss on third
down, setting up a 52-yard field-goal attempt by Killeen, who hoped
to redeem himself for the missed extra point. The kick appeared long
enough but it went wide right.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't connect like I should," Killeen said. "I let the
distance bother me instead of just kicking it."</TE>
<TE>   Washington State, needing only a field goal to win, ran John
Tippins for three and four yards before calling on Dunning for his
game-winning 35-yard field goal.</TE>
<TE>   "I was calm and poised," Dunning said. "It was awesome getting the
opportunity."</TE>
<TE>   The Trojans can only blame themselves for providing it.</TE>

<TE>   Five games in which missed kicks played a major role in USC losses
over the last five seasons:</TE>
<TE>   Oct. 5, 2002--Ryan Killeen's missed extra point after a USC
touchdown with 4:10 remaining keeps the Trojans' lead at 27-24 and
allows Washington State to go for a game-tying field goal with 1:50
left instead of a touchdown. Killeen misses a 52-yard field goal
attempt in overtime and Drew Dunning makes a 35-yarder to give
Washington State a 30-27 victory.</TE>
<TE>   Dec. 25, 2001--David Davis misses an extra point and a 47-yard
field-goal attempt in a 10-6 loss to Utah in the Las Vegas Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   Oct. 23, 1999--David Newbury misses from 36 and 53 yards and David
Bell can't connect from 52 yards in a 35-31 loss to Stanford.</TE>
<TE>   Sept. 25, 1999-- Newbury misses an extra point and field-goal
attempts of 51 and 37 yards in a 33-30 loss to Oregon in three
overtimes.</TE>

and 47 yards in a 17-13 loss to Oregon.</TE>

<TE>   KEYS TO THE GAME</TE>
<TE>   Gary Klein's keys to the game and how the Trojans measured up:</TE>
<TE>   1. Control Jason Gesser and neutralize tall receivers: Washington
State's offensive line gave Gesser plenty of time when he wasn't
using quick drops and Gesser completed 23 of 44 passes for 315 yards
and two touchdowns. Gesser connected with 6-foot-6 wide receiver Mike
Bush on several big plays against shorter USC cornerbacks.</TE>
<TE>   2. Establish a running game: Sultan McCullough gained 49 yards in
nine carries during the first half, 38 coming on the Trojans' first
possession, which he capped with a six-yard touchdown run. But he
finished with only 62 yards in 13 carries and the Trojans finished
with only 72 net yards because of 23 yards lost on sacks. Justin
Fargas rushed for 33 yards in 12 carries.</TE>
<TE>   3. Maintain special teams: Kicker Ryan Killeen missed a 47-yard
field-goal attempt with 16 seconds left in the first half, a
conversion kick that allowed Washington State to come back to tie the
score in regulation and a 52-yard field-goal attempt in overtime. Tom
Malone averaged 44 yards for six punts.</TE>

<DL>PULLMAN, Wash.</DL>
<LD>Strong safety Troy Polamalu sat out the last 24 minutes of the first
half Saturday in a 30-27 loss to Washington State and played only a
few downs in the second half after he sprained his right ankle.</LD>
<LD>   Polamalu injured the ankle when he bore down on Washington State
receiver Jerome Riley on a pass play in the first quarter. Riley
missed the ball and was nothing more than a vulnerable target, so
Polamalu eased up to avoid a personal foul penalty. In the process,
his ankle buckled.</LD>
<LD>   "I just pushed off it weird and everything went haywire," Polamalu
said. "That teaches me: Never pull up again."</LD>
<TE>   He was treated by USC's training staff on a table behind the team
bench, then later went back to the locker room where he received
"everything you could imagine," including a cortisone shot.</TE>
<TE>   He will be re-evaluated in Los Angeles.</TE>

<TE>   Simmons transferred to USC after no charges were filed in the
case, redshirted last season and has been a solid weakside linebacker
for the Trojans.</TE>
<TE>   Simmons made three solo tackles and assisted on another Saturday
night at Martin Stadium.</TE>
<TE>   "It was nothing more and nothing less than I expected," Simmons
said of his return. "The only difference is I know a lot of their

catch the Trojans unprepared.</TE>
<TE>   "They did everything we prepared for," he said. "They just did
everything better than we expected."</TE>

<TE>   Washington State was the fourth consecutive ranked opponent that
USC has faced this season.</TE>
<TE>   The only other time USC played four ranked opponents in a row in
the same season was in 1952, when they defeated No. 17 Washington and
No. 3 UCLA, lost to No. 7 Notre Dame and defeated No. 11 Wisconsin in
the Rose Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Going into the game, USC's opponents had converted only seven of
52 third-down attempts.</TE>
<TE>   Washington State converted three of 12.</TE>

<HD>Yankees Could Never Get It Started</HD>
<DH>American League: Wells is the latest New York pitcher to
get clobbered by the Angels, and he gives them full credit.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HELENE ELLIOTT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Yankee left-hander David Wells was cornered twice Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   The first time, he was ambushed by the Angels, who rocked him for
eight runs and 10 hits in 4 2/3 innings in a 9-5 triumph that ended
their first victorious postseason series and turned Edison Field into
a rolling red sea of jubilant fans.</LD>
<LD>   The second time, his back was to the wall and Wells was facing a
pack of reporters, most of them from New York and all speaking in
hushed tones in case he lashed out in anger after his team's season
ended earlier than any of them had imagined.</LD>
<TE>   But Wells stood tall in a locker room full of slumped shoulders
and bowed heads. Speaking calmly and frequently praising the Angels,
he succinctly summed up the Yankees' four-game division series
elimination at the hands of the underdog Angels.</TE>
<TE>   "They brought out the whupping stick," he said. "There was not
much we could do.</TE>
<TE>   "We pitchers just didn't do our job. That's the bottom line. They
outpitched us and outplayed us. We didn't expect it, because we all
had good vibes coming into this series, but the better team won."</TE>
<TE>   Their vibes might have been good, but their pitches weren't.</TE>
<TE>   As late as Saturday morning, Manager Joe Torre insisted pitching
was his team's strength and would carry the Yankees--winners of four
of the past six World Series--deep into another championship hunt.
But as Wells discovered, to his dismay, he and his teammates were no
match for the Angels' patience and resourcefulness.</TE>
<TE>   No Yankee starter lasted longer than the 5 2/3 innings Roger
Clemens pitched in New York's series-opening victory at Yankee
Stadium. The starters' earned-run average was 10.38 (20 earned runs
in 17 1/3 innings). The Yankees' team ERA was 8.21, more than double
their 3.87 regular-season ERA.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't see all four of us going out there with nothing," Game 2
starter Andy Pettitte said of his disbelief at the struggles endured
by Clemens, himself, Game 3 starter Mike Mussina and Wells.</TE>
<TE>   "We went out there pretty confident and feeling pretty good. As
far as our starters, we just didn't get it done. We've gotten it done
over the years and gotten to the World Series and mostly, the
starters got the credit.... We took leads, they fired right back at
us. They beat us in every facet of the game."</TE>
<TE>   On Saturday, the fifth inning proved a turning point for Wells and
the point of no return for the Yankees.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels had tied the score, 2-2, on a leadoff home run by Shawn
Wooten, and they began to peck away at Wells when singles by Benji
Gil and David Eckstein put runners at first and third. Darin Erstad
then lofted a popup into the cloudless blue sky, and neither center
fielder Bernie Williams nor second baseman Alfonso Soriano could
snare it.</TE>
<TE>   "It was one of those in-betweeners," Wells said. "You think they'd
be caught, but crazier things have happened."</TE>
<TE>   Gil scored the go-ahead run, and the rout was on, with the Angels
sending 13 batters to the plate.</TE>
<TE>   "After that, everything just went to hell," said Wells, who was
pulled after run-scoring hits by Tim Salmon, Garret Anderson and
Scott Spiezio. "I got hit around a little bit and the next guy got
hit, and the next guy.</TE>
<TE>   "I hope they go all the way. I really do. You want the team that
beats you to go all the way."</TE>
<TE>   Said Yankee General Manager Brian Cashman: "Pitching is what makes
or breaks us, and it wasn't there for us. We ran into a buzz saw of
an offense. I think it was a combination of the Angel hitters being
good and maybe our pitching not being as good as it normally is."</TE>
<TE>   Normally, ending their season short of a World Series title leads
to changes for the Yankees. Wells, asked if he expects owner George
Steinbrenner to begin a purge, shook his head.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know. It's not for me to say," he said. "I had a great
time this year, and as far as I'm concerned, I hope everybody would
come back."</TE>

<HD>Assault by Bark Beetles Transforming Forests</HD>
<DH>Trees: Vast swaths in West are red, gray and dying.
Drought, fire suppression and global warming are blamed.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE STARK</AU>
<BD>THE BILLINGS GAZETTE</BD>
<DL>CODY, Wyo.</DL>
<LD>Drive along the picturesque North Fork of the Shoshone River east of
Yellowstone National Park and it's tough to miss the changing forest
along the rocky valley.</LD>
<LD>   The vast tracts of Douglas fir that stood green and venerable for
generations are peppered and painted with swaths of rusty red and
gray.</LD>
<LD>   For Douglas fir, those are the colors of death.</LD>
<TE>   The industrious architect reshaping this forest and many others in
the West is barely the size of pencil eraser.</TE>
<TE>   Along the North Fork valley connecting Cody and Yellowstone
National Park, the Douglas fir bark beetle has killed 50,000 trees in
the last two years. Tens of thousands more have been killed since the
epidemic started more than a decade ago.</TE>
<TE>   Although most bark-beetle infestations only last a few years,
there's no end in sight here.</TE>
<TE>   "For the next few years, you're going to see a lot of red and gray
trees and basically dead forest," said Kurt Allen, a bug expert for
the U.S. Forest Service in Rapid City, S.D., who has studied the
North Fork beetles. "You're probably going to see whole hillsides
that are going to be red by the end of the summer."</TE>
<TE>   Bark beetles, including the spruce beetle and mountain pine
beetle, have recently reached epic proportions elsewhere in the West,
including western Montana, the Idaho panhandle, and parts of
California, Colorado and Utah.</TE>
<TE>   The beetle outbreak appears to be the result of a number of
circumstances:</TE>
<TE>   * A general warming trend during the past few years.</TE>
<TE>   * Drought.</TE>
<TE>   * Years of fire suppression.</TE>
<TE>   * Less logging than normal.</TE>
<TE>   * Densely packed stands of trees that are growing old and weak.</TE>
<TE>   "It's kind of an ecosystem out of balance. There's more food than
they're used to, and bark beetles are opportunists," said Ken Gibson,
a Forest Service entomologist in Missoula who's been studying the
record outbreak of bark beetles in western Montana that started in
1997.</TE>
<TE>   Others say the flourishing beetle population might also be a sign
of global warming. Because insects tend to thrive in warmer
temperatures, some scientists say warming can be seen in the mountain
pine beetle's spread to higher elevations, where it bores into
whitebark pine, and in the faster reproduction cycles of the spruce
beetle.</TE>
<TE>   The bark beetle is part of a family of similar insects known as
Scoytidaes.</TE>
<TE>   "They are very effective tree killers," Gibson said. "Many bugs
feed on leaves or needles, but the trees don't die. With the bark
beetle, they attack in such numbers that the tree dies within a few
weeks."</TE>
<TE>   The Douglas fir bark beetle leads a short but vigorously
productive life.</TE>
<TE>   In its one year of existence, the typical beetle is born in a
tree, feeds on its inner bark along with thousands of others until
the tree is dead, then flies to the next tree, where the beetle
reproduces and dies.</TE>
<TE>   The beetles don't generally threaten healthy trees, which emit a
chemical that the beetles avoid. Instead, they look for trees that
are old, weakened, recently burned or blown down. Drought stresses
the trees, making them susceptible to the insects' onslaught.</TE>
<TE>   The beetles drill through the outer bark to get to the cambial
layer, between the wood and outer bark, where sugar from the leaves
and needles are transported to the roots. The beetles lay eggs in the
tree and, eventually, thousands of beetles form a sort of girdle
around the tree, cutting off the flow of nutrients that keep the tree
alive.</TE>
<TE>   The beetles also carry a fungus that clogs the sapwood and blocks
water from going to the roots and crown.</TE>
<TE>   The trees' main defense is to "pitch out" the beetles by secreting
enough sap to flood the beetle from the inner layer of bark. But in
drought years, many trees lack enough water to produce sufficient sap
to defend themselves.</TE>
<TE>   Although it takes just weeks for beetles to kill a tree, it can
take up to a year for the tree to show outward signs of damage.</TE>
<TE>   Aside from culling older, weaker trees out of the forest, the
beetles play another important ecological role.</TE>
<TE>   When the tree dies and falls to the forest floor, it provides
nutrients to the soil, homes for other animals and other natural
benefits. With fewer trees, more sunlight is able to reach the forest
floor, promoting growth of other plants and adding diversity.</TE>
<TE>   "They are recycling organisms. When they kill a tree, it becomes
organic matter in the forest," Bentz said.</TE>
<TE>   Although it's happening at a more prolific rate than usual, the
deadly relationship between the beetles and the trees is natural,
Bentz said.</TE>
<TE>   "These insects have been around for just as long as Douglas fir;
it's a native part of the system that has evolved with the system,"
Bentz said. "It's us that think they're a problem."</TE>
<TE>   The latest beetle outbreak west of Cody started with the 1988
fires around Yellowstone National Park. Bark beetles are attracted to
trees that have been injured but not killed by fires.</TE>
<TE>   Shortly after the fires, the beetles started occupying acres and
acres of forest. Allen said the beetles found such prime conditions
that, after they finished with the burned trees, they moved to
neighboring green trees.</TE>
<TE>   "It's almost all Douglas fir, basically the same age and same
size, which just makes it perfect habitat for the beetles to keep
going and going," Allen said. "In the last three years, they've been
growing exponentially. The populations are just growing and growing."</TE>
<TE>   Aggressive fire suppression and relatively little logging along
the North Fork have created long stretches where trees are the same
species and age. Most of the trees are dry from drought and 80 years
old and older -- perfect targets for the bark beetle.</TE>
<TE>   Forest managers in Montana, Wyoming, Idaho and elsewhere have been
trying to figure out what to do about the bark beetles.</TE>
<TE>   Some treatments have shown limited success.</TE>
<TE>   In some places, the Forest Service has attached capsules to
certain trees. The capsules emit a pheromone that tells the bark
beetle to stay away, protecting one tree at a time.</TE>
<TE>   So far, fears that the capsules just drive the beetles farther
down the road have been unfounded, Gibson said.</TE>
<TE>   "We think it keeps the beetles confused and they fly until they
just run out of gas," he said. "So it actually seems to increase
their mortality."</TE>
<TE>   Traps are available to snare the beetle, but they are really only
effective in smaller, isolated areas where the beetles aren't fully
established.</TE>
<TE>   In a heavily infested area such as the North Fork, Allen said,
"even if you put out 100 traps, you wouldn't catch 1% of them."</TE>
<TE>   The best option, Gibson said, is to keep the beetles at bay in the
first place. That will mean changing the composition of many forests
in the West, primarily by logging to reduce tree density.</TE>
<TE>   "We just don't remove as many trees as we once did," he said. "In
western Montana, in many places you have 400 or 500 trees per acre
where there used to be barely 100 trees per acre. Maybe it's because
we're more reluctant to harvest."</TE>
<TE>   Gibson isn't recommending heavy logging, but thinning in areas
where trees are tightly packed.</TE>
<TE>   "That will increase the vigor of the remaining trees, plus the
beetles don't like a lot of sunlight," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Still, don't expect the beetles to go away.</TE>
<TE>   "Bark beetles are opportunists," Gibson said. "They take advantage
of situations that Mother Nature or man provides them."</TE>

<HD>Economy Poses Challenge for New Disney Parks President</HD>
<DH>Entertainment: Hard times and cutbacks at the company have
left James Rasulo with less room to boost operations.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD VERRIER and ROBERT JOHNSON</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>James Rasulo's new job puts him smack in the middle of the
Not-So-Wonderful World of Disney.</LD>
<LD>   Rasulo, who helped turn around Walt Disney Co.'s once-struggling
theme park outside Paris, is being called on to do the same thing for
the entertainment giant's entire travel and tourism empire. The
operation, along with the rest of the industry, is suffering through
one of its worst-ever downturns.</LD>
<LD>   The 46-year-old executive was named last week to replace Paul
Pressler, who resigned from Disney as its chairman of parks and
resorts to become chief executive of Gap Inc.</LD>
<TE>   Disney's theme park operating income is projected to fall by a
quarter this year, according to analysts' estimates. The slump has
depressed Disney's stock and turned up the heat on Disney CEO Michael
Eisner, who ushered in the company's vast expansion of theme parks
and resorts.</TE>
<TE>   If Disney's theme parks, which are valued at $19 billion, were
listed on the Fortune 500, they would rank No. 265, right behind
General Mills Inc.</TE>
<TE>   Now the very successes Disney has had in building its juggernaut
have made the company far more vulnerable to economic hard times.</TE>
<TE>   Disney executives were caught off guard by the sharp drop in
travel after last year's terrorist attacks, which deepened a slowdown
that was underway in the parks.</TE>
<TE>   "I won't prognosticate as an economist," Rasulo said. "I can't
tell you when things are going to turn around. But we are ready."</TE>
<TE>   Long accustomed to shaping its destiny, Disney now finds itself
largely at the mercy of forces beyond its control. Foreign travelers
are staying home because of fears of terrorist strikes, Americans are
holding on to their wallets and airlines have cut flights by as much
as 20%.</TE>
<TE>   "At the television network, Disney can come up with better
programming for ABC and the audience will tune in," said Paul Kim, an
analyst at Kaufman Bros. securities in New York. "At the studio, you
come up with a big new hit for release at Christmas or Memorial Day
and lots of people will buy tickets. But at the theme parks, if
people are worried about security or the economy, you can't convince
them to spend thousands of dollars to take a vacation. That's a much
harder sell."</TE>
<TE>   In such an environment, Rasulo has little room to maneuver.
Disney's theme parks already have undergone financial cutbacks,
provoking some fans to say that Disney's reputation for quality has
been hurt. Even before the terrorist attacks, Disney cut 1,000 jobs,
mostly in its U.S. theme parks.</TE>
<TE>   By the same token, Rasulo does not have the luxury of spending his
way out of the slump because demand is soft and the firm's other
units, especially ABC, are troubled.</TE>
<TE>   "Strategically, he's in kind of a box," Kim said of Rasulo. "The
parks are at the mercy of the economy. You'd like to spend more on
new attractions, but you aren't making money like you used to."</TE>
<TE>   Decade of Expansion</TE>
<TE>   In 1990, Eisner outlined a 10-year plan to "do nothing less than
reinvent the Disney theme park and resort experience." The underlying
goal was to turn Orlando, Fla., and Anaheim into resort destinations,
giving customers a range of entertainment choices that would persuade
them to stay longer and spend more money.</TE>
<TE>   "The idea was to create a great guest experience and a lifelong
loyalty so guests would keep coming back," said Judson Green, who led
much of the expansion as parks and resorts chairman during the 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   The company would transform Disney World in Orlando--its signature
resort--into one of the world's largest tourist destinations (there's
a running feud with Las Vegas over which is larger). Walt Disney
World has more than 20,000 hotel rooms, hundreds of time-share units,
four theme parks, two water parks, two cruise ships and a sprawling
entertainment complex, including nightclubs and the Canadian circus
troupe Cirque du Soleil.</TE>
<TE>   Disney also turned its attention to Anaheim, where its theme park
dominance began in 1955. The company added hotels, Downtown Disney
and a California-themed amusement park next to Disneyland. At the
same time, Disney opened theme parks in Paris and Tokyo. In all, more
than 80 million visitors flock to Disney's 10 theme parks annually.</TE>
<TE>   As it grew, so did chief rival Universal Studios, which in 1999
opened its second theme park in Orlando--Islands of Adventure. The
rivalry created what insiders call "an attractions arms race."</TE>
<TE>   While aggressively adding attractions, Disney boosted its profit
by steadily raising admission prices. The strategy worked, helping
deliver record profit for Disney year after year.</TE>
<TE>   "The strategy was build, build, build. Every year there was
something new," said David Koenig, a Disney historian and author. "It
was an astounding growth period.... Now they're overexposed."</TE>
<TE>   By 2001, the giant had begun to stumble as the economy slowed.
Then came Sept. 11 and double-digit declines in attendance,
particularly among foreign tourists, who are especially coveted
because they stay longer than domestic vacationers.</TE>
<TE>   Although most of the pain was felt in Orlando, the $1.4-billion
California Adventure theme park also took a hard hit. The park has
yet to come close to meeting original attendance projections of 7
million visitors a year. Disney hopes a new attraction opening
Monday, Flik's Fun Fair, will give the park a boost.</TE>
<TE>   Theme park operating income for Disney this year is expected to
fall 27% to $1.16 billion, said Prudential Securities analyst
Katherine Styponias. By 2003, she said, the business could climb to
$1.49 billion, depending on whether the U.S. goes to war with Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   Disney has responded to the crisis by stepping up its marketing,
cutting workers' hours, closing thousands of hotel rooms and cutting
back on live-action shows and park hours. At Walt Disney World, the
opening of the 5,700-room Pop Century resort was pushed back.</TE>
<TE>   Cuts Not Well Received</TE>
<TE>   Some of Disney's cutbacks--such as removing popular VIP lounges
for annual- pass holders and ending the practice of allowing resort
guests to enter the parks an hour early--provoked a backlash. Disney
later restored the early admission.</TE>
<TE>   "It's going to be a difficult process, especially because they've
done a good job of squeezing costs," Styponias said. "You don't want
to cut too close to the bone."</TE>
<TE>   Disney executives say that, because of their actions, the parks
and resorts are poised for a recovery when the economy improves.</TE>
<TE>   "The longer the downturn lasts, the greater the pent-up demand
will be," Eisner said at a media conference last week in New York.</TE>
<TE>   Wall Street has praised Disney's handling of the crisis,
especially its ability to cut costs and maximize cash flow. But theme
park experts and former Disney executives say Rasulo's biggest
challenge will be to keep the parks fresh and preserve Walt's goal of
creating an emotional connection with guests so they keep coming
back.</TE>
<TE>   "Although the cost cutting is necessary and always needs to be
part of the agenda, especially in tough times, what really matters to
the business is the emphasis on caring about the cast and guest
experience," Green said. "That has to be the guiding principle."</TE>

<HD>TV Shows Trading Celluloid for Pixels</HD>
<DH>Entertainment: The rapid switch to the cheaper digital
format is getting mixed reviews from cinematographers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JON HEALEY and P.J. HUFFSTUTTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As the production crew on the documentary "Seven Wonders of Egypt"
prepared for filming in the Sahara in August, it received an
unexpected call from its employers at Discovery Networks: Send back
the celluloid and pick up high-definition digital cameras.</LD>
<LD>   The crew in Egypt wasn't the only one given the mandate. After
reviewing its fall lineup, the cable network ordered 50 crews to
switch from film to digital cameras--a trend that's sweeping the
television industry.</LD>
<LD>   This fall, the major networks have 37 programs--or nearly 30% of
their prime-time lineup--shot in high-definition, with more on the
way at midseason. Last year only three shows were shot this way.</LD>
<TE>   Simple economics drives the change. Digital cameras are alluring
to networks and production companies struggling with burgeoning
expenses. Shooting in digital can trim 2% or more from the cost of a
show without reducing quality, studio executives say.</TE>
<TE>   The first to feel the effect are cinematographers, technical
artists responsible for bringing a director's vision to life.
Although some are enthusiastic about the new tools, others say
they're being forced to use equipment that's inferior.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like sitting on an airplane and getting a plastic knife. You
accept it as something that is being forced upon you," said
cinematographer Stefan Czapsky, who worked on "Edward Scissorhands"
and "The Thin Blue Line."</TE>
<TE>   "You don't really feel like it was as good as it was when you had
a metal knife."</TE>
<TE>   For TV producers, what matters is keeping within the budget--a sum
dictated largely by the fees a network agrees to pay producers in
order to broadcast a show.</TE>
<TE>   With expenses climbing 20% in the last three years, production of
hourlong dramas can cost $2 million and half-hour sitcoms can cost $1
million per episode.</TE>
<TE>   "It comes down to, financially, how is this all going to work and
what's the bottom line," said Gail Patterson, senior vice president
of production for Spelling Television. Although Patterson says film
is her first choice, Spelling is shooting its first series with
high-definition cameras this fall, a midseason replacement for CBS.</TE>
<TE>   Shooting a show with high-definition cameras doesn't guarantee
that it will be broadcast in high definition for reception on the new
generation of television sets. CBS and ABC broadcast much of their
prime-time lineups in high definition. NBC and the WB transmit only a
few programs in HDTV. Fox doesn't do any.</TE>
<TE>   Some proponents of digital cameras say the television audience
can't see the difference--a point even some critics of the high-def
cameras concede. Besides, they say, the quality of the story is what
matters most, not the number of pixels on the screen.</TE>
<TE>   "We think, when it's correctly done, it produces an image every
bit as lovely as film," said Martin D. Franks, executive vice
president at CBS and an advocate of high-definition cameras. "I'm
sure to a finely trained eye there are distinctions [between high-def
and film], just as an expert winemaker can find distinctions between
various years of wine. The mass audience seems fairly happy with the
[current] vintage."</TE>
<TE>   Savings Stack Up</TE>
<TE>   Film costs can be as much as 50 cents a foot, and processing adds
as much as 13 cents a foot, said Ed Nassour, senior vice president of
TV post-production at 20th Century Fox Film Corp. Digital cameras, by
contrast, use inexpensive videotapes or feed directly to computer
hard drives.</TE>
<TE>   Then there's the cost of transferring film to a digital format for
editing on computer equipment.</TE>
<TE>   Ed Lammi, executive vice president of production at Columbia
TriStar Domestic Television, said the savings from the use of digital
cameras amounted to $30,000 to $40,000 per episode of a one-hour
drama and $20,000 to $25,000 for a sitcom. That may not seem like
much for a show with a budget of $1 million or more, but it can make
a critical difference for a production trying to shave every penny.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a very viable, aesthetically acceptable tool, certainly for
television," said Lammi, whose studio is owned by Sony Corp., maker
of the most widely used high-definition cameras.</TE>
<TE>   Columbia TriStar is using those cameras on the science-fiction
drama "Odyssey 5" for Showtime. "The economics are always daunting in
television," Lammi said. "Cable television, they're even more
daunting."</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, the current high-definition cameras are bulkier
and capture less detail than 35mm film cameras. They also present a
new set of creative and technical challenges--for example, they have
trouble handling sunlight streaming through windows--and they tend to
deliver a harsher look than film, cinematographers say.</TE>
<TE>   Economics vs. Aesthetics</TE>
<TE>   Lammi said his studio weighs both economics and aesthetics when
choosing cameras, but "the key to making it work is the excitement,
the interest and the cooperation of the director of photography. If
you don't have that, you're going to have some problems."</TE>
<TE>   In fact, sometimes the situation is reversed: The director of
photography wants to shoot in digital but hits a wall--even at the
studio owned by Sony.</TE>
<TE>   That's what happened to Roy H. Wagner, a veteran cinematographer
who was tapped by Columbia TriStar for the now-defunct show
"Pasadena." Wagner said the studio dictated that, for economic
reasons, the show would be shot on Super 16mm film, a format he did
not like.</TE>
<TE>   Curious about the buzz over high-definition digital cameras,
Wagner suggested to the studio that he use digital equipment. Much to
his surprise, the studio said no.</TE>
<TE>   He presented his proposal to a group of studio executives, who
grilled him on the reported deficiencies of digital cameras. When he
remained firm--"It's not the machinery that makes the picture look
good; it's the person behind the machinery"--they gave him what they
thought was a no-brainer choice. They said he could use 35mm film or
shoot in digital.</TE>
<TE>   He opted for high-definition cameras.</TE>
<TE>   "High-definition is not anywhere near the dynamic range of film,"
he said. Still, "I want to embrace all technologies and move the ball
forward as much as we can. It's only going to make us better
storytellers."</TE>

<HD>Lawmakers Tuning In to New Media Issues</HD>
<DH>Technology: From file sharing to digital TV, members of
Congress are pushing bills that would affect everyday lives of
Americans.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EDMUND SANDERS and JON HEALEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Rep. Howard L. Berman has a daughter who's a big fan of downloading
music online, but the Mission Hills Democrat is sponsoring a bill
that might block file-swapping.</LD>
<LD>   Then there's Rep. W.J. "Billy" Tauzin (R.-La.), who was so
mesmerized by the crystalline images of a high-definition TV Super
Bowl broadcast that he's pushing the nation to adopt digital
television, a costly transition that would require millions of
Americans to replace their TV sets.</LD>
<LD>   And Sen. Ernest F. Hollings (D-S.C.) made a fan of Walt Disney Co.
by introducing a bill requiring anti-piracy devices in new
technology, but he's the entertainment industry's staunchest foe in
blocking big media mergers.</LD>
<TE>   As Hollywood starts to take center stage again in Washington,
lawmakers--for different reasons--are promoting legislation that
would have a significant effect on consumers' everyday activities,
including buying TVs, taping favorite programs and downloading songs.
Unlike past congressional efforts that centered on complaints about
sex and violence in movies and songs, the current battles concern
more arcane topics, such as analog versus digital TV or copyright
infringement.</TE>
<TE>   Although entertainment issues can lead to more headlines and
fatter campaign chests, messing with Americans' television sets or
restricting how they use their computers is fraught with political
risk.</TE>
<TE>   Tauzin, who as a member of the House Energy and Commerce Committee
has tackled Enron Corp. and energy reform, is facing one of his
biggest gambles in an effort to push the nation toward digital TV.
After criticism two weeks ago about the potential cost to consumers,
the lawmaker distanced himself somewhat from a proposal, written by
his staff, that would have required consumers to buy expensive
digital TVs or obtain converter boxes to keep their current sets
working after Dec. 31, 2006.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no more dangerous place in America than getting between
an American consumer and his television set," Tauzin said.</TE>
<TE>   When Berman returned home this summer to find out what
constituents were thinking, he was surprised to learn that outrage
over his file-sharing bill was as strong, and sometimes stronger,
than concerns about a possible invasion of Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   "I knew this would be a controversial idea and I liked that,"
Berman said. "But I've been surprised at how the bill has been
mischaracterized."</TE>
<TE>   Lure of a Challenge</TE>
<TE>   Despite the risks, politicians find entertainment-related issues
hard to resist, in part because they strike a chord with voters.</TE>
<TE>   "The risk is there can be repercussions if your name is attached
to a plan that has gone awry," said Andy Spahn, who was an aide to
former Sens. Gary Hart of Colorado and Alan Cranston of California
and now handles political affairs for DreamWorks SKG. "But if you
demonstrate leadership and effectiveness, it's something you can
campaign on."</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Rick Boucher (D-Va.) has established himself as a dependable
ally of technology companies and their customers. But he faces fierce
opposition from a wide array of entertainment and publishing
companies for his proposed Digital Media Consumer Rights Act, which
would strengthen consumer rights to make copies of songs and movies.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah) is one of the architects of a 1998
law intended to make the Internet safe for copyright holders and new
digital distribution businesses. The law has helped record companies
in their fight against piracy, but Hatch isn't in the labels' corner
now. For two years he has prodded them to embrace the Internet and
treat artists better by avoiding exploitative contracts and irregular
accounting for royalties. And he's losing patience.</TE>
<TE>   Lawmakers probably won't pass any laws related to entertainment or
media until next year. But behind-the-scenes work, lobbying and
bill-drafting are underway.</TE>
<TE>   Tauzin said he realized the potential for digital television while
attending a Super Bowl game as a guest of Disney. During important
plays, he would watch a 50-inch high-definition TV set in the luxury
box rather than watch the live action.</TE>
<TE>   "The picture was so much better," said Tauzin, a self-described TV
addict who now has his own digital set.</TE>
<TE>   Tauzin is preparing to introduce a bill that would speed the
rollout of digital TV, a technology that promises richly detailed
pictures, CD-quality sound and dozens of extra channels. He adopted
the digital TV cause when it became clear that the major TV
industries would miss the 2006 digital conversion date that was set
in a 1996 law he helped write.</TE>
<TE>   Getting TVs to move at "computer speed" is vital for the nation,
Tauzin said, and will help spur the rollout of high-speed Internet
access.</TE>
<TE>   "Television has to migrate to digital," Tauzin said.</TE>
<TE>   The transition to digital TV has prompted a lobbying melee among
cable operators, broadcasters, set manufacturers and Hollywood
studios. But such squabbling can be a boon to a Capitol Hill deal
maker because it may generate heavy campaign contributions from all
sides, said Larry Noble, executive director of the Center for
Responsive Politics in Washington. Tauzin has received about $62,000
in contributions in the current election cycle, from 2000 to 2002,
from entertainment and cable companies, and $2,000 from consumer
electronics makers, the center said.</TE>
<TE>   Technology Battle</TE>
<TE>   Berman is trying to tackle another problem that has vexed
Congress: file sharing. The recording industry says it is losing
billions through the illegal online trading of copyrighted music
files, but the file-swapping networks have attracted millions of
young people.</TE>
<TE>   His Peer-to-Peer Piracy Prevention Act would give entertainment
companies more leeway to block copyrighted materials on file-sharing
networks, letting them jam users' computers electronically and mount
other technical counterattacks. Berman said he was attracted by the
idea of allowing entertainment companies and file-sharing networks to
duke it out with new kinds of technology.</TE>
<TE>   But Berman's bill also may "sanction a Wild, Wild West" in which
record companies and file-sharing networks unleash ever-evolving
technology in which innocent consumers get hurt, warned Gigi Sohn,
president of Public Knowledge, a public interest group opposed to the
bill.</TE>
<TE>   She noted that Warner Bros., producer of the movie "Harry Potter
and the Sorcerer's Stone," increasingly relies on automated software
that searches the hard drives of network users for pirated versions
of the hit movie. The studio recently demanded that an Internet
service provider terminate a child's account after the software
program mistook the child's "Harry Potter" book report for a pirated
copy of the movie.</TE>
<TE>   Berman and some of his bill's co-sponsors say they have been
astounded by the avalanche of criticism they have received since
introducing the bill. He's been spending lots of time defending the
legislation and attempting to explain to young people the harm of
illegal file-sharing, including to his 22-year-old daughter.</TE>
<TE>   "We talk about it, but I'm not sure I've stopped her from doing
it," Berman said.</TE>
<TE>   He says his staff came up with the idea for the bill, not industry
groups. Still, the legislation has enhanced his standing with
industry players. Berman is frequently among the top recipients of
campaign contributions from Hollywood. In the current election cycle,
Berman has collected $192,000 from TV, music and other media
companies and their employees, according to the Center for Responsive
Politics.</TE>
<TE>   Another bill coveted by the entertainment industry is Hollings'
proposed Consumer Broadband and Digital Television Promotion Act,
which would require computer and consumer electronics manufacturers
to install government-approved anti-piracy technology in digital
audio and video devices. The bill is a response to demands by
Hollywood studios for more protection from free swapping of films and
TV programs over the Internet.</TE>
<TE>   The populist Hollings is a surprising emissary for the
entertainment industry on the anti-piracy front, given his battles
with media conglomerates on another issue they care deeply about:
relaxation of media ownership rules. Concerned that media companies
are growing too large and powerful, Hollings is threatening to block
the Federal Communications Commission, which his Senate Commerce
Committee oversees, if the FCC moves too aggressively to lift
ownership limits.</TE>
<TE>   Diametrically opposed to Hollings' anti-piracy legislation,
Boucher has become the technology industry's point man on fair
use--the provision of copyright law that gives people some freedom to
make copies of books, music and movies for personal use. Boucher on
Thursday introduced a bill to ensure that copyright owners can't use
the 1998 Digital Millennium Copyright Act to roll back the fair-use
rights of consumers, libraries and others who buy media in digital
formats.</TE>
<TE>   "The fair-use debate ... is the next most important issue that we
have to address," Boucher said. "Fair use is fundamental to the
vibrant exercise of our democracy, because the right to speak relies
upon the right to use a broad array of information."</TE>
<TE>   The 1998 law makes it a crime for anyone to pick an electronic
lock that controls access to a digital book, song, game or video,
even if the person paid for, say, a DVD copy of "Shrek" and wanted to
take a copy of the film on a trip. This anti-circumvention provision,
Boucher said, has alarmed libraries, universities, telecommunications
companies and electronics manufacturers, all of whom worry about the
public's ability to use copyrighted material.</TE>
<TE>   "Most of these [technology] companies would tell you that the
single most important thing that we need to do today is achieve the
broad deployment into homes and businesses of [high-speed Internet]
architectures," he said. And consumers won't demand these broadband
connections, Boucher said, unless they can enjoy downloadable music,
movies and other material freely in their homes, cars and other
places.</TE>
<TE>   Songwriter's Crusade</TE>
<TE>   In the post-Napster era, Hatch is the only member of Congress with
multiple CDs of songs for sale online. A 26-year veteran of the
Senate and a leader on copyright issues, Hatch said he started
writing inspirational songs in 1995, partly because he wanted to
learn more about the inner workings of the music industry.</TE>
<TE>   Not long after penning his first tunes, Hatch helped push through
Congress two bills designed to turn the Internet into a profitable
new distribution pipeline for the record labels and other
entertainment companies. The first, in 1996, created a "digital
performance right" that entitled labels and artists to collect
royalties from Internet radio stations. The second, the Digital
Millennium Copyright Act, gave copyright owners a host of tools to
combat piracy as an incentive for them to embrace the Net.</TE>
<TE>   But those bills haven't borne the fruit he expected, Hatch said,
despite his campaign for the record labels to "take advantage of the
Internet for the benefit of artists and fans." One sore point is the
fate of Napster, the pioneering and now bankrupt online file-sharing
service. After being introduced to Napster in 1999, Hatch
unsuccessfully pressed the labels to strike licensing deals that
would transform the popular service into a legitimate business before
file-sharing piracy became a global problem. Although some legitimate
online music sites run by record companies are slowly gaining
momentum, Hatch said, "I am disappointed that we haven't gone faster
in this area."</TE>
<TE>   Recently, Hatch has urged the labels to make out-of-print
recordings available online and has circulated a measure that would
compel the labels to give online music distributors access to those
recordings, a move Hatch thinks would help artists and consumers by
reviving sales of out-of-print recordings.</TE>
<TE>   The Judiciary Committee hasn't been as active on music issues
since Democrats took control of the Senate and the panel.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Hatch said, he hopes to have more hearings next year and
possibly move some legislation.</TE>
<TE>   "We've got to find some way that puts incentives to the creative
side of this endeavor," he said.</TE>

<HD>For IRAs, an Upside to Stocks Going Down</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Kathy M. Kristof</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Undoing a Roth IRA conversion isn't the only way retirement savers
can benefit from falling stock prices. A bear market also can be a
great time to go in the opposite direction and convert a traditional
IRA to a Roth account.</LD>
<LD>   The compelling reason to convert now: The combination of depressed
stock prices and capital losses are likely to make the cost of
conversion the lowest it's been in years.</LD>
<LD>   When you convert an IRA, you must pay income tax on the value of
the assets transferred into the Roth account. The more those assets
have declined in value, the less you'll owe in taxes.</LD>
<TE>   For example, say you put $1,000 into a traditional IRA in March
2000 and invested it in a Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index mutual fund.
That investment would be worth just $630 as of the end of August,
according to Ibbotson Associates, a Chicago-based market research
firm.</TE>
<TE>   Converting that IRA into a Roth account today would cost $189 in
federal taxes, assuming you're in the 30% bracket--about one-third
less than if you had converted the account when it was still worth
$1,000.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, if you have realized capital losses in your taxable
investment accounts, those can be used to offset even more of the tax
bill from the IRA conversion.</TE>
<TE>   There's another reason it may make sense to convert now. Unlike
traditional IRAs, Roth accounts offer no upfront tax break. But
investments held in a Roth account are free of taxes when you
withdraw them during retirement--no matter how much they've gained in
value over the years.</TE>
<TE>   So the cheaper stocks are when you convert to a Roth IRA, the
greater your potential tax-free upside--assuming you have time to
wait for the market to turn around.</TE>
<TE>   "If you think your stocks might bounce back, it makes some sense
to convert while values are down," said Philip J. Holthouse, partner
at the Los Angeles tax law and accounting firm of Holthouse Carlin &amp;
Van Trigt.</TE>

<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Enron's Former Chief</LD>
<LD>   of Finance Surrenders</LD>
<LD>   Andrew S. Fastow, the alleged financial mastermind behind the
Enron Corp. scandal, turned himself over to the FBI to face criminal
charges that he pocketed millions of dollars while orchestrating a
maze of illegal partnerships and secret deals.</LD>
<TE>   The development caps a stunning fall for Fastow, 40. Once one of
the most respected chief financial officers on Wall Street, he has
become a symbol of corporate greed.</TE>
<TE>   Still unknown is whether Fastow will turn on his former bosses.
The criminal complaint begins a dance between Fastow and federal
prosecutors over whether he will attempt to bargain away some charges
by offering to implicate former Enron Chief Executive Jeffrey K.
Skilling and former Chairman Kenneth L. Lay.</TE>
<TE>   By filing a criminal complaint and not moving immediately with an
indictment, federal prosecutors are giving Fastow a last chance to
cooperate, attorneys say.</TE>
<TE>   Faneuil Pleads Guilty</TE>
<TE>   in Stewart Stock Case</TE>
<TE>   Douglas Faneuil, an assistant to Martha Stewart's stockbroker,
pleaded guilty to a single misdemeanor charge, admitting that he was
offered money, plane tickets and an extra week of vacation to keep
mum that Stewart had been tipped off to inside information regarding
her ImClone System Inc.'s shares.</TE>
<TE>   The plea by the Merrill Lynch  &amp; Co. broker's assistant was part
of a deal to testify in the investigation of Stewart and her dumping
of $228,000 of ImClone shares in December.</TE>
<TE>   Stewart sold her 3,928 shares of ImClone on Dec. 27, just before
the price nose-dived on news the Food and Drug Administration would
not approve the company's anti-cancer drug, Erbitux.</TE>
<TE>   Stewart has denied wrongdoing in the sale of ImClone shares and
has maintained that she had a standing order with Faneuil's
supervisor, Peter Bacanovic, to sell the stock if the price went
below $60.</TE>
<TE>   Neither Stewart nor Bacanovic was named in the indictment, but the
nine-page misdemeanor information describes his superior as a
"Financial Advisor" and Stewart as "the Tippee." Both Faneuil and
Bacanovic also were fired by Merrill for violating company rules.</TE>
<TE>   Unemployment Rate</TE>
<TE>   Falls Unexpectedly</TE>
<TE>   The nation's unemployment rate unexpectedly fell to 5.6% in
September, diminishing the prospect that the Federal Reserve would
cut interest rates before its next policy meeting in November.</TE>
<TE>   The jobless rate fell from 5.7% in August and was the lowest since
February. August payrolls grew by 107,000, almost three times the
amount estimated a month ago. In September, 43,000 jobs were lost,
the Labor Department said. The number of hours worked rose more than
in any month since January 2001, before last year's recession began.</TE>
<TE>   Unexpected declines in manufacturing led investors to speculate
that Fed policy makers would cut the benchmark overnight bank lending
rate before their next scheduled meeting Nov. 6.</TE>
<TE>   Another Weekly Loss</TE>
<TE>   for Stock Market</TE>
<TE>   The stock market posted its sixth straight week of losses, thanks
in part to a hail of dismal outlooks from companies including data
storage giant EMC Corp. and a record $28-billion judgment against
cigarette leader Philip Morris Cos.</TE>
<TE>   A mixed reading on the job market in September and continuing
fears of a war on Iraq added to market jitters.</TE>
<TE>   Philip Morris, also a Dow 30 stock, sank 7% and sparked a fresh
round of selling after a jury ordered the world's largest cigarette
maker to pay $28 billion in damages to a woman with lung cancer.</TE>
<TE>   For the week, the Nasdaq fell almost 5%, the Dow lost more than 2%
and the S&amp;P 500 surrendered more than 3%.</TE>
<TE>   For the Nasdaq and S&amp;P 500, it was the longest string of losing
weeks since the first half of 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Global Chairman Defends Stock Sale</TE>
<TE>   Global Crossing Ltd. Chairman Gary Winnick told a congressional
panel that he was unaware his company was in dire financial straits
when he pocketed nearly $124 million by selling company stock last
year. He sought to make amends by pledging $25 million of his own
money to compensate workers whose retirement savings were depleted as
the share price slumped to mere pennies.</TE>
<TE>   But members of the House subcommittee on oversight and
investigations disputed Winnick's portrayal of himself as a detached
leader who was not active in the company's day-to-day affairs.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, they said, Winnick was "well aware" of the
telecommunications upstart's controversial practice of "swapping"
transmission capacity on its network with other firms to boost
revenue.</TE>
<TE>   It was the first time the Los Angeles telecom mogul had spoken
publicly about Global since the company filed for Chapter 11
bankruptcy protection in January. He was subpoenaed by the committee.</TE>
<TE>   Executives Sued</TE>
<TE>   for IPO Profits</TE>
<TE>   Five telecom industry executives, including Los Angeles sports
mogul Philip F. Anschutz and former WorldCom Inc. Chief Executive
Bernard J. Ebbers, were sued by the state of New York on allegations
that they steered business to a big Wall Street brokerage in exchange
for hot stock offerings.</TE>
<TE>   The civil suit filed by New York Atty. Gen. Eliot Spitzer alleges
that the men directed corporate finance work for their firms to
Salomon Smith Barney, the brokerage arm of Citigroup Inc., in return
for sweetheart deals on initial public stock offerings.</TE>
<TE>   Wall Street's practice of personally rewarding executives with
coveted IPOs is known as "spinning" and is the subject of several
probes by state and federal regulators. Spitzer is the first
regulator to bring formal charges.</TE>
<TE>   The complaint seeks the disgorgement of $28 million in profits
made when the executives sold their IPO shares.</TE>
<TE>   Courtney Love Settles Suit Against Vivendi</TE>
<TE>   Rock singer Courtney Love, who sued the world's biggest music
company to expose the record industry's allegedly corrupt business
practices, settled her lawsuit amid questions about the future of the
artists rights movement she helped launch.</TE>
<TE>   After Love sued Vivendi Universal's Universal Music Group last
year to break her band's contract, the widow of Nirvana singer Kurt
Cobain complained about the "unconscionable and unlawful" business
and accounting practices of the major record labels.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, dozens of stars have lined up to demand better
contracts, health benefits and other reforms.</TE>
<TE>   But after a series of legal setbacks, Love agreed to a settlement
that releases her from her record contract and provides her with
ownership of several unreleased recordings by her band, Hole.</TE>
<TE>   Disney Picks Paris Veteran to Run Parks</TE>
<TE>   Walt Disney Co. Chief Executive Michael Eisner named the head of
Euro Disney to take over as head of the company's core theme park
division.</TE>
<TE>   James A. Rasulo, credited with helping to turn around the European
park, succeeded Paul Pressler, who resigned to run Gap Inc. Rasulo's
appointment was a surprise as many expected Walt Disney World
President Al Weiss to replace Pressler.</TE>
<TE>   Disney Chairman Downplays Growth</TE>
<TE>   Walt Disney Co. Chairman Michael Eisner said the stock market has
overreacted to Disney's problems. But the recovery he is forecasting,
analysts say, underscores just how tough times have been for the
once-dominant entertainment giant.</TE>
<TE>   In a speech at a Goldman Sachs &amp; Co. investor conference in
Manhattan, Eisner said he expects Disney to post strong double-digit
growth in earnings per share in 2003. The consensus of analysts
surveyed by Thomson First Call is for Disney to earn 56 cents a share
in fiscal 2002, which ended Monday, and 71 cents a share in fiscal
2003.</TE>
<TE>   That would be a 27% increase, easily meeting Eisner's double-digit
standard.</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, the company earned 95 cents a share as recently
as 1997, and nobody is projecting a quick return to that territory.</TE>
<TE>   Veteran Portnow Named</TE>
<TE>   Grammy President</TE>
<TE>   Veteran record executive Neil Portnow was named president of the
Grammy organization, the Santa Monica-based nonprofit that has been
engulfed in controversy for years.</TE>
<TE>   Portnow, 53, according to people who have worked with him, is a
low-key diplomat who probably will offer a drastically different
management style than his predecessor, C. Michael Greene, who
resigned this year amid misconduct allegations.</TE>
<TE>   Portnow, formerly chief of West Coast operations for Zomba Group,
declined to spell out his plans for the National Academy of Recording
Arts &amp; Sciences, as the Grammy organization is officially known. He
is expected to start his new job in the next few weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Development Planned</TE>
<TE>   for Downtown Anaheim</TE>
<TE>   A Los Angeles developer that played a role in the revitalization
of Santa Monica's Third Street Promenade, Old Pasadena and Birch
Street in Brea is looking to do the same thing for downtown Anaheim.</TE>

<HD>Southwest Still Soaring as Other Airlines Stall</HD>
<DH>Rivals and analysts are watching closely to see in which
markets the carrier will land next</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES F. PELTZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>DALLAS</DL>
<LD>Since last year's Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, the nation's airlines
have had to deal with jittery passengers, increased security and
mounting losses in the wake of a steep downturn in travel.</LD>
<LD>   And then there's the carriers' ever-present domestic concern: the
fun-loving, irreverent and always-profitable Southwest Airlines.</LD>
<LD>   While other airlines are bleeding billions of dollars and
shrinking fast, Dallas-based Southwest--the nation's sixth-largest
carrier and the biggest in the California market--is poised to eat
their lunch by taking more of their passengers and market share.</LD>
<TE>   Donald Carty, chairman of American Airlines and its parent AMR
Corp., said as much when he recently noted that American must adapt
to "an environment where ... lower-cost competition represents a much
bigger slice of the marketplace."</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, if the competition thought that legendary Southwest
co-founder Herb Kelleher would disappear after he retired as chief
executive in mid-2001, they were wrong. Despite keeping a very low
public profile, Kelleher, who remains chairman, is calling many of
the shots at Southwest along with his successor, Chief Executive Jim
Parker, and Southwest President Colleen Barrett.</TE>
<TE>   One of those shots is where Southwest will expand next, or whether
it will create more longer nonstop flights to supplement its core
short-haul service. Industry experts foresee an expansion of service
into the Chicago and Florida markets. "It's not a decision either one
of us [Parker or Barrett] is going to make, because it's one of the
things that Herb kept," Barrett said of Kelleher, who declined to be
interviewed. "He kept strategic planning, he kept fleet planning.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm sure he will discuss things with us," she said with her
tongue partly in her cheek, "but they've always been his call in the
end."</TE>
<TE>   Kelleher, 71, is the charismatic, zany force who created the
culture, the business model and the financial discipline that has set
Southwest apart during its 31-year history. And he's the one who
taught Southwest to take unrelenting aim at other airlines during
their times of woe to garner more business for the carrier.</TE>
<TE>   Southwest relishes moving into a city or route that's underused or
has been abandoned, launching flights with its cheap ticket prices
and then turning a profit thanks to its remarkably low operating
costs. That, too, is one of its trademarks. It's the reason Southwest
has not only doubled in size since 1995, but also has doubled its
share of total U.S. passenger traffic to 8% from 4% in that period.</TE>
<TE>   In 1991, for instance, US Airways pulled out of several California
cities. "We said, 'We'd love to be in Sacramento,' " recalled Gary
Kelly, Southwest's chief financial officer. "So boom, we went in."
That helped launch Southwest's dominance of the intra-California
market.</TE>
<TE>   In the last year, the airline grabbed even more passengers in the
West, after UAL Corp.'s United Airlines abandoned its West Coast
shuttle program, and in Baltimore and other Eastern cities after US
Airways grounded its Metrojet division.</TE>
<TE>   Southwest's low fares have never been more popular than during the
current travel slump and are another significant reason the bigger
carriers--with their higher costs and typically higher fares--are on
the ropes. With the growing help of the Internet, both business and
leisure travelers increasingly are searching for the cheapest fares,
playing right into Southwest's hands.</TE>
<TE>   "They are sitting on a kind of treasure trove," said Ron Kuhlmann,
vice president of aviation consulting firm Unisys R2A in Hayward,
Calif.</TE>
<TE>   Southwest's senior managers avoid talking publicly about
exploiting their competitors' troubles, in good part because
Southwest--with 2,800 daily flights to 58 cities--has its share of
problems. Its passenger revenue is down 9% for the first half of the
year, and its profit is less than half what it was a year ago.
Southwest's famous on-time performance has slipped noticeably in
recent months, which the carrier blames mostly on increased security
measures and bad weather.</TE>
<TE>   The company's stock also has plummeted 43% since it peaked at $22
a share in late February--it closed Friday at $12.48 a share--as
investors fret that the factors whipping the big carriers will impede
Southwest's growth. Even so, Southwest's total stock market value of
$9.7 billion remains twice that of all other major airlines combined.</TE>
<TE>   Southwest's executives acknowledge that the industry shakeout
gives their airline another opportunity to build up while the others
are tearing down. Southwest still has the money, the planes, the
people and--most of all--the will to swoop in wherever other carriers
pull out.</TE>
<TE>   "Adding new cities is something we have historically done, and we
will do it in the future," Parker said. "But we've never taken on
more than we could sustain."</TE>
<TE>   A Variety of Problems</TE>
<TE>   Airlines with the biggest troubles include US Airways, which is in
bankruptcy proceedings and plans to slash hundreds of flights as it
overhauls its system. United is teetering toward Chapter 11 and
probably will retrench regardless of whether it stays out of
Bankruptcy Court. Industry leader American also has announced plans
to trim its flight schedule, ground jetliners and eliminate 7,000
jobs.</TE>
<TE>   Their outlooks seem to grow dimmer by the day. The prospect of a
war against Iraq, with its attendant surge in jet-fuel prices and a
further drop in travel by skittish passengers, has pummeled airline
stocks to levels not seen in two decades. Airline executives,
meanwhile, recently went to Capitol Hill seeking more federal aid in
the form of relief from soaring insurance and security costs.</TE>
<TE>   As the other large carriers shrink, Southwest wants to keep
growing, though Parker and other executives are careful not to
suggest where the airline will expand next. That could well depend on
where those other airlines pull back. "If one of our competitors
reduces service in a market, it [that city] may very well rise to the
top of the list," Kelly said.</TE>
<TE>   "More nonstops is another way we can grow," Parker said, referring
to Southwest's bold strategy of expanding beyond its basic short-run
flights with routes that span the continent--a direct volley at
larger network airlines such as American and United. Last month
Southwest launched its first nonstop transcontinental service, from
Los Angeles to Baltimore.</TE>
<TE>   "Southwest is replacing traditional network carriers," analyst Ray
Neidl of Blaylock &amp; Partners said in a recent report.</TE>
<TE>   But Southwest won't just jump into any new airport or route,
cautioned Kuhlmann of Unisys R2A. Southwest always has avoided, where
possible, congested airports because they impede its efficiency, so
"I don't expect Southwest will go into Boston or San Francisco," he
said. (It flies to Providence, R.I., and Oakland instead.) Likewise,
"in a lot of their short-haul markets they're pretty much maxed out"
in terms of daily service, such as Southern California to the San
Francisco Bay area, he added.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, "I would expect Southwest is going to exploit further its
Chicago Midway-West Coast" service, and it might add more routes to
California and the West from its growing presence in Fort Lauderdale
and Orlando in Florida, Kuhlmann said.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. carriers lost more than $7 billion last year, slammed by the
recession, a precipitous drop in business travel, the general travel
downturn after the terrorist attacks, rising jet-fuel costs and by
higher labor contracts that they approved. The figures would have
been worse without a $15-billion federal bailout organized after
Sept. 11 that included $5 billion of cash grants disbursed among the
carriers.</TE>
<TE>   The other airlines slashed their operations and laid off more than
80,000 workers to save cash. Southwest neither trimmed its system nor
laid off employees--it has never had layoffs--and still finished 2001
with profit of $511 million (including one-time gains and charges) on
revenue of $5.6 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Many in the industry expected air travel to improve as this year
progressed, but it hasn't. Analysts predict that the industry, which
also is grappling with increased security and insurance costs, could
lose $7 billion this year.</TE>
<TE>   Southwest earned $124 million in the first half of this year and
is expected to turn a profit for all of 2002. Barrett said a profit
provides value not just to stockholders but to Southwest's 35,000
employees.</TE>
<TE>   "A non-growing company is the quickest way to have morale go to
pot," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Southwest's big competitors have tweaked their operations before
during financial slumps, but their condition is so grave this time
that they're talking about a radical overhaul of the way they do
business. Airlines such as American and United spend 10.5 cents to
11.5 cents to fly one passenger one mile. Southwest's cost: 7.4
cents.</TE>
<TE>   That's why Southwest can price its seats so low and still make
money. There are other reasons. Southwest flies only one type of
plane, the Boeing 737, which saves on maintenance and training costs.
Those planes are used more productively--Southwest quickly turns them
around at airports so the jets spend more time in the air--with
paying passengers--than on the ground.</TE>
<TE>   Experienced Executives</TE>
<TE>   For Parker and Barrett, learning their new jobs has been a baptism
by fire. They had succeeded Kelleher as CEO and president,
respectively, only three months before the terrorists struck New York
and the Pentagon and U.S. air travel was briefly grounded for the
first time.</TE>
<TE>   But they had the advantage of being longtime Southwest executives
who had worked closely with Kelleher and each other.</TE>
<TE>   They toil in windowless offices, just as Kelleher did--he once
said the sure sign of a bureaucrat is someone preoccupied with the
window space they have--at Southwest's headquarters at Dallas' Love
Field. Every few minutes, a Southwest jet touches down in front of
the building's main entrance.</TE>
<TE>   Parker is an engaging and easy-going 55-year-old who had been
Southwest's general counsel. He spends much of his time focused on
labor and financial matters and politely answering the recurring
questions about how he compares with the heralded, fun-loving
Kelleher.</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody can be another Herb Kelleher, and I haven't even tried,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   Kelleher, for his part, has refused most interview requests since
passing the baton, to keep the focus on Parker instead of him. "Herb
has made it easier by not having a high profile during this period,
and that was very thoughtful," Parker said.</TE>
<TE>   Barrett, the highest-ranking woman in the airline industry, began
as Kelleher's legal secretary in the 1960s and has been with him
since. She often is described as the alter ego of "Herbie," as she
calls him, but Barrett also has worked with Parker for years, so
"there has been no change for me" since Parker became CEO, she said.</TE>
<TE>   A self-described "communication freak" who nonetheless chooses her
words carefully during interviews, Barrett, 58, doesn't dispute
suggestions that she oversees Southwest's famed culture and customer
service, among other things. So Sept. 11 presented her with an
enormous test, because she believed she had to tell her upbeat
employees to cool it.</TE>
<TE>   "For the first time ever since our inception, I believe, I
actually put out a request ... that we needed to basically squash our
humor" for a while, Barrett recalled in her modest office, which is
chock-full of arts, crafts and memorabilia.</TE>
<TE>   "My feeling was that emotions were very raw" and not receptive to
Southwest's style, Barrett said.</TE>
<TE>   But Southwest was the first airline to resume advertising after
the attacks, and it wasn't long before it returned to its fun-loving
ways.</TE>
<TE>   But there's been nothing funny about the depressed level of ticket
revenue at Southwest and throughout the airline industry.</TE>
<TE>   "Times are really, really scary," Barrett said. "People aren't
willing to pay a whole lot more to travel." Yes, Southwest
specializes in selling low fares, but even Southwest needs to nudge
prices higher and get more people on its 737s to generate its profit
of old.</TE>
<TE>   "The challenge," Parker said, "will be to get them back in the
habit of paying us enough where we can make a reasonable profit,"
which is likely to make Southwest's rivals anything but upbeat.</TE>

<HD>Employer Needs to Catch Up on 'Catch-Up' Contributions</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LIZ PULLIAM WESTON</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Question: Last year, Congress passed a law that allows older workers
to make "catch-up" contributions to their retirement accounts. I am
over 50 and wanted to put $12,000 into my 401(k) this year--the
$11,000 maximum the law allows most employees, plus the $1,000
catch-up contribution. But I'm not being allowed to do so. My
employer, a large international company, is telling me that no one
can figure out how to implement the law. Did Congress and President
Bush pass a meaningless law? Please help clarify this bizarre twist.</LD>
<LD>   Answer: Bizarre? Not really. Remember, we're talking about tax law
here.</LD>
<LD>   There's always some confusion after a tax law is passed as experts
try to figure out exactly how to implement it. In this case, some
employers are indeed waiting for more government guidance about how
to revise their plans to include the new catch-up provisions.</LD>
<TE>   But to say that no one has figured it out is a stretch. About half
of the 163 large employers surveyed by benefits consultant Hewitt
Associates after the law was passed said they planned to have the
catch-up provision in place this summer. An additional 25% said they
would do so by the end of the year.</TE>
<TE>   Gather up a few of your over-50 compatriots and take these
statistics to the head of your human resources department. This is a
valuable benefit that won't cost employers all that much to
implement, so you should lobby hard to get it.</TE>
<TE>   Embrace Your</TE>
<TE>   Higher Deductible</TE>
<TE>   Q: My homeowners insurance company recently raised my deductible
to $500 from $250. I've called a few other companies, but their
quotes were too high because I've had three claims in the last four
years--one from hail damage, two from water damage. The total amount
for all the claims was less than $5,000. So I guess I'm stuck with my
current insurer, but is there anything I can do to fight this higher
deductible?</TE>
<TE>   A: Fight it? You should be embracing your higher deductible. In
fact, call them back and ask for one that's even higher--$1,000 would
be good.</TE>
<TE>   You shouldn't use your homeowners or auto insurance for damage you
can easily cover yourself. That's never been more true than today,
when insurers are routinely dropping customers who make numerous
claims. (And yes, unfortunately, three claims count as numerous,
especially when water damage is involved. Insurers are terrified of
the growing mold problem, which has cost them plenty in several
states.)</TE>
<TE>   The purpose of most insurance is to protect you against
devastating financial loss--the kind you can't recover from on your
own. Paying for the small stuff is a smart way to reduce your
insurance costs and--in your case--to keep your coverage in force.</TE>
<TE>   A Follow-Up ...</TE>
<TE>   A few weeks ago a California couple inquired about how they should
go about establishing residency in another state and avoid California
taxes on their pension. My response prompted a letter from John
Chiang, a member of California's Franchise Tax Board and chairman of
the State Board of Equalization, the two agencies in charge of tax
collection in the Golden State. Here's what he had to say:</TE>
<TE>   "You correctly stated that California no longer taxes pensions of
former residents who move out of state. However, the couple should be
aware that if they decide to rent or lease their California house
when they are away, the portion of their income derived from the
rental property is taxable by the state of California. While their
act of renting or leasing the house in California does not subject
their pension to income tax in this state, the pension and all other
sources of income worldwide will be used as a basis in determining
their income tax bracket in California.</TE>
<TE>   "I would also suggest that they submit a change of address to
their pension administrator as soon as they move, so their 1099R tax
form is mailed to their new address. In the event that the 1099R is
mailed to the California address, the couple will have the burden of
proving that they are no longer residents of California and have
established residency in another state."</TE>
<TE>   That was excellent advice, and thank you, Mr. Chiang, for passing
it along.</TE>

<HD>Holders of Converted IRAs Need to Act Fast for Tax Break</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KATHY M. KRISTOF</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If you converted an individual retirement account to a Roth IRA in
2001, the stock market's rotten performance this year may be a tax
break in the making.</LD>
<LD>   But only if you act fast.</LD>
<LD>   IRA owners who converted to a Roth IRA last year, and then watched
the value of the account collapse along with the stock market, have
until Oct. 15 to reverse--or "recharacterize"--the transaction.</LD>
<TE>   That won't restore the losses in the account, of course. But it
will allow the account holder to recoup income tax paid on investment
gains that have since disappeared.</TE>
<TE>   "It's one of the few second chances offered by the tax code," said
Ed Slott, a New York-based tax accountant and editor of a monthly
newsletter on individual retirement accounts. "It's kind of like
getting to bet on a horse race after it's run."</TE>
<TE>   Thousands of Americans have converted their traditional IRAs to
Roth IRAs in recent years, largely because Roth accounts--created by
Congress in 1997--often are seen as the better deal, tax-wise.</TE>
<TE>   Roth accounts offer no upfront tax breaks, but the money--what the
account holder contributes as well as any investment gains--is
withdrawn tax-free during retirement.</TE>
<TE>   A traditional IRA, by contrast, offers an upfront tax deduction
but the money is fully taxable when withdrawn.</TE>
<TE>   Transfer Triggers Tax</TE>
<TE>   The downside: When you shift investment assets from a traditional
IRA into a Roth IRA, you owe taxes on the value of the account at the
time it's converted. And the tax is figured at your ordinary income
tax rate--not the long-term capital gains rate, which usually is
lower.</TE>
<TE>   The tax is triggered regardless of whether the investments within
the IRA are sold or transferred to the Roth account. The taxable
income on the transaction is based on the market price of the
securities held in the IRA at the time of the conversion.</TE>
<TE>   For many taxpayers who did conversions in the last two years,
paying current-year taxes on income that remains locked in a
retirement account was made worse by the falling stock market, which
probably wiped out a sizable portion of the gains on which they were
paying taxes.</TE>
<TE>   Consider the plight of one of Slott's clients. His IRA was
converted to a Roth when it was worth $75,000. It's worth $1,000
today. A taxpayer in this situation could recover roughly $23,250 in
2001 income tax--assuming a 31% federal income tax bracket--if he
opts to reverse the conversion.</TE>
<TE>   It's too late to undo a conversion that was performed before 2001.
But savers who converted an IRA last year have until the final filing
deadline for the 2001 tax year--Oct. 15--to undo the conversion by
shifting the money from the Roth IRA back into a traditional IRA,
Slott said.</TE>
<TE>   Some taxpayers believe that they can't undo a conversion if
they've already filed a 2001 tax return, Slott said. But all that's
required in these situations is that the taxpayer file an amended
return--Form 1040X--and subtract the income previously reported from
the IRA conversion, said Don Roberts, a spokesman for the Internal
Revenue Service in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   For instance, Slott's client would subtract $75,000 from the
pension income reported on his 2001 return, claiming a $23,250 tax
overpayment on the 1040X. Taxpayers who file a 1040X can either ask
for a refund of the tax they paid on the conversion or have it
applied to their 2002 taxes, which will be due April 15.</TE>
<TE>   An added attraction is that the IRA can be converted back to a
Roth IRA later. But under tax rules, the new conversion can't be
performed until the next calendar year following the
conversion--2002--or 30 days from the date the account was
recharacterized, whichever is longer, said Roberts.</TE>
<TE>   For Information</TE>
<TE>   Several Web sites offer information on IRA conversions, including
www.rothira.com and www.fairmark.com/rothira. Most borkerage firm Web
sites have IRA info, and the IRS' Publication 590, which provides tax
info on retirement plans, is available at www.irs.gov.</TE>

<HD>The Latest in Dinosaurs</HD>
<DH>'The Lost World' combines vintage storytelling and digital
technology to refresh Doyle's adventure tale.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUSAN KING</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's brash explorer Professor George
Challenger, actor Bob Hoskins gets close to various prehistoric
creatures in A&amp;E's lavish new adaptation of the classic dinosaur tale
"The Lost World." While on location in the jungles of New Zealand
making the four-hour epic, Hoskins had his own close encounter with
an overly attentive indigenous bird.</LD>
<LD>   "There was a bird there called the weka," says the actor ("Mona
Lisa," "Who Framed Roger Rabbit"). "These birds can't fly. They are
very friendly but very noisy. The point is this weka seemed to take
to me for some reason. We had this camera up a tree and I was on the
ground. Every time I started talking, this weka piped in. I think he
wanted to be part of the film. Everywhere I went, this weka followed
me. He was like a big chicken with a long nose."</LD>
<LD>   "The Lost World," a co-production with the BBC that will be
televised Sunday and Monday, is filled with state-of-the-art
dinosaurs that were created by the team that designed the vividly
realistic creatures for the Emmy Award-winning Discovery Channel
documentary "Walking With Dinosaurs."</LD>
<TE>   "The Lost World" dinosaurs are a combination of animatronic
dinos--used for close-ups--and digitally created beasties created at
Framestore and Crawley Creatures special effects studio in London.</TE>
<TE>   It was Tim Haines, co-producer of "The Lost World" and producer of
"Walking With Dinosaurs," who approached the BBC about doing a
dramatic movie utilizing the technology they had created for "Walking
With Dinosaurs."</TE>
<TE>   "He said you have this successful documentary and we have the
technology," says director Stuart Orme. "Why don't we do a version of
'The Lost World'? So it was this suggestion that started it off."</TE>
<TE>   The creatures of "The Lost World" are even more extraordinary than
the ones in "Walking With Dinosaurs," especially in their skin
textures.</TE>
<TE>   "They made some real advances in technology from the time "Walking
With Dinosaurs' was done until the time we made 'Lost World,' " says
executive producer Delia Fine of A&amp;E.</TE>
<TE>   Though there have been numerous adaptations of Doyle's novel, most
notably the 1926 silent with Wallace Beery, recent ones have been
pretty cheesy.</TE>
<TE>   Fine doesn't believe that "Lost World," though, has worn out its
welcome with audiences. People of all ages just love dinosaurs.
"Certainly one of the reasons 'Jurassic Park' and that series of
movies have been so successful is that it fulfills a fantasy that we
have had since we were children," says Fine. Although the first
"Jurassic Park" sequel was also titled "The Lost World," it has no
connection to the Doyle story.</TE>
<TE>   "I can remember when I was a child, the very first thing I wanted
to be was a paleontologist. I think that for a lot of children it is
the first category of knowledge they really learn a lot about and may
know more about than their parents."</TE>
<TE>   (In conjunction with "The Lost World," A&amp;E will also present a new
two-hour documentary, "The Lost Dinosaurs of Egypt," on Tuesday
evening.)</TE>
<TE>   "The Lost World" finds Hoskins' brilliant, self-confident and
controversial professor leading an expedition to a remote region in
the Amazon still inhabited by prehistoric creatures.</TE>
<TE>   Peter Falk plays a fanatic missionary; James Fox is the stodgy
professor Leo Summerlee; Tom Ward is the dashing adventurer, Lord
Roxton; Matthew Rhys is cub reporter Edward Malone; and Elaine
Cassidy is Agnes, the missionary's strong-willed niece.</TE>
<TE>   Hoskins was very familiar with "The Lost World," having been a
huge fan of Doyle. "I was totally obsessed when I was a kid with
Sherlock Holmes, and then I went into the Challenger books. There
were about three Challenger books, but the other two didn't come up
to anywhere near 'The Lost World.' He wanted to do a series on
Challenger. He quite liked the character, but the demand for Sherlock
Holmes was too much."</TE>
<TE>   The actor relished the opportunity to play someone as bombastic as
Challenger. "He's rude to people. He has no patience for anybody. You
know, he's a completely ruthless man. He does everything he wants to
do and without any considerations for society or etiquette."</TE>
<TE>   Part one of "The Lost World" airs Sunday at 8 and 10 p.m. on A&amp;E;
part two airs Monday at 8 and 10 p.m. The network has rated it TV-PG
(may be unsuitable for young children). "The Lost Dinosaurs of Egypt"
can be seen Tuesday at 9 p.m. on A&amp;E.</TE>

<HD>A Problem With Alternative Tax</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Re: "Alternative Tax Can Be a Big Blow to Many," [Personal Finance,
Sept. 29].</LD>
<LD>   Problems with the alternative minimum tax are no accident.
Republicans and Democrats have been playing a game of chicken with
the AMT for years.</LD>
<LD>   Presidents Reagan (1986), Bush (1990) and Clinton (1993) all
raised the AMT tax rate and intentionally chose not to index the tax
to inflation.</LD>
<TE>   George W. Bush then used the unindexed AMT as a shield to hide the
intended cost and distribution of his 2001 tax cut. Republicans
planned to repeal the AMT later as a "technical correction." They
knew that Democrat-controlled states such as California would be the
first to feel the pain as the AMT vice tightened. Republicans gambled
that continuing favorable budget revisions would allow AMT repeal
without spending cuts or deficits.</TE>
<TE>   The gamble failed. Both parties have to acknowledge that the
projected revenue from the AMT is more of a mirage than any Enron or
WorldCom sham: Voters won't sit still for this underhanded tax. It's
time to get serious about cutting spending and raising taxes to close
the rapidly widening gap covered up by phantom AMT revenue.</TE>
<TE>   Keith Jarett</TE>
<TE>   Lafayette, Calif.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The tax laws concerning the AMT should be changed to allow a
taxpayer two years after the exercise of the option to sell the stock
before collecting the respective AMT. Also, the current $3,000
maximum capital loss allowed to offset ordinary income needs to be
substantially increased (at least to $10,000).</TE>
<TE>   This is a relevant point because now when the stock is sold it is
a capital loss subject to the $3,000 annual limit, even though the
government expects the full tax to be collected on the unrealized
gains. How unfair.</TE>
<TE>   Marvin Karelitz</TE>
<TE>   Calabasas</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Like so many investors who guessed wrong, Ron Speltz points the
finger outward, not inward. His statement " ... I have received
nothing" is incorrect. He received the revenue and should pay taxes
on it.</TE>

<HD>California May Need to Rethink Budget</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>James Flanigan treats California's budget deficit as a failure of
political courage to raise taxes, although it actually reflects the
state's growing overpopulation ["Government Debt, Not Policies, Could
Threaten Business Climate," Sept. 25].</LD>
<LD>   He criticizes inadequate spending on roads, schools, water and
housing. These infrastructure shortages reveal how California's
population has outgrown economies of scale and reached the point of
diminishing returns.</LD>
<LD>   As Flanigan himself archly observes, even the state's high home
prices, high taxes and "poor business climate" never stopped its
population growth.</LD>
<TE>   Now that California's population exceeds Canada's, industry cannot
cure state budget shortfalls by importing more immigrant labor to
increase the tax base. These workers make too little to stimulate the
economy with their spending, or to pay their share of taxes for
maintaining an increasingly overburdened infrastructure.</TE>
<TE>   Infrastructure deterioration will prove the least of our problems
as we outgrow our resources. Consider that every year California adds
500,000 people while losing 50,000 acres of farmland to development.
How long before the rising curve of population crosses the falling
curve of food production?</TE>
<TE>   Business and political leaders should look beyond balancing this
year's state budget and envision a viable populace living within its
resources.</TE>

<HD>Pressler's Disney Success Was by Accident</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>We are told Paul Pressler [former head of Walt Disney Co.'s theme
parks] was a rising star, a tight-fisted manager and that he was good
for shareholders.</LD>
<LD>   Pressler was the hero of those who thought shareholders were more
important than audiences. He is the architect of the philosophy of
taking as much money from the customer as you can and delivering as
meager an experience as you can get away with.</LD>
<LD>   Pressler took over Disneyland in 1994. His first summer there, the
park opened Indiana Jones, a high-tech screamer of a thrill ride
based on one of Hollywood's most valuable franchises--a project
already under construction when he arrived. Crowds swarmed.</LD>
<TE>   His second summer, he ended the Main Street Electrical Parade.
Crowds filled the park well into the fall to see it "the last time."
In his first two years Disneyland had huge attendance.</TE>
<TE>   One of those successes was based on decisions made before he
arrived, one was a providential result of a very bad decision. The
replacement parade, Light Magic, is still referred to by cast members
and others in the industry as Light Tragic. But those two huge years
made Pressler's reputation.</TE>
<TE>   And then there is California Adventure. Any new theme park built
to meet the expectations of the Disney audience will cost about $1
billion. Pressler decided it could be done for $700 million--a figure
considered unrealistically low by longtime company insiders. One of
his concerns was that the new park should not upstage Disneyland.</TE>
<TE>   He certainly succeeded there.</TE>
