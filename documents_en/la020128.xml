<HD>Sept. 11 Pushes Employees to Make a Self-Help Discovery</HD>
<DH>Many seek out counseling through a program offered in the
workplace.</DH>

<LD>The intense anxiety, sleepless nights and depression that followed
Sept. 11 prompted many Americans to seek professional counseling,
perhaps for the first time in their lives. For many of those people,
the first step was a phone call to an employee-assistance program, a
service that is available to more than 65 million U.S. workers.</LD>
<LD>   More than 900 companies requested help in coping with the crisis
in the week after the events in New York and the Washington, D.C.,
area, according to Magellan Behavioral Systems, a major supplier of
employee-assistance programs to American business. The number of
calls to such programs rose about 20% nationwide, according to
WellPoint, another company that offers them. The aftermath of Sept.
11 provided many workers with their first glimpse of such services
and also heightened the visibility of these programs, which can be an
important resource for dealing with the difficult issues of everyday
life. Many consumers don't appreciate the role these programs can
play in helping people cope with personal or family emotional
problems, and that they allow workers to seek short-term
mental-health care without tapping their regular health insurance.</LD>
<TE>   They are an outgrowth of counseling programs that began 50 years
ago to help workers with alcohol-related problems. They expanded in
the 1970s to help with drug-abuse problems, particularly for children
of employees, and later to include marriage and relationship
counseling. In the 1980s, some programs began offering assistance
with child-care issues or situations involving aging parents.</TE>
<TE>   The program's goal is to help with worker productivity. It is a
tool that tries to reduce stress on the job, cut down on absenteeism
and cut back on distractions for workers. About 70% of companies with
500 or more workers have employee-assistance programs. Cost is
relatively cheap: Companies pay, on average, about $11.40 a year per
worker, according to Open Minds, a survey company that follows the
industry.</TE>
<TE>   It is important to remember, however, that the counseling is
designed for short-term assistance with problems that are moderate in
nature. It's not intended for people with clinical depression or who
need long-term psychotherapy. Most employee-assistance programs will
pay for three to six counseling sessions in which people can discuss
problems they are having at work or home.</TE>
<TE>   Program counselors, usually psychologists or social workers, are
ethically bound to keep the discussions confidential, with no reports
to corporate management. "Our feeling is, if you don't have
confidentiality, then you don't have an EAP," said Stuart Hales,
communications director for the Employee Assistance Professionals
Assn. in Arlington, Va. Most companies have a toll-free number that
workers can call to speak to a counselor and arrange for an
appointment.</TE>
<TE>   The most common reason that people contact the assistance programs
are for what health professionals call an "adjustment disorder," such
as a marital breakup. "You need somebody to talk to," said Russ
Newman, executive director for professional practice at the American
Psychological Assn. "A rapid assessment is done and there is a rapid
attempt to solve an immediate problem."</TE>
<TE>   Studies have shown that about half the people who receive mental
health services show measurable improvement--defined as feeling
better and functioning better at home and work--within eight
counseling sessions.</TE>
<TE>   Traditionally, some people have not sought help for emotional
problems or mental illness because they feared they would be
stigmatized if others found out. But such concerns seem to be
lessening with younger workers, said Jody Dean, a psychologist who
manages employee-assistance programs at Hughes Electronics in El
Segundo. "We have a very young company--the average employee is 33
years old," said Dean. "To them, seeing a therapist is a regular part
of their life. You work out, do yoga and see a therapist."</TE>
<TE>   One obvious advantage of employee-assistance counseling over, say,
therapy services under regular health insurance is that it is free:
There are no deductibles or co-payments, nor do you need to get a
referral from a primary care doctor.</TE>
<TE>   Essentially, you decide whether you need to get professional help
for whatever is bothering you. "These are the problems of daily life
everyone deals with, problems not considered a mental illness," said
Cheryl Montero, head of mental health services for WellPoint, the
health insurance company that operates Blue Cross of California.
Getting something resolved in five visits "may prevent the issue from
turning into something more serious six or eight months later," she
said.</TE>
<TE>   With regular health insurance, mental health benefits typically
are limited: For example, your plan may put a cap on the maximum
number of visits allowed to a therapist in a year. A good
employee-assistance counselor will act as an advocate, helping the
patient get to the next level of needed care. The counselor can make
a referral to a psychiatrist or therapist within the patient's
regular health insurance programs. And he should also be
knowledgeable about community resources, local mental health
agencies, drug and alcohol self-help groups.</TE>
<TE>   "As the health insurance system has gotten more difficult to
navigate, EAP personnel have taken on the role of advocate," said
Newman of the America Psychological Assn. "They will help people get
the most out of their insurance plan benefits," he said.</TE>

<LD>Had you been in Baltimore on Friday, you could have sneaked your way
in to one of the country's oldest medical buildings (Davidge Hall, at
the University of Maryland). Sitting cheek by jowl with 200 doctors
and students, you would have finally learned what killed Herod the
Great, the king of ancient Judea known as the infamous "slaughterer
of the innocents."</LD>
<LD>   The annual "historical clinicopathological conference," sponsored
by Maryland's Department of Veterans Affairs and the University of
Maryland, is a fun meet where doctors of various stripes discuss how
this or that famous person met his end. Did Edgar Allen Poe die of
alcohol withdrawal or was it possibly rabies? What offed Ludwig van
Beethoven, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, the Roman emperor Claudius or the
Athenian statesman Pericles?</LD>
<LD>   This was the conference's eighth year, says organizer Dr. Philip
Mackowiak. Normally, such meets (which help medical students and
residents hone their diagnostic skills) involve less-famous folks and
more recent deaths.</LD>
<TE>   A chosen doctor, called the "discussant," presents the facts of a
case to an audience of doctors and students, then delivers his or her
diagnosis. A general chin-wag ensues.</TE>
<TE>   This particular meeting is much the same--except that Mackowiak
happened to be reading about Edgar Allan Poe's death some years back
and playfully decided to start a meeting with a historical bent. He
picked Poe as the first subject, in 1995. No one was told they were
dealing with someone famous, but it didn't take long for the
discussant to figure it out.</TE>
<TE>   These days, "it's become such a major production and everybody
knows it's a historical clinicopathological conference," Mackowiak
says. "The exercise now is to figure out who the person is and come
up with a diagnosis."</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Jan Hirschmann, this year's discussant, was assigned King
Herod as a subject--and a grisly-sounding demise to dissect. Herod's
death was preceded by severe itching, gut pain, convulsions,
breathlessness and (as if those weren't enough) gangrene of the
genitalia. Some people, noted Hirschmann, think Herod died from
gonorrhea. Hirschmann begged to differ, concluding that itching and
most of the king's other symptoms were better explained by chronic
kidney failure. (The only ill-fitting fact was that nasty gangrene;
Hirschmann proposed that Herod also had an infection called
Fournier's gangrene.)</TE>
<TE>   Here are a few other famous people and diagnoses from prior years:</TE>
<TE>   * Mozart. He died at age 35 with a whole slew of symptoms,
including fever, sweats, a rash and severe bodily swelling--and
doctors through the years have blamed everything from tuberculosis to
syphilis. The discussant, in reviewing the case, focused on the
swelling--which can be caused by liver disease, kidney disease or
heart failure. Liver disease was out (no jaundice), kidney disease
was discounted too (no delirium early in the disease). The verdict
was congestive heart failure, probably caused by the rheumatic fever
sweeping Vienna at the time.</TE>
<TE>   * Claudius, emperor of Rome. He died in AD 54 after a meal of
mushrooms, first suffering pain, diarrhea, low blood pressure and
difficulty breathing--likely from the fungal toxin muscarine. But he
also had a nervous system problem called dystonia, says Mackowiak,
and this neurological condition might have given the toxin more
clout.</TE>
<TE>   * Greek politician Pericles. He met his end during the plague of
Athens during the 5th century BC, and it's been suggested that the
epidemic, which led to the end of the city's golden age, was caused
by anything from bubonic plague to ebola virus. But the diagnosis at
the conference was typhus.</TE>
<TE>   * Gen. George A. Custer. Custer, of the U.S. Cavalry, of course,
was killed at the Battle of Little Bighorn during that famous "last
stand" against the Indians. But did another condition help his death
along? "He was a very, very famous figure and a very successful
general but he orchestrated the greatest defeat in the history of the
United States Army at the hands of Native Americans," says Mackowiak.
"The question became, 'Was he unbalanced?'"</TE>
<TE>   A careful review of the historical literature suggests he didn't
have any major psychopathology but was certainly on the flamboyant
side and might have had a slight personality disorder.</TE>

Beethoven and Poe) at www.va-umd.org/pages/main.htm.</TE>

<HD>Monitors Found Ineffective in Predicting Premature
Deliveries</HD>

<LD>Home monitors that measure contractions in pregnant women are not
effective at predicting which women will go into early labor and have
a premature delivery, according to Ohio researchers.</LD>
<LD>   Obstetricians are eager to predict--and prevent--premature births
because the infants generally have developmental delays that can
affect them throughout their lives. Although earlier, smaller studies
have shown that the devices are not very helpful, doctors have
continued to recommend their use anyway, at a cost that can run about
$100 a day.</LD>
<LD>   The portable devices are worn on a belt around the abdomen. They
record contractions of the uterus and transmit the data by telephone
to a physician's office, where they are monitored by a specially
trained nurse.</LD>
<TE>   The monitors are used by women who are considered to be at high
risk of premature delivery because of a previous premature birth, who
are carrying more than one fetus, or who have high blood pressure.
Nearly 12% of infants are born prematurely--at less than 37 weeks of
gestation.</TE>
<TE>   A team headed by Dr. Jay D. Iams of Ohio State University studied
306 women at high risk of premature delivery. The women wore the
monitors for two hours a day twice a week during the early stages of
pregnancy and at least four times a week after the 28th week.</TE>
<TE>   The team reported in the Jan. 24 New England Journal of Medicine
that they found virtually no difference in the number of contractions
between those women who delivered prematurely and those who did not.
The monitors were manufactured by Matria Healthcare Inc. The team
also attempted to use ultrasound measurements of the cervix and blood
testing for a protein called fetal fibronectin to predict premature
labor but concluded that those were not effective either.</TE>
<TE>   The study was sponsored by the National Institute of Child Health
and Human Development.</TE>

<TE>   Zinc Helps Children With Sickle Cell Anemia</TE>
<TE>   Zinc supplements can restore normal growth in children with sickle
cell anemia, a new study has found. Children with the disease often
are small for their age and do not grow to full height.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Babette S. Zemel and her colleagues at the Children's Hospital
of Philadelphia studied 38 children, ages 4 to 10 years, with sickle
cell disease.</TE>
<TE>   Twenty-four of them were short in stature for their age, but only
six had abnormally low levels of zinc in their blood.</TE>
<TE>   Half of the children were randomly assigned to receive a small
daily dose of cherry syrup containing 10 milligrams of zinc; the rest
received cherry syrup only.</TE>
<TE>   The team reported in the February American Journal of Clinical
Nutrition that the children receiving the zinc showed significantly
greater increases in overall height, sitting height, knee height and
arm circumference after 12 months of treatment. In an editorial in
the same journal, Dr. Ananda S. Prasad of the Wayne State University
School of Medicine concluded that "these results provide further
evidence that zinc deficiency resulting in growth retardation is a
major clinical problem in patients with sickle cell disease."</TE>
<TE>   The research was sponsored by Children's Hospital and the National
Institutes of Health.</TE>

<TE>   Chemical Shown to Block Lethal Liver Toxins</TE>
<TE>   A chemical originally developed as a weedkiller has been approved
by the Food and Drug Administration as the first effective treatment
for a rare but lethal liver disease called hereditary tyrosinemia
type 1, or HT-1.</TE>
<TE>   The genetic disorder affects an estimated 100 children in the
United States and perhaps several hundred more worldwide. Children
with the disorder are unable to properly break down the amino acid
tyrosine; instead, their body produces a toxin that destroys the
liver.</TE>
<TE>   Those who survive infancy rarely reach their 20s without a liver
transplant. The only therapy before now was limiting intake of
tyrosine, but that amino acid is a part of proteins needed for
growth.</TE>
<TE>   Researchers from Rare Disease Therapeutics in Nashville discovered
that a drug called Orfadin can block the formation of the toxins.</TE>
<TE>   In an ongoing study of 180 patients who began taking the drug in
infancy, 88% have survived at least 4 years; usually, only about 29%
of children with the disease live to age 4. The drug is very costly:
about $12,000 a year for an infant and as much as $60,000 per year
for an older child. But the company will provide it at a lower cost
or for free to families not covered by insurance through a program
run by the National Organization for Rare Diseases, (800) 999-NORD.</TE>

<TE>   New Booklet Outlines Parenting Techniques</TE>
<TE>   The National Institute of Child Health and Human Development has
released a new parenting booklet that distills 30 years of research
on effective parenting techniques. The booklet, "Adventures in
Parenting: How Responding, Preventing, Monitoring, Mentoring and
Modeling Can Help You Be a Successful Parent," suggests ways to
become a more effective, consistent and attentive parent.</TE>
<TE>   The booklet is available from the Institute free of charge by
calling (800) 370-2943, or at www.nichd.nih.gov.</TE>
<TE>   CDC Reports Rubella Virtually Gone From U.S.</TE>
<TE>   German measles (rubella), which once infected tens of thousands of
Americans each year and caused large numbers of birth defects, has
been almost completely eliminated in the United States, according to
the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.</TE>
<TE>   There were nearly 58,000 cases of rubella in the United States in
1969, the year the rubella vaccine was introduced. In 1999, there
were only 272 cases, the researchers reported in the Jan. 23 Journal
of the American Medical Assn. Almost all of those cases were in
Latino adults born in other countries, especially Mexico, the CDC
said.</TE>

<HD>Activated Charcoal Works as Poison Antidote</HD>
<DH>A study suggests the powdery substance should be kept in
medicine cabinet along with ipecac.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL>CHICAGO</DL>
<LD>Activated charcoal, a poison antidote used in emergency rooms for
decades, can be easily used in children at home and may help prevent
a trip to the hospital, a study has found.</LD>
<LD>   The substance is a fine powder form of processed charcoal that
binds to many types of poisons and can keep them from being absorbed
into the bloodstream. Stocked by some pharmacies, it can be mixed at
home with water, juice or soft drinks, and also comes premixed with
water.</LD>
<LD>   While American Academy of Pediatrics guidelines still recommend
that parents of young children keep a bottle of ipecac syrup on hand
for accidental poisonings, many local poison control centers have
started recommending home use of activated charcoal as well.</LD>
<TE>   Ipecac works for substances such as toxic plants or vitamin
overdoses, while charcoal is considered more effective for a broad
range of household items including certain cough medicines,
painkillers and disinfectant cleaners.</TE>
<TE>   Home use of activated charcoal has been limited because many
parents don't know about it or are uncertain how to administer it,
Kentucky researchers reported in last month's issue of Pediatrics.
Their study of accidental poisonings in Kentucky found that parents
could successfully use activated charcoal at home.</TE>
<TE>   In 115 out of 138 cases for which the substance was recommended
and instructions on use were given, children were able to be treated
at home, with no complications. The 23 cases treated in emergency
rooms involved children whose parents didn't have activated charcoal
at home and whose local pharmacies didn't stock it.</TE>
<TE>   In 30 of the cases treated at home, caregivers reported some
difficulty using activated charcoal, but all ultimately administered
it successfully, the researchers said.</TE>
<TE>   In many of the home cases, children received the substance within
an hour of ingesting poison, which is optimal for reducing poison
absorption, said authors Henry Spiller of Kentucky's Regional Poison
Center in Louisville and Dr. George Rodgers of the University of
Louisville. It's also a lot quicker than the time it would have taken
to get them emergency room treatment, they said.</TE>
<TE>   "Greater efforts need to be put into educating parents about the
need to stock activated charcoal in the home in advance of a
poisoning," they said. Pharmacists and pediatricians, too, should be
made aware that the substance can effectively be used at home, they
said.</TE>

<HD>Polenta Has Potential as a Source of Protein</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SHELDON MARGEN and DALE A. OGAR</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Several years ago, we started seeing polenta on trendy menus.
Sometimes it was an appetizer, sometimes a main course, sometimes
even a dessert. It's a new treat that is quite old.</LD>
<LD>   An American Indian product, polenta is basically ground cornmeal;
in Italy, however, it is cornmeal that is cooked slowly, spread out,
cooled and topped with sauces, cheese, vegetables, even powdered
sugar.</LD>
<LD>   By itself, corn--and thus polenta--is only moderately nutritious.
A two-thirds-cup serving of fresh corn kernels provides just over 10%
of the recommended daily allowance for vitamin C and about a quarter
of the RDA for folacin.</LD>
<TE>   Yellow corn contains about 6% of the RDA for vitamin A (in the
form of beta carotene), but white corn has none.</TE>
<TE>   Corn is fairly high in protein but low in the essential amino
acids lysine and tryptophan. However, as with most other vegetables
and grain products, by combining corn with legumes or animal
products, you can obtain a fairly complete protein mix.</TE>
<TE>   Although corn is high in the B vitamin niacin, it is in a form
that the human body cannot use. When American Indians ground their
corn to make tortillas or cornmeal, they added an alkaline substance,
such as lime (the mineral, not the fruit), that released the niacin
from the corn. Thus, they were able to rely on corn as a dietary
staple. However, in populations that did not do this--in the Southern
United States during the 19th and 20th centuries, for example--the
rate of pellagra, or niacin deficiency, became epidemic.</TE>
<TE>   If you have ever noticed a bitter taste when you make something
from cornmeal, it is because the polyunsaturated oil in the corn
becomes rancid quickly after the corn is ground. If you want your
corn bread or polenta to be good and sweet, and you don't grind your
own, buy the freshest cornmeal you can find and keep it airtight in
the refrigerator.</TE>
<TE>   Polenta is available in many forms. The specially ground coarse
meal is available prepackaged or in bulk. Quick-cooking varieties are
available, but polenta is usually cooked slowly (about 30 minutes)
with 4 cups of liquid to 1 cup of cornmeal.</TE>
<TE>   Ready-to-slice polenta is also available commercially, and recipes
abound in cookbooks. As with many simple foods, it is possible to
dress up polenta to make it as high-fat as many meats, but there are
also fat-free ways to prepare it.</TE>

<HD>One Egg Debate That's Not Over Easy</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Perhaps you've never added them to your shopping cart, but you've
probably seen them at your local farmer's market or health food
store: fertile eggs.</LD>
<LD>   You may have asked yourself the question: Are fertile eggs any
better for me than regular eggs?</LD>
<LD>   Health experts say there's no nutritional difference between
fertile eggs and conventional, or infertile, eggs. There's also no
apparent difference in taste. The whitish area at the center of the
yolk in a fertile egg has a slightly different appearance from an
infertile egg. And the fertile variety will also cost you a bit more
because they are more expensive to produce.</LD>
<TE>   The main appeal of fertile eggs seems to be social consciousness.
Unlike a typical commercial poultry operation, hens used to produce
fertile eggs are not kept in cages. They are allowed to roam and
roost freely--with roosters.</TE>
<TE>   Some people believe that free-roaming hens are surely happier--and
more likely to produce eggs that are healthier. "They feel it is a
more natural process for the chicken, and some groups have the
opinion and belief that they are a better egg," says David Will,
sales manager for Chino Valley Ranchers in Arcadia, which markets
Nutri-Fresh fertile eggs.</TE>
<TE>   But Francine Bradley, an extension poultry specialist at UC Davis'
Department of Animal Science, scoffs at the notion. "People think
these hens all want to have [roosters] running around with them," she
says. "In buying these eggs, people are supporting a poultry
lifestyle that says this is somehow better for the hens of the world.
But scientifically, there is no support for that."</TE>
<TE>   In any case, fertile eggs aren't for everyone. Some people are
turned off by the possibility of seeing a developing embryo growing
inside the eggs. And under Jewish dietary laws, fertile eggs are not
kosher.</TE>

<LD>A few years ago when covering for a fellow physician, I met Mrs. L.,
a 77-year-old woman hospitalized for pneumonia. When I went to
examine her lungs, I was greatly surprised. Not only was she missing
both breasts, but also much of her breastbone and left rib cage. I
could practically see her heart pumping. It was separated from the
outside world only by a layer of skin.</LD>
<LD>   American surgeons in the 1950s often performed a highly
disfiguring operation--the extended radical mastectomy--for women
with cancers of the inner half of the breast. Removal of breastbone
and ribs, in addition to the breast and chest wall muscles, enabled
surgeons to take out as many cancer cells as possible. But having
read about an operation was not the same as meeting someone who had
experienced it.</LD>
<LD>   I asked Mrs. L. about her breast cancer. As expected, she told me
that in 1954, she had noted a lump in the inner portion of her left
breast and then undergone surgery. In 1978, doctors removed her right
breast for a second cancer. She told me I could read about it in her
chart.</LD>
<TE>   So I did, encountering a vivid story. As was routine in the 1950s,
the biopsy of Mrs. L.'s lump and her subsequent extended radical
mastectomy had occurred during the same operation. She had awakened
to learn both that she had cancer and that doctors had removed her
breast and much of her chest wall. Mrs. L. was in considerable pain
for days, and although she had signed a consent form, she was
distressed about what had happened. "Why didn't the head nurse tell
me I was going to have my breast off," she had asked, "so I could
have gotten myself prepared for the thing?"</TE>
<TE>   When I made rounds the next day, I asked Mrs. L. about being a
40-year survivor of breast cancer. She seemed very pleased with her
care. For one thing, Mrs. L. had loved her doctors. She recalled how
proud they had been when she did not experience any postoperative arm
swelling, a common complication of radical breast surgery. In fact,
the old chart contained photographs of a young Mrs. L., wearing
pearls and performing arm exercises. I gently mentioned what I had
read, that it appeared she had been in a lot of pain and had been
quite upset about her extensive surgery. Mrs. L did not deny this but
did not seem too concerned. "Those radicals work," she informed me.
"Either you want to live or to die."</TE>
<TE>   I knew from my research that most surgeons stopped performing
extended radical mastectomies in the 1960s because the operation
provided no better survival than less extensive procedures. Indeed,
Mrs. L.'s pathology report showed that her cancer had not spread
beyond her breast. But I didn't tell her that she would have survived
even if the surgeons had removed only her breast or perhaps only the
lump.</TE>
<TE>   One characteristic of modern breast cancer therapy is that doctors
routinely treat what may not be there. Thus, radiotherapy and
chemotherapy are often administered based on the assumption that
invisible cancer remains after the breast lump has been removed. In
this sense, treatment today is not all that different from what Mrs.
L. received. Nor are the responses of survivors, who understandably
want to think that the "extra" therapy saved their lives.</TE>
<TE>   This same phenomenon characterizes recent efforts at prevention.
Today, women may take pills, such as tamoxifen, to lower their future
risk of breast cancer. They may also choose genetic testing, which
can identify women with a very high likelihood of developing the
disease.</TE>
<TE>   For their peace of mind, some women who test positive for genetic
mutations are even undergoing preventive breast removal. But as Mrs.
L.'s case reminds us, many of these operations will not prolong or
save lives. That is, the women who choose them may never, in
retrospect, have developed breast cancer, let alone have died from
the disease.</TE>
<TE>   Fortunately, one thing has chanced since the 1950s. Patients today
should never awake from disfiguring breast operations that physicians
have chosen for them. It is women themselves who can--and
should--decide which risks are and are not acceptable.</TE>

<HD>In Fixx's Case, Genes Overtook Exercise</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BENEDICT CAREY</AU>
<BD>TIMES HEALTH WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the summer of 1984, Jim Fixx appeared very much in his prime. The
author of the 1977 bestseller "The Complete Book of Running" had
transformed himself from an overweight, chain-smoking young man into
an exemplar of good health--and inspired millions to do the same. He
was running 10 miles a day. He was playing tennis. He was 52, famous
and very fit.</LD>
<LD>   And one Friday, while traveling in Vermont, he decided to go for a
run. On the afternoon of July 20, Fixx set out from a motel where he
was staying--and never returned. A motorcyclist found his body lying
beside Route 15 in Hardwick later that day. Soon doctors had
determined the cause of death: heart failure. The autopsy exam showed
that three of Fixx's coronary arteries were damaged by
arteriosclerosis, and one was almost completely blocked.</LD>
<LD>   The irony of the death was lost on no one. Skeptics of Fixx's
jogging gospel said the man was a victim of his own compulsion, that
in the end it was the running that had killed him. Others dismissed
the man and the message in one breath. "A lot of people heard the
news and said, 'Aha, I told you so, I knew the running wasn't doing
much good,'" says Amby Burfoot, winner of the 1968 Boston Marathon
and now executive editor of Runner's World magazine.</LD>
<TE>   Yet doctors who had followed Fixx's career saw a more complex
picture. It was clear, for instance, that Fixx had a strong family
history of heart disease: His father had a heart attack at 35 and
died of another one at 43. It was not clear how closely the younger
Fixx had been monitoring his own cardiovascular health. If he had any
warning of a heart condition, his former wife told the New York
Times, he ignored it.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Tom Bassler, a California pathologist and acquaintance of
Fixx, said the author had been planning to get examined. "I recall
that he'd been scheduled to have a treadmill test that very next
week," Bassler said in an interview.</TE>
<TE>   If he'd had the exam earlier, it could have saved his life,
doctors say. A physician who detected evidence of advanced
arteriosclerosis might have put Fixx on medication or even
recommended a bypass operation, either of which could have extended
his life. "Jim Fixx was running against his genes, and today we would
put him on statin drugs and watch him very closely," says Dr. Nancy
Lane, a UC San Francisco rheumatologist who studies the effects of
exercise.</TE>
<TE>   Speculation aside, doctors say the larger lesson of Fixx's death
has to do with the limitations of exercise as the key to long life.</TE>
<TE>   On the one hand, the author outlived his father by almost 10
years.</TE>
<TE>   On the other, "his death demonstrated that just because you're in
good shape doesn't mean that other things are not going to get you,"
said Dr. Jonathan Chang, an orthopedic surgeon, former competitive
runner and professor at USC. "You cannot completely outrun your
inheritance."</TE>
<TE>   Ask Alberto Salazar. At 43, the former world record-holder in the
marathon and two-time Olympian is on cholesterol medication and
watching his blood pressure. "Even running 40 miles a week, like I
do, I still have to pay attention to these things," he said. "There's
a family history there."</TE>

<HD>Bright Lights, Less Depression?</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HILARY WALDMAN</AU>
<BD>COURANT STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Whoever thought that a daily bath of bright fluorescent light would
take its place alongside the pill bottle and the therapist's couch as
an accepted and effective treatment for winter depression?</LD>
<LD>   Then again, who 20 years ago would have imagined that the blues
that sometimes creep in as the mercury dips and the days darken would
take a place alongside phobia and anxiety in the psychiatric field's
phone book-thick manual of common disorders?</LD>
<LD>   Now, as light therapy for seasonal affective disorder, or SAD, has
matured into a mainstream treatment for a very mainstream malady,
researchers are finding evidence that light may also have a place in
treating more chronic, year-round depression.</LD>
<TE>   A small study published late last year by researchers at Wesleyan
University in Middletown, Conn., and Columbia University in New York
found that an hourlong bath of bright light worked as well as
antidepressant medications in half of the patients studied.</TE>
<TE>   The researchers also found that treatment with high-density
negative ions was equally effective. The negative ions--charged
particles of oxygen--are blown through a high-powered air purifier.</TE>
<TE>   "The startling thing about chronic depression is it is [resistant]
to treatment," said Michael Terman, director of the winter depression
program at Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center in Manhattan. "If
light is a factor, at least we can treat it easily."</TE>
<TE>   Terman and Namni Goel, an assistant professor of psychology at
Wesleyan, are trying to recruit 60 chronically depressed people in
Connecticut and New York to participate in a controlled trial
comparing the effectiveness of bright light, high-density negative
ions and low-density negative ions in elevating spirits.</TE>
<TE>   Ellen, a 37-year-old Connecticut woman, enrolled in Goel's first
study about a year ago, in part because she was nursing her newborn
son and did not want to return to the antidepressants that had helped
her for several years.</TE>
<TE>   "The thing the light box did for me that the antidepressants
didn't was I found myself being super-energized," said Ellen, who
asked that her last name not be published. Subsequently, she tried
the high-density negative ions, which also controlled her depression.
But she preferred the light.</TE>
<TE>   After the study period, Ellen returned to the antidepressant
medication Zoloft; her insurance covers the drug but not the $200 to
$400 cost of a standard light box.</TE>
<TE>   Although some insurers do cover the treatment, Terman and Goel
said they hoped that their research, paid for by the National
Institutes of Mental Health, might convince more companies that
bright light therapy could be cost-effective. Light, they said, might
allow chronically depressed patients to take less medication, even if
it does not eliminate the need for drugs. In Europe, light and
antidepressive medications are already being used in tandem to treat
depressed patients in psychiatric hospitals, Terman said.</TE>
<TE>   How light affects mood remains something of a mystery, although
some clues are beginning to emerge. The best guess is that
something--perhaps a change in melatonin secretion--knocks the body's
biological clock out of whack, causing depression. Melatonin is a
hormone that regulates sleep and waking.</TE>
<TE>   "The notion is that when various circadian rhythms get out of sync
it causes the onset of depressive symptoms," Terman said. He is
investigating the promise of bright-light therapy in alleviating jet
lag for travelers. And with Dr. Neill Epperson, an assistant
professor of psychiatry and obstetrics and gynecology at the Yale
University School of Medicine in New Haven, Terman is testing bright
light in treating depression during pregnancy.</TE>

<LD>THE NEW LOVE AND SEX AFTER 60</LD>
<LD>   By Dr. Robert N. Butler and Myrna I. Lewis</LD>
<LD>   Ballantine Books</LD>
<TE>   380 pages, $14.95</TE>
<TE>   Publication date: Feb. 1, 2002</TE>
<TE>   This celebration of sexuality in the senior years updates a
landmark book by authors who have a host of credentials in dealing
with aging men and women.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Robert Butler, the founding director of the National Institute
on Aging, won a Pulitzer Prize in 1976 for his book "Why Survive?
Being Old in America." Psychotherapist Myrna Lewis, a fellow faculty
member at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York City, is an
expert on social and health issues for women of middle age and above.</TE>
<TE>   Much has changed since 1976, however, when their first book
tackled the sensitive subject of sex and seniors. Former Senate
Majority Leader Bob Dole has helped advertise Viagra, bringing
erectile dysfunction into prime-time television; actor Tony Randall
fathered a child well into his 70s; and AIDS has been diagnosed in
old and young alike. At the same time, the number of Americans older
than 60 has soared, and with them the expectation of sexual activity
well into their retirement years.</TE>
<TE>   The Butler and Lewis book has been updated accordingly, with
information on performance-enhancing medications and a host of
medical conditions that can affect sexuality, including menopause.
The authors explain normal aging in both men and women, suggesting
ways to address some of the more difficult obstacles an older couple
may encounter during lovemaking. The authors remind readers that
physical fitness has much to do with sexual fitness, so it's
important to exercise, even if you have physical limitations.</TE>
<TE>   Most important, they help readers see sexuality and sensuality as
important contributors to happiness and satisfaction at any time of
life.</TE>

<TE>   YOGA:</TE>
<TE>   The Poetry of the Body</TE>
<TE>   By Rodney Yee and Nina Zolotow</TE>
<TE>   Thomas Dunne Books/</TE>
<TE>   St. Martin's Griffin</TE>
<TE>   345 pages, $21.95</TE>
<TE>   Rodney Yee can do some amazing things. Just turn to pages 266 and
267 to see him in the "Easy Lord of the Fishes Pose." Easy? Not for a
beginner, but it shows what years of adhering to the disciplines of
yoga can do.</TE>
<TE>   Yee, the co-director of the Piedmont Yoga Studio in Oakland, and
Zolotow, one of his yoga students, have put together this
comprehensive book, which intersperses their conversations about the
practice of yoga with more than 400 detailed black-and-white photos.
In them, Yee and his wife, Donna Fone, demonstrate poses from the
simplest to those that torque the body in ways you may never think to
try.</TE>
<TE>   One of the best things about the book is that it covers many yoga
styles, which make it appropriate for people seeking different
rewards from the practice of yoga. As the authors say, everyone can
do yoga: "You can be male or female, young or old, flexible or stiff,
well or sick, healthy or injured."</TE>
<TE>   Those who primarily want to relax will find useful the
demonstrations in which cushiony bolsters are used to help maintain
certain positions, thereby releasing tension in particular parts of
the body. The more ambitious yoga enthusiast can use the book to
build a complete sequence of poses, including warmup moves, standing
poses, twists, back bends, seated poses, forward bends and
restorative poses.</TE>

<HD>SENIOR CARE / Hip Protectors Said to Reduce Risk of
Fracture</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Hip fractures are common among elderly men and women and can lead to
permanent disability, admission to a nursing home, even death. Only
about 25% to 30% of people who suffer a hip fracture make a full
recovery, according to a report in the January issue of the American
Journal of Nursing.</LD>
<LD>   But protection is available.</LD>
<LD>   Hip protectors, undergarments with padding to cushion fragile hip
bones in the event of a fall, have been shown to reduce the risk of a
fracture during a fall by as much as 84%. The garments, which cost
$30 to almost $200 and are widely available on the Internet, are
usually lightweight and thin enough to be worn under loose clothing.</LD>
<TE>   As lighter and more attractive styles of hip protectors hit the
market, more people at high risk of a fracture may consider wearing
the garments. Earlier studies have indicated that the hip protectors
take some getting used to and that long-term compliance may be a
problem if the garment is uncomfortable or unattractive.</TE>

<HD>INSOMNIA / It's Beach Versus Sheep in Sleeplessness Study</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Boredom may not be the best antidote for insomnia. Contrary to
popular belief, the monotony of counting sheep isn't as calming for
the chronically sleep deprived as thinking about sitting on a quiet
beach or next to a pristine waterfall, according to Oxford University
researchers.</LD>
<LD>   They theorized that imagining an appealing setting was a better
way of clearing the mind of the worries that keep people awake
because it was more interesting, and, they said, "it takes up more
brain space than the same dirty old sheep."</LD>
<LD>   To test this idea, 50 insomniacs were asked to either count sheep,
visualize a tranquil scene or use their own methods to fall asleep.
Recalling relaxing experiences won by a mile, with subjects nodding
off, on average, 20 minutes earlier than when they employed other
techniques. So forget sheep when you want to sleep--think beach.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Doctors often complain that they get paid for examinations, tests and
treatments, but not for time spent giving information to patients.
That could change if one organization has its way.</LD>
<LD>   Healthwise Inc., a nonprofit corporation that provides consumers
with medical information, has mounted a national campaign to have
health insurers reimburse doctors for referring their patients to
places where they can bone up on the particulars of their disease.
The concept has been dubbed "information therapy."</LD>
<LD>   Instead of writing a prescription, a doctor would write
instructions for where the patient could find details about
treatments or conditions, such as relevant Web sites. This would be
designated on a prescription pad with an Ix, instead of the
traditional Rx.</LD>
<TE>   Last week, Healthwise announced the opening of a Center for
Information Therapy in Washington, D.C., that will begin trying to
sell the nation on the idea that information is just as important as
medication.</TE>
<TE>   "Information therapy can be a powerful key for consumers to feel
more in control of their health," said John Rother, director of
policy and strategy for AARP, a national lobbying organization for
senior citizens. Rother is among 11 members of a new commission
advocating information therapy. He's joined by representatives of
major medical centers, health insurers, and groups that study quality
medical care.</TE>

<LD>Question: I want to put some weight (5 to 10 pounds) on my 5-foot-9
slender frame. I've been lifting weights for about six weeks but
haven't gained any size. In fact, I'm actually losing weight. Should
I add protein drinks to my diet?</LD>
<LD>   MARTY LAING</LD>
<LD>   Santa Monica</LD>
<TE>   Answer: Although you do need extra calories to gain weight,
guzzling two 300-calorie supplement drinks is roughly the caloric
equivalent of wolfing down a Big Mac--so don't make a habit of these
drinks.</TE>
<TE>   You need to gain muscle and weight slowly. If you gain more than 1
or 2 pounds a week, you increase the likelihood that the extra weight
will show up as fat, not muscle.</TE>
<TE>   Increase your intake by 500 to 1,000 calories per day with snacks
full of protein and vitamins, such as nuts, beans, low-fat dairy
products, lean turkey and fish.</TE>
<TE>   However, these extra calories won't automatically turn to muscle
either, so you'll need to continue to hit the weights. Also, keep in
mind that weight training increases your metabolism (muscle burns
more calories than fat), so be patient. It's also a good idea to work
with a certified personal trainer in your gym, because he or she can
assess your weight-training program and help tailor workouts to meet
your specific needs.</TE>

<HD>Close Monitoring of Blood Sugar Is Key to Managing Diabetes</HD>
<DH>Prevention: Even mild elevations in glucose level, if
persistent, multiply the risk of such complications as heart attack,
blindness, stroke and kidney failure.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JONATHAN FIELDING and VALERIE ULENE</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sugar often gets a bad rap, but there is one kind of sugar you can't
live without--glucose. It provides energy for every cell in your
body.</LD>
<LD>   Good health depends on having just the right level of it at all
times, and the level is regulated primarily by insulin, a hormone
secreted by the pancreas.</LD>
<LD>   People with diabetes are unable to control their sugar level,
however, either because their pancreas cannot make insulin or because
their body is "resistant" to it. Those who cannot make the hormone
must have daily injections of it. Those who are resistant to it may
be helped by dietary changes, exercise and weight loss. Prescription
drugs also can make the body more responsive to the natural insulin
that is present.</LD>
<TE>   The goal of diabetes treatment is to keep blood sugar within a
safe and healthy range 24 hours a day. Recent research has shown that
the desirable level is much lower than previously believed, because
even mild elevations of blood sugar--too slight to cause recognizable
symptoms--can damage organs throughout the body. If allowed to
persist over long periods of time, these mild blood sugar elevations
greatly increase the risk of catastrophic diabetes complications,
including heart attack, stroke, kidney failure and blindness.</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately, many people being treated for diabetes are unaware
that their blood sugar level is too high. Some are not receiving
adequately aggressive treatment; others are not adhering to the
treatment they were prescribed. Moreover, many diabetics are not
getting recommended medical services, such as screening tests that
could identify complications in the earliest stages.</TE>
<TE>   If you have diabetes, monitor your blood glucose level closely.
Test your blood according to the precise schedule prescribed by your
doctor or diabetes educator (the frequency and timing will vary
according to the severity of the disease and your individual needs
and treatment goals).</TE>
<TE>   Be aware that the standard glucose test measures the blood sugar
level only at the precise moment the test is performed; that
measurement may not be representative of your blood sugar level the
rest of the day. For example, if you do a test for glucose only in
the morning--when it is most likely to be at a desirable level--you
will have no way of knowing if it is dangerously elevated in the
afternoon or evening. Keep meticulous records of all your
measurements; they will help your doctor determine if your therapy
needs to be modified.</TE>
<TE>   Have your blood tested at regular intervals to measure hemoglobin
A1c (HgA1c) levels. This test (which must be ordered by your
physician and sent to a laboratory for analysis) reveals the average
amount of glucose present in the blood for the previous two to three
months and provides a good check on the adequacy of your glucose
self-tests. If your glucose is well controlled, the American Diabetes
Assn. recommends that hemoglobin A1c testing be performed at least
twice a year. More frequent testing is indicated, however, if your
glucose is poorly controlled or your therapy has recently changed.</TE>
<TE>   Even with aggressive treatment and blood sugar monitoring,
complications of diabetes can develop. To detect them early--when
they are more easily treated--have the following screenings:</TE>
<TE>   * A thorough examination of the feet at least once a year. Because
diabetes can impair circulation, foot ulcers are common. If the
ulcers are left untreated, they can cause gangrene, which can lead to
an amputation.</TE>
<TE>   * Annual eye examinations for signs of diabetes-related eye
disease (retinopathy). This complication results from damage to the
small blood vessels in the retina, the light-sensitive tissue at the
back of the eye. If such damage is detected, laser surgery can reduce
the risk of further visual loss. (Individuals who already have
retinopathy should be examined more often.)</TE>
<TE>   * A urine test for protein at least once a year. The kidneys are
at risk of being damaged by diabetes, possibly leading to kidney
failure--and either a lifetime of dialysis or a kidney transplant.
Medications can slow progression of the damage.</TE>
<TE>   * Finally, continuous monitoring of heart health. Because diabetes
greatly magnifies the danger of developing heart disease, people with
diabetes must identify and eliminate every risk possible. Blood
pressure should be measured at every routine diabetes visit, and
blood lipid levels should be measured regularly (every one to two
years depending on how high they are). High blood pressure and
elevated lipid levels should be treated vigorously, excess weight
should be lost, and smoking should be avoided completely.</TE>
<TE>   The American Diabetic Assn. recommends the use of aspirin in
people who have diabetes and evidence of existing cardiovascular
disease; this includes men and women who have already had a heart
attack or stroke, those who have atherosclerosis or peripheral artery
disease, and individuals who experience anginal chest pain. Aspirin
should also be considered for men and women believed to be at
increased risk of a heart attack because they smoke, have high blood
pressure or elevated cholesterol levels, are obese or have a family
history of coronary heart disease.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A Final Word  of Caution</TE>
<TE>   Diabetes impairs the ability of the immune system to function
properly, making diabetics more prone to certain types of infection
(and more likely to develop severe infections when they do occur).
For this reason, diabetics should be immunized against influenza
every year and be vaccinated at least once with the pneumococcal
vaccine. A one-time revaccination is recommended for individuals 65
and older who received the vaccine more than five years ago.</TE>

<LD>"If you are not yet a runner, [this book] will show you how to become
healthier and happier than you have ever imagined you could be. It
will do so no matter how out of shape or fat or old or ungraceful you
are, and no matter how many times you have tried other exercise
regimens and failed."</LD>
<LD>   So begins "The Complete Book of Running," the 314-page bestseller
by Jim Fixx that first appeared 25 years ago, kicking off a mass
movement of legs and arms that would later be described as a fitness
revolution.</LD>
<LD>   Tens of millions of Americans began running in the late 1970s, and
they soon felt lean and strong and more physically confident than
they could remember, just as the book promised. And though Fixx never
claimed that jogging was guaranteed to lengthen their lives, he
implied as much, writing that--with running--"the heart becomes a
distinctly more efficient instrument, capable of doing more while
working less hard."</LD>
<TE>   His very tone appalled many doctors. Whatever the benefits of
jogging, they argued, the repetitive pounding alone could damage the
spine, the uterus, the stomach; would, over time, ruin hips, ankles
and knees prematurely; and surely would cut short the lives of those
with weak hearts who pushed themselves too hard.</TE>
<TE>   As if to confirm their fears, on July 20, 1984, Fixx himself
collapsed and died of heart failure--while jogging. He was 52 and
seemingly in the best shape of his life.</TE>
<TE>   "Those who were naysayers at the time said, 'Look, Jim Fixx did
all that running, and it sure didn't do him any good,'" says Dr.
William Haskell, a professor of medicine at Stanford University
School of Medicine who studies the effect of exercise on health. "How
good could it be?"</TE>
<TE>   A quarter of a century after it all began, doctors now have some
good answers to that question--because millions of the men and women
who started running as young or middle-aged adults have never
stopped. These people have been running regularly for their entire
adult lives, and researchers have been watching to see what has
happened to their bodies and minds.</TE>
<TE>   Several clear health benefits have emerged, Haskell says: Compared
with sedentary people, habitual runners have an increased life
expectancy of two to seven years; a 30% to 40% lower risk of
developing heart disease; and only half the risk of developing Type 2
diabetes, he said. In some high-risk groups, a running regimen can
cut heart disease risk by more than half, as well.</TE>
<TE>   Researchers cannot pinpoint a precise level of running that
delivers optimal health benefits for everyone. But improvements in
strength, blood pressure and other measures of physical health
quickly show up in sedentary people who run just a half-hour (two to
five miles) a few times a week; and those benefits usually increase
with increased distance and speed up to 40 miles a week, and even
more for some people.</TE>
<TE>   The living evidence may be found in almost any of the country's
long-running track clubs. One of the oldest in California is a Palos
Verdes Peninsula-area group that formed in 1967 and now includes 50
people, most of them retirement-age, with more than two decades of
running behind them. The group meets every Sunday morning for a one-
to two-hour run, followed by breakfast.</TE>
<TE>   "We've become old men together," says Dr. Tom Bassler, a
69-year-old retired pathologist and one of the founders, "but I tell
you, we don't live like old men. Many of our members are in their 70s
or 80s; these guys are still working, running, goofing around,
building stuff. One just wrote a book."</TE>
<TE>   Flavio Bisignano, 74, a restaurant owner, has been putting in at
least seven miles almost every day since the Nixon administration,
including the regular Sunday breakfast runs. "I have diabetes in my
family on both sides, and yet I have had no problems, and I have to
believe that's because of the running," he says. "I truly believe
that without running I would be dead by now."</TE>
<TE>   Like many such long-standing clubs across the country, the Palos
Verdes group has an extraordinary health record. In more than 30
years, Bassler says, just three members have died: one of a brain
tumor, another in a plane crash, the third in a carjacking. There
have been no heart attacks; no strokes; no heart trouble at all, he
says.</TE>
<TE>   Many solo runners who have stayed active report a similar
experience. Roberta Gibb of San Diego was the first woman to finish
the Boston Marathon. That was in 1966; she was 23. "I can tell you
this: I have never stopped running, and my doctor says I've got the
physiology of a 30-year-old," she says. "People look at me and think
I'm in my 30s and 40s. My joints are limber, and I've really had no
running injuries at all."</TE>
<TE>   Dealing With Concerns About Injuries, Arthritis</TE>
<TE>   Through the years, and even after Fixx died, more and more doctors
began to see jogging as a powerful guard against heart disease, even
in people who had survived heart attacks. But there were lingering
doubts about the pavement-pounding--the continuous rattling of bones
and joints could not be healthy.</TE>
<TE>   "You heard it all the time: 'Today's runners will be tomorrow's
total knee replacements,'" says Dr. James Fries, a Stanford
University School of Medicine rheumatologist who has studied longtime
runners.</TE>
<TE>   It makes sense. After all, serious joggers do turn their ankles,
twist their knees and injure their legs--more so than non-runners,
doctors agree. "We have an orthopedic surgeon who runs with us, and
every morning there are four or five guys lined up to talk to him,
complaining about shins, knees, feet, you name it," says Bob
Trujillo, 70, a restaurant owner and another member of the running
group.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. John Pagliano, a podiatrist and running club member, has been
charting injuries for more than two decades, in thousands of runners,
and has compiled a chart of the most common ones: plantar fasciitis,
a common cause of heel pain, which strikes 16% of regular runners;
shin splints, affecting 9%; and sore knees, which plague almost 7%.
Knee problems are most likely to lead to serious arthritis.</TE>
<TE>   "The risk factors for getting arthritis are your age, your weight,
the pace at which you run--and previous injury," says Dr. Nancy Lane,
a rheumatologist at UC San Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   Yet here again, many lifelong runners have come through unscathed.
Dr. Paul Straub, 69, a cosmetic surgeon and Sunday morning club
member, has been running for 30 years. "I've had two serious knee
injuries, and the longest kept me out nine months. But then I just
worked my way back into the runs. I know of no one in our Sunday
morning club who has stopped because of arthritis. Our group is
immensely better off because of what we've been doing," he says.</TE>
<TE>   In part, this is a matter of self-selection: Over time, men and
women whose joints hurt too much eventually just quit the sport. And
those who keep going "tend to be skinny, light-boned, motivated,
educated people who are aware of how much they can push their
bodies," says Dr. Jonathan Chang, an orthopedic surgeon who teaches
at USC and is a former competitive runner .</TE>
<TE>   Bisignano, for example, now does what he calls the "Italian
shuffle," which is much slower than the stride he used when
competing.</TE>
<TE>   Many doctors now believe that this kind of running--steady, but
careful, on normal joints--may actually protect many people from
developing arthritis. "I call this the use-it-or-lose-it phenomenon,"
Chang says. "It's exactly opposite of what was postulated years ago.
In study after study we see that those chronic runners who are not
trying to run through injuries, and who take care of themselves, are
protected against arthritis."</TE>
<TE>   Like any weight-bearing exercise, too, regular jogging slows the
age-related loss of bone mineral density, a marker for osteoporosis,
several studies have shown. This doesn't mean running builds bone,
doctors say; only that it seems to delay the fractures that occur in
aging bones. "Instead of fracture occurring at, say, age 70, it might
occur at age 90," Haskell says.</TE>
<TE>   The bottom line, says Fries: For those who are able to keep it up,
jogging can delay significant disability for more than 10 years. "In
everything from grip strength to walking to getting up from a chair,"
elderly lifelong runners score higher than sedentary people, he says.</TE>
<TE>   None of which is to say that grunting and huffing for an hour or
so a day is entirely without risk. Like Fixx, people do still
dropdead while jogging (though doctors say it's very rare). And just
about every compulsive runner out there says there's an even greater
danger--overdoing it.</TE>
<TE>   "When you start routinely running, say, 40 miles a week or more,
and you cannot, ever, miss a run," says Tim Church, a researcher at
the Cooper Institute for Aerobics Research, in Dallas, "that's where
I start to make a distinction between a normal runner and a
pathological runner." When pushed this hard, over long periods, the
body simply doesn't have time to repair itself, and the result is
often chronic fatigue and nagging joint pain.</TE>
<TE>   Easing Moderate Anxiety, Stress</TE>
<TE>   But for the great majority of lifers, running has provided a daily
dose of sanity. "When it comes to severe depression and other mental
illness, exercise is not going to help you; it's not going to butter
the biscuit," says Thomas Plante, a psychologist at Santa Clara
University. "But we know that moving your body for even a half-hour a
day significantly eases moderate anxiety, depression and stress."</TE>
<TE>   In ongoing studies, Plante says he's finding that the sensations
of mental well-being from jogging in fact have little to do with how
hard or fast people go, or their level of physical fitness. "It's
belief," he says. "When people believe strongly that what they're
doing is extremely good for them, then in effect it becomes true." He
says the effect is analogous to the mental health benefits that
researchers have observed in people with strong religious beliefs.</TE>
<TE>   "The Sunday runs, I tell my wife, are better than going to
church," Trujillo says.</TE>
<TE>   Says Gibb, a solo runner: "When you're healthy, just moving and
breathing is pleasurable. It's so primal--humans have been running
forever. The rhythm, the breathing hard, moving your shoulders, the
sense of self of your body, moving along the Earth: I think we
sometimes forget, we are physical animals."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Pluses and Minuses</TE>
<TE>   Studies have shown that, compared to inactive people, regular
runners have increased life expectancy and a lower risk of developing
heart disease and Type 2 diabetes.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, there is a downside. Runners appear to be more prone to
leg and knee injuries, including plantar fasciitis (heel pain), shin
splints and sore knees.</TE>

<HD>50 Years at the Keyboard--Many of Them Dog Years</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU>AL MARTINEZ</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I'm beginning my 50th year in newspapering, and the very idea amazes
me. I never thought I'd be able to do any one thing for half a
century, but here I am, still pecking away in a field of words like a
chicken at chow time, as hungry as ever.</LD>
<LD>   I tell you this even though it violates an unspoken rule in the
City of Angles never to even hint at how old you might be. When I
told a friend what I intended, he replied in a shocked tone, "You're
coming out of the closet?"</LD>
<LD>   "I'm revealing my age," I said, "not changing my gender."</LD>
<TE>   "But do you think that's wise?"</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not sure that wisdom has anything to do with it," I said,
"but I'm doing it."</TE>
<TE>   His attitude defines an element of our culture that celebrates the
young and dismisses those who manage to crawl past 60. We are
endlessly amazed when a grandfather climbs a mountain or a
grandmother wins a race, as though the title automatically implies a
limited capacity.</TE>
<TE>   That attitude was shaped in Hollywood, where growing old continues
to threaten an actor's status and ego. Those who make their living
being young and sexual cling to youth like a kitten to a tree. Face
lifts, butt tucks and breast enhancements only temporarily delay the
inevitable. Soon, too soon, time overcomes the adornments, and those
who once starred drop into the category of those who used to be.</TE>
<TE>   I've never really thought much about time, but it's the nature of
our culture that we celebrate milestones. I suppose that 50 years of
sitting on a curb and watching the passing parade qualifies. Nothing
has changed much.</TE>
<TE>   During that half-century we've gone from "Ozzie and Harriet" to
"Sex and the City," but the subtext of the human condition remains
pretty much the same. The world is just as screwed up today as it was
back then.</TE>
<TE>   We're still killing one another on fields of combat. Disease and
starvation remain the twin evils on a planet with both too much and
too little. The gap between haves and have-nots widens. The rich of
Enron walk away richer, and the poor struggle in despair.</TE>
<TE>   And I keep writing about the family dog.</TE>
<TE>   That's a metaphor I use to explain the family columns I write
occasionally. I do them to view an often surreal world from the
perspective of who we are out here in the 'burbs. Nothing is more
real than a dog.</TE>
<TE>   I began doing this in the 1960s when I first started writing a
column. It appeared six days a week on the Op-Ed page of the Oakland
Tribune. The '60s were a time of turmoil. Anti-Vietnam War protests,
freedom marches, bra burnings, draft-card burnings, sit-ins,
love-ins, smoke-ins, sing-ins, acid trips and a lot of other
"happenings" that I can't remember. Everyone was bumping into
everyone else doing their own things.</TE>
<TE>   I realized at some point that we were all going a little crazy
reading about it and writing about it, so I introduced the family dog
to relieve the intensity. As a rule, editors don't like dog columns.
I had one editor in Oakland suggest that I ought to kill the dog,
write a dead-dog column and get back to exploring issues. In L.A.,
the highest compliment an editor ever gave me was that he had become
accustomed to my dog columns. Then he got canned.</TE>
<TE>   Ike was president when I got my first newspaper job. The Korean
War was still going on, but I was out of it after 18 months in
combat. The Vietnam War was to come.</TE>
<TE>   The now-defunct Richmond Independent was a small daily north of
Oakland. Chick Richards was editor. He drank two double shots of
Rocky Mountain rye every day, one in the morning and one in
midafternoon. He fired people before his first shot in the morning
and hired them back in the afternoon, during his mellow period.</TE>
<TE>   When someone asked my advice about getting into journalism, I
said, "Never work for an editor named Chick."</TE>
<TE>   My first byline was on a story about a guy who'd built a flying
saucer out of sheet metal and was trying to figure out a way to power
it. He was talking about utilizing "internal human energy" to get it
into orbit, but refused to go into detail.</TE>
<TE>   When I asked, "Is this stomach gas you're talking about?" he went
into a rage and threw me out. I've been thrown out of a lot of places
since then. The Red Cross threw me off a chartered bus once when I
questioned their efficiency. A city council committee threw me out of
a meeting when they discovered I wasn't there to serve drinks.</TE>
<TE>   A French writer, Alphonse Karr, observed that the more things
change, the more they remain the same. True.</TE>
<TE>   "We will bury you!" Nikita Khrushchev was saying back then. Now,
Osama bin Laden is saying pretty much the same thing. In all the
years I've been writing, annihilation has been just around the
corner. It still is. Weapons have changed, but attitudes haven't. We
keep bombing, they keep coming.</TE>
<TE>   Fifty years. The wonder is that after all that time chasing the
news and hunting a muse, I can still tie my own shoes and find my way
home. Writing continues to invigorate me. So does the family dog.
Point me to the computer and watch me hobble to the keyboard. It's
amazing what a grandfather can do when a grandfather sets out to do
it.</TE>

<LD>Advice to men hoping to woo women: Toss your musky colognes and Irish
Spring soap. You'll probably have a better shot with your own
unadorned male scent. In what hints at a female equivalent of the
Oedipal complex, a groundbreaking University of Chicago study found
that women prefer the scent of a man who smells like dear old Dad.</LD>
<LD>   The study, to be published in the February issue of the journal
Nature Genetics, is the first time scientists have demonstrated that
human beings' odor preferences are based upon a set of genes
inherited from their fathers. The researchers found evidence that
women prefer the odor of men to whom they are genetically similar,
but not identical, to the odor of men whose genes are nearly
identical or wholly unfamiliar.</LD>
<LD>   "It's the clearest example that preferences for body odors are
genetically determined," said Gary Beauchamp, director of  Monell
Chemical Senses Center in Philadelphia, who was not involved in the
study.</LD>
<TE>   Although they are not conscious of it, "Women can actually smell
genetic differences," said psychologist Martha K. McClintock, a
coauthor of the study with lead investigator Suma Jacob, then a
University of Chicago postdoctoral fellow in biopsychology and now a
psychiatric resident in training at the UCLA Neuropsychiatric
Institute, and Carole Ober, a University of Chicago professor of
human genetics. "It may be that this odor preference really functions
in terms of recognizing family members on the father's side or in
selecting friends. We have no evidence that this has anything to do
with sex. We can speculate that the preference could be a way to
avoid mating with an individual with whom you have nothing
[genetically] in common."</TE>
<TE>   Extremes in "outbreeding," a term that refers to mating with
someone who has completely dissimilar genes, and inbreeding can be
equally dangerous, said McClintock. Animal studies have shown that
outbreeding can result in miscarriages, and researchers assume the
same is true for humans. Inbreeding, or having children with a
relative or someone who has genes that are too similar, increases
risk of miscarriage or of passing on recessive genetic disorders.</TE>
<TE>   In 1997, Ober and colleagues studied the marriages in a Hutterite
community in South Dakota, descendants of Russian immigrants to the
western United States in the 1870s. Ober found that there were fewer
close genetic matches between husbands and wives than might be
presumed in an isolated, homogeneous population. Somehow the
Hutterites avoided choosing spouses who were genetically too similar
to themselves.</TE>
<TE>   In selecting a mate, said McClintock, a leading expert on
pheromones and human chemical signals, humans do well to stay within
their own genetic ballpark.</TE>
<TE>   "If you are an adult, you have survived long enough to know that
your own genes are a successful combination," she said, adding that
this may explain why people unconsciously choose mates who are
genetically similar.</TE>
<TE>   To conduct the study, the researchers determined the human
leukocyte antigen (or HLA) gene sequence--the inherited basis for
personal odors and olfactory preferences--of 49 female study
participants, their biological parents and six men who were selected
because of their HLA types and diverse ethnicity.</TE>
<TE>   The researchers then asked the women to sniff and rate household
fragrances such as bleach, cloves, cotton and cardboard along with
the T-shirts worn for two consecutive nights by each of the six men,
who slept alone and used fragrance-free soap. The women were asked to
sniff 10 scents, then rated each odor for familiarity, intensity,
pleasantness and spiciness. They were asked to select which smell
they would choose if they "had to smell it all the time."</TE>
<TE>   Researchers then compared the HLA sequences of the women to the
men whose odoriferous T-shirt they preferred. The women chose the
scents of men with genes similar to their own, but not those of men
with nearly identical genes or genes totally dissimilar to their own.
By looking at the genes of each woman's parents (each person inherits
one set of genes from the father and one set from the mother),
McClintock said the researchers were able to tell that each woman's
choice was based upon HLA genes inherited from her father but not her
mother.</TE>
<TE>   But why would the genetic basis for odor preference be inherited
paternally?</TE>
<TE>   It could be, speculated McClintock, that the maternal HLA has
another function: the implantation and maintenance of pregnancy.
"Ober's research showed that if a husband and wife share too many of
these genes in common, then the mom's immune system doesn't recognize
the ball of cells as a potential fetus, but sees it as uterine
epithelial cells and gets rid of them," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Jacob hypothesized that odor preference may be inherited
paternally as a means for primates and other mammals, whose fathers
sire offspring with multiple females, to recognize paternal siblings
and avoid inbreeding. "Among primates and other species, paternity is
not always known," said Jacob, who cited a University of Chicago
study of yellow baboons in which researchers discovered that female
baboons groom and aid their paternal sisters when they meet up.</TE>
<TE>   Other biologists have found that, through smell, mice avoid mating
with mice whose genes match their own too closely.</TE>
<TE>   The researchers are hesitant to say what influence, if any, a
woman's preference for eau de Dad may have when it comes to love,
romance and marriage.</TE>
<TE>   "Smell will have a subtle influence in the way we select mates but
mate selection is much more complicated," said Jacob. "Someone's
scent may be part of it, but there are visual things, what a person
sounds like and other things. Odor won't have the influence it does
with rodents and other mammals where they are driven by it."</TE>
<TE>   So while it's possible that a woman will be drawn to a man for his
tight abs, sexy smile and fat wallet, when it comes to how he smells,
it appears to be her genes calling the shots.</TE>

<LD>SHOUTING FIRE</LD>
<LD>   Civil Liberties</LD>
<LD>   in a Turbulent Age</LD>
<TE>   By Alan M. Dershowitz</TE>
<TE>   Little, Brown</TE>
<TE>   550 pages; $26.95</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   It's no accident that the same word, "right," can refer to an
entitlement of the kind enumerated in the Bill of Rights yet also to
the moral idea of rectitude, as in the admonition, "Do the right
thing." The first is a specific legal protection: a freedom or a
privilege. The second is based on a far more general concept of
morality and may involve the notion of duty.</TE>
<TE>   Among the most active and outspoken champions of individual rights
and civil liberties is Alan M. Dershowitz, Harvard professor,
practicing appellate lawyer, noted media pundit and prolific author.
Depending on one's point of view on each of the many issues on which
Dershowitz has pronounced his opinion, he can be brilliantly
perspicacious or maddeningly wrongheaded.</TE>
<TE>   The 54 essays in "Shouting Fire" address a vast range of issues,
major and minor, from pornography, abortion and the death penalty to
organ donation, police sting operations and the Senate confirmation
process for judges. Whether you agree with his positions,
Dershowitz's keenly analytical mind and lucid direct prose style help
clarify the nature of the subjects under discussion. Sometimes, he
can even be surprising.</TE>
<TE>   Despite his long-standing commitment to civil liberties and his
prominent role in defending unpopular or controversial clients such
as Claus von Bulow, O.J. Simpson and Mike Tyson, Dershowitz is not
always a knee-jerk opponent of law and order. As the essays in this
collection testify, he has given some serious thought to the
important legal, constitutional, ethical and social questions raised
by the continuing and inevitable conflict between the rights of the
individual and the rights of the majority. In assessing the merits of
these two claims, both essential to a democratic society, he comes
down certainly more often on the side of the former, but also
sometimes on the side of the latter.</TE>
<TE>   Two chapters, written in the wake of the terrorist attacks of
Sept. 11, urge the need for compromise rather than confrontation
between government officials and civil libertarians: "[I]f we work
together--if civil libertarians are brought into the tent in advance,
rather than playing out their traditional role of criticizing from
outside the tent only afterward--the beneficiaries will be all
Americans who rightly demand both safety and freedom." Dershowitz
disagrees with the absolutist approach of some civil libertarians who
view every security measure as a heinous assault on liberty. He
believes that some of the more sophisticated security measures will
not only be less intrusive but also more effective in zeroing in on
the real terrorists. In an earlier chapter, Dershowitz examines the
way that Israel has handled the problem of preventive detention.</TE>
<TE>   Although the level of criticism directed against Israel might lead
one to suppose that "no nation had ever taken away more liberties
with less justification," Dershowitz's investigation of the situation
there led him to the opposite conclusion: "that although Israel has
suspended some important liberties during recent crises, it has
retained far more than any other country faced with comparable
dangers." Indeed, comparing Israel's preventive detention policy with
that practiced against Japanese Americans during World War II,
Dershowitz finds that Israel's far less sweeping policy is much
closer to what liberal critics of Roosevelt's had proposed instead of
the wholesale uprooting and internment of an entire ethnic group.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   As a liberal who holds many views that can certainly be classified
as "politically correct," Dershowitz is nonetheless disturbed by the
phenomenon of "political correctness" on campuses: "I am appalled at
the intolerance of many who share my substantive views," he declares.
"How many politically correct students are demanding--in the name of
diversity--an increase in the number of evangelical Christians,
National Rifle Association members and right-to-life advocates?...
Let's be honest: the demand for diversity is at least in part a cover
for a political power grab by the left.... It has certainly given the
political right--not known for its great tolerance of different
ideas--a heyday." Dershowitz finds an even more "insidious" kind of
political correctness, however, in the fact that fewer and fewer
people in American public life today "are prepared to disclose that
they are atheists, agnostics, skeptics, or humanists." Urging
"closeted" disbelievers to come out of the closet, Dershowitz not
only invokes the constitutional rights to freedom of religion,
thought and speech, but also reminds us that being a skeptic or a
nonbeliever does not mean that one is immoral any more than religious
belief is always a guarantee of morality.</TE>
<TE>   Dershowitz understands that law ought to be based on morals: A
successful legal system cannot depend merely on coercion, he notes,
but on people's sense that in obeying just laws, they are doing the
right thing.</TE>
<TE>   Yet he is reluctant to base his idea of morality either on divine
or natural law. Some of the most thought-provoking chapters in the
book concern these basic philosophical questions. Are human rights
grounded in divine law, natural law or any kind of higher authority,
or are they merely whatever a given legal system has encoded?
Although Dershowitz is skeptical of those who would base rights on
religion or nature, he also regards the "legal positivist" approach
as unsatisfying and tautological: If rights are merely what the law
says they are, there would be no grounds for criticizing Nazi
Germany's human rights record.</TE>
<TE>   Dershowitz calls his approach "experiential." Throughout history,
people's experience of injustice helps them form an idea of what
their rights should be. Or, as Dershowitz puts it, "Rights come from
wrongs." Here again, one may criticize him for being too quick to
dismiss religion and nature (the former may help rein in the excesses
of the latter; the latter may be "red in tooth and claw," but even
tigers and sharks don't kill for kicks, let alone commit genocide!).
It is also a strange omission that Dershowitz does not discuss the
United Nations' Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Still, this is
a stimulating, crisply written, cogently argued book that will
contribute a great deal to the ongoing discussion of these vital
matters.</TE>

<DL>POINT OF ROCKS, Md</DL>
<LD>Suzannah Skalsky's eyelids are dusted with
glitter, and her hairdo is sprayed firmly in place. The cowgirl-style
fringe on her hot-pink shirt matches the trim around the neck of her
dance partner, who sits patiently beside her while 13-year-old
Suzannah nervously waits for the judges to call them to the floor.</LD>
<LD>   Suzannah rolls her eyes as her mother snaps yet another picture.
The accomplished pair have traveled from Troy, Mich., for this
competition, and their moment is drawing near. But when they're
finally on the dance floor, nothing goes as planned. Suzannah's
partner, Missy, is distracted. She stops for a scratch, then looks
around the room with casual interest. She can't seem to focus on the
routine. But then, terriers aren't particularly known for their dance
skills.</LD>
<LD>   Missy is a terrier mix rescued from the dog pound. On this day in
late November, she is acting as if she could be anywhere, anywhere
except the North American Nationals competition of the World Canine
Freestyle Organization.</LD>
<TE>   Sympathetic applause from the audience distracts her even further.
By the time the twangy country music stops and Missy is ordered back
to her crate, Suzannah is in tears. This is the high-stakes world of
competitive dog dancing, and it will break your heart.</TE>
<TE>   A little bit "Flashdance," a little bit "Best in Show," dog
dancing is a sport in its infancy. But Patie Ventre, founder of the
organization, has big dreams. "I'd like to see it in the Olympics in
10 years," said Ventre, a petite, chain-smoking former figure skater
from Brooklyn who is the sport's most avid promoter.</TE>
<TE>   Canine freestyle has its roots in dog obedience competitions and
demonstrations, in which routines were sometimes performed to music.
Dog dancing split off on its own in the late 1980s in Canada, Great
Britain and the United States.</TE>
<TE>   Today there are two competing nonprofit organizations in the U.S:
the World Canine Freestyle Organization, which Ventre founded in
1999, and the Canine Freestyle Federation, an organization founded in
1995 that is based in Fairfax, Va. Ventre estimates there are about
800 competitors worldwide.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes in life you're very lucky that all the things you
cherish come together in one thing. That's what happened to me with
canine freestyle," Ventre said.</TE>
<TE>   A former advertising executive, she was the publicity director for
dog obedience and agility competitions that were sponsored by Quaker
Oats. Dancing dogs started as a publicity ploy and grew into a
passion, Ventre said.</TE>
<TE>   But when Quaker Oats sold its pet food line to Heinz, the company
pulled the plug on her funding and she struck out on her own. Now she
has her own dog, Dancer, and the two are fierce competitors. They
took first prize at the nationals in Maryland late last year.</TE>
<TE>   There are trophies for first-place winners and ribbons for second-
and third-place teams. For each event, special awards also go to the
competitors with the highest artistic score and the highest technical
score.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   At the nationals, the 60 routines ranged from a football-themed
rock 'n' roll number--which had a golden retriever named Ashley doing
push-ups along with her partner--to a provocative dance set to "The
Stripper," music more commonly heard at bachelor parties than kennel
clubs.</TE>
<TE>   For the latter performance, Cindy Pfister of Altoona, Pa., wore a
shimmering blue bodysuit and shared a white feather boa with her
miniature pinscher, Sammie. When the routine was finished, Pfister
downed a sports drink, and Sammie took a nap.</TE>
<TE>   California is behind the curve when it comes to dog dancing.
Only a few obedience schools around the state have classes, and there's
only one in Southern California. The first competition in the state
is scheduled for August, when the World Canine Freestyle Organization
plans to hold the "I Left My Paws in San Francisco" event in the Bay
Area.</TE>
<TE>   But enthusiasts insist that dog dancing is for the masses. Unlike
the hoity-toity world of dog shows, which require pedigrees and
follow rigid protocols, anybody with a groove going can ask a dog to
dance.</TE>
<TE>   Contests are open to any breed and any age dog. People and their
pooches just get out there and dance to the music, competing against
others at similar skill levels. Points are given for keeping time to
the music, for maintaining no more than a few feet of distance from a
partner, for intricacy of moves and the level of attention, animation
and attitude displayed by both humans and canines.</TE>
<TE>   The biggest hurdle to dog dancing, suggest many who have tried it,
lies in finding music your dog will respond to.</TE>
<TE>   "If I put on a song she doesn't like, she just barks," said
Theresa Zuzworsky of Germantown, Md., whose glossy 8-year-old Irish
setter, Caitlin, finally found a composition to suit her in Bette
Midler's rendition of "Everything's Coming Up Roses."</TE>
<TE>   For spectators, the hardest part can be discerning between a dog
that is dancing and a dog that is just freaking out because his
master is jumping around in a tutu. Some common moves, depending on
the size of the dog, can include the dog weaving in and out of its
partner's legs, running backward and jumping into its partner's arms
on cue. The human half of the team tends to be more involved in
costumes, although dogs are also permitted to wear flashy collars or
other unobtrusive accessories to set the proper mood.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Southern California has been exposed to dog dancing in fits and
starts: just a demonstration now and then at a dog show or a kennel
club, according to Sue Nelson, who teaches dog dancing classes at
Jump Start Dog Sports obedience school in Yorba Linda.</TE>
<TE>   "Most of the people that sign up for these classes are people who
want to do things with their dogs, but they don't want the
competition," Nelson said. "It's strictly for fun, and the dogs love
it."</TE>
<TE>   That's just what Beverly Blanchard thought the first time she
tried it. Now she's an avid competitor. "Most of us get into it the
same way," she said of the pastime that has captured her heart. "They
swear they're never going to get up in front of a bunch of people and
dance with their dogs. It sounds crazy. Then you see it and maybe you
get a little teary-eyed, so you try it, and your dog enjoys it so
much."</TE>
<TE>   Blanchard's dog, Sonic, a border terrier, became the youngest dog
to win a title at just 10 months old. Blanchard was delighted with
Sonic's progress, but she felt her own performances left something to
be desired.</TE>
<TE>   "I started taking dance classes because I felt I had to catch up
to the quality of my dog," said Blanchard, who lives in Clarkston,
Mich., and works professionally with a group that trains guide dogs
for the blind and deaf.</TE>
<TE>   She and Sonic, who will be 2 in February, are working on two new
routines. It's a challenging time for both, as Sonic has begun the
transition to a new level of competition: performing without a leash.</TE>
<TE>   "Now I feel that we're much more of a pair, and we're getting much
closer to what I think dancing with your dog should look like,"
Blanchard said.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>On May 27, 1936, the elegant Queen Mary sailed from Southampton,
England, on its maiden voyage to America. Designed by John Brown &amp;
Co. in Clydebank, Scotland, it was one of the most luxurious ocean
liners of its time. Many of the world's richest and most famous
people sailed on the grand ship. But the beginning of World War II
set the course for a different type of duty.</LD>
<LD>   Overnight, the Queen Mary was transformed into a troopship and
nicknamed the Grey Ghost. The ship's exterior was painted gray, and
the craft dutifully served from 1940 through 1946, transporting
soldiers and prisoners of war. The ship later brought war brides and
their children to new homes and lives in the U.S. and Canada. By the
end of the war, the Queen Mary had carried more than 800,000 troops,
traveled more than 600,000 miles and played a significant role in
many major military battles. The Queen Mary even set a record for the
most passengers carried in one crossing--more than 16,000 troops and
crew. That record still stands today.</LD>
<LD>   In 1967, the Queen Mary sailed from Southampton to a new permanent
home in Long Beach. It would be the ship's last crossing. The vessel
is the largest ship in Long Beach Harbor. The Queen Mary is
recognized as a historic hotel, a floating museum and is listed in
the National Register of Historic Places.</LD>

things, including an outcast star! Soon Nita travels to a dark realm
to save Earth. What magic will the new wizard encounter on her
page-turning journey?</LD>

<HD>Graying Radicals Are Facing New Ire in America</HD>
<DH>Recent arrests in the 27-year-old SLA robbery are raising
concerns for other ex-activists.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN JOHNSON and GEOFFREY MOHAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Their hair is thinner and their girth broader. Their lifestyles tend
more to the minivan and gardening than to any utopian fantasies
favoring the overthrow of what they used to call Amerika.</LD>
<LD>   Oh, and there's one more thing the graying lions of the radical
left share in the aftermath of Sept. 11 and the arrests of four
former members of the bumbling, trigger-happy Symbionese Liberation
Army: a growing disquiet that it could be open season on
countercultural figures of the Vietnam era, whether they were
involved in serious crimes or not.</LD>
<LD>   The long-buried divisions that tore at society 30 years ago, they
fear, are resurfacing. "At what point do they say, 'We better start
rounding up the old activists?'" worried John Buttny, 63, a onetime
member of the Weathermen organization, who now lives outside Santa
Barbara and works for a member of that county's Board of Supervisors.</LD>
<TE>   Since the terror attacks, Buttny's old FBI file has been
circulated by political enemies to the local media. "I have often
remarked to friends that the '60s were nowhere near this repressive,"
said Buttny. He now recalls almost fondly how, as a young radical in
Boulder, Colo., he used to joke with FBI agents when they came to buy
his left-wing literature.</TE>
<TE>   Karl Armstrong, who spent eight years behind bars for blowing up a
U.S. Army research building in 1970 at the University of Wisconsin,
killing a researcher, is now facing a boycott of his sandwich shop,
Radical Rye, in Madison. "I thought it was unfair," he said of the
boycott called by a conservative radio talk-show host. "But I figure
it's all just part of the karma."</TE>
<TE>   And then there's Weathermen stalwart Bill Ayers, who admits in his
new book, "Fugitive Days," to playing a role in blowing up a restroom
at the Pentagon in 1972. Ayers, who is married to former radical
Bernardine Dohrn, canceled his book tour after Sept. 11 and issued a
statement defending the work as "a condemnation of terrorism in all
its forms."</TE>
<TE>   "It would be preposterous," said Ayers, an education professor at
the University of Illinois at Chicago, "to use [the book] now to
suggest that any of the Vietnam-era protesters would endorse acts of
terrorism such as those we witnessed."</TE>
<TE>   Dohrn, once dubbed by J. Edgar Hoover "la pasionara of the lunatic
left," has been the focus of a protest by alumni at Northwestern
University, where she teaches law. Some have threatened to withhold
financial support if she isn't removed. Law school dean David Van
Zandt has so far stood behind her, saying she has expressed an
"abhorrence for violence."</TE>
<TE>   Some of the old radicals say they can't understand the arrest of
the SLA members last week, all these years later, unless there is a
political agenda attached.</TE>
<TE>   "I assume [authorities] didn't prosecute before because they
didn't have a case," said Marshall Berzon, once part of a Weathermen
collective in Boston that was arrested en masse and accused of
shooting up the Cambridge, Mass., police station three decades ago.
"There is a significant segment of the population today that lumps
people like William and Emily Harris in with John Walker [Lindh] and
Osama bin Laden."</TE>
<TE>   Fellow activist Mark Rudd, accused by the FBI of leading the riots
at Columbia University in 1968 and who spent seven years underground,
said he is confused by the SLA arrests these many years later. "They
were living openly, right?" said Rudd, who now teaches at a community
college in New Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors say there is nothing suspicious about the arrests now.
They say the investigation of Sara Jane Olson in connection with a
plot to blow up Los Angeles police cars provided new evidence on the
1975 Carmichael bank robbery.</TE>
<TE>   However it came about, Rudd is right. William and Emily Harris
were not hiding in some bunker or donning sunglasses when they went
to the market. Hoping their radical pasts had receded in the cultural
rearview mirror, along with the mod shirt and white man's Afro that
William Harris once sported, they had settled into numbingly normal
lives.</TE>
<TE>   Emily Harris, now known as Emily Montague, lived on a quiet street
in Altadena and worked as a computer analyst. Her former husband has
worked as a private detective in San Francisco and at times as an
investigator for the district attorney's office. He was driving his
two sons to school when he was arrested for a robbery that netted
$15,000 and took the life of Myrna Opsahl, who had been depositing
church receipts during the 1975 robbery.</TE>
<TE>   Fellow defendant Michael Bortin has owned a hardwood flooring
business in Portland, Ore., for 20 years. His sister-in-law, Olson,
married a doctor and lived as a Midwestern housewife while on the lam
for more than two decades. Olson, who was sentenced Jan. 18 to 20
years to life for her role in the police car bomb plot, will also
face murder charges in connection with Opsahl's death.</TE>
<TE>   Even though Patricia Hearst wrote a book implicating the four
defendants in the robbery, three Sacramento County district attorneys
felt there was not enough evidence to file charges. But after Sept.
11, some say, things changed.</TE>
<TE>   "The difference is being attacked in your own country changes
everything," said Buttny, a founder of the Students for a Democratic
Society chapter in Boulder. "I feel absolutely helpless," he said.
"There is a huge fishing expedition going on."</TE>
<TE>   Buttny attended the 1969 Flint, Mich., "War Council" that led
members of the Weathermen group to go into hiding. They later
resurfaced as the bomb-making Weather Underground. Buttny said he
dropped out of radical politics after being arrested 15 times during
demonstrations. The next arrest, he felt, would bring a long prison
sentence.</TE>
<TE>   "One of our slogans," he said, "was to bring the war home. By that
we meant agitating to stop the Vietnam War. As soon as I saw [the
attacks on the World Trade Center] that phrase popped into my mind."</TE>
<TE>   If Osama bin Laden brought war to America, Buttny thinks he is
suffering the collateral damage. He is a deputy to Santa Barbara
County Supervisor Gail Marshall, who is now embroiled in a recall
movement launched by people questioning her--and
Buttny's--patriotism. Critics accuse her of opposing a salute to the
flag at a community meeting, which she denies.</TE>
<TE>   As the war of words escalated in Santa Barbara County, Buttny's
old FBI file surfaced. It said Buttny trained in guerrilla warfare
methods abroad with the goal of infiltrating government. He denies
planning to overthrow the government, but he admits he once liked to
joke that he'd accomplished his secret mission by going to work for
the county. He's not laughing any more. "I find myself with e-mails
and phone calls being careful" what he says. "I don't joke about
something that might be taken the wrong way."</TE>
<TE>   Measured against the horror of Sept. 11, some of the violence in
the late '60s and early '70s seems almost quaint, but at the time,
the bombing of a restroom at the Pentagon shocked "Laugh In"-era
America.</TE>
<TE>   Violence peaked with an explosion at a Weather Underground bomb
factory in New York in 1970, which killed three members of the group.
"I was in Cuba when the townhouse blew up," said Berzon, who now
lives in the Berkeley Hills and has an 11-year-old son. "That changed
everything. We realized this is real."</TE>
<TE>   Although the Weather Underground never killed anyone but its own
members with its bombs, that wasn't true the same year in Madison,
where the Army Mathematics Research Center was bombed. A man working
inside was killed.</TE>
<TE>   "We felt really bad about someone dying and we were never able to
reconcile it," said Armstrong, who was not affiliated with the more
well-known radical groups. "It was the farthest thing from our minds.
We knew even if anyone got hurt in the bombing it would be
politically counterproductive."</TE>
<TE>   The SLA burst into prominence three years later, with the murder
of Oakland school Supt. Marcus Foster and the kidnapping of newspaper
heiress Hearst, who morphed into the gun-toting, beret-wearing Tania.</TE>
<TE>   In her 1982 book, "Every Secret Thing," Hearst described the
Carmichael robbery, during which, she said, Olson, then Kathleen
Soliah, emptied the tills while Emily Harris stood guard and William
Harris waited outside. Opsahl was killed when, Hearst said, Emily
Harris' shotgun went off accidentally. "She was a bourgeois pig
anyway," Emily Harris reportedly said.</TE>
<TE>   Six members of the SLA, including its leader, Donald DeFreeze,
died in a spectacular firefight in Los Angeles in 1974.</TE>
<TE>   After leaving prison, Armstrong reclaimed a semblance of a normal
life in 1980, and these days tends his shop, as well as a performance
space above his Madison eatery. Called Che's Lounge, it is named for
Che Guevara, the Argentine revolutionary, who is still among his
cultural heroes, Armstrong said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the last thing I thought I'd be doing," Armstrong, 55, said
by phone from his shop, where customers and employees interrupted,
and the sounds of soft reggae wafted in the background. "When you run
a small business, you develop a storekeeper's mentality. You have a
different set of concerns. Now, I have to fire people. In a
restaurant, if I catch someone with drugs, they're out the door. I'm
personally opposed to the whole war on drugs, but running a business
is a whole different shtick."</TE>
<TE>   All the Madison bombers had lived as fugitives for several years,
but only one, Leo Burt, remains at large. Sightings of him have
become folklore. Friends of Burt from that era, including Armstrong,
declined to talk about him.</TE>
<TE>   "First of all, I don't know where he is and I wouldn't want to
know where he is," said Armstrong. "And if I did find out, I wouldn't
tell."</TE>
<TE>   As for other notable extremists, two other SLA members, Russell
Little and Joseph Remiro, were arrested in connection with the Foster
slaying. Remiro remains in prison; Little was retried and acquitted.
San Francisco attorney Stuart Hanlon said Little works as a teacher
outside California and has "a wonderful life." Hanlon refused to say
where he is.</TE>
<TE>   Berzon said it will be hard for a contemporary jury to understand
the context of these decades-old crimes. "The legal system doesn't
recognize political crimes. I think it should be recognized that
however misguided [SLA members were], they were acting out of a deep
sense of wanting to do something good. Although the same thing could
be said for bin Laden, couldn't it?"</TE>
<TE>   After being cleared of the Cambridge shooting, which he called a
police setup, and his return from Cuba, Berzon dropped out of the
movement. Today, he's not politically active, which he considers a
personal failure. "Family life is hard enough," he said.</TE>

<HD>When It All Goes Downhill on the Slopes</HD>
<DH>An avalanche of winter-sports injuries leaves a tiny ER
snowed under on weekends with skiers and boarders.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUSAN HOWLETT</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>BIG BEAR</DL>
<LD>His first run of the day on the half-pipe "didn't work out," says
Phil Whitman, stating the obvious with a painful smile, a tattered
gauze sling supporting his arm.</LD>
<LD>   Still wearing his snow boots and bib overalls, the 14-year-old is
walking away from the emergency room at Bear Valley Community
Hospital--an early end to the snowboarding weekend he had planned
with his San Clemente church group. "They say I may have a broken
humerus bone, but there's a three-hour wait," he says, figuring he'll
try to find another, shorter-line hospital.</LD>
<LD>   Second only to Catalina Island's facility as the smallest hospital
in California, Bear Valley Community is stretched to the limit as the
population of this San Bernardino County resort area soars from
18,000 to 100,000 on a typical winter weekend.</LD>
<TE>   With a single physician and two registered nurses treating as many
as 90 patients in a 24-hour period, the seven-bed emergency room
becomes a Friday-through-Sunday-long episode of "Downhill ER," where
injury meets the mountain after every run gone bad.</TE>
<TE>   It's the part everyone prefers not to think about. After all, this
is where people come for a taste of the great outdoors--of sunshine
and snow, of downhill speed and beautiful vistas.</TE>
<TE>   Big Bear, in the San Bernardino National Forest about 110 miles
east of Los Angeles and 90 miles northeast of Orange County, is a
popular destination for Southern California skiers and snowboarders.
Snow Summit and Bear Mountain resorts are just two miles apart and
within the service area of Big Bear City Fire Department and Bear
Valley Community Hospital.</TE>
<TE>   "It looks like Beirut in there," a woman says one Saturday of the
hospital lobby, a small room with folding chairs, overflowing before
noon with scores of banged-up but surprisingly patient patients.</TE>
<TE>   "They're doing their best," says Jane Morris, 26, of Rancho
Cucamonga, who hadn't heard anything since her husband, Robert, was
brought in by ambulance an hour earlier from Snow Summit after
slamming into a tree on his snowboard. "But this is the only place up
here. How do they handle all these people?"</TE>
<TE>   This is not a specialty trauma center but a small-town ER. Those
with the mountain's most common hard knocks--broken wrists, blown-out
knees, cuts and contusions--receive emergency treatment here. So do
those hurt in traffic accidents and suffering heart attacks brought
on by the 7,000-foot altitude. Those with the most serious injuries
are typically airlifted from adjacent Big Bear Airport to Loma Linda
University Medical Center in Redlands or Arrowhead Regional Hospital
in San Bernardino.</TE>
<TE>   Bear Valley Community is only half a mile from Snow Summit, a
little more than that from Bear Mountain. So by ambulance, by car or
simply limping in on their own, the ailing come here. When the
hospital is in a state of injury overload, necessity is the mother of
invention.</TE>
<TE>   "We set up army cots in the ER ... we do our job," says registered
nurse Dawn Macey, squinting at the late morning sun before returning
to her 12-hour shift. "Sure, a bigger ER would help," she says. "But
for now we're just here, giving great care with what we have."</TE>
<TE>   Rick Rolston, Big Bear City Fire Division chief of emergency
medical services, says all involved have learned to juggle the
available resources. "We always have places to put them, but at
certain times it gets very busy and very challenging," he says.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, he says, a three-year plan is in the works to expand
the hospital.</TE>
<TE>   Big Bear is not alone among ski areas seeing increased pressure on
medical facilities. Last winter marked a record 57.3 million visits
to U.S. ski resorts, according to the Colorado-based National Ski
Areas Assn. There are 490 ski areas nationwide, 31 of those in
California.</TE>
<TE>   On a recent Sunday at Mammoth Mountain, Mammoth Hospital's
seven-bed emergency room treated about 100 patients, says hospital
spokeswoman Lori Ciccarelli. "We don't have army cots, but on the
weekends during the winter, gurneys are lined up in the hallway," she
says. Mountain High in Wrightwood has different challenges delivering
emergency medical treatment--the nearest hospital is at least 40
minutes away, and many injuries are treated at the first aid station
on site.</TE>
<TE>   While few ski areas release individual injury statistics or the
annual number of accidents on their mountains, the national ski
association reports that an average of 34 people are critically
injured on American slopes each year. The number was higher in the
2000-2001 season, when 33 skiers and 11 snowboarders were seriously
hurt.</TE>
<TE>   "Nationally, we had a record season last year," says Stacy
Stoutenberg of the ski association. "There are just more people out
there skiing."</TE>
<TE>   Locally, Snow Summit president Richard Kun says that it is
actually getting safer out there--at least on his slopes.</TE>
<TE>   "Injury-wise, we are on a decline in both frequency and severity
from, say, three or four years ago," Kun said. "It is much better now
that everybody's used to the skiers and the snowboarders together on
the mountain."</TE>
<TE>   But as the overall number of people on the slopes has steadily
increased in the decade and a half that Rolston has headed the EMS
program in Big Bear, so have the number of injuries. "It was a more
seasonal call volume back then, with big lags in the spring and
fall," recalls Rolston, who came from Orange County to the rural
mountain community 17 years ago to start up the EMS division. "In
1985 we had actual days when we didn't have a call," he says. "It's
not that way now."</TE>
<TE>   The Big Bear City Fire Department works in close cooperation with
the hospital. The department employs 45 men and women, including
firefighters, paramedics and support personnel, says Rolston.
"Everybody works with everybody up here ... that's just the way it
is," he says.</TE>
<TE>   The department's five advanced-support ambulances, three paramedic
engines and one paramedic squad are in constant use. And on peak days
they have a couple of temporary "day cars" to service increased
demand.</TE>
<TE>   All this goes on throughout the snow season--which usually takes
off starting in mid-November and winds down about mid-April.</TE>
<TE>   Patrolling the mountain at Snow Summit are about 25 rescuers who
make about 50 runs a day on weekends, according to one ski patrolman
taking a quick break before going back up the mountain. The patrol
treats minor injuries at its own overflowing first aid center and
transports patients as needed to Bear Valley Community.</TE>
<TE>   Skiing and snowboarding are not the only winter-sport activities
that land folks in the hospital. Other hazards include falling
through thin ice at Big Bear Lake, inner-tubing and other "snow
play," says Rolston.</TE>
<TE>   "Some of our most severe injuries ... the worst things we have
seen are from snow play in uncontrolled areas, usually behind a house
or a big hill somewhere," says Rolston. "Typically, what we see
occurring is that they often underestimate the steepness of the hill
and where the inner tube will stop, which is usually into a tree."</TE>
<TE>   Contributing to some of the distorted judgment calls is alcohol
use, which creates the usual problems and more when combined with the
mountain altitudes.</TE>
<TE>   All of Southern California's major ski areas--Mammoth Mountain,
Snow Summit, Bear Mountain and Wrightwood's Mountain High--have
special security patrols positioned on the slopes to police reckless
skiers and disruptive behavior, including use of alcohol.</TE>
<TE>   "If we see them indulging on the ski area, we remove their booze
or take their ticket," says Kun of Snow Summit.</TE>
<TE>   Snowboarding, skiing and other mountain sports are dangerous
enough without pouring alcohol into the mix, says Rolston, who adds
that visitors often underestimate the rapid heat loss that occurs
when blood vessels dilate after consuming alcohol at high altitudes.</TE>
<TE>   "People should not be mixing alcohol and cold up here," he says.
"We have a lot of problems with hikers doing this. They are very
susceptible to hypothermia."</TE>
<TE>   But liquid courage in bota bags is nothing new to the slopes.</TE>
<TE>   "Yeah, just like every other bar, we have to cut people off," says
one bartender, pouring shots of Red Bull and vodka on the deck at
Snow Summit.</TE>
<TE>   "There are at least three people that I would refuse to serve
right now if they came back," she says. "We pop every beer when they
leave [to prevent people from hiding unopened cans and taking them up
the lifts], and they watch people on the mountain ... you have to be
careful."</TE>
<TE>   By early afternoon the waiting room at Bear Valley Community is a
collage of pain-filled faces belonging to those who have been here
for hours and those just arrived. A cluster of snowboarders gather
outside to have a cigarette, relate injury stories and wait for their
names to be called.</TE>
<TE>   A gray-haired volunteer in a pink smock performs her own brand of
triage in the cramped waiting room. Grandmotherly yet officious, she
logs in patients while scanning the lobby for an available folding
chair or unoccupied spot on the bench facing the parking lot.</TE>
<TE>   "I haven't heard anything yet," says Jane Morris, who has now
waited three hours to hear about her husband's condition. "It could
be a bruised kidney or something. He was just going back for an
X-ray."</TE>
<TE>   Wounded or worried, all eyes are on the volunteer as she rises,
clipboard in hand. "Jeff Meyer?" she asks searchingly. "Is there a
Jeff Meyer here?" In pain from a visibly broken wrist suffered from
"board-sliding on the box" at Snow Summit, 15-year-old Jeff Meyer of
Upland manages just enough teen bravado to answer.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm here," he says, holding his arm as he stands. Unlike most
others here seeking treatment, Meyer, unfortunately, is a repeat
customer.</TE>
<TE>   "The funny thing is, we were here last Thanksgiving for the same
thing," says Eric Ferguson, 27, Meyer's uncle, wincing himself from a
tailbone bruising suffered on the slopes about 100 feet from his
fallen nephew.</TE>
<TE>   "We waited for four hours then," offers the injured teen's father,
Marshall Meyer. "But they are very good here," he said. "They
followed up on him a few days after and everything to make sure he
was OK."</TE>
<TE>   Outside, an ambulance arrives with a woman on a backboard,
followed a few moments later by three more emergency units with
patients. An emergency helicopter zooms overhead on its way to the
trauma center at Loma Linda.</TE>
<TE>   "I was taking lessons, and they had to come and get me," says Kim
Bowlds, 23, of San Diego, sitting with her husband, Justin, who is
holding his arm next to her in silent pain.</TE>
<TE>   "I guess he just toppled and popped something," she says. "That
was two hours ago."</TE>
<TE>   Fours hours later, Bowlds and her husband leave the hospital. "His
collarbone is separated from his shoulder," she says, helping her
husband into their car.</TE>
<TE>   By late afternoon, as scores of weary visitors load skis and
snowboards on top of their cars for the slow traffic crawl down
Highway 18, Jane Morris remains at Bear Valley Community. After
waiting more than five hours, she has just received word that her
husband is being transported by ambulance to Kaiser Permanente
Hospital in Fontana with a back injury that may need surgery. With
all units busy, they are waiting for a transfer ambulance.</TE>
<TE>   "He's been ready to go for an hour now, but he's waiting for a
ride," she says, pulling out her cell phone to make plans for the
long trip and yet another wait at yet another hospital.</TE>
<TE>   Sitting back down in the folding chair with a sigh, she is
composed. "I'm happy it wasn't worse ... no internal injuries."</TE>
<TE>   Brushing by Morris and heading to his car, another patient with a
broken wrist leaves Bear Valley Community Hospital holding a bag of
ice in one hand, his X-rays in the other. He climbs into his
SUV--snowboard on top--and heads down the mountain. "I can't wait
around," he says. "Excellent service, though."</TE>
<TE>   His upbeat attitude in the face of mishap is peculiar to many
who've made the detour to this medical way station: They may be in
pain, but by and large, they had fun getting that way.</TE>
<TE>   Among those taking the whole experience in stride is Travis
Hodges, 28, a Big Bear local, sporting a "what's the big deal"
attitude along with a gash above his right eye.</TE>
<TE>   "What happened? I hit my head on the snow," says Hodges. "It will
probably heal by the time I get in there."</TE>
<TE>   Hodges, who says his bloody eye is the latest of about half a
dozen snowboarding injuries, was wearing goggles that smashed into
his face when he fell. "I actually have a piece of my eyelid in my
goggles," he says, wiping blood from his eye with a smile. "I'll
heal."</TE>

<LD>Bridgett was staring into her computer keyboard tapping on the keys.
A-S-D-F-J-K-L-semicolon, A-S-D-F-J-K-L-semicolon. Tap, tap, tap. How
could she write her assignment that was due tomorrow in just one
night? Procrastinating was Bridgett's favorite thing to do, her
mother always said. Bridgett wished she had started her project on
sea mammals last week instead of going to the movies. She looked at
the computer screen once again and felt sleepy. She blinked, closed
her eyes and made a wish.</LD>
<LD>   "If only I could be inside my computer, I bet I'd get an idea."
Then Bridgett felt tingly all over. She opened her eyes, and her arms
and legs felt funny and weightless. She was inside the computer! She
could see her desk from the other side of the computer monitor. Small
zeros and ones drifted past her head. Swish! Whirl! Zip! Sounds came
at her from every direction. She walked toward a glowing light. Am I
dreaming?</LD>
<LD>   Suddenly something tapped her on the shoulder and said, "Hey,
looking for me? Click."</LD>
<TE>   Bridgett turned to face a funny-looking creature. He stood no
taller than 3 feet and hovered above the ground. His face was gray
and blue with green eyes. His body was the shape of a rectangle. His
feet were 3 inches long with wings on his heels. His hands were the
letters A and Z. He wore a suit made of ones and zeros, and his hat
was shaped like a cursor.</TE>
<TE>   "I am Bookmark. Click," he said. "I am your guide to the Internet.
Where do you want to go?"</TE>
<TE>   "How did I get inside my computer?" she asked.</TE>
<TE>   "You wished it. Click." He whirled around in the air and stared
down at her. Bridgett noticed that they were floating toward a
glowing road.</TE>
<TE>   "What's that?" Bridgett asked as she and Bookmark moved on.</TE>
<TE>   "Haven't you heard of the Digital Highway? This is it. Click."</TE>

<LD>Question: Is it "Feed a cold and starve a fever," or vice versa?</LD>
<LD>   Answer: Neither, actually, according to Dr. Jack Gwaltney of the
University of Virginia School of Medicine. The idea of depriving any
sick person of food is "totally off the wall," Gwaltney said. A sick
patient should receive a steady, nutritious diet no matter the
illness.</LD>
<LD>   Rest and drinking plenty of fluids are particularly important, he
added. The more rest a person gets, the more energy the body has to
fight the infection.</LD>

<HD>Alcohol Helps Prevent Alzheimer's, Study Says</HD>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Moderate daily consumption of alcohol, which has already been shown
to help prevent heart disease and strokes, can also ward off
Alzheimer's disease and other types of dementia, according to Dutch
researchers. Whether the alcohol comes in the form of beer, wine or
liquor does not appear to matter, according to a team from Erasmus
University in Rotterdam, as long as the consumption is
moderate--between one and three drinks per day.</LD>
<LD>   The researchers conducted a six-year study of 5,395 people age 55
and over. The team reported in the Jan. 26 Lancet that people who
consumed one to three drinks per day had a 42% lower risk of dementia
than did nondrinkers. Those who weren't daily drinkers but had more
than one drink per week had a 25% lower risk.</LD>
<LD>   The researchers speculate that drinking may stimulate the release
of acetylcholine, a brain chemical that seems to stimulate memory, or
may have an impact on blood flow that helps stave off dementia.</LD>

<LD>Stem cell transplants during the first 28 days after birth are 95%
successful in curing infants with severe combined immunodeficiency,
according to researchers at Duke University.</LD>
<LD>   Infants who receive the transplants during that period have a more
robust immune system than those who receive transplants later, the
researchers report in the February issue of Blood.</LD>
<LD>   Over the last 19 years, surgeons at Duke have performed stem cell
transplants on 117 SCID patients. Of the 21 who received transplants
in the first four weeks, 20 are still alive and leading normal lives.

<HD>Stars Untwinkled</HD>
<DH>Earth's atmosphere makes for a dancing, distorted image,
and that's a problem for astronomers. Enter the art of adaptive
optics.</DH>

<BD>TIMES SCIENCE WRITER</BD>

<LD>Since the days of Galileo, astronomers have been plagued by one
consistent drawback: the Earth's atmosphere. Starlight can travel
undisturbed through empty space for hundreds of light-years. But in
the last few nanoseconds before it hits Earth and its telescopes, the
light gets distorted by swirling winds and air currents.</LD>
<LD>   "It gives you a very fuzzy, dancing image," said Fred Chaffee, who
directs the world's largest telescope, the Keck, and has long been
frustrated by the inability of the powerful machine to create sharper
images. "The reason stars twinkle is because of the atmosphere."</LD>
<LD>   Now, four centuries after Galileo lifted his handmade "spyglasses"
toward the moons of Jupiter, astronomers have a high-tech fix for
their earthbound telescopes. Adaptive optics systems look at guide
stars to measure atmospheric distortions. The system then uses those
measurements to change the shape of a mirror that can be bent up to a
thousand times per second to correct for the rapid fluctuations of
the atmosphere.</LD>
<TE>   "It's like putting eyeglasses on a telescope," said Andrea Ghez, a
UCLA astronomer who is using adaptive optics to probe a supermassive
black hole that appears to reside at the center of the Milky Way.</TE>
<TE>   Ghez's work requires measuring the stars rotating around the edge
of the black hole. "You just can't see the stars without adaptive
optics," she said. "And if you can't see the stars, you can't do the
work."</TE>
<TE>   The idea to correct telescopes was first proposed by California
astronomer Horace Babcock in the 1950s. The military developed some
of the technology in its "Star Wars" program and declassified it in
1991. High-speed computing, the development of glass mirrors so thin
they can be easily deformed and a lot of hard work in recent years
have made it a reality.</TE>
<TE>   "It's actually very hard to do," said Jerry Nelson, the designer
of Keck's 30-meter mirror and the director of the Center for Adaptive
Optics, a National Science Foundation center based at UC Santa Cruz.
"It's a very sophisticated procedure."</TE>
<TE>   The first adaptive optics systems have been in place on some of
the world's biggest telescopes, including Keck and Gemini on Mauna
Kea, Hawaii, for less than two years. Already, the system has
produced impressive results, including several highlighted this month
when astronomers gathered for their annual meeting in Washington,
D.C.</TE>
<TE>   UC Berkeley astronomer Imke de Pater has been using adaptive
optics to look at objects closer to home--the planets in our solar
system. Adaptive optics has been able to focus images of Neptune to
such an extent that the images are as good or better than those taken
by spacecraft flying by the planet, she said.</TE>
<TE>   She has been able to make out storms in Neptune's atmosphere,
suggesting mysterious activity on a body that was previously seen as
something of a planetary dud.</TE>
<TE>   Another victory for adaptive optics came in 1999, when astronomers
turned Keck toward Io, one of the moons of Jupiter, because the night
was too cloudy to observe more distant objects. They happened to
catch a volcano in the act of erupting. In an image unblurred by
adaptive optics, the volcano was a large, bright blip on the edge of
the moon.</TE>
<TE>   Ray Jayawardhana, a research fellow at UC Berkeley, is trying to
understand the details of how planets form from the dusty disks that
surround young stars. Using adaptive optics on the 8.2-meter Gemini
telescope, he led a team that captured an image of a protoplanetary
disk circling an extremely young star. The image was so detailed, the
team could infer the shape of the disk and the size of dust particles
within it--particles that could one day grow into planets like Earth.</TE>
<TE>   Astronomers are now racing to capture an image of a Jupiter-sized
planet circling a young star. Jupiter-like planets have been detected
indirectly by other astronomers, but no images have been captured
because current telescopes had not been able to discern the dimmer
planets from the bright stars they orbit. "It's possible now only
because of adaptive optics on large telescopes," Jayawardhana said.</TE>
<TE>   Space telescopes such as Hubble avoid the vagaries of the
atmosphere by orbiting above it, but they are costly to build and
maintain and therefore much smaller than telescopes on the ground,
limiting their use for tasks such as planet hunting.</TE>
<TE>   A UCLA team used adaptive optics to probe some of the most distant
reaches of the universe in a hunt for young galaxies that could help
explain how galaxies evolve. Because adaptive optics systems require
a guide star to correct fluctuations in the atmosphere, the team
could probe only areas of the sky that were near relatively bright
stars.</TE>
<TE>   "We call it the looking-around-the-street-lamp technique," said
Tiffany Glassman, an astronomy graduate student who conducted the
search with her advisor, James Larkin. Luckily, there were plenty of
galaxies in those regions--and plenty of detail to capture with the
new technology. "Without adaptive optics, we can barely tell they're
galaxies and not stars," she said. With adaptive optics, the two
could distinguish disks and bulges and even spiral arms within the
distant galaxies.</TE>
<TE>   Those using adaptive optics have been restricted in what part of
the sky they could search because of their need for guide stars.
Stars bright enough to serve that purpose exist in only 1% of the
sky. Astronomers are now moving past that barrier by creating their
own guide stars with powerful lasers.</TE>
<TE>   A team of engineers from Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory
spent a weekend atop the summit of Mauna Kea, installing a 200-watt
dye laser on the Keck telescope. The $7-million laser shoots a beam
of yellowish-orange light 60 miles into the sky. The laser is the
precise wavelength of light needed to chemically excite a layer of
sodium atoms--leftovers from burning meteors--that hovers in the
Earth's atmosphere. When the laser hits them, the sodium atoms light
up and send that light back to Earth. It's light that "looks for all
intents and purposes like a star," Chaffee said.</TE>
<TE>   The instrument is "literally bolted to the side of the telescope,
so when the telescope moves, the laser goes with you," said Deanna
Pennington, a laser physicist from Livermore now working in Hawaii to
install the new laser. "You create your own reference star." Once the
laser is tested and fully working this summer, it should open up most
of the sky to adaptive optics, except close to the horizon or near
spy satellites or planes--places where shining the laser is taboo.</TE>
<TE>   Those who run telescopes aren't stopping at just one laser. There
are plans to outfit the Gemini telescope with five lasers to create a
system that could apply suitable corrections to each of the
atmosphere's different levels and create even clearer images. And
Nelson's center is working on micromechanical sensors that could make
deformable mirrors smaller, cheaper and more responsive.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a real revolution," he said. "And it's just starting."</TE>

<HD>MTV2 Takes Its Show on the Road</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>   Two much two soon? Not if the folks at MTV2 have anything to say
about it. MTV's younger sibling launches a low-priced concert series
aimed at breaking upcoming acts--and heightening awareness of MTV2's
avowed mission to promote rising talent--on Saturday (which calendar
watchers will recognize as 2/2/02).</LD>
<LD>   The series, titled "$2 Bill," has two components: the live show,
which will take place in a different city each month, and a telecast
over MTV2. Saturday's inaugural show, in L.A., features New York
neo-punk band the Strokes. Tickets are $2 and go on sale tonight at
midnight at the Virgin Megastore on the Sunset Strip, with a limit
of--what else?--two per person. The location of the performance is
being kept under wraps until Friday.</LD>
<TE>   MTV2 will air a 30-minute chunk of the concert live at 4 p.m.
Saturday for the channel's 37 million households around the country.
(KROQ-FM [106.7] will air the audio.) Additional concerts will be
held on the second of each month  through the year. Acts confirmed
include India.Arie, Alien Ant Farm and Jimmy Eat World.</TE>
<TE>   "Most of 2001 was spent establishing who we are and our
credibility in music," says MTV2 General Manager David Cohn. "This
next phase will be to start working with those bands ... to sort of
jump off the channel and get closer to the audience with some of the
bands that really are our lifeblood."</TE>
<TE>   The goal is to increase MTV2's reach to something closer to that
of its older, bigger brother, which is accessible to 77 million
households nationally, Cohn says. MTV2 was born in 1996 but has been
available in Los Angeles on Adelphia cable only since October, one
indicator of the continuing struggle new channels face in the
increasingly crowded cable world.</TE>

<LD>The force is with Carrie Fisher. The actress and author who first
came to stardom as Princess Leia in the "Star Wars" trilogy has
nabbed a rare TV interview with her former boss, "Star Wars" creator
George Lucas, for the latest installment of Oxygen's "Conversations
From the Edge With Carrie Fisher," premiering Wednesday at 10:30 p.m.</LD>
<LD>   The two reunite in the library of Lucas' picturesque Skywalker
Ranch in Northern California for a freewheeling discussion, with
Lucas disclosing how he chose Fisher for the role and what the origin
of her unusual dual-bun hairstyle was.</LD>
<LD>   Lucas also surprises Fisher with her screen test for "Star Wars"
and reveals that Terri Nunn, the lead singer of the rock group
Berlin, was his second choice for Princess Leia.</LD>
<TE>   "George Lucas doesn't like doing interviews all that much, but
he's extremely comfortable with Carrie," said the show's executive
producer, Neal Kendall. "And Carrie was just ecstatic. They have
remained friends, but she had not been up to the ranch in a long
time."</TE>
<TE>   Lucas, who is starting to rev up the buzz machine for the next
"Star Wars" installment, "Episode 2--Attack of the Clones," is also
the subject of a new A&amp;E biography that premiered Sunday and will air
several times this month.</TE>

<HD>Some Accumulated Signs of the End Times</HD>
<DH>In Chicago, an exhibition looks at art made to illustrate
doomsday predictions. The signs of the apocalypse: locusts,
seven-headed beasts and attack from the sky.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>F.N. D'ALESSIO</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>CHICAGO</DL>
<LD>If recent world events make you wonder if The End is near, take
heart. You have plenty of company.</LD>
<LD>   But apocalyptic predictions are hardly new, and everyone who has
made one has been wrong--at least so far. Remember Y2K?</LD>
<LD>   An ominous painting on display at a local gallery is a case in
point. The large oil by Henrietta Black shows the proud towers of an
unidentified city crumbling in flames after an attack from the sky. A
tombstone in a nearby graveyard bears the artist's name and the year
of her death as 1933. But a companion painting by Black, showing four
symbolic beasts from the biblical book of Daniel, is dated 1935--two
years after her prophesied death.</LD>
<TE>   In reality, Black lived until 1971, earning much of her income as
a greeting card artist for Hallmark Cards Inc., in Kansas City, Mo.
Her two paintings on display at Intuit: The Center for Intuitive and
Outsider Art were completed for the Rev. A.P. Ferrell, an itinerant
prophet of doom who traveled the Midwest in the 1930s with eight such
pictures, which he used as charts of the coming end times.</TE>
<TE>   Black's paintings, as well as the other works at Intuit show, are
from the Jenks Memorial Collection of Adventual Materials at Aurora
University in suburban Aurora, Ill., a repository of art and
documents left by some of the millennial movements that have arisen
in America since the 1830s.</TE>
<TE>   It is an exhibit heavy on falling stars, earthquakes, locusts with
the heads of men and seven-headed beasts with 10 horns. Most of the
works are frameless hangings, meant to be suspended on ropes at tent
meetings. One, an undated piece by New Hampshire artist C.H. Locke,
is 6 feet high and 38 feet long.</TE>
<TE>   "I saw an article about the Aurora art in 1999, when all the
newspapers were running millennial stories, and I thought it would be
a natural for our gallery," said Intuit executive director Jeff Cory.
"It's striking work, and most of the artists were completely
self-trained."</TE>
<TE>   The centerpiece of the exhibit, which runs through Feb. 23, is a
large chart prepared in 1843 by followers of William Miller, whose
obsession with the prophecies in the books of Daniel and Revelation
led to the first great wave of American millennialism.</TE>
<TE>   As a young man, the Massachusetts-born Miller was hardly a
Bible-thumper. He was a political follower of Thomas Jefferson and
considered himself--like Jefferson--a rationalist in religious
outlook.</TE>
<TE>   Miller became a prosperous farmer along the Vermont-New York
border and held various minor political posts before going off, at
age 30, to fight in the War of 1812.</TE>
<TE>   Something in his war experiences led Miller to a religious crisis,
and by 1816 he was a devout Baptist. He also began an intensive
course of Bible study aimed at proving that the scriptures were
consistent with themselves, despite apparent contradictions.</TE>
<TE>   Miller later said he discovered timetables for the second coming
of Christ in Daniel and Revelation. When he calibrated those
timetables against various biblical and historic events, he
determined that the Second Coming would occur in 1843 or 1844.</TE>
<TE>   Miller made that momentous discovery in 1822 but kept it a secret
until 1831--two years before he was licensed to preach at the Baptist
church in Low Hampton, N.Y.</TE>
<TE>   He made few converts until 1838, when an economic depression
deepened throughout the nation. Suddenly, the "Millerite" movement
began to snowball. An influential Boston clergyman, Elder Joshua V.
Himes, joined the cause and used his knowledge of publicity
techniques to flood the northern and western states with "Millerite"
tracts, books and newspapers. Himes also commissioned artists and
lithographers to create charts and pictures as visual aids for the
movement's evangelists. Those works now form the core of the Aurora
collection.</TE>
<TE>   Miller had no intention of founding his own church and urged his
followers to remain within their own denominations, so estimates of
the number of Millerites are hazy. Most scholars believe there were
from 50,000 to 100,000 people in the movement at its height.</TE>
<TE>   In 1842, Miller announced that the end would come between March
21, 1843, and March 21, 1844. When the latter date passed
uneventfully, one of his followers went back to the prophecies,
corrected a supposed error by Miller, and set a new date for the
Second Coming as Oct. 22, 1844.</TE>
<TE>   Miller and Himes accepted the new date only with reluctance and
were reportedly not surprised when it, too, proved to be a false
alarm. Although he still believed the end was near, Miller issued an
apology and retired from the prophecy business.</TE>
<TE>   "They called it 'The Great Disappointment,'" said Ken Mull, a
retired professor of religion at Aurora. "Some of Miller's followers
gave up religion completely, while more simply went back to their old
churches with egg on their faces. Some, though, kept true to their
end times beliefs. They split into at least a half dozen
denominations with a variety of ways of interpreting the numbers in
the prophecies."</TE>
<TE>   Aurora University--then Aurora College--was founded by one of
those groups, the Advent Christian Church, and remained affiliated
with it until 1971.</TE>

<HD>These Pop and Soul Acts Still Preach the Gospel</HD>
<DH>Destiny's Child, Faith Evans and others acknowledge the
genre's influence in a BET special.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE APPLEFORD</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The old spirituals still echo loudly through popular music. They can
be heard in the modern grooves of Destiny's Child and Angie Stone,
modern pop 'n' soul singers who are wise enough to maintain a
connection to classic gospel even as they reach for the charts.</LD>
<LD>   By its very nature, gospel is a sound of meaning and deep feeling,
features that could be heard repeatedly at the Wiltern Theatre on
Saturday as Black Entertainment Television, or BET, taped its second
annual "Celebration of Gospel" special for airing Feb. 16. Hymns
rotated with hip-hop during a two-hour concert that gathered such
veteran singers as Andrae Crouch and Shirley Caesar,  along with
younger stars.</LD>
<LD>   Destiny's Child appeared early in the program, standing close
together for a medley of mostly a cappella gospel, harmonizing the
prayer "Lord, I'm Available to You." The occasional lead vocal was
taken by newest member Michelle Williams, whose upcoming solo album
is planned as a gospel collection.</LD>
<TE>   Like most acts Saturday, Destiny's Child was limited to just one
song, which kept the trio from probing deeper into the music. But the
result was typically polished and effective.</TE>
<TE>   Beyond its original role as a spiritual soundtrack, black gospel
has concurrently fueled some of the greatest R&amp;B music from the last
several decades, inspiring such major artists as Aretha Franklin and
Ray Charles.</TE>
<TE>   That fact hasn't been lost on Kirk Franklin, who has crafted
modern interpretations of the sound without abandoning its purpose.</TE>
<TE>   Franklin led a 15-voice choir in green-and-purple robes through
"The Blood Song," as guest vocalists Donnie McClurkin, Crystal Lewis
and Jaci Velasquez took turns at the microphone, singing and
shouting, "It doesn't matter what color I am as long as my blood runs
red!"</TE>
<TE>   R&amp;B star Faith Evans slipped into gospel mode with surprising
ease, approaching genuinely soulful heights on "Speak to My Heart."
She joined a lineup that included the big-voiced Fred Hammond singing
"When We Praise" in tones strong and soothing, and the frantically
energetic Curt Carr, who urged the crowd once again to its feet as
female backup singers harmonized behind him.</TE>
<TE>   While the night was designed mainly as a television program, the
concert was tightly organized by BET, which has announced plans to
launch an all-gospel cable network this year. Even during frequent
commercial breaks, the night never lost momentum, owing much to the
spontaneous humor of host Steve Harvey.</TE>
<TE>   Harvey was actually at his best during the breaks rather than in
his scripted material, joking about the self-importance of church
ushers and pointedly ribbing the video crew. "L.A. don't normally
dress up," he joked, scanning the crowd. "This is the church crowd,
now. You look like you know you're going to heaven."</TE>
<TE>   On an elaborate stage design that suggested the gothic arches and
stained glass of a church, all of the acts were accompanied by the
Rickey Minor Band, which had enough range to accommodate both the
explosive likes of Caesar and Crouch, and the hip-hop-flavored gospel
of Mary Mary, a duo whose material was not overtly Christian, but
energetically hopeful.</TE>

<HD>'Black Hawk Down' Posts New Victory in Theaters</HD>
<DH>Box Office *  Ridley Scott's thriller earns an estimated
$18.2 million to hold on to the top spot.</DH>

<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Moviegoers remain on combat alert. The frenzied military thriller
"Black Hawk Down" held the top spot at the box office for a second
straight weekend, taking in $18.2 million.</LD>
<LD>   The No. 2 slot shaped up as a photo finish between Cuba Gooding
Jr.'s canine comedy "Snow Dogs" and pop singer Mandy Moore's weepy
teen romance "A Walk to Remember," according to studio estimates
Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   Disney estimated "Snow Dogs" grossed $13.6 million its second
weekend; Warner Bros. estimated "A Walk to Remember" premiered with
$13.57 million.</LD>
<TE>   "Mandy's certainly been a star in the recording studio, and she's
now a real deal moving on to the big screen," said Dan Fellman, head
of distribution for Warner Bros.</TE>
<TE>   Other top films were bunched up tightly, and their rankings could
change when studios release final weekend figures today.</TE>
<TE>   The Richard Gere supernatural thriller "The Mothman Prophecies"
premiered at No. 4 with an estimated $11.8 million.</TE>
<TE>   Fresh off its success at the Golden Globes a week ago, "A
Beautiful Mind" held well at No. 5 with $11.7 million. "A Beautiful
Mind" dominated the Globes with four awards, including best dramatic
film, lead dramatic actor for Russell Crowe and supporting actress
for Jennifer Connelly.</TE>
<TE>   The latest remake of "The Count of Monte Cristo," starring Jim
Caviezel and Guy Pearce, opened at No. 6, with $11.5 million.</TE>
<TE>   "All these films are evenly splitting the audience," said Paul
Dergarabedian, president of box-office tracker Exhibitor Relations.</TE>
<TE>   "Moviegoers are interested in all these films to some degree, and
the demographics are just being split between all these movies."</TE>
<TE>   After a limited premiere in December to qualify for the Oscars, "I
Am Sam" expanded to wider release and grossed $8.3 million, finishing
at No. 7. Starring Sean Penn and Michelle Pfeiffer, "I Am Sam"
follows a mentally retarded man trying to win custody of his
daughter.</TE>
<TE>   "Lord of the Rings," still at No. 8 despite being in theaters
since Dec. 19, added another $8 million to its blockbuster haul. The
weekend's other wide premiere, the martial-arts spoof "Kung Pow:
Enter the Fist," opened at No. 9 with $7.3 million. And the teen
comedy "Orange County," which took in $4.6 million stayed in the top
10.</TE>
<TE>   The top 12 movies grossed $115.3 million, up 56% from the same
weekend a year ago, when the Super Bowl dampened theater attendance.
Studios expect a similarly slow time during next weekend's Super
Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   "I Am Sam" had the best per-theater take among the top 10 films,
averaging $6,565 in 1,268 theaters, followed by "Black Hawk Down,"
with a $5,869 average in 3,101 theaters.</TE>
<TE>   "Black Hawk Down" director Ridley Scott's intense rendering of a
1993 U.S. military raid gone awry in Somalia has grossed $60.1
million in 10 days of wide release after a narrow premiere in
December for Oscar qualification.</TE>
<TE>   In limited release, Italian director Nanni Moretti's "The Son's
Room," which won top honors at last spring's Cannes Film Festival,
premiered strongly with $45,000 in one theater.</TE>
<TE>   Writer-director Todd Solondz's black comedy "Storytelling" opened
well in four New York City and Los Angeles theaters, taking in
$82,000 for a $20,500 average. The film expands to more cities Feb.
8.</TE>

<BD>TIMES MUSIC WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Brilliant solos and felicitous programming came together during the
first Los Angeles Chamber Orchestra performance of 2002, Friday night
in UCLA's Royce Hall.</LD>
<LD>   Pianist Robert Levin was the guest, joined in the spotlight by
music director Jeffrey Kahane for the most famous of Mozart's
concertos for two pianos.</LD>
<LD>   There were other bonuses as well, including trumpeters David
Washburn and Darren Mulder, featured in Vivaldi's Concerto in C for
two trumpets.</LD>
<TE>   And Levin, at mid-program, offered a sonata-like, one-movement
improvisation on themes submitted by members of the audience, the
results of which were clever and entertaining. Levin also played
Mozart's C-minor Piano Concerto, K. 491.</TE>
<TE>   With Kahane conducting, the orchestra played spiritedly and with
its usual panache, assisting the soloists comfortably. By itself, the
ensemble offered Peteris Vasks' Cantabile for Strings, a piece
postponed from the opening concert of this season. The Latvian
composer's seven-minute essay (1979), a mix of complementary
contemporary styles, fit neatly into this program.</TE>
<TE>   Bright pianism was the focus of this performance, however. It
concluded with the double concerto, which became a happy event but
not a relaxed one. Brilliant pianists both, Kahane and Levin do not
mesh as a team. They seem to work from opposite sides of the
brain--one is a poet, the other a smarty-pants--and the result does
not add up to a charming whole. One admired the efficiency of the
performance without being touched by it.</TE>
<TE>   Levin's playing of K. 491 also lacked integration of Mozart's dark
and light sides, both of which inform this masterpiece. The total
became undramatic and shallow.</TE>

<HD>O'Donnell's Joke Wasn't So Funny to Some</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRISTINA A. CHAPLIN</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Rosie was only joking, but the Epilepsy Foundation, the General
Creation toy company and many viewers didn't think it was very funny.</LD>
<LD>   The occasion was an episode of "The Rosie O'Donnell Show" last
month. The program was giving away General Creation's Baby Go Boom
doll, and the host was demonstrating what the toy does, which is to
fall down while learning to walk and say "Baby go boom." It also
shakes and giggles after being tickled.</LD>
<LD>   Rosie remarked that the doll was "also known as Baby Having a
Seizure."</LD>
<TE>   There was more laughter from her band than there was from the
audience. She then compounded the insult by inviting her dog onstage
to attack the doll. "Cloudy! Cloudy, look!" she called. "It's Baby Go
Boom! Look! Look! Get the doll! Get the baby having a seizure! Come
on!" She told the audience, "He normally attacks the Baby Go Boom
doll. It's so funny. And he bites the head."</TE>
<TE>   Thanks, Rosie.</TE>
<TE>   A representative for "The Rosie O'Donnell Show" later said, "The
word 'seizure' was used in comedic banter and there was certainly no
intention to offend anyone."</TE>
<TE>   She may not have meant to offend, but she certainly scared one
little boy. On the Epilepsy Foundation's Web site forum called
Parents Helping Parents, one parent wrote, "My child is now afraid of
having a seizure and afraid that a dog is going to kill him. I
thanked them ["The Rosie O'Donnell Show"] profusely for instilling
those thoughts in my child's head."</TE>
<TE>   But there was more. Later in the show, Rosie continued to talk
about the doll with her guest Tim Allen. He suggested that the doll
should have come with a pencil that could be placed in its mouth
"when it does that thing." Rosie just laughed.</TE>
<TE>   I'm sure you have heard the old myth that if you see someone
having a seizure, you should put a pencil or something in the
person's mouth to keep them from biting their tongue. It's a bad
idea. What if the person bites the pencil in half while they are in
seizure? That can cause lead poisoning. What if the broken pencil
falls down and lodges in the person's throat? They could choke to
death.</TE>
<TE>   I had someone do that to me one time, and they never tried to do
it again. I made sure of that.</TE>
<TE>   Yes. I have epilepsy. I'm not a parent, but I know how it feels to
grow up having kids call you a weirdo, a freak, and other names I'd
rather not recall, just because of something I couldn't control. Kids
can be cruel to other children who are different. I had seizures on
the playground if another kid accidentally bumped me or startled me.
I had seizures in the classroom or sometimes in the halls.</TE>
<TE>   The Epilepsy Foundation shares my ire. "The incident was
especially hurtful coming from such a popular and respected
personality," said foundation President Eric Hargis. "Rosie probably
never intended her words to have the impact that they did. We doubt
very much she would have made similar comments about other health
problems; she obviously did not realize how serious seizures can be.
But seizures are serious.... We have to make people more aware of
what a seizure involves and how extremely painful jokes about
seizures are to affected families."</TE>
<TE>   The manufacturer of the Baby Go Boom doll didn't think it was
funny either. General Creation officials were insulted that their
product would be mocked that way after they'd made a $20,000 donation
in cash and product to O'Donnell's charity. The corporate office
issued a statement calling the incident unfortunate and expressing
"regret for the sake of all parties that it occurred."</TE>
<TE>   Until recently, "The Rosie O'Donnell Show" aired in late
afternoon, when many children were home from school. I worry about
the ones who saw the program that day. A child will remember that
Rosie joked about the doll that fell down and shook, just like the
little girl or boy down the street who falls down and shakes. If it's
OK for Rosie to mock that behavior, why shouldn't they? A child may
remember that Allen said to stick a pencil in the mouth of someone
having a seizure. I guess anything goes in comedy, even if it is
insensitive to a large population and misinformed.</TE>
<TE>   As someone on the Parents for Parents forum observed, "The only
thing we can do now is thank her [Rosie] for showing so many people
that it is OK to laugh at a seizure, and encouraging the population
that watches her show that it is OK to continue to discriminate
against epileptics."</TE>
<TE>   Thanks, Rosie.</TE>

<CX>   Pencil threat--The Counterpunch article in the Jan. 28 Calendar,
regarding comments made on "The Rosie O'Donnell Show" about seizures,
implied that a person can get lead poisoning from a pencil. In fact,
pencils today are made of graphite, so such poisoning would not be
possible.</CX>

<DH>The founders of a new museum hope to make L.A. architecture
and design accessible to the public.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HUGH HART</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In front of Union Station near the entrance ramp to the northbound
101 Freeway stands a statue of Junipero Serra. The 18th century
Catholic priest oversaw the building of 21 missions in California. He
also is responsible, indirectly, for the massive Cathedral of Our
Lady of the Angels under construction a few blocks away.</LD>
<LD>   How so? Architect Jose Rafael Moneo won the cathedral commission
in 1996 by crafting a "Shrine to Junipero Serra." Santiago Calatrava,
Frank Gehry, Morphosis and Venturi Scott Brown &amp; Associates also
submitted models.</LD>
<LD>   Why was Moneo picked? Answers--or at least the raw evidence--are
on display at a new museum offering big names in a small space: the
A+D Museum of Architecture and Design.</LD>
<TE>   Situated on the ground floor of the historic Bradbury Building
downtown, the A+D Museum has recently unveiled its first exhibition,
"Urban Innovations: Shrine to Junipero Serra." The show, to run
through March 21, will feature models and drawings by the five
finalists, along with writings and photographs documenting the
selection process.</TE>
<TE>   The idea for a permanent exhibition space took root after New
Blood 101, a show featuring the work of 101 young California
architects, drew 3,000 people to the Pacific Design Center two years
ago. The event was one of several organized by Stephen Kanner of
Kanner Architects, architect and USC professor Joe Addo and their
mentor, Bernard Zimmerman, who teaches at Cal Poly Pomona.</TE>
<TE>   "Those exhibitions happened once a year," Kanner said, "whereas
the whole point of this museum is to create an ongoing entity where
the public can be exposed to exhibits, maybe four or five a year.
It's something that doesn't stop and start."</TE>
<TE>   Last summer, the New Blood 101 trio began brainstorming with
Elizabeth Martin, who would become museum director; Anne Marie Burke,
its future director of development; and Los Angeles Conservancy
member John English about the possibility of creating a center
devoted exclusively to architecture and design. Attorney Joe Hart and
Ogilvy &amp; Mathers ad executive Rebeca Mendez later joined this
"founding committee."</TE>
<TE>   Taking as models the Storefront for Art and Architecture in
Manhattan, San Francisco's now-defunct 2AES (Art and Architecture
Exhibition Space) and European design museums in London, Amsterdam
and Basel, Switzerland, the group gradually arrived at a common
vision for a modestly scaled center focusing on local artists and
design projects.</TE>
<TE>   Concepts aside, the most important questions from a practical
standpoint--where would the museum be situated and how would it be
paid for--suddenly became nonissues when real estate developer Ira
Yellin offered to house the A+D Museum, rent-free, in his Bradbury
Building.</TE>
<TE>   "When Ira heard the words 'architecture' and 'museum' in the same
sentence, he said, 'Joe, you can have the space.' To not worry about
rent for a while--that's a major plus," Addo said.</TE>
<TE>   Also pitching in are downtown artisans and merchants who've
donated services to augment the museum's privately donated $30,000
start-up fund. (Currently under the auspices of the Architectural
Foundation of Los Angeles, the museum has filed for nonprofit
status.)</TE>
<TE>   "In the past, when you talked about starting a museum, people
often thought in grandiose terms," Addo said. "We decided, instead of
looking for that million-dollar check, we'd think in terms of finding
like-minded people and $1,500 donations and goodwill. This is being
done from the bottom up, rather than top down."</TE>
<TE>   Kanner, a director of the local chapter of the American Institute
of Architects, says the A+D Museum's sidewalk-friendly location suits
one of his goals. The association "really wants to bring architecture
into the public realm, to make it less a body of professionals who
are untouchable and more a group that's really connected to the
public," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "The museum," he said, "is not just about models and sketches, but
[about] taking people through the process. Like Joe said, it's not a
museum with a capital M; it's more grass-roots, more humble."</TE>
<TE>   Humble, maybe, but good connections have enabled the founders to
call in some high-profile favors. To round up work by the big-name
architects for the inaugural exhibition, Kanner said, his friend
Zimmerman had "immediate access to Frank Gehry and Thom Mayne [of
Morphosis]. Other members of the committee reached out to [Robert]
Venturi and [Fernando] Romero. Everybody has their points of
contact."</TE>
<TE>   Picturing a Cathedral as Butterfly or Tree</TE>
<TE>   Before the opening, Martin and Burke were still awaiting materials
for the debut show and could only visualize what the exhibit would
look like, as carpenters and painters applied finishing touches to
the 2,000-square-foot gallery.</TE>
<TE>   Retiring to a cafe at the nearby Grand Central Market, Martin, an
architect, curator and consultant who has organized programs at
UCLA's Hammer Museum and other venues, described the cathedral
"sketch exercise." "What they had in mind was," she said, "you take
the essence of a cathedral and you create a sacred space that
embodies all of these concepts."</TE>
<TE>   For example, she said, "Santiago Calatrava's model is like a
butterfly, in that it has this beamed roof system." Burke, an
architect with Pugh-Scarpa who directed special projects for UCLA's
department of architecture and urban design, added, "Santiago
conceptualized it as if they were palm fronds that would open up and
allow the light to filter into the space. Venturi designed his model
around a cloverleaf pattern because he said Los Angeles is a city of
highways."</TE>
<TE>   The museum's second exhibition, "Urban Innovations: L.A.
Competitions" (April 14 through June 6), will feature municipal
project designs, including work submitted for the federal courthouse
in Los Angeles. Also on display will be models by architects in the
competition for the California Department of Transportation's new
L.A. building, including work by Dutch architect Rem Koolhaas, who
was recently named to redesign the Los Angeles County Museum of Art,
and by Mayne, the winner of the Caltrans project.</TE>
<TE>   "Los Angeles has always been known more from a residential object
point of view," Martin said, mentioning Los Angeles architects
Richard Neutra, R.M. Schindler and Charles and Ray Eames, best known
for private home designs.</TE>
<TE>   "Los Angeles has been in this adolescent phase for a very long
time, but now our city is entering adulthood because now we're
starting to build a lot of civic buildings and institutional
buildings. We wanted to capture this moment."</TE>
<TE>   For "Urban Innovations: Next Phase: 2x7" (June 20 through Aug.
31), 14 students--two from each of the region's seven architecture
and design schools--will have a chance to demonstrate their ingenuity
through exhibits they'll create in the gallery space. "It's important
to not just show the Frank Gehrys who are at the top of their game
but also to bring in the new blood," Martin said. "We're making a
statement that as a museum, we want a diversity of voices."</TE>
<TE>   This initial series highlights architecture, but the museum will
eventually make good on the other half of its name, Kanner said.
"Including design in the title opens it up to even a broader
spectrum--landscape architecture, product design. The purpose is to
explore many specialties and architecture."</TE>
<TE>   Referring to his recent visit to the new Manhattan boutique
designed by Koolhaas, Kanner said, "I was just at the Prada show in
New York, which is about technology, graphics, fashion. In a way, the
more we move into the future, the more these disciplines are
merging."</TE>

<HD>From an Unlikely Locale, Fiery Brazilian Music</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>DON HECKMAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ordinarily, Minneapolis might not seem a logical home base for a
Brazilian jazz group. But then there was a time--in the pre-Prince
era--when it didn't exactly seem to be a center for innovative rock
music, either. And we all know how wrong that perception turned out
to be.</LD>
<LD>   So it probably shouldn't have been a surprise when the
Minneapolis-based Estaire Godinez ensemble that turned up at La Ve
Lee Friday and Saturday nights was such a first-rate band, their
performance heating up the connections between jazz and a variety of
Latin rhythms.</LD>
<LD>   If the name Estaire Godinez doesn't ring a bell, don't worry;
you'll be hearing much more from this talented singer-percussionist.
Although she was born in Oakland, Godinez, who is fluent in Spanish
and Portuguese, spent 15 years living in Spain and the Netherlands,
soaking up all sorts of world music sounds.</LD>
<TE>   She appeared in the Southland recently backing up George Benson,
but her La Ve Lee performance--with guitarist Mike Scott, tenor
saxophonist Eric Leeds, keyboardist Peter Schimke, drummer Stokely
Williams and bassist Serge Akou--was all her own.</TE>
<TE>   The blond, slender Godinez was seated front and center in the
club's compact stage area, her hands moving in arcs of choreographic
ease across a circle of conga drums, bongos, timbales, cymbals and a
seemingly endless array of hand percussion and sound makers.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the tunes featured her sensuous, smoky vocals, floating
through subtle waves of rhythm with special effectiveness on "Garota
de Ipanema," "All or Nothing at All" and "Besame Mucho."</TE>
<TE>   The vocals, however, were only one aspect of Godinez's skill and,
for that matter, of her ensemble's musical strengths. On piece after
piece, the creative energy level was at peak production: fiery
soloing from Schimke and Scott, in particular, with Leeds often
linking up with Godinez's wordless melody lines.</TE>
<TE>   The weather may be chilly in Minneapolis, but it hasn't diminished
the capacity of Godinez or her players to raise the jazz temperature
to steamy levels.</TE>

<HD>Fiery Conversion to Rock</HD>
<DH>Pedal steel guitar wiz Robert Randolph has taken his gospel
out of the church and into concert halls.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE HOCHMAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Cody Dickinson, drummer of the band the Word, turns to pedal steel
guitarist Robert Randolph as they sit on a sofa in the House of Blues
dressing room before their concert on Friday.</LD>
<LD>   "Tell him about the deal you made in Mississippi," Dickinson says
to his cohort.</LD>
<LD>   "The deal?" asks Randolph, casually strumming an acoustic guitar.</LD>
<TE>   "You know, you went to the crossroads .... "</TE>
<TE>   "Oh right," says Randolph, remembering the legend of blues singer
Robert Johnson's selling his soul to the devil in exchange for his
musical gift. The two laugh. Randolph may play the pedal steel guitar
as if he's possessed, but the covenant tied to his extraordinary
abilities comes from above, not below.</TE>
<TE>   Randolph, 24, is a prodigy of the "sacred steel" genre of gospel
music, which has thrived in a network of African American Pentecostal
churches. As early as the 1930s, steel guitars were employed in the
place of costly organs. Though normally associated with country
music, the instrument proved the perfect vehicle for the ecstatic
praise of the preachers and congregations.</TE>
<TE>   Until about a year ago, Randolph, whose father is a deacon and
mother a minister at the House of God in Orange, N.J., had only
played in church-related settings.</TE>
<TE>   Now, though, he's brought the exhilarating rush of his music into
the rock arena. In addition to his church duties, Randolph's been
fronting what amounts to a gospel-themed jam band combining the
young, Delta-rooted North Mississippi Allstars (Dickinson, his
brother Luther on guitar and bassist Chris Chew) and progressive jazz
organist John Medeski (of Medeski, Martin &amp; Wood).</TE>
<TE>   As the Word, they recently released a terrific instrumental album
and have been playing some shows in between their respective main
gigs.</TE>
<TE>   With the Word and with his own group, Robert Randolph and the
Family Band, the steel guitarist has been generating a different kind
of ecstatic praise, picking up comparisons to Stevie Ray Vaughan,
Duane Allman and even Jimi Hendrix.</TE>
<TE>   On stage at the House of Blues in West Hollywood Friday, it was a
stunning display all around. Randolph has no difficulty adapting his
playing to a non-church setting, while the other musicians have
gained a solid feeling for the gospel styles. The North Mississippi
Allstars already had established themselves as one of the best
entries on the jam circuit, thanks to their informed and honest blues
roots (they hail from the birthplace of the blues, and the Dickinsons
are sons of rock and blues producer-musician Jim Dickinson). With the
Word, the depth of expression has increased, as traditional songs ("I
Shall Not Be Moved," "At the Cross") and a few originals were taken
on extended flights of fancy.</TE>
<TE>   Luther Dickinson, already a guitarist of skill and feeling, has
obviously learned a lot from Randolph and put it to good use in
fluid, stinging solos that often recall Allman but take on a distinct
character. Medeski, an innovative force with his popular trio, has
also found the gospel form a fruitful foundation for his imaginative,
percussive organ playing. And Cody Dickinson and Chew provided
booming, churning rhythms that had the muscular surety required for
great gospel and the limberness that elevates a jam band beyond mere
noodling.</TE>
<TE>   But the star was unquestionably Randolph, a naturally hammy
entertainer who employed just about every trick in the pedal steel
book (and a bunch of his own) to make his strings sing, shout, squeal
and sigh.</TE>
<TE>   He's also taken a lot of Allman's melodic instincts, as well as
Vaughan's sizzle, though he never really sounds like anyone else.</TE>
<TE>   The Allstars and Medeski had separately discovered sacred steel
music via a series of albums showcasing such acts as Aubrey Ghent,
Glenn Lee and the Campbell Brothers, released over the past four
years by Arhoolie Records, a small Bay Area label specializing in
blues and folk music. The young musicians eventually started talking
about teaming for a project based on the style. Around the same time,
the Allstars were given a recording of Randolph by a friend.</TE>
<TE>   "It was the first song on the 'Sacred Steel Live' CD, and it was
amazing," says Luther Dickinson, in the dressing room before the
show.</TE>
<TE>   "We had a show coming up in New York City and said, 'Hey, this guy
is in New Jersey. See if he can open for us.'" That date at the
Bowery Ballroom was Randolph's first outside of a church context.
Soon he was invited to anchor the Word, and he found himself more and
more in the world of rock, which took a little adjustment, but not a
lot.</TE>
<TE>   "He used to only wear his altar boy outfit," jokes Medeski, as
Randolph rolls his eyes.</TE>
<TE>   Randolph says, though, that some church members did question the
move--not on religious grounds, but on the interest a secular
audience would have in gospel sounds.</TE>
<TE>   "I get from church people, 'The white people like that?'" he says.
"I told them, 'You gotta see it--they go crazy just like us! They're
clapping on the wrong beats, though.'"</TE>
<TE>   Friday's crowd mostly got the beats right, and certainly got the
spirit.</TE>
<TE>   And when the group closed its breathless two hours on stage with a
version of Hendrix's "Voodoo Chile," the worlds of the House of Blues
and the House of God had merged in mutual glory.</TE>

<HD>'Othello,' With a Twist of Time</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>"Masterpiece Theatre," which got famous last century as a PBS series
to enjoy with a teacup on your knee, is having its strongest,
grittiest January in some time, thanks to an inspired decision to air
on consecutive Mondays a pair of contemporary British dramas linked
by depictions of racism.</LD>
<LD>   They're a fitting prologue to February's Black History Month.</LD>
<LD>   Last week's "The Murder of Stephen Lawrence" was one of the
brawniest, most arresting works to appear on U.S. television this
season, acquainting viewers on this side of the Atlantic with an
actual 1993 case in which a black teenager in London was slain by
racist white thugs who remain free.</LD>
<TE>   And arriving tonight is "Othello." No, not that "Othello," but
Andrew Davies' plain-speaking adaptation that reconstitutes the famed
Moor of Venice as John Othello, first black commissioner of the
London Metropolitan Police, who murders his wife, Dessie, in a
jealous rage after his mind is poisoned by his scheming subordinate,
Ben Jago.</TE>
<TE>   This updated Shakespeare tragedy has problems but still delivers
an energized two hours.</TE>
<TE>   "Masterpiece Theatre" traditionally avoids risky hairpin curves,
through the years seeing itself mostly as U.S. television's stiff
upper lip and elegant annex of the United Kingdom.</TE>
<TE>   That makes its embrace of "The Murder of Stephen Lawrence" all the
more striking. Here was a true-life story re-created so persuasively
in raw, grainy documentary style that viewers tuning in late might
have thought they were watching reality instead of Marianne
Jean-Baptiste, Hugh Quarshie and other skilled actors speaking lines
from a script.</TE>
<TE>   Stephen was fatally stabbed while waiting for a bus with a black
friend in a shocking murder that made headlines and whipped up racial
tensions in the U.K. for years. Police were accused of bungling the
case by making no arrests in the critical first two weeks, thereby
giving the suspects, whose names they had, time to destroy evidence,
create alibis and intimidate potential witnesses.</TE>
<TE>   The universal theme here is prejudice. Although Stephen was an
innocent victim who had hoped to become an architect, he was
initially thought by investigating police to be a thug himself, his
mother (Jean-Baptiste) claimed in the TV account. "He was a black,"
she said bitterly, "so he must be a criminal."</TE>
<TE>   This racial profiling theme--a volatile issue in the U.S. as well,
most notably after Sept. 11--extends also to tonight's "Othello,"
which Davies says he wrote with the Lawrence case in mind.</TE>
<TE>   It opens with director Geoffrey Saxe's expertly staged street
clashes between police and blacks who charge that officers murdered
an unarmed black suspect who died in their custody. It turns out
they're right. Labeled guilty because of his skin color, he was
dragged from his house by white cops and savagely beaten to death
during an ensuing struggle.</TE>
<TE>   And so it is, in a move to assuage black critics of the
department, that Othello (Eamonn Walker), is named police
commissioner, promoted over his best friend and confidante, assistant
commissioner Jago (Christopher Eccleston). The spurned Jago accepts
the news graciously to Othello's face, then explodes, storming down a
hallway shouting again and again: "Shoulda been me!"</TE>
<TE>   Hence, the strong motivation to take Othello down, more apparent
here than in Iago's obsession with undermining the Moor.</TE>
<TE>   Walker's Othello is sleek and seething, a tinderbox awaiting a
match, and Keeley Hawes is a fine Dessie, so lovely that her
infatuated husband can't divert his eyes from her face even as she
sleeps. Eccleston, however, guns his motor too much when switching to
smarmy scoundrel mode, keeping too little hidden.</TE>
<TE>   Obviously, this is not "Othello" as originally written. What a
difference four centuries make.</TE>
<TE>   Not battlements, but a glass-walled high rise. Not Shakespeare's
verse, but dialogue screaming 2002 ("From now on, zero tolerance of
racism," newly installed commissioner Othello informs his men). Not a
handkerchief that seems to incriminate Othello's wife, but a silk
robe, and of all things, DNA.</TE>
<TE>   Instead of Iago, it's Jago. Instead of serene Desdemona, it's
feistier Dessie, who keeps her rich daddy but is now a journalist.
Instead of Iago's wife, Emilia, it's his girlfriend, and Dessie's
loyal friend, Lulu (Rachael Stirling). Instead of Cassio, it's
policeman Michael Cass (Richard Coyle), the guileless hunk set up by
Jago to be Othello's foil when he wrongly judges his wife guilty of
adultery. Instead of Roderigo, it's Alan Roderick (Del Synnott), a
white cop implicated in the black suspect's murder.</TE>
<TE>   And not Shakespeare, of course, but Davies, a very talented
scenarist whose outstanding British TV credits range from "House of
Cards" and "Mother Love" to "A Rather English Marriage" and "Take a
Girl Like You."</TE>
<TE>   As he did the villainous Francis Urquhart in "House of Cards,"
Davies has Jago copy Richard III and speak directly to the audience
with dark wit, sharing his deceit with these outsiders. Noting his
success in baiting a trap for Othello, he tells the camera smugly:
"How easily he slides into it."</TE>
<TE>   Too easily, in fact.</TE>
<TE>   Ah, there's the rub, for in stripping back so much of the original
story--its characters, rhythms and prose--Davies so severely alters
the context of "Othello" that it narrows here into something of a
standard cop movie. Which would be fine. Except viewing it that way,
one can't believe that this tough urban cop, Othello, could be this
gullible and manipulated like a puppet on a string by so transparent
a villain.</TE>
<TE>   Racial politics notwithstanding, so much for zero tolerance.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "Othello" will be shown tonight at 9 on KCET. The network has
rated it TV-14-LSV (may be unsuitable for children under 14, with
special advisories for coarse language, sexuality and violence).</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>

<HD>Berry Taps Into an Ageless Joy</HD>
<DH>At 75, the veteran rocker thoroughly enjoys himself
onstage--and says he's still learning. 'Anybody would understand it's
fun,' he says.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RANDY LEWIS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Nobody batted an eye four decades ago when Mick Jagger suggested how
silly it would be for him to still be singing odes to teen lust once
he'd turned 50. His comment conjured what seemed, back then, a
preposterous image of middle-aged men practicing what was created as
a young man's art.</LD>
<LD>   So how on earth did Chuck Berry, who turned 75 last October ,
manage to look and sound so gloriously ageless Saturday at the
Universal Amphitheatre as he sang about "Sweet Little Sixteen" and
ordered Beethoven to roll over once more?</LD>
<LD>   His co-headliner, Little Richard, couldn't do it even though he's
six years Berry's junior. Rock's original wild man appeared game but
huffed and puffed his way through a set that only intermittently
transcended rote nostalgia, then left the building immediately,
scotching the scheduled musical meeting of two of rock's founding
fathers.</LD>
<TE>   Berry, on the other hand, was so full of vitality you wanted to
X-ray that old Gibson guitar of his to find the flask he must have
filled at the fountain of youth.</TE>
<TE>   The spirit, spontaneity and energy rock's first poet put into his
hourlong set was all the more remarkable in light of decades of
half-hearted performances in which he typically battled rather than
meshed with unrehearsed musicians hired for him in each town.</TE>
<TE>   At Universal he was backed by a lively trio consisting of fellow
St. Louis musician Jim Marsala on bass, who has accompanied Berry off
and on for four decades, plus pianist Michael Clark and drummer Kirk
Arthur, both of whom have played with him regularly for some 13
years.</TE>
<TE>   Evidently the monthly club gigs he's been doing back in St. Louis
for the last five years have reminded him that it takes a real band
to really rock. It also seems to have rekindled his passion for
honest expression in concert as well as his respect for his audience
and his own legacy.</TE>
<TE>   "It must still be fun, because I don't have to hit a lick
anymore," Berry acknowledged during an interview Thursday in his
dressing room at "The Tonight Show With Jay Leno" before a joint
appearance that night with Richard. The implication was that fans
will cheer this first-round Rock and Roll Hall of Famer no matter
what he does, or doesn't do, on stage at this point in his career.</TE>
<TE>   "What keeps me going is the fact that I appreciate that response,"
Berry added. "Plus I'm still learning, and that's a big part of my
life--to learn. These guitar strokes I'm learning, still
learning--yes, it's fun. Anybody would understand it's fun." So much
fun, in fact, that Berry swears 2002 will be the year he puts out an
album of new material he's been talking about for the better part of
Britney Spears' lifetime.</TE>
<TE>   He also clearly still has fun with playing with words, something
that sets his richly detailed songs apart from often generic
declarations of love and longing common during rock's embryonic
stage. That unyielding desire for the specific came out in the
interview, when he was briefly stumped upon being asked whether it's
harder to keep performing long after most of his contemporaries have
retired or died.</TE>
<TE>   "Break down 'harder' for me," he said, with one of many laughs
that also contradicted his reputation as a man who endures interviews
as if at gunpoint.</TE>
<TE>   Restated to ask if he found performing more taxing, more tiring or
as much fun as when he was helping define the archetype of the
electric guitar-wielding songwriter-performer in the mid-'50s, Berry
relaxed and answered.</TE>
<TE>   "Yes, it's more tiring, but since I don't do it as much as I used
to, it's not really that much more taxing. See why I couldn't answer
the question before?"</TE>
<TE>   He sighs, then adds, "Ahh, I should have been a son of Einstein,"
slyly rolling his eyes at his canny syntactic analysis.</TE>
<TE>   Einstein's name surfaces again later when Berry outlined the
philosophy that, despite his three prison terms and various personal
and professional quagmires, may have saved him from reaching the
point of no return on the road to self-destruction like so many other
rockers.</TE>
<TE>   "One of my realizations is that if you revel over joy," he says,
"you're going to ache over pain and get killed over hurt. Your span
of feelings are going to go just as far one way as the other. So when
something real good comes to you, take it and chew on it.... Then
when something bitter gets in there, you won't feel too bad chewing
it and smiling, because the other one wasn't that good, so this won't
be that bad.... That's mathematical, and I think Einstein would have
agreed with that."</TE>
<TE>   Few could argue that while much of the repertoire created during
rock's infancy can sound dated or corny, Berry's canon holds up
magnificently. That's due in large part to the fact that he wrote
from the perspective of an observer rather than a participant, and a
gifted storyteller never gets old or goes out of fashion.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Berry says he's long past discussing hotrods and teenage
romance. "Now I'm writing about the life I'm living, and the life my
generation is living--and the generation right behind me is close to
[that life], so they can look forward to it." He quickly reels off a
couplet from one new song, "A builder built a temple/He wrought it
with grace and skill," noting, "Now that has nothing to do with 'Come
back, baby.'"</TE>
<TE>   It's anybody's guess how Elvis would come off issuing warnings
about his blue suede shoes as he reached Social Security age, but on
Saturday Berry went beyond merely credible. He tapped in-the-moment
joy singing of the "rolling arthritis sitting down by the rhythm
revue" in "Roll Over Beethoven" all these years later.</TE>
<TE>   "Years?" he said during the interview. "I got news for you--so far
it's life. Elvis' songs will always be there, and I hope mine will be
after I'm gone.</TE>
<TE>   "But," he interjected with a twinkle in those 75-year-old eyes,
"you can't compare that, because he's gone, and I'm not!"</TE>

<HD>SAG Awards Are Oscars' Crystal Ball</HD>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Want to find a genuinely reliable prognosticator of this year's
Academy Awards for best actor and actress? Then pay attention to the
Screen Actors Guild Awards.</LD>
<LD>   On Tuesday at 6:40 a.m., actress Marisa Tomei of "In the Bedroom"
and Ted Danson of the TV sitcom "Becker" will join SAG President
Melissa Gilbert at the Pacific Design Center's SilverScreen Theatre
to announce the eighth annual SAG nominations in film and TV. Winners
will be selected by the guild's 98,000 members.</LD>
<LD>   For the last seven years, the SAG Awards have proved an uncannily
accurate barometer of what to expect when the Oscars roll around, at
least in the acting categories.</LD>
<TE>   How accurate? Well, in six of the last seven years, the SAG
statuettes have gone to actors who went on to win the Academy Award.
Only Russell Crowe, who won the Oscar last year for "Gladiator," did
not capture a SAG Award the same year--although SAG's best actor,
Benecio del Toro in "Traffic," did win best supporting actor at the
Academy Awards.</TE>
<TE>   In the leading actress category, SAG twice failed to foreshadow
the Oscar winner: when Jodie Foster won the SAG Award for "Nell," and
Jessica Lange went on to win the Academy Award for "Blue Sky," and
when Annette Bening took the SAG honor for "American Beauty," only to
see Hilary Swank get the Oscar for "Boys Don't Cry."</TE>
<TE>   Executive producer Jeff Margolis, who is overseeing his fourth SAG
Awards telecast, said actors take the awards seriously because they
are conveyed by their peers. The show will be broadcast March 10 on
TNT from the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles.</TE>

<HD>Pelletier Channels His Energy</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LEWIS SEGAL</AU>
<BD>TIMES DANCE CRITIC</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Twenty-year-old Brian Pelletier dances with the intensity of mortal
combat; the nonstop kicking, lunging, twisting and falling in his
solos give them a kinetic impact that no mere steps can generate.</LD>
<LD>   Whenever the seven women in his DanceLA company came close to
matching his sharpness of attack and full-out commitment, their
hourlong "Domestika" had startling force in its premiere at the L.A.
Theatre Center on Friday.</LD>
<LD>   Using recordings by Icelandic pop diva Bjork, Pelletier succeeded
in creating a modern dance style rich in assaultive energy but with
no lack of variety or depth.</LD>
<TE>   The result, however, suffered from several major miscalculations.
"Domestika" began strongly by tapping the alienation and anguish of
Bjork's songs through tense, contorted stances released into eerie
gestural statements and a sustained frenzy.</TE>
<TE>   Pelletier's dancing made these sections indelible, but as the work
evolved into a love triangle, his role softened into that of a
supportive partner for Sarah Sydney Jenkins and Jessica Schatz.</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately, their solos (which they choreographed themselves)
had no edge, merely conventional ideas and issues executed with
diligence.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, the narrative connection between Schatz's broken-hearted
"Harm of Will" solo and the upbeat "Unison" finale (with Pelletier
snuggling a whole harem) had to be taken on faith.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe that's the point--that happy endings are arbitrary
resolutions that nobody can predict, and all we can do is long for
them. (The ending of Pelletier's "61 Minutes of Misguided Vision"
last year also came out of nowhere.)</TE>
<TE>   Still, DanceLA proved far more persuasive when defining
overwhelming pain as a basic human condition than when trying to
interest us in the dilemma of a skinny, hyperactive youth torn
between a blond and a redhead--or that of a skinny, hyperactive
choreographer trying to finish as impressively as he started.</TE>

<HD>Perspectives on 'Making It' in America</HD>
<DH>Opinions on the topic are served at a Manhattan restaurant
in a scattered, static play by Joe Hortua, at South Coast Repertory.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DON SHIRLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES THEATER WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Joe Hortua's "Making It" is set in a Manhattan restaurant with
upscale aspirations. The only strong opinion a customer has about the
food is that it's bland.</LD>
<LD>   Likewise, Hortua's play--despite its upscale production at South
Coast Repertory--needs fresher, more complementary ingredients, or at
least a dash of something to eliminate the feeling that this play was
assembled from a recipe.</LD>
<LD>   As it is, the recipe goes like this:</LD>
<TE>   Take two immigrant busboys--one (Dileep Rao) who's sweet on
America, the other one (Assaf Cohen) bitter. Set them aside on one
end of the stage.</TE>
<TE>   At the other end of the stage, plant one middle-aged, boozy
restaurant owner (Jennifer Griffin), whose funk apparently stems from
the fact that she gave up acting to own a swank eatery. Stir in a
new, young waiter (Heath Freeman), an otherwise starving actor. Note
irony.</TE>
<TE>   In the center of the stage, at the restaurant's only visible
table, park a young engaged couple. He (JD Cullum) is the talker, she
(Laura Hinsberger) is the listener, even though they're celebrating
her birthday. After an hour or so, add his middle-aged, playwriting
mentor (Nicholas Hormann), the source of many of the young man's
current complaints.</TE>
<TE>   Occasionally stir elements of these three sets of ingredients only
inconsequentially, but keep all of them on stage--with two of the
three arenas in shadow at any given time, while the lights are up on
the third.</TE>
<TE>   The result is a play that feels half-baked.</TE>
<TE>   Hortua intends to offer a spectrum of opinions on the subject of
"making it" in today's America, but his characters are stereotyped
mouthpieces for varying perspectives. The busboys, in particular, are
so generic in their assigned attitudes that we never learn where they
emigrated from. They are programmed so schematically that the play
begins and ends with the same line, "This is America, my
friend"--spoken at the beginning by the one who's happy with America
and at the end by the other one, who has just described his initial
glimpse of poverty in the Bronx. This sequence of viewpoints seems
designed to convince a complacent, middle-class audience that America
has problems after all--in other words, it feels patronizing as well
as shallow.</TE>
<TE>   The relationship between the restaurant owner and her new waiter
is slightly more substantial, in that an unspoken element is at work
here--she's attracted to him, which complicates the dynamic between
boss and employee. But these two characters are hardly more
distinctive than the busboys. Is there a more common cliche than the
waiter who really wants to act? Hortua hasn't filled in any further
details. As far as the owner goes, she tells an implausible story
about why she left acting, and her eventual rise to her current
status remains unexplained. The idea that someone might actually
enjoy running a restaurant instead of acting is never seriously
entertained.</TE>
<TE>   The writing of the trio of diners appears to be designed to make
us loathe the young man and his mentor, who are stand-ins for their
respective generations at their worst. But the nature of their
relationship is as vague as the nationalities of the busboys. The
young woman emerges as the wise one in this group, but it's unclear
why someone so wise would ever go on a second date with the annoying
young man, let alone marry him.</TE>
<TE>   The play feels scattered and yet static. Despite its many
narrative strands, the hustle and bustle of a Manhattan restaurant is
missing--in contrast to the recent "Fully Committed," which had only
one actor, compared to this play's seven. Constrained by the decision
to keep all seven on stage, even when they're in the shadows,
director David Emmes hasn't found this play's pulse.</TE>

<HD>Early Shostakovich: A Rebellious Spirit</HD>
<DH>The Philharmonic revisits a bold, young composer in the
days before the communist experiment turned around and quashed him.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARK SWED</AU>
<BD>TIMES MUSIC CRITIC</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Things," Esa-Pekka Salonen told the Los Angeles Philharmonic
audience Friday night, "are exactly what they seem." He was speaking
about a highly unusual situation in Shostakovich's music--which is
more often noted for its onion-like layers of irony--as he introduced
the Russian composer's Second and Third symphonies.</LD>
<LD>   Shostakovich was in his early 20s when he wrote these symphonies
in 1927 and 1929.</LD>
<LD>   The Russian Revolution only a decade old, there was still raucous
optimism in the air for the communist experiment. Artists, not yet
suppressed, were urged to experiment, to be bold and unpredictable.</LD>
<TE>   Shostakovich's Second and Third symphonies were expressions of
those times and the ideals of a glorious workers' state, not the
anguished, sarcastic, bitter squirming of the composer later
tormented by Stalin. They are, as Salonen put it, "pretty wild
stuff."</TE>
<TE>   Each symphony is a single-movement tone poem honoring the Soviet
state, and each ends with a choral paean.</TE>
<TE>   Symphony No. 2 ("To October"), which commemorates the 10th
anniversary of the October Revolution, begins with the chaos of
oppressed workers. An "anti-fugue" of 13 unrelated individual parts
shows the dissonance that results when each man acts for himself. But
the workers of the world unite, an invigorating factory whistle blows
away exploitation, and the chorus glorifies "October, the Commune and
Lenin."</TE>
<TE>   The Third Symphony ("The First of May") reflects the Soviets' May
Day celebrations--the blossoming of a new season, the reawakening of
a new vision for the people. It is a rush of images reminiscent of
the experimental Soviet films, with their visual collages. Pastoral
scenes, marching bands and dreamy lyricism paint the ideal state.
Singing pat, patriotic texts, the chorus resounds to the dawn of a
new day, to the banners rising in the sun and a million May Day
marching feet.</TE>
<TE>   No irony? Maybe not in the music. But to sit in the Dorothy
Chandler Pavilion in 2002 and listen to these two rarely played
symphonies proved an experience absolutely drenched in postmodern
irony.</TE>
<TE>   The crowd, Friday night, was extraordinary. The Philharmonic has
made an effort to reach out into the community, and it seems to be
succeeding. No longer are the orchestra seats in the Pavilion the
exclusive realm of older, well-to-do whites. I was surrounded by
groups of Asian listeners, by African American couples, by Latino
families. Here one saw young couples on dates, there well-behaved
children. It was an all-Russian program, and the sound of spoken
Russian could be heard all over the lobby from emigres.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, this was an audience that enjoyed itself. Attentive
listeners applauded enthusiastically, standing in happy ovation after
each symphony. Yet cheers for music that extols Lenin, Stalin and the
Russian Revolution inevitably feel unsettling--as if the Enron
collapse could suddenly sour the entire Philharmonic audience on
capitalism.</TE>
<TE>   Most likely, those cheers were simply the reaction of listeners to
exciting performances of uplifting and bold music, but that revealed
another irony--the universal sentiments of these Stalinist scores
would soon enough be crushed by the villainous dictator himself.</TE>
<TE>   Such irony was certainly not lost on Shostakovich. From the
beginning, he hated the crass nationalistic poetry he was forced to
set, and in his later years, he pretty much disowned these two
symphonies.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Friday night there was no discounting the sheer freshness
of invention, the sense that here was a young composer of boundless
talent beginning to stretch his compositional muscles. And that is
exactly what Salonen, for the second installment of his five-year
Shostakovich cycle of the 15 Shostakovich symphonies, emphasized.
This is music of quick wit, of brilliant color, rhythmic animation,
dramatic surprise--all also qualities of Salonen's musical
personality.</TE>
<TE>   The Philharmonic playing was electric, its responses
lightning-fast. The Los Angeles Master Chorale sang with joyful
fervor.</TE>
<TE>   As an odd contrast, each symphony was preceded by more
conventional Russian music. But in both the Polovtsian Dances from
Borodin's "Prince Igor" and Anatoly Liadov's short, luminous tone
poem, "The Enchanted Lake," Salonen brought out the color and sparkle
in these scores, demonstrating not only what Shostakovich was
rebelling against but how much he was also indebted to Russian
tradition.</TE>
<TE>   Revolution in Russian music, as in Russian life, was never a
complete rebellion, which was but one more irony to add to this
engagingly perplexing evening.</TE>

<HD>Kung Foolishness in Mindless 'Enter the Fist'</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>KEVIN THOMAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In 1966 Woody Allen launched his filmmaking career by taking a
cut-rate, straight-faced 1964 Japanese James Bond knockoff called
"Key of Keys," erased the sound and music tracks, replacing it with
his own uproarious dialogue and got the Lovin' Spoonful to compose a
groovy score. When American International Pictures released it as
"What's Up, Tiger Lily?," Allen was on his way.</LD>
<LD>   It's lucky that actor-producer-writer-director Steve Oedekerk had
"Ace Ventura: When Nature Calls," "The Nutty Professor" and other
hits under his black belt before he decided to turn the 1976
chop-socker "Tiger &amp; Crane Fists" into "Kung Pow: Enter the Fist,"
which 20th Century Fox wisely opened last Friday without advance
screenings for the press. Like Allen, Oedekerk erased the dialogue of
the old film, but he also shot lots of well-matched inserts on rural
Mexican locations and even had himself digitally incorporated into
the film as its star.</LD>
<LD>   This reworking was infinitely more elaborate and costly than
Allen's venture, but the result is hopelessly inane, humorless and
under-inspired. Small children might be amused by some of the kung
foolishness, but the martial arts genre violence that goes with it is
wholly inappropriate for youngsters.</LD>
<TE>   In essence "Kung Pow" is a typical tale of karate vengeance. The
Chosen One (Oedekerk), even as an infant is a kung fu wiz but this
was not enough to save the lives of his parents, slaughtered by the
villainous Master Pain (Lung Fai). For obscure reasons, Master Pain
is better known as Betty, who enjoys the protection of a vaguely
defined outfit called the Evil Council, which apparently holes itself
up in an array of floating pyramids.</TE>
<TE>   The Chosen One, raised by rodents, inexplicably grows up to be a
white man whose tongue has a life of its own, so to speak, for its
tip has eyes and a mouth, which has its own tongue that can extend
itself so far as to lasso one of those pyramids. Oedekerk has also
inserted a karate-kicking cow, which is not as funny as one might
expect. "Kung Pow: Enter the Fist" ends with a trailer for a
purported sequel. With any luck, it's meant as a joke.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   MPAA rating: PG-13, for comic violence, crude and sexual humor.
Times guidelines: Despite a tongue-in-cheek approach, the film's
mindless martial arts genre violence is too strong for youngsters.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>With Super Bowl week playing into the storied sports fixation of
red-blooded American males, the History Channel answers with what it
calls Boys' Toys week, a five-day homage to the likewise storied link
between guys and gadgetry.</LD>
<LD>   The testosterone-fueled series, "Modern Marvels" (9 p.m.), gets
off the ground tonight with "Private Jets," a diverting, if a bit
overlong, look at luxury air travel for those who feel first-class
just doesn't get it done.</LD>
<LD>   The theme week continues nightly through Friday from 9 to 11, with
one- and two-hour shows delving into such topics as "Million-Dollar
Cars," "Power Tools" and "Remote Control," leaving no stereotype
unexamined.</LD>
<TE>   Colorful billionaire Mark Cuban became poster boy for the "Private
Jets" episode with his $41-million purchase of a Gulfstream V on
EBay, a record for the Internet auction house. And as if that weren't
enough, Cuban then bought another Gulfstream so his Dallas Mavericks
NBA team wouldn't have to cope with the indignities of charter
flights.</TE>
<TE>   This being the History Channel, the program steps back to track
the development of aeronautics from the Wright Brothers forward. It's
a long trip back to present-day issues, such as the safety of
traveling via private jets compared with commercial airlines.</TE>
<TE>   The luxury models' triple-redundancy in its technical systems
guard against even double failures, and the private, highly screened
and trained staffs that service, load and fly the jets offer some
major peace of mind in that regard.</TE>
<TE>   Tantalizingly, the show says "fractional ownership," sort of a
time-share-in-the sky arrangement, now makes private jet travel
affordable even for the common man.</TE>
<TE>   See you on the tarmac.</TE>

<HD>Carpenter and Lamott Find Common Ground in Stories</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARC WEINGARTEN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The pairing of author Anne Lamott and singer-songwriter Mary Chapin
Carpenter at UCLA's Royce Hall on Saturday could have gone any number
of ways.</LD>
<LD>   It could have been benignly quaint and genteel, like something
that Garrison Keillor might feature on his "Prairie Home Companion"
radio show. Or it might have quickly devolved into a mewling
confessional--self-revelation as group therapy. Certainly neither
artist has been immune from flirting with golden-hued sentimentality,
but this wasn't one of those nights.</LD>
<LD>   In what turned out to be an affecting meditation on the affirming
role of emotional faith, Lamott and Carpenter created a dazzling
evening of storytelling that stripped away show-biz artifice and
relied on the enduring power of compelling narrative to hold the
sold-out crowd in its grip.</LD>
<TE>   The pair couldn't have looked more incongruous. Carpenter, with
her straight blond hair and black jeans, came across every inch the
Brown University grad, while Lamott's short dreadlocks and
loose-fitting garb gave her the funky but chic appearance of a
Berkeley food co-op proprietor.</TE>
<TE>   Their art diverges in significant ways, as well. Carpenter's
pop-tinged folk tends to avoid the caustic, hard-edged tone that
Lamott has used so effectively in her novels and nonfiction, but the
two managed to find common ground in material that stressed the
healing properties of fortitude and the hard-won wisdom that can be
wrested from misfortune.</TE>
<TE>   Lamott, who read excerpts from her previous books and an upcoming
novel, told stories about a child's peculiarly endearing love for a
pet iguana; a woman's forbearance when faced with the deteriorating
condition of her mother; and a spouse coming to terms with the death
of her husband by conjuring up rosier memories. Her spare prose,
laced with gallows humor and tender grace notes, made for
satisfyingly compact set pieces.</TE>
<TE>   Carpenter, who was accompanied by her longtime guitarist, John
Jennings, chose material that effectively complemented Lamott's
readings. Such songs as "Simple Gift of Faith" and "The King of
Love," sung in a gorgeous, burnished voice, gave off the same glow of
buoyant optimism as Lamott's stories.</TE>

<HD>Stars Aren't Coming Out for State's GOP Event</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATT MORRISON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>What are we, chopped tofu?</LD>
<LD>   Has California fallen off the Bush White House's map, again?</LD>
<LD>   George W. Bush all but ignored California in the 2000 election,
and he became president without the Golden State, losing California
and its 54 electoral votes by 12 points.</LD>
<TE>   But California is too big even for a president to ignore, so
bygones became bygones, water went under the bridge, and
kiss-and-make-up was the order of the day.</TE>
<TE>   So now what's up with this? The California Republican Party's
convention is in San Jose early next month, but so far the best the
party has been able to tease out of Washington as the star-turn
attraction is (drumroll, please) Dick Armey.</TE>
<TE>   Who? Because memories need more jogging than Bill Clinton, here's
this refresher: Armey is the House majority leader from Texas, who's
bailing out of Congress next year and so ranks more as a warmup act
than a star attraction.</TE>
<TE>   Expectations were that a name Cabinet member or two would be
served up for the convention, to rev up the languishing state GOP for
the big November vote-off. The state party's Web site, last updated
five weeks ago, promises, "We anticipate speakers representing the
Bush administration and the Republican National Committee"--in other
words, TBA.</TE>
<TE>   Endorsement of Jones Comes and Goes</TE>
<TE>   The MAPA flap is still happening.</TE>
<TE>   A handful of weeks ago, Secretary of State Bill Jones, one of the
Big Three GOP candidates for governor, got the endorsement of the
Mexican American Political Assn. in California. He accepted the
endorsement, and thanked the MAPA president, Ben Benavidez.</TE>
<TE>   Still, influence doesn't bespeak coherence. Something messy must
be going on at MAPA, because in a bristling, boldface press release,
MAPA's executive committee has snatched away the Jones endorsement.
It backed Richard Riordan on the GOP side and Gray Davis on the
Democratic side.</TE>
<TE>   Benavidez, the press release declared, "is not the president" but
the head of MAPA's Fresno chapter; "The so-called election of
Benavidez as president in August was never ratified nor sanctioned,"
and for that matter, the board that governed MAPA has canceled those
elections.</TE>
<TE>   It is "unfortunate," the statement concluded, "that Secretary Bill
Jones"--who has been proudly waving the endorsement ever since--"has
now been caught up in the MAPA conundrum."</TE>
<TE>   A Latino by Any Other Name?</TE>
<TE>   What's in a nombre, hombre?</TE>
<TE>   Republican Kenneth M. Fisher is one of two GOP candidates
challenging Rep. Loretta Sanchez, the Garden Grove Democrat.</TE>
<TE>   But you'll have to look for him on the ballot by a name he didn't
use the other times he's run for office: Kenneth M. Valenzuela
Fisher.</TE>
<TE>   Could it be that Fisher, a former member of the county's
Republican Central Committee, has become mindful of the Latino voting
numbers in the district . . . and of the fact that his challenger is
named Joe Chavez of Santa Ana?</TE>
<TE>   Fisher ran for the Anaheim Union High School District in 1992
using his full middle name, Kenneth Manuel Fisher. He lost. This
time, Manuel is demoted to M. and he's using his mother's maiden
name, Valenzuela. Anaheim is a town founded by Germans and now
densely populated by Latinos; Fisher says he is German and Latino.</TE>
<TE>   The Democratic incumbent, Loretta Sanchez, was savaged in the 1996
election, accused of pandering to Latinos by using not her husband's
surname, Brixey, but her own, Sanchez.</TE>
<TE>   Of Fisher's challenge, she says, with tongue fixed somewhere
between upper and lower molars, "I think it's wonderful that more
Hispanics are getting involved in politics."</TE>
<TE>   Awash in Images of Drunken Sailors</TE>
<TE>   The California Democratic Party's Master of Outrage, Bob
Mulholland, was outraged anew. Republican top brass-man Jim Brulte,
the Rancho Cucamonga state senator, was quoted as saying that the
state's Democratic leaders have "been spending like drunken sailors."
Mulholland faxed Brulte and everybody else in soundbite dudgeon about
"our sailors risking their lives . . . in the Afghanistan theater,"
and demanded an apology. He signed himself as a Vietnam vet and a
101st Airborne guy.</TE>
<TE>   But ahoy there--a survey of the state's newspaper files shows that
drunken sailors have staggered across the Capitol poop-deck for a
long while now.</TE>
<TE>   September 1993: Bill Lockyer, then a state senator, reproaches
Republican colleagues for a billion-dollar business tax break: "I'm
surprised by my friends when it comes to investing in people but
spending like drunken sailors to line the pockets of the rich and
powerful."</TE>
<TE>   May 1998: The same John Burton rebukes the GOP for a tax cut that
could starve public schools: "I don't think we should act like
drunken sailors on leave but be somewhat prudent."</TE>
<TE>   December 1999: Senate Republicans' plans to spend a huge bite of
the surplus (remember the surplus?) on a number of projects have
Democratic Senate leader John Burton warning, "These guys are
spending money like drunken sailors."</TE>
<TE>   December 2001: Richard Riordan, surveying the state budget,
accuses Gray Davis of "spending like a drunken sailor."</TE>
<TE>   Buy you a drink, sailor?</TE>
<TE>   Another Case of a Disappearing Seal</TE>
<TE>   After the presidential seal was lifted from the lectern by a
former Corona mayor to "save" it following George W. Bush's recent
speech in Ontario, a Disney employee described a similar incident
that happened years ago, after Richard Nixon spoke at the
Contemporary Resort at Walt Disney World.</TE>
<TE>   Then as now, the First Seal disappeared from the lectern--not for
safekeeping, but out of a sense of mischief on the part of some
frisky young Disney things. The Secret Service, summoning the culprit
pool, declared that if the seal reappeared, no problem, no questions
asked. If not--well, the agent made it clear, he hoped everyone was
prepared for a full-on IRS audit.</TE>
<TE>   The seal was returned forthwith to the mischief-makers' boss, who
delivered it unto the Secret Service.</TE>
<TE>   Who's for Whom</TE>
<TE>   Gray Davis: the FDR Democratic Club for Persons with Disabilities
and Seniors; Access Now for Gay and Lesbian Equality.</TE>
<TE>   Bill Jones: L.A. County Supervisor Don Knabe.</TE>
<TE>   Richard Riordan: California Young Republicans.</TE>
<TE>   Bill Simon: California ProLife Council; California Organization of
Police and Sheriffs, state Sen. Ray Haynes (R--Riverside).</TE>
<TE>   Points Taken</TE>
<TE>   * Dick Cheney sighting in the works: The vice president and his
wife are to receive the "Architect of Peace" award from Julie Nixon
Eisenhower on Feb. 19 at a $2,500-a-plate luncheon at the Nixon
Library.</TE>
<TE>   * Fullerton GOP Rep. Ed Royce, who's been angling for five long
years for Radio Free Afghanistan broadcasting, finally saw President
Bush sign a bill to spend more than $19 million for Royce's proposal.</TE>
<TE>   * At Planned Parenthood LA's annual Roe v. Wade awards luncheon,
an unusually animated Gray Davis declared that "as long as I am
governor, as long as I am breathing, California will be a pro-choice
state," and Granada Hills Assemblyman and Dr. Keith Richman received
the group's "Giraffe Award" for "sticking his neck out" as a
pro-choice Republican.</TE>
<TE>   * In the first paragraph of a Bill Jones campaign press release
scorching rival Dick Riordan--whose airport director hired a Clinton
pal and Whitewater felon--the name of said felon was spelled Webster
Hubble, as in the telescope, instead of Hubbell, as in Hubbell.</TE>
<TE>   * Steven A. Nissen, lately the director of Gray Davis' office of
planning and research, is moving to L.A. to join the bemuscled law
firm of Manatt, Phelps &amp; Phillips.</TE>
<TE>   You Can Quote Me</TE>
<TE>   "You don't get parole from this governor. Even compassionate
release is hard to get."</TE>
<TE>   --Mike Florio, a senior attorney with the Utility Reform Network,
found out Gov. Davis had extended his reappointment to the California
Independent System Operator board until New Year's Eve 2004. Cal-ISO,
offspring of the 1996 deregulation plan, has labored long and hard to
keep the lights lighted, and now the four board members have had
their terms continued by the governor. No wonder they have been heard
to joke that their duty is like serving a prison sentence.</TE>

toxic crusader Erin Brockovich is endorsing Tom Umberg, a Democratic
candidate for state insurance commissioner. It was a whirlwind
political courtship. Barely six weeks after they met, Brockovich
offered her help. They made their co-starring appearance at the
Westlake Village office of Brockovich's boss, Ed Masry, esquire, the
mayor of Thousand Oaks. (California unreality check: Julia Roberts,

"After reviewing Tom's background, credentials, and commitment to the
issues, I am proud to support his campaign," Brockovich said. "She's
a heroine for California consumers and I'm honored to have her
support," Umberg said. This gives Umberg stereo-Erin support. His

<HD>Keep Existing Tax Cuts but Freeze New Ones</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WILLIAM G. GALE and PETER ORSZAG</AU>
<BD>William G. Gale and Peter Orszag are senior fellows at
the Brookings Institution, a nonpartisan think tank based in
Washington.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Before Sept. 11, the signature achievement of the Bush administration
was a tax cut that phases in slowly and runs through 2010. Now, since
the terrorist attacks and the recession, some Democrats in Congress
want to freeze some of the future cuts. Republicans say that would
hurt the economy and want to make the cuts permanent.</LD>
<LD>   How about a simple compromise: Make permanent the tax cuts that
are already in place, but postpone the others until they are
affordable.</LD>
<LD>   Specifically, any tax cuts not yet in effect should be frozen
until the projected 10-year budget surplus outside of Social Security
and Medicare grows to be at least as large (relative to the economy)
as it was when the tax cut passed. Since about half of the cuts are
already in effect, this would give each side half of what it wants.</LD>
<TE>   For several years, lawmakers on both sides of the aisle promised
not to use the Social Security and Medicare surpluses to finance
other programs or tax cuts. Last May, just before the tax cut was
passed, the 10-year projected surplus outside of Social Security and
Medicare was $2.7 trillion.</TE>
<TE>   Given this projection, Congress scaled back President Bush's
proposal, partially by ending the tax cuts in 2010. Even after the
tax cut, Congress preserved a $1-trillion surplus outside Social
Security and Medicare.</TE>
<TE>   Eight months later, the surplus outside Social Security and
Medicare has been replaced by a deficit of about $1 trillion. The tax
cuts plainly are not as affordable now.</TE>
<TE>   If the tax cuts become affordable again, we can meet our military
and social priorities and enjoy the tax cuts at the same time.</TE>
<TE>   But if the surplus does not recover, freezing future tax cuts
would have several benefits. To the extent the restored funds were
spent on social programs, the country could better meet needs in such
areas as health care and child care. The rest of the restored revenue
would reduce future budget deficits.</TE>
<TE>   Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan has repeatedly expressed
concern that projected deficits were propping up interest rates and
hurting the economy, so restoring longer-term fiscal discipline would
help to spur the economy now.</TE>
<TE>   Administration officials worry that freezing future cuts would
stop people from spending or investing. Yet evidence shows that last
summer, Americans mostly did not spend even the $300 or $600 rebate
they received, much less the ones they were projected to get in
future years.</TE>
<TE>   Economic research suggests that people tend not to spend tax cuts
prospectively; they wait until the money is in their pockets. Our
proposal would make the already implemented tax cuts permanent, which
should raise their perceived value to households.</TE>
<TE>   One other element lurks in the background. The tax cuts that have
taken effect benefit households across much of the income spectrum.
But most of the future tax cuts go to the highest-income households.</TE>
<TE>   Freezing the future tax cuts until they are affordable while also
making the existing tax cuts permanent would offer a little to both
sides. It's a true middle ground on the budget, and it would help
clarify our real choices ahead.</TE>

<HD>Saluting the Military's Wishes Has a Penalty</HD>

<AU>MICHAEL O'HANLON</AU>
<BD>Michael O'Hanlon, formerly of the Congressional Budget
Office, is a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Bush administration has announced that it will seek an increase
of $48 billion in next year's military budget, bringing it to roughly
$390 billion. Even in these times, it is unnecessarily high and takes
money away from other more needed domestic programs.</LD>
<LD>   To get a sense of how big the proposed budget increase would be,
consider a few facts. Adjusting for inflation, this would be the
largest year-to-year increase in the defense budget since the Korean
War. American defense spending would exceed the Cold War norm and
almost equal the Reagan-era average. It would exceed Russia's or
China's military budget almost tenfold.</LD>
<LD>   To be sure, some defense spending increase is still warranted,
even though today's military is one-third smaller than the Cold War
force. Today's armed forces are made up of more expensive people
operating more sophisticated weaponry. They are busy around the world
and training hard at home.</LD>
<TE>   Even though there was a hefty defense budget increase last year,
most of it went to salaries, operations, equipment maintenance, and
research and development. We still need to increase spending to
replace aging weaponry. A further increase of $10 billion to $15
billion, mostly for the Pentagon's procurement budget, makes sense.
Add that to the cost of the ongoing war and there is valid
explanation for about half of President Bush's proposed increase.</TE>
<TE>   But in arguing for a $48-billion increase, the president wrongly
assumes that the war on terrorism requires satisfying every Pentagon
desire. As we all have learned by watching the performance of our
forces in Afghanistan, some weapons are performing more brilliantly
than others. Unmanned aerial vehicles, precision-guided munitions,
and rapid communications and information networks have provided much
of the punch for defeating the Taliban and Al Qaeda. Many of these
weapons were purchased during the years when Pentagon procurement
budgets were modest. Forced to make difficult choices, the Pentagon
put its money into high-payoff and relatively low-cost weaponry. It
cannot economize in all cases, but it is good to give the Pentagon
these types of incentives.</TE>
<TE>   By granting the military virtually every weapon on its agenda,
Bush will remove the financial pressure that leads organizations to
prioritize, economize and to find new ways of doing business more
efficiently. Again, to be fair, the president is doing nothing more
than fully funding a force structure and a weapons agenda he
inherited from the Clinton administration. But to govern is to
choose, and Bush is failing to do that.</TE>
<TE>   In September 1999, candidate Bush, in a speech at the Citadel,
called for the military services to skip a generation of weaponry.
Arguing that many new systems would be unnecessary if the Defense
Department developed new tactics, he suggested that the country could
have a better military without devoting most of the fiscal surplus to
the nation's armed forces.</TE>
<TE>   Now the surplus is gone and Bush, ironically, has abandoned his
call for financial restraint at the Pentagon. After Sept. 11, no one
can deny that we need ample funds to wage the war on terrorism and to
protect the U.S. homeland. But most of the proposed defense spending
increase would not directly aid those missions. Instead, it would go
toward advanced fighter aircraft, destroyers and other weapons that
would be needed in large numbers only if we fought an advanced
military. Neither Al Qaeda nor any other terrorist organization or
any state sponsor of terrorism possesses such a force. We still must
prepare for possible war against a country such as China, but even
that mission does not require busting the bank.</TE>
<TE>   The Pentagon does need to replace aging weaponry, but it need not
replace every existing weapon with something costing twice as much.
More economical innovations are possible by exploiting the full
promise of the computer and electronics revolutions.</TE>
<TE>   Devoting huge sums to the military could interfere with other
national priorities. Bush may be unable to find funds for medical
care, education, further welfare reform and other needs at home. As
serious as Sept. 11 was, we need not and must not sacrifice our
domestic agenda to defeat Al Qaeda.</TE>

<LD>There's no such thing as public education. Education happens to
exactly one person at a time.</LD>
<LD>   There are some things that you just have to do by yourself. Even
if I'm your teacher, you can't have my education; your education is a
private task that is given to yourself.</LD>
<LD>   The education of someone or everyone else doesn't add a single
item to your stock of knowledge.</LD>
<TE>   And there's no such thing as compulsory education. Education is
something that each of us gives to ourselves or allows others to give
us. Otherwise we call it indoctrination or assault; we don't call it
knowledge.</TE>
<TE>   In my son's elementary school, there is a slogan plastered on the
walls: "Have the courage to stand up for what you believe."</TE>
<TE>   No one actually sees it at all: It's a form of wallpaper. It's not
intended to communicate information but to sweeten our day with words
so often repeated that no one's brain gets any traction on them
anymore. They are nothing more than a set of high-sounding nonsense
syllables.</TE>
<TE>   Besides that, it is utterly dishonest. The people who put up that
sign want anything, everything, except for your child to have the
courage to stand up for what she believes.</TE>
<TE>   The reason my son, Vince, and I were in the school in the first
place was because Vince had refused to take a test. He sat there
quietly but simply refused to make any marks on the paper, although
he thought the test was easy.</TE>
<TE>   Asked why, Vince said that the material was stupid, and that it
was exactly the same thing he had been learning in health for the
last several years: how to make decisions, how to deal with stress,
etc.--stuff Vince doesn't think bears repeating.</TE>
<TE>   You could put it like this: It had suddenly dawned on Vince that
he was the one who was responsible for his own education.</TE>
<TE>   So together, we went to the school to get the health textbook. I
read the chapter. The material was goofy, and perhaps not what you'd
usually think of as education, but it wasn't moronically written or
sheer propaganda.</TE>
<TE>   Personally, I'd have taken the test.</TE>
<TE>   But they weren't giving me the test. They were giving it to Vince,
who seemed suddenly to have come across the courage to stand up for
what he believed.</TE>
<TE>   And then the teacher explained to me why Vince had to take the
test, aside from the fact that he'd get a zero: "It is approved
curriculum."</TE>
<TE>   Or putting it another way: It's public education--the standardized
information we hope to insert into everyone's head simultaneously.</TE>
<TE>   Stand up for what you believe? Teachers are required to teach the
approved curricula like a little chorus of playback devices. Their
success is measured by mechanical performance on standardized tests.</TE>
<TE>   No large institution values independent thought, and public
schools actively despise and punish it; they demand and attempt to
enforce and reward mindless obedience. That, and not algebra, is what
they are designed to teach. That is their fundamental purpose, the
real justification of their existence.</TE>
<TE>   If you don't believe this to be true, notice that refusing to take
a a test on the grounds that you object to the material is treated in
exactly the same way as acting up on the playground. The punishment
(we'll call your parents, send you to the principal, suspend you) is
the same. For the institution, the infraction is the same:
disobedience. That Vince's refusal was a principled intellectual
objection is irrelevant to the institution, because the institution
has nothing to do with principles or with intellect.</TE>
<TE>   What the public schools want from our children and for that matter
from its own teachers is just what the Soviet Union wanted from its
citizens: a continual enactment of the empty forms of obedience,
continual self-betrayal.</TE>
<TE>   You can call that freedom and courage if you want, but that
doesn't mean it isn't slavery and cowardice.</TE>
<TE>   Today Vince is going to take the test. The teacher will assign him
a number--his grade. That number will not reflect the measurement of
what Vince knows. That was never the point.</TE>
<TE>   That number represents one thing: obedience to the institution.</TE>

<LD>OK, there's no proof the CIA bugged the new jetliner of Chinese
President Jiang Zemin. It is really, really shocking that while the
Boeing 767 was being built near Seattle and custom-fitted for months
in San Antonio, more than two dozen satellite-controlled listening
devices somehow fell into the leather upholstery of Jiang's fancy new
airplane chairs and into the headboard of his comfy airborne bed near
his high-flying hot shower. Just think what political and
non-Communist chatter this bug collection might have transmitted. And
how conscientiously other world leaders now inspect their Boeing
beds.</LD>
<LD>   Who would do such a sneaky thing? Probably not Peru. France is
still on vacation, isn't it? Argentina is demonstrating again this
week. Fingering the CIA is like noticing a chewing teenager minutes
before the cookies are discovered missing. We can hope it's the
agency back in game-shape. But have you  noticed the major powers'
"let's-agree-not-to-notice-spying" attitude, post-9/11, when so many
routines and assumptions seem upside down?</LD>
<TE>   Americans do seem to have problems with planes and spying, witness
the Soviet Union's U-2 downing (the plane, not the band) that wrecked
a 1960 Eisenhower-Khrushchev summit. Last spring, you'll recall, an
American EP-3 spy plane collided with a tailing Chinese fighter over
international waters, producing a loud international confrontation
and weeks of tensions. But now, it seems, we're in a friendlier,
forgiving era: President Bush's Beijing visit, postponed by
September's events, starts Feb. 21, the precise 30th anniversary of
President Nixon's historic trip there to restore relations. And Jiang
reportedly wants to visit the Bush ranch after the Texas summer. So
right now smart Chinese officials don't see spy bugs as a problem.
The CIA is modestly silent. And our imaginations run amok.</TE>
<TE>   We can only imagine what Chinese faction might have a stake in
leaking word of the bugs, if they really existed, or maybe placing
them itself to embarrass or pressure its own president. Then there's
the money. China reported the plane's outfitting at $30 million; the
outfitters say they got $10 million. Hmmm. How much is rich
Corinthian leather anyway?</TE>
<TE>   The luxurious jetliner with ample legroom sits idle now on a
military airfield enduring the winds of China's 55th winter under
Communist rule. Maybe sometime after Jiang retires next year, for a
few million dollars more they can turn the Chinese president's
personal aircraft into a museum for the proletariat to see firsthand
the decadence of capitalism.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>When President Bush entered office, he seized upon the projected
$5.6-trillion surplus to ram through sweeping tax cuts. Now the
Congressional Budget Office and the White House are projecting that
the United States will be in the red for the rest of Bush's term. In
2002 alone the White House estimates that the deficit will be $106
billion, whereas it projected a $231-billion surplus last year. Is
this cause for alarm?</LD>
<LD>   Not yet. Running a deficit in either a recession or a war is a
time-honored practice. The U.S. currently finds itself in both.</LD>
<LD>   Even though Congress and the White House failed to agree on a
stimulus package, the spending increases that the administration is
proposing for defense and homeland security will almost surely boost
the economy. So don't panic. But do be concerned at the
administration's cavalier approach to entering this economic danger
zone.</LD>
<TE>   White House Budget Director Mitchell E. Daniels Jr. observed that
this year's budget numbers can "oscillate wildly." But the overall
trends are disturbing--and, in part, the result of the
administration's tax cut program. In 2002 alone, these cuts have cost
the government $38 billion in revenue. Add to that losses from lower
capital gains tax revenues resulting from the stock market's doldrums
and the budget really starts to get squeezed.</TE>
<TE>   No, it's not economic Armageddon. But it's not good. For one
thing, it appears the administration will be forced to tap Social
Security funds to finance other  programs. Worse, deficits directly
punish lower-income Americans by drying up jobs.</TE>
<TE>   In the Clinton era, Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan was
able to keep interest rates low because the federal government was
practicing fiscal restraint. Lower interest rates translated into
cheaper borrowing costs for businesses and played a big role in
bringing unemployment to historical lows. Testifying before the
Senate Budget Committee on Thursday, Greenspan said the disappearance
of the budget surplus was pushing up long-term interest rates and
slowing economic growth. He called on Congress to make future tax
cuts or spending increases dependent on progress in reducing the
national debt.</TE>
<TE>   The White House should listen, before its stubborn refusal to
delay or cancel its planned tax cuts fritters away everything it
inherited from Clinton.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The years-long court battle over Microsoft could end up being
worthwhile for consumers with too few choices and too much glitchy
software that crashes or freezes because it doesn't quite fit with
Windows. The right conclusion to the suits could open a whole new
world of programs that actually work on Windows PCs.</LD>
<LD>   With last week's lawsuit against Microsoft charging that it
illegally shoved the Netscape Internet browser out of the market, AOL
Time Warner joins nine state attorneys general and at least 100
private plaintiffs who are suing Microsoft for monetary damages. Many
of their grievances against Microsoft's illegal, anti-competitive
bullying are legitimate. AOL, a latecomer to the suits first filed in
1995, had held off until it decided the government's settlement deal
with Microsoft was insufficient.</LD>
<LD>   With another huge lawsuit on her docket, U.S. District Judge
Colleen Kollar-Kotelly still has to decide how she will order
Microsoft to remedy its bad marketplace behavior when the
government's antitrust trial resumes in March. Kollar-Kotelly should
not let the flood of litigation devolve into a lottery-style cash
bonanza. Her focus should be on the future, not on the
past--specifically, on creating equal business opportunity so
software competition can thrive.</LD>
<TE>   The judge may not be able to resolve all the anti-Microsoft
litigation in a single ruling. Legal scholars can't even agree on the
mathematics of calculating the monetary harm of Microsoft's past
anti-competitive conduct. But Kollar-Kotelly can help stem the tide
of lawsuits and give innovators a chance to compete by forcing
Microsoft to disclose Windows coding to outsiders. Microsoft's
secrecy has essentially prohibited software developers outside its
Redmond, Wash., headquarters from writing programs that run on
Windows without crashing.</TE>
<TE>   A requirement that Microsoft disclose coding was at the heart of
an out-of-court settlement reached with the Bush administration last
November. Nine states, including California, rejected the settlement
because they thought it had glaring loopholes. In a brief to
Kollar-Kotelly last week, three top U.S. economists detailed how
those holes would let Microsoft continue withholding coding.</TE>
<TE>   Kollar-Kotelly should demand that Microsoft hand outsiders the
software keys they need to write programs that work on Windows.
Software disclosure would not undercut Microsoft's ability to profit
from selling Windows. It would only increase Windows' legitimacy by
helping its operating system run the sort of programs that ordinary
PC users want, not what arrogant Microsoft bosses think they should
use.</TE>
<TE>   By focusing both sides away from monetary claims and toward the
larger and more legitimate issue of how to increase competition,
Judge Kollar-Kotelly can see to it that some good comes out of the
seemingly interminable Microsoft trial.</TE>

<LD>Misconception of our immigration laws is abundant. A Jan. 22 letter
writer who declared that those smart enough to be accepted to our
universities should be smart enough to take the citizenship test is
unaware that such students would gladly comply, but they are not
entitled to do so. Securing legal status in the U.S. is a complex and
protracted process, usually based on specialized skills, shortages in
occupations or close family relatives who are U.S. citizens.</LD>
<LD>   Most of the young adults seeking to enter our universities were
brought here as children and have grown up in this country. They had
no voice in their parents' decision to bring them to the U.S.
illegally and know no other culture or country. They are innocent
victims who now find themselves strangers in a place they have
considered their home. They are faced with the death of their hopes
for higher education and an exit from the poverty they have endured.
Providing them the opportunity to attend our university at resident
rates is nothing more than a humanitarian effort to incorporate them
into our society. Even after attaining a university degree they will
have to find a way to legalize their immigration status.</LD>

<TE>   Gubernatorial candidate Richard Riordan says illegal aliens have a
"God-given right" to be educated and medicated at taxpayers' expense
(Jan. 23). This is an idiotic position. The truth is that U.S.
citizens owe nothing to illegal aliens.</TE>
<TE>   If our country is to avoid internal violence and remain
independent, united, free and sovereign, the rule of law must be
followed, and that includes the immigration laws.</TE>

<HD>Waste: This Hot Potato's Supposed to Stay in State</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"If It's 'Hot,' It's Not Just Trash" (editorial, Jan. 22) discussed
matters of concern to the Southwestern Low-Level Radioactive Waste
Commission. The commission is the governing body that represents the
states of Arizona, California, North Dakota and South Dakota under
Public Law 100-712. The law requires California to dispose of
radioactive waste from hospitals, universities, governmental
agencies, utilities and industry in the four states.</LD>
<LD>   A license was issued in 1993 (and is still in effect) for a
disposal facility in Ward Valley, but it was never constructed--not
because of concerns about safety but because of political issues.
Your editorial points out that waste is now being shipped to
facilities in Utah and South Carolina and asks, "Why not keep using
them?"</LD>
<TE>   The answer lies in the facts that the South Carolina facility is
phasing out of accepting waste from states outside of its own compact
members and will no longer take waste from the Southwestern region
after 2008 and that Utah is not likely to want to be known as the
only state in the nation where low-level waste can go. It was
precisely that concern that caused the states of Nevada, Washington
and South Carolina to close their facilities two decades ago. Unless
California acts to open a disposal facility, it and its compact
partners may not have any option but to store waste at the hundreds
of places where it is generated.</TE>

<LD>Your Jan. 18 editorial opposing offshore oil drilling probably
reflects popular sentiment, but it also represents the height of
NIMBY hypocrisy. We Californians drive our cars more than anyone else
and we treat unlimited cheap gas as a birthright. Yet we insist on
having our delicate sensibilities shielded from any of the dirty work
that makes it all possible.</LD>
<LD>   Offshore drilling should be permitted. Of course, there must be
strict safeguards against spills, and conservation is also very
important. But it is wrong to declare a vast source of energy
off-limits because of environmental fanaticism.</LD>

<LD>Regarding the distinction between unlawful combatants and POWs at
Guantanamo Bay ("Captives Not POWs, U.S. Contends," Jan. 23): I agree
with Amnesty International and the Red Cross that the prisoners taken
from Afghanistan should be called POWs and be given the rights
accorded to such. They were members of the Taliban army captured
during a war defending themselves from the U.S. and Northern Alliance
armies. The Pentagon's excuse that they are disqualified from being
called POWs because of their lack of a uniform or insignia is
ridiculous.</LD>
<LD>   If we are treating them humanely and are going to give them a fair
trial, as the Bush administration contends, then why not call them
POWs? Why is the Bush administration so afraid to abide by
international conventions?</LD>

<TE>   I was glad to see the issue of the plight of the faux POWs at
Guantanamo Bay Naval Base elevated to your Jan. 23 editorial page.
Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld ought to assign each prisoner to
an American family for one year. Let the individual Talib decide at
the end of his stay with a host family what kind of lifestyle he
prefers.</TE>

<TE>   I really enjoyed reading "Do What We Say, Not What We Do" by Molly
Ivins (Commentary, Jan. 25). Her drivel about the allegedly
substandard treatment at Guantanamo Bay of prisoners from Afghanistan
typifies the bleeding-heart, I-am-a-victim mentality in the U.S.
today. I would remind Ivins to again look at photos of the World
Trade Center towers, smoking like chimneys and collapsing. Or photos
of American citizens free-falling from the upper floors of the WTC.
Or photos of the gaping hole in the Pentagon, where heads of
government were targets. The prisoners from Afghanistan are not in
Guantanamo because they sang off-key in the Sunday choir; they are
nasty and dangerous fellows. They are not victims, they are
perpetrators.</TE>
<TE>   But I can see that Ivins is very concerned with the issue of human
welfare for these Guantanamo prisoners. So perhaps she would consider
having all those folks stay over at her place, at least until the
U.S. government can provide appropriate "Ivins-level" accommodations.</TE>

<LD>I was shocked and disgusted but somehow not surprised by a detail of
Kenneth Lay's compensation structure nearly buried at the end of the
story of his resignation (Jan. 24). You reported that Lay had a
credit line of $7.5 million from Enron, meaning he could borrow that
much from the firm at any given time for his personal use. He took
advantage of this arrangement multiple times last summer, and then
would repay the loan with his Enron stock, only to take advantage of
the credit line once again.</LD>
<LD>   All this was happening in the months just prior to his famous
September speech exhorting his employees to buy the "undervalued"
stock. Then Enron announced its worst quarter ever. Finally, I
understand Lay's motives--they were in his own best interests. Of
course.</LD>

<LD>Utterly despicable is Hussein Ibish's claim that "the attack on an
Israeli bat mitzvah . . . appears to have been a direct response to
the murder of [Raed] Karmi" (Commentary, Jan. 24). A direct response?
People of goodwill recognize that Israel has targeted those
Palestinian extremists who themselves have targeted unarmed
civilians, murdering them with explosives packed with nails and metal
scraps intended to inflict as much pain upon victims as possible.
Acting in its own self-defense, Israel is targeting those responsible
for past acts of terrorism and preventing future tragedies. This is
hardly justification for randomly killing dozens of innocents.</LD>
<LD>   Ibish would have us believe that there is no other choice for the
Palestinians but to turn to terrorism. A good alternative would be
for the Palestinians to cease all violence and accept Israel's very
generous offer of autonomy and shared control of Jerusalem.</LD>

<HD>Bush Budget Calls for More Defense Spending</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>President Bush seems determined to resurrect the disastrous
borrow-and-spend policies of his Republican predecessors, Ronald
Reagan and dear old Dad ("Bush Seeks $48-Billion Defense Hike," Jan.
24). The U.S. already spends more on its military than all other
nations on the planet combined; where is this money going? If $331
billion a year is insufficient to defend the country from a dozen
guys armed with razor blades, then I'm afraid another $48 billion
isn't going to help.</LD>
<LD>   Bush's fiscal irresponsibility has already caused him to come up
an astonishing $106 billion short on this year's budget; rather than
further cripple the U.S. economy with yet another ill-advised
spending binge, Bush should tell his cronies in the Carlyle Group,
Lockheed and Boeing: "Sorry, I already spent your $48 billion on that
tax cut I gave you last year."</LD>

<TE>   I read with astonishment your separate articles on President
Bush's request for a $48-billion hike for defense programs and about
LAUSD principals, already struggling to make ends meet, who were
recently given a few hours to choose which programs they would have
to eliminate from our children's education because of the governor's
budget cuts.</TE>
<TE>   What came to mind was a profound statement made by Martin Luther
King Jr. in 1967: "A nation that continues year after year to spend
more money on military defense than on programs of social uplift is
approaching spiritual death." That was more than 30 years ago. I do
believe we have gone into cardiac arrest.</TE>

<LD>Careful readers of The Times on Jan. 24 must have been thoroughly
confused about plans to upgrade the regulation of the accounting
profession under the aegis of the Securities and Exchange Commission.
''SEC Chief Pushes Accounting Agenda'' (Business) reported correctly
that the SEC opposes any accounting regulatory system that is
directly under the control of a profession it is designed to
discipline. That is what I said on Jan. 17 at a news conference in
Washington, and what I said on Jan. 23 in a speech in San Diego.</LD>
<LD>   Bizarrely, your editorial (''Oblivious to a Strong Smell'') opined
that ''the new oversight board would apparently be largely controlled
by the industry's American Institute of Certified Public
Accountants.'' I can assure you and the investing public that I am
well aware of the flaws in our current disclosure and accounting
systems and I will be tireless in my efforts to repair them.</LD>

<TE>   The Jan. 24 cartoon by Michael Ramirez seems to suggest that
President Bush is no more linked to Enron than he is to Kmart.</TE>
<TE>   Doesn't Ramirez realize that six secret (at the time) meetings
between Enron officials and Vice President Cheney or his staff shaped
current Bush administration energy policy? Doesn't he know that
Bush's top economic advisor, Lawrence Lindsey (a former Enron
consultant), gave a favorable report to the president on Enron's
problems shortly before the damning truth came out? Is he aware that
Bush's chairman of the SEC, Harvey Pitt, advocated allowing
accounting firms like Andersen to also serve as highly paid
consultants to companies like Enron, a blatant conflict of interest

<HD>Mary Holmes, 91; Taught Eccentric Theories of Art</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MYRNA OLIVER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>She viewed women's makeup as a mask of conformity, unisex trends as
rendering men and women like puppies in a litter and the modern rage
for skinniness as indicative of world woes.</LD>
<LD>   And she kept few of those views private. She endeared herself to
students, colleagues, friends and the curious public by lecturing
regularly on such subjects inside and outside the classroom.</LD>
<LD>   Mary A. Holmes, a painter and instructor in art history at UCLA
and later UC Santa Cruz, where she was on the founding faculty, has
died. She was 91.</LD>
<TE>   Holmes, who taught at UCLA for more than a decade before going to
Santa Cruz in 1965 to teach there until 1977, died Jan. 21 in a Santa
Cruz hospital after a brief illness.</TE>
<TE>   "I have a funny way of teaching art," she told The Times in 1969.
"I teach art as an illumination of life. It sounds very pretentious,
but almost anything is capable of giving an illuminating experience,
and art is particularly good because it doesn't do anything else."</TE>
<TE>   To illustrate her theory about what fuels the diet industry, for
example, Holmes presented color slides of work by German painter
Lucas Cranach, who died in 1553.</TE>
<TE>   "During gloomy periods, people are always very skinny," she would
say. "During the late Gothic period, they had Black Death, and a
third of the people died. It was like the atomic bomb. Cranach did
the skinniest, most worried-looking ladies. They would make a Vogue
model look fat."</TE>
<TE>   By contrast, she would continue, after Christopher Columbus
discovered America in 1492, Europe became euphoric and "ladies got
monstrously fat. [Peter Paul] Rubens' ladies, you just want to poke
them."</TE>
<TE>   As for her painting, Holmes said she tried to portray such
Christian virtues as fortitude, using biblical and mythical figures
and faces from her imagination.</TE>
<TE>   But she was adamant that her classroom topic be art history, once
commenting that it was "very dangerous for anybody who wants to paint
to teach painting" and that she had seen the twin role "destroy I
don't know how many people."</TE>
<TE>   Holmes earned a philosophy degree from the all-women's Hollins
College in Virginia, which she once told The Times she loved because:
"It was full of loony old ladies, outrageous lunatics of marvelous
dimension and charm who belonged to the old feminist movement."</TE>
<TE>   "You can't learn anything except from eccentrics, you know," she
said. "It has something to do with their getting your attention in
the first place."</TE>
<TE>   Holmes earned a master's in art from the University of Iowa, and
studied at the University of Berlin, the Academie Collorossi in
Paris, Johns Hopkins University and the Art Students League in New
York. Then she set out to emulate those eccentric educators she so
admired.</TE>
<TE>   After a brief marriage that produced her only son, Holmes settled
into teaching at UCLA and in 1953 hosted an innovative educational
television program called "Art 5A" based on her university lectures.</TE>
<TE>   She also moved into a concrete block "castle" a mile beyond paved
streets overlooking Agoura. It was the house in which Maxwell
Anderson wrote "The Bad Seed."</TE>
<TE>   Holmes lined the walls of the castle with her canvases and
populated the 8-acre grounds with peafowl, Plymouth rock chickens,
two dogs, two horses and, she claimed, "49 million cats, all wild."</TE>
<TE>   After moving north, she duplicated her bucolic fortress near Santa
Cruz, where her late sister, architectural historian Sara Boutelle,
was researching her biography of Hearst Castle designer Julia Morgan.</TE>
<TE>   "I have to live in the country because I'm too difficult to live
around people," Holmes told her amused audience at an Assistance
League lecture in Santa Monica in 1968.</TE>
<TE>   "I love people, but my dogs, horses, cats, two hawks and a
crippled hen just don't fit into the tract concept of life."</TE>
<TE>   Settled on her Santa Cruz mountaintop, Holmes described her
menagerie there to a Times writer in 1969 as: "Three horses, an
appaloosa pony just to look at, a billy goat, chickens, three dogs
[one vicious] and all kinds of things to keep me out of decent
society."</TE>
<TE>   In Santa Cruz, Holmes helped colleagues form Penny University,
which met at local coffeehouses and was modeled loosely on 18th
century English gatherings where people would pay a penny for a cup
of coffee and spend the day reading newspapers and conversing. She
attended faithfully for more than 20 years.</TE>
<TE>   Likening the informal discussions among campus and non-campus
attendees to a radio talk show, Holmes once told the San Jose Mercury
News: "We talk about whatever's interesting to us. I can't think of
anything we wouldn't discuss."</TE>
<TE>   Holmes is survived by her son, Michael Adams Holmes O'Malley of
Berkeley; three grandchildren, and two great-grandchildren.</TE>
<TE>   A memorial is planned Feb. 3 at 2 p.m. in the Calvary Episcopal
Church, 532 Center St., Santa Cruz.</TE>

<HD>Edith Bouvier Beale, 84; Film Showed Squalid Life in
Hamptons</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Little Edie" Bouvier Beale, 84, the eccentric cousin of Jacqueline
Kennedy Onassis whose squalid life in the Hamptons was turned into
Albert and David Maysles' 1975 cult documentary "Grey Gardens," died
recently in Bal Harbour, Fla.</LD>
<LD>   The date of death, apparently from a stroke or heart attack, was
uncertain.</LD>
<LD>   Beale, once a debutante and model, and her mother, also named
Edith, made national headlines in the early 1970s when Long Island,
N.Y., health officials nearly evicted them from their decaying
28-room East Hampton mansion after discovering the women were living
ankle deep in cat feces.</LD>
<TE>   After Beale moved in to care for her mother in 1952, the two women
seemed to slip into an oddball life of seclusion and filth.
Nevertheless, Beale and her odd fashion sense--wrapping a sweater
around her head as a turban or wearing a bathing suit and high heels
to feed raccoons in her attic--inspired fashion layouts in Italian
Vogue and Harper's Bazaar and influenced the work of such designers
as Todd Oldham.</TE>
<TE>   Many criticized the Maysles for invading the women's privacy with
their documentary, but when they showed the film to the women, Beale
exclaimed: "The Maysles have created a classic."</TE>
<TE>   Her mother died in 1977, and Beale sold the mansion and moved to
Florida.</TE>

<LD>Harvey Matusow, 75, former aide to U.S. Sen. Joseph McCarthy who was
sent to prison for perjury but later starred in a children's
television show, died Jan. 17 in a Lebanon, N.H., hospital of
injuries suffered in a car accident Jan. 2.</LD>
<LD>   Matusow, who began an acting career in New York theater, joined
the Communist Party in 1948 and later went to work for McCarthy.</LD>
<LD>   Matusow, providing evidence for McCarthy's anti-communist
blacklisting campaign, testified against 244 men and women before the
House Un-American Activities Committee in 1952. Many of those Matusow
named were actors with whom he had worked.</LD>
<TE>   But the sometime actor later admitted he had lied on the witness
stand. He was convicted of perjury and spent four years in federal
prison.</TE>
<TE>   During his incarceration, he conceived the idea for his "Magic
Mouse Television" program, which was telecast on an Arizona station
in the 1980s.</TE>
<TE>   Matusow, who married 11 times, later created and ran Utah's first
public access television station. Most recently, he had been
converting a former commune in Wendell Junction, Mass., for use as a
homeless shelter and community center.</TE>

<HD>Ralph Voss, 91; Bank Executive</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MYRNA OLIVER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ralph J. Voss, former president, chief executive and board chairman
of Western Bancorporation, the holding company for United California
Bank and forerunner of First Interstate Bancorp, has died. He was 91.</LD>
<LD>   Voss died Jan. 20 in his sleep at the assisted living center in
Portland, Ore., where he resided.</LD>
<LD>   A banker for his entire career, Voss so personified the role that
many said they would know his occupation even without his trademark
pinstripe suit and gray silk tie.</LD>
<TE>   "I can't think of any other job I'd want," he once told the Oregon
Journal.</TE>
<TE>   In his more than four decades in the industry, Voss saw major
changes in banking that presaged multiple mergers, and after his
retirement in 1978 watched many of the bank names he had served
disappear.</TE>
<TE>   Western Bancorporation itself, holding company for United
California Bank and some dozen smaller banks throughout the Western
states, adopted the name First Interstate Bancorp in 1981, with
United California becoming First Interstate Bank. The whole lot was
taken over by Wells Fargo in 1996. Wells Fargo in turn was gobbled up
by Norwest, although the historic Wells Fargo name remains.</TE>
<TE>   Born Ralph Jensby Voss on Aug. 11, 1910, in Eagle Grove, Iowa,
Voss earned his bachelor's degree from the University of Minnesota
and began his career with Continental Illinois National Bank and
Trust Co. (now Bank of America) in Chicago in 1934.</TE>
<TE>   He served in the Army throughout World War II, rising from second
lieutenant to lieutenant colonel. He was stationed in England,
Africa, Italy, France and Germany, and earned a Bronze Star for his
organizational efforts in Germany.</TE>
<TE>   Voss moved to Los Angeles in 1946 to join California Bank (later
United California Bank) and by the time he left in 1960 had risen to
senior vice president.</TE>
<TE>   For the next 12 years, Voss served as president of the First
National Bank of Oregon, another of Western Bancorporation's units,
and supervised the building of one of Portland's first skyscrapers as
the bank's headquarters. That bank evolved into First Interstate Bank
of Oregon and more recently Wells Fargo.</TE>
<TE>   During his Portland tenure, Voss served as a director and
fund-raiser for Lewis and Clark College and was on boards of several
organizations, including the Oregon Symphony, Boy Scouts and Portland
Chamber of Commerce.</TE>
<TE>   He was a director of the Portland Branch of the Federal Reserve
Bank and later of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   Returning to Los Angeles in 1972 as Western's president, Voss
helped expand and modernize the holding company through creation of
the Western Bancorporation Mortgage Co. in 1974 and the Western
Bancorporation Data Processing Co. in 1975.</TE>
<TE>   Voss added the chief executive title to his role as president on
Dec. 31, 1973, and served as CEO and chairman from July 1, 1975,
until his retirement in 1978. During his tenure, Western was
considered the sixth-largest banking organization in the world.</TE>
<TE>   Widowed in 1998 by the death of his wife of 52 years, Eleanore,
Voss is survived by a son, Donald, of La Canada-Flintridge; a
daughter, Janet, of Lake Oswego, Ore.; and two grandsons.</TE>
<TE>   There will be no services. Any memorial donations may be made to
the Carlson School of Management at the University of Minnesota or to
the neonatal unit at Doernbecher Children's Hospital in Portland.</TE>

<HD>Study Says No Clash in Accountants' Dual Role</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GARY GENTILE</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A study of company proxy statements is challenging the notion that
accounting firms that earn consulting fees from companies they audit
have a built-in conflict of interest.</LD>
<LD>   In the wake of the collapse of Enron Corp., some members of
Congress and shareholder activism groups have called for strict rules
preventing auditors from providing lucrative non-audit services.</LD>
<LD>   But a study of nearly 1,000 public companies to be released today
concludes there is no correlation between consulting fees and the
willingness of auditors to deliver bad news to their employers.</LD>
<TE>   Mark DeFond and K.R. Subramanyam of USC's Leventhal School of
Accounting looked at one particular piece of bad news--a statement
from auditors that a company is not likely to survive as a going
concern for one year beyond the date of its financial statement.</TE>
<TE>   The researchers culled proxy statements to shareholders filed in
2001 by more than 3,000 companies. Last year was the first in which
companies were required by the Securities and Exchange Commission to
disclose how much they paid accounting firms for audits and how much
was paid for other services, including tax preparation and advice on
mergers</TE>
<TE>   Some shareholders contend that the disclosure rules do not go far
enough to protect investors and employee pension plans.</TE>
<TE>   The researchers narrowed their list to 944 companies in financial
distress--the ones most likely to receive a so-called going concern
opinion from an auditor.</TE>
<TE>   They found no significant association between the ratio of audit
to non-audit fees and the likelihood of an auditor issuing a going
concern opinion.</TE>
<TE>   "Non-audit service that people are concerned about don't seem to
influence those decisions," DeFond said.</TE>
<TE>   The pair also wanted to know if accounting firms that receive
particularly large fees for audits alone were less likely to deliver
bad news. They found just the opposite, that auditors are more likely
to issue going concern opinions to clients who pay relatively higher
fees.</TE>

<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>AMR Corp.'s American Airlines and British Airways said Sunday that
they have called off a proposed alliance after U.S. regulators
demanded that the carriers give rivals 16 daily transatlantic
flights.</LD>
<LD>   A Department of Transportation order issued Friday required the
carriers to surrender flights between the U.S. and London's Heathrow
Airport, barred the carriers from sharing pricing data and revenue on
some routes and put the alliance up for review in three years instead
of the five the airlines sought.</LD>
<LD>   The British government, which backs antitrust immunity for its
carriers, followed the carriers' announcement by canceling talks with
the U.S. set for today on expanding air access between the countries
through an "open skies" agreement, Transportation Department
spokesman Bill Mosley said.</LD>
<TE>   "The regulatory price was too high," AMR Chairman Don Carty and
British Airways Chief Executive Rod Eddington said. "The conditions
laid down by the U.S. government do not make sense for either
company. We will not acquiesce to unrealistic and, in our view,
unnecessary demands."</TE>
<TE>   The AMR-British Airways announcement is the second time in 21/2
years that their proposed alliance evaporated after regulators raised
concerns about the carriers' dominance on routes between Heathrow and
U.S. cities such as Chicago and New York.</TE>
<TE>   The postponement of "open skies" talks means the U.S. and Britain
keep operating under a 1977 treaty that lets only British Airways,
Virgin Atlantic Airways, American and UAL Corp.'s United Airlines fly
between the U.S. and Heathrow. Airlines consider the airport a
valuable destination for high-paying business passengers.</TE>

<HD>Argentina Lowers Forecast for GDP</HD>
<DH>Economy: Duhalde government, struggling to balance domestic
and IMF pressures, revises already gloomy outlook.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>BUENOS AIRES</DL>
<LD>Argentina's government, struggling to turn around a four-year
recession that has put the country on the verge of social chaos, said
Sunday that the economy could contract even more this year after a
painful currency devaluation.</LD>
<LD>   Only two days after the biggest street demonstrations yet by an
angry middle class and unemployed Argentines protesting the new
government, Deputy Economy Minister Jorge Todesca said gross domestic
product could fall 5% this year.</LD>
<LD>   "When we came into government, at first we forecast a 2.6% fall in
GDP.... We've changed that ... taking us to a 5% contraction. The
budget will be based on this forecast," Todesca told local radio.</LD>
<TE>   Foreign Minister Carlos Ruckauf warned that the country is caught
between recession and public demands for an end to bank deposit
freezes, as well as pressure from the International Monetary Fund to
cut spending and endemic government budget deficits.</TE>
<TE>   "We are on a knife edge--we know we have to reach an agreement
with the monetary fund to save our country's accounts, but at the
same time we cannot go against the interests of the people," Ruckauf
told the Corriere della Sera newspaper. "Argentina told the IMF many
lies, but now we will reveal all the stark truth. We are ready for
decisive measures."</TE>
<TE>   President Eduardo Duhalde, a member of the Peronist Party and the
fifth president in a little more than a month, is cobbling together a
2002 budget plan that will include drastic spending cuts that are
needed to win crucial IMF aid.</TE>
<TE>   Only 26 days into the job, Duhalde has not yet said where the
spending ax will fall or how the government will help the economy.
Ruckauf said measures would include cutting provincial spending and
reducing the value-added tax from 21% to 15%.</TE>
<TE>   The IMF has taken a tougher stance with a country that during the
last year won pledges of $20billion in IMF aid but failed to meet the
agreed-upon macroeconomic targets. The IMF has said that Argentina
must show a credible plan if it expects to receive any more cash.</TE>
<TE>   But neighboring governments are pressing for international help
for Argentina, mindful of the effects the crisis could have on them.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, a study published Sunday by the Fundacion Capital think
tank said Argentina's troubles could affect its major trade partners,
such as regional powerhouse Brazil, by reducing investor confidence
in South America.</TE>

<HD>Intel CEO Makes Case for Broadband Aid</HD>
<DH>Technology: Craig Barrett talks about why he believes
government funding, regulation is needed for competition.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JUBE SHIVER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Hoping to revive Silicon Valley's economic fortunes, Craig Barrett,
chief executive of Intel Corp., traveled to Washington with other
high-tech company executives last week to lobby for greater
government financial and regulatory support for high-speed Internet
access, or broadband.</LD>
<LD>   Between meetings with lawmakers and regulators, Barrett sat down
with a small group of reporters to discuss a range of topics,
including whether Intel, one of California's largest high-tech
employers, will expand its operations in the state after voicing
concerns last summer about the state's electricity crisis.</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<TE>   Question: Why is Intel suddenly calling for more federal support
for broadband after many of the high-speed Internet access start-ups
have either gone out of business or declared bankruptcy?</TE>
<TE>   Answer: You want competition among the various forms [of broadband
delivery] ... cable, [telephone] and satellite. That's the
competition we need.</TE>
<TE>   It's a difficult environment ... but the investments we are
talking about to finance broadband are in the billions and billions
of dollars and the only companies that can afford it are [firms like
the regional Bell phone companies].</TE>
<TE>   I would think the consumer would benefit from three solid
technologies to choose from. You are not going to have competition
unless you have massive capital investment.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Q: Intel comes at this issue a little different from some of the
other firms in the industry. I guess your interest is to have things
built out so there is more demand for your microchips?</TE>
<TE>   A: If you look at what bandwidth can do for the economy--for the
consumer and for small and medium-size businesses--to me it's a very
strong argument, not just for the [advanced] capabilities but for the
nation's competitiveness.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe the fact that our microprocessors have outstripped bandwidth
and we'd like to see a better balance--yeah, there's a parochial
interest.</TE>
<TE>   But if you step back and look at the big picture--which is the
competitiveness of the United States--I don't think you can argue
against a kind of national bandwidth policy.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Q: Do you think the lack of broadband usage is due to the lack of
infrastructure, pricing, content or something else?</TE>
<TE>   A: Broadband, by today's definition, is cable or DSL. It's maybe
200 kilobits [per second] or 300 or 400. But broadband, I think, gets
exciting when you get to 5 megabits per second or even 100 Mbps.</TE>
<TE>   So there's an infrastructure issue because broadband today ... is
not sufficient to provide some of the serious content people are
interested in. So it's this chicken-and-egg issue.</TE>
<TE>   I think fundamentally you want to have the regulatory environment
such that there is strong competition.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Q: Do you think it makes sense to have a solution like the
Tauzin-Dingell bill (allowing the regional Bell telephone companies
to build high-speed Internet pipelines to businesses and homes
without having to share the lines with competitors or open up their
local markets to greater competition)?</TE>
<TE>   A: I'm kind of neutral on that bill just because they have a lot
of stuff in it, including the hot topic of the day, which is to allow
the Bells into long-distance immediately without really showing there
is new competition for basic telephone service. There is so much in
that bill.</TE>
<TE>   I think it maybe doesn't address the basic issue, which is the
regulatory environment for new investment for new [broadband]
services.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Q: There was a time when high-tech executives were too busy
inventing the future to make a pilgrimage to Washington.</TE>
<TE>   How responsive do you think the government has been to your
industry?Besides broadband, are there other new legislative measures
you think would help it grow?</TE>
<TE>   A: I think a stimulus package could not just help the industry but
could help the U.S. economy.</TE>
<TE>   Probably the strongest part of the stimulus package that helps our
particular part of the industry would be accelerated depreciation of
[information technology] equipment. Broadband is a key issue.</TE>
<TE>   We [also] have a vested interest in the education of scientists
and engineers in the U.S..... The precursor to educating scientists
and engineers is getting kids in K to 12 to understand math and
science.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Q: Are you confident that California has solved its electricity
problems to the point where Intel would consider expanding its
operation in the state?</TE>
<TE>   A: I'm willing to take a wait-and-see attitude about California.</TE>
<TE>   We benefited from a cool summer, which didn't stress the system.
Energy availability and prices have obviously come down ... but I
would like to wait a year or two to see what happens in that space.</TE>
<TE>   We have major expansion plans already targeted in Arizona, where
we've brought out a major facility, and one under construction in
Oregon. And one that probably will recommence, which was kind of
mothballed, in Ireland.</TE>
<TE>   We are not beset with having to make a decision to invest in
growth in California in the short term.</TE>

<HD>Auditors Shielded by Fraud Laws</HD>
<DH>Courts: Protection for advisors from legal risks in such
cases will make it harder for Enron victims to recoup losses.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID G. SAVAGE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Changes made by the Supreme Court and Congress in the mid-1990s to
shield accountants and lawyers from having to pay investors for
massive frauds perpetrated by their clients will make it much harder
for victims of the Enron Corp. scandal to recoup their losses, legal
experts say.</LD>
<LD>   "The legal risk to auditors and lawyers is way down from a decade
ago, and the number of earnings restatements has gone way up," said
Columbia University law professor John C. Coffee.</LD>
<LD>   These days, the prime perpetrators of a fraud still can be held
fully liable for the losses suffered by innocent investors, but
outsiders who gave their official blessing to a questionable scheme
are more protected from legal exposure. And even if they are found
liable for the fraud, they will not be required to cover the full
loss.</LD>
<TE>   Lionel Glancy, a plaintiffs' lawyer in Los Angeles, said the law
is now tilted too far in favor of protecting the "secondary actors"
in a corporate fraud.</TE>
<TE>   "The effect of these changes is to significantly decrease the
ability of investors to recover their losses," Glancy said. "It seems
as though you are more likely to go to jail for stealing three packs
of cigarettes than for causing an investment scheme that results in
$100 million in damages."</TE>
<TE>   Just a decade ago, however, accountants, lawyers and investment
advisors complained the law was tilted unfairly against them.</TE>
<TE>   Then, the government and plaintiffs lawyers cast a wide net and
sought to hold liable all the key participants in a financial fraud.
When dozens of savings and loans institutions crashed in the late
1980s, the accountants and lawyers who were involved in their shaky
deals were sued along with the owners of the thrifts.</TE>
<TE>   In some instances, they ended up paying for most of the losses
because, by the time of a court judgment, the promoter of an
investment fraud typically would be bankrupt.</TE>
<TE>   Determined to change the law, accountants pressed their case in
the courts and Congress. They succeeded on several fronts.</TE>
<TE>   In 1993, the Supreme Court shielded outside accountants, lawyers
and investment bankers from being sued under the federal
anti-racketeering law, known as RICO.</TE>
<TE>   Only the senior managers, not the outside advisors, can be held
liable for a fraud, the justices said in Reves vs. Ernest &amp; Young.
The RICO ruling took away from plaintiffs' lawyers a powerful weapon
that they had used to win big settlements from auditors and law
firms.</TE>
<TE>   The same year, the high court unanimously said federal thrift
regulators may not try to recover money from a law firm that did work
for a bankrupt S&amp;L to repay depositors (O'Melveny &amp; Myers vs. FDIC).</TE>
<TE>   A year later, the court overturned nearly 50 years of precedent
and ruled accountants and lawyers cannot be held liable for "aiding
and abetting" a fraud perpetrated by others.</TE>
<TE>   The justices, by a 5-4 vote, reinterpreted the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934 to conclude it meant to punish only those who directly
deceive investors, not those who aided their effort.</TE>
<TE>   Leaders of the accounting profession praised the ruling (Central
Bank of Denver vs. First Interstate) and said it would "curb the
abuses" of the securities laws. However, a leading plaintiff lawyer
called it a "very dark day" for investors.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, leaders of California's high-tech firms had joined
accountants and corporate executives in urging Congress to erect new
barriers to lawsuits. They said aggressive plaintiffs' lawyers were
going to court whenever their firms' stock price dipped, regardless
of whether the companies had engaged in deception.</TE>
<TE>   In 1995, Congress overrode a veto by President Clinton and passed
the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act. It allowed judges to
throw out suits at the initial stage if they did not "state with
particularity" the facts that would prove a fraud.</TE>
<TE>   Plaintiffs lawyers said they often could not know those
"particular facts" until they were cleared to investigate a case and
examine the company's files.</TE>
<TE>   The new law also shielded auditors by requiring the plaintiffs to
prove they were not just reckless or negligent, but had an "intent to
defraud" the public.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, even if they were found liable in fraud cases, the
auditors were told they would have to pay only their fair share of
the loss, not all the losses that went unpaid.</TE>
<TE>   Clinton said he feared the bill would bar legitimate lawsuits as
well as frivolous claims, and he predicted "innocent people will be
shafted" in financial frauds.</TE>
<TE>   On the day the bill became law, an official of Public Citizen, the
consumer groupfounded by Ralph Nader, predicted the new barriers to
lawsuits would lead to a "slow but mounting financial crime wave."</TE>
<TE>   Experts in securities law differ on whether the recent wave of
accounting debacles can be blamed on the changes in the law.</TE>
<TE>   "You could point to three or four factors behind it," said Coffee,
the Columbia law professor, referring to what he called "an epidemic
of accounting irregularities."</TE>
<TE>   Accountants are less likely to be sued now, and their firms are
also making additional money serving as consultants to the same
corporations that they are auditing, Coffee said.</TE>
<TE>   Enron and its top officers are already facing dozens of lawsuits
from shareholders and others. In addition, Enron's accounting firm,
Andersen, is the subject of several civil suits.</TE>

<HD>ImClone CEO Under Increasing Scrutiny</HD>
<DH>Biotech: Samuel Waksal runs in celebrity circles. But as
lawsuits and probes mount, he is keeping a lower profile.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DENISE GELLENE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The highly public meltdown of ImClone Systems Inc. is casting the
spotlight on Samuel Waksal, an immunologist and erstwhile film
producer as comfortable with celebrities as with cells.</LD>
<LD>   The lanky chief executive, whose company is under investigation
for allegedly misleading investors about its cancer drug, is a
regular on Manhattan's social circuit, where he has been spotted with
Martha Stewart, home decorating queen and mother of his former
girlfriend, Alexis. A recent issue of New York magazine showed Waksal
posing alongside rock star Mick Jagger.</LD>
<LD>   Now, Waksal's social life has become a lightning rod for
investors, who have started to wonder whether there is more style
than substance to ImClone.</LD>
<TE>   At an investment conference sponsored by JP Morgan H&amp;Q two weeks
ago, professional stock pickers shouted, "Stop playing around in the
Hamptons," when Waksal took the podium before a standing-room-only
crowd.</TE>
<TE>   "We screwed up," he admitted.</TE>
<TE>   Waksal, 54, has lowered his profile since trial lawyers began
circling several weeks ago, bombarding his unprofitable New York
company with shareholder suits. They claim ImClone hid important
information from investors, including serious concerns expressed by
the Food and Drug Administration more than a year ago about the
cancer drug Erbitux. The FDA rejected the drug Dec. 28.</TE>
<TE>   "He is devoting all this time to addressing the situation with the
FDA," said spokeswoman Andrea Rabney, adding that Waksal is not
available for interviews.</TE>
<TE>   But claims on Waksal's time are mounting. On Friday, the company
disclosed that it has received inquiries from the Securities and
Exchange Commission and the Justice Department.</TE>
<TE>   The House Energy and Commerce Committee last week said it is
investigating ImClone, including lucrative stock sales by Waksal and
his brother that took place before the FDA rejection.</TE>
<TE>   Bristol-Myers Squibb Co., which has invested $1.2 billion in
ImClone since October, last week wrote off $735 million of its
investment and said it is considering unspecified actions to protect
shareholders.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts speculated that the pharmaceutical company might sue
ImClone or negotiate a deal to get some of its money back.</TE>
<TE>   "We couldn't be more disappointed in this turn of events,"
Bristol-Myers Chairman and Chief Executive Peter Dolan said in a
conference call last week.</TE>
<TE>   ImClone's problems started with the FDA's rejection of an
application to market Erbitux. ImClone blamed record-keeping mistakes
that it hoped to correct by the end of March.</TE>
<TE>   On Jan. 4, an industry publication reported that the FDA's
confidential rejection letter showed that the agency had many
concerns about Erbitux, some of which dated to August 2000. The
Cancer Letter report raised questions about ImClone's truthfulness
with investors.</TE>
<TE>   The FDA, according to the Cancer Letter, said the clinical trials
that ImClone conducted to test Erbitux in cancer patients were not
"adequate and well controlled." The agency told ImClone that new
trials would be needed to show whether Erbitux works. That would
delay any sale of the drug until at least next year; ImClone expected
to sell Erbitux this year.</TE>
<TE>   The company's shares, which traded as high as $75 on Dec. 6 as the
deadline for an FDA decision on Erbitux neared, have been battered by
the continual stream of bad news. ImClone's shares closed Friday at
$16.49 on Nasdaq.</TE>
<TE>   Adding to the controversy is a series of insider transactions.
Last summer, according to regulatory filings, the company lent Waksal
and other insiders $35.2 million so they could exercise stock
options. Talks with Bristol-Myers were well underway at that time but
had not been publicly disclosed.</TE>
<TE>   On July 12, regulatory filings show, Waksal exercised 2.06 million
options at an average of $8.82 a share. His brother, Dr. Harlan
Waksal, who is ImClone's chief operating officer, converted 2.08
million shares that same day at an average share price of $7.57.</TE>
<TE>   ImClone executives and directors, including the Waksal brothers,
together sold 2.1 million shares, or about 20% of their holdings, to
Bristol-Myers on Oct. 29 for $150 million.</TE>
<TE>   Waksal, who received $57 million in the Bristol-Myers transaction,
said the pharmaceutical firm required the brothers to take part in
the tender offer. Bristol-Myers acquired 19.9% of the company at $70
a share as part of a costly deal to obtain U.S. marketing rights to
Erbitux.</TE>
<TE>   On Dec. 6, Harlan Waksal disposed of 700,000 shares, valued at
nearly $72 a share. Waksal told investors that his brother intended
to use the proceeds from the sale to pay taxes incurred when Harlan
Waksal exercised his options and sold his shares to Bristol-Myers.</TE>
<TE>   The brothers had no idea the FDA rejection was coming, Waksal
said, adding: "I haven't slept a wink since that evening."</TE>
<TE>   The crash of ImClone's shares is taking its toll on the Waksals.
On Friday, the company disclosed the brothers sold a significant
portion of their holdings to meet margin calls. Waksal lost 94% of
his ImClone shares, which had been pledged as collateral for loans.
He has exercisable options to purchase 416,666 shares at $50.01 each,
above where ImClone is trading.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Drug's Promise Had Company Riding High</TE>
<TE>   One month ago, ImClone was the toast of the biotechnology
industry, based on the promise of Erbitux.</TE>
<TE>   The 17-year-old New York company had never marketed a drug. But it
had a top-flight board of directors, including Vincent DeVita, a
former head of the National Cancer Institute, and Dr. John
Mendelsohn, president of the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston,
who brought the molecule that became Erbitux to ImClone's attention
in 1992. Dr. Leonard Saltz, a renowned oncologist--a chemotherapy
cocktail for colon cancer is called the "Saltz regimen"--led
ImClone's clinical trials.</TE>
<TE>   ImClone's shares began an upward march after Saltz presented his
findings at a medical conference in May. Of the 121 patients in the
study, he said, 22.5% responded to a combination of Erbitux and
irinotecan, a potent chemotherapy drug. The results looked impressive
because, according to Saltz and ImClone, the patients had not
improved when treated solely with irinotecan, the best drug
available.</TE>
<TE>   ImClone celebrated a successful medical conference by throwing a
party for researchers featuring the Doobie Brothers rock band. Though
it isn't unusual for pharmaceutical companies to entertain physicians
at such conferences, ImClone's bash was in keeping with Waksal's
show-business style.</TE>
<TE>   Waksal co-produced two films, including "The Suicide Club,"
starring Mariel Hemingway. Waksal opened a Manhattan restaurant with
Hemingway's husband, Stephen Crisman, that failed.</TE>
<TE>   New York gossip writers, besides linking him to the
Stewarts--"They're friends," said ImClone spokeswoman Rabney--have
spotted Waksal dining with entertainment lawyer Allen Grubman and
such stars as Matthew Modine.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, Waksal had a cameo role in a failed effort by his
tennis partner, corporate raider Carl Icahn, to seize control of Visx
Inc., the eye surgery company. Waksal was among Icahn's nominees for
Visx's board of directors.</TE>
<TE>   In 1981, Rabney confirmed, Harlan Waksal, then 28, was arrested
for cocaine possession at Fort Lauderdale International Airport in
Florida. He was sentenced to nine years in prison, but the conviction
was overturned on appeal and he served no time. Harlan Waksal, in a
1993 article in Barron's magazine, described the incident as "a
dramatic mistake in judgment."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Analysts, Others Begin to Doubt Research</TE>
<TE>   Beginning last fall, some people began questioning ImClone's
research, casting doubt on the company's management and raising
issues later cited by the FDA.</TE>
<TE>   David Hines, an analyst with Avalon Research Group in Florida, was
unconvinced that irinotecan had failed to work for all patients in
the trial. He noted that the patients, on average, received Erbitux
with irinotecan 54 days after their last chemotherapy treatment. "It
is widely accepted that a break in chemotherapy may allow patient
re-sensitization" to the drug, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, the FDA said it could not tell from ImClone's data which
drug was responsible for the tumor shrinkage--a key reason Erbitux
was rejected, according to ImClone.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, there were indications that Erbitux alone was not very
effective. Eric Sharps of FourSquare Partners, a stock research firm
in Los Altos, Calif., said a 1999 ImClone experiment with renal
cancer patients was a red flag. Just three of 54 patients in that
test showed modest improvement from Erbitux.</TE>
<TE>   "This was a very good target for the drug and there was basically
no improvement," Sharps said.</TE>
<TE>   Waksal told investors two weeks ago that, at the request of the
FDA, ImClone conducted an experiment to test the effectiveness of
Erbitux alone. Of the 57 colon cancer patients, 10.5% improved on the
drug. But people familiar with the FDA's review process doubted the
agency would be impressed by the numbers.</TE>
<TE>   "The FDA wants to see large positive results," said Dr. Kimberly
Margolin, a City of Hope National Medical Center oncologist and
former member of an FDA committee that reviews cancer drug
applications.</TE>
<TE>   In a note to clients Friday, Thomas Weisel Partners analyst
Patrick Mooney warned of a continuing gloomy outlook for ImClone. "We
see very little possibility of Erbitux ... being salvaged without
another trial," he said.</TE>
<TE>   But ImClone director Mendelsohn, who also is a member of Enron
Corp.'s board--a coincidence, he said--believes that ImClone will
recover from what he describes as a setback and that Erbitux will be
approved. "I have to believe the data exists" to satisfy the FDA
without a new trial, he said.</TE>
<TE>   He isn't the only optimist. Dr. Douglas D. Lind, an analyst with
Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, had a "buy" recommendation on ImClone
last week. And Jim McCamant of Moors &amp; Cabot Dakin said the
investigations will allow ImClone to clear the air. It isn't unusual
for small biotech companies to botch clinical trials, he added.</TE>
<TE>   "We're rolling up our sleeves," said Mendelsohn, a key player in
the company's attempt at damage control. "I'm very happy with
ImClone."</TE>

<HD>Canada Rivals to Form New Oil, Gas Giant</HD>
<DH>Energy: PanCanadian and AEC are in merger talks to create
the No. 1 independent producer, valued at $13 billion.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>CALGARY, Alberta</DL>
<LD>PanCanadian Energy Corp. is buying Alberta Energy Co. in a share swap
to create what they said Sunday would be the world's No. 1 publicly
traded independent oil and gas exploration and production company,
with a stock market value of $13.3 billion.</LD>
<LD>   PanCanadian, already Canada's top explorer and producer, and AEC,
the No. 2 player in that part of the industry, described the deal as
a merger of equals that would bring together the highest oil and gas
output and biggest reserves of all publicly traded independent energy
firms.</LD>
<LD>   The merged company, to be called EnCana Corp., would have debt and
other liabilities valued at $3.9 billion.</LD>
<TE>   The Calgary-based firms said Friday that they were in talks after
sharp gains in the stock prices prompted the Toronto Stock Exchange
to demand an explanation.</TE>
<TE>   EnCana would supplant Houston-based Anadarko Petroleum Corp. as
the top exploration and production player amid a slump in prices for
both oil and natural gas. But the combined entity still would be
smaller than the major oil companies that also refine oil and market
gasoline, such as Exxon Mobil of the U.S. and BP of Britain.</TE>
<TE>   The merged company would enjoy a commanding Canadian base,
supporting efforts to compete globally and erase a stock market
discount that the country's oil companies have suffered in comparison
to U.S. rivals, they said.</TE>
<TE>   A PanCanadian-AEC merger would follow last year's flood of deals
in which big Canadian producers, such as Gulf Canada Resources and
Anderson Exploration, were taken over by U.S. rivals.</TE>
<TE>   "Why shouldn't two Canadian companies come together and build up a
powerhouse?" AEC Chief Executive Gwyn Morgan said at a news
conference. "It's not a question of waiting for someone to come and
see if they want to buy either one of us. This is a chance to build
something that's stronger and better than anyone else can build."</TE>
<TE>   Under the deal, Alberta Energy stockholders would get 1.472
PanCanadian shares for each of their own shares. PanCanadian holders
would own about 54% of EnCana and AEC's investors the remainder. The
ratio is based on the average of the closing price for the 10 trading
days ended Jan. 23.</TE>
<TE>   Morgan would be chief executive of EnCana, and PanCanadian CEO
David O'Brien, who in October completed the breakup of the company's
former parent, Canadian Pacific Ltd., would be nonexecutive chairman.
PanCanadian became widely held after it was spun off, sparking talk
that it could be a bid target.</TE>
<TE>   EnCana's top management and board of directors would have equal
representation from both companies, the executives said.</TE>

<HD>Verizon to Introduce High-Speed Network</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Washington Post</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Verizon Wireless today plans to roll out one of the nation's first
high-speed wireless data networks, an introductory version of a
much-heralded technology allowing faster Internet access from mobile
phones and laptop computers.</LD>
<LD>   The debut of Verizon's Express Network comes as the nation's
largest wireless companies race to build third-generation networks,
doing for mobile communications what cable modem and DSL service has
done for land lines.</LD>
<LD>   Verizon's service initially will be available along the East Coast
from Norfolk, Va., to Boston, and includes the San Francisco Bay Area
and Portland, Maine.</LD>
<TE>   The new third-generation networks would allow people to one day
use their cell phones to send and receive songs, movies and games,
supporters say. Initially, the biggest benefits will likely be
allowing customers to download e-mail with attachments and play
games.</TE>

<HD>Fed Is Expected to Halt Rate Cutting</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>First, the good news for stocks: The Federal Reserve is expected to
say this week that it's done with its rate-cutting spree, hinting at
an economic recovery to come, and nudging the equity market higher.</LD>
<LD>   Now the bad news: Mixed signals on the economy, weak corporate
earnings and lukewarm profit forecasts will cast a pall on Wall
Street's mood, pulling stocks in the opposite direction.</LD>
<LD>   The result: Experts forecast a virtually unchanged market.</LD>
<TE>   The Fed's policy-setting committee meets Tuesday and Wednesday for
the first time this year. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan has
hinted that the central bank will put an end, for now at least, to
the aggressive rate cutting that drove short-term interest rates to
40-year lows.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, Wall Street pros expect the market to seesaw in the
days ahead as investors grapple with the question of whether stocks
are too pricey--given the market's strong run late last year, tepid
earnings forecasts and inconsistent economic data.</TE>
<TE>   Although more than half of the companies in the S&amp;P 500 have
issued their corporate report cards, a torrent of results is on its
way. Tech giant Texas Instruments and two blue-chip names--American
Express Co. and Walt Disney Co.--are scheduled to report earnings
this week.</TE>

<TE>   The economic calendar is crowded this week.</TE>
<TE>   * Tuesday, the Conference Board's consumer confidence report will
be closely watched as an indicator of whether Americans will keep
spending. The main index is expected to rise to 96.9 in January from
93.7 in December.</TE>
<TE>   * Tuesday, new orders for durable goods are expected to show a
1.3% gain in December, compared with a drop of 4.8% in November. The
report will be awaited anxiously for clues on whether the
recession-strapped manufacturing sector is starting to recover.</TE>
<TE>   * Wednesday, the government will give its advance estimate of
fourth-quarter GDP. Economists in a Reuters survey estimated
fourth-quarter GDP dropped 1%, marking a second straight quarter of
contraction in U.S. growth. Two consecutive quarters of decline are
widely seen as the official stamp of a recession.</TE>
<TE>   * Thursday, investors will look at personal income and spending
data for hints on whether consumers are keeping up their pace.
Personal income is expected to show a 0.3% rise in December; spending
is forecast down 0.1%.</TE>
<TE>   * Friday, Wall Street will scrutinize the crucial jobs data. U.S.
payrolls are expected to have shed 27,000 jobs in January, according
to economists polled by Reuters, following a drop of 124,000 in
December. Economists estimated the unemployment rate rose to 5.9% in
January from 5.8% in December.</TE>

<LD>Advanced Micro Devices Inc., the No.2 maker of microprocessors that

highest-performing chip for laptop computers as the company seeks to
gain share in that market.</LD>
<LD>   The Sunnyvale, Calif.-based company's Athlon 4 1500+ processor
runs at 1.3 gigahertz, meaning that the tiny transistors that
comprise a semiconductor can cycle on and off 1.3 billion times a

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>RioPort Inc. has taken its first significant step toward offering
music online via subscription, obtaining a license to BMG's catalog
of songs. The deal, expected to be announced today, is the second
this month by BMG, one of the five largest record companies and home
to such artists as Whitney Houston and the Foo Fighters.</LD>
<LD>   Before BMG announced a deal with Listen.com on Jan. 8, it had not
licensed songs to any subscription music service it did not own.</LD>
<LD>   San Jose-based RioPort plans to launch a subscription service by
March 30, but has provided few details about features or price. The
service will enable subscribers to download music, as well as listen
to songs from online jukeboxes.</LD>
<TE>   Competing online services don't let subscribers move songs they
rent off their computers, but RioPort's technology allows rented
songs to be copied to portable devices that use its new software. No
devices on the market have that software yet, but Samsung Corp.,
Sanyo Electric Co. and SonicBlue Inc.--the leading investor in
RioPort--have demonstrated portable players with the technology.
Terms of the deal weren't disclosed.</TE>

<HD>PwC Consulting Chief Hartz Resigns</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>PricewaterhouseCoopers, the largest accounting firm, said Scott Hartz
resigned as chief executive of its PwC Consulting arm and was
replaced by Thomas O'Neill, formerly the firm's chief operating
officer.</LD>
<LD>   O'Neill's appointment was made by Samuel A. DiPiazza Jr.,
Pricewaterhouse's global CEO, said Sehra Eusufzai, a spokeswoman for
the firm. Eusufzai said she didn't have information on the reason for
Hartz's departure. Eusufzai said Friday that Hartz will stay at the
firm long enough for a reasonable transition.</LD>
<LD>   Hartz joined Pricewaterhouse in 1970 and became a partner in
charge of the firm's U.S. southeast and mid-Atlantic regions,
according to a biography on the firm's Web site.</LD>
<TE>   Neither Hartz nor O'Neill could immediately be reached for
comment.</TE>
<TE>   Hartz's departure comes as the U.S. accounting industry faces
greater scrutiny after Enron Corp.'s collapse and reports that its
auditor, Andersen, helped the Houston energy trader conceal debt and
destroyed Enron-related documents.</TE>
<TE>   One issue that regulators are probing is whether accounting firms'
dual roles as auditor and consultant jeopardize the independence of
their audits. Andersen made $27 million from nonaudit work for Enron
in 2000, more than the $25 million it was paid as auditor.</TE>
<TE>   "The likelihood that Congress will force the divestiture of at
least some consulting activities by the major accounting firms has
certainly been increased by the Enron debacle," said Richard Breeden,
a former chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission.</TE>
<TE>   He added that both Congress and the public are more sensitive to
the "substantial conflicts of interest built into the current
structure of the Big Five" accounting firms.</TE>
<TE>   Although Breeden said he doesn't know Hartz and isn't aware of the
reason for his departure, Breeden said it's reasonable to expect
limits on audit firms' consulting role.</TE>
<TE>   "Consulting partners who work for audit firms are probably worried
their business could be affected down the road if Congress adopts
restrictions or if the business community decides it's not healthy to
buy their consulting services from consulting arms of audit firms,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   PwC Consulting had revenue of $6.7 billion for the year ended June
30, representing about 30% of Pricewaterhouse's total revenue of
$22.3 billion. The unit has more than 35,000 consultants and does
work for more than half the Fortune Global 500 companies, according
to the firm's Web site.</TE>
<TE>   Accounting firms are eager to sell consulting services to clients
because they're more profitable than auditing services.</TE>

<HD>UC Regents Call for Enron Trustee</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Two of Enron Corp.'s creditors asked a judge to strip the company's
top management of power by ordering an independent trustee to run the
energy trader as it reorganizes under the largest-ever Chapter 11
bankruptcy filing.</LD>
<LD>   The Regents of the University of California and the Absolute
Recovery Hedge Fund said in court papers filed late Friday that
Enron's "management has inherent conflicts of interest" that are
detrimental to the Houston-based company.</LD>
<LD>   They asked U.S. Bankruptcy Judge Arthur J. Gonzalez in Manhattan
to name a trustee who would supplant the company's top officers and
its board of directors.</LD>
<TE>   "It is clear that Enron's current directors, officers and managers
mismanaged Enron prior to the bankruptcy filings and continues such
mismanagement after the filing," the creditors said.</TE>
<TE>   Enron representatives Karen Denne and Mark Palmer could not
immediately be reached for comment.</TE>
<TE>   The UC system lost nearly $145million investing in Enron. The
university system is among several plaintiffs suing Enron, citing
fraud and seeking restitution.</TE>
<TE>   After disclosures of overstated earnings and off-balance-sheet
financing, Enron shares plummeted last fall.</TE>
<TE>   Under bankruptcy laws, creditors must demonstrate that there has
been mismanagement, incompetence or fraud to have a Chapter 11
trustee appointed.</TE>
<TE>   Enron Chairman and Chief Executive Kenneth L. Lay resigned last
week amid pressure from the creditors. Enron said it plans to name a
turnaround specialist to run the company until a permanent
replacement for Lay is found.</TE>
<TE>   The UC Regents and the Absolute Recovery Hedge Fund said in the
filing that the naming of a new top executive would not solve Enron's
problems.</TE>

<HD>Employer Stock Still Dominates 401(k) Mix</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LIZ PULLIAM WESTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Enron Corp. debacle apparently has failed to convince the average
worker of the dangers of owning too much of their employer's stock in
a 401(k) retirement account.</LD>
<LD>   Employees as a whole have not moved their money out of company
shares in the two months since Enron's bankruptcy wiped out about
$1billion of its workers' retirement money, said Hewitt Associates,
which tracks daily changes in 401(k) plans used by 1.5million
participants.</LD>
<LD>   Fidelity Investments, the nation's largest 401(k) plan provider
with 7.9 million participants, said it has seen no indication that
workers are buying less company stock with their 401(k) contributions
or are shifting their existing investments away from company shares.
Other plan providers, including the Vanguard Group and T. Rowe Price
Group, reported similar findings.</LD>
<TE>   "Most participants are looking at [Enron] as a pretty unique and
isolated incident," said Bill McNabb, managing director for
Vanguard's institutional investor group.</TE>
<TE>   The percentage of company stock in plans that offered such shares
peaked at 35% in 1999, then declined to about 30% by September, where
it has remained ever since. Hewitt and other experts believe the
overall stock market decline, rather than worker distaste for company
shares, was responsible for much of the slide from 1999 to 2001.</TE>
<TE>   The lack of movement since then underscores workers' attachment to
their companies' shares, despite financial planners' warnings that no
more than 10% to 20% of a worker's retirement portfolio should be
tied up in their employer's stock. Employees' refusal to diversify is
largely due to inertia and overconfidence about their companies'
prospects, investor and consumer advocates say.</TE>
<TE>   "They think, 'The company I work for is stable, it's growing, why
shouldn't I put my faith in that?'" said T. Rowe Price spokesman
Brian Lewbart. "That sort of logic makes some sense, but it also
flies in the face of the overall diversification message."</TE>
<TE>   In a 401(k) plan, workers save for retirement by contributing part
of their paychecks to a tax-deferred account, and those contributions
often are matched by the employer. The amount of money the worker has
in retirement depends on how well the investments in the 401(k)
perform--in contrast to traditional pensions, which guarantee a set
payment in retirement.</TE>
<TE>   Many workers have turned their 401(k) funds into gambling casinos,
making big bets on their company stock in hopes of striking it
rich--not fully realizing that such bets can go wrong and leave them
without enough money to retire on, said Karen Friedman, director of
policy strategies for the Pension Rights Center, a consumer group in
Washington.</TE>
<TE>   Friedman said employees' failure to diversify means that lawmakers
may have to step in to limit company stock in 401(k)s. Such
limitations already are placed on the managers of traditional
corporate pension plans.</TE>
<TE>   But companies and many employees insist that big retirement
investments in company stock aren't always irrational.</TE>
<TE>   T. Rowe Price's Lewbart, for example, said a significant amount of
his own family's net worth is invested in the shares of his wife's
company: Citigroup Inc.</TE>
<TE>   Lewbart said he understands the need for diversification, but also
cites the reasons many other employees use for investing in company
stock in a 401(k): He and his wife have a high tolerance for risk,
confidence in the company and a history of good returns from the
stock.</TE>
<TE>   High returns have helped prompt employees at General Electric Co.
to invest 77% of the 401(k) assets in company stock, said company
spokesman David Frail.</TE>
<TE>   GE's shares grew at a 33% annual pace from 1995 to mid-2001, a
performance that boosted the value of employees' 401(k) investments
and encouraged them to contribute more, Frail said. Since then, the
shares have lost about 28% of their value, compared with a 13% drop
in the benchmark Standard &amp; Poor's 500.</TE>
<TE>   Like many other companies, GE contends that its employees' risk is
lessened by the presence of a traditional pension plan. These plans
have lost favor with many employers, but they still are offered by
big firms that have company stock in their 401(k) plans.</TE>
<TE>   Once the value of GE's pension is taken into account, just 20% of
the average worker's retirement portfolio is invested in GE stock,
Frail said.</TE>
<TE>   Having a traditional pension generally means that investors can
take a bigger gamble in their 401(k)s, since they won't have to rely
entirely on their own investment acumen to fund their retirement,
Vanguard's McNabb said.</TE>
<TE>   "If [the workers] make money in their 401(k), that's just icing on
the cake," he said.</TE>
<TE>   But the number of firms that offer both 401(k)s and pensions is
declining. A Hewitt survey of large companies that offer 401(k)s
found that 54% also offered pensions last year, down from 67% in
1999.</TE>
<TE>   But workers at companies that provide pension plans may not
qualify for benefits, Friedman of the Pension Rights Center said.</TE>
<TE>   Employees typically don't qualify for pension benefits for five
years or more, and full benefits--which can replace 20% to 70% of a
worker's salary--can take 20 years or more to earn, assuming the
employer doesn't change the plan in the meantime.</TE>
<TE>   Investments in company shares aren't always strictly voluntary.
General Electric and Exxon match their workers' contributions with
cash, but some companies make matching contributions in company
shares, as Enron did. Enron and other companies also restrict
employees from selling those shares--typically until age 50 or 55,
although some plans don't allow company stock sales until retirement.</TE>
<TE>   Many retirement plan experts, along with legislators and even some
companies, question the wisdom of such restrictions, given the Enron
fallout.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of companies are examining the way they match
[contributions], and whether they should allow employees to diversify
more quickly" by ending restrictions on selling company shares,
Vanguard's McNabb said.</TE>
<TE>   One company that isn't contemplating changes is Philips
Electronics. The New York-based subsidiary of Amsterdam's Koninklijke
Philips Electronics has avoided offering company shares in its 401(k)
plans--despite pleas from workers at some of the high-tech firms
Philips has acquired over the years, said Lisa Pyne, the company's
benefits director.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a culture of stock ownership in high-tech firms," Pyne
said. "But we want to make sure our employees diversify their
assets."</TE>

<HD>Reducing Risk in Your 401(k)</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Liz Pulliam Weston</AU>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Enron Corp.'s bankruptcy has highlighted some of the risks of owning
company stock in a retirement plan. Financial planners recommend the
following steps to help reduce risk:</LD>
<LD>   * Curb your enthusiasm. No company's future is entirely secure.
You may believe in your company's long-term prospects, but remember
that both your job and your retirement are at stake if you make a big
bet in company stock. A diversified portfolio is likely to give you
good returns with lower risk than a gamble on a single stock.</LD>
<LD>   * Limit your risk. Aim for a total investment portfolio that has
no more than 10% to 20% in company stock. Include in your
calculations retirement plans, employee purchase plans and the value
of any stock you bought with employee options. The less secure your
job or your company, the fewer shares you should hold. You can aim
for 20% if your job and company are secure and you're covered by a
pension.</LD>
<TE>   * Don't invest on autopilot. At least twice a year, monitor your
accounts and--if you can--sell company shares if their value exceeds
10% to 20% of your portfolio. Some employers restrict their workers'
ability to sell shares issued as a company match, but most allow
sales of shares purchased with employee contributions.</TE>
<TE>   * Invest outside your 401(k). If you can't sell enough shares to
lower your company stock exposure to acceptable levels, consider
reducing contributions to your 401(k) and instead invest up to $3,000
a year in an individual retirement account or a Roth IRA. These
accounts allow you to invest in other stocks or in mutual funds,
although you may not get a tax deduction for your contribution.</TE>

<HD>SAG Election Is a Drama Straight out of Hollywood</HD>
<DH>Unions: Panel's decision to scrap November vote, triggers
accusations that it's a disguised coup.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES BATES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When it comes to scripting long, drawn-out cliffhangers, it's hard to
compete with the Screen Actors Guild.</LD>
<LD>   Last November, the 98,000-member union elected new leaders
including actress Melissa Gilbert as president, who vowed to try to
heal long-standing rifts between aggressive activists and pragmatic
moderates that have plagued the guild for three years .</LD>
<LD>   Or so it looked. This month, a five-member SAG elections committee
in Los Angeles scrapped last fall's results when it was discovered
that New York members had two extra days to vote and the company
printing East Coast ballots failed to include a signature line like
those on ballots sent to members elsewhere.</LD>
<TE>   So a new election has been scheduled: SAG plans to mail out new
ballots Feb. 11, to be returned by March 8.</TE>
<TE>   A backlash to that decision is growing that threatens to further
divide a union in which chaos and factional wars are so common that
some members lately have called the union that represents TV, film
and commercial actors Hollywood's equivalent of Afghanistan. "This is
tragic when one considers the impact this has on people's impressions
of what our union is," said Mike Farrell, SAG's first vice president,
best known for starring in "MASH."</TE>
<TE>   In the last two weeks, fax machines, e-mails and Web sites have
buzzed with accusations that scrapping the election violates SAG
rules, was done over minor technicalities that did not influence the
end result and that the decision to rerun the vote is a coup attempt
in disguise by supporters of defeated presidential candidate Valerie
Harper. Gilbert defeated Harper by more than 1,500 votes out of about
28,000 cast.</TE>
<TE>   Critics further complain that a new election will cost the
financially strapped guild at least $100,000.</TE>
<TE>   "The membership is infuriated," said child-actor activist Paul
Petersen, a SAG member since the 1950s, when he starred in "The Donna
Reed Show."</TE>
<TE>   Petersen has petitioned to have SAG's board of directors consider
overturning the decision when they meet today, although the board
isn't obligated to do so. Some other members are threatening to file
a complaint with the Department of Labor, possibly as early as this
week.</TE>
<TE>   In its Jan. 7 decision, the SAG elections committee, chaired by
actor Fred Savage, contended that a new election was needed as long
as voting irregularities potentially could have affected the outcome,
arguing that elections can't have separate voting deadlines for
members. SAG said that under its rules the committee's decision is
final and a new election will be held.</TE>
<TE>   RadioFreeFacts.com, a Web site devoted to SAG issues, recently
posted an extensive critique of the decision, saying that the
different voting deadlines have been the norm for years and that
Gilbert gained no advantage.</TE>
<TE>   It also says the elections committee was made up only of Los
Angeles members, so it didn't represent SAG members nationwide, and
that all were active Harper supporters, including Savage and actress
Sally Kirkland. A SAG spokeswoman said no committee members would
comment.</TE>
<TE>   But Harper, best known for starring in the 1970s hit "Rhoda,"
calls the decision a victory for integrity, insisting it isn't about
trying to get her another shot at the job.</TE>
<TE>   "It was never simply about a recount with Melissa," Harper said.
"The issue was that the election was tainted. It was botched and the
mistakes in the November election were so serious they cast a serious
doubt on the results."</TE>
<TE>   Gilbert, who became a star during the 1970s with "Little House on
the Prairie," so far has refrained from commenting. She did issue one
brief statement saying "election issues will take care of themselves.
I am not going to make the process more difficult or complicated by
commenting."</TE>
<TE>   In addition to Gilbert's post, the new election affects SAG's two
other national offices: treasurer, won by actor Kent McCord, and
recording secretary, won by Elliott Gould.</TE>
<TE>   Gould won handily, defeating Kevin Kilner by more than 5,000
votes. McCord's race was the closest, winning by 34 votes against
actress Amy Aquino.</TE>
<TE>   Despite winning, McCord and Gould, who ran on Harper's ticket,
joined Harper in appealing the election along with a group of other
SAG members.</TE>
<TE>   The election fiasco is set against a backdrop of an ongoing
struggle for control of the guild activists who believe that SAG
needs to flex its muscle more and pragmatists who believe a measured
approach accomplishes more.</TE>
<TE>   In 1999, a group of activists led by actor William Daniels ousted
a moderate regime led by actor Richard Masur, arguing that SAG had
been too tame in contract negotiations. The following year, Daniels
led SAG on a six-month strike against advertisers that supporters
call a resounding success and critics say was a colossal failure.</TE>
<TE>   Harper was Daniels' hand-picked successor, pledging to continue
his policies. Gilbert argued that Harper was a puppet of the Daniels
regime, which she said had worsened SAG's problems.</TE>
<TE>   The election turned into a nasty campaign, with both sides
regularly hurling insults.</TE>
<TE>   Now, another bitter election, which also includes presidential
candidates Eugene Boggs and Angeltompkins, is starting again.</TE>
<TE>   Last fall, Harper, who is starring in the Broadway play "The Tale
of the Allergist's Wife," spurned a challenge from Gilbert to debate.
Miffed at Gilbert's criticisms that she was ducking her, Harper last
week faxed a debate challenge to Gilbert.</TE>
<TE>   Gilbert has yet to respond, but is expected to accept.</TE>

<HD>Can Firm Dock Pay for Mistakes?</HD>
<DH></DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Question: I work for an employer that pays both an hourly wage and
commission. It is a common practice here to deduct income as a
reprimand for mistakes.</LD>
<LD>   Is this legal?</LD>
<LD>   --S.F., Huntington Beach</LD>
<TE>   Answer: It is illegal for an employer to deduct income for your
mistakes, even if you are negligent. The employer is responsible for
business losses.</TE>
<TE>   However, if your mistake was the result of intentional misconduct
or gross negligence, then the employer may be justified in docking
your income.</TE>
<TE>   And even if the employer can't dock you for mistakes involving
simple negligence, you can still be fired or disciplined.</TE>

<TE>   Employee rights attorney</TE>
<TE>   Mission Viejo</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Company Can Require  Bank Account Numbers</TE>
<TE>   Q: My employer's new online system for processing travel expense
reports reimburses employees through direct deposits to their bank
accounts.</TE>
<TE>   This requires employees to provide their bank account numbers to
the company.</TE>
<TE>   If an employee does not provide this information, he or she cannot
travel on company business.</TE>
<TE>   Is it legal for an employer to require its employees to provide
personal information such as a bank account number?</TE>
<TE>   --A.E., Lakewood</TE>
<TE>   A: Yes, it is legal to require you to provide such information.</TE>
<TE>   Although as an employee you do have a right of privacy, that right
is not absolute.</TE>
<TE>   Here, the employer's interest in streamlining its
expense-reimbursement procedures would appear to outweigh your
privacy interests.</TE>

<TE>   Paul, Hastings, Janofsky &amp; Walker</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Employer Can Choose How to Treat Leave Time</TE>
<TE>   Q: Upon my return to work from maternity and family leave, my
employer paid my vacation time in one lump sum, per union and company
guidelines.</TE>
<TE>   However, last year another employee took maternity leave and was
allowed to keep her vacation time instead of receiving a lump sum.</TE>
<TE>   Do I have any recourse? I want my vacation days returned, but the
company refuses.</TE>
<TE>   --C.H., Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   A: Neither state nor federal laws require an employer to provide
employees with paid vacation time. Likewise, no law dictates how an
employer must handle accrued leave time for employees on leaves of
absence.</TE>
<TE>   Employers are free to handle these situations as they choose, as
long as they do not discriminate on some illegal basis such as an
employee's age, sex, pregnancy, religion, national origin,
disability, medical condition or sexual orientation.</TE>
<TE>   Employers also can treat different employees differently, unless
they are doing so for a discriminatory reason.</TE>
<TE>   For example, it is common for employers to provide managerial
employees with greater benefits and greater flexibility on using
those benefits than they provide lower-level employees.</TE>
<TE>   I suggest you contact your union representative to discuss your
concerns. He or she may be able to explain why you were required to
use your benefits or may be able to persuade management to reinstate
your vacation.</TE>
<TE>   Unless you can prove that your employer had a discriminatory
motive for the way it treated you, however, you would not have any
legal recourse.</TE>
<TE>   --Diane J. Crumpacker</TE>
<TE>   Management law attorney</TE>
<TE>   Fried, Bird &amp; Crumpacker</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Often Illegal for Firm to Withhold Commissions</TE>
<TE>   Q: Our employer has told us that if we are fired or decide to
quit, he is going to keep any commissions due us.</TE>
<TE>   He made us sign a document stating this and told us that his
lawyer checked and determined that it is legal.</TE>
<TE>   Is it?</TE>
<TE>   --T.R., Riverside</TE>
<TE>   A: If your employer is keeping commissions that you have earned,
the answer is no, it is not legal.</TE>
<TE>   In other words, if you have done everything that is required to
earn the commission, your employer simply can't keep it because you
quit or were fired.</TE>
<TE>   However, if there is additional work to be done to complete the
sale, or if all of the conditions for receiving the commission have
not been met--the customer has not yet paid, for example--your
employer may be entitled to withhold all or a portion of the
commission.</TE>

<HD>Squeeze Is On</HD>
<DH>Competition has taken a bite out of Sunkist sales.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MELINDA FULMER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With 108 years in the citrus business, Sunkist Growers has created a
brand so powerful it can sell more than 600 products around the
world, everything from jelly beans to vitamins to orange soda.</LD>
<LD>   But when it comes to oranges, just having a well-known brand is no
longer enough. Sunkist is fighting for its competitive life.</LD>
<LD>   Foreign-grown fruit is eating into Sunkist's U.S. market share.
Consumers are finding a much wider variety of choices in the
supermarket produce aisle. Slumping citrus prices and rising costs
are squeezing Sunkist member-growers' profits.</LD>
<TE>   And with a bloated, inefficient organizational structure, growers
say, Sunkist has found it hard to move as quickly as some of its
smaller competitors.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a challenging time for all of produce right now," said
Sunkist President Jeffrey Gargiulo, recently brought in to breathe
new life into the mighty brand after years of inexperienced and
temporary management.</TE>
<TE>   His biggest challenge is to convince supermarkets that the
cooperative's products still are worth paying a premium price for.</TE>
<TE>   Such pressure would have been unthinkable a few years ago, when
fruit from Sherman Oaks-based Sunkist was a fixture in supermarket
produce aisles and consumers around the world saw its brand as
synonymous with oranges and lemons. Sunkist's marketing might brought
California citrus to consumers from Canada to Japan, making it a
model for American export prowess.</TE>
<TE>   With its dominant position in the marketplace, the marketing
cooperative reaped a healthy profit, which it funneled back to its
6,000 grower owners in California and Arizona. Although Sunkist is
self-supporting, in recent years its growers have struggled and some
of its contract packers that distribute its fruit have closed their
doors.</TE>
<TE>   Today the organization is still the market leader, representing
60% of the citrus production in California and Arizona. But it must
work much harder to convince retailers its fruit is special.</TE>
<TE>   That's partly because citrus has more competition than ever.
Supermarkets have added new items to cater to a greater range of
ethnic tastes and are importing more produce to ensure that shoppers
can get their favorite fruit out of season. Convenience items, such
as pre-cut vegetables, baby carrots, fresh herbs and bagged salads,
also have stolen more shelf space.</TE>
<TE>   Competition has become particularly fierce during the summer
months. Sunkist's Valencia oranges compete not only against Florida
oranges, but against California peaches, plums, nectarines and
melons, Australian and Israeli oranges, and Spanish tangerines and
mandarins.</TE>
<TE>   Navel oranges, grown in winter and spring, have traditionally had
less seasonal competition. But even navels have been losing ground to
imported fruit, such as the seedless, easy-to-peel clementines from
Spain.</TE>
<TE>   With the quality of imported fruit rising, shoppers these days
care less about where a product comes from, says Karen Caplan,
president of specialty fruit marketer Frieda's Inc. in Los Alamitos.</TE>
<TE>   The bottom line for most people, industry observers say, is how
much fruit costs and how well it tastes.</TE>
<TE>   When it comes to taste, American shoppers are increasingly finding
California navel oranges somewhat wanting. That's partly because the
best fruit is shipped abroad, leaving lesser-quality fruit in local
supermarkets. "The quality could be better," Caplan said.</TE>
<TE>   "People pick up the best item they see, regardless of brand," said
Kathy Means, vice president of the Produce Marketing Assn.</TE>
<TE>   If greater competition wasn't enough, the handful of giant
supermarket chains--formed through mergers in recent years--are using
their clout to demand lower prices for Sunkist and other fruit.</TE>
<TE>   "We always prefer U.S.-grown product, except if the product isn't
available or is out of season," said Jack Brown, chairman of Stater
Bros. Markets, a Colton-based regional chain. But "it has to be
fairly comparable in price [to imported fruit]. The quality of
foreign-grown produce has improved greatly."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Turning Up the Volume on Marketing Efforts</TE>
<TE>   To persuade retailers to continue to pay more for the Sunkist
brand, the cooperative's marketing officials have put together
special research telling retailers where its navel oranges and other
fruit sell best, and how they must be packaged and displayed to get
more shoppers to buy them.</TE>
<TE>   Sunkist marketers also are putting together splashy displays that
dispense recipes and tell shoppers why Sunkist citrus is healthier
than some other fruit.</TE>
<TE>   The cooperative also is negotiating with a celebrity chef to
promote Sunkist citrus on his or her television cooking show as an
ingredient, rather than as a garnish. Sunkist is test-marketing new,
more expensive products, such as pre-peeled, pre-sectioned oranges
that last 12 days in their container.</TE>
<TE>   "I think our brand is still very strong and we have some great
opportunities ahead of us," Gargiulo said.</TE>
<TE>   However, Gargiulo is hedging his marketing bets by negotiating to
import some products, such as lemons from Chile, and sell them under
the Sunkist label. This plan hasn't made him popular with Ventura
County lemon growers, who will see their sales slacken at the end of
their season as imported fruit enters the market.</TE>
<TE>   But, Gargiulo says, the deal will add to the cooperative's bottom
line, enabling Sunkist's U.S. growers to profit from the new, more
competitive realities of the produce business.</TE>
<TE>   Over the last five years, Sunkist and the rest of the U.S. citrus
industry have seen their share of the world market drop steeply,
while countries such as China and Australia have upped production.</TE>
<TE>   His own company, Gargiulo Inc., which was purchased by Monsanto
Corp. in 1997, commanded a 10% share of the U.S. tomato market by
producing fruit in Mexico, Puerto Rico and Chile as well as in the
U.S.</TE>
<TE>   Gargiulo faces other challenges as well.</TE>
<TE>   One of them is a bloated management structure. Sunkist has seen
its market share stolen by smaller, more nimble U.S. competitors who
don't have to wade through a lengthy board approval process to
institute small changes in their businesses.</TE>
<TE>   "We've been slow to adapt to what our customers want," Gargiulo
said. For example, he said, Sunkist didn't move fast enough to
distribute its fruit into such discount retailers as Costco and
Wal-Mart, which have taken a bigger share of the U.S. grocery
business.</TE>
<TE>   It took years, he said, just to get around to making the
easy-to-carry cardboard crates of fruit that some retailers were
demanding.</TE>
<TE>   To streamline the cooperative, Gargiulo closed eight of Sunkist's
32 sales offices this year, many of which were in cities without a
major produce terminal market. And, he says, more could be closed as
the company reorganizes and retrains employees.</TE>
<TE>   He also has announced his intention to whittle down Sunkist's huge
board and add some directors from outside the industry.</TE>
<TE>   But perhaps his biggest challenge will be reversing the profit
squeeze growers have felt amid rising production costs and falling
prices. Profit margins are so thin, growers say, it takes a bumper
crop of large, sweet fruit just to have a decent year.</TE>
<TE>   The industry's economic problems started in the 1998-99 growing
season, when much of California's orange crop was destroyed. The next
year, the poor quality of California oranges put a bad taste in the
mouths of retailers, who stocked more imported fruit in response.</TE>
<TE>   "Our industry has had less-than-satisfactory returns ever since
that time," said Joel Nelsen, president of the California Citrus
Mutual trade group.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Growers May Not Get a Reprieve This Year</TE>
<TE>   This year isn't looking that great either. Although larger,
sweeter fruit are commanding higher prices, growers' yields were
small because of a heat wave. Thus, they probably won't turn a profit
this season.</TE>
<TE>   "Many may make their costs back," Nelsen said. "But we're not in
this business just to break even."</TE>
<TE>   Gene Greenstadt, a Tulare County orange grower, says his orange
groves, which once turned a tidy profit, have in recent years been a
drain on his retirement income.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, with a large, sweet crop, he thought things were
finally on the rebound. But he didn't receive most of his payment
because the packing house that processed and shipped his crop, Kaweah
Citrus Assn., went under.</TE>
<TE>   "We were counting on finally digging ourselves out of the hole,"
Greenstadt said. "But I doubt we'll ever see that money."</TE>
<TE>   To find out where things went wrong with the packing house, he and
other growers requested Sunkist's detailed financial records. It took
months and a lawsuit for the cooperative to hand over the papers, not
the kind of treatment member growers expected.</TE>
<TE>   Greenstadt believes Sunkist should be more responsive and protect
its growers by providing them with indemnification insurance to
assist them if their packing house should go under.</TE>
<TE>   Gargiulo says Sunkist can't ensure that all of its licensed
packing houses are doing the right thing. But, he says, because these
closures affect Sunkist's profit, perhaps it should do something more
to protect growers.</TE>
<TE>   Given the tough economic run of the last few years, rumors are
circulating that more packing houses will close their doors this
year.</TE>
<TE>   Gargiulo says he wouldn't be surprised. The citrus packing
business is contracting just like the supermarket industry, he says,
with chains getting fewer but larger.</TE>
<TE>   Sunkist's largest packer, Paramount Citrus, has doubled in size
over the last five years. It operates 3,000 acres of citrus, mostly
its own, as well as four huge packing plants. By itself, Paramount
now makes up 10% of California's citrus industry.</TE>
<TE>   Some say Sunkist favors these huge packers with its most lucrative
orders, usually for fruit to be sold early in the season and for
export. Tulare County packer Brad Stark, a former Sunkist board
member, dropped out of the cooperative last year and filed a suit
claiming Sunkist wasn't distributing its orders fairly, particularly
for the lucrative ones.</TE>
<TE>   "In a cooperative there should be one standard that's applicable
to all the members," Stark said.</TE>
<TE>   Gargiulo says Stark's suit is groundless. Others in the industry
say charges of favoritism have been around longer than many of the
state's orange groves. Large, efficient packers with consistent
quality often command a larger share of the business and are
requested by buyers more often.</TE>
<TE>   But, he says, some small packers with high-quality fruit are doing
well too.</TE>
<TE>   What will make or break most packing houses and growers, analysts
say, is how much fruit they are able to export.</TE>
<TE>   Although Sunkist's fruit isn't as golden in the U.S. as it used to
be, Sunkist's navels command a premium price in Asia. There they are
displayed in Sunkist cartons with the brand facing outward like a
designer label. Big packing houses such as Paramount now export about
a third of everything they grow--the highest-quality fruit--to Japan,
Hong Kong, Korea and elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   Although exports to many key Asian markets have remained
relatively flat in recent years, thanks to recession and a strong
U.S. dollar that makes the fruit more expensive to foreign buyers,
there are some encouraging signs. Tariffs are coming down in China,
Japan and Korea, which will make Sunkist's oranges more affordable.
And Sunkist has begun to move into some of Wal-Mart's markets abroad,
such as Taiwan.</TE>
<TE>   "We are making progress now that will clearly identify our
position as the world leader in citrus," Gargiulo said.</TE>
<TE>   But, he says, things won't get better overnight. "It's like they
say, you have to eat the elephant one bite at a time."</TE>

<HD>Be Cautious in Disclosing Buyout Offer</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Executive Roundtable is a weekly column by TEC Worldwide, an
international organization of more than 7,000 business owners,
company presidents and chief executives. TEC members meet in small
peer groups to share their business experiences and help one another
solve problems in a round-table session. The following question and
answer is a summary of a discussion at a recent TEC meeting in
Southern California.</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<LD>   Question: I recently received an unsolicited offer to buy my
business (nothing in writing yet, just a verbal offer), and I can't
decide whether to tell my management team.</LD>
<TE>   We suffered a sharp downturn in sales this year, and after six
months of hard work we have finally gotten the company back on track.
I'm afraid that if I say anything, my managers will lose their focus
and some might even think about jumping ship. On the other hand, I've
always been open with my team, and it feels like I'm holding out on
them.</TE>
<TE>   Should I disclose the news now or wait until I have a done deal?
My most senior manager has a 5% ownership stake in the business.</TE>
<TE>   Answer: To disclose or not to disclose, that is the question.
However, though your concern for your management team is both
appropriate and commendable, it is only one of many issues that need
to be addressed before making any decisions.</TE>
<TE>   First and foremost, suggests Suzanne Frindt, a principal in the
consulting firm of 2130 Partners in Villa Park, step back and take a
look at the big picture.</TE>
<TE>   Does selling the business now fit in with your long-term goals and
objectives for yourself and for the business? Are you ready to
retire? Have you considered the financial and tax implications of a
sudden cash windfall? Do you know what you want to do with your life
after you cash out?</TE>
<TE>   From a business standpoint, do you know the true value of your
business--not what you think it is worth but what the market says it
is worth? More important, what might it be worth five or 10 years
down the road?</TE>
<TE>   Although the offer looks attractive now, you may get a better
return by growing the company a few more years and then cashing out
when earnings reach a higher level and the balance sheet looks
stronger.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, exiting a business should be a carefully planned and
executed process. Responding to an unsolicited offer puts you in a
reactive rather than a proactive mode. It puts someone else in
control of the process, which reduces your odds of getting the best
return for your most valuable asset.</TE>
<TE>   This doesn't mean you shouldn't listen to the offer. However, in
these situations it pays to proceed slowly and cautiously.</TE>
<TE>   If you decide to move forward with the sale, the issue of when and
what to tell your management team comes to the forefront. Jo Hunt,
president of DeLyon-Hunt &amp; Associates in Redondo Beach, recommends
getting all your ducks in a row before broaching the subject with
your team.</TE>
<TE>   "At this point, you don't have anything concrete to tell your
people other than that you're considering a verbal offer to buy the
business," Hunt said.</TE>
<TE>   "Surprising them with vague ideas about a deal that may or may not
happen will only lead to speculation, rumors and uncertainty. And
depending on who the potential buyer is, you may have serious
confidentiality issues," she said. "It may feel uncomfortable keeping
the news secret, but wait until you have some solid information, then
let your people know the 'who, what, when, where and why' of the
deal."</TE>
<TE>   Carri Johnston, president of Pep Threads in Orange, agrees:</TE>
<TE>   "Letting the cat out of the bag too soon could cause an adverse
reaction in both directions. If your managers perceive the sale as a
bad thing, they might get panicky and start looking for other jobs.
Plus, rumors can spread and then you have your hands full with damage
control.</TE>
<TE>   "On the other hand," Johnston said, "your managers might see the
sale as a good thing and then get disappointed if the deal falls
through. Either way, the downsides of disclosing too soon far
outweigh the upsides."</TE>
<TE>   The last thing you want to do in this situation is attempt to go
it alone. Wes Phillips, chief executive of Hunter Barth Advertising
in Costa Mesa, strongly suggests engaging the services of a
professional advisor as soon as possible.</TE>
<TE>   "Selling a business is a very complex undertaking that requires
the advice of experienced professionals," Phillips said. "Before you
take another step, find a reputable business broker or [mergers and
acquisitions] specialist and let them guide you through the process.</TE>
<TE>   "Even if you decide not to go forward with the sale, an advisor
will help you ask the right questions and make sure you cover all the
bases in your initial discussions with the potential buyer. Plus, a
good advisor will clarify any legal ramifications that might exist
with your minority shareholder.</TE>
<TE>   "If you decide to move forward, I would share the news with your
team as soon as you receive a formal letter of intent from the
buyer," Phillips said. "To wait any longer may destroy the trust they
have in you, and once broken, trust is very hard to get back."</TE>

<HD>Young Guns Battle for Votes in 40th District</HD>
<DH>Vying for an Assembly seat, rookie candidates Andrei Cherny
and Lloyd Levine are no strangers to politics.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MASSIE RITSCH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>At ages 26 and 32, respectively, Andrei Cherny and Lloyd Levine are
too young to be branded Old Boys. Still, the Democratic candidates
for the San Fernando Valley's 40th Assembly District are politically
connected beyond their years.</LD>
<LD>   Cherny was writing speeches for then-Vice President Al Gore 10
days out of Harvard and helped craft his party's platform in 2000. He
also worked for the district's current assemblyman, Speaker Bob
Hertzberg (D-Sherman Oaks), whose term expires this year.</LD>
<LD>   Levine was until recently an Assembly aide as well. His father,
Larry, has run many local political campaigns and is a chief opponent
of Valley cityhood.</LD>
<TE>   The 40th Assembly District encompasses Van Nuys, Reseda,
Northridge, Canoga Park, North Hills and Woodland Hills. West Hills
businesswoman Connie Friedman is competing for the Republicans in a
district where registered Democrats outnumber the GOP 49% to 32%.</TE>
<TE>   Mindful that their March 5 primary will almost certainly determine
who wins in November, Cherny and Levine are running the next five
weeks as if they were in the homestretch. Despite similar life
stories--raised in the Valley, gone for a while, back in time for the
campaign--both young men accuse the other of parachuting into the
district for the political opportunity and relying on other people's
connections to mount their bids.</TE>
<TE>   Levine said that despite Cherny's lofty title as a senior policy
advisor to Hertzberg, his opponent's career since graduating from
Harvard five years ago has been spent writing speeches in Washington
and halfheartedly attending law school at UC Berkeley before dropping
out.</TE>
<TE>   "I was in Sacramento and I never, ever saw Andrei Cherny there,"
said Levine, a UC Riverside graduate who was legislative director for
Assemblyman John Longville (D-Rialto).</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Cherny said that Levine, by living in the state capital
since 1994 and working most recently for an assemblyman from the
Inland Empire, has pulled up any roots he ever had in the Valley.</TE>
<TE>   "I made a commitment to myself to come back and always considered
this my home," Cherny said. "Lloyd did not."</TE>
<TE>   Levine said Cherny would pose no contest if it weren't for Hertz-
berg. He accused the genial speaker of "arm-twisting" his supporters
to back protege Cherny. Cherny has said the same of Levine's father
and complained to the Fair Political Practices Commission that Larry
Levine is illegally funding his son.</TE>
<TE>   Political consultant Levine lent his son $88,000 last year, which
Lloyd Levine in turn lent his campaign. They have been upfront about
the transaction but now concede that it might have violated state
law. Candidates can accept loans only from commercial lenders; any
other loans for political purposes are considered contributions. And
$88,000 far exceeds the contribution limit of $3,000.</TE>
<TE>   "We were fairly certain that parents could help their children in
any pursuit they want," Lloyd Levine said Friday at his headquarters
in a Van Nuys shopping center. "If we do find out that was incorrect,
then we will correct that."</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for the Fair Political Practices Commission said
Cherny's complaint has been received but declined further comment.</TE>
<TE>   Both Democrats have built their campaigns around education and
public safety. To those issues, Levine has added improving access to
health care and Cherny easing the area's traffic.</TE>
<TE>   On education, Levine said he would like to add counselors on
campuses, reduce class sizes and involve teachers more in discussions
of reform.</TE>
<TE>   If elected, Cherny said the first bill he would sponsor would
require high school students to perform community service to
graduate. He said he is also a big fan of charter schools as a way to
give parents more control.</TE>
<TE>   "It shouldn't just be the wealthy and rich who are able to make
decisions about their children's education," he said.</TE>
<TE>   On the question of secession--whether the Valley should form its
own city separate from Los Angeles--Levine, like his father, opposes
the idea in its current form.</TE>
<TE>   "I think there's a segment of the people who ... expect that
they'll wake up in the morning and all of a sudden the traffic on the
freeways will be gone, and we all know that's not the case," Levine
said. "The political equivalent of 'I'm going to take my ball and go
home' really isn't going to work."</TE>
<TE>   But voters should have the final word, Levine said.</TE>
<TE>   "As an opponent of secession, I think the best way to stop it is
to put it on the ballot and let the people vote it down," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Despite garnering endorsements from some of secession's biggest
advocates and advising their group, Cherny said he, too, opposes the
secession plan but still favors putting the issue on the ballot.</TE>
<TE>   "If the voters do vote for it, I will respect their wish and work
to make it work," he said.</TE>
<TE>   As the latest in a stream of young legislative aides seeking to
slip into seats vacated because of term limits, Cherny and Levine
have both been collecting endorsements from lawmakers and interest
groups. But they are still developing the techniques of veteran
politicians. They don't dole out hugs like Hertzberg and they don't
seem entirely comfortable approaching people for their vote.</TE>
<TE>   But then, again, these are not Old Boys. Levine last faced voters
when he was in middle school and running for student council. And the
most recent contest Cherny won involved downing a pint of chocolate
ice cream.</TE>
<TE>   Times staff writer Patrick McGreevy contributed to this report.</TE>

<HD>Deputies Disperse Afghan Meeting</HD>
<DH>Community: The hall was too small for the 1,000 people who
attended, and an election to a local council never occurred.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KIMI YOSHINO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Orange County sheriff's deputies dispersed 1,000 people who packed a
community meeting for Afghans in Southern California after arguments
broke out.</LD>
<LD>   Organizers of Sunday's meeting by the Council for Peace of
Afghanistan were hoping to elect 10 community representatives, but
the meeting ended in disarray, with no vote. They said they were
unprepared for the large turnout, including a group of hecklers they
contend were pro-Taliban. But the loudest critics denied that charge,
saying they were complaining because the election was rigged.</LD>
<LD>   Authorities estimated the crowd at close to 1,000 in a Laguna
Hills banquet hall designed for 700.</LD>
<TE>   "They had more people show up than they expected. It was too much
for their security," Lt. Greg Russell said. "We responded and
eventually dispersed the crowd of approximately 1,000 people
peacefully." Despite the confusion, several people considered the
meeting a success--a signal that democracy is alive and well.</TE>
<TE>   "Most people came to show that we can elect representation," said
Noor Delawari, a businessman from La Canada-Flintridge who helped
organize the meeting. "Every community should have representation.
That's the American way of doing things .... I just wanted to
participate in a process that I think is healthy."</TE>
<TE>   But controversy has been brewing for weeks over exactly how
Southern California Afghan residents should be represented. Those
elected by this group would become part of a national council that
would serve as a voice for Afghan Americans, including lobbying in
Washington, and developing relations with the new government in
Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   Several meetings of Afghan American community councils have been
held in Southern and Northern California, as well as other areas
heavily populated with Afghans throughout the United States. In
Southern California, many people criticized a previous election,
saying that not enough people were informed, and that the process was
not open to the public.</TE>
<TE>   "This time, we did our job too good," said Laguna Hills resident
Hasan Nouri, one of the election's main organizers.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody and their brother found out and they came. We got
bogged down in the process, and before we knew it, it was impossible
to control."</TE>
<TE>   Nouri, Delawari and others said many of the critics who prevented
the balloting are pro-Taliban.</TE>
<TE>   "I strongly believe that the destructive elements were primarily
the Taliban group," Nouri said. "They came with the mission to be an
interfering agent."</TE>
<TE>   One of the most vocal critics in attendance on Sunday was Sayed K.
Hashemeyan, a former professor at Kabul University, now in Southern
California who publishes the expatriate Afghanistan Mirror. He said
he was once a strong Taliban supporter but now stands behind free
elections, United States intervention and the new leadership in
Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   His concern, Hashemeyan said, was that Sunday's election in Laguna
Hills was prearranged and that some candidates, including himself,
were barred from running for a spot on the council. In addition, he
said that only a small percentage of Southern California's 40,000
Afghans knew about the meeting.</TE>
<TE>   Organizers denied those charges, and said they will try to hold an
election again, in a bigger hall.</TE>
<TE>   "The next time we will be better prepared," Delawari said.</TE>

<HD>Farmer Gives Up Mexican Mayoralty</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Northern California immigrant farmer who staged a triumphant return
to his hometown in Mexico and won a mayoral election, only to see it
overturned amid furious protests, said Sunday that he has given up
his fight for the office.</LD>
<LD>   But the battle to change Mexican politics has just begun, Andres
Bermudez said from his home near Sacramento.</LD>
<LD>   "I was going to start change, but they did not let me do it," said
Bermudez, who entered the U.S. illegally 28 years ago in a car trunk
and is now known as the "Tomato King."</LD>
<TE>   Bermudez, 51, was among the first immigrants in this country to
run for Mexican elective office after the country's dual nationality
provision went into effect in 1998. The law permits immigrants from
Mexico to regain citizenship and voting rights in their home country.</TE>
<TE>   In September, just days before he was to be sworn in, his election
was overturned by a federal electoral commission on the grounds that
he was not a legal resident of Jerez. On his election form, he had
listed his California residence as his permanent address.</TE>
<TE>   His victory in the July 1 mayoral election in the Zacatecas city
of Jerez turned him into a populist emblem for Mexican immigrants.
The northwestern state is riddled with poverty, and most families
there have at least one relative who has crossed to the U.S. seeking
a better standard of living.</TE>
<TE>   Bermudez, who earns an estimated $300,000 a year from his farming
businesses in Yolo County, had said he planned to donate his mayoral
salary to charity. He also hoped to bring agribusiness and
manufacturing to Jerez, a city of 40,000 about 400 miles northwest of
Mexico City.</TE>
<TE>   Bermudez's fall has galvanized immigrants who say their homeland
needs deeper political change, according to activists in this
country.</TE>
<TE>   "The politicians in Mexico are afraid of immigrants going back and
taking their jobs," said Guadalupe Gomez, president of the Federation
of Zacatecan Clubs of Southern California. "So they had to stop the
guy who had all the possibilities, and did not need to take money
from the people."</TE>
<TE>   After the decision by the electoral commission, his supporters
occupied city hall in mid-September, and a compromise was reached:
Another person from Bermudez's party, the left-leaning Democratic
Revolutionary Party, would assume the post for three months and then
a public poll would determine who was the preferred man for the
office.</TE>
<TE>   In that December poll, 51% of voters preferred Bermudez; 31%
wanted interim candidate Ismael Solis to remain.</TE>
<TE>   But Solis refused to leave office, prompting Bermudez's supporters
to stage another sit-in at city hall.</TE>
<TE>   Late last week, however, Bermudez said he decided to give up the
fight after Zacatecas Gov. Ricardo Monreal said he was backing Solis.
Monreal had originally suggested that Bermudez and the two other
mayoral candidates, Juan Duran of Oxnard and Martin Carvajal of Fort
Worth, run for office.</TE>
<TE>   From his comfortable home nestled against the hills on the western
edge of the Sacramento Valley in Winters, Bermudez said Sunday that
he phoned his supporters in Jerez to tell them to drop their
protests.</TE>
<TE>   A corrupt political machine, he told them, had snuffed out their
hopes.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel like I could do something for my town," he said. "I've got
connections. I can invest money in Mexico. The Mexican people are
hungry for the truth. ... I was crying, everyone cried."</TE>
<TE>   But across California, leaders of Zacatecan immigrants said they
will continue their fight for political change in Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   Gomez, the president of the federation of Zacatecan clubs, said he
is working with groups on both sides of the border to pass "the
Bermudez Law" that would eliminate the strict residency requirement
and allow people living abroad to run for office back home.</TE>
<TE>   They also want to be allowed to vote in Mexican elections without
having to travel back to that country. President Vicente Fox was
helped to his historic victory in 2000 by thousands of immigrants who
traveled to Tijuana and other border cities to vote.</TE>
<TE>   In 2004, Gomez said, his group hopes to push a host of dual
nationals to run for local offices in Zacatecas and in national
elections.</TE>
<TE>   Next month, immigrant groups have invited lawmakers from Zacatecas
to meet with them to discuss their goals.</TE>
<TE>   "This is for the future of all Mexicans abroad," said Gomez, who
runs an income tax business in Santa Ana. "We had to leave the
country because they couldn't provide us with a decent way of living
... and we are not looked upon in the U.S. as first-class citizens
and not there either, and we don't know which government is worse."</TE>
<TE>   Back in Winters, Bermudez said his yearlong odyssey has soured him
on politics in Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't want to be a part of this anymore," he said. "I need to
go back to my business."</TE>
<TE>   But he will not give up completely. He plans to financially
support projects in his hometown and he said he has not ruled out
running for governor of Zacatecas in 2004.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe I will go again and fight again," he said.</TE>

<HD>Volunteer Tends to Lake's Fouled Fowl</HD>
<DH>Nature: Sharon Brewer patrols a Van Nuys park for discarded
fishhooks and line that could injure birds.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICIA WARD BIEDERMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Every day, winter and summer, Sharon Brewer makes four trips around
Lake Balboa. As the Reseda woman strides along the 51/3-mile course,
she scrutinizes the amoeba-shaped, man-made lake for the telltale
sparkle of fishing line and the flash of fishhooks.</LD>
<LD>   Her car is packed with line she has found, wound into compact
bundles and tied with neat bows. The hooks, including large,
multibarbed varieties designed for ocean fishing, are in plastic
bags, where they cannot hurt people or wildlife.</LD>
<LD>   Brewer loves the 27-acre lake and surrounding Anthony C. Beilenson
Park, run by the Los Angeles Department of Parks and Recreation. But
she is horrified that people who fish there discard hooks and line
with no concern for the danger to visitors and wildlife.</LD>
<TE>   The popular Van Nuys park attracts walkers, joggers, birders, dog
owners, cyclists and children entranced by the ducks. Lake Balboa
also attracts flocks of mallards, pelicans, coots, mud hens and other
water birds. The birds sometimes get tangled up in carelessly
discarded fishing line and are snagged by errant hooks.</TE>
<TE>   Some have died from their injuries, said Brewer, a self-appointed
guardian of the park and its wildlife. She has photographs to prove
it.</TE>
<TE>   "I had a very good day," Brewer said on a recent afternoon. In her
circuit of the lake that day, she had picked up 24 hooks and yards of
the clear plastic line that can garrote a bird.</TE>
<TE>   Last November, a pelican was tangled for several days in a web of
line, Brewer said. It was finally taken out of the lake by one of the
park's three lifeguards and an employee from the Department of Animal
Regulation. The bird was treated at the California Wildlife Center in
Malibu for abrasions caused by the line and other injuries but died a
few days later.</TE>
<TE>   To make it easier to fish injured birds out of the lake, Brewer
uses two nets, one with a long, telescoping handle. On Friday, she
helped a lifeguard land an injured cormorant, its wing immobilized by
fishing line. She drove it to the California Wildlife Center for
treatment.</TE>
<TE>   "I saw a coot today that had fishing line around both his feet,"
said Brewer, who began visiting the park almost a year ago "to
de-stress." She has photos of a Lake Balboa coot with only one intact
leg; the other was sliced off by fishing line or lost in some other
way.</TE>
<TE>   Adults are supposed to fish in the lake only after obtaining a
license, which limits fishermen to two poles. But Brewer said she has
seen some people prop up a dozen poles, in hopes of pulling a tilapia
or catfish from the lake, which is fed by the nearby Tillman Water
Reclamation Plant.</TE>
<TE>   "There are up to 50 people fishing here in the summer," she said.
"They break branches off the cherry trees to use for rods, and they
dig in the park for worms."</TE>
<TE>   Brewer is the unofficial leader of a small group of park regulars
who say the staff is inattentive, lax about enforcing regulations and
unresponsive to the needs of the wildlife, all claims the parks
department denies.</TE>
<TE>   Park user Bette-Jane Blank of Van Nuys said staff members are slow
to respond to the needs of the waterfowl. "I don't know what they do
besides hose off the boats," she said, referring to pedal boats
rented out during the summer and weekends. "They're not sympathetic."</TE>
<TE>   Brewer and Blank have written to city officials about their
concerns, and Brewer does not hesitate to tell park staff when she
sees rules being broken or wildlife endangered. She has complained
about skateboarders and cyclists using paths designated for
pedestrians, visitors hanging trash in the trees and the infrequency
of patrols by park staff members.</TE>
<TE>   She lobbied to get two additional signs installed stating park
rules and has asked to have the lifeguard station clearly marked so
visitors will know where to go for help.</TE>
<TE>   In response to a letter from Brewer and Blank, James Combs,
assistant general manager for the department, said the lifeguards
were expected to patrol the lake by boat every three hours. He said
staff members were aware that birds had been injured and said the
department has procedures for handling such injuries.</TE>
<TE>   Even as Brewer has lobbied for a safer park, she has ruffled
feathers. The parks department has decided to form a volunteer
patrol, made up of concerned visitors, to augment paid staff.
According to department spokeswoman Jane Kolb, the group of five or
six volunteers, wearing baseball caps marked "Friends of Lake
Balboa," will help keep an eye on the park and inform scofflaws of
the rules.</TE>
<TE>   Brewer was recently told by Valley Ranger Tom Cotter that she will
not be on the volunteer patrol. Kolb said department officials,
including Cotter, had decided that "she wouldn't make a good
representative of the department." The new volunteer patrol will be
introduced at a public meeting in February, Kolb said.</TE>
<TE>   The term "lifeguards" is something of a misnomer because swimming
is not allowed in the shallow lake. Brewer and others say the
lifeguards should spend more time scrutinizing the park, its birds
and its visitors.</TE>
<TE>   Brewer said she thinks the lifeguards resent the waterfowl
"because they make a mess, and [the lifeguards] have to clean it up."</TE>
<TE>   Kolb pointed out that the 80-acre park is large and busy.</TE>
<TE>   "On a good weekend, we have 40,000 visitors," she said. "There's a
certain problem in patrolling that large an area and keeping
everybody happy."</TE>

<LD>A Ventura mortgage broker has been charged in federal court with
three counts of mail fraud in a lending scheme that allegedly bilked
California investors out of more than $4 million.</LD>
<LD>   Larry Curtis Waltz, the former owner of a Ventura lending agency,
will plead guilty to the charges Feb. 4 in federal court in Los
Angeles, said his attorney, Gary Lincenberg.</LD>
<LD>   Federal prosecutors allege that while operating Larry Waltz and
Associates, Waltz put together an elaborate scheme over several years
that bilked real estate investors out of thousands of dollars each.</LD>
<TE>   Waltz told investors, many of whom were elderly and on fixed
incomes, that they could expect monthly interest dividends if they
agreed to loan money to people buying a home or refinancing property,
said Assistant U.S. Atty. Angela Davis.</TE>
<TE>   They signed money over to Waltz after he showed them paperwork
from alleged applicants, Davis said. However, most of the names were
made up or used without the person's permission, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "[Waltz] would tell [potential investors] of an opportunity and he
would provide a borrower's name, but he had made up the borrowers,"
Davis said.</TE>
<TE>   Monthly interest payments, supposedly from the borrowers, actually
were cash payments pulled from the accounts of other investors doing
business with Waltz, Davis said.</TE>
<TE>   In a letter to the more than two dozen investors as well as in
subsequent conversations with Lincenberg, Waltz acknowledged his
guilt.</TE>
<TE>   "You have wrongfully entrusted money to me to invest on your
behalf," Waltz wrote in the letter, dated Jan. 12, 2001. "I have
wrongfully placed this money in risky investments which you did not
authorize. These investments failed. I have only a limited ability to
repay you."</TE>
<TE>   Waltz wrote that he "no doubt violated a number of laws" but
expressed hope that two investments "still have a chance of producing
funds which would enable me to pay back you and other investors."</TE>
<TE>   He was not available for comment.</TE>
<TE>   Lincenberg said Waltz has resigned from the company he started and
has lost his real estate broker's license. "This is hard on him, and
it's not going to be easy to deal with," Lincenberg said. "It was
eating at him and he felt bad. He didn't want to continue the
wrongdoing."</TE>
<TE>   Under federal sentencing guidelines, Davis said, she will ask
Judge Margaret Morrow to sentence Waltz to at least 18 months in
prison. Waltz would also be forced to pay back in full the nearly
$4.6 million lost by the investors, she said.</TE>

<HD>Agency Asks Approval to Fight Runoff</HD>
<DH>Environment: Pollution from inland Orange County is the
biggest scourge of its coastal waters, but the request to state
legislators is triggering a local debate.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Orange County Sanitation District is asking state lawmakers to
allow it to tackle the region's biggest polluter of coastal waters:
urban runoff. But local officials question whether that's an
appropriate job for the district and how the district would pay for
it.</LD>
<LD>   "There are some frightening financial aspects of all of this,"
said district General Manager Blake Anderson.</LD>
<LD>   Changing the district's charter, to include authority for handling
more than the relatively small amount of urban runoff that it already
does process, would set a statewide precedent and create new
responsibilities for the agency, which was formed to dispose of
northern and central Orange County's sewage. Runoff--car oil, pet
waste and other contaminants washed off streets and lawns into
waterways and eventually to the ocean--is the most common cause of
coastal pollution, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency.</LD>
<TE>   The district already diverts 2 million gallons of runoff a day
from storm drains and waterways to its treatment plant during dry
weather. This is only a dent in the problem--240 million gallons of
runoff flow daily in the county in dry weather, and that jumps to 500
million during rain.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the district has an impact. Bacteria levels along
Huntington Beach's shoreline have dropped since the district began
diverting runoff in 1999 at a cost of $225,000 annually.</TE>
<TE>   The district is constrained by its charter from doing more. If the
charter is amended, the district could divert up to 10 million
gallons a day and consider more expensive options, such as building
artificial wetlands that would naturally filter the runoff, or
building a runoff treatment plant, similar to a $9.5-million facility
built in Santa Monica that recycles 500,000 gallons of runoff a day.</TE>
<TE>   Sanitation district officials said they want to attack the problem
because they can improve coastal water quality, which creates both
health and economic benefits for coastal communities. Their ability
to treat runoff is "one arrow in the quiver" of tools to fight the
problem, said Robert P. Ghirelli, the sanitation district's manager
of technical services.</TE>
<TE>   Former state Assemblyman Scott Baugh, now a consultant hired by
the district, is working with Assemblyman Tom Harman (R-Huntington
Beach) to craft a bill to allow the charter change. It will be
introduced in the Legislature in a few weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Local officials, though favoring the proposal in concept, are
concerned about its ramifications.</TE>
<TE>   "Are we putting the cart before the horse? Do we know what we're
getting into?" asked Irvine Councilwoman Beth Krom at a meeting
Thursday. Krom is also a member of the district's board of directors.</TE>
<TE>   Environmentalists are also divided.</TE>
<TE>   Some critics wonder whether the district should take on yet
another challenge. The district is already involved in an ambitious
$600-million plan to turn sewage into drinking water, and faces
tougher standards on sewage sludge that will require costlier
treatment. And then there is the Clean Water Act waiver that allows
the district to pump dirtier sewage into the ocean than nearly all of
the nation's 16,000 sewage treatment plants. The waiver is up for
renewal next year, and a grass-roots group of opponents has persuaded
four cities to fight renewal.</TE>
<TE>   "They're just exacerbating the problem," said activist Doug
Korthof. "It's arrogant."</TE>
<TE>   Anderson, the district general manager, said, "We're very mindful
that our first duty is sewage treatment."</TE>
<TE>   Baugh said there are other possible hurdles--especially whether
costs for cleaning runoff could be passed on to ratepayers.
Proposition 218, approved by California voters in 1996, requires that
proposed new levies be subject to a vote by those affected. There are
exemptions for sewer fees, but none for urban runoff.</TE>
<TE>   Seal Beach Councilman Shawn Boyd, chairman of the district's urban
runoff committee and a member of the district's board of directors,
said of critics, "Anyone that wants to challenge us for cleaning up
the beaches--bring it on."</TE>

<DH>Bureaucracy: The governor is giving awards to offices that
publish brochures and other material that people can actually read.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBIN FIELDS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The category was Excellence in External Public Information Documents.</LD>
<LD>   And last week, the Governor's Office for Innovation in Government
ended 10 days of suspense, announcing that a fire-prevention brochure
and a series of teenage-themed job safety bookmarks had won the
state's inaugural Clarity Awards.</LD>
<LD>   The phrase "clarity in government" seems to come with an implied
rim shot, as much an internal contradiction as jumbo shrimp.</LD>
<TE>   "There's a whole theory that bureaucracy remains deliberately
obscure to maintain its power," said Kevin Starr, the state librarian
and a contest judge.</TE>
<TE>   The Clarity Awards are part of Gov. Gray Davis' efforts to rip
away that veil, following in the footsteps of a similar federal
initiative to "reinvent" government.</TE>
<TE>   Clarity winners get no cash, only bragging rights and crystal
trophies made by inmates in the state's Arts-in-Corrections program.</TE>
<TE>   The first contest evaluated brochures, surveys and other
educational materials. In the future, the program will expand, giving
quarterly awards for the clearest forms, regulations and even
internal communiques.</TE>
<TE>   "That should be a kick," said Janet Koffman, a Department of
Industrial Relations information officer whose apprenticeship posters
placed second in the first Clarities. She routinely receives internal
documents so riddled with obscure legal citations and acronyms that
she can barely understand them.</TE>
<TE>   The standards for the contest are simple and constant: Be concise.
Avoid acronyms, technical terms and cliches. Use vertical lists. (If
only the designers of the butterfly ballot in Palm Beach County,
Fla., had known that.)</TE>
<TE>   "It should be something that my mother, who's 92, could pick up
and read," said Mary Fernandez, the innovation office's deputy
director and another contest judge.</TE>
<TE>   Admittedly, thick subject matter puts some publications at a
disadvantage. It's tough to find vivid verbs to explain environmental
health risk assessments or teacher-retention tax credits.</TE>
<TE>   "And verbs are the most powerful thing. Stay away from ponderous
abstract nouns," Starr instructed, adding that only his role as a
judge kept the State Library's own publications from being "a
slam-dunk winner."</TE>
<TE>   The Department of Forestry and Fire Protection brochure
"Homeowners Checklist: How to Make Your Home Fire Safe" won over the
judging panel with crisp graphics, organization and thoroughness. It
replaced a 10-year-old brochure weighted down with phrases such as
"adjacent to the home" and comprehension-proof jargon like "fire
flow" and "Class-A roof."</TE>
<TE>   "The standard public does not understand that," said Bryan
Zollner, a firefighter-turned-bureaucrat who has not quite banished
government-speak from his own vocabulary.</TE>
<TE>   "The next element we're working on is remaking that," he said of a
fire-safety video that will complement the updated brochure.
Together, he said, they'll make an "effective, defensible system."</TE>
<TE>   The co-winner from the Department of Industrial Relations, the
"Safe Jobs for Youth" bookmark series, featured a suitably informal
tone in addressing questions that teenagers might have about wages,
hours and permits.</TE>
<TE>   "High school students don't want to read the labor code," said
Carrie Beckstein, the author of the campaign.</TE>
<TE>   She sympathizes. Persuading her agency colleagues to let go of
their convoluted syntax and jargon is "a constant--I want to pick my
words here--I need another word for battle."</TE>
<TE>   Starr's brush with clarity left him so inspired that he could
imagine a time when even California's environmental impact reports
and financial records would become penetrable to the citizenry.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe, as poet George Oppen wrote, clarity really is "the most
beautiful thing in the world."</TE>

<HD>Coastal Voters Targeted as Key to Riordan Win</HD>
<DH>Politics: GOP candidate for governor believes his moderate
social views will regain the support of those who spurned previous
Republicans.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL FINNEGAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SANTA BARBARA</DL>
<LD>It's no accident that gubernatorial candidate Richard Riordan chose
the Central Coast last week as the spot to trumpet his support for
abortion rights and school reform.</LD>
<LD>   Coastal voters--from San Diego to the northern end of San
Francisco Bay--are a key target for the Riordan campaign.</LD>
<LD>   They have spurned fellow Republicans in one election after another
since 1996. But Riordan's strategists are betting that his mix of
fiscal toughness and moderation on social issues can win them back.</LD>
<TE>   Their support was crucial to the success of Pete Wilson,
California's last Republican governor and a politician with a similar
ideology. Without them, victory for the GOP gubernatorial
candidate--whether Riordan or another Republican--is all but
impossible in November.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a really important piece of business for the Republican
Party--to get competitive again in coastal California," said Bill
Carrick, a Democratic strategist and former Riordan advisor.
"Ultimately it will define the Republican Party's ability to be a
real competitive party in California."</TE>
<TE>   Above all, Riordan strategists hope he will draw support from
Republican and independent women on the coast--a group that voted in
large numbers for Al Gore, Gray Davis and a slew of other Democrats
in recent congressional and state legislative races.</TE>
<TE>   "It's women along the coast who have most turned against
Republicans," said GOP political analyst Allan Hoffenblum.</TE>
<TE>   Davis, facing a tough reelection fight, is working to maintain
support among coastal voters. On Friday, he sent the Bush
administration a letter saying new offshore oil drilling "would be
unacceptable" in California. It's a sentiment widely shared among
residents of coastal areas, where environmental protection is
popular.</TE>
<TE>   Among the other issues that resonate with coastal voters,
strategists say, are education and abortion rights. Davis casts
himself as a champion of both issues in his campaign advertising, and
on Friday night began airing advertisements critical of Riordan's
past financial support of abortion opponents. The former Los Angeles
mayor contends that despite that support, he favors abortion rights.</TE>
<TE>   For his part, Riordan talked of both education and abortion rights
last week as he campaigned on the Central Coast. On Wednesday, he
stumped in Monterey and Salinas, where he toured a school
construction site. On Thursday, he campaigned in Paso Robles, San
Luis Obispo, Santa Maria and Santa Barbara, riding in his campaign
bus down U.S. 101 amid picture-perfect landscapes of beaches and
rolling green hills.</TE>
<TE>   "I cannot win this state without the Central Coast," Riordan told
reporters as the bus rumbled past Pismo Beach.</TE>
<TE>   A campaign video crew captured much of the day on camera for
television ads--including his rendition of "As Time Goes By" on a
piano at the Madonna Inn, a landmark of roadside kitsch in San Luis
Obispo.</TE>
<TE>   By tradition, GOP primary candidates have focused on rallying the
party's conservative base in the California "fish hook." It goes
straight down the middle of the state, from the rural north through
the Central Valley and Inland Empire to the Mexican border, then back
up along the coast from San Diego to Orange County.</TE>
<TE>   "You go where the votes are, and that's where the great mass of
Republican votes are," said GOP strategist Ken Khachigian.</TE>
<TE>   Riordan has not ignored those areas, where his moderate views on
gay rights and other issues are unpopular; his statewide bus tour
will conclude Tuesday with a visit to Fresno, the hometown of one of
his more conservative GOP rivals, California Secretary of State Bill
Jones.</TE>
<TE>   But Riordan, who also faces Los Angeles financier Bill Simon Jr.
in the March 5 primary, is the only GOP candidate who has targeted
coastal voters as a base of support.</TE>
<TE>   "Is the fish hook important? Yes," said Don Sipple, Riordan's
chief strategist. "Is it exclusively the road to victory? No. We're
going to put emphasis on the coastal counties. We believe Dick
Riordan is the kind of Republican who can attract support in those
areas."</TE>
<TE>   By and large, the political outlook of many coastal
Republicans--indeed, many coastal residents of any political
persuasion--is similar to Riordan's. Many reside in affluent
enclaves--La Jolla, the Westside of Los Angeles, Ventura, Santa
Barbara, Carmel, the suburbs of San Francisco. Among them are
Hollywood and high-tech professionals. As GOP strategist Tony Quinn
put it, they are more apt to drive luxury sedans than pickup trucks.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think you see many expensive Mercedes-Benzes with gun
racks on them," he said.</TE>
<TE>   In Paso Robles last week, Riordan stopped for bacon and eggs at
Joe's Place, where he touted his proposal to cut school bureaucracy
and shift more money to classrooms.</TE>
<TE>   After breakfast, he wandered to the table of a school bus driver,
Kelly Stainbrook, 40.</TE>
<TE>   "Are you pro-life or pro-choice?" he asked her.</TE>
<TE>   "That's something I'll keep to myself," she responded.</TE>
<TE>   "OK," Riordan said. "Well, I'm in favor of a woman's right to make
her own decisions."</TE>
<TE>   "I am too," Stainbrook told him.</TE>
<TE>   Candidates who oppose abortion run against the political tide in
most of the state's coastal areas.</TE>
<TE>   "When we've run right-to-lifers, they've lost," said Fred Thomas,
the Santa Barbara County Republican chairman. "That just doesn't sell
in this part of the country."</TE>
<TE>   Since 1996, voters up and down the coast have elected Democratic
women--all of them pro-choice--to seats in Congress long occupied by
Republican men.</TE>
<TE>   The newcomers include Reps. Susan Davis of San Diego, Jane Harman
of Venice and Lois Capps of Santa Barbara.</TE>
<TE>   The election of Capps in 1998 reflected the trouble that the
Republican Party has faced statewide in appealing to centrist voters.
In the primary, Tom Bordonaro, an abortion opponent backed by
Christian conservatives, defeated moderate Assemblyman Brooks
Firestone, but lost to Capps.</TE>
<TE>   In 2000, Republicans nominated a moderate, Mike Stoker, to
challenge Capps' bid for reelection. But he lost too--in part because
she pounded him on his environmental record.</TE>
<TE>   One of her most effective tactics, Stoker recalled, was to use his
support for a new Exxon oil refinery as the subject of an attack ad.</TE>
<TE>   "They started off with the Valdez oil spill--the typical
black-and-white commercial," Stoker said. "If you're running in a
coastal district, and you're perceived to be in the pocket of oil
companies, you're going to lose votes no matter what you do."</TE>
<TE>   Eric Smith, a UC Santa Barbara political scientist, said the
hostility of coastal swing voters toward oil drilling was without
doubt part of Davis' motivation this month in publicizing a court
dispute with the Bush administration over leases for drilling off the
coast of Santa Barbara. The governor, he said, is aiming for the same
coastal voters courted by Riordan.</TE>
<TE>   "It stands out as a way to stamp himself as an environmentalist,"
Smith said.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration is appealing a federal court ruling
requiring state officials to review any new oil exploration plans, a
move that effectively halted new drilling off the California coast. A
spokesman said Davis would fight "tooth and nail all the way up to
the Supreme Court if need be."</TE>
<TE>   As Riordan's bus passed the oil platforms off Gaviota State Beach
outside Santa Barbara on Thursday, the candidate offered his own
point of view on the court case.</TE>
<TE>   "As far as I'm concerned, it's irrelevant," he said. "Whether
there's a lawsuit or not, I'm against offshore drilling. Period."</TE>

<HD>Enron Vision Proved Costly to Firm, State</HD>
<DH>Energy: Wild promises of the savings from deregulation
helped bring it about. In the end the state paid heavily for new
system, and Enron was left a small player.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NANCY VOGEL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Despite the hundreds of thousands of dollars Enron spent trying to
influence California's energy debate in the 1990s, including timely
donations to key politicians, its most lasting accomplishment was
almost intangible:</LD>
<LD>   It helped persuade state officials that electricity ought to be
subject to market forces.</LD>
<LD>   "The idea that you could commoditize everything and trade
everything--and that government was foolish and wasteful and
ineffective compared to the market--that faith was the one they had
really imparted to everyone," said V. John White, executive director
of the Center for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Technologies. "It
was intellectual domination, in part because nobody wanted to defend
the status quo."</LD>
<TE>   Enron invested more time and money in the debate than any other
energy company, say lawmakers, consumer advocates, utility officials
and others who in the 1990s helped shape the new competitive
electricity market. But, they say, more often than not the company
failed to win what it sought.</TE>
<TE>   Today, as the firm faces bankruptcy, congressional hearings and
criminal investigations, its role in California is relatively small.
It plans to build a power plant near Sacramento, and it continues to
supply electricity to some large businesses and college campuses.</TE>
<TE>   In June 1994, with California debating how to deregulate its
electricity industry, a top Enron official promised California
"enormous" savings if companies like his could compete for the
state's utility customers.</TE>
<TE>   Jeffrey Skilling, then chief of Enron's natural gas group, tossed
out a figure of $8.9 billion a year. Then he told the Public
Utilities Commission just what that could buy.</TE>
<TE>   "You can triple the number of police officers in Los Angeles, San
Francisco, Oakland and San Diego," Skilling said, "and you could
double the state of California construction budget for hospitals.</TE>
<TE>   "And you could double the number of teachers in Los Angeles, San
Francisco, Oakland and San Diego," he went on. "You could pay all the
interest on the California state debt."</TE>
<TE>   "The stakes are huge," Skilling told the PUC, "and every minute
that we delay bringing competitive markets to California allows the
meter to keep ticking."</TE>
<TE>   The company didn't make its case with words alone.</TE>
<TE>   In April 1994, for example, Enron gave $10,000 to Republican Gov.
Pete Wilson just one day before his appointees on the PUC issued a
historic document declaring their support for deregulation.</TE>
<TE>   In the following years, as debate solidified into concrete
proposals, Enron's contributions to politicians and its stable of
lobbyists expanded.</TE>
<TE>   By 1998, the company's donations to California politicians topped
$100,000. That included $25,000 to Gray Davis' successful campaign
for governor and $20,000 to his Republican opponent, Dan Lungren.
State Sen. Jim Brulte (R-Rancho Cucamonga), the author of the 1996
deregulation law, got $4,000.</TE>
<TE>   The company gave $172,000 to the state's politicians in 2000 and
$78,500 last year.</TE>
<TE>   Thousands Spent on Payments to Lobbyists</TE>
<TE>   From 1991 through 1996, Enron's payments to lobbyists ranged from
$30,000 to $70,000 each year. By 1998, it was paying nearly half a
million dollars for lobbyists working the Legislature and PUC.</TE>
<TE>   The company also gave $100,000 to the host committee for the 2000
Democratic National Convention in Los Angeles, for which then-Mayor
Richard Riordan, now a Republican candidate for governor, was the
lead fund-raiser. Last May, then-Enron Chairman Kenneth L. Lay met
with Riordan to talk about the company's solutions to the state's
energy crisis.</TE>
<TE>   For all that, though, many observers say Enron influenced
California deregulation most by way of Washington, not Sacramento.</TE>
<TE>   "The entire electric restructuring agenda on a national level was
an Enron agenda," said state Sen. Steve Peace (D-El Cajon), who led
the Legislature's effort in 1996 to shape deregulation. "They had
such control and influence over [federal regulators] that that in
turn put California in a place where we had no choice."</TE>
<TE>   The PUC, under pressure, set out in 1993 to overhaul its
80-year-old system of regulating the monopolies of Pacific Gas &amp;
Electric, Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas &amp; Electric.</TE>
<TE>   Enron jumped into the fray.</TE>
<TE>   "The fact that Skilling was in PUC meetings was an indication of
how important we thought this was," said Dave Parquet, an Enron vice
president who has been with the company in California since 1993.</TE>
<TE>   Few Other Companies Follow Enron's Lead</TE>
<TE>   Few other energy companies followed.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the ones that would later come to dominate the California
market--Reliant Energy, Duke Energy and Mirant Corp., for
example--did not hire lobbyists or begin giving campaign
contributions until after 1997, when they bought the power plants
that PG&amp;E, Edison and SDG&amp;E were forced to auction under
deregulation.</TE>
<TE>   "Enron did spend a lot of money on this," said Robert Michaels, an
economics professor at Cal State Fullerton who has worked as a
consultant for the firm. "Enron was essentially the only company
other than the utilities that had the resources and motivation to
send lawyers and experts to thousands of working groups and
hearings."</TE>
<TE>   The PUC eventually narrowed its proposals for opening the
electricity industry to competition to two. The first, pushed by
former Commission President Daniel Fessler, was known as "poolco." It
involved the creation of a new agency that would both operate the
transmission grid and run a market. Electricity prices in the "pool"
would be set hourly based upon supply and demand.</TE>
<TE>   Enron hated the idea.</TE>
<TE>   "We opposed the concept of the pool," Lay said in an interview
with The Times last January. "Markets work when consumers and
suppliers interact with each other....Each knows what the other wants
and can do, and in the process creative things start occurring and
all kinds of new products get developed. And when you go through a
[pool], all that gets screened out."</TE>
<TE>   Enron backed a second proposal, carried by former PUC member Jesse
Knight, known as the "bilateral" approach. Under such a market,
buyers and sellers would cut their own deals secretly. The job of
making sure electricity flowed smoothly on the grid would be left to
an agency that acted like a neutral air traffic controller, but
didn't buy or sell electricity itself.</TE>
<TE>   In the summer of 1995, the utilities, their biggest customers and
private power plant owners tried to find a way around the deadlock at
the PUC. They settled on a compromise approach.</TE>
<TE>   There would be a market called the Power Exchange, with prices set
hourly, as Fessler proposed. But it would be separated from the
grid-operating agency--the California Independent System
Operator--which would run its own small market for the last-minute
flow of electricity needed to avoid blackouts.</TE>
<TE>   With much political heft backing this compromise, the PUC voted
for it 3 to 2 in December 1995. Knight's bilateral approach was
narrowly rejected.</TE>
<TE>   "I lost," he said. "I lost fairly."</TE>
<TE>   Some argue that Enron, realizing that Knight's proposal would
fail, lobbied for the separation of the Power Exchange and Cal-ISO
because it would be easier for the company to manipulate.</TE>
<TE>   "Enron was very, very insistent on what came to be called the
market separation rule," said Paul Joskow, a Massachusetts Institute
of Technology economist who worked for Edison as a consultant. "Those
of us who participated warned the commission that there were
significant potential dangers there."</TE>
<TE>   Mike Florio, a senior attorney with The Utility Reform Network and
a member of the board that oversees Cal-ISO, said he is convinced
that a more integrated approach would have spared California the
worst of the soaring prices that lasted from June 2000 to June 2001.</TE>
<TE>   "With the ISO and [the Power Exchange] being separate," he said,
"none of the market monitors could see the whole picture ... so it
was possible for people to play games much more easily without being
detected."</TE>
<TE>   In spite of all its efforts to shape California's electricity
market, Enron never became a major player once it opened.</TE>
<TE>   The company does not own any power plants in the state but instead
acts as a middleman, buying and selling megawatts in a daisy chain of
deals.</TE>
<TE>   Officials with Cal-ISO and the state Department of Water
Resources, which began buying electricity on behalf of the
cash-strapped utilities in January 2001, say they don't do a lot of
business with Enron.</TE>
<TE>   In January, February and March 2001, for example, less than 2% of
the electricity purchased by the water department came from Enron
Power Marketing Inc.</TE>
<TE>   Rate Freeze Thwarts Retail Market Plan</TE>
<TE>   Wholesale electricity was never Enron's main concern in
California. More than anything, the company wanted to create a
thriving retail market where it would compete to buy electricity on
behalf of utility customers, from computer chip manufacturers to
apartment renters.</TE>
<TE>   Such choice in electricity service providers was a keystone of
California's deregulation plan. But by 1998, the company had given up
signing any new residential customers and was complaining loudly that
California's deregulation rules made competition next to impossible.</TE>
<TE>   The biggest problem, said Enron Vice President Parquet, was that
the Legislature froze residential utility rates as part of the 1996
law that slightly modified the PUC's deregulation plan.</TE>
<TE>   With frozen rates, Parquet said, utility customers had no reason
to shop and Enron could not find electricity to sell at a better
price.</TE>
<TE>   So far, despite having filed for bankruptcy, Enron continues to
provide about 1,200 megawatts at peak to customers it recruited
during the brief heyday of choice in California's retail electricity
market.</TE>
<TE>   But state power buyers are prepared for the worst, ready to step
in to fill the gap should the troubled company suddenly fail to meet
its commitments.</TE>
<TE>   Today the hub of Enron's activity in California is the permitting
of a 900-megawatt power plant in Roseville, a far cry from the robust
market it set out to manage.</TE>
<TE>   The problem, said Parquet, is that California never delivered a
true market. "I would hate for people to go back and say, 'See,
deregulation did not work,' " he said. "Because it was not
deregulated, it was re-regulated."</TE>

<HD>Poll Says College  Freshmen Lean Left</HD>
<DH>Attitudes: UCLA survey finds highest percentage of
politically liberal students since early '70s.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>REBECCA TROUNSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES EDUCATION WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>More college freshmen today describe themselves as politically
liberal than at any time since the Vietnam War, a nationwide survey
by UCLA researchers has found.</LD>
<LD>   A resurgence of liberalism among U.S. freshmen also is reflected
in their shifting attitudes on a range of hot-button political and
social issues, according to survey results released today.</LD>
<LD>   "It's a real change, a broad-based trend toward greater liberalism
on almost every issue we look at," said Alexander W. Astin, a UCLA
education professor who started the survey, the nation's largest, in
1966.</LD>
<TE>   The researchers measured "liberalism" by asking students to
describe their political views and to take positions on certain
benchmark issues.</TE>
<TE>   For instance, a record proportion--57.9%--believe that gay couples
should have the legal right to marry. The highest portion in two
decades--32.2%--say the death penalty should be abolished. And more
than a third--the highest rate since 1980--say marijuana should be
legalized, although 75% also say employers should be allowed to
require drug testing of workers and applicants.</TE>
<TE>   Still, about half of the class of 2005, in line with their recent
predecessors, view themselves as "middle of the road" politically.
And 20.7% consider themselves conservative or "far right," while
29.9%--the highest figure since 1975--say they are liberal or "far
left."</TE>
<TE>   The latter figure has risen steadily since 1996, said Linda Sax,
an education professor and director of the 36th annual survey. But it
pales compared with the peak year in 1971, at the height of the
anti-Vietnam War fervor, when 40.9% of those polled called themselves
liberal.</TE>
<TE>   The American Freshman Survey, based this year on responses from
281,064 students at 421 four-year colleges and universities, is the
nation's oldest and most comprehensive assessment of student
attitudes. It is a joint project of UCLA's Higher Education Research
Institute and the American Council on Education, based in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   Freshmen usually fill out questionnaires during orientation or the
first week of classes, so their answers often reflect more on their
high school experiences than on those in college.</TE>
<TE>   Almost all of this year's forms were completed before Sept. 11, so
any changes in student attitudes as a result of the terrorist attacks
on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon would be reflected in next
year's results, survey directors said.</TE>
<TE>   Among the more striking findings of this year's poll was a
reversal in a long slide toward political apathy on college campuses,
probably attributable to the dramatic 2000 presidential contest, Sax
said.</TE>
<TE>   A growing, though still small, percentage of students now say they
frequently discuss politics and that it is important to them to keep
up to date with political affairs. And a record 47.5%--three times
greater than when the question was first asked in 1966--said they
participated in organized demonstrations in the previous year.</TE>
<TE>   Contrary to common perception, Astin said, there are more
demonstrations now--albeit smaller protests--than during the era best
known for student activism.</TE>
<TE>   "They feel freer [to protest], and there's an environment that's
acceptable," he said.</TE>
<TE>   UCLA freshman Ricardo Gutierrez, who took part in a recent campus
rally to support lower tuition for illegal immigrants, explained that
students "need to be involved if we want laws passed that we agree
with."</TE>
<TE>   "It's important to show people what we think," said Gutierrez, 18,
who is from Lamont, near Bakersfield. He said he tries to keep up
with political issues.</TE>
<TE>   Not all agreed. UCLA freshman Nate Skrzypczak said he paid close
attention during the presidential race, then quickly returned to what
he called his "usual disinterested self."</TE>
<TE>   "I don't see that [politics] really directly affects anyone," said
the 18-year-old from San Diego. "It just doesn't have that big an
impact on my life."</TE>
<TE>   Whether or not they are politically involved, many college
freshmen are anything but disengaged when it comes to community
service. This year's class reported record levels of volunteerism,
with 82.6% saying they had done some volunteer work in the last year.</TE>
<TE>   Although many high schools require community service for
graduation, and it can boost the prospects for a college applicant,
Astin said the desire to help appears to go well beyond that.</TE>
<TE>   Despite continuing evidence that today's students are relatively
materialistic--73.6% said they want to be very well off
financially--they also seem to want to find an outlet for what Astin
called their "higher selves."</TE>
<TE>   "They're much more inclined to express their concerns about other
people," he said, in contrast to previous generations of students.</TE>
<TE>   Volunteering "helps get your mind off yourself," said Christie
Tedmon, a UCLA freshman and a member of its top-ranked gymnastics
team. During high school in Sacramento, Tedmon joined many of her
classmates in helping repair the homes of elderly people and also
volunteered at a local hospital.</TE>
<TE>   "We owe it to the community to help out a little," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Patrick Hamo, 18, spent many hours in high school tutoring
disadvantaged children in a Glendale program started by his older
brother. "It really opens your eyes," the UCLA freshman said. "It
makes you realize how much you can do."</TE>
<TE>   Other trends emerged in this year's survey:</TE>
<TE>   * Of this year's freshmen, 70% said they had socialized with
someone of another racial or ethnic group in the last year--the
highest rate since the survey began.</TE>
<TE>   * Fewer students than before--19.5%--said they believed racial
discrimination was "no longer a major problem" in the United States,
and fewer thought affirmative action in college admissions should be
abolished.</TE>
<TE>   * A record 15.8% of freshmen said they have no religious
preference, up slightly from last year and more than double the
figure in 1966.</TE>
<TE>   * More students than ever appear to be academically disengaged. A
record 41.1% said they were frequently bored in class, and only 34.9%
reported spending at least six hours a week hitting the books as high
school seniors. In 1987, when the question was first asked, 47% said
they studied at least six hours each week.</TE>
<TE>   * This year's students continue to show signs of stress, worrying
about completing all the tasks confronting them. A gender gap
persists, with more than twice as many young women--36.6%--as young
men--17.4%--reporting feeling "frequently overwhelmed by all I have
to do."</TE>
<TE>   "These students never really get a chance to calm down," Sax said,
especially in the final, frenzied years of high school. "They're
multi-tasking on everything at once, trying to build these strong
resumes before they even get into college."</TE>

<HD>Foes Criticize Riordan's Bid to Take Credit for U.S.
Program</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHARLES ORNSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES HEALTH WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Richard Riordan's gubernatorial rivals Sunday criticized his attempt
to take credit for last week's federal approval of a California
program that would insure 300,000 working parents.</LD>
<LD>   Riordan's camp told The Times that a Bush administration official
gave them advance notice of the approval and then suggested that the
former Los Angeles mayor accept responsibility for influencing the
decision.</LD>
<LD>   Despite those comments, Riordan's two GOP rivals said they
continue to believe that the Republican White House will stay neutral
in the March 5 primary. To date, President Bush has made no
endorsement in the race, but Riordan has said he encouraged him to
run.</LD>
<TE>   "It sounds to me like by the time Mr. Riordan got to it, the horse
was already out of the barn," said Secretary of State Bill Jones, a
Republican. Riordan's advisors, he added, are still trying to give
the impression that he carries support from the White House, but that
perception "has not materialized."</TE>
<TE>   The rhetorical sparring match involves California's plan to
provide health insurance coverage to low-income parents whose
children are eligible for Medi-Cal or Healthy Families. After more
than a year of consideration in Washington, the proposal was
officially approved Friday by U.S. Health and Human Services
Secretary Tommy Thompson during a visit to Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "I lobbied for that," Riordan said earlier last week. "I had a lot
to do with getting it."</TE>
<TE>   Riordan has criticized Gov. Gray Davis' proposal to postpone the
start of the expanded Healthy Families program until July 2003.
Citing a budget deficit of more than $12 billion, Davis had said that
the delay would save $215 million.</TE>
<TE>   Reversing course Friday, Davis asked the Legislature to find the
money to implement the program this summer. The program would be open
to working parents who earn less than twice the federal poverty
level, which equals about $35,300 for a family of four.</TE>
<TE>   Steve Maviglio, a spokesman for Davis, said Sunday that Riordan
should not claim credit for the Healthy Families expansion to
low-income parents. Rather, federal approval resulted from continued
pressure by Davis appointees and health advocates over 13 months, he
said.</TE>
<TE>   "If they were trying to embarrass the governor, it didn't work,"
Maviglio said. "He [Riordan] had as much to do with getting this as
he had to do with the sun coming up this morning. Zero connection."</TE>
<TE>   Riordan and Davis are increasingly directing their attacks toward
one another, setting their eyes on the general election race. On
Friday, the Davis campaign unleashed a television commercial
criticizing Riordan's record on abortion rights. Riordan fired back
with a commercial criticizing Davis' personal attacks.</TE>
<TE>   When word spread Wednesday of the Bush administration's approval,
Riordan asked a reporter if he had been given credit for his support.
In a Jan. 18 letter, he said the program was "particularly important
to California as the state currently faces a serious and troublesome
budget deficit."</TE>
<TE>   "Did they mention me and my lobbying?" Riordan asked. "I'm sure
they did. I talked to Tommy Thompson and his chief of staff."</TE>
<TE>   A Jones campaign advisor said Riordan's bragging could backfire on
him and the White House.</TE>
<TE>   "Now you basically relegate the actions of the administration as
something that's just crass politics instead of something that's just
good public policy," said the advisor, who spoke on the condition of
anonymity.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a minor annoyance that somebody in the administration tipped
him off a little bit, but we're chuckling about ... the ham-handed,
silly way that they rolled it out."</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for businessman Bill Simon Jr., the third GOP
candidate, said the debate over the health insurance expansion has
been "a little jousting match between [Riordan] and the governor at
this point."</TE>
<TE>   "We don't see it as a big problem for us," spokesman Bob Taylor
said. "'We view this thing as a wide open race, and the White House
is not inserting itself into it, regardless of what Riordan says."</TE>
<TE>   Riordan's campaign spokeswoman, Carolina Guevara, said GOP
candidates "are missing the point on health care issues impacting
Californians."</TE>
<TE>   "The fact of the matter is that hundreds of thousands of
Californians are in need of health care," she said. "What the mayor
was trying to accomplish was to put additional pressure on Gov. Davis
to live up to his promise to expand the program."</TE>

<HD>He's Back--With a Mission</HD>
<DH>Education: Kennedy Elementary principal knows the Santa Ana
neighborhood. After all, he once lived there.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>H.G. REZA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Rick Mojarro calls it his "ministry": balancing roles as principal of
an overcrowded elementary school and leader of a parents group
working to improve the school and neighborhood, one of Santa Ana's
poorest.</LD>
<LD>   He is principal at Kennedy Elementary School on East McFadden
Avenue, across the street from the Minnie Street apartments, which
are among the most densely populated in Orange County.</LD>
<LD>   Mojarro, who lives in Tustin, is also president of the Cornerstone
Village Neighborhood Assn., a group of Minnie Street tenants whose
children make up a significant number of his students.</LD>
<TE>   For decades, the apartments were cash cows for absentee
landowners, who neglected the crumbling buildings crammed mostly with
Latino families, many of them undocumented immigrants. The area was a
haven for drug traffickers, prostitutes and gang members.</TE>
<TE>   Murders, assaults and drug deals were common. Lawlessness was so
rampant on Minnie Street that one landlord voluntarily turned over an
apartment to the Santa Ana Police Department, which still uses it for
a substation.</TE>
<TE>   When Mojarro, 41, was assigned as Kennedy's principal in 1999, he
knew the neighborhood only too well. He had lived on Minnie Street
for about two years after his family arrived from Mexico in 1968. His
parents and four of their five children were illegal immigrants,
Mojarro included.</TE>
<TE>   It was also on Minnie Street that Mojarro's brother was shot and
wounded in a misunderstanding over a parked truck eight years ago
while he was dropping off an employee of his landscaping business.</TE>
<TE>   After graduating from Santa Ana High School, Mojarro attended
college, earning a master's degree and teaching credentials. He then
traveled the world, teaching in private schools in Kenya, Germany and
Spain.</TE>
<TE>   Eventually, he returned to teach math at his old high school. He
was vice principal at another elementary school when he was tapped as
the principal for Kennedy in March 1999.</TE>
<TE>   It seemed that Mojarro's life had turned 360 degrees.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a ministry for me. I'm embracing the opportunity God gave
me by putting me back where I started," he said. "I'm trying to make
the most of it. It's my turn to give back to the children and parents
what my parents gave to me: an opportunity to succeed and better
their lives."</TE>
<TE>   Low Test Scores and an Exodus of Teachers</TE>
<TE>   It was a daunting task at the start. The school's API score at the
time was 393, the lowest in the district, Mojarro said.</TE>
<TE>   In 1999, nearly all of his teachers and staff resigned, forcing
Mojarro to hire a new staff for the 1999-2000 school year. He also
started that year with 17 substitute teachers.</TE>
<TE>   In a school where practically all of the students are learning
English as a second language and where some Mixtec children do not
even speak Spanish but an Indian dialect, optimism was in short
supply. Nevertheless, Mojarro's job was to improve test scores.</TE>
<TE>   "It's an impossible task as far as what the politicians want me to
do. It takes time. You don't learn a language as readily as you do a
skill. Some of these Indian kids come from rural areas and had no
schooling until they arrived on Minnie Street," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a challenge, but somebody has to take these kids. We take
them and work with them. Our success is beginning to show."</TE>
<TE>   API scores confirm Mojarro's assessment. Results released in
October show the campus' score jumped to 486.</TE>
<TE>   "I credit my incredibly hard-working staff and the kids' parents.
It's a proven fact that when you get parents involved, test scores
improve," Mojarro said.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, on a recent Wednesday night, three teachers were wrapping
up their day at 8 p.m., while a group of about 140 parents and kids
were jammed into a campus meeting room with a designated capacity of
92 persons.</TE>
<TE>   The parents' meeting with Mojarro began at 6 p.m. and was
conducted in Spanish. It segued from classroom issues to the need for
a traffic light on McFadden Avenue and a discussion about rents.</TE>
<TE>   At 7 p.m., a few city officials and four businessmen in suits
arrived, summoned by the Cornerstone Village Neighborhood Assn. to
explain the ongoing renovation of the Minnie Street apartments and
hear concerns about rent increases.</TE>
<TE>   Mojarro played a key role in organizing the association about
three years ago. The group lobbied the city to approve an
$8.1-million bond offering to renovate 527 apartments on Minnie
Street that are home to about 3,500 people.</TE>
<TE>   Santa Ana schools Supt. Al Mijares praised Mojarro's leadership
role in the Cornerstone Village Neighborhood Assn.</TE>
<TE>   "We encourage our principals to embrace the community. It's the
only way they can do their job effectively. You have to be involved
around the clock, not just in school," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Santa Ana Police Officer Ernie Conde, who has patrolled the Minnie
Street area for seven years, credits Mojarro and the association with
lowering the crime rate and improving tenants' quality of life.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a key player at the school and community. You see him
walking the neighborhood, talking to kids and parents. The people
have a tremendous amount of trust in him. He's given them the tools
that have empowered them and earned the respect of city officials and
the police," Conde said.</TE>
<TE>   Councilman Brett Franklin, who ran on the high school 440 relay
team with Mojarro, remembered him as quiet, "but someone you knew was
going to be a leader." Mojarro was also a running back on the
football team.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not surprised he became a teacher. He was always serious
about school. At track we would discuss literature. We also attended
church camps together and camped and backpacked together. I remember
discussing theology and philosophy with him on those trips. Rick was
a deep thinker," Franklin said.</TE>
<TE>   The two became lifelong friends even though Mojarro's modest
background contrasted sharply with Franklin's, who is from an old
Santa Ana family with a real estate business.</TE>
<TE>   But their socioeconomic differences were never a problem, Franklin
said.</TE>
<TE>   "Rick is representative of Santa Ana's rich cultural heritage. Our
diversity makes us a better community. I can't think of a better
principal for those kids and that community. He's walked in their
shoes," he said.</TE>
<TE>   That sentiment was echoed by Victoria Zaragoza, who has lived on
Minnie Street for more than 20 years.</TE>
<TE>   "If you look at the faces of the kids, you'll notice they're no
different from Rick's physical appearance. He is like a glove that
fit perfectly over our school and community. He knows the barriers
and obstacles these families face, because he had to overcome the
same things. His message is that education will help you better your
life," Zaragoza said.</TE>
<TE>   Computer Training and Literacy Classes Offered</TE>
<TE>   Mojarro hammers that message at parents, too. On Saturdays, many
take free computer and literacy classes.</TE>
<TE>   The school also offers Saturday classes to kids in kindergarten
through 12th grade who are still learning English.</TE>
<TE>   "High-achieving" students also flock to Mojarro's Saturday
classes. On Sunday, they heard an anatomy lecture from a UC Irvine
professor. In February, an architect will show them how to design and
build a pyramid.</TE>
<TE>   Kennedy was built for 450 students, but the current enrollment is
1,150, forcing Mojarro to run the school year-round on a quarterly
basis.</TE>
<TE>   At any given time, one quarter of the students are on vacation.
But being on vacation does not always excuse kids from attending
class, Mojarro said.</TE>
<TE>   "Right now, I've got kids who are supposed to be on vacation still
coming to school every day for special English classes. This shows
the commitment by the kids, parents and my teachers to turn things
around," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the overcrowding, Mojarro had Mijares' endorsement when
the principal converted a classroom into a family resource center
that is used daily for counseling, job searching and other
activities. On Saturdays, it doubles as a health center.</TE>
<TE>   "We're clear in our education mission," Mijares said. "But we're
also clear about meeting the community's social needs."</TE>
<TE>   The Kennedy experience is nothing less than a renaissance, Mojarro
said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's an exciting time for Latinos. We're an economic force, and
we're in Santa Ana to stay. Look at my kids' parents. They're
immigrants, poorly educated and maybe here illegally. But they're
involved, not just at school but in school board issues. I have
parents, and not just a few, who regularly attend board meetings," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   That was not the case three years ago, when Mojarro became
principal.</TE>
<TE>   He remembers arranging his first parents' meeting. He asked the
custodian to set up 50 chairs in the meeting room. Only five parents
showed up.</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody had ever given them a reason to show up before," Mojarro
said. "I have an advantage in that I truly understand their plight. I
see my mother and father in their faces, wondering how they're going
to pay the rent. I can connect with them, and I think they sense it."</TE>

<LD>When my parents got dumped by their medical insurance company and
found that a new plan was going to cost at least twice as much, they
asked my two cents' worth. My dad has a heart condition, so I told
him they ought to lay out some cash and get the best plan available.</LD>
<LD>   Now I realize it was bad advice. I should have told them to get a
couple of Saturday night specials and start knocking off convenience
stores.</LD>
<LD>   A California convict, serving time for a 1996 robbery in Los
Angeles, got a heart transplant on Jan. 3 at Stanford Medical Center.
A story by the Times' Mitchell Landsberg reported that the bill will
come to as much as $1 million. But the patient didn't have Blue
Cross, so you and I will be covering the tab.</LD>
<TE>   Now I'm not someone who will argue that prisoners surrender all
rights the moment the door slams shut. People often tell me they're
appalled that inmates have televisions or ball fields, and I can't
get worked up about it. I've been on the inside of enough prisons to
know there are no holidays there. What appalls me is that a huge
percentage of the prison population is doing time for simple drug
addiction, essentially, while deep-pocketed execs from the likes of
Enron and Arthur Andersen pillage and plunder and still walk the
streets.</TE>
<TE>   But getting back to the crooks who are actually behind bars, the
question is whether they should get taken care of when they're sick,
even if treatment is complicated and expensive. And the answer is
yes. They're still citizens, and more important, they're human
beings. The law doesn't offer a choice in the matter, anyway.</TE>
<TE>   But should it be the best care available when you and I are the
ones paying? Do we really want to make that kind of top-shelf
investment in the future of somebody who lives on a cell block?</TE>
<TE>   My dad worked his entire life, has not been in jail that I know
of, and pays a growing chunk of his fixed income on health care. The
only time he's been to Stanford is to see a football game. He's been
having a rough time lately because his doctors, forced by insurance
company bean counters to practice cut-rate, assembly-line medicine,
failed to treat him for a condition that was diagnosed two years ago.
A convict, meanwhile, is being fussed over at one of the finest
hospitals in the world, and my dad is paying for it.</TE>
<TE>   According to Landsberg's story, the average heart transplant costs
$209,000, plus $15,000 a year for follow-up treatment. That being the
case, it's not clear to me why this guy got the Cadillac of heart
transplants. Did state prison officials shop around at all? Have they
heard of priceline.com? Did it have to be Stanford?</TE>
<TE>   When I first heard about it, I wondered how this con managed to
get to the top of the waiting list. You don't just show up at the
hospital, have them zip you open, and go home with a new heart.
You've got to get your name on a list and wait your turn, and for
some people, that turn doesn't come in time. A lot of factors are
taken into account, such as the location of the donor heart, the
location of the recipient, the degree of illness, and other
compatibility factors.</TE>
<TE>   On the day this 31-year-old, two-time felon hit the jackpot, there
were 4,119 people in this country waiting for a new heart that might
save their lives. You have to wonder if a law-abiding, tax-paying
citizen drew one last breath while Jailhouse Joe was getting a second
wind.</TE>
<TE>   A person's moral standing ought to be irrelevant, a bioethicist
argued in Landsberg's story. "Should merit be considered a criteria?"
she asked skeptically. "Should organs go to people who are 'good,'
who have lived good lives?"</TE>
<TE>   Let me put it this way:</TE>
<TE>   Yes.</TE>
<TE>   When it comes to organ transplants, we're already playing God to a
certain degree, extending life beyond its natural course. I'm not
saying a prison inmate should never receive a life-saving medical
procedure. But when a fresh donor heart is on ice and the choice is
between a two-time loser or someone who doesn't wear a jumpsuit every
day, I don't have a problem giving extra points to the latter.</TE>
<TE>   Before his transplant, the inmate had applied for a so-called
compassionate release because of his condition. He might still get
one, because even though he's got a new pump, he may be classified as
terminally ill. Taking up a life of crime could be the smartest thing
this guy ever did.</TE>
<TE>   I've got to talk to my parents.</TE>

<HD>Growers Urging Action to Thwart Olive Fruit Fly</HD>
<DH>Agriculture: Farmers don't believe enough is being done to
control the pest. But state officials say eradication is impossible.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC BAILEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>For three generations there's been an Erickson growing olives in the
rich soil of Glenn County on the north end of the Central Valley.
John Erickson fears he could be the last, all because of a very small
but formidable foe: the olive fruit fly.</LD>
<LD>   Over the last three years the insect has hitchhiked up from its
roost among the ornamental olive trees of Los Angeles and infiltrated
vast portions of California's farm belt.</LD>
<LD>   And olive growers like Erickson don't believe enough is being done
to fight it.</LD>
<TE>   The spread of the pest has been alarming. The first was captured
in 1998, snagged by a trap set for Mediterranean fruit flies in
Westwood. In 1999, a single olive fruit fly was trapped in Tulare
County, which boasts more than half the state's commercial olive
acreage. By 2000, as many as 300 of the flies were found in the
county.</TE>
<TE>   Now state agriculture officials talk of reclassifying the fly,
shifting it from the cross hairs reserved for feared pests that need
to be stamped out. Instead, the olive fruit fly would be accepted as
a testy part of the natural environment in the Golden State, a pest
to be fought on a case-by-case basis like aphids on a rosebush.</TE>
<TE>   That, olive growers say, would be a stinging retreat that could
help drop the curtain on an industry that is unique in the country.
California is the nation's only olive-processing state.</TE>
<TE>   "If the fly cannot be controlled, it could potentially devastate
the industry," said Jan Nelson, manager of the California Olive
Committee, an industry group.</TE>
<TE>   Such widespread sentiments come as the state has poured huge sums
over the last few years into a battle against the glassy winged
sharpshooter, which threatens the wine industry. Olive growers gripe
that California agriculture officials have failed to mount a similar
effort to thwart a pest that threatens their industry.</TE>
<TE>   "We felt like a poor stepchild, because we are a small industry,"
Erickson said. "But it would have been nice to get a little money
thrown at us."</TE>
<TE>   State officials say such assessments don't recognize a flurry of
actions in recent years and the reality that the olive fruit fly has
established a firm hold in the state. Complete eradication, they say,
is now deemed impossible.</TE>
<TE>   Early on, the state attacked the problem as it has dangerous pests
in the past, from the Medfly to the sharpshooter, setting traps and
spraying infested areas. State agriculture scientists began looking
into it. Experts from Europe, where farmers have coexisted with the
fly for centuries, were brought in.</TE>
<TE>   The fly couldn't be stopped.</TE>
<TE>   "It quickly became obvious it had spread all over the place," said
Pat Minyard, the state Agriculture Department's pest-detection chief.</TE>
<TE>   Politics and economic realities also came into play. While the
wine industry enjoys considerable clout in Sacramento, the olive
industry is a relative pipsqueak by comparison. With 35,000 planted
acres, olives fetched $32 million in sales, contrasted with $2.8
billion for grapes in 2000, according to the state.</TE>
<TE>   The pest has set its sights on an agricultural commodity that of
late had seen a marked upsurge. Interest in olives has burgeoned over
the last decade with the growth among boutique farmers producing
high-quality extra virgin olive oil.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, the industry has until recently been among the most
organically oriented in the nation. Olive trees in California have
historically enjoyed a relatively pest-free existence. Chemical
treatments have rarely been needed.</TE>
<TE>   But the arrival of the fly changed all that.</TE>
<TE>   About a quarter-inch long with a yellowish head and clear wings
featuring a dark spot, the olive fruit fly bores into the tiny fruit,
depositing its larvae. As they grow, the larvae consume the meat of
the olive before emerging as mature flies.</TE>
<TE>   Farmers have tried the single brand of pesticide approved for use
on olive trees with some success. They also placed traps in trees
featuring a mix of bait and fly killer. And they're eyeing a
clay-based spray that coats the olives with a smudgy layer, making
them less inviting to the pest. One potential downside: Growers worry
that they might not be able to find easy and economical ways to rinse
the dirty layer off the olives.</TE>
<TE>   In Europe, where the olive fruit fly dates back 2,000 years in
historical records, the pest has a firm hold. When an infestation
hits, farmers in big olive-producing nations such as Spain and Italy
counter by spraying powerful chemicals allowed under their looser
pesticide rules. Even then, infestations can claim more than 10% of a
crop.</TE>
<TE>   California growers wince at the thought of losing even 1% of their
crop. With no sure-fire way of detecting fruit that is infested, a
maggot-filled olive could occasionally find its way into a can, a
quick way to lose the even most avid olive aficionado.</TE>
<TE>   "If they start rejecting loads, then it won't be very long before
you'd be out of business," said Erickson, who farms 200 acres of
table olives near Orland, a tiny town west of Chico. "It could be the
end of our industry."</TE>
<TE>   Though the pest doesn't infest the trees themselves, just the
fruit, only a season or two of squandered harvests would shut down
the last two olive canneries in California, industry officials say.</TE>
<TE>   So far, most groves in the Central Valley have avoided intense
infestations. Growers say it's unclear if that is because of the
valley's hot summers and cold winters.</TE>
<TE>   But it's a different story on the coast, where the mild climate
acts as the perfect incubator.</TE>
<TE>   Nick Sciabica, a third-generation olive producer, normally picks
from trees in Santa Clara County that line freeway medians and
backyards around the region. This year, he couldn't touch them
because of the level of infestation. The same went for crops he
normally takes in from San Diego County and Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   The Napa County wine region, home to some of the state's new
gourmet olive oil producers, could prove a particularly juicy target
for the fly, Sciabica said. An infestation could taint the olive oil,
pushing gourmet brands off the shelf.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm getting near to hysterical worried," Sciabica said. "It could
be we're just not going to be able to pick olives this year. I think
we're heading for either a partial or a 100% disaster."</TE>
<TE>   As they continue to fight the pest, farmers see one way the public
can help, particularly in Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   The Southland is home to tens of thousands of ornamental olive
trees, some dating back to Spanish mission days. Those lovely,
gnarled-bark trees produce fruit that can host an army of flies to
power continual incursions into farm regions.</TE>
<TE>   "There's this reservoir of fruit flies that never goes away,"
Erickson said. "They just keep coming over from the coast."</TE>
<TE>   Olive farmers are calling on residents to help reduce such
problems by preventing the appearance of the fruit. It can be done
simply enough, either by applying a special spray or using a garden
hose to wash off blossoms during springtime.</TE>
<TE>   In the farm country, officials are laying plans to more
effectively wage war. Several counties, including Tulare, Glenn and
Tehama, are expected in the next few months to launch pest-control
districts specifically aimed at the olive fruit fly. The districts
can take aggressive steps, from uprooting infested trees to spraying,
paying for it with assessments on olive growers.</TE>
<TE>   Minyard of the state Agriculture Department says such steps can
help keep the pest in check.</TE>
<TE>   "The industry is going to have to adapt to it," he said. "It's
going to change the way everybody does business, no question about
it."</TE>

<LD>Police and sheriff's deputies in San Diego County were at fault in
more than half of all traffic collisions involving officers in recent
years, a newspaper reported.</LD>
<LD>   Most of the crashes were minor, but local law enforcement agencies
have spent $10 million to settle claims resulting from the
collisions, records show.</LD>
<LD>   The Sheriff's Department was to blame in 56% of the 626 crashes
since 1997. The San Diego Police Department was found responsible for
58% of 1,672 collisions since 1996, the San Diego Union-Tribune
reported.</LD>
<TE>   Smaller departments have even higher at-fault rates. Officers in
National City were found to blame for 81% of the 68 crashes since
1997. Police say they aren't surprised. They point out that officers
are required to listen to radio traffic, look for unusual activity,
monitor portable computers and run license plate checks--all in
addition to driving.</TE>

<HD>Ensuring Port Safety, 1 Ship at a Time</HD>
<DH>Risk: For sea marshals, fighting terrorism means boarding
and searching ships despite the peril.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LOUIS SAHAGUN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Armed with pistols and batons, they set to sea before dawn on Sunday,
boring in on a luxury cruise liner plying from Cabo San Lucas, and
still about five miles beyond the Los Angeles harbor breakwater.</LD>
<LD>   After matching speeds with the 70,300-ton Elation and nestling up
against its starboard side, the six sea marshals jumped off their
smaller craft and onto the cruise liner's wobbly rope ladder--then
advanced to prearranged positions and tasks.</LD>
<LD>   "Don't be complacent," advised sea marshal team leader Richard
Greenbauer. "Keep alert. Be safe."</LD>
<TE>   The mission of these U.S. Coast Guard reservists--a San Juan
Capistrano city planner, a state Fish and Game Department officer, a
UCLA drug abuse researcher, a Los Angeles County public safety
officer, and two port police officers--was to ensure that there was
no one on board with plans to turn the 2,040-passenger vessel into a
massive battering ram, or floating bomb.</TE>
<TE>   Their takeover was swift, efficient and friendly. But all were
specially trained to, as one of them put it, "use deadly force, if it
hits the fan."</TE>
<TE>   Since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, the mantra around the Los
Angeles-Long Beach port complex, which is the nation's busiest, has
been simple: Leave nothing to chance.</TE>
<TE>   Each year, the ports handle more than 1 million passengers, 5,500
commercial vessels and $170 billion of commerce. In addition, more
than 272 million barrels of oil are loaded and offloaded annually.</TE>
<TE>   Now, every incoming cruise liner and oil tanker--and most
freighters--are boarded and examined miles from shore, then escorted
into port by the newly formed corps of sea marshals trained to
neutralize terrorists and weapons of mass destruction.</TE>
<TE>   Boarding moving vessels on the high seas is dangerous work. In
late November, a sea marshals' craft capsized in the dark in heaving
seas beside a cruise liner about 10 miles beyond the local
breakwater, spilling five officers into the water. All were rescued,
including a woman trapped beneath the topsy-turvy boat.</TE>
<TE>   In late October, a Coast Guard officer preparing to step off his
cutter and onto a vessel in the San Francisco Bay was seriously
bruised when his leg was caught between the ships.</TE>
<TE>   Despite an oncoming storm, the boarding of the Carnival Corp.'s
Elation at 5:30 a.m. on Sunday went without a hitch.</TE>
<TE>   Sea marshal team leader Greenbauer greeted the Elation's captain
and examined the vessel's manifests. Amber Horning stood guard in the
pilot house.</TE>
<TE>   Four others roamed the ship's elegant interior for signs of
anything out of the ordinary, including odd behavior by the crew or
passengers.</TE>
<TE>   They inspected the baggage room and kitchen, strode through
neon-lit halls and cabaret lounges, and peeked inside life boats and
bathrooms, under desks and machinery, even inside fire extinguisher
boxes.</TE>
<TE>   Marching into the engine control room--a brightly lit compartment
crammed with dials, gauges, computer screens, clocks and wall-sized
schematics of the ship and its hundreds of cabins, sea marshal Dennis
Chastain asked, "How's the trip been? Everything OK here?"</TE>
<TE>   Two crew members, surprised by the armed visitors, nodded in the
affirmative and returned to their computer screens.</TE>
<TE>   All told, the ship was declared secure and safe within 30 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Shortly after docking in San Pedro at about 7 a.m., Elation Capt.
Alessandro Gelotto, said, "We have our own security force. But I'm
delighted with the sea marshals. We feel safer having them on board."</TE>
<TE>   Passenger Larry Burnside, a log cabin builder from Marion, Ind.,
was more blunt.</TE>
<TE>   Drinking a cup of coffee on the top deck, he smiled and said,
"First thing I saw this morning were fellas with pistols on their
hips, and man, I was glad to see them. Tickled to death."</TE>
<TE>   Vacationing airline pilot Mike Magras, of Tucson, agreed, to a
point.</TE>
<TE>   "I wonder how effective a handful of agents can be inspecting a
ship of this size," he said. "It's got an unimaginable number of
places to hide."</TE>
<TE>   Then there was hairdresser Lynda Renner of Minneapolis, who
insisted that a pair of sea marshals pose for a snapshot as the
cruise liner slid past the Vincent Thomas Bridge.</TE>
<TE>   "I wouldn't know what a bomb even looks like," she said. "So I'm
glad there's guys coming up to make sure we're not going to be used
by someone out to make international news."</TE>

<HD>State Says U.S. to Be Generous With Anti-Terror Funds</HD>
<DH>Threats: Gov. Davis has asked for $350 million, and the
California security chief says the risks remain, despite the passage
of time.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CARL INGRAM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>State security chief George Vinson predicted Sunday that the federal
government will be generous in meeting Gov. Gray Davis' appeal for
$350 million to help offset the costs of fighting terrorism in
California.</LD>
<LD>   Vinson said he based his confidence on a meeting he attended
Thursday at the White House with President Bush and Tom Ridge, the
nation's director of homeland security.</LD>
<LD>   It is not known how much financial support the federal government
will provide, Vinson said, but "we are optimistic" that Bush and
Congress will deliver substantial sums to California.</LD>
<TE>   From Sept. 11 until Jan. 1, the state's anti-terrorism costs
totaled about $120 million and are expected to increase to $400
million in the coming year, Vinson said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not in the bank, but this is the first step to say, 'The
check's in the mail,' " Steve Maviglio, the governor's press
secretary, said of the expected federal contribution.</TE>
<TE>   Vinson, a retired FBI counter-terrorism expert, attended the White
House meeting with security directors from other states for an update
on terrorism and efforts to fight it.</TE>
<TE>   To help fill a projected $12-billion shortfall in his proposed
state budget, Davis envisions receiving more than $1 billion in
federal aid, including the $350 million in terrorism-related
expenditures. The Highway Patrol would consume approximately $90
million for a vast expansion of its anti-terrorist duties.</TE>
<TE>   But critics of the Democratic governor's budget plan have said
Davis should expect considerably less from the federal government
because it is struggling with its own revenue and budget problems.</TE>
<TE>   In a telephone interview with reporters, Vinson said Sunday that
the president is expected to announce in his State of the Union
speech that he will seek nearly $38 billion to wage the domestic war
on terrorism. He said Bush described this as "only the beginning" of
his homeland defense initiative.</TE>
<TE>   The president's program will pay special attention to enhancing
efforts to combat potential cases of bioterrorism, strengthen
protection of the country's international borders and seaports, and
provide training and equipment for "first responders," including
police, fire and medical personnel, Vinson said.</TE>
<TE>   He said officials want aid to be channeled through the Federal
Emergency Management Agency to the states. In turn, the states would
keep some for their needs and then pass funds to local governments.
Police, fire and medical personnel would be a top priority, Vinson
said.</TE>
<TE>   Vinson said Americans may have switched their primary attention
from terrorist threats in the months since Sept. 11, but "threats are
still coming in" nationally and in California.</TE>
<TE>   "We in the business are still concerned about credible threats
that we have to analyze and prepare to defend against," he said.</TE>
<TE>   He did not discuss specific threats, but said the federal
government is close to announcing a four-tiered system to guide state
and local officials in deciding when the public should be alerted.</TE>
<TE>   Davis got himself into a controversy in November when he announced
that four California suspension bridges had been targeted for
terrorist action. The FBI later said the threat was not credible.
Vinson has defended the governor's decision.</TE>

<HD>O.C. League Given Red Card in Quest for Fields of Green</HD>
<DH>Sports: Huntington Beach soccer teams refuse to stop
playing weekends at school sites from which they have been banned and
deny they leave areas a mess.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENNIFER MENA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The school fields are there. They're generally empty on Sundays. So
why not use them for recreational games, the men of the Huntington
Beach Soccer League wonder.</LD>
<LD>   It's because the players leave the fields a mess, officials with
the Ocean View School District contend. The Huntington Beach-based
district has banned the soccer league's men from using fields at its
15 elementary and middle schools.</LD>
<LD>   The adult soccer league says it hires janitors to clean up after
games. And its 500 members refuse to back down from their weekly
games at the three campuses they regularly use.</LD>
<TE>   League president Felipe Zapata said he has begged the school
district to change its policies because he believes promoting sports
in the Latino community is to everyone's benefit.</TE>
<TE>   "I told them I will not run the players out. I told them, 'You run
them out,'" Zapata said. "We are not doing anything wrong. We even
pay people to clean up. We really feel we are being treated like
second-class citizens."</TE>
<TE>   Zapata began the league two years ago after noticing that many
Huntington Beach residents were playing in other cities. Zapata had
already organized 200 children in the Club Pachuca League and he
believed an adult league would prove popular.</TE>
<TE>   The league has grown from six to 30 teams despite the lack of
legal playing fields.</TE>
<TE>   "Soccer is a great way for young people to get involved in
sports," Zapata said. "They play, they relax. It's a therapy. It's
much better than drinking or gangs."</TE>
<TE>   The mayor sympathizes with the players but she has no authority to
change the situation.</TE>
<TE>   "I really feel for the situation they are in. They have a growing
number of people who want to play soccer and no facilities to do it,"
Mayor Debbie Cook said. "It's all school property so we cannot change
the policy, and the city has limited field space."</TE>
<TE>   But Carol Stocker, chief operations and facilities officer for
Ocean View, said the league creates "a nuisance. The real difficulty
is that they leave a lot of trash and debris behind. They are abusive
of the fields." If they don't stop and there are any problems with
use of the fields, she said, the district will call police. So far,
it has not done so.</TE>
<TE>   The charge against the players would be trespassing, but the
Police Department would rather work with the players and the district
to solve the problem, Lt. Chuck Thomas said. There have been no
neighbor complaints about the players, police said. But district
officials said they have received complaints about trash left behind.</TE>
<TE>   "This puts the police in a bad position. They have other
priorities and they don't want to tell [the players] to stop playing
when the only law they are breaking is that they don't have a permit
to play there," said Ron Hagan, the city's director of community
services. "You can't blame the school district because adults bring
alcohol, food and noise to neighborhoods. That doesn't mean there is
not a need and it is [not] a positive activity."</TE>
<TE>   League members deny that their activities cause any problems and
say that they hire people to clean up after them.</TE>
<TE>   State laws gives school district the discretion to decide who can
use their fields during off-hours, said Roger Wolfertz, deputy
general counsel for the California Department of Education. The
schools cannot use that discretion in a discriminatory way, said
Michael Hersher, deputy counsel for the department.</TE>
<TE>   Among those school systems in Orange County that allow leagues to
use their fields are the Huntington Beach City, Santa Ana Unified and
Fountain Valley districts.</TE>

<CX>   Soccer field--A caption on a photo that appeared in the Jan. 28
California section incorrectly suggested that female soccer players in
the photo were adults who were allowed to play on a field where men were
prohibited from playing. The players in the photo were children who are
allowed to play on the field. No adults are allowed on the field. The
caption incorrectly identified the school field as a park.</CX>

<LD>A Ventura mortgage broker has been charged in federal court with
three counts of mail fraud in connection with a lending scheme that
allegedly bilked several Ventura County residents and more than a
dozen other California investors out of nearly $4.6 million.</LD>
<LD>   Larry Curtis Waltz, former owner of a Ventura-based lending
agency, is expected to plead guilty to the charges when he appears in
federal court in downtown Los Angeles on Feb. 4, said his attorney,
Gary Lincenberg.</LD>
<LD>   Federal prosecutors allege that while operating Larry Waltz and
Associates in Ventura, Waltz put together an elaborate real estate
investment scheme.</LD>
<TE>   Waltz told investors, many of whom were elderly and on fixed
incomes, that they could expect monthly interest income if they
agreed to lend money to people buying a home or refinancing existing
properties, said Angela Davis, the assistant U.S. attorney
prosecuting the case.</TE>
<TE>   Investors Allegedly Shown Phony Papers</TE>
<TE>   Investors said they were promised that at the end of the term of
the loan, about five years, they would receive their money back in
one lump sum.</TE>
<TE>   They signed money over to Waltz after he showed them paperwork
from alleged applicants, Davis said. But most of the names were false
or used without the person's permission, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "[Waltz] would tell [potential investors] of an opportunity and he
would provide a borrower's name, but he had made up the borrowers,"
Davis said.</TE>
<TE>   "He had this idea that he could tell people, 'Gee, there is a
gorgeous house, a borrower and a really good second mortgage.'
Investors would say, 'Sure, I'll make an investment.' "</TE>
<TE>   Monthly interest payments, from the supposed borrowers, actually
were pulled from the accounts of other investors doing business with
Waltz, Davis said.</TE>
<TE>   Waltz acknowledged his guilt in letters sent in January 2001 to
the more than two dozen investors who lost money.</TE>
<TE>   "You have wrongfully entrusted money to me to invest on your
behalf," Waltz wrote. "I have wrongfully placed this money in risky
investments, which you did not authorize. These investments failed. I
have only a limited ability to repay you."</TE>
<TE>   Broker Said Clients Could Be Repaid</TE>
<TE>   Waltz wrote that he "no doubt violated a number of laws" but
expressed hope that two investments "still have a chance of producing
funds, which would enable me to pay back you and other investors."</TE>
<TE>   He was not available for comment.</TE>
<TE>   Lincenberg said Waltz has resigned from the company he started and
has lost his real state broker's license.</TE>
<TE>   "This is hard on him, and it's not going to be easy to deal with,"
Lincenberg said. "It was eating at him and he felt bad. He didn't
want to continue the wrongdoing."</TE>
<TE>   Under the terms of federal sentencing guidelines, Davis will ask
U.S. District Judge Margaret Morrow to sentence Waltz to at least 18
months in prison and require him to repay the investors, Davis said.</TE>
<TE>   "Restitution is mandated in this case," Davis said. "It can't be
part of any bankruptcy. He will be paying the rest of his life unless
he wins the lottery."</TE>
<TE>   Retired Camarillo engineer Horst Funfstuck, 71, said he lost a
small fortune to Waltz when he agreed to hand over more than $1
million to the broker, starting in 1994. Funfstuck said he was
searching for low-risk investments to cushion his retirement.</TE>
<TE>   Funfstuck has recovered about half of what he invested but is
uncertain about the remainder.</TE>

<HD>School Grows From New 'Core'</HD>
<DH>Education: Moorpark campus is county's first to try
curriculum that uses six subjects, each building on the other through
grade levels.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENIFER RAGLAND</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>At Peach Hill School in Moorpark, first-graders can tell you all
about the life and work of artist Georgia O'Keeffe. Kindergartners
can name the seven world continents. Second-graders can rattle off
details about the Civil War.</LD>
<LD>   These and other concepts in history, geography and fine
arts--often not taught until middle or high school--are being
devoured by children at Peach Hill under its new "core knowledge"
curriculum.</LD>
<LD>   Developed by University of Virginia professor E.D. Hirsch Jr., the
curriculum is an outline of specific lessons in six subjects, each
building on the others through the grade levels.</LD>
<TE>   Supporters say the approach reduces repetition in teaching, levels
the playing field among students from varying backgrounds and sparks
a thirst for learning.</TE>
<TE>   Although the curriculum is popular on the East Coast and in the
South, Peach Hill is the first school in Ventura County--and only one
of a handful in Southern California--to embrace it.</TE>
<TE>   "The kids are so excited, and they're applying a lot of what
they're being taught," Principal Donna Welch said. "In order to
really learn anything, you have to make those kinds of connections."</TE>
<TE>   And at Peach Hill, where the percentage of students who speak
little or no English and come from poor homes is twice the district
average, educators say the curriculum has done even more. It has
reinvigorated a school community that has long struggled against
negative perceptions.</TE>
<TE>   The K-3 campus was at the center of a controversial desegregation
plan a few years ago, and then scored lowest among elementary schools
in Moorpark Unified School District on the state's standardized
tests.</TE>
<TE>   As those factors increasingly translated into decreased
enrollment, district officials, teachers and parents decided to take
action.</TE>
<TE>   A committee spent months researching various programs, holding
public meetings and visiting schools around the state before choosing
to make Peach Hill a core knowledge school.</TE>
<TE>   One of the biggest selling points, teachers and parents said, was
the curriculum's promises to bridge the well-documented student
achievement gap between haves and have-nots, and to cater to a wide
spectrum of learners--from those struggling to speak English to the
highest achievers.</TE>
<TE>   Because most of the concepts in history and art are new to such
young children, all students come in at the same knowledge level.
That is not true with subjects such as reading or math, in which
knowledge can vary depending on English-speaking ability or whether a
child attended preschool, teachers said.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone is hearing it for the first time, so we present it with
pictures and explanations that bring complicated topics to their
level," said Linnea Brecunier, the school's reading specialist. "The
sky is the limit for the really bright kids, but the lower-level kids
get it too."</TE>
<TE>   Another facet of the curriculum is a long list of sayings that
children learn in each grade. These expressions and proverbs, such as
"fish out of water" and "great oaks from little acorns grow," are a
part of American culture that everyone should know, according to
Hirsch.</TE>
<TE>   "The sayings help the English-language learners a lot," said
kindergarten teacher Irma Barragan. "They hear these things
everywhere, but they don't make sense when you try to translate them
literally."</TE>
<TE>   Hirsch's 1988 book "Cultural Literacy" is what inspired the
sequenced curriculum, said Cyndi Wells, director of teacher
development for the Virginia-based Core Knowledge Foundation.</TE>
<TE>   The theory evolved after Hirsch discovered that many students in
his college classes lacked general knowledge, including basic
principles of constitutional government, important events in world
history and widely acknowledged masterpieces of art and music, Wells
said.</TE>
<TE>   At Peach Hill, the core knowledge sequences have given a focus and
inspired teachers to be more creative in devising lesson plans, Welch
said.</TE>
<TE>   Children are still learning language and math skills required by
the state, she said, but they are doing so while being engaged in
rich and interesting subjects.</TE>
<TE>   For example, because second-graders now study the history of
America's western expansion, teacher Carol Hartnett has them practice
their writing skills by composing letters from the perspective of
pioneer children and deliver them in a reenactment of the Pony
Express.</TE>
<TE>   "In the past, we might have them write a letter to grandma or a
pen pal," she said. "This is so much more motivating."</TE>
<TE>   Parent Kim DiCecco can attest to that. Three of her children went
through Peach Hill before the new curriculum began, and her daughter
is a second-grader now.</TE>
<TE>   "She comes home just spilling over with enthusiasm and excitement
from what she's learned," DiCecco said. "That didn't happen before."</TE>
<TE>   Most appealing to her, DiCecco said, is the way the lessons build
on each other, and that every classroom in each grade level is
teaching the same thing.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no reinventing the wheel," she said.</TE>
<TE>   The sequential nature of the program can be a challenge, however,
particularly in communities with high transiency rates.</TE>
<TE>   Officials at Donald F. Bradach Elementary School near Victorville,
where core knowledge has been used for four years, said students who
enter the curriculum in later grades sometimes struggle to catch up.</TE>
<TE>   But they say the content and hands-on approach resonates with
children who have historically had problems in school.</TE>
<TE>   Several independent evaluators of the core knowledge program have
found correlations between cultural literacy and academic
achievement, Wells said.</TE>
<TE>   A May 2000 study in Oklahoma City, for example, found that nearly
all students who were in a core knowledge program for one year scored
higher on a basic-skills test than a group of similar students taught
with a traditional curriculum.</TE>
<TE>   Welch said she believes core knowledge will become more popular in
California as teachers and principals learn about its benefits.</TE>
<TE>   "It offers something that has been lacking in the curriculum," she
said.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we're on the forefront, and I think we're going to see it
more and more."</TE>
<TE>   Teachers said that even if test-score improvement does not
materialize right away, they know the program has changed the school
for the better.</TE>
<TE>   This year, enrollment at Peach Hill is up, and some children who
had been removed by their parents have returned.</TE>
<TE>   "The test scores shook parent confidence in us," Brecunier said.
"And now it's back--exponentially."</TE>

<HD>House May Make Historic Move</HD>
<DH>Preservation: Owners of the Victorian Rose Bed &amp; Breakfast
inn are awaiting the city's approval to relocate a 127-year-old
gothic residence in Ventura.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KEVIN F. SHERRY</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>One of the oldest houses in the county could be on the move, if the
owners of a Ventura bed and breakfast have their way.</LD>
<LD>   The 127-year-old Herbert House at 351 E. Thompson Blvd. sits empty
next to a vacant lot, surrounded by a chain-link fence. But Nona and
Richard Bogatch, owners of the Victorian Rose Bed &amp; Breakfast, a
converted church, want to move the house several blocks east to their
property.</LD>
<LD>   Because the Bogatches would need to make changes to their
property, they must obtain permission from the city, and neighbors
will be asked for their input.</LD>
<TE>   At least one neighbor said he wouldn't mind.</TE>
<TE>   Ivor Davis, who lives across from where the house would sit, said,
"It certainly is an interesting idea." He added that the Bogatches
have shown their dedication to preservation through their work on the
bed and breakfast. "I have a great deal of admiration for both of
them for what they've done."</TE>
<TE>   The 32,200-square-foot lot on which the house sits is for sale for
$2.1 million. The site will offer visitors to downtown their first
view of the city once the Ventura Freeway offramp is moved to Oak
Street from California Street. The 18-month offramp reconfiguration
is scheduled to begin in the summer of 2004.</TE>
<TE>   The McFerrin Group, which owns the home and the land, planned to
raze the structure, said Donna Moore, the group's director of
management. But Moore was willing to sell, or even give away, the
historic home to save it.</TE>
<TE>   "If you just pick it up and move it, we would be happy," Moore
said. "The problem is, it's so expensive to move."</TE>
<TE>   Only Part of the House Could Survive Move</TE>
<TE>   The Bogatches are petitioning the city to let them relocate a part
of the house to sit next to their bed and breakfast at 896 E. Main
St. The 1,500-square-foot house has several rooms, although only the
oldest, original portion is structurally sound enough to survive
transport, Richard Bogatch said.</TE>
<TE>   The couple plans to renovate and restore the house, which would
become their residence. "As it is now, we live in the basement [of
the bed and breakfast]," he Bogatch said.</TE>
<TE>   If given city approval, the couple will get the house for free and
only have to pay the cost of the move. The move and subsequent
renovation would cost about $100,000, Richard Bogatch said.</TE>
<TE>   House Would Fit With Their Gothic Church</TE>
<TE>   The relocated house would face Kalorama Street, and would require
removal of a hedge, a tree and one or two of the site's six parking
spaces. Because the house has some gothic elements, it would fit well
with their 1888 gothic church, Nona Bogatch said.</TE>
<TE>   "Our gables match the gables of the little house," she said. "We
want it to look as if it's as original as possible."</TE>
<TE>   Their plan requires a series of approvals from the city. On
Monday, the Historic Preservation Committee will review the proposal,
said Brian Randall, an assistant city planner. The move also will
need approval from the Design Review Committee and Planning
Commission, Randall said.</TE>
<TE>   The city supports the preservation of the old house, he said. "We
do look at it as historically significant."</TE>
<TE>   The house was built in 1875 for Lafette R. Herbert, according to
Charles Johnson, librarian for the Ventura County Historical Society.</TE>
<TE>   Additions were made in 1890 and 1892. It is the only house in town
with gothic details, Johnson said.</TE>
<TE>   Local historian Judy Triem, who has a pencil drawing of the house
in her home, said, "It reflects the simplicity of the earliest
buildings in Ventura."</TE>

reconfigured in 2004.</CP>

<HD>Storm Dumps Rain, Snow--and Isn't Done Yet</HD>
<DH>Weather: Rescue crews respond to dozens of accidents.
Showers expected again today, but precipitation totals still behind
normal.</DH>

<LD>A rare January dry spell ended Sunday as a cold, slow-moving storm
from the Pacific Northwest pelted Ventura County with rain and
created the usual traffic tangles on streets and freeways.</LD>
<LD>   More showers are forecast for today, with clearing expected by
Tuesday, said Bruce Rockwell, a meteorologist with the National
Weather Service in Oxnard.</LD>
<LD>   Highs along the coast will be in the mid-50s, with lows in the
mid-40s, Rockwell said. Daytime highs inland will be about the same,
but the lows will dip into the mid- to low 30s, he said.</LD>
<TE>   By Tuesday, the snow level will drop to between 2,000 and 3,000
feet and up to 6 inches of new snow is expected at Mt. Pinos,
Rockwell said.</TE>
<TE>   Most areas of the county have received between 4 and 5 inches of
rainfall since November, about 50% below normal totals for January.</TE>
<TE>   "It's pretty dry for this time of year, but it's not
unprecedented," Rockwell said. "We still have two to three months to
go, so we could get back to normal with a couple of wet months."</TE>
<TE>   The latest storm could dump up to an inch of rain inland and
nearly half an inch along the coast, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Slick driving conditions Sunday caused a traffic mess as rescue
crews and police officers responded to dozens of collisions and
fender benders.</TE>
<TE>   About 11:50 a.m., a pickup truck heading north on Ventura Road
near 9th Street in Oxnard crossed a center median and slammed into a
southbound Ford Windstar minivan that was carrying three adults and
two small children, police said. The truck flipped over.</TE>
<TE>   Oxnard firefighters used equipment to free the occupants from both
vehicles.</TE>
<TE>   The driver of the pickup, Felicia McBride, 42, of Oxnard was
reported in stable condition at Ventura County Medical Center with a
broken femur and multiple cuts on her face and body, Oxnard Police
Cmdr. Tom Chronister said.</TE>
<TE>   A passenger in the minivan suffered a severe head injury and was
undergoing surgery at St. John's Regional Medical Center in Oxnard,
Chronister said.</TE>
<TE>   One other person remained hospitalized and three were treated for
minor injuries and released.</TE>
<TE>   Ventura Road was closed in both directions for about two hours,
Chronister said. No one was cited in the accident, but the cause was
still being investigated.</TE>

<HD>Welcome to Another Quarterback Controversy</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>J.A. Adande</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>PITTSBURGH</DL>
<LD>A quarterback controversy just got dropped into the middle of Super
Bowl hype week. Bad combination. The country's largest media
gathering tempted with one of sports' juiciest topics. It'll be like
a hive of angry bees swarming over a tank full of sharks in a feeding
frenzy.</LD>
<LD>   It looked as if we were set for a heavy dose of the Tom Brady
story. You know, backup comes in and leads team to Super Bowl. So
Kurt Warner, so Y2K.</LD>
<LD>   Then Brady went down with an ankle injury and Drew Bledsoe came in
for the last 311/2 minutes of New England's 24-17 AFC championship
game victory over the Pittsburgh Steelers on Sunday.</LD>
<TE>   Bledsoe, who threw a touchdown pass and made a key third-down pass
in the fourth quarter, can't be expected to just disappear and make
this tidy.</TE>
<TE>   This is Drew Bledsoe. The guy who quarterbacked the Patriots in
their last trip to the Super Bowl five seasons ago. The guy the
Patriots signed to a 10-year, $103-million contract last March.</TE>
<TE>   But Brady kept the Patriots' season from falling apart when
Bledsoe was injured in the second game. He's the guy who played well
enough to convince Coach Bill Belichick to let him keep the job after
Bledsoe recovered from the injured blood vessel in his chest. The
Patriots went 12-3 with Brady as a starter, including that
snow-covered victory over Oakland in the divisional playoffs. He made
the Pro Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   Now, among the multitude of questions asked by the 803,532
reporters in New Orleans this week, we're sure to hear one posed to
Belichick again and again: "Who will be your starting quarterback?"</TE>
<TE>   Who should be the quarterback? It's the ultimate barroom question.
Which is fitting, since New Orleans is the ultimate bar town. But
this isn't something to be decided over hurricanes at Pat O'Brien's.
The direction of the Patriots--indeed, the future of several
franchises--is hanging in the balance.</TE>
<TE>   If Brady had kept rolling it would have been very easy for the
Patriots to be cost-efficient, make Brady (2001 salary: $289,000)
their guy and look to move Bledsoe. That would provide salary-cap
relief plus an influx of talented players or draft picks.</TE>
<TE>   The Chicago Bears, Washington Redskins and Tampa Bay Buccaneers
are among the teams that could use Bledsoe's services.</TE>
<TE>   But if he starts and wins the Super Bowl, how could the Patriots
get rid of him? The Baltimore Ravens cast aside Trent Dilfer after
they won last year, so would that just become the NFL's new trend?</TE>
<TE>   That's getting a little ahead of ourselves. He won't get a chance
to win the game if he doesn't start. Here was Belichick's response
the first time The Question was asked:</TE>
<TE>   "We'll take a look at Tom's situation and we'll make an evaluation
there and we'll talk about that and make the decision later on in the
week," Belichick said.</TE>
<TE>   And he'll try to say "and" as many times as possible to throw
everyone off the scent.</TE>
<TE>   The first order of business is the status of Brady's ankle.
Pittsburgh's Lee Flowers hit his leg from behind with 1:40 left in
the second quarter, bending Brady over backward and rolling the
ankle.</TE>
<TE>   Brady limped around the sideline and limped up the steps to the
midfield stage for the AFC championship trophy presentation. When
asked if he could have gone back in Sunday, Brady smiled that smile
of his, the one that rates a nine out of 10 on the John Elway Scale
of teeth size.</TE>
<TE>   "That's a good question," Brady said. "I mean, Drew goes in there
and does a great job, and I'm not 100%. So Coach made the call. I'd
have been ready if he decided, 'Hey Tom, go ahead and go get it.' But
we were doing a pretty good job out there."</TE>
<TE>   Give Bledsoe credit for being ready to step into this
pressure-packed situation even though he has had very little practice
with the first-team players.</TE>
<TE>   Bledsoe wasn't happy--who would be?--so he simply avoided the
media so he wouldn't spout off. ("I missed you guys," he joked when
he stepped to the microphone after the game.)</TE>
<TE>   Bledsoe's day was much more than the numbers: 10 for 21 for 102
yards and no interceptions. The touch he showed on a third-and-11
pass he lofted to Troy Brown was perfect--and it allowed the Patriots
to continue a clock-eating drive.</TE>
<TE>   "He came in cold and led us to our only offensive touchdown there
in the second quarter and really played pretty much error-free
football the rest of the day," Belichick said. "And that's what we
needed. You've got to give him a lot of credit. It was a terrific
performance under pressure."</TE>
<TE>   He got a rude welcome back on his second play, when he scrambled
for four yards before a big Chad Scott hit sent him out of bounds. It
was similar to the violent but legal hit in the second game of the
season that sent Bledsoe to the hospital ... and left him on the
bench for the last 15 games.</TE>
<TE>   Who starts next? Brady actually had a higher rating than Bledsoe
on Sunday (84.3 to 77.9). Some coaches have a rule that a player
can't lose his job because of injury. Belichick didn't apply that to
Bledsoe during the season, so he should use his same standard: go
with the guy who's doing well at the moment. Bledsoe.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously this is the biggest game there is, and everybody wants
to play in this game," Bledsoe said.</TE>
<TE>   Bledsoe said the hardest part about this season was not playing.
He has mentally prepared for his return to action, whenever it came.
But he couldn't have thought his sweetest play of the year would be
dropping to a knee for a one-yard loss--the play took the final
seconds off the clock and sent the Patriots to the Super Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   "To have that happen and to be kneeling the ball at the end of the
game, that's just a little overwhelming," Bledsoe said.</TE>
<TE>   Not as overwhelming as the media crush on this story during Super
Bowl week.</TE>

<DH>AFC: Bledsoe replaces injured Brady and leads Patriots to
24-17 upset of Steelers and a trip to the Super Bowl.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>J.A. ADANDE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>PITTSBURGH</DL>
<LD>After multiple reviews--not to mention numerous penalties, big-time
special teams plays and some serious quarterback drama--the New
England Patriots are still standing.</LD>
<LD>   They're headed to the Super Bowl after beating the Pittsburgh
Steelers, 24-17, in the AFC championship game Sunday at Heinz Field.</LD>
<LD>   In a contentious game that featured five replay reviews and a
lengthy argument about hash-mark placement, the Patriots won the
tough physical battle at the line of scrimmage.</LD>
<TE>   They held the Steelers, the NFL's top running team, to 58 yards
rushing.</TE>
<TE>   For the record, three of the five reviewed plays went in
Pittsburgh's favor, one week after a highly controversial replay call
helped New England beat the Oakland Raiders.</TE>
<TE>   And the Patriots beat the heavily-favored Steelers even though
they were penalized 12 times for 87 yards.</TE>
<TE>   They won even though they scored one offensive touchdown.</TE>
<TE>   But that touchdown pass was thrown by Drew Bledsoe, which was a
whole story in itself. He hadn't played since he suffered a chest
injury and internal bleeding in the second game of the season.</TE>
<TE>   But when his replacement and New England's biggest hero for the
last four months, Tom Brady, left in the second quarter because of an
ankle injury, Bledsoe got his chance for redemption. He stepped in
and finished off the drive with an 11-yard pass to David Patten.</TE>
<TE>   Will Bledsoe get a chance to redeem himself for his
four-interception game in New England's 35-21 loss to the Green Bay
Packers in Super Bowl XXXI? Patriot Coach Bill Belichick would not
commit to a Super Bowl starter.</TE>
<TE>   At least he gets to make a choice. There are no decisions left for
Steeler Coach Bill Cowher, who has lost three of the four times his
Steelers have hosted a conference championship game.</TE>
<TE>   "The further you go, the greater the disappointment and the harder
it hurts," Cowher said.</TE>
<TE>   The performance of almost every Pittsburgh player on offense could
be called disappointing. Quarterback Kordell Stewart's throws were
off most of the day. He completed 24 of 42 passes for 255 yards and
had three passes intercepted. His final two picks came on
Pittsburgh's last two drives, when a touchdown and extra point would
have tied the score.</TE>
<TE>   Running back Jerome Bettis, playing for the first time in nearly
two months, gained eight yards in nine carries. He said his injured
leg had nothing to do with his performance.</TE>
<TE>   "There was just nowhere to run," Bettis said. "The leg was 100%,
but you can be 110% and you won't have success if there's nowhere to
run."</TE>
<TE>   That's a credit to New England's defensive front and Belichick's
schemes.</TE>
<TE>   Defensive end Willie McGinest, from USC, had a big day with six
tackles (including a sack) and a pass deflection. Defensive backs Ty
Law, Otis Smith and Lawyer Milloy also kept the Pittsburgh receiving
corps in check.</TE>
<TE>   New England's Troy Brown returned a punt 55 yards in the first
quarter for New England's first touchdown.</TE>
<TE>   Afterward, Cowher argued that, before the punt, the ball should
have been put on the left hash mark instead of the right, and he said
later that the placement prevented punter Josh Miller from kicking
out of bounds.</TE>
<TE>   New England led, 7-3, and was driving in the second quarter when
Steeler safety Lee Flowers hit Brady below the knees from behind
after Brady passed to Brown. Brady's knees buckled and he bent over
backward, rolling on a left ankle he already had hurt. Then he went
off, limping first toward the sideline, then to the locker room.</TE>
<TE>   In came Bledsoe, playing for the first time since Sept. 23.</TE>
<TE>   He connected with Patten for 15 yards, ran for four yards, passed
to Patten for 11 yards, then found him in the back of the end zone to
put the Patriots ahead, 14-3.</TE>
<TE>   The pivotal play in the game came on a 34-yard field goal attempt
by Pittsburgh's Kris Brown in the third quarter. Brandon Mitchell
blocked the kick. Troy Brown tracked down the ball and ran 11 yards.
As Kris Brown was trying to tackle him, Troy Brown lateraled to
Antwan Harris, who went the remaining 49 yards for a touchdown and a
21-3 lead.</TE>
<TE>   Stewart finally locked in on Pittsburgh's next drive, as the
Steelers moved 79 yards, helped by two Patriot penalties. Bettis took
the ball the final yard for the score.</TE>
<TE>   A short punt and a 28-yard return meant Pittsburgh only had to go
32 yards on its next touchdown drive, capped by an 11-yard run by
Amos Zereoue.</TE>
<TE>   Pittsburgh had pulled to within four, but New England went back
ahead by seven on a 44-yard Adam Vinatieri field goal.</TE>
<TE>   From there it was a matter of holding on. Now it's about heading
to the Big Easy.</TE>
<TE>   They'll be underdogs to the St. Louis Rams in New Orleans. The
Patriots will say they don't care what people say about them, but
then they'll take note of every perceived slight. Safest bet this
week.</TE>
<TE>   "The spread was the same for us [Sunday] as when Pittsburgh played
1-12 Detroit a few weeks ago," Belichick said. "But really, we don't
care about that. Our job's to play football."</TE>

<TE>   It's Curtains for Steelers</TE>
<TE>   THE BLAME GAME</TE>
<TE>   The Pittsburgh Steelers' inability to run the ball against the
Patriots left the offense in Kordell Stewart's hands. Stewart
responded to the challenge with two costly interceptions in the
fourth quarter. A look at the Steeler offense during the regular
season (with NFL ranking) and against the Patriots:</TE>

<LD>Jerome Bettis waited eight weeks for this?</LD>
<LD>   The Steelers' Pro Bowl running back, playing for the first time
since Dec. 2 because of a groin injury, gained only eight yards in
nine carries in Pittsburgh's 24-17 loss Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   Bettis was confident all week he could quickly get back into game
shape.</LD>
<TE>   But he never got going and, clearly ineffective, was idled for
part of the second and third quarters as Amos Zereoue replaced him.</TE>
<TE>   It isn't like Bettis hasn't been here before.</TE>
<TE>   In the 1996 season, he tried to play against New England in the
playoffs despite a groin injury, but was held to 43 yards as the
Steelers lost, 28-3. The Patriots also went on to the Super Bowl that
season.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Steeler kicker Kris Brown made a 30-yard field goal, but wrapped
up an awful season by having a 34-yard field goal blocked by Brandon
Mitchell and returned for the game's key touchdown.</TE>
<TE>   Brown missed a league-high 14 field goals during the season, then
had another miss last week against Baltimore.</TE>
<TE>   Of the block, Brown said, "The most dreaded sound a kicker hears
is that thud. I tried to tackle the guy who returned it, but he
lateraled it and they scored a touchdown.</TE>
<TE>   "Nothing more needs to be said."</TE>

<DH>Hockey: NHL's showcase event will boost local economy as it
comes to Staples Center, but getting seat won't be easy.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JERRY CROWE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's not only the Southland business community that benefits when the
52nd NHL All-Star game comes to Staples Center Saturday, pumping more
than $10 million into the local economy.</LD>
<LD>   Although the Kings actually end up losing money by hosting the
event, it gives the team another chance to show off Staples Center,
the undisputed jewel in their crown, and offers an opportunity to
dispel the notion that Los Angeles is a second-tier hockey market.</LD>
<LD>   "We're extremely happy to have the NHL All-Star game here, said
Tim Leiweke, president of the Kings and Staples Center.</LD>
<TE>   The game comes at an opportune time for the city, following the
college football national title game at the Rose Bowl, the U.S.
Figure Skating Championships and leading up to next month's Grammys
at Staples, said Kathy Schloessman, president of the L.A. Sports and
Entertainment Commission. Tourism in Los Angeles has taken a steep
decline since the Sept. 11 attacks, down about 15% from the previous
year.</TE>
<TE>   "It's so important right now," Schloessman said of the events
being brought to the city. "We're the hardest hit we've ever been. An
event like this is giving people a reason to get on planes.... It's
almost an impetus, a jump-start."</TE>
<TE>   Leiweke has already bid to bring the NBA All-Star game in 2004. He
is undaunted by the "public relations nightmare" currently playing
out in Philadelphia, host of Feb. 10 NBA All-Star game.</TE>
<TE>   Ed Snider, the Philadelphia 76er chairman, said the 76ers were
allotted only 3,000 All-Star tickets to divvy up among 16,000
season-seat holders, with the rest of the seats going to sponsors and
other guests handpicked by the league.</TE>
<TE>   "If I could give the game back, I would," Snider said. "I can tell
you this for sure: We will never apply for another."</TE>
<TE>   By happy coincidence, the Kings were able to offer all of their
season-ticket holders--and even those who purchased only half-season
plans--the opportunity to shell out $185 to $350 to buy tickets for
Saturday's game.</TE>
<TE>   The Kings' season-ticket base of about 11,000 equaled the club's
allotment of All-Star game tickets, a sign that the clamor for
All-Star game tickets among the NHL's sponsors and other affiliates
falls short of the demand among the NBA's business partners.</TE>
<TE>   Not everyone is pleased with ticket availability, however.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the King season-ticket holders, for example, were not
offered the same seats they'll sit in for 41 King games this
season--only those who opened their accounts before 1985 are entitled
to sit in the lower bowl.</TE>
<TE>   And fans who buy tickets to watch the Kings on a game-by-game
basis were shut out of Saturday's game altogether.</TE>
<TE>   "The thing that bothers me the most is that they're not even
giving the general public the opportunity to buy tickets," said
Gerald Trudeau, a 42-year-old letter carrier from Fontana who said he
attends about five games a year and has supported the Kings since
they joined the NHL before the 1967-68 season.</TE>
<TE>   In 1981, when the All-Star game was played at the Forum, Trudeau
said he was able to buy tickets for seats less than 20 rows from the
ice. "Now," he said, "you have to spend thousands of dollars on
season seats or go through a broker [to get tickets for the All-Star
game]."</TE>
<TE>   But it could be worse.</TE>
<TE>   Two years ago in hockey-mad Toronto, where the Maple Leafs fill up
all but a small portion of Air Canada Centre with season-seat
subscribers, All-Star tickets were available only to those who had
opened their accounts before 1960.</TE>
<TE>   Last year in Denver, the Colorado Avalanche offered only two
tickets to each of their season-seat account holders, no matter the
number of season seats purchased.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm very happy with how it's turned out for us," said Kurt
Schwartzkopf, vice president of sales and marketing for the Kings.
"We obviously wanted to take care of everybody, but we don't have
50,000 seats, so we know we can't. We just do the best we can with
the allocation we're given."</TE>
<TE>   The NHL took about 8,000 seats for Saturday's game, most in the
lower bowl, to distribute among its sponsors, licensees, retail
partners, broadcasters, teams, players and their guests, media and
other special guests, said Frank Supovitz, group vice president of
events and entertainment for the league.</TE>
<TE>   "The math worked out here completely coincidentally," Supovitz
said of the Kings' ability to offer all of its season-ticket holders
access to the game.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Supovitz said: "We're cognizant of the fact that this is an
event that can't accommodate every fan that wants to get into the
building. But the number of tickets we do have available for
season-ticket holders and the like is significant enough to where the
number of disappointments is greatly reduced. Where the
disappointment is frequently voiced is among fans who are not
season-ticket holders."</TE>
<TE>   Such complaints aside, Supovitz said it's easy to see why eight
NHL teams submitted bids to be host of the All-Star game in 2004,
2005 and 2006. The Florida Panthers will play host to next year's
game at Sunrise, Fla.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it benefits anybody who's touched by it," the NHL
executive said. "It's beneficial to the team that wants to position
itself in front of its fans as well as other teams as a major player
in the league. It's a good payback for season-ticket holders, who
have the ability to buy tickets to attend the game.</TE>
<TE>   "It's certainly prestigious for the league to go to a city like
L.A. and sell out the game and capture the hearts and minds of not
only existing fans but also casual fans and maybe just passersby who
know we're in town.</TE>
<TE>   "It positions us as the major league sport that we are. And it
benefits the local economy through the guests that come from out of
town."</TE>
<TE>   The game and the activities surrounding it, among them the
All-Star skills competition Friday night and the NHL FANtasy running
Wednesday through Saturday at the Convention Center, are projected to
generate 8,200 hotel-room nights. Organizers hope NHL FANtasy,
featuring interactive games and other activities designed to promote
the sport, will draw more than 80,000 visitors, mostly Southland
residents.</TE>
<TE>   "NHL and NBA all-star games bring with them lots of corporate
sponsors," said Schloessman, "and that translates into money, parties
at hotels, parties all over the city. For us, it's all about the
spending."</TE>
<TE>   For the Los Angeles Convention and Visitors Bureau, it's all about
that most priceless of Southern California commodities: Exposure. In
addition to more than 500 domestic and international media outlets
expected to be represented Saturday, the game will be seen in more
than 150 countries worldwide.</TE>
<TE>   "It brings in the press [and] they don't just cover the game,"
Schloessman said. "They talk about the city. It makes people want to
come here if you consistently have events and are being talked
about.... That's basically free advertising."</TE>
<TE>   As part of the bid to bring the All-Star game to Los Angeles, the
Kings agreed to underwrite league costs, about $200,000 to cover
transportation and hotel rooms, and to be host of a variety of
parties and VIP receptions.</TE>
<TE>   "It costs you money," Leiweke said. "But from a building
standpoint it's good for our image, and I think it builds a stronger
reputation for the Kings. I think this is a good step in continuing
to increase the respect that the rest of the league and the hockey
world holds for the L.A. franchise and the L.A. marketplace ....</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's good for us to get all of the owners and the players
and, in particular, all the writers from all over the NHL to come in
and understand that we do like hockey out here."</TE>

<HD>Gipson Has Verbum Dei Running Well</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BEN BOLCH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Verbum Dei guard Richard Chaney wasn't exactly thrilled earlier this
season when former Eagle assistant coach Ronnie Gipson took over the
program.</LD>
<LD>   Chaney didn't have anything against Gipson; he just hated all the
running.</LD>
<LD>   "He's a very strict coach as far as conditioning," Chaney said
after scoring 25 points Monday in a 71-63 victory over Downey Calvary
Chapel. "At first, I didn't agree with that. But at times like this,
I really thank him for that.</LD>
<TE>   "If it wasn't for the conditioning, we probably would have lost
because of fatigue."</TE>
<TE>   Gipson's Eagles (19-3), No. 11 in The Times' rankings, are in such
good shape that they followed their afternoon victory over Calvary
Chapel with an evening rout of San Pedro Mary Star of the Sea. The
team appears back to the form that helped it win consecutive state
Division IV titles in 1998 and '99 under David Greenwood.</TE>
<TE>   Greenwood left after the '99 season to work with daughter Tiffany,
an All-Southern Section basketball player at La Puente Bishop Amat.
He indicated a desire in September to return as Eagle coach to
replace the departed Casey Curry but decided to work with Tiffany for
her senior season.</TE>
<TE>   Greenwood helps run drills at Verbum Dei practices but has made it
clear that Gipson is in charge.</TE>
<TE>   "He's doing a wonderful job," said Greenwood, an All-American at
Verbum Dei and UCLA in the 1970s. "Our goal is to get the program
back to where it's supposed to be. We feel that we should either be
in the finals or winning the championship every year."</TE>
<TE>   Gipson, a Verbum Dei alumnus who was an assistant under Greenwood
during the state championship seasons, said his former mentor has
prepared him well.</TE>
<TE>   "I knew if I could get the boys to play the way we played two
years ago, everything would be OK," Gipson said.</TE>
<TE>   "The players have definitely responded positively to us because
they were looking for leadership and direction and discipline. We've
come in from Day 1 and told them we were going to give them
discipline, because that's the only way you can win as a basketball
team."</TE>
<TE>   What a rivalry: Hemet and Perris met Friday for the 103rd time in
a series that dates to the early 1900s.</TE>
<TE>   Perris won, 64-61, to extend its series win streak to 29 games.
But Hemet still leads the series, 57-46. Hemet Coach Alex Boyd has
his young team poised to break the current streak in the next couple
of years. In Friday's game, the Bulldogs had three sophomores and a
junior in the starting lineup.</TE>
<TE>   "We're just not a basketball school," said Boyd, who has been at
Hemet for nine seasons. "But we're getting there slowly."</TE>

<LD>William Gildea of the Washington Post, writing on the lonely life of
an NFL punter: "Not only does a punter lack the renown that can come
from playing celebrated positions like quarterback and middle
linebacker, he works from adversity: Opponents can mount a ferocious
charge against him, opponents' fans try to incite his own demise,
even his own team's fans don't like to see him come into the game
because they are about to give up the ball.</LD>
<LD>   "The punter is the team's repairman. You hate needing him, but may

<TE>   Trivia time: Which NBA team holds the record for the best
single-season winning percentage on the road?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Part of the landscape: Rick Telander of the Chicago Sun-Times,
commenting on the Winter Olympics: "Salt Lake City has been preparing
for this event, it seems, since about the time Brigham Young walked
with his flock over the Wasatch Mountains, saw the seagulls in the
valley below and said: 'Behold the future home of John Stockton and
the Mailman.'"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   More Telander: "When I watch Mike Tyson, I often am reminded of
actor Richard Pryor's frantic words to an interviewer after he and
Gene Wilder shot a prison film amid real prisoners in a real joint:
'Thank God for penitentiaries.'"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   DQ action: An English bookmaker has taken more bets on Tyson being
disqualified if he fights Lennox Lewis than for either heavyweight to
win the fight.</TE>
<TE>   Bookmaker William Hill cut the odds on a Tyson disqualification
from 6-1 to 4-1. Hill has Lewis at 4-9 to win and Tyson at 13-8.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Firing bonus: A week after being fired by the Buccaneers, Tony
Dungy was named coach of the Colts, who will pay him about $1 million
more a year than he made with Tampa Bay. He also inherits an offense
led by Peyton Manning, Edgerrin James and Marvin Harrison.</TE>
<TE>   "If this were a divorce," said David Whitley of the Orlando
Sentinel, "it was like being kicked out of the house by Leona
Helmsley and having Jennifer Connelly pull up in a Ferrari and ask
whether you want to go for a ride."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Dull dilemma: Thomas Johansson lamented that tennis in his native
Sweden has faded in popularity, partly because the sport thrives on
flamboyant personalities.</TE>
<TE>   "Look at me, I'm not that interesting," Johansson said. "If you
color your hair red and you act a little bit different, then you're
interesting."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A slam dunk: Jon Gruden's agent, Bob LaMonte, commenting on his
client: "If there's a zero-percent chance of Jon Gruden signing with
the Raiders, it doesn't take John Nash [subject of "A Beautiful
Mind"] to figure out the probability."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Looking back: On this day in 1996, the Dallas Cowboys defeated the
Pittsburgh Steelers, 27-17, in Super Bowl XXX in Tempe, Ariz.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: The 1971-72 Lakers, .816 ( 31-7).</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   And finally: Former NBA coach Alex Hannum, who died recently at
the age of 78, also was the first coach of the Oakland Oaks in the
American Basketball Assn.</TE>
<TE>   He said of the ABA's red, white and blue ball: "The only place for
that thing is on the end of a seal's nose."</TE>

<DL>MEMPHIS, Tenn.</DL>
<LD>The Clippers traveled east and tried gamely to put their 21-point
loss Saturday against the Dallas Mavericks behind them with a light
workout Sunday night at Rhodes College.</LD>
<LD>   The Clippers get another crack at the Mavericks on Tuesday at
Dallas. First, though, they find themselves in the unusual position
of being the stronger team while on the road. Tonight, they play the
Memphis Grizzlies, losers of seven in a row, in the first game of a
season-high seven-game trip.</LD>
<LD>   "They've beaten the Lakers," Coach Alvin Gentry said, when asked
how tough the Grizzlies are at home. "They're good enough to have
played everyone close down to the wire. They have had some good wins
here. If we don't play at a high level, we won't beat this team."</LD>
<TE>   The Clippers are 3-14 on the road.</TE>
<TE>   "At some point, we're going to have to start winning some games on
the road," Gentry said. "We have to play with confidence. When we
play with confidence, we are a good team."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Guard Keyon Dooling continues to make strides in his comeback from
a badly sprained left ankle. He hopes it won't be long before he's
participating at full strength. At present, he says he's running at
only about 70%.</TE>
<TE>   "It feels pretty good today," said Dooling, injured Nov. 14
against the Chicago Bulls. "I can shoot. I can plant my foot. I can
do pretty much everything, except with speed. I have a hard time
starting and stopping."</TE>
<TE>   TONIGHT</TE>
<TE>   at Memphis, 5 PST</TE>
<TE>   Site--The Pyramid.</TE>
<TE>   Radio--KXTA (1150).</TE>
<TE>   Records--Clippers 22-22, Grizzlies 12-31.</TE>
<TE>   Record vs. Grizzlies--1-0.</TE>
<TE>   Update--The Clippers were 5-7 on the road against the Grizzlies
when they called Vancouver their home. This is the Clippers' first
game in Memphis since the Grizzlies relocated during the off-season.
The Clippers won the first game between the teams this season at
Staples Center, 108-92. Pau Gasol, a 7-foot rookie forward, is
averaging 17.2 points and 8.7 rebounds. He had 26 points in the
Grizzlies' loss Saturday against the Bulls. Reserve guard Quentin
Richardson had a career-best 31 points, tying the team record with
seven three-point baskets, in the Clippers' loss to Dallas.</TE>

merchandise. Ground rules: If it can be read, played, heard,

<LD>   What: "Real Sports With Bryant Gumbel"</LD>
<LD>   Where: HBO, tonight, 10.</LD>
<TE>   Too bad radio legend Jim Healy isn't still around to see this
show. One of his favorite tapes was of Ed Garvey, former head of the
NFL players' union, saying, "Leonard Tose has lost it." Well, Tose
has lost it all right, as shown in this edition of "Real Sports."</TE>
<TE>   Tose, who bought the Philadelphia Eagles for $16 million in 1969,
was forced to sell the team in 1985 for $65 million to cover his
gambling losses. Now 86, he is penniless, lives in a small hotel
room, and former Eagle coach Dick Vermeil pays his day-to-day
expenses.</TE>
<TE>   Vermeil, interviewed by "Real Sports," says, "The worst thing that
happened [to Leonard] is Atlantic City, really. ... It became a
passion with him, an obsession."</TE>
<TE>   Tose is a fascinating story. Besides Vermeil, others who provide
some insight for "Real Sports" are former Eagle general manager Jim
Murray, Tose's driver John Finch, who now takes care of him, and
Tose's daughter Susan Spencer, who helped her father run the Eagles.</TE>
<TE>   "Real Sports" obtained records from the Sands casino that show
Tose lost nearly $10 million there in 1981 and another $10 million in
'82.</TE>
<TE>   Correspondent Frank Deford asks Tose why he gambled. "It
fascinated me, I guess," says Tose, who admits he was no good at it.</TE>
<TE>   At the end of the piece, Deford asks Tose if there are regrets.
"Oh, I guess if I sat down and analyzed it there would be a lot of
them," Tose says. "So why waste my time?"</TE>
<TE>   After Tose says he would not go back to Atlantic City, Deford
says, "You wouldn't? If I gave you a million dollars right now, would
you go gambling?"</TE>
<TE>   Tose, smiling, says, "Would you give me two?"</TE>
<TE>   The lead segment on this edition of "Real Sports" looks at
gambling in Las Vegas and betting lines. There's also a segment about
the role religion plays in sports, particularly in the NFL, and
another is about a successful Pop Warner League football program in
the Marshall Heights section of Washington, D.C.</TE>

<HD>This Line Has Been Worth Repeating</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There haven't been many good things for the Mighty Ducks to point to
this season, but the line combination of Denny Lambert, Marc
Chouinard and Dan Bylsma has been one of them.</LD>
<LD>   That trio struck again Saturday in a 3-1 victory over Nashville.
Lambert drove to the net and collided with Bylsma and the two went
down. Bylsma pushed the puck out to his right, swung his stick along
the ice and ... presto ... the Ducks had the tying goal.</LD>
<LD>   It was the seventh goal this season for Bylsma. His previous best
was three.</LD>
<TE>   The previous night in a 6-1 victory over Dallas, Chouinard picked
up a loose puck in the neutral zone, pushed forward and fired a shot
in for his fourth goal.</TE>
<TE>   Even on nights when they don't score goals, they usually have
solid shifts from start to finish. Bylsma and Chouinard are also two
of the team's best penalty killers.</TE>
<TE>   "They are courageous people," Coach Bryan Murray said. "They jump
on you and hit and they get bumped around and punched in the face and
they keep playing the same way."</TE>
<TE>   And score big goals.</TE>
<TE>   Twice this season that line has provided the key goals in
victories over Phoenix. Bylsma and Chouinard scored in a 3-2 overtime
victory Oct. 24. Lambert scored his only goal and Chouinard added a
second--with Bylsma assisting on both goals--in a 4-0 victory Dec.
23.</TE>
<TE>   "We've been talking a lot about getting the puck to the net and
banging home rebounds and banging home scrambles," Bylsma said "I
don't think it's any secret for the three of us as a line, that's
where success is going to be."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks' top line has had more success since Mike Leclerc was
inserted on the left wing with Andy McDonald and Paul Kariya.</TE>
<TE>   Leclerc set up Kariya for a goal against Dallas. Kariya returned
the favor against Nashville, as he raced from the Duck zone down the
right and waited ... and waited ... and waited before slipping a
backhand pass to Leclerc, who had an open net to shoot at.</TE>

<LD>A recap of the news while wondering how many beignets will be
consumed at this week's Super Bowl in New Orleans and how many
writers will swallow hard and vote Texas Tech into this week's
Associated Press top 25 basketball poll.</LD>
<LD>   News item: New England and St. Louis to meet in this weekend's
Super Bowl.</LD>
<LD>   Second thought: I never once doubted the Patriots after their 1-3
start. OK, maybe once.</LD>
<TE>   News item: Pat Summerall's sparse, understated broadcast delivery
will be missed on Fox broadcasting team.</TE>
<TE>   Second thought: Yep. I'll say. Touchdown. Rams.</TE>
<TE>   News item: Vernon Forrest hands Shane Mosley his first
professional boxing defeat.</TE>
<TE>   Second thought: Mosley should have known better than to schedule
Forrest in an Olympic year. I'm not sure Mosley would win twice if he
fought Forrest 10 times, but it was refreshing to watch a boxing
promotion in which neither combatant later felt compelled to grab his
crotch, flash a gang sign or demand a tetanus shot.</TE>
<TE>   News item: Texas Tech defeats No. 6 Oklahoma to improve record to
15-3.</TE>
<TE>   Second thought: No one said Bob Knight couldn't coach, but that
doesn't mean we'd want him in charge of adjusting neckties at the
postseason awards banquet.</TE>
<TE>   News item: USC basketball team rebounds from overtime loss to
California to upset Stanford.</TE>
<TE>   Second thought: The Trojans are a reflection of their coach: They
never seem to blink.</TE>
<TE>   News item: Nation recently celebrates Martin Luther King Day.</TE>
<TE>   Second thought: I have a dream, and it goes like this: Mike
Montgomery has coached UCLA basketball for the last five years and
Steve Lavin has been at Stanford. In the dream, UCLA wins its fifth
consecutive game at Maples Pavilion, and afterward UCLA player Matt
Barnes says, "This feels like my house."</TE>
<TE>   News item: Stephen King's story "Rose Red" made into television
movie.</TE>
<TE>   Second thought: I'm not actually watching this horror miniseries,
but someone said it was an adaptation based on Nebraska's recent bowl
trip.</TE>
<TE>   News item: ABC quiz show "The Chair" remains on the air.</TE>
<TE>   Second thought: I've had this quiz show/medical journal idea
rattling around in my brain for weeks. It's called "Magnetic
Resonance Imaging," MRI for short. Premise: The host, former Raider
center Jim Otto, loads himself into the MRI tube and contestants are
given 60 seconds to identify how many ligament tears the oft-injured
Otto suffered during his career, all while answering rapid-fire
"Silver and Black" trivia questions provided by Al Davis.</TE>
<TE>   News item: Ron Zook takes over as University of Florida football
coach.</TE>
<TE>   Second thought: Show of hands from those who thought the honeymoon
would last at least until spring ball.</TE>
<TE>   No one said replacing Steve Spurrier would be a snap, but Zook
probably deserves to coach a game or two before getting run out of
Gainesville. That said, a former Gator student has already
established an Internet site called Fireronzook.com, on which he
estimates the number of days until Zook will be canned (1,055 as of
today). The home page features a scroll of recruits the Gators have
reportedly lost since Zook was named Spurrier's successor and quotes
former Tampa Bay coach Tony Dungy saying: "I don't know John Zook
that well, but I think he's going to do a great job." The guy running
the Web site remains anonymous, explaining he "knows that most Gator
fans own shotguns."</TE>
<TE>   News item: Show called "World's Sexiest Athletes" debuts on ESPN.</TE>
<TE>   Second thought: Look for William Perry, Craig Stadler, all five of
the former Washington Redskin "Hogs" and comedian Carrot Top to file
a discrimination lawsuit.</TE>
<TE>   News item: Mike Tyson and Lennox Lewis exchange blows at news
conference.</TE>
<TE>   Second thought: This comes in the aftermath of the Oscar De La
Hoya-Fernando Vargas prefight scrape. HBO needs to scrap its current
boxing format and start a show called "Press Conferences After Dark."</TE>
<TE>   News item: Tyson issues apology for latest fracas, stating: "I am
not a role model or Mr. Politically Correct."</TE>
<TE>   Second thought: Tyson's confession stuns thousands of PTA
presidents and youth ministers who, for years, have held the former
heavyweight champion to a higher moral and ethical standard.</TE>
<TE>   News item: Houston Astros say Enron is still making payments on
the 30-year, $100-million naming-rights deal the company signed.</TE>
<TE>   Second thought: Reportedly, the stadium signage will remain at
least until August. To protest, fans ought to keep a running tally of
pitcher strikeouts this season by draping (401)K banners over the
railing.</TE>
<TE>   News item: Mighty Ducks reportedly ready to offer 10 players for
trade.</TE>
<TE>   Second thought: Some are calling this the most coldhearted move at
Disney since five of the Seven Dwarfs were left exposed in last
year's storybook character expansion draft.</TE>
<TE>   News item: U.S. skier Picabo Street may not be able to defend her
Olympic gold medal in super-giant slalom.</TE>
<TE>   Second thought: Where is that Olympic sponsor's exemption when you
need it? Street did not accumulate enough points to automatically
qualify for the super-G--she will ski in the Olympic downhill--yet
she ought to be able to defend her title the way the Masters'
champion in golf gets a lifetime exemption.</TE>
<TE>   There is still a slight chance U.S. coaches, in a discretionary
decision, could jump Street over two Americans who have qualified for
the super-G when the ski team is announced today.</TE>
<TE>   News item: Speedskater Apolo Ohno accused of rigging a qualifying
race to help a friend make the Olympic squad.</TE>
<TE>   Second thought: You could argue Ohno was only trying to exemplify
the spirit of the Salt Lake Games, which were rigged from Day 1.</TE>
<TE>   News item: License granted to start accepting horse racing bets
via Internet and over phone.</TE>
<TE>   Second thought: Terrific. Now, those yahoos who gratuitously use
their cell phones in public places--Honey, guess where I am now? On a
plane!--now get to legally keep us informed about their sporting
addictions.</TE>

<LD>New England (13-5) vs. St. Louis (16-2)</LD>
<LD>   How they got here: While most expected the Rams to challenge for a
Super Bowl berth, few--if any--thought the Patriots would even make
the playoffs. In the playoffs, the Rams forced eight turnovers to
rout the Packers, 45-17, then outlasted the Eagles, 29-24. Aided by a
controversial call, the Patriots downed the Raiders, 16-13, in
overtime, then took advantage of two special-teams touchdowns to beat
the heavily favored Steelers, 24-17. Both teams had first-round byes.</LD>
<LD>   Last meeting: Nov. 18, 2001. Kurt Warner completed 30 of 42 passes
for 401 yards and three touchdowns in the Rams' 24-17 victory. The
Patriots' only offensive touchdown came on Tom Brady's 10-yard pass
play to David Patten with 7:46 left in the game, but they never got
the ball back as the Rams held it for the remaining 14 plays.</LD>
<TE>   Common opponents: Miami, New York Jets, New Orleans, Carolina,
Atlanta and Indianapolis. New England was 7-2 against these teams,
with losses coming against Miami and the New York Jets. St. Louis was
8-1, with the loss coming against New Orleans. The Rams outscored
those opponents, 335-161, the Patriots, 218-132.</TE>
<TE>   About the Patriots: New England's season was right out of a
Hollywood script. The drama began in August with the death of
quarterbacks coach Dick Rehbein. An 0-2 start had many doubting that
Coach Bill Belichick would be around at season's end. While wide
receiver Terry Glenn's personal problems became a season-long
distraction, his absence opened the door for Troy Brown, who
responded with a team-record 101 catches. In the second game of the
season, quarterback Drew Bledsoe was sidelined after getting hit so
hard by the Jets' Mo Lewis that he bled internally. In stepped
untested Tom Brady who along with Buffalo running back castoff
Antowain Smith, led the Patriots to an 11-5 record and the AFC East
title. Belichick also added six free agents to a defense that ranked
20th in the NFL in 2000 and came up with a "bend-but-don't-break"
unit that gave up only five touchdowns in a regular season-ending
six-game win streak.</TE>
<TE>   About the Rams: The Rams played their "Greatest Show on Earth"
nickname to the hilt, rolling through the regular season with the
NFL's No. 1-ranked offense to a 14-2 record--with the losses coming
by a combined 10 points. League MVP Kurt Warner threw for 4,830 yards
and 36 touchdowns, running back Marshall Faulk had 2,147 total yards
and 21 touchdowns and wide receivers Torry Holt and Isaac Bruce
combined for 145 catches for 2,469 yards and 13 touchdowns. After a
lackluster defensive effort cost the Rams in the 2000 playoffs, new
defensive coordinator Lovie Smith rebuilt the unit with eight new
starters--the most notable being all-pro cornerback Aeneas Williams.
The Ram defense went from a No. 24 ranking to No. 4.</TE>

<LD>Another record crowd at the Phoenix Open got the exciting finish it
wanted. Chris DiMarco would have rather put it to sleep.</LD>
<LD>   Especially the rowdy fan at No. 16.</LD>
<LD>   DiMarco, who showed up the fan by making a birdie, used plenty of
grit Sunday to recover from a stunning collapse for a one-stroke
victory over hard-luck Kenny Perry and Japan's Kaname Yokoo at the
TPC of Scottsdale, Ariz.</LD>
<TE>   DiMarco got back in the game with an eight-iron from 171 yards
that stopped about 18 inches from cup on the par-three 16th.</TE>
<TE>   That's when a fan yelled "Noonan!" as DiMarco stood over the putt.</TE>
<TE>   That's a line in the movie "Caddy- shack," when everyone is
shouting at Danny Noonan as he tries to make a 12-foot putt to win
the caddie tournament.</TE>
<TE>   "It gave me a little incentive to make the putt," DiMarco said.</TE>
<TE>   Perry three-putted from 30 feet for a bogey on No. 17 to fall one
stroke behind.</TE>
<TE>   It finally ended with DiMarco two-putting from about 50 feet on
No. 18 and Perry's birdie putt burning the right edge of the cup.</TE>
<TE>   DiMarco closed with a two-under 69 and finished at 267.</TE>
<TE>   Perry had a 70 and Yokoo had a seven-under 64.</TE>
<TE>   DiMarco led by four strokes after 10 holes before going double
bogey, bogey, bogey.</TE>

<TE>   U.S. Open champion Retief Goosen of South Africa cruised in the
Johnnie Walker Classic at Perth, Australia, despite struggling with a
one-over 73 in the final round.</TE>
<TE>   Goosen finished at 14-under 274. Pierre Fulke of Sweden finished
second at 282, followed by Sergio Garcia of Spain (283) and Ernie Els
of South Africa (286).</TE>

Championship winner--17 years later.</TE>

<HD>Snow Ridge Absolutely Dazzles</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL CHRISTINE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When trainer Wayne Lukas blew out Snow Ridge through the stretch one
morning last week at Santa Anita, several rival horsemen were
impressed by the 4-year-old's speed.</LD>
<LD>   "That's a First Down Dash colt," Lukas said, tongue in cheek. "I'm
getting him ready to run him [against quarter horses] at Los
Alamitos."</LD>
<LD>   No one chuckled, Lukas said. He had convinced them that Snow Ridge
indeed was a quarter horse, headed for the barn of Lukas' wife,
Laura, who trains a string for the family at the Orange County track.</LD>
<TE>   The trainers of the six other horses in Sunday's $150,000 Palos
Verdes Handicap would have been better off if Snow Ridge had gone to
Los Alamitos. On a track left sloppy--or wet-fast--by a steady
afternoon of rain, Lukas' colt won the six-furlong stake in 1:073/5,
fastest time for the race since Concept Win's identical clocking in
1994 and two-fifths of a second off the track record of 1:071/5 set
by Sunny Blossom in the 1989 Palos Verdes.</TE>
<TE>   On The Line, who gave Lukas his second--and most recent--Palos
Verdes win in 1988, also ran a blazing 1:073/5.</TE>
<TE>   "Snow Ridge is as fast as any of the fast ones I've had," Lukas
said. "He can go out there in 20 [seconds] and change and still keep
going. I entered him in the [Breeders' Cup Sprint], you know, but he
didn't have a good enough record to get in."</TE>
<TE>   The winner of the Breeders' Cup race, run Oct. 27 at Belmont Park,
was Squirtle Squirt, who ran Sunday for the first time since then and
finished second, beaten by four lengths, as the 4-5 favorite. It was
the first time Squirtle Squirt had run on an off track.</TE>
<TE>   "He ran a good race," jockey Jerry Bailey said. "When it's not a
horse's favorite [surface], they might work a little harder getting
across the ground. These probably weren't the ideal conditions for
his first race back."</TE>
<TE>   David Lanzman, who owns Squirtle Squirt, said the colt will run
next in either the $150,000 San Carlos Stakes on March 3 at Santa
Anita or the $2-million Dubai Golden Shaheen on March 23.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not going to win them all, and I'd just as soon win the
next one," Lanzman said. "I can swallow getting beat today, coming
off a layoff, to a horse that ran this fast. I'm not a believer that
going to Dubai knocks out a horse for the rest of the year."</TE>
<TE>   Ridden by Mike Smith, Snow Ridge led from the start, reeling off
fractions of :21, :431/5 and :551/5. The son of Tabasco Cat, Lukas'
1994 Preakness-Belmont winner, Snow Ridge paid $19 as the fourth
choice, after winning the El Conejo Handicap at 18-1 on Jan. 1. The
Palos Verdes was the eighth win in 17 starts for the colt that
William T. Young's Overbrook Farm bought for $420,000 at a 1999
yearling auction.</TE>
<TE>   Ceeband finished third, a half-length behind Squirtle Squirt and
one length in front of Men's Exclusive, the 9-year-old trying to
repeat as the Palos Verdes winner.</TE>
<TE>   "The track was firm underneath, so maybe the time wasn't
realistic," Lukas said. "I had no idea how he'd like the mud. He and
Mike make good chemistry together."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Lido Palace, winner of last year's Whitney Handicap and Woodward,
is a possible for next Sunday's $250,000 San Antonio Handicap. Bobby
Frankel, who trains Lido Palace, had hoped to run the horse in the
$500,000 Donn Handicap at Gulfstream Park on Feb. 9, but ran into
shipping difficulties.... On Saturday, a field of eight, including
San Fernando winner Western Pride, is probable for the $400,000
Strub.</TE>

<HD>Trepanier Doesn't Get Royal Treatment</HD>

<DL>DENVER</DL>
<LD>Pascal Trepanier of the Colorado Avalanche emerged unscathed from
Saturday's 4-2 victory over the Kings, a surprising development
considering what King Coach Andy Murray had said about him last fall.</LD>
<LD>   After a blindside hit by Trepanier in a Sept. 29 exhibition game
resulted in a concussion for King winger Nelson Emerson, Murray
decried the hit as a "terrible cheap shot."</LD>
<LD>   He vowed that the Kings would "make life miserable" for Trepanier
the next time the teams met, which was Saturday, and said of the
former Duck defenseman: "He'll be sore when he leaves our building,
for sure."</LD>
<TE>   But except for a second-period confrontation with Emerson, which
resulted in a two-minute roughing penalty for Trepanier and a
four-minute roughing double minor for Emerson, Trepanier seemed to be
left alone by the Kings.</TE>
<TE>   His teammates may have forgotten but not Emerson, who was
sidelined for eight games because of the concussion and then, after a
brief return to the lineup, another 14 games because of
post-concussion syndrome.</TE>
<TE>   "I worked hard all summer to get ready for the season and I lost a
big chunk of my season because of that," Emerson said of Trepanier's
hit. "I'm sure he didn't mean to put me out for that long, but it was
pretty frustrating for me."</TE>
<TE>   Emerson seemed reluctant to talk about Saturday's skirmish.</TE>
<TE>   "It's something that happens," he said. "Just NHL craziness."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Murray disputed the notion that he had blown his cool during the
final minute of Saturday's game, when he drew a bench minor for
"abuse of officials" and was ejected, saying that his actions were
calculated.</TE>
<TE>   "I knew what I was doing," he said. "I didn't lose control....</TE>
<TE>   "I was trying to make a statement. I thought our team had played
very hard. I thought we had taken some undisciplined penalties that I
wasn't pleased with, but I also felt that there were some things that
went on in the game [with the officiating] that should not have
happened.</TE>
<TE>   "I felt our team needed to see that I was going to back them up."</TE>
<TE>   Murray also said that he hadn't meant to praise the crowd's
reaction to his ouster, which brought down a rain of water bottles,
soda, beer and other debris onto the ice, but he declined to condemn
it.</TE>
<TE>   "They thought we were getting hosed, and that was their reaction,"
he said. "For me to criticize the fans for being supportive--I don't
think I can do that."</TE>

<DL>PHILADELPHIA</DL>
<LD>Laker assistant Tex Winter was hospitalized for about three hours
Sunday afternoon after having what doctors suspected was an acid
reflux reaction to food.</LD>
<LD>   A Philadelphia 76er team physician subsequently discovered Winter
had an irregular heartbeat, according to a Laker spokesman.</LD>
<LD>   Winter, 79, was released from Methodist Hospital Sunday night and
flew to Washington, where the Lakers are to be honored at the White
House today by President Bush for last season's NBA championship.</LD>
<TE>   "I'm OK," Winter said from the hospital. "I feel fine."</TE>
<TE>   It was Winter's second trip to the hospital in two weeks. His
wife, Nancy, recently took him to the emergency room for a similar
reaction to spicy food. He ate hot sauce after the Lakers' loss to
the 76ers on Sunday afternoon.</TE>
<TE>   Winter no longer travels with the club full time, but is on the
five-game trip because, in part, it includes today's visit to
Washington.</TE>
<TE>   He is expected to have more tests when he returns to Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   About 30 minutes after the game, Laker trainer Gary Vitti was
summoned to the coaches' room, located across a small hallway from
the visitors' locker room, where Winter was in distress. Vitti
treated Winter until doctors arrived.</TE>
<TE>   Winter was alert and sitting up when he was loaded into an
ambulance, and a handful of players and coaches stood by as the doors
closed behind him. Accompanied by owner Jerry Buss' son, Jim, Winter
was taken to the hospital while the rest of the team bused to
Washington.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Sunday's loss, the Lakers' sixth in nine games, meant Phil Jackson
missed by one victory the duty of coaching the Western Conference in
the NBA All-Star game.</TE>
<TE>   Don Nelson, whose Dallas Mavericks won by 21 points against the
Clippers on Saturday in Los Angeles, goes instead.</TE>
<TE>   The game is Feb. 10 in Philadelphia, during a stretch in which the
Lakers play twice in 10 days, both at home.</TE>
<TE>   "You know, what does a coach do in the All-Star game? Monitor the
minutes, send a guy in and send the guys out again," Jackson said
Sunday. "I think baseball does it right [World Series participants
manage the game]. But still it's not this crazy stuff all the way
down to the end. Are you going? Are you not going? You don't know if
you're going. It's the only break you have in the season for four
days, and you can't even make plans to go to Cabo."</TE>
<TE>   Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant, both voted into the starting
lineup, will represent the Lakers at Philadelphia.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal played with a pad and sleeve on his left knee, which was
sore.... Allen Iverson suffered a bruise on his lower left back when
he landed on camera equipment under one basket. He did not play the
final 2:17 of the first half, but returned to play all 24 minutes of
the second.</TE>

<HD>Waking Up Is Hard to Do for These Lakers</HD>
<DH>Pro basketball: Irritated by a call late in game, they fall
to 76ers, 93-87, for their sixth defeat in last nine games.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIM BROWN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>PHILADELPHIA</DL>
<LD>Kobe Bryant stood at the end of six losses in nine games, of 11
losses in seven weeks, of quarter upon quarter of mediocre
basketball, even here, where they celebrated seven months before.</LD>
<LD>   He smiled a little, but not too much, somewhere between "we got
this handled" and "what's going on here," and said, "We just take
this loss, put it in a bag, and go on."</LD>
<LD>   Outraged at a late call they believed beat them Sunday afternoon,
the Lakers are finding it difficult to gather the same sentiment for
the effort that puts them in the predicament. The carpet barely dry
from the champagne they spilled in June, the Lakers dragged
themselves out of bed, lost flatly again, then drove to Washington,
where today they'll be honored at the White House for last season's
title.</LD>
<TE>   Vanquished in the last NBA Finals in what became less than a fair
fight, the Philadelphia 76ers this time won, 93-87, before a sellout
at First Union Center and a national television audience, and now the
Lakers' regular-season bag is getting cumbersome.</TE>
<TE>   Their style would be alarming to them, perhaps, if it were not so
familiar. The Lakers lost unusually often last season too, then
finished by winning 23 of 24 games, the last three in this arena,
shoving the 76ers into a tumultuous summer.</TE>
<TE>   While the 76ers climbed above .500 for the first time in nearly
two months, the Lakers are 29-12, from a start of 16-1.</TE>
<TE>   "That's a team that's struggled all year through health issues and
changes," Laker forward Rick Fox said. "The chemistry search is still
going on. But a win like this, against us, the team that beat them in
the finals last year, I'm sure will lift their spirits."</TE>
<TE>   It is a knack the Lakers have, lifting the spirits of the
downtrodden.</TE>
<TE>   "We're all about the NBA," Fox said with a crooked smile. "We're
all about lifting the spirit of the NBA, keeping everybody
interested, not just in us, but other teams."</TE>
<TE>   Sunday, it was about the 76ers. The Lakers shot 42.4% from the
field, missed 14 of 17 three-point shots, were outrebounded by 12 and
were outscored by 10 points in the final quarter. Shaquille O'Neal
scored 26 points and took 11 rebounds and Bryant scored 20 points,
but Allen Iverson scored 29--on 29 shots--and Dikembe Mutombo had 18
rebounds. Derrick Coleman scored 18 points, 14 in the second half.</TE>
<TE>   The game turned, finally, with 45 seconds left and Iverson running
the baseline. The 76ers held an 85-84 lead, but the Lakers had scored
five consecutive points, and no one would have blamed the 76ers if it
started to smell like the finals again.</TE>
<TE>   As he approached the Laker bench at something near full speed,
Iverson ran into O'Neal, who was guarding Mutombo, and fell--or flung
himself--to the floor.</TE>
<TE>   He made two free throws. Then Derek Fisher missed an open layup,
Mutombo made a 15-foot jump shot from the right elbow, and an
inbounds pass from Fox to Fisher went out of bounds.</TE>
<TE>   And then the bus rolled for the capital.</TE>
<TE>   Phil Jackson, relieved of his All-Star duties because of the
defeat, nevertheless appeared angry. "It comes down to Iverson
running into Shaq and falling to the floor and the referee giving him
two free throws," he said. "That's what the game comes down to, a
silly play. It doesn't make any sense, this game, sometimes."</TE>
<TE>   Replays showed that O'Neal hardly moved, if at all, as Iverson
approached. Joe DeRosa made the call.</TE>
<TE>   "He has his feet down," Jackson said. "You can't run into the
guy.... Shaq has a right to the position as much as Iverson does. He
has to be able to go around it. He can't just run into somebody and
fall down. I know he's little and Shaq is big, but you don't referee
the game on those points."</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal refused comment. Two weeks ago he threw a punch in Chicago
and hasn't offered any meaningful discussion--on the punch or other
matters--since. On Sunday he shouted over his shoulder, "I ain't got
to do ... !" and he glared.</TE>
<TE>   Fisher, replaced in the starting lineup by Lindsey Hunter two
games ago, also said little. He missed two critical late shots, the
first a 27-foot three-point attempt with 11 seconds left on the shot
clock and the Lakers behind, 83-79.</TE>
<TE>   "He wanted to make the big play and it didn't happen for him,"
Jackson said. "He has to be responsible for it. If he gets in that
situation again, he has to either come sit down or have more
responsibility."</TE>
<TE>   Fisher was two for 10 from the field, one for seven on three-point
attempts. In two games coming off the bench, he has missed nine of 10
three-point shots.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't like it," he said. "I don't like losing."</TE>

<HD>Red-Letter Day for South Korea</HD>
<DH>Soccer: Coach is carded, players are inspired, and Mexico
is defeated on penalty kicks.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GRAHAME L. JONES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Deep into injury time Sunday, after the players from South Korea and
Mexico had slogged it out for almost two scoreless hours in the
driving rain at the Rose Bowl, Guus Hiddink entered the picture.</LD>
<LD>   South Korea's Dutch coach, angered by a non-call by Honduran
referee Jose Pineda and worried that his own team was asleep, kicked
a second ball onto the field while play was in progress and promptly
was red-carded.</LD>
<LD>   The move apparently inspired the World Cup co-hosts because they
first secured the 0-0 tie in the closing minutes of overtime, then
ousted three-time champion Mexico from the CONCACAF Gold Cup, 4-2, on
penalty kicks, with goalkeeper Kim Tae-Young making two excellent
saves.</LD>
<TE>   The victory, in front of 31,628 on a damp and dismal afternoon,
put South Korea into Wednesday's semifinal against Costa Rica,
another World Cup 2002 team.</TE>
<TE>   "I must admit I did it on purpose; it was not emotion," Hiddink
said of his action. "There was a player on the ground injured and the
referee wanted to continue with the play.</TE>
<TE>   "I had a ball at my foot and to stop the game I kicked the ball
[onto the field]. That's why I think the ejection is justified."</TE>
<TE>   South Korea's victory, even on penalties, was a fair reflection of
the game. The South Koreans were more willing to take the game to
Mexico, which was lethargic at best after coming close to scoring in
the opening minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Hiddink has been worried for some time about his team's inability
to score goals and once again its finishing was appalling. The
players worked hard and created a half-dozen clear-cut scoring
opportunities only to shoot wide or be thwarted by Mexican goalkeeper
Adrian Martinez.</TE>
<TE>   When the two scoreless hours ended, the game went to the
penalty-kick phase to determine which team advanced.</TE>
<TE>   Jose Antonio Noriega and Francisco Gabriel De Anda scored for
Mexico, with Lee Eul-Young and Lee Dong-Gook doing the same for South
Korea.</TE>
<TE>   That's when Kim came up huge in the South Korean net. First, he
saved a shot by Luis Alfonso Sosa and then, after Choi Sung-Yong had
scored for South Korea, Kim threw himself to his left and turned a
shot by Ignacio Hierro around the post.</TE>
<TE>   Lee Young-Pyo then blasted the ball past Martinez and South Korea
was in the semifinals.</TE>
<TE>   Hiddink, of course, will miss the match while serving a suspension
because of his red card.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't have any problem [with that]," he said. "First of all, I
have a very, very good assistant coaching staff. Second, it's
sometimes good to see the games from above [in the Rose Bowl suites]
to see how the team is doing."</TE>
<TE>   Mexico Coach Javier Aguirre, who basically brought a third-string
team to the 12-nation tournament, partly to assess the depth
available to him for the World Cup, shrugged off the loss.</TE>
<TE>   "We did our best and finally we came to penalties," he said. "We
missed and that's the way it was."</TE>
<TE>   Mexico has a history of losing games on penalty kicks and Aguirre
was asked if the team was haunted by this.</TE>
<TE>   "The ghost is still there," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Aguirre said the Gold Cup had provided the opportunity to check
new young players and in this, at least, it had been useful.</TE>
<TE>   "I tried some new players and I'm pleased," he said. "I expect a
very good future for them."</TE>

<HD>Carter Carries Raptors</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Vince Carter took pleasure in beating Tracy McGrady.</LD>
<LD>   Carter outscored his cousin and former teammate by five points as
the Raptors ended Orlando's three-game winning streak with a 106-97
victory over the Magic on Sunday at Toronto.</LD>
<LD>   "I look forward to playing against him," said Carter, who scored
32 points. "You want to play well just because of who it is.
Sometimes with other guys, you know you have to do it, but it really
doesn't mean anything."</LD>
<TE>   Carter, guarded by McGrady, made his first six shots on a variety
of jumpers and layups, finishing with 15 points in the first quarter
as Toronto led, 34-16, its biggest first-quarter lead of the season.</TE>
<TE>   "He had the home court behind him," McGrady said. "He was pumped
and energized. He started off with a hot hand."</TE>
<TE>   McGrady, playing his second game in Toronto since leaving as a
free agent two years ago, was booed every time he touched the ball
but managed to score 27 points.</TE>
<TE>   Guarded by Jerome Williams, McGrady had three turnovers and only
two points in the first quarter.</TE>
<TE>   "I started off a little soft," McGrady said. "The crowd was booing
and I was just trying to feel out Jerome, and it took a quarter to
feel him out."</TE>
<TE>   Keon Clark added a season-high 20 points, and Antonio Davis had 17
points and 10 rebounds for the Raptors, who have won two in a row.</TE>
<TE>   Darrell Armstrong had 20 points, and McGrady had 10 rebounds for
the Magic, which never led.</TE>
<TE>   "Vince was fired up," Toronto's Chris Childs said. "He was playing
against his relative, he was playing his friend, and a guy that is
just as good as he is. He accepted that challenge."</TE>
<TE>   Carter went 13 for 23 from the field. He also had seven rebounds
and four assists.</TE>
<TE>   "It's going to be a great rivalry for a long time," Carter said of
his cousin. "We're family and we both want to win. It's fun."</TE>
<TE>   McGrady played much better in the second quarter, scoring 13
points while Carter was in the locker room, getting treatment for an
irritated right quadriceps.</TE>
<TE>   Toronto center Hakeem Olajuwon left the game in the second quarter
because of a swollen right knee. He did not return.</TE>

<DH>NFC: Faulk runs for 159 yards as Rams hold off Eagles,
29-24, to advance to Super Bowl for second time in three years.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SAM FARMER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ST. LOUIS</DL>
<LD>Determined to reach the Super Bowl for the second time in three
years, the St. Louis Rams relied on their New Orleans natives to show
them the way.</LD>
<LD>   Marshall Faulk rushed for 159 yards and Aeneas Williams made the
game-clinching interception Sunday as the Rams held off the
Philadelphia Eagles, 29-24, setting up a Superdome showdown with the
New England Patriots.</LD>
<LD>   Williams, who grew up 10 miles from Faulk in New Orleans, picked
off a pass intended for receiver Freddie Mitchell, allowing the Rams
to run all but 13 seconds off the clock. Although he made the
interception at the St. Louis 34, he was pushed all the way back into
the end zone by a mob of celebrating teammates.</LD>
<TE>   Faulk was more effective than spectacular. He simply took the wind
out of Philadelphia's defense, keeping the once-blitz-happy Eagles on
their heels with an average of 5.1 yards a carry.</TE>
<TE>   "He's probably one of the most unusual players to ever play this
game," Ram Coach Mike Martz said. "He's the best of the best, so to
speak. And when you have somebody like that, you'd be remiss if you
didn't use him."</TE>
<TE>   So the Rams used him. And used him. They responded to a 17-13
halftime deficit by resting the ball squarely in the hands of Faulk,
who opened the third quarter with seven consecutive runs. The drive
didn't result in a touchdown--Jeff Wilkins kicked a 41-yard field
goal--but it was the beginning of the end for Philadelphia's defense.</TE>
<TE>   The Eagle offense sure didn't provide a breather for the defense,
going three-and-out on three consecutive possessions.</TE>
<TE>   They didn't get a first down in the second half until the clock
showed 5:18 remaining in the game.</TE>
<TE>   By that time, the defense was worn down to a nub.</TE>
<TE>   For the Ram offensive line--which briefly lost Pro Bowl left
tackle Orlando Pace to a knee sprain--the ground strategy was a thing
of beauty.</TE>
<TE>   "I haven't met an offensive lineman yet that likes to drop back
and pass all the time," guard Adam Timmerman said. "We like to run
the ball, get the backs involved, and if we have to we'll pass on
third down."</TE>
<TE>   It isn't often those words come out of the St. Louis locker room,
where Martz and Kurt Warner have built their reputation on finding
new ways to violate a defense's airspace.</TE>
<TE>   But these Rams have found different ways to win every week. If
Isaac Bruce and Torry Holt aren't cutting cornerbacks to ribbons, Ram
defenders are playing host to end-zone parties. Then, there are those
games Martz calls Faulk's number seven times in a row ...</TE>
<TE>   "[Martz] has never done that before--and hopefully he'll never do
it again," Warner joked.</TE>
<TE>   Actually, Warner appreciated the chance to rest. He sat out of
practice Thursday because of bruised ribs, and, for the first time in
his career, got an injection before the game to numb the area.</TE>
<TE>   He also wore a bulky flak jacket with extra padding around the
tender area.</TE>
<TE>   Thing is, the fearsome Eagles barely touched him. The only time
they got to him in the first half was on the last play, when he
stayed in the pocket especially long while waiting for a Hail Mary to
develop. Linebacker Derrick Burgess just got to him, reaching out and
stripping the ball. Timmerman recovered the fumble.</TE>
<TE>   Warner escaped the second half similarly unscathed. The Eagles,
who bombarded Chicago with pass rushers a week earlier, blitzed only
12 times against the Rams, who burned them for 109 yards in those
situations.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't get the job done today," Eagle defensive end Hugh
Douglas said. "It's our job as a defense to get after the quarterback
and make some things happen. We didn't make enough things happen."</TE>
<TE>   Regardless, the Eagles were in the game until the interception by
Williams, even though things looked grim for them with 6:55 to play
when Faulk scored his second touchdown for a 29-17 lead.</TE>
<TE>   Philadelphia's Brian Mitchell returned the ensuing kickoff 41
yards to the Ram 48, setting up a brilliant no-huddle drive by
Donovan McNabb that, at least for a moment, quieted the roaring crowd
of 66,502.</TE>
<TE>   McNabb, who kept hope alive with an 11-yard pass to Chad Lewis on
fourth and seven, punctuated the drive with a three-yard touchdown
run with 3:59 remaining.</TE>
<TE>   Trailing by five, the Eagles decided not to attempt an on-side
kick, but rather rest their fate in the hands of their defense. It
was a good choice.</TE>
<TE>   St. Louis had a three-and-out and came inches from getting a punt
blocked.</TE>
<TE>   Suddenly, for Philadelphia, the road to the Super Bowl was only 55
yards long, and the Eagles had 2:20 to score.</TE>
<TE>   But four plays in, on fourth and seven, Williams stepped in front
of Mitchell and ended all the suspense.</TE>

<HD>Kalu Is Shocked He Missed Block</HD>

<BD></BD>
<DL>ST. LOUIS</DL>
<LD>How close did Philadelphia come to the Super Bowl? N.D. Kalu has to
check the film.</LD>
<LD>   Kalu, an Eagle defensive end, came oh-so-close to blocking John
Baker's punt with 2:20 to play and Philadelphia trailing by five
points. There are no guarantees, of course, but Baker was punting
from his 20 and--assuming they either recovered the loose ball or
stopped the Rams short of a first down--the Eagles would have been in
prime position for the go-ahead score.</LD>
<LD>   "After I beat the man in the slot, I thought I had it," said Kalu,
who blocked a punt against Dallas this season and tipped one against
the New York Giants. "I don't know how I missed it. I don't know if
it went through my hands or behind me, but I was there in time. I
don't know where it went. I have to see it on film."</LD>
<TE>   Somehow, Baker got off the punt, leaving Kalu to writhe on the
turf and think of what might have been.</TE>
<TE>   "Disbelief," Kalu said, when asked what he was feeling. "After I
beat the man, in my mind I was like, 'Yeah, I'm going to block this.'
And when I didn't feel it hit my hands, I was in shock. I don't know
how he got it off. It's a credit to that punter."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   At long last, Adam Timmerman got his chance--or so he thought. The
St. Louis guard recovered a Kurt Warner fumble on the last play of
the first half, rumbled across midfield and pitched to fellow guard
Tom Nutten as tacklers descended on him. Two plodding steps later,
Nutten was gang tackled. Actually, the play was blown dead, so it was
merely a humorous moment.</TE>
<TE>   "I was thinking touchdown all the way," Timmerman joked. "Then I
heard the whistle. I thought I'd lateral it to a fast guy, but then
Tom was there. I can outrun Tom."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Some statistics from the Rams' first game against New England this
season, a 24-17 victory by St. Louis: Warner threw for 401 yards and
three touchdowns with two interceptions; Marshall Faulk rushed for 83
yards in 20 carries, and caught seven passes for 70 yards, with a
touchdown; linebacker London Fletcher had 17 tackles.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Backs Athlete Appeal</HD>
<DH>Olympics: Deadline, however, may make it impossible to hear
case for bobsledder in time.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HELENE ELLIOTT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The U.S. Bobsled and Skeleton Federation said Sunday it will support
Pavle Jovanovic's appeal of a U.S. Anti-Doping Agency drug suspension
that could disqualify him from the Salt Lake City Winter Games.</LD>
<LD>   But it's unclear whether Jovanovic, of Toms River, N.J., and the
USBSF have time to make their case. Today is the deadline for
prospective Olympians' names to be submitted to the International
Olympic Committee, and the Games begin Feb. 8.</LD>
<LD>   Jovanovic, a pushman on Todd Hays' top-ranked four-man bobsled
crew, tested positive for a banned anabolic steroid during last
month's Olympic trials, the USADA announced Sunday morning. The
USADA, an independent anti-doping agency that handles the testing and
adjudication process for Olympic athletes, said Jovanovic's urine had
traces of metabolites of norandrostenedione at a concentration
greater than 2 nanograms per milliliter of urine. In accordance with
anti-doping codes of the Olympics and the international bobsled
federation, it suspended him "at least through the 2002 Olympic
Games."</LD>
<TE>   However, in a statement released Sunday afternoon, the USBSF said
Jovanovic had unknowingly ingested the substance through a dietary
supplement, and he should not be punished for a drug infraction if
such substances aren't listed on supplement labels.</TE>
<TE>   As precedent, it cited the international federation's treatment of
Latvia's Sandis Prusis, who tested positive for nandrolone Nov. 9 as
part of an out-of-competition test conducted by the World Anti-Doping
Agency and was banned from World Cup events and the Olympics. Prusis
and the Latvian Bobsled Federation appealed to the international
bobsled federation and blamed the results on dietary supplements.</TE>
<TE>   The federation relented and allowed him to compete in the
Olympics, although it wiped out his World Cup points and consigned
him to an inferior start position.</TE>
<TE>   In that case, the federation said: "There was compelling evidence
that whilst the test was positive, it was through no fault of the
athlete. There was clear evidence of negligence by third parties."</TE>
<TE>   Jovanovic, 25, slid with Hays, Randy Jones and Garrrett Hines. He
also occasionally competed with Hays in the two-man event. The U.S.
has not won a bobsled medal since 1956, but Hays has been touted as a
potential medalist in the two- and four-man races.</TE>
<TE>   According to the USBS, Dr. Donald Catlin, director of the
International Olympic Committee-accredited drug-testing lab at UCLA,
said while testifying for the USADA before the American Arbitration
Assn. and Court of Arbitration for Sport that the metabolites found
in Jovanovic's system probably came from supplements and would not
have given him a competitive advantage.</TE>
<TE>   "Certainly the USBSF does not condone the use of prohibited
substances and has vigorously prosecuted and sanctioned any athletes
found to be using them, even when those sanctions have cost America
international medals," the USBSF statement said. "However, this is
clearly not a case of an athlete intentionally cheating....</TE>
<TE>   "This is not about the USBSF protecting Olympic medal hopes. This
is about supporting a dedicated, honest athlete in his quest to
compete in the ultimate competition and having the best athletes
represent the U.S. at the Games. Dietary supplements, such as
protein, are believed by many to be necessary to compete at the
world-class level in bobsled. The USBSF does not believe that the
athletes should bear the burden of an unregulated supplement industry
that cannot guarantee all ingredients are identified on its labels.</TE>
<TE>   "The USBSF is deeply disturbed that ... Sandis Prusis, who had
approximately twice the level of metabolites in his urine, will be
competing in the Games while apparently Pavle will not."</TE>
<TE>   The USADA has announced three suspensions this year. The first two
were a two-year sanction against bobsledder Dave Owens and an
18-month sanction against boxer Joseph Pastorello. Owens acknowledged
he had used testosterone as prescribed by his doctor for treatment of
testicular cancer.</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Those who know Willie West best say the legendary coach has mellowed
in recent years, that his biting witticisms and intense deportment
have been benched like an out-of-control guard trying to take a game
into his own hands.</LD>
<LD>   Go to a Crenshaw High game, and that's exactly where you'll find
West--firmly planted on the bench. He has left the sideline patrol to
assistant Maurice Duckett and others while he sits mutely, intent on
letting the game unfold before him.</LD>
<LD>   It's not that West has lost control of his teams or isn't
involved. After suffering only his eighth home-court loss in 32
seasons a few weeks ago, West corralled his players in the locker
room for more than an hour to set them straight.</LD>
<TE>   But the 61-year-old is far removed from the days when he would get
a feel for his players by mixing it up with them on the court.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not as strict and I'm not as aggressive as I used to be,"
West conceded. "I'm still there, but I'm a little softer. I guess
it's because of the aging."</TE>
<TE>   His former players have noticed the difference.</TE>
<TE>   "He's softened around the edges a little bit," said Marques
Johnson, who starred for Crenshaw in the early 1970s before embarking
on successful careers at UCLA and in the NBA. "He used to be a
straightforward, no-nonsense, my-way-or-the-highway kind of coach. He
would yell at you for the smallest infraction or if you weren't doing
something disciplined enough in his eyes."</TE>
<TE>   And now?</TE>
<TE>   "He's not as intense. I don't think he takes it home with him
anymore," said Fremont Coach Sam Sullivan, a legend in his own right.
"He leaves it in the gym, and that's the end of it."</TE>
<TE>   While West's methods might have changed, his teams keep on
winning. The Cougars (15-6), No. 17 in The Times' rankings, are
making a push for West's 17th City Section title. Crenshaw has won
eight state titles under West, who is undefeated in state
championship games.</TE>
<TE>   With 686 victories through Sunday--698, if you count the 12 games
Crenshaw forfeited during the 1971-72 season for using an ineligible
player--West is the winningest coach in City Section history and
fifth on the all-time state list. He is atop the list of winners
among active coaches in Southern California and is closing in on
former Santa Clara Coach Lou Cvijanovich, the state leader with 829
victories.</TE>
<TE>   West has competition in Oakland Bishop O'Dowd Coach Mike Phelps,
who recently posted his 800th victory and could pass Cvijanovich next
season.</TE>
<TE>   But West isn't about numbers. For all his success on the court,
West's greatest triumph may be the impact he has had on his players,
eight of whom have gone on to play in the NBA.</TE>
<TE>   "He pushed me more than any other coach I've played for my whole
life as far as getting the most out of me," former Cougar Kris
Johnson said by phone from Doha, Qatar, where is playing in the Qatar
Basketball League.</TE>
<TE>   "He was a taskmaster. We would do these crazy conditioning drills
and be on the rope and do pushups, and this was before we would even
go in the gym. Mentally, he had you to the point where if you were
tired [during a game], it was never an excuse.</TE>
<TE>   "Off the court, he was your best friend. He was the nicest guy in
the world. On the court, he put on this mean face and was the
general."</TE>
<TE>   Kris Johnson and his father, Marques, won City Section
player-of-the-year awards at Crenshaw, becoming the first
father-and-son combination to accomplish that feat. Both went on to
win a national championship at UCLA, Marques under John Wooden and
Kris under Jim Harrick. And both say West was as influential as
anyone in their careers.</TE>
<TE>   Marques Johnson, now a commentator for Pacific 10 basketball on
Fox Sports Net, said his fondest memories of West are the times the
coach gathered his players after practice and held what Johnson
described as "fireside chats."</TE>
<TE>   "He would sit us down and talk about life issues for the next
hour, whether it was school or girls," Johnson said. "The players lay
back on their elbows and he took you on a journey. For a guy who is
perceived to be not a great conversationalist by the public, he's a
great speaker in a private setting. Those were some of the greatest
speeches I've ever heard."</TE>
<TE>   Said West: "I try to teach them to be men and be responsible. Some
of them aren't going to play basketball after high school. A lot of
kids want to go to college and we emphasize the academic aspect."</TE>
<TE>   Kris Johnson said he never saw West sacrifice his principles. When
Johnson was caught drinking an extra soda in violation of a team rule
before a game in Myrtle Beach, S.C., West made him sit outside in
30-degree temperatures while the rest of the team finished its meal.
Johnson found himself on the bench for the game, which Crenshaw lost.</TE>
<TE>   "No one is bigger than the program," Kris Johnson said. "That was
what Coach West would always preach. He never compromises his morals
or his beliefs for a player. I respect that in him."</TE>
<TE>   Critics contend that West has won because of the outrageous talent
that has walked the halls at Crenshaw. In some years, nearly 100 boys
have tried out for the varsity team. Boston Celtic star Paul Pierce
once considered playing for Crenshaw before seeing the mass of bodies
at the tryout. He attended Inglewood instead.</TE>
<TE>   "Most people say we get all the talent," West said. "I disagree
with that. I've seen teams that had more talent than we did. Maybe we
taught a little better, got our kids to perform a little better in
crucial situations."</TE>
<TE>   For all his success, West has had few offers to move on to the
college ranks. He was contacted about a job at Occidental College
after winning his first state title in 1983, but the move didn't make
financial sense. USC Coach Henry Bibby engaged in discussions with
West about an assistant position a few years ago, but nothing came of
it.</TE>
<TE>   Rival coaches such as Fremont's Sullivan sometimes wish West would
coach anywhere but Crenshaw.</TE>
<TE>   "His teams bring intensity and hard, clean, aggressive play,"
Sullivan said. "If you're going to beat them, you've got to play as
hard if not harder."</TE>
<TE>   Speculation regarding West's retirement swirls every year, but he
said that kind of talk is premature. Even though he may be a step
slower, West said he doesn't plan on going anywhere soon. "Every
year, other coaches are telling kids they shouldn't go to Crenshaw
because I'm retiring," West said. "I haven't made that announcement.
I haven't thought about that.</TE>
<TE>   "As long as I'm healthy, I'll be around. I haven't gotten tired of
it yet."</TE>

<DL>ST. LOUIS</DL>
<LD>Let's hope the Super Bowl is as good as the NFC and AFC championship
games.</LD>
<LD>   Let's hope one of the New England Patriot quarterbacks can be as
savvy, tough, gutty and clever as the Philadelphia Eagles' Donovan
McNabb. Let's keep our fingers crossed that the Patriot defenders
will not be in awe of Kurt Warner and his flotilla of receivers, will
not be overwhelmed by the running of Marshall Faulk.</LD>
<LD>   The St. Louis Rams will be coming to the Super Bowl as huge
favorites. We should thank the Eagles for giving all of us who love a
contest, who yearn for the unexpected, hope that the Super Bowl will
be fun. The Rams have already been made 14-point favorites. The
Patriots will use that, being the big underdog. Again.</LD>
<TE>   The Patriots will note that in Week 9 of the regular season,</TE>
<TE>   they played the Rams tough, stayed within a touchdown, lost,
24-17.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a great game," Warner said. "They gave us fits. I'm sure
they will again."</TE>
<TE>   The Patriots will remember</TE>
<TE>   that Pittsburgh was supposed to whip them.</TE>
<TE>   The Rams were supposed to whip the Eagles too. But the Eagles gave
the Rams fits Sunday at the Edward Jones Dome before losing, 29-24,
in the NFC championship game.</TE>
<TE>   As this season progressed, the Rams seemed able to throw the
football better than anybody. Warner had the strongest and most
accurate arm. And he had more good receivers than any team should be
allowed--Isaac Bruce, Torry Holt, Az-Zahir Hakim, Ricky Proehl, Ernie
Conwell. And the Rams ran the ball better than anybody because Faulk
was simply the best, the strongest, quickest, steadiest back in the
league. And he could catch too.</TE>
<TE>   And the Ram defense ranked No. 1 in the NFC. This hardly was fair,
being able to score at will and then stop the other team from
scoring. What was the point, really, of having the Super Bowl? That
was the feeling around the league after the Rams demolished Green Bay
in the NFC divisional playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   Not anymore.</TE>
<TE>   The Super Bowl won't be a coronation. It will be a competition.</TE>
<TE>   Philadelphia had a chance to beat the Rams on Sunday. The Eagles
had the ball twice in the final three minutes. They had a
quarterback, McNabb, capable of making miracles. They had heart and
will and that they ended up losing was not an embarrassment.</TE>
<TE>   It was proof that the NFL can be fun.</TE>
<TE>   It was confirmation that football titles should be decided by
playoffs and not a bowl championship series.</TE>
<TE>   The Steelers weren't supposed to lose to New England. The Eagles
weren't supposed to hang with the Rams.</TE>
<TE>   The Super Bowl will be exhilarating.</TE>
<TE>   New England will bring a quarterback controversy and a pretty
cocky attitude to New Orleans.</TE>
<TE>   The Patriots beat Pittsburgh, the big favorite, on the road Sunday
in the AFC championship game.</TE>
<TE>   They did it even though their young quarterback, Tom Brady, got
hurt. They did it because their old quarterback, Drew Bledsoe, had
something to prove.</TE>
<TE>   These teams, these players, the ones with something to prove, they
can be dangerous.</TE>
<TE>   St. Louis will bring an unexpected joy and a renewed sense of
purpose to New Orleans. They learned something Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   "This is very, very rewarding," Warner said.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody expected us to be on top. Everybody was shooting for us
all year and that's not always an easy position to be in. Every week
teams got up to play us.</TE>
<TE>   "Two years ago it wasn't like that. So in that sense, this is more
rewarding.</TE>
<TE>   "Winning a game like this, that's also rewarding."</TE>
<TE>   When Aeneas Williams intercepted McNabb, a pass that was intended
for Freddie Mitchell, there was 1:55 to play in the game and the Rams
reacted as if they were little boys who had just beaten their big
brothers.</TE>
<TE>   They all chased Williams into the end zone and jumped on him.
Right end Grant Wistrom, a hulk of a man with long, wild hair and
fierce, dark eyes, got down on his hands and knees and pounded the
turf in pure joy.</TE>
<TE>   As the Rams ran out the clock (the Eagles did get one, last,
fruitless play with three seconds left), they were giggling and
cavorting and clowning and being kids again.</TE>
<TE>   It's hard work being the target, just as Warner said. It makes
your hair turn gray, it makes your stomach turn over.</TE>
<TE>   And sometimes it becomes boring watching excellence. It becomes
ho-hum when every Warner pass is spot on and caught by a swift,
strong receiver. It becomes enervating to watch Faulk run over the
defense, run around it and through it, watch him shrug off a tackler,
run past another.</TE>
<TE>   It isn't sporting when one team seems to have all the best
players.</TE>
<TE>   But the Eagles played with insouciance, with a sizzling sense that
their time had come, that they had, in McNabb, the singular star who
could out-dazzle all the Ram stars. For a while he could. And then he
couldn't.</TE>
<TE>   He couldn't because the Eagles couldn't get the ball. Faulk
wouldn't let them. The Rams ran 22 of the 28 plays in the third
quarter. The Rams had the ball for more than 12 minutes of the third
quarter. The Rams scored all 10 points in the third quarter.</TE>
<TE>   As the Rams celebrated the victory and their second Super Bowl
trip in the last three years, McNabb stood quietly in the tunnel and
watched.</TE>
<TE>   He stood there, he said, so he could feel what the Rams were
feeling, so he could soak up the emotion and the amazement.</TE>
<TE>   He wanted, he said, to capture the moment, implant the memory,
make it his own so that he will not be happy without his own Super
Bowl moment.</TE>
<TE>   All season the Rams have offered excellence. The Eagles knew that
only their own excellence would be good enough Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   The Patriots know they will have to be excellent next Sunday and
they proved against the Steelers that they understand excellence.</TE>
<TE>   What the 2002 Super Bowl has are two teams ready to be excellent.</TE>

<HD>Unremarkably, Johansson Fills Void</HD>

<DL>MELBOURNE, Australia</DL>
<LD>MELBOURNE, Australia--There had been close calls before, but cosmic
forces and mere happenstance saved other men's Grand Slam finals from
the abyss. For instance, if Andre Agassi had not pulled himself
together, there would have been a Dominik Hrbaty-Andrei Medvedev
final at the 1999 French Open.</LD>
<LD>   But eventually, the day came and it wasn't pretty.</LD>
<LD>   How long will sports fans--of a non-Swedish variety--remember that
Thomas Johansson won the 2002 Australian Open?</LD>
<TE>   An invisible man for an invisible Slam.</TE>
<TE>   Now, Johansson has a game of fine variety. But along the way, he
had to beat only one player seeded ahead of him--Marat Safin, in the
final.</TE>
<TE>   At 26, he is hardly a star of the future.</TE>
<TE>   This wasn't like a teenage Boris Becker at Wimbledon in 1985,
pounding and tumbling his way through the draw, beating Henri
Leconte, Anders Jarryd and Kevin Curren in the last three rounds.</TE>
<TE>   Johansson had to take out Adrian Voinea, Jonas Bjorkman and Jiri
Novak to reach the final.</TE>
<TE>   It's difficult to find an adequate comparison. On the women's
side, this would be something like 20th-seeded Rita Grande, who turns
27 in March, winning a Grand Slam without having to beat Venus
Williams, Martina Hingis or Kim Clijsters.</TE>
<TE>   Here, the top men were either injured (Agassi) or ill (Lleyton
Hewitt) or upset early (Gustavo Kuerten and Yevgeny Kafelnikov).
American youngster Andy Roddick filled two categories by himself,
injured and an early upset victim.</TE>
<TE>   Once they were all gone, the question became clear: Who is the
next star?</TE>
<TE>   "It's tough to have semifinals with Rafter, Hewitt, [Pete]
Sampras, Agassi every year," Johansson said. "I think if you have new
players coming up, that's a great thing because you would have all
the time the top four guys in the semis, and I don't think that's
fun.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's nice to have new guys coming up, and I'm not a new
guy."</TE>
<TE>   Neither were several of the other quarterfinalists, 30-year-old
Wayne Ferreira, 29-year-old Bjorkman and 26-year-old Marcelo Rios.</TE>
<TE>   Tommy Haas, who lost to Safin in the semifinals, is, along with
Safin, considered one of the "New Balls, Please" group.</TE>
<TE>   Safin didn't help matters. His often-desultory effort in the final
against Johansson was sharply criticized by television commentators.</TE>
<TE>   He seemed almost insulted at having to chase after drop shots, and
his backhand was often hit at half-speed--at times playing as if it
was a practice hit, not a championship final.</TE>
<TE>   Certainly, Safin did have an exhausting semifinal. But he showed
he could turn up his level of intensity, if he wanted, in the fourth
set, especially when Johansson started to quiver and shake with
nerves.</TE>
<TE>   "I already won a Grand Slam, and here I was the favorite," Safin
said. "Just, I couldn't manage to win it. So it's not very good for
me, but you know, it's a good lesson for me for the future. He
overpowered me today. I have to be more clever."</TE>
<TE>   That may not be the correct answer. The solution may have been
there the previous day, in the women's final, where, guts, not
cleverness, won it. Jennifer Capriati and Martina Hingis staggered
around in the heat for 2 hours 10 minutes. Hingis squeaked and
squealed. Capriati swore after what she perceived as a bad call.</TE>
<TE>   Capriati survived four match points in the second set and won it
in three, defending her title.</TE>
<TE>   She spotted a TV cameraman moving onto the court during one of the
match points against her and it annoyed her. Later, Capriati was
sitting in the players' lounge with some American reporters and she
took note of that moment.</TE>
<TE>   "That's sort of ironic," Capriati said. "I hate it when they do
that. Maybe that did help. Like, 'Yeah, it is not over yet.'"</TE>
<TE>   Hingis could not convert on the four match points and it went into
a third set. No female player had survived four match points in a
Grand Slam final, and Capriati and Hingis headed into the dressing
room for a 10-minute break because of the heat.</TE>
<TE>   It was as though they were boxers in a championship fight going
back to their corners between rounds.</TE>
<TE>   "It was really like that," Capriati said. "Martina's not too far
away and they're doing the same thing to her. We were both in the
training room."</TE>
<TE>   Even on the court, they needed to sit. Hingis leaned against the
scoreboard and Capriati took a chair at the back of the court. "I
would look up and she would be gone," Capriati said. "Where'd she
go?"</TE>
<TE>   Capriati said she is a boxing fan.</TE>
<TE>   "I like the special matches," she said. "Whenever [Mike] Tyson is
boxing too, you know it's going to be kind of interesting. But it
doesn't mean I like to fight."</TE>
<TE>   Three Grand Slam singles titles suggest a fighting spirit, though.
Let's just say her fighting skills are of the forehand and backhand
variety.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The Bruins' 64-57 victory over California Saturday served as a
reminder that UCLA is an exceptional shooting team.</LD>
<LD>   Cal was leading the Pacific 10 in most defensive categories,
holding opponents to 39% shooting. Yet UCLA shot 51.1% from the
field, including 54.5% in the second half.</LD>
<LD>   Starters Billy Knight (five of eight), Jason Kapono (five of
nine), Dan Gadzuric (six of 11) and Cedric Bozeman (two of three)
made more than half their shots. Matt Barnes, UCLA's hottest shooter
of late, made four of 10.</LD>
<TE>   UCLA is shooting 48%, second in the conference to Oregon (49.1%),
the Bruins' opponent Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   All four UCLA centers and power forwards--Barnes, Gadzuric, T.J.
Cummings and Andre Patterson--are shooting better than 50%. And the
two players who take the most perimeter shots--Kapono and
Knight--also are shooting well.</TE>
<TE>   Kapono is 60 for 121 on three-point attempts, Knight is 41 for 95
and the team leads the conference from beyond the arc at 41.8%.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Free throws are a different story. UCLA made only 14 of 23 against
Cal and has shot under 70% five games in a row.</TE>
<TE>   Part of the problem is that Barnes and Gadzuric draw the most
fouls while shooting and neither is proficient from the line.</TE>
<TE>   Also, the free-throw shooting of Bozeman, the point guard, is a
glaring weakness. He has made three of 15, and Coach Steve Lavin
doesn't allow him to bring the ball up the court when UCLA is ahead
and opponents are forced to foul.</TE>
<TE>   That role falls to Kapono (86.6%) and Knight (81.9%), who are by
far the most reliable free-throw shooters.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>After picking up his fourth foul with 15:19 to play against Stanford
on Saturday, point guard Brandon Granville was reduced to playing the
unaccustomed role of towel-waving cheerleader ... until the game's
final 45 seconds.</LD>
<LD>   Granville didn't mind.</LD>
<LD>   "Nah, I wasn't frustrated," he said. "The guys were rolling, I
just wanted to win."</LD>
<TE>   Granville's acumen at the free-throw line made sure USC pulled out
a 90-82 victory. He made all eight of his free throws, all in the
final 45 seconds, and has made 32 in a row.</TE>
<TE>   The senior, who finished with 10 points and five assists in 20
minutes, also had two steals to give him 209 for his career,
overtaking Stais Boseman (208) at the top of the USC career chart.</TE>
<TE>   Granville, a four-year starter, is also USC's all-time leader in
assists (693) and three-point field goals (199) and is closing in on
minutes played.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Mired in a three-game "freshman slump," guard Errick Craven
approached Sam Clancy before the Stanford game and told him he was
planning on snapping out of it against the 17th-ranked Cardinal.</TE>
<TE>   "I told him, 'Don't talk about it, be about it,'" Clancy said.</TE>
<TE>   Craven was all about it against Stanford. After averaging 9.3
points on 30% shooting over the previous three games, Craven torched
the Cardinal for 18 points on six-of-12 shooting.</TE>
<TE>   "I was frustrated," said Craven, who also had five steals, three
assists and three turnovers in 34 minutes before fouling out. "You
can play defense every night. You can't make shots every night."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Fellow freshman Rory O'Neil showed the Cardinal what it missed out
on.</TE>
<TE>   The 6-foot-11 center, who nearly chose to attend Stanford out of
Ridgecrest Burroughs High, had a career-high 14 points while making
seven of eight shots. He also had four rebounds, two blocks, a steal
and an assist in 24 minutes before fouling out.</TE>
<TE>   "It just so happened that I got some open shots and the shots were
dropping," O'Neil said. "The more time you get, the more comfortable
you get and the more you're into the rhythm of the game."</TE>

semifinals with 4-0 victory over El Salvador.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Clint Mathis made his long-awaited return to the United States
national soccer team Sunday, but it was overshadowed by an
exceptional performance from Brian McBride.</LD>
<LD>   The 29-year-old striker scored three goals--his first hat trick
for the U.S.--as the Americans overwhelmed El Salvador, 4-0, on a
soggy afternoon at the Rose Bowl.</LD>
<LD>   The victory put the U.S. into Wednesday's semifinal of the sixth
CONCACAF Gold Cup, against defending champion Canada.</LD>
<TE>   "We started the game in a strong fashion today," said U.S Coach
Bruce Arena. "Getting that early goal and then the second one
following shortly made our task a lot easier."</TE>
<TE>   The Americans took the lead in the ninth minute when McBride took
a pass from Frankie Hejduk and headed the ball past El Salvador
goalkeeper Santos Rivera.</TE>
<TE>   Two minutes later, he made it 2-0 when Cobi Jones fed him the ball
and he again beat Rivera from close range.</TE>
<TE>   The Salvadoran team was still reeling from those twin blows when
McBride put the game out of reach with a third goal in the 21st
minute, finishing off a move that also involved Ante Razov, Eddie
Lewis and Landon Donovan.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously he [McBride] took his chances quite well," Arena said.
"The first one wasn't an easy goal. He did well with his header. He's
in the right spots, he's in front of the goal where we want him."</TE>
<TE>   The fourth U.S. goal came in the 72nd minute when DaMarcus
Beasley, who is rapidly making sure that he will be on the World Cup
squad that Arena takes to South Korea in May, beat his defender on
the left flank and crossed the ball for Razov to score with relative
ease.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. outshot the Salvadorans, 19-5, and the victory gave the
Americans a 13-1-1 record in matches in which McBride scores a goal.</TE>
<TE>   "Unfortunately, he gets married in the middle of February, so
we're going to miss him for the game against Italy [on Feb. 13],"
Arena said. "I would have loved to have seen him in that game."</TE>
<TE>   McBride said teamwork was the reason the U.S. won.</TE>
<TE>   "I think our runs in the box today were very good," he said. "We
freed up guys at the back post and we took our chances. That was
something we needed to work on after the first two games [against
South Korea and Cuba]."</TE>
<TE>   Mathis, sidelined by a knee ligament injury in June, came into the
game for the final 27 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   "It's going to take him probably another two months before he's
ready, but it's good to see him back on the field," Arena said. "I
think psychologically it helped him today, just to put the uniform on
and get back on the field."</TE>
<TE>   The only bad news for the U.S. was that Razov suffered a groin
injury and defender Carlos Bocanegra hurt his ankle.</TE>
<TE>   "Certainly, the field conditions were not ideal toward the end of
the game and we were dealing with some bad fouls as well," Arena
said. "It has taken its toll on our players a little bit. We're
probably going to have to replace a couple of players."</TE>
<TE>   El Salvador Coach Jorge Humberto Recinos offered no excuses. His
team was beaten, pure and simple, and there was little to say.</TE>
<TE>   "The U.S. team was totally superior to us," he said. "They scored
the first two goals early. Nobody was prepared for that. They are a
lot better than us."</TE>

<HD>Shipwreck Implicated in Mysterious Bird Deaths</HD>
<DH>Probe: Shifting currents may explain why oil appears sporadically.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN M. GLIONNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO
</DL>
<LD>Since it exploded and sank in 1984, the oil tanker Puerto Rican has
languished on the ocean floor like a submerged sphinx, guarding its
secrets beneath 1,476 feet of frigid Pacific waters.</LD>
<LD>   Now the forlorn vessel has resurfaced at the center of a deep-sea
mystery: The Puerto Rican may be responsible for an elusive offshore oil
trail that has haunted authorities for as long as a decade--so far
killing and injuring 1,300 seabirds this winter alone.</LD>
<LD>   An elite team of oil spill trouble-shooters is focusing on the
20,000-ton tanker and several other shipwrecks, including a sunken
aircraft carrier, a pair of World War II-era Army oil barges that
vanished during a fierce winter storm and a decommissioned hospital ship
the military dynamited off the San Francisco coast in 1952.</LD>
<TE>   In an event dubbed the "San Mateo Mystery Oil Spill," droves of
flightless common murres have been brought to shore since Thanksgiving,
covered in a thick, toxic oil whose source has baffled environmental
experts.</TE>
<TE>   Was the slick caused by natural seepage from the ocean's depths? Or
was it the result of reckless and illegal dumping at sea?</TE>
<TE>   The task force, a veteran group of scientists and bureaucrats from
half a dozen state and federal agencies, now theorizes that the birds
swam through an oil sheen that for years has bubbled up from the steel
skeleton of some unknown wreck like blobs inside a lava lamp.</TE>
<TE>   The notion could explain not only this season's spill but perhaps a
much larger oceanic enigma: that a single spill source could possibly be
connected to thousands of oil-covered birds that came ashore throughout
the 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   Like some serial killer, the oil returns time after time, propelled by
shifting offshore currents.</TE>
<TE>   "We've still got a long way to go, but we're finally seeing some light
after a couple of very dark months," said task force member Harlan
Henderson, a retired Coast Guard captain and former commander of the Port
of San Francisco. "It's been frustrating to keep searching, knowing more
of these oiled birds come every day."</TE>
<TE>   The 49-year-old New Jersey native, administrator of the state's Office
of Spill Prevention and Response, managed several federal oil spill
cleanup teams that worked on the Exxon Valdez disaster and the Saudi
Arabian oil fields set ablaze during the Persian Gulf War.</TE>
<TE>   California's spill prevention effort was established 11 years ago
after the Valdez spill and another mishap off Huntington Beach. The
current cleanup is funded with $2 million in federal oil-spill recovery
funds.</TE>
<TE>   These days, inside a rural command center halfway between San
Francisco and Sacramento, Henderson huddles with task force members who
are equal parts Jacques Cousteau and Joe Friday--bringing expertise in
such fields as deep-sea biology, coastal weather patterns and bird
habitats. They even include a former commercial oil ship captain familiar
with the brute physics of maneuvering a lumbering ocean tanker.</TE>
<TE>   Using high-tech gadgetry and sea-wise hunches, investigators have
plotted bird migration patterns, offshore currents and commercial
shipping routes. They have also run lab tests to compare the
"fingerprints" of recovered oil with those of suspect sources.</TE>
<TE>   C-130 airplanes have patrolled endless miles of ocean, using infra-red
radar to detect oil sheens. On Thursday, officials spotted what they
believed was their spill 17 miles west of the Golden Gate Bridge. But the
potential slick turned out to be floating sewage.</TE>
<TE>   Officials also have spent from $1,200 to $3,000 each for numerous
images of the spill area taken by commercial satellites.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities have now ruled out any chance that raw crude escaped from
fissures in the sea floor. They also say the leak did not come from a
tanker carrying crude from Alaska's North Slope fields.</TE>
<TE>   From a total of 3,000 possible ships, they eventually reduced the
suspect lineup to six tankers that have repeatedly passed through the
spill area. But they are now reasonably convinced that the ships did not
discharge oily waste water while cleaning tanks at sea.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, the team has set its sights on the shipwrecks--plotting their
locations on computer-generated maps at headquarters like so many
potential crime scenes.</TE>
<TE>   But there are no easy answers in a case that could take investigators
to the ocean's dark depths. For starters, it's expensive to venture to
the sea floor in search of the ships; a submersible used to explore such
wrecks costs $24,000 a day to operate.</TE>
<TE>   "Pinpointing the exact location of these ships is incredibly hard,"
said Lt. Tim Callister, a Coast Guard spokesman. "It took forever to find
the Titanic. And while that ship was deeper, finding these vessels is
like saying, 'Why don't we just go to the moon?' "</TE>
<TE>   The most recent chapter in the mystery began Nov. 24, when scores of
common murres--a diving seabird with black and white coloring--washed up
along a 220-mile stretch of coastline from Monterey to Marin County. Day
after day, freshly oiled birds surfaced.</TE>
<TE>   "With a typical spill, we have a relatively obvious oil source and can
quickly decipher what we're dealing with," Callister said. "In this case,
we didn't have any of those answers."</TE>
<TE>   So far, 1,300 birds have been recovered. About 750 were found dead and
another 350 were destroyed because their injuries were so severe. Nearly
200 have been treated and released at the International Bird Rescue
Research Center northeast of San Francisco. Experts say they recover
perhaps only one in 20 injured birds, and believe the true creature
casualty total could reach 20,000 or more.</TE>
<TE>   For investigators, the probe means a return to the waters south of the
Farallon, an austere clump of islands 30 miles west of the Golden Gate
Bridge. In 1997, a similar unexplained spill in the area killed 2,000
seabirds. But this time, task force members have oil samples collected
from that spill and others to lead them to a suspect.</TE>
<TE>   "Police know that any piece of evidence might take years to find its
way into the puzzle," Callister said. "But these samples are obviously
proving their worth now."</TE>
<TE>   Mounting evidence has taken the team into a once-unexplored maritime
past. Members are sifting through records of some of the 1,500 vessels
that have sunk offshore in the region since the 1890s.</TE>
<TE>   Officials know of only one other oil-leaking shipwreck, the battleship
Arizona, which sits at the bottom of Pearl Harbor, Hawaii. But they
believe any one of several local wrecks could have succumbed to old age
and the relentless pressure of the ocean depths to at last release their
cargo.</TE>
<TE>   Officials believe the oil is leaking year-round but drifts toward the
coast only behind a strong current and winds associated with storms in
the late fall and winter.</TE>
<TE>   The task force is reviewing the military records of such ships as the
aircraft carrier Independence, contaminated during the 1950s Bikini atoll
atomic bomb tests and later sunk in 3,300 feet of water.</TE>
<TE>   But no wreck holds more intrigue than the Puerto Rican, whose sinking
was itself clouded in mystery. On Oct. 31, 1984, while the ship chugged
toward the Panama Canal, three explosions shook the 632-foot
petrochemical tanker, killing one crewman.</TE>
<TE>   The blasts cracked the vessel in half and portions of its broken bow
were later towed to San Francisco. The rest sank along with a cargo of
8,500 barrels of oil.</TE>
<TE>   The FBI first labeled the accident "highly suspicious," theorizing
that a bomb was planted on board stemming from a dispute between shipping
companies and a longshoreman's union.</TE>
<TE>   The sinking was later blamed on "incompatible cargoes" that leaked
together, causing an explosion.</TE>
<TE>   Nearly two decades later, the Puerto Rican may yield even more clues
when investigators visit the ship and other wrecks later this year in a
submersible the size of a Volkswagen Beetle.</TE>
<TE>   "So far, we've been confounded by thousands of feet of water," said
Kim McCleneghan, an environmental specialist with the Office of Spill
Prevention and Response. "But once we find this wreck and its leak,
there's a knottier question to answer: How do we stop it?"</TE>
<TE>   Officials will then have to decide whether to try to cover the ship or
attempt to salvage the vessel.</TE>
<TE>   "That will be a whole other problem," said task force member Scott
Schafer. "We may need to add even more experts to our team."</TE>

<HD>In Canada, a Sea Change Follows Wave of Terrorism</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>OTTAWA
</DL>
<LD>Canada's quiet Victorian-era capital may seem serenely unchanged,
but officials and citizens agree that the political landscape here has
been dramatically and perhaps permanently transformed.</LD>
<LD>   There are the minor but symbolically important inconveniences: No
longer, for example, can Canadians drive up to the doors of their ornate
Parliament building or wander freely in its corridors.</LD>
<LD>   Less visible, but far more significant in a culture that puts a
premium on privacy, are the wide-ranging powers the government has been
granted since Sept. 11. It can now intercept e-mail, ban inflammatory
speechmaking and interrogate anyone suspected of having knowledge about
terrorist activities.</LD>
<TE>   And from bars to bus stops to federal office buildings, the usual talk
of hockey and political intrigue is overshadowed by discussion of the
infantry battalion about to be airlifted from Edmonton to Kandahar--the
first Canadian combat troops, as opposed to peacekeepers, to be deployed
abroad since the Korean War.</TE>
<TE>   "This is not a peacekeeping mission," Defense Minister Art Eggleton
stressed in Parliament this month. "The military campaign in Afghanistan
is not over yet."</TE>
<TE>   The decision to dispatch the renowned Princess Patricia's Canadian
Light Infantry to Afghanistan--and to place the nation's combat forces
under U.S. command for the first time since the Korean conflict--is a
striking example of what analysts say is the most notable change here
since Sept. 11. There is a strong new pro-American tilt of the political
center, led by the once nationalist-minded Liberal Party.</TE>
<TE>   Prime Minister Jean Chretien is using his solid majority in Parliament
to align his government with the Bush administration's counter-terrorism
campaign in Central Asia and North America alike, with new joint border
patrols and the importation into Canada of U.S. Customs agents, among
other controversial initiatives.</TE>
<TE>   "There has been a profound change in the way the U.S. and Canada do
business," said a Canadian Foreign Ministry official here as he headed
out the door for a recent meeting in Washington with Thomas J. Ridge, the
U.S. homeland security director.</TE>
<TE>   The new security measures are not designed primarily to protect
Canadians, officials here contend, but to ensure that their nation does
not become a staging ground for attacks against the United States.</TE>
<TE>   "Canada has never been a target for international terrorism, but there
is a concern that Canada not be used as a giant aircraft carrier for
terrorists targeting Americans," said a Justice Ministry official who
helped draft Canada's month-old anti-terrorist legislation. Like most
senior civil servants here who agreed to be interviewed, the official
asked not to be identified.</TE>
<TE>   Chretien has drawn the expected rebukes from the New Democratic Party,
the leading bloc to his party's left, which charged that he is "turning
Canada into the 51st state." The criticism has been joined by mainstream
opinion makers, including Chretien's former foreign minister, Lloyd
Axworthy, who said sending troops to fight under U.S. command was
tantamount to a surrender of sovereignty.</TE>
<TE>   Chretien's foreign policy team bats away the criticism.</TE>
<TE>   "When Mr. Axworthy was foreign minister, we were involved in Bosnia
and Kosovo and other places with Americans, in fact frequently under
American command structures," said John Manley, the newly designated
deputy prime minister, who is charged with coordinating national security
policies with allies.</TE>
<TE>   To the surprise of many analysts here, the pro-American stance appears
to have strengthened rather than jeopardized the government's standing.
The largest opposition party, the rightist Canadian Alliance, advocates
even closer ties with the U.S., and polls show two-thirds of respondents
supporting the American-led military coalition abroad and strict
anti-terrorism laws at home.</TE>
<TE>   "In the wake of September 11th, security has jumped to the top of the
agenda here," said Mike Thielman, who heads the Canadian solicitor
general's Counter-Terrorism Division.</TE>
<TE>   Security cooperation with Washington began almost immediately: When
the U.S. closed its airspace to incoming aircraft Sept. 11, the Chretien
government volunteered within the hour to have scores of jets diverted to
Canada.</TE>
<TE>   "This government took a big risk that day," said the Foreign Ministry
official. "Nobody knew if there would be more attacks."</TE>
<TE>   Canada quickly complied with a U.S. request to put plainclothes air
marshals on every flight from Canada to Washington's Reagan National
Airport--even though Canada had never had such a program. About 2,000 of
the 16,000 officers in the Royal Canadian Mounted Police were reassigned
in September to terrorism-related jobs, most along the U.S. border,
officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Stung by critics here who said its visa rules were too lax, Canada's
immigration service intensified screening at overseas airports of inbound
passengers. "It is as though we took a system that was not on alert and
put it on permanent alert," said a top immigration official.</TE>
<TE>   In the Justice Ministry, meanwhile, government lawyers immediately
began drafting counter-terrorism laws. "We had our first meeting on the
afternoon of the 11th," recalled a leader of one team of 30 lawyers, "and
within a month we had a bill written and submitted."</TE>
<TE>   Civil libertarians here concentrated their fire on two provisions of
the legislation. One called for court-ordered "investigative hearings"
that could compel testimony from uncooperative witnesses or unindicted
co-conspirators in terrorist-related offenses. The other gave new
authority for the preventive detention of suspects for up to 72 hours in
terrorism cases.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the objections, the legislation was adopted in Parliament by
an overwhelming majority in November and became law in late December.</TE>
<TE>   The terror attacks also forced the government to revamp its 2002
budget, adding $7 billion in security expenditures, most of the money for
the military. The appropriations will deepen an already severe deficit.</TE>
<TE>   Some Canadian nationalists worry that security fears will lead to a
common external border patrolled primarily by Americans. Those concerns
intensified when U.S. Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft signed an agreement here
in December for border policing and intelligence-sharing that he said
represents "a sea change" in U.S.-Canadian relations. The agreement will
put U.S. Customs Service agents in Canadian seaports handling southbound
container cargo. The Bush administration announced Friday that it was
requesting an additional $2.1 billion for further security measures at
both the northern and southern U.S. borders.</TE>
<TE>   The Mounties, meanwhile, have formed joint "border enforcement teams"
with U.S. law enforcement agencies. Just one of these teams, working
along a 100-mile stretch of the St. Lawrence Seaway, has 70
representatives from a dozen agencies from both sides of the border.</TE>
<TE>   "Since September 11th, there has been a speeding up of the
'continentalization' that started with the free trade agreements," said
Maude Barlow, head of the Council of Canadians, a leading force in
anti-globalization protests here.</TE>
<TE>   "And now for the first time since Korea, we have Canadian soldiers
serving under Americans, as if we were Americans," she said. "Our
culture, and our country, are all being merged into one North America."</TE>
<TE>   But Barlow concedes that most Canadians appear less than concerned
about a blurring of their national identity.</TE>
<TE>   Many observers here have been surprised by the depth of the
pro-American response--and the seeming lack of American awareness of that
backing.</TE>
<TE>   On Sept. 14, a hastily organized demonstration of support for the U.S.
drew about 100,000 people in Ottawa. A few weeks later, 20,000 Canadians
trooped to New York for a solidarity visit--a gesture largely ignored
south of the border.</TE>
<TE>   Nor have many Americans understood the extent to which Canadian
political and military priorities have been altered, officials say.</TE>
<TE>   "What we do doesn't resonate down here," Paul Heinbecker, Canada's
ambassador to the United Nations, said in a recent interview in his New
York office.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, Canadian officials contend that there is an unjustified but
widespread U.S. perception that Canada harbors terrorists from North
Africa and the Middle East. "There is no evidence whatsoever of any
Canadian link to the events of 9/11," said Sgt. Paul Marsh, spokesman for
the Mounties.</TE>
<TE>   Still, there is acute retrospective interest on both sides of the
border in the case of Ahmed Ressam, who was caught crossing from Canada
to Washington state in 1999 with a trunkful of explosives he admitted
were intended for an attack on Los Angeles International Airport. He was
convicted on terrorism charges last April.</TE>
<TE>   Ressam, a confessed Al Qaeda operative who lived in Montreal and
traveled with a forged Canadian passport, was "an isolated case," Marsh
contends. However, another former Montreal resident, Mokhtar Haouari, who
provided Ressam with funds and a forged Canadian driver's license, was
sentenced this month to 24 years in prison by a U.S. federal judge.</TE>
<TE>   Ashcroft announced Friday that one of five suspected Al Qaeda
terrorists who appear in videotapes discovered in Afghanistan has been
identified as a Tunisian-born Canadian citizen. The man's whereabouts is
unknown, Ashcroft said, thanking Canada for its "significant assistance"
in the case.</TE>
<TE>   Although Canada may not have been a past target of terrorists, the
military alliance with Washington in Afghanistan could change that,
officials here fear. "As we become more engaged in this action, there is
an elevated risk," said Thielman, the counter-terrorism expert.</TE>
<TE>   Some critics here assert that the deployment represents an unsettling
departure from the Canadian military's recent role in international
peacekeeping missions. By early February, Canada will have nearly 3,000
soldiers and sailors in and around Afghanistan, a commitment surpassed
only by the U.S., Britain and France.</TE>
<TE>   The government was assailed in Parliament for the announcement that it
would turn over prisoners captured by its forces to U.S. commanders in
Afghanistan. Yet there has been little criticism over the combat
commitment itself.</TE>
<TE>   Many Canadians are gratified that the Princess Patricia's Canadian
Light Infantry has been asked to serve alongside the U.S. 101st Airborne
Division in combat.</TE>
<TE>   "They welcome and support it," said army Col. Tim Grant, the chief
spokesman for Canada's armed forces, "as this shows that we are not a
gendarmerie; in fact, we are an army."</TE>

<HD>U.S. Reporter Is Seized in Pakistan</HD>
<DH>Asia: Group holding Wall Street Journal writer wants prisoners in
Cuba to be released.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BOB DROGIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>A veteran Wall Street Journal reporter who disappeared Wednesday in
Pakistan has been kidnapped, the paper announced Sunday, and a previously
unknown group claiming to hold him is demanding the release of suspected
Pakistani terrorists in U.S. custody at the Navy base at Guantanamo Bay,
Cuba.</LD>
<LD>   In e-mail messages sent overnight to the Los Angeles Times and other
U.S. and Pakistani media, but not to the Wall Street Journal, the group
said it was holding Daniel Pearl, the paper's South Asia bureau chief. It
also threatened to kidnap other Americans.</LD>
<LD>   Four color photographs were attached to the e-mail. The first shows a
man in a white robe grabbing Pearl's hair with one hand and pointing a
black pistol at his head with the other. Pearl is hunched over in the
photograph, his hands wrapped in chains.</LD>
<TE>   A second photograph simply shows Pearl hunched over, his hands in
chains. The final two show him staring at the camera, holding up the
front page of Dawn, Pakistan's largest English-language newspaper. The
photo is blurry and the date of the paper is not clear. Pearl appears
unshaven but does not display any bruises.</TE>
<TE>   Pearl went alone Wednesday for an arranged meeting with a terrorist
source outside the port city of Karachi in southern Pakistan, colleagues
said. He was working on a report about radical Islamic groups.</TE>
<TE>   Identifying themselves in the e-mail as the National Movement for the
Restoration of Pakistani Sovereignty, the kidnappers alleged that Pearl
is a CIA officer "posing as a journalist." Both the CIA and the Journal
denied any link Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   "Although we normally don't discuss whether someone is employed by the
agency, I can tell you Danny Pearl does not now nor has he ever worked
for the CIA," said Anya Guilsher, a CIA spokeswoman. Since 1977, CIA
policy has barred hiring U.S. journalists except in what the agency calls
"extraordinary" circumstances.</TE>
<TE>   "He has no connection whatever with the government of the United
States," including the CIA, said Steven Goldstein, a spokesman for Dow
Jones &amp; Co., which publishes the Journal. "As a private citizen employed
by an independent newspaper, neither Mr. Pearl, nor we, can change the
policies of the United States or Pakistan."</TE>
<TE>   The "terrorists who have seized Daniel Pearl have made a mistake,"
said Goldstein, who appealed for his immediate release.</TE>
<TE>   "Nothing can be served by his continued detention," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The kidnappers' group is unknown to U.S. intelligence, but one
official said it might be an offshoot of a larger terrorist organization.
The e-mail does not cite the potent political and religious grievances
usually cited by local terrorists, however, so the group may be new. The
Karachi area, where Pearl disappeared, is notorious for kidnapping gangs
and political violence.</TE>
<TE>   Pakistani officials speculated that the group is tied to Harkat
Moujahedeen, a Pakistani group that is on the U.S. government's list of
terrorist organizations. The group has used bombings, assassinations and
other attacks in an effort to dislodge India from the disputed Himalayan
territory of Kashmir.</TE>
<TE>   Members of the group have been killed alongside Al Qaeda and Taliban
fighters in Afghanistan in recent months. Other members were killed when
the Clinton administration fired cruise missiles at an Al Qaeda training
camp in eastern Afghanistan in August 1998, after two U.S. embassies in
East Africa were bombed.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. and Pakistani law enforcement and intelligence authorities were
examining the Hotmail message and the photographs, as well as other
evidence, for clues Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   "The U.S. government has assured us they are doing everything they can
to effect Danny's rescue," Goldstein said.</TE>
<TE>   Pearl, 38, was born in Princeton, N. J., and is a graduate of Stanford
University. He has reported full-time for the Journal since 1990 from
Atlanta, Washington, London and Bombay, India. His wife, who was
traveling with him in Pakistan, is pregnant with their first child.</TE>
<TE>   Eight European journalists were killed in Afghanistan in November.
Five foreign journalists have been reported arrested or detained, but all
were released.</TE>
<TE>   The four-paragraph e-mail to The Times and other news organizations
has "American CIA officer in our custody" in the subject line, and the
text has several misspellings and grammatical errors. The message
apparently is repeated in a separate attachment in Urdu, the language of
southern Pakistan.</TE>
<TE>   Announcing that Pearl has been "captured," the e-mail adds,
"Unfortunately, he is at present being kept in very inhuman circumstances
quite similar infact to the way that Pakistanis and nationals of other
sovereign countries are being kept in Cuba by the American Army. If the
Americans keep our countrymen in better conditions we will better the
conditions of Mr. Pearl and all the other Americans that we capture."</TE>
<TE>   To obtain Pearl's release, the e-mail states, "all Pakistanis being
illegally detained by the FBI in side America merely on suspicion must be
given access to lawyers and allowed seeing their family members."</TE>
<TE>   The e-mail also demands that "the Pakistani prisoners in Cuba must be
returned to Pakistan and they will be tried in a Pakistani Court. After
all Pakistan was a full member of the international coalition against
terror and it deserves the right to try its own citizens."</TE>
<TE>   The message adds a final demand to "send Afghanistan's Embassador
Mulla Zaeef back to Pakistan and if there is any accusition Pakistani
Government should handle it."</TE>
<TE>   Abdul Salam Zaeef, the Taliban's former ambassador to Pakistan and its
most recognized spokesman, was deported from Pakistan to Afghanistan in
early January and handed over to U.S. forces there. The Pakistani
government had refused Zaeef's appeal for political asylum. He is now one
of the highest-ranking Taliban officials in U.S. custody.</TE>
<TE>   Goldstein, the Journal spokesman, said another news organization had
forwarded the e-mail to the Journal.</TE>
<TE>   "We have not had any direct contact" with the kidnappers, he said. He
said the photographs appeared authentic. "We're moving under the
assumption that they are real," he said.</TE>
<TE>   On a visit Sunday to the makeshift prison at Guantanamo Bay, where 158
men from Pakistan and 24 other nations are in custody, U.S. Defense
Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld rejected allegations that the prisoners have
been mistreated.</TE>
<TE>   "I have absolutely full confidence in the way the detainees are being
handled and treated," Rumsfeld said. He called the inmates, who have not
been charged or tried, "among the most dangerous, best trained, vicious
killers on the face of the Earth."</TE>
<TE>   Rumsfeld also ruled out the possibility of granting the detainees
prisoner-of-war status.</TE>
<TE>   "They are not POWs," he told the Associated Press and representatives
of other news organizations who accompanied him on his first trip to the
facility. "They will not be determined to be POWs."</TE>
<TE>   Secretary of State Colin L. Powell has asked the White House to
consider giving the prisoners the protections and treatment guaranteed
under the Geneva Conventions, which govern treatment of POWs and other
wartime captives. The issue was expected to be on the agenda today at a
meeting of the National Security Council, which President Bush was
expected to attend.</TE>
<TE>   Rumsfeld said he had come to the base to thank the U.S. troops
guarding the Taliban and Al Qaeda suspects, who were flown to Cuba from
detention facilities in Afghanistan. He was accompanied by Gen. Richard
B. Myers, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, and four senators,
including Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.).</TE>

<HD>Palestinian Kills Israeli and Herself With Bomb</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARY CURTIUS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM
</DL>
<LD>For the first time in nearly 16 months of conflict, a Palestinian
woman apparently carried out a suicide bombing Sunday, killing herself
and an 81-year-old Israeli man in a blast that ripped through the heart
of commercial Jerusalem at midday.</LD>
<LD>   Israeli police said more than 100 people were wounded in the attack,
which occurred outside a shoe store on a busy stretch of Jaffa Street
that has been targeted repeatedly.</LD>
<LD>   Jerusalem Mayor Ehud Olmert, who has seen the center of this city turn
into a ghost town during the bloody fighting with the Palestinians, gave
a statement to Israel Radio that offered little comfort to an
increasingly shellshocked public.</LD>
<TE>   "We are in the middle of a war, which will not end soon, and there
will be more victims," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The Palestinian Authority immediately condemned the bombing. The
television station of the radical Lebanese Islamic movement Hezbollah
identified the bomber as a female student from An Najah University in the
West Bank city of Nablus. But an Israeli police spokesman said Sunday
night that the woman had not been identified and that investigators were
not certain that she had intended to blow herself up in the blast.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli commentators noted that if a woman had indeed carried out a
suicide assault, it would change security operations here. Until now,
Palestinian women, who rarely mount any sort of attack, have been left
relatively undisturbed at checkpoints and by police patrols and other
security operations.</TE>
<TE>   Israel held Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat responsible
for the bombing. Government officials accused the Palestinian leader of
inciting such attacks, and they promised swift retaliation.</TE>
<TE>   The explosion shattered storefronts, knocked down shoppers and sent a
thick plume of black smoke into the air just a few yards from where a
Palestinian gunman opened fire on crowds last week, killing two women and
injuring more than a dozen people before police shot him to death.</TE>
<TE>   Among Sunday's wounded, police commissioner Shlomo Aharonishki said,
were policemen on foot patrol who were standing close to the bomber when
the blast occurred. By nightfall, police said the number of injured was
150, but most of those had sought treatment for shock or superficial
shrapnel wounds. Three of the victims were reportedly in serious
condition, and nine others were moderately wounded.</TE>
<TE>   The bomb exploded across the street from the Sbarro pizzeria where a
suicide bomber killed himself and 15 other people, including several
children, in August.</TE>
<TE>   Doctors from Bikur Cholim Hospital, less than a block away, ran from
the hospital to the scene when they heard the blast and began treating
victims in the street.</TE>
<TE>   Stunned and bloodied pedestrians--some weeping uncontrollably--picked
their way through mounds of glass and twisted steel. One woman,
apparently uninjured, fainted on the sidewalk a block from the blast. A
man muttered to no one in particular: "They will kill us one by one,
until they finish us all."</TE>
<TE>   Strangely silent crowds gathered behind hastily erected police crime
scene tape, watching as a long line of ambulances ferried the wounded to
nearby hospitals.</TE>
<TE>   "Why aren't you screaming 'Death to the Arabs?' " an angry young woman
asked a cluster of onlookers. No one bothered to reply.</TE>
<TE>   "Jerusalemites do not cry out anymore," said a grim-faced woman
wearing a long skirt and boots, who declined to give her name. "They've
just gotten used to walking the street and being blown up."</TE>
<TE>   Later Sunday, Mayor Olmert met with Prime Minister Ariel Sharon to ask
for more security and economic assistance for downtown merchants.</TE>
<TE>   A few miles from the carnage, Sharon and his Cabinet were nearing the
end of their weekly session as the attack took place. Ministers had
discussed the government's response to the Jan. 17 attack on a party hall
in Hadera in which six people and the gunman who sprayed their
celebration with automatic weapons fire died.</TE>
<TE>   The Cabinet issued a statement saying it would react to Sunday's
bombing in keeping with previous Security Cabinet decisions.</TE>
<TE>   The government decided months ago to respond to every attack on
Israelis. Since then, it has repeatedly targeted Palestinian security
installations and Arafat's symbols of power. It has moved tanks into the
West Bank city of Ramallah, where Arafat has been put under virtual house
arrest, and has blown up his helicopters.</TE>
<TE>   The government's resolve to keep chiseling away at Arafat's
infrastructure was strengthened over the weekend by statements from
President Bush and other senior U.S. officials. They said publicly that
they were disappointed with Arafat for failing to rein in militants and
for apparently purchasing 50 tons of weapons from Iran and trying to
smuggle them into the Gaza Strip in a ship Israel intercepted.</TE>
<TE>   Sunday's suicide bombing "raises serious questions about whether Mr.
Arafat is in fact really interested in moving forward with the peace
process," Vice President Dick Cheney told "Fox News Sunday."</TE>
<TE>   Sharon welcomed Bush's decision to keep U.S. special envoy Anthony C.
Zinni out of the region for the time being. Zinni, a retired Marine Corps
general, has been trying to secure a cease-fire in the
Israeli-Palestinian fighting, which has claimed more than 1,000 lives,
most of them Palestinian.</TE>
<TE>   But the two sides seem far closer to all-out combat than to a
cease-fire. Israel is vowing to dismantle what it calls the terrorist
infrastructure in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Palestinian officials are
warning that the Bush administration could trigger more violence if it
imposes sanctions on the Palestinian Authority and Arafat.</TE>
<TE>   On Jaffa Street, where the bombing took place, Tamar Cohen, 61, was
still shaking with fright nearly an hour after the attack. Cohen, a clerk
at Maayan Stub, a clothing store at the corner of Jaffa and King George
streets, said it was the second time in less than a week that she had
feared she would be killed.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, she, her co-workers and their customers froze in horror
when they heard the sound of automatic weapons fire on the street, she
said.</TE>
<TE>   "We heard the shooting--it sounded like a machine gun," Cohen said. "I
stood here, and I didn't know what to do. I thought he would come in the
store and kill us."</TE>
<TE>   On Sunday, Cohen said, she heard and felt the blast, then saw a cloud
of dust and smoke envelop the street outside the store's glass door. She
and the other clerks and customers--20 people in all--fled to an inside
room.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody started crying. Everyone was trembling," she said. When
they finally ventured back to the front of the store, "we saw them taking
away the wounded."</TE>
<TE>   For more than 26 years, Cohen said, she has worked at Maayan Stub, one
of downtown Jerusalem's oldest retail clothing stores. She said she has
never lived through such terrifying times.</TE>
<TE>   "This is something horrible," she said. "I don't know what will be.
Every day I think that they [terrorists] will come here, and we will be
finished. But what can we do?"</TE>

<KH></KH>
<HD>Convictions for Enron Execs Would Be Hard Won</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC LICHTBLAU</AU>
<AU>DAVID G. SAVAGE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Although Enron Corp. may have destroyed thousands of documents,
misled shareholders and left the retirement accounts of many of its
employees nearly worthless, legal experts say the prospect of serious
criminal convictions of corporate executives is far from certain.</LD>
<LD>   Despite some recent success in corporate fraud cases, prosecutors must
overcome daunting hurdles, including changes in federal regulation of
insider trading, the vagaries of securities law and the sometimes
conflicting agenda of congressional investigators, according to law
professors, attorneys who specialize in white-collar crime and law
enforcement officials.</LD>
<LD>   Evidence that Enron destroyed documents related to the company's
meteoric collapse offers the most compelling prospect for a criminal
case, suggesting possible obstruction of justice charges, legal experts
and law enforcement officials agree.</LD>
<TE>   But it could take years for authorities to build more serious charges
of conspiracy, insider trading or securities fraud against Enron's
higher-ups, and even then it may prove tough to return convictions,
experts predicted.</TE>
<TE>   "Financial fraud cases are very hard to prove. [Executives] can say
they made bad business judgments, but you have to prove unanimously and
beyond a reasonable doubt that they deliberately intended to deceive" the
public and their shareholders about the company's finances, said Columbia
University law professor Jeffrey N. Gordon.</TE>
<TE>   Even as FBI investigators began descending on Enron's Houston
headquarters last week to probe possible crimes, they probably will
confront several legal and political realities that could work to Enron's
advantage. Among the potential roadblocks:</TE>
<TE>   * The entire U.S. attorney's office in Houston has pulled out of the
investigation because too many prosecutors are related to Enron
employees, forcing the Justice Department to create a special task force
that must start from scratch in probing the energy company's labyrinth of
partnerships.</TE>
<TE>   * Democrats already have called for an independent counsel to probe
Enron's well-documented political connections to the Bush administration,
but the demise of the outside counsel law in 1999 has muddied the process
for determining how and when to appoint an outside counsel.</TE>
<TE>   * A recent rule change at the Securities and Exchange Commission,
authorizing prearranged sell-offs of executives' stock, gives added
insulation to allegations of insider trading and could provide former
Enron Chairman and Chief Executive Kenneth L. Lay and other executives
with a built-in defense.</TE>
<TE>   * And Congress' zeal to conduct high-profile hearings on Enron could
complicate the use of testimony from witnesses who become part of the
criminal probe, as happened in the Iran-Contra scandal. In that case,
charges against Oliver L. North and John M. Poindexter were thrown out in
1990 because their prosecutions were deemed tainted by immunized
congressional testimony.</TE>
<TE>Coordinating Immunity Offers</TE>
<TE>   Justice Department officials have begun discussions with Congress on
how to coordinate immunity offers that Congress might make to witnesses,
such as David B. Duncan, the partner at accounting firm Andersen who
oversaw the Enron account. Duncan, who since has been fired, invoked the
5th Amendment last week before a congressional committee rather than
answer questions about the destruction of Enron documents.</TE>
<TE>   The department hopes to blunt the effect that any congressional
immunity deals would have on future criminal cases.</TE>
<TE>   "We never like to see potential witnesses paraded before Congress, but
that's always a danger in a case like this," acknowledged a law
enforcement official who asked not to be identified.</TE>
<TE>   Enron spokesman Eric Thode said it would be premature to discuss any
criminal allegations, noting: "We'll just let the investigations take
their course, and, of course, we're cooperating fully."</TE>
<TE>   Despite the obstacles that prosecutors face, authorities are buoyed by
the recent progress they have made in several other high-profile
financial fraud cases.</TE>
<TE>   In Pennsylvania, the former chief financial officer of apparel maker
Leslie Fay Cos. was sentenced last week to nine years in prison for
inflating the company's earnings by $81 million. The scheme forced the
company into Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection for four years.</TE>
<TE>   In San Francisco, former executives at health services giant McKesson
Corp., are facing civil and criminal charges for allegedly concocting
bogus revenue figures. The losses for the company's shareholders: $9
billion.</TE>
<TE>   And in New Jersey, in a case with even more telltale similarities to
Enron, the former chairman and vice chairman of Cendant Corp.--a
franchiser whose brands include Howard Johnson, Avis and Century 21--are
awaiting trial on charges of conspiracy and securities fraud.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities allege that Cendant, in perhaps the longest-running scheme
of its kind, was "cooking the books" for more than a decade, with former
Chairman Walter A. Forbes reaping $30 million as the company's stock
soared amid misleading financial reports.</TE>
<TE>   Once irregularities in the company's accounting were exposed in 1998,
the value of Cendant's stock plunged $14 billion in a single day.</TE>
<TE>   Cendant and accounting giant Ernst &amp; Young, accused of whitewashing
the irregularities, agreed last year to pay a near-record total of $3.2
billion to shareholders who claimed they were defrauded by the scheme.</TE>
<TE>   But Forbes and former Vice Chairman E. Kirk Shelton, who have declared
their innocence in the affair, are not expected to go to trial until late
this year, about 4 1/2 years after the scandal first broke. That arduous
legal path is testament to the difficulty of bringing such complex
financial fraud cases, law enforcement officials say.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a brutally hard case," said one official close to the Cendant
prosecution. "It takes a special accounting knowledge, it's an incredible
paper trail, and you have to have cooperators. We had [three] people
pleading guilty, all the ones just below the top. . . . Without them, it
would be a much more formidable task" to prosecute the company's top
executives.</TE>
<TE>   Reports of widespread shredding of Enron documents give authorities
substantial leverage to try to persuade witnesses to cooperate, experts
said.</TE>
<TE>   "As a prosecutor, you are looking for evidence that the senior people
had knowledge of the scheme," said San Francisco attorney Stephen
Meagher, a former prosecutor of white-collar crime cases.</TE>
<TE>   "And typically, when you find documents were being destroyed, that
answers the question. That means certain people were aware of problems
and they were determined to destroy the evidence. It's the prosecutor's
dream come true because it shifts the burden to the other side. They have
to explain what they were trying to hide."</TE>
<TE>   Duncan, the Andersen auditor, has spoken with federal investigators at
least twice, a sign that he may be willing to cooperate in exchange for a
plea deal.</TE>
<TE>   It remains to be seen whether Duncan or someone at Enron turns out to
be the star witness prosecutors are seeking. But Columbia Law School
professor John C. Coffee, a securities specialist, noted that
"historically in white-collar crime cases, you have a trail of falling
dominoes, and you start low and offer leniency to cooperate and get
evidence against the higher-ups. I think you're going to get a whole
succession of people cutting deals here."</TE>
<TE>   The danger, however, is that such witnesses have a potential
credibility problem: If they admit to destroying documents, will a jury
believe their testimony fingering higher executives?</TE>
<TE>   "Those aren't necessarily the most credible witnesses on the stand,"
said Paul Fishman, a former Justice Department official who specializes
in white-collar defense.</TE>
<TE>Sending a Strong Message</TE>
<TE>   Beyond the obstruction issue, law enforcement officials say possible
charges against executives at Enron and Andersen could include securities
fraud, insider trading, wire and mail fraud, conspiracy and even
racketeering.</TE>
<TE>   The case, if it can be proved, would hinge on a simple premise: that
executives fooled the public and its shareholders into thinking the
company was more profitable than it was--and enriched themselves in the
process as the company's stock went up in value.</TE>
<TE>   The corporation itself faces possible indictment and criminal
penalties, but legal observers said anything short of indicting top Enron
executives could be seen as a failure in the eyes of the public.</TE>
<TE>   "Indicting a bankrupt company achieves next to nothing," Coffee said.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, Duke University law professor James D. Cox said indicting
Enron executives would send a strong message.</TE>
<TE>   "If they are serious about eliminating financial fraud, this is the
battle the government needs to take on," he said. "This looks to be a
case of purposeful manipulation of earnings and purposeful concealment of
debt. They created a truly false facade."</TE>
<TE>   Class-action lawsuits against Enron maintain that Lay made more than
$100 million from stock sales before the company's value plummeted. But
Lay's lawyers have maintained that many sales were from prearranged
sell-offs, which could give him insulation under a rule adopted by the
SEC in 2000 regarding what constitutes insider trading.</TE>
<TE>   The so-called 10b5-1 rule holds that even if insiders possess
sensitive corporate information, they can legally buy and sell company
stock so long as it is part of a prearranged trading plan. The SEC and
various courts have wrangled over how the new rule should be interpreted,
and allegations of insider trading against Lay and other Enron executives
could prove "a key test," said Jill Fisch, a corporate and securities law
expert at Fordham Law School.</TE>
<TE>   Fisch compared the Enron probe to the financial scandal that led to
the conviction of former junk bond kingpin Michael Milken and other Wall
Street traders in the 1980s.</TE>
<TE>   As in the Milken case, Fisch said, she believes Enron is "an impure
case on a lot of legal questions." But, she added, the public
backlash--fueled by headlines about document shredding--may be enough to
drive the investigation in the absence of clear law.</TE>

<HD>Cheney Defends Refusal to Detail Energy Meetings</HD>
<DH>Politics: Congress' investigative arm is prepared to go to court
over the issue. Vice president says the White House has handled the Enron
collapse properly.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JANET HOOK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Faced with growing legal and political challenges, Vice President
Dick Cheney stepped forward Sunday to vigorously defend the
administration's handling of the collapse of Enron Corp.--and his own
refusal to release details of his meetings with Enron and other industry
executives in formulating the Bush administration's energy policy.</LD>
<LD>   Cheney's defiance puts the administration on course for a legal clash
with Congress' investigative arm, the nonpartisan General Accounting
Office. The head of the GAO said last week that he would sue the
administration unless, by the end of this week, the agency is on track to
find out whom Cheney consulted before drafting the energy policy last
spring.</LD>
<LD>   "In the absence of that, the courts will have to decide," Comptroller
General David Walker said Sunday in an interview.</LD>
<TE>   Cheney dug in for the legal battle even as some fellow Republicans
have argued that he should release the information to counter the
potentially damaging impression that the administration has something to
hide.</TE>
<TE>   But releasing the information would set a precedent that would make it
impossible for him to receive "unvarnished advice" without fear of
disclosure by Congress, Cheney said.</TE>
<TE>   "What's really at stake here is the ability of the president and the
vice president to solicit advice from anybody they want in confidence,"
Cheney said on "Fox News Sunday."</TE>
<TE>   Those comments came during one of two wide-ranging television
interviews Cheney granted Sunday--part of a recent spate of appearances
that contrast with his relatively low profile after the Sept. 11
terrorist attacks. He has spent considerable time in a "secure location,"
and Cheney said Sunday that security considerations still dictate some of
his movements.</TE>
<TE>   "We still like to avoid being predictable, in terms of the president
and me being in the same place at the same time," Cheney said on ABC's
"This Week." Cheney's comments came at a crucial juncture for the
administration, on the eve of Bush's first State of the Union address to
Congress. Bush's popularity remains sky-high, as it has been since Sept.
11.</TE>
<TE>   But polls are beginning to show signs that the controversy surrounding
the collapse of what had been the seventh-largest U.S. corporation could
take a political toll on the GOP. A new poll by CBS and the New York
Times found that 45% of those surveyed believed that Enron had closer
ties to the Republican Party than to the Democrats, and more than half
said the Bush administration was either hiding something or lying about
Enron.</TE>
<TE>   Several congressional committees, the Justice Department and the
Securities and Exchange Commission are investigating whether any laws
were broken as Houston-based Enron disintegrated and filed for bankruptcy
protection last year.</TE>
<TE>   Some Republicans in Congress--including Rep. W.J. "Billy" Tauzin
(R-La.), chairman of a House committee that is investigating Enron--want
the administration to cut its political losses and release information
that officials believe will not be especially damning.</TE>
<TE>   "They seem to be dug in, but from Chairman Tauzin's perspective, his
recommendation is: Get the information out," said Ken Johnson, Tauzin's
spokesman. "The quicker the administration moves to defuse the growing
tension, the better off they will be in the long run."</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Fred Thompson (R-Tenn.) also has urged full disclosure, even
though he sympathizes with the administration's legal argument.</TE>
<TE>   "Unfortunately, it's not just a legal question," Thompson said earlier
this month in a television interview. "It's a policy question, and it's a
political question."</TE>
<TE>   The GAO has for months been seeking details about whom Cheney's energy
task force consulted before issuing its report, which included many
provisions favored by the energy industry to expand production. Rep.
Henry A. Waxman (D-Los Angeles) and other Democrats argue that the policy
was heavily influenced by big energy corporations at the expense of
environmental interests.</TE>
<TE>   The GAO was prepared to go to court over the issue last fall, Walker
said, but the agency put the suit on hold after the terrorist attacks.
The issue resurfaced in recent weeks, fueled by concern about Enron's
political influence, and congressional Democrats urged the GAO to take
legal action.</TE>
<TE>   Democrats contend that continued resistance by the administration will
redound to Bush's political disadvantage.</TE>
<TE>   "In the aftermath of the Enron scandal and collapse, I think people
are going to start to ask, 'What are they hiding?' " Sen. Joseph I.
Lieberman (D-Conn.) said Sunday on CNN's "Late Edition." "This decision
is a big mistake by the Bush administration."</TE>
<TE>   White House Chief of Staff Andrew H. Card Jr., speaking on NBC's "Meet
the Press," signaled a chance that a compromise could be worked out to
avoid a suit.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll talk with people," he said. "There are probably ways to address
some of the concerns on information, but it's very important that the
president and vice president have the ability to get information that
they need."</TE>
<TE>   But Cheney was far less conciliatory, casting the dispute as part of a
broad administration effort to shore up presidential power after decades
of congressional encroachment on such matters as war-making and budget
authority.</TE>
<TE>   "Time after time after time, administrations have traded away the
authority of the president to do his job," Cheney said on "Fox News
Sunday." "We're not going to do that in this administration."</TE>
<TE>   Cheney said the demand for more information was a partisan "fishing
expedition" by Democrats who opposed, but failed to block, passage of the
administration's energy bill in the House.</TE>
<TE>   He argued that the administration's handling of Enron's troubles was
completely proper. Although there were provisions of the energy plan that
Enron supported, Cheney said, nothing was done specifically at the
company's behest.</TE>
<TE>   "Now the fact is Enron didn't get any special deals," he said.
"Enron's been treated appropriately by this administration. . . . There
is no evidence to indicate anybody did anything wrong in the
administration."</TE>
<TE>   The best way to respond to the Enron collapse is not political finger
pointing, he said, but focusing on what needs to be done to reform laws
and regulations on pensions. Many Enron employees experienced
catastrophic losses in their 401(k) retirement accounts, which were
largely invested in company stock.</TE>
<TE>   The stock plummeted last fall after Enron disclosed the existence of
several complex, off-balance-sheet partnerships and restated earnings to
account for more than $600 million in previously unreported losses, and
the company filed for bankruptcy protection Dec. 2.</TE>
<TE>   But Cheney shied away from endorsing proposals to limit the amount of
company stock in retirement savings plans, saying Congress should not
undercut the trend toward encouraging employees to own stock.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to be careful not to throw the baby out with the bathwater,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   In comments on other topics in the interviews, Cheney:</TE>
<TE>   * Said he believed that the economy is beginning to recover but that
the administration still wants Congress to enact legislation to stimulate
the economy. "The question is how fast it will recover, and there are
still some doubts out there," he said.</TE>
<TE>   * Harshly criticized Yasser Arafat, questioning his commitment to the
peace process and saying the U.S. special Mideast envoy, Anthony Zinni,
would not return to the region until Arafat does more to control violence
against Israel.</TE>
<TE>   * Declined to say whether President Bush would sign campaign finance
legislation that will be considered in the House--over the objection of
House GOP leaders--in the coming month or so. He said that Bush would
have to study the final version but that "the president would like to
sign a bill."</TE>

<HD>Talking Yourself Into a Job</HD>
<DH>County classes accent the positive for welfare recipients who face
deadlines to get off aid at a hard time for job-seekers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NICHOLAS RICCARDI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>What would 13 mothers trying to get off welfare do with $1 million
each?</LD>
<LD>   The women jot down their fantasies in government-issued assignment
books, under the enthusiastic eye of their instructor, Grace Mapp.</LD>
<LD>   Cathy Lopez, 32, of Whittier dreams of a three-bedroom house--plus
college money for her two kids, a vacation home in Puerto Vallarta and a
boat.</LD>
<TE>   Lopez has never worked before. In truth, she says, she would be happy
with a job that just pays more than minimum wage.</TE>
<TE>   Mapp, who sports a button proclaiming, "I'm allergic to negative
people," will have none of that. "We may have to work the two jobs right
now to save up the down payment for the car and the down payment for the
house," she says, "but we won't have to do that forever."</TE>
<TE>   In their efforts to push welfare recipients into the work force,
government officials such as Mapp are borrowing techniques and language
from the world of late-night infomercials. The aim is to build
self-esteem among the downtrodden, a goal that proponents see as
innovative but that critics say can become soft-headed.</TE>
<TE>   In Los Angeles County, thousands of enrollees in welfare-to-work
programs attend a series of lectures and workshops intended to give aid
recipients the confidence needed to impress a recruiter.</TE>
<TE>   The tools range from tutorials on job etiquette to aromatherapy and
guidebooks to success written by the author of the best-selling "Chicken
Soup for the Soul." Those who need what is known as "Enhanced Motivation"
can expect a steady diet of the Bobby McFerrin song "Don't Worry, Be
Happy."</TE>
<TE>   For welfare recipients, these are hard times to be happy. The
five-year time limits imposed on aid under the 1996 law kick in next year
in many states. The economy is sluggish, and unemployment has jumped to
its highest point in years.</TE>
<TE>   As if that were not enough, the Los Angeles County workers whose job
is to accentuate the positive may find their own jobs shuffled off to
private contractors. County supervisors are scheduled to decide Tuesday
whether to hire a corporation that promises to motivate the jobless for
less taxpayer money.</TE>
<TE>   So after a hard day of reassuring people who have never held steady
jobs that the workplace is not that scary, the men and women in the
county Office of Education polish their own resumes and calculate whether
they have enough seniority to avoid the ax.</TE>
<TE>   "This is our time to practice what we preach," says job developer
Noemi Uribe.</TE>
<TE>Positive Attitude Not Always Contagious</TE>
<TE>   The county does most of its welfare-to-work motivating at a
nondescript building in Downey.</TE>
<TE>   Bright-colored posters cover the walls. "Be the change you're trying
to create," one demands, quoting Mohandas K. Gandhi. Another arrays its
words in a circle: "A job"; "A better job"; "A career."</TE>
<TE>   Seemingly every surface--from the room dividers to the pencil-holders
on work tables--is festooned with uplifting stickers and cheerful
drawings of leaves and flowers. Instructors sometimes break out
lavender-scented candles to soothe stressed students.</TE>
<TE>   But the surroundings don't relax Whittier resident Veronica Maytorena,
26.</TE>
<TE>   It's the second day of "Job Club," a four-week program in which
welfare recipients learn the do's and don'ts of the workplace while they
search for employment. Reluctant to speak of her experiences, Maytorena
nevertheless finds something negative at every turn.</TE>
<TE>   First, she complains, job applications always ask whether the
applicant has a criminal record. "Everybody makes mistakes," Maytorena
says. "Sometimes you want to start over."</TE>
<TE>   Instructor Nancy Kim replies that some companies give convicts a
chance; one of her former students, a convicted felon, is now earning $12
an hour at Vons.</TE>
<TE>   Next, Maytorena frets about how one can take a sick child to the
doctor while working.</TE>
<TE>   "It seems like you have to choose--money or happiness, or your kids,"
she says. "Should we regret our kids?"</TE>
<TE>   The two dozen other people in the class cry out: "No!"</TE>
<TE>   "You may feel bad, and you may want to spend that quality time with
them," a woman chips in, "but you're getting them a better life."</TE>
<TE>   "You're buying their love," Maytorena shoots back.</TE>
<TE>   Then she reveals what has been fueling her anxiety--she was in foster
care and is terrified of leaving her children with anyone else. "I'm
scared the things that happened to me will happen to my kids," she says.</TE>
<TE>   "Hopefully it won't," Kim begins, talking about child care centers
across the county.</TE>
<TE>   The class breaks without resolving Maytorena's fears.</TE>
<TE>   Children are at the heart of almost every discussion in the Office of
Education's welfare-to-work program. In the fantasy exercise that opens
the curriculum, aid recipients often dream of being able to put their
kids through college. During Job Club, parents learn how to tell
employers they need time off to help their kids.</TE>
<TE>   In the "Enhanced Motivation" workshop--a voluntary weeklong bout of
optimism for those who cannot land work--instructor Elizabeth
Kennedy-Lewis asks her four students to write down ways they build their
children's self-esteem, then turn those techniques on themselves.</TE>
<TE>   Kennedy-Lewis, whose previous job was motivating people on workers'
compensation, says she savors the challenges of trying to cheer up
welfare recipients.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of it is pumping them up," says Kennedy-Lewis, who plays 1980s
pop tunes--including the optimist's anthem "Don't Worry, Be Happy" on a
portable stereo in her class.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the women--and it is mostly women--who come to her turn out to
be battered wives, or drug abusers, and are referred to special mental
health counselors.</TE>
<TE>   "Some things I hear, I'm just floored," she says. "I could never be in
those shoes."</TE>
<TE>   Others simply have no transportation, no work experience, no family
support structure. Those, Kennedy-Lewis says, she can try to help.</TE>
<TE>   "Most of the time they're lost and don't know where to go until you
push them," she says.</TE>
<TE>Some Experts Prefer 'Tough Love' Approach</TE>
<TE>   Not everyone thinks that welfare recipients need bucking up.</TE>
<TE>   "The average welfare recipient needs to be motivated, [but] the
motivation needs to be firmer than just 'I love you, I want you to
succeed,' " said Doug Besharov, the Joe Jacobs Scholar in Social Welfare
Policy at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank in
Washington.</TE>
<TE>   Besharov added that programs must take a "tough love" stance and cited
research that one program in Washington state was so welcoming that women
moving through it were less likely to get off welfare because they did
not want to leave.</TE>
<TE>   "Some of these programs that are really successful mirror the world
that the rest of us live in," Besharov said. "The ones that don't can be
insulting."</TE>
<TE>   Other researchers say broad-based motivational programs serve a
purpose.</TE>
<TE>   "I talk about some of these people as being borderline agoraphobic,"
said Jacob Klareman, director of the Rand Center for the Study of Welfare
Policy in Santa Monica. "They're scared of going out into the world of
work. . . . These programs are intended to help people get over that
fear, and the evidence is solid that people who go through these basic
motivation programs are more likely to get jobs and higher earnings."</TE>
<TE>   LaDonna Pavetti, a senior fellow with the Mathematica Police Institute
in Washington, recalled one job-hunting program in which all the
participants would gather and applaud every time a welfare recipient
landed a job. Pavetti said one woman, who had just found work, broke down
in tears.</TE>
<TE>   "You know, for a lot of these women, they've never gotten that sort of
attention," Pavetti said.</TE>
<TE>   Maximus, a Virginia-based company that runs welfare-to-work operations
in 35 cities, counties and states, rings a bell whenever one of its aid
recipients lands a job.</TE>
<TE>   "It does wonders," said Akbar Piloti, president of the company's
Workforce Services Division. "It's very touching."</TE>
<TE>   In San Diego, Maximus contracts with a local day spa where clients can
get make-overs before job interviews.</TE>
<TE>   "It's all services that make a big difference in the morale of the
job-seeker," spokeswoman Rachael Rowland said.</TE>
<TE>   Maximus is the company poised to take over most of Los Angeles'
welfare-to-work motivation program. Last year the company won a contract
to run 40% of the county offices that process applications for welfare.
In May, Maximus won a bid for the motivational component, with the county
Office of Education coming in second. But county supervisors have yet to
vote on the contract. The union that represents county employees is
fighting to derail the effort.</TE>
<TE>   Maximus is fighting back. Last year, it gave $25,000 to a political
fund run by associates of Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky, the swing vote on
both their prior contract and the one under consideration.</TE>
<TE>'Chicken Soup' Writer's Materials Are Used</TE>
<TE>   When Los Angeles County became one of the first agencies in the nation
to set up a welfare-to-work program in 1988, it turned to Jack Canfield
to write the pep talk. County education officials recall chortling as
Canfield, who later wrote the "Chicken Soup for the Soul" books, maxed
out his credit card while finishing the book and, practicing what he
preached, got himself through the hard times by visualizing himself
cashing a $1-million check.</TE>
<TE>   Thirteen years later, the GOALS book and accompanying audio tapes are
still distributed at every welfare-to-work office in the county, in
classes like the one Grace Mapp leads in the city of Industry.</TE>
<TE>   There, the mothers sit at tables amid baskets of paper sunflowers.
Mapp leads them through the "10 Keys to Success," the hallmark of the
program. The first key is "Acknowledge the Positive Past."</TE>
<TE>   Mapp pushes the women to list successes in their lives--from learning
to read to opening their first bank account. She switches on a video in

<HD>Urban Spread Is Staining Greenery of Mexico City</HD>
<DH>Environment: Squatter settlements are chipping away at protected
zones. Officials hope measures will contain the damage.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MEXICO CITY
</DL>
<LD>At the end of the rutted road to San Miguel Xalpa, where squat
cement houses and soccer fields choked with dust give way to a lush
forest, Mexico City has flung up a "Green Wall."</LD>
<LD>   It's not much of an obstacle. It's not even a wall, this government
sign planted in the dirt, declaring itself the Muralla Verde and warning
would-be settlers to go no farther. They have ignored it, by the tens of
thousands, trooping into the woods to build primitive houses among the
100-year-old pines.</LD>
<LD>   The migration--some call it an invasion--has shaved trees from
hillsides like unwanted stubble. Wooden shanties sprout in their place
almost overnight, followed by roads, electric cables and water pipes.
Bricks and cinder blocks turn rickety shacks into permanent homes.</LD>
<TE>   Haphazard growth is nearly synonymous with Mexico City, whose immense
expansion from the 1960s to the 1980s has made it the world's
second-largest city and a virtual case study of urbanization run amok.
Now, less than five years after it began electing its own mayors, the
capital is seeking to contain the damage, an experiment that probably
will be closely watched by mega-cities from Rio de Janeiro to Cairo.</TE>
<TE>   Mexico City's squatter settlements are a particularly virulent form of
urban sprawl, driven by poverty, corruption and lax environmental
enforcement. Authorities in the Federal District, which is similar to the
District of Columbia, estimate that 65,000 illegal homes with as many as
260,000 people occupy forests and farmland designated as conservation
areas throughout the city's southern end. More than 5,000 families
settled in protected zones during the last year. The Green Wall itself is
now well within the conservation zones.</TE>
<TE>Squatters Adding to Environment Problems</TE>
<TE>   The creeping mancha urbana--urban stain--increases air pollution and
erosion as trees that once absorbed contaminants and anchored soil
vanish. More important, unfettered urbanization threatens the aquifers
beneath the forests and meadows, which provide 70% of Mexico City's
water.</TE>
<TE>   "It's probably the main environmental problem facing the city," said
Claudia Sheinbaum, the Federal District's environment minister. "This
region represents the main area where rainwater infiltrates the soil and
recharges the aquifer. The urbanization of the forests means less water."</TE>
<TE>   Unlikely as it may seem for a city notorious for searing pollution,
Mexico City remains one of the world's greenest metropolises. More than
half of the acreage in the Federal District, whose border matches that of
the city, is designated open space, and a full quarter is carpeted by
forests. More than 8 million people live in the district, mostly in dense
urban neighborhoods on the city's northern side, while 10 million more
live in the greater metropolitan area within the Valley of Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, the Federal District lost about 800 acres of green space to
urbanization, officials estimate, depriving the aquifers of 160 million
gallons of water. The city uses 300 billion gallons of water a year.</TE>
<TE>   Illegal logging and insect infestations also are chipping away at the
conservation areas.</TE>
<TE>   The Alamo family crossed the Green Wall a year ago, hauling corrugated
tin and composition board into a sun-flecked grove deep in the Magdalena
Contreras forest. The Alamos built a one-room home, decorating the walls
with flattened orange juice cartons and a crucifix. Iron skillets hang
from a rotting stump beside the door.</TE>
<TE>   Juan Alamo Perez, a stooped construction worker, moved his wife and
four young children into the forest after the family was evicted from its
apartment in San Bernabe, a poor neighborhood in the western area of the
city.</TE>
<TE>   "The rents were so high that we could not find an affordable
apartment," he said. Now the Alamos live for free, along with half a
dozen other families in their fledgling settlement, using electricity and
water pilfered from city systems through illegal hookups.</TE>
<TE>Families Live on Dreams of Suburbia</TE>
<TE>   But life is not easy in the mountains that cradle this ancient city.
None of the Alamo children attend school, and they catch cold easily in
the chilly weather. Their father struggles to hold a job, commuting each
day by hiking through the forest to a road and then catching a bus
downtown.</TE>
<TE>   A hundred yards away, on the other side of the Green Wall, the Alamos
can catch a glimpse of their potential future. That's where San Miguel
Xalpa, a 15-year-old settlement that began as a cluster of squatters'
shacks, has swelled into a suburb of about 3,000 people.</TE>
<TE>   Though still modest, the two-story brick and stucco homes offer an
array of comforts. Indoor plumbing is standard, and some houses feature
stained-glass windows and cable television. At one bright purple home, a
man could be seen on a recent afternoon hosing down his Plymouth Voyager
in his gated driveway, the picture of suburban domesticity.</TE>
<TE>   Like many such areas, San Miguel Xalpa has become "regularized," its
once-outlaw status legalized by the government. The system benefits just
about everyone, at least in the short term: Poor families find homes,
local politicians win votes by promising public services for the
shantytowns, and construction companies cater to homeowners.</TE>
<TE>   Wealthy people also sometimes build homes illegally in protected
areas, Sheinbaum said.</TE>
<TE>   For decades, government officials have looked the other way as
development seeped into the mountains. The development increased after an
earthquake struck the capital in 1985, killing thousands of people and
pushing hordes of residents out of the urban core.</TE>
<TE>   "Every hill in Mexico City is being invaded," said Homero Aridjis, a
prominent Mexican poet and head of the Group of 100 environmentalists.
"Supposedly this is protected territory, but there is no authority there.
We have this combination of protective policies and under-the-table
deals. Corrupt politicians induce invasions, and then they take a piece
of the cake for themselves and build their own houses. The landscape is
gray, the color of cement."</TE>
<TE>   Squatters also have set up camp in areas designated for agriculture.
In Xochimilco, an area known for its canals, many wetland plots earmarked
for horticulture are studded with illegal houses. Last year, the urban
stain grew 23% in the area--the greatest increase citywide--and local
authorities have been forced to provide portable toilets to the
newcomers.</TE>
<TE>   "Every week we discover more houses," said Patricia Perez Hernandez,
Xochimilco's subdirector of urban development. "On the one hand, the
government should not provide services for these people, because they are
illegally building on the land. But if we ignore them, the water gets
polluted."</TE>
<TE>   In Mexico, the problem of uncontrolled urbanization extends beyond the
capital, where population growth has slowed to about 3% a year. In areas
surrounding the city, squatter settlements have popped up even on the
fringes of middle-class towns. And in the coastal state of Guerrero,
thousands of poor people this month claimed a stretch of shoreline near
Acapulco. In a rare government crackdown, President Vicente Fox
dispatched a team of prosecutors that will seek to evict them.</TE>
<TE>   "The phenomenon is so widespread that it is almost impossible to
fight," said Victor Lichtinger, Fox's environment minister. "We will
choose to defend a few important areas where the environment is very
sensitive, but we need to prevent invasions before they happen, not
after."</TE>
<TE>   Because land takeovers often are led by political bosses shortly
before an election, Lichtinger said, electoral reform is a good place to
start. He suggests barring squatters from registering to vote in local
elections until they have lived in a spot for several years, thereby
killing the short-term incentive for politicians to organize invasions to
win votes.</TE>
<TE>Programs Designed to Halt the Sprawl</TE>
<TE>   In Mexico City, officials are trying a different approach. They have
tightened environmental laws, prohibiting new developments of more than
10 homes in some southern neighborhoods and sharply increasing the
penalties for illegal land use. The capital also has launched a program
to build 10,000 apartment units a year for settlers living in illegal
areas.</TE>
<TE>   The government also doled out $15 million last year to farmers, triple
the amount of previous years, in an attempt to shore up agricultural
production so that farmers won't sell their land to developers.</TE>
<TE>   For Maria Elia Lara Tenorio, a florist who grows 20 varieties of roses
on the banks of the Magdalena River, the subsidies have meant the
difference between sickly flowers and glorious blossoms. Last year, her
collective of seven women received a $40,000 government grant to renovate
their greenhouses. With improved insulation and irrigation, Lara's
flowers fetch five times the money they once did at market, she says.</TE>
<TE>   "We are much better off than we were a year ago," she said. "Many
people sell their land when they cannot profit from agriculture anymore,
regardless of how the land will be used. But now I wouldn't think of
selling it to anyone."</TE>
<TE>   Slowly, financial incentives and public education programs may take
root among the natural stewards of the land: the people who live there.</TE>
<TE>   "The forest is the source of human life," said Miguel Casas Albarran,
a white-haired peasant who has lived among the trees all his 75 years and
now works for a water conservation project. "If we don't take care of it,
we will all perish."</TE>

<HD>Russian Helicopter Crash Kills 14 in Chechnya</HD>
<DH>Europe: Rebels claim to have shot down aircraft, but Moscow is
unsure. Deputy interior minister is among fatalities.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN DANISZEWSKI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MOSCOW
</DL>
<LD>A Russian military helicopter with a deputy interior minister and
several other officers aboard exploded and crashed in Chechnya on Sunday,
killing all 14 passengers and crew, and first reports indicated that it
might have been downed in a rebel attack.</LD>
<LD>   Among those killed was Gen. Mikhail Rudchenko, the deputy interior
minister overseeing police forces in southern Russia, one of the
highest-ranking Russian officials to be killed in Chechnya since troops
reentered the separatist-minded republic in the fall of 1999 to impose
loyalty to Moscow.</LD>
<LD>   Citing the work of an investigative team on the ground, the Interfax
news agency said the midair explosion "most likely" was caused by a
missile. Meanwhile, the Kavkaz Center, an information service for the
Chechen rebels, claimed on its Web site that the rebels had scored a
direct hit with a Russian-made ground-to-air Igla rocket.</LD>
<TE>   "The Kremlin has been dealt another serious blow," the site boasted.</TE>
<TE>   However, all parties in the Chechen conflict routinely make
exaggerated claims, and Russian officials said they were still trying to
determine whether there could be a mechanical explanation for the crash.</TE>
<TE>   The helicopter, an Mi-8 transport, went down near Shelkovskaya,
northeast of the Chechen regional capital, Grozny, in late morning.
Witnesses said they saw an explosion before it fell.</TE>
<TE>   The aircraft had taken off from the main Russian military base at
Khankala, outside Grozny, and was flying to Mozdok, a town in the
neighboring republic of North Ossetia.</TE>
<TE>   "The exact reason for the explosion of the helicopter has not yet been
established," Maj. Gen. Sergei Babkin, head of the Federal Security
Service in Chechnya, was quoted as saying by Interfax. Aside from
Rudchenko, the victims included one other Interior Ministry general,
three colonels, crew members and bodyguards.</TE>
<TE>   Whether or not the crash was caused by hostile fire, analysts believed
that it would prove to be a psychological setback for the Russian side.</TE>
<TE>   "This is another serious reminder that the authorities should stop
pretending there is no war going on out there," said Alexander I. Zhilin,
a military analyst with the Moscow News weekly.</TE>
<TE>   "Russia is still waging a war in Chechnya, whatever they choose to
call it. And they must start doing something about it. Ignoring it and
letting it smolder on its own will not finish it in any foreseeable
future," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Zhilin said that the ongoing campaign, which has been stalemated for
most of the last two years, must be brought to a close either through
negotiations or by intensifying military activities. In his words,
thousands of Russian troops are sitting there "like sitting ducks without
any viable strategy."</TE>
<TE>   If the cause of Sunday's crash was a rebel attack, Zhilin speculated
that elements of Russia's own forces could have contributed to it by
selling information about the flight to the rebels.</TE>
<TE>   "There are lots of contract soldiers and junior officers out there who
have already been corrupted beyond recognition and can sell or do
anything for cash," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Zhilin was dubious that the explosion was accidental because, he said,
"[important] passengers like these are almost always offered flights on
the most reliable machines, with all safety procedures observed."</TE>
<TE>   Russian President Vladimir V. Putin likens the Chechen rebels to Al
Qaeda terrorists in Afghanistan and says they have direct links to Osama
bin Laden. He has taken a tough line on negotiations with the rebels,
saying their chief demand--independence--is out of the question.</TE>
<TE>   The only meeting in the current conflict between the Kremlin and a
rebel representative, in November at a Moscow airport, failed to produce
any concrete results.</TE>
<TE>   Russian officials have acknowledged about 3,000 deaths among the
country's troops in Chechnya since war resumed there in 1999, but there
are reports of additional deaths almost daily, mostly from gun battles
and land mine explosions.</TE>
<TE>   Human rights groups, meanwhile, accuse Russia of tolerating ongoing
abuses by its troops in Chechnya--including murders, torture, rapes and
robberies--as they carry out "sanitizing" operations to separate rebels
from the general population.</TE>
<TE>   Although criticism of Russia's Chechnya policy in the West became
somewhat muted after the Sept. 11 attacks in the United States, European
governments and the U.S. continue to urge Russia to seek a negotiated
solution with the ousted administration of Chechen President Aslan
Maskhadov.</TE>
<TE>   The United States drew Moscow's ire only Thursday by allowing a State
Department official to meet an envoy of Maskhadov's government in
Washington--a decision that Russia termed "an unfriendly step."</TE>

</DL>
<LD>Israel's first Arab Cabinet minister, whose nomination in March
raised hopes for rapprochement between the country's Jewish and Arab
citizens, resigned Sunday amid reports he would face corruption charges.</LD>
<LD>   Salah Tarif, a minister without portfolio from the moderate Labor
Party, is suspected of passing $5,000 from a Palestinian businessman who
was trying to obtain Israeli citizenship to a senior Interior Ministry
official, according to Israeli media reports.</LD>
<LD>   Tarif has emphatically denied the allegations since they surfaced last
year, but media reported last week that Atty. Gen. Elyakim Rubinstein was
preparing to remove Tarif's immunity so he could be indicted.
Rubinstein's office said a statement on the issue would be issued
shortly.</LD>
<TE>   "Sadly, the recent false reports and the attorney general's
determination to bring the libel against me to court prevent me from
continuing to contribute in matters that are important for all of us,"
Tarif wrote in the resignation letter he handed Prime Minister Ariel
Sharon on Sunday. The resignation takes effect Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   Tarif--who practices the Druze religion, an offshoot of Islam--was a
paratrooper before entering parliament. Sharon has not named a
replacement for him.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Forces Storm Kandahar Hospital</HD>
<DH>Military: Wounded Al Qaeda fighters have been holed up for nearly
two months. Meanwhile, identity of those killed in earlier raid is
disputed.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TYLER MARSHALL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>KANDAHAR, Afghanistan
</DL>
<LD>U.S. Special Forces launched a raid early today to end a seven-week
siege at this city's main hospital, where six wounded Al Qaeda Arab
fighters armed with explosives, grenades and small arms have been holed
up since early December.</LD>
<LD>   Witnesses said a large group of U.S. soldiers entered the grounds of
Kandahar's Mirwais hospital before dawn and were seen crouching in
trenches near the facility's main building. The witnesses said they then
heard two loud explosions followed by a prolonged exchange of small arms
fire. A third explosion was heard about two hours later.</LD>
<LD>   Helicopters assisted the operation, according to uniformed Afghans
supporting the raid.</LD>
<TE>   A U.S. Special Forces soldier guarding a hospital entrance road said
the facility was closed because of "an ongoing military operation."</TE>
<TE>   "There's an operation underway that's under the direction of the
governor of Kandahar," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "We're helping the local government facilitate with the non-Pushtun
population," added a second American, who wore a black sweater and orange
baseball cap. Two uniformed Afghans belonging to Gov. Gul Agha Shirzai's
militia were with the Americans.</TE>
<TE>   The hospital siege began early last month after nine severely wounded
Al Qaeda fighters were brought to the hospital. When anti-Taliban forces
tried to take the fighters prisoner, they found the Arabs had strapped
explosives to their bodies and were threatening to blow up themselves and
anyone who came near them.</TE>
<TE>   The result has been a tense standoff. U.S. forces, with the apparent
consent of the new local government, had reportedly ordered that the
Arabs be starved out, but that tactic came under criticism from the
International Committee of the Red Cross, and the fighters are believed
to have received some food from sympathetic hospital staff.</TE>
<TE>   Two of the Arabs had apparently managed to escape earlier. One fighter
killed himself after trying to escape.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, a group of Afghans from an area hit by U.S. Special Forces
last week claimed Sunday that the people captured and killed in the raid
were pro-government local residents, not hard-line Taliban holdouts as
described by the U.S. military.</TE>
<TE>   "They were not Taliban. None of them were Taliban," said Zainullah, a
member of the local village's governing shura, or council. "That's
impossible."</TE>
<TE>   After meeting with the delegation Sunday, a senior member of
Kandahar's provincial government, Mohammed Yusef Pushtoon, appeared to
agree with the villagers, describing the raid as a mistake. He told
reporters that the U.S. attack seemed to have concentrated on two
buildings that were not Taliban or Al Qaeda hide-outs but instead a local
government headquarters and a health clinic.</TE>
<TE>   Maj. Bill Harrison, a spokesman for the U.S. Central Command in Tampa,
Fla., said Sunday that the Pentagon was standing by its original
assessment that the compounds were legitimate military targets.</TE>

<HD>Customs Chief Survives Difficult Start</HD>
<DH>Security: The war on terrorism has dominated the brief tenure of
Robert C. Bonner. It also has changed his agency's mandate dramatically.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JONATHAN PETERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Robert C. Bonner had not even moved into his new office as head of
the U.S. Customs Service when the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks turned the
routine task of border control into an urgent national priority and
changed his job forever.</LD>
<LD>   The north tower of the World Trade Center collapsed on the Customs
Service's largest office complex outside of Washington, destroying the
eight-story building. (All 790 employees got out safely.) Customs
inspectors, meanwhile, were urgently needed at the U.S.-Canadian border.
And nobody knew what new threats might be coming by land, air or sea.</LD>
<LD>   "In a lot of ways, I started as the customs commissioner that day,"
said Bonner, 59, a former U.S. attorney, federal judge and private
attorney from Los Angeles. "To say I hit the ground running would be
somewhat of a gross understatement."</LD>
<TE>   The war on terrorism has had a fateful effect on customs, a venerable
federal agency that has long suffered from a shrinking mandate in an
increasingly global economy. Suddenly, its expertise, gained in
little-publicized battles against drug dealers and smugglers, is prized
again.</TE>
<TE>   The shadowy "hawala" system of financing favored by terrorists, for
example, has parallels with the black-market peso exchange used by South
American drug traffickers, said Bonner, who ran the Drug Enforcement
Administration in the early 1990s. A customs database on the mundane
topic of commodity shipments has pointed investigators toward possible
terrorist financing schemes involving money and diamonds.</TE>
<TE>   Customs even lent New York City 100 radiation detectors to help patrol
Times Square against terrorism on New Year's Eve.</TE>
<TE>   "They've got the expertise. What they've needed is the support," said
Jonathan M. Winer, a former State Department official and attorney in
Washington. "For the first time in many, many years, people are
recognizing the importance of having a strong and effective Customs
Service."</TE>
<TE>   In Bonner's brief tenure, the Customs Service has tried to become the
firewall blocking terrorists and their weapons from breaching U.S.
borders, an effort that is testing its resources to the limit but also
drawing upon experience gained in other struggles. Among its initiatives:</TE>
<TE>   * Operation Green Quest, a multi-agency task force led by customs, is
investigating terrorist funding sources, including charities, banks,
smuggling, counterfeiting and credit card fraud. The effort already has
led to a crackdown on Al Barakaat, a money-wiring network in Somalia
founded by an associate of terrorist mastermind Osama bin Laden, and
certain Islamic charities operating inside the United States.</TE>
<TE>   * Operation Shield America, in which customs has urged private firms
to blow the whistle if they are approached for suspicious purchases that
might help make weapons of mass destruction. Exports to be watched
include neutron generators that help trigger nuclear bombs and fermenting
equipment that helps produce biological weapons.</TE>
<TE>   * Operation Oasis, a little-publicized effort in which customs
inspectors have seized more than $8 million in undeclared cash that was
en route overseas and suspected of being intended for terrorists.</TE>
<TE>   * A "level one" alert at U.S. borders, prompting more rigorous
inspections of travelers--with unexpected results. Drug seizures plunged
immediately after Sept. 11 as drug traffickers initially declined to test
the border alert. But smuggling efforts quickly resumed, and customs drug
seizures skyrocketed. Inspectors seized more than a million pounds of
illegal drugs in the final four months of last year, a 28% jump from the
same period in 2000.</TE>
<TE>Shipping Containers Are Source of Concern</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials also are taking a hard look at America's harbors,
traditionally peaceful drop-off points for ocean containers that contain
almost half of U.S. imports.</TE>
<TE>   Before Sept. 11, a major concern at customs was how to streamline the
entry of those containers into the United States, reflecting the demands
of business for easy movement of goods and the over-arching political
sentiment that customs' red tape should not clog the machinery of the
global economy. Indeed, customs' original mission--collecting import
duties for an emerging republic--was shrinking in value as the United
States committed itself to a world of free trade.</TE>
<TE>   But the very containers that symbolize world trade have come to
represent a threat to peaceful commerce among nations. In October, for
example, Italian police discovered a suspected Al Qaeda operative inside
an ocean container equipped with a bed, toilet, satellite phone,
computer, camera, airport maps and airport security passes.</TE>
<TE>   "A nuke in a box," Bonner warned this month, "would bring the global
economy to its knees. . . . The shipping of sea containers would stop."</TE>
<TE>   A small percentage of the containers are examined once they arrive in
the U.S., and Bonner is proposing a system in which cargo ships have
their contents screened overseas before they reach U.S. waters. Customs
is also trying to devise a standard for electronic seals that could
signal any tampering with such shipments.</TE>
<TE>   "The reality is that the security in the megaports outside the United
States is far better than at ports in the U.S.," he said. "We just have
not paid attention to that issue. . . . I don't want to be thinking about
these things after they've happened."</TE>
<TE>   Bonner brings to the challenge a long resume of law enforcement
experience and a career that is not easily categorized. Outside the
office, he enjoys tennis and chess and works out on a treadmill. On the
job, he is known as somewhat aloof and cerebral but hard-driving in
pursuit of his aims.</TE>
<TE>   When he ran DEA, Bonner sought to impose what became known as the
"kingpin" strategy, pushing field officers to go after leaders of drug
organizations rather than foot soldiers. He also sought to revamp the
far-flung agency, demanding a more hands-on role for DEA headquarters.
"If you're trying to have the greatest potential impact against
multinational criminal enterprises, you have to be at least as well
organized as they are," he said at the time.</TE>
<TE>Leadership of DEA Was Met With Praise</TE>
<TE>   Supporters say his efforts to reform the DEA met with success and
reflect a management sense that might serve him well in his new job:
"Obviously, he didn't win the war on drugs--no one has and no one will,"
said Jan L. Handzlik, a Los Angeles attorney and friend of Bonner who has
worked closely with him over the years. "But in going after the major
cocaine traffickers and a number of heroin organizations, and attempting
to reallocate the resources of his agency, he had tremendous success."</TE>
<TE>   Some close observers of the Customs Service maintain Bonner is off to
a good start. "His baptism by fire has been much more difficult than for
any other commissioner," said Susan K. Ross, a Los Angeles attorney who
specializes in customs issues. She believes Bonner "has been able to do a
good job" of balancing the agency's various priorities, all in a time of
crisis.</TE>
<TE>   But others are doubtful. Despite growing support on Capitol Hill,
customs has struggled for White House support of a bigger budget. Beyond
that, the most effective reforms in protecting the U.S. heartland from
terrorist infiltration will require a level of cooperation among rival
federal agencies and international counterparts that has rarely been
accomplished.</TE>
<TE>   Bonner is a competent agency boss, said Jack Blum, former special
counsel to the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. "But the question is,
is he going to be able to deal with the organizational, political and
cultural problems and bring the operation into the 20th century, much
less then 21st?"</TE>
<TE>   Others fear that counterterrorism duties could overwhelm an agency
that lacked the resources to do its job fully even before Sept. 11. Since
then, customs employees have contended with shifts as long as 16 hours,
workweeks as long as seven days and reassignments to airports and borders
far from home.</TE>
<TE>Terrorist Threat Remains Paramount</TE>
<TE>   "I just don't know how long the employees can keep it up--and be
healthy and safe," said Colleen Kelley, president of the National
Treasury Employees Union, which represents customs workers.</TE>
<TE>   One cautionary note came last fall, when the White House rejected
Bonner's request for $350 million to add 1,631 positions to his work
force of 20,000. Yet Congress, reflecting changing public attitudes,
answered right back by reinstating much of the money. Even Bonner
conceded that the battle against terrorism may force some "robbing Peter
to pay Paul"--pushing some efforts, such as fraud investigations, further
down the priority list.</TE>
<TE>   But of the terrorist threat, he vowed: "That's the one that we have to
address and we will address."</TE>

<HD>Clinton's Got Right Stuff, but at Wrong Time</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RONALD BROWNSTEIN</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>NEW YORK
</DL>
<LD>At a conference last week on America's relations with the Muslim
world, Bill Clinton vividly displayed his analytical brilliance. But he
also demonstrated why George W. Bush may have been better suited to
respond to the crisis of Sept. 11.</LD>
<LD>   The long day of discussions with diplomats and academics at a seminar
sponsored by his post-presidential foundation provided a perfect stage
for Clinton's intellectual strengths. Though the former president looked
exhausted after a weeklong trip to the Middle East, he was
effortlessly--almost casually--dazzling.</LD>
<LD>   Responding to a series of panels from notes he jotted on a legal pad,
Clinton summarized the contending viewpoints and isolated the weak points
in the arguments with precision; his insights were sharp, and his
political instincts keen (as when he politely but unmistakably slapped
down speakers who blamed Muslim hostility toward America largely on U.S.
support for Israel). He juggled sweeping concepts and obscure facts (the
percentage of Palestinians killed in the intifada who are under 18)
without ever breaking a plate.</LD>
<TE>   He was also indefatigable. By 6 p.m., some around the room were
starting to nod off; Clinton was still nodding in agreement with
arguments he liked. By that point, Bush probably would have been rolling
his eyes, in the unlikely event that someone had strapped him into his
chair and kept him in the room at all.</TE>
<TE>   Yet, at day's end, it wasn't clear that the billowing clouds of talk
from the seminar's participants--glinting as they were with telling
facts, deep historical knowledge and sharp observations--offered any
better guidance for responding to Sept. 11 than what Bush recalled as his
first response: "I knew . . . there would be hell to pay for attacking
America."</TE>
<TE>   As Clinton demonstrated at the conference, his instinct is to master
the complexity of every situation; he takes apart domestic and global
problems like a tinkerer dismantling a car engine. In the discussion, he
showed the capacity to understand the perspective of both sides in every
dispute; to excavate the root causes in every grievance; to recognize the
subtle misunderstandings that divide every culture.</TE>
<TE>   That sensitivity, coupled with a ferocious persistence, made Clinton a
skilled peacemaker in Northern Ireland (and nearly the Middle East). But
it's not clear those skills are what America most wanted--or
needed--after Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   The directness of Bush's response--the unwavering determination to
catch and punish those responsible--more precisely captured the nation's
mood. After Sept. 11, many Americans may feel it is more important to be
feared than loved in the parts of the world where terrorism breeds. Bush
seems to understand that. Clinton probably would rather be feared and
loved.</TE>
<TE>   The issue isn't whether Clinton would have used force to retaliate for
the attacks. He demonstrated in Bosnia and Kosovo (over enormous
Republican resistance) that he was willing to use military power to
advance U.S. goals. And no president would have accepted the outrage of
Sept. 11 without delivering a powerful blow in response.</TE>
<TE>   But it's likely that Clinton would have felt a need to balance force
with gestures to reach out to the Muslim and Arab world. Those ideas have
a time and place. But this isn't it. The United States doesn't have an
obligation to reward societies that have incubated anti-American
extremism by increasing our aid to them.</TE>
<TE>   In the long run, to drain the swamps where terrorism festers, the West
does have to promote more opportunity and greater freedom in the Arab
world, as Clinton has been suggesting. But in the near term, America is
probably better off sending the unambiguous message Bush has been
stressing: that any government will pay a price for allowing
anti-American extremists to operate.</TE>
<TE>   Likewise, Clinton is surely right when he says that building lasting
security "will require much more of us than a strategy rooted in military
and law enforcement efforts, no matter how successful they are." But
while we are still working to convince hostile states that we are
committed to pursuing "military and law enforcement efforts," it diffuses
our message to label those efforts insufficient. Eventually America will
have to win hearts and minds. Now it has to capture terrorists.</TE>
<TE>   The clarity of that overriding imperative has worked to Bush's
strengths. He's most comfortable proceeding on a straightforward path
toward an unambiguous goal. His greatest asset as a leader is his
willingness to make decisions and not look back--in effect, not to be
overly troubled by the complexity that Clinton can puzzle over like a
jeweler inspecting a stone. Sometimes understanding the downside of every
decision can be as much burden as blessing.</TE>
<TE>   Bush's approach isn't an asset in all situations. He's needlessly
antagonized U.S. allies with a bull-headed suspicion of international
treaties on issues from global warming to missile defense. Neither he nor
his team has displayed the imagination to pursue new ways out of the
Israeli-Palestinian impasse. And he tends to carry the germ of a good
idea to an illogical extreme--as he's doing by proposing a gargantuan
Pentagon spending increase that absolves the military of responsibility
to make hard choices--or virtually any choices at all--between effective
and ineffective weapons.</TE>
<TE>   Yet in the shadowy new war the country faces, Bush's relentless
pursuit of a single priority--disabling terrorism--provides an
indispensable clarity and direction.</TE>
<TE>   In a way, Clinton and Bush can be seen as complementary pieces of what
the country needs from its leaders in this crisis. If you were looking
for a president to reconceptualize America's relations with the Muslim
world for decades to come, you'd pick Clinton. But to reestablish a
healthy fear of the United States among those who wish us harm, Bush
looks like the better bet.</TE>
<TE>   The reality is, the challenge ahead is large enough to absorb, even to
demand, both men's strengths. To win the peace, Bush would do well to
hear the ideas Clinton is beginning to formulate about accelerating
change in the Muslim world. But to first restore U.S. security, Bush's
instincts may offer the nation more than Clinton's insights.</TE>

<HD>Read Bush's Lips: He's Not His Father</HD>
<DH>Politics: The president's State of the Union speech will try to
wash away the muddy economic waters that mired his dad.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES GERSTENZANG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>As President Bush prepares for his first State of the Union address
Tuesday night, the speech looms as his best opportunity so far to drive
home the main message he has sought to convey in recent weeks: He is not,
at least politically, his father's son.</LD>
<LD>   If there is one scenario that haunts this White House, it is the trap
that ensnared George H.W. Bush, the 41st president. His popularity soared
as U.S.-led forces quickly triumphed in the 1991 Persian Gulf War, much
as the U.S. military successes in Afghanistan have propelled his son to
sky-high poll ratings. But the elder Bush went on to lose reelection in
1992, driven out of office not only by an economic recession but by the
impression that he was insufficiently concerned about the plight of
suffering Americans.</LD>
<LD>   The younger Bush and his top aides "all learned from 41, and they're
running scared," said a Republican lobbyist who is close to the Bush
family and works with the White House staff.</LD>
<TE>   Since the new year began, Bush has traveled from coast to coast,
stressing his commitment to getting the economy back on track, in
settings ranging from a town hall meeting in Ontario, Calif., to a
machinery factory in West Virginia. He will offer more of the same in the
State of the Union address to a joint session of the House and the Senate
before a nationwide television audience.</TE>
<TE>   "The president is going to talk about the need to help protect
America's workers and to create jobs and have a strong economy," White
House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer said recently.</TE>
<TE>   A senior White House aide elaborated, saying Bush will promise to
attack the nation's economic problems with "the same commitment and
vigor" that has guided the war in Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   The president is likely to expand on the economic themes in a second,
more detailed address in early February, White House officials said. And
he will continue to look for opportunities to emphasize his push for
developing additional domestic sources of energy, portraying that policy
as an important element of national security.</TE>
<TE>   Not surprisingly, the overarching theme of the State of the Union
address will be the need to protect the security--economic, domestic and
overseas--of a nation facing new threats at the start of the 21st
century.</TE>
<TE>   Personifying the American effort, Hamid Karzai, head of the interim
government in Afghanistan, who will meet Bush at the White House today,
is a likely presidential guest Tuesday in the Capitol.</TE>
<TE>   Asked whether the administration could tackle the range of domestic
and international security issues on its agenda, Andrew H. Card Jr., the
White House chief of staff, said during an appearance Sunday on NBC's
"Meet the Press": "We're committed. We can walk and chew gum at the same
time."</TE>
<TE>   Among the troublesome topics for Bush to tackle in the speech is the
Enron bankruptcy; the White House is working hard to prevent the fallout
of the energy company's controversial collapse from damaging Bush's
standing. Officials were debating last week whether to refer to it only
obliquely by raising proposals to protect Americans' pensions.</TE>
<TE>   Bush has revealed some of his specific recommendations for the
security effort. He announced last week that he would seek $38 billion
for homeland security, doubling the current funding, and that he wants to
give the Pentagon its biggest spending boost in two decades--a 14%
increase, totaling $48 billion.</TE>
<TE>   A poll conducted earlier this month by the Pew Research Center
underscored the chance Bush has to successfully promote his agenda
Tuesday night: 54% of those surveyed said the address this year will be
more important than such speeches in past years.</TE>
<TE>   That interest, said poll director Andrew Kohut, is the result of the
public's uncertainty about the war on terrorism and the future of the
economy, as well as a reflection of a newfound belief that what takes
place in Washington matters.</TE>
<TE>   "The public is going to be more open to him and listening harder,"
Kohut said. "This would suggest it could have more of an impact. It's a
great opportunity for him."</TE>
<TE>Responses More Mixed on Economy</TE>
<TE>   That is the good news for Bush in the survey.</TE>
<TE>   There is mixed news in the response when those polled were asked about
the economy--46% said Bush "could be doing more" to improve the economy.
Although that is clearly a cloud on the political horizon for Bush, it is
far better than the 76% who, a decade ago, said his father could have
been working harder on economic issues.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts say the president has some advantages that could help him
avoid his father's political downfall. Unlike the Gulf War, which had a
distinct beginning, middle and end, the campaign against terrorism will
dominate not only his presidency, but U.S. life well into the future.</TE>
<TE>   Politically, that could help Bush convert wartime popularity into
postwar political success, something that eluded not only his father but
such others as President Wilson and British Prime Minister Winston
Churchill.</TE>
<TE>   "It's very hard to translate military success into ongoing political
strength," said Benjamin Ginsberg, a professor of political science at
Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore. "Once the war is over, it's over.
But now it's different.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a non-ending war. The president can wrap himself in the flag
on an ongoing basis because the war has to be continually fought at home,
and the reality is some group of terrorists will always try to do
something. All it takes is one crazed guy trying to light his shoes for
the president to remind us who is protecting us."</TE>
<TE>   Also working for Bush: The Republican Party is not divided as it was
in 1992, when the GOP's conservative wing was angered that his father had
broken his pledge not to raise taxes.</TE>
<TE>   According to senior White House aides, the State of the Union speech
has been crafted over several weeks, beginning with talks Bush held with
counselor Karen Hughes at his Texas ranch during the holidays.</TE>
<TE>   From those discussions came a series of drafts by chief White House
speech writer Michael J. Gerson. He has been spotted in recent weeks at
two different Starbucks and an upscale sandwich shop within walking
distance of the White House, writing away on a yellow legal pad.</TE>
<TE>   There was more work in the quiet of Camp David, the presidential
retreat in Maryland's Catoctin Mountains; further revisions by Hughes
during two intensive days last week and then, beginning last Thursday,
rehearsals by Bush with a TelePrompTer. Those sessions led to more
presidential editing to transform his writers' prose into his own more
straightforward style.</TE>
<TE>   The more common touch that Bush favors is another advantage he has
over his father, said Leo Ribuffo, a history professor at George
Washington University in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   Even if economic problems worsen, "he won't look like a man to the
manor born," Ribuffo said. "His accent is part of it. He has cultivated
his Texas-hood."</TE>

<HD>Cyberspace Attacks Are on the Rise</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From the Washington Post</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON
</DL>
<LD>Cyber attacks are becoming more common and targeted, according to a
study to be released today, and security experts warned that the trend is
only going to increase.</LD>
<LD>   Tracking the security breaches of more than 300 clients across the
world, Internet security firm Riptech said it verified at least 128,678
cyber attacks from July to December. While few of the attacks detected
posed a "severe threat," the Alexandria, Va., company said it was
surprised by the volume.</LD>
<LD>   "This report should clearly illustrate that the Internet security
threat is real, pervasive, and perhaps more severe than previously
anticipated," the report says.</LD>
<TE>   There were 52,658 security breaches and attacks last year, up 50% from
the previous year, according to the CERT Coordination Center, a
government-funded computer emergency-response team at Carnegie Mellon
University in Pittsburgh. The center also received reports of 2,437
computer vulnerabilities, more than double the figure from 2000.</TE>
<TE>   The Riptech study did not include "worm" attacks. Computer worms are
reproducing programs that run independently and travel across network
connections. The main difference between viruses and worms is the method
in which they reproduce and spread. Including worms in the count
increased the number of attacks by 63%.</TE>
<TE>   Securing the country's Internet infrastructure has received fresh
attention since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks. In October, President
Bush named Richard Clark to the new position of special advisor to the
president for cyberspace security. Cyber security is expected to be
included in efforts coordinated by the Office of Homeland Security, which
was established after the attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Computer systems are increasingly vulnerable to cyber attacks, in part
because companies are not implementing security measures already
available, according to a recent report by the Computer Science and
Telecommunications Board, part of the U.S.-based National Research
Council.</TE>
<TE>   Riptech's findings largely amplify industry concerns. About 41% of
companies experienced attacks that were critical, and needed to be
addressed to avoid compromising their computer systems. About 12.7%
encountered at least one "emergency" in which the company had to
"initiate some form of recovery procedure," the report says.</TE>
<TE>   "The community of hackers is getting bigger and the tools used to
launch the attacks are easier to find and easier to use," said Tim
Belcher, Riptech's chief technology officer.</TE>
<TE>   A small number of countries were the source of the vast majority of
attacks; 30% came from within the U.S., the report says.</TE>

<HD>TV Trying to Find Enron Tale's 'Sexy' Side</HD>
<DH>Media: News shows are latching onto the emotional stories of
employees ruined in the firm's collapse.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH JENSEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK
</DL>
<LD>The collapse of energy trader Enron Corp. in the largest bankruptcy
in U.S. history is a complicated tale, one involving financial
instruments such as derivatives, arcane accounting methods and potential
conflicts of interest at federal agencies--none of which makes for
particularly compelling television.</LD>
<LD>   That's where the ordinary people who lost their pensions and severance
come in. With the Enron story too big to be ignored, TV news operations
have latched onto the emotional stories of Enron's enraged employees and
investors as a way to make the story relatable to viewers whose fingers
might otherwise reach for the remote control.</LD>
<LD>   Steve Friedman, executive producer of CBS' "The Early Show," cited
three ways to attack the intricate story, conceding that the business
approach is one "most of the audience will find very, very boring and not
understand unless they live in the Cayman Islands."</LD>
<TE>   Friedman prefers the emotional side, calling the tales of lost 401(k)
retirement money "the grist of morning television." He also likes the
"caper" approach, or "Who's going to get caught where and thrown in
jail."</TE>
<TE>   News executives say they have no plans to line up a coterie of
financial consultants to explain the story, as they have with the
military experts detailing operations in Afghanistan or the
constitutional law experts who held forth after the disputed 2000
presidential election.</TE>
<TE>   "Are we going to see green eye-shade guys with a garter around their
sleeve and a huge balance sheet on the wall?" asked CNBC anchor Ron
Insana. "I don't think so. The straighter you play it, in some ways, the
better off you are. People like the plain talk."</TE>
<TE>   ABC's "World News Tonight" created a segment called "The Outrage File"
to handle much of its Enron coverage, featuring such stories as looking
at an employee selling his house because he's not getting his promised
severance. But the show also called in offbeat correspondent Robert
Krulwich, known for his talent at making dry financial material
interesting. On Thursday, Krulwich used a yellow balloon graphic to
explain in very basic language how Enron is thought to have inflated its
worth through multiple off-the-books partnerships.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no question I'm trying to leaven the coverage with people
stories, but we're not doing that at the expense of the broader stories,"
said Paul Slavin, the newscast's executive producer, who added that the
story has moved so quickly--from the shredding of documents to Friday's
apparent suicide of a former top Enron executive--that he's not worried
about boring viewers.</TE>
<TE>   ABC's "Nightline" has tackled the story twice, including a Dec. 12
piece that at that time marked only the second topic that was not
terrorism or war-related to be featured on a late-night program since
Sept. 11 (the other was the death of ex-Beatle George Harrison).</TE>
<TE>   "Nightline" and other programs also have tried to connect what Enron
and auditor Andersen did to practices at other companies. "That perks
people's ears up," Executive Producer Leroy Sievers said.</TE>
<TE>   As Gresham Striegel, senior producer of Fox News Channel's business
coverage, noted, "Instead of taking the micro approach of, say, what
exactly a derivative is, we try to take a sense of, could this happen to
you? What are the things you should look for? What's being done?"</TE>
<TE>   Not everyone thinks TV needs to be so concerned with whether viewers
will be bored by the Enron story. "We dare to be dull," said CNN's
"Moneyline" anchor Lou Dobbs, suggesting the story's "manifest
importance" within the financial and political world "creates an
atmosphere in which viewers are willing to do the heavy lifting necessary
to understand it."</TE>
<TE>   CNBC's Insana goes so far as to call the billions of dollars that were
lost "really sexy," with the magnitude of the possible financial fraud
making the story more viewer-friendly. "It helps that the size and scope
is eye-popping on its own merit."</TE>
<TE>   Still, when cable networks had to choose Thursday between the first
Enron hearings on Capitol Hill and the first court appearance of accused
American Talib John Walker Lindh, the hearings received less
coverage--before the children kidnapped by their school bus driver took
precedence over both.</TE>
<TE>   "That transcends [everything]," Striegel said. "That's a heartstrings
story that's going to garner a lot of attention."</TE>
<TE>   Cable network executives also expect a hearing appearance by former
Enron Chairman Kenneth L. Lay to garner more attention "because of his
connection to the president and the vice president," Striegel said.</TE>

<HD>"Fortinbras' Tries a Push-Button Approach</HD>
<DH>Theater * Audience gets a hand in directing the production by
signaling changes at UC Irvine.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE BOEHM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Scott Werve is on the verge of earning a master's degree in
theater-directing from UC Irvine, but is convinced the art form he has
studied is hopelessly out of touch with people like himself who have
grown up in a wired world.</LD>
<LD>   In theater, the operating system has remained essentially unchanged.
The actors act. The audience watches. Any attempt at interactivity could
lead to ejection.</LD>
<LD>   For the finale to their academic career, Werve and Grant Van Zevern,
the scenic designer who is his leading co-conspirator, will invite a
theater audience to do what everybody else is doing in the age of the
Internet: Look, listen and click. Then, if one likes, click and click
some more and see if something else happens because the ticket-holder
would like to see an instant change in the performance and has opted to
press the button provided for that very purpose.</LD>
<TE>   "I guess it's twentysomething hubris. We'll see if we tan shake things
up," Werve said.</TE>
<TE>   "It wont be a complete melee," assures Cameron Harvey, chairman of
UCI's drama department. Harvey heads the play-selection committee that
gave Werve the go-ahead for "Fortinbras Gets Drunk," the experiment in
wired-age audience participation that opens Thursday at the campus'
Studio Theatre.</TE>
<TE>   The play was written during the mid-1980s by Janusz Glowacki, who
emigrated from Poland to the United States in 1982 to escape the
then-Communist regime. Like Tom Stoppard's "Rosencrantz and Guildenstern
Are Dead," "Fortinbras Gets Drunk" revamps 'Hamlet" by looking at it from
the perspective of a peripheral character. In Shakespeare's "Hamlet,"
Norway is threatening to conquer Denmark; when the Danish court implodes
in the final scene's self-inflicted bloodbath, the Norwegian prince,
Fortinbras, sweeps in to clean up the mess.</TE>
<TE>   In Glowacki's play, something's putrid in the state of Norway. A
totalitarian thuggery rules, the governed live in ignorance, and the
all-seeing secret police (personified by a character named Eight Eyes)
sow disinformation, terror and chaos. Fortinbras survives by lapsing into
a state of drunken buffoonery. Nobody bothers to assassinate him because
nobody sees him as a threat, Meanwhile, Norway's rulers run covert
operations to destabilize Denmark. Fortinbras' only hope is to ally
himself with Hamlet. Werve, 29, read the play in the early 1990s as an
undergraduate at Cal Poly San Luis Obispo. As he brainstormed ways to
give audiences a say in what unfolds onstage, "Fortinbras Gets Drunk"
struck him as an apt vehicle. He was drawn by its examination of what
individual initiative can and can't accomplish in a world fraught with
mysterious powers that alternately exert control and cause chaos.</TE>
<TE>   Werve also chose "Fortinbras Gets Drunk" for its fast pace, its wild,
sometimes horrific images and its far-from-rosy vision of what ensues
when an individual seeker of justice and decency fights lawless power. As
the audience members push their buttons, the director expects chaos to be
a likely result--thereby bringing the onlookers closer to the predicament
of the play.</TE>
<TE>   "There's disintegration in the world of the play, and a kind of
drunken, lurching, queasy protagonist in Fortinbras," Werve said.
"Instead of just watching someone stumble through a social and political
situation that's fallen apart, you can feel and experience what falling
apart is. I don't think our production is polemical. It's just that we
can go into a place that's chaotic and laugh at it and learn to live with
it a bit."</TE>
<TE>   The audience will be able to push the performance toward rapid
change--and potential chaos--in several ways. Some seats will be equipped
with buttons that signal a change in the lighting. Elsewhere, the,
buttons will send prompts for changes in other production factors: sound,
costumes and action. It will be up to the stage manager, Emily Caster, to
Monitor the electronic voting and put the outcomes rapidly into action.
If the light-change buttons are being pressed most often and with
greatest intensity, she would, in theory, let loose an explosion of
shifting lighting. She can accomplish that--or changes in the score and
sound effects--with the push of a computer key. The costumes will be
shapes like paper dolls, worn like sandwich boards. If all goes well,
quick changes will be possible.</TE>
<TE>   There will be some controls, however, on any chaos that a full house
of 90 button-pushers might generate. The playing area will be divided
like a three-ring circus. In the central ring, "Fortinbras Gets Drunk"
will be performed line for line the way Glowacki wrote it, no matter
what. But actors who would normally be offstage waiting for their next
cue will remain visible on the periphery. If the audience calls for it,
the characters will jump into what Werve calls "side-scenes"--improvised,
wordless playlets that expand upon or comment on the main story. But at
certain moments, the sideshows will stop and the audience's power will be
taken away so that everyone can focus on what Glowacki wrote.</TE>
<TE>   "There are certain points where things need to calm back down for [the
play] to be understood," Harvey said.</TE>
<TE>   So the totalitarian regime of the theater paradoxically still applies.</TE>
<TE>   "Since we started talking about creating something that chaotic, all
we've done is talk about rules for shaping the chaos somehow," Werve
said. "It feels like the audience has control, but it's an illusion.  The
stage manager is always in control over everything." That's fitting, he
said, given how Glowacki's Fortinbras is merely teased with the idea that
an individual can effect change.</TE>
<TE>   Werve doubts he can be any more successful than Fortinbras in
overthrowing the prevailing hierarchy of the theater world. After he
graduates this spring, his first job will be an internship as an
assistant  director at the Oregon Shakespeare Festival, a major,
mainstream theater company. "Even if we could lure artistic directors
[from major theaters] to come and watch, even if they had the greatest
time of their life, they would say, 'We don't do this kind of theater,'
Werve said. "We probably won't get a chance to do this kind of thing
again unless we hit it rich and buy our own theater."</TE>
<TE>   What if the audience gets drunk on its license to intervene? Then,
Werve said, the performance crashes, just like an overtaxed computer, The
stage goes dark for an instant, and "Fortinbras Gets Drunk" takes a
moment to reboot. It resumes with just the central action running. "I
don't know if there's any precedent for what we're doing,Werve said."
"We're trying hard to get it to work, and we hope we can pull it off."</TE>
