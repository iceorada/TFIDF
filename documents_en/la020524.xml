<HD>A Party Andy Warhol Would Have Dug</HD>

<LD>Would Andy Warhol have appreciated the Hollywood-like premiere of his
retrospective at MOCA Wednesday night?</LD>
<LD>   "He would have loved this," said painter Ed Moses. "Andy loved
glitz." Moses was next to Charlize Theron at the bar, one of many
scenes of intersecting worlds in a night that began with paparazzi
and metal detectors branded with the phrase: "Welcome to Tomorrow's
Technology." (As one woman walked through, she wondered, "Do you
think my knee will set this off?") The crowd moved across a white
carpet, past reporters, and through a replica of Warhol's 1964
"Brillo Box" and into the party.</LD>
<LD>   The gala drew more than 1,000 for a preview of the show, which
opens Saturday and runs through Aug. 18.</LD>
<TE>   Lower Grand Avenue was transformed into a New York Factory party,
or rather, an imitation of one. A museum loading dock had been
converted to a gritty, urban stage: There was Candy Darling (or a
replica--this one was Xavier from New York) wriggling on a platform
underneath a group of purple Warhol self-portraits. The bartenders
were imitation Warhols in white Warhol wigs.</TE>
<TE>   Big names entered, and the entrance clogged as people gathered to
watch. As with any good Warhol event, the audience was part of the
show.</TE>
<TE>   Names, names, names.</TE>
<TE>   Was that Michael Eisner over there, greeting Lisa Kudrow? Was that
Kelly Lynch, in Pucci? Was that Versace on that woman? Steve Martin?</TE>
<TE>   "It looks like one of his situations," said Irving Blum, looking
over the crowd and the decor. "The copy of the copy," he said,
laughing a booming laugh. (Blum had reason to laugh. In 1962, he
hosted the first Warhol show at his Ferus Gallery on La Cienega
Boulevard, featuring 32 Campbell Soup cans. Some sold for $100, but
Blum bought them back to keep the series intact. After Warhol's
death, he was offered $10 million. They are currently part of the
permanent collection at the National Gallery of Art in Washington,
D.C.)</TE>
<TE>   A redheaded woman in purple named Lovey Dash, who was a teen when
she met Warhol at Studio 54, surveyed the black-clad crowd and
concluded: "I don't think people dressed appropriately....I think
[Warhol] would have liked a wilder scene."</TE>
<TE>   Guests and entertainers mingled on a street corner where an
ordinary yellow fire hydrant seemed suddenly to look like art in the
twilight zone between image and reality. Scenes from the performance:
A "cowboy" in silver pants and pink suede, a bare-chested man in a
giant blond wig and orange crinoline skirt at the vodka bar. Paul
Reubens next to the white leather couches. Robbie Robertson in black.
A couple in silver body paint and hot pants. A woman saying: "I don't
know who she is, but she's wearing a Pucci from 40 years ago" as
Lynch, in a psychedelic print, posed for photographers.</TE>
<TE>   Gallery owner Michael Kohn joked about the loops of art and
history and the time he showed Warhol's work in the '80s. He had to
beg friends to buy it, he said, until the day Warhol died. That day,
he said, he got the calls, beginning at 6 a.m. "It was like the stock
market," Kohn said, referring to the escalating prices throughout the
day. Still, he said, he had nothing on Blum. "I'm just a total
footnote in history."</TE>
<TE>   Stylist Vincent Boucher looked amused. "Oh, yeah, Andy would have
approved," he said. (Everyone had a Warhol story. Boucher met him
when Warhol was signing copies of Interview magazine in 1978.)</TE>
<TE>   Gray curtains surrounded the party, and against the walls floated
giant silver inflatables, echoes of Warhol's 1966 Factory
installation "silver clouds." Around 8 p.m., one set of curtains
parted slowly to reveal rows of dinner tables draped in black and
topped with bright yellow and orange daisies. . Soundtrack: David
Bowie's "Fame." With several cameras scanning the crowd, projecting
unsuspecting faces onto big screens, it was hard to step outside the
frame. Few wanted to.</TE>
<TE>   Dennis Hopper, the guest of honor, spotted an old friend. "Here we
are, man!" he said as they embraced. Hopper was flanked by the
picturesque and the painter, Anjelica Huston and Robert Graham. On
his arm was his wife, Victoria Duffy. "I love it," he said, looking
at the decor--Warhol images of Warhol. "It actually relates to
Dennis' work," said Duffy. "Reality and illusion," she said. Hopper's
face, the iconic image from "Blue Velvet" and from Gap commercials,
was illuminated by strobes beneath another icon: Warhol's 1964
"Self-Portrait," projected on the wall.</TE>
<TE>   After dinner, guests inspected the galleries at the museum, where
go-go dancers, patrons and posers provided background (and cat calls)
for the well-heeled guests as they admired more Warhol imagery.</TE>
<TE>   Downstairs, in a theater, Warhol's "Screen Tests" ran without
sound. There was Nico, nibbling a Hershey bar. Upstairs, at the
tented dance floor, three women discussed images. "Well, they said
festive," one woman said defensively about her colorful, see-through
dress. "And you," she continued, somewhat aggressively, "you look
festive in your Prada." Nearby, a couple of guests took pictures of
the party and the parade.</TE>
<TE>   As the party shut down at 11 p.m., some guests took the
opportunity to buy images at the gift shop.</TE>
<TE>   See the image, be the image, buy the image.</TE>
<TE>   Somewhere, someone was laughing.</TE>

<LD>THE WAILING WIND</LD>
<LD>   A Novel</LD>
<LD>   By Tony Hillerman</LD>
<TE>   HarperCollins</TE>
<TE>   232 pages, $25.95</TE>
<TE>   Fans of Tony Hillerman's Navajo mysteries pick up his new novels
knowing they will meet again his familiar and comfortable characters,
Lt. Joe Leaphorn (now retired) and Sgt. Jim Chee of the Navajo Tribal
Police.</TE>
<TE>   In his new novel, "The Wailing Wind," Hillerman takes his readers
again into the thin air and intense blue skies of the high country of
the desert Southwest, the Four Corners area of the vast Navajo
Nation, its borders anchored at the corners by the four sacred
mountains.</TE>
<TE>   Wind is present in all seasons, stinging faces with dust, turning
up the green leaves of the cottonwood trees in the arroyos and
canyons, setting the leaves of the aspens aquiver where they grow
with the spruces at the higher elevations.</TE>
<TE>   Lower down, below the mountains on the rolling hills and flat
mesas, are the dark green pinyon pines and the lighter juniper, and
below them the gray-brown and infrequently green grasslands where the
sheep and cattle graze.</TE>
<TE>   In winter there are squalls of snow. In summer, when the people
who live there are lucky, the monsoon moist air from the Gulf of
California and the Gulf of Mexico builds up into staggeringly tall
cumulus clouds, the rain falls, lightning strikes and the thunder
rolls and rolls and echoes.</TE>
<TE>   In Hillerman's novels this landscape, like his two Navajo
policemen, is always the same. But in each novel lately he has been
introducing some new element of Navajo culture to his readers.
Hillerman has said that he never starts a Leaphorn and Chee book
without hoping to give the reader some insight into the culture of
the Navajo, who deserve to be better understood than they are.</TE>
<TE>   In "The Wailing Wind," Hillerman explores aspects of the chindi,
the ghost or spirit or emanation a person leaves behind after death.
In this novel the chindi is important because there are two deaths
two years apart that turn out to be murders.</TE>
<TE>   While Leaphorn and his younger friend Chee, with some help, are
solving the murders, people who have encountered the corpses or are
otherwise drawn into the murders seek a shaman, or hataalii, to sing
the sacred chants, called "ways," that will purify them and restore
them to harmony with the natural, sacred world. Sometimes, as in "The
Wailing Wind," those needing a healing way are themselves policemen
or policewomen, Navajos who respect the old ways but work in the
modern world.</TE>
<TE>   The tension between tradition and modernity is the hallmark of a
Hillerman Navajo mystery. His account of the tensions is expressed
perhaps more benignly than in actual life on the reservation. His
chief characters are not driven by alcoholism or extreme poverty or
despair. His Navajo figures are mostly stable. Chee's conflicts
arise, for instance, when he is thinking of marrying a woman he
likes. He has already rejected two, one in particular because she was
too "Ivy League." It is probably significant for Hillerman fans that
in "The Wailing Wind," Chee has fallen in love with a Navajo
policewoman, Bernadette Manuelito.</TE>
<TE>   As in his other books, there is also a good dose of New Mexico
history and lore in "The Wailing Wind." Part of the story takes place
in Fort Wingate, that huge Army installation (dating on its present
site to 1862) that held bunkers containing most of the munitions
assembled for use in the Vietnam War.</TE>
<TE>   And, since the novel turns on a long-lost and much-coveted gold
mine, Hillerman provides a nice description of how to build a placer
mine for gold (a method that uses water to collect minerals lying on
or near the surface of the ground) in the bottom of a canyon using
natural rainfall.</TE>
<TE>   Once again, Hillerman has come through with a pleasing portrait of
a region and a culture presented through the sympathetic eyes of his
agreeable chief characters, retired Lt. Joe Leaphorn and Sgt. Jim
Chee.</TE>

<HD>Dye It and Deny It--or Shine the Silver</HD>
<DH>Not all male celebrities these days think of graying hair
as the temples of doom</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL QUINTANILLA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Playboy babe magnet Hugh Hefner has never done it. "Good Day L.A."
anchorman Steve Edwards stopped doing it about a year-and-a-half ago.
And fashion critic Mr. Blackwell did it only once and then shut
himself in his home, not to be seen outdoors for three months.</LD>
<LD>   Never--we repeat, never--say "dye" to these guys. For them, what
you see on their noggins is what you get: an au naturel head of
distinguished gray hair. For many men, the question of whether they
color their coif is so personal--we're talking deep-rooted here--that
accusations of doing so  may even lead to legal action.</LD>
<LD>   Take the recent flap over the dark 'do of Germany's Chancellor
Gerhard Schroeder which many seem to think should be more salt than
pepper, especially for a seasoned man of 58.</LD>
<TE>   Schroeder denies he dyes. Don't taint his image with tint, don't
ruin his reputation with rinse--this man has filed affidavits
claiming his brown hair has never been color-enhanced. Now he's
threatening to sue news organizations that have quoted an image
consultant saying the chancellor's credibility would improve if he
"would not color away his gray hairs." His Berlin stylist, Udo Walz,
wants the world to know that Schroeder does sport gray hairs, and if
you get "within 10 centimeters" of the man's head, you can see them.</TE>
<TE>   Still, whether the chancellor is committing follicular fraud or
not, we ask, why would a man, particularly an older gent, re-roof his
head? Or not? Naturally, we're dying to know.</TE>
<TE>   For answers we turn to experts, among them, colorists,
hairdressers, an author-historian, and psychotherapist Dennis
Palumbo, who counsels men experiencing midlife and career problems,
and knows many who live and dye in L.A.</TE>
<TE>   "It's very common for my male clients to do things like get hair
plugs and dye their hair--it's their response to aging. They want to
make themselves seem more hip, reinvigorate themselves sexually,"
Palumbo says, adding, "We are so father-starved in the culture and
yet no one wants to appear their age."</TE>
<TE>   His take on Schroeder? "Let's face it, you don't become a
political leader without a great amount of narcissism. You still want
to look hot for the secretaries, you know."</TE>
<TE>   History professor Lynne Luciano of Cal State Dominguez Hills and
author of "Looking Good: Male Body Image in Modern America" (Hill &amp;
Wang, 2001) says "there's still lots of prejudice against men dying
their hair." She says it's perfectly fine for men to get Botoxed,
bags removed from their eyes, liposuction or even their southbound
foundations lifted. But when it comes to dyeing, "it seems very vain
and has retained a stigma because it is so 'female' ... it rarely
looks good on a man."</TE>
<TE>   Just think (or try not to) of Bob Dole, Dick Clark, James Brown or
Johnny Cash, and you get the picture. Ronald Reagan always denied he
hued his hair. But author Kitty Kelley scooped the world and revealed
in her unauthorized biography about Nancy Reagan more than 10 years
ago that the president's gray roots were dyed regularly--in secret,
of course, and by Nancy's hairdresser, Julius--since 1968. When
Reagan's head was shaved for surgery after he left the White House,
his hair grew back gray. Still, his handlers denied that he had
previously colored it.</TE>
<TE>   In 1968, presidential candidate Hubert H. Humphrey turned heads:
In January his hair was white; seven months later, it was black.</TE>
<TE>   And then there's the hairy scariest of all--Strom Thurmond, the
99-year-old soon-to-retire Republican senator from South Carolina,
who is the original Carrot Top.</TE>
<TE>   But men like Vidal Sassoon, Alex Trebek, Bob Barker, George
Hamilton and Richard Gere--who used to cover up--have had enough of
the shoe-polish look. Sean Connery, Jay Leno, President Clinton,
Edward James Olmos, George Clooney and Harrison Ford are others who
prefer to keep their look salty with a dash of pepper.</TE>
<TE>   But what about the locks of other high-profile men? Dare we play a
fast round of follicle folly: "Does he or doesn't he?"</TE>
<TE>   * Ozzy Osbourne? @#$!!--flipping, yes.</TE>
<TE>   * Cardinal Roger Mahony? Bless him, we believe he does.</TE>
<TE>   * Robert Blake? Duh!</TE>
<TE>   * Bernard Parks? No violation here.</TE>
<TE>   * SpongeBob SquarePants? Trick question. He has no hair.</TE>
<TE>   Edwards, at Fox TV's Channel 11, says he dyed his hair for years
after "it came in just gray on the top and looked absurd under the
lights." In the beginning, his wife, Jean, "would pour the bottle of
dye on my head." Eventually, he had professional colorists tend to
his hair as he chased the fountain of youth.</TE>
<TE>   He says he dyed so much--every six weeks, sometimes more
often--that his hair, after being exposed to the sun and the bright
lights of anchordom, took on the shade "of premature magenta," which
is why he stopped coloring.</TE>
<TE>   These days, he cracks, "I'm chasing the fountain of age." But
co-workers and viewers think otherwise: He's Fox's foxy
silver-haired-mane man. Even guest David Cassidy "complimented me on
it and told me he wished he had the guts" to go the way of gray.
"You'd be amazed at the mail I get from women who have been able to
stop their husbands from dying their hair. Why didn't I do it all
these years?"</TE>
<TE>   Hefner says he's never dyed. "I'm happy I went gray in a natural
way. The lower part of my hair is grayer than the top and now has a
distinguished quality about it. I like the lines in my face--they go
with my hair," he says, adding "I think I look better now than when I
was younger. I think I've aged well, hair and all."</TE>
<TE>   Blackwell has only dyed his hair once, and that was about 20 years
ago. "I looked scary. I stayed inside my home for three months.
Whenever your hair goes gray and you dye it dark, it turns into a
purple shade," he says.</TE>
<TE>   "I personally think a man can live with his hair being natural,
but not a woman. With men, it's too brash and hard. It's spooky. And
when they dye their eyebrows, they look like Groucho Marx."</TE>
<TE>   Hairstylist Stuart Gavert of Gavert Atelier in Beverly Hills,
says, "Women often sit in my chairs and say, 'I didn't want to go out
with him because he dyes his hair.' So, there you go." But if a man
feels he must, then Gavert advises him to seek professional help. Men
who dye their own hair often get disastrous results--shades from
yellow to green to violet. He says some of his older male clients
"just want to leave a little gray at the temples and request that I
'make it more pepper than salt'--that's the biggest trend right now."</TE>
<TE>   Jennifer Jahanbigloo, color specialist and co-owner of Juan Juan
Salon in Beverly Hills, says many of her older A-listers in the film
industry only want the gray to show in the sideburns and temples,
"like they're barely starting to gray."</TE>
<TE>   "I have a client who is a director who has been wanting to keep up
with the younger generation and doesn't want to look older than he
is. We dyed his hair and took 10 years off his age," she says.</TE>
<TE>   At Vidal Sassoon Salon, also in Beverly Hills, half of color
director Yiotis Panayiotou's male clientele "want to disguise their
gray hair" for reasons ranging from workplace issues to attracting
younger women.</TE>
<TE>   Etienne Taenaka, the salon's manager, adds that men "can have it
both ways"--gray and a dye job because of new products such as
semi-permanent color enhancers that will leave some of the gray in.
By the way, Taenaka adds: "These products are made in Germany, so,
just maybe the chancellor might be doing this."</TE>
<TE>   Of course, only his hairdresser would know for sure.</TE>

<LD>James Carter Exhibition</LD>
<LD>   It's science fair season. Time to think of a project! Did you know
that art and science make terrific partners? Science projects are a
great opportunity to look at the wonders and curiosities in our world
and try to make sense of them. Art brings your imagination into the
work and your visual expression helps us see into your mind's eye.</LD>
<LD>   Science and art involve creativity, and both occupy us with
questions. Scientists and artists ask themselves questions such as
"What if ...?" or "Why?" and then work to provide answers with
investigations, research, experiments and expression. A goal of
scientists and artists is to satisfy a curiosity through
problem-solving.</LD>
<TE>   Art and science are currently displayed at the Santa Monica Museum
of Art in an exhibition featuring the work of James Carter, a man who
has very unique and original ideas about our universe. He has unusual
questions about gravity and his own opinions about energy, based on
more than 30 years of research. Carter is more of a self-taught
scientist than artist, but the museum's exhibition shows his many
beautiful drawings, 3-D models, computer animations and machines that
illustrate his fantastic thoughts. Carter says he is able to
understand his own work when he makes it visual.</TE>
<TE>   You can see James Carter's project in the exhibition "Lithium Legs
and Apocalyptic Photons: The Imaginative World of James Carter," on
view until June 9. For more information, call (310) 586-6488 or visit
www.smmoa.org.</TE>

<HD>'Flung' Into Controversy by Negative Book Review</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIM RUTTEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Like love, literature has the power to provoke both delight and very
nasty quarrels.</LD>
<LD>   One such fight surrounds this week's cancellation of a reading at
Esowon, the independent, black-owned bookstore that is Los Angeles'
leading outlet for writing by African Americans. At the controversy's
center is Wanda Coleman, the prizewinning poet and fiction writer
whose 14 books include "Mercurochrome," a 2001 National Book Award
nominee.</LD>
<LD>   The facts of the situation are not in dispute; motives are:</LD>
<TE>   Coleman is among the local African American writers included in a
new anthology, "Griots Beneath the Baobab: Tales From Los Angeles,"
published by the International Black Writers Assn. She and a number
of her colleagues were scheduled to read from their work Wednesday at
Esowon in Leimert Park. However, after Coleman's harshly negative
review of Maya Angelou's latest book, "A Song Flung Up to Heaven,"
appeared in the April 14 issue of The Times' Book Review, the store's
owners, James Fugate and Tom Hamilton, asked the publisher to drop
the poet from the roster of readers.</TE>
<TE>   "We read the review, and we were so offended by it that we didn't
want her in our store," Fugate said.</TE>
<TE>   The publisher polled the 14 writers by e-mail. Seven voted to
cancel the reading rather than agree to Esowon's demand; two said the
objectionable author should withdraw; one urged further negotiation;
and four were undecided, according to e-mails that Coleman shared
with The Times.</TE>
<TE>   Fugate said that "while there is obviously nothing wrong with
thoughtful criticism, the tone of this review was personal and ugly
and unnecessarily so. Nobody is censoring her, but we don't invite
into our store people with whom we wouldn't want to be in the same
room. Actually, I hope more people read her review, because then they
will come around to our point of view."</TE>
<TE>   Coleman, however, believes the store's antipathy toward her
extends beyond a single piece of criticism. Indeed, despite her
standing as Los Angeles' best-known African American poet, despite
her many awards--including the 1999 Lenore Marshall Prize from the
Academy of American Poets--despite the fact that her prestigious
literary publisher, Black Sparrow, keeps all of her titles in print,
Esowon does not stock any of Coleman's work.</TE>
<TE>   "This store is frequented by young black kids," Coleman said.
"This store's customers are at the core of my readership, and its
refusal to carry my books should not be lightly dismissed. To me it
is bizarre." But Fugate said it is a matter of commerce. "We don't
stock her books," he said, "because they never sold. We will order
them for people who want them. We recently ordered all of her books
for a friend of hers who wanted them. Checking the computer, I see
that two years ago, we sold precisely three hardcover copies of
'Mercurochrome.' Last year, we sold one in paper and one in
hardcover."</TE>
<TE>   But the South Central-born Coleman, who said she met Fugate only
once and very briefly, said she suspects there is more than economics
to Esowon's treatment of her books. It is her frankness concerning
other African American writers the store finds objectionable, she
said.</TE>
<TE>   "There are things we don't want" in Esowon, he said. "Last year,
for example, we thought it would be interesting to have [Libertarian
African American radio personality] Larry Elder speak. It was a big
mistake. People were upset and yelling and screaming [when he did].
If we invited her into the store, it would be the same thing" because
of her criticism of Angelou, whose work, Fugate said, sells.</TE>
<TE>   Coleman takes exception to that view. "Historically, black authors
have had a legitimate gripe that it was hard to get published and
even harder to get reviewed," she said. "When you did get reviewed,
it was usually by dominant culture writers who ripped you to shreds.
That experience has left a residue of rage" and reticence about
criticizing other black writers' work. "But to follow the dictate of
silencing any sort of critical thinking by African Americans about
African American literature is old thinking.</TE>
<TE>   "The landscape has changed so much," Coleman said, "that African
American critics have an obligation to feel free to express
themselves." Silent solidarity "made sense at a certain point, but
that time is past."</TE>
<TE>   Work in Progress</TE>
<TE>   David J. Garrow is Presidential Distinguished Professor at Emory
University's Law School and author of numerous books, including
"Bearing the Cross," a Pulitzer Prize-winning biography of Martin
Luther King.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been working on a couple of magazine articles while awaiting
the publication later this month of a book I co-edited with my
colleague Dennis J. Hutchinson of the University of Chicago Law
School. The book's title is 'The Forgotten Memoir of John Knox: A
Year in the Life of a Supreme Court Clerk in FDR's Washington.' Mr.
Knox died five years ago, and his manuscript was given to me by his
closest living relative. She was a woman involved in Roe v. Wade, who
I got to know while working on my book about that case ('Liberty and
Security: The Right to Privacy and the Making of Roe v. Wade').</TE>
<TE>   "His memoir recounts a pivotal year in the court's history, the
session during which Franklin Roosevelt's plan to pack the court was
shot down. Knox was the clerk for Justice James C. McReynolds, a
drooling, racist, anti-Semite. He was the most reactionary of
so-called 'nine old men,' as New Dealers called the justices who
blocked so many of FDR's reforms. The memoir actually has four main
characters: McReynolds, Knox, the young social climber clerk ... and
two fascinating African Americans, who were McReynolds' maid and
messenger.</TE>
<TE>   "They are the actual stars of the book, since they come across as
wonderful, hard-working human beings who persevere out of a sense of
decency and duty in the face of McReynolds' abuse and ingratitude."</TE>

<LD>CANNES, France--Dame Elizabeth Taylor was the last to arrive, making
a grand entrance nearly three hours after cocktails began at the
Thursday night fund-raiser for the American Foundation for AIDS
Research. She was resplendent in diamonds and a beaded flesh colored
Gianfranco Ferre gown.</LD>
<LD>   But it was model Iman who stole the limelight, wearing a
pear-shaped, 203-karat Millennium Star diamond--the largest and
purest stone of its kind--to accessorize a simple black, low-cut gown
by John Galliano for Dior.</LD>
<LD>   The AMFAR event, the annual social highlight of the Cannes Film
Festival, was attended by 500 at the famous Le Moulin de Mougins
restaurant. At the Cinema Against AIDS fund-raiser, guests enjoyed
cocktails, dinner and auction for $2,500 a ticket. The hosts for the
evening were Taylor, Iman, Sharon Stone, Elton John, Harvey Weinstein
and Cannes jury President David Lynch.</LD>
<TE>   The function was attended by Prince Albert of Monaco, AMFAR
founding Chairman Dr. Mathilde Krim, Calvin Klein, Bianca Jagger,
actors Stephen Baldwin, Adrien Brody, Milla Jovovich and Michelle
Yeoh. There were a host of entertainment glitterati and social and
business elite.</TE>
<TE>   Stone was wearing a simple, fitted red Versace pantsuit with a
25-karat diamond DeBeers necklace, which was to be auctioned during
the evening along with a variety of luxury items. Two were described
as "priceless": tennis lessons with Pete Sampras (Prince Albert
outbid Klein, winning the lessons for $100,000) and a 10-minute chat
with Stone on the latest Motorola V70 cell phone, opening at a
minimum bid of $10,000 ($1,000 per minute).</TE>
<TE>   "We started the event 10 years ago and so far have raised $40
million," said Weinstein before the auction. "You've got to step up
in life," he said, "I started from nowhere and you have to give
back."</TE>
<TE>   Iman, who grew up in Somalia, said she became involved in the
cause because of AIDS' growing impact on Africa. "It's reached huge
proportions there and I see this function as an ideal way to raise
world awareness."</TE>
<TE>   Hush-Hush Affair</TE>
<TE>   German supermodel Claudia Schiffer is taking a leaf out of her
friend Madonna's book by opting for privacy over publicity when she
marries British film producer Matthew Vaughn on Saturday. Schiffer,
who at 31 is one of the world's most sought-after models, will wed
Vaughn at their 5-million pound ($7 million) mansion, Coldham Hall,
in Suffolk, England, after a determined bid to keep the details
secret.</TE>
<TE>   International interest in the glamorous couple's nuptials has been
intense, fueled by reports that guests will include stars like
Madonna, Elton John, Brad Pitt and Naomi Campbell.</TE>
<TE>   But the couple are determined to keep their big day private,
hiring a security firm to patrol the grounds of their 500-year-old
home and making everyone involved sign a confidentiality agreement.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the battle for secrecy, some details appear to have leaked
out. The catwalk queen is said to have ordered an ivory silk
Valentino wedding gown and has requested that guests refrain from
wearing white.</TE>

<DH>Pendants, especially handcrafted ones, are lending chic to
casual apparel.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Just when you thought L.A. style was disappearing into a sea of
uniform low-rise jeans and snug-fit sweatsuits, pendants come to the
rescue.</LD>
<LD>   This summer, women are adding a bit of bohemian chic to their
casual ensembles with sculptural ornaments worn 'round the neck.</LD>
<LD>   Some of the most striking pieces are inspired by nature--crosses
and medallions crafted from seashells and bone chips, intricately
hand-painted and decorated with pave crystals.</LD>
<TE>   Other styles incorporate vintage pieces--carved glass flowers or
Native American charms, for example--strung with semiprecious stones.</TE>
<TE>   "Anything that is handcrafted is so 'in' right now," says Chan
Luu, 52, an L.A. jewelry designer who hit it big after Jennifer
Aniston became a fan of her hand-painted shell necklaces. "I bring
personality to each one of my pendants, and people want that," says
Luu, who will open her own store on Robertson Boulevard next month.</TE>
<TE>   Instead of building an outfit around a smart jacket or skirt, many
women are dressing around a special accessory. "You could have on
jeans and a T-shirt, and a beautiful necklace makes all the
difference," says local jewelry designer Robin Woodard, 34, who works
with vintage pendants. Necklaces by Luu and Woodard can cost $100 and
up, but lower-price options are available at Banana Republic,
Rampage, Arden B. and other chain stores. Or, you could make your
own. At Nina at Fred Segal Santa Monica, would-be jewelry artists can
choose from an array of pendants ($25 to $145) and cords or beads to
string them on. Manager Jasmine Naisbitt says Chinese characters and
flower shapes in jade, rose quartz, bone or turquoise are being
snapped up faster than she can stock them.</TE>
<TE>   "If you look at the shows on TV, the 'Sex and the City' girls, for
example, everyone's wearing them," she says. "And what could be
better than making your own?"</TE>

<LD>"What is it?" Mr. DiCosta cracked open the door.</LD>
<LD>   "Can I talk to you, please?" Mark's voice quivered.</LD>
<LD>   "I don't want to talk about trees, especially yours!" Mr. DiCosta
limped outside and waved toward the jacaranda. "Besides the mess,
what if a heavy wind blew branches into my yard? What then, huh?"</LD>
<TE>   On to the next idea, Mark thought.</TE>
<TE>   "Mr. DiCosta," he said, "do you wish you lived someplace else?"</TE>
<TE>   "No. Why?"</TE>
<TE>   "I just thought maybe you felt bummed out, kinda like when you've
lost something, and that's why you're so grouch ... uh, I mean ... "
Mark stopped, feeling stupid.</TE>
<TE>   Then he saw tiny crinkles around the edges of Mr. DiCosta's eyes.</TE>
<TE>   "Well, I do miss my granddaughter, Stacey," Mr. DiCosta said.</TE>
<TE>   "You have a granddaughter named Stacey?"</TE>
<TE>   "Yeah, so?"</TE>
<TE>   "The girl who used to live in your house is named Stacey too! Is
your Stacey's family in the military?"</TE>
<TE>   "No, her dad, my son, works for an oil company. I lived next door
to them and saw her every day. But they moved to Saudi Arabia a
couple of months ago, and I can't call her very often."</TE>
<TE>   "What about e-mail?"</TE>
<TE>   "I don't understand that stuff."</TE>
<TE>   "But it's easy."</TE>
<TE>   "Not for me it isn't. Besides, I don't have a computer."</TE>
<TE>   "You can use mine. Come on. I'll show you." He tugged at his shirt
sleeve. He couldn't believe he was saying this to Mr. DiCosta!</TE>
<TE>   "And, uh, Mr. DiCosta," Mark added, "if you'll leave that
jacaranda alone, next year when the blossoms start falling, I'll come
over every day and rake them up. Then you can e-mail your Stacey
about how great it looks. OK?"</TE>
<TE>   "Son, you have a deal," Mr. DiCosta said.</TE>
<TE>   "Stacey," Mark e-mailed, "the tree is safe, but guess what? Mr.
DiCosta isn't such a mean guy after all. More later. Mark."</TE>

<HD>Promoting an Inflated Sense of Safety</HD>
<DH>States launch an awareness campaign urging drivers to
maintain their cars' tires properly</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DON OLDENBURG</AU>
<BD>WASHINGTON POST</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Pumped up about traveling this Memorial Day? Keep an eye open for the
new public service campaign that state attorneys general and consumer
protection offices launched nationwide Monday. The Safe Tires
Campaign will debut this weekend with TV and radio spots, print ads
and its own Web site (www.safetrip.org) promoting proper tire
maintenance. It will continue during the other two peak summer travel
holidays, the Fourth of July and Labor Day.</LD>
<LD>   "The basic message is very simple: Take care of your tires, and
they will take care of you," says Tennessee Atty. Gen. Paul Summers,
chairman of the Safe Trip Campaign.</LD>
<LD>   What's of particular interest to consumers about this educational
campaign, besides its tire-care pointers, is that the effort is
entirely bankrolled from the $51.5-million Bridgestone/Firestone
settlement forged last November. The giant tire company not only
agreed to pay off states' lawsuits over defective tires and its
misrepresentations in promoting and replacing those tires, but also
to ante up $5 million for a tire safety awareness program.</LD>
<TE>   "As a result of the Bridgestone/Firestone case, we learned a lot
of things about tire inflation," says Summers, adding that just as
tire manufacturers must take responsibility for making sound
products, the public needs to take responsibility for maintaining
them. Tire pressure should be checked once a month.</TE>
<TE>   The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration estimates that
proper tire inflation alone could save 50 to 80 lives and prevent
6,600 to 10,600 injuries each year. "Seriously underinflated or
overinflated tires, even on a well-made tire, can be hazardous to
your health," says Summers. "Add heat and overloading and you have
exacerbated the problem. And that results in blowouts, deterioration
of the tire, injury or death."</TE>
<TE>   Among the campaign's recommendations:</TE>
<TE>   * Use a tire-pressure gauge, available for as little as $3 to $5,
to ensure tires are properly inflated.</TE>
<TE>   * For the most accurate reading, check pressure when tires are
cool.</TE>
<TE>   * Use the automaker's recommended tire pressure--usually printed
on a placard in the doorjamb, inside the fuel-filler door, inside the
glove compartment door or in the owner's manual.</TE>
<TE>   * Perform a monthly tread check: Stick a penny in the grooves of
your tire with Lincoln's head toward the tread. If you can see the
top of Lincoln's head from the side, you need new tires.</TE>

<HD>A Golden Age Gleams Anew in 'Komediant'</HD>
<DH>Chronicling fDocumentary about the first family of early
20th- century Yiddish theater, the film sparkles with the the wisdom
and humor of its subjects.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KEVIN THOMAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Arnon Goldfinger's emotion-charged documentary "The Komediant"
manages to be succinct yet comprehensive, a bittersweet saga about
the performing Burstein family and a chronicle of the golden age of
the Yiddish theater. It abounds in the humor and wisdom of its
participants, which include such stalwarts of the Yiddish theater as
Fyvush Finkel and Shifra Lerer. The range of its unique film clips is
astonishing.</LD>
<LD>   The patriarch of the family, Pesach'ke Burstein (1896-1986), was
born in Warsaw. Raised in Berdiansk, Russia, he ran away from home at
15 to join a traveling Yiddish theatrical troupe, never again to see
his parents, who were subsequently killed in a pogrom. By 1924
Burstein had made such a name for himself that Bores Tomashefsky, a
legendary pioneer of the Yiddish theater in America, brought him to
New York. In addition to acting, Burstein was a debonair
song-and-dance man in the manner of Maurice Chevalier, and he had a
special gift: whistling. He even recorded his friend Al Jolson's
"Sonny Boy" in Yiddish the same day, in the same studio and with the
same orchestra that Jolson had just used.</LD>
<TE>   Burstein soon became an international star of the Yiddish theater.
In the late '30s he met the vivacious blond performer Lillian Lux,
who at 16 was 22 years his junior. They soon married, entering into
an enduring personal and professional partnership. (No sooner had the
couple boarded the last ship out of Poland, where they had been
engaged for the 1939-'40 season in Warsaw, than Germany invaded.)
When the Bursteins' twins, Mike and Susan, turned 7, they joined the
family act. In the postwar years the Bursteins toured constantly,
traveling almost everywhere there was a Yiddish-speaking community.
(The film gets its title from a popular play the family performed in
during that time.)</TE>
<TE>   As close-knit as the family was, Susan wanted out by the time she
reached her teens, and at 18 married a man 15 years her senior. The
marriage was a success, and Susan got the conventional home life she
craved so badly. Eager to establish his own identity beyond the
dwindling world of the Yiddish theater, Mike soon followed Susan in
striking out on his own, establishing an international acting and
singing career that not only brought him major stardom in Israel but
even found him playing the title role in "Barnum" on Broadway.</TE>
<TE>   Clearly, the children's determination to pursue their own lives
and careers placed a great strain on their parents, who were soon to
discover that in the dwindling days of the Yiddish theater they could
not continue performing their venerable repertoire without the
youthful drawing card of their charismatic son.</TE>
<TE>   A sense of irony permeates "The Komediant" in that it is
confounding to realize just how famous the Bursteins became in
far-flung Yiddish-speaking communities while remaining largely
unknown outside it. The film's fortuitous point of departure is a
revival in Israel, to mark the centennial of Pesach'ke's birth, of
the Bursteins' greatest hit, "A Village Wedding," starring Mike in
his father's role and playing opposite Lillian. Goldfinger does not
make a point of it, but it is impossible to watch this warm,
wonderful film without becoming aware of the enormous impact the
Yiddish theater has had on every aspect of American show business.</TE>

<HD>Serious Issues by the Sea</HD>
<DH>Israeli and Palestinian films make politics an issue at the
festival.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RACHEL ABRAMOWITZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>CANNES, France</DL>
<LD>Film festivals don't usually rank with Oslo or Camp David as
milestones on the path to peace, but this year the Cannes Film
Festival is rife not only with the usual jury politicking, but with
films bursting with real-life politics.</LD>
<LD>   When announcing the festival lineup, artistic director Thierry
Fremaux made a point of saying it was presenting a Palestinian film,
"Divine Intervention," and also an Israeli one, "Kedma," as a step
toward peace.</LD>
<LD>   "The one thing that remains liberated and free is the
imagination," says "Divine Intervention" star and director Elia
Suleiman, whose film is the first Palestinian movie ever in
competition here.</LD>
<TE>   Sprinkled throughout the main competition and several side
competitions are films about anti-globalization protests and Algerian
terrorists, as well as "Bowling for Columbine," Michael Moore's
documentary about America's love affair with the gun, and "Ararat,"
Atom Egoyan's revelatory examination of the Armenian genocide by the
Turks in 1915 and how its whitewashing out of history affects a young
Canadian Armenian. Turkey officially denies that the genocide of more
than a million Armenians happened. The film has been the subject of
Internet-bred fury, and rumors of an incipient Turkish boycott have
been brewing.</TE>
<TE>   Political concerns extended to the festival as well. Responding to
international fears of terrorism--and recent acts of anti-Semitic
violence in France--security at the festival has been tighter this
year than in the past, with police checking bags at the main venues
and using bomb-sniffing dogs at the railway stations. Crowds were
lighter than usual, but observers attributed this to a slow economy
rather than terrorism jitters.</TE>
<TE>   Journalists from around the world who gathered here peppered
filmmakers with political questions, often repeatedly when some
artists, such as Israel's Amos Gitai or Egoyan, refused to be drawn
into the fray, preferring to speak through their work. Even Woody
Allen, determinedly apolitical throughout more than 30 years of
filmmaking, was asked about his sentiments on the Middle East and
violence against Jews in France, presumably because he is famously
Jewish. His noncommittal answer was criticized by the American Jewish
Congress.</TE>
<TE>   One might expect a cacophony of different voices from the
disparate films, but they tend to conform to pro-Palestinian
sentiment in France. Yet, unlike Hollywood studio products, the films
here attempt to provoke and entertain, to seize back political
discourse from the monotone clutches of CNN and show the effects of
politics and history on the human spirit.</TE>
<TE>   Absurdist Humor in a Palestinian Film</TE>
<TE>   "Divine Intervention" is dotted with inspired flights of fancy and
absurdist humor--a casually thrown peach pit explodes an Israeli
tank, and a flying Palestinian ninja girl, complete with Yasser
Arafat-style head scarf, takes on Israeli soldiers who wield their
Uzis with the grace and synchronization of Busby Berkeley dancers.</TE>
<TE>   Hany Abu-Assad, director of another Palestinian film being shown
here (though not in competition) called "Rana's Wedding," said that
"when we make more culture, we'll make less bullets." Like Suleiman,
Abu-Assad uses the military checkpoints between Ramallah and Israel
as a prime motif in his movie, which is about a young woman whose
father arbitrarily demands she marry that day, setting off her ardent
quest to find a lover in the next 10 hours. The $600,000 film--any
profits will go back to what's left of the Palestinian Ministry of
Culture--sets the appealing heroine's middle-class marital
aspirations and ambivalences against the difficulties of life in East
Jerusalem and what Abu-Assad portrays as the day-to-day harshness of
the Israeli government.</TE>
<TE>   "When the occupation becomes daily life, normal life becomes
fiction," Abu-Assad says. "You have to do a lot of things to make
your life go on."</TE>
<TE>   Suleiman says that absurdist humor happens to be a key component
of his sensibility, but he adds, "There's a tragic element that
exists in my country, so people don't assume a sense of humor is part
of it. But people have a very short memory circuit. In concentration
camps, some of the best humor was invented by the Jews. Why is it
immoral? That's one way of self-relief from the burden of death."</TE>
<TE>   Director Amos Kitai's "Kedma," by contrast, is a somewhat
polemical tale about the founding of Israel. A group of refugees from
the Holocaust disembark from a boat from Europe and almost
immediately take up arms against what Kitai depicts as defenseless
Palestinians. "Israel is a country completely composed of displaced
people, the Jews who were displaced from Europe and North Africa and
the Palestinians who were displaced by the Israelis," Kitai says.
"That is the tragedy but also the potential."</TE>
<TE>   Kitai is Israel's most prolific and well-known filmmaker. His
left-wing politics have made him a controversial figure, and during
the '80s he even went into self-imposed exile in Paris, which ended
when Yitzhak Rabin's minister of culture urged him to come home.</TE>
<TE>   For Kitai, filmmaking is a needed corrective to what he calls "the
television series which is called the evening news," a kind of
long-running soap opera in which "one day the bad would be the
Palestinians and the Israelis are angelic, and the next day it would
be the opposite. We're getting tired of playing the roles of extras
in this kind of scripted TV series which helps to sell washing
machines during the commercial breaks."</TE>
<TE>   Filmmaker Distrusts Historical Dramas</TE>
<TE>   For Egoyan, history--and its representation--is disturbingly
subjective, a fact that can lead to denial, which is the true theme
of his film "Ararat."</TE>
<TE>   He is by nature distrustful of historical dramas like "Schindler's
List." "My problem with those movies is they try and create something
that's so arresting that you can't help but feel it's absolutely
true," Egoyan says. "I'm by nature suspicious of the images presented
to me. Any representation has to be carefully considered. I always
think these things that end up moving us are the things that are
slightly more abstract, that aren't literal."</TE>
<TE>   A potent, original voice, Egoyan has a following in the U.S.
mainly from his transcendent 1997 film, "The Sweet Hereafter."
Difficult to summarize, "Ararat" tells the story of Raffi, a
production assistant on a film about the Armenian genocide. He is
stopped on his way back from Turkey by a customs official
(Christopher Plummer) suspicious of his sealed film cans. "Ararat"
shifts through time, and features a film within a film as well as an
interlude about Armenian painter Arshile Gorky and two disparate
families trying to reconcile and connect despite their personal paths
of denial.</TE>
<TE>   At the news conference after the film, a Turkish journalist and
film festival programmer proudly declared he was going to invite the
film to be screened at the Istanbul film festival. But afterward, he
told Egoyan privately that he would have to cut two scenes of vicious
Turkish violence before the film could be shown. The official Turkish
explanation is that violence in the region was a result of World War
I and that many people died on both sides.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the controversy swirling around his film, Egoyan is leery
of reducing it to a simple political document. "I think the political
statement is that denial affects people and these issues persist, but
those are human statements," he says, although he adds, "There's a
political statement being made in that it ascertains to me what is an
empirical fact. There's no issue about the genocide. None. This
question of fairness--hearing both sides of the story--is basically
Turkish propaganda. They're able to manipulate that, and it
infuriates me. No one would dare go to a German person and say,
'What's your perspective?'"</TE>
<TE>   Egoyan adds that art plays an important role in healing the
trauma. "Creation is the savior. If someone is desecrated, you
respond by creating something that's sacred. You create art. You look
at what's happening in Cambodia because they can't create art about
their genocide. The people who did it are still in power. It's the
creative impulse which gives hope."</TE>
<TE>   Both Egoyan and Moore are established filmmakers, and theirs are
the only politically minded films with U.S. distribution in place.</TE>
<TE>   Suleiman's first film, "Chronicle of a Disappearance" (1996), did
play in the United States, and he hopes his second one will too. "The
problem will not be the American spectators," the director says. "It
will be the [courage] of the distributor. Many places will be scared
to show a film like that even if they thought it was good."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, while the political films at Cannes reflect French
sensibilities, the ones that arrive in Los Angeles will undoubtedly
reflect American ones. Miramax financed "Ararat" at the script stage
and will be releasing the film stateside.</TE>
<TE>   Just before he entered the "Ararat" premiere in Cannes, Miramax
Chairman Harvey Weinstein fumed about the Turkish reaction. "They're
trying to lobby in Washington. They're getting all upset. They're
saying ... the whole movies is a PR thing. It never happened. What
are they talking about? They're denying history. To me, the denial of
the Armenian holocaust reminded me of the denial of our own Jewish
Holocaust. I feel strongly about that."</TE>

<HD>Pop Till You Drop</HD>
<DH>MOCA fills its galleries with an intelligently mounted
retrospective of Andy Warhol's work that underscores his true calling
as a revolutionary.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRISTOPHER KNIGHT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In February 1972, Richard Nixon went to China. Our
cold-warrior-in-chief made nice with the Communist dictator. The trip
was a media triumph.</LD>
<LD>   Not long after Nixon's journey, Andy Warhol (1928-1987) began a
series of portraits of Mao Tse-tung (Mao Zedong in China's current
Pinyin spelling). They range from monumental canvases, some nearly 15
feet tall, to yards of wallpaper whose pattern endlessly repeats the
chairman's placid face. Warhol was an artist who knew a good bit
about mass media.</LD>
<LD>   In the magnificent retrospective exhibition opening Saturday at
the Museum of Contemporary Art, his Mao still packs a wallop.</LD>
<TE>   The silk-screen paintings are based on the famous photograph used
in the frontispiece to the Chinese leader's Little Red Book of
revolutionary sayings. Warhol gave Mao the same make-over of lush
color, off-register highlights and general theatrical dazzle that he
applied to Marilyn Monroe, Jackie Kennedy and Elizabeth Taylor in the
1960s. There was just one appreciable difference.</TE>
<TE>   Mao was more famous. Leader of a nation whose population
approached 700 million souls, he was instantly recognizable to more
people than even Marilyn, Jackie or Liz. Warhol's last great suite of
paintings consecrated the ultimate celebrity. Popular culture got an
indelible, revolutionary poster boy--and that fellow was as much
Warhol as Mao. Nixon was opening the door to China, and Warhol was
the first one through it.</TE>
<TE>   Today, a couple of generations after the fact, it can be difficult
to recognize just how revolutionary were Warhol's paintings of
celebrities, tabloid newspapers and commercial products like
Campbell's soup. By 1960, when he began the work that established him
as one of the most important artists of the 20th century, avant-garde
art was the bitter enemy of pop culture. The very form of avant-garde
art had been established in direct opposition to it. A concept of
high culture, which derived from European intellectual tradition,
required a reciprocal idea of low culture in order to exist.</TE>
<TE>   Warhol obliterated the distinction. Culture wasn't high or low,
his Pop art baldly asserted. Culture's products were thrilling or
boring, powerful or numb, illuminating or degrading, imbecilic or
smart, resonant or thin, beautiful or ugly, good or bad--and
sometimes both at once. Making the argument is what mattered.</TE>
<TE>   In the modern history of world culture, the rejection of a
categorical division between high and low was a singular contribution
of American democracy. Warhol's art declared this truth to be
self-evident.</TE>
<TE>   At MOCA, the story of how he did it unfolds in a knockout display.
The show is big--more than 250 paintings, drawings, sculptures and
prints--and it occupies every gallery of the museum.</TE>
<TE>   Happily playing against today's depressing museum norm, the show
includes not one didactic wall label in any gallery, beyond a
four-paragraph introduction at the start. (Useful information is
available in an auditorium lobby display downstairs, and naturally
there is an optional audio tour. My advice: See the show first, then
get the audio tour if you must.)</TE>
<TE>   Warhol's art is not about reading text and promoting the primacy
of ideas; it's about the persuasive power of visual excitement.
Warhol sure had it, and the exhibition wisely defers.</TE>
<TE>   Two things you should know about Warhol: He was hugely successful
as a commercial artist in the advertising world of the 1950s, and he
was gay. Sexuality plays a critical role in the work of many artists,
from Michelangelo to Cathy Opie, and homosexuality is central to
Warhol's art.</TE>
<TE>   Homosexuality was to American society what commercial pop culture
was to American avant-garde art: an object of ridicule and contempt.
Warhol, having lived the cruel failure of America's promise of
freedom and equality, could physically embody the condition in his
work.</TE>
<TE>   The first paintings in the exhibition show him trying to sort
things out. In 1960 and 1961, he painted canvases that attempt to
parody Abstract Expressionism of the 1950s. A pair of paintings based
on newspaper advertisements for a gas water heater and a refrigerator
together picture the emotional range of Expressionist art, from
passionate heat to icy frigidity. Elsewhere, a medical ad for hernia
relief meditates on the anguish of internal pain, while a comic book
Superman displays explosive heroic power.</TE>
<TE>   These and other such depictions of the period's reigning artistic
cliches are executed in drippy, scribbled oil, casein, wax and
crayon. The mark of the artist's hand is emphasized. A large
selection of drawings from the 1950s, many of them made for
commercial advertising projects, show that Warhol wasn't especially
adept as a draftsman. (Most are contour drawings, some made by
tracing; stylistically they recall the work of Jean Cocteau.) But he
understood graphic punch. That acute discernment continues in the
paintings.</TE>
<TE>   "The artist's hand" was of course another period cliche--perhaps
the biggest one of all. Oddly, though, the pairing of unique
brushwork and commercial imagery undercuts these paintings' power. In
the contest between the avant-garde and kitsch, Warhol first tried to
use "their" technique to render "his" images of "their" subject
matter. The result is more pastiche than parody.</TE>
<TE>   In 1962 he dispensed with the handmade look of Abstract
Expressionism--and his paintings took off. Using found photographs
and a silk-screen process meant that he could emphasize a mechanical
sense of mass production. Mass-media pictures and frankly commercial
methods entered the privileged space of painting.</TE>
<TE>   Suddenly, he was using "his" technique to render "his" images of
"their" subject matter. Warhol overwhelmed the established
avant-garde.</TE>
<TE>   The visual effect is simultaneously aggressive and seductive,
splashy yet indifferent. Their mechanical quality yields a surface
that is cool and aloof, even as Warhol's carefully chosen color is
always sensually indulgent. These are paintings that make great
backdrops, perfect for casual perusal during the course of a party,
while also rewarding close scrutiny.</TE>
<TE>   Warhol (or his assistants) put down the color first, in broad,
flat, hard-edged shapes. Then he screened the photographic print on
top, usually in black but sometimes in another color.</TE>
<TE>   Often the under-painting and the screened image are off-register.
When the image is repeated in a horizontal row, the repetitions tend
to overlap. When they make a grid, it's almost never exactly square.
Ink is distributed unevenly, creating blotches, blurs and streaks.
It's the kind of printing job a commercial client would reject.</TE>
<TE>   In short, everything about these paintings, from their pop culture
subjects to the mechanized way they are made, declares itself to be
deeply, fundamentally wrong. The freedom to be wrong is a core
American value--and Warhol's paintings are its first great public
celebration in 200 years of American art.</TE>
<TE>   The retrospective was organized by Berlin's New National
Gallery--nearly a third of the work comes from public and private
collections in Germany--and MOCA is its only American venue.</TE>
<TE>   The show is appropriately weighted toward Warhol's revolutionary
work of the 1960s. More than 120 of the paintings and drawings were
made during that extraordinarily productive decade, while only half
that number date from between 1970 and his death in 1987. (He
succumbed to complications following routine gall bladder surgery.)
About 70 drawings from the 1950s complete the array.</TE>
<TE>   One omission is a shocker. New York's Museum of Modern Art refused
to lend the 1962 suite of 32 paintings of Campbell's soup cans now in
its permanent collection. (Several other versions of the icon are on
view.)</TE>
<TE>   July marks the 40th anniversary of these paintings' debut, in a
legendary show at the Ferus Gallery on La Cienega Boulevard. That
show launched Warhol's career. The artist loved the tabloids--he even
started one about celebrities, called Andy Warhol's Interview--so
perhaps the best way to characterize the arrogance of the snub is
with a blaring headline: "MOMA to MOCA: Drop Dead!"</TE>
<TE>   The absence of the soup cans isn't fatal to the survey, given the
abundance of other major pieces. But it's rather like a De Kooning
retrospective without "Woman I." A hole is torn in the show, a
pivotal moment for art erased.</TE>
<TE>   In the classic "Self-Portraits" from 1966-67, Warhol showed
himself half in shadow with head in hand, two fingers across his
lips. The sphinx-like pose is standard iconography for intellectual
thought and discernment--think Rodin's "The Thinker"--wherein the
artist makes a sly, knowing gesture against those who dismissed him
as a shallow poseur. I may be a pop jester, these self-portraits say,
but I'm nobody's fool.</TE>
<TE>   And of course he wasn't. Sex and violence are the dominant motifs
of his art, because sex and violence are dominant motifs of mass
media (and, historically, of painting). This makes for a malleable
art of continuously shifting resonance. After the explosive AIDS
epidemic, Warhol's death and disaster images resonated one way.
Post-Sept. 11, they resonate another.</TE>
<TE>   At MOCA, a poignant moment comes amid morbid paintings of car
crashes, suicides and race riots. Suddenly, the presence of big bold
paintings of colorful hibiscus flowers assumes a valedictory air.</TE>
<TE>   As much as in any 17th century Dutch floral piece, in which lush
blossoms remind us of fragile vanity and the inevitability of death,
Warhol's flowers have become a touching pop meditation on joyfulness,
transience and human mortality. Like all great paintings, his will
continue to press themselves into our consciousness in ways we can't
yet even imagine.</TE>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Alto saxophonist Greg Osby has never hesitated to dip into eclectic
areas of music to enhance his already adventurous jazz explorations.
Hip-hop, funk and free jazz have all attracted him at one point or
another since his involvement with Manhattan's edgy M-Base musical
collective in the late '80s.</LD>
<LD>   On Wednesday night at the Jazz Bakery, however, Osby's playing
sounded well integrated and thoughtful--a level up from the sometimes
stylistically scattered performances he has offered in the past.</LD>
<LD>   Working with longtime associate Jason Moran on piano, the
dependable Robert Hurst on bass and the supportive Damion Reid on
percussion, Osby typically moved in seamless fashion from one
selection to another. At one point, a long, modally driven cadenza,
alternating dark, low-register sounds with sudden bursts of melodic
filigree, was followed by a lyrical rendering of the standard "Here's
That Rainy Day," which then gave way to a brutally high-speed boppish
line.</LD>
<TE>   Despite the differences in style and substance, Osby's
front-and-center playing pulled everything together with impressive
ease. His most immediately accessible characteristic--a warm,
engaging sound--was essential, providing the listener with a
comfortable passageway into the most fiery improvisational passages.
Equally important, the clarity of Osby's lines in the faster-paced
segments was enormously enhanced by his virtuosic ability to
articulate every note with clarity and focus.</TE>
<TE>   Although Moran claimed only a modest amount of solo space, he made
the most of it, usually relying upon a vigorously two-handed,
rhapsodic style, enriching the fundamental harmonies of various songs
with lush chordal clusters spiced with unexpected but appealing
dissonance. As he so often does, Hurst, who seems capable of finding
precisely the right backing for any style and any upfront soloist,
made his most striking contributions as an accompanist. And Reid--a
bit clattery on his soloing (not surprising in the Bakery's
acoustically challenged space)--made a good fit with Hurst in terms
of swing and rhythmic drive.</TE>
<TE>   The Greg Osby Quartet at the Jazz Bakery, 3233 Helms Ave., Culver
City. Tonight through Sunday at 8 and 9:30 p.m. $25. (310) 271- 9039.</TE>

<HD>Wife Gives Abusive Husband Just Deserts?</HD>
<DH>'Enough' sports the reckless premise that abused women
should kill their tormentors. Think J-Lo as Charles Bronson.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAN STUART</AU>
<BD>NEWSDAY</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Wife beaters with large bank accounts are above the law. Abused
wives, especially those who used to work for tips, are toast. The
only recourse for these women is to change their identity, muscle up
and kill the bum.</LD>
<LD>   This is not the only simplistic notion that drives "Enough," the
preposterous new Jennifer Lopez rabble-rouser. It is merely the most
reckless, particularly at a time when more abused women are giving up
on The System and polishing their aim at rifle ranges. J-Lo's
gal-power endorsement of the Charles Bronson, go-it-alone method of
problem-solving encourages a more modified approach, at very least:
Put those guns away, enroll in a "Crouching Tiger, Hidden
Dragon"-Made-Easy tutorial and put your body into it. But kill the
bum, all the same.</LD>
<LD>   The first job for screenwriter Nicholas Kazan in such a
single-minded assignment is to close all exit doors so that the
heroine has no other way out. No one can ultimately help ex-waitress
Slim (Lopez) when her wealthy husband Mitch (Billy Campbell) begins
to punch her out and sleep with some French woman (whom he calls "my
little croissant"). The best friend (Juliette Lewis) tries, the sweet
ex-boyfriend (Dan Futterman) tries, the fat-cat father who abandoned
her as a baby (Fred Ward) throws money at her. All to little avail.</LD>
<TE>   The second job for Kazan is to finesse as many holes as quickly as
possible. We are not to ask why Mitch resorts to an elaborate
practical joke to seduce Slim, we are not to ask why this loving dad
suddenly turns into voodoo husband after five years, we are not to
ask why Slim doesn't walk after the first savage punch. This is what
victimized women do, even those as self-aware and self-respecting as
Slim.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, we infer those qualities, as the star is self-aware,
self-respecting Jennifer Lopez. There is little attempt in the
opening scenes to establish what kind of women Slim actually is, or
precisely why a millionaire who could have the best croissant and
brioche that money can buy needs this poor little empanada so
desperately. And while we're busy projecting the star's je ne sais
quoi onto an underwritten character, does anyone buy this pugnacious
glamour gal as a defenseless homemaker to begin with?</TE>
<TE>   Lacking a real actress, director Michael Apted is called upon to
fudge the facts and make Slim's ordeal as taut as possible. He gets
the job done, but the suspense scenes have a generic
fright-by-numbers feel that tell us he's wearing his professional hat
and knows it.</TE>
<TE>   "Enough" is a dangerous title to give the millionth airhead movie
about a wife in distress who resorts to desperate measures.</TE>
<TE>   Still, for the mob that screamed "Do it!" as Lopez held a marble
block over her antagonist's head, two-syllable responses may be as
much as anyone should have to muster.</TE>
<TE>   MPAA rating: PG-13 for intense scenes of domestic violence, some
sensuality and language. Times guidelines: Leave the children at home
or find something more suitable for them.</TE>

<HD>New Anthologies Series Offers Cuts Hand-Picked by Artists</HD>

<LD>Ask most jazz artists what they think of the various reissues and
"best of" recordings associated with their names, and you'll usually
get muted enthusiasm, at best. The complaints can be both predictable
and understandable: This or that important session was omitted; the
popular stuff took precedence over more creative efforts; alternate
takes--originally omitted because they weren't good enough--should
have been left out. And so on.</LD>
<LD>   Last year, RCA/Bluebird made the singular decision to take a
different approach by releasing a five-CD boxed set--"Artie Shaw:
Self Portrait"--with tracks chosen by the veteran clarinetist, band
leader and author himself, who offers fascinating commentary about
each. The result was an insightful view of an important American
musical career.</LD>
<LD>   ECM is now expanding that concept with a new series labeled the
rarum anthology project.  More than 30 musicians who have been
associated with the European label were asked to participate. The
first eight volumes are being released this week; a second group
follows in the fall, with more scheduled for 2003.</LD>
<TE>   The initial group includes albums by Keith Jarrett, Chick Corea,
Gary Burton, Bill Frisell, Jan Garbarek, the Art Ensemble of Chicago,
Terje Rypdal and Bobo Stenson. Many of the choices are fascinating.</TE>
<TE>   Jarrett, at first reluctant to do the project, writes in his
program notes that he proceeded once he "suddenly" began to remember
possible selections, quickly achieving a "vivid idea of what had to
be included to direct the listener's attention to recordings that
either have been, in my opinion, heard less than I feel is their due,
or have escaped recent awareness."</TE>
<TE>   He assembled a double-CD album including material from his
standards trio, his European Quartet (with Garbarek and others), and
a wide selection from his solo piano improvisations (including a
segment from a 1981 Munich program that is released on CD for the
first time). Less expected are selections in which he plays organ
("Hymn of Remembrance" in its first CD appearance), clavichord,
soprano saxophone, flute and other instruments (mostly from his 1985
"Spirits" tapes).</TE>
<TE>   Corea's collection emphasizes his work with Return to Forever, his
duets with Burton, and the superb collaborations with Miroslav Vitous
and Roy Haynes--the latter via spontaneous improvisations and what he
describes as the "pure fun" of Thelonious Monk songs. "This
collection could be a study in Spiritual Chemistry," Corea notes.
"The music rings with my favorite associations: compatriots and
friends in Making Music."</TE>
<TE>   Burton elected to focus on his working bands from the '70s through
the '80s--in the process providing illuminating views of the early
development of guitarist Pat Metheny and pianist Makoto Ozone.
Frisell's colorful group of selections encompasses performances with
the bands of Garbarek, Paul Motian, Paul Bley and Kenny Wheeler.</TE>
<TE>   Garbarek's double CD album includes one disc devoted to
collaborations (with Jarrett's Quartet, Ralph Towner's Solstice,
etc.) and a second disc of his recordings as a leader.</TE>
<TE>   The Art Ensemble recordings--from the late '70s and early
'80s--feature selections from the recordings "Nice Guys," "Full
Force," "Urban Bushmen" and "The Third Decade," as well as selections
from outings by Lester Bowie and Roscoe Mitchell. The Rypdal and
Stenson collections offer compelling glimpses into the too little
acknowledged (in this country) sophistication of European jazz, and
the intriguing results that have flowed from its interface with
American players such as Don Cherry, Charles Lloyd and Billy Hart.</TE>
<TE>   New Carmen: Well, not exactly new, but either never before heard
on a commercial recording or never before available on CD. I'm
referring to a sudden, unexpected cornucopia of material from Carmen
McRae: "Carmen McRae at Ratsos," which comes in two volumes (on
Hitchcock Media), and "Bittersweet" (Koch Jazz).</TE>
<TE>   The former, which consists of two separately sold CDs, includes
material recorded live in 1976 at a tiny Chicago club. The program is
extraordinarily diverse, embracing songs such as Bill Withers' "Paint
Your Pretty Picture With a Song," James Taylor's "Music" and Stevie
Wonder's "You and I," as well as an Ellington medley, standards such
as "My Old Flame" and offbeat items such as Jimmy Rowles' "Ballad of
Thelonious Monk" and Blossom Dearie's "Hey, John." McRae's unerring
musicality is in every selection, adapting stylistically to the
differing demands in phrasing, superbly articulating each line,
telling the stories while remaining firmly in touch with her
essential jazz roots.</TE>
<TE>   "Bittersweet," recorded in 1964, displays a bit less artistically
mature McRae working on a stunning collection of ballads familiar
("If You Could See Me Now," "Here's That Rainy Day") as well as less
well known (Norman Simmons' "If You Could Love Me," Otis Rene Jr.'s
"I'm Lost"). Although the readings don't quite reach inside the songs
in the fashion of the Ratsos performances, there's no denying the
appeal of McRae's luminous alto and her irresistible sense of swing.</TE>
<TE>   Fair warning: Tickets for the 45th annual Monterey Jazz Festival,
Sept. 20-22, are selling at a record pace. That's not surprising,
given that this year's event features Michael Brecker and Brad
Mehldau with the Charlie Haden Special Project; Christian McBride
dueting with Dave Brubeck; Byron Stripling, Roy Hargrove and Lizz
Wright in a staged performance of "The Real Ambassadors"; new
ensembles led by Hargrove and Joshua Redman; and dozens of
others--Nancy Wilson and Ramsey Lewis, the Mingus Big Band, the Heath
Brothers, the Randy Weston Sextet, etc.--on the festival's five
stages of continual entertainment.</TE>
<TE>   The good news is that tickets are still available for the Arena
Stage, which is where all the major acts appear, as well as "grounds"
passes that allow entry into all the other performing areas.</TE>
<TE>   Information: (925) 275-9255 or on the Web at www.montereyjazz
festival.org.</TE>
<TE>   Woodstock on the Central Coast: The area around the arts-oriented
community of Cambria is beginning to resemble--at least in
spirit--the music-enriched environs of New York's Hudson Valley towns
around Woodstock. In Cambria, as well as Woodstock, jazz plays a
surprisingly important role in the creative life of the region.
Tonight through Sunday is a display of how rapidly that role is
expanding: Cambria Jazz 2002, the Central Coast's first jazz
festival.</TE>
<TE>   Vibist Charlie Shoemake and his singer-wife, Sandi--who have
played a major role in bringing music to the community via their
Famous Artists Jazz Series--will perform Sunday. Other participants
include Frankie Capp and the Juggernaut Big Band, singer Spanky
Wilson, saxophonist Red Holloway, and about 20 other bands, mostly
from Cambria, the Central Coast, Bakersfield and Santa Barbara.</TE>
<TE>   "Lucky us," festival producer Rebecca Buckley says. "We have world
class [musicians] right here in our own backyard, many of whom have
fled the cities to escape the congestion and the fast pace."</TE>
<TE>   Cambria Jazz 2002 programs take place in nearly a dozen venues,
with events scheduled today from 5 p.m. to midnight and Saturday and
Sunday from noon to midnight. Three-day, all-venue tickets are $50;
tickets today and Sunday only are $30; Saturday-only tickets are $35.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Chris Smith's "Home Movie" is an engaging documentary about people
who live in unusual homes. They are decidedly individualists, rather
than kooky or bizarre, whose dwellings creatively reflect their
lifestyles and passions.</LD>
<LD>   Smith's two previous documentaries were also distinctive:
"American Job" (1995), about what it's like to do menial work for a
living; and, directed with Sarah Price, "American Movie" (1999),
about the making of a low-low-budget horror picture in a small town.</LD>
<LD>   Bill Tregle and Linda Beech both live close to nature but in
different ways. Tregle is a burly, good-ol'-boy type with a Cajun
accent who lives aboard an unpretentious but well-organized, highly
functional houseboat in a Louisiana bayou.</LD>
<TE>   A psychologist who in her teen years starred in a Japanese TV
show, Beech has long lived in an elegant, contemporary-style home,
complete with treehouse and waterfall, deep in a magnificent Hawaiian
rain forest. Ed and Diana Peden's abode represents a pinnacle of
recycling. The Pedens transformed an abandoned missile silo outside
Topeka, Kan., into a remarkably comfortable home topped by a
spacious, sunny room they call a greenhouse that enables them not to
spend all their time indoors underground.</TE>
<TE>   These homeowners share a spiritual kinship with their dwellings,
and the same could be said for Ben Skora, who over the years has
transformed a Sears prefab house in suburban Chicago into a kind of
'50s Space Age dream house, loaded with electric gadgetry.</TE>
<TE>   Bob Walker and Frances Mooney do not regret having spent $10,000
remodeling their California home to accommodate their beloved 11 cats
with special walkways and nooks and crannies. Their modifications are
well-designed and the house has an appealing playhouse quality.</TE>
<TE>   There is something reassuring in seeing free-thinking individuals
express their personalities so emphatically yet invitingly in the
places they live.</TE>
<TE>   Accompanying "Home Movie" is a 17-minute film shot in 1986 by Jeff
Krulik and John Heyn, now film and TV veterans. "Heavy Metal Parking
Lot" was videotaped in the parking lot of the Capital Centre arena in
Largo, Md., before a Judas Priest concert. Made as a joke, it has
taken on a life of its own over the years. Krulik and Heyn simply
allowed the Priest fans to be themselves. They are primarily young,
lower-class white males, high on drink or drugs, in a rowdy,
high-spirited mood. As a slice of Americana, "Heavy Metal Parking
Lot" offers a nifty contrast to "Home Movie."</TE>
<TE>   Unrated. Times guidelines: "Home Movie" is suitable for all ages;
"Heavy Metal Parking Lot" depicts the effects of considerable amounts
of alcohol and marijuana, sprinkled with four-letter words.</TE>

<HD>Remarkable 'Memoriam' Defines Sept. 11</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Howard Rosenberg</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a month when television is loaded with nostalgia, here's an encore
that won't remind anyone of "Laverne &amp; Shirley."</LD>
<LD>   HBO will recognize Memorial Day on Sunday with a remarkable film
about New York that embraces the entire nation. If ever one
documentary earned space in a time capsule to capture an agonizing
moment in U.S. life, this defining work is it.</LD>
<LD>   It's a clear, intimate window to Sept. 11 and its aftermath, from
horror expressed by pedestrians as the World Trade Center's twin
towers take lethal hits from hijacked jets and then collapse, to the
hour's closing lump in the throat with Irving Berlin asking God to
bless America.</LD>
<TE>   Such retrospectives are arriving in swarms, of course, along with
warnings of terrorists possibly targeting other Big Apple landmarks.
"In Memoriam: New York City, 9/11/01" rises from that blur. It's
impassioned, heartbreaking and honest. It's everything a remembrance
of the devastating terrorist attack should be, in fact, while calling
back for a bow someone who awoke that Tuesday as a controversial lame
duck mayor, about to be flushed from office by term limits, and went
to bed as St. Rudy.</TE>
<TE>   However often this terrible history is rerun--with mention of that
day's satellite terrorist violence near the Pentagon and aboard a jet
that crashed in Pennsylvania--the hurt never abates. It resurfaces
here in a film that is short but shattering, gingerly walking a high
wire of emotion without toppling into gratuitous gore or maudlin
exploitation, despite being massaged by aching music from great
American composers.</TE>
<TE>   Its views of this calamity are citywide. They come from Brooklyn
Heights and Long Island. They come from Albany Street, from West
Street, from John Street, from Desbrosses Street, from Park Row, from
Grand Street. And from Hizzoner himself.</TE>
<TE>   There is no narrator. Yet former New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani
is heard frequently in a voice-over ("I was told that apparently a
plane had hit") and seen in news footage ever on the move through
cratered ruins that day, an urban phoenix symbolizing his city's
immortality.</TE>
<TE>   "We shouldn't go there," an aide warns through a dust mask at one
point in the mayor's tour of death and rubble. Maskless and ever
impulsive, Giuliani is swiftly off in another direction: "All right,
let's go north then."</TE>
<TE>   It's no wonder thank-yous would soon come at Giuliani like debris
blown from the twin towers. If you've forgotten why, this film from
Brad Grey Pictures provides a sense of his inspirational magic.</TE>
<TE>   On the screen are New Yorkers around a car radio beaming
Giuliani's calming words of assurance and encouragement as enormous
columns of smoke rise from the depleted skyline behind them.</TE>
<TE>   Here, also, is the mayor at a news conference, saying, "We're
stronger than those barbarians." It's a message he'll repeat again
and again with conviction and authority in restrained plainspeak that
lifts him far above the rest of officialdom.</TE>
<TE>   Epic events sometimes yield unlikely giants. This was the same
Giuliani, after all, whom many had found so terminally abrasive that
even being diagnosed with cancer could not soften his image. He was
the same mayor who enraged free-expression advocates with his
autocratic rage against the Brooklyn Museum of Art painting of the
Virgin Mary with elephant dung attached. The same one who announced
to his wife in a news conference that he was leaving her for another
woman. The same one who moved in with an openly gay male couple after
his wife booted him from Gracie Mansion.</TE>
<TE>   It was only while leading New Yorkers through the wilderness of
9/11 and the ensuing anthrax scare that Giuliani became Moses, piling
up more praise than God did for parting the Red Sea.</TE>
<TE>   It's a story he now recounts in media victory laps like this one
("I realized that I was in some kind of awful, horrific human
experience ...") and in speeches at a reported $100,000 a pop, as his
celebrity becomes its own skyscraper of steel and concrete. "His only
appearance in the Southland!" trumpeted a radio ad for his recent
Kodak Theatre address here, as if announcing a superstar.</TE>
<TE>   Which he is, thanks to 9/11, ironically.</TE>
<TE>   On the slab, as well, are a pair of planned Giuliani movies, one
by NBC and another by USA, with TV Guide reporting the likes of James
Woods, Stanley Tucci, Anthony LaPaglia and John Turturro being eyed
as possible small-screen Rudys.</TE>
<TE>   Never one to sever himself from publicity, Giuliani could not be
pried from this towering billboard.</TE>
<TE>   Haunting the film even more than him, though, are other faces and
voices, including the mayor's executive assistant, Beth Petrone,
whose husband, fire Capt. Terry Patton, died on the job that day.
"When I saw the building come down, I knew he had no chance," her
moving testimony begins.</TE>
<TE>   Panic and pandemonium are here at ground level. "Oh, my God" is
heard again and again from ordinary New Yorkers. Their stunned
responses on the street were captured in pictures by a slew of news
organizations and amateurs (all credited on the screen) who were that
day's Raphaels and Michelangelos.</TE>
<TE>   What they captured is a map of catastrophe and misery that
straddles centuries and millenniums as well as continents, giving
continuity to suffering and survival. These are frescoes of humanity
in trouble. On New Yorkers' faces and in their voices is the torment
of England's heavily blitzed London and Coventry, and Germany's
bomb-flattened Dresden, in World War II. Their tears are the tears of
black Birmingham, Ala., in 1963, the anguish of this decade's
southern Sudan and Sierra Leone, the heartache of Israeli and
Palestinian mourners in today's Middle East.</TE>
<TE>   Has there ever been anything, however, quite like seeing desperate
souls trapped inside these dying twin towers choosing to dive to
their deaths? Caught here in an Associated Press photo by Richard
Drew is one of these falling forms, frozen in time as macabre visual
poetry.</TE>
<TE>   Has there ever been anything, also, quite like recorded phone
messages left by other trapped victims?</TE>
<TE>   A man speaking in gasps: "Neil, it's Brian. A plane crashed into
the trade center. It's on fire and I'm in it and I can't breathe."</TE>
<TE>   A woman: "Jill, there's a fire on my floor. I love you. Tell
Nicole I love her. I don't know if I'm going to be OK here. I love
you so much."</TE>
<TE>   As choking fumes and dust billow outside the south tower,
meanwhile, a woman on the ground floor is heard calling to an
anonymous savior: "Oh, my God, you saved my life! You saved my life!
Thank you!"</TE>
<TE>   One more tribute, one more nameless hero.</TE>
<TE>   "In Memoriam: New York City, 9/11/01" premieres Sunday night at 9
on HBO. The network has rated it TV-MA (may be unsuitable for
children under the age of 17).</TE>

<HD>HBO Probes Limits of Restraint, Revelation in 9/11
'Memoriam'</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>ELIZABETH JENSEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Even HBO exercises restraint when it comes to some images from the
Sept. 11 terror attacks.</LD>
<LD>   The network that built its reputation on a willingness to allow
language and pictures that other networks won't air has found some
images too horrific for its Sunday documentary, "In Memoriam: New
York City, 9/11/01."</LD>
<LD>   A final cut of the documentary, screened Monday evening in New
York for a celebrity-filled crowd that included "The Sopranos" stars
James Gandolfini and Lorraine Bracco, was missing some provocative
images that were included in an earlier, unfinished version. Other
images were significantly altered to be less shocking.</LD>
<TE>   A picture of a bloody hand was a case in point. The still photo of
the severed body part helped illustrate a larger picture that showed
people running away, seemingly oblivious to what lay nearby. HBO had
initially decided not to use the whole image, focusing only on the
hand. But in internal screenings, "it began to be what everyone was
talking about," said Sheila Nevins, HBO's executive vice president of
original programming. At first, she said, "it seemed necessary, and
then it seemed vulgar." The hand was taken out of the film.</TE>
<TE>   The one-hour film was culled from 1,000 hours of footage,
including the work of 16 news organizations and more than 100
amateurs. It originated with Rudolph Giuliani, who brought the idea
to producer Brad Grey as a project to record oral histories of the
day as witnessed by the then-New York mayor and his staff. Their
recollections are interspersed with the images, including one in
which Giuliani covers his face after apparently watching someone jump
or fall from a World Trade Center tower.</TE>
<TE>   Giuliani said in an interview that the film, which he has seen
four or five times, "gets worse each time I watch it. It's more
difficult for me to get through it each time," particularly the
reflections of his executive assistant, who lost her husband, a
firefighter. Still, what's on screen is "not nearly as horrifying as
the actual event," he said, calling it "a euphemistic version of the
horror that occurred."</TE>
<TE>   Plenty of difficult images remain; some drew gasps from the
premiere audience. Among them are video and still images of people
who fell to their deaths, accompanied at one point by audio of a man
admonishing the videographer to stop filming the grim scene. Whether
the images are too strong, Giuliani said, is "a very individual
choice people have to make." But ultimately, he said, people have to
face what happened. "As time goes by, people are going to forget the
horror of this; people are already referring to it as a tragedy, but
it was an attack," he said, adding the images will help them
remember.</TE>
<TE>   Nevins pared the film's content as successive screenings led her
to believe that some scenes were just too much. The reactions
depended on the personal experiences of the screeners, she said. But
some gruesome scenes had to be left in, she added, or pictures of
bystanders reacting wouldn't make sense.</TE>
<TE>   In some ways, HBO's history shaped what Nevins chose to include.
"Maybe there was a part of me that thought, 'Everybody expects HBO to
be vulgar, and I'd better step away from it,'" she said. "We're just
trying to be in the middle somewhere, as truthful as we could be at
this time in history.... I don't know who's God when it comes to
judging what's appropriate. Everybody has a different level of
reality."</TE>
<TE>   HBO's film is only one of many about the day that have already
been made or are in the works, from CBS' film on the firefighters,
which drew high ratings when it was broadcast in March, to Showtime's
films from student filmmakers and HBO's previously aired "Telling
Nicholas."</TE>
<TE>   Much of the attention will culminate in the days leading up to the
one-year anniversary, when ABC News has already announced plans for a
7 a.m.-to-midnight retrospective. Still, Nevins said she doesn't
foresee such projects undermining one another.</TE>
<TE>   "I think there can be hundreds of shows about this day," she said.</TE>

<HD>At Its Best, 'Spirit' Takes Flight</HD>
<DH>Though the way-out-West story is predictable, the animation
in this equine epic unfolds in a breathtaking sweep.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KENNETH TURAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron" is a film that manages to soar,
but only when its horses do. Under ordinary circumstances, of course,
horses are not known to fly, and they don't really here. But when
this new animated feature from DreamWorks is at its best, they
definitely seem to.</LD>
<LD>   The story of a feisty mustang of the Old West who absolutely,
positively will not be broken, "Spirit" is being touted for the way
it combines traditional two-dimensional and computer-generated
three-dimensional animation and for being the anti-Mr. Ed. This is a
horse that won't talk, so don't ask him, thank you very much.</LD>
<LD>   Of course, Hollywood being Hollywood, "Spirit" hedges its bets by
giving the animal voice-over narration (read by Matt Damon) that
sounds like this is one horse who found time to take creative writing
courses. Also filling in the gaps are a musical's worth of songs by
Bryan Adams, who collaborates with composer Hans Zimmer to attach a
lyric to almost every mood change Spirit faces, from his birth ("Here
I am, this is me") to later homesickness and separation ("Wherever I
wander, here I will always return"). That's more communicating than
some people do.</LD>
<TE>   Speaking or silent, horses apparently have a reputation for being
difficult to animate, and co-directors Kelly Asbury and Lorna Cook
have taken pains to be as authentic as possible. Impressive horse
consultants were hired, and what's described as "a wide variety of
neighs, whinnies and other horse sounds" were carefully recorded.</TE>
<TE>   That determination to be true to what horses went through way out
West makes parts of the production problematic for the youngest
viewers. However authentic, it's unpleasant to see Spirit starved and
subjected to sadistic riding crops and spurs. Although the horse
gives as good as he gets when he's captured by the U.S. Cavalry, he's
trussed up in so many constraining ropes and harnesses that you feel
like you're watching "Stallions in Bondage" instead of a friendly
animated cartoon.</TE>
<TE>   "Spirit" was likely conceived by writer John Fusco in part as a
love note to the West before we covered it with parking lots,
snowmobiles and SUVs, an attempt to produce a history of the region
written not "from the saddle of a horse" but "from the heart of one."
It's at its best during its purely visual moments, like the
three-minute opening sequence, which is so complex that it was nine
months in the design stage alone.</TE>
<TE>   Following an eagle in swooping flight, the camera, in what looks
like one long, continuous shot but isn't, moves all in a rush through
the canyons of our collective imagination, thrusting us into a
constantly changing landscape that includes the Grand Canyon and
other frontier landmarks. It unfolds in such a breathless rush that
you can feel how exciting it must have been to animate.</TE>
<TE>   Inevitably, the story parts of "Spirit" are more ordinary and
predictable. We see the horse being born and watch him "grow from
colt to stallion, racing with the eagle, soaring with the wind."
Then, with a face that makes him resemble an equine John Travolta, he
becomes leader of the Cimarron herd and learns that "with that honor
comes responsibility."</TE>
<TE>   What also comes with maturity are encounters with unpleasant white
men, intent on subjugating the West in general and Spirit in
particular. They're epitomized by the Colonel (James Cromwell), who
serves as bondage master during Spirit's brief stay with the cavalry.
If the white people cause every bit of the trouble in this film, the
Native Americans, living as it happens in perfect harmony with the
natural world, are just as schematically presented as uniformly
virtuous. This is especially true of the young Lakota brave Little
Creek (Daniel Studi), who hooks up with Spirit and happens to possess
a fetching paint mare named Rain that catches Spirit's eye.</TE>
<TE>   Despite its good intentions, "Spirit" is more self-conscious and
uninspiring from a dramatic point of view than one might have wished.
Still, whenever it threatens to get bogged down in earnest
dramaturgy, a stirring visual sequence like a surge through swirling
rapids or a leap from pinnacle to pinnacle rouses us. If horses could
fly, this is surely what they'd look like.</TE>

<HD>L.A. Chamber Orchestra Sued by a Former Executive</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS PASLES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Alleging breach of contract, blacklisting and defamation, among other
complaints, Bruce D. Thibodeau has filed suit against the Los Angeles
Chamber Orchestra, which he led as executive director from 1995 to
1997.</LD>
<LD>   The suit, filed in Santa Monica Superior Court on May 14, seeks
general and special damages from the Los Angeles Chamber Orchestra
Society Inc., Los Angeles Chamber Orchestra Foundation and board
members.</LD>
<LD>   Thibodeau was hired by LACO in 1993 as acting director of finance.
He became director of administration and finance a year later and was
appointed to a three-year term as executive director in 1995. He
resigned in 1997. The suit claims the he was treated badly by the
board as a result of his sexual orientation. Since then, Thibodeau
contends, LACO board members violated the terms of his termination
agreement by publicizing untruthful statements about his job
performance and made inappropriate remarks about his sexual
orientation, preventing him from finding another job in arts
management.</LD>
<TE>   Officials of the chamber orchestra would not comment on the suit
or on Thibodeau's tenure with the orchestra.</TE>
<TE>   According to the lawsuit, under Thibodeau's leadership, the
organization completed the reduction of a deficit of approximately
$1.2 million. In 1996, the orchestra announced it was operating in
the black for the first time in nine years.</TE>
<TE>   Incorporated in 1968, LACO plays repertory from the Baroque era to
the 20th century, in subscription concerts, a chamber music series
and neighborhood and family concerts. The 40-member ensemble is
currently led by music director Jeffrey Kahane and executive director
Ruth Eliel, former managing director of the Lewitzky Dance Company in
Los Angeles, who was appointed in 1997.</TE>
<TE>   In 1997, Thibodeau founded Arts Consulting Inc., a Los Angeles
management and consulting firm, which he still heads.</TE>
<TE>   "What he was forced to do was basically become a consultant," said
his attorney, James P. Wolh. He decided to sue when "new employment
opportunities presented themselves and he was denied employment."</TE>

<HD>Networks Lose Ground</HD>
<DH>With nearly 90 channels on the roster, cable claims a
growing share</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BRIAN LOWRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Even the Winter Olympics and the highest-rated World Series in years
couldn't stem the tide of erosion besetting the major television
networks, which continued to lose audience during the just-concluded
2001-02 television season, with roughly 1.5 million viewers turning
to other prime-time options.</LD>
<LD>   Overall viewing of the four major networks averaged just fewer
than 45 million people at any given moment in prime time for the
season, which began in late September, delayed by the events of Sept.
11, and officially concluded Wednesday, along with the four-week May
rating sweeps. That represents a 3% drop compared with the previous
year.</LD>
<LD>   At the same time, cable continued to expand its share of the
audience, with advertiser-supported cable channels exceeding network
viewing during April, the first time that's happened within the
official TV season. For the year, broadcast networks (including the
smaller WB, UPN and Pax networks) totaled roughly a 50 audience share
in prime time, compared with an aggregate 46 share for basic cable, a
gap that has steadily narrowed.</LD>
<TE>   Part of that has to do with sheer tonnage, as digital cable and
satellite dishes have raised the number of channels per average home
to nearly 90, but cable networks also scored coups with original
series, from MTV's "The Osbournes" to Nickelodeon's "SpongeBob
SquarePants" to FX's "The Shield."</TE>
<TE>   Tim Brooks, senior vice president of research for Lifetime
Television, said that although top network programs are still
thriving, shows without a solid following are increasingly
vulnerable: "Their strength is in those few very high-profile
appointment shows. Those withstand almost anything."</TE>
<TE>   NBC had more of those franchises than anyone else, riding the
Winter Olympics and venerable stalwarts such as "Friends" (which
soared this season, culminating with the show's second-largest
audience ever, for the birth of Rachel's baby this month) and "Law &amp;
Order" to a decisive prime-time victory--the third network to finish
on top in as many years.</TE>
<TE>   The network also scored clear-cut wins in the late-night and
early-morning races thanks to "The Tonight Show With Jay Leno," "Late
Night With Conan O'Brien" and "Today." NBC's nightly news also led in
that department, as all three network newscasts bucked the erosion
trend, averaging more than 30 million viewers nightly, despite talk
of their diminished importance in a world with multiple all-news
channels.</TE>
<TE>   Buoyed by the Olympics as well as the core strength of its
schedule, NBC averaged 13.5 million viewers at any given moment in
prime time, a 17% increase over last season. CBS was a competitive
second at 12.3 million viewers, posting a modest decline, while ABC
sank more than 20% from year-ago levels--the steepest year-to-year
decrease in network history--to 9.7 million. Fox averaged 9.2 million
viewers, its programming woes masked by such highly rated events as
the Super Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   Beyond highlighting the topsy-turvy nature of the current TV
landscape--which saw "Who Wants to Be a Millionaire" put ABC in first
place two seasons ago and "Survivor" help CBS outplay the competition
last year--the season also demonstrated the viewing public's
resilience.</TE>
<TE>   Few of the programming trends widely discussed in the wake of last
fall's terrorist attacks resulted in a fundamental shift in audience
tastes. There was a hunger for what came to be dubbed "comfort food,"
reflected in higher ratings for established programs, and resistance
to many so-called "reality" shows, which seemed contrived and
inconsequential set alongside images of Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   Yet by the time the season ended, viewers were drifting back to
their usual patterns. That included solid ratings for such unscripted
series as NBC's "Fear Factor" and ABC's "The Bachelor." Moreover, all
three spy shows ordered before the attacks and introduced in their
wake--Fox's "24," ABC's "Alias" and CBS' "The Agency"--fared well
enough to be renewed for a second year, after concern inside the
networks that the subject matter might unsettle viewers.</TE>
<TE>   All told, it was a season of highs--mostly for NBC and CBS--and
lows for ABC and, to a lesser extent, Fox. ABC's fortunes plummeted
along with ratings for "Millionaire," and Fox's signature franchises,
"The X-Files" and "Ally McBeal," faded fast. In a telling statistic,
while both NBC and CBS recorded gains in terms of regularly scheduled
programs--excluding sports and specials--ABC and Fox fell by 23% and
18%, respectively. CBS' assault was led by "CSI: Crime Scene
Investigation," which finished ahead of "ER" in total viewing, the
first drama to do so since the NBC show premiered in 1994.</TE>
<TE>   The clearest evidence of ABC's rating woes may be that its
most-watched show other than "Monday Night Football," "The Practice,"
ranked 25th among prime-time series and saw its audience drop more
than 30% with "Alias" replacing "Millionaire" in the hour preceding
it.</TE>
<TE>   David Poltrack, CBS' executive vice president of research, called
the net loss for the major broadcasters "a case of two networks
having a very good year and two networks having a very bad year."</TE>
<TE>   NBC's dominance among the networks was commanding among adults age
18 to 49, the key demographic to advertisers, which want to reach
younger viewers with families and hook them on their brands for life.
CBS, which has long possessed an older audience profile, capitalized
on the other networks' misfires to move into second place, leaving
ABC fourth by that measure.</TE>
<TE>   NBC also capped its year by winning the May rating sweeps, a
period stations rely on to set local advertising rates. Most
significant, the 10 p.m. dramas "ER," "Law &amp; Order," "Law &amp; Order:
Special Victims Unit" and "Crossing Jordan" gave the network a vast
lead during the last half-hour of prime time, funneling viewers
directly into affiliate newscasts.</TE>

<HD>A 'Master' of Style in Martial Arts</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KEVIN THOMAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Master of the Flying Guillotine" has been called the Holy Grail of
the Hong Kong martial arts movies of the '70s, and now that it has
been lovingly restored and given a regular theatrical release, it's
easy to see why.</LD>
<LD>   Aside from a couple of jaw-dropping leaps, this brisk,
action-filled period thriller celebrates the combatants' mastery of
style and technique and endless ingenuity rather than razzle-dazzle
special effects. Don't expect its kung fu virtuosos to fly through
the air like birds in flight.</LD>
<LD>   The leader of the Eagle Claw school of martial arts (Lung Kun Yee)
has announced that a tournament will be held in a quaint mountain
town. The year is 1730, and the Manchu's Ching Dynasty has just
brought the Han's long Ming Dynasty to an end. Not surprisingly,
there is some resistance on the part of the Han people to their
Manchu conquest, and the Emperor has recruited Fung Sheng Wu Chi (Kam
Kong), the blind Master of the Flying Guillotine, to put down any
rebellions.</LD>
<TE>   The Master has assumed the guise of a bearded high lama while
devising his Flying Guillotine, a convex disk that looks like a small
umbrella but when hurled expertly, lands on a victim's head,
immediately decapitating him with its circle of retractable blades.
The Master looks upon the tournament as a chance to avenge the death
of his two disciples, killed by the One Armed Boxer (Jimmy Wang Yu,
who also wrote and directed the 1974 production).</TE>
<TE>   The One Armed Boxer, a Han rebel who runs his own martial arts
schools, is a reflective man who thinks before he acts. He views
martial arts as a spiritual discipline that is an expression of
wisdom and bravery. Slim, young and handsome with a quiet but firm
demeanor, the One Armed Boxer may prove a more formidable adversary
than the Master expects.</TE>
<TE>   Wang Yu, as busy as ever in front of a camera, directed nine
highly regarded martial arts films between 1970 and 1976 and has
played the One Armed Boxer numerous times. "Master of the Flying
Guillotine" was seen in the U.S. by only a small number of martial
arts fans in an English-dubbed bootleg video called "One Armed Boxer
vs. the Flying Guillotine," which also had some airings on American
TV.</TE>
<TE>   While "Master" has the largely one-dimensional characters and
declamatory acting typical of the genre, it displays terrific energy
and visual bravura. Its superb choreography is by Hong Kong cinema
legend Lau Kar Leung, also known as Liu Chia-Liang, assisted by Lau
Ka Wing.</TE>
<TE>   Restoration of "Master of the Flying Guillotine" represents a
seven-year labor of love. It was well worth the effort, for it is a
gem of its genre.</TE>
<TE>   MPAA-rated: Unrated. Times guidelines: the martial arts violence
emphasizes virtuosity over bloodshed and therefore is acceptable for
older children.</TE>

<DH>Playwright Athol Fugard's 'Sorrows and Rejoicings' tells
how the shapes of peoples' lives were forever altered by apartheid.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SEAN MITCHELL</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As three women gather on a stark set at the funereal opening of Athol
Fugard's new play "Sorrows and Rejoicings," having its West Coast
premiere at the Mark Taper Forum, it quickly becomes apparent that
the main character in the story, a man, is already dead. The
women--his wife, his mistress and his illegitimate only child--will
bring him back to life through memory and argument as they recount
his sins and virtues, and the man himself, an exiled South African
poet, will reappear before their eyes and ours and ask to be forgiven
his trespasses.</LD>
<LD>   Such is the dreamlike scenario for this, another of Fugard's
elegant meditations on the personal cost of apartheid that offer
enduring images of a beautiful, cruel land even as they fail to
gather much steam as drama.</LD>
<LD>   The engine of the play runs in reverse, piecing together in
flashback and reverie the biography of an embattled white writer who
opposed the racism of his government and suffered the punishment of
expatriation. While it is not Fugard's biography exactly, when John
Glover, as the writer Dawid Olivier, makes his first appearance
onstage to spew a hallucinatory monologue fueled by the emotions of
returning home after 16 years in England, he uncannily calls up the
image of a disheveled Fugard himself, albeit with longer hair and
better teeth.</LD>
<TE>   Dawid, we come to understand, was a victim of his times. A man of
conscience whose writings were banned, he was forced to leave home
with his English-speaking, academic wife, Allison (Judith Light),
only to become a pathetic pub-crawling expatriate in damp and dreary
London, dreaming of the hard blue sky and relentless sun of his
native veldt. He never forgot South Africa and never forgot Marta
(Cynthia Martells), the black housekeeper and mistress he left behind
along with their unacknowledged daughter, Rebecca ( Brienin Nequa
Bryant). Unable to have more children with Allison, in London he
appears to have lost both his manhood and his reason for being.</TE>
<TE>   His relationships with Marta and Rebecca remained secret for
reasons as plain as the harsh reality of apartheid. But 16 years
later, on the day Dawid is buried back home in the new South Africa
of President Nelson Mandela, the consequences of his illicit affair
are suddenly laid bare in an unforgiving scrutiny.</TE>
<TE>   Was he a victimizer after all, as well as a victim? Or was
everyone under the merciless desert sun merely burned by fate?</TE>
<TE>   In plays such as "The Blood Knot," "Master Harold ... and the
Boys" and "A Lesson From Aloes," Fugard dramatized the inhumanity of
the old order in South Africa, and in the more recent "Valley Song,"
staged at the Taper in 1997, fashioned a parable of the painful
transition to the freedom and liberation that finally came. In
"Sorrows and Rejoicings," he has taken yet another angle, looking
back as if to remind us how the shapes of certain lives, both white
and black, remain altered by the former racial divide.</TE>
<TE>   Directed by the author, the story of this latest play unfolds on
an abstract set of broad panels full of tan swirls (designed by Susan
Hilferty) suggesting a sprawling desert backdrop. The action takes
shape as something of a seance, with Allison and Marta calling up
scenes of Dawid from the past, while tensely searching for a mutual
acceptance between two women in mourning who loved the same man.
Their differences are profound and succinctly defined when Allison
pronounces her husband's name "DA-vid," while Marta says "Dawid," in
the local dialect of Afrikaans.</TE>
<TE>   Light neatly conveys both the force and foreignness of the English
language and culture transplanted to the African outback, while
Martells is equally adept at convincing us of how much this place
belongs to her. She glides slowly but effortlessly around the bare
room, with every movement seeming to challenge Light's presumption to
occupy the same space. It's an admirable collaboration of opposites
in what are the play's most effective characterizations.</TE>
<TE>   As Rebecca, Bryant spends the first half of the play's
uninterrupted 100 minutes standing mute in an upstage doorway,
refusing to enter the room her mother has cleaned all her life and
where, in fact, Rebecca, was conceived. She watches ruefully as her
mother lovingly polishes a massive stinkwood table, an emblem of the
nation she has rubbed smooth "with her tears." When at last Rebecca
does speak, it is to loose a scene-stealing torrent of bile and
outrage at how Dawid has treated her mother, abandoning the both of
them for years before returning hastily to die on his native soil.</TE>
<TE>   Bryant's chair-tossing soliloquy lights a spark under a play that
has passed to this point as a series of painterly recollections and
ruminations on the life of a dead poet in a tragic country where, it
is pointed out, poetry and politics cannot be separated. But her
righteous anger stands apart from what seems the play's main
conflict, the internal dilemma of the expatriate irreconcilably
homesick for a place he cannot go back to for the reasons that he
left in the first place.</TE>
<TE>   The dilemma itself is muted because it is internal, and because
it's being told as something that happened years ago. Glover's sinewy
poses and febrile recitations lend an undeniable momentum to the
apparition of Dawid, but he can only do so much to propel a story
forward that is going backward from the beginning. Always an
interesting actor to watch, Glover strives here to lay bare the soul
of a good man turned wretch now asking for redemption from the grave.
It is a multicolored performance of furious business and impish
asides, but I'm not sure it ever reaches the realm of tragedy staked
out by the playwright.</TE>
<TE>   There are all kinds of theater, and Fugard's sparsely populated
and sparely plotted tone poems are an advanced model of the most
literary kind. They play out like spells, hovering in the landscape
of dust and dry plain evoked through his talent for natural imagery
as conveyed by dialogue. We are always glad to see them but leave the
theater wondering if it is the landscape itself that is his main
subject or the parched lives of his fellow South Africans whose
stories seem to melt there.</TE>

<LD>   Guthrie Bitter Over Ventura's Arts Cuts</LD>
<LD>   In the wake of Gov. Gray Davis' decision to trim more than 50%
from last year's $31-million California arts budget, his Minnesota
counterpart has initiated similar cuts in his state.</LD>
<TE>   One of the institutions most affected by Gov. Jesse Ventura's
action is the renowned Guthrie Theatre of Minneapolis, which had
hoped to use the $24 million in state bonds vetoed by Ventura to help
build a $125-million complex designed by French architect Jean
Nouvel.</TE>
<TE>   The governor is "destroying the infrastructure of the arts,"
Guthrie artistic director Joe Dowling told the Minneapolis Star
Tribune on Wednesday, calling the veto a "shameful act" that dealt a
"serious body blow to the project."</TE>
<TE>   A delay is almost certain, he said, and the project (for which $57
million has already been raised from private sources) may have to be
shelved. The Guthrie's board will meet Wednesday to consider its
options.</TE>
<TE>   "We've always said there's no Plan B," Dowling said. "For us to
create a major public institution that has national and international
significance, we must get the state of Minnesota involved."</TE>
<TE>   'Sweet Smell' Victim of Media Slam, Backers Say</TE>
<TE>   Producers of "Sweet Smell of Success"--a musical about the power
of the press--have sent a letter to those voting on the Tony Awards,
berating members of the media for "going out of their way to
undermine [the show] at every opportunity."</TE>
<TE>   Particularly galling to the producers, the New York Post reported,
were stories minimizing the show's chances of winning the best
musical award, to be handed out June 2.</TE>
<TE>   "For reasons we can't fathom," the producers continued, "these
attacks have not abated since our previews and seem intended to
undermine the show in the eyes of the audiences and now Tony voters.
We, as producers, find ourselves in a place where many of you have
been in your theatrical careers--on the wrong side of the press that
covers our community."</TE>
<TE>   Though the New York Times declined to comment on the letter,
Variety's Charles Isherwood rose to the bait.</TE>
<TE>   "I admire the producers' ingenuity in trying to cast themselves as
innocent victims of a cabal of would-be J.J. Hunseckers," Isherwood
said, referring to a conniving character in the play. "But the truth
isn't half that exciting. Neither, unfortunately, is the show."</TE>
<TE>   TELEVISION</TE>
<TE>   Rosie's Swan Song a Season High</TE>
<TE>   Rosie O'Donnell got a great send-off on her 6-year-old "Rosie
O'Donnell Show." Wednesday's program, her last live broadcast, scored
a season-high rating and won its time period in 29 markets, beating
out both "Regis &amp; Kelly" and "Oprah."</TE>
<TE>   New taped episodes of the series will air through June 27, and
comedian Caroline Rhea will take over the franchise in the fall with
"The Caroline Rhea Show."</TE>
<TE>   In contrast, Fox's "Celebrity Boxing" didn't generate nearly as
much heat in its latest go-round Wednesday night. Viewing of the
expanded 90-minute special averaged 10.2 million viewers--a sizable
drop from the 15.5 million who watched the first edition.</TE>
<TE>   Part of that had to do with facing the season finale of "The West
Wing," having sparred with a rerun in March. This time around, the
Aaron Sorkin show on NBC drew 16.6 million viewers.</TE>
<TE>   ABC Rethinks Title of Canceled Show</TE>
<TE>   From the "It's a little late now, isn't it?" department: ABC has
changed the name of the sitcom "Wednesday 9:30 (8:30 Central)" to "My
Adventures in Television," even though the show has been canceled.</TE>
<TE>   Four new episodes of the series, about a fictional television
network, will air (yes, Wednesdays at 9:30, 8:30 central), beginning
Wednesday, as summer programming, said a network spokesperson, adding
that ABC hopes the title change will draw more viewers. Given that
the series didn't make it onto ABC's recently announced fall
schedule, however, the new name isn't expected to help its prospects.</TE>
<TE>   QUICK TAKES</TE>
<TE>   Norman Rockwell's 1943 painting "Rosie the Riveter" sold for
nearly $5 million at a Sotheby's auction Wednesday, shattering the
previous record for a Rockwell work ....Kelly Osbourne has been added

<HD>'Soup Cans' Missing From Show</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUZANNE MUCHNIC</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The catalog of "Andy Warhol Retrospective," opening Saturday at the
Museum of Contemporary Art, lists 240 works that visitors can expect
to see in the landmark exhibition. It's not a completely accurate
lineup because the catalog went to the printer in early February,
before all the loans of artworks had been finalized. Still, one item
that is listed and reproduced in the catalog, but nowhere to be seen
in the show, has raised pointed questions.</LD>
<LD>   That's because the work, No. 76, isn't just any old
Warhol--particularly to Los Angeles' art audience. It's "Campbell's
Soup Cans," an iconic suite of 32 paintings that made its debut here
in 1962 at the Ferus Gallery, a legendary showcase on La Cienega
Boulevard.</LD>
<LD>   Widely considered a pivotal work in contemporary art, the
paintings introduced Warhol to Los Angeles early in his career. As
the catalog indicates, MOCA hoped to bring them here.</LD>
<TE>   But the Museum of Modern Art in New York--which acquired the
paintings in 1996 as a purchase and partial gift of former Ferus
Gallery owner Irving Blum and loaned them to the retrospective at its
first two stops, Berlin and London--refused to extend the loan to Los
Angeles. Instead, the suite will go on view June 29 at MoMA's new
facility in Queens.</TE>
<TE>   Blum, who bought the suite of paintings for $1,000 after showing
them at Ferus, said the absence at MOCA is "a blaring omission. To
have an exhibition in Los Angeles that celebrates Andy, especially
his early work, and not have 'Campbell's Soup Cans' is
unconscionable. It makes no sense."</TE>
<TE>   Jeremy Strick, director of MOCA, said the museum hoped to secure
the loan and "made efforts to the end." Although the catalog might
seem to indicate that the New York museum reneged on a promise, that
is not the case, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Certainly we wanted the paintings here, both because they are
important within Warhol's work and they have particular relevance for
Warhol's history in Los Angeles," he said.</TE>
<TE>   But he does not view the absence as a devastating loss. "Seeing
the exhibition whole, I think we have a remarkably complete
presentation of Warhol's work," Strick said. "We have a number of
other 'Soup Can' paintings that weren't in Berlin or London."</TE>
<TE>   The retrospective, which was organized by the New National Gallery
in Berlin, wasn't intended to travel. But when it moved on to the
Tate Modern in London, MOCA's leaders and friends launched a major
effort to bring the show to Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Speaking on behalf of the Museum of Modern Art, Ruth Kaplan,
deputy director for marketing and communications, said the loan of
"Campbell's Soup Cans" was initially approved only for the New
National Gallery in Berlin and later extended to the Tate Modern.
When it came to MOCA, however, she says, MoMA loaned major Warhols
that were requested, but "we always signaled that the loan of
'Campbell's Soup Cans' would be unlikely, given the timing of our
opening of MoMA QNS. It was always our intention to include it in the
inaugural presentation, opening June 29."</TE>
<TE>   Last fall, when MOCA's staff was trying to extend loans on enough
works to bring the show to Los Angeles, Blum was among those who made
inquiries at MoMA about "Campbell's Soup Cans."</TE>
<TE>   "Kirk Varnedoe was sympathetic, but he's gone now," Blum said of
MoMA's former chief curator of painting and sculpture, who resigned
last year and joined the faculty at the Institute for Advanced Study
in Princeton, N.J. "I also spoke to [MoMA trustee] Aggie Gund, who
said it wouldn't be a problem." Blum also discussed the matter with
MoMA director Glenn D. Lowry.</TE>
<TE>   "I suggested a compromise, to let MOCA show the paintings for a
couple weeks, before Queens opens, and then send them back. He
thought that was an excellent idea, but it didn't happen. I don't
know why."</TE>
<TE>   Strick said that he and his staff hadn't discussed that
possibility with Lowry and his staff.</TE>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Icehouses," a new series of works by Catherine Opie, transports
viewers from the dry, sun-drenched streets of Los Angeles to the cold
back country of Minnesota. Produced during the artist's yearlong
residency at the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis, each 40-by-50-inch
photograph depicts a snowbound lake shore: a low, modest skyline of
bare trees, scattered houses and colorful fishing cabins adrift in
wintry white.</LD>
<LD>   The sky, which takes up the top half of each picture, is
indistinguishable in color and texture from the frozen water below,
and the skyline stretches between them like a patterned ribbon across
a flat, blank page. In some of the images the buildings are clear and
distinct, while in others they're almost invisible behind veils of
falling snow. The foggiest images are nearly monochromatic.</LD>
<LD>   The work constitutes another chapter in Opie's ongoing exploration
of the American landscape--a project of civic portraiture that has so
far come to encompass Minneapolis, St. Louis, New York and L.A. The
"Icehouses" series embodies several of the important qualities of
these earlier series, such as an unwavering sense of frankness, an
unsentimental approach to landscape and an acute appreciation for
banality.</LD>
<TE>   If the city pictures--particularly in the "Freeways" and "Wall
Street" series (taken in Los Angeles and New York
respectively)--demonstrate Opie's formidable command of the geometric
logic of urban space, however, these new works betray a curious
degree of abandon. Rather than pinning the landscape into a strict,
legible frame, in "Icehouses," her lens is consumed by it.</TE>
<TE>   The whiteness in this world, one senses, is vivid, fearsome and
omnipotent--not so much a product of normal cycles of precipitation
as an ethereal governing force. In subjugating formalism to the
lyrical power of this presence, Opie has cultivated a new element of

<TE>   Conceptualism in</TE>
<TE>   Search of Content</TE>
<TE>   The first piece inside the doors of Mungo Thomson's exhibition at
Margo Leavin Gallery consists of about a dozen pencils--all handmade
by Thomson to look perfectly mass produced--stuck irregularly into
the ceiling of the gallery's foyer, as though left there by a bored
assistant during installation. Titled "Between Projects" and
presumably conceived in a lull betwixt this and his first solo show
at the gallery, the work is a poignant expression of ennui. It
arouses sympathy for Thomson's creative block, as well as
appreciation for the artistic fortitude that compelled him to forge
through the block and carve his own pencils rather than reverting to
ready-mades.</TE>
<TE>   By offering a glimpse into the lowest reaches of the artist's
conceptual grab bag, however, the work casts a curious light on the
rest of the show. Judging from the number of subsequent works on
view, the ennui was clearly temporary.</TE>
<TE>   But one can't help but wonder whether that grab bag has had
adequate time to replenish itself. Though all of the works are
perfectly clever, commendably labor-intensive and conceptually
promising, they feel notably incomplete--like stray fragments of raw
material moving toward a yet unimagined whole.</TE>
<TE>   The best are simple but genuinely humorous. One of these is
"Antenna Baldessari," a series of foam antenna balls endowed with the
Santa Claus-like face of conceptual artist John Baldessari and priced
to sell. Equally satisfying is "Clipping," an ink-jet rendition of a
New York Times front page that announces the opening of Thomson's own
show, optimistically proclaiming: "Art Exhibition Opens, Changes
World."</TE>
<TE>   In the show's three larger works, however, the humor runs thin.
Thomson falls back upon the presumably intrinsic power of popular
imagery.</TE>
<TE>   "Royal Leerdam Crystal Beer Bottle Candle Holders" consists of
just that: three dozen lead-crystal beer bottles, mouth-blown by the
renowned Dutch glass factory and plugged with melted candle stubs.
"Love and Joy" is a life-size replica of a stained-glass window
occasionally depicted in the TV cartoon "The Simpsons." And "The
American Desert (for Chuck Jones)" is a DVD projection of Road Runner
and Wile E. Coyote cartoons from which Thomson has digitally removed
the characters, leaving only a series of trippy landscape backdrops.</TE>
<TE>   Each is compelling--the latter certainly inspires an appreciation
for the animator to whom it's dedicated--but their benign lack of
irony, however heartening in principle, leaves the work feeling flat
and directionless. Appreciative appropriation, however cleverly
assembled or painstakingly crafted, simply isn't enough to carry the
work to fruition.</TE>
<TE>   With a spare, conceptually oriented show of this ilk, one hopes to
find--or at least sense behind the scenes--a grab bag spilling over
with ideas, a cache of concepts plentiful enough to lend a quality of
tautness to the refined final product. This work is pointing in that
direction; one suspects it just needs some time.</TE>

<TE>   For the Wicked,</TE>
<TE>   It's a Bug's Life</TE>
<TE>   Rooted in the Pythagorean doctrine of transmigration, whereby
unsavory individuals are believed to reincarnate into lower life
forms until they prove themselves again worthy of a human existence,
Viktor Koen's large, digitally constructed prints imagine a race of
corporate executives reborn as fearsome insects.</TE>
<TE>   These individuals--"bureaucrats with punished souls," Koen writes
in his statement--aren't, as Pythagoras might have hoped, humbled
creatures seeking to repent. Rather, they are "willing adapters of a
predatory modus operandi," whose ruthless instincts, naturally
disguised in human form, are outwardly manifest in their current
state--a strange hybrid of human, insect and machine.</TE>
<TE>   Considering the parallels between today's "aggressive corporate
behavior patterns" and the "strife and competition" inherent in the
insect world, Koen grimly concludes that, far from suffering, these
tight-lipped, steely-eyed men would be "perfectly comfortable in
their new suits." The images, in keeping with the elaborate
statement, are impressively complex.</TE>
<TE>   Each creature has a vaguely human head and shoulders, classically
clad in suit and tie, and at least one arm. Each has a different set
of wings (fly, butterfly, moth, dragonfly, etc.), some sort of
antennae and a variety other insect parts fused to their human flesh.
At their base--where a human abdomen would be--they reveal intricate
mechanical skeletons, equipped with triggered levels and fierce
blades.</TE>
<TE>   These are visually seamless constructions: structurally coherent
and unnervingly believable. Koen is clearly taking cues from
Hollywood--it isn't difficult to imagine these creatures buzzing
through the latest sci-fi blockbuster--but remains faithful to the
demands of the fine art context by imbuing the works with the stately
conventions of traditional portraiture. Indeed, rarely does one see
digital technology used so fittingly outside cinema--that is, to
create something new and convincing without drawing undue attention
to the novelty of the medium.</TE>

<TE>   Mexican Pinups</TE>
<TE>   Reborn as Art</TE>
<TE>   The 26 photographs on view in "Mexotica: Mid-Century Mexican
Glamour Portraits" were produced from a stash of anonymous negatives
discovered by photographer and Fototeka co-founder Merrick Morton in
a small antiques store in Mexico City. It must have been an exciting
find.</TE>
<TE>   They're marvelous pictures: spare, stylized pinup shots taken in
the late 1950s, possibly for men's magazines like Vea and Vo-Devil.
(Research by the gallery has led to no definitive conclusions
regarding photographer or provenance.) Though tame by today's
standards, they are strikingly sensual, featuring an array of sturdy,
graceful, full-figured women in various states of dress, all vaguely
mimicking the conventions of Hollywood imagery.</TE>
<TE>   The pictures seem to have been produced cheaply and quickly. The
settings are minimal and seem to be centrally located, as the few
pieces of furniture--a draped platform, a pink chaise lounge, a fake
column, several scattered vines--reappear throughout. The low-budget
quality of the images, however, only underscores their glamorous
aspirations and playful enjoyment (whether on the part of the
photographer or the model) of modern material culture.</TE>
<TE>   Produced for this exhibition as C-prints, the photographs convey
an exquisite luminosity that would not likely have been realized in
their originally published state. Thus the gallery setting offers a
unique opportunity to appreciate their artistry.</TE>
<TE>   It is also possible in this context to view the images not only as
pinups but as portraits presenting an intriguing variety of women.
Some are as openly flirty and playful as one might expect, but others
are nervous or frightened; others are plainly indifferent. Some seem
to be worrying about what their mother might think, while others are
clearly thinking only of their paycheck.</TE>
<TE>   This unintentional diversity of expression gives one an
appreciation for the wide variety of reasons why these women might
have found themselves posing in this particular studio. It
substantiates the archive's quirky historical value.</TE>

<HD>St.Clair's Flair Is a High Point in 'Alpine'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS PASLES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Carl St.Clair showed a sure and knowing hand when he led the Pacific
Symphony in Strauss' "An Alpine Symphony" on Wednesday at the Orange
County Performing Arts Center. Augmented with extra strings, brass,
winds, an organ, celesta, cow bells, and wind and thunder machine,
the orchestra sounded sonorous and rich, and under St.Clair's
guidance the evocative, pictorial effects worked grandly.</LD>
<LD>   Helping to guide the listener through the piece, which ranges from
the sublime to the downright awful (the loudest and most banal storm
in music), supertitles of the 22 continuous sections ("The Ascent,"
"Through Thicket and Briar to Wrong Paths," "On the Glacier") were
projected above the stage. Without them, you might have reached the
summit too early, although there was no question where you were when
the cowbells clanked.</LD>
<LD>   The program started with Schumann's Piano Concerto in A Minor with
Hsing-ay Hsu as a subdued soloist. In a romantic work that calls for
poetry, she offered only prose. St.Clair accompanied considerately,
keeping the orchestra down so as not to overwhelm her but trying to
rev things up when the orchestra played alone. The mix didn't work
very well.</LD>
<TE>   Before the program, St.Clair received onstage proclamations
honoring his 50th birthday, which is June 5, from Sen. Dianne
Feinstein and the cities of Santa Ana and Costa Mesa. (He'll be
conducting in Germany on the day itself.) After the program, the
orchestra and the audience sang "Happy Birthday."</TE>

<HD>A Workmanlike Take on 'Camelot' in Fullerton</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DON SHIRLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's the lusty month of May--time for a local production of
"Camelot." Fullerton Civic Light Opera's version will do fine until a
more imaginative take on the Lerner and Loewe musical comes along.</LD>
<LD>   Director Jan Duncan assembled an excellent trio, musically and
dramatically, for the leading roles. As King Arthur, Brendan
Ford--occasionally recalling a young Anthony Hopkins--retains enough
youthful charisma to illustrate why Guenevere remains in love with
him even after her eye wanders.</LD>
<LD>   Jennifer Mathews has the glittery voice and saucy flirtatiousness
that Guenevere requires, and handily makes the transition to the
queen's later, guilt-stricken look. Jeremy Aye's show-stopping
baritone serves Lancelot well, as does his sense of earnestly trying
to be a good boy.</LD>
<TE>   The supporting cast is in top form, led by David Richards as the
wise Merlyn and gregarious Pellinore and Kevin Noonchester as the
hissable Mordred.</TE>
<TE>   No new ideas enhance the staging or design, but the old ideas are
executed well.</TE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Regardless of whether you accept the presumption of innocence in
playwright Lou Shaw's "Worse Than Murder, Ethel and Julius
Rosenberg," at Studio City's Ventura Court Theatre, the drama's
factual account of the prosecutorial excesses employed against
America's most notorious convicted spies is a chilling caution about
the fragility of the civil liberties we take for granted.</LD>
<LD>   In compelling performances as the doomed husband and wife, a
perfectly accented Linda Hamilton and Robin Thomas immediately engage
our sympathy with the couple's unshakable love for one another, and
their high level of personal integrity. Proclaiming their innocence
until their execution, the pair refused every opportunity to obtain
leniency through confession, and the romantic spark between the
actors rescues what borders on a history lesson steeped in polemics.</LD>
<LD>   Drawing on FBI and other government documents released long after
the trial, Shaw makes a compelling case that the pair were
systematically framed. Their convictions hinged on the fabricated
testimony of Ethel's brother, David Greenglass (Tom Gibis), who
shared none of their compunctions about saving his hide by claiming
he delivered atomic secrets to a spy ring headed by Julius Rosenberg.</LD>
<TE>   Shaw tells his story through flashbacks evoked during an inquiry
by the Rosenbergs' adult children (Murray Rubinstein and Dennis
Gersten) into the fate of the parents they barely remember. Under Tom
Bissinger's workmanlike staging, it proves a serviceable device for
presenting information, and even allows for some speculative, surreal
exchanges with the effectively sinister figure of FBI Director J.
Edgar Hoover (Dennis Cockrum), the blatantly corrupt trial judge
(William Knight) and the less successful, smarmy young prosecutor Roy
Cohn (Judd Trichter).</TE>
<TE>   By focusing on individual villainy, this treatment somewhat
obscures the broader forces at work--the rampant Red Scare paranoia
that demanded a scapegoat for the Soviet Union's development of
nuclear weapons. It was necessary that someone take the blame, and
the Rosenbergs' leftist affiliations and Jewish otherness made them
such perfect targets that the issue of their actual guilt was
chillingly irrelevant. The unindicted co-conspirators of the piece
are the sullen ignorance of herd mentality, a threat in any era.</TE>

<TE>   Eloquent Monologues</TE>
<TE>   Link Racism, Dysfunction</TE>
<TE>   The visceral energy of pure performance ignites "Three True One"
at the Electric Lodge in Venice. This tripartite program of conjoined
monologues largely transcends its workshop origins, with unusually
potent results.</TE>
<TE>   Originally developed by writers-performers Bridgid Coulter, Rana
Haugen and Eric Cazenave at the Larry Moss Studios, "Three True One"
explores links among racism, sexual abuse and family dysfunction,
reflected in the mirror of one another's oblique autobiographical
material.</TE>
<TE>   Coulter's "Bad Luck and Trouble," Haugen's "Three Doorways" and
Cazenave's "Runaway" are thus intertwined both intentionally and by
default. Following the ritual opening of specific title phrases, each
redoubtable performer takes center stage, with the other intensely
observant participants interjecting vocal and kinetic effects at key
moments.</TE>
<TE>   Through Coulter's rich humor and formidable characterizations, her
recollections of interracial humiliation connect directly with the
audience's solar plexus. The sylph-like Haugen whips through
alternately ribald and unsettling abstractions of sexual debris like
a gestalt Paul Taylor soloist. Cazenave's affecting tale of coming of
age amid gangs and an authoritarian stepfather caps the proceedings
with utter aplomb.</TE>
<TE>   Understanding that the telling of these stories is the whole
point, Don Cheadle's smooth direction involves minimal embellishment
and maximum focus.</TE>
<TE>   There is still room for pruning, and occasional vestiges of
rehearsal-room ethos are detectable. But such considerations seem
inconsequential alongside the insight, wit and eloquence this omnibus
consistently displays.</TE>

<TE>   'Perfect Wedding's' Sex</TE>
<TE>   Farce Has a Message</TE>
<TE>   Hung over from his stag party, Bill awakes on his wedding morning
to find a beautiful stranger sharing his bed. He can't remember a
single detail of their encounter, but whatever happened, he needs to
cover it up fast, because his fiancee is due to arrive at any moment.</TE>
<TE>   These first, frantic moments of the sex farce "Perfect Wedding"
lead to an ever-expanding web of lies and an Indy 500 of people
racing to the nearest door to avoid being seen by one another. But
Robin Hawdon's giddy comedy also contains something not typically
associated with the genre: an actual message--and quite an affirming
one, at that.</TE>
<TE>   Laughs remain the first order of business, however, and they are
delivered aplenty in a Woodland Hills Theatre production at the West
Valley Playhouse. Director Jon Berry carefully orchestrates the
erupting chaos, assisted by actors who manage to be achingly
believable, yet just enough larger than life to propel the action to
comic extremes.</TE>
<TE>   Moved from its original setting in England to Santa Barbara, the
action unfolds in a honeymoon suite painted a calming powder
blue--the only peaceful thing in sight. (Victoria Profitt created the
design.)</TE>
<TE>   Rhett Nadolny's Bill is an earnest, well-meaning guy in his 20s
who is jolted awake when he finds Nicole Sciacca's fiery,
intoxicating Judy tangled under the covers with him. Before the
situation is properly sorted out, the best man (David L. Corrigan)
will be wielding the wedding cake knife with harmful intent; a
chambermaid (Rachel Barber) swept into the cover-up will be using a
referee's whistle to try to quiet the bickering wedding party; and
the increasingly fed-up bride (the single-named Arianna) and her
flustered mother (Nance Crawford) will be struggling to salvage a
once-perfect wedding.</TE>
<TE>   Societal pressures are driving several of these characters toward
marriage for all the wrong reasons. And therein lies the moral, for
only by following their hearts do these folks have any hope of a
happy ending.</TE>

<TE>   Modern Adam-and-Eve</TE>
<TE>   Parable in 'Saved'</TE>
<TE>   In the moonlit garden of a pricey ocean-side hotel, a tuxedoed man
meets up with an elegantly attired woman. Some sort of history has
passed between them, but its nature isn't immediately clear in "How
Shall We Be Saved?" at the Lost Studio.</TE>
<TE>   The woman, a former '60s radical, begins to name the shattering
secrets of her past, weaving her experiences into an ever more
complex rumination on history, politics, social theory, psychology
and religion. Articulate and fiercely alive, she proceeds to haul the
man on the carpet for his gender's raping, murderous ways, while he
sits blank-faced and nearly mute, incapable of anything but
increasingly ineffectual physical responses.</TE>
<TE>   And so it goes as this son of Adam and daughter of Eve grope their
way through a sin-tainted world.</TE>
<TE>   The play's unapologetically political author, Donald Freed, has
made a career of hunting out the horror as well as the humanity in an
age that seems bent on self-destruction. (His best-known work is the
Richard M. Nixon mock-confessional "Secret Honor," which he co-wrote
with Arnold M. Stone.)</TE>
<TE>   Here, he has devised a noirish mystery that turns out to be a
parable. Colorfully but densely written, the story is a confusing
thicket of hidden meanings.</TE>
<TE>   Fortunately, the wondrous Salome Jens delivers most of the text.
Her character lets her thoughts tumble forth for an intermission-less
75 minutes, while the man looks on in bewilderment. Determined to get
through to him, she purrs, she teases, she bombards--and, when all he
can manage by way of response is an animal roar, she roars back.</TE>
<TE>   Mitchell Ryan vividly fulfills his part of the bargain, finding an
amazing array of emotion within his general state of discomfiture.</TE>
<TE>   Carefully modulated under Freed's direction and enacted amid the
inviting verdure of Daniel C. Cowan's walled garden, this
Adam-and-Eve tale makes an earnest effort to turn us all back toward
Eden.</TE>

<TE>   A Comedy About Arts</TE>
<TE>   Funding? Well, It Works</TE>
<TE>   Now here's something you don't come across every day: a Noel
Coward-esque comedy about arts funding. It's not the likeliest idea
around, yet somehow it works in a sharply rendered staging at Theatre
40.</TE>
<TE>   Written while the country was debating the appropriateness of
National Endowment for the Arts funding for certain works, Rich
Orloff's "Veronica's Position" spins a fictional story out of one of
the biggest brouhahas of that period: the cancellation of a Robert
Mapplethorpe photography exhibition at the Corcoran Gallery of Art in
Washington, D.C., at a time when the clamor on Capitol Hill
threatened to undermine the NEA.</TE>
<TE>   The action unfolds in a posh D.C. hotel suite in late 1989, as
middle-aged, glamour-queen movie actress Veronica Fairchild (Janice
Lynde) prepares for her stage debut in a production of "Hedda
Gabler." The much-married star will be performing opposite a former
husband (Michael Forest) but has turned her romantic attentions to a
U.S. senator (Webster Williams).</TE>
<TE>   While embroiled in artistic differences with the play's hotshot
director (Cheryl Carter), Veronica finds herself in a still more
awkward position when a photographer (David Cheaney) being decried by
the senator begins spending a lot of time in her suite as a guest of
her personal assistant (Kris Frost).</TE>
<TE>   Although there's never much doubt about which side of the debate
the play will end up supporting, Orloff articulately states both
positions and gives listeners a lot to think about.</TE>
<TE>   Director Bruce Gray draws out the humor and keeps the action
buoyant, while the actors bring sharp detail to each
characterization. Lynde, a real-life soap opera personality, is a
particular delight as a demanding diva with a heart of gold, while
Frost provides the emotional core as an otherwise witty, fun-loving
guy who has all but shut down after his lover's death.</TE>

<HD>'With 'CQ,' Tries to Honor the Family BusinessAnother
Coppola Is Heard From</HD>
<DH>In his first feature, Roman  Coppola pays homage to '60s
films. The result is stylish but awfully slim.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAN STUART</AU>
<BD>NEWSDAY</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If your dad was the genius who made "The Godfather" trilogy and
"Apocalypse Now," chances are you'd want to do whatever you could to
avoid his shadow. Unfazed, music video director Roman Coppola has
chosen to walk in his father's footsteps, albeit in less
prepossessing shoes. Even Francis, after all, had to cut his teeth on
cheap-jack horror movies.</LD>
<LD>   Francis Ford Coppola's low-budget salad days are one of the many
dippy souvenirs of cinema yesteryear sent up in Roman Coppola's debut
feature, "CQ," a daffy homage to filmmaking in the '60s that is too
stylish to be written off as an act of dues paying but, at the end of
the day, too inconsequential to be seen as anything more than a very
sleek-looking college prank.</LD>
<LD>   Set in Paris in 1969, "CQ" revolves around the shooting of a
futuristic spy thriller called "Dragonfly." It has racy echoes of
"Barbarella," whose sexpot heroine was pop culture's nod to the
ascension of female power and the primacy of the male libido.
Coppola's protagonist is an aspiring young American filmmaker named
Paul (Jeremy Davies) who is working on the film as an editor when the
tempestuous, Dino De Laurentiis-like producer (Giancarlo Giannini,
playing to the hilt) presses him into service to finish directing the
movie.</LD>
<TE>   Paul faces two dilemmas. The film's original director, an arty
European type (Gerard Depardieu) who had intended to end the film on
a pretentiously ambiguous note, has left him without a windup. And
his sultry American leading lady (Angela Lindvall), a part-time
political activist (get it?), is distracting him from his Parisian
girlfriend (Elodie Bouchez).</TE>
<TE>   "CQ" gets off to a ticklishly funny start with a scene from
"Dragonfly" that apes the all-white plush decor of "Modesty Blaise"
and Jane Fonda's shameless striptease in the opening credits of
"Barbarella." Coppola loses his satirical zest as Paul gets deeper
into the muck of show business and "CQ" begins to emulate that sullen
school of movies about the existential problems of being a movie
director. Davies' mopey, hands-in-pockets routine, which he has been
cultivating since "Spanking the Monkey," wears thin in concert with
the picture.</TE>
<TE>   Also in danger of ossifying before his time is Coppola's cousin,
Jason Schwartzman, paying winking homage to the family as a brash
wunderkind director of quickie horror movies. Since his debut as the
precocious young hero of "Rushmore," Schwartzman has fallen into
self-caricature with flashy blowhards like the student nerd he
impersonated in the stupefying "Slackers." We can only hope these
multitalented cousins have gotten their sophomore year in movies out
of their systems.</TE>
<TE>   MPAA rating: R for some nudity and language. Times guidelines:
Acceptable for mature teens, who may find it amusing and stylish, but
many likely won't get the references.</TE>

<HD>'13 Conversations' Is One Intricate Film</HD>
<DH>Jill Sprecher's drama interweaves four stories that take a
searching look at life's uncertainties.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KEVIN THOMAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"13 Conversations About One Thing" is about as far removed from a
Hollywood movie as a film can be and still have familiar stars and a
traditional narrative form--albeit with some deft shifts back and
forth in time.</LD>
<LD>   Tautly written, resolutely low-key, intricately constructed and
very serious about the risky business of being alive, "13
Conversations" demands the utmost concentration, for to look away
from the screen for even a brief moment is to risk losing a plot line
or a crucial bit of information, but its cumulative, transporting
impact makes it worth the effort. Above all, it has an overwhelming
sense of reality atypical of the American cinema.</LD>
<LD>   In the early 1990s, aspiring filmmaker Jill Sprecher suffered a
severe head injury from a mugging. The following year, a complete
stranger came up to her on a subway train and inexplicably slapped
her on the head. As tears started welling in her eyes, Sprecher
thought to herself, "I hate people," only to discover a fellow
passenger offering her a kindly smile. "That smile just broke the
spell," Sprecher recalled. "It was like the final healing for me."</LD>
<TE>   Sprecher, who had been a production coordinator and manager and a
line producer on studio and independent features, made her
directorial debut with the 1997 film "Clockwatchers," about a group
of office temps, which she wrote with her sister Karen. After its
completion, the two started work on "13 Conversations." Triggered by
Sprecher's desire to consider the traumatic incidents she had
experienced and their resolution, they decided to explore the often
calamitous consequences of seemingly inconsequential or random
events.</TE>
<TE>   "13 Conversations" is composed of four loosely connected vignettes
involving everyday New Yorkers. A physics professor, Walker (John
Turturro), remarks to the wife (Amy Irving) he is cheating on with a
sultry literature professor (Barbara Sukowa) that he wants what
everybody wants: "To experience life, to wake up enthused, to be
happy."</TE>
<TE>   He could be speaking for Sprecher's other key characters as well.
Alan Arkin's Gene is a veteran manager of a claims adjusters
department for a big corporation. His steadfast goal in working
himself up from the bottom has cost him his marriage and left him
with an estranged, drug-addicted son. A sour, irritable but
fundamentally decent man, Gene feels continually annoyed by the
sunny, upbeat personality of one of his men (William Wise), of whom
he remarks to his one friend (Frankie Faison) that the guy lacks
ambition and vision--but significantly is a successful husband and
father.</TE>
<TE>   In contrast to Walker and Gene, both moody types, Matthew
McConaughey's Troy feels on top of the world. A young deputy D.A., he
loves his work, which he believes demonstrates that the system works
after all. He is a law-and-order type with a passion for punishing
the guilty. And finally there's Clea DuVall's Bea, a pretty young
woman who works for a Manhattan cleaning service and who keeps her
friend and co-worker Dorrie (Tia Texada) cheered up with her
optimistic outlook on life.</TE>
<TE>   All four central characters will undergo wholly unexpected
experiences that will reveal to them how treacherous are the
assumptions upon which they have been living their lives. Sprecher
evokes in thoroughly unsettling fashion how unpredictable and
uncertain life is from moment to moment, with most but not all of
life's surprises turning out to be negative. She is wise enough to
know that this is hardly news, and instead makes a subtle, implicit
case for having a little patience and kindness with ourselves and
others.</TE>
<TE>   Contemplative rather than didactic in tone, "13 Conversations"
dares to be philosophical in its point of view but at the same time
is studded with portrayals as rigorous as the Sprechers' script. All
the actors bring a shining humanity to their portrayals, and "13
Conversations'" four stars could not be better. Indeed, Gene is one
of Arkin's best, richest screen roles ever, and McConaughey is most
effective in showing us a man crumbling behind a handsome facade. It
was a smart move for McConaughey to make this film; stardom came too
fast for him, but this is the best kind of retrenching, revealing
what a fine actor he can be. Turturro and DuVall are no less
impressive. DuVall has an especially wonderful moment when she
eagerly delivers a shirt she has mended to an architect whose swanky
apartment she cleans, only to find him assuming that she has stolen
his watch.</TE>
<TE>   Frequent collaborator of British director Mike Leigh,
cinematographer Dick Pope brings to the film a clear glow that
heightens its realistic feel, and Alex Wurman's spare, elegant score
contributes strongly to creating and sustaining the film's shifting
moods.</TE>
<TE>   MPAA rating: R, for language and brief drug use. Times guidelines.
There are four-letter words but not in excess; exceptionally complex
adult themes.</TE>

<HD>Caught Up in 'Insomnia's' Deft Waking Nightmare</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KENNETH TURAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"When does it get dark around here," Will Dormer asks the local cops
in Nightmute, Alaska, the halibut fishing capital of the world, and
they only smile. During the summer months this far north of the
Arctic Circle, the only darkness, as the Shadow liked to say, lurks
in the hearts of men, and there is plenty to go around.</LD>
<LD>   A Los Angeles Police Department detective on loan to the Nightmute
force to investigate a particularly disturbing homicide, Dormer
(masterfully played by Al Pacino) will be disoriented by more than
the midnight sun in "Insomnia." This taut and intelligent
psychological thriller, a kind of white nights film noir,
investigates moral ambiguity as well as bad behavior, illuminating
the risks even decent people run of losing their way in the dense
thickets of crime.</LD>
<LD>   As both his earlier films, the less-seen "Following" and the indie
powerhouse "Memento," demonstrated, director Christopher Nolan is a
filmmaker at home with dislocation and dissociation. "Insomnia" shows
an equally welcome ability: a gift of creating intelligent,
engrossing popular entertainment.</LD>
<TE>   This is a skill Nolan shares with one of "Insomnia's" executive
producers, Steven Soderbergh, who recognized a kindred spirit in
Nolan and supported him on the project. Having a director this
thoughtful doing genre material results in considerably more texture
than usual, in a film that understands how immorality can ooze into
goodness like a drop of blood seeping into a white shirt.</TE>
<TE>   Although smartly written by Hillary Seitz in a promising debut,
"Insomnia's" origins go further back, to an excellent 1997 Norwegian
thriller of the same name directed and co-written by Erik
Skjoldbjaerg and starring Stellan Skarsgard in the Pacino role.
Seitz's script sticks closely to the original, but Nolan has had no
trouble using a variety of skills to make the material his own.</TE>
<TE>   Working with his "Memento" collaborators cinematographer Wally
Pfister and editor Dody Dorn, and shooting largely in British
Columbia, Nolan once again displays an unmistakable visual confidence
and a feeling for bravura moments like a nerve-wracking chase across
a slippery logjam floating down a frigid river.</TE>
<TE>   As he showed with Guy Pearce in "Memento," Nolan is also adept at
working with actors, and the beneficiaries this time are not only
Pacino, but also co-stars Robin Williams and Hilary Swank, all of
whom profit from the director's ability to elicit reined-in
performances. No one benefits from this tight control more than the
veteran Pacino, who owns the film from the first moment we see Det.
Dormer flying into Nightmute with his LAPD partner Hap Eckhart
(Martin Donovan), and looking as drained and bloodless as the crime
scene photos of murdered 17-year-old Kay Connell he holds on his lap.</TE>
<TE>   An actor who's been around and looks it (and who was playing cops
as far back as 1973's "Serpico"), Pacino was a natural choice for one
of those bleak veteran detectives who's next door to a legend in
law-enforcement circles. Dormer may look tired, he may actually be
tired, but he remains a watchful hawk, patiently waiting for the
opportunity to strike.</TE>
<TE>   Dormer and his partner are not really in Nightmute as a friendly
gesture from a large city chief to a small one. They're in town in
part for a respite from an Internal Affairs probe of their conduct
back home. Dormer, especially, is worried and agitated that his
reputation, his very life's work, will be destroyed by those he
thinks "suck the marrow out of real cops."</TE>
<TE>   If Dormer and company represent experience, Swank's Det. Ellie
Burr is all innocence and enthusiasm as the youngest member of the
Nightmute force, someone who actually studied Dormer's cases in the
academy. While Swank's performance inevitably opens on a gee-whiz
note, it toughens and gets more heft as the case takes increasingly
serious turns.</TE>
<TE>   It doesn't take Dormer long to establish that Kay was murdered by
someone who knew her well, someone who took enormous trouble and care
to groom the corpse he'd savagely beaten to death. "This guy, he
crossed a line," Dormer says, "and he didn't even blink."</TE>
<TE>   But despite this insight, Dormer finds the case uncommonly
difficult. An unexpected crisis causes his situation to unravel, and
the 24-hour sun, which makes sleep impossible, starts to prey on his
mind. More and more, Dormer feels trapped by the unceasing light,
unable to escape from its punishing, insidious brightness.</TE>
<TE>   Adding to his difficulties are a series of taunting late-night
phone calls from a voice we immediately recognize as Robin Williams'.
The detective immediately focuses on his character, Walter Finch, as
the main suspect. Finch, it turns out, is an especially clever man,
eager to engage Dormer in elaborate mind games, trying to make him
somehow complicit in a growing moral darkness that threatens to
envelop the entire case.</TE>
<TE>   For Williams, Walter Finch is one of a trio of dark roles
(starting with "Death to Smoochy" and ending with the forthcoming
"One Hour Photo"), and it is the most effective of the lot. It's also
perhaps the most compelling of the actors' non-comic performances,
noticeable for the way the character's unflappable calmness leads to
greater and greater complexity.</TE>
<TE>   It is also unusual to see Pacino this outwardly calm, but his
restraint has a formidable power. This is an actor especially suited
to playing a man who knows all the moves, who has no trouble allowing
us to feel the weight of experience on his soul. By not going over
the top, Pacino allows us to intuit the strength behind the
anguished, haunted mask, reminding us why he was such a compelling
actor in the first place.</TE>
<TE>   Holding all this together without apparent effort is director
Nolan, who revels in the intricate push-pull relationship between
detective and suspect that is at "Insomnia's" core. As "The Asphalt
Jungle" famously considered crime merely a left-handed form of human
endeavor, this film explores the nature of truth, how cops and
criminals can appear to be two sides of the same coin, how difficult
it can be to know what to reveal and when to reveal it. As Dormer
says to Ellie, "People give themselves away in small lies, small
mistakes. It's just human nature."</TE>
<TE>   MPAA rating: R, for language, some violence and brief nudity.
Times guidelines: The violence is brief but vivid, including
particularly disturbing scenes involving young victims.</TE>

<HD>When They Can Let Their Hair Down</HD>
<DH>Movies* Once a month, devotees of 'Hedwig and the Angry
Inch' act out their passion, 'Rocky Horror' style.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANDRE CHAUTARD</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's after midnight on a Friday, and a theater full of moviegoers
fervently shouts out the opening lines of last year's rock musical
"Hedwig and the Angry Inch"--"Don't you know me? I'm the new Berlin
Wall! Try and tear me down!"--as, on screen, Hedwig launches into the
electrifying opening number, "Tear Me Down."</LD>
<LD>   On the fourth Friday of every month, devoted "Hed-heads" and
curious newcomers line up--many in costume--around the block at
Laemmle's Fairfax theaters on Beverly Boulevard for the communal
experience of Hedwig's journey from his childhood as Hansel in East
Berlin to--after a botched sex-change operation (hence the "angry
inch")--universally unacknowledged co-writer of rock superstar Tommy
Gnosis' hit records and restaurant chanteuse.</LD>
<LD>   Hoping to turn "Hedwig" into the next "Rocky Horror Picture Show"
midnight cult phenomenon, a group of fans who call themselves Rainbow
Carnage (after a line in the film) act out most of the film in front
of the screen in full costume and with an array of clever props,
while the audience sings along by heart.</LD>
<TE>   Other fan-generated, interactive "Hedwig" screenings have been
popping up around the country, from New York to San Francisco to,
last week, Long Beach. The film's love story about finding one's
other half, its transgender chic and its soundtrack mix of punk rock
and wistful ballads have inspired a following that continues to grow.</TE>
<TE>   Rainbow Carnage likes to involve the audience as much as possible,
from pulling moviegoers out of their seats to help in a scene to
passing out candy during the song "Sugar Daddy." The audience is
encouraged to shout out responses, which, if the fans take to them,
may become part of the "Hedwig" routine in the way the "Rocky Horror"
call-back lines were improvised by fans and codified over time.</TE>
<TE>   But "Hedwig" fans also keep quiet during the dramatic scenes. As
the emcee says when introducing the screening, "To our 'Rocky Horror'
fans: We like this movie."</TE>
<TE>   "'Rocky' is camp. 'Hedwig' is a story," says Devri Richmond, 17,
one of the makeup artists for the stage show. "You can cry at
'Hedwig.' You can't cry at 'Rocky.'"</TE>
<TE>   Trace Ferris, the Los Angeles show's production coordinator,
remembers that she couldn't get any of her friends to come with her
to "Hedwig" on opening night last July after telling them what it was
about. She went by herself and loved the film so much that she
started dragging people along to see it again and communicating with
other "Hedwig" fans on the message board at the official Fine Line
Web site.</TE>
<TE>   The fans began e-mailing one another and decided to meet at weekly
Saturday night showings at the Laemmle Sunset theaters, where they
would sit in the front rows and sing along. Afterward, over meals at
an all-night diner, the group would muse about having a midnight
screening where they could be freer to sing, dance and act out. "I
just saw how this film really meant something to people on a deeper
level," says Ferris, who lives in Simi Valley and says she's "over
25."</TE>
<TE>   Ferris approached Laemmle Theatres with the idea and found that
vice president Greg Laemmle was a big fan of "Hedwig." He suggested
the chain's recently leased and renovated Fairfax theaters, which,
with the main theater's small stage and backstage area and stairways
off to the side, was ideal.</TE>
<TE>   The first screening, a test run to see if "Hedwig" could play
monthly, was organized for January in celebration of John Cameron
Mitchell's Golden Globe nomination and was originally just going to
be a sing-along. Mitchell, "Hedwig's" director, co-writer and star,
who was going to be in town for the awards, caught wind of the
screening and told them he would attend.</TE>
<TE>   Excited, Rainbow Carnage threw together in a week what's called a
"shadow cast" that included several experienced "Rocky Horror"
performers, who struggled to figure out the complicated blocking and
scene and costume changes. Initially they performed only the musical
numbers, but with each screening Rainbow Carnage has added more
scenes, so that now about 75% of the film is being performed, says
athletic trainer and "Rocky Horror" alumnus David Berck, 32, who
directs the Rainbow Carnage show.</TE>
<TE>   "I loved it," says Mitchell, who also came to the third screening
and plans on returning when he is in town. "I love that
do-it-yourself aesthetic," which, he says, goes back to "Hedwig's"
roots as a club act with a group of friends in New York that evolved
into an off-Broadway show and then a film.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike "Rocky Horror," which has a small cast and takes place in
one location, "Hedwig" has frequent shifts in setting and time, with
flashbacks to Hedwig's childhood and even some animation. The group
has come up with inventive ways to mimic the on-screen action, such
as wheeling Hedwig through the aisles on a restaurant cart to
simulate the character's imagined flight in the film. They are open
to suggestions, says Lea Nave, 19, who helps with the costume
changes: "Whatever someone comes up with within the month, we'll try
it."</TE>
<TE>   The January screening sold out the 426-seat theater, and
subsequent shows have been well attended. Fans have come from as far
away as San Francisco and Canada, and the audience spans all
demographics, from drag queens to college students to grandparents.</TE>
<TE>   Naturally, Ferris says, "a lot of the guys dress like women," some
of whom are dressing in drag for the first time. "It's their chance
to see what it's like to wear high heels."</TE>
<TE>   Rainbow Carnage is consciously limiting the screenings to once a
month, hoping to avoid the flash-in-the-pan fate of would-be "Rocky
Horror" heirs. "They play it every week, and you get a really great
turnout the first two or three weeks, and then by the eighth week
everyone's tired of it," Berck says.</TE>
<TE>   United Artists, for example, tried to relaunch the notorious flop
"Showgirls" several years ago as a midnight cult film, but it never
caught on.</TE>
<TE>   And to avoid the staleness of even "Rocky Horror," Rainbow Carnage
tries to come up with different pre-show entertainment, from costume
and dance contests to a fashion show by an underground designer and
campy trailers.</TE>
<TE>   Tonight's screening will feature a karaoke contest. Future ideas
include a drag king star search and a "Hedwig" quiz contest. The
group would also like to have the band actually play live at some
point.</TE>
<TE>   Sing-along screenings have become popular in the last few years.
Disney's El Capitan Theater in Hollywood has screened limited runs of
"Mary Poppins," "The Little Mermaid" and "Evita"--which ends a
six-show run this Saturday night--with lyrics and instructions (boo,
clap, cheer) printed on screen to packed houses, says Lylle Breier,
senior vice president of special events for Disney. The three films
will return, and other Disney films may join them.</TE>
<TE>   Sing-along prints of "Grease" have been shown at several gay and
lesbian events around town, and "Sing-a-Long Sound of Music" returns
to the Hollywood Bowl July 6 for a second year, inspired by the
event's wild success in England. Only "Hedwig" and "Rocky Horror,"
however, have a live cast performing simultaneously.</TE>
<TE>   Though "Hedwig" won numerous awards and had a successful art house
run, grossing $3 million, the release was limited to big cities, and
many fans have only discovered the movie at midnight showings or on
DVD. "On stage, off-Broadway, it skewed older because of the ticket
prices," Mitchell says. "I was always disappointed because I knew
that young people would really get into it and couldn't afford it
until it became a movie."</TE>
<TE>   He is delighted that "Hedwig" has taken on a life of its own.
"It's a dating service, it's a self-help group, it's a disco, it's a
rock club and it's hopefully a lasting thing. I think it actually
will last because there's always new people discovering it, and since
they've discovered it on their own, it becomes more precious."</TE>

<LD>Everyone in the New York neighborhood knew that once night fell, it
was best to get to your home and stay there, behind locked doors. The
darkened streets belonged to "them," the wild, ragtag kids from
broken homes whose nightly mission was to wreak havoc and enjoy
themselves while doing it.</LD>
<LD>   But after a local building was destroyed by fire following one of
the group's late-night forays, the community finally had had enough.
They arranged a meeting to seek a solution to the youths' reign of
terror, once and for all.</LD>
<LD>   But within a few days the youths were back roaming the streets,
and doing as they pleased.</LD>
<TE>   Just another story ripped from yesterday's news? No, the year was
1791, and as tonight's History Channel special "Street Gangs: A
Secret History" aptly illustrates, life in urban America hasn't
changed quite as much as you might have thought over the past 200
years.</TE>
<TE>   The two-hour documentary (at 9 p.m.) offers a sprawling overview
of the forces that traditionally have shaped gang development in this
country, a phenomenon that has repeated itself countless times across
ethnic and racial lines.</TE>
<TE>   The common denominators are poverty and a sense of
disenfranchisement from the prevailing power structure, two factors
that never seem to be in short supply.</TE>
<TE>   The proliferation of guns and the introduction of crack cocaine in
the 1980s helped usher in a new era when turf wars evolved into
battles over market share. The program loses some steam as it moves
beyond the 1980s, however, largely because modern gangs already have
been so scrutinized by the media and even glamorized by pop culture.
But by these closing minutes, viewers have already gained a sobering
understanding of a way of life that's part of living in America.</TE>

<HD>In Heated News-at-10 Rivalry, KTTV Sweeps Past KTLA</HD>
<DH>Television* The stations trade barbs after the May ratings
period. In the 11 p.m. segment, KNBC dominates yet again.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GREG BRAXTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The rivalry between KTLA Channel 5 and KTTV Channel 11 escalated
during the just-completed May sweeps, with competitive news face-offs
that resulted in an exchange of barbs between executives at the two
stations.</LD>
<LD>   KTTV's "Fox News at 10," which tied in ratings with KTLA's "News
at 10," during the November sweeps, was a decisive winner in May,
according to local Nielsen figures released Thursday. Meanwhile, the
seesaw battle between "The KTLA Morning News" and KTTV's "Good Day
L.A." ended in a tie for third place in the morning race.</LD>
<LD>   Executives at KTLA (owned by Tribune Co., owner of the Los Angeles
Times) charged that the ratings don't tell the whole story, pointing
out that KTTV only put on a full hour of news at 10 p.m. 3 1/2 nights
a week, filling the rest of the time with specials and other
programming. They also noted that KTTV inexplicably cut to a live car
chase from Phoenix, charging that the decision to broadcast the
out-of-state pursuit was solely to increase ratings.</LD>
<TE>   KTLA News Director Jeff Wald said, "They have to do what they have
to do. But we're proud of what we do. We put on a full hour of news
[the whole week]."</TE>
<TE>   "They should spend their time worrying about what they're doing,
but we'll put our news broadcast up against anyone in the market as
far as quality," countered KTTV News Director Jose Rios.</TE>
<TE>   Status quo reigned in most other traditional sweeps battles,
though some of those figure to shift in the months ahead, as the
local television market undergoes changes due to a revised ownership
landscape--including plans to move KCOP Channel 13's low-rated 10
p.m. newscast to 11 p.m., where it won't have to compete with sister
station KTTV.</TE>
<TE>   Among the network-owned stations, KNBC, benefiting from its
network's strong prime-time lineup, won the 11 p.m. news race for the
24th consecutive sweeps, coming in ahead of KABC and third-place
KTLA, which airs reruns of "Friends." KCBS Channel 2 continued to
struggle in the time period, dropping 27% compared with last May and
finishing fifth in the time period.</TE>
<TE>   KABC, meanwhile, which has its own lead-in advantage in the
afternoons coming out of "The Oprah Winfrey Show," stayed on top at
4, 5 and 6 p.m., followed by KNBC. KABC General Manager Arnie Kleiner
said the news was helped by sending local reporters to Israel and
Rome. "We're a local station that is willing to go anywhere in the
world to bring local viewers news," he said.</TE>
<TE>   ABC's "Good Morning America," which took over the top spot from
traditional front-runner "Today" on NBC in the November sweep,
continued its winning streak, increasing its ratings by 26% from last
May. In the meantime, CBS' "The Early Show," which has always lagged
behind in the morning, dropped 11% in ratings, coming in fourth
place. Host Bryant Gumbel left the show last week.</TE>
<TE>   KCAL's three-hour prime-time news block from 8 to 11 p.m. showed
growth, increasing 11% from May 2001. However, the station's main
anchor, Jerry Dunphy, died this week after being hospitalized and off
the air for several days.</TE>
<TE>   KCOP Channel 13's ratings for its 10 p.m. newscast dropped 17%
from last May, but the station still had cause to celebrate thanks to
its acquisition of Los Angeles Dodger broadcasts from KTLA. The
ratings for May games were 42% higher on KCOP than they had been on
KTLA last year.</TE>
<TE>   The just-completed sweeps represents the end of an era--the last
survey before a series of changes brought about by various station
sales and mergers takes effect. Insiders will be watching closely in
November to determine how the local news market and ratings will be
effected by several duopolies--consolidations in which a single
company owns two television stations in the same city. The relaxing
of rules by the Federal Communications Commission governing TV
ownership in 1999 has led to several duopolies and new marketing
strategies by the management of the newly linked stations.</TE>
<TE>   Viacom, which owns KCBS, acquired KCAL earlier this month, and
this week KCAL ran promotional spots for KCBS' news during its
broadcast of Monday's Lakers-Kings game.</TE>
<TE>   News Corp., meanwhile, purchased KCOP last year, giving Fox
control over that station and KTTV. The stations announced Thursday
that beginning June 3, KCOP will shorten its evening news to a
half-hour and move it to 11 p.m., where it will compete against
veteran newscasts on KCBS, KNBC and KABC instead of KTTV. The station
will fill the 10 p.m. hour with reruns of "Seinfeld" and "Frasier."</TE>
<TE>   "We feel these comedies will give KCOP both great
counter-programming to the other local stations and will give the
station a solid lead-in for UPN 13 News at 11 p.m.," said John
Frenzel, programming director for KTTV and KCOP.</TE>
<TE>   Prime-time ratings remained high but unchanged from the same
ratings period last year for KMEX-TV (Channel 34), the flagship
station for Univision, the largest Spanish-language television
network.</TE>
<TE>   KMEX easily beat its main competition, KVEA-TV (Channel 52), the
local affiliate of Telemundo, the second-largest Spanish-language
television network in the country, whose local prime-time ratings
dipped 13% from last May. NBC recently completed its purchase of
Telemundo, which hopes to benefit both locally and nationally from a
cooperative relationship between those networks.</TE>

<SE></SE>
<AU>PHILIP BRANDES</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A society in cultural flux that looks to its legal system to supply
an ethical foundation inevitably falls short in the gray areas of
human conduct. As a former prosecutor-turned-actor and writer, Dep
Kirkland examines these limitations with an insider's eye in his new
drama "MsTrial," a sobering study of a workplace flirtation that
leads to sexual assault.</LD>
<LD>   In a handsome staging at the Court Theatre, Kirkland stars as John
Paris, a hotshot trial attorney whose knack for pushing the buttons
of opponents, juries and even his own staff has him poised for a big
win in a wrongful death suit. To secure victory, he has recently
fleshed out his legal team with Karen (Amy Laxineta), an ambitious
young lawyer who's as smart as she is attractive.</LD>
<LD>   Paris makes no secret that Karen's good looks are key to his legal
strategy. Karen willingly goes along, gamely joining in the ongoing
office sexual banter as they prepare for the trial. But in the
aftermath of a drunken celebration, Paris' talent for skirting moral
principles lands him in big trouble when their hitherto innocent
flirting propels him into skirt-chasing beyond Karen's boundaries. In
a harrowing scene that flawlessly builds accelerating dramatic
tension, Laxineta's Karen goes from enticing tipsiness to panic as
she tries to stop her boss's advances.</LD>
<TE>   Kirkland depicts a convincing steely determination that brooks no
opposition in or out of the courtroom. Surprisingly in short supply,
however, is the sympathetic charm that a lawyer of his success would
use (if even cynically) to complement such an acerbic intellect. This
makes it difficult to accept his prickly relationships with his
staff--his younger cousin John (Daniel Burks), the play's foundering
moral compass, would presumably be too accustomed to Paris' theatrics
to fall for his constant needling without some underlying affection
for his mentor. And Paris gives little basis for Karen's admitted
attraction to him.</TE>
<TE>   Forced to take sides between two people he cares about, Burks'
impassioned John is a welcome contrast to Paris' ice, but director
Barry Satchwell Smith still needs to smooth out the distractingly
choppy beats in their exchanges.</TE>
<TE>   A second-act deposition (helped by Jessica Steen as an
increasingly exasperated prosecutor) establishes all the legal
ambiguities that make the incident impossible to resolve in the
courtroom. Kirkland is careful to lay out the reasons (including a
measure of complicity on the victim's part) and ultimately
establishes the moral culpability from which Paris cannot extricate
himself. His shattering recognition is a potent reminder that
whatever progress may have been made in diplomacy between the sexes,
it's a long way from understanding.</TE>
<TE>   "MsTrial," Court Theatre, 722 N. La Cienega Blvd., West Hollywood.
Thursdays-Saturdays, 8 p.m.; Sundays, 7 p.m. Ends June 16. $25. (323)

<HD>Kid 'Investigators' Try to Solve Fun Mysteries</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Don't let your kids watch the new WB show "Phantom Investigators"
alone.... Why should they have all the fun?</LD>
<LD>   This wildly inventive treat, beginning Saturday at 10:30 a.m.,
features kooky kid detectives with strange powers, supernatural
mysteries and some of the most wonderfully weird animation to hit the
small screen in a long time.</LD>
<LD>   The pint-sized P.I.s are a quartet of San Francisco
middle-schoolers: occult expert Daemona; Casey, a shy shape-shifter;
laid-back, telekinetic Jericho; and telepathic Kira, the group's
"psychic cell phone." Their mysterious mentor, Professor Navarro,
rounds out the group, along with Jinxie, a fanged monster, and Wad,
an overgrown, pink lump of living bubblegum.</LD>
<TE>   In the first episode, angry tribal spirits threaten to sink a
popular snob's birthday party with thunderous noise and poltergeist
activities. Turns out the boy has a shaman's magical staff, and the
shaman wants it back.</TE>
<TE>   There's mild vulgarity--expect to hear the word "butt" more than
once--yet this off-the-wall, funny-scary tale, with its pop-music
beat, doesn't ooze attitude. Laudably, lessons about friendship,
empathy and honor, plus a few educational tidbits, take precedence.</TE>
<TE>   It's the unique combination of stop-motion puppetry,
computer-generated imaging and live action, however, courtesy of
creators Stephen Holman and Josephine Huang, that will keep viewers
tuned in: the human characters with three-dimensional puppet bodies
and flat, paper heads; spirits wackily portrayed by real actors, or
modeled out of various substances; and those marvelously detailed
miniature sets that almost steal the show.</TE>
<TE>   "Phantom Investigators" can be seen Saturdays at 10:30 a.m. on the
WB. The network has rated it TV-Y7 (may be inappropriate for children
younger than 7).</TE>

<HD>Rigases Give Up Control of Adelphia</HD>
<DH>Cable: Founder and sons quit the board in effort to avert
bankruptcy. Family will turn over $1 billion worth of assets.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SALLIE HOFMEISTER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Improving the chances--at least slightly--of averting a bankruptcy of
Adelphia Communications Corp., the Rigas family buckled to mounting
pressure from bankers, investors and outside directors Thursday and
agreed to relinquish control of the cable company and contribute $1
billion worth of assets to cover mounting liabilities.</LD>
<LD>   Founder John Rigas, who resigned as chairman, chief executive and
president last week, stepped down from the nine-member Adelphia
board. His three sons, Michael, James and Timothy, also resigned as
directors. Michael and James Rigas gave up top management roles,
after the resignation last week of Timothy Rigas as chief financial
officer.</LD>
<LD>   The assets the family agreed to contribute to Adelphia will only
partially offset the additional liabilities the company faces as a
result of co-borrowing arrangements with private Rigas family
partnerships. These off-balance-sheet loans disclosed in March have
prompted an investigation of Adelphia, the largest cable provider in
Southern California, by the Securities and Exchange Commission and by
two states, New York and Pennsylvania.</LD>
<TE>   Adelphia disclosed Thursday that as of April 30, the family
partnerships had borrowed about $3.1 billion using the public cable
company as a guarantor, up from the $2.3 billion the Rigases said
they had borrowed as of December.</TE>
<TE>   Adelphia already has agreed to restate its financial results for
the last three years to reflect this off-balance-sheet debt. On
Thursday, Adelphia, which already is carrying a debt of about $15
billion, said it would add $2.5 billion to account for the
off-balance-sheet loans. Just weeks ago, the firm said it would be
increasing its debt by only $1.6 billion.</TE>
<TE>   "They've taken positive steps but are not out of the woods yet,"
said Oren Cohen, a bond analyst at Merrill Lynch. "The numbers don't
add up. We need more clarity. What's included in that $3.1 billion?
How much cash do they have on the balance sheet? How much bank debt
do they have?"</TE>
<TE>   Adelphia shares resumed trading Thursday after being halted May
14, dropping $3.08 to $2.62 on Nasdaq. Since disclosures of the
extent of the Rigases' co-borrowing in March, Adelphia shares have
plunged 90%.</TE>
<TE>   Some investors were encouraged by the resignations, which came
after weeks of silence and stonewalling by the company. Analysts
warned, however, that Adelphia still faces a severe cash crunch and
potential bankruptcy.</TE>
<TE>   "This is positive news, but there's still a 50-50 chance of
bankruptcy," said Ajay Mehra, a portfolio manager at Columbia
Management Co., which recently sold its holdings in Adelphia. "They
need an injection of capital because they still have a liquidity
issue."</TE>
<TE>   In a private meeting with the family Tuesday, bankers, which have
loaned the company at least $5.5 billion, agreed to provide Adelphia
additional credit if the Rigas family stepped down from the board.
The Rigases refused to relinquish control Wednesday, but sources said
the family finally surrendered when banks threatened to push the
company into bankruptcy, risking a new round of shareholder lawsuits.
The Rigases and Adelphia face more than 18 class-action shareholder
lawsuits accusing them of securities fraud.</TE>
<TE>   One source familiar with the meeting said John Rigas wept at the
Wednesday session with creditors after agreeing to give up control. A
cable pioneer who was revered in the small town of Coudersport, Pa.,
Rigas founded Adelphia there in 1952 with $300. He survived a
consolidation in the 1990s by tripling the company's size through
acquisitions, including Century Communications Corp., the largest
provider in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Today, however, Adelphia, the nation's sixth-largest cable
operator, has a far higher debt ratio than any other cable company.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts said that even after the Rigases contribute $1 billion in
assets to the company, Adelphia still will be about $700 million in
the hole as a result of the family's borrowing. The assets include
Adelphia securities and cash flow from certain cable systems owned by
the family. Under the agreement, the Rigases will place their voting
stock--60% of the company's total--in a trust, preventing them from
exercising control.</TE>
<TE>   Adelphia said it plans to release other details about transactions
with the family in a filing with the SEC late Thursday or today.</TE>
<TE>   Some analysts said they were surprised by certain concessions made
by the company to force the family's ouster. Among the most
controversial is a severance package that would pay John Rigas
$1.4million a year for three years.</TE>
<TE>   The family also has the right to appoint two non-family board
members of their choice.</TE>
<TE>   A special committee of outside directors running the company also
is seeking the board resignation of a fifth Rigas.</TE>
<TE>   Sources said Rigas' successor, Erland E. Kailbourne, one of the
outside directors, is in discussions with cable pioneer Leonard Tow
about joining the board. Tow, who became the largest shareholder
after he sold Century to Adelphia in 1999, claims he is entitled to
three board seats as part of the sales agreement.</TE>
<TE>   One large Adelphia shareholder, Capital Research &amp; Management, has
been pressuring outside directors to make Tow chief executive, hoping
to restore credibility so the firm can avoid bankruptcy.</TE>

<HD>Witness Says Shredding Volume High</HD>
<DH>Courts: Andersen librarian testifies that trunks of
documents were sent to be destroyed in three-day period. But she says
she didn't see audit papers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEFF LEEDS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>HOUSTON</DL>
<LD>The Arthur Andersen accountants auditing Enron Corp.'s books sent as
many as 20 trunks of documents to be shredded during a three-day span
in October, Andersen's office librarian testified Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   The volume of paper appeared unusual for such a brief time frame,
said Sharon Thibaut, a 29-year company employee who ran the firm's
Houston records room. Thibaut, taking the witness stand in Andersen's
obstruction of justice trial, said she hadn't received much data from
the firm's Enron team during the prior 10 months.</LD>
<LD>   In examining the contents of the footlocker-like trunks, which
weigh about 100 pounds when full, Thibaut said she didn't see audit
work papers, which are required to be saved under Andersen's document
retention policy.</LD>
<TE>   Under cross-examination from Andersen attorney Rusty Hardin,
Thibaut said the volume sent for destruction equaled about half a box
for each member of the Enron audit team, which she said was "not an
excessive amount."</TE>
<TE>   Andersen is accused of destroying files to impede a Securities and
Exchange Commission inquiry of the energy giant's finances. Hardin
said outside the courtroom that Thibaut's testimony bolsters his
contention that the amount of files destroyed was inconsequential.</TE>
<TE>   Thibaut took the stand amid continued tension in the courtroom.
Prosecutors repeatedly objected to Hardin's remarks, and at one point
asked for a bench conference to complain privately to the judge that
the Andersen lawyer was trying to paint them as "obstructionists."
Assistant U.S. Atty. Samuel Buell told reporters that he was "a
little tired of Mr. Hardin's speeches."</TE>
<TE>   Hardin said outside the courthouse that he had "never met such a
bunch of whiners in my life."</TE>
<TE>   Hardin also clashed with prosecutors outside the jurors' presence
over the jury instructions to be given by U.S. District Judge Melinda
Harmon. Prosecutors asked Harmon to remind jurors that three Andersen
executives cited their right against self-incrimination and refused
to testify.</TE>
<TE>   If that request is granted, Hardin said, he would try to show in
court that the three invoked their rights only after being threatened
by prosecutors.</TE>
<TE>   Harmon has called a special conference Saturday to hear the two
sides debate the jury instructions. Part of the dispute focuses on
whether jurors can ascribe the actions of David B. Duncan, formerly
Andersen's lead Enron auditor, to the entire firm. Duncan has pleaded
guilty to obstruction of justice and is cooperating with federal
investigators.</TE>
<TE>   Duncan has testified that he told subordinates Oct. 23 to comply
with Andersen's document policy, which calls for auditors to keep
only the records needed to back up their accounting judgments and to
destroy drafts, duplicates and other files deemed extraneous.</TE>
<TE>   Early Thursday, the chief of Andersen's fraud investigation team
testified that Duncan didn't tell him that he had initiated the
destruction effort. David Stulb, who visited Duncan's office Oct. 31,
said "it would have been nice to know" about the shredding effort.
Stulb said he didn't learn of the destruction until January, when
Andersen publicly disclosed it.</TE>
<TE>   Stulb testified earlier that he stopped Duncan from throwing away
the cover sheet of a memo summarizing an Enron vice president's
allegations of accounting fraud at the energy conglomerate.</TE>
<TE>   Stulb said Thursday that he left the encounter thinking Duncan was
naive, adding that he had told Andersen officials John Geron and
Nancy Temple that Duncan "needed guidance" on document retention. But
under cross-examination, Stulb testified that he didn't tell either
of them about the incident in which Duncan appeared ready to toss out
the cover sheet.</TE>
<TE>   Also Thursday, Texas' accountancy board filed a notice to revoke
Andersen's accounting license in the state.</TE>

<HD>Williams- Sonoma Beats Estimates</HD>
<DH>Earnings roundup: The housewares retailer 's shares rise
11% on results. Petco's profit more than triples.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters and Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Williams-Sonoma Inc. reported a sharper-than-expected jump in
quarterly profit and raised its forecasts for the current quarter and
full year, sending its stock up 11%.</LD>
<LD>   Good Guys Inc., the consumer electronics giant based in Alameda,
Calif., also posted healthy quarterly results and raised its outlook,
giving its shares a boost.</LD>
<LD>   San Francisco-based Williams-Sonoma said it benefited from fewer
markdowns and surging sales at its upscale Pottery Barn stores in the
latest quarter.</LD>
<TE>   The housewares retailer posted net income of $15.4 million, or 13
cents a share, for the quarter ended May 5, compared with $492,000,
or break-even, a year earlier.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts on average were expecting 9 cents, according to Thomson
Financial/First Call.</TE>
<TE>   Home products retailers were among the few to benefit after the
Sept. 11 attacks, with Americans traveling less and spending more
time on their homes.</TE>
<TE>   Williams-Sonoma's shares, which have gained more than 50% this
year, finished up $3.09 at $32.12, one of the top percentage gainers
on the New York Stock Exchange. Earlier in the day, the stock hit an
all-time high of $32.62.</TE>
<TE>   Sales jumped 20% to $267.6 million, the company said. Sales at
stores open at least a year grew 6.2%.</TE>
<TE>   The biggest increase in same-store sales was 11.9% at Pottery
Barn. Same-store sales inched up 1.7% at Williams-Sonoma and slid 11%
at its upscale storage unit Hold Everything.</TE>
<TE>   The retailer boosted its fiscal second-quarter earnings estimate
to 7 cents to 8 cents, from 4 cents to 5 cents, on expectations of
higher revenue growth. Analysts had forecast 5 cents.</TE>
<TE>   For the full year, Williams-Sonoma now expects profit of 95 cents
to 98 cents, up from 85 cents to 88 cents.</TE>
<TE>   Good Guys reported a 17% rise in operating earnings to $8 million,
or 4 cents a share, for its fiscal fourth quarter even as sales
declined 6.8% to $259.2 million.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Good Guys jumped 30 cents, or 9.7%, to $3.40 on heavy
trading on Nasdaq.</TE>
<TE>   The company said that it expects to report growth in same-store
sales and improved profit in the current quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Good Guys also announced that it has received a four-year
extension on its $100-million credit facility from Bank of America
and GE Capital, which will allow it to offer more products during the
holiday season, borrow more money to pay for inventory, improve
efficiencies and lower costs.</TE>
<TE>   In the latest quarter, which ended Feb. 28, Good Guys reported an
accounting reserve of $18.1 million for potential costs of a plan to
close unprofitable stores, which resulted in a net loss of $17.3
million, or 74 cents a share.</TE>
<TE>   Same-store sales fell 7%, but showed improvement in the last month
of the quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Other California retailers reporting quarterly earnings:</TE>
<TE>   * Petco Animal Supplies Inc. said profit more than tripled to
$8.7million, or 15 cents a share, in its fiscal first quarter, from
$2.9million, or 5 cents, a year ago, beating analyst expectations by
2 cents. The latest results exclude $24.4million in one-time charges.
Sales rose 15% to $349.2 million, and same-store sales were up 9.3%.</TE>
<TE>   * Wet Seal Inc., whose namesake and Arden B. stores sell clothes
for young women and teenage girls, said fiscal first-quarter profit
surged 63% to $8.72 million, or 28 cents a share, beating analysts'
forecast of 26 cents. Sales grew 13.6% to $156.6 million, the
Foothill Ranch company said. Same-store sales jumped 8.2%.</TE>

<HD>State to Reveal Schedule in June for Bond Sale</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News and Times Staff</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>California's long-delayed plan to sell bonds to cover electric power
costs is getting closer to reality, but Treasurer Phil Angelides on
Thursday still couldn't say exactly when the securities may be sold.</LD>
<LD>   "The major actions that are needed have been completed" to let the
bond sale proceed, including regulatory approvals that provide
revenue to back the debt, Angelides said during a conference call
with investors.</LD>
<LD>   But although other state officials have said the sale may begin in
September, "I don't want to speculate" on a date, Angelides said. The
state plans to release a "definitive" schedule next month, he added.</LD>
<TE>   The $11.1-billion offering, which would be the largest municipal
debt sale in U.S. history, will let the California Department of
Water Resources repay the state's general fund for a $6.56-billion
loan for last year's energy costs, pay off an interim $4.3-billion
borrowing from banks and cover other power-related expenses.</TE>
<TE>   The California Public Utilities Commission in February approved
using revenue from the state's three largest investor-owned utilities
to pay off the bonds and cover state energy contracts.</TE>
<TE>   California faces a projected budget deficit of $23.6 billion in
the fiscal year beginning July 1. State officials have said they want
to sell the power-buying bonds as soon as possible to repay last
year's loans. The state already plans to sell a record $7.5 billion
in short-term notes by mid-year to shore up cash reserves.</TE>
<TE>   Angelides revealed more about the expected structure of the
power-bond deal. He said that about nine-tenths of the debt will be
sold as tax-exempt securities. The rest will be sold as taxable
bonds.</TE>
<TE>   About $4 billion of the bonds are expected to be sold on a
variable-rate basis, with yields reset periodically, Angelides said.</TE>
<TE>   The power plan involves energy the state water department bought
on behalf of PG&amp;E Corp.'s Pacific Gas &amp; Electric and utility units of
Edison International and Sempra Energy. Pacific Gas and Southern
California Edison, the state's two largest power utilities, became
insolvent last year buying electricity for more than they could
charge customers under state law.</TE>

<HD>Ciena Posts Loss as Carriers Cut Spending</HD>
<DH>Telecom: Optical networking supplier's second-quarter loss
was greater than expected amid slower sales.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Telecommunications equipment maker Ciena Corp. posted a
larger-than-expected quarterly loss Thursday as lower spending by its
telephone carrier customers hammered sales.</LD>
<LD>   Ciena, which makes equipment that increases the capacity of
fiber-optic telecom networks, added that revenue may fall further in
its current quarter and its stock fell to lows it had not seen in
more than 3 1/2 years.</LD>
<LD>   "We are seeing our customers go to extreme measures to conserve
cash," said Ciena President and Chief Executive Gary Smith, adding
that he did not know when the industry will recover. "Given the scale
of the excesses of the last few years, it's taken a while to flush
all this out."</LD>
<TE>   The company reported a net loss of $612.2 million in the second
quarter ended April 30, or $1.86 a share, compared with a
year-earlier net loss of $50.7 million, or 17 cents a share.
Excluding one-time charges and other items, Ciena posted a loss in
the quarter of $208million, or 63 cents a share, three times the loss
Wall Street was expecting.</TE>
<TE>   The quarter included a larger-than-normal excess inventory charge
of $223.2 million related to long-distance products. Excluding that
charge, Ciena said its per-share loss would have been in the range of
19 cents to 23 cents. Revenue in the quarter plunged to $87.05
million from $425.4 million last year.</TE>
<TE>   The company had held up better than most optical networking
suppliers, but as spending slowed at such large carriers as Sprint
Corp. and Qwest Communications International Inc., Ciena was forced
to trim forecasts and cut jobs.</TE>
<TE>   "It is ugly across this industry and Ciena certainly has reflected
the stress that exists throughout the whole optical networking
sector," said Andy Schopick, vice president of research at Nutmeg
Securities, a boutique broker-dealer in Connecticut.</TE>
<TE>   Ciena's stock fell as low as $5.90 in early Nasdaq trading, a
level not seen since October 1998.</TE>
<TE>   Its shares closed off 36 cents, or 5.6%, at $6.08, and is down 96%
from its all-time high of $151 in October 2000.</TE>

<HD>Datum to Be Bought by Rival</HD>
<DH>Tech: Symmetricom agrees to acquire Irvine maker of timing
devices for $97 million in stock.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES S. GRANELLI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Datum Inc., an Irvine maker of timing devices, said Thursday that it
agreed to be acquired by a San Jose-based competitor for stock worth
$97 million.</LD>
<LD>   Symmetricom Inc., which has another deal pending to acquire a much
smaller competitor, would exchange nearly 2.8 of its shares for each
share of Datum.</LD>
<LD>   News of the deal sent Datum stock up 21%, or $2.39, to close at
$13.80. Symmetricom fell 81 cents to $5.29. Both companies trade on
Nasdaq.</LD>
<TE>   Founded in 1969, Datum is one of Orange County's older technology
companies. It makes timing and synchronization products--essentially
atomic clocks--for the telecommunications industry to help different
electronic devices communicate with each other.</TE>
<TE>   Its chairman, Erik H. van der Kaay, said the Irvine plant, one of
four nationwide, would be crucial to the combined operations and
would remain open. Datum has about 500 employees.</TE>
<TE>   Datum shareholders would end up with about 42% of Symmetricom once
acquisitions of both Datum and TrueTime Inc. in Santa Rosa are
completed this year. The firms make timing products for computers,
broadband and other electronics for military, industrial and
commercial customers.</TE>
<TE>   The combined operation would have $205 million in sales, based on
results from the last four quarters. Datum earned $1.2 million on
sales of $109.7 million in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Thomas W. Steipp, Symmetricom's chief executive, said the merged
operations would provide stronger product offerings with little
customer overlap and would result in a more financially viable
company.</TE>
<TE>   The companies would look to cut costs as Symmetricom consolidates
headquarters operations in San Jose. About a third of the cost
savings would come from employee cuts, he said. Symmetricom has 410
employees; TrueTime has 105.</TE>
<TE>   Steipp and Van der Kaay said no decisions have been made on staff
reductions and plant closings.</TE>
<TE>   Symmetricom would add three Datum directors to its board, raising
the total number to nine. Steipp would remain chief executive. Van
der Kaay would chair Symmetricom's board, replacing Chairman Richard
W. Oliver. Oliver would remain a director.</TE>

<LD>A prototype of a pilotless fighter jet that would autonomously attack
an enemy and return to base made its first flight Wednesday, taking a
major step toward revolutionizing the way battles will be fought in
the future.</LD>
<LD>   Boeing Co.'s X-45A aircraft took off from a dry lake bed at
Edwards Air Force Base, flew for 14 minutes and then landed back on
the lake bed, company and Pentagon officials said. It was controlled
by an on-board computer that had been preprogrammed with flight
instructions, rather than remotely piloted by a human with a
joystick.</LD>
<LD>   Sometime in the next decade, military strategists envision using a
swarm of such unmanned combat air vehicles, or UCAVs, to carry out
the most dangerous elements of combat, knocking out enemy air
defenses such as radars and antiaircraft missiles so that piloted
fighters and bombers can strike targets on the ground and in the air.
Pentagon officials and defense analysts said the maiden flight of the
X-45A represented a "quantum leap" in the development of such
aircraft.</LD>
<TE>   "It will transform the way we will fight in the future," said
David Lanman, who oversees unmanned aircraft development at the Air
Force Research Laboratory in Ohio.</TE>
<TE>   Although it wasn't the first time that an aircraft flew
autonomously--rudimentary systems had been tested decades ago on
reconnaissance planes--the X-45A is the world's first unmanned attack
jet to do so.</TE>
<TE>   The X-45A has attracted particular attention since the Sept.11
terrorist attacks and subsequent military action in Afghanistan.
Military operations there have highlighted the utility of unmanned
aircraft for gathering military intelligence, such as Northrop
Grumman Corp.'s Global Hawk and remotely controlled General Atomic
Aeronautical System Inc.'s Predator.</TE>
<TE>   They raised interest in development of a next generation of
humanless aircraft that could not only gather intelligence but also
attack targets.</TE>
<TE>   The success of the flight, which will undergo intense review over
the next few weeks, represents a huge boost to Boeing's efforts to
develop unmanned aircraft.</TE>
<TE>   Smarting from losing the competition to develop the
next-generation fighter jet known as the Joint Strike Fighter, Boeing
created a business division to develop unmanned systems. Boeing's
strategy aims to eventually supersede the piloted JSF program,
considered the biggest defense contract in history.</TE>
<TE>   "This flight is a wonderful milestone for our UCAV team," said
Rich Alldredge, manager for Boeing's UCAV program.</TE>
<TE>   The X-45A was designed by Boeing Phantom Work engineers in Seattle
and St. Louis and assembled in St. Louis as part of a $191-million,
three-year contract with the Defense Advanced Research Projects
Agency, a Pentagon research arm.</TE>
<TE>   It uses the latest in composite plastic technology with advanced
electronics and powerful computers.</TE>
<TE>   Its wings for instance were constructed by Foam Matrix, an
Inglewood company operated by an avid surfer who pioneered strong
lightweight foam structures.</TE>
<TE>   Boeing engineers are currently designing a larger, more capable
successor to the X-45A, which would more closely resemble an
operational system. That plane is expected to undergo tests in 2005
with the goal of fielding an operational plane by 2008.</TE>
<TE>   In the interim, Boeing and the Air Force will send the X-45A aloft
every several weeks, flying it higher and faster and testing the
command and control systems. Wednesday's first flight, while
historic, was considered a baby step of sorts.</TE>
<TE>   After taking off from a dry lake bed that has hosted many
pioneering experimental aircraft such as the X-1 (first to break the
sound barrier) and the X-15 (fastest rocket plane), the plane flew a
simple loop over the Mojave Desert.</TE>
<TE>   "It looked awfully nice," Col. Michael Leahy, the Pentagon's
program manager for the UCAV program said during a media briefing
Thursday. "It was a flawless first flight."</TE>
<TE>   It rose to 7,500 feet, reaching a cruising speed of 195 knots and
then returning to base as an F-18 chase plane kept a close eye on its
flight.</TE>
<TE>   The Pentagon eventually wants a plane that can climb to 40,000
feet, evade radar and carry several so-called small diameter bombs
now under development.</TE>
<TE>   The small diameter bombs would weigh about 250 pounds but have the
same explosive effect as the commonly used 2,000-pound bomb.</TE>
<TE>   While the plane was pilotless, the emotion of the flight was still
palpable within the ground control station that was monitoring the
test Wednesday morning.</TE>
<TE>   "She's off!" a controller is heard as a video showed the plane
taking off at 7:26 a.m. It was immediately followed by a loud cheer.</TE>
<TE>   Citing security and safety reasons, the military refused to allow
reporters to witness the early morning flight and provided details a
day later.</TE>

<HD>2 Reports Help Ease Recession Concerns</HD>
<DH>Economy: Orders for durable goods rise strongly while
initial claims for jobless benefits decrease.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Worries about a double-dip U.S. recession faded Thursday as
government reports showed businesses splurging on new equipment in
April and fewer workers signing up for unemployment benefits last
week.</LD>
<LD>   The Commerce Department said new orders for durable goods shot
past expectations last month, boosted by a surge in demand for autos
and solid gains in computer equipment and machinery. Meanwhile, the
number of Americans lining up for the first time to claim state
jobless benefits fell in the latest week.</LD>
<LD>   The news is unlikely to have any near-term effect on Federal
Reserve policymaking. Analysts said the Fed probably will focus more
on the next employment report, due June 7, for evidence the labor
market is improving. U.S. central bank policymakers next meet June 25
and 26 to set interest rates.</LD>
<TE>   The Commerce Department said orders for durable goods climbed
1.1%, beating analysts' expectations for a 0.4% increase. Leading the
charge was a 12% gain in auto orders, the largest in more than three
years.</TE>
<TE>   In a sign that businesses are starting to invest again after the
recession that began in March 2001, orders of computer and electronic
products climbed 2.5%, the sharpest gain since October. Machinery
orders were up 4%.</TE>
<TE>   Business spending has been highlighted by Federal Reserve Chairman
Alan Greenspan as key to a sustained U.S. recovery. The report adds
weight to the central bank chief's comments in April that a revival
in this area was beginning.</TE>
<TE>   "The durable goods orders put another nail into the coffin for
people who are worried about a double dip," said Carey Leahy, senior
economist at Deutsche Bank Securities in New York. "You're starting
to see positive numbers for capital equipment spending, and if the
ISM orders and overall figures are correct, these numbers will
continue to strengthen."</TE>
<TE>   There was good news as well from the Labor Department, which said
initial jobless benefits claims for the week of May 18 fell 9,000 to
416,000. Wall Street had been expecting claims to fall to 412,000.</TE>

<HD>Immunex Says Enbrel Shortage Worse Than Anticipated</HD>
<DH>Pharmaceuticals: Those on waiting list might not get
arthritis drug until 2003. Doctors had been expecting it this summer.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DENISE GELLENE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Immunex Corp. is telling doctors that continued production problems
could prevent it from delivering its rheumatoid arthritis drug Enbrel
to the nearly 20,000 patients on its waiting list until next year,
much later than expected.</LD>
<LD>   The news, though anticipated on Wall Street, caught some doctors
and patient advocates off guard. Immunex has not added patients since
December but told doctors and patients as recently as March that the
medicine would be available in early summer.</LD>
<LD>   However, the letters said Immunex would not accept new patients
until "late in the year at the earliest." The letters also said the
82,000 current users of Enbrel will continue to experience delays in
getting their prescriptions filled "at least through the month of
June."</LD>
<TE>   Enbrel is the crown jewel in Amgen Inc.'s $15.3-billion
acquisition of Immunex, and the production delays could cost the
combined company $150 million in sales this year and $500 million
next year, said Fariba Ghodsian, an analyst with Roth Capital
Partners.</TE>
<TE>   "They are not keeping us current," said Nicola Cutsforth of the
National Psoriasis Foundation after learning about the delay from a
reporter. "This is very unfortunate."</TE>
<TE>   Enbrel also has been approved for treating psoriatic arthritis and
is being tested for psoriasis.</TE>
<TE>   Northwestern University rheumatologist Eric Ruderman said the
letters confirmed rumblings among doctors that the Enbrel shortage
had worsened. He said doctors who had been putting patients on the
waiting list probably will prescribe Remicade, a competing drug. The
medications have a similar effect on the disease, which results in
joint destruction.</TE>
<TE>   The shortage "is a big issue and a big problem," said Ruderman, a
member of Immunex's academic advisory board. "When we thought supply
would open up in July, we thought patients could muddle along and
wait. But now, six more months is a long time to wait."</TE>
<TE>   Doctors already have started prescribing Remicade more often. The
drug from Centocor Inc., a unit of Johnson &amp; Johnson, surpassed
Enbrel in sales during the first quarter and is expected to widen its
lead over the Immunex drug, although Remicade is used not only for
rheumatoid arthritis but also for Crohn's disease. Doctors said
patients who do well on Remicade won't switch to Enbrel.</TE>
<TE>   The shortage could affect doctors' prescribing habits as well.</TE>
<TE>   "Physicians are human beings and get used to doing things a
certain way," said UC San Diego rheumatologist Gary Firestein, a
member of the Food and Drug Administration's arthritis drug advisory
committee. "If they get into the habit of having only Remicade
around, they will be in that mind-set and give that drug to
patients."</TE>
<TE>   The letters arrived in doctors' offices on the heels of
shareholder votes last week approving Thousand Oaks-based Amgen's
acquisition of Immunex. Amgen said its first priority is fixing
Immunex's supply mess, a chronic situation that drove Immunex's
shares to the mid-$20s from a high of $80 two years ago, making it a
takeover target. The transaction needs government approval, which
could come next month.</TE>
<TE>   Enbrel supplies have been tight since November 2000, when Immunex
initiated a waiting list for the drug. But doctors said the current
shortage is the worst in memory.</TE>
<TE>   Immunex warned its then 85,000 Enbrel users in March that their
prescriptions could be delayed by "a few days to weeks" in April and
May. But doctors said some patients have waited up to a month to have
their prescriptions filled.</TE>
<TE>   Hope Reed said she was worried during the two weeks that her
13-year-old son went without Enbrel. The boy fatigued easily and
developed a vision problem related to his arthritis, his mother said.</TE>
<TE>   Reed said her son improved when he went back on the drug, which
patients must take twice a week. "But I am worried about the future,"
said Reed, who lives in Chino Hills. "Will we get it on time? Or will
there be another problem down the road?"</TE>
<TE>   Immunex has fallen "down in our eyes in terms of its ability to
take care of patients," said Allan Metzger, a rheumatologist at
Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles. Enbrel won't regain the
momentum it had with physicians, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "This isn't flag-waving against Enbrel," Metzger said. "They made
a terrible tactical error."</TE>
<TE>   Amgen Chairman and Chief Executive Kevin Sharer, in a brief
interview after the company's annual meeting, acknowledged the firm's
next potential blockbuster drug may have an image problem. The
shortage "can't be good for the brand," he said, adding Amgen plans
to "relaunch" Enbrel as soon as there is more drug to sell.</TE>
<TE>   Seattle-based Immunex has blamed the shortage on its inability to
forecast demand and on a series of production problems.</TE>
<TE>   In March, the company said its contract manufacturer in Germany,
Boehringer Ingelheim, produced less drug than expected. Last month,
Immunex said it fell behind schedule on plans to open a factory in
Rhode Island, and pushed the deadline to the end of the year from
mid-2002. (Amgen has consistently said the factory won't be ready
until the beginning of 2003.)</TE>
<TE>   Immunex also hit snags at a contract "fill and finish" plant in
North Carolina where drug produced in Rhode Island is packaged in
vials. Compliance issues at that plant also delayed government
approval of a cancer drug from Idec Pharmaceuticals Corp. this year.</TE>
<TE>   Immunex executives in recent weeks began backing away from
previous supply forecasts in interviews and calls with analysts.
Immunex Chief Operating Officer Peggy Phillips said in a telephone
interview three weeks ago that Enbrel shipments to current patients
"are returning to normal." She could not predict when patients would
come off the waiting list.</TE>
<TE>   However, some patient advocacy groups and doctors complained
Immunex has not kept them as well informed as Wall Street.</TE>
<TE>   Cutsforth, membership director of the National Psoriasis
Foundation, said a company representative told her in March that the
drug would become available for new patients in July. Since that
conversation, Cutsforth said, she has not been able to get anyone
from Immunex on the phone.</TE>
<TE>   The foundation plugged Enbrel in January when the drug received
FDA approval as a treatment for psoriatic arthritis, Cutsforth said.
It is the only drug approved for the condition, which affects the
skin and joints.</TE>
<TE>   "We touted this and it is not even available to us," she said.
"There is definitely a sense of frustration from patients that there
was all this hype about a new treatment and they can't get it."</TE>
<TE>   "Every time I get a letter from them, it says, 'two more weeks.'
I've stopped opening their letters," Firestein said.</TE>
<TE>   Immunex spokeswoman Robin Shapiro said the firm has discussed its
supply problems "in conference calls with analysts" and sent letters
to physicians after getting "greater clarity on the situation."</TE>
<TE>   She added: "I don't see [the letters] as a great departure from
what we've said."</TE>

<HD>Economic News, Surge in Biotech Push Up Indexes</HD>
<DH>Wall St.: Analysts say market is trying to keep terrorism,
war fears from overshadowing good omens, including a drop in jobless
claims.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After waffling most of the day on fears of more terror attacks,
stocks turned solidly higher late in the session Thursday, buoyed by
positive economic news and a surge in biotech shares.</LD>
<LD>   The gains followed an unexpected rise in orders for big-ticket
items and a drop in initial unemployment insurance claims, and
analysts said the market appeared to be doing its best to prevent
fears about terrorism from overshadowing upbeat economic news.</LD>
<LD>   However, fresh violence in Israel, a standoff between nuclear
powers Pakistan and India and concerns about U.S. vulnerability to
more terror attacks unnerved investors and spurred a rise in gold
prices to a 21/2-year high. Trading is likely to be light today ahead
of the three-day Memorial Day weekend.</LD>
<TE>   "There's a heightened awareness of terrorism, and the global
issues are part of the negative cast. There are all kinds of little
hot spots to cause a problem," said Mike Vogelzang, chief investment
officer at Boston Advisors, which has boosted its cash holdings
instead of buying stocks amid worries more turmoil could cause stocks
to tumble.</TE>
<TE>   The Dow Jones industrial average gained 58.2 points, or 0.6%, to
10,216.08, adding to Wednesday's 52-point gain. The
technology-focused Nasdaq composite index advanced 24.18 points, or
1.4%, to 1,697.63, and the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index was up 11.06
points, or 1.0%, at 1,097.08.</TE>
<TE>   Winners led losers by about 3 to 2 on Nasdaq and the New York
Stock Exchange. Trading volume, though moderate, was higher than
recent levels.</TE>
<TE>   The Commerce Department reported that orders for big purchases,
including cars and communications equipment, jumped 1.1% in April, a
bigger increase than expected. It was the fifth straight month that
orders for durable goods rose. A separate report from the Labor
Department showed that jobless claims dropped by 9,000 to 416,000
last week, the lowest level in eight weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Biotechnology shares helped boost major market indexes after a
U.S. advisory panel gave its backing for Biogen's Amevive, a drug to
treat the hard-to-cure skin disease psoriasis.</TE>
<TE>   The drug is viewed as crucial to the company's future growth.
Nasdaq did not allow trading in Biogen shares all day.</TE>
<TE>   This was one of the most closely watched drug approvals for one of
the country's biggest biotech companies. The sector has been hit by a
wave of Food and Drug Administration product rejections since the
start of the year. The Amex biotech index leaped 7.4%.</TE>
<TE>   Although biotech shares rallied, technology stocks were mixed.
Ciena dropped 36 cents to $6.08 on weak second-quarter sales and a
warning that the third quarter also could be disappointing. But
Microsoft jumped $1.13 to $54.82 and Cisco Systems gained 34 cents to
$16.90.</TE>
<TE>   Among blue chips, Boeing dropped 26 cents to $44.15 on news it
will deliver eight fewer wide-body jets than expected next year.</TE>
<TE>   In other market news:</TE>
<TE>   * Gold prices rose above $320 for the first time in 21/2 years,
gaining $4.50 to $322.50 an ounce as edgy investors around the world
sought a safe haven for cash. Shares of gold companies also gained as
investors bet that higher gold prices would drive up corporate
profits.</TE>
<TE>   Barrick Gold advanced 48 cents to $23.16, and Placer Dome rose 50
cents to $14.38.</TE>
<TE>   * Semiconductor stocks were among the worst performers on the
belief that prices for technology companies still were too high given
the slow economic recovery. Intel dropped 20 cents to $29.39, and
chip equipment maker Applied Materials lost 59 cents to $25.57. The
SOX index of semiconductor stocks fell 0.6%.</TE>
<TE>   * Graphics chip designer Nvidia fell $2.32 to $35.73. The company
reported strong quarterly earnings, but a run-up in the stock before
the report and guidance that may have been weaker than expected hurt
the shares. The stock had surged about 21% from May 6 to Wednesday's
close.</TE>
<TE>   * NetFlix.com rose $1.75, or 12%, to $16.75 in its first day of
trading on Nasdaq. The Los Gatos-based DVD-rental company raised
$82.5 million in its initial public stock offering.</TE>
<TE>   * Krispy Kreme rose $1.55 to $41.10 after reporting first-quarter
results slightly ahead of expectations.</TE>

<HD>Congress Members Urge Investigation of Radio Payola</HD>
<DH>Music: Move follows news that record labels, groups will
seek probe of broadcasters' practices.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHUCK PHILIPS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Several members of Congress on Thursday called for the federal
government to investigate whether Clear Channel Communications Inc.
and other radio broadcast giants are violating payola laws.</LD>
<LD>   Their comments follow a report in The Times disclosing that a
coalition of record companies and artist unions were preparing to
call for the Federal Communications Commission to probe questionable
promotion practices in the music industry, in which middlemen pay
radio stations for the exclusive right to pitch songs on behalf of
record labels.</LD>
<LD>   "What's happening here is a process that the record labels once
thought helped facilitate getting radio airplay has now become so
coercive and expensive ... that they've finally decided to ... come
forward publicly to expose a practice they participated in for a long
time," said Rep. Howard L. Berman (D-Mission Hills).</LD>
<TE>   There has been a federal payola statute for 40 years that
prohibits radio stations from accepting money for playing songs
without disclosing that information to listeners. The payola laws
were enacted after a scandal that exposed rock deejays taking money
from record labels to play certain songs.</TE>
<TE>   Seeking to distance themselves from airplay transactions, record
labels soon began hiring independent promoters to pitch their songs
to radio. But for years, record executives have privately
acknowledged the soaring cost of paying promoters in order to
sidestep the payola law. These promotions now cost the record labels
an estimated $150 million a year, sources said.</TE>
<TE>   Since 1996, the radio industry has rapidly consolidated through a
series of mergers. Clear Channel now controls about 1,225 radio
stations, and its rival Infinity, owned by Viacom Inc., controls
about 200 stations.</TE>
<TE>   The Recording Industry Assn. of America and other music groups
claim that the cost of getting a song played on the air continues to
rise.</TE>
<TE>   "The issues in this complaint raise critical 1st Amendment and
communications law issues," said Rep. John Conyers Jr. (D-Mich.).
"[We need] a full and complete airing of the matter so we can begin
to resolve these allegations and protect the best interests of both
creators and the listening public."</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Russell D. Feingold (D-Wis.) said Thursday that he plans to
introduce legislation to strengthen payola laws and other problems
accelerated by deregulation in the broadcast industry.</TE>
<TE>   "We need to close the loopholes in the existing laws," said
Feingold, who also wants to set a cap on radio station ownership.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, executives at Clear Channel denied any wrongdoing and
said the record labels were using the broadcast giant as a scapegoat
for their own problems.</TE>
<TE>   "Clearly, the [record] labels are in trouble these days, but it's
not our fault," said Randy Michaels, chief executive of the radio
division of Clear Channel. "We didn't create the independent
promotion system. They did. We're just dealing with the animal that
exists.</TE>
<TE>   "For us to be cast as the bad guy here is ridiculous," Michaels
added. "The fact is we've done more than anyone else in this business
to try to clean up what everyone knows was an ugly and corrupt
system."</TE>
<TE>   The current promotion system followed another payola scandal in
the late 1980s. Since then, independent promoters have hired former
FCC attorneys to help them sidestep the law by paying broadcasters
annual promotional fees they say are not tied to airplay of specific
songs.</TE>
<TE>   Radio stations are required to sign a contract each year for this
"promotional" fee, which says they are not obligated to play any
record the independent promoter pitches. All the station must do is
tell the promoter in advance which songs it will add to its playlist
each week. The promoter then turns around and collects as much as
$4,000 per song from the record labels that hire him, according to
promoters and labels.</TE>
<TE>   For more than a decade, this arrangement has allowed promoters to
exert influence over airplay while keeping record firms at an
arms-length from such transactions. On paper, the arrangement
satisfied the FCC, and in practice, record companies got new songs on
the air, various promoters said.</TE>
<TE>   When Clear Channel and other radio groups began buying up more
stations, the broadcast giants wanted to tap into more of these
promotional funds. So they designated specific independent promoters
to be their exclusive representatives for a group of stations with
record labels. But not only did promotional prices rise, record
executives privately said, the independent promoters began to adhere
closer to the law and had less influence over airplay.</TE>
<TE>   "Blaming the radio industry for independent music promotion is
blatantly absurd," said Kraig Kitchin, president of Premier Radio
Networks, a division of Clear Channel Radio. "The day [the labels]
choose to discontinue to pay the independent music promotion
companies is the day it stops."</TE>

<HD>Peregrine Will Restate Results; SEC Investigating</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Software maker Peregrine Systems Inc. said Thursday that it would
restate nearly three years of results and disclosed that federal
regulators have launched a formal probe of its accounting practices.</LD>
<LD>   San Diego-based Peregrine, whose software enables companies to
track physical assets, also said it may cut more of its work force
and will study financing alternatives.</LD>
<LD>   The announcement came less than two weeks after the company said
its audit committee would investigate whether it had failed to adjust
revenue from software deals made through partners, consultants and
retailers if a product was returned.</LD>
<TE>   Such indirect sales account for about 40% of Peregrine's revenue.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a logical sort of extension of the announcement they had
a couple of weeks ago," CIBC World Markets Corp. analyst Brad Reback
said.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think they'll go bankrupt. They clearly will be a much
smaller company when this is all done."</TE>
<TE>   However, Pacific Crest Securities analyst Brendan Barnicle said
the company may be running out of cash. Peregrine cut 450 jobs in
February, leaving it with 3,500 employees.</TE>
<TE>   The company said it would restate results for fiscal 2000, fiscal
2001 and the first three quarters of fiscal 2002 to correct
inaccurate accounting of as much as $100 million in revenue. It said
it intends to cooperate fully with a Securities and Exchange
Commission investigation into its accounting practices.</TE>
<TE>   Peregrine shares rose 6 cents, to $1.59 on Nasdaq. The stock was
above $80 in 2000 and was as high as $33.55 in the last year.</TE>
<TE>   On April 6, Peregrine announced the resignations of Chairman and
Chief Executive Steve Gardner and Chief Financial Officer Matt Gless
and said it might have to restate results.</TE>
<TE>   The news drove its shares down more than 60% to below $1.</TE>
<TE>   Peregrine's new auditor, KPMG, which replaced Arthur Andersen,
brought the accounting problems to the board's attention.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, Peregrine delayed reporting results for the fourth
quarter of fiscal 2002, citing the auditor change.</TE>

<HD>SEC to Weigh Rules Requiring Analysts to Certify Research</HD>
<DH>Securities: They would be personally liable for fraud if
their reports don't reflect their views.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Securities and Exchange Commission will soon consider rules
requiring stock analysts to certify that their research reports
reflect their views, SEC Chairman Harvey Pitt said.</LD>
<LD>   "I think if we can get a rule of that nature, we can have a very
dramatic effect on the standard of honesty in analyst reports," Pitt
said in an interview with public television's "Nightly Business
Report."</LD>
<LD>   Such a rule would make analysts personally liable for fraud if
their reports didn't reflect their views, he said. The SEC approved
rules this month that would forbid analysts from reporting to
investment bankers and from trading against their recommendations.</LD>
<TE>   The SEC might consider a second round of rule making if the
agency's investigation of Wall Street analysts yields evidence
calling for additional standards, Pitt said.</TE>
<TE>   Pitt opened an inquiry into a dozen Wall Street firms last month
after New York Atty. Gen. Eliot Spitzer started investigating Merrill
Lynch &amp; Co. and turned up evidence that analysts were disparaging
stocks they were touting. Merrill settled the New York probe this
week.</TE>
<TE>   It's "quite likely" the SEC will consider a second set of analyst
rules, Mary Schapiro, president of the National Assn. of Securities
Dealers' regulatory arm, has said. The NASD, which is joining the SEC
in its investigation, is likely to bring some enforcement cases
against analysts by the end of the year, she said.</TE>
<TE>   The SEC rules approved this month also would prohibit analysts
from being paid out of specific banking deals. Analysts would be
prohibited from trading against their recommendations, and they and
their firms would be required to disclose whether they own stocks
being reviewed.</TE>

<HD>News on Psoriasis Drug Buoys Biotech</HD>
<DH>Pharmaceuticals: Panel's recommendation that FDA approve
Biogen's Amevive sparks a stock rally in the sector.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DENISE GELLENE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An advisory panel Thursday recommended Food and Drug Administration
approval of Biogen Inc.'s psoriasis drug, triggering a long-awaited
rally in biotechnology stocks.</LD>
<LD>   The expert committee voted 8-2 in support of Amevive as a
treatment for moderate to severe psoriasis. The FDA isn't required to
follow the panel's advice, but it usually does.</LD>
<LD>   The drug is important to Cambridge, Mass.-based Biogen, whose
sales have been driven by its multiple sclerosis drug Avonex. But
analysts expect Avonex sales to slow with the recent launch of
Serono's Rebif. Rebif won FDA approval after Serono presented data
showing its drug was superior to Avonex, which is expected to have
sales of $1.1 billion this year.</LD>
<TE>   Amevive would be the first biotechnology drug for psoriasis, an
inflammatory skin disease that has no cure. As first to market,
Biogen would have an advantage over what is expected to become a
crowded field in the next multibillion-dollar disease category.</TE>
<TE>   An estimated 1 million Americans have moderate to severe
psoriasis, which currently is treated with ultraviolet radiation;
methotrexate, a chemotherapy drug; or cyclosporine, an
immunosuppressant. The drugs have serious side effects, and radiation
increases the risk of skin cancer.</TE>
<TE>   Genentech Inc. and Immunex Corp., which is being acquired by Amgen
Inc., are expected to file marketing applications with the FDA next
year. Immunex is testing its rheumatoid arthritis drug Enbrel on
psoriasis. Genentech is developing a new drug called Xanelim with
partner Xoma Ltd.</TE>
<TE>   The Biogen psoriasis drug works by targeting T-cells, specific
immune system cells involved in inflammation. An article published in
the New England Journal of Medicine in July showed that 42% to 63% of
patients showed improvement 12 weeks after taking the drug. The
article reported that 26 patients had disease remissions that lasted
185 to 533 days after treatment.</TE>
<TE>   The FDA, in a report prepared for the panel, raised questions
about the long-term safety of a drug that suppresses the immune
system. But the agency also noted that there was no evidence that the
lower T-cell counts were associated with serious infection. Investors
in search of good news about biotech stocks seized on the panel's
recommendation and drove the closely watched Amex biotechnology index
up 7.4%. The Nasdaq biotechnology index climbed 6.3%. Trading in
Biogen shares was halted.</TE>
<TE>   The sector had been hurt by a series of setbacks, such as the
FDA's decision to reject an application for ImClone Systems Inc.'s
cancer drug Erbitux. At the same time, investors have not reacted to
good news in the sector, said Jim McCamant, editor of the Medical
Technology Stock Letter in Berkeley. The market barely reacted when
San Diego-based Idec Pharmaceuticals Corp. received approval to
market the first-ever radioactive antibody this year. And it ignored
positive results presented at the American Society of Clinical
Oncology meeting that ended this week, he said.</TE>
<TE>   McCamant cautiously predicted that the Biogen news would fuel a
continued surge in biotech stocks.</TE>
<TE>   The sector "is finally gaining momentum on the upside," he said.
"It is likely to trigger a rally, but it is hard to have confidence
because of how bizarre the market has been this year."</TE>

<HD>Personal Robot of the Future Today</HD>
<DH>Technology: Evolution Robotics unveils its ER1, the first
mass-produced automaton to perform helpful tasks.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRISTINE FREY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Want another cold one?</LD>
<LD>   Don't get up.</LD>
<LD>   Just show the ER1 robot--essentially a laptop on wheels--an empty
bottle and it can scoot across the room and pick out a Heineken from
among cans of Coke and Mountain Dew.</LD>
<TE>   After grabbing the beer in its mechanical claw, the 2-foot-tall
ER1 returns with the brew and a pleasant "Here you go."</TE>
<TE>   Since the dawn of the Industrial Age, humans have dreamed of
intelligent machines to attend to mundane chores. Industrial robots
have assembled cars for years, putting the same weld in the same spot
hundreds of times a day.</TE>
<TE>   But household robots such as Rosey from "The Jetsons" have been
difficult to develop because the average three-bedroom house is
infinitely more chaotic than the controlled environs of a factory
floor.</TE>
<TE>   The $500 ER1, developed by Pasadena-based Evolution Robotics and
unveiled this week at the Electronics Entertainment Expo, looks and
acts more like personal robots of the future: "Much more mundane,
much more useful and much more simple," said Bill Gross, chief
executive of Idealab, the high-tech incubator that spun off Evolution
this year.</TE>
<TE>   Capable of performing 99 distinct behaviors, the ER1 can grab
things from the kitchen, greet visitors at the front door, find car
keys and snap photographs of the baby-sitter. Unlike other personal
robots such as Sony's AIBO dog, the ER1 is the first mass-produced
automaton to perform at least nominally helpful tasks.</TE>
<TE>   Experts say Evolution Robotics may do for the personal robot what
Microsoft did for the personal computer by setting a standard
operating environment in which others can innovate. The company
expects early adopters and hobbyists to develop applications for the
robot, much as software developers did for the first personal
computers. Once Evolution Robotics determines how people use the
robots, the company plans to release models pre-programmed for
specific purposes--such as security or elderly care--later this year.</TE>
<TE>   The personal computer eventually found its place in the home and
office, but it is uncertain if the personal robot will be as welcome.
Unlike a PC, which can perform multiple tasks, individual robots
probably will have specific purposes. Even with recent advances in
processing power, sensors and object-recognition systems that have
improved robotic capabilities, designing a machine capable of
completing even a relatively modest list of diverse chores is
prohibitively complex.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think there's a concept of a general-purpose robot for
the home, just like there is for the general-purpose computer," said
Jean-Claude Latombe, director of the Stanford Robotics Laboratory. So
one machine might mow the lawn, another would vacuum the living room
floor and a third would clean the kitchen.</TE>
<TE>   "The idea is not one single butler, but you can think of it as an
army of little butlers," said Maja Mataric, director of the USC
Robotics Research Laboratories and a member of Evolution Robotics'
scientific advisory board.</TE>
<TE>   Over time, applications may become more complicated. Robots that
teach children could read facial expressions to determine a child's
comprehension. Others could remind users to pick up milk from the
store on the way home from work.</TE>
<TE>   The first versions of ER1 are geared toward hobbyists, the same
sort of gear-heads who snapped up Lego's Mindstorms robot kits.</TE>
<TE>   The ER1 is essentially a metal box with a camera on wheels. Users
attach a laptop. The software's graphic interface, which displays the
view from the robot's camera, allows users to program the robot
directly on the laptop or, with a wireless connection, on a remote
computer.</TE>
<TE>   Users select one of five "if" conditions--such as sight, sound and
time--and assign it a corresponding response: move, play a sound, run
a program, send a message or record. If, for instance, a robot hears,
"Bring me a beer," it could be programmed to find a beer and return
it to the user.</TE>
<TE>   Evolution Robotics created its own object-recognition system that
enables robots to identify human faces. The robot also can recognize
voices. Peripherals--an arm, "skin" cover and charger to which the
robot can be programmed to routinely connect--will eventually be
available.</TE>
<TE>   Evolution Robotics also sells more sophisticated kits that allow
engineers to build custom robots. Evolution Robotics President
Bernard Louvat calls the kits, which sell for between $1,500 and
$10,000, "Lego Mindstorms on steroids."</TE>
<TE>   The developer kits require basic programming knowledge of C++ and
Linux.</TE>
<TE>   One of the company's custom robots--called Ultrabot--can follow a
person walking in front of it. Another moves according to voice
commands. The computer-generated face on its laptop screen frowns
when it bumps into obstacles and smiles when it successfully
accomplishes its task. A third robot identifies a book, box of cereal
and $1 bill.</TE>
<TE>   After watching an Evolution Robotics demonstration Thursday,
Darryl Williams said he hoped such robots would perform additional
tasks in the future. But for some people, he pointed out, the ability
to get refills without leaving the couch--and missing the game--may
be enough.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe after a couple of years of getting beers it pays for itself
and you're happy."</TE>

<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Florida judge declared a mistrial in a lawsuit brought against
Philip Morris Cos. and other cigarette makers by a flight attendant
who said he was harmed by secondhand smoke on the job.</LD>
<LD>   Trial Judge Fredricka Smith ended the second individual flight
attendant trial against tobacco firms after American Airlines flight
attendant Juan Queipo, 42, passed out in front of jurors for a second
straight day, Philip Morris said. Smith told jurors after the first
blackout that Queipo's condition was unrelated to the tobacco claims.</LD>
<LD>   Queipo claims he developed chronic sinusitis from breathing
secondhand smoke, and he sought unspecified compensatory damages from
Philip Morris, R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Holdings Inc. and Loews Corp.'s
Lorillard Tobacco Co.</LD>
<TE>   Philip Morris shares rose 38 cents to $55.45, R.J. Reynolds shares
rose 16 cents to $68.86 and Loews shares rose 24 cents to $57.85, all
on the NYSE.</TE>

<LD>The legal battle between the Dixie Chicks and Sony Music
Entertainment appears close to resolution after the Japanese record
conglomerate said it would deliver the trio's new single, "Long Time
Gone," to radio stations.</LD>
<LD>   The popular country music act filed a breach of contract suit
against Sony in August, claiming it was owed $4 million due to
"systematic thievery" and Sony's "corrupt" accounting practices.</LD>
<LD>   The Dixie Chicks then met with competitors EMI Group and
Bertelsmann Music Group but failed to strike a new record deal before
returning to the negotiating table last month with Sony, sources
said.</LD>
<TE>   A renegotiated contract deal with Sony is expected to be hammered
out within weeks.</TE>

<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Vans Inc. said it expects to post a loss for its fiscal first quarter
that's wider than analysts expected, in part because its
skateboarding parks have significantly under-performed.</LD>
<LD>   The Santa Fe Springs-based maker of athletic shoes said it expects
a loss of 68 cents a share, including costs of $8.6million, or 48
cents a share, for closing its skateboarding park in Bakersfield,
severance pay and writing down the value of its Denver skate park and
of slow-moving inventory.</LD>
<LD>   Excluding one-time costs, Vans expects a loss of 16 cents, much
larger than the 9-cent loss analysts forecast.</LD>
<TE>   The firm expects revenue to fall to $60 million to $61 million,
from $85.2 million a year ago, with same-store sales off 8%.</TE>
<TE>   Vans shares fell as low as $11.74 in after-hours trading after
closing up 42 cents at $12.73 on Nasdaq before the announcement.</TE>

<LD>Barnes &amp; Noble Inc. said its first-quarter net loss widened as it
took a $14.9-million write-down for its investment in Gemstar-TV
Guide International Inc., whose shares tumbled 75% last year. The
largest U.S. bookstore chain raised its annual profit forecast
because of surging video game sales at its 60%-owned GameStop Corp.
video game chain.</LD>
<LD>   The loss widened to $16.3 million, or 25 cents a share, from $11.5
million, or 18 cents, a year earlier. Sales rose 12% to $1.13billion.</LD>
<LD>   Excluding the write-down, Barnes &amp; Noble had a loss of 2 cents a
share, better than the 5-cent loss analysts expected.</LD>
<TE>   Shares of New York-based Barnes &amp; Noble fell 40 cents to $32.48 on

<LD>The new CD by Eminem hasn't been released officially, but it's
already in heavy rotation among computer users, according to survey
by Gracenote, a digital music service based in Berkeley.</LD>
<LD>   In a sign of widespread piracy, Gracenote said "The Eminem Show,"
which is due in stores Tuesday, was the second-most-frequently-played
CD on computers last week--the highest showing ever by an unreleased
album.</LD>
<LD>   David Hyman, Gracenote's chief executive, said 86.5% of the
activity came from the U.S.</LD>
<TE>   A spokesman at Eminem's label, Vivendi Universal unit Interscope,

<HD>Superior Shares Tumble 12%</HD>
<DH>Automotive: A Prudential analyst cuts the stock's rating
amid worries about the future of aluminum wheels.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters and Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Shares of automotive parts maker Superior Industries International
Inc. dropped 12% on Thursday after Prudential Securities downgraded
the stock to "sell," saying new steel wheels for cars could replace
the aluminum wheels made by Superior.</LD>
<LD>   In a statement released after the close of trading, Van Nuys-based
Superior said its business outlook remains strong and is without any
fundamental change that would account for recent weakness in the
company's stock price.</LD>
<LD>   Company Chairman Louis Borick also defended his sale of 600,000
Superior Industries shares this month, a move that might have saved
him nearly $5 million amid Thursday's decline.</LD>
<TE>   Prudential analyst Michael Bruynesteyn cut his rating on Superior
from "hold" and said he expects a "fundamental shift" in wheel buying
based on new designs for steel wheels. He said steel wheels can be
produced at half the cost of aluminum wheels, potentially saving $100
a vehicle. Bruynesteyn didn't return calls.</TE>
<TE>   General Motors Corp. spokesman Jim Parks said the world's leading
auto maker is looking at using steel wheels on the base models of
some of its cars and offering aluminum wheels as an option as part of
an ongoing cost-savings program. Superior, a valued GM supplier, is
aware of the initiative, he added.</TE>
<TE>   Superior shares fell $6.06, or 12%, to $43.84 on Thursday on the
New York Stock Exchange. Trading in the shares had been delayed early
in the day due to of an order imbalance. Just two weeks ago the stock
hit an all-time high of $53.80.</TE>
<TE>   "The analyst's report is based on anecdotal evidence with which
the company doesn't agree," said Superior's chief financial officer,
Jeff Ornstein.</TE>
<TE>   Borick said his company continues to win large new and replacement
aluminum wheel contracts and sees a significant growth opportunity in
its new aluminum suspension components business.</TE>
<TE>   Borick also said he sold 600,000 Superior Industries shares during
the last two weeks after exercising options that he had held for more
than nine years and that were about to expire. Borick, who has been
Superior's president and chairman since 1957, had filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission to sell 750,000 shares.</TE>
<TE>   "I filed to sell the shares on May 7th and I was only aware of
Bruynesteyn's report [Wednesday]," he told Bloomberg News.</TE>
<TE>   Based on the $51.83 average closing price for the company's stock
in the two weeks ending Friday, 600,000 shares would bring about
$31.1 million. The same sale after Thursday's drop would bring about
$26.3 million.</TE>
<TE>   As of March 1, Borick owned 4.43 million shares, or about 17% of
the firm's outstanding shares.</TE>

<HD>States Join Task Force to Probe Brokerages</HD>
<DH>Inquiry: Securities regulators will investigate alleged
conflicts of interest that some say may reveal worse behavior than
that exposed at Merrill Lynch.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>E. SCOTT RECKARD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>More than 30 states have joined a nationwide task force investigating
alleged conflicts of interest among Wall Street stock analysts in a
probe that some say could turn up worse behavior than what Merrill
Lynch &amp; Co. was accused of.</LD>
<LD>   A coalition of state securities regulators is probing dozens of
additional securities firms, said a spokesman for the North American
Securities Administrators Assn. The states are "taking major Wall
Street players and dividing them up" for investigation, said
California Department of Corporations spokesman Andre Pineda.</LD>
<LD>   The state probes are starting with volumes of material obtained by
investigators for New York Atty. Gen. Eliot Spitzer, who alleged that
Merrill analysts issued false and misleading stock reports to help
the firm win lucrative business handling stocks, bonds and mergers
for companies they covered.</LD>
<TE>   One source said the investigations may turn up worse conflicts of
interest than those exposed at Merrill, where investigators dug up
e-mails that revealed Internet analysts privately describing their
choice stock picks as "junk."</TE>
<TE>   Merrill "was clearly not the worst offender," said a source close
to Spitzer, predicting the attorney general and other securities
regulators would publicly disclose additional incriminating evidence
against other firms. Merrill agreed this week to pay a $100-million
fine to settle Spitzer's investigation. Merrill officials apologized,
but did not admit wrongdoing.</TE>
<TE>   The states are working alongside the Securities and Exchange
Commission, the National Assn. of Securities Dealers and the New York
Stock Exchange, whose joint investigation of analyst practices was
upstaged when Spitzer in April posted online a 30-page affidavit of
incriminating e-mails from Merrill executives such as former star
analyst Henry Blodget.</TE>
<TE>   Spitzer's office said it remains the lead investigator for Salomon
Smith Barney Inc., where analyst Jack Grubman followed telecom
stocks, now one of the market's most battered sectors. It also is the
lead on Morgan Stanley, where Mary Meeker, like Blodget, was among
the most prominent bulls on Internet stocks.</TE>
<TE>   Salomon volunteered this week to adopt the same reforms separating
analysts from investment bankers that Merrill made as part of its
settlement.</TE>
<TE>   Sources said other investment firms also have indicated they are
willing to do so.</TE>
<TE>   As the states conduct their investigations, they "absolutely" will
obtain e-mails and other confidential communications from the dozens
of securities firms under scrutiny, said S. Anthony Taggart, director
of the Utah Division of Securities.</TE>
<TE>   Taggart said he's confident that private communications not turned
up by Spitzer can be obtained under state laws governing securities
firms. He predicted the investigation, "far larger than any
jurisdiction could do on its own," would unearth and disclose
additional analyst conflicts. He noted that although Spitzer didn't
disclose all incriminating evidence against Merrill, he wouldn't
allow the firm to negotiate a settlement that kept it entirely
secret.</TE>
<TE>   "From an investor protection standpoint, it would be great if this
[conduct] didn't happen elsewhere," Taggart said. "But I'm sure we'll
find problems at other firms."</TE>

<HD>'Fast-Track' Trade Measure OKd by Senate</HD>
<DH>Legislation: Bill to renew presidential authority includes
sharply higher federal benefits for workers who lose jobs because of
imports.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Senate agreed Thursday to expand President Bush's authority to
negotiate new trade agreements but reserved the right to strike
provisions that could endanger U.S. jobs.</LD>
<LD>   The Senate voted 66 to 30 to approve its modified version of trade
promotion authority, which empowers the president to negotiate trade
pacts that Congress can accept or reject, but not amend. The House
approved its version of "fast-track" authority in December by one
vote.</LD>
<LD>   In addition to carving out an important exception to the
president's negotiating authority, the Senate insisted on packaging
fast-track with a big expansion of federal benefits for workers who
lose their jobs because of imports.</LD>
<TE>   The changes may be too much for the House to accept, setting the
stage for weeks of haggling over compromise legislation. Sponsors
said they hope to have a final bill ready for Bush's signature by
August.</TE>
<TE>   Even so, advancing any kind of bill was seen as a big
accomplishment for trade advocates, who have been fighting a powerful
tide of protectionist sentiment with congressional elections only
months away.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a great victory," said Sen. Phil Gramm (R-Texas). "George
W. Bush will use this authority on a very large scale for free trade
in the Americas and free trade all around the world."</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Trade Representative Robert B. Zoellick said trade promotion
authority "will provide the administration with the tools to pry open
markets and negotiate the best deals for our workers, farmers and
consumers."</TE>
<TE>   But critics said the United States has been entering into trade
deals with governments that allow businesses to exploit cheap labor
and degrade the environment. "It's just 'free trade, free trade, free
trade,'" said Sen. Byron L. Dorgan (D-N.D.). "Nobody cares about the
word 'fair.' Nobody will utter it in the U.S. Senate."</TE>
<TE>   For 20 years every president from Gerald R. Ford to Bill Clinton
enjoyed some form of trade promotion authority. But fast-track lapsed
in 1994 after the bruising battle over the North American Free Trade
Agreement, and the Republican-led Congress rebuffed Clinton's request
to renew it.</TE>
<TE>   Bush wants fast-track authority to help him extend trade
preferences to key allies, such as Morocco, an Arab nation that has
supported the U.S. anti-terrorism campaign. A larger objective is
approval of a Free Trade Area of the Americas, which would expand
NAFTA to include every nation in the hemisphere except Cuba.</TE>
<TE>   The biggest prize would be completion of a new global trade
agreement on terms favorable to the United States. A new round of
negotiations was launched in November in Doha, Qatar, but the
administration has said that it cannot advance U.S. interests
effectively without fast-track authority.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't have 535 people in Congress negotiating with other
nations," said Sen. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa). "If we're going to
succeed at the negotiating table, our partners need to know that the
person they're talking to has the authority to negotiate."</TE>
<TE>   But the outlook for passage of the trade bill has been clouded by
an amendment allowing the Senate to potentially amend or remove
provisions of future trade pacts that would weaken existing laws
designed to protect U.S. industries from unfair trade practices. Such
laws allow the government to impose protective tariffs if foreign
firms "dump" their goods in U.S. markets at less than the cost of
production or if a surge of imports jeopardizes U.S. manufacturers.
Bush invoked the latter protection when he imposed stiff tariffs on
imported steel earlier this year.</TE>
<TE>   Administration officials have said the amendment, sponsored by
Sens. Mark Dayton (D-Minn.) and Larry E. Craig (R-Idaho), would
cripple America's ability to promote trade liberalization around the
world because other governments would be unwilling to strike deals
that could be picked apart by the Senate.</TE>
<TE>   They have hinted that Bush might veto the legislation if it
reaches his desk with the amendment intact.</TE>
<TE>   Grassley predicted that the provision would be removed in
conference. "You can't have Dayton-Craig in there and still have
fast-track," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The struggle to renew fast-track reflects the gradual unraveling
of the bipartisan business-labor coalition that helped previous
administrations pass trade measures. The politics of trade have
become increasingly polarized in recent years and could influence the
outcome of tight races in some congressional districts this fall.</TE>
<TE>   Underlying the debate is growing public unease with the forces of
globalization and their effect on employment in the United States.
The reduction of quotas and tariffs on imported goods has eliminated
hundreds of thousands of jobs in steel, textiles, furniture and other
industries facing competition from foreign producers who pay lower
wages and face fewer workplace and environmental restrictions.</TE>
<TE>   "There never has been any such thing as free trade, and never will
be," said Sen. Ernest F. Hollings (D-S.C.), whose state has been hard
hit by textile layoffs. "It's like world peace.... It won't happen in
my lifetime."</TE>
<TE>   The administration and its allies, including many mainstream
economists, argue that trade liberalization produces huge benefits
for the nation as a whole. Lower-cost imports enable Americans to buy
more for their money, causing living standards to rise. The
administration estimates that previous trade pacts are saving the
typical family $2,000 a year. Expanded trade also creates jobs in
industries that export goods and services, offsetting employment
losses in other sectors of the economy.</TE>
<TE>   The bill tries to help the casualties of globalization by
significantly expanding Trade Adjustment Assistance, a federal
program providing temporary income and vocational training to people
who lose their jobs because of imports.</TE>
<TE>   The Senate measure would extend the cash payments, which average
about $220 a week, by six months so they would not run out before the
end of a two-year training program.</TE>
<TE>   It would provide a new tax credit to help trade-displaced workers
retain their health insurance and would create a wage insurance
program to provide temporary assistance to older workers who take
lower-paying jobs instead of enrolling in training programs.</TE>
<TE>   The bill also extends adjustment-assistance eligibility to
farmers, ranchers, fishermen and workers employed by suppliers,
subcontractors or other "secondary" businesses.</TE>
<TE>   The adjustment-assistance provisions would triple the program's
costs to an estimated $1.2 billion a year and are likely to be
opposed by House Republicans. But supporters say they will provide
Bush with several critical votes from House Democrats who opposed
fast-track in December.</TE>
<TE>   The Senate measure also would renew the Andean Trade Preference
Act, an expired law that waived tariffs on products from Bolivia,
Colombia, Ecuador and Peru.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration says preferential treatment is needed to
help wean those countries from cocaine production, but it is opposed
by U.S. textile interests who say it jeopardizes American jobs.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, the bill would extend the Generalized System of
Preferences, which provides duty-free status to certain products from
140 developing countries.</TE>

<HD>Casino Firms, Union Near Pact</HD>
<DH>Labor: Operators of Caesars, other sites in Las Vegas in
tentative agreement with hotel, restaurant workers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DOUG YOUNG</AU>
<BD>REUTERS</BD>
<DL>LOS ANGELES</DL>
<LD>Three Las Vegas casino operators reached a tentative deal with the
union representing housekeepers, cooks and restaurant servers
Thursday, lessening the chances of a crippling strike in the gambling
mecca as other casino groups continue their labor talks.</LD>
<LD>   Park Place Entertainment Corp. and Aztar Corp. reached their
initial agreement with the Culinary Workers union early Thursday, a
Park Place spokesman said. Harrah's Entertainment Inc. reached its
tentative pact with the 50,000-member union later in the day,
according to a source familiar with the situation.</LD>
<LD>   Las Vegas-based Park Place's resorts include Caesars Palace and
Bally's, and Aztar's include Tropicana and Harrah's Las Vegas.</LD>
<TE>   Park Place said it agreed not to discuss details of the accord
until a ratification vote is held by union members.</TE>
<TE>   Other major casino operators, including MGM Mirage, Mandalay
Resort Group and Harrah's Entertainment Inc., are holding their own
contract talks in a bid to avert a strike that could severely hurt
Las Vegas' economy.</TE>
<TE>   Union members voted overwhelmingly last week to authorize their
leaders to call a strike if a new agreement is not reached by the May
31 deadline.</TE>
<TE>   The main issues in the current talks include rising health-care
costs and working hours for housekeepers.</TE>
<TE>   MGM Mirage spokesman Alan Feldman said his company is confident it
will soon reach an agreement with the union.</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for the culinary union confirmed the tentative
contract with Park Place but would not comment further.</TE>
<TE>   The union estimates the economic effect of the first 30 days of a
new strike would roughly equal that of the first month of the
downturn after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, when casino occupancy
rates plunged to as low as 50%.</TE>
<TE>   The last time union workers on the Strip went on strike was in
1984, when they walked off the job for 67 days.</TE>
<TE>   Casinos laid off thousands of workers in a bid to remain solvent
after Sept. 11, but have hired many back in recent months as business
improved.</TE>
<TE>   In a new sign of recovery, Mandalay on Thursday announced plans to
add a $225-million hotel tower to its flagship resort on the Strip.</TE>
<TE>   The company also reported profit of 71 cents a share for its
fiscal first quarter, a penny better than analysts expected, and said
hotel revenue should be up modestly in the current quarter after
about a year of decline.</TE>

<HD>EToys Sues Goldman Sachs Over IPO</HD>
<DH>Courts: Underwriter is accused of underpricing shares,
getting kickbacks when stock soared.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Internet toy seller EToys Inc., which has filed for bankruptcy, said
Thursday that it filed a lawsuit against Wall Street firm Goldman
Sachs Group Inc. for allegedly mishandling its 1999 initial public
offering.</LD>
<LD>   The suit--filed in New York Supreme Court--alleges that Goldman,
one of the leading underwriters of IPOs, intentionally underpriced
EToys' offering and received kickbacks from its customers, who
profited when the shares soared.</LD>
<LD>   It charges Goldman (ticker symbol: GS) with fraud and breach of
contract and fiduciary duty. A Goldman spokeswoman declined to
comment on the suit.</LD>
<TE>   Thousands of individual investors have sued dozens of investment
banks alleging fraud in the way they doled out shares of IPOs. This
case--which echoes a federal investigation into IPO allocation
practices--is part of an emerging trend in which companies sue their
underwriters as well.</TE>
<TE>   Goldman shares rose 97 cents to $79.17 in New York Stock Exchange
trading.</TE>
<TE>   ETrade CEO Returned Pay to Settle Lawsuit</TE>
<TE>   Although ETrade Group Inc. Chief Executive Christos Cotsakos cited
"shareholder concerns" when he agreed this month to return almost
one-quarter of the $77 million he was paid last year, the decision
came after weeks of negotiations with lawyers for a shareholder who
sued the Internet brokerage firm in December.</TE>
<TE>   ETrade (ET) also agreed to other restrictions, said attorney
Darren Robbins, whose firm represents the shareholder, such as not
granting new restricted stock to Cotsakos for two years and
consulting with Robbins on the appointment of a director with no
affiliations to the company who will sit on the board's compensation
committee.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, Menlo Park, Calif.-based ETrade confirmed the
settlement with shareholder Thomas Barry, saying it has launched a
formal search for an outside director to chair its compensation
committee. That person will take over from David Hayden, who recently
resigned as chairman of San Francisco-based Critical Path Inc.
(CPTH), which does business with the online brokerage. However,
Hayden will remain on the compensation committee.</TE>
<TE>   Robbins had sued ETrade, Cotsakos and eight directors, claiming
the company misused its assets by forgiving a $15-million loan to the
CEO in September 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Cotsakos' compensation included $29 million in restricted stock
and $30 million for the loan and taxes on the loan, more than
quadruple what any Wall Street CEO earned. The rewards, granted
during a year when ETrade lost $241 million, infuriated many
shareholders, who questioned whether ETrade's board had become too
close to Cotsakos. The brokerage said May 10 that Cotsakos would give
back more than a quarter of that pay.</TE>
<TE>   ETrade's annual shareholder meeting is scheduled for today in
Redwood City, Calif.</TE>
<TE>   Associated Press and Bloomberg News</TE>
<TE>   Briefly</TE>
<TE>   Costa Mesa-based Emulex Corp. (EMLX) will move from Nasdaq to the
NYSE on June 24, where it will trade under the ticker symbol ELX ...
Irvine-based Interplay Entertainment Corp. (IPLY) said its stock will
move to the Nasdaq SmallCap Market on Tuesday from the bigger Nasdaq
National Market.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Irvine medical products maker Masimo Corp. said it has filed an
antitrust lawsuit against Tyco Health Care Group LP and its
Mallinckrodt Inc. unit, alleging that they engaged in
anti-competitive business practices.</LD>
<LD>   The suit, filed Wednesday in U.S. District Court, centers on sales
of pulse oximeters, which are used to measure oxygen levels of
critically ill patients.</LD>
<LD>   Masimo contends its device outperforms one made by Tyco's
Mallinckrodt Inc. unit, but says Tyco has offered rebates and paid
fees to big hospitals to prevent them from buying products made by
others.</LD>
<TE>   The suit alleges that hospitals that agreed to purchase at least
95% of their oximeter needs from Tyco received rebates equal to 5%
and 7%.</TE>
<TE>   But if the hospital ever failed to keep up that 95% figure, it was
required to repay all the rebates it had received.</TE>

<HD>For Coast, When It Rains, It's Poor</HD>
<DH>Pollution: Heal the Bay's annual Beach Report Card gives
high marks during dry weather, but storms bring out the worst in
toxic runoff.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SEEMA MEHTA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>On dry, sunny days, the vast majority of California's 1,100-mile
coast received top marks during the past year.</LD>
<LD>   However, according to a new study released Thursday, popular spots
such as Surfrider Beach in Malibu, Rincon Beach in Ventura County and
Doheny State Beach in Dana Point remain hotspots for illness-causing
bacteria.</LD>
<LD>   And on rainy days, as torrents of toxic urban runoff flow into the
ocean, swimmers should stay out of the water regardless of where they
live, according to Heal the Bay's 12th annual Beach Report Card.</LD>
<TE>   "Heal the Bay is giving Southern Californians the tools to make
educated decisions about the beaches they go to," said actress Amy
Smart, a member of the Santa Monica-based environmental group's board
of directors.</TE>
<TE>   Thursday's report marks the first time the organization has tried
to look at every coastal county between the Mexican border and the
Oregon state line.</TE>
<TE>   However, because of irregularities in reporting, the account
doesn't shed much light beyond Southern California. Monitoring and
reporting are spotty north of Santa Barbara County, with the
exception of Santa Cruz County, said Mark Gold, Heal the Bay's
executive director.</TE>
<TE>   The three northernmost coastal counties--Del Norte, Humboldt and
Mendocino--are not required by state law to regularly monitor
beaches. Marin County officials still have not put together a testing
program that was legally required to be in place three years ago. San
Francisco and San Mateo counties' data were inadequate or
unavailable, while Sonoma, Monterey and San Luis Obispo counties
don't test their water five months of the year.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the year's marks were positive--83% of 394 testing spots
received A's or Bs, and only 7% received Fs between April 2001 and
March 2002.</TE>
<TE>   "This year overall has been a very good year, because it's a dry
year," said Aliza A. Lifshitz, speaking for the environmental
organization at Cabrillo Beach in San Pedro. "But we still have some
work to do."</TE>
<TE>   Beaches affected by urban runoff that have poor circulation, such
as the Baby Beach in Dana Point and Cabrillo Beach in San Pedro,
tended to receive the lowest marks.</TE>
<TE>   "There's more circulation in your bathtub than at Cabrillo," Gold
said.</TE>
<TE>   The sites with the worst pollution included Surfrider Beach in
Malibu, Doheny State Beach in Dana Point, Arroyo Quemada in Santa
Barbara County and part of Mission Bay in San Diego.</TE>
<TE>   On rainy days, when runoff scours oil, pet waste, fertilizer and
other contaminants off streets and lawns and into the ocean, 40% of
the state's beaches received poor marks.</TE>
<TE>   Lifshitz, a Cedars-Sinai internist and author of the bilingual
guidebook "Healthy Mother, Healthy Baby," said swimming in that
pollution can cause gastrointestinal problems such as nausea and
diarrhea; respiratory infections; skin rashes; and viral diseases.</TE>
<TE>   "When that rain starts, [swimmers] need to wait at least three
days to go into the water," she said. "Otherwise, they will get
sick."</TE>
<TE>   Gold offered solutions to improve water quality, such as
installing filters in storm drains, sending more runoff to sewage
treatment plants and building wetlands that naturally cleanse runoff.</TE>
<TE>   The report praised Gov. Gray Davis for earmarking $34 million in
last year's budget for protecting the state's beaches, and voters for
supporting a $2.6-billion environmental bond earlier this year that
includes $375 million specifically designated for cleaning up the
ocean, rivers and streams.</TE>
<TE>   However, the group called on Northern California counties to more
rigorously test their water, and asked state water officials to
create complex pollution limits for several water bodies. Cities with
sheltered beaches, such as Kiddie Beach in Channel Islands Harbor and
Mother's Beach in Marina del Rey, were asked to develop measures to
improve tidal circulation.</TE>
<TE>   Heal the Bay also urged the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency
to create more stringent monitoring standards nationwide.
California's requirements are the most stringent in the United
States.</TE>
<TE>   The report was released the same day as environmental groups
across the nation called on EPA administrator Christie Whitman to
back rules requiring reporting of sewer spills and public
notification when sewage reaches the water.</TE>
<TE>   California law already requires such action. Beach closures caused
by sewage spills were largely confined to Los Angeles, Orange and San
Diego counties. Orange County once again had the most--its coastal
stretches were shut 51 times in the past year by raw human waste, the
report says.</TE>

<HD>O.C. Attacks Linked to Long Beach Rapist</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID HALDANE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Police said Thursday that they believe the man who attacked two women
in Los Alamitos this month is the "Belmont Shore rapist" suspected in
at least nine assaults in Long Beach and Orange County since 1997.</LD>
<LD>   "As long as this guy's loose, you'd have to say that every woman
is at risk," said Sgt. Jeff Travis, a Los Alamitos Police Department
spokesman.</LD>
<LD>   Evidence at the scenes of the Los Alamitos attacks linked them to
the earlier crimes, Travis said. He would not elaborate. "We're kind
of keeping it under wraps," he said. "If the suspect doesn't know
that he's leaving it, I don't want to tell him."</LD>
<TE>   The Los Alamitos attacks occurred May 11, when a man entered a
home at the Royal Oak Mobile Home Park on Oak Street about 1:20 a.m.
and raped a 71-year-old woman. An hour later, the same man is
believed to have assaulted a 68-year-old woman who lives nearby.</TE>
<TE>   Both women were treated at a hospital for minor injuries. Though
the intruder did not rape the second woman, police said, he stole her
beige 1987 Honda Accord, license number 2DWF746.</TE>
<TE>   The car theft was a departure from previous attacks and may
provide clues that lead to the man's arrest, said Officer David
Marander, a Long Beach police spokesman. That agency has been
investigating the string of rapes there and one in Huntington Beach
over the last five years. "Concealing a car is a major undertaking,"
Marander said. "Our officers are looking for it everywhere."</TE>
<TE>   Victims have described the rapist as white, with a medium build,
5-foot-7 to 5-foot-11 and 25 to 35 years old.</TE>

<HD>Council Committee Backs New School Board Map</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID PIERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A City Council panel voted Thursday to recommend a map of new school
board district boundaries that has drawn charges of disenfranchising
the San Fernando Valley.</LD>
<LD>   The map, approved 3 to 2 by the council's Ad Hoc Committee on
Redistricting, will be considered by the full council on Tuesday. The
Los Angeles Board of Education district boundaries, which are redrawn
every 10 years to reflect demographic shifts, must be approved by
July 1.</LD>
<LD>   The boundaries, originally drawn by an appointee of school board
President Caprice Young, were presented last month to the council
committee by the Los Angeles Redistricting Commission for the L.A.
Unified School District.</LD>
<TE>   The commission, made up of appointees of council members, school
board members and the mayor, voted 9 to 6 in March for the map,
favored by Young, amid accusations of behind-the-scenes politicking.</TE>
<TE>   The map calls for creation of a school board seat that would
combine southwest Valley communities such as Woodland Hills and
Encino with West L.A.</TE>
<TE>   The recommended map will fuel the secessionist movement, said
board member Julie Korenstein, who had championed a map that would
have put the Cahuenga Pass area--which includes North Hollywood and
Studio City--in a West L.A. seat and kept the southwest Valley in a
solely Valley district. The committee's recommended map would change
Korenstein's seat boundaries to include more of the East Valley and
none of the West Valley.</TE>
<TE>   Korenstein argued that the Cahuenga Pass area is more associated
with West L.A. because of freeway access.</TE>
<TE>   "If the City Council approves this map, it will be a major slap in
the face for the San Fernando Valley," Korenstein said.</TE>
<TE>   Councilmen Dennis Zine and Nick Pacheco voted against the map
preferred by Young. Council members Jan Perry and Eric Garcetti, as
well as committee Chairman Jack Weiss, voted for the Young map.</TE>
<TE>   Young and Korenstein favored separate plans that would have each
representing the West Valley. The region, which has a majority of
white voters, could make the difference in a reelection bid for the
two white board members.</TE>
<TE>   "This is what the public, [the Los Angeles Redistricting
Commission], said made the most sense," Young said of the map
recommended by the committee.</TE>
<TE>   The Valley has been the center of debate in the redistricting
process. With seven board members, Los Angeles' population dictates a
seat must contain 635,000 residents. The Valley, with 1.44 million
people, requires the equivalent representation of 2.2 board members,
meaning some Valley communities would have to share a district with
non-Valley areas.</TE>

<HD>Woman's Body Found in Desert</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>San Bernardino County detectives searching the desert near the town
of Yermo have found a body that may be a 26-year-old mother who has
been missing since May 15, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   Detectives looking for Kristina Garcia, a Raytheon employee and
mother of a 2-year-old girl, discovered the body Wednesday about 5
p.m. off Fort Irwin Road.</LD>
<LD>   "There's a possibility it's [Garcia], but we can't confirm that
it's her yet," said Cpl. Marie Spain of the San Bernardino County
sheriff's Barstow station.</LD>
<TE>   Coroner's officials have not identified the body and the cause of
death has not been determined, said Cindy Beavers, a spokeswoman for
the San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department.</TE>
<TE>   When Garcia did not show up for work, colleagues became concerned
and went to her Barstow apartment.</TE>
<TE>   Several employees found Garcia's daughter alone and the front door
unlocked, Beavers said.</TE>
<TE>   Her cellular phone was in the apartment and her car was outside,
she said. "Her friends said it was so unlike her to leave her cell
phone, let alone her baby," Beavers said.</TE>
<TE>   Garcia's estranged husband in Alabama has taken custody of the
toddler, she said.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday, detectives were searching a desert area near Yermo
Cutoff Road when they found "evidence of a struggle," Beavers said.
Detectives would not be more specific, she said.</TE>
<TE>   Officers using a search helicopter found the body, Beavers said.</TE>

<HD>4 Held in Shooting Death of Child, 3</HD>
<DH>Crime: A fifth suspect remains at large in case of Valley
boy killed when gang members intervened in a family argument, police
say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MANUEL GAMIZ JR. and ANDREW BLANKSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Four San Fernando Valley gang members suspected of fatally shooting a
3-year-old boy after instigating a fight with his uncle were arrested
in the child's slaying, police said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Three men and a 17-year-old boy were taken into custody after
police served arrest warrants at five apartment buildings in Lake
View Terrace, Van Nuys and Panorama City in connection with the May 9
killing of Alfredo Cardenas Jr.</LD>
<LD>   Booked on suspicion of murder were Juan Ayala, 18, Jose Jimenez,
20, Luis Rodriguez, 21, and a 17-year-old juvenile whose name was
withheld because of his age, said Los Angeles Police Department Det.
Al Aldaz.</LD>
<TE>   The three men, who are being held on $1-million bail each at the
Van Nuys jail, could be charged with the killing as early as today.
The minor's case will be handled in Juvenile Court.</TE>
<TE>   Police continued to search late Thursday for a fifth man,
identified as 20-year-old Jesus Delasancha, who authorities said is
believed to be hiding out in the Antelope Valley. All suspects are
believed to be Blythe Street gang members, police said.</TE>
<TE>   Recalling the events that led to his son's death, Alfredo Cardenas
Sr. broke down while staring at a picture of the boy posing with his
birthday cake.</TE>
<TE>   The arrests "will help a little," the father said, with tears
welling in his eyes. "But it won't bring back my son."</TE>
<TE>   The arrests culminated a two-week investigation that relied on the
boy's relatives to help identify the suspects, detectives said.</TE>
<TE>   "They knew the suspects and recognized them from the
neighborhood," Aldaz said. "But they were not intimidated and were
willing to put their lives at risk to make this case."</TE>
<TE>   Police and relatives said the shooting was preceded by an argument
between the boy's aunt and uncle, who were yelling at and shoving
each other in an open area in the 14700 block of Blythe Street in
Panorama City.</TE>
<TE>   Two men walked over to the couple and were joined by three other
men who allegedly objected to the way the boy's uncle was treating
the aunt.</TE>
<TE>   After an exchange of words, the suspects allegedly attacked the
uncle, pulled a gun and fired, hitting the little boy in the chest as
he walked nearby, Aldaz said.</TE>
<TE>   Since the shooting, many residents said they have started keeping
their children behind the locked iron gates of their apartment
complexes.</TE>
<TE>   "I've always been afraid that one of my children would get hurt
just by standing outside the apartment," said resident Maria Torres.
"I felt bad for the family. No parent should have to go through what
they went through."</TE>
<TE>   Torres said neighbors have been reluctant to report crimes out of
fear for their safety.</TE>
<TE>   About a month ago, she said, a group of gang members pulled a
knife on her husband and demanded money just outside their Blythe
Street apartment. The gang members stole his gold chain and
medallion, but she said neither she nor her husband reported the
incident to police.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to live here," she said. "We don't know if they would
have come back to get us. It's not worth your life over a chain."</TE>
<TE>   The shooting death of Alfredo Cardenas Jr. was a setback to the
area's attempts to improve its image over the last decade, said
Maritza Varela De Artan, director of Casa Esperanza, a community
social services organization.</TE>
<TE>   "It's very frustrating when something like this happens," Artan
said. "But we'll continue fighting to improve this neighborhood."</TE>

<HD>Westwood Cemetery Neighbors See Plot in Downsized Plan</HD>
<DH>Land use: They intend to appeal city approval, saying owner
still could revive larger expansion.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BOB POOL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Claiming that a Texas-based cemetery owner is trying to outfox them
over a proposed wall of crypts behind their backyards, homeowners
said Thursday that hey plan to protest city approval of the expansion
of Westwood Village Memorial Park.</LD>
<LD>   A Los Angeles city planner endorsed a scaled-down development plan
in findings released this week after Service Corp. International in
Houston quietly withdrew a request for permission to build a
1,488-crypt mausoleum directly behind homes on Wellworth Avenue.</LD>
<LD>   The revised plan would allow 463 new casket spaces in a mausoleum
about 80 feet from the homes, along with a private 12-casket
structure closer to neighbors' houses.</LD>
<TE>   By removing the larger mausoleum from the development proposal
before a city Planning Department hearing officer ruled on it, the
company can resurrect the plan later, angry neighbors charged.</TE>
<TE>   "It's sleazy. They saw right away that their application wasn't
going to go through, so they withdrew part of it so the whole project
wouldn't be turned down by the city," said homeowner Lili Young.
"They'll slide it in again in the future when we're not so vigilant."</TE>
<TE>   Young, an art therapist, said her neighbors plan to appeal hearing
officer Jon Foreman's ruling to the city's Planning Commission and,
if necessary, to the City Council.</TE>
<TE>   The cemetery at 1218 Glendon Ave., near Westwood's high-rise
corridor, has space for 1,126 caskets on nearly three acres. Opened
in 1888 as the Sunset Cemetery, it is nearly full.</TE>
<TE>   Because celebrities are interred on its grounds, the cemetery is a
Los Angeles landmark. It is the final resting place for such stars as
Marilyn Monroe, Natalie Wood, Jack Lemmon, Carroll O'Connor and Dean
Martin.</TE>
<TE>   Although its owners had initially sought to nearly triple its
capacity, a Service Corp. spokesman said the 475-casket expansion was
enough to "accommodate our needs for the foreseeable future."</TE>
<TE>   Opponents of the expansion charged that the last-minute
modification of the construction application was a way of keeping the
plan for crypts near homeowners' backyards alive.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a very cagey move by the developer. They knew full well
they wouldn't get approval now for the rear mausoleum," said Steve
Sann, a Westwood real estate consultant. "But they can come back 10
days from now or 10 years and try again."</TE>
<TE>   Neighbor Elliot Lewis, a real estate investor, said he views the
city ruling as "a small victory," but agreed that the Houston firm
"is thinking long-term."</TE>
<TE>   Company officials could not be reached Thursday for comment. Under
Foreman's ruling, the company must enclose the cemetery with an
8-foot masonry wall.</TE>
<TE>   Young said the residents' appeal will be based on city zoning laws
that require cemetery structures to be at least 300 feet from
neighboring residential property lines.</TE>
<TE>   She said the small mausoleum would be near the property line of a
pair of undeveloped residential lots on the east side of the
cemetery.</TE>

<HD>Panel OKs Civic Center Move to Pacheco District</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TINA DAUNT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A plan to move the Los Angeles Civic Center area into Councilman Nick
Pacheco's domain received a 3-2 vote Thursday from the City Council's
redistricting committee.</LD>
<LD>   The move sets up a bitter fight between Pacheco and Councilwoman
Jan Perry, who currently represents the city core, when the matter
goes to the full council for ratification early next month.</LD>
<LD>   Pacheco says he simply wants to unite areas of interest, such as
linking City Hall to the city's birthplace, Olvera Street, which is
in his district.</LD>
<TE>   But Perry has accused the councilman of a power grab and has vowed
to take her case to the council.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm just one woman fighting to keep my district together, because
that's what my constituents have asked me to do," said Perry, whose
9th Council District includes downtown and parts of South-Central.</TE>
<TE>   The showdown between Pacheco and Perry has been brewing for
months.</TE>
<TE>   Initially, Pacheco submitted a motion asking that much of Perry's
district, including Bunker Hill, be shifted to his 14th District and
to the 1st District, represented by Pacheco's ally Ed Reyes.</TE>
<TE>   The suggestion brought a flood of opposition from the downtown
business community, prompting Pacheco, who represents Eastside areas,
to revise his plans. He then suggested that Reyes get the new
Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels, while he would take the new Walt
Disney Concert Hall and other parts of downtown east of Hill Street.</TE>
<TE>   After fielding complaints from Cardinal Roger Mahony and patrons
of the Music Center, who pointed out that Disney Hall would be in a
separate council district from the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion, Pacheco
abandoned that idea.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, he presented yet another plan to the committee, this
one giving him a "finger" of downtown that would take in City Hall,
the Los Angeles Times building, the Clara Shortridge Foltz Criminal
Justice Center (formerly the Criminal Courts Building), the
California Department of Transportation building and other Civic
Center offices.</TE>
<TE>   "From my viewpoint, I respected a lot of comments I heard through
public testimony," Pacheco said. "The downtown business district
stays with Jan. The Music Center and Disney Hall are together.</TE>
<TE>   "When you look at the end result, I think I was pretty responsive
to the different viewpoints, but at the same time I feel like I've
done something that will make downtown better for everyone."</TE>
<TE>   He noted that he has agreed to give Perry a greater portion of
skid row and the Fashion District as a trade-off.</TE>
<TE>   Pacheco's critics, however, say his plan makes no sense.</TE>
<TE>   "It's divisive and destructive," said Carol Schatz, president of
the Central City Assn. "From our perspective, he doesn't get an inch
of the 9th District. There is no legal basis for him to take it."</TE>
<TE>   Councilman Jack Weiss, who chaired the redistricting committee,
echoed Schatz's concerns.</TE>
<TE>   "I felt that a sufficient case had not been made to justify
altering the lines," said Weiss, who joined Perry on Thursday in
voting against Pacheco's plan. Councilmen Dennis Zine and Eric
Garcetti sided with Pacheco in voting for it.</TE>
<TE>   The council is expected to take up the matter within the next two
weeks when it considers dozens of other proposed boundary changes,
including creating a fifth council district in the San Fernando
Valley.</TE>

<HD>1 Dead, 2 Gravely Injured in Crash</HD>
<DH>Traffic: SUV, said to be speeding, collides with minivan
carrying autistic students.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A head-on collision in Van Nuys of a sport utility vehicle and a
minivan filled with autistic students killed one person and left two
others near death on Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Police said the 11:20 a.m. crash in the 6800 block of Woodley
Avenue occurred when the driver of a Ford Explorer swerved to avoid
children in a crosswalk and veered into oncoming traffic.</LD>
<LD>   "The Explorer was driving erratically, weaving in and out of
traffic at about 65 to 70 mph judging from the skid marks," said Los
Angeles Police Department Det. Jose Viramontes.</LD>
<TE>   The woman driving the Explorer, with one adult passenger and a
toddler strapped into a car seat in the rear, apparently tried to
slow when she saw the children in the crosswalk, overcompensated in
turning the steering wheel and hit the oncoming van.</TE>
<TE>   She was critically injured and flown to County-USC Medical Center.
Three other adults in the two vehicles also received critical
injuries and were taken to other hospitals. One of the four died a
few hours later and two others were not expected to survive,
officials said. None of their names were released.</TE>
<TE>   The toddler and four students in the van were treated for less
severe injuries, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   The crash is under investigation.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>For 10 years, Los Angeles County's health system has managed to pull
off a remarkable high-wire act--teetering occasionally over a fiscal
abyss and drawing gasps from the audience, but always righting itself
in the end.</LD>
<LD>   The curtain has risen on the latest act, but it is unclear this
time whether the state and federal governments will be standing by
with a safety net.</LD>
<LD>   The county's new health director is working on a plan to close a
deficit of $688 million caused by dwindling federal aid. The initial
sketches raise the specter of hospital closures, thousands of layoffs
and service curtailment, all of which are unnerving to medical
professionals, county workers and patients.</LD>
<TE>   There is no guarantee that this crisis will be resolved with as
little disruption as the previous two. Both ended when Los Angeles
County supervisors secured billion-dollar bailouts from Washington.</TE>
<TE>   Still, any service cuts are months--possibly years--off, and the
supervisors, despite their tough talk, have always gone to
extraordinary lengths to keep from cutting their politically popular
health department.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, the decade-long ritual of crisis and rescue has diverted
the county from making sorely needed structural reforms in how it
delivers health care to the region's nearly 3 million uninsured.
After each rescue came vows to streamline the hospital-based system
into one geared toward cheaper, patient-friendly outpatient clinics.
Then reform stalled until a new deficit loomed and the county had to
scramble again to keep from closing hospitals.</TE>
<TE>   "The crisis atmosphere does distract from the ability to have the
sort of sustained conversation about reforms and efficiencies that
should take place," said Mark Baldassare of the Public Policy
Institute of California, who has studied the county's health crisis.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Thomas Garthwaite, the county's new health director, is
supposed to change that pattern. As medical director of Veterans
Affairs, he presided over the closure of hospitals and the
centralization of computer networks and medical procedures.</TE>
<TE>   Though arguing that the county needs more funding, Garthwaite also
says that it needs to change--and consolidate--its business practices
so that it can treat patients more quickly and cheaply.</TE>
<TE>   "Some of the redesign can be positive," he said. "Not to everyone
at the moment, but over time."</TE>
<TE>   County officials have always gone to greater lengths to find more
money for their health agency than to streamline its services. In the
early 1990s, they mortgaged their own headquarters, the Hall of
Administration, to avoid cuts. Then came the two separate
billion-dollar federal bailouts, in 1995 and 2000.</TE>
<TE>   There is cause for greater concern this time around. The rosy
financial outlook of the past five years is gone, replaced with a
need for austerity.</TE>
<TE>   The state is facing a $22-billion deficit, and Washington is
preoccupied with the war against terror, meaning there is less money
available for any rescue effort.</TE>
<TE>   The political will to help Los Angeles County apparently has
waned. The medical financing officials who inked the 2000 rescue plan
indicated then they would not bail out the county again. And the Bush
administration may not be as willing to help heavily Democratic Los
Angeles as was the Clinton administration, which authorized the two
prior bailouts, sometimes over the objections of health-care
bureaucrats.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the director of the federal Center for Medicaid and
Medicare Services, Thomas Scully, said through a spokesman Thursday
that he is willing to work with the county. "We very much want to try
to help out Los Angeles County and give them as much flexibility as
we can."</TE>
<TE>   On the plus side, the county is in better financial shape than it
was in the mid-'90s, when the health department nearly dragged the
county into bankruptcy. It has built up a $500-million reserve, which
could be used to stave off collapse for a year or two, and its credit
rating is higher, meaning it could issue public debt to fund the
health department far more easily than in the past.</TE>
<TE>   Both of those options, though, have been criticized as fiscally
reckless by the county's budget chief.</TE>
<TE>   Some are hopeful that the dire scenarios presented will lead to
some kind of solution, whether from inside or outside the system.</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody wants to close a hospital," said Bart Diener, assistant
general manager of the Service Employees International Union, Local
660, the union that represents most of the health department's 22,000
workers.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not like there are forces at work saying 'we want to close
these hospitals.' When it becomes clear that without some kind of
political action that becomes the result, we've been fortunate enough
to pull together some kind of funding mechanism."</TE>
<TE>   The alarms raised by the Hall of Administration not only serve to
prod other levels of government to intervene. They also help county
supervisors repel other agencies' requests for money.</TE>
<TE>   That was the case this week when Sheriff Lee Baca led hundreds of
deputies and community members into the Hall of Administration to
protest a proposed $50-million cut to his $1.6-billion budget. His
demands that supervisors consider him their "No. 1 priority" provoked
Supervisor Yvonne Brathwaite Burke, normally the most mild-mannered
of the five supervisors: "What you're saying to us is if it's
necessary to close a hospital to fund your department, then you feel
that hospital should be closed," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Baldassare argues that the county can't, by itself, solve its
financial problems. "What hasn't happened, and what you would hope
would happen after a number of crises is the federal and state and
local governments would get together and work out a long-term
structure," he said.</TE>

<LD>Chatsworth homeowners are cheering a judge's decision to block a
subdivision they say would threaten their neighborhood's horsy
character.</LD>
<LD>   Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Dzintra Janavs agreed Tuesday
with the horse-keeping plaintiffs that city planners and the City
Council erred when they changed zoning in the area to allow developer
Ted Stein's plan for 21 houses on 6.7 acres. Janavs also agreed that
the city had not sufficiently reviewed the environmental impact of
the project.</LD>
<LD>   The property at Chatsworth Street and Topanga Canyon Boulevard is
part of a horse-keeping area zoned for residential lots no smaller
than about a half-acre.</LD>
<TE>   Residents complained that Stein's project--on land bought from the
Archdiocese of Los Angeles--would encroach on their neighborhood's
culture by plopping million-dollar mansions on lots too small to
accommodate them. They accused city planners of bowing to the
developer because of his position as president of the Airport
Commission and his friendship with Councilman Hal Bernson, who
represents Chatsworth.</TE>
<TE>   Stein and his attorney could not be reached Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Beyond objecting to Stein's plan, residents worried that changing
zoning for the project would make it easier for other developers to
come into rustic Chatsworth, buy large parcels and divide them for
housing.</TE>
<TE>   Janavs' judgment could halt another project proposed for land
across the street from the parcel that Stein was seeking to develop,
residents said.</TE>
<TE>   "We welcome development. We just want it to fit with our
neighborhoods," said Susan Eskander, a member of the Chatsworth Land
Preservation Assn. who boards horses.</TE>
<TE>   Deputy City Atty. Basia Jankowski said the city has not decided
whether to appeal Janavs' ruling, which the judge will sign in the
coming weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Chatsworth homeowners plan to saddle up their horses on Sunday to
celebrate the victory.</TE>

<HD>10 Chinese Nabbed After Coming Ashore in O.C.</HD>
<DH>Search: Teens at a party see naked men emerge, dress, then
flee before police round them up.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JACK LEONARD, CHRISTINE HANLEY and LAURA LOH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Clinging to a Styrofoam raft and a handful of life jackets, 10
Chinese nationals paddled ashore in the predawn darkness to a trailer
park near Newport Beach, where they were spotted by teenagers at a
party and later caught by police.</LD>
<LD>   The men, naked and shivering, were spotted about 2 a.m. wading
onshore at El Morro Beach as a group of teenage girls celebrated an
elementary school reunion at a beachfront trailer.</LD>
<LD>   The teens saw the men hurriedly dress into clothes they were
carrying--designer jeans, sweatshirts, even sport coats and business
suits--then head for the nearest main road.</LD>
<TE>   Over the next four hours, police and federal immigration officers
spread out across Newport Beach and Laguna Beach. They caught all 10
men, ending what officials described as a clandestine 7,000-mile
odyssey from mainland China.</TE>
<TE>   "We just thought they were partying and skinny-dipping in the
ocean," said Bridgett Saeman, one of the teenagers who saw the men
arrive. "But they were opening up packages and bags of dry clothes
and putting new clothes on."</TE>
<TE>   Several of the men were found walking along Pacific Coast Highway,
while at least two made it all the way up to UC Irvine, five miles
away. Police said they scoured the waters for anyone who might have
drowned or become lost at sea but believe none of the group that swam
to shore was missing.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities said the men, in their 20s and 30s, traveled from
China by ship, switching vessels at least once in Taiwan before
getting off their last vessel somewhere close to the California
coast. About 4 p.m., U.S. Coast Guard officials were preparing to
board a fishing vessel they believe might have dropped off the men.</TE>
<TE>   Immigration officials said the men will at the very least face
deportation, as long as they were not involved in any other criminal
activity. As of Thursday afternoon, none of the men had sought
political asylum, said officials with the Immigration and
Naturalization Service.</TE>
<TE>   Katie Gottron, 19, was on the deck of a friend's beachfront
trailer when she noticed a group of naked men scramble to shore.
Thinking they were having fun, she called her friends, and they
decided to invite the men to their party.</TE>
<TE>   They noticed the men opening plastic bags filled with new clothes.
The girls tried speaking to them but were ignored. Bridgett Saeman
ran back to her trailer and told her father what they had seen.</TE>
<TE>   "She said to me, 'Dad, there's a bunch of naked Chinese men in
front of our house.' I said, 'Bridgett, c'mon! You've been keeping me
up all night already,'" said Terry Saeman, 47.</TE>
<TE>   Saeman put on a white bathrobe, grabbed a diving light and
ventured out. He saw the men sitting on one of his neighbor's decks,
some of them smoking cigarettes. As he drew closer, they fled,
heading for Pacific Coast Highway.</TE>
<TE>   Saeman called police. Then, he, his daughter and her friends
combed the beach, discovering a 4-by-4-foot Styrofoam float and a few
buoys. Some water bottles with Chinese labels lay empty.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, a sheriff's deputy saw the group along a main road and
detained one man as the rest scattered. Two more were caught nearby.</TE>
<TE>   Police warned businesses open at that hour to be on the lookout
for the men. Dozens of officers formed a five-mile dragnet, using
police dogs and helicopters to search roads and nearby scrubland.</TE>
<TE>   Five more men were caught hiding in brush near Crystal Cove State
Beach. The remaining two were picked up near the San Joaquin Hills
tollway and Bonita Canyon Drive. All were described as in good
physical condition.</TE>
<TE>   During questioning, the men said they spent a month traveling by
ship from China. They told police they had expected to meet a man
whose name sounded like "Otto." A police videotape of the interviews
shows that the men remained unemotional throughout. They asked only
for cigarettes--a request that was denied.</TE>
<TE>   Police said the group was probably dropped off close to the shore
because they could not have survived for long in the 60-degree water.
Authorities also said lifesaving equipment the men had used was
emblazoned with the name "Fu Ching," which means Lucky Star, possibly
the name of the ship the men were smuggled aboard.</TE>
<TE>   Coast Guard officials spotted a fishing vessel bearing the same
name about 100 miles off San Diego and prepared to board it.</TE>
<TE>   While thousands of Chinese immigrants are smuggled into the United
States each year, experts said the men's journey was far from
typical.</TE>
<TE>   Sea travel was the route of choice a decade ago, but recent
crackdowns by the U.S. Coast Guard and Chinese government on sea
smugglers has made the trip much more perilous, said Ko-Lin Chin,
professor of criminal justice at Rutgers University and author of
"Smuggled Chinese."</TE>
<TE>   Most illegal Chinese immigrants, he said, now pay as much as
$70,000 for flights into the country or take ships to other countries
before crossing the border by land, usually through Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   Recent high-profile cases of immigrants smuggled in by sea
involved travelers hidden in container ships during their journey
across the Pacific. Officials said this case is unusual because the
men were dropped off far from a major port and were expected to swim
to shore.</TE>
<TE>   "It's extremely rare," INS spokesman Francisco Arcaute said. "It's
happened on the East Coast, but not often on the West Coast."</TE>
<TE>   Experts estimate that at least 20,000 Chinese nationals try to
enter the United States illegally each year. Most, they said, leave
from Fujian province, north of Hong Kong, and come looking for a
better economic future.</TE>
<TE>   Though lucrative for smugglers, the travel can be dangerous,
especially by sea. Immigrants are often forced to travel in
ramshackle boats and are housed in squalid conditions.</TE>
<TE>   "It's modern-day slave ships that we're talking about," INS
spokesman Bill Strassberger said.</TE>
<TE>   Still, many make the trip, frequently without success. Last year,
23 stowaways were found hiding in the hold of a Chinese ship berthed
in the Port of Long Beach. The year before, 48 immigrants were found
in cargo containers in the ports of Long Beach and Los Angeles.</TE>

<HD>Bias Suit Had Roots in Spoiled Birthday Party</HD>
<DH>Courts: African American plaintiffs used e-mail to spread
the news about their experiences of being barred from Lola's
Restaurant.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA RICHARDSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The just-settled discrimination lawsuit by 24 African Americans
against one of West Hollywood's trendiest spots for an apple martini
sprouted almost by coincidence.</LD>
<LD>   Week by week, colleagues, neighbors and acquaintances learned by
word of mouth and over the Internet that they had had similar
experiences at Lola's Restaurant.</LD>
<LD>   E-mail claiming discrimination at Lola's and warning black people
not to frequent the restaurant flew from California to New York and
back again, wending its way from friend to friend until it landed
where it began--on Nedra Jenkins' computer.</LD>
<TE>   The lawsuit, which was settled Wednesday under confidential terms
that included a statement of regret by the restaurant, had its roots
in a Friday in November 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Jenkins, a senior deputy attorney for Los Angeles County, said
Lola's canceled the 30th birthday celebration she'd planned for 50
friends. Jenkins, who made arrangements over the telephone, believed
the restaurant scuttled the reservation after she stopped by and
employees realized that she is black. Lola's attorney, Dale B.
Goldfarb, said Jenkins never paid a deposit and had no formal promise
from the restaurant to accommodate her.</TE>
<TE>   Jenkins said she stewed over her humiliation that weekend, and on
Monday morning Jenkins decided to take action against the nightspot.</TE>
<TE>   "When it happened on my birthday, I was horrified. I had friends
in from out of town and I just did my best to get through the
weekend," she said Thursday at a Beverly Hills news conference in the
offices of the plaintiffs' attorney, Carl E. Douglas.</TE>
<TE>   First, Jenkins reported the incident to the state Department of
Alcoholic Beverage Control; her plan was to demand that Lola's liquor
license be revoked. Then a friend mentioned reading an e-mail citing
other African Americans who said they, too, had been arbitrarily
refused entry to Lola's. Jenkins found the e-mail, saw that it
included the names of two other people with complaints about Lola's
and contacted them. In one case she didn't have to go far--Kelli
Gillam lived in the same apartment building.</TE>
<TE>   "It was like nine degrees of separation," she said. "When I
realized that this was a pattern and a practice, that's when I
decided to file suit."</TE>
<TE>   Gillam, an accountant, became a plaintiff in the case, as did a
client of hers who had also been refused entry to Lola's the same day
as she was.</TE>
<TE>   Gillam, who was not at Thursday's news conference, had been
refused entry on the grounds that she needed a dinner reservation to
have a drink in the bar, Douglas said. When she saw the white friend
she was to meet waiting for her in the bar, she was permitted
inside--but only to explain to her friend that she could not remain
there, Douglas said. Minutes later, Gillam's client, Darren Lee,
arrived to drop off his taxes--and was also refused entrance, Lee
said.</TE>
<TE>   "The doorman looked at me and said: 'I can't let you in.'" Lee
said. "While I was standing there he let in four other white people.
I told him that I didn't even plan on staying, I just wanted to go in
and drop something off. He said, 'I can't let you in. Period.'"</TE>
<TE>   Jenkins and the other plaintiffs filed a lawsuit in March 2000,
claiming the restaurant had violated the state's civil rights law,
but a mistrial was declared in October 2001 after a 3 1/2-week trial.
Jurors, who deliberated for 12 days, failed to reach a verdict on 70
of the 72 allegations but ruled against Jenkins' case.</TE>
<TE>   Another trial was set for August but the restaurant's owner
decided it was cheaper to settle than go to trial again.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't believe there was ever discrimination at Lola's, and
everyone admitted there was always a completely mixed crowd at the
restaurant," Goldfarb said, adding that 17 of the 24 plaintiffs had
been to Lola's on previous occasions and had no problem entering.
"Settling was just a matter of saving money for us. We agreed to tell
them we regret any inconvenience, which we always do if anyone is
inconvenienced."</TE>
<TE>   A dozen plaintiffs filed the lawsuit; the resulting publicity drew
another dozen plaintiffs before the trial began.</TE>
<TE>   Among the new plaintiffs were Nequetta Thompson and Kathy Ward,
who work for Pacific Bell. They claimed they went with 17 co-workers
of various races to Lola's after work in September 1999, and were
refused entry because they did not have reservations--even though
their white, Latino and Asian colleagues were admitted. Goldfarb said
that if anyone was refused entrance, it was because the restaurant
was full or they were inappropriately dressed.</TE>

<HD>Valley's Seamy Side Has Its Say on Secession</HD>

<LD>Dear Valley Diary:</LD>
<LD>   Day Two</LD>
<LD>   On the historic day the breakup of Los Angeles made the ballot, a
pigtailed actress named Xiu Xiu was sold into bondage in Chatsworth.
Another day, another dollar in a multibillion-dollar industry that
could help determine whether a new Valley city can make it on its
own.</LD>
<TE>   "Can you keep it down?" a production manager asked. "We've got
dialogue in this scene."</TE>
<TE>   "There's dialogue in this movie?" quipped Scott Justice, executive
vice president of Sin City Entertainment. He referred to "Whoriental
Sex Academy 4" as a "one-day wonder," meaning he intended to shoot
the entire 90-minute film in about 12 hours.</TE>
<TE>   Such fare may be offensive to some. But Justice, a former
stockbroker, offers no apologies for making 72 adult movies a year in
the San Fernando Valley, the undisputed world capital of an industry
that employs thousands and pays a fortune in taxes.</TE>
<TE>   "The business is recession- proof," he said, unlike the stock
market, and unlike Boeing and many other Valley industries.</TE>
<TE>   Sept. 11 had no impact on adult entertainment, Justice added,
seated in an office at a rented studio on Canoga Avenue.</TE>
<TE>   As would happen many times throughout the day, our conversation
was interrupted by a crisis. This one involved a last-minute
replacement for a no-show actress.</TE>
<TE>   "She's not Asian, but she looks Asian," one of Justice's partners
told him.</TE>
<TE>   "Get her," Justice responded with urgency.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, back on the set, the action heats up in the Virgin
Paradise Room:</TE>
<TE>   Xiu Xiu: "What would you have me do first?"</TE>
<TE>   Aaron: "First I must inspect your flower."</TE>
<TE>   After an "inspection" that went on for a solid hour, Aaron put his
pants back on and spoke passionately about Valley secession.</TE>
<TE>   I chatted mainly with Aaron because Xiu Xiu, who recently moved
from the Valley to West Covina, was unaware of a secession movement,
or "succession," as most of the cast and crew referred to it.</TE>
<TE>   Also unaware were Ming Lo, Geisha Girl No. 1, and Nathan, who was
having trouble figuring out which Geisha he was supposed to be with
in the movie, let alone whether the San Fernando Valley should pull
out.</TE>
<TE>   "Secede from who?" asked Nathan.</TE>
<TE>   He is far more worked up about how Viagra has turned "every guy on
the street into a porn star," making jobs scarce for old-school
performers, such as he, who insist on honest artistic expression.</TE>
<TE>   But for fellow actor Aaron, who believes that Valley people are
friendlier and more community-minded than the rest of L.A., the
breakup couldn't happen soon enough.</TE>
<TE>   "The new city would be more manageable," he insisted, and more
attuned to the needs of Valley folk.</TE>
<TE>   My own feeling is that secession proponents have not offered a
scintilla of proof that services would improve--or that they wouldn't
be even worse--in a new city of roughly 1.35 million, with no true
center or collective interest. But Aaron, who lives near Warner
Center, reduced the issue to this:</TE>
<TE>   "Smaller is better."</TE>
<TE>   I cast about for Chad, the actor respectfully known in the
industry as Sledge Hammer, to ask his thoughts. He was unavailable.</TE>
<TE>   There was some concern among cast and crew that the creation of a
new city could be catastrophic for the adult entertainment industry.
What if incoming politicos include religious types? And what if they
see the Valley as a bedroom community of the conventional sort, and
call for a crackdown on porn?</TE>
<TE>   No way, said Sin City's Justice, who wore a silver cross at the
neck of his open shirt but insisted he was bar mitzvahed at 13 and
wears the pendant "as a piece of jewelry and not a religious symbol."</TE>
<TE>   The new city needs porn, he said, because of the taxes it
generates. Adult video sales last year totaled roughly $900 million,
wholesale. And then there are billions more from worldwide rentals,
pay-per-view and Internet sales. A piece of every dollar would stay
in the Valley if it seceded.</TE>
<TE>   But the porn industry contributes more than money. Bud Lee,
director of "Sex Academy 4," describes with pride how the industry is
a partner in the community, sponsoring local Little League teams, for
example.</TE>
<TE>   Banner-toting secessionists never mention porn when they're
selling Paradise, of course. But given the industry's sense of
corporate citizenship, you could make an argument for including a
G-string on the new city seal.</TE>
<TE>   It's not as if the porn industry owned sin unto itself, says Mark
Kernes, senior editor of Adult Video News. If the Valley wants to
crack down on immorality, he said, "they should have an ordinance
that says you can't have a school within a hundred yards of a
Catholic church."</TE>
<TE>   "Yeah," said Aaron, who was filling out an IRS form, reporting his
income for the day's workout with Xiu Xiu. "How often do you hear
about a porn star raping a 10-year-old boy?"</TE>
<TE>   In the latest crisis update, the actress who only looks Asian was
allegedly on her way to the studio. Meanwhile, Sledge Hammer was
headed for the Paradise Virgin Room with Geisha No. 1, who said she
thought the Valley was already its own city.</TE>
<TE>   Justice still insisted that "Sex Academy 4" would wrap in a day,
even if it took until midnight. By the way, he said, he's got a plan
to protect the porn industry should the Valley become a city.</TE>
<TE>   He, as a successful captain of industry, might just run for mayor.</TE>

<HD>Ex-Manson Follower Back in Courtroom</HD>
<DH>Hearing: Lawyer for Leslie Van Houten, convicted of two
1969 murders, claims parole board's ongoing refusal to free her is
unlawful.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENIFER WARREN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Former Charles Manson follower Leslie Van Houten, convicted of two
murders in a crime spree that shook Los Angeles 33 years ago,
appeared in court in San Bernardino Thursday to press her claim that
she is rehabilitated and should be paroled.</LD>
<LD>   Arguing in a courtroom packed with reporters and Van Houten's
family and friends, an attorney for the 52-year-old inmate said her
client is no longer a danger to society and is entitled to release
under the law.</LD>
<LD>   Lawyer Christie Webb said the state parole board is ignoring Van
Houten's performance in prison and unlawfully denying her freedom
based only on the gravity of her crime--"a fact she can never
change."</LD>
<TE>   Deputy Atty. Gen. Heather Bushman, however, said the board has
"vast discretion" in parole matters and has acted properly in
blocking Van Houten's release, most recently two years ago. The
board's finding cannot be "disturbed," Bushman said, "simply because
Miss Van Houten disagrees with the conclusion."</TE>
<TE>   Superior Court Judge Bob N. Krug made no ruling after the hourlong
hearing, saying he would issue a written decision, probably within 30
days.</TE>
<TE>   But the judge was clearly troubled by a parole hearing transcript
that he said suggested that Van Houten was offered no reasons for the
denial and no path toward eventual release.</TE>
<TE>   Krug said the transcript made the June 2000 hearing look like a
pro forma proceeding that followed a script, complete with language
identical to that used by the board to deny another inmate parole.</TE>
<TE>   "Based upon the record, I cannot find any indication where Miss
Van Houten has done anything wrong" in prison, Krug said. "She's done
all the self-help programs and education available. The board
commends her.... Her psychiatric reports say she's not dangerous.</TE>
<TE>   "If I were Miss Van Houten, I wouldn't have a clue what to do
before my next hearing" to improve the odds of winning parole, Krug
said.</TE>
<TE>   Given that, the judge said the question is whether the board
adequately considered the inmate's readiness for release under
guidelines set out in statute and recent case law.</TE>
<TE>   Van Houten made no comment in court and was taken back to the
California Institution for Women in Corona immediately after the
hearing. Shackled and dressed in an orange prison jumpsuit, her long
graying hair in a braid, she listened attentively and occasionally
passed her attorney notes.</TE>
<TE>   Outside the courthouse, her lawyer said Van Houten was hopeful and
appreciated that the judge "was very attentive to the issues."
Bushman called the judge "very thorough" and repeated the state's
belief that the parole board had met its legal standard in reviewing
the case.</TE>
<TE>   Also on hand Thursday were Van Houten's sister and parents. Her
father, Paul Van Houten, who came from Arizona to see his
daughter--19 at the time of the crime--in court, said he felt the
judge had "an open mind.</TE>
<TE>   "If a person serves their term and their behavior is good, they
should get a [parole] date," he said. "The problem is political.
Period."</TE>
<TE>   Relatives of Van Houten's victims--Leno and Rosemary
LaBianca--were not at the hearing. But Debra Tate, sister of Sharon
Tate, the pregnant actress killed by other Manson followers, spoke to
reporters.</TE>
<TE>   "If they start letting out killers like this, we're all in
trouble," said Tate, whose late mother, Doris, launched a crime
victims' group after the murders. "This wasn't some crime of passion,
someone who flew off the handle. This was someone who knew what was
going to happen and committed murders of the most heinous kind."</TE>
<TE>   Van Houten was convicted of stabbing the LaBiancas on Aug. 10,
1969, at their Los Feliz home. The night before, other members of the
Manson "family" killed Tate and four friends in a gruesome rampage in
Benedict Canyon.</TE>
<TE>   The murders drew national attention and made Manson, a lifelong
con who masterminded the killings, into a notorious criminal.</TE>
<TE>   A former homecoming princess from Monrovia, Van Houten has long
been viewed as the least culpable of the group. In 1982, her
supporters presented the parole board with 900 signatures urging her
release. But parole was rejected that year and the 12 other times her
case has been reviewed.</TE>
<TE>   Another Manson follower, Susan Atkins, convicted of killing Tate
and seven others, has filed a similar petition in court.</TE>
<TE>   Atkins, 53, dubbed "Sexy Sadie" by Manson, has asked a Los Angeles
judge to free her or order a new parole hearing, claiming she is a
"political prisoner" of the board.</TE>

<HD>Businesses Urged to Give Mexico Aid</HD>
<DH>Immigration: A top aide to Fox encourages a group in
Cypress to help slow the flow of migrants by creating jobs south of
the border.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENNIFER MENA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A top deputy to Mexican President Vicente Fox on Thursday asked
Orange County business leaders to help fund a binational program
designed to stave off emigration to the United States.</LD>
<LD>   Juan Hernandez, coordinator of the Presidential Office for
Mexicans Abroad, encouraged a group of 50 businesspeople at a Cypress
meeting to help fund infrastructure projects in Mexico's poorest
regions.</LD>
<LD>   Hernandez said many Mexicans come to the United States because
they can't make a living in their native land. There are about 23
million Mexicans and Mexican-Americans in the United States,
including 4 million who are in the country illegally, he said.</LD>
<TE>   Programs that promote jobs, health and education in his homeland
could help stop the emigration, Hernandez said.</TE>
<TE>   While migrants send an estimated $8.5 billion annually to their
families in Mexico, the Fox administration has made efforts to
promote initiatives that would encourage some to stay home.</TE>
<TE>   Fox and President Bush developed the Partnership for Prosperity
project in March with the idea of creating greater economic stability
in Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   Hernandez's office has identified 1,030 projects to be funded,
including hospitals, roads and sports facilities in poor regions.</TE>
<TE>   Greg Watkins of Newport Beach-based Watkins/Associates told
Hernandez he is interested in assisting.</TE>
<TE>   Watkins also hopes he can cut a deal with Mexico that would enable
him to complete a $6-billion port project in Colima state.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not shy to ask you for money," Hernandez told Watkins and the
others. But more importantly, he said, "I'm interested in getting you
involved. I want you to come down and I want you to see these
communities."</TE>
<TE>   Hernandez spends as many as three days a week in the United States
promoting the effort. Since beginning the partnership three months
ago, he said he has received pledges totaling $70 million from donors
that include individuals and major U.S. corporations.</TE>

<HD>MTA OKs Budget to Expand Rail and Avoid Fare Increase</HD>
<DH>Transit: Plan, the first by the new CEO, relies on cutting
workers' comp costs and decentralizing bus service. Spending would
decrease 5%.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KURT STREETER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Metropolitan Transportation Authority passed a budget Thursday
that will expand rail service while cutting the agency's overall
costs, without raising fares.</LD>
<LD>   The $2.6-billion budget, about 5% smaller than last year's,
represents efforts made by new MTA Chief Executive Roger Snoble to
rein in spending and make the agency more responsive to transit
riders.</LD>
<LD>   The first budget introduced by Snoble, who arrived from Dallas
seven months ago, bets heavily on the agency saving tens of millions
of dollars by slashing workers' compensation costs and creating a
decentralized, streamlined bus service. The outcome of those
initiatives is unclear. Nevertheless, the prevailing mood at the
agency's board meeting, where the panel voted 11 to 0 for the budget
proposal, was highly optimistic.</LD>
<TE>   "We are on our way to creating an agency that takes its customers
seriously, and our budget reflects that," Snoble said in an interview
before the vote.</TE>
<TE>   In the fiscal year beginning July 1, the budget proposes to:</TE>
<TE>   * Increase rail service about 5%, to 573,000 hours of operation.
About 20% of the budget is spent on rail.</TE>
<TE>   * Spend about $136 million next year on construction or
engineering of key construction projects such as a light-rail line
serving the Eastside.</TE>
<TE>   * Keep fares steady, with the standard one-way trip costing $1.35.
This is significant, because there had been recent talk within the
agency of increasing fares for the first time since 1995.</TE>
<TE>   * Essentially maintain the same overall level of bus service,
slightly increasing total hours of operation to 74.5 million. The
agency is spending nearly half of its budget on buses.</TE>
<TE>   The only opposition to the budget at Thursday's meeting came from
the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees,
representing supervisors at the agency. Members said the agency was
unfairly cutting costs on the backs of workers.</TE>
<TE>   Proposal Pleases Board Members</TE>
<TE>   Board members were pleased with the budget, however.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm getting more and more encouraged by what I'm seeing," said
MTA board member and Los Angeles City Councilman Hal Bernson.
"There's a lot of innovation."</TE>
<TE>   Along with the innovation comes risk.</TE>
<TE>   One assumption of the budget, which projects spending over five
years, is that such items as labor costs will be reduced as the
agency splits its bus service into five separate sectors and mandates
that general managers in those areas cut waste. Snoble's budget is
hazy, however, on the financial savings to come from the sector plan,
and some on the MTA board worry that the sectors could add to
bureaucracy and end up boosting costs.</TE>
<TE>   The budget also relies on significant success in the agency's new
effort to fight workers' compensation fraud, a program that Snoble
hopes will lead to about a 14% reduction from the $58 million spent
on workers' comp last year.</TE>
<TE>   The MTA is in the envious position for a governmental agency of
having more than half its budget guaranteed by a combination of sales
tax and revenue from riders. But the agency relies on state and
federal money to help fund its hoped-for construction of rail lines
and dedicated busways. For those projects, the new budget forecasts
receiving nearly $1.4 billion over the next five years from state and
federal sources, all money contingent upon promises made but not yet
finalized by politicians in control of the purse strings.</TE>
<TE>   MTA officials acknowledge that there are no guarantees.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a big concern for us," said MTA spokesman Marc Littman. "We
definitely are reliant on those funds to end up doing the kinds of
things we want to do."</TE>

<HD>Acts of Vandalism on Studio Parking Lots Seem to Follow a
Familiar Script</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Who will star in the movie version? The police log of the L.A.
Independent said that an unidentified employee at Sony Studios in
Culver City called a service from his office "to wash and wax his
silver 2002 Volvo. The victim paid the service in the evening and
went to pick up his car, but it wasn't where the service said it
would be.</LD>
<LD>   "After searching, he found it with a 24-inch scratch on the
driver's side door and coffee poured over the hood and bumper. The
victim thinks the service parked it in another employee's space." The
victim said this other employee "is very competitive and has been
known for this type of behavior."</LD>
<LD>   On a studio lot? Shocking.</LD>
<TE>   Off-street parking can be such sweet sorrow: Now for a
between-the-lines flashback. Several years ago, an actress found
nasty words scrawled on her car on a studio lot, as well as a photo
of what appeared to be a large man's naked posterior, after she
inadvertently parked in the spot of an actor.</TE>
<TE>   Commuter tie-ups: One thing KNX traffic reporter Jim Thornton
doesn't need for Father's Day is a tie, especially one with a traffic
theme. He already has 36, including one that says "Uniroyal" and is
made of rubber.</TE>
<TE>   The garish things, which appear on the KNX1070.com Web site, were
sent in by listeners. One tie that caught my eye depicts one of the
hazards of parking on public streets (see photo). Of course, you need
merely feed this hazard a few coins to satisfy it. It will never
attack your car like one of those angry humans on a studio lot.</TE>
<TE>   Escape from L.A.: While visiting his brother in Australia, Rodney
Hexter of Mission Viejo spotted a product that should please the
be-kind-to-insects crowd (see photo). It's typical, he quipped, "of
the Down Under sympathy we Australians are famous for."</TE>
<TE>   Conflicting signals to visitors: The Dana Point News' police log
said "a transient man with a pit bull was reported to be directly
behind the large rock that says, 'Welcome to Monarch Beach.'"</TE>
<TE>   Over-the-hill film festival: In honor of the announcement that the
Valley secession question will be on the November ballot, I think
it's time to reprise some of the historic references to that region
in the movies.</TE>
<TE>   * "Where's Toluca Lake?"--Hit man in "Pulp Fiction."</TE>
<TE>   * "Not that boy from Reseda?"--Anguished parent asking his
daughter about her date in "The Karate Kid."</TE>
<TE>   * "I don't know if this is going to work out. After all, you're
from outer space and I am from the Valley"--Young woman to invader in
"Earth Girls Are Easy."</TE>
<TE>   * "You do know me from Pauly's Pizza in Studio City"--Kidnapper to
victim in "2 Days in the Valley."</TE>
<TE>   * "Jules, we're in the Valley. No one is going to recognize
you"--Comforting words to crooked financier in "An Inconvenient
Woman."</TE>
<TE>   * "If you had brain one in that huge melon on top of your neck,
you'd be living the sweet life out in Southern California's San
Fernando Valley"--Exterminator to demon in "Ghostbusters II."</TE>
<TE>   * "Just north of Hollywood in a town called San Fernando, there
have been reports of saucers flying so low the exhaust knocked people
to the ground"--A soldier in "Plan 9 from Outer Space." The saucers,
as I recall, were just looking for parking places.</TE>
<TE>   * And, finally: There's the new name that the submerged San
Fernando Valley acquires after a magnitude 9 quake strikes Southern
California in "Escape from L.A.": the "San Fernando Sea." A different
kind of secession.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   miscelLAny: "Some of us really miss the rain," writes Bonnie
Sloane, "including the driver of the truck that passed me on the 405
with the license plate LVLNINO." She adds: "The truck is owned by a
roofing company."</TE>

<HD>Apartment Warning Gives Muslims New Worry</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Dana Parsons</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I try to imagine being of Middle Eastern descent and renting an
apartment these days.</LD>
<LD>   Uh, no thanks. And it has nothing to do with first- and
last-month's rent.</LD>
<LD>   It was tough enough after the terrorist attacks in September.
Newspapers across the country ran stories about outbreaks of violence
against people who appeared to be of Middle Eastern ethnicity. In
Orange County last year, 69 hate incidents were reported against
people perceived to be Muslim or of Middle Eastern descent--and
almost all occurred within a month of the Sept. 11 attacks. It was
the most in any year against any single group in the 11 years the
county has kept such records.</LD>
<TE>   Such incidents have diminished in recent months. Now, however,
comes an FBI warning that Islamic fundamentalist terrorist cells may
be planning to rent apartments for the sole purpose of planting
explosives to bring down the buildings.</TE>
<TE>   Like it or not, that likely will put Middle Easterners under a
microscope.</TE>
<TE>   Once again, life may get more complicated for my friend Ra'id
Faraj, a Palestinian who moved to Orange County early in 1995 and
eventually graduated from Santa Ana College.</TE>
<TE>   Now 34, Faraj is the spokesman for the Anaheim-based Council on
American-Islamic Relations. We hadn't talked since last summer, and I
assumed the latest FBI warnings would mean his life just got tougher.</TE>
<TE>   True, he says.</TE>
<TE>   He understands the need for vigilance but fears that could lead to
the targeting of innocent people and, in the worst of circumstances,
a resurgence of anti-Muslim or anti-Arab activities.</TE>
<TE>   "The media has played over and over that it's only a matter of
time before the next terrorist attack occurs," Faraj says. Those
reports featured various apartment managers across the country who
were interviewed, Faraj says, with the message being "to stay
vigilant, to be on the lookout."</TE>
<TE>   "All of us need to be vigilant and on the lookout for suspicious
behavior, but not the look of someone or his or her [ethnic or
religious] background."</TE>
<TE>   He knows that's easier said than done.</TE>
<TE>   That's why he and millions of other people of Middle Eastern
heritage in America experienced the double whammy from Sept. 11. In
addition to absorbing the psychic horror of the attacks, they felt
the lingering hostility from fellow countrymen after the terrorists
were identified as being Middle Eastern.</TE>
<TE>   "The individuals who did the crime of 9/11 did a tremendous
disservice to the rest of the community," Faraj says. "No doubt. No
doubt. After all, the majority of Muslims in America are law-abiding
citizens, well-educated, well-established, good families, good track
record. It's out there."</TE>
<TE>   It is that same community, Faraj says, that may be among the
government's best allies in thwarting future attacks. "If [the Sept.
11 terrorists] used the Arab American and Muslim community to hide
within it, who would be best to help the authorities and the
government prevent such acts in the future? But if they feel like
they're cornered or viewed as constantly being under suspicion or
that they don't belong here or they're outsiders, or a Fifth Column,
how would they feel?"</TE>
<TE>   I made several random calls to apartment managers in Orange
County. None said the publicized FBI warnings would give them second
thoughts about renting to people of Middle Eastern descent. I'll take
them at their word, and Faraj says, as a general rule, he doesn't
think people from the Middle East have been shunned by landlords.</TE>
<TE>   However, the FBI warnings are only a few days old and it's
uncertain how things will play out.</TE>
<TE>   But as I've found him before, Faraj is upbeat. He's confident
Americans as a whole won't treat Arab Americans unfairly.</TE>
<TE>   He also says that the tragedy of Sept. 11 produced some positive
things in the Muslim community in America.</TE>
<TE>   "They got more involved," he says, "to disassociate themselves
from those who committed the crime and to be proactive about what
they stand for and what they don't stand for."</TE>

<HD>Businessman Guilty of Interfering With Plane's Flight Crew</HD>
<DH>Courts: Exporter aboard LAX-bound jet flew into a rage over
not being allowed to change seat. Defense claims incident was
overblown in 9/11 aftermath.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID ROSENZWEIG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A businessman who caused a disturbance aboard a flight from South
Korea to Los Angeles last Nov. 21 was convicted by a federal jury
Thursday of interfering with the flight crew.</LD>
<LD>   Young Kun Kim, 64, of El Cajon became irate when he was seated
near a lavatory aboard the Asiana Airlines flight and demanded to be
relocated to the business or first-class sections, said Assistant
U.S. Atty. John B. Owens.</LD>
<LD>   When told he would not be moved, Kim cursed at flight attendants,
demanded entry to the cockpit and gestured with his hands to simulate
an explosion, Owens said.</LD>
<TE>   Flight attendants summoned the captain, who tried to pacify Kim.
When he continued screaming and cursing, Owens said, Kim was
handcuffed and moved to the back of the plane away from other
passengers.</TE>
<TE>   Kim, an exporter of dental supplies, was turned over to the FBI
when the plane landed at Los Angeles International Airport nine hours
later.</TE>
<TE>   Kim faces a statutory maximum penalty of 20 years in prison. Under
federal sentencing guidelines, he can realistically expect a much
shorter sentence.</TE>
<TE>   Similar cases prosecuted in Los Angeles federal court during the
past six months have resulted in sentences ranging from one to five
years behind bars.</TE>
<TE>   After his arrest, Kim told agents that he had two Bloody Marys
before boarding the plane in Inchon.</TE>
<TE>   Testifying in his own defense during the three-day trial, Kim
denied making threats. He said he would have been satisfied with any
seat away from the lavatory.</TE>
<TE>   Kim also said he could not understand everything the flight
attendants told him because he has a hearing problem.</TE>
<TE>   Owens told the jury that Kim's alleged hearing deficit was no
excuse. He said the passengers and crew were terrified by Kim's
behavior.</TE>
<TE>   Kim's attorney, Walter Urban, conceded that his client might have
been obnoxious, but he contended that the flight crew overreacted
because of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. District Judge Margaret M. Morrow set sentencing for Sept. 9.
Kim remains free on bail.</TE>

<HD>Gunmen Rob Jewelry Store in Camarillo, Beat Owner</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>HOLLY J. WOLCOTT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Four gunmen burst into a Camarillo jewelry store Thursday and
pistol-whipped one of the owners before stealing diamond rings, gold
watches and other merchandise valued at more than $100,000.</LD>
<LD>   The takeover-style robbery was reported about 2 p.m. at Camarillo
Jewelers in the 300 block of Arneill Road in the sprawling Ponderosa
Center, located just off the Ventura Freeway.</LD>
<LD>   "After they came in, they used obscene language and made death
threats," said Ventura County Sheriff's Sgt. Harold Hanley.</LD>
<TE>   Nazar Arakelian, who has owned the business with his wife for more
than 20 years, was forced by two of the robbers into the store's
rear, where he was struck at least twice across the face with a gun.</TE>
<TE>   Up front in the showroom, Arakelian's wife Alice was forced to lie
on the floor and told not to scream as the robbers scooped jewelry
from several unlocked display cases into a bag.</TE>
<TE>   After the gunmen fled, possibly in a red compact car, Alice
Arakelian ran to a neighboring business and asked employees to call
911, Hanley said.</TE>
<TE>   A few months ago, an independent jewelry salesman who was visiting
Camarillo Jewelers was robbed in the store's parking lot by a group
of men. Hanley said detectives at the scene of Thursday's holdup were
investigating possible ties between the four gunmen who robbed the
jewelry store and other area holdups.</TE>
<TE>   Nazar Arakelian, 63, was treated for facial injuries at Pleasant
Valley Hospital and released, officials said. His wife, 57, was given
oxygen at the scene after suffering shortness of breath.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities did not have a complete description of the robbers.</TE>

<LD>A Coast Guard captain who commented to the press about a government
security report has been reassigned to other duties pending an
investigation of security concerns in the ports of Long Beach and Los
Angeles, officials said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   John Holmes, the highest-ranking Coast Guard official at the
ports, was reassigned to the Marine Safety Staff office in San Pedro
last week, said Coast Guard spokesman Jeff Carter.</LD>
<LD>   Executive Officer George Cummings will take over Holmes' duties
until the investigation is completed.</LD>
<TE>   As captain of the port, Holmes enforced Coast Guard regulations
regarding marine environmental protection, search and rescue
operations, and port safety and security. He directed all security
operations at the ports, both on land and on vessels.</TE>
<TE>   On May 14, Fox News aired a report that said 25 Islamic extremists
had entered the United States as stowaways in cargo ships through
ports in Miami, Savannah, Ga., and Long Beach. The information came
from a security report read to Fox by unnamed sources in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   In an online article in the Journal of Commerce, Holmes was quoted
as saying that the Coast Guard was taking the report "very
seriously." He told the trade publication that evidence at the time
did not warrant extraordinary security precautions known as Level 2
and Level 3 alerts.</TE>
<TE>   Carter would not discuss why Holmes has been reassigned or what
security concerns have been raised under Holmes' watch, but said
Coast Guard officials are never allowed to discuss the contents of
classified government reports.</TE>
<TE>   "It doesn't matter who else has commented on it; if it's still
classified, we can't discuss it," Carter said. Carter would not
comment on Holmes' comments to the Journal of Commerce.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't speculate on the reasons for the reassignment," Carter
said. "It's under investigation, and that's all we can say."</TE>
<TE>   Representatives of several unions and maritime officials described
Holmes as a popular figure at the ports, known for being responsive
to their concerns, and said that he meets regularly with the
longshoremen.</TE>
<TE>   "John Holmes is one of the finest captains of the port we've ever
seen," said Manny Aschemeyer, executive director for the Marine
Exchange and Vessel Traffic Center in the harbor area. "We're all
worried about this and hoping he will be reinstated."</TE>
<TE>   Stefan Mueller-Dombois, a union representative for tug and barge
workers in the harbor area, has been working with Holmes on a tugboat
safety study. Mueller-Dombois hopes Cummings will be able to take
over where Holmes left off.</TE>
<TE>   "It's just that John Holmes is definitely a man of action,"
Mueller-Dombois said. "If there was a problem, he was going to fix
it. It's a pretty complicated issue, so I hope they can pick up the
pieces."</TE>
<TE>   Holmes is credited for helping to create the harbor area's port
security plan after Sept. 11.</TE>

<HD>Garage Owner Sees the Light</HD>
<DH>Energy: After the state power crisis dented his profits,
the Ventura businessman installed solar system and saw his electric
bill plummet.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>AMANDA COVARRUBIAS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An auto shop in Ventura that harnesses the sun's power to create
electricity may be on the cutting edge of energy technology, but what
really impresses owner Lee Lizarraga are his shrinking utility bills.</LD>
<LD>   At his one-story repair shop on Market Street, every electric
device-- from the overhead lights in the front office to the
hydraulic lifts--is capable of being powered by the 120
solar-collecting modules resting on the roof.</LD>
<LD>   ABC Auto Care is one of about 50 businesses in the state that
operate on solar power and probably the only auto repair shop on the
list, said Sandy Miller, a spokesman for the California Energy
Commission's renewable energy program.</LD>
<TE>   The panels were installed at Lizarraga's 8,000-square-foot shop in
September after longtime customer Michael Cordell, who sells solar
energy systems, convinced his mechanic that they could translate into
big savings over the long haul.</TE>
<TE>   It helped that the initial conversations took place in the heat of
the state's energy crisis and its rolling blackouts last year that
sent small-business owners scrambling to rent or buy generators to
keep their operations viable.</TE>
<TE>   "That was the initial seed that made me think about it seriously,"
said Lizarraga, who added that he lost half a day's business during a
blackout while waiting for an electrician to hook up a rented
generator.</TE>
<TE>   He said he first balked at the idea when he learned it would cost
$105,000 for a system. But with government-sponsored financial
incentives designed to encourage businesses to cut their energy use,
he figured the entire project would be paid off in three years.</TE>
<TE>   In the end, 44% of the initial investment was paid through
subsidies, rebates and tax write-offs and another 32% was covered by
a low-interest loan sponsored by the California Energy Commission,
Lizarraga said. His former $600 monthly electric bill has been
reduced by as much as 90%.</TE>
<TE>   He said his shop has cut its dependence on California's electric
power grid, which serves three-fourths of the state, and on some days
the flat, metallic-colored modules capture so much energy that he
does not have to tap into the grid at all. Six months after the
system was installed, the shop experienced its first day of operating
exclusively on solar power, Lizarraga said. That was March 12. The
system works like this: The panels collect sunlight, which is
transferred to an electronic component in the building that converts
solar energy to usable electric power. The power generated by the
system supplies the building's electrical energy and any left over
flows back to the state grid, earning Lizarraga a credit on his
utility bill.</TE>
<TE>   Lizarraga estimates that the system will generate about 200
kilowatts more this month than the building will consume--but some
months he has come up short and has had to use power off the grid.
The shop uses about 2,300 kilowatts a month, he said, and if all goes
well, the amount of electricity generated versus the amount used will
balance out by next year. To a customer walking into the one-story
repair shop, the solar electricity system is undetectable. Everything
appears normal as mechanics poke their heads under hoods, and the
flat panels sitting atop the building at a slight angle are not
visible from the ground. The system has not affected customer
service, Lizarraga said.</TE>
<TE>   Other small-business owners in California are not racing to switch
to alternative energy--or even to lower their electricity
consumption, said Rich Illingworth, vice president of Safe Bidco, a
nonprofit corporation created by the state to help commercial users
reduce their energy use through low-interest loans.</TE>
<TE>   Lizarraga received a five-year loan with a 4% interest rate, but
terms vary depending on the job, Illingworth said. The money also can
be used to replace old boilers, refrigeration systems and other
out-of-date equipment with energy-efficient models. Only about 30
businesses a year have applied for the loans since the program was
started in the late 1980s, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The most popular improvement is replacing old light fixtures,
Illingworth said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's cheaper and requires the least amount of faith in believing
these energy efficiency improvements will work," Illingworth said.</TE>
<TE>   Although many business owners inquired about generating their own
electricity during the energy crisis, few actually stepped up to the
plate, Illingworth said. Miller of the state Energy Commission said
homeowners have been more receptive to the idea of solar electricity.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the hesitancy of small businesses, Cordell said his
company, Solar Electrical Systems in Westlake Village, has installed
panels at hundreds of places, including Huntington Library and
Gardens in San Marino, "Titanic" director James Cameron's Hollister
Ranch home in Santa Barbara and Fire Station No. 6 in Oxnard.</TE>
<TE>   Lizarraga, who monitors his electricity output and consumption in
real time on his office computer, said he is looking to install solar
panels on the remaining uncovered portion of his rooftop.</TE>
<TE>   "Why not make this place as efficient as possible?" he said.</TE>

<HD>Inmate May Not Ship Wife Semen</HD>
<DH>Courts: Sharply divided federal appeals panel overturns
ruling that right to procreate even from prison is protected by the
Constitution.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HENRY WEINSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>California inmates have no constitutional right to impregnate their
wives by mailing sperm from prison, a sharply divided federal appeals
court in San Francisco ruled Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   The 6-5 ruling by the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals, in the
case of an inmate serving a 111-year sentence, overturns a previous
2-1 decision by a 9th Circuit panel that described procreation as a
fundamental right, even for prisoners.</LD>
<LD>   That ruling, the first of its kind by any appellate court, spurred
controversy and last December a majority of the 9th Circuit's 25
active judges voted to vacate the decision and rehear the case.</LD>
<TE>   "A holding that the state of California must accommodate [William]
Gerber's request to artificially inseminate his wife as a matter of
constitutional right would be a radical and unprecedented
interpretation of the Constitution," Judge Barry G. Silverman wrote
for the majority Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   The ruling is binding in eight other Western states that the 9th
Circuit covers.</TE>
<TE>   The case commenced in 1999, when Gerber sued the state Department
of Corrections after officials refused to allow him to send--at his
own expense--a semen specimen to a Chicago medical center that could
then use it to impregnate his wife, now 47.</TE>
<TE>   Gerber, now 42, is serving what amounts to a life sentence at Mule
Creek State Prison for negligently discharging a firearm, making
terrorist threats and possessing a handgun as an ex-felon.</TE>
<TE>   Judge Silverman, who was the dissenter in the earlier 9th Circuit
decision, cited several federal court decisions Thursday that say
prisoners lose certain rights that they would have in the outside
world.</TE>
<TE>   "While the basic right to marry survives imprisonment ... most of
the attributes of marriage--cohabitation, physical intimacy and
bearing and raising children--do not," wrote Silverman, an appointee
of President Clinton.</TE>
<TE>   Silverman emphasized that the majority's view was shaped by a U.S.
Supreme Court ruling that held that "'confining criminal offenders in
a facility where they are isolated from the society' serves to deter
crime and protect the public."</TE>
<TE>   Silverman acknowledged that some California inmates--those not
sentenced to death or serving life terms--are permitted conjugal
visits. He said, however, that "is simply irrelevant to whether there
is a constitutional right to conjugal visits or a right to procreate
while in prison."</TE>
<TE>   Silverman's opinion was joined by fellow Clinton appointees Ronald
M. Gould and Johnnie B. Rawlinson, Mary M. Schroeder, a Jimmy Carter
appointee; Diarmuid F. O'Scannlain, a Ronald Reagan appointee; and
Pamela A. Rymer, a George H.W. Bush appointee.</TE>
<TE>   The lead dissent, written by Judge A. Wallace Tashima, said,
"There is absolutely nothing in the record indicating that
procreation [by itself]--the right to have a child--is fundamentally
inconsistent with the fact of incarceration."</TE>
<TE>   Tashima, a Clinton appointee, acknowledged that permitting inmates
the privacy needed to procreate in prison can pose security concerns.</TE>
<TE>   He emphasized, however, "procreation through artificial
insemination ... implicates none of the restrictions on privacy and
association that are necessary attributes of incarceration."</TE>
<TE>   Tashima noted that the Mule Creek prison warden had "conceded that
he could not prevent prisoners from sending samples of bodily fluids
to a forensic laboratory in order to establish their innocence."
Gerber's request "involves essentially the same procedure; yet, the
warden has failed to explain why Gerber's request" is different,
Tashima wrote.</TE>
<TE>   In a separate dissent, Judge Alex Kozinski wrote that "production
of the semen and delivery to a laboratory neither compromises
security, nor places a strain on prison resources beyond that
required to mail any other package."</TE>
<TE>   Kozinski said that Gerber was asking "only to engage in activities
that prisoners are already free to engage in," such as masturbation.</TE>
<TE>   "That these activities might result in the creation of a life
outside prison walls is no more inconsistent with Gerber's status as
a prisoner than is any other consequence of mailing materials from
prison to the outside world," wrote Kozinski, a Reagan appointee.</TE>
<TE>   For example, Kozinski said, "a prisoner might become a
best-selling author by sending out a manuscript for a novel of
biography," citing the example of O.J. Simpson's 1995 book, "I Want
to Tell You," written with Laurence Schiller while he was jailed in
Los Angeles awaiting trial on charges of murdering his ex-wife Nicole
Brown Simpson and her friend Ronald L. Goldman.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, Kozinski said, the majority had failed to heed an
earlier Supreme Court decision that held that when a prison
regulation creates restrictions that have consequences for people
outside the prison, such as inmate Gerber's wife, the regulation
should "be subjected to more searching scrutiny than when the burden
falls only on inmates."</TE>
<TE>   Also dissenting were Clinton appointees Michael D. Hawkins,
Richard A. Paez and Marsha S. Berzon.</TE>
<TE>   California Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer praised Thursday's ruling,
saying, "The law, as well as common sense, recognizes that
individuals who commit serious crimes forfeit many rights that
law-abiding citizens enjoy."</TE>
<TE>   Gerber's attorney, Teresa Zuber of Sacramento, said the decision
"is obviously disappointing to the Gerbers, and disturbing to anyone
troubled by a government that can dictate who may or may not have
children." She said that the Gerbers have not yet decided whether
they will appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court.</TE>
<TE>   Legal analysts were divided on the merits of the ruling. "I think
the difference here is that the majority understands that people are
in prison to be punished," said Kent Scheidegger, legal director of
the Criminal Justice Legal Foundation, a conservative organization in
Sacramento. "Not having normal family relationships is part of what
being in prison is all about."</TE>
<TE>   Franklin E. Zimring, a criminal law professor at UC Berkeley's
Boalt Hall Law School, said he was troubled by the ruling and its
ramifications.</TE>
<TE>   "This kind of litigation outcome may be a symptom of a much larger
failure to take seriously the question of the legitimate interests of
prisoners and those who are in sustained relationships with them,"
Zimring said. "I am much more worried about the majority's
dismissiveness of the human interest involved in a case like this
than I am about the ease of ridiculing the idea of a constitutional
right to send sperm through the mail."</TE>

<HD>Blake Case Revives Issue of Cameras in Court</HD>
<DH>Despite backlash after the O.J. Simpson case, most judges
allow trials to be televised. But some still doubt that it serves the
cause of justice.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ZANTO PEABODY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Will accused murderer Robert Blake take a place among the cast of
characters--Sara Jane Olson, Mike Tyson and, of course, O.J.
Simpson--who have starred as themselves in real-life courtroom
dramas?</LD>
<LD>   While the controversy over cameras in courts has largely subsided
since the tumult of the Simpson murder trial, the Blake case is
rekindling debate over whether televised court proceedings are
instructive or merely serve as trivial amusement that can have a
negative effect on justice.</LD>
<LD>   More than five years ago, on the heels of Simpson's trial, a state
Judicial Council task force rewrote the rules on media and the courts
to make clear that trial judges have almost complete discretion over
whether all, part or none of a trial is televised.</LD>
<TE>   "If we can't trust the discretion of our justices, the whole court
system's in trouble," said state Appeals Court Judge Richard Huffman,
who headed the task force.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the Simpson trial backlash, which led to some judges and
attorneys calling for a complete ban on courtroom cameras, a study in
2000 showed that four of every five TV requests were approved by
judges throughout the state in 1998 and 1999. Rarely were denials
appealed.</TE>
<TE>   The top three counties for all types of camera requests, including
still photos for newspapers, were Ventura, with 425; Los Angeles,
with 401; and Kern, with 397. In Los Angeles County, 93% of TV camera
requests were approved during the time of the study. In Kern County,
the approval rate was 83%, and in Ventura County, 66%.</TE>
<TE>   The rules clearly prohibit photographing jury selection, jurors
and spectators in the courtroom. And they require formal written
requests for media coverage in each trial.</TE>
<TE>   Some TV crews have argued that the rules' requirement that
requests be made five days in advance of a broadcast is burdensome,
said Judicial Council spokeswoman Lynn Holton.</TE>
<TE>   But the stipulation is not always enforced. For example, the media
cannot always know five days in advance that an arraignment is set.</TE>
<TE>   Huffman said that despite the misgivings of some participants in
the justice system, courts have a responsibility to make their
workings public in most cases.</TE>
<TE>   When he was a trial judge, Huffman said, he found ways to open his
courtroom to TV while also protecting witnesses.</TE>
<TE>   In one case, he recalls ordering bailiffs to sneak a murder
witness into the courthouse through a hidden rooftop entrance to
avoid being filmed while allowing coverage of the trial.</TE>
<TE>   In cases with Hollywood angles, the show-biz factor has been
unpredictable, with some trials aired and others not.</TE>
<TE>   "If people come out of the woodwork [to testify] in a high-profile
case, they're going to be there if it's on TV or not," said 1st
Amendment attorney Kellie Sager, who is representing media outlets in
a bid to televise Blake's court proceedings. "There are those of us
who see the courts belong to the people, and the people should be
able to see what's going on."</TE>
<TE>   One South Carolina circuit judge, William L. Howard, changed his
mind about cameras after becoming more involved with the media in
1996.</TE>
<TE>   Howard blocked camera crews from the trial of Susan Smith, the
mother accused of killing her two children by driving them into a
lake. The reason, he recalls, was because he was upset with how the
Simpson case coverage was being handled.</TE>
<TE>   Now, however, he speaks in favor of broadcasting trials. "O.J. was
a great education for courts and the media," Howard said.</TE>
<TE>   Federal courts, which allow no TV cameras, are the next frontier.</TE>
<TE>   Sens. Charles E. Grassley (R-Iowa) and Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.)
reintroduced the Sunshine in the Courtroom Act, which would allow
cameras in federal courtrooms. They revived the act following the
delayed audio airing of arguments in the U.S. Supreme Court election
case that decided the last presidential election.</TE>
<TE>   The legislation made it out of committee in November, and is
awaiting a vote of the full Senate.</TE>
<TE>   Familiar lines already are being drawn in the case of Blake, the
1970s television star accused of murdering his wife, Bonny Lee
Bakley.</TE>
<TE>   Blake's attorney, Harland W. Braun, has asked the judge to bar
television coverage, saying it would influence the testimony of
witnesses.</TE>
<TE>   "The difference is this is a Hollywood case, and to some
witnesses, the Hollywood rules apply," Braun said. "Truth, reality
and fantasy are interchangeable. It doesn't matter who you are. It
matters who people think you are.</TE>
<TE>   "So, you'll have witnesses who are stuntmen, cameramen, minor
actors exaggerate things to give themselves a bigger role."</TE>
<TE>   The district attorney's office counters that cameras should be
permitted in the courtroom.</TE>
<TE>   "The D.A. has a policy of not opposing cameras," prosecutor
Gregory A. Dohi said before Blake's arraignment April 22.</TE>
<TE>   Court Commissioner Michael Duffey allowed cameras during the
arraignment, saying Braun already had invited the media in with
interviews on morning news shows.</TE>
<TE>   The Blake case is now before Superior Court Judge Lloyd M. Nash.
Thus far, Nash has banned cameras from his Van Nuys courtroom during
the Blake proceedings.</TE>

<HD>County Looks to Boost Road Work Funds</HD>
<DH>Growth: Development fees for new homes would rise under
deals offered to cities.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARGARET TALEV</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>New home prices could rise by hundreds of dollars as Ventura County
looks to raise development fees in its 10 cities to boost lagging
road improvement funds.</LD>
<LD>   Cities already impose fees for road maintenance and
improvements--from $256 per new home in Simi Valley to $5,245 in
Ventura. Such fees also are charged on new office and factory space,
with developers passing on the costs to home buyers and business
owners.</LD>
<LD>   While the county imposes similar traffic fees on construction
outside city limits, anti-sprawl policies have funneled development
into cities. As a result, the county says it is falling short of
money to maintain connector roads such as Harbor Boulevard between
Oxnard and Ventura.</LD>
<TE>   At about $11 million a year, the county's share of state gasoline
taxes covers maintenance and operation of local roads but doesn't
leave enough for needed improvements, said Butch Britt, deputy public
works director. Meanwhile, the county is facing a budget shortfall of
at least $17.6 million this year.</TE>
<TE>   So the county has turned to cities with a proposition: It will
charge more for any construction in unincorporated areas at the edge
of cities and hand the extra fees--the amount over what is now
charged--to those cities. In turn, the cities are being asked to levy
a higher fee on development in city limits and forward the extra
money--an estimated $45 million through 2020--to the county.</TE>
<TE>   Thousand Oaks signed off on such a plan this week, adding a $55
county traffic mitigation fee to the $2,620 the city now charges
developers for each new home built in the city. Simi Valley approved
a plan last week, adding $33 to the city's $256 traffic fee per new
home. In Moorpark, the city manager was preparing to authorize an
additional $156 above the $3,000 the city now collects per new home.</TE>
<TE>   Fillmore's agreement, approved in February, adds $101 for the
county to the $766 the city now collects from developers for traffic.</TE>
<TE>   Council members in Santa Paula and Ventura were considering
similar plans. The fee formulas are based on county traffic
engineering studies.</TE>
<TE>   In Camarillo and Oxnard, officials have shared traffic fees with
the county since the early 1990s, but both cities are considering
adjustments to their formulas at the county's request. Camarillo's
fees would change little, but Oxnard's fees could increase by $200.
Ojai and Port Hueneme, small cities where little construction occurs,
have proposals under review. Port Hueneme could face the highest
increase per home, at $584.</TE>
<TE>   Although Fillmore moved quickly to approve its increase, city
engineer Bert Rapp wasn't happy about it. "The best way to pass on
the true cost of anything in society is to let it be in the purchase
price, not hidden somewhere," Rapp said. "[Traffic fees] ought to be
in the gas tax, not hidden in the price of a home, so that people
have a real decision to make: 'Should I ride my bike to work instead
of buying gas?'</TE>
<TE>   "The no-growth community sees anything they can tack onto the cost
of development as a way to slow down development," Rapp said. "But it
just seems illogical to me that we're going through this process,
when the cost should be in the gas tax at the pump."</TE>
<TE>   Thousand Oaks Public Works Director Don Nelson sees it
differently. "New development should pay for the impacts created by
it, and this is consistent with that philosophy," he said. "No one
wants to pay more taxes, but the value of a quality infrastructure
system is important. If you have pothole-ridden streets, the value of
homes is less."</TE>
<TE>   Thousand Oaks stands to gain more than many other city through a
reciprocal traffic mitigation agreement with the county.</TE>
<TE>   That is because much of the remaining development is at the city's
unincorporated edges. While the city will charge developers $55 extra
to help the county, the county will charge developers an additional
$2,620 for each home at the city's edge and pass that money to the
city for traffic improvements.</TE>
<TE>   While the Building Industry Assn. of Southern California isn't
generally supportive of fee increases, spokeswoman Rondi Guthrie said
the group decided not to oppose Ventura County's plans. For one,
Guthrie said, county roads need to be well maintained.</TE>

<HD>Whispering Hills Rolls Along</HD>
<DH>Land use: San Juan Capistrano council OKs development for
175 homes and a high school. Citizens group says it will continue to
fight project.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVE McKIBBEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Whispering Hills, an upscale housing tract proposed for the eastern
edge of San Juan Capistrano, won City Council approval this week, but
the shouting may not be over.</LD>
<LD>   In making its decision, to be finalized June 4, the council went
against a staff recommendation and acted just a week after receiving
a Planning Commission report on the project.</LD>
<LD>   "After four years of watching and studying this issue, if you
didn't have a good handle on it by Tuesday night, then you weren't
going to," Councilman David M. Swerdlin said. "I don't know if
waiting would have benefited anybody."</LD>
<TE>   But Mark Nielsen, whose group Citizens Against Uncontrolled San
Juan Expansion has fought Whispering Hills since its inception four
years ago, said the council, which voted 3 to 1 for the development,
should have taken more time to digest the Planning Commission's
report and the latest public testimony.</TE>
<TE>   The citizens group, which says it has 1,000 members on its mailing
list, maintains that the 356-acre hillside development at La Pata
Avenue and Ortega Highway will worsen traffic, destroy back country
and endanger wildlife.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a number of alternatives we'll look at," Nielsen said
this week of the project, which will include 175 homes and the town's
first high school in 40 years. "The options range from lawsuits to
ballot referendums."</TE>
<TE>   Capistrano Union High School, a block from the historic mission in
the center of town, was closed in 1963 because it was outdated and
small. Since then, students have attended high schools in other
cities.</TE>
<TE>   Swerdlin said a lawsuit would simply delay construction of the new
school, scheduled to open in September 2005. Capistrano Unified
School District officials say San Juan Hills High is being built to
ease overcrowding in the district's five high schools: Aliso Niguel,
Capistrano Valley, Dana Hills, San Clemente and Tesoro.</TE>
<TE>   "If they decide to sue, I think a lot of people will consider that
as being against the high school," he said. "I think the community
overall would suffer," and classrooms would remain overcrowded.</TE>
<TE>   Swerdlin had questioned his own eligibility to vote on the issue
because he had worked with Whispering Hills development consultant
Phil Schwartze on other projects. On Monday, the state Fair Political
Practices Commission ruled that he could participate.</TE>
<TE>   Mayor Diane Bathgate, an urban planner, abstained because she
prepared a report for Capistrano Unified about the proposed school
site. Councilman John Gelff, who favored a smaller development, cast
the dissenting vote.</TE>
<TE>   The number of units approved by the council--160 in the east
canyon and 15 in the west canyon--was less than the 193 that the
developer wanted but 72 more than Nielsen's group was urging.</TE>

<HD>L.A.'s a Step Away From a Borough Plan</HD>
<DH>Reforms enacted in 1999 already mandate some power-sharing.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RAPHAEL J. SONENSHEIN</AU>
<BD>Raphael J. Sonenshein, a political scientist at Cal
State Fullerton, was executive director of the Los Angeles Appointed
Charter Reform Commission.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The proposal by five City Council members to create a borough system
for Los Angeles could enhance the voter-enacted reforms of 1999 that
gave neighborhoods greater control over their affairs. It also may
provide a middle ground between secession and the status quo.</LD>
<LD>   With literally everything about the structure of Los Angeles on
the table between now and November, it is worth the effort to explore
every reasonable alternative that could increase the responsiveness
of government without the unforeseeable consequences of a divorce.</LD>
<LD>   Boroughs are not a new idea in Los Angeles, a city that has long
been searching for ways to tie together its far-flung communities.
Some suggest that the current crisis over Los Angeles governance is a
bad time to reintroduce boroughs. Actually, there is no better
moment. Noisy times produce enduring reforms. The City Charter
reforms were the products of the pressure of secession. Public unrest
can create deep change because, rather than springing whole from the
active brains of good-government theorists, reforms respond directly
to a need felt by residents.</LD>
<TE>   What is a borough? In a borough system, smaller units of
government have some authority within a larger system of city
government. The city government still retains its general powers, but
boroughs have some autonomy.</TE>
<TE>   To understand the concept of a borough, consider the American
system of governing vast areas of diverse populations. Each state has
its own scope and authority subject to the U.S. Constitution and
federal law. Cities and counties are smaller units of states, and
each has some autonomy subject to the state constitution and laws. If
L.A. sets up a borough system, each borough would have some
independence within the framework of the Los Angeles City Charter and
city ordinances.</TE>
<TE>   By contrast, secession would break apart the city government. It
would create one or more independent cities with no formal
relationship with each other.</TE>
<TE>   Critics of a borough system have presented it as a radical change
that would utterly alter local government or create a new layer of
bureaucracy. Actually, the 1999 reforms already have taken the city
well down the road to boroughs. It's only a matter of completing the
process.</TE>
<TE>   The centerpiece of charter reform was the creation of a citywide
system of neighborhood councils built around the principle that
people should have the opportunity to be heard on all civic matters
that affect their neighborhoods. Even though the councils are only
advisory, they are a step toward the broader goal of boroughs:
empowering communities within the city government. The 30th
neighborhood council was just certified.</TE>
<TE>   The biggest step toward a borough structure in the new charter is
the area planning commission system, which has authority over some
local land-use matters. This reform may be unique among American
cities. The commissioners, appointed by the mayor and confirmed by
the City Council, must live within the boundaries of the panel's
jurisdiction.</TE>
<TE>   With neighborhood councils preparing to provide community input
into government decisions, and with area planning commissions already
making formal decisions on some land-use matters, Los Angeles has
some key elements necessary for a borough system. There is only one
critical element missing: elections.</TE>
<TE>   If the City Charter were amended to empower residents to choose
people to represent them in a borough--whether presidents, council
members, ombudsmen or area planning commissioners--the current system
would in one leap have the skeleton of a borough system.</TE>
<TE>   Even without adding a single formal power to the area planning
commissions, the election of its members or their appointment by
elected borough officials would dramatically change their
orientation. (Of course, other powers could be added, such as partial
control of the budget.) Commissioners now are accountable to the
mayor and the City Council; under a borough system, they would be
accountable to borough voters.</TE>
<TE>   Borough officials would act as local watchdogs over the delivery
of city services. Residents could go to a borough hall to lodge
complaints and could certainly expect the person they voted for to
get things straightened out. Neighborhood councils would lobby
borough halls as well as City Hall.</TE>
<TE>   Boroughs are no silver bullet able to miraculously close the
distance between neighborhoods and City Hall. But a borough plan is a
serious proposal consistent with the direction of city reforms.</TE>
<TE>   Five years ago, neighborhood councils were a radical idea and area
planning commissions had not emerged in the debate. Now both are in
operation. Los Angeles needed to walk before it could run. Now is the
time to pick up the pace.</TE>

<HD>Rein In Pakistan or Lose India</HD>
<DH>U.S. must focus on a resolution of the Kashmir dispute.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RAY TAKEYH and NIKOLAS K. GVOSDEV</AU>
<BD>Ray Takeyh is a fellow at the Washington Institute for
Near East Policy. Nikolas K. Gvosdev is a senior fellow in strategic
studies at the Nixon Center.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>While Secretary of State Colin L. Powell feverishly works to avoid
the outbreak of a full-scale war between India and Pakistan, the
ongoing developments in Kashmir reiterate the need for a sustained
U.S. focus on the region. Powell's long-held position--to expect
these two foes to work out the issue of Kashmir themselves--is no
longer tenable.</LD>
<LD>   In the aftermath of the attack in December on the Indian
Parliament, intense U.S. pressure compelled Pakistani President
Pervez Musharraf to arrest hundreds of Islamic militants and promise
to shut down their training camps.</LD>
<LD>   Believing the problem solved, Washington diverted its attention to
the crisis in the Middle East. With American scrutiny relaxed, the
militants publicly rounded up last winter were quietly released. U.S.
intelligence confirms that the training camps believed closed have
been reactivated. As the snow melts, the number of
Pakistani-supported militants crossing the border into India has
increased.</LD>
<TE>   The people of Kashmir have legitimate grievances. The
assassination of moderate leader Abdul Ghani Lone, however, again
demonstrates that, as in Chechnya, the aspirations of the local
population for self-determination have been hijacked by radical
Muslims bent on exploiting this struggle to provide cover for their
worldwide campaign against secular rule. Militant Pakistani Muslims
have established subsidiary organizations in Kashmir that not only
advance the cause of radical Islam but have formed substantive links
with Al Qaeda.</TE>
<TE>   Although Washington has worked hard to sanitize Musharraf, it is
important to recall that, as army chief of staff, he cultivated the
links between Pakistan's religious militants and their brethren in
Afghanistan and Kashmir.</TE>
<TE>   Given the porous nature of the border between Afghanistan and
Pakistan, Washington should be concerned about fleeing Al Qaeda or
Taliban fighters finding refuge in Pakistani-controlled camps and
being reborn as "Kashmiri freedom fighters."</TE>
<TE>   Musharraf has shown himself to be a consummate pragmatist. After
Sept. 11, he readily abandoned Pakistan's Taliban proteges in Kabul
and aligned himself with Washington in order to get U.S. aid and
tacit legitimation of Pakistan's possession of nuclear weapons. In
what is arguably the greatest diplomatic triumph in the annals of
Pakistani history, Musharraf managed to transform Pakistan from a
"rogue" state into a key ally of the U.S. war on terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   While Washington continues to press sanctions against states--such
as Iran--that pursue weapons of mass destruction and support
Palestinian terrorists, Islamabad has largely escaped criticism
because of the deft diplomatic skills of its warrior-president.</TE>
<TE>   Musharraf continues to believe that he can quietly bleed India by
using the Muslim militants who provide him with "plausible
deniability" while the U.S. is distracted by the Israeli-Palestinian
conflict.</TE>
<TE>   However, the Pakistani strongman is susceptible to U.S. pressure,
and he can be induced to abandon Pakistan's support of the militants
if that pressure is applied.</TE>
<TE>   American credibility in the war on terror, as well as the emerging
strategic relationship between India and the U.S., is at stake.</TE>
<TE>   India is the cornerstone for peace and stability throughout South
Asia. For its part, the Indian government of Atal Behari Vajpayee has
diminished the Bharatiya Janata Party's traditional resentment of the
U.S. and openly called the two sides "natural allies."</TE>
<TE>   Unless Washington now tempers the designs of its new Pakistani
ally, the nascent strategic relationship between India and the U.S.
that is so critical to stabilization of an increasingly volatile
South Asia--and which may hold the key to a final resolution of the
Kashmir dilemma--will be lost.</TE>

<LD>The ambush by suspected Al Qaeda and Taliban forces that killed Green
Beret Sgt. Gene Arden Vance Jr. this week was a reminder that the
fighting in Afghanistan, while not as intense as in the war's early
days, is far from over. The Bush administration gets this. What it
seems not to get is the need for peacekeepers outside Kabul; only
hunting down terrorists won't keep this Central Asian nation from
slipping back into the chaos that allowed Al Qaeda to thrive.</LD>
<LD>   Vance's death came a month after U.S. bombs accidentally killed
four Canadian soldiers. Continued assaults on patrols and mortar
attacks on bases of allied troops also demonstrate that a British
general was wrong to declare the campaign to drive out the terrorists
"all but won."</LD>
<LD>   No one in the Bush administration or U.S. military ever predicted
that battling in the mountains of Afghanistan would be quick or easy.
Now U.S. officials need to recognize the need for stability.</LD>
<TE>   The House of Representatives voted this week to give $1.3billion
in aid, including $300million to develop and arm the Afghan military.
Several members demanded that the Bush administration spell out its
strategy for providing security for Afghanistan, especially when
warlords continue to clash and common criminals prey on travelers in
areas outside Kabul.</TE>
<TE>   The U.N. Security Council wasn't helpful when it followed
Washington's wish that the peacekeeping force not be expanded. The
success of the international brigade in bringing security to Kabul
argues for its expansion to cities like Mazar-i-Sharif, Herat and
Jalalabad. The U.N. troops in Kabul have not interfered with U.S.
operations in the capital; there is no reason to believe they would
get in the way in other cities, despite Bush administration concern.</TE>
<TE>   Security will be especially important when the Afghan loya jirga,
or grand council, opens its weeklong meeting June 10. The 1,500
members will pick a transitional government to rule until elections
in two years, an important step on the road to becoming a functioning
nation again.</TE>
<TE>   Afghanistan's centuries-long tradition of ethnic battles continues
today. Jousting for positions in the new government can turn violent.</TE>
<TE>   Making Afghans living outside Kabul and foreign aid workers in the
countryside feel safe also would help in opening schools, planting
crops and carrying out the other tasks of rebuilding a nation
shattered by more than two decades of war.</TE>
<TE>   There have been successes, especially in getting girls into
classrooms after they were barred by the Taliban, but the process of
reconstruction has just begun.</TE>

<HD>9/11: Outside Probe Needed</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In those raw early days when public fear smoldered along with the
World Trade Center and the Pentagon, President Bush rightly refused
to point a finger at intelligence agency failures. But nine months is
more than enough time to wait for a fair and sober investigation of
what went wrong and how it can be fixed.</LD>
<LD>   Bush and Republican lawmakers should be supporting, not fighting,
Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle's (D-S.D.) call for an independent
commission to probe why, in retrospect, the United States looked like
such a fat, easy target.</LD>
<LD>   House Majority Whip Tom DeLay (R-Texas), among others, has
declared that it will be a boon to Osama bin Laden if the U.S.
publicly scrutinizes its intelligence weaknesses. But no one's
talking about inviting Al Qaeda to update blueprints of America's
nuclear reactors. What would be stupidly unpatriotic is to stick our
heads in the sand.</LD>
<TE>   Unfortunately, the House-Senate Select Intelligence Committee's
attempt to investigate has been as ineffective as the intelligence
community's follow-up on pre-9/11 warnings of terrorists' possible
enrollment in flight schools. FBI and CIA uncooperativeness is a big
part of the problem. Then there's the matter of the House and
Senate's own failures to exercise their oversight responsibilities
more carefully before Sept. 11. In fact, no branch of government has
a real incentive to carry out a diligent investigation.</TE>
<TE>   That's why it's imperative for Congress to appoint an independent
and bipartisan panel, headed by leaders with the clout to reach
authoritative conclusions. We nominate Warren B. Rudman and Gary
Hart, former senators whose commission on terrorism in February of
last year called for a Cabinet-level agency to address the growing
terrorist threat. The panel could look at the record of the CIA under
the Clinton administration's R. James Woolsey and current Director
George J. Tenet. It could poke hard at inadequate congressional
oversight. And it would help explain why Bush wasn't given more solid
and precise information before 9/11.</TE>
<TE>   Despite DeLay's huffing and harrumphing about the need to give the
administration a free hand in wartime, a spooked public is eager for
answers. The government's flurry of vague warnings this week suggests
that the administration doesn't have much of a handle on new threats.</TE>
<TE>   A hard-nosed independent commission could do more than a battery
of antiaircraft guns or a troop of sky marshals to bolster America's
defenses.</TE>

<LD>Consider it the culture of celebrity's high-water mark. In a dazzling
triumph for the self-promotion that was the benchmark of his career,
Andy Warhol, champion of two- dimensional hero worship, has extended
his 15 minutes of fame to, if not Elvis-level immortality, then at
least Monroe-level longevity. And it is fitting that the Warhol
retrospective opening Saturday at the Museum of Contemporary Art says
as much about economics as art.</LD>
<LD>   Not long ago, "commercial art" was a contradiction in terms.
Museums had a wall to separate artistic from financial concerns. Then
Warhol grabbed attention by putting Coca-Cola bottles and boxes of
Brillo pads on canvas, subverting the line between art and commerce.</LD>
<LD>   Since then, the costs of insurance, transportation and
installation have battered down the walls meant to keep museums
artistically pure. One result: At MOCA's gift shop, $47 buys a
Campbell's soup can tote bag that imitates a Warhol painting of a
Campbell's tomato soup can that was inspired by a bona fide
Campbell's soup can of the sort one can purchase at Albertsons for 89
cents--filled with tomato soup.</LD>
<TE>   The MOCA show, the first major retrospective of Warhol's work
since a 1989 installation at the Museum of Modern Art in New York,
clearly hopes to repeat the success of the Los Angeles County Museum
of Art's "Van Gogh's Van Goghs: Masterpieces From the Van Gogh
Museum, Amsterdam." To that end, MOCA has teamed up with the city,
the Los Angeles Convention and Visitors Bureau, corporate sponsors
and private donors to launch a marketing blitz of banners,
billboards, hotel packages, poster giveaways and contests offering
free trips to L.A.</TE>
<TE>   The Warhol retrospective is a daring test for MOCA and its newly
created team, the sort of experiment in survival that museums can no
longer afford to disdain.</TE>
<TE>   With more than 250 works created by the artist over almost 50
years, the exhibit has the potential to expose new audiences to
modern art in a lively, engaging way. It should infuse MOCA with
badly needed funds for future exhibits.</TE>
<TE>   Warhol was no Van Gogh, though, and if the show is a blockbuster,
it will also be a tribute to America's infatuation with fame and its
weakness for hyperbole. But then Warhol might have been the first to
declare that pointing out and encouraging these characteristics was a
great genius of his life's work.</TE>

<LD>Re "N.Y. Landmarks Targeted in Terrorism Warning," May 22:</LD>
<LD>   I awaken in my home in Topanga under "code yellow," under Homeland
Security Director Tom Ridge's color scheme. I shower, eat breakfast
and drive to work in Century City, as I have done for the last 20
years. I work until noon, then go to a local restaurant for lunch. I
work until 6 in the evening, then meet my wife (who works in Santa
Monica) for dinner at a restaurant on Montana Avenue. We drive home
along the Pacific Coast Highway and Topanga Canyon Boulevard in
separate cars. At home we both read for a while, then watch the news
on TV and go to bed.</LD>
<LD>   I do not know what we would do differently if we awakened the next
morning under a "code orange" or a "code red." Or, for that matter,
if Vice President Dick Cheney and Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld
were out in our driveway with bullhorns trumpeting the end of
civilization as we know it. I would probably tell them to get out of
the way so that my wife and I could drive to work.</LD>

<TE>   Re "Daschle Joins Those Urging Independent 9/11 Inquiry," May 22:
Once again Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle (D-S.D.) gropes in the
dark, searching for any possible leverage and footing for his
staggering party as he calls for an independent panel to investigate
government action before Sept. 11. This latest example of poor timing
and political judgment is cause for Republicans everywhere to breathe
easier, as the majority leader's actions will only further expose his
own party's incompetence and missed opportunities under the previous
administration's terror watch.</TE>
<TE>   So we applaud Daschle's efforts and encourage him to look deep and
hard as he shines the light for all Americans to see the true motives
of his party, as our president continues to dismantle and own the
Democrats' sacred election issues.</TE>

<TE>   Magalia, Calif.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   As usual, Robert Scheer gets it right ("Hiding Behind a Veil of
Executive Privilege?" Commentary, May 21). Who among us wouldn't ask
questions of the right people when a report comes in about possible
terrorist hijackings in this country?</TE>
<TE>   I don't think the American people can be duped about this, but the
dictatorial spin that, more strongly than I've ever seen, discourages
people to speak out is strong-arming our people and sending us down a
very dangerous path.</TE>
<TE>   Sheila Hoff</TE>
<TE>   Rancho Palos Verdes</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   As usual, Scheer is comically loony with his speculations and
leaps with regard to "what Bush knew." Connecting the dots is one
thing; making them up is something else again.</TE>
<TE>   Scheer apparently cannot face the fact that the Clinton
administration is, without question, most responsible for what
occurred on Sept. 11. Clinton's evisceration of the intelligence
agencies, his lack of interest in foreign policy except when it
served his momentary purpose, his disrespect for the military and
American defense in general, his dearth of concern for anything
beyond his own persona: These are the factors that left this nation
open to such an egregious attack, an attack that was in the works
years before President Bush took office.</TE>
<TE>   Yes, the CIA, the FBI and the FAA are culpable, but Bill Clinton
bears the ultimate responsibility--if it is to be laid at the feet of
one man. I can just imagine what Scheer would be writing if Bush had
had specific advance knowledge and as a result had detained and
investigated Arab air passengers or grounded all air traffic. He'd be
shrieking about civil rights violations, racism and the
administration's paranoia.</TE>

related.</TE>

<LD>   Sadly, the victims I saw in Nablus recently were not so fortunate.
Ambulances were destroyed and medical personnel attacked while trying
to reach civilians lying in streets and the rubble of their homes.
The Israeli Defense Forces' claims that ambulances carried weapons
and explosives are false. I was fortunate to accompany some of these
dedicated technicians, whose only concern was to provide aid to
innocent people who happened to be Palestinians.</LD>
<LD>   Terrorism is reprehensible whether committed by suicide bomber,
tank or a rocket fired from an Apache helicopter. All forms of
terrorism must stop if there is ever to be peace in the region.</LD>

<TE>   "In Maiming Israeli Bodies, Bombers Maim the Soul," Commentary,
May 21: What does the Palestinian bomber really seek? I think that
what the Palestinian suicide bomber seeks is to let the world--and
specifically the Israeli people--know that he or she, in a state of
hopelessness, is tired of having his or her dignity and right to
existence denied. Palestinians' rights to education, access to
medical care and emotional well-being, along with their pursuit of
freedom and economic independence, are compromised. Unfortunately,
the state of despair they find themselves in has led them to succumb
to the only weapon that they have, which is being suicide bombers.</TE>
<TE>   The authors of this commentary can easily reference their
observations interchangeably to what the Palestinians are subjected
to. By no means do I justify suicide bombings directed at innocent
Israeli citizens. By the same token, I do not justify Israeli attacks
on innocent Palestinian citizens. Until both sides start seeing each
other as equal and as human beings, as they are seen in the eyes of
God, there will never be a solution for this very complicated
conflict.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>I have been reading a lot about secession. As a retiree on a fixed
income, I have many worries about how this will affect my finances.
Specifically, if this goes through and I wind up in a new Valley
city, there will be no rent-control law to cover the building in
which I have lived for 14 years. Even if the new Valley City Council
soon moves to implement an identical (or similar) law, there will be
a period when landlords can raise their rents any amount they want
to. Many retirees in a similar financial situation who live in the
Valley may suddenly find themselves unable to afford their new rents
and will be in no position to move to new quarters.</LD>
<LD>   I wonder if LAFCO has taken into account how secession will affect
those of us in the Valley who are only hanging on to our housing
because we are under the city of Los Angeles rent control law?</LD>

<TE>   Gale Holland (Opinion, May 19) finds it a "howler" to suggest that
the government of an independent Valley would be smaller, more
efficient and responsive. While the Valley would replace Phoenix as
the sixth-largest city in the country, the remaining Los Angeles
would still have almost twice the population of the Valley. It has
been statistically proven that smaller (not smallest) can be better,
and that bigger, in many government services, simply is not.</TE>

<LD>I've just read "Beware the Soccer Hooligans" (May 22), on the
likelihood of unruly World Cup enthusiasts invading Japan, and I'm
left with two questions: Who invited the World Cup to Japan, and why?
You reported that the country has a special national anti-hooligan
budget of $35.6million and that "thousands of Japanese police have
fanned out to warn businesses of the danger of hooligans." The
specter supposedly raises fears throughout the country, with one
member of Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party quoted: "We must
also brace against unwanted babies being conceived by foreigners who
rape our women. Clearly we must prepare for the worst."</LD>
<LD>   What exactly is the purpose of holding a World Cup event in a
country that appears to fear its ramifications to this extent? Who
issued the invitation?</LD>

<HD>Aid Stolen by Officials Is No Help to Africa</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Salih Booker's May 20 commentary, "To Help Africa Battle AIDS, Write
Off Its Debt," overlooks the established fact that many of the
current and former African political leaders quietly plundered their
countries' economies, siphoning many hundreds of millions of dollars
(including foreign aid) into their personal bank accounts in
Switzerland, London and other international locations. While I am all
for helping others whenever possible, it seems ludicrous to give aid,
allow it to be stolen and then write it off without any consequences.</LD>
<LD>   There is, of course, an obvious solution that no one has yet
addressed. As with any international financial crime (e.g., Nazi
theft of Holocaust victims' assets), why don't the authorities simply
seize this substantial pool of funds from the parasites who stole it
and use it, in a controlled distribution, for the benefit of the
African people, as intended? So simple.</LD>
<LD>   Martin D. Webley</LD>
<TE>   Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   What am I missing here? Booker argues that "the United States has
the power to change this [resolve the African debt crisis] at little
cost." If this can be achieved at such little cost, then why is it
such a problem for the African countries to meet their obligations?</TE>
<TE>   When the West extends loans, they are apparently viewed as being
"pushed on African governments with little thought to their purpose
or to their recipients' capacity to repay." However, when we deny
resources, we are considered miserly and lacking in compassion. If
the demand for coffee had increased by 60% rather than declining,
does anyone really think we might expect Uganda to exhibit compassion
by putting a cap on prices?</TE>
<TE>   While one can appreciate the current difficulties confronting many
African nations, it should be remembered that the African continent
has an abundance of natural resources with which to settle its debts
to the rest of the world. Nigeria, for example, is rich in minerals
and benefits from every increase that OPEC makes in oil prices. The
resources provided to the African people--represented by the amount
of the African debt to the World Bank--could, no doubt, have been
effectively used elsewhere in the world.</TE>

<LD>I greatly appreciated Saul Janson's "There Goes the Neighborhood"
(Voices, May 18), illuminating the bittersweet joys of homeownership.
He comments, "Sure, it's comforting to come home to this huge asset
every day, but I'm not planning to go anywhere." This reflects that
fact that there are two widely held assumptions about continuing to
live in one's home. We can make both more tenable.</LD>
<LD>   First is the assumption that we'll be able to go where we've gone
before. Friends, family members and homeowners may be excluded from a
home that isn't accessible. "Well, you can always buy another one"
sounds nice, but often choice will be limited, property taxes will be
much higher (thanks to Proposition 13, they're limited on the home
the homeowner can no longer inhabit) and income won't have kept pace
with housing prices. (Santa Monica and Irvine are among the national
leaders in ensuring accessibility in new construction.)</LD>
<TE>   Second is an assumption that there will be adequate in-home
assistance. Medicaid funds could be used for this. This would be a
great savings to taxpayers, who now subsidize the nursing-home
industry. That's the intent of the Medicaid Community Attendant
Services and Supports Act pending before Congress. Building on these
initiatives, we can avoid what could have been Janson's headline:
"Here Comes the Neighborhood: Richer Monetarily, but Poorer in
Ethnicity, Age and Disability Diversity."</TE>

<HD>David Abrahamsen, 98; His Books Analyzed Nixon, 'Son of
Sam'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DENNIS McLELLAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dr. David Abrahamsen, an internationally respected psychoanalyst and
authority on criminal behavior whose books include a psychobiography
of President Richard M. Nixon and an analysis of serial killer David
Berkowitz (the "Son of Sam"), has died. He was 98.</LD>
<LD>   Abrahamsen died Monday at his home in Hamden, Conn. The cause of
death was not disclosed.</LD>
<LD>   The Norway-born psychiatrist, who had helped write the New York
state insanity law, was hired by prosecutors after Berkowitz's arrest
in August 1977 to determine whether he was fit to stand trial.</LD>
<TE>   The 25-year-old former taxi driver and postal clerk had terrorized
New Yorkers during a 13-month shooting spree in which he shot and
killed six people, five of them young women. Most of them had been
parked in lovers' lanes.</TE>
<TE>   During a two-day competency hearing, Abrahamsen testified that
Berkowitz "understands the charges against him, is able to aid in his
own defense and is able to stand trial."</TE>
<TE>   But Berkowitz, who told detectives after his arrest that he took
orders issued by a demon through dogs, pleaded guilty and never went
on trial.</TE>
<TE>   Although he received the maximum prison term for each of the six
murders--25 years to life--New York state law required that his
sentences be merged as a cumulative sentence that could not exceed 30
years.</TE>
<TE>   Abrahamsen's involvement with Berkowitz did not end with his
imprisonment.</TE>
<TE>   He based his 1985 book "Confessions of Son of Sam" (Columbia
University Press) on more than 155 letters Berkowitz wrote to him and
more than 50 hours of interviews with the killer, his family and
others who knew him.</TE>
<TE>   Abrahamsen found that Berkowitz had become enraged as a young man
to discover that his mother had not died giving birth to him but
instead had given him up for adoption because he was an "accident, a
mistake, never meant to be born."</TE>
<TE>   On one occasion, Berkowitz observed that "many unwanted children
are brought into this world as the result of careless sexual
encounters in automobiles ... It took me 24 years to erupt, to
explode like a volcano. I reached the point where I couldn't keep it
in."</TE>
<TE>   Berkowitz, Abrahamsen wrote, manifested a "psychopathic
personality, a form of character disorder." By killing women,
Abrahamsen contended, Berkowitz was achieving power over them and
sparing other illegitimate children his fate.</TE>
<TE>   Critics tended to dismiss Abrahamsen's psychobiography of
Berkowitz, saying the author's writing was leaden and did not present
much new information and didn't make full use of his access to
interviews and records.</TE>
<TE>   Abrahamsen, who was a fellow of the American Psychiatric Assn. and
of the New York Academy of Medicine, based his 1977 book "Nixon vs.
Nixon: An Emotional Tragedy" (Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux) on interviews
with Nixon's aunt, uncle, cousins and Whittier College classmates as
well as Nixon's taped White House conversations and other sources.</TE>
<TE>   Abrahamsen, who described the book as a study of the emotional
development of Nixon, concluded that the former president suffered
from a serious "character disorder"--that he had "a great neurotic
disturbance" and became "a self-absorbed paranoid."</TE>
<TE>   Abrahamsen contended that Nixon was incapable of rationally
discharging his responsibilities as president and that Nixon based
his decisions in the White House on his own "disturbed needs" rather
than facts.</TE>
<TE>   Abrahamsen's application of orthodox Freudian analysis methods
without ever actually speaking to his "patient" generated
controversy.</TE>
<TE>   In responding to the criticism, Abrahamsen told the New York Times
that he had "obtained the needed data" from members of Nixon's
family. "I also had available the daydreams and fantasies in
[Nixon's] own book, 'Six Crises,' which revealed the man in his own
words.</TE>
<TE>   "Even when the subject is not available for examination, analysis
of the inner man is possible. In fact, second-hand material can
sometimes reveal more than patients themselves."</TE>
<TE>   A member of one of the earliest Jewish families in Norway, he was
born in Trondheim in 1903.</TE>
<TE>   After receiving his medical training at the former Royal Frederick
University in Oslo in 1929, he practiced medicine in Norway for two
years. Later, he was a resident and assistant physician in neurology
and psychiatry at the Psychiatric Clinic in Oslo and a psychiatrist
with the Department of Justice, also in Oslo.</TE>
<TE>   After arriving in the United States in 1940, he served as a
psychiatrist at St. Elizabeth's Hospital in Washington D.C.; the
Illinois State Penitentiary in Joliet; and Bellevue Hospital in New
York.</TE>
<TE>   He also served as director of research on treatment of behavior
disorders in children at New York City's Psychiatric Institute. He
later was a member of the board of overseers of the Lemberg Center
for the Study of Violence at Brandeis University.</TE>
<TE>   Abrahamsen's wife, Lova, died in 1966.</TE>
<TE>   He is survived by two daughters, Inger McCabe Elliott of
Stonington and Anne-Marie Foltz of New Haven, both in Connecticut; a
sister, Beile Hess of Amsterdam; two brothers, Aron of St. Augustine,
Fla., and Abel of New York; five grandchildren; five
great-grandchildren; and three step-grandchildren.</TE>

<HD>Dave Berg, 81; Writer, Artist for Mad Magazine</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DENNIS McLELLAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dave Berg, one of Mad magazine's best-known writer-artists, whose
slice-of-life cartoon strips "The Lighter Side of ..." were one of
the humor magazine's most popular features for more than 40 years,
has died. He was 81.</LD>
<LD>   Berg died of cancer May 16 at his home in Marina del Rey.</LD>
<LD>   Berg's insightful comic take on American life first appeared in
the pages of Mad in 1956, when he began freelancing for the magazine.
"The Lighter Side of ..." began in 1961 and appeared in 365
subsequent issues.</LD>
<TE>   "Dave was a visual critic, but a warm-spirited critic, not a
hard-nosed critic," said Nick Meglin, co-editor of Mad.</TE>
<TE>   "He was not a cynic at all. He saw the American scene as a
wonderful example of our culture, our society and our life, and did
comments on that.</TE>
<TE>   "There were not major political statements being made here. It was
just vignettes that he personally witnessed and did variations on of
everyday life wherever it occurred."</TE>
<TE>   Berg might comment on the vulnerability of the American public in
dealing with car mechanics, for example, or comment on what's
happening in the nation's schoolrooms and living rooms.</TE>
<TE>   "It was not earth-shattering commentary," Meglin said, "but he did
talk about whoever controlled the remote, controlled the household."</TE>
<TE>   Berg originally offered his humorous observations on a single
theme such as "The Lighter Side of Dining Out." But in the late
1960s, he switched to offering vignettes on a variety of topics,
usually 15 different cartoon strips that ran on four or five pages.</TE>
<TE>   Berg often incorporated friends, family members and Mad colleagues
into his cartoons, such as drawing the head of Mad publisher William
M. Gaines hanging on a wall like a mounted deer head. He also
regularly included a strip featuring himself under his alter ego,
Roger Kaputnik.</TE>
<TE>   Berg's son, Mitch, has been appearing in his father's strips since
he was a child growing up in New Rochelle, N.Y.</TE>
<TE>   "He'd see me doing something and say, 'OK, buster, that's going
in,'" Berg recalled.</TE>
<TE>   "You can watch me grow up--as a kid, a teenager, then a hippy. I
opened a nightclub and became well dressed, then went back to hippy
for a while. In the most recent drawing of me, I'm wearing a cowboy
hat and boots with long hair. People recognize me and ask me to sign
autographs all the time."</TE>
<TE>   Not that he ever minded.</TE>
<TE>   "Especially when I was younger--in elementary school, junior high,
high school--that was a big kick--everybody seeing me as a cartoon
guy."</TE>
<TE>   Berg was born in Brooklyn, N.Y., in 1920, the son of a bookbinder.
Displaying artistic talent at an early age, he received a scholarship
to attend a Saturday morning art class at the Pratt Institute when he
was 12.</TE>
<TE>   After high school, he attended Cooper Union Art School in New
York, where he met his future wife, Vivian.</TE>
<TE>   At 20, he landed a job inking backgrounds of the newspaper comic
feature "The Spirit" at the studio of Will Eisner. In time, he and
fellow artist Jules Feiffer wrote the scripts together, with Berg
doing the rough art.</TE>
<TE>   Berg moved on to writing and drawing the comic book series "Death
Patrol" and "Uncle Sam." As a member of the Army Air Corps during
World War II, Berg served as a war correspondent on Iwo Jima, Guam,
Saipan and later in Japan.</TE>
<TE>   After the war, he worked under Stan Lee at Timely Comics (the
original name for Marvel Comics) and at Archie Comics. Then came Mad,
which Berg referred to as "the main attraction, the big event, the
grand opening."</TE>
<TE>   "They were satirizing commercials, movies and TV programs," he
told Contemporary Authors. "I added something new--people. That's
when 'The Lighter Side' was born. It was more than just gags, it was
a psychological and sociological study of the human condition, and
truth in humor."</TE>
<TE>   Over the years, Berg wrote and drew 17 Mad books, with titles such
as "Mad's Dave Berg Looks at Living," "Mad's Dave Berg Looks at
Things," and "Mad's Dave Berg Looks at the USA."</TE>
<TE>   The books, which sold in the millions, added to his fame and
recognizability among Mad fans: He always drew himself on the cover.
On "Mad's Dave Berg Looks at Our Sick World," for example, he drew
himself with his ever-present pipe and a stethoscope touching planet
Earth with Mad's Alfred E. Neuman holding up the Earth like Atlas.</TE>
<TE>   Berg was heavily involved in the Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts in
Westchester County, N.Y., and later served as president of B'nai
B'rith in Marina del Rey. He wrote two humorous religious books: "My
Friend God" and "Roger Kaputnik and God."</TE>
<TE>   Although he cut back a bit on his Mad output in the last few
years, there are still more installments of "The Lighter Side of ..."
to come.</TE>
<TE>   Meglin said that he and his Mad magazine colleagues had an
editorial discussion Wednesday morning over what to do with the
several Berg installments that have yet to run.</TE>
<TE>   "In the last 10 or 15 years, we've ended every one of his segments
where he's at the doctor, because he had so many wonderful gags about
his visits to doctors, with diets and his own problems," Meglin said.</TE>
<TE>   In those, Berg was his Roger Kaputnik alter ego.</TE>
<TE>   "The decision was made that we'll probably let it run with the
doctor segments as he drew them," Meglin said. "This is his work and
his work shouldn't be edited now that he's passed away."</TE>
<TE>   The final "The Lighter Side of ..." by Dave Berg will run in the
September issue, which will mark the 50th anniversary of Mad.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to his wife and son, Berg is survived by a daughter,
Nancy Berg of Woodland Hills.</TE>

<HD>Devices to Save Lives at Border Unveiled</HD>
<DH>Safety: INS measures include 'rescue beacons' in the desert
to call help for illegal migrants threatened by weather and terrain.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LOUIS SAHAGUN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Immigration and Naturalization Service on Thursday unveiled an
array of new measures and high-tech devices to heighten security and
safety along some of the most porous and dangerous stretches of the
U.S.-Mexican border.</LD>
<LD>   The changes focus on the Imperial Valley, which has become an
increasingly popular but perilous crossing point since a crackdown on
illegal immigration closer to the Pacific Ocean.</LD>
<LD>   Key elements of the federal government's new strategy include
deployment of hovercraft and horseback units to patrol the All
American Canal; stepped-up helicopter surveillance; extended testing
of nonlethal pepper ball launchers, and installation of six "rescue
beacons" in the desert outside Yuma, Ariz.</LD>
<TE>   The beacons are 30-foot-tall towers designed to emit a distress
signal and capped with a strobe light that can be spotted five miles
away.</TE>
<TE>   A metal plate posted at the base advises migrants in English and
Spanish: "If you need help, push red button. U.S. Border Patrol will
arrive in 1 hour. Do not leave this location."</TE>
<TE>   Many measures will target the Imperial Valley, a region
crisscrossed by irrigation waterways including the swift-moving All
American Canal, where 17 people have drowned since Oct. 1.</TE>
<TE>   The systems were announced by INS Commissioner James Ziglar during
a tour of U.S. Border Patrol operations in Tucson and Yuma, and
Calexico and San Ysidro in California.</TE>
<TE>   "These latest steps represent a major breakthrough in the ongoing
effort to make the southern border safer for the people of both
nations," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Ziglar also announced an unprecedented agreement between the
United States and Mexico to establish an "intelligence cell" in the
El Centro area with a mission of helping identify, arrest and
prosecute migrant smugglers on both sides of the border.</TE>
<TE>   "We are particularly excited about the joint resolve to combat
migrant smuggling," Ziglar said. "Those who put migrants' lives in
harm's way should be on notice that we will not allow the border to
be a barrier to justice."</TE>
<TE>   The new measures aim to meet the needs of the border patrol at the
outset of the busiest season for rescues. The efforts focus on areas
where migrant deaths and rescues remain relatively high, compared to
other border locales where casualty rates have been declining.</TE>
<TE>   For example, the most frequent cause of death in the Imperial
Valley's El Centro area is not heat, but drowning in the 80-mile-long
All American Canal.</TE>
<TE>   "It can look awfully placid and cool on a hot day," said INS
spokeswoman Virginia Kice. "But even powerful swimmers have trouble
negotiating its fierce undertow, and its banks are made of cement and
slippery."</TE>
<TE>   The pepper ball launchers, which will allow officers to respond to
rock-throwing migrants with nonlethal force, will be dispatched to
Border Patrol forces in Tucson and El Centro.</TE>
<TE>   In the San Diego sector, where the devices were introduced last
July, they have been deployed on 28 occasions, and discharged eight
times. In all cases, the incidents ended without injury to agents or
migrants, authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   Ziglar said five additional helicopters--some capable of carrying
up to nine people--and eight pilots will be dispatched along the
border between Tucson and El Centro on a temporary basis beginning in
June.</TE>
<TE>   They will arrive, however, at a time when immigration officials
are crediting tougher security tactics for a sharp decline in the
number of people being detained while trying to cross the U.S.-Mexico
border illegally.</TE>
<TE>   From Oct. 1 to April 28, the Border Patrol caught 518,812 people
trying to cross the 2,000-mile-long international line, immigration
authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   That is a 34% drop from the same period the year before, when
786,099 were caught. It was the largest decline in eight years.</TE>

<HD>Priest Pleads Guilty to Sexual Abuse</HD>
<DH>Crime: Jesuit, 80, admits to molesting a mentally disabled
worker at a church facility in the 1990s. Sentencing is set for June
28.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GLENN F. BUNTING</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An 80-year-old Catholic priest pleaded guilty Thursday to sexually
abusing a mentally disabled man during the 1990s at a Jesuit retreat
overlooking the Santa Clara Valley.</LD>
<LD>   Father Edward Thomas Burke faces a maximum three years in state
prison for molesting a 50-year-old former kitchen worker at the
Sacred Heart Jesuit Center in Los Gatos.</LD>
<LD>   Burke is the second Jesuit at Sacred Heart to be prosecuted for a
felony sex crime. Brother Charles Leonard Connor, also 80, served six
months of home detention last year after being convicted of
committing a lewd act on a disabled adult.</LD>
<TE>   Connor and Burke are among four Jesuits accused in a lawsuit of
repeatedly sodomizing and molesting two mentally retarded workers who
still live at the facility. Attorneys for the two plaintiffs, who are
seeking more than $10 million in damages, are continuing to negotiate
a financial settlement with the California Province of the Society of
Jesus, commonly known as the Jesuits.</TE>
<TE>   The claims against Burke came to the attention of law enforcement
following a March 24 story in The Times, which disclosed that four
Jesuits were registered sex offenders in Northern California.
Documents show that some Jesuit leaders declined to notify
authorities when they learned of the allegations against Connor and
Burke. Jesuit superiors quickly transferred Burke in April 2000 when
he admitted to sexual misconduct with one of the men, documents show.</TE>
<TE>   Burke, who was not reported to police, moved to the Jesuit residence at
Bellarmine College Preparatory, an all-boys high school in San Jose.  He
now lives at a nursing home in San Jose.</TE>
<TE>   The guilty plea, which was entered with no conditions
attached, came at a routine arraignment hearing before prosecutors
were required to present their case. Burke's attorney, Charles
Hendrickson, said his client hopes that Superior Court Judge Kevin
Murphy will consider the priest's age, declining health and early
plea at his sentencing June 28.</TE>
<TE>   The victim, identified in court papers as James Doe, and
his family members are entitled to appear at the sentencing hearing.
Debra Sullivan, the victim's sister, has said she wants to see Burke
go to jail. Sullivan said her family was betrayed by Burke, who spent
hours alone with the victim by posing as his friend.</TE>
<TE>   Burke's punishment could range from probation and electronic
monitoring to a reduced incarceration in county jail.</TE>
<TE>   "We will look at all of the evidence in the case and decide what
we think the proper sentence should be," said Deputy Dist. Atty. Ben
Field. "That includes the defendant's age and the fact that he has
lived a long life with no known criminal offenses. But it also
includes some facts that weigh heavily against him.... He was in a
position of trust and the person he sexually abused happened to be
extremely vulnerable."</TE>
<TE>   Lawyers representing the two plaintiffs in the civil suit said
Burke's plea would work in their clients' favor.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a slam-dunk," said Robert L. Mezzetti II. "Their civil
litigation is over as far as Father Burke goes. There is no more
claiming it didn't happen or it was somebody else's fault."'</TE>
<TE>   If no settlement is reached, the civil suit is scheduled to go to
trial Oct. 15.</TE>

<HD>Bill Bans Dietary Aids for Minors</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAN MORAIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>SACRAMENTO -- The Senate voted Thursday to ban the sale to minors of
widely available dietary supplements including creatine,
androstenedion and the stimulant herbal ephedrine, sending the bill
to the Assembly where similar legislation has stalled.</LD>
<LD>   Sen. Jackie Speier (D-Hillsborough), who is carrying the bill,
SB1750, won Senate approval of similar legislation last year, but it
stalled in the Assembly Appropriations Committee.</LD>
<LD>   This year, Speier is one of three Democrats pushing bills to crack
down on the largely unregulated niche of the dietary supplement
industry that markets hormones, stimulants and other herbal
concoctions to people who want to lose weight, bulk up their muscles
or enhance their athletic ability.</LD>
<TE>   Urging support for her measure, Speier noted that the Olympics,
NCAA and National Football League all ban at least some of the
products, but that there is no such prohibition on their use by high
school-age athletes.</TE>
<TE>   The bill also would require that manufacturers place more
prominent warning labels on such products and include a toll-free
phone number to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration so consumers
could report adverse reactions.</TE>
<TE>   Opponents include several industry trade groups representing
manufacturers of largely unregulated dietary supplements, as well as
the United Food and Commercial Workers union, which fears that retail
clerks would be subject to discipline for failing to check consumers'
ages.</TE>
<TE>   The Senate approved the measure on a 27-8 vote without debate.
Several Republicans opposed it, contending that the federal
government should take the lead in regulating such products, the
argument made by Gov. Gray Davis when he vetoed related legislation
in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   "The fact is, the federal government hasn't acted," said Sen. Rico
Oller of San Andreas, one of a handful of Republicans who backed the
bill. He added that he believes herbal ephedrine, contained in
products marketed to people hoping to lose weight or enhance their
athletic ability, "is a serious problem, particularly for young girls
who want to lose weight."</TE>

<HD>Oracle Affair Gets Even More Messy</HD>
<DH>Investigation: In testimony before panel, suspended Davis
official says Baheti threatened vendor who donated money to
Republicans.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAN MORAIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Gov. Gray Davis' chief of information technology charged Thursday
that an administration rival boasted about his sway with Davis, and
once made a threatening call to a high-tech executive who made a
campaign donation to a Republican gubernatorial candidate.</LD>
<LD>   Elias Cortez, director of the Department of Information
Technology, became so emotional in his testimony before the Joint
Legislative Audit Committee that at one point Thursday the
proceedings were stopped so he could compose himself.</LD>
<LD>   Cortez said he was cut out of the final decision on the
$95-million Oracle software-licensing contract, which was awarded one
year ago without competitive bids and has been the focus of intense
scrutiny and criticism this spring.</LD>
<TE>   The contract was touted as a way for the state to save more than
$100 million on its software purchases, but an audit in April
concluded it would cost the state $41 million instead, even with the
"savings."</TE>
<TE>   Cortez also said he has been "abandoned" by the administration
since Davis suspended him--with pay, at his annual salary of
$120,000--on May 2.</TE>
<TE>   But his most dramatic remarks concerned the role of Arun Baheti,
Davis' former director of e-government.</TE>
<TE>   Baheti resigned this month after acknowledging that shortly after
the Oracle contract was signed last May 31 he met a lobbyist for the
software maker at a Sacramento restaurant and bar and accepted a
$25,000 campaign donation on Davis' behalf.</TE>
<TE>   Although taking the money was not illegal, it violated the
Democratic governor's policy prohibiting government aides from
engaging in campaign work.</TE>
<TE>   Since then--including during testimony before the legislative
committee--Baheti and administration officials have portrayed the
exchange with the lobbyist as an isolated mistake and have said the
lucrative Oracle contract was not related to the campaign
contribution.</TE>
<TE>   Cortez painted a different picture. He said an associate in the
high-tech industry told him that Baheti had telephoned the associate
to complain after the man's company contributed money to a Republican
candidate for governor.</TE>
<TE>   Assemblyman Dean Florez (D-Shafter), chairman of the Joint
Legislative Audit Committee, asked: "Is it true that Mr. Baheti
questioned a software vendor about contributions that vendor made to
the Richard Riordan campaign? Are you aware of that?"</TE>
<TE>   "Yes, sir," Cortez replied.</TE>
<TE>   Cortez noted that he had worked for five weeks at Oracle earlier
in his career, and that one of his former supervisors at Oracle was
working for a firm in San Jose when Baheti called.</TE>
<TE>   "This is such a small world, the technology world," Cortez said.
"That same boss happened to be a marketing director for a corporation
here in San Jose. He told me in confidence that he got a strange call
from Arun, about, 'Who's side are you on?' I was shocked. He asked
me, 'Don't take it anywhere. Just, you need to know that.' This was
the kind of mode of operation this person [Baheti] has."</TE>
<TE>   In later testimony, Cortez said he wasn't sure whether the former
supervisor had referred to a donation to former Los Angeles Mayor
Riordan, a failed GOP candidate for governor this year, or to some
other Republican running for governor. Cortez did not reveal his
former boss' name or identify the company where he worked.</TE>
<TE>   Baheti said in a phone interview that he was "blown away" by
Cortez's statement.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm trying to imagine myself making such a call," Baheti said.
"Let's put it this way, based upon the clear inconsistencies each
time Cortez testifies, it's clear that Cortez's veracity is in doubt.
Before this is over, I'll be responsible for Jimmy Hoffa's
disappearance."</TE>
<TE>   When Florez asked Cortez whether he felt he was being used as a
scapegoat by the administration, Cortez became too emotional to
testify, and took a lengthy break.</TE>
<TE>   Upon his return, he gave a rambling answer, prompting
Assemblywoman Rebecca Cohn (D-Saratoga) to complain, "Seems like the
witness has strayed from the question."</TE>
<TE>   "My reputation in the industry has been speared," Cortez said. "I
am being held accountable for other people's mistakes."</TE>
<TE>   Some committee members were skeptical of Cortez's testimony. "He's
pointing fingers in everybody's direction but his own," said Sen.

<HD>State Nature Agency Votes to Buy Wetlands</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE CHAWKINS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A state conservation agency Thursday approved the purchase of 265
marshy acres on the fringes of Oxnard, providing a key link in what
is to be Southern California's biggest wetlands restoration.</LD>
<LD>   Effectively barring development on a portion of Ormond Beach, the
unanimous vote by the board of the Coastal Conservancy scuttled plans
by the Occidental Petroleum Corp. for a $250-million energy facility
on the site.</LD>
<LD>   The $9.7-million purchase from Southern California Edison must be
approved by the state Public Works Board before the deal can be
closed. If the land is acquired--an action that by contract must
occur no later than June 14--it would lie at the heart of a planned
4,000-acre wetland preserve stretching nine miles from Port Hueneme
to Point Mugu.</LD>
<TE>   "It's the most important wetlands restoration opportunity in
Southern California," said Dick Wayman, a spokesman for the
conservancy. "Restoring and uniting all these wetlands would offer a
tremendous habitat to a variety of wildlife."</TE>
<TE>   The decision elated local officials, as well as activists who had
long fought to save the beach and its endangered seabirds. Bordered
by a power plant and the slag heaps of an aluminum recycling
facility, Ormond Beach has been eyed over the years for subdivisions,
industrial sites, even an amusement park.</TE>
<TE>   Occidental's liquefied natural gas plant would have serviced many
of the 14 power plants under construction throughout California.
Tankers would have docked at a pier that would have been built 4,000
feet offshore and pumped liquid through underwater pipes to the
plant, which would have converted it to gas and shot it into
pipelines spanning the state.</TE>
<TE>   While Occidental was waiting in the wings, the state was first in
line for the purchase, under a contract it signed with Edison in
1969.</TE>
<TE>   A longtime supporter of Ormond's restoration, county Supervisor
John Flynn applauded the conservancy's action.</TE>

<HD>Thomas Murphy, 61; Career Cop Briefly Led San Francisco
Police</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Thomas Murphy Jr., 61, who served as acting police chief of San
Francisco in 1992 at the end of a three-decade career on the force,
died Saturday at his home in San Francisco after a short battle with
cancer.</LD>
<LD>   A native of San Francisco, Murphy earned a bachelor's degree at
Sacramento State University and, later in his career, a master's
degree in public administration from USC.</LD>
<LD>   Murphy joined the San Francisco police force after graduating from
Sacramento State.</LD>
<TE>   He started as a patrol officer, became interested in evidence
gathering, and later headed the latent fingerprint unit, the crime
lab and crime scene investigation unit.</TE>
<TE>   He was promoted to lieutenant in 1984 and captain four years
later. He became a deputy chief in 1990. In 1992, he served for six
months as acting chief after his predecessor, the controversial
Richard Hongisto, was fired by the city's police commission.</TE>
<TE>   He retired in November 1992, after being passed over for the
position by Mayor Frank Jordan--himself a former police chief--who
named Anthony Ribera to the post.</TE>

<HD>Davis Asks PUC to Renew '20/20' Energy-Saving Plan</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Gov. Gray Davis recommended Thursday that the Public Utilities
Commission renew the "20/20" energy conservation program that allows
customers of the state's three largest utilities to trim 20% off
their electricity bills.</LD>
<LD>   To be eligible, customers of Southern California Edison and
Pacific Gas &amp; Electric would have to use 20% less power between July
1 and Oct. 31 than they did during the same period in 2000. San Diego
Gas &amp; Electric customers would have to use 15% less.</LD>
<LD>   "California's energy challenge is not over," Davis said. "The
energy market is not yet stabilized, the West's growth is putting
more strain on our regional power grid, and there's always a chance
it will be an unusually hot summer."</LD>
<TE>   The program, initiated last year, was credited with helping to
keep last summer's peak loads below critical levels.</TE>
<TE>   This year's program would differ in two ways. Last year,
commercial and industrial customers were eligible; this year, only
residential users are. And last year, the program ran from June 1
through Sept. 30; now it's a month later.</TE>
<TE>   The Public Utilities Commission is expected to act on Davis'
recommendation at its June 6 meeting.</TE>

<HD>Per-Pupil Spending Rises but Still Lags U.S. Average</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CLAIRE LUNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>California's per-student spending jumped from the previous year,
although it still lags behind the national average, according to
census figures from 2000 released Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   The state spent $6,298 per elementary and secondary school pupil
during that school year, a jump of 8.7% from the previous year.</LD>
<LD>   Now ranked 29th, California had fluttered in the low- to mid-30s
during the previous five years. New Jersey, New York and Washington,
D.C., continue to lead the country, with the national average rising
5.8% since the previous year.</LD>
<TE>   A California Department of Education official said the numbers
don't reflect either of the state's annual reports. Different
organizations' definitions of attendance and enrollment can
fluctuate, altering figures by as much as $500 per student, said
Gerry Shelton, the department's administrator of fiscal policy.</TE>
<TE>   The census numbers use adjusted data that the state submitted to
the National Center for Education Statistics, Shelton said. According
to the center's Web site, California's per-pupil expenditure for the
1999-2000 school year was estimated at $5,832, ranking the state 37th
in the country.</TE>
<TE>   "The one thing that is clear is that per-pupil spending has been
increasing," he said. "To the extent that quality of education is
tied to the amount of spending, these numbers are one way to show how
committed the governor and Legislature are to ratcheting up the level
of instruction and education that students are exposed to."</TE>
<TE>   School lobbyists said that although the numbers are outdated, at
least they indicate a positive trend.</TE>
<TE>   "My sense if that the numbers tend to be tracking reality this
time," said Bob Blattner, director of legislative figures for School
Services of California, a public schools consulting firm. "That said,
the numbers are so old that it's just sort of a nice benchmark and
nothing to derive policy from."</TE>
<TE>   The increased spending shows more commitment to lowering class
sizes and hiring additional teachers, said David A. Sanchez,
secretary-treasurer of the California Teachers Assn.</TE>
<TE>   "It's kind of old data, but it shows we're finally realizing that
if you want good schools, you're going to have to pay for it," he
said. "We'll have to wait for additional data and check what happens
with the state budget to see if we're still going in the right
direction."</TE>
<TE>   Despite tough economic times, the budget will reflect Gov. Davis'
commitment to education, said his spokeswoman, Hilary McLean.
However, lobbyist Blattner said he doesn't expect spending to
continue its annual increases.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not reasonable to expect the salad days of the last few
years to continue for schools when the rest of the state is hurting,"
he said.</TE>

<HD>Stricken Sub Towed Into Port</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TONY PERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>The research submarine Dolphin, damaged by fire and flooding, was
towed into port Thursday amid concern that naval research projects
might have to be curtailed if the one-of-a-kind ship is a total loss
or needs lengthy repairs.</LD>
<LD>   Navy officials had not yet opened the hatches to see how badly
damaged the vessel is from a Wednesday morning incident in heavy seas
100 miles from San Diego. If the fire spread to the boat's massive
batteries, toxic chlorine could have spread quickly, posing a severe
threat to sailors and the ship, officials said.</LD>
<LD>   The 165-foot, 950-ton submarine was towed back to San Diego by a
seagoing tug and escorted by the guided-missile frigate Thach.</LD>
<TE>   Retired Vice Adm. Bernard Kauderer, former commander of the
Pacific and Atlantic submarine fleets, said the loss of the Dolphin,
even if only for a few months, could hurt numerous research projects.</TE>
<TE>   Commissioned in 1968, the Dolphin, the Navy's oldest and only
diesel submarine, is used as a "platform" for innovations in sonar,
acoustics, weaponry and communications as well as for undersea
mapping.</TE>
<TE>   The attack submarine fleet, reduced by nearly 50% since the end of
the Cold War, is stretched too thin to allow one of its submarines to
be converted for research, Kauderer said. Also, alone among Navy
ships, submarines are dismantled when decommissioned. So there are no
subs that can be pressed back into service.</TE>
<TE>   "This will have a significant impact if we lose the Dolphin,"
Kauderer said.</TE>
<TE>   Tom Lapuza, spokesman for the Space and Naval Warfare System
Command in San Diego, agreed with that assessment. "I can't see us
taking a submarine off war patrol to take over for the Dolphin," he
said. The fire broke out as the Dolphin was on the surface in 10-foot
seas, participating in a multi-ship experiment involving torpedoes.
Officials believe that seawater may have leaked into one of the top
hatches, causing an electrical short.</TE>
<TE>   Sailors fought the fire for nearly three hours before the ship's
skipper gave the rarely heard order to abandon ship about 2 a.m.
"It's the kind of thing you do in war, not in peacetime in the waters
off your home port," Kauderer said.</TE>
<TE>   Forty-one sailors were evacuated from the submarine and two
scientists were plucked from the choppy seas nearby. Dolphin crew
members, wearing life jackets, were forced to jump into the water and
swim toward the rescue boat launched by the Thach. If the boat had
come too close to the submarine, it would have risked smashing into
its side.</TE>
<TE>   Two sailors were rescued by a Coast Guard helicopter as they began
to drift away into the darkness. The other 41 crew members were
pulled aboard the rescue boat and taken to the William McGaw,
operated by the U.S. Geological Survey.</TE>
<TE>   "Forty-three guys went into the water, and 43 guys got saved,"
said Lt. Cmdr. Mark Ryan, pilot of the helicopter, which had been
dispatched from San Diego shortly after midnight. "We're all pretty
stoked. This is not a scenario we train for much."</TE>

<HD>Alexandru Todea, 89; Eastern Rite Cardinal Resisted
Communism</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>BUCHAREST, Romania</DL>
<LD>Cardinal Alexandru Todea, who became a symbol of Catholic resistance
for spending more than 14 years in communist prisons after refusing
to give up his religion, has died. He was 89.</LD>
<LD>   Todea died Tuesday in a hospital in the Transylvanian city of
Targu Mures, the Eastern Rite Catholic Church said Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   Pope John Paul II sent a telegram of sympathy, recalling Todea's
faith under the former "tyrannical regime."</LD>
<TE>   In 1948, the communist state banned the Eastern Rite Catholic
Church and declared all priests who refused to give up their religion
enemies of the state. Eastern Rite Catholics follow the Eastern
Orthodox ritual, but the church's authority is in Rome. Almost 90% of
Romania's 23 million people are Eastern Orthodox and about 1% are
Eastern Rite Catholics.</TE>
<TE>   Todea's ordeal began in 1946 when the communist regime, which came
to power after World War II, imprisoned hundreds of thousands of
priests, intellectuals and politicians deemed to be "dangerous and
impossible to convert to communist ideals."</TE>
<TE>   Between 1946 and 1948, Todea was imprisoned and released five
times by the Securitate, the communist secret police.</TE>
<TE>   After his arrest in 1948, Todea escaped from prison and remained
in hiding for three years. During those years he was secretly made a
bishop.</TE>
<TE>   Todea was caught in 1951 and sentenced to life in prison. He was
released 12 years later, when communist leader Gheorghe Gheorghiu-Dej
granted amnesty to political prisoners.</TE>
<TE>   After his release, Todea continued to fight for religious freedom,
writing more than 30 petitions to communist authorities.</TE>
<TE>   At a secret meeting in 1986, the church's bishops elected Todea
leader of the church, giving him the rank of Metropolitan.</TE>
<TE>   After the collapse of communism in Romania in 1989, the church was
recognized by the state. In 1990, the pope recognized Todea as the
leader of the Romanian Eastern Rite Church. A year later, the Vatican
gave Todea the rank of cardinal.</TE>
<TE>   Todea retired from the executive leadership of the church in 1992
after suffering a stroke.</TE>
<TE>   Born in the Transylvanian village of Teleac, Todea studied
theology in Rome and was ordained as a priest in 1939. A year later,
he received a doctorate in theology at a Catholic university, also in
Rome. He returned to Romania in 1940 as a priest and a teacher of
Latin and Italian.</TE>
<TE>   A funeral service was scheduled for Tuesday at the Metropolitan
Cathedral in Blaj, 185 miles northwest of Bucharest.</TE>

<HD>Former O.C. Priest Is Charged Again</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WILLIAM LOBDELL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Roman Catholic priest, convicted of child molestation in the
Midwest before being transferred to Orange County in 1976, was
charged Wednesday in Milwaukee with nine new felony counts involving
sexual abuse of three minors in the early 1970s.</LD>
<LD>   According to court records filed by the Milwaukee district
attorney's office, Father Siegfried Widera also took one of the
victims on an 11-week car trip from Wisconsin to his new job in the
Diocese of Orange, though none of the charges involve that journey.</LD>
<LD>   It's not known whether the priest, who now lives in Arizona, has
been arrested. Neither authorities nor Widera, 61, could be reached
for comment Thursday.</LD>
<TE>   Orange Bishop William Johnson accepted Widera despite a warning
letter from Milwaukee Archbishop William Cousins that the priest had
a "moral problem having to do with a boy in school." Johnson and
Cousins are deceased.</TE>
<TE>   In Milwaukee, Widera was convicted of sexual misconduct with an
adolescent boy in 1973 and sentenced to three years' probation. He
also was ordered by his archbishop to undergo counseling.</TE>
<TE>   The latest charges allege incidents that took place from 1970 to
1973 involving 9- to 12-year-old boys. According to documents, some
of the assaults took place in the priest's van, in a rectory and in a
parochial school locker room. Each of the nine counts carries a
maximum sentence of 10 years in prison.</TE>
<TE>   "The only word for this is appalling," said Maria Schinderle,
Orange diocese spokeswoman, who believes that Johnson was never told
about Widera's actual criminal record. "I just wish we would have
known about this in 1976. Our heart goes out to the victims."</TE>
<TE>   The district attorney's office said it was allowed to file the
criminal complaint after more than 25 years because the clock on the
statute of limitations stopped in 1976 when Widera left Wisconsin.</TE>
<TE>   Widera was stripped of his ability to function as a priest in
1986, shortly after another boy's mother complained to the Orange
diocese. Widera was sent to a New Mexico treatment center for eight
months. He has not been defrocked; he still is considered a priest.</TE>
<TE>   This month, a 25-year-old Orange man who was the subject of the
1986 complaint filed suit against the Milwaukee and Orange dioceses.
He alleged that the two bishops conspired to move Widera to Orange
County, where he is accused of sexually abusing at least four more
minors.</TE>

<HD>Nurses Win Concessions in Talks With UC</HD>
<DH>Labor: Negotiators for hospital system drop merit raise
proposal, yield on mandatory overtime. But unresolved issues may yet
lead to one-day walkout.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LIZ F. KAY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Days before a planned one-day nurses' strike, University of
California negotiators said Thursday that they had yielded to union
demands to drop a proposed merit-based compensation system and given
the union until 4 p.m. today to accept it.</LD>
<LD>   But negotiations as of late Thursday had not resolved the labor
dispute that could lead to the first nurses' strike against UC's
six-hospital system, and UC officials threatened to take legal action
to stop Wednesday's walkout.</LD>
<LD>   The California Nurses Assn. did not accept the compromise of
dropping merit raises. UC spokesman Paul Schwartz said that if the
offer isn't accepted by today's deadline, it will be withdrawn.</LD>
<TE>   In UC's proposal, sent to the union on Wednesday, university
officials agreed to move immediately to a system of automatic pay
increases based on seniority. They retained the right to give
one-time, lump-sum bonuses to employees to reward performance,
however.</TE>
<TE>   "To change the compensation system of a university is quite an
accomplishment," said Rose Ann DeMoro, executive director of the
nurses association, which represents 8,000 nurses at UC's hospitals
throughout the state.</TE>
<TE>   Other issues also remain unresolved.</TE>
<TE>   UC agreed to restrict mandatory overtime or on-call duty to
emergency situations or those with other special circumstances, such
as a long surgery. Under the old contract, which expired May 1,
nurses were expected to work overtime whenever assigned to do so. The
union wants to restrict mandatory overtime to governor-declared
emergencies or disasters.</TE>
<TE>   The university system also refused to meet nurses' demands for
minimum nurse-to-patient ratios. Schwartz said it would be
inappropriate to establish minimum staffing until regulations
implementing the state's own legally mandated ratios are established.
UC argues that it cannot maintain the union's stricter ratios because
of a pressing nursing shortage.</TE>
<TE>   UC officials said Thursday that they are trying to secure a
temporary restraining order against the union to prevent nurses from
striking next week. UC officials allege that a strike would be
illegal because the union has not exhausted all negotiating
procedures.</TE>
<TE>   Schwartz said the lawyers will file a motion with the Public
Employment Relations Board by Friday. The board will review the
motion and decide whether to send it to a court for review.</TE>
<TE>   UC's six hospitals, meanwhile, prepared to reduce patient loads
and hire additional temporary nursing staff for Wednesday's 24-hour
strike. Nurse supervisors and medical residents also would be called
upon to fill in.</TE>
<TE>   Plans include turning away transfer patients from other hospitals,
canceling elective or nonemergency surgeries and diverting less
urgent patients to other emergency rooms. Trauma centers and
emergency rooms are expected to remain open, however.</TE>
<TE>   UCLA Medical Center, for example, has already begun limiting
transfers to its neonatal and pediatric intensive care units.</TE>
<TE>   UC Irvine has canceled outpatient procedures and may cancel some
surgeries as well to get down to a manageable population of 180
patients, a spokeswoman said.</TE>

<HD>O.C. May Vote on Sewage Waiver</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STANLEY ALLISON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Orange County Sanitation District is considering a November
ballot measure that would ask voters whether the agency should
continue dumping partly treated sewage from an outfall four miles off
the Huntington Beach coast.</LD>
<LD>   The sanitation district has a special waiver from the EPA that
allows it to do less treatment of sewage than most other districts in
the country.</LD>
<LD>   Supporters said the nonbinding referendum would help the agency
decide whether to ask the EPA to extend the waiver.</LD>
<TE>   Eight Orange County cities have come out against extension of the
waiver, fearing the partly treated sewage is polluting the ocean and
could be a cause of the high bacteria levels that have periodically
closed beaches in the last few years.</TE>
<TE>   Sanitation district officials said there is no evidence sewage
from the outfall is polluting the beaches. Ending the waiver, they
added, would force the agency to spend $400 million for new sewage
treatment facilities.</TE>
<TE>   The ballot measure idea has already won some support among
sanitation board members.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's a great idea," said Placentia Councilman Norman Z.
Eckenrode, who sits on the board. "We'll be able to get a reading
from the voters as to what position we should take."</TE>
<TE>   Critics, however, fear the campaign would focus on how sewer rates
might rise if the waiver isn't renewed.</TE>
<TE>   "They've got the money to spin it any way they want," Huntington
Beach Mayor Debbie Cook said. "And you can bet that's what they'll
do. They'll tell people their [sanitation] rates will double or
triple."</TE>
<TE>   Sanitation officials are now examining how a ballot measure would
be worded and the process for placing it on the ballot. Their
findings will be presented to a steering committee June 26.</TE>
<TE>   The federal waiver, which is up for renewal next year, allows the
agency to treat half of the waste water it pumps into the ocean at
levels less than those adopted by most of the nation's 16,000
sanitation districts.</TE>
<TE>   Some environmentalists complained that putting the issue before
voters is designed to give political cover to the board.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the directors are abrogating their responsibility to make
a decision," said Jan Vandersloot of the Ocean Outfall Group.
"They're looking for an excuse for not having to make the decision."</TE>

<LD>A change in the status of U.S. Olympic Committee President Sandra
Baldwin could bring a renewal in efforts by the Los Angeles bid
committee to bring the Summer Olympics to L.A. in 2012.</LD>
<LD>   Last fall, the USOC chose New York, Houston, Washington and San
Francisco as semifinalists in the race to be the United States'
candidate before International Olympic Committee voters for the 2012
Games. The Los Angeles bid was eliminated and its committee
disbanded.</LD>
<LD>   But sources said Thursday that the Los Angeles committee had
evidence that it was Baldwin who was most influential in rejecting
the L.A. bid and that, were she no longer in office, a request to the
USOC to revisit the Los Angeles bid would be a consideration.</LD>
<TE>   The USOC will vote on its 2012 candidate in November, and the IOC
will vote on that Olympic site in 2005.</TE>

<HD>Martinez Doesn't Fear Yankees</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Pedro Martinez joked that after 83 seasons without a championship,
the Boston Red Sox might have a new ally.</LD>
<LD>   "Maybe the Bambino was looking out for me today. Would you believe
that?" he said after pitching the Red Sox to a 3-1 win over the New
York Yankees on Thursday night at Boston.</LD>
<LD>   "Babe Ruth was one of the greatest men for the community. I don't
think he would want to curse not even his worst enemy."</LD>
<TE>   Martinez won his seventh decision in a row to open the season,
matching last year's win total. His seventh win last season also came
against the Yankees, 3-0 on May 29 when he improved to 7-1 with his
first victory over them in more than a year. He showed little
tolerance for those who say "The Curse of the Bambino" kept the Red
Sox from winning the World Series.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't believe in curses," he said then. "Wake up the Bambino,
maybe I'll drill him."</TE>
<TE>   The Red Sox (31-13) lead the American League East by two games
over the Yankees (31-17). Boston has the AL's best record, while New
York lost the second spot to Seattle, which won Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Martinez struck out 10 in seven innings, giving up one run, four
hits and two walks.</TE>
<TE>   He started last season at 6-0 but finished 7-3 without a victory
after his comments about the Bambino. He was troubled for much of the
season by shoulder problems.</TE>
<TE>   Seattle 7, Tampa Bay 3--James Baldwin settled down after a rocky
first inning to shut down the Devil Rays at Seattle and help the
Mariners end a four-game losing streak.</TE>
<TE>   Ichiro Suzuki and Ruben Sierra had three hits apiece and John
Olerud hit a three-run homer for the Mariners, who broke out of a
slump with 11 hits. Seattle batted only .202 in the losing streak.</TE>
<TE>   The Devil Rays had won a season-high four games in a row.</TE>
<TE>   Baltimore 11, Oakland 3--Chris Singleton and Marty Cordova each
homered and drove in three runs as the Orioles beat up Mark Mulder at
Oakland.</TE>
<TE>   Singleton extended his season-high hitting streak to 12 games with
a three-run homer in the second inning off Mulder (2-4), who has lost
three in a row since returning from the disabled list after
recovering from a strain in his left forearm.</TE>
<TE>   Mulder, who won 21 games last year and finished second in Cy Young
Award voting, has given up 15 earned runs in 14 innings over his last
three starts.</TE>
<TE>   Texas at Kansas City--Thursday night's game between the Rangers
and Royals was rained out and will be made up as part of a
doubleheader on Sunday.</TE>

<HD>Good Can Be Bad for Washburn</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Chris Foster and Bill Shaikin</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The secret to pitcher Jarrod Washburn's recent success is simple:
He's not feeling as good.</LD>
<LD>   Washburn came out of spring training fit and bold, in contrast to
a year ago when he broke camp with strep throat. He began running his
low-90s fastball up to the plate, challenging batters to hit it.</LD>
<LD>   They did. After three starts, Washburn was 0-2 with a 6.00
earned-run average.</LD>
<TE>   "I just felt too good coming out of spring training," Washburn
said. "I had a little extra on my fastball and thought I could
overpower hitters."</TE>
<TE>   The Sandy Koufax syndrome has passed. Washburn is 4-0 with a 2.52
ERA in his last six starts. He has given up only two runs in the two
no-decisions.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm kind of a one-pitch pitcher," Washburn said. "I need to
change speeds with my fastball. I was able to get my fastball
consistently in the low 90s instead of just the couple times I needed
it that fast. I learned pretty quick that wasn't the way for me to go
about things."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Washburn has been the best of the Angels' promising trio in the
rotation, but Ramon Ortiz and Scott Schoeneweis also have been solid
in recent outings.</TE>
<TE>   Ortiz is 3-1 with a 3.60 ERA in his last four starts. Schoeneweis
is 2-1 with a 3.83 ERA in his last four starts.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels have a 3.85 team ERA. Boston (3.27) and New York (3.59)
are the only American League teams with lower ERAs.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Angels, increasingly concerned about the knee injury suffered
by shortstop David Eckstein, recalled triple-A shortstop Alfredo
Amezaga on Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Eckstein suffered a sprained left knee while sliding into first
base Monday. He did not play Tuesday or Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   While the Angels did not put Eckstein on the disabled list, which
would have required him to miss another 12 days, General Manager Bill
Stoneman said the move would provide "a few more days of rest" for
Eckstein.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels cleared roster space for Amezaga by optioning reliever
Mark Lukasiewicz to triple-A Salt Lake, leaving Dennis Cook as the
lone left-hander in the bullpen.</TE>
<TE>   Amezaga, 24, a brilliant defensive player regarded as the Angels'
shortstop of the future, hit .235 with no home runs, 10 stolen bases
and a .296 on-base percentage at Salt Lake. Benji Gil, the Angels'
veteran backup shortstop, is scheduled to start a rehabilitation
assignment at Salt Lake today and could replace Amezaga--or Eckstein,
if his condition does not improve--sometime next week.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Troy Percival gave up one run in the ninth Wednesday but earned
the save in a 7-6 victory over the Royals. It was the first run
allowed by Percival since he gave up three against Oakland on April
21.</TE>
<TE>   That was his only blown save this season and came in his first
appearance after a stint on the disabled list because of a strained
muscle in his right side.</TE>
<TE>   Percival did not give up a run in his next 10 appearances. He was
2-0 with five saves during that stretch.</TE>

<TE>   Records--Avengers 3-2, Force 1-4.</TE>
<TE>   Record vs. Force (2001)--0-2.</TE>
<TE>   Update--It's a good bet Robert Lyles had this game circled on his
calendar. But the former Avenger coach is now the former Force coach.
Lyles was fired Monday after the Force lost its fourth game in a row
after a season-opening win. The latest setback was a 70-62 loss to
Chicago last week. Marty Lowe, the offensive coordinator last year
when the franchise played in Nashville, was named interim coach.
Despite its record, the Force is in a three-way tie for second in the
Southern Division. Donnie Davis replaced Kevin McDougal at
quarterback in the second quarter last week and wound up throwing for
seven touchdowns. Lowe has not decided who will be the starter. The
Avengers, third in the Western Division after defeating Tampa Bay,
38-24, last week, are playing their fourth road game in five weeks.
The Avengers hope to get back receiver Chris Jackson, who missed the
last two games with a broken bone in the right wrist. Jackson, who
had his cast removed Monday, practiced this week and is listed as
questionable. Receiver Greg Hopkins has 19 catches for 244 yards and
five touchdowns in the last two games.</TE>

<HD>Griffey Will Rejoin Reds' Lineup Today</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Cincinnati Reds expect to activate Ken Griffey Jr. off the
disabled list today and put him in the lineup against the Atlanta
Braves. They cleared a roster spot by optioning shortstop Gookie
Dawkins to double-A Chattanooga after an 8-4 loss to Florida on
Thursday afternoon.</LD>
<LD>   The outfield has done very well without Griffey but is eager to
have him back.</LD>
<LD>   "Pitchers are scared to death of the guy, and they should be,"
left fielder Adam Dunn said. "When you're hitting behind him, you get
a lot more opportunities. When you're hitting ahead of him, you get a
lot more opportunities."</LD>
<TE>   Griffey's return gives Manager Bob Boone five players for four
positions--the three outfield spots and first base. First baseman
Sean Casey is hitting .292, and Dunn, Austin Kearns and Juan
Encarnacion have carried the offense.</TE>
<TE>   Since Kearns was promoted from the minors on April 17, the three
outfielders collectively have hit .297 with 19 homers and 64 runs
batted in in 34 games.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Philadelphia Manager Larry Bowa was suspended for three games and
fined an undisclosed amount for last week's run-in with umpire Tony
Randazzo.</TE>
<TE>   Bowa was punished for "arguing excessively and making
inappropriate comments" to Randazzo after a disputed call at home
plate in the eighth inning of a 12-9 loss at Arizona.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Arizona outfielder Danny Bautista will undergo surgery on his
injured left shoulder and will miss three months.... Former Yankee
pitcher David Cone was hired as an analyst for the team's cable
network.... The Yankees purchased the contract of pitcher Mike
Thurman from triple-A Columbus.</TE>

<LD>Ron Cook in the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette: "Have you noticed what's
happening to Mike Tyson these days? We can't keep our eyes off
him--again.</LD>
<LD>   "Shame on us, maybe, but hats off to Tyson's brilliant, if
demented mind. There never has been anyone like him when it comes to
capitalizing on our fascination with the bizarre.</LD>
<LD>   "Dennis Rodman comes to mind, but he wasn't in the same league,
all due respect to cross-dressers, tattooers, body-piercers and, of
course, Carmen Electra."</LD>
<TE>   Trivia time: Who holds the record for most points by a rookie in
an NBA playoff game?</TE>
<TE>   Great expectations: Jay Mariotti of the Chicago Sun-Times writes
that Mark Prior, the former USC pitcher now with the Cubs, "is a
savior with a resin bag," adding: "So immersed is Chicago in his
arrival, the real Anna Kournikova could do a strip tease on Oak
Street Beach and no one would notice. The city clearly has its
Prior-ities, as askew as they are."</TE>
<TE>   Prior was impressive in his debut Wednesday, striking out 10 in
six innings against Pittsburgh and getting the win in a 7-4 victory.</TE>
<TE>   Back to earth: Joe Paterno, Penn State football coach, when asked
how he rates himself among the greatest coaches of all time: "I
looked in the mirror one day and I said to my wife, 'How many great
coaches do you think there are?' She said, 'One less than you
think.'"</TE>
<TE>   Ego war: Jerry Greene in the Orlando Sentinel: "Did you see the
lineup for HBO's 'Inside the NFL?' You've got Bob Costas, Cris
Collinsworth, Dan Marino and now Cris Carter.</TE>
<TE>   "With this many egos on the same set, there may be more carnage
than on 'The Sopranos.'"</TE>
<TE>   More Greene: "Athletic Director Skip Bertman says he wants to stop
drunks from attending [Louisiana State] home football games. Well,
there goes that program."</TE>
<TE>   Failure route? Tom FitzGerald in the San Francisco Chronicle:
"Even if Chinese center Yao Ming is not the top pick in the NBA
draft, he should know that being the No. 2 pick in any pro draft is a
sure-fire path to riches and glory.</TE>
<TE>   "Why, look what it did for Ryan Leaf."</TE>
<TE>   Vicious: Jim Armstrong in the Denver Post: "Have you checked out
John Rocker's [earned-run average] lately? If it were anyone else,
you'd say he was getting his brains beat in."</TE>

<LD>Monique Marier beat UCLA with her bat and glove Thursday, leading
Florida State to a 2-1 upset of the top-seeded Bruins in the first
game of the Women's College World Series at Don Porter Hall of Fame
Stadium in Oklahoma City.</LD>
<LD>   Marier hit a solo home run, her ninth of the season, with two out
in the top of the ninth inning to give the Seminoles the lead.</LD>
<LD>   In the bottom of the ninth, the left fielder made a diving catch
of Stephanie Ramos' shallow fly ball with two out and runners on
second and third to preserve the victory.</LD>
<TE>   The eighth-seeded Seminoles' victory marked only the second time
the Series' top-seeded team has lost the opening game. In 1991,
Florida State was upset by UCLA, 1-0. Those Bruins lost to Arizona in
the title game.</TE>
<TE>   UCLA moves to the losers' bracket of the double-elimination
tournament and will face Oklahoma, which lost, 4-2, to California.</TE>
<TE>   The Bruins (54-8) had six hits against Florida State's Leslie
Malerich (34-12), who also walked nine batters. UCLA stranded 14
baserunners.</TE>
<TE>   "The bottom line is that we have to have confidence that we will
win on Saturday," Bruin Coach Sue Enquist said.</TE>
<TE>   UCLA scored in the bottom of the first inning, when Claire Sua's
two-out single drove in Natasha Watley, who had led off with a single
and stolen second.</TE>
<TE>   Florida State (54-18) tied it in the fourth. Brandi Stuart
singled, advanced to second on a sacrifice bunt, stole third and
scored when catcher Stacey Nuveman's throw sailed into left field,
one of three Bruin errors.</TE>
<TE>   Sophomore Keira Goerl (31-5) suffered the defeat. She gave up four
hits, walked one and had 12 strikeouts.</TE>
<TE>   The Bruins must win two games both Saturday and Sunday to advance
to the championship game Monday.</TE>

<LD>The Dodgers scored a season-high 16 runs, had a season-high 19 hits
and set a franchise single-game record with eight home runs in a 16-3
victory over the Milwaukee Brewers on Thursday, but the Arizona
Diamondbacks won't give them much time to enjoy it.</LD>
<LD>   The Dodgers play a three-game series in Bank One Ballpark and will
have to face two of baseball's best pitchers, Arizona's Curt
Schilling tonight and Randy Johnson on Sunday. The veterans are tied
for the National League lead in wins (eight) and are one-two in
strikeouts (202 combined).</LD>
<LD>   The Dodgers are 21/2 games behind the first-place Diamondbacks and
two games behind second-place San Francisco, and they go into their
first game against the defending World Series champions feeling as if
they have something to prove.</LD>
<TE>   "To me, the Diamondbacks and Giants feel the [division race] is
between them, and we're not in the picture," catcher Paul Lo Duca
said. "We have to let everyone know that we're here too. You look at
any sports highlight shows, and it's all Arizona and San Francisco.
We have to make our presence felt, let people know that we're going
to be there for a long haul."</TE>
<TE>   Thursday, they were there for the long ball. In addition to Shawn
Green's major league record-tying four homers, which traveled a
combined 1,640 feet, Brian Jordan hit a two-run homer in the second,
Hiram Bocachica hit a two-run homer in the eighth, Adrian Beltre hit
a two-run homer in the ninth, snapping a string of 127 at-bats
without a homer, and Dave Hansen hit a solo shot in the ninth.</TE>
<TE>   Beltre, Green and Bocachica went back-to-back-to-back in the
ninth, and Beltre's two-out blast gave Green a chance for No. 4.</TE>
<TE>   Remarkably, despite all the home runs, there wasn't so much as a
brushback pitch from Brewer starter Glendon Rusch, who gave up eight
runs and nine hits in 12/3 innings, and five Milwaukee relievers.</TE>
<TE>   "To be honest, coming up after three of Green's home runs, I
thought I'd get something inside," cleanup batter Eric Karros said.
"Never. It's one of those things where a pitcher made a mistake, what
good is it to throw at someone?</TE>
<TE>   "But by the same token, you know Dave Stewart is their pitching
coach, and his whole game as a pitcher was intimidation. If that was
the Giants, [Green] probably would have been drilled."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Despite giving up eight hits and walking six in 51/3 innings,
Dodger left-hander Kazuhisa Ishii gave up only two runs to gain the
victory and improve to 7-1. With the Dodgers leading, 3-1, in the
bottom of the first, the Brewers loaded the bases with one out, and
Ishii fell behind slugger Geoff Jenkins with two balls. Jenkins then
smashed a one-hopper to second baseman Mark Grudzielanek, who started
an inning-ending, 4-6-3 double play.</TE>

<HD>Santa Anita May Get Fair Dates</HD>

<AU>LANCE PUGMIRE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Pomona Fairplex President and Chief Executive James Henwood ended
months of negotiations Thursday when he formally proposed that the
17-day Los Angeles County Fair horse racing meet be moved to Santa
Anita Park in Arcadia.</LD>
<LD>   Roy Wood, executive director of the California Horse Racing Board,
approved Henwood's request to make the issue an agenda item at the
board's next meeting, June 6 at Bay Meadows Race Track in San Mateo.
If a majority of the seven CHRB members approves the proposal, horse
racing will end after 63 seasons at Fairplex and the "L.A. County
Fair Meet at Santa Anita" season will begin Sept. 13.</LD>
<LD>   "Santa Anita fills all our desires," Henwood wrote in his two-page
proposal letter to Wood. "It is a major and historic race venue....
It will allow the LACF to conduct turf racing, as well as racing on
the main track, will allow us to attract quality horses, improve our
stakes program and provide Southern California horsemen and race fans
a better racing experience than we could provide them at Fairplex."</LD>
<TE>   Henwood negotiated the deal with Santa Anita's Jack Liebau,
president of California operations for Magna Entertainment Corp.,
after negotiations for a similar facility lease arrangement collapsed
with Hollywood Park President Rick Baedeker in March.</TE>
<TE>   Terms of the deal are expected to be revealed at the board
meeting. Baedeker said he will oppose the move. So will Sherwood
Chillingworth, the executive vice president of the Oak Tree Racing
Assn. The Oak Tree meeting at Santa Anita runs Oct. 2-Nov. 5.</TE>
<TE>   "Basically, we will become a continuation of their meet,"
Chillingworth said. "To a great degree, we will have a different
betting population coming in. A meet lasting 17 days in front of ours
will certainly invade our betting pool. I'm also hearing they want to
run Breeders' Cup prep races. That will damage our stakes schedule."</TE>
<TE>   In a Fairplex release announcing the agreement with Santa Anita,
it was noted that racing industry organizations have long endorsed
racing on a one-mile track, including a turf course, in preparation
for Breeders' Cup races. This year's Breeders' Cup event is Oct. 26.
Next year's Breeders' Cup is at Santa Anita during the Oak Tree
meeting.</TE>
<TE>   Chillingworth could add powerful supporters to his argument. Craig
Fravel, executive vice president of the Del Mar Thoroughbred Club,
said his group has not determined its stance. Del Mar's meeting
immediately precedes Fairplex's. John Van de Kamp, president of the
Thoroughbred Owners of California, said his group is similarly
undecided. A conference call will be scheduled to finalize the
owners' stance before June 6.</TE>
<TE>   "There are some negatives to [the move]," Van de Kamp said.
"Instead of a 30-day stretch [with Oak Tree], it's a 50-day meet. Is
that too long? We were under the impression the move was going to be
to Hollywood Park, where the weather's cooler.</TE>
<TE>   "It is an asset to have a mile track and grass, but will the meet
stay fresh?"</TE>
<TE>   Fairplex Park, with a five-eighths mile dirt track and tight
turns, caters to second-tier jockeys and trainers during a season
horse racing's more notable figures usually reserve for vacations.
Last year, track attendance declined 2% from the 2000 season to
121,497, on-track wagering dipped 3% to $12,444,542.10 and
inter-track wagering dropped 5% to $53,260,173.20.</TE>
<TE>   Fairplex's sentimental charm will be part of the debate, according
to CHRB member Roger Licht.</TE>
<TE>   "My wife [Mary Lou] went to the races for the first time there,"
Licht said. "If I feel there's a compelling reason to move the meet,
I will vote for it, but one of the charters in horse racing law is to
promote fairs."</TE>
<TE>   Said CHRB member John Harris: "Pomona has a rich heritage and it
brings a unique atmosphere to racing. It's the only Southern
California fair with racing and it brings new fans into racing."</TE>
<TE>   Harris is the most likely board member to vote against the move.
He said leaving Fairplex Park will impact horsemen, fans, track
executives, vendors and unions.</TE>
<TE>   "We debated for six months if we should allow advertisements on
the [jockeys'] silks," he said. "My point is we need more time to
review this. A move like this needs to be very well debated."</TE>
<TE>   CHRB spokesman Mike Marten said the board will either vote on the
issue June 6 or agree to delay its vote to the July 25 meeting in Del
Mar. Henwood must submit an application to move the dates before June
15.</TE>
<TE>   Fairplex would continue to offer satellite wagering if the racing
moves.</TE>

<HD>Honda to Provide IRL With Engines</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE KUPPER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>INDIANAPOLIS</DL>
<LD>The Indianapolis 500, the cornerstone of Tony George's 7-year-old
Indy Racing League, lured another major player to the IRL Thursday
when Honda announced it would provide engines next year for the 500
and other IRL races.</LD>
<LD>   That means that IRL teams will have engines from four
manufacturers to choose from in 2003, General Motors and Nissan,
which have been supplying Oldsmobile/Chevrolet and Infiniti power
since IRL's birth in 1995; Toyota, which announced its involvement
last year and says it is well along in its development program, and
now Honda, which had announced last fall that it would no longer
supply engines to teams in CART, the open-wheel racing organization
from which George bolted.</LD>
<LD>   CART, which will change its engine specifications next season to
more closely match the IRL's, has a commitment from only one engine
manufacturer, MG, although Toyota has not ruled out building engines
for CART, as well as IRL. There has been no word from Ford, CART's
other current engine supplier.</LD>
<TE>   In a significant departure from tradition, apparently prompted by
the urgency of the move, Honda's IRL engine will be a joint project
with Ilmor Engineering, another longtime major player in open-wheel
racing. Ilmor has built racing engines for Chevrolet and
Mercedes-Benz, among other companies.</TE>
<TE>   The IRL, which struggled for respectability in its first few
seasons, appears now to have turned the corner on that. The 500,
boycotted by CART teams from 1996 through '99, has been luring them
back since 2000 and attendance for the race itself, if not for all of
the accompanying track activities in May, has returned to pre-1996
levels. George announced Thursday, after first denying it, that next
year the IRL would venture outside the U.S., racing at Twin Ring
Motegi, an oval north of Tokyo where CART has raced for several
seasons.</TE>

<LD>Three horses trying to reclaim past glory are among the five horses
who will contest tonight's feature, a $62,000 allowance at 1 1/16
miles, at Hollywood Park.</LD>
<LD>   Futural, Momentum and Out Of Mind will be trying for their first
win of 2002 when they take on longshot Truly A Judge and Pie N
Burger.</LD>
<LD>   Best remembered for being disqualified on a controversial call in
the Hollywood Gold Cup last July 1, Futural has fallen on hard times
in the ensuing months. After finishing second in the San Diego
Handicap at Del Mar, he has not finished better than third in his
four most recent races.</LD>
<TE>   Trained by Craig Dollase, who will also be represented by
Momentum, Futural stretches out to a distance that has been kind to
him after finishing fourth as the 2-1 favorite going 7 1/2 furlongs
on May 1. He has won two of four at 1 1/16 miles and has also been
second and third.</TE>
<TE>   A 4-year-old son of Nureyev, Momentum hasn't been out since he was
vanned off the track after being pulled up in the Strub Stakes on
Feb. 2 at Santa Anita. In his lone dirt race at Hollywood Park, he
beat Euchre and six others in the Native Diver Handicap on Dec. 9.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday in Inglewood, Like A Hero, the 9-5 second choice, may
have earned himself a trip to the Belmont Stakes with a 1 1/2-length
win over 2-1 third choice World Light in the $77,200 Alydar Stakes.</TE>
<TE>   Trained by Beau Greely and owned by Andrea Pollack's Columbine
Stable, the 3-year-old Pleasant Colony colt completed the 1 1/8 miles
in 1:50 1/5 under jockey Laffit Pincay Jr. It was his third
consecutive win after he finished second in his debut.</TE>
<TE>   Azillion, the 7-5 favorite, proved his last-place finish in the
Blue Grass Stakes was no fluke as he finished last again in the field
of five. He trailed throughout under jockey Eddie Delahoussaye and
wound up 11 1/2 lengths behind Like A Hero.</TE>
<TE>   Race of the day: Class dropper Painted Avenue and recent winner
B.T. Gotrich are among 10 scheduled to run in tonight's sixth at
Hollywood Park, a $25,000 claimer at seven furlongs.</TE>
<TE>   Who's hot: Lynn Whiting. The trainer won with six of his first
eight starters at Churchill Downs.</TE>
<TE>   Who's not: Robert Barbara. The New York-based trainer started 2002
on a two-for-50 streak.</TE>
<TE>   Exotically speaking: A pick three using Icee Chesapeake and Class
Of Glass in the first, Coke's Tribute and Inwood in the second and
Public Domain and Taormina in the third.</TE>
<TE>   Winners: Previous day/meet total: 5/56. Money: Previous day/meet
total: $28.80/$319.40. Total money bet: $378.</TE>

<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>The Kings said their farewells to folksy Sacramento and prepared for
the inevitable culture shock upon their arrival Thursday afternoon in
Los Angeles. They said they were ready for whatever greets them
tonight in Game 3 of their Western Conference final series against
the Lakers at Staples Center.</LD>
<LD>   The Kings certainly didn't expect to be greeted warmly.</LD>
<LD>   "There's nothing I like about L.A.," said Bobby Jackson, a reserve
guard who has sparked the Kings in the first two games of the
best-of-seven series. "Everybody tries to be all Hollywood and
stuff."</LD>
<TE>   Added backup center Scot Pollard: "I don't go out much in L.A.
There are too many places you can get killed. There is one nice
restaurant in L.A., though. I'm not going to say which one it is
because I don't want to see anyone there."</TE>
<TE>   Not that the road has been unkind to the Kings during the
playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   They are 4-0, having taken two games apiece from the Utah Jazz and
Dallas Mavericks, although it was clear from the Kings that they
expected far more distractions in L.A.</TE>
<TE>   The Kings also expressed concern about the officiating, what with
the Lakers' steady stream of criticism of the referees in the wake of
Sacramento's 96-90 victory Monday in Game 2 that leveled the series
at a game apiece.</TE>
<TE>   "No doubt," power forward Chris Webber said when asked about the
impact the Lakers' complaints might have on the referees tonight.
"Two years ago, they cried about how we played an illegal defense. We
got four calls against us in the first quarter of Game 5 [of the
first-round series]."</TE>
<TE>   Webber almost had it right. In fact, the Kings had three illegal
defense calls against them, resulting in two technical fouls, en
route to a 113-86 loss to the Lakers in the deciding Game 5 on May 5,
2000.</TE>
<TE>   Webber has had his concerns about the refereeing in the first two
games of this series, saying, "I'm getting offensive calls against
[Robert] Horry. I'm frustrated about the charges. They've got three
men on me. I guess you always get the benefit of a doubt if you're
the smaller man. I don't see what they're crying about because I feel
like I've been in foul trouble this whole playoffs."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   So why are they the Kings of the road?</TE>
<TE>   "It feels good to be on the road," Webber said. "It feels good to
silence the crowd. I like playing on the road better sometimes than
playing at home. You're not supposed to do well on the road. It gives
you a little bit of a security blanket because you're the underdog on
the road."</TE>
<TE>   When it was pointed out to Webber that the Kings had a league-best
61-21 record during the regular season, including a 25-16 mark on the
road, he laughed.</TE>
<TE>   "Who's the underdog in this series in your eyes?" he asked. "It's
a position I relish. Hey, none of the teams that were expected to win
did this year. The Rams didn't win [the Super Bowl] and Duke didn't
win [the NCAA basketball title]."</TE>

<HD>Jackson, O'Neal Have Their Say</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tim Brown</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Rick Adelman, Sacramento's basketball coach, said this week the
Lakers are too good for their current preoccupation with the Game 2
officiating, an effort that had handfuls of Lakers in foul trouble,
Shaquille O'Neal included.</LD>
<LD>   In the NBA, of course, it is the losing team's duty to complain
about the referees and the winning team's obligation to wonder what
the other team could possibly be talking about. It must be in the
collective bargaining agreement.</LD>
<LD>   The Kings had their tantrum after Game 1, which was followed
immediately by 28 free throws being shot in the first half of Game 2
on Monday, 23 by the Kings.</LD>
<TE>   The Lakers--O'Neal, in particular--were aghast.</TE>
<TE>   Adelman called it "posturing," adding the Lakers are "Good
enough.... They shouldn't be worried about the refs."</TE>
<TE>   Relayed those thoughts, Laker Coach Phil Jackson grinned tightly.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know what that means," he said. "We are too good, I
guess. When Shaq's not on the floor, though, we don't look too good."</TE>
<TE>   Beyond that, Jackson refused to be drawn into the debate with
Adelman, whose quotes frequently suggest he doesn't like Jackson very
much.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal is the Lakers' focal point in nearly all of their
conversations with league officials regarding game officials, and the
Lakers did again speak to the league about Game 2.</TE>
<TE>   The critical issue is the number of offensive fouls O'Neal does or
does not commit.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm just going to keep playing, keep playing the way I play,"
O'Neal said. "We had a couple chances to win the game. You know, you
look at the history of the game, all the guys that have won rings
have won because of heart and desire. It would be unfortunate if they
let one get away.... Guys like that mess the game up. I don't let my
children watch that [stuff] anymore."</TE>
<TE>   The reference probably was to Vlade Divac and Scot Pollard, the
King centers, whom O'Neal frequently accuses of practicing flopping,
a defensive technique that O'Neal considers unmanly.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Considering Kobe Bryant's illness, it was not at all surprising to
see O'Neal become the Game 2 aggressor. He attempted 27 shots and
scored 35 points, this season's playoff high.</TE>
<TE>   Bryant does not yet appear to be fully healthy, so expect plenty
of offense from O'Neal again, especially if the Lakers are missing
their perimeter shots again.</TE>
<TE>   "Last game he was exploding to the hoop really well," Bryant said.
"I haven't seen that for a while, so that's very encouraging. We ride
him all the time. Just because he's not putting up 30 and 20, we ride
him nonetheless, because he draws so much attention."</TE>
<TE>   During the regular season, O'Neal frequently pulled Bryant aside
and told him if he were particularly gimpy. O'Neal played most of the
season on a painful arthritic toe. On those nights, Bryant was more
forceful with his offense.</TE>
<TE>   "We look out for each other like that," Bryant said.</TE>

<HD>Jackson's Confidence, Poise Rub Off on Team</HD>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I don't know Phil Jackson, other than maybe to have said hello and
shaken his hand once or twice. I do know that the more I watch and
the closer I look, the more I like.</LD>
<LD>   Jackson is a poker player holding a royal flush. When you have one
in your hand--and he has one in his hand every time that team takes
the floor--you play things close to the vest. You don't need to show
any signs of what you have, because you know you have a winner. He
has a terrific team, and the two best players in the game today, and
he is smart enough not to mess with it.</LD>
<LD>   When you have the talent, don't frustrate it. Encourage it.
Embrace it.</LD>
<TE>   The calm, poise and composure the Lakers have come from the bench.
You want the emotion where it belongs, with the players, out on the
floor. It isn't only Jackson on the bench, either. Take a look over
there sometime and check out the assistants. My accountant gets more
emotional than Frank Hamblen.</TE>
<TE>   From a fellow coach's standpoint, I see things that really tell a
tale. One of the biggest for me is that all five Laker players
Jackson has on the floor play defense. Not three or four. All five.</TE>
<TE>   I don't know what this Zen Master stuff is all about, but if you
watch closely, you'll see a master psychologist at work. Remember the
technical foul he got the other night in Game 2? That was a masterful
sympathy foul. Most of the time, Jackson is good at just leaving the
refs alone, so that when he does weigh in, and he does get a
technical, it is one with impact. The one he got in Sacramento was
his way of standing up and saying to Shaq, "Hey, big guy. I
understand what a beating you are taking and I don't think it's fair
either, and I support you."</TE>
<TE>   He's really good with that stuff, and he seems to be smart about
the refs. You aren't going to get anywhere long-term by badgering
them. Plus, Jackson is a big guy. He understands officiating
dynamics. When was the last time you saw a ref that was a former
center or power forward? They're all former fireplug point guards.
So, even though they don't do it consciously or maliciously, they
believe, in the deep recesses of their minds, that a guy like Shaq is
a giant and should expect some of the beating he gets. They'd never
admit that, probably even to themselves, but he's held to a different
standard because he is so big and so good. It's like, you can see
their minds turning over, saying, "Hey, that's not a foul. He's a
350-pound giant."</TE>
<TE>   Jackson knows he can't change that. He probably felt some of the
same stuff when he played. But he knows how to occasionally let Shaq
know that he knows.</TE>
<TE>   I read the other day about Shaq clipping some item out of the
paper about Vlade Divac and pinning it up in his locker. Think about
that. That's the kind of stuff Little League kids in Pomona do, but
here is a 30-year-old multimillionaire wanting so badly to keep
himself focused to kick Vlade's butt that he is using kids'
motivational stuff. And yet, he feels comfortable doing it, because
his coach lets him be whatever he wants to be. I thought that was
impressive, and I told some of my team about that.</TE>
<TE>   And how about the article in The Times the other day by J.A.
Adande on how Mitch Richmond sits on the bench all the time and,
despite having the pride and ego of a one-time NBA star, still talks
nothing but team.</TE>
<TE>   On other teams, a guy like that would be a cancer. Kobe Bryant
called him the ultimate professional.</TE>
<TE>   All this stuff lands on Jackson, and none of it shows directly in
the box score.</TE>
<TE>   I've always said that there are two things that make great players
truly great. They have a love of who they are fighting for and a hate
of who they are fighting against.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe there's a third: a leader who makes them understand that.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Rick Majerus, Utah basketball coach, will be The Times' guest
analyst for the rest of the playoffs. Majerus, the fourth-winningest
active coach in major college basketball, will begin his 14th season
at Utah this fall.</TE>

<DL>INDIANAPOLIS</DL>
<LD>Seven years ago, when Tony George broke away from Championship Auto
Racing Teams Inc. and formed his Indy Racing League, open-wheel
racing fans were thrown into a tizzy over the schism. CART had the
big names and George had the Indianapolis 500.</LD>
<LD>   Tony Stewart, then an IRL rookie, was about the only person who
saw anything good in the split.</LD>
<LD>   "I don't know why everyone is so upset," he said then. "It makes
twice as many jobs for race car drivers and twice as many races for
fans."</LD>
<TE>   In 1995, the year before the split, CART had 17 races, three in
foreign countries. This year CART has 20, nine outside the U.S., and
the IRL 17.</TE>
<TE>   When the split occurred, it appeared that CART held all the cards.
They had most of the better-known drivers, a schedule with familiar
tracks, and race cars of a proven quality.</TE>
<TE>   The IRL mostly had a bunch of drivers and cars dredged up by Jack
Long and Phil Casey in hopes of filling the field for the 1996
Indianapolis 500. There were 17 rookies, some of whom had never raced
on a big oval.</TE>
<TE>   CART, proclaiming it had "the best drivers in the fastest cars,"
held a race on the same day at Michigan Speedway. It appeared that
the two organizations were going to have a head-on confrontation
indefinitely.</TE>
<TE>   The crux of the schism was George's rule that 25 of the 33
starters must be IRL regulars, that only eight spots would be
available for CART drivers. This incensed CART, which led to their
scheduling the Michigan race.</TE>
<TE>   "We can't live with that," said Michael Andretti. "It's an insult
to CART."</TE>
<TE>   In an intriguing bit of irony, Sunday's race--in which the two
organizations have reached a unified position--is split 25 and 8. The
CART drivers are pole-sitter Bruno Junqueira and former 500 winner
Kenny Brack of Chip Ganassi's Target team; Andretti, Dario Franchitti
and Paul Tracy from Team Green; Tony Kanaan with Mo Nunn, Jimmy
Vasser with Bobby Rahal and Max Papis with Eddie Cheever.</TE>
<TE>   It has become apparent that neither side wants unification, that
both plan to continue along their current course--the IRL with an
all-American oval racing series and CART with a multidimensional
series with heavy foreign involvement.</TE>
<TE>   Rahal, one of the most outspoken advocates of CART during the
feud, is back, at least at Indy, with a team and a driver. He may
have the best solution to the situation.</TE>
<TE>   "What's wrong with having an all-oval series and an all-road
series and having both meet here at Indy?" he said.</TE>
<TE>   CART, which was reduced to 19 cars when Oriol Servia was dropped
last week, is rumored to be losing two more after next week's race at
Milwaukee. The agreement with TV and track promoters is said to be 20
cars minimum, so CART may be in the position of going out and
rounding up driver-car combinations the way the IRL did in its first
couple of years.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, Chris Pook, president of CART, has pointed out that
his series has drawn huge crowds at its first three races in Mexico,
Japan and Long Beach, while IRL crowds have been disappointingly
small at Homestead, Fla., Phoenix, Fontana and Nazareth, Pa.</TE>
<TE>   "The CART series is a multinational racing series with
multinational fans, sponsors and manufacturers, and those folks must
be pleased with what they've seen thus far in 2002," Pook said
recently. "It may be a bit of a cliche and it has certainly been said
in other forms of motor racing before, but better scripts could not
have been written for the first three events this season.</TE>
<TE>   "Our championship delivers real value to those that have invested
in it, and that has never been more evident than in these first three
races. Our strategy has been to hold events in the most important
markets all over the world, and we have found success in all of these
markets. We will continue ... for many years to come."</TE>
<TE>   The two sides met this week in an Open-Wheel Racing Summit at
Indianapolis Motor Speedway and nothing anyone said changed any
minds.</TE>
<TE>   George, as the conference host, said, "We all need to coexist and
raise motor sports as a whole."</TE>
<TE>   Pook was in Europe and not present at the gathering, but John
Lopes, senior vice president, and Jerry Forsythe, a CART team owner,
spoke for the organization.</TE>
<TE>   Said Lopes: "People either love CART or they hate it, but we're
not going to die."</TE>
<TE>   Added Forsythe: "Too much has been made of a possible merger
between the IRL and CART. It doesn't need to happen. There's great
racing, and there's room for two series."</TE>
<TE>   Roger Penske, who made the biggest statement in the conflict this
year when he moved his high-profile Marlboro team from CART to the
IRL, says he believes there will be only one series within five
years. And it won't be because of a merger.</TE>
<TE>   That means that he is betting on the IRL.</TE>
<TE>   Howard Katz, ABC Sports-TV president, echoed Penske's feelings,
but it must be noted that ABC and ESPN are contracted to televise all
IRL races through 2007.</TE>
<TE>   "There is not enough money, not enough sponsorship, not enough
room for both U.S.-based open-wheel series," Katz said at the summit.
"If Roger saw that it was better for his future to join with Tony
George, I think that's a heck of a statement."</TE>
<TE>   The difference in TV contracts is one significant factor in the
tilt toward the IRL. CART's television program calls for seven races
on CBS and the rest on Speed Channel, a cable channel unavailable in
many areas. Plus, CART must buy the air time and sell its own
advertising to cover expenses.</TE>
<TE>   The IRL also seems to be winning the engine war. For the last six
years, CART's main strength has been in its engine
manufacturers--Honda, Ford and Toyota. When CART announced a switch
from non-turbocharged powerplants to normally aspirated engines
similar to those used in the IRL, Honda said it was out and Ford
followed. Toyota said it would supply engines only if there was a
viable competitor, but would not build a spec engine as the sole
supplier.</TE>
<TE>   Honda dropped another bomb on CART's future Thursday when it
announced that it would provide engines, with the help of Ilmor, for
the IRL in 2003. Earlier in the week, Toyota announced a 2003 program
with Penske and Tom Kelley, another IRL team owner, using their
engines. This gives the IRL four manufacturers, along with Chevrolet
and Nissan Infiniti.</TE>
<TE>   The only CART engine supplier at the moment is MG, which Toyota
has said is not competition enough to warrant its building engines.
Ford is the wild card. However, Rahal said he expected to have Ford
engines in his CART cars next year.</TE>
<TE>   "It will probably be summer before we know where CART's engine
program is going," said Lee White, Toyota vice president. "Then we
will decide if we are going to be a participant."</TE>
<TE>   Even if Toyota leaves CART completely, it will not affect its
sponsorship of the Toyota Grand Prix of Long Beach.</TE>
<TE>   "We sponsored the Long Beach race before CART ran there and we
sponsored it before Toyota was part of it," said Les Unger, Toyota
national sports manager. "That race means a great deal to us. I can
assure you we will be part of the Long Beach Grand Prix whether it is
a CART race, an IRL race, a Formula One or one of Don Panoz's sports
car races."</TE>
<TE>   The Southland Scene</TE>
<TE>   Perris Auto Speedway will celebrate its "SCRA Salute to Indy" with
a 50-lap sprint car race Saturday night, 20 laps longer than usual.
This brings tire wear and fuel management into the mix on the
half-mile clay oval.</TE>
<TE>   When Tony Jones won his third race of the season last week at
Perris he moved within nine points of defending champion Cory
Kruseman.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The New Jersey Nets wouldn't mind at all if the Boston Celtics showed
up with the same defensive plan for Saturday's Game 3 of the Eastern
Conference finals.</LD>
<LD>   While that may sound silly after New Jersey shot 33% from the
field in a 93-86 loss in Game 2 on Tuesday, the Nets scoff at the
idea that the Celtics' defense had much to do with the performance.</LD>
<LD>   "It's nothing they really did," Net Coach Byron Scott said
Thursday in East Rutherford, N.J.</LD>
<TE>   Scott said that the Celtics clogged the lane, denying the Nets
their backdoor cuts and shutting down their transition game.</TE>
<TE>   They made the Nets into a jump-shooting team.</TE>
<TE>   "Teams have done that to us pretty much all season long and we
made jump shots," Scott said. "It's just a matter of making shots and
guys shooting them with confidence."</TE>
<TE>   The Nets also felt that they helped the Celtics by being too
impatient on offense.</TE>

<HD>Tway and Nicklaus Take Spotlight From Woods</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Tiger Woods' dominance at the Memorial suffered a setback Thursday at
Dublin, Ohio. Not only was he nine strokes behind Bob Tway, he
couldn't beat Jack.</LD>
<LD>   While Tway birdied four of his first five holes and had a tap-in
eagle for a seven-under-par 65, Woods failed to break par in the
opening round for the first time this year. He three-putted for
double-bogey on the final hole for a 74 and was so angry he refused
to talk about it.</LD>
<LD>   The cheers on a day of rare sunshine at Muirfield Village Golf
Club belonged to Jack Nicklaus, the 62-year-old whose back has
bothered him so much that he almost didn't play in his own tournament
for the first time.</LD>
<TE>   "Obviously, it was a heck of a lot of fun," Nicklaus said after
birdies on four of his last five holes for a one-under 71.</TE>
<TE>   Tway is one stroke ahead of Stewart Cink, who played a bogey-free
round of 66. Stuart Appleby, needing at least a top-five finish to
get into the U.S. Open, was another stroke behind at 67.</TE>

<HD>Irbe Leads Way for Carolina</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>TORONTO</DL>
<LD>The Toronto Maple Leafs had inspiration on their side. The Carolina
Hurricanes had Arturs Irbe.</LD>
<LD>   Irbe stopped 31 shots in a 3-0 victory by the Hurricanes on
Thursday, dousing whatever emotional boost the Maple Leafs had in
welcoming back Coach Pat Quinn. Quinn made a surprising return after
spending the last two days in the hospital because of an irregular
heartbeat.</LD>
<LD>   Sami Kapanen and Ron Francis each had a goal and assist, while
Jaroslav Svoboda also scored to give the Hurricanes a 3-1 lead in the
Eastern Conference finals.</LD>
<TE>   The best-of-seven series resumes at Carolina on Saturday, where
the Hurricanes can clinch their first Stanley Cup finals berth.</TE>
<TE>   Irbe came up with his best performance of the postseason,
recording his first career playoff shutout.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the reason [we won] is sitting next to me," said
Hurricane captain Ron Francis, seated next to Irbe. "We didn't play
enough to win that game. Archie stole it for us."</TE>
<TE>   Added Hurricane Coach Paul Maurice: "Everybody in our organization
has a piece in the winning, and Archie had a great big fat piece of
that one tonight."</TE>
<TE>   In the first period, the Maple Leafs outshot the Hurricanes, 9-1,
but Irbe was on form, even stopping Alexander Mogilny's backhander
from in close.</TE>
<TE>   Irbe got help from defenseman Bret Hedican six minutes into the
second period. Irbe got part of Mogilny's shot, allowing the rebound
to dribble into the crease, which Hedican swept away.</TE>
<TE>   Irbe saved his best for last, recording two huge stops four
minutes into the third period with Carolina clinging to a 1-0 lead.</TE>
<TE>   Irbe got his right pad out to stop Tomas Kaberle's point shot,
which was deflected in front.</TE>
<TE>   He then dived to his right to stop Jonas Hoglund's attempt at the
rebound.</TE>
<TE>   "As the game went on, I got a couple of lucky saves," Irbe said
modestly. "As it goes longer, the better you feel. And in the end, it
was fun."</TE>
<TE>   It was no fun for the Maple Leafs, who lost their third straight
game despite having the familiar Quinn to direct them.</TE>
<TE>   Quinn was released from the hospital two hours before game time
and headed straight for the arena.</TE>
<TE>   Quinn received a standing ovation before the game, and showed he
hadn't lost his edge.</TE>
<TE>   He was spotted chewing out Toronto center Alyn McCauley on the
bench at the end of the first period.</TE>
<TE>   But the Maple Leafs failed to respond.</TE>
<TE>   "We really wanted to win this game for him," team captain Mats
Sundin said. "We had the right focus, and I thought we had the work
ethic. We just couldn't finish it off."</TE>

<LD>After two months of scuffling along, the Chicago Cubs are finally
starting to hit.</LD>
<LD>   Fred McGriff homered and almost did it a second time, and rookie
Bobby Hill hit his first major league home run Thursday as the Cubs
beat the Pittsburgh Pirates, 11-6, at Chicago. It was their third
consecutive victory.</LD>
<LD>   "Every day you've got somebody picking another guy up, that's how
you win ballgames," said McGriff, who had three runs batted in and is
hitting .438 over the last six games.</LD>
<TE>   "It's going to take a team effort day in and day out. The
[second-place] Cardinals are playing real good right now, so we've
got to get going."</TE>
<TE>   Hill went three for five with four RBIs, coming within a double of
hitting for the cycle. The Cubs outhit the Pirates, 15-10, and had
double-digit runs for the first time since April 24.</TE>
<TE>   Matt Clement (2-3) held the Pirates scoreless for five innings
before giving up Jason Kendall's two-run double in the sixth inning.</TE>
<TE>   Kris Benson (0-2) struggled again for the Pirates, who dropped a
season-low four games below .500 with their third straight loss. The
right-hander, who missed all of last season after elbow surgery, gave
up seven runs and 11 hits in 31/3 innings.</TE>
<TE>   "He's going to have some up and down days," Pirate Manager Lloyd
McClendon said. "There's times when he will be good and other times
he will not have his stuff. You just need to be patient."</TE>
<TE>   St. Louis 5, Houston 4--J.D. Drew broke an eighth-inning tie with
an RBI single as the Cardinals completed a three-game sweep at St.
Louis.</TE>
<TE>   The Cardinals have won five in a row and 12 of 14 and are two
games behind first-place Cincinnati in the National League Central.
They swept the Astros for the first time since Sept. 2-4, 1996, also
at Busch Stadium.</TE>
<TE>   Houston has lost four in a row after winning seven straight.</TE>
<TE>   Jim Edmonds was three for four with his 11th homer for the
Cardinals.</TE>
<TE>   Miguel Cairo singled with one out in the eighth off Octavio Dotel
(2-2). Fernando Vina greeted Billy Wagner, pitching for the first
time in four days, with a double and Drew followed by lining a
first-pitch fastball to right.</TE>
<TE>   The Cardinals have 18 come-from-behind victories.</TE>
<TE>   New York 1, Philadelphia 0--Pinch-hitter Mark Johnson's RBI double
in the ninth inning broke a scoreless tie at Philadelphia.</TE>
<TE>   Joe McEwing hit a one-out single off Jose Mesa (1-4), moved to
second when Jeromy Burnitz was hit by a pitch and scored on Johnson's
double to right.</TE>
<TE>   Phillie starter Brandon Duckworth gave up five hits in eight
shutout innings. It was his longest outing in 21 career starts.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson, who had been six for 43 before the at-bat, ended an
0-for-15 slump with the drive over right fielder Bobby Abreu.</TE>
<TE>   Florida 8, Cincinnati 4--Luis Castillo hit his first career homer
from the left side, a three-run shot off Jose Rijo at Cincinnati.</TE>
<TE>   Castillo had three hits for the second consecutive game,
jump-starting an offense that has languished during the longest trip
in Marlin history. Castillo has an 11-game hitting streak, going 23
for 49.</TE>
<TE>   Florida is 3-7 on its 14-game trip, tumbling from first in the NL
East.</TE>
<TE>   Rijo (4-2) lost for only the second time since he rejoined the
rotation, completing his comeback from five elbow operations. He lost
his control in the fourth, then made one bad pitch to the
switch-hitting Castillo that turned the game.</TE>
<TE>   Castillo's homer was so unexpected that pitcher Julian Tavarez
stopped at third after the ball barely cleared the right-field wall.
He looked around to see what had happened before proceeding.</TE>

<HD>Rockies Win With Zeile</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>DENVER</DL>
<LD>Through three innings, it was shaping up to be one of the worst games
of Todd Zeile's career.</LD>
<LD>   Showing remarkable resiliency, Zeile wound up with five runs
batted in, matching his career high, as the Colorado Rockies routed
the San Diego Padres, 16-3, on Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   The Rockies, 17-8 under Manager Clint Hurdle after a 6-16 start
under Buddy Bell, moved into fourth place in the National League West
ahead of the Padres.</LD>
<TE>   Larry Walker and Todd Helton homered on consecutive pitches, and
Todd Hollandsworth had a three-run homer. John Thomson pitched seven
strong innings, and Bobby Estalella had three straight doubles for
the Rockies, who posted their first three-game sweep of San Diego in
Denver since 1995.</TE>
<TE>   Zeile had three straight hits after his poor start.</TE>
<TE>   "Baseball is the strangest game," Zeile said. "I started out as
poorly in this game as any game I can remember in recent times. I
grounded out with the bases loaded. I struck out with two men on.</TE>
<TE>   "I cost Larry [Walker] an assist in right field when I drop a
throw at third. And we're only in the third inning.</TE>
<TE>   "I was angry about the error. I was upset about costing Larry
because he made such a great throw. I don't know that you need extra
motivation, but I certainly didn't want to let that be something that
turned into the difference in the game."</TE>
<TE>   Zeile made sure of it. He had RBIs in three straight innings--a
two-run double in the sixth, an RBI single in the seventh and a
sacrifice fly in the eighth. His groundout in the first also produced
a run.</TE>
<TE>   "He brings a calm confidence to the ballclub," Hurdle said of
Zeile, who was acquired in a trade with the New York Mets in January.</TE>
<TE>   "He's probably played in more big games than the rest of our club
combined. He's as good a two-strike hitter as I've seen in a while.
He might not look good early, but he finds a way to get the barrel on
the ball late. He did it again today."</TE>

<LD>If all goes well for them, Tom and Tina Sjogren should be sitting on
top of the world sometime within the next week.</LD>
<LD>   Of course, seldom does all go well during an unsupported trek to
the North Pole, which is why only a handful of adventurers reach it
each year, and the Sjogrens' historic expedition might have to be
abandoned at any moment.</LD>
<LD>   On Thursday, for instance, the New York-based couple, attempting
to become the first people to cross both of the earth's poles one
almost right after the other, awoke to temperatures below zero, a
howling wind and foggy, whiteout conditions. Rest was not an option.</LD>
<TE>   "Our supplies are so limited," said Tina, who with her husband of
18 years began the 483-mile trek to the North Pole from Ward Hunt
Island, Canada, on March 17. "We only have food and gas for another
six days, so we have to head out in this. So we're going to put on
facemasks to protect our faces and put on all the clothes we need and
just head out into it."</TE>
<TE>   Traversing a constantly shifting frozen landscape, they are
unsupported by dogs, sails or air drops. They drag their supplies
behind them on sleds that at expedition's start weighed 350 pounds.
Skiing across open ice or using their sleds to paddle leads--channels
of nearly frozen water--they have also tackled ice ridges 30 feet
tall and 150 feet wide, all the while battling mostly inclement
weather and temperatures as low as minus-60 degrees.</TE>
<TE>   "What worries me is, whenever there's a wind, a lot of things
happen to the ice and the area we passed yesterday was really nasty.
The water was bobbing up and down," she said, "... also the wind,
together with the strong current, is actually carrying us away in the
leads. So it's pretty bad right now."</TE>
<TE>   As they have discovered, however, it could be a lot worse.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, more than 200 miles from land, Tom came frighteningly
close to suffering a broken neck and Tina nearly drowned.</TE>
<TE>   Tina was ahead when Tom, passing over a ridge, slipped and fell
onto his head.</TE>
<TE>   Finding her husband nearly unconscious, Tina feared that he might
be paralyzed. She determined that he was not, but their ordeal was
far from over. Moving Tom onto a solid piece of ice, she put up a
tent and tucked him into a sleeping bag "because he was getting
hypothermic." Then she went for his sled.</TE>
<TE>   "But because I was in a hurry and I was a little bit stressed,"
she said, "I didn't care to put on my skis and I fell right through
into the ocean because I couldn't see that there was black ice
because it was covered with snow."</TE>
<TE>   What had happened, she said, took a few seconds to register. And
then suddenly popped into her head thoughts of an adventurer who had
drowned in those very waters a year ago. Not wearing a drysuit, she
felt herself getting rapidly colder.</TE>
<TE>   "I said to myself, 'I have to get out of here,'" she said.</TE>
<TE>   On one side of the lead, however, the edge was too steep to climb
out of the water. On the other, the ice was so thin that every time
she heaved herself out of the water it broke away. She felt herself
growing weaker.</TE>
<TE>   "You are very, very cold and suddenly it's like somebody opens you
and blood comes out," she said. "You just totally lose all strength."</TE>
<TE>   Not lost, however, was her will.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, her hands nearly numb, she lifted herself onto the ice.</TE>
<TE>   "If I don't do this, I'm going to die," she said, explaining how
she'd saved herself. "You get that kind of power sometimes when you
really must."</TE>
<TE>   The next day, Tina phoned a doctor who guided her to construct a
makeshift neck stabilizer for Tom from a piece of foam mattress, and
the couple were soon moving again. They were back into their regular
routine, ingesting 5,000 to 6,000 calories a day of freeze-dried food
to maintain their strength and energy but still losing weight, their
faces covered with cold lumps and their knees, legs and backs crying
for mercy.</TE>
<TE>   This is their third expedition in 18 months. After aborting their
first attempt to reach the South Pole early last year because of
illness and logistical problems after 62 days, the Sjogrens, both 42,
started another attempt Nov. 29, completing the 1,250-mile Polar
skiing journey to the earth's southernmost point Feb. 2.</TE>
<TE>   The successful quest made Tina the first woman to have reached two
of what adventurers call the three poles, the Sjogrens having scaled
Mt. Everest in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Each lost about 40 pounds and contracted frostbite while dragging
their supply-weighted sleds across Antarctica, but six weeks later,
after regaining about 30 pounds each, they were back on their skis,
trekking toward the North Pole.</TE>
<TE>   It was enough to make Tom, a Swede, jokingly announce to his Czech
wife one day over lunch early in the expedition, as recounted later
in the couple's daily dispatches at www.thepoles.com, "I'll place a
personals ad in classifieds: Calm, simple guy looking for a
like-minded girl for uncomplicated, serene life and candle-light
dinners."</TE>
<TE>   Communicating to the world via computers around their waists and
monitors built into their eyepieces, the Sjogrens have laboriously
and painstakingly made their way toward the North Pole in their
attempt to become only the fourth and fifth persons to achieve the
so-called "Triple Crown" of adventuring.</TE>
<TE>   Full-time adventurers who own a household-tissue delivery service
in Sweden, the couple have crossed jungles, sailed oceans and spent
several years climbing in the Himalayas. Their trek toward the North
Pole, they say, is "by far" the most difficult adventure they've
attempted, Tom saying the trip combines the most arduous aspects of
the Everest climb and the Antarctica journey.</TE>
<TE>   It has brought the Sjogrens closer, Tina said, not only to an
adventuring milestone and the northernmost point on the globe but
also to each other.</TE>
<TE>   "We get along very, very well because we have to," she said. "This
is so strenuous on you physically and mentally. ... To start fighting
in this kind of situation puts an unbearable strain on us, so we
can't do that. But it has taken some time to get to this point."</TE>
<TE>   Staying positive through it all, Tom said, is a constant battle.</TE>
<TE>   "That's the most difficult part in an expedition," he said. "Your
whole body wants to quit all the time. Your mind wants to quit.</TE>
<TE>   "You know, why am I doing this? It's not really necessary. Let me
go back home and have a nice coffee in SoHo instead. So you have to
train yourself to not quit--even when you have good reason to quit."</TE>
<TE>   More obstacles could lie ahead.</TE>
<TE>   An open patch of ocean several miles wide could end their pursuit
of the North Pole, and a new moon is due this weekend, promising
higher tides and threatening to break up the ice and open more leads.
Constructing a catamaran out of their sleds is a possibility, but
still they might run out of time before reaching their unmarked
destination.</TE>
<TE>   "Because we are unsupported, we must go slowly," Tina said. "That
leaves us here very late in the season and to be this close to the
North Pole this late is not a very good thing because this is the
time when everything melts.</TE>
<TE>   "If we had been here one month earlier, everything would have been
frozen over. It would have been totally different. But now everything
is melting around us."</TE>
<TE>   They have no idea what awaits them at the North Pole, in the
middle of the Arctic Ocean, because, as Tina said, "We've never been
there before."</TE>
<TE>   They suspect it will be ice.</TE>
<TE>   They pray it's not water.</TE>

<LD>Chelsea Johnson of Atascadero, the top-ranked girls' pole vaulter in
the nation, will not compete in the 100-meter high hurdles tonight in
the Southern Section Masters Meet at Cerritos College.</LD>
<LD>   The UCLA-bound Johnson advanced to the Masters Meet in the hurdles
and pole vault, but dropped the highs so she could focus on the pole
vault.</LD>
<LD>   Johnson had two close attempts at a national high school record of
13 feet 9 inches in the Southern Section divisional championships at
Cerritos last Saturday, but admitted her legs were tired after
competing in the hurdles.</LD>
<TE>   Angel Perkins of Cerritos Gahr will not run in the 400 in the
Masters Meet, choosing to focus on the 100 and 200. Perkins, the
defending state champion in the 200, is not in peak form after
sustaining a hamstring injury earlier this season.</TE>
<TE>   The Masters Meet is the Southern Section qualifying meet for the
state championships. Field events start at 4:30 p.m. Track events
begin at 6.</TE>

<HD>Patriots Win First Boys' Title Since 1992</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>JOHN ORTEGA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"There is no defense in track."</LD>
<LD>   Tom Stevenson, the former football and track coach at Woodland
Hills Taft High, made that statement midway through the City Section
track and field championships at Van Nuys Birmingham on Thursday and
the host Patriots proved it by rolling to their first section boys'
title since 1992.</LD>
<LD>   Taft, the two-time defending champion, set a section record with a
40.74-second clocking in the 400-meter relay and Toreador senior
Justin Tryon won the 400 in a career-best 47.25, the fastest time in
the state this year.</LD>
<TE>   But Birmingham had too much depth for Taft.</TE>
<TE>   The Patriots, led by junior Damian Rinaldi's winning times of 1
minute 56.66 seconds in the 800 and 4:25.44 in the 1,600, won six
events and scored points in 11 of 15 events.</TE>
<TE>   "I felt confident coming into the meet," Birmingham Coach Scott
King said. "I felt confident we would come through, but I didn't
expect us to come through as much as we did."</TE>
<TE>   Junior Dennis Keyes and senior Jhad Jones, two relatively unknown
hurdlers, played a big part in Birmingham's second City title.</TE>
<TE>   Keyes and Jones placed first and third in the 110 high hurdles
with times of 14.82 and 15.35. They reversed that order in the 300
intermediates with times of 39.22 and 40.08.</TE>
<TE>   Taft totaled a whopping 60 points in the sprints and relays, but
couldn't overtake Birmingham.</TE>
<TE>   Toreador junior Noah Smith posted career bests of 10.70 and 21.35
in winning the 100 and 200 and ran the second leg on the 400 relay
team that broke the City record of 40.88 set by a Quincy
Watts-anchored Taft squad in 1987.</TE>
<TE>   Tryon, in addition to crushing his previous best of 48.02,
anchored the state-leading 400 relay team and the winning 1,600 relay
that timed 3:13.96.</TE>
<TE>   Reseda Cleveland won its first section title in the girls' meet
with a 113-96 victory over defending champion Birmingham. The
Cavaliers' point total broke the previous record of 112 set by Taft
in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   Senior Michelle Stinnette of Cleveland won the 100 and 200 with
career bests of 12.03 and 24.63, respectively. She also ran legs on
the 400 relay that clocked a school-record 47.02 and the 1,600 relay
that finished second to Birmingham in 3:51.36.</TE>
<TE>   Fellow senior Brynne Steward ran on both Cleveland relay teams and
led the Cavaliers to 1-2 finishes in the 100 high hurdles and 300
lows with times of 14.78 and 45.29, respectively.</TE>
<TE>   Birmingham had the highest point total ever for a second-place
team.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to winning the 1,600 relay in 3:49.60, the Patriots
got victories from senior Michelle Rivera in the pole vault, junior
Vincetta Mendola in the long jump and junior Ellen Shepstone in the
shotput.</TE>

<LD>Whittier California continued to ride the pitching of junior Jennifer
Davis, who threw her third consecutive playoff shutout to beat Simi
Valley Royal, 1-0, in a Southern Section Division II quarterfinal
Thursday at Rancho Simi Community Park.</LD>
<LD>   Davis (20-4) struck out six and walked one in a one-hitter. In 21
innings, the right-hander has struck out 23, walked one and allowed
two hits. California (26-5), ranked No. 7 by The Times, scored with
two out in the first, when freshman Jenn Griffin tripled over the
left fielder's head to score freshman Krysty Calzada. Calzada reached
base on a two-base throwing error.</LD>
<LD>   California, a finalist last season, will play host to Placentia El
Dorado, a 2-1 winner over top-seeded Santa Ana Foothill, on Tuesday
in a semifinal.</LD>
<TE>   Davis had not allowed a hit since a leadoff single in the first
inning of the first round. Her streak of 18 consecutive no-hit
innings ended when Nichole Mears of fourth-seeded Royal (25-6-1)
blooped a single to left-center to lead off the fifth.</TE>
<TE>   Royal's most serious threat came in the fourth, when an error and
a botched fielder's choice gave the Highlanders runners on first and
second with none out. Davis struck out the next three batters on nine
pitches.</TE>
<TE>   The game was the last for Royal Coach Kelly Lovato, who inherited
a struggling program two years ago and went 37-14 and won the
Marmonte League championship this season, the Highlanders' first
since 1980. Lovato is moving on to resurrect the softball program at
Mission College.</TE>

<LD>Hacienda Heights Wilson pitcher Jamee Juarez had allowed only three
hits in her first two playoff games. And in her team's quarterfinal
game Thursday at top-seeded Garden Grove Pacifica, she didn't allow a
hit in five of the six innings she pitched.</LD>
<LD>   But in that other inning ...</LD>
<LD>   Jennifer Orpitelli singled with two out in the fourth inning,
driving in Jessica Marical from second base to give Pacifica a 1-0
victory over Wilson in a Southern Section Division III game that
featured two of the top-ranked teams in the state.</LD>
<TE>   Neither Pacifica (28-2-1), ranked No. 3 in the state by Cal-Hi
Sports, nor No. 14 Wilson (25-3-1) expected to face the other in a
quarterfinal, but a loss in the last week of the season by Wilson to
Covina Charter Oak threw the pairings askew.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we do a good job of turning worry into positive energy,"
said Orpitelli, a senior first baseman and Pacifica's only
left-handed batter in the lineup.</TE>
<TE>   The clutch fourth-inning hit by Orpitelli was enough to move the
Mariners past the team that beat them, 8-0, in the 2000 championship
and set up a semifinal game on Tuesday against Riverside King, a 2-0
winner over Atascadero. A coin flip will determine the home team.</TE>
<TE>   "With Juarez in the circle, you don't know how many chances you're
going to get to score someone from second base," Orpitelli said.</TE>
<TE>   It turned out there were two chances, the other being in the
second inning when Juarez (19-3) walked her only two batters. She
struck out nine. Four of the six innings, Pacifica went down in
order. Consecutive strikeouts helped get her out of the second-inning
jam, which ended when Mallorie Lenn was caught trying to steal third
base.</TE>
<TE>   But Marical, who singled softly to center field to open the fourth
inning, stole second base, putting her in position to score on
Orpitelli's line drive to left-center field. She slid in ahead of the
throw home.</TE>
<TE>   "We were convinced this was a championship game," Juarez said. "If
we could get past this game, everything else wouldn't be as hard."</TE>
<TE>   But they couldn't do that against Pacifica freshman Brittany Weil
(23-0), who allowed five hits and stranded six baserunners. She
struck out seven.</TE>
<TE>   Martin Henderson</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In Division II softball:</TE>
<TE>   Placentia El Dorado 2, Santa Ana Foothill 1--El Dorado's Molly
Harris scored twice, the second on a double by Heather Martin in the
bottom of the 11th inning, to upset top-seeded Foothill (29-4).</TE>
<TE>   La Palma Kennedy 2, Riverside Poly 1--Elaina Nordstrom singled in
Breanne Sabol and Michelle Turner in the 16th inning to break a
scoreless tie and give the visiting Fighting Irish (23-5-1) the
victory.</TE>
<TE>   Poly scored on an error with two out in the bottom of the inning
to make it 2-1, but Turner (22-4-1) induced a groundout to end the
game. Turner, who threw a five-hitter with 12 strikeouts, had her
streak of scoreless innings ended at 121, three short of the Southern
Section record of 124 set by Keira Goerl of Moreno Valley in 1999.</TE>

<LD>Fourth-seeded Brentwood (17-4) won eight of nine doubles sets and
Eric McKean won two sets at No. 1 singles Thursday to help knock off
top-seeded Corona del Mar, 10-8, in a Southern Section Division V
boys' tennis quarterfinal at Corona del Mar.</LD>
<LD>   Cameron Ball swept his three singles sets for Corona del Mar,
which defeated Brentwood, 10-8, in a nonleague match this season.</LD>
<LD>   Ari Rosenthal and Michael Freeman won two sets at No. 3 doubles
for Brentwood, which will play North Hollywood Harvard-Westlake in
the division final at 1p.m. Wednesday at The Claremont Club in
Claremont.</LD>
<TE>   North Hollywood Harvard-Westlake 11, San Marino 7--The
second-seeded Wolverines (26-1) swept all nine doubles sets and Jesse
Ferlianto and John Greenberg each picked up a set in singles in a
Division V victory over third-seeded San Marino (23-4) at Studio City
Golf and Tennis.</TE>
<TE>   "I was hoping I was going to have something to celebrate tonight,
and now I do," said Ferlianto, who turned 18 on Thursday. Ferlianto
defaulted his third set after the victory was clinched by
Harvard-Westlake's No. 3 doubles team of Joe Hiatt and Bret Thacher.
Hiatt and Thacher won their sets, 6-3, 6-4, 6-2.</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ireland's World Cup hopes imploded in spectacular fashion Thursday
when Roy Keane, the team's captain and most influential player, was
dismissed from the squad by Coach Mick McCarthy.</LD>
<LD>   The Manchester United player had blasted training camp conditions
in Saipan and criticized the team's World Cup preparations in an
interview with the Irish Times. Asked to explain his actions, he got
into an ugly shouting match with McCarthy.</LD>
<LD>   "I cannot and will not tolerate being spoken to with that level of
abuse being thrown at me, so I sent him home," McCarthy told the
British Broadcasting Corp.</LD>
<TE>   "This is a huge decision, but I am happy to go to the World Cup
one man down rather than with a man who shows utter disregard and
disrespect for me."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Argentina underlined its status as World Cup favorite by routing
the Kashima Antlers of Japan's J-League, 5-1, in Nahara, Japan.
Gabriel Batistuta, a second-half substitute, scored four goals.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Germany midfielder Michael Ballack missed the team's first
training session in Miyazaki, Japan, on Thursday because of a bruised
foot, but Coach Rudi Voeller dismissed the injury as "nothing
serious" and said Ballack would be training again in a day or two.
Meanwhile, midfielder Sebastian Deisler  underwent knee surgery in
Colorado and will not be on the team.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Two goals by Benedict McCarthy gave South Africa a morale-boosting
2-0 victory over fellow World Cup team Turkey in a warmup game in
Hong Kong, where Scotland defeated Hong Kong, 4-0, in an unrelated
match to give former Germany coach Berti Vogts his first victory in
five games as Scotland's coach.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   An own goal by Ecuador defender Raul Guerron gave Senegal a 1-0
win over the South Americans in a warmup game between the World Cup
teams.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Tunisia's rapidly unraveling World Cup fortunes were dealt another
blow when the North Africans were soundly beaten, 3-0, in Osaka,
Japan, by Gamba Osaka of the J-League.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Pre-tournament nerves and tension are beginning to take their
toll. Two of Sweden's English-based players, Fredrik Ljungberg of
Arsenal and Olof Mellberg of Aston Villa, brawled after Ljungberg
threw a few punches at Mellberg for making several late and
potentially dangerous tackles during training.</TE>

<HD>Mah Is Hoping Sylmar Beats First-Round Jinx</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Eric Sondheimer</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Everyone knows about March Madness and the strange happenings
associated with college basketball.</LD>
<LD>   Jamie Mah of Sylmar High has gone through May Madness, courtesy of
the City Section baseball playoffs.</LD>
<LD>   For three consecutive seasons, Mah has seen his team eliminated in
the opening round of the playoffs. Nothing hurt more than the
Spartans' bizarre demise during his sophomore season.</LD>
<TE>   Sylmar was leading Woodland Hills El Camino Real, 6-0, going into
the bottom of the seventh inning. Pitcher Ivan Lopez was working on a
no-hitter.</TE>
<TE>   Then came the madness. A two-out, two-strike, three-run double by
Jason Kort gave El Camino Real a 7-6 victory. The Conquistadores went
on to reach the City final at Dodger Stadium. Sylmar players went
home dejected.</TE>
<TE>   "It stung," Mah said. "I kept playing it over and over in my mind
through the summer and starting into my junior year. I was in
disbelief on the bus. Our whole team was in shock. We were so sure we
were going to the next round and they just rallied, getting clutch
hit after clutch hit."</TE>
<TE>   It took months before Mah figured out the lesson of May Madness.</TE>
<TE>   "It definitely taught me and reinforced the idea the game isn't
over until the 21st out is recorded," he said. "It goes to show you
baseball is pretty unpredictable."</TE>
<TE>   Mah begins the City playoffs today as one of the few players
capable of putting his team on his back and carrying it to Dodger
Stadium.</TE>
<TE>   He has been a four-year starter at shortstop for Sylmar (24-4),
which is seeded No. 1 in the 16-team tournament and plays host to
South Gate in its opener. In the last two years, Mah also has
distinguished himself as a right-handed pitcher with a college-level
curveball.</TE>
<TE>   There are people who doubt Sylmar, even though the Spartans
finished 13-0 in Valley Mission League play. It is the first time in
Coach Gary Donatella's 14 years that one of his teams has made it
through league play unbeaten.</TE>
<TE>   "It seems a lot of people don't give us the credit we're due, but
I think we like being labeled underdogs," Mah said. "They're not real
sure who we are and don't expect anything out of us."</TE>
<TE>   It's true the Valley Mission League was weaker this season, with
six-time City champion Granada Hills Kennedy and San Fernando hurt by
graduation, but Sylmar developed the kind of pitching depth coaches
hope to have.</TE>
<TE>   Early season injuries to seniors Mah and Mike Garcia forced
Donatella to turn to unsung pitchers Chris Palma (7-1) and Francisco
Molina (5-3), who kept the Spartans winning. Palma, a junior, wasn't
even supposed to play varsity.</TE>
<TE>   "He was a bubble guy coming out of winter league," Donatella said.
"We didn't know what to do with him. Because we had people hurt, he
had to pitch."</TE>
<TE>   Mah returned at the end of March after swelling from a blocked
vein in his right shoulder was resolved. He has become the dominant
pitcher Sylmar fans always envisioned, going 5-0 with a 0.37
earned-run average. As a hitter, he's batting .408 and has 122 career
hits.</TE>
<TE>   Mah, 5 feet 10, 175 pounds, plays with passion.</TE>
<TE>   "Ever since I was a little kid, I've been the loud one on the
team," he said. "I always like to play with intensity and
enthusiasm."</TE>
<TE>   Mah was home-schooled until fourth grade and didn't attend his
first public school until Sylmar as a ninth-grader. He used to get
into trouble for talking too much in class, but it didn't hurt his
grades. He has a 3.6 grade-point average, scored 1,260 on the SAT and
could end up at Loyola Marymount.</TE>
<TE>   He was encouraged from an early age by his parents to be
adventurous, speak his mind and develop independence.</TE>
<TE>   "I definitely want to go on and make this season last all the way,
baby," he said. Getting to Dodger Stadium would wipe out the bad
memories from Mah's sophomore season and also be a parting gift to
Donatella, who is stepping down as coach to spend more time with his
children, ages 7 and 4.</TE>
<TE>   "We all understand," Mah said. "We know it's his last year and
we're trying to make it special." Mah has been around so long at
Sylmar that his nickname could be Yoda. He has become the wise senior
undeterred by playoff disappointments.</TE>
<TE>   "We have our doubters, but we believe in ourselves," he said.
"We've measured ourselves against some pretty quality teams. We know
what we can do. The secret of being a successful team is a lot of
determination, skill and a tiny bit of luck."</TE>

<DH>Women's basketball: Sparks plan to celebrate 2001 title
Saturday, then set about business of repeating.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE TERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Like most of her teammates, Latasha Byears spent part of the
off-season thinking about Saturday, when the Sparks open the WNBA
season against New York.</LD>
<LD>   It is the day the Sparks will receive some precious jewelry--rings
for winning the 2001 WNBA title last September. Los Angeles was the
first team to win the title besides Houston, which won the league's
first four championships.</LD>
<LD>   "I don't know if I'll be emotional," Byears said. "But it's going
to be a special moment for me, the team and my family. This was a
major accomplishment. This is the reason you play this game, to reach
this level. You have people that play the game all their lives and
never accomplish this."</LD>
<TE>   Byears wasn't alone.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone I talked to [after the season] kept asking, 'When do you
get the ring?'" said reserve point guard Nicky McCrimmon. "I just
want to see it."</TE>
<TE>   The rest of league wants to see what the Sparks will do next.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles posted successive 28-4 regular seasons. Last year, the
Sparks were the first team to go unbeaten at home in the regular
season (16-0), set a league record for consecutive wins to start the
season (nine) and had a league-record 18-game winning streak.</TE>
<TE>   Lisa Leslie was the league's dominant player. She averaged 19.5
points and 9.6 rebounds, and became the first WNBA player to win the
regular-season, All-Star game and playoff MVP awards in the same
season.</TE>
<TE>   She had strong support from three other starters--Tamecka Dixon
(11.7), Mwadi Mabika (11.2) and DeLisha Milton (10.3)--who scored in
double figures. Byears, acquired in a trade from Sacramento, averaged
9.3 points and 5.7 rebounds off the bench.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Coach Michael Cooper does not want to let the team become
content. His outlandish prediction of an undefeated regular season
aside, Cooper has some goals in mind to help Los Angeles repeat.</TE>
<TE>   Last season the Sparks led the WNBA in scoring, at 76.3 points a
game. Cooper wants to bump the total to 90. He also plans for the
Sparks to lower their points allowed from 67.6 by playing even more
aggressive man-to-man defense. That means the team must be able to
run for 40 minutes and willing to challenge every possession by
opponents.</TE>
<TE>   He also wants the Sparks to widen their rebound differential (34.5
to opponents' 28.8) and have a tougher mind-set on the road. All four
regular-season losses came away from Staples Center.</TE>
<TE>   Leslie said the team must work to stay ahead of the league.</TE>
<TE>   "It takes more than one player to win a championship, but I feel
we've all done the necessary work in the off-season to bring back a
better Sparks' team this year," Leslie said.</TE>
<TE>   "We are an organization that shoots to be No. 1 and win
championships. You have to set high goals. If we fall short [of
32-0], will we be disappointed? No, because we still should land
somewhere among the top teams."</TE>
<TE>   The players understand that every team will want to be the one to
beat L.A.</TE>
<TE>   "The target has always been on us," McCrimmon said. "Houston had
the championships, but L.A. was always the team to beat. We came up
short a couple of times, but last year we finally got [the title].
And this could be a better team."</TE>
<TE>   General Manager Penny Toler pulled off an impressive draft-day
deal, sending starter Ukari Figgs and second-round pick Gergana
Slavtcheva to Portland for rookie point guard Nikki Teasley and
Sophia Witherspoon.</TE>
<TE>   Teasley, the fifth pick in the draft, inherits Figgs' starting
slot and will have much to prove to teammates and to the league.</TE>
<TE>   "It's definitely a loss for me on and off the court," Dixon said
when asked about the trade of Figgs, her best friend on the team.
"But Nikki is a great player; she just needs some veteran leadership
to help her along the way. I'm open to that. I hope we can lead her
in the right direction."</TE>
<TE>   Teasley, who left North Carolina as the school's all-time assist
leader, said she just wants to fit in.</TE>
<TE>   "This is definitely a place where you can have some fun," Teasley
said. "There is pressure, but I've been through a lot these past two
years, taking a year off from school [for treatment of depression]. I
learned how to build up my character, so I feel I'm ready to take on
anything now. I want them to repeat. If that means taking on a lot of
pressure, so be it."</TE>
<TE>   Witherspoon, a five-year veteran who has also played with New
York, is an important pickup too. She averaged 12.8 points last year
in Portland, and Cooper hopes to have that kind of production coming
off the bench.</TE>
<TE>   "Having been a starter in Portland and New York, to come here and
just want to fit in is a testament to her longevity in this league,"
Cooper said. "[Witherspoon] may come off the bench. But there will be
games she plays starter minutes because she's a heck of a player.
She's another great luxury added to us."</TE>
<TE>   Witherspoon said she will be happy to play when and where Cooper
needs her. And since joining the Sparks, she's discovered there is
grit under the glitz.</TE>
<TE>   "Around the league, L.A. had the reputation of being snobbish and
arrogant," Witherspoon said. "Now that I have an inside look, you are
taught here every day you are the best. And when you start believing
that, you walk and talk like you are the best. If you're on the
outside looking in, you don't understand that."</TE>

<LD>Bill Walton was on a bus headed for Game 2 of the Boston-New Jersey
series when he called on his cell phone. He didn't sound like someone
who had been on the road for more than a month.</LD>
<LD>   His 30-games-in-30-days NBA "Love It Live" tour was in overtime.</LD>
<LD>   "I think this is Day 32," Walton said. "We just kept going, the
band kept playing."</LD>
<TE>   Walton, filing daily reports for NBA.com as he traveled more than
40,000 miles around the country attending playoff games, made his
final entry from Sacramento on Monday, titling it, "The Luckiest Guy
in the World Says Goodbye."</TE>
<TE>   On his cell phone, he said, "I thought this would be cool, but it
far surpassed my most wildest dreams."</TE>
<TE>   He extended the tour to one more trip to New York. He was joined
by his youngest son, Chris, another son, Nathan, a recent Princeton
graduate who works on Wall Street, and his nephew Kam, brother
Bruce's son who is a sophomore at Harvard.</TE>
<TE>   "We're all here on this bus, which is fully stocked, headed to
another NBA playoff game," he said. "How do you beat this?"</TE>
<TE>   You may not like everything Walton says as a broadcaster, but it's
hard to knock his enthusiasm for life and basketball. That enthusiasm
is one reason the networks love him. There was a report this week
that he's in line to become the No. 1 analyst for ABC and ESPN when
those networks take over NBA coverage next season.</TE>
<TE>   "I've heard nothing, I know nothing," Walton said. "I've been all
involved with this tour."</TE>
<TE>   Walton returned to his home in San Diego on Wednesday, finally
getting a good night's sleep. He'll be at Staples Center tonight for
Game 3 of the Laker-Sacramento series, joining his partners on NBC's
No. 1 announcing team, Marv Albert, Steve "Snapper" Jones and
reporter Jim Gray.</TE>
<TE>   There are no more local or cable telecasts during the rest of the
NBA postseason. Everything from here on out is on NBC, meaning if you
want to hear Chick Hearn and Stu Lantz, you'll have to tune into
Laker flagship radio station KLAC (570).</TE>
<TE>   Walton says he'll spend the weekend in Los Angeles and visit an
old friend, John Wooden, at his home in Encino on Saturday. Then
he'll be back at Staples Center on Sunday afternoon for Game 4.</TE>
<TE>   Walton came up with the idea for the tour last summer while
recuperating from an operation, his 31st. This time he had his left
ankle fused by Clipper team doctor Tony Daly at Daniel Freeman Marina
Hospital in Marina del Rey, and then went home to recover. He was
bedridden with a cast from toe to hip.</TE>
<TE>   "Nathan came to visit and as he sat on the edge of the bed he
asked me what I was going to do after I recovered," Walton said. "I
told him that I was never going to sit down again."</TE>
<TE>   From that conversation, Walton said, came the idea for the tour,
and he sold the NBA on it.</TE>
<TE>   While son Luke missed the entire tour because he is touring in
Australia with the Arizona basketball team, wife Lori came along for
a while.</TE>
<TE>   "After six cross-country flights in four days, she was done,"
Walton said.</TE>
<TE>   As for Walton, he'd keep going forever if he could, talking to
fans and passing out tie-dyed shirts with his rookie picture on it.
You may have noticed he gave one to TNT's Charles Barkley on Tuesday
night.</TE>
<TE>   Walton said he has never had so much fun, and the three hours of
sleep a night and bouncing from one hotel to another didn't bother
him. One of the things he did as part of his daily reports was rate
the hotels.</TE>
<TE>   "We cited a hotel in Boston, of all places, for worst service," he
said. "I know it sounds unusual, but I like to drink hot water first
thing in the morning. I always order two thermoses of hot water sent
to the room, and quite a few hotels messed up the order. But this one
hotel sent two thermoses of hot milk. Now what was I going to do with
hot milk?"</TE>
<TE>   Oh well, at least he never got food poisoning.</TE>

<TE>   Get the H Out</TE>
<TE>   It was announced this week that Cris Carter was retiring from the
NFL and would be joining HBO's "Inside the NFL." The cast for that
show includes Cris Collinsworth.</TE>
<TE>   It may seem odd that both spell their first name in an
unconventional way, without an H. Well, there is an explanation.</TE>
<TE>   When Carter, 36, was in high school near Cincinnati, one of his
heroes was Collinsworth, 43, a wide receiver for the Bengals. Carter
thought it was cool the way Collinsworth spelled his first name. So
Carter began spelling it the same way. On Carter's passport and
driver's license, his first name is spelled Chris.</TE>

<TE>   Football in May</TE>
<TE>   NFL Europe, carried on Fox Sports Net on Saturdays and the Fox
network on Sundays, is now in full swing. NFL Europe is a
developmental league not only for players and referees but
broadcasters as well. There are 14 NFL announcers and commentators
who started out in NFL Europe, most notably Fox's Troy Aikman and
Daryl  Johnston. Carter also did some NFL Europe games for Fox before
being hired by HBO.</TE>
<TE>   Saturday night, football returns to NBC. Only it isn't the XFL.</TE>
<TE>   In a one-hour special at 8 p.m., the network will show highlights
of last Sunday's game between the New York City police and the New
York City firemen at Giants Stadium. The game is called "The Bravest
vs. the Finest."</TE>
<TE>   This show will be about a lot more than football. There will be
stories about many of those who lost their lives on Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   The fire department team lost eight former players and seven
active players, including starting quarterback Pat Lyons. His widow
Irene, who gave birth to the couple's son, Patrick, three weeks
before the terrorist attacks, is among those featured on the show.</TE>

<TE>   Indy Tidbits</TE>
<TE>   Paul Page, who was calling CART races for ABC the last three
years, returns to call Sunday's Indy 500, now that CART has moved to
Fox. Page began calling the Indy 500 on radio in 1977 and switched to
TV after Sid Collins' death in 1988.... Bob Jenkins will serve as the
host of the ABC coverage, Scott Goodyear will provide commentary and
Jack Arute, Gary Gerould and Vince Welch will report from the pit
area. Dr. Jerry Punch will serve as roving reporter.... Counting the
cameras the Indianapolis Motor Speedway uses for international
coverage, race-cams and ABC cameras in the pit area, there will be 54
cameras used to cover the race. There will be race-cams mounted on
eight cars and ABC will have radio contact with two drivers, Scott
Sharp and Arie Luyendyk.... If the race is rained out Sunday, ABC
will show it live Monday.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Short Waves</TE>
<TE>   Kevin Frazier, one of the best sports anchors in the business, is
close to signing with ESPN and leaving Fox Sports Net. At ESPN, he is
expected to be a "SportsCenter" anchor and an NBA host.... CBS and
HBO have revamped their NFL studio shows, and Fox Sports Net is said
to be revamping "NFL This Morning." Host Chris Myers will return, but
with a new cast, expected to be Tony Siragusa, Michael Irvin and
D'Marco Farr. That means Marv Levy, Deacon Jones and Billy Ray Smith
probably will not be back.</TE>
<TE>   Bill Weir has said he will be leaving Channel 7, and it could be
fairly soon. He has taped two pilots for a half-hour show, "The Late
Game," which is produced by a company owned by "Saturday Night Live"
creator Lorne Michaels. Weir says he expects to find out June 1 if
USA wants the show for its 11 p.m. time slot. If USA says OK, Weir is
gone.</TE>
<TE>   A winning note: KLAC marketing director Bill Lewis sent an e-mail
Wednesday noting that his station had broadcast eight Laker games
since April 25 and 23 Angel games since April 26. The two teams
combined were 26-5, a winning percentage of .839. ... Did you happen
to notice the Channel 2 promos on during the Laker game on Channel 9
Monday night? That's because Viacom, which owns CBS, also owns
Channel 9. ... TNT and TBS averaged a 2.5 rating for their 36 NBA
playoff games, up from 2.3 last year.</TE>

<TE>   In Closing</TE>
<TE>   The Kentucky Derby is supposed to be the most exciting two minutes
in sports, and after last weekend we know the most boring 15 minutes

<HD>Vargas Fires His Co-Trainer</HD>

<LD>While training for the most emotional fight of his life, Fernando
Vargas has fired co-trainer Roger Bloodworth.</LD>
<LD>   Vargas, scheduled to challenge World Boxing Council 154-pound
champion Oscar De La Hoya on Sept. 14 at Las Vegas' Mandalay Bay
Events Center, questioned the commitment of Bloodworth, who has been
in his corner since Vargas turned pro in 1997.</LD>
<LD>   The full load will now fall on Vargas' other trainer, Eduardo
Garcia, who has been with Vargas since his amateur days in Oxnard.</LD>
<TE>   "It was a business decision," said Gary Shaw, Vargas' promoter.
"Once Fernando makes up his mind about something, it's a done deal.
Fernando wishes him luck."</TE>
<TE>   Shaw disputed the idea that the shakeup could affect Vargas'
training for the fight against De La Hoya, Vargas' archrival from
East L.A.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not concerned at all," Shaw said. "Fernando is in great
shape. Mentally, he's in perfect shape. He just wants De La Hoya in
the ring. That part hasn't changed."</TE>

<LD>Chris Webber must be exhausted from playing all this defense.</LD>
<LD>   In the last week alone, Webber has: (a) stated that the reason he
didn't factor more heavily in last year's playoff sweep by the
Lakers, despite averaging 26 points and 13 rebounds, was a severe
ankle injury he denied having at the time; (b) patiently fended off
national reporter after national reporter wondering why he doesn't
post up and take over games in this year's Western Conference finals,
explaining that he is doing exactly what the Kings' system desires of
him; and (c) actually caused his coach to rise to something
approaching anger, which is so rare an occurrence as to be shocking.</LD>
<LD>   It happened the other day at the Kings' practice facility, when I
asked Rick Adelman whether the Kings' system--that is, Adelman's
system--does, despite its emphasis on versatility, allow room for a
guy like Webber to demand the ball down the stretch.</LD>
<TE>   "Yeah," Adelman said. "Yeah, it does. But all that criticism is
really unwarranted.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't understand. I mean, just because some announcer on TV or
somebody else thinks that this is the way this guy should play--why?
Who are these people? Why should their opinions matter?"</TE>
<TE>   Considering Sacramento's 61-21 regular-season record and furthest
postseason advance in the franchise's California history, it's a fair
question.</TE>
<TE>   So is this: Is there anything in the world standing between Chris
Webber and the elite status he craves?</TE>
<TE>   And if that something is an NBA championship, as Webber repeatedly
has said that it is, does the power forward really go to bed each
night confident he can obtain it without at least once taking over
his team?</TE>
<TE>   They're all conjoined, these questions. They matter as much
tonight, with the Kings facing the Lakers in Game 3 at Staples
Center, as they did a year ago or two years before that.</TE>
<TE>   And the fact that they've been answered the way they have, not
only by Webber but by people around him who have as much stake in the
outcome as does he, underscores the only real consistent truth about
Webber as a basketball player: Whatever you think you know about him,
you're wrong by at least half.</TE>
<TE>   It still seems unimaginable that Webber could look at even so
talented a roster as Sacramento's and not conclude that he needs to
be the central figure on the floor--that he doesn't feel at least a
touch of concession every time he launches an 18-footer from the
perimeter, the Lakers happily allowing him to fire away rather than
having to deal with him in the lane.</TE>
<TE>   Chris Webber? A fine player, on one of the top shelves in the NBA,
but a player who isn't even being urged by his own team to dominate
this series--and who won't take that initiative on his own, no matter
how maddening some of us find it.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been talking to a lot of veterans," Webber said, "and
they've told me, 'They're not gonna remember any of this if you
win.'"</TE>
<TE>   All of which is utterly secondary. Because the question here, as
it has been squarely for three years now, is about the winning.</TE>

<HD>Green's Fantastic 4</HD>
<DH>Dodger has a breakout game with four homers and record 19
total bases in 16-3 victory</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE DiGIOVANNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MILWAUKEE</DL>
<LD>Shawn Green came to the land of beer and bratwurst mired in the worst
slump of his eight-year career, a season-long slide that punctured
his reputation as one of the game's premier power hitters, shattered
his confidence and prompted fans in Dodger Stadium to boo him during
the last home stand.</LD>
<LD>   The Dodger right fielder left Milwaukee on Thursday with his name
etched alongside Hall of Famers such as Lou Gehrig, Willie Mays and
Mike Schmidt and plastered all over baseball's record books.</LD>
<LD>   Green enjoyed one of the most prolific single-game performances in
baseball history, smashing four home runs and amassing a major
league-record 19 total bases to lead the Dodgers to a 16-3
shellacking of the Milwaukee Brewers before 26,728 in Miller Park.</LD>
<TE>   When Green capped a six-hit, six-run, seven-RBI day with a
450-foot homer off reliever Jose Cabrera in the ninth inning, he
became only the 14th player in major league history to hit four home
runs in a game, a feat Seattle's Mike Cameron accomplished against
the Chicago White Sox on May 2 but has been done only five times in
the last 40 years.</TE>
<TE>   "That was awesome--it was like slow-motion when that last ball
went out," Dodger third-base coach Glenn Hoffman said. "I had goose
bumps. It gave me chills. To see a ball go out like that, it's
history, man....</TE>
<TE>   "I was like a kid watching him. I mean, how many years are you in
this game and you see a guy hit four home runs? That's the first time
for me. And he goes six for six on top of that? And 19 total bases?
That's a day."</TE>
<TE>   Green, who also doubled and singled for a career-high six hits,
broke Joe Adcock's total-base record of 18, set for the Milwaukee
Braves on July 31, 1954.</TE>
<TE>   Green's six runs set a Dodger franchise record and tied the modern
major league mark. His five extra-base hits tied a National League
record. His six hits were a career high and tied a franchise record.
His seven runs batted in tied his career high, and his four homers
helped the Dodgers set a franchise record for homers in a game with
eight.</TE>
<TE>   Not bad for a guy who went five consecutive games without hitting
a ball out of the infield last week.</TE>
<TE>   "It definitely hasn't sunk in yet," Green said. "I wish I had a
few days off so I could enjoy it. It's something I'll never
forget.... When Cameron [hit his four homers] I thought, 'Man, that's
a great couple of weeks right there.' No one in this game needed this
more than I did, because I was getting pretty down."</TE>
<TE>   Green had 49 home runs and 125 RBIs last season, but he spent the
first month and a half of 2002 in hibernation, leaving the Dodgers to
wonder almost wistfully: If we can go five or six games over .500
with so little production from our top batter, what will it be like
when Green starts hitting?</TE>
<TE>   They found out this week. Green entered the Milwaukee series in a
one-for-19 skid, batting .231 with three home runs. He homered twice
in an 8-6 loss Tuesday night, had an RBI triple in Wednesday night's
1-0 victory and capped the series with Thursday's memory maker,
giving him nine hits, six of them home runs, 10 RBIs, eight runs and
30 total bases in three games. He is batting .265.</TE>
<TE>   Green entered the series on a pace for 11 home runs this season.
After a three-run home run to right field off Glendon Rusch in the
second inning Thursday, a solo homer to right-center off Brian
Mallette in the fourth, a solo homer to left off Mallette in the
fifth and his final homer to right-center in the ninth, he is on pace
for 31 home runs.</TE>
<TE>   "The ball had been looking like a pingpong ball," Green said.
"Today, it probably looked like a softball. It slowed down a lot. The
last six weeks, the ball seemed to be going fast, and I was having a
tough time, jumping at pitches. Today, I was able to sit back and
wait for it."</TE>
<TE>   Green made history in blue-collar fashion, showing the same kind
of emotion that he did throughout his 11/2-month struggle. That is,
none.</TE>
<TE>   "He didn't show-boat or anything," Milwaukee coach Cecil Cooper
said. "He hit that last one, dropped his head, and that was it. He's
a classy kid."</TE>
<TE>   Though he rarely showed his frustration during the first seven
weeks--Green is not the type to slam bats to the ground or hurl
helmets--Manager Jim Tracy said Green has been churning inside all
season.</TE>
<TE>   But outside of benching Green for one game last Saturday, Tracy
never dropped him from the third or fourth spot in the order, and his
teammates never lost faith in him.</TE>
<TE>   "That was phenomenal," first baseman Eric Karros said of Green's
performance. "The funny thing is, four days ago everyone was ready to
write him off, and he got booed in L.A. That's why you can't
overreact to one game, one series, one week, even one month. People
who don't really know the game sometimes have a tendency to do that."</TE>
<TE>   Green began to iron out the mechanical problems in his swing and
build some confidence Tuesday night, when he homered twice.</TE>
<TE>   His ground-ball triple down the right-field line on a difficult
pitch Wednesday night fueled his comeback, and even though he also
struck out twice in that game Green said he "felt more in control of
my at-bats."</TE>
<TE>   There was no controlling Green on Thursday. His RBI double scored
the first of his team's three runs in the first inning. His three-run
homer highlighted a five-run second. With the game out of reach, he
began to relax even more at the plate.</TE>
<TE>   "The first night here, after my first home run, I thought, 'I
finally got one,'" Green said. "Then I hit another one and thought,
'OK, maybe I'm starting to catch on, and that first one wasn't a
fluke.' I felt my swing was where I wanted it to be, which is
something I hadn't felt all season.</TE>
<TE>   "Then I hit that triple [Wednesday] on the kind of inside pitch
that was eating me up all season. Little signs like that help you
realize that things are right."</TE>
<TE>   But the biggest signs were yet to come.</TE>
<TE>   "That was an amazing feat," Tracy said. "You can go to a lot of
games, and you won't see another offensive day like that by one
individual in a long time, if ever."</TE>

<LD>Sam Snead died Thursday, but that silken swing that may be the
sweetest in the history of golf will live forever in the memories of
anyone who saw Slammin' Sammy in action.</LD>
<LD>   The man with the straw hat, the jaunty stride down the fairway and
a swing for the ages won more tournaments than anyone, 81 official on
the PGA Tour, and an estimated 160 overall. His swing was so
unhampered by age, 17 of his Tour wins came after he was 40.</LD>
<LD>   Which shouldn't sound so remarkable considering he was still able
to touch the top of a door jamb with his foot when was in his 80s.</LD>
<TE>   Snead died four days shy of his 90th birthday at his home in Hot
Springs, Va.</TE>
<TE>   Although he won the Masters three times, the British Open once and
the PGA three times, he never won the U.S. Open, a fact that haunted
him until his death.</TE>
<TE>   He started playing the Tour in 1936, but California had a special
place in his career. In 1937, he arrived in California with $300 and
won what became known as the Bing Crosby Clambake at Rancho Santa Fe,
took the money and drove to Oakland, where he won again.</TE>
<TE>   I first saw Snead in 1950 at the Riviera Country Club. Ben Hogan
was making his miraculous comeback from a head-on collision with a
bus and was leading the Los Angeles Open when he finished his final
round. Snead was still on the course, needing to birdie the final two
holes to tie Hogan.</TE>
<TE>   He did it, forcing a playoff, which in those days was 18 holes.</TE>
<TE>   Hogan, sitting in the clubhouse chatting with reporters, just
shook his head and said, "Only Sam could have done that."</TE>
<TE>   The playoff was delayed more than a week because the players had
to get to Pebble Beach for the Crosby Pro-Am. When it was finally
held, Snead won easily in an anticlimactic round.</TE>
<TE>   Snead was on the other side of the ledger in 1974 when he and
young Dave Stockton were involved in a tense match entering the final
hole of another Los Angeles Open. It was Stockton who produced the
Snead-like heroics, hitting a 3-wood shot off the side of a hill more
than 250 yards away to win the match.</TE>
<TE>   Had Snead, 61, won, he would have become the oldest player to win
a PGA event--a record he established in 1965 when he won the Greater
Greensboro Open for a record eighth time when he was 52.</TE>
<TE>   Before there was a Jack Nicklaus or a Tiger Woods, Snead owned the
Masters. In addition to his three victories, he had nine finishes in
the top five and 15 in the top 10. When he was 61, he won the
par-three tournament at Augusta National that precedes the Masters.</TE>
<TE>   Woods was 6 when he met Snead during an exhibition at the naval
base course in Cypress. As the story goes, Woods was unable to clear
a narrow stream in front of a par-three and made a bogey after
playing out of the shallow water. Snead beat him with a par, but he
saw the makings of a future champion.</TE>
<TE>   "You watch his backswing, and it comes down on that same line,"
said Snead, the same line that marked his swing.</TE>
<TE>   Snead usually said what he meant. His most famous gaff came at St.
Andrews, where he had played and won his only British Open.</TE>
<TE>   He returned to St. Andrews in 2000 for an exhibition with former
winners. He regaled British writers with his memory of his earlier
visit to golf's hallowed grounds.</TE>
<TE>   "When the train pulled alongside the Old Course, it did not look
to me like it had ever had a [grass-cutting] machine on it. I turned
to the man next to me and asked, 'What abandoned course is this?'"</TE>
<TE>   If Snead had played a few years later, he undoubtedly would have
won the U.S. Open. In 1939 at the Philadelphia Country Club, he
thought he needed a birdie on the final hole to win. There were no
scoreboards on the course and all he needed was a par.</TE>
<TE>   Snead gambled to make up the stroke and hit his drive into the
rough, from where he took a triple bogey.</TE>
<TE>   In the 1947 Open he lost in a playoff with Lew Worsham when he
missed a 13-inch putt. In all, he finished second four times.</TE>
<TE>   The older he got, it seemed the better he got. Including the
Senior PGA Tour, which he helped launch by winning the inaugural
Legends of Golf in 1978 with Gardner Dickinson, Snead won tournaments
in six decades.</TE>
<TE>   In the second round of the 1979 Quad Cities Open, he became the
first Tour player to shoot his age, a 67 when he was 67. Two days
later he shot a 66.</TE>
<TE>   John Schlee, a U.S. Open runner-up in 1973, probably described
Snead best when he said, "Watching Sam Snead practice hitting golf
balls is like watching a fish practice swimming."</TE>

<HD>Bryant Has Healthy Approach to Game 3</HD>
<DH>Pro basketball: Laker guard returns to practice, saying he
feels fine after bout with food poisoning.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIM BROWN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Kobe Bryant made it through an entire practice Thursday afternoon
without requiring a mop, and then declared himself sort of healthy
and definitely well enough to play tonight, when the Lakers and
Sacramento Kings reconvene for Game 3 of the Western Conference
finals at Staples Center.</LD>
<LD>   The best-of-seven series is tied at a game apiece, the Lakers
having lost Game 2 in part because of a bad bacon cheeseburger Bryant
consumed while in Sacramento last weekend, or so it appeared.</LD>
<LD>   After trudging out of HealthSouth Center with his shoulders curled
and his face drawn Wednesday, Bryant was much more lively 24 hours
later at Staples Center. Along with participating in the required
practice, Bryant played a light game of half-court four-on-four
afterward, then shot free throws and ran by himself.</LD>
<TE>   He is on antibiotics and anti-cramp medication, a combination that
soothed his stomach and made him quite optimistic for Game 3.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel fine," he said. "I feel I can do everything I was doing
before I was sick. It's just a matter of getting my conditioning
back."</TE>
<TE>   While he admitted, "This is one of the tougher things I've had to
go through," he appeared stronger and more energetic than at any
point, pre-room service. He laughed politely at the terribly strained
attempts at humor by the dozens of media folks that ringed him, more
than could be asked even of a perfectly hale superstar.</TE>
<TE>   Asked if he had eaten anything recently, Bryant shook his head,
smiled and said, "I'm going to have a burger after this."</TE>
<TE>   The training staff has asked him to keep his intake simple, more
along the lines of the bread-rice-apple-toast diet, BRAT to the
parents of loose children everywhere, but he keeps threatening to
swing through the service window at McDonald's.</TE>
<TE>   In the throes of the food poisoning, Bryant scored 22 points in 40
wobbly legged minutes Monday, slept most of Tuesday, then regressed
Wednesday. He said he did not regret attempting to push himself in
Wednesday's practice. It is his nature, after all.</TE>
<TE>   "You never know," he said. "I'm going to have to run on it
eventually anyway. Might as well give it a test every day, see how I
felt. [Wednesday] I wasn't able to go. Today I feel fine."</TE>
<TE>   His post-practice sprints Thursday were an attempt to reclaim his
conditioning. He was understandably fatigued in parts of Monday's
game, and hadn't done much running since.</TE>
<TE>   "I won't know until I get out there," Bryant said. "I'll get a lot
of fluids in me. I was out here earlier running some lines, trying to
get my wind back, trying to get my legs back. Hopefully, [Friday]
I'll be ready."</TE>
<TE>   Laker Coach Phil Jackson, who might not admit concern anyway, said
Bryant eased into practice, but that he was active thereafter.</TE>
<TE>   "Well, he shot airballs at the start. It looked like he hadn't
played basketball in a summer," Jackson said. "But he got into it and
he was pretty good. We told him to have some chicken soup, he'd be
fine.</TE>
<TE>   "What I have to watch is how strong he is in the ... second half,
so he can finish the game strong. I'll just use that as a barometer."</TE>
<TE>   Often at his most aggressive in the final quarter, Bryant took two
shots and had three turnovers in nine fourth-quarter minutes Monday.
The Lakers went primarily to Shaquille O'Neal, who missed five of
seven shots and five of eight free-throw attempts, also in nine
minutes.</TE>
<TE>   "I've got to kind of pace myself, especially when I'm low on
energy the first, second, third quarters," Bryant said. "I'll just
try to pace myself a lot more than I normally do."</TE>
<TE>   It won't be easy against the Kings, who prefer a faster pace in
the most mundane circumstances.</TE>
<TE>   "They do what they do," Bryant said. "They have the perfect game
suited for somebody that's sick. They just run the hell out of you
anyway."</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers expect to find their usual Bryant tonight, along with
the rest of their usual game. They were disgusted by their decisions
in Game 2, taking 19 three-point shots (and missing 16). Rick Fox and
Robert Horry shot well, but Derek Fisher (one for nine) didn't, and
the bench provided little.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't lose that game because Kobe was shaky," O'Neal said.
"But we're at home now. Our chefs. Our food. Our wives. Some of the
people who were our fans a couple years ago have switched up. But
we're home now."</TE>
<TE>   Still, O'Neal said, "[Bryant] doesn't like to have two subpar
games in a row."</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers focused this week on getting the rest of the team
involved, in particular avoiding hindrances such as Monday's third
quarter, when they scored 17 points and put themselves in a deficit
they never made up.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers would like to have their old Bryant back, particularly
the one who does dynamic things in the fourth quarter and scores 30
points and drags defenses away from O'Neal. If not, they're pretty
sure they have a plan.</TE>
<TE>   "If we get the same effort from Kobe again, sick or not sick, and
we change things that we did that we shouldn't have done, or do them
better, then we win the game," Fox said.</TE>

<HD>Baldwin Admits to Inaccuracy</HD>
<DH>Olympics: Discrepancies in USOC president's biography
include Ph.D. degree she doesn't have.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ALAN ABRAHAMSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia</DL>
<LD>U.S. Olympic Committee President Sandra Baldwin acknowledged Thursday
discrepancies in the portrayal of her academic background, the most
serious the listing of a Ph.D. degree that she does not have. She
said she would not rule out resigning.</LD>
<LD>   Baldwin's USOC biography says she graduated from Colorado
University in 1962 with an English degree. In fact, she graduated
that year from Arizona State. She spent her freshman and sophomore
years at Colorado, then moved back to Arizona, where she is from, and
finished college at Arizona State.</LD>
<LD>   The bio also says she earned a doctorate in American literature in
1967 from Arizona State. She did not earn the degree, she said
Thursday. She said she never completed her dissertation.</LD>
<TE>   "Sometimes we do stupid things and I did something absolutely
stupid," Baldwin said in a telephone interview. "Stupid to have ever
gotten emotional enough to have ever put that in an old bio and worse
yet not to have made sure that when I did run for office it wasn't
out of there.</TE>
<TE>   "I certainly didn't do it for financial gain. I didn't do anything
to get a job."</TE>
<TE>   She added, "I'm trying today to pray and soul search about what I
think is the best thing to do, and I mean [in] a number of avenues
for the U.S. Olympic Committee and for me."</TE>
<TE>   The USOC's ruling executive committee hurriedly scheduled a
conference call for today. The issue is all but certain to be
referred to the USOC's ethics panel. In a letter she sent Thursday on
USOC stationery, addressed, "Dear Friends," she asserted, "I do not
feel I have hurt the credibility of the USOC. I have certainly hurt
my own, and I ask you to carefully consider the best course of action
for the organization."</TE>
<TE>   "I support her 110%," said Herb Perez of San Francisco, a member
of the executive committee and a 1992 Olympic gold medalist in tae
kwon do. "I think she had a lapse in judgment.</TE>
<TE>   "It's terrible. She came clean. She's tremendous for the
organization."</TE>
<TE>   But Michael McManus Jr. of Farmingdale, N.Y., an influential
public sector member of the USOC, said, "I'm afraid there's an awful
lot of precedent that's been established in situations like this
recently with regard to academicians and coaches. I think the
circumstances are such that what you've accomplished--which for Sandy
is considerable--probably doesn't outweigh the issues of credibility
and, to some extent, honesty."</TE>
<TE>   He also said he had spoken Thursday to Baldwin: "It's a question
in her mind, and some people's minds, as to whether it affects the
organization. Given some of the issues with regard to the Olympic
movement, and athletes, and issues with regard to drugs and some of
the things that happened around [the Winter Games in] Salt Lake--I
think we live in an environment where we have to be extremely
careful. I suspect that when you look at this and put it all
together, it's a great personal tragedy."</TE>
<TE>   McManus added, "The important thing is to treat Sandy fairly but
move on fairly quickly."</TE>
<TE>   Baldwin was elected to a four-year term in December 2000, the
first woman in more than a century of U.S. Olympic history to become
USOC president.</TE>
<TE>   In February, at the Salt Lake City Games, she was made an IOC
member by virtue of her status as USOC president. As a sign of her
increasing stature within the Olympic movement, and in recognition of
her push to expand U.S. influence and extend goodwill, particularly
in South and Latin America, she had already been tabbed by IOC
President Jacques Rogge to serve on key IOC committees.</TE>
<TE>   In recent months, Baldwin was also named a vice president of the
Assn. of National Olympic Committees.</TE>
<TE>   That body, which represents 199 national Olympic committees, is
meeting here this week. Baldwin and Lloyd Ward, the USOC's chief
executive, left Kuala Lumpur at noon on Wednesday, offering regrets
but no explanation.</TE>
<TE>   "When I saw her eyes, tearful, I thought it was something very
personal, very strong for her," Mario Vazquez Rana of Mexico,
president of the Assn. of National Olympic Committees, said Thursday.
"I said, 'Is anything wrong? Is there anything I can help with?' And
she said, 'No, it's something that demands my presence.'"</TE>
<TE>   Rogge, notified early today of the discrepancies in Baldwin's
biography, declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   What happens within the USOC is of keen significance to the IOC,
for the USOC is without question the most important of the world's
199 Olympic committees.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the IOC's top sponsors are based in the U.S. and the IOC's
chief financial underwriter is NBC, which is paying $3.5 billion to
televise the Games in the United States from 2000 through 2008.</TE>
<TE>   Based in Colorado Springs, Colo., the USOC--alone among all the
national Olympic committees--gets its own cut of NBC's Olympic
checks. The USOC's annual budget is about $115 million.</TE>
<TE>   For the first time in two decades, the USOC is facing the
challenge of attracting sponsors without the lure of a domestic Games
on the horizon.</TE>
<TE>   After Games in Lake Placid in 1980, Los Angeles in 1984, Atlanta
in 1996 and Salt Lake City in 2002, there will be no Olympics in the
U.S. until at least 2012--and perhaps longer.</TE>
<TE>   But, for a change, the two top slots in the USOC hierarchy seemed
settled.</TE>
<TE>   As president, Baldwin chairs the 21-vote executive committee,
which sets policy, and oversees the 119-member, all-volunteer board
of directors. CEO Ward, a reputed marketing guru who came to the USOC
last year, directs day-to-day operations.</TE>
<TE>   The disclosures about Baldwin's academic record, however, threaten
to plunge the USOC back into management turmoil and spark a revival
of the political infighting that often in recent years had become its
hallmark--deflecting focus from the athletes.</TE>
<TE>   When he took over in October, Ward became the USOC's 11th CEO (or
executive director, as the job used to be called) since 1978, when
Congress chartered the USOC. On average, the USOC has endured
turnover in that job about every two years for the last two decades.</TE>
<TE>   The presidency is an elected position. But it too has seen
unexpected turnover. In 1991, Robert Helmick, who at the time was an
IOC member, USOC president and a rising star within the Olympic
movement, resigned his posts amid allegations of conflict of
interest.</TE>
<TE>   Baldwin, an Arizona real estate executive, was elected USOC
president after serving as chief of the U.S. team in Sydney and as
president of USA Shooting and USA Swimming.</TE>
<TE>   The day she was elected USOC president, she recounted her life
story for a small knot of reporters. She even cheerfully provided the
title of her doctoral dissertation: "Neo-Classical Backgrounds of
Nathaniel Hawthorne's Aesthetics."</TE>
<TE>   Questions emerged about Baldwin's biography after a student at
Colorado, inspired by a speech a few weeks ago at the school that
detailed Baldwin's exploits, decided to write a feature about Baldwin
as a prominent alumna--only to find out she had not graduated from
the university.</TE>
<TE>   The issue built behind the scenes until Wednesday, when
Baldwin--and Ward--left Malaysia to come home.</TE>
<TE>   Asked why she had put incorrect information in her biography,
Baldwin offered no explanation. She also offered no excuse. She said,
"I'm sorry," and added, "It's inexcusable."</TE>

<TE>   (BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX)</TE>
<TE>   Upheaval by Committee</TE>
<TE>   Turmoil within the U.S. Olympic Committee since 1985:</TE>
<TE>   Feb. 10, 1985--F. Don Miller retires after 12 years as executive
director. Replaced by George Miller (no relation). John B. Kelly Jr.,
brother of Princess Grace of Monaco, elected president.</TE>
<TE>   March 2, 1985--Kelly, 57, dies of a heart attack while jogging.</TE>
<TE>   August 23, 1987--George Miller pressured to resign as executive
director. Baaron Pittenger becomes interim executive director.</TE>
<TE>   Oct. 24, 1987--Harvey Schiller, commissioner of the Southeastern

11/2 years, we've done it for eight or 12 or even 16 years,"
President Robert Helmick says.</TE>
<TE>   Jan. 20, 1989--Seventeen days after moving into USOC headquarters
in Colorado Springs, Schiller resigns, citing personal and family
reasons, and returns to the SEC. He tells a friend that the USOC job
is like "tacking Jell-O on a wall. There is an awful lot of
responsibility without a lot of authority." Pittenger becomes
executive director.</TE>
<TE>   Oct. 21, 1989--Schiller returns to replace Pittenger, whose
contract isn't extended.</TE>
<TE>   Aug. 22, 1990--USOC Vice President George Steinbrenner, upon his
suspension as owner of the Yankees because of dealings with alleged
gambler Howard Spira, is suspended indefinitely by the USOC.
Reinstated in February 1991.</TE>
<TE>   Sept. 18, 1991--Helmick resigns as president amid
conflict-of-interest allegations. Later resigns as member of the
International Olympic Committee.</TE>
<TE>   July 25, 1994--Schiller resigns as executive director to become
president of Turner Sports. Replaced by Dick Schultz.</TE>
<TE>   Jan. 14, 1999--Alfredo LaMont resigns as senior director of
international relations, later pleads guilty to two felony tax counts
in connection with the Salt Lake City bid scandal.</TE>
<TE>   Dec. 3, 2000--Sandra Baldwin elected first woman president.</TE>
<TE>   Feb. 4, 2000--Norman Blake, known as a corporate turnaround
artist, replaces Schultz, whose contract expired, as chief executive.</TE>
<TE>   Oct. 25, 2000--Blake resigns because of a lack of organizational
support.</TE>
<TE>   Oct. 21, 2001--Lloyd Ward named CEO.</TE>
<TE>   May 22, 2002--Baldwin abruptly returns home from a meeting in
Malaysia to answer questions about her resume.</TE>

<LD>The four words swept across the Southland on Thursday afternoon like
a summer breeze, a baseball breeze.</LD>
<LD>   So where were you?</LD>
<LD>   I was at Staples Center, at Laker practice, standing in the rear
at the Church of Phil, his daily homily about stripe-shirted serpents
nearly complete, when my cell phone rang.</LD>
<TE>   "Shawn Green hit four," said the voice on the other end.</TE>
<TE>   I walked away, sat down, and repeated the words back for
confirmation.</TE>
<TE>   Didn't you? Didn't everybody?</TE>
<TE>   Shawn Green hit four?</TE>
<TE>   The same Shawn Green who was benched last week because he couldn't
hit squat?</TE>
<TE>   The same Shawn Green who has yet to prove he can hit outside the
shadow of Carlos Delgado or Gary Sheffield?</TE>
<TE>   The same Shawn Green who was ripped by my friend one day earlier
while we waited to pick up our children from school?</TE>
<TE>   She said she loved watching the Dodgers but could no longer stand
watching the underachieving Green.</TE>
<TE>   I've heard that before. I've heard that everywhere.</TE>
<TE>   I rushed home from Staples Center, and waiting for me was another
phone call, from that friend, eating her words.</TE>
<TE>   Anybody call you?</TE>
<TE>   This is what baseball does better than any sport. It sneaks up. It
surprises. It can drag you out of a gym during the middle of the NBA
playoffs. It can make you phone somebody in the middle of the day.</TE>
<TE>   Just when you are ready to throw your hands up over the thought of
a labor strike, at the home of the commissioner who would preside
over that strike, the grandest game sucks you in all over again.</TE>
<TE>   Shawn Green's four home runs, six runs scored, seven RBIs and a
record 19 total bases against the Milwaukee Brewers represent the
greatest batting performance in the history of baseball.</TE>
<TE>   It's not one of the greatest, it's the greatest.</TE>
<TE>   Better than anything dreamed up by Babe Ruth. Better than anything
schemed by Ty Cobb. Better than the best of Joltin' Joe, and Teddy
Ballgame, and the Say-Hey Kid, and Hammerin' Hank and even Mighty
Mike Cameron.</TE>
<TE>   In a game that wasn't even televised in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   On a day when most folks in town are busy paying attention to
basketball.</TE>
<TE>   In front of, by the ninth inning, what appeared to be only a
couple of thousand fans.</TE>
<TE>   In what other sport can surroundings so common produce something
so special?</TE>
<TE>   Ira Green, Shawn's father and former batting coach, didn't even
know about it until he heard his son giving a postgame interview.</TE>
<TE>   "The game wasn't on TV, so I played golf," recalled Ira, who runs
an Orange County baseball academy. "We finished about 1:30, turned on
the radio driving home, heard Ross Porter mention four home runs, and
I thought, what?"</TE>
<TE>   Shortly after he arrived home, the phone rang.</TE>
<TE>   It was his son, in Milwaukee, preparing to board the plane for
Arizona.</TE>
<TE>   "How are you doing?" Ira said.</TE>
<TE>   "How do you think I'm doing?'' Shawn said.</TE>
<TE>   They spoke for 20 minutes, but said little about Shawn's records
or the Dodgers' 16-3 victory.</TE>
<TE>   "It was all too surreal," Ira said. "I just don't think it had
sunk in yet."</TE>
<TE>   Besides, father and son have talked enough about baseball
recently.</TE>
<TE>   "More in the last couple of weeks than we've talked in a long
time," Ira said. "Shawn calls me more when he's struggling. So,
lately, he's called a lot."</TE>
<TE>   Ira said he no longer gives specific advice. Perhaps this is
because his son is getting too much specific advice.</TE>
<TE>   "My son is very receptive, and all these things go into his head,"
Ira said.</TE>
<TE>   One of this town's classiest athletes is actually too nice. Shawn
listens to too many people. He tries too hard to please.</TE>
<TE>   Leaders are not made from those so eager to follow.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes, when you bottom out, you just have to say, 'The hell
with everybody' and go do it on your own," Ira said.</TE>
<TE>   By all indications, Green said that last weekend, in the middle of
an 0-for-18 slump, after he was benched for a Saturday game against
the Montreal Expos.</TE>
<TE>   He asked to be put back into the lineup Sunday. Manager Jim Tracy
relented.</TE>
<TE>   In the ninth inning, hitless again, he came to the plate against
former Dodger Matt Herges. They are close friends. Herges was
spending the weekend at Green's house. Their wives were sitting
together in the stands.</TE>
<TE>   This was a perfect time for a nice guy to take a powder.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, Green ripped a double.</TE>
<TE>   "That's where it started," his father said. "That's where Shawn
started getting his feel back."</TE>
<TE>   Imagine that. Amid a Laker run of power and athleticism, the town
is again mesmerized by feel. Baseball does that.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, some Dodger fans will look at Thursday and scoff. Shawn
Green always hits well when the game is decided and nobody is
watching and the pitching is horrible, right?</TE>
<TE>   Other Dodger fans will look at Thursday and celebrate. The Dodger
pitching staff is only a couple of those big swings away from
carrying this team to the playoffs, right?</TE>
<TE>   The thing about baseball is, both opinions are right, and both
opinions are wrong, and both are only as good as this weekend's
starting pitching.</TE>
<TE>   It's wonderful that Shawn Green pulled out of his slump by
swatting away the ghosts of Babe Ruth and Ty Cobb.</TE>
<TE>   It will be better if he can keep it going against the reality of
Curt Schilling and Randy Johnson.</TE>

<HD>6 Reportedly Killed in Afghan Factional Clash</HD>
<DH>Asia: Spokesman for one side denies any fighting occurred,
as a news agency asserts.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>ISLAMABAD, Pakistan</DL>
<LD>At least six people were killed in fighting between forces loyal to
Afghanistan's defense minister and soldiers allied with his deputy, a
Pakistani-based Afghan news agency said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   But a spokesman for one faction denied that there had been any
such clashes, which the Afghan Islamic Press agency said erupted
Wednesday night in Zal, about 40 miles west of the northern Afghan
city of Kunduz.</LD>
<LD>   The news agency, quoting sources in the area, said fighting still
raged Thursday between forces loyal to Defense Minister Gen. Mohammed
Qassim Fahim and those allied with his deputy, Gen. Abdul Rashid
Dostum. It said an unspecified number of fighters had been wounded.</LD>
<TE>   It said Dostum's forces attacked Zal Fort but that Fahim's
Jamiat-i-Islami group repulsed the attack.</TE>
<TE>   But Dostum spokesman Faizullah Zaki said, "There has been no
fighting at all." The news agency said that the divided forces had
clashed frequently in the past. It quoted a Jamiat source as saying
250 fighters had been sent to Zal on Thursday morning to reinforce
the town's defenses and evict any Dostum troops.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, a British surveillance group of Royal Marines was
involved in a firefight in eastern Afghanistan on Thursday, in its
first direct engagement with suspected enemy fighters, a marine
spokesman said.</TE>
<TE>   At least two enemy fighters were hit, but their fate was not
clear, marine spokesman Lt. Col. Ben Curry said at the allied
headquarters at Bagram air base, north of Kabul, the capital.</TE>
<TE>   Ten rounds were fired at the covert marine surveillance group in
the troubled Khowst region after a car carrying three men pulled up
near their post, Curry said. "We fired back in self-defense. At least
two people were hit," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Curry said a second car arrived and evacuated two casualties. No
one in the 12-member marine observation team was hurt.</TE>
<TE>   Also Thursday, more than 500 Taliban followers captured during the
U.S.-led military campaign last year were freed, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   The mass release from the Sheberghan prison in northern
Afghanistan was in compliance with an order issued by interim Prime
Minister Hamid Karzai.</TE>

<HD>Iranian Police Throw a Veil Over Barbie</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>TEHRAN</DL>
<LD>The suspect fits the following description: slim, curvaceous,
perpetual smile, no head scarf. Goes by the name Barbie.</LD>
<LD>   Iranian police are combing the shelves for the perky ambassador of
American culture. The doll's uneasy sojourn in this Islamic country
could be drawing to a close.</LD>
<LD>   Authorities have been confiscating Barbie from stores since a
vague proclamation this month denouncing the un-Islamic sensibilities
of the idol of girls worldwide, shopkeepers said this week.</LD>
<TE>   "They took them all," said a toy seller whose shop window is
plastered with the flower-shaped Barbie logo. "I have no idea if
we'll ever see Barbie back again."</TE>
<TE>   The woman refused to give her name, fearing trouble with police.</TE>
<TE>   It's not the first time Barbie has run afoul of authorities. In
1996, the head of a government-backed children's agency called Barbie
a "Trojan horse" sneaking in Western influences such as makeup.</TE>
<TE>   In March, Iranian toy makers responded to Barbie with Sara, a doll
clad in traditional clothing.</TE>
<TE>   Barbie is a bestseller despite the cost: about $40, in a nation
where the average monthly salary is about $100.</TE>

<HD>Russia-Iran Ties Clouding Bush Visit</HD>
<DH>Europe: After making his case to Germans for the war on
terrorism, president arrives in Moscow to sign an arms-reduction
treaty.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES GERSTENZANG and CAROL J. WILLIAMS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>MOSCOW</DL>
<LD>President Bush arrived in Moscow on Thursday prepared to challenge
Russian assistance to Iran's nuclear development, after telling
Germans that in the war against terrorism "we defend not just America
or Europe, we are defending civilization itself."</LD>
<LD>   The president linked the war to Germany's history of overcoming
Nazism and communism--and, indeed, to Europe's march toward democracy
during the 20th century.</LD>
<LD>   "Others killed in the name of racial purity or the class
struggle," Bush said. "These enemies kill in the name of a false
religious purity, perverting the faith they claim to hold."</LD>
<TE>   Bush's campaign for the broadest support in carrying the battle
against terrorism beyond Afghanistan, voiced during a speech to the
German Parliament in Berlin, went to the heart of European
skittishness over the best way to contain Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   And the president's pointed statement that an Iran equipped with
nuclear weapons could aim its warheads at Moscow suggested that
although the evolving U.S.-Russian relationship has overcome the
animosities of the Cold War, it has not eliminated all troublesome
differences.</TE>
<TE>   The centerpiece of the visit to Moscow, however, will be the
signing this afternoon of a quickly negotiated treaty barely three
pages long that commits the United States and Russia to cutting their
arsenals of deployed nuclear warheads by two-thirds, from roughly
6,000 to no more than 2,200, by the end of 2012.</TE>
<TE>   Bush, making his first visit to Russia, arrived at Moscow's
Vnukovo Airport in the sunshine of the spring evening and, with
little ceremony, headed to his hotel about half a mile from the
Kremlin.</TE>
<TE>   Against the backdrop of arms reduction, Bush's meetings in Germany
and Russia are serving notice that some of the most difficult
diplomatic moments the president faces may come not from historic
opponents in Moscow but from politically independent Western allies.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, minutes into the speech to the Bundestag, or lower house
of the German Parliament, several lawmakers in the section where
members of the former Communist Party sit unveiled a banner directing
Bush and Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder to "Stop Your Wars."</TE>
<TE>   And Wolfgang Thierse, the president of the lower house, used his
introduction of Bush to call on the U.S. to adhere to the course
mapped out in the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, the global warming agreement
Bush has rejected. Facing the president, Thierse also chastised the
U.S. for rejecting an agreement to create the International Criminal
Court.</TE>
<TE>   Such comments clearly define the different ways Europe and the
U.S. appear to see the challenges they face. For his part, Bush
focused largely on the role of Europe, including Russia, in fighting
not just the immediate war on terrorism but the threat posed by
weapons of mass destruction--nuclear, biological and chemical--held
by "rogue" nations or terrorists.</TE>
<TE>   At a news conference with Schroeder, Bush said he will make the
case with Russian President Vladimir V. Putin, with whom he meets
today and Saturday, that "if you arm Iran, you're liable to get the
weapons pointed at you; that you've got to be careful in dealing with
a country like Iran."</TE>
<TE>   Russia is working with Iran on a multibillion-dollar project to
develop a nuclear power plant in the city of Bushehr. U.S.
intelligence experts fear that the technology could be put to
military uses, producing enriched uranium for a nuclear weapon.</TE>
<TE>   Iran "is run by a group of extremists who fund terrorist activity,
who clearly hate our mutual friend, Israel," Bush said. "Russia needs
to be concerned about proliferation into a country that might view
them as an enemy at some point in time. And if Iran gets a weapon of
mass destruction, deliverable by a missile, that's going to be a
problem ... for all of us, including Russia.</TE>
<TE>   "We've got a lot of work to do with Russia," he added.</TE>
<TE>   Russian Foreign Minister Igor S. Ivanov offered an immediate
protest. "Russia sticks firmly to its international obligations, and
we have repeatedly told the United States this," he said in a
television interview before Bush arrived.</TE>
<TE>   A senior Bush administration official, speaking to reporters
aboard Air Force One on the flight to Moscow, said the Russian
program with Iran represented the greatest nuclear proliferation
threat.</TE>
<TE>   The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the U.S.
hopes to solve the problem by persuading Russia to scale down its
cooperation with Iran.</TE>
<TE>   Bush's visit prompted several demonstrations in Moscow on
Thursday, as well as a heightened police presence. Several hundred
protesters, most of them aligned with the Communist Party, burned
American flags in front of the U.S. Embassy.</TE>
<TE>   Critics have complained that the arms agreement Bush and Putin
will sign does not order the destruction of the warheads that will be
decommissioned and stored, creating an inviting quarry for
terrorists.</TE>
<TE>   "Would you rather have them on the launchers? Would you rather
have the warheads pointed at people? I would think not," Bush said.</TE>
<TE>   The president said the major Western democracies were working to
create a $20-billion fund, half supplied by the U.S., to secure
stored warheads.</TE>
<TE>   Bush spoke to the German Parliament at the Reichstag. Although
rebuilt on the inside, the structure has kept its 19th century
exterior, with its dedication--"Dem Deutschen Volke" (To the German
People)--carved over the entrance. The building evokes Nazi history;
Adolf Hitler used an act of arson there as a reason to crack down on
his opponents.</TE>
<TE>   For a second day, central Berlin was turned eerily silent, all
traffic and most pedestrians banned for security reasons.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday night and Thursday morning, a demonstration beyond
the secured zone grew to about 20,000 people. Skirmishes erupted
between protesters and police, who used water cannons to disperse the
demonstrators. Rocks, sticks and bottles slightly injured 44 police
officers. Fifty-eight people were detained.</TE>
<TE>   Bush made no mention of the opposition in the streets. But he used
his speech to present not just a defense of the direction in which he
is trying to lead the U.S. and its allies, but also to warn that
ignoring the threats exposed by the Sept. 11 attacks is akin to
overlooking the Holocaust or appeasing Germany as it occupied new
lands before World War II.</TE>
<TE>   "Those who despise human freedom will attack it on every
continent," he said. "Those who seek missiles and terrible weapons
are also familiar with the map of Europe. Like the threats of another
era, this threat cannot be appeased or cannot be ignored."</TE>
<TE>   The president's enunciation of the moral foundation of the war
against terrorism is familiar to American audiences. But the speech
offered Bush a rare opportunity to deliver that message to an
audience of leaders in Europe, where public opinion is less
supportive of the military campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Placing that campaign in the context of European history, the
president referred to an undivided, free Europe living in peace, and
said, "This dream of the centuries is close at hand."</TE>
<TE>   Bush said the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, born to defend
the West against the Soviet Union, finds itself with a defining
purpose of self-defense that is "as urgent as ever"--the cooperative
fight against global terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   Repeatedly, his audience broke into restrained applause, seconding
nearly every reference he made to the pursuit of peace. The audience
generally showed less enthusiasm when he called for standing
steadfast in the war on terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   With efforts to prevent the spread of weapons of mass destruction
a central element in his foreign policy agenda, Bush warned that
terrorist-sponsoring nations are developing nuclear, chemical and
biological arms "and the missiles to deliver them."</TE>
<TE>   "If we ignore this threat," he said, "we invite certain blackmail
and place millions of our citizens in grave danger."</TE>
<TE>   Bush's call for resolute action against Iraq drew a cool but
polite reaction across the German political spectrum.</TE>
<TE>   Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer, the senior member of the
pacifist Greens Party in Schroeder's coalition government, praised
Bush's promise to use a variety of means, including financial
pressures as well as military operations, to fight terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   Bavarian Gov. Edmund Stoiber, leader of the Christian Social
Union, who is challenging Schroeder for the chancellery in Sept. 22
elections, lauded Bush's address for respecting differences of
opinion expressed by European allies.</TE>

<LD>Excerpts from President Bush's speech Thursday before the German
Bundestag:</LD>
<LD>   After the Cold War, during the relative quiet of the 1990s, some
questioned whether our transatlantic partnership still had a purpose.
History has given its answer.</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<TE>   Together, we oppose an enemy that thrives on violence and the
grief of the innocent. The terrorists are defined by their hatreds.
They hate democracy and tolerance and free expression and women and
Jews and Christians and all Muslims who disagree with them. Others
killed in the name of racial purity or the class struggle. These
enemies kill in the name of a false religious purity, perverting the
faith they claim to hold. In this war, we defend not just America or
Europe, we are defending civilization itself.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The authors of terror are seeking nuclear, chemical and biological
weapons. Regimes that sponsor terror are developing these weapons and
the missiles to deliver them. If these regimes and their terrorist
allies were to perfect these capabilities, no inner voice of reason,
no hint of conscience would prevent their use. Wishful thinking might
bring comfort, but not security.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Ours is the first generation in 100 years that does not expect and
does not fear the next European war. And that achievement, your
achievement, is one of the greatest in modern times. When Europe
grows in unity, Europe and America grow in security.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   NATO must be able and willing to act whenever threats emerge. This
will require all the assets of modern defense: mobile and deployable
forces, sophisticated special operations, the ability to fight under
the threat of chemical and biological weapons.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   We must continue to stand for peace in the Middle East. That peace
must assure the permanent safety of the Jewish people. And that peace
must provide the Palestinian people with a state of their own.</TE>

<HD>Afghans Get Acts Together</HD>
<DH>Secretly conceived projects are seeing the light of day,
as the artistic community reemerges with the first post- Taliban
film, which was shot for $300.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBYN DIXON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>KABUL, Afghanistan</DL>
<LD>Abdul Hamid Ghaznawee dreamed of becoming Afghanistan's "Arnold"--a
new action star like Schwarzenegger. As long as the Taliban was in
power, he kept this ambition secret, like the videos he watched at
home.</LD>
<LD>   But as soon as the radical Islamic regime was toppled and its ban
on film and television lifted, the 17-year-old showed up at the
studios of Afghan Film, looking for a movie role.</LD>
<LD>   His act of naive optimism paid off. Ghaznawee landed the leading
part in "Teardrops," the first Afghan film of the post-Taliban era.
The movie, shot on a $300 budget, describes a young man's descent
into drug addiction. It will air on Afghan television soon.</LD>
<TE>   As the country leaves behind a generation of occupation and war,
the Afghan film scene is witnessing a burst of creative energy.
Poets, screenwriters and directors are emerging as if from a dark
age, talking excitedly of projects conceived in secret during the
rule of the mullahs.</TE>
<TE>   Writers who worked furtively on scripts, hiding them even from
family members, are out in the open again, seeking backers for their
inspirations. Directors are shooting films, or planning them. The
works range from a Taliban love story with a tragic ending to the
tale of a girl desperate to go to school.</TE>
<TE>   This outpouring represents an artistic chronicle of the Taliban
years, a meditation on what the country endured and how it was
changed. Because money is scarce, many of the films under discussion
won't be made soon, if ever. But the act of imagining them seems to
have been cathartic for an artistic community long repressed or
ignored.</TE>
<TE>   Shermohammad, a well-known Afghan screenwriter, secretly defied
the Taliban for years, working on screenplays and poetry in his home.</TE>
<TE>   "Film is very important in Afghanistan now because most people
cannot read or write," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The writer, who, like many Afghans, uses just one name, tried to
witness all the major events under the Islamic regime so that he
could faithfully record them. He made sure he was at the parades, the
executions, the public amputations of hands and feet.</TE>
<TE>   He wrote haiku about what he saw. One describes the severed hands
of convicted robbers hanging in the street, dripping blood,
attracting flies. Another is about Taliban police beating women in
the street.</TE>
<TE>   Shermohammad is trying to interest directors in a screenplay about
a forbidden love affair between a Taliban fighter and a young woman
from Kabul, the capital. With the Taliban facing defeat, the fighter
tries to hide in the woman's house, but her father chases him into
the street. In the final scene, she watches from a rooftop as an
angry mob drags him away to be killed.</TE>
<TE>   Shermohammad based the denouement on events he witnessed Nov. 13,
the day the Taliban fled the city.</TE>
<TE>   He got up early that day and cycled into the center of Kabul with
his camera. He saw three Taliban fighters in a park, terrified,
shooting at anyone who approached.</TE>
<TE>   On another street, he saw several Talibs and people who he thought
were Chechens--Islamic resistance fighters from the separatist
Russian republic. A crowd was beating them. Then a man walked up with
a gun.</TE>
<TE>   "He just shot the Chechens in the head and killed them,"
Shermohammad said.</TE>
<TE>   Siddiq Barmak, 39, head of Afghan Film, a private production
company in Kabul, has a clutch of screenplays created by young
writers during the Taliban years.</TE>
<TE>   One stood out--the story of a girl who isn't allowed to go to
school under the Taliban. She cuts her beloved hair and disguises
herself as a boy. Then she is discovered by the religious police and
beaten so badly that she becomes mute.</TE>
<TE>   Barmak, who trained in the Soviet Union as a filmmaker, says the
screenplay is based on a true story. He plans to make the film--if he
can raise the money.</TE>
<TE>   "We started to work on the story. We added an American woman
character who is looking for poor people, to help them," Barmak said,
with all the pragmatism of a Hollywood director.</TE>
<TE>   "Teardrops," with 64 mostly amateur actors, is about the downfall
of a diligent and popular young man who rises at 5 a.m. each day to
pray and study. Then he starts sleeping late and getting into fights
at school. His parents and teachers are mystified--until his father
discovers his son among drug addicts in the war ruins of southern
Kabul. The final shot shows the son's face, wet with tears.</TE>
<TE>   Ismail Azhir, 46, wrote the script during the Taliban era, taking
elaborate precautions to avoid being found out.</TE>
<TE>   "I kept the screenplay safely hidden in a false-bottomed drawer,"
said Azhir, who is head of the film department of Afghan Radio and
Television. "No one else saw the place, not even my family. But even
so, I kept the dangerous and important scenes only in my memory."</TE>
<TE>   An anti-drug film such as "Teardrops" was risky, he said, because
the Taliban, for part of its rule, allowed opium cultivation and
trade.</TE>
<TE>   "I was full of hope when I was writing that story," he said. "I
did believe the Taliban regime would be deposed, that there would be
a new regime under which I could work and make my film a reality."</TE>
<TE>   Before and even during Afghanistan's long decades of war, the
country had a film industry. Women appeared on screen without
covering their faces. Afghan producers, scriptwriters and directors
boast that their movies were distinct from those produced by
"Bollywood," the Indian film industry that dominates the region.
Afghan films, they say, were more serious, taking on tough social
issues rather than light romantic themes.</TE>
<TE>   Filmmakers continued their work as successive coups, a decade-long
Soviet occupation and civil war shattered the country beginning in
1973. "Oruj," made in 1995, celebrated the triumph of the moujahedeen
over the Soviet occupiers.</TE>
<TE>   A year later, the Taliban came to power, and painting, filmmaking
and other forms of artistic expression were prohibited as idolatrous.</TE>
<TE>   Since the collapse of the fundamentalist Islamic regime, movie
theaters have reopened across Kabul, showing mostly old Indian and
Iranian films on old Russian projectors. Afghanistan's native film
industry also is getting back on its feet, albeit slowly.</TE>
<TE>   The making of "Teardrops" was plagued by electrical blackouts,
equipment failures and other problems from start to finish. The
actors, all beginners, had to be trained from scratch, on the set.
There were no rehearsals. The production equipment consisted of one
borrowed camera and an ancient floodlight, held aloft with a
quivering arm by the light man.</TE>
<TE>   "They didn't have the proper substance for the scene where I had a
bloody nose," said Ghaznawee, the teenage actor. "They used red
paint."</TE>
<TE>   The most difficult task was finding actresses willing to go before
the camera without their burkas, the full-length covering most Afghan
women still wear.</TE>
<TE>   "We used to have a lot of actresses. But five years of the Taliban
changed a lot, especially women," Azhir said. "It's difficult for
them to remove their burkas and go on a film."</TE>
<TE>   The filmmakers approached a famous Afghan female singer about
playing the part of the mother. The singer demanded $500 to
appear--more than the film's entire budget. They turned her down.</TE>
<TE>   Then they found a woman who seemed happy to play the part--until
she saw the man who would play her husband and changed her mind,
without explanation.</TE>
<TE>   Director Bahram Baryal finally cast Torpekai Sangeen, an Afghan
woman who had lived in Germany for many years and was used to going
out without a burka.</TE>
<TE>   The role of a nurse who was to supposed to provide the film's
romantic interest was cut from the script because no actress could be
found to play the part.</TE>
<TE>   On the set, the interaction between director and cast reflected
Afghanistan's patriarchal society. Baryal, a diminutive man of 47,
speaks so softly that it is difficult to hear him at times. But
Ghaznawee found him intimidating.</TE>
<TE>   "Whatever he said, I obeyed," Ghaznawee said. "Once he was upset
about my acting. There was a scene where I was supposed to be angry
with my sister, but I couldn't do it the first time. He was outraged
and I was frightened, and the second time I did it very well."</TE>
<TE>   During filming of the final scenes at a Kabul high school in
April, an extension cord blew out. The light cord was so short that
light man David Mohammad couldn't hold the heavy floodlight steady.
Shadows danced on the wall behind the actors.</TE>
<TE>   "Why is the light shaking so much?" the director asked in a
reproving tone.</TE>
<TE>   A boy hastened his repair of the extension cord, unscrewing the
power socket with a key for lack of a screwdriver.</TE>
<TE>   The director kept shooting, despite the jumping shadows. A few
minutes later, the power went out.</TE>
<TE>   Later, Baryal, who will be paid the equivalent of $10, said, "If
Arnold could help us, it would be good." He was referring, of course,
to Schwarzenegger, who is huge in Afghanistan, his portrait bedecking
many bodybuilding studios.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the difficulties, Baryal said it felt good to make
Afghanistan's first post-Taliban film.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm proud of it because I guess we have found a second life," he
said. "I feel like I've been born again."</TE>

<HD>Israeli Ruling Puts a Freeze on Family Ties</HD>
<DH>Mideast: The decision, called racist by some, keeps
Palestinians from Israeli Arab spouses.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVAN MAHARAJ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM</DL>
<LD>Bassam Mahedawi, a 31-year-old West Bank resident, dreams about the
day he can finally live with his wife and two children.</LD>
<LD>   They are separated by just two miles, but it might as well be a
continent. Mahedawi lives in a village near the town of Tulkarm. His
wife, Maha Salamah, is an Israeli citizen who lives with their two
sons--ages 2 and 1--across the Green Line that separates the West
Bank from Israel.</LD>
<LD>   The gulf between them widened this month when the Israeli Cabinet
decided to freeze family reunification requests, preventing Israeli
Arabs from reuniting with family members who live in the West Bank
and Gaza Strip. The decision in effect separates thousands of
families, keeping children from their parents and spouses from each
other.</LD>
<TE>   Granting residency permits to Palestinians would make it easy for
suicide bombers to infiltrate Israel and launch more attacks against
civilians, Interior Minister Eli Yishai, an ultra-Orthodox political
leader, said before he was unseated Monday in a political struggle.</TE>
<TE>   Yishai, who pushed for the ban, said he wanted to keep
Palestinians and other non-Jews out of Israel because their
increasing numbers threaten the Jewish character of the state.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli human rights lawyers called the government's decision
racist, saying it amounted to collective punishment against Arabs.</TE>
<TE>   "It is unbelievable that Israel is taking this position," said
Sharon Abraham Weiss, an attorney with the Assn. for Civil Rights in
Israel, which is challenging the Cabinet decision. "Imagine if I have
two children with a French guy, and the immigration authorities in
France tell me that 'you and your kids cannot come here to live with
their father because we've decided not to let any Jews in.'"</TE>
<TE>   Arabs, who make up nearly a fifth of Israel's population, say the
freezing of family reunification requests is the latest attack on
their citizenship--and their dignity. Recently, top Israeli leaders
have said that residents of Israeli Arab towns near the Green Line
would no longer be Israeli citizens if Israel decided to cede their
communities to a future Palestinian state.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a genuine feeling among the Arabs that they have been
pushed to the margins of Israeli society," said Shuweiki Hatib,
chairman of the National Arab Monitoring Committee, the main Israeli
Arab group.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli Arabs say their connection to the West Bank dates back
generations. After Israel declared its independence in 1948--and the
cease-fire line later known as the Green Line was drawn--Arabs within
Israel's borders became citizens while their relatives and friends in
the West Bank and Gaza remained stateless.</TE>
<TE>   Mahedawi and Salamah met in early 1998 when she and her uncle came
to shop at Mahedawi's horse farm. They married a few weeks later--on
April 4, 1998.</TE>
<TE>   On her wedding day, Salamah became a bride and a virtual widow,
she said. Salamah and her new husband spent only a few weeks together
in their first two years of marriage, she said.</TE>
<TE>   Shortly after their wedding, Salamah applied to the Israeli
immigration authorities for Mahedawi to join her in Israel. The
Interior Ministry gave her no explanation why the application wasn't
being approved, she said.</TE>
<TE>   It didn't help matters when Mahedawi rode his horse to visit her a
few months after their wedding and police arrested him for being in
Israel without a permit.</TE>
<TE>   After his arrest, the couple decided that Salamah would travel to
the West Bank to see Mahedawi.</TE>
<TE>   With her two children in tow, Salamah now traverses unpaved dirt
roads to get around military checkpoints that prevent Israeli
citizens from entering the West Bank.</TE>
<TE>   The trip has become so tedious that, Salamah said, she visits her
husband's home only every six weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever hopes Salamah and Mahedawi nurtured of living together
evaporated this month when the Cabinet unanimously voted to freeze
all family reunification requests involving Arabs.</TE>
<TE>   Salamah and Mahedawi were devastated.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to be with him," Salamah said. "I got married so I
wouldn't be alone."</TE>
<TE>   Mahedawi said he can no longer afford to talk regularly on the
phone with his wife because he is unemployed. His horse farm lost all
its Israeli customers and went out of business after the Palestinian
uprising broke out 20 months ago.</TE>
<TE>   He agonizes about not being able to see his sons take their first
step or utter their first words.</TE>
<TE>   "Whenever they see me," he said, "they think I'm a stranger."</TE>
<TE>   Why doesn't Salamah move to the West Bank?</TE>
<TE>   "It's really difficult for someone who lives in heaven to come and
live in hell," Mahedawi said.</TE>
<TE>   The Cabinet decision affects people on both sides of the border.</TE>
<TE>   Gail, a 45-year-old New Yorker who holds both U.S. and Israeli
citizenship, said she was dumbstruck last month when immigration
officials told her that they wouldn't renew her Jordanian husband's
permit because he was an Arab.</TE>
<TE>   "It's hard to believe the government is telling me what
nationality of spouses [it] would approve," said Gail, who asked that
her last name not be used. "Every application should be dealt with on
its merit. You cannot exclude everyone of an ethnic group."</TE>
<TE>   The Interior Ministry said it decided to stop considering
residency requests for Arabs after a bomber blew himself up in Haifa
on March 31, killing 15 people. The bomber, according to authorities,
had been granted a permit to live inside Israel because his mother
was married to an Israeli.</TE>
<TE>   Yishai, the leader of the ultra-Orthodox Shas Party, aims to
reduce the number of Arabs and other non-Jews granted Israeli
citizenship. He said that during the last decade, the government
approved residency permits for 100,000 Arabs living in the West Bank
and Gaza.</TE>
<TE>   "Perhaps this is deliberate policy on the part of [Yasser
Arafat's] Palestinian Authority, to change in a sophisticated way the
demographic structure of Israel," Yishai said. It is "the realization
of 'the right of return' through the back door."</TE>
<TE>   Yishai was referring to the Palestinian demand that Arabs
displaced since the Jewish state's independence be allowed to return
to their homes inside Israel. Many Israelis say that allowing a
"right of return" for Arabs would amount to the suicidal destruction
of Israel.</TE>
<TE>   Weiss, the human rights lawyer, said Yishai's fears are unfounded.
She has asked Israel's Supreme Court to overturn the Cabinet
decision, saying it violated laws against discrimination.</TE>
<TE>   Times special correspondent Maher Abukhater contributed to this
report.</TE>

<DL>TEL AVIV</DL>
<LD>A bomb attached to a tanker truck exploded Thursday at a huge fuel
depot near densely populated Tel Aviv, and a security guard foiled an
attempt to blow up a packed nightclub with a car bomb early today.</LD>
<LD>   The tanker attack was part of what experts said is a campaign by
Palestinian militants to carry out a large-scale terror attack.
Disasters were narrowly averted in both incidents.</LD>
<LD>   On Thursday morning, the bomb went off under a tanker truck
entering Israel's main fuel depot. Israeli officials said the bomb,
apparently hidden on the truck, was detonated with a cell phone.</LD>
<TE>   Tel Aviv police commander Yossi Sedbon said it was "a miracle" the
blast did not ignite the huge fuel storage tanks.</TE>
<TE>   Then, early today, a guard killed an attacker who apparently
planned to blow up the Studio 49 club, where about 200 people were
partying, Sedbon said.</TE>
<TE>   The security guard, Eli Federman, 36, told reporters that he saw
the car turn sharply and race toward the club, and he opened fire,
hitting the driver.</TE>
<TE>   Federman said the man started falling out of the car, setting off
a blast. "Then I fired the rest of the bullets into his head,"
killing him, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "A big tragedy was averted here," Sedbon said.</TE>
<TE>   There was no claim of responsibility for either attempted attack.</TE>
<TE>   In Gaza City early today, witnesses said Israeli troops entered
the Zeitoun neighborhood and blew up three small factories. No one
was hurt, and one person was arrested, they said.</TE>
<TE>   The Israeli military had no immediate comment. The incursion
followed several incidents of mortar and rocket fire at Jewish
settlements in Gaza.</TE>
<TE>   The blaze at the fuel depot underlined Israel's vulnerability to a
large-scale attack on a strategic target. Despite decades of warnings
by security experts and environmentalists, the depot remains located
in the middle of Israel's most densely populated area, near Tel Aviv.</TE>
<TE>   The blast set fire to diesel fuel that leaked from the tanker and
burned the cab to a crisp, but firefighters were able to put out the
blaze before it spread to above-ground tanks that contain millions of
gallons of gas and other fuel.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli TV showed a map with concentric circles starting at the
depot, predicting widespread destruction throughout the Tel Aviv area
if the depot had exploded.</TE>

<HD>Pope Lauds Bulgaria for Keeping Its Faith</HD>
<DH>Europe: Pontiff, who arrives from Azerbaijan, praises
Orthodox Christians' perseverance during the Communist era.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID HOLLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SOFIA, Bulgaria</DL>
<LD>Speaking at a Mass in Azerbaijan and at a later welcoming ceremony in
Bulgaria, Pope John Paul II on Thursday pushed for better relations
between the Roman Catholic and Orthodox faiths by stressing the
shared fate of Christians who had faced Communist-era persecution.</LD>
<LD>   "Brothers and sisters, you saw your religion mocked as mere
superstition," he said in comments directed to all Christians present
at a multi-faith gathering in Baku, capital of the largely Muslim
former Soviet republic of Azerbaijan. "You were regarded as
second-class citizens and were humiliated and marginalized in many
ways."</LD>
<LD>   In Bulgaria, where he was welcomed by national leaders in a
ceremony in downtown Sofia, the capital, the 82-year-old and visibly
frail pontiff praised the country's deep Orthodox Christian roots and
recalled the nearly half-century of Communist domination after World
War II.</LD>
<TE>   "Even during the long cold winter of the totalitarian system,
which brought suffering to your country and to many other European
nations, fidelity to the Gospel did not disappear," he declared in a
Bulgarian-language address read partly by himself and partly by a
Bulgarian priest. Many here "remained heroically faithful to Christ,
in not a few cases to the point of sacrificing their lives."</TE>
<TE>   Several Roman Catholic priests were executed after Communist-era
show trials in 1952. Three of them are to be beatified--a step toward
sainthood--in a Mass to be conducted by the pontiff on Sunday in
Plovdiv, Bulgaria's second-largest city.</TE>
<TE>   John Paul traditionally kisses the ground in a blessing when he
visits a country for the first time. But now, suffering from
arthritis and symptoms of Parkinson's disease, he instead kissed a
basket of Bulgarian soil.</TE>
<TE>   At the welcoming ceremony, held in front of the St. Alexander
Nevsky cathedral, the pope stood through the Vatican and Bulgarian
anthems, clutching the arms of his chair, but sat for the delivery of
his speech.</TE>
<TE>   In an indication of some success for John Paul's diplomacy, the
head of the Bulgarian Orthodox Church, Patriarch Maxim, appeared at
the welcoming ceremony despite doubts that he would attend.</TE>
<TE>   "With respect I greet His Holiness Patriarch Maxim ... together
with all the faithful of the Orthodox Church of Bulgaria," John Paul
said. "I fervently hope that my visit will serve to increase our
knowledge of each other so that, with God's help and on the day and
in the way that pleases him, we shall finally live 'united in the
same mind and the same judgment.' "</TE>
<TE>   Orthodox faiths have been cool to the pontiff's overtures in many
countries; the Orthodox Church of Russia has blocked his efforts to
visit that nation.</TE>
<TE>   Bulgarian President Georgi Parvanov, in his welcoming speech,
declared that the pope's visit "is one of the most significant events
in the centuries-long history of the relationship" between the Roman
Catholic and Orthodox faiths.</TE>
<TE>   The Roman Catholic and Orthodox churches split in 1054, and over
the centuries they have been bitter rivals at times. Bulgaria is a
mainly Orthodox nation of 8 million, with just 80,000 Catholics.</TE>
<TE>   In Russia, the Orthodox Church fears that Roman Catholics are
trying to win over its traditional believers. Although there is less
tension in Bulgaria over that issue, some in the crowd of about 3,000
that gathered to welcome the pontiff showed signs of being torn
between the two branches of faith.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the holiest man on Earth," said Svetla Atanassova, 75, a
pensioner in the crowd who described herself as Orthodox but said she
has recently been attending Catholic Masses. "We have been very badly
affected by communism. That's why we're seeking some comfort.... I
was a student when the Communists took over, and they killed all my
professors and the priests."</TE>
<TE>   Atanassova voiced sharp criticism of Maxim, charging that he was
compromised by his role as head of the Bulgarian Orthodox Church
under communism. She predicted that without new leadership for the
Orthodox faith, many of its followers might become Roman Catholics.</TE>
<TE>   But a woman sitting nearby, Marielka Bekyarova, a 49-year-old
unemployed construction engineer, quickly countered those views,
stressing that under Maxim the church had managed to keep its doors
open.</TE>
<TE>   Bulgarian Foreign Minister Solomon Pasi said in an interview that
Maxim's decision to attend the ceremony reflects reduced Russian
influence in the country's life.</TE>
<TE>   It is "very remarkable that the patriarch of Bulgaria was here,"
Pasi said. "It means the Bulgarian Orthodox Church is absolutely
autonomous, makes her decisions by herself and is transforming in the
same way in which all institutions of [formerly Communist] Central
and Eastern Europe are changing in the last decade."</TE>
<TE>   In his arrival speech, John Paul said his visit fulfilled a
long-held desire.</TE>
<TE>   "I have never ceased to love the Bulgarian people," he declared.
"May my presence among you be a clear sign of my sentiments of esteem
and affection for this noble nation and its children."</TE>
<TE>   The unusual phrasing of having "never ceased to love" Bulgarians
was seen by some observers as a reference to allegations that the
nation's then-Communist government and the Soviet KGB were involved
in a 1981 assassination attempt on John Paul. The presumed motive
would have been Moscow's alarm at John Paul's support for the
anti-Communist Solidarity trade union in his native Poland.</TE>
<TE>   Three Bulgarians faced trial in Italy as alleged co-conspirators
in Turkish gunman Mehmet Ali Agca's attempt to kill the pope in St.
Peter's Square. The Bulgarians were acquitted for lack for evidence.</TE>
<TE>   "Twenty years ago there was a spot unjustly thrown on Bulgaria,
being accused, being linked with the assassination attempt on the
pope," Pasi said. "The visit of the pope clears this injustice" and
restores "the well-deserved prestige of the country."</TE>
<TE>   Near the end of the ceremony, despite his physical infirmities,
John Paul gave an indication of his mental sharpness and good humor
by quipping in Italian: "The president is young, so that's why he's
standing. But he let the pope sit down because he's old."</TE>

<HD>Fringe Candidates Steal Spotlight in Colombia</HD>
<DH>Election: Many voters see the 'invisibles' as a welcome
diversion amid a lackluster campaign and a growing civil war.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RUTH MORRIS</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>BOGOTA, Colombia</DL>
<LD>Not far from the fireworks and cheers that marked the last days of
campaigning in Colombia's presidential election, a ragtag crew of
minor candidates gathered for a political event of a different kind.</LD>
<LD>   One presidential contender, a bullfighter, said voters should
support him because, well, "not just anyone puts himself in front of
a bull." Another candidate, a former military officer, energetically
called for his supporters not to vote for him.</LD>
<LD>   Yet another hopeful, dressed in the heavy wool poncho of an Andean
potato farmer, promised to pay $425 to each person who votes in
Sunday's election. When reminded that paying for votes is
unconstitutional in Colombia, he smiled and patiently explained that
he plans to eliminate the constitution anyway because it is
"contradictory, ugly--and too long."</LD>
<TE>   It's Politics Gone Awry</TE>
<TE>   for Some People</TE>
<TE>   For some, the presidential debate, held at Bogota's Javeriana
University last week, represented politics gone awry. For others, it
was democracy in action--and a welcome diversion from a boring
campaign and an escalating civil war. Under Colombian law, any
citizen can run for president as long as he or she is at least 30
years old, was born in the country and has no criminal record.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, presidential elections here frequently attract
eccentric sideliners.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not running for president," said candidate Augusto Guillermo
Lora, the obstinate former officer who is among Colombia's so-called
invisible candidates. Instead of presenting a governing plan, Lora is
asking his followers to vote "in blank," an option that allows
citizens to show they're dissatisfied with all the candidates.</TE>
<TE>   Sitting alongside him at the debate in the capital was Alvaro
Cristancho, a gentle, gleeful man who writes poetry and was once a
Franciscan monk.</TE>
<TE>   Cristancho said he would prefer to pay each voter a million pesos
from government coffers than channel the money into mismanaged public
works.</TE>
<TE>   "It's possible I won't win. I always knew I wouldn't be a prophet
in my own land," he lamented. Besides wearing a poncho in solidarity
with Colombia's impoverished peasant farmers, Cristancho often
campaigned with a piece of tape across his mouth to protest what he
sees as an oppressive political regime aided by an exclusionary,
image-conscious media.</TE>
<TE>   "In this country, they sell a candidate like a product, like a
soap to cure dandruff," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Luckily for Cristancho, the government allots 120 minutes of free
air time on public television to each candidate, as well as a
10-minute segment on private stations. The broadcasts have brought
the underfinanced invisible candidates into millions of homes, and
some have garnered interest.</TE>
<TE>   While not one of them has registered in recent preelection polls,
many Colombians say they are at least lending an ear to these
colorful underdogs.</TE>
<TE>   Looking at the wider race, it isn't difficult to understand why.
According to a nationwide survey of 1,930 voters released last
weekend, hard-line candidate Alvaro Uribe Velez commands a
26-percentage-point lead over his closest rival, taking much of the
suspense away from the election outcome. Without a tight race, voters
appear bored.</TE>
<TE>   For his part, Uribe is no showstopper. Credited for his serious
and meticulous approach, his favorite refrain during the last several
months has been "We have to work, work and work."</TE>
<TE>   Analysts also attribute the interest in small-time candidates to
growing disenchantment with Colombia's traditional two-party system.</TE>
<TE>   The opposition Liberal Party has been split between support for
Uribe, a Liberal dissident, and second-place candidate Horacio Serpa,
who is running with the party's endorsement. The ruling Conservative
Party, meanwhile, has seen its support base decline to just 14%.</TE>
<TE>   The invisible candidates, on the other hand, defy ideological
definition. Asked to describe his political orientation, Cristancho
replied, "I'm human."</TE>
<TE>   Pablo Franky, a political scientist at Javeriana University, said
the country's traditional parties had opened the way for madcap
candidates by drifting away from their social base and throwing the
country's political scene into chaos.</TE>
<TE>   "It may seem like a circus, but in theory, any citizen can be
elected to the presidency," Franky said. "For me, that's sane."</TE>
<TE>   A Light Break From Kidnappings, Joblessness</TE>
<TE>   Regardless of their place in politics, the invisibles appear to
have lightened the mood in a country weighed down by a deepening
civil conflict, rampant kidnappings and depressingly high
unemployment.</TE>
<TE>   A crowd favorite, Rodolfo Rincon decided to run for Colombia's top
job after he dreamed that a throng of cheering bullfighting
aficionados had carried him right to the door of the presidential
palace.</TE>
<TE>   Months later, he traveled deep into the jungle to attend a meeting
between Marxist rebel commanders and presidential candidates, where
he apparently planned to present his peace plan.</TE>
<TE>   To the cameramen's delight, Rincon showed up in tights and an
emerald-studded bullfighting outfit. The rebels, dressed less
glamorously in fatigues, barred him from entering.</TE>
<TE>   Sadly, Rincon has had a lackluster bullfighting career, punctuated
by disappointing stints as a mechanic and a used-car salesman. But
winning the presidency would make up for it. And while it may seem
like a big jump from bullfighter and car salesman to president,
Rincon's political naivete endears him to many.</TE>
<TE>   During a recent televised speech, he became so animated he
couldn't stand still and shifted right out of the frame. On another
occasion, when asked how many children he has, Rincon hesitated and
then responded: "I don't deny that I have four children out of
wedlock. Sooner or later this would have been known. When I'm
president of the republic, they'll show up."</TE>
<TE>   Top Candidates Fail</TE>
<TE>   to Inspire Professor</TE>
<TE>   Juan Fernando Mejia, a philosophy professor, said he spent 20
hopeful minutes watching Rincon present his political program on
television before concluding that he was "a cliche of the voice of
the people."</TE>
<TE>   Mejia said he worries that Uribe's tough stance against the rebels
will bring more violence. But he was also uninspired by Serpa's
second-place bid because he considers the politician's fiscal policy
unsound.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't feel represented by any of the candidates," Mejia said.
"If our options are to stay in the same situation or for things to
get worse, it's best just to have a laugh."</TE>

<HD>Afghan Warlords Are Cited as Threat</HD>
<DH>Peacekeeping: U.N. official tells the Security Council that
rebellious local leaders could upset attempts to distribute aid and
select a government.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WILLIAM ORME</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>UNITED NATIONS</DL>
<LD>A senior U.N. official warned the Security Council on Thursday that
the "fragile" security situation in much of Afghanistan is
threatening efforts to rebuild the country and install a new
government.</LD>
<LD>   Though "more progress has occurred in Afghanistan in the past six
months than anyone would or could have predicted a year ago,"
powerful warlords continue to defy the country's U.N.-backed interim
regime, Undersecretary-General Kieran Prendergast told council
members.</LD>
<LD>   Many candidates for next month's loya jirga, or national assembly,
reportedly fear reprisal from entrenched local military and political
leaders, he said, leaving open the possibility that some of the
country's approximately 380 electoral districts may not be
represented at the gathering.</LD>
<TE>   The assembly is charged with selecting a new transitional
government, following a plan devised by U.N. officials and endorsed
by the council last fall.</TE>
<TE>   Ambitious foreign aid programs, considered essential to
solidifying the new government's hold on the country, cannot get
underway "without real improvement in security outside Kabul and its
environs," Prendergast said.</TE>
<TE>   Shortly after his address, the 15-member council voted unanimously
to extend the mandate of the International Security Assistance Force
for six months beginning June 21, with Turkey taking over command
from Britain.</TE>
<TE>   As expected, however, the council voted to still restrict the
force's operations to the area in and around Kabul, the capital,
despite requests from U.N. officials and Afghan leaders that troops
be deployed in outlying areas of the country.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. generals leading the coalition campaign against Taliban and
Al Qaeda holdouts have opposed expansion of the peacekeeping force,
fearing that international troops might hamper combat operations in
remote districts.</TE>
<TE>   U.N. officials, meanwhile, say their efforts to build a stable new
Afghan government are jeopardized by factional infighting, the
rearmament of militias and open opposition to the interim regime from
regional chieftains.</TE>
<TE>   "In view of the absence of an expansion of the International
Security Assistance Force beyond Kabul, the United Nations and the
interim administration continue to believe that the international
community should address these legitimate security issues as quickly
as possible," Prendergast said. "I am sure that the international
community is fully aware that all its political and financial efforts
in support of Afghanistan would be seriously compromised by a lack of
tangible progress in the security environment."</TE>
<TE>   Some Express Fear</TE>
<TE>   of a Return to Chaos</TE>
<TE>   Despite the unanimous vote, several council members--Ireland,
Syria and Mexico among them--echoed the security concerns voiced by
Prendergast, who U.N. officials stressed was speaking for
Secretary-General Kofi Annan.</TE>
<TE>   Some U.S. legislators were critical of the council move.</TE>
<TE>   "Unless we provide the necessary diplomatic, military and
political support to extend ISAF's mandate into other key cities and
transit routes, we may well see Afghanistan fall back into the very
sort of chaos and warlordism that spawned the Taliban in the first
place," said Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr. (D-Del.), chairman of the
Senate Foreign Relations Committee.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration says Afghans should be equipped to provide
for their own security needs.</TE>
<TE>   In a meeting with donor nations in Geneva last week, Afghan
authorities presented a plan for an 80,000-member national army that
would initially cost $300 million a year.</TE>

<HD>Venezuelan Coup Fallout Continues</HD>
<DH>South America: Official inquiry draws fire. Man who briefly
replaced Chavez seeks asylum.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Reports</BD>
<DL>CARACAS, Venezuela</DL>
<LD>Tens of thousands of President Hugo Chavez's opponents marched in
this capital Thursday, calling for the resignation of the left-wing
leader and his prosecutor general, whom the protesters accuse of bias
in the probe of killings around last month's brief coup.</LD>
<LD>   With chants of "Out, out!" and "Hugo, Hugo, time to go!"
demonstrators snaked through the city to the office of Prosecutor
Gen. Isaias Rodriguez, who is investigating the fatal shootings of at
least 15 people during an anti-government rally April 11 that
triggered the coup.</LD>
<LD>   "The criminals are still walking about free," said Mohamad Mechi,
whose 18-year-old son, Jesus Mohamad Capote, was killed when gunmen
opened fire on the anti-Chavez protest. "If we don't get justice,
those who killed my son will kill others."</LD>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the businessman who replaced Chavez during the brief
coup has asked Colombia for political asylum, Venezuela's foreign
minister said.</TE>
<TE>   "I have just been told by the Colombian foreign minister that
Pedro Carmona has asked for political asylum and he is in the
Colombian Embassy here in Caracas," said Luis Alfonso Davila, the
Venezuelan minister.</TE>
<TE>   In Bogota, the Colombian capital, Colombian Foreign Minister
Guillermo Fernandez de Soto said his nation would try to make a
decision on the request quickly.</TE>
<TE>   Carmona disappeared Thursday morning after going for a walk
outside his home in Caracas, his lawyer said. His escape came a day
after a court ordered him transferred from house arrest to jail. He
has been charged with rebellion.</TE>
<TE>   The demonstrations, riots and looting surrounding the coup left at
least 40 people dead.</TE>
<TE>   In the chaotic hours after the April 11 shootings, rebel civilian
and military leaders removed Chavez from power. Loyal troops
reinstated him two days later.</TE>
<TE>   Chavez opponents claim that pro-government gunmen opened fire on
their peaceful protest, while the president accuses rivals of
orchestrating the rally as part of a wider conspiracy to topple his
government.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, protesters handed in more than 3 million signatures
demanding the resignation of Rodriguez, the prosecutor general, who
has denied charges that he is too closely linked to Chavez to
investigate the deaths.</TE>
<TE>   So far, four people have been arrested in the investigation.</TE>

<HD>Mexico Releases 3 Zapatista Allies</HD>
<DH>Diplomacy: Fox commutes the men's sentences as he tries to
negotiate with rebels.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SAN CRISTOBAL DE LAS CASAS, Mexico</DL>
<LD>The government of Mexico released three Zapatista sympathizers
Thursday who were sentenced to eight years in prison in the southern
state of Chiapas.</LD>
<LD>   Rafael Lopez Satis, Gustavo Estrada and Alejandro Mendez had been
found guilty of drug trafficking, weapon violations and criminal
association.</LD>
<LD>   Their release was the latest attempt by President Vicente Fox to
bring the Zapatista rebels back to the negotiating table.</LD>
<TE>   Fox made bringing peace to troubled Chiapas a top priority after
taking office in December 2000. He has closed seven army bases built
to surround Zapatista strongholds, freed nearly 100 rebel prisoners
and sent a Zapatista-backed Indian rights bill to Congress. But the
rebels refused to resume formal peace talks with the government after
legislators watered down the bill.</TE>
<TE>   "I am happy to leave prison and be reunited again with my family,"
Mendez said. "I will join [rebel] ranks to continue the armed fight,
and if it is necessary give my blood and life for the improvement of
Mexico's Indian villages."</TE>
<TE>   Luis Alvarez, Fox's peace envoy, said he hoped the rebels saw the
release as a goodwill gesture by Fox's government, but Mendez said he
believed the only reason he was being freed was that he had served
more than half his sentence.</TE>
<TE>   Zapatista guerrillas staged a brief, bloody rebellion in 1994, but
since then their conflict with the government has been mostly a war
of words.</TE>

<HD>Stock Fraud Case Shines Light on Bad News Bearers</HD>
<DH>Securities: U.S. indictment charges Amr Elgindy with using
FBI data to launch attacks on stocks.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>THOMAS S. MULLIGAN, JAMES F. PELTZ and JOSH FRIEDMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>When federal agents Wednesday broke up an alleged securities scam
that included two FBI agents, they shined a light on a murky and
controversial corner of Wall Street that thrives on bad news.</LD>
<LD>   Authorities indicted Internet-based stock trader Amr I. "Anthony"
Elgindy and four others, charging them with a fraud that involved
driving share prices lower rather than higher.</LD>
<LD>   The 34-year-old Elgindy, who operates from Encinitas, has earned
the respect of many small investors as an outspoken "short
seller"--someone who seeks to expose companies that are more hype
than substance. Short sellers bet that a stock's price will fall, and
profit if it does.</LD>
<TE>   In the indictment unveiled Wednesday in Brooklyn, N.Y., the
government charged Elgindy, two associates, one current and one
former FBI agent with a fraud that involved using confidential
government information to target companies for short selling.</TE>
<TE>   The case opens a view to the ties many professional short sellers
have cultivated with securities regulators, law enforcement
officials, news reporters and others who have an interest in halting
and preventing frauds.</TE>
<TE>   Those relationships have long involved the sharing of information.
Though despised by many corporate managers, short sellers frequently
produce some of the hardest-hitting research on Wall Street to back
up their attacks on what they view as fraudulent businesses and
overpriced stocks.</TE>
<TE>   Elgindy, however, developed a bond with government agents that
turned criminal, authorities allege.</TE>
<TE>   According to the 33-page indictment brought by the U.S. attorney's
office in Brooklyn, Elgindy and associate Derrick W. Cleveland in
1999 began a relationship with Jeffrey A. Royer, then an FBI special
agent in Oklahoma City.</TE>
<TE>   As the Internet-stock frenzy was building to a climax, first
Cleveland and then Elgindy began giving Royer tips about companies
and individuals they suspected of perpetrating stock fraud, the
indictment states.</TE>
<TE>   Elgindy and Troy Peters, another associate, "sometimes reported
negative information about targeted companies to the U.S. Securities
and Exchange Commission and the Federal Bureau of Investigation in
order to initiate or hasten regulatory and law enforcement action,
which they knew would cause the stock prices to fall sharply once
such action became public," the indictment says.</TE>
<TE>   As a short seller, that served Elgindy's purposes: In a short
sale, a trader borrows stock (usually from a brokerage) and sells it,
betting that the market price will drop.</TE>
<TE>   If the bet is correct, the short seller can buy back the borrowed
shares at a lower price and pocket the difference between that price
and the sale price.</TE>
<TE>   Short sellers can provide the useful function of puncturing
over-hyped stocks and, sometimes, exposing criminal activity. In one
celebrated case, ZZZZ Best Co., a phony carpet-cleaning company
headed by Barry Minkow in Reseda, was exposed as a fraud by short
sellers in the 1980s.</TE>
<TE>   But short sellers have long been accused of being abusive,
sometimes planting false rumors about companies they have shorted to
drive the stocks lower.</TE>
<TE>   Beginning in 2000, the government said Wednesday, Elgindy induced
Royer to start a flow of information in the opposite direction:
According to the indictment, Royer began tapping the FBI's
confidential computer databases and supplying his informants with
dirt from ongoing federal criminal investigations of companies.</TE>
<TE>   Cleveland paid Royer for the data, wiring him a total of $30,425
in four payments between Nov. 28, 2000, and May 31, 2001, the
indictment says.</TE>
<TE>   Elgindy allegedly put the information out over the Internet via
his $600-a-month subscription service, AnthonyPacific.com, so that he
and his subscribers could launch coordinated short-selling attacks on
the target companies, the government alleges.</TE>
<TE>   After subscribers got first crack, much of the information was
later disseminated elsewhere, such as on the Silicon Investor Web
site, popular with small investors.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, in a classic shakedown, Elgindy, Cleveland and Peters
used the FBI information to extort payments from companies,
threatening to wreck the firms' reputations unless they agreed to pay
the traders with company stock, the indictment says.</TE>
<TE>   In December, Royer quit the FBI and joined Elgindy's investment
firm, Pacific Equity Investigations. Royer's role as a funnel of
confidential FBI material was soon taken over by Lynn Wingate, a
special agent based in Albuquerque, the indictment states.</TE>
<TE>   Former federal prosecutor Christopher J. Bebel of Houston's
Shepherd, Smith &amp; Bebel law firm, said that FBI agents sometimes
trade information with sources in order to gain their trust.</TE>
<TE>   "To the extent possible, the FBI generally prefers to make it a
one-way street. They know they're dealing with untrustworthy people,"
Bebel said Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   He speculated that Elgindy would make his role as an FBI informant
a major part of his defense. "Oftentimes, it is difficult to convict
an informant. They have a history of convincing juries that they
viewed their activities as being done on the government's behalf,"
Bebel said.</TE>
<TE>   Elgindy remained in federal custody in San Diego on Thursday,
awaiting a court hearing this morning, when a judge will weigh the
government's request that he be held without bail on grounds he's a
"flight risk," said Shane Harrigan, an assistant U.S. attorney.</TE>
<TE>   Jean Knight, a San Diego lawyer said to be representing Elgindy,
did not immediately return a call seeking comment Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Elgindy has long operated with a flamboyant style, prone to
blustering against his opponents on the Web and elsewhere. A former
employee of the National Assn. of Securities Dealers recalls Elgindy
walking into NASD's Dallas office a couple of years ago and purposely
letting his jacket flap open to reveal a holstered handgun.</TE>
<TE>   Two years ago, Elgindy served nearly four months in prison for
fraudulently collecting disability payments in the mid-1990s while he
continued to work as a stockbroker, according to a complaint brought
by the U.S. attorney's office in Fort Worth.</TE>
<TE>   On Elgindy's Web sites he held little back, chastising companies
he felt should be shorted, calling them "overvalued pigs." Yet at
times he admitted to reporters that he'd suffered from depression.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, he enjoyed the wealth that short selling and his
advice to other investors provided him. There's his 3.9-acre estate
in the seaside town of Encinitas, in north San Diego County, valued
at $2.2million, which the FBI raided Tuesday in search of evidence.</TE>
<TE>   And there's a fleet of vehicles that include a 2001 Bentley with
the license plate "ZEROBID," a nod to the short seller's dream of
watching a stock crash all the way to $0.</TE>
<TE>   Message boards on the Silicon Investor Web site and elsewhere
buzzed Thursday with reaction to Elgindy's arrest.</TE>
<TE>   Said one posting about Elgindy: "I guess all those threats to use
his FBI contacts [to thwart his detractors] finally came back to bite
him."</TE>
<TE>   But another investor said: "I read the indictment and it seems to
me that the FBI and [U.S.] attorney have it in for the agent, Tony
and shorters in general. Perhaps it's the natural jealousy that civil
servants have for successful people in the private sector. Perhaps
it's because Tony acted like he was a 'deputized' FBI agent in the
fight against stock fraud. Perhaps it was Tony's in-your-face
approach to stock fraud. He really made fun of con men and took jabs
at the FBI and SEC for not doing enough to prevent it."</TE>

<HD>Powerful Team Joins Hahn Bid to Stop Valley Secession</HD>
<DH>Politics: Former foes are among those backing effort to
keep city whole. Some urge an emphasis on L.A.'s strengths.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MATEA GOLD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Faced now with a five-month campaign over Los Angeles' future, Mayor
James K. Hahn and other civic leaders pledged unity Thursday, even as
some members of the effort to defeat San Fernando Valley secession
offered thinly veiled criticism of Hahn's approach so far.</LD>
<LD>   City leaders have fretted that Hahn has been both too passive and
too negative in his response to secession, in which he has combined
modest service improvements with dire predictions of what would
result if the Valley broke away.</LD>
<LD>   But with the matter now headed for the Nov. 5 city ballot, Hahn
has been joined by an expanded leadership team, some of whom are
urging that the campaign emphasize Los Angeles' virtues.</LD>
<TE>   In addition to Hahn, prominent secession opponents who say they
will campaign against the measure include former Mayor Richard
Riordan, former Assembly Speaker Antonio Villaraigosa and former
Secretary of State Warren Christopher. Villaraigosa lost to Hahn in
last year's mayoral campaign; two other candidates from that race,
Playa Vista President Steve Soboroff and U.S. Rep. Xavier Becerra,
said they too will participate in the effort to defeat secession.</TE>
<TE>   Riordan, who often disagreed with Hahn when he was mayor and Hahn
was city attorney, and who did not support Hahn's candidacy in last
year's mayoral campaign, joined with Hahn on Thursday to announce
their combined campaign to hold the city together.</TE>
<TE>   "We will work together in every community, in every neighborhood
to speak about this city, to speak about what's great in Los
Angeles," Hahn said at a morning news conference with Riordan outside
City Hall.</TE>
<TE>   "We're also going to talk about the harm secession will do to
every community in our city."</TE>
<TE>   Hahn said he will organize a broad coalition of citizens to
educate voters about the ramifications of breaking apart Los Angeles.
And for the first time, he ruled out the possibility of the city
suing to stop the measure from going to the ballot.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't intend to sue," Hahn said. "What we want is for people to
have an opportunity to vote on this. We think we can win this battle
at the polls."</TE>
<TE>   New Effort Cheers</TE>
<TE>   Some City Leaders</TE>
<TE>   The mobilization of Hahn's L.A. United campaign cheered some city
leaders who thought he has been too slow in addressing the secession
movements in the Valley, Hollywood and harbor area. "The campaign is
now getting underway," said City Councilman Jack Weiss. "I see it
turning an important corner."</TE>
<TE>   In addition to recruiting new faces and stepping up the pace of
the anti-secession effort, some leaders of that camp have urged that
the campaign take on a more positive cast, worried that denunciations
of secession advocates might provoke a backlash.</TE>
<TE>   The mayor has called breaking up Los Angeles "harebrained" and has
argued that creating a separate city in the San Fernando Valley would
be a "financial disaster." He also has warned that a new city would
face higher taxes, reduced services and be more vulnerable to crime
and terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   Secession advocates have jumped on Hahn's comments, calling them
"scare tactics." On Thursday, state Sen. Richard Alarcon (D-Sylmar)
said Hahn's statements have reinforced the determination of some
secessionists to go their own way.</TE>
<TE>   "Mr. Hahn has been the greatest deterrent to keeping the city
together, by the irresponsible comments he has made," said Alarcon,
who said he is undecided about secession but is considering a run for
mayor of the new Valley city.</TE>
<TE>   Though acknowledging the need to point out the downsides of
secession, some city leaders opposed to the breakup say the emphasis
of the L.A. United campaign should be on the attributes of the
nation's second-largest city.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel that saying the positive, that we are a great city and
let's keep it that way, is the best argument," said Riordan, who, as
mayor, argued that municipal breakup would be immoral because it
would harm the poor. On Thursday, Riordan declined to reiterate that
criticism.</TE>
<TE>   "Los Angeles is seen as one of the truly great, great cities in
the world," he added.</TE>
<TE>   "To tear it apart is to detract from its greatness."</TE>
<TE>   Villaraigosa, whose mayoral campaign was set back by negative
advertisements that Hahn's camp unleashed against him, echoed that
sentiment, and said he doesn't believe the tone Hahn has struck so
far will be effective.</TE>
<TE>   "We've got to get away from an adversarial debate and initiate a
conversation in neighborhoods all across the city," he said. "I don't
believe you scare people into wanting to stay together. I think you
inspire them."</TE>
<TE>   Bill Carrick, the campaign strategist running the L.A. United
effort, said Hahn will be focusing on both the positive aspects of
the current city and the risks of breaking apart.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think we have any strategic tension about what people
ought to be saying," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn agreed.</TE>
<TE>   "They are two sides to the same question," he said. "Because we
love Los Angeles and it is such a great city, it would be a terrible
thing to break this great city apart. If that's negative to say that,
then people can judge it that way."</TE>
<TE>   Part of the debate about how to address voters may be a question
of timing, some political observers said. In that view, the campaign
may start off positive and then turn more critical as the election
approaches.</TE>
<TE>   "It may be they need to talk about what one city is all about
before they talk about how ugly two cities can look," said Rich
Lichtenstein, a longtime City Hall lobbyist and consultant. "It may
make sense to start off rallying people about what a great city Los
Angeles is."</TE>
<TE>   However the campaign begins, some political experts said stressing
the uncertainties of secession ultimately may be the city
leadership's most effective tactic.</TE>
<TE>   "If you can confuse the voters, or at least raise questions about
the potential impact it could have on them, it can be effective,"
said Larry Berg, founding director of USC's Jesse Unruh Institute of
Politics.</TE>
<TE>   In the end, Hahn must craft a message that both soothes discontent
among Valley residents and boosts the enthusiasm among the rest of
the city for keeping Los Angeles whole, campaign experts said.</TE>
<TE>   "Part of this race comes down to the level of passion that Valley
residents have for breaking away and the level of indifference of the
rest of the city," said campaign consultant John Shallman. "One of
the most important things Mayor Hahn will have to do is outline the
impact on those who will be left behind."</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the political leaders rallying around the
anti-secession effort, leading business figures, including
philanthropist Eli Broad and developer Ed Roski, have signed on to
help as well.</TE>
<TE>   Broad said he hopes to form a committee of 100 civic leaders to
mobilize resistance to secession.</TE>
<TE>   "If the mayor wants, there are going to be a lot of prominent
people from all over the city who are going to be involved," Broad
said.</TE>
<TE>   The L.A. United campaign committee already has raised about $2.5
million in pledges and donations, half of its goal so far, according
to campaign consultant Kam Kuwata.</TE>
<TE>   Broad already has donated $100,000, with promises of more if
needed, and Riordan said Thursday he would write "a good-sized
check."</TE>
<TE>   The campaign will need a deep war chest to afford pricey
television advertising, especially at a time when an expensive
governor's race will be dominating the airwaves, Hahn said.</TE>
<TE>   "We need to win this thing this summer," he said. "We can't wait
until November."</TE>
<TE>   Times staff writers Tina Daunt and Patrick McGreevy contributed to
this report.</TE>

<LD>Sam Snead, whose picture-perfect golf swing carried him to a record
81 PGA Tour victories including three Masters--and earned him a
legendary reputation as one of the most gifted athletes to play the
game--died Thursday at his home in Hot Springs, Va. He was 89.</LD>
<LD>   Dressed in his trademark straw hat and always quick with a
one-liner, Snead was one of the first golfers to draw overflowing
galleries with unerringly precise drives that gained him the nickname
"Slammin' Sam."</LD>
<LD>   His love of competition fueled his longevity: He won his first
Professional Golf Assn. title in 1936, and held titles in six
decades, winning his last in 1982. Last month, despite his failing
health and the need for assistance teeing up the ball, he took part
in the Masters' ceremonial first drives--a tradition he once quipped
he'd never give up as long as azaleas grew at Augusta National.</LD>
<TE>   Snead, who would have celebrated his 90th birthday Monday,
suffered a series of strokes over the last several weeks and died
peacefully at his home with his son and daughter-in-law at his side.</TE>
<TE>   "Sam Snead was probably the greatest athlete that golf has ever
had. Very seldom does an all-around athletic man like Sam Snead come
along," said Gary Player, nine-time major champion. "Maybe in time,
Tiger [Woods] will prove to be the athlete of this century in golf,
but in the last, Sam Snead was the best athlete."</TE>
<TE>   Many on Thursday mourned Snead's passing by paying homage to that
swing.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think there's ever been a golf swing as aesthetically
pleasing as Sam Snead's," Phil Mickelson said from the Memorial
Tournament.</TE>
<TE>   Added two-time U.S. Open champion Curtis Strange: "It was a gift,
something you can't teach."</TE>
<TE>   Snead's natural swing was said to have been developed in his
boyhood in the backwoods of western Virginia by practice with a
crooked stick and a stone, his accurate eye the product of squirrel
hunting.</TE>
<TE>   An all-around athlete, Snead made the football, baseball,
basketball and track teams in high school, but he left his mark on
golf, starting as a barefoot caddie on a course at Hot Springs when
he was 15.</TE>
<TE>   He became a professional golfer in 1935, leaving a job at a
restaurant, and would go on to win 135 tournaments worldwide, among
them three Masters titles and four other major championships. His 81
PGA tour victories are a feat that some believe may never be broken.</TE>
<TE>   Hootie Johnson, chairman of Georgia's renowned Augusta National
Golf Club, said Snead participated in the Masters, either as a player
or as a ceremonial starter, for 63 consecutive years.</TE>
<TE>   "He was one of the greatest golfers ever and he will be deeply
missed," Johnson said.</TE>
<TE>   Snead was a player on seven Ryder Cup teams and the captain of
three more.</TE>
<TE>   "The impact on golf is immeasurable," said Jack Connelly,
president of the PGA of America. "A giant of the game has gone, but
we will never forget his true love of golf and his fellow man."</TE>
<TE>   Snead wasn't a flashy player. His drives, for example, weren't
especially long. Accuracy proved to be the hallmark of Snead's game.
And few players won with such style and grace.</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody had his joyous, rhythmic sweep at the ball," the late
Times columnist Jim Murray wrote in 1995. "He was as loose-jointed as
an ocelot, as uninhibited as a cub bear. The golf club was a wand.
Watching Snead play golf was like watching Kelly dance, Ruth bat,
Tracy act, Koufax pitch or Dempsey punch. A work of art."</TE>
<TE>   If Snead's swing was a picture of perfection, his longevity was
also a model. The 26-year period between Snead's victories at
Greensboro is one of golf's more remarkable achievements.</TE>
<TE>   He lived past nearly every contemporary from the field of
competition, including Ben Hogan, Lloyd Mangrum and Jimmy Demaret.
Only Byron Nelson, 90, remains from that Golden Age of golf. And the
two-time Masters champion, who counts five majors to his credit,
fondly remembered Snead.</TE>
<TE>   "He was one of a kind," Nelson said. "He had a swing so sweet, you
could pour it out of a syrup bottle."</TE>
<TE>   But last month at the Masters, where Snead had been an honorary
starter since 1983, something was amiss. His sweet swing, no longer
flawless, had deserted him.</TE>
<TE>   He was recovering from stroke-like symptoms, his son said, and for
the first time he needed someone else to tee up the ball. His
ceremonial shot flew wildly into the gallery and struck a fan in the
face, breaking the man's glasses.</TE>
<TE>   Snead will be long remembered, however, for all the shots that
flew straight and true.</TE>
<TE>   Though he never won the U.S. Open--the only one of the major
championships that eluded him--Snead was a three-time winner of the
PGA Championship and bagged his only British Open title at St.
Andrews in 1946.</TE>
<TE>   He won the Masters for the first time in 1949, the year club
members first awarded a green jacket. He won again at Augusta three
years later and in 1954 defeated Hogan by one stroke in an 18-hole
playoff.</TE>
<TE>   He finished among the top five nine times at the Masters, among
the top 10 15 times.</TE>
<TE>   Although he never had a golf lesson, he had a reputation for being
a shrewd competitor who would take on all comers. Once, when he
played in a Brazil Open, the sponsor negated prize money. Snead shot
a 71. The sponsor thought he was malingering, and reinstated the
prize money. Snead shot 63-63-69, much to the sponsor's fury.</TE>
<TE>   "The money was there for the asking, why not get it," Snead
explained at the time, with a shrug, and the meaning was clear: You
want 63s, you pay for 63s.</TE>
<TE>   But he was almost as famous for his near-misses at the U.S. Open,
finishing as runner-up four times.</TE>
<TE>   He missed a 30-foot putt on the final hole of a playoff in 1947
against Lew Worsham and two years later a three-foot putt from the
edge of the 17th green at Medinah to lose to Cary Middlecoff.</TE>
<TE>   In 1953, a 76 in the final round at Oakmont left him six strokes
behind Hogan.</TE>
<TE>   "One has to be very good," a New York Herald Tribune reporter once
noted, "to toss away as many open titles as Snead has done through
the years."</TE>
<TE>   He suffered his most heartbreaking U.S. Open loss in 1939 at
Philadelphia Country Club, where the lack of scoreboards on the
course played a part. Believing he needed a birdie on the final hole
to win, when all he needed was a par, Snead aggressively hit his
drive into the rough and never recovered, finishing with a triple
bogey.</TE>
<TE>   "That night," he said later, "I was ready to go out with a gun and
pay somebody to shoot me. It weighed on my mind so much that I
dropped 10 pounds, lost more hair and began to choke even in practice
rounds."</TE>
<TE>   Of course he was exaggerating.</TE>
<TE>   After joining the PGA Tour in 1937, Snead won at least one
tournament in all but one of the next 23 years.</TE>
<TE>   In 1950, he won 11, two more than Tiger Woods would win 50 years
later in what has been his greatest season.</TE>
<TE>   And his fellow pros could never get enough of that swing.</TE>
<TE>   "Watching Sam Snead practice hitting golf balls is like watching a
fish practice swimming," John Schlee, a U.S. Open runner-up in 1973,
once said.</TE>
<TE>   In his 1946 book, "How to Play Golf," one of two he wrote on the
subject, Snead made it sound so easy. One of his swing tips was to
"take it easily and lazily, because the golf ball isn't going to run
away from you while you're swinging."</TE>
<TE>   Born in Hot Springs on May 27, 1912, Snead grew up on a farm.</TE>
<TE>   "When I was down on my folks' farm," he once said, "we raised
almost everything we ate. I did about everything on the farm. Haying
was the worst."</TE>
<TE>   In golf, "He was a genius from the start," the famed sportswriter
Grantland Rice once said.</TE>
<TE>   After Snead won a tournament at Oakland in 1937, only a few weeks
after joining the PGA Tour, fellow pro Leo Diegel predicted a bright
future for the 24-year-old.</TE>
<TE>   "He's what I call real," Diegel told reporters. "Has every shot in
the bag. He's as cool as a cake of ice and compares with the longest
hitters I've seen. All he lacks at this time is experience. After he
gains that he's going to make it mighty tough for the rest of us.
He's not a flash in the pan."</TE>
<TE>   Nobody, however, could have predicted Snead's longevity.</TE>
<TE>   Twenty-seven years after he won the Greater Greensboro Open for
the first time in 1938, he won it for the record eighth time in 1965.
He was 52, the oldest man to win on the PGA Tour.</TE>
<TE>   It was the last of his 81 victories, 17 after his 40th birthday,
but Snead was far from finished.</TE>
<TE>   He helped launch the Senior PGA Tour by winning the inaugural
Legends of Golf in 1978 with Gardner Dickinson.</TE>
<TE>   The next year, in the second round of the Quad Cities Open, he
became the first player on the PGA Tour to shoot his age, a 67. Two
days later, he shot a 66.</TE>
<TE>   Snead is survived by two sons, Samuel J. Jr. and Terry; and two
grandchildren. A memorial service is planned in Hot Springs on
Sunday.</TE>

<CX>   Snead obituary--Golfer Sam Snead missed a three-foot putt on the
final hole of a playoff in the 1947 U.S. Open against Lew Worsham.
The distance was incorrect in Snead's obituary May 24. Also, Snead
three-putted from the edge of the 17th green in the 1949 U.S. Open to
lose to Cary Middlecoff. He did not miss a three-foot putt on the
hole, as reported incorrectly in Snead's obituary.</CX>

<HD>Secessionists Plan to Stake Victory in Own Backyard</HD>
<DH>Government: They say that if two-thirds of the Valley votes
for the split, the effort will win.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUE FOX and PATRICK McGREEVY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Leaders of the San Fernando Valley secession drive are devising a
strategy to win the Nov. 5 election with a grass-roots effort that
would mine enough votes in their own backyard to carry the entire
city.</LD>
<LD>   If they can persuade two-thirds of Valley voters to support a
breakaway, the theory goes, they will tip the scales so far that
secession will claim victory without majority support in the rest of
Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   "All we need is 35% outside the Valley," said Richard Close,
chairman of the secession group Valley VOTE and a longtime leader of
Sherman Oaks homeowners. "We're figuring we'll get about 65% of the
Valley."</LD>
<TE>   The strategy outlined Thursday comes as Valley VOTE, a volunteer
band of secessionists with just one paid staff member, gears up for
what is expected to be a ferocious campaign against a well-funded
cadre of prominent opponents. The Local Agency Formation Commission
voted Wednesday to put Valley secession before voters citywide.</TE>
<TE>   Lining up to block secession is a team of political, business and
labor heavyweights, including Mayor James K. Hahn; his predecessor,
Richard Riordan; former Secretary of State Warren Christopher; and
billionaire real estate developer Eli Broad.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn has pledged to raise $5 million for the effort, while the
secessionists hope to collect $2 million to $4 million.</TE>
<TE>   Close said secessionists will mount a populist effort, modeled
after the landmark Proposition 13 tax reform campaign in 1978,
relying on perhaps 25,000 volunteers chasing down the vote in
precincts across the Valley.</TE>
<TE>   Their message will tout the benefits of a smaller, more responsive
government.</TE>
<TE>   Proponents are also counting on a huge number of candidates--a
Valley mayor's office and 14 council seats will be up for grabs--to
generate support and money. County Registrar-Recorder Conny B.
McCormack estimated this week that there could be as many as 200
candidates for council offices in the Valley, Hollywood and harbor
area cities if all three make the ballot.</TE>
<TE>   Secession leaders plan to kick off their campaign today with a
news conference in front of the Van Nuys city building. They will
announce the formation of the San Fernando Valley Independence
Committee, headed by former Assemblyman Richard Katz.</TE>
<TE>   They said they do not plan to organize extensively in other parts
of the city. But they are visiting communities irked by City Hall,
such as South Los Angeles, to suggest ways they also would gain from
a smaller Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Secessionists have hired the political consulting firm of Goddard
Claussen Porter and Novelli, which has run dozens of successful
ballot measure campaigns in California.</TE>
<TE>   Ben Goddard, the campaign manager, said the group plans to take
its message to television, radio and debates. The campaign will seek
to substitute the more positive term "independence," for the more
confusing "secession," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Under California law, a municipal breakup must be approved by
majorities of two groups of voters: those living in the breakaway
region, and those citywide (including the area that would secede). A
very strong showing in the Valley, which traditionally boasts high
voter turnout, could sway the race citywide. Valley voters accounted
for 42% of ballots cast in last year's mayoral election.</TE>
<TE>   "I think support in the Valley runs real deep," said Valley VOTE
President Jeff Brain. "People are going to come out of the woodwork
to vote on this, people who haven't voted in years. We don't need to
win totally across the city."</TE>
<TE>   City Council President Alex Padilla, a strong opponent of
secession, agrees that the Valley will be the main battlefield.</TE>
<TE>   "Previous elections have shown the significance of the Valley
vote," he said. The anti-secession group One Los Angeles has also
decided to concentrate its efforts in the Valley.</TE>
<TE>   If secession bids in Hollywood and the harbor area also make the
November ballot, Valley cityhood backers say they can count on an
extra boost for their cause. LAFCO is slated to decide the fate of
those proposals in the next two weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Valley secessionists plan to meet with leaders in South Los
Angeles, where many African American residents were angered by the
mayor's decision to oppose a second term for Police Chief Bernard C.
Parks; Westchester, where some residents are chafing at development
at Los Angeles International Airport; and other areas.</TE>
<TE>   In South Los Angeles, the Rev. Frederick O. Murph of Brookins AME
Church said he will host a May 29 town hall meeting, featuring Close
and Parks, to talk about secession.</TE>
<TE>   "We are exploring this issue so we can make a decision," Murph
said.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday morning, Valley VOTE's headquarters on Ventura
Boulevard in Sherman Oaks was deserted except for a volunteer
answering the phones, which were ringing off the hook.</TE>
<TE>   "I just walked in the door one day and said, 'Nobody answers your
phone, you guys. Want me to?'" said Barbara Graham, 69, a retired
accountant from Van Nuys. She's been with Valley VOTE for about a
year.</TE>
<TE>   "We're getting all kinds of calls," Graham said. "People who want
to run for office, people who want bumper stickers, people who want
to help with the Web site." Such enthusiasm aside, it remains unclear
whether secessionists can raise the cash that will probably be
required to compete at the mayor's fund-raising level.</TE>
<TE>   Secessionists have "bodies, but I don't know that there are people
who are writing huge checks," said Harvey Englander, a Democratic
political consultant unaffiliated with either side in the secession
debate. "The difficulty is: Do they have the money to run a citywide
campaign?" Valley VOTE has said it spent $500,000 to collect the
voter signatures that launched the breakup process, but it has
repeatedly refused to release a complete list of donors.</TE>
<TE>   The group has said only that in 1998, the year of the petition
drive, the top donors were the Los Angeles Daily News, Los Angeles
Police Commissioner Bert Boeckmann, and David Fleming, a Studio City
attorney who serves on the city Ethics Commission.</TE>
<TE>   But Fleming said Thursday that he might not contribute to the
ballot campaign. If he does so, he would have to resign from the
Ethics Commission, according to an opinion he obtained from the city
attorney's office.</TE>
<TE>   "I have not made that decision," he said. "I am still thinking
about it."</TE>
<TE>   He added that Valley VOTE's fund-raising has been hampered by the
lack of wealthy backers. "There are no billionaires in the Valley,"
Fleming said.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>LARAMIE, Wyo.</DL>
<LD>Declaring "this was no accident," a judge sentenced Clinton Haskins
on Thursday to 14 to 20 years in prison for killing eight college
students in a drunken-driving collision.</LD>
<LD>   Haskins, 22, was also ordered to pay $81,042 in restitution to the
families of the victims and was fined $8,008 by District Judge
Jeffrey A. Donnell.</LD>
<LD>   "You chose to get behind the wheel of a 10,000-pound truck and
drive drunk," Donnell told Haskins in an 18-minute address after
hearing nearly five hours of testimony from friends and relatives of
the victims and Haskins in the packed courtroom.</LD>
<TE>   "This was no accident, and no mistake. It was inevitable. The only
question was who was going to die and how long it was going to take,"
the judge said.</TE>
<TE>   Haskins, of Maybell, Colo., pleaded guilty Feb. 7 to eight counts
of aggravated vehicular homicide that stemmed from the Sept. 16,
2001, crash.</TE>
<TE>   Under the plea, prosecutors recommended 14 to 20 years in prison
for each count, to be served concurrently. He could have received up
to 160 years in prison.</TE>
<TE>   The head-on collision wiped out two-thirds of the University of
Wyoming's cross-country team.</TE>
<TE>   Haskins, a member of the university's rodeo team, was hospitalized
five days. He graduated this spring while free on $100,000 bond.</TE>

<HD>Milwaukee Archbishop Denies Abuse Charges</HD>
<DH>Church: Accuser was paid over alleged '79 incident, but
says he'd been part of a 'cover-up.'</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Archbishop Rembert G. Weakland of Milwaukee on Thursday denied that
he was stepping down in response to allegations of sexual misconduct.</LD>
<LD>   "I have never abused anyone," the Roman Catholic prelate said in a
statement.</LD>
<LD>   Charges against Weakland surfaced Thursday morning, when ABC News
reported a claim by a former Milwaukee resident that Weakland
sexually assaulted him more than 20 years ago.</LD>
<TE>   Likening the experience to "date rape," Paul Marcoux said the
incident happened in 1979 when he was a 30-year-old theology graduate
student at Marquette University.</TE>
<TE>   Marcoux, 54, said Weakland tried to kiss and fondle him. Marcoux
could not be reached for comment at his home in San Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   His charges are documented in a settlement agreement obtained by a
Milwaukee television station in which the archdiocese and the
archbishop jointly agreed to pay Marcoux $450,000. The agreement
contained a confidentiality clause.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been involved in the cover-up," Marcoux told ABC. "I
accepted money to stay silent, not to speak out about what was going
on."</TE>
<TE>   Marcoux also cited a 1980 letter Weakland wrote to him as proof of
the psychological damage he suffered. The letter suggests that
Marcoux and Weakland had an intense, emotional relationship.</TE>
<TE>   Weakland turned in his resignation on his birthday, April 2, when
he reached the church's mandatory retirement age of 75.</TE>
<TE>   In a statement read Thursday by an archdiocese spokesman, Weakland
said: "Paul Marcoux has made reference to a settlement agreement
between us. Because I accept the agreement's confidentiality
provision, I will make no comment about its contents."</TE>
<TE>   Weakland also sought to reassure parishioners that their donations
did not help pay for the settlement with Marcoux.</TE>
<TE>   Saying that the archbishop used his authority as a church leader
to take advantage of him, Marcoux cited the 1980 letter, in which
Weakland expresses his love for Marcoux and describes his anguish
over not being able to maintain a relationship with him.</TE>
<TE>   "During the last months I have come to know how strained I was,
tense, pensive, without much joy. I couldn't pray at all. I just did
not seem to be honest with God. I felt I was fleeing from Him, from
facing Him," Weakland wrote.</TE>
<TE>   "I felt like the world's worst hypocrite. So gradually I came back
to the importance of celibacy in my life--not just a physical
celibacy but the freedom the celibate community gives."</TE>
<TE>   Weakland said he is awaiting the Vatican's formal approval of his
resignation.</TE>
<TE>   "I have now today asked the Vatican to accelerate its acceptance,"
he said in his statement. "I ask for your prayers and healing."</TE>
<TE>   In related developments Thursday in the growing scandal of sexual
abuse by priests:</TE>
<TE>   *A suspended Maryland priest was arrested Wednesday night on
charges of felony child abuse and sex offenses for allegedly
molesting an 11-year-old boy in 1980. Father Brian M. Cox, 63, who
runs a ministry for the homeless, was removed from St. John Catholic
Church in Westminster in 1995, when similar allegations arose
involving another youth.</TE>
<TE>   *A priest in New York surrendered to investigators Thursday on
charges of sexually abusing a 12-year-old girl. Father Francis X.
Nelson, 38, a priest at St. Charles Borromeo Church in Manhattan, was
indicted on two counts of second-degree sexual abuse and one count of
endangering the welfare of a child.</TE>

<LD>   A bacteria testing system meant to ensure that ground beef is safe
instead is allowing potentially tainted meat to be put on the market,
consumer advocacy groups said.</LD>
<TE>   A study of Agriculture Department records found the meat safety
system plagued by delays after it was started in early 1998.</TE>
<TE>   At some plants, testing stopped for months at a time before being
completed. In other cases, the department waited weeks to take
corrective action at plants that had clearly flunked, said the report
by Public Citizen and the Government Accountability Project.</TE>
<TE>   The report accused USDA of operating under a "don't look, don't
find policy" that is "fundamentally deceiving the public with false
reassurances" about meat safety.</TE>

"is continuously being reviewed, evaluated and improved."</TE>

<HD>Partisan Wrangling Stalls House Anti-Terrorism Bill</HD>
<DH>Spending: Fall election maneuvering is blamed as Democrats
delay a routine measure to take issue with Republican tax and fiscal
policies.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JANET HOOK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The House ground to a halt Thursday in a partisan standoff that
underscored how thoroughly Congress has been pulled into the
political riptide of the fall elections.</LD>
<LD>   The crosscurrents have made it increasingly difficult for
lawmakers to deal with legislation--even the routine, popular bill
the House has been discussing this week that would finance
anti-terrorism efforts and the military operation in Afghanistan.</LD>
<LD>   House approval of the bill was delayed, probably until early
today, because of political maneuvering by both sides on matters that
have little to do with fighting terrorism.</LD>
<TE>   Democrats forced a raucous debate on an issue they want to put
squarely before the voters this November: GOP tax and fiscal
policies.</TE>
<TE>   Deriding those policies as irresponsible and reckless, the
Democrats spent hours criticizing a GOP-backed provision slipped into
the spending bill that would clear the way for increasing the legal
limit on federal borrowing--without Congress taking a direct vote.</TE>
<TE>   Democrats attacked that as a GOP evasion of the consequences of
last year's big tax cut.</TE>
<TE>   "When it comes time to pay the bills for that tax cut, you don't
want to be seen, you don't want to have a vote," said House Minority
Leader Richard A. Gephardt (D-Mo.).</TE>
<TE>   GOP leaders brought a political agenda of their own to the debate:
They laced the spending bill with provisions targeted to help
vulnerable Republicans facing reelection. This included the
debt-limit maneuver that would shield lawmakers from casting a
politically risky vote to increase government borrowing.</TE>
<TE>   The two sides battled throughout Thursday as Democrats
sought--ultimately without success--to force a vote on the debt-limit
increase.</TE>
<TE>   The emergency spending bill, expected to clear Congress eventually
with broad bipartisan support, is one of many issues that have been
stalled or slowed in the increasingly polarized Congress.</TE>
<TE>   A full year since President Bush asked Congress to pass an energy
bill, differences on the legislation are far from being resolved.
Efforts to craft a compromise bill to impose new regulations on
health maintenance organizations have languished. And Congress is so
polarized over fiscal issues that it is unlikely to adopt a budget
resolution that sets the parameters for spending.</TE>
<TE>   Each side blames the other for self-serving intransigence.</TE>
<TE>   "The Republican majority [in the House] views everything as, 'My
way or the highway,'" Gephardt said. "They are unwilling to really
have an honest compromise on major issues."</TE>
<TE>   Republicans return the complaint. "The Democrats feel no
obligation to govern, just gripe," said House Majority Whip Tom DeLay
(R-Texas). "We must not let our work be undermined by those intent on
putting politics before people."</TE>
<TE>   The bill before the House on Thursday would provide $29 billion
for defense and homeland security initiatives, mostly in response to
the attacks of Sept. 11. There was little dispute about these core
provisions.</TE>
<TE>   But slowing the measure's progress was the wrangling over the
national debt.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration months ago asked Congress to approve
legislation raising the $5.95-trillion statutory limit on government
borrowing. That is necessary because, as a result of last year's tax
cut, the recession and spending increases spurred by the Sept. 11
attacks, the federal budget is running a deficit and the government
must borrow more than was expected when the current debt ceiling was
set.</TE>
<TE>   The Treasury Department has told Congress the debt-limit increase
must pass by June 28, or else there would be an unprecedented default
on payments to holders of government bonds.</TE>
<TE>   But House Republican leaders say they don't have the votes to pass
an increase.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the party's fiscally conservative members are loath to
vote for more government debts.</TE>
<TE>   The provision slipped into the emergency spending bill is designed
to sidestep the need for a separate roll call on the debt limit. It
clears the way procedurally for a debt-limit increase to be added to
the bill when House and Senate negotiators write the final version of
the bill.</TE>
<TE>   Democrats tried to block that maneuver but were defeated on a
largely party-line vote, 213 to 203. Still, they continued to delay a
final vote on the bill by offering a barrage of amendments and
speeches.</TE>
<TE>   Late Thursday, Republicans laid plans for using parliamentary
procedures to force an end to debate and set the stage for final
passage early today.</TE>
<TE>   That would clear the way for the House to begin a weeklong
Memorial Day recess.</TE>
<TE>   House Rules Committee Chairman David Dreier (R-San Dimas) said the
labored progress of the emergency spending bill does not bode well
for the rest of this session of Congress, during which lawmakers must
pass 13 appropriation bills to fund the government for the fiscal
year starting Oct. 1.</TE>
<TE>   "This is just the beginning," Dreier said. "We have 13 bills to
go."</TE>

<HD>Cause of Death Becomes Focus in Levy Case</HD>
<DH>Inquiry: Investigators are moving in direction of homicide
probe, sources say. Police chief says Rep. Condit, other witnesses
may be re-interviewed.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEPHEN BRAUN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The search for the cause of death of former intern Chandra Levy
proceeded Thursday in forensic laboratories and along the dense
forest floor where her body was found, as teams of police
investigators and medical examiners sifted for evidence of a violent
end.</LD>
<LD>   District of Columbia Metropolitan Police Chief Charles H. Ramsey
said that a decision on whether to pursue the case as a homicide
awaited a coroner's analysis of Levy's cracked skull, which was
recovered from under a foot-deep pile of leaves and debris on the
western edge of Washington's 1,754-acre Rock Creek Park.</LD>
<LD>   But sources familiar with the workings of the Levy probe said that
the investigation is moving "in that mode already."</LD>
<TE>   Ramsey said that senior police officials, detectives, and federal
agents and prosecutors involved in the case would be drawing up a
list of material witnesses. One possible name, the chief said, is
Rep. Gary A. Condit (D-Ceres).</TE>
<TE>   "He's one of the many people we interviewed before," Ramsey said.
"Perhaps there's a need to talk to him again."</TE>
<TE>   Condit lost a primary election in March after a year of
revelations about his relationship with Levy and continuing questions
about his strained dealings with police. Questioned four times by
detectives, Condit privately acknowledged that he had had an affair
with Levy but refused to submit to an FBI polygraph test. He was
summoned in April by a federal grand jury in Washington that is
investigating the Levy case and looking into allegations of
obstruction of justice during the probe.</TE>
<TE>   Ramsey also said Thursday that police likely would question a
Washington man who was sentenced to 10 years in federal prison in
February for assaulting two female joggers in Rock Creek Park last
May and July.</TE>
<TE>   The man, 20-year-old Ingmar Guandeque, threatened both women with
a black-handled knife and attempted to steal the portable stereos
they carried as they ran.</TE>
<TE>   "We spoke to him some time ago, and we planned to talk to him
again," Ramsey said. But, he said, "we can't make the leap from that
to anything tied to" Levy.</TE>
<TE>   On May 14, 2001, two weeks after Levy vanished, Guandeque bit one
victim and tried "grabbing and restraining" her as she resisted,
according to a federal prosecutor's account. He then fled.</TE>
<TE>   On July 1, Guandeque pulled a second jogger off a trail, "held a
knife to her chin, covered her mouth" and ordered her to be quiet.
The woman also struggled, forcing both of them down into a ravine.
The woman escaped and reported her assault to U.S. Park Police, who
arrested Guandeque 45 minutes later, U.S. Park Police Sgt. Scott Fear
said.</TE>
<TE>   In both cases, Guandeque attacked the women near dusk. At
sentencing on Feb. 7, District of Columbia Superior Court Judge Noel
A. Kramer noted Guandeque's "predatory" behavior as he issued two
concurrent 10-year prison terms.</TE>
<TE>   Deputy D.C. Police Chief Terrance W. Gainer said Thursday night
that Guandeque had not been given a polygraph test. "We will go back
and examine what that man has done," Gainer said.</TE>
<TE>   An Internet map search entry found on a laptop computer in Levy's
apartment indicated she might have gone to a stone mansion in Rock
Creek Park, a fact Ramsey and other police officials cited in saying
that she was known to jog there. But family intimates and friends
seemed less certain Thursday in describing her exercise routine.
While one source close to the Levy family said their daughter jogged
in the park and worked out at a health club near her Dupont Circle
apartment, others said her trips to the park may have been only
occasional.</TE>
<TE>   Gainer said that "our information was she did not often jog
outdoors. She usually used a treadmill" at a health club.</TE>
<TE>   It is four miles from Levy's apartment to the site where her
remains were found Wednesday. "She told me several times that jogging
was not her favorite activity," said Sven Jones, one of her
Washington friends.</TE>
<TE>   Gainer acknowledged that despite a monthlong effort by police
trainees to comb the park, police never went to the remote hill where
Levy's body was found. Condit attorney Mark Geragos said police had
"some explaining to do" for failing to find her body earlier.</TE>
<TE>   "We may have been 125 feet east of her at one point and 125 feet
west of her at another point," Gainer said, adding: "We gave it our
best shot."</TE>
<TE>   Among the articles detectives found Wednesday near Levy's remains
was a plastic headset for a Walkman-type radio. Police also
reportedly found a running shoe, a sports bra and a tattered blue USC
sweatshirt believed to be a gift given to Levy for her graduation
last spring.</TE>
<TE>   At the District of Columbia medical examiner's office Thursday,
the effort to learn the cause and timing of Levy's death was well
underway. Pathologists peered through dissecting microscopes,
analyzing the recovered skull to try to determine whether a crack in
the upper portion of the cranium was caused by a wild animal, a
fallen tree branch or blunt force trauma from a weapon.</TE>
<TE>   At the site where her skeleton was recovered, other scientists and
evidence technicians plotted their findings; yellow-vested police
recruits poked sticks into a rock-strewn creek and through deep
underbrush, probing for more remains scattered in a location about
100 yards from the nearest road.</TE>
<TE>   "My guess is in the next day or two they're going to call this a
homicide," said Ted Williams, a lawyer and former D.C. police
homicide investigator.</TE>
<TE>   George Washington University Law School forensic scientist James
Starrs said specialists would hunt for "trace evidence"--the telltale
deposits left when humans interact. DNA traces, such as semen, blood
or hair fibers that might be present and could provide clues, he
said. So might something like old insect husks, which could be dated
in an effort to "learn how long she was there."</TE>

<HD>Chimps Use Tools, Pass Along Skill</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>A band of chimpanzees in West Africa routinely swing crude stone
hammers to crack open nuts, a sophisticated use of tools the apes
have been teaching to each new generation for more than a century.</LD>
<LD>   Using carefully selected stones weighing up to 33 pounds, the
chimps pound the tough shell of the panda nut to extract a
high-energy kernel, an important part of the animal's diet,
researchers report today in the journal Science.</LD>
<LD>   "It is a very skillful behavior that takes up to seven years for
them to learn," said Melissa Panger, a George Washington University
researcher and co-author of the study. The panda nuts fall to the
ground inside an outer husk. Inside the husk is a golf ball-size nut
covered by a shell that can require up to a ton of pressure to break
open. Yet, if the animals pound too hard, the nut shatters and is
inedible, Panger said.</LD>
<TE>   "What is remarkable is that they are controlling the force
precisely," she added.</TE>
<TE>   Inside the shell are three nutritious kernels. During nut-smashing
season, some chimps spend two or three hours a day opening as many as
100 panda nuts. The nuts can provide up to 3,000 calories a day,
researchers said.</TE>
<TE>   The chimps establish nut-cracking stations, usually centered on a
battered root of a hardwood tree they use as an anvil.</TE>
<TE>   Panger said the chimps leave the hammer stones beside the anvils
and some of the tools have apparently been used for generations.</TE>
<TE>   Nut cracking demonstrates a degree of sophisticated learning
because it required the animals to select hammer stones at a distant
rock outcropping and then carry them to the anvil. Selection of the
stones requires some thought by the chimps: The crude hammers have to
be flat on one side, heavy enough to smash the nuts and have a place
to grasp, Panger said.</TE>
<TE>   "Some of these hammers have been used so many times that they have
deep pits, suggesting that they have been used for many generations,
over and over again."</TE>
<TE>   "There has to be knowledge of the size and hardness of the rock,"
said Julio Mercader, another researcher of the study.</TE>
<TE>   Mothers teach their children to bang on nuts, and some young
chimps have been seen hitting nuts with smaller stones. The
researchers said the nut-smashing technique is known to only some
bands of West African chimpanzees. It has not been seen among chimps
in central Africa, although there are nuts and stones available to
them.</TE>
<TE>   According to researchers, this suggests that nut smashing is a
cultural, learned behavior, not spread widely among the apes.</TE>

<HD>Ex-Officer Gets 15 Years for Killing 4 in Drunken Crash</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>A former police officer was sentenced Thursday to the maximum term of
15 years in prison for killing four family members in a drunk-driving
crash after a 12-hour drinking binge.</LD>
<LD>   Joseph Gray, who quit the force three weeks after last year's
accident, has been jailed since his manslaughter conviction May 3.</LD>
<LD>   "I think he's sorry," said Victor Herrera, whose pregnant wife was
killed in the crash. "But I also believe that's too late for us."</LD>
<TE>   According to prosecutors, Gray was on a drinking binge that began
in the parking lot of the 72nd Precinct and led to the Wild Wild West
topless bar before driving his minivan into the family as they
crossed a Brooklyn street.</TE>
<TE>   Maria Herrera was killed along with her 4-year-old-son, Andy, and
her 16-year-old sister, Dilcia Pena, when Gray sped through a red
light. Herrera delivered a son, Ricardo, after the accident, but he
died within hours of birth.</TE>
<TE>   Gray, 41, offered an unusual defense at trial, conceding that he
was driving while intoxicated but insisting his high alcohol
tolerance gave him the ability to operate a vehicle. His blood
alcohol content was measured at 0.16%; the legal limit is 0.10%.</TE>
<TE>   Gray's boozing with fellow officers in the parking lot--and later
at the off-limits strip club--resulted in the suspension or
reassignment of 17 officers.</TE>
<TE>   It also raised questions about alcohol abuse in the New York
Police Department, prompting officials to crack down on other
officers who had been accused of drunk driving.</TE>
<TE>   Herrera had mounted a petition drive urging the maximum sentence
for Gray. After the sentencing hearing, he became incensed by the
suggestion that Gray might appeal his sentence.</TE>
<TE>   "He should accept the 15 years, shut his mouth and think about
what he did," Herrera said.</TE>

<HD>Political Odd Couple Team on Gun Bill</HD>
<DH>Legislation: A longtime NRA supporter and one of the
group's biggest foes have joined to help states better enforce
purchasing laws.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC LICHTBLAU and NICK ANDERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>In a surprising alignment of onetime rivals, one of the National
Rifle Assn.'s most stalwart backers in Congress has teamed up with
one of its biggest opponents to try to make it tougher for felons and
other banned gun owners to purchase firearms.</LD>
<LD>   The measure would provide states with more than $1.1 billion over
the next three years to upgrade records that help ensure compliance
with gun purchasing laws. It would penalize those states that do not
get up to speed, and it could expand the data that states have to
give the federal government about banned gun owners, such as the
mentally ill.</LD>
<LD>   The proposal caught the attention of gun control advocates and
foes alike because of the backing of Rep. John D. Dingell (D-Mich.).
His unlikely co-sponsor is Rep. Carolyn McCarthy (D-N.Y.), who was
elected after her husband was gunned down on a Long Island train in
1993.</LD>
<TE>   A former NRA board member, Dingell has helped stall major gun
control legislation in the past, but he said Thursday that the
federal system is failing to keep guns out of the hands of people
banned from owning them.</TE>
<TE>   "Because states aren't automating their records or sending them to
the FBI [to do instant checks], convicted felons, spousal abusers and
the mentally ill are getting guns illegally," Dingell said.</TE>
<TE>   Is Dingell undergoing a change of heart, or is his newfound stance
motivated by his tight reelection race in a reconfigured Michigan
district against an incumbent who supports gun control?</TE>
<TE>   Political observers were split Thursday, but regardless, Dingell's
very public push for tightened gun purchase standards signaled the
measure's likely passage.</TE>
<TE>   The NRA signaled Thursday that it would not oppose the measure.
And while gun control legislation has been bottled up in Congress in
recent years with the help of Dingell, his stance on the background
check reforms portends the potential passage of the first significant
gun control measure since 1994's ban on assault rifles.</TE>
<TE>   McCarthy and Dingell are old rivals.</TE>
<TE>   In 1999, after the Columbine High School massacre, McCarthy
sponsored a proposal in the House to tighten background checks at gun
shows. But Dingell teamed with House Republican leaders to pass an
NRA-backed alternative that effectively killed the measure.</TE>
<TE>   "When you have John Dingell and Carolyn McCarthy together on a gun
bill, it's hard to see how it could be stopped," said Matt Bennett, a
spokesman for Americans for Gun Safety, a moderate gun control group
in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   "Dingell has been the voice of the NRA in the House, and Carolyn
McCarthy was elected almost entirely on gun control. You've got polar
opposites coming together."</TE>
<TE>   With the strong pairing, the bill is expected to have nearly
universal Democratic support and draw significant Republican support.
A companion bill is pending in the Senate, which generally has been a
friendlier forum for gun control measures in recent years.</TE>
<TE>   The NRA has voiced concerns about provisions in the bill regarding
the federal government's expanded access to state medical records on
those deemed mentally incompetent to own a gun. But on Thursday, an
NRA spokesman voiced support for the Dingell-McCarthy measure.</TE>
<TE>   "In its current form, the bill is a step in the right direction,"
NRA spokesman Kelly Whitley said. "It benefits law-abiding citizens
while taking the criminal element off the street."</TE>
<TE>   A recent study by Americans for Gun Safety found that the average
state has automated only 58% of its criminal convictions, and that
10,000 prohibited buyers were able to obtain a gun because the
background check could not be completed within the three business
days allowed by law. It also found that 33 states cannot stop anyone
with a mental health disqualification from purchasing a gun because
they keep no mental health records.</TE>
<TE>   McCarthy, in an interview, said: "I don't want it to be a 2nd
Amendment issue....Basically, we're just going to enforce the current
gun laws."</TE>
<TE>   But some provisions of the bill could prove controversial.</TE>
<TE>   The measure would provide much more concrete standards for the
type of material states must supply to the federal government about
people who may be banned from buying guns because of mental problems.
It would, for instance, require states to give the FBI the names and
relevant medical information on anyone who has been committed to a
mental institution in the last five years for treatment of alcoholism
or drug abuse.</TE>
<TE>   "That definitely marks something of an expansion," said Kristen
Rand, legislative director at the Violence Policy Center, a
Washington gun control group.</TE>
<TE>   But she noted that the measure also gives the attorney general
significant discretion to determine whether states are in compliance
in providing records and whether they should lose 10% of their
federal crime grant money for failing to comply.</TE>
<TE>   Rand said that if the measure goes into effect under Atty. Gen.
John Ashcroft, a staunch defender of 2nd Amendment rights, "the
effect might become illusory....His record doesn't bode well for
making something like this a priority."</TE>
<TE>   At the Justice Department, however, a senior official who had not
yet seen the bill said Ashcroft recently has put in place
administrative measures aimed at speeding up the gun background check
system and plugging holes.</TE>
<TE>   "This is something we're already doing internally and
administratively in the absence of legislation," the official said.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't look at background checks as a gun control issue. Having
accurate records of people who are prohibited from owning firearms is
just sound policy."</TE>

<HD>Panel Backs Bush's Judicial Nominee</HD>
<DH>Senate: As 3 Democrats break ranks, committee approves
Pennsylvanian for appeals court, despite criticism from women's
groups.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID G. SAVAGE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON -- A divided Senate Judiciary Committee approved President
Bush's choice of a Pennsylvania judge for a U.S. Court of Appeals
seat Thursday, as three Democrats broke ranks to vote in favor of the
nomination.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. District Judge D. Brooks Smith, 50, was appointed to the
federal bench by President Reagan. He later made speeches to
conservative groups disputing Congress' power to pass laws such as
the Violence Against Women Act, which allowed victims of sexual
assaults to sue their attackers.</LD>
<LD>   He also drew the ire of women's rights groups and several senators
because he maintained his membership in an upscale, all-male fishing
and hunting club.</LD>
<TE>   In 1988, when he was seeking confirmation for a lifetime seat as a
federal judge, Smith told the Judiciary Committee he would quit the
Spruce Creek Rod and Gun Club if it refused to open its doors to
women. He did not do so until 1999, when a vacant seat came open on
the U.S. 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals.</TE>
<TE>   "Despite his sworn statement to this committee, he did not resign
for 11 years," said Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick J. Leahy
(D-Vt.), who opposed the nomination. "It would be a bad precedent if
we ignored this."</TE>
<TE>   But Sen. Arlen Specter (R-Pa.) said the attacks on Smith were
unfair and based on exaggerated claims. "He has a reputation of the
highest caliber. And he was rated well-qualified" by the American Bar
Assn., said Specter, who pointed out that he had often voted for
nominees of President Clinton who were opposed by other Republicans.</TE>
<TE>   The Pennsylvania senator also questioned why the judge should have
been pressed to drop out of the Spruce Creek club. "This is a
sporting club. There was no business aspect to it," Specter said.</TE>
<TE>   In the end, the key vote was cast by Sen. Joseph R. Biden Jr., a
Democrat from Delaware.</TE>
<TE>   "This nomination is a close call for me. I would like to vote
against this guy because I don't agree with his philosophy," Biden
said. However, after consulting lawyers and judges in Pennsylvania,
Biden said he was persuaded to vote in favor of the nominee.</TE>
<TE>   "I was told this guy is honest, and he's not an ideologue," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   When the votes were counted, Sens. Herbert Kohl (D-Wis.) and John
Edwards (D-N.C.), who was on the Senate floor during the committee
debate, also voted to confirm Smith.</TE>
<TE>   Edwards, who is considering a run for the presidency in 2004,
played a key role in the defeat in March of Judge Charles W.
Pickering, Bush's nominee to the U.S. appeals court in New Orleans.
In sharp questioning, Edwards showed the judge had violated code of
conduct to arrange a more lenient sentence for a convicted cross
burner.</TE>
<TE>   Edwards said he voted for Smith because he was convinced the judge
was "willing to put personal views aside and apply the law." His
membership in the all-male club was a "serious error," he added, but
not reason enough to block the nomination.</TE>
<TE>   All nine Republicans voted for Smith, making the final tally 12-7
in favor of confirmation. If he wins approval from the full Senate,
which is likely, Smith will join the 3rd Circuit court, which sits in
Philadelphia and hears appeals in federal cases from Pennsylvania,
New Jersey and Delaware. Currently, the circuit court's 11 judges
include six Democratic appointees and five Republicans.</TE>
<TE>   Ralph Neas, president of People for the American Way, a liberal
advocacy group, called the vote "extremely disappointing."</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously, 12 members of the committee were not offended by the
fact that Judge Smith violated the code of conduct by continuing to
belong to a club that discriminates against women, or by the fact
that he broke a promise he made to the committee," Neas said.</TE>

<HD>FBI Lawyer Tells of Terror 'Roadblock'</HD>
<DH>Inquiry: In a bitter and detailed letter, the Minneapolis
official says the bureau failed to act on its agents' suspicions in
Moussaoui case.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC LICHTBLAU and JOSH MEYER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>An FBI official in Minneapolis has lashed out at bureau headquarters
for putting up a "roadblock" and failing to act aggressively enough
in pursuing suspicions in August surrounding flight school student
Zacarias Moussaoui, sources said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   The detailed, sometimes bitter letter from Coleen Rowley, an FBI
lawyer, revealed that agents in her office were reprimanded for
seeking assistance from the CIA in the case after they were
dissatisfied with the response from the FBI in Washington, according
to a government official familiar with the classified letter.</LD>
<LD>   Rowley's letter, sent Tuesday to FBI Director Robert S. Mueller
III and congressional intelligence committee members, contained
bureaucratic language laced with outrage: "When, in a desperate
eleventh-hour measure to bypass the FBI HQ roadblock, the Minneapolis
division undertook to directly notify the CIA's counterterrorist
center, FBI HQ personnel chastised the Minneapolis agents for making
the direct notification without their approval."</LD>
<TE>   Rowley also criticized officials at FBI headquarters in Washington
for rejecting Minnesota agents' request for a secret search and
surveillance of Moussaoui last summer, weeks before the Sept. 11
hijackings. And she accused Mueller and other senior officials of
trying to "circle the wagons" in their recent defense of the bureau's
performance.</TE>
<TE>   Mueller, who sources said faced heated questioning about the
letter in a closed-door meeting with lawmakers earlier this week,
said Thursday he has referred the matter to the Justice Department's
inspector general's office for investigation.</TE>
<TE>   "While I cannot comment on the specifics of the letter, I am
convinced that a different approach is required" toward
counterintelligence operations, Mueller said in a statement.</TE>
<TE>   "New strategies, new technologies, new analytical capacities and a
different culture make us an agency that is changing post-9/11," he
said. "There is no room after the attacks for the types of problems
and attitudes that could inhibit our efforts."</TE>
<TE>   The FBI has come under swelling criticism in recent weeks over its
alleged failure to pick up on warning signs before Sept. 11,
including the suspicions of a Phoenix FBI agent who warned in July
that Middle Eastern flight school students in Arizona might be
planning an attack. The Minneapolis letter is sure to ratchet up that
criticism even further.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Richard C. Shelby (R-Ala.), ranking Republican on the Senate
Intelligence Committee, questioned Mueller intensely about Rowley's
letter in a closed briefing Wednesday, and the senator was said to be
very angry about the FBI's "failure to act," according to a
congressional source.</TE>
<TE>   Moussaoui, a French citizen of Moroccan descent, was taken into
custody in Minneapolis in August on an immigration violation after
his instructors at a flight training school thought he was acting
suspiciously. He wanted to learn how to fly 747s, a jetliner far
above his experience level, and he paid the $8,000 fee in cash.</TE>
<TE>   Agents with the FBI's Minneapolis field office wanted approval to
execute a search warrant and conduct secret wiretaps under the
Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, or FISA, which allows the
government to monitor suspected foreign agents or terrorists with the
approval of a secret court in Washington. But officials at FBI
headquarters turned down the request, saying they did not have enough
evidence to act. They refused to pass the request along to the
Justice Department and the FISA court, and Moussaoui was not
conclusively linked to any terrorist plot before Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   But subsequent investigation after the attacks on the World Trade
Center and the Pentagon revealed evidence that Moussaoui may have
planned to be "the 20th hijacker" had he not been taken into custody.
A search of his computer and his belongings turned up a flight
simulation program, along with information about crop-dusters and
other suspicious material, officials said. That material led the
Justice Department to warn about possible attacks using crop-dusters
to spread biological agents.</TE>
<TE>   Moussaoui was charged with conspiracy to commit murder in the
hijackings, and he is facing the death penalty if convicted. After a
defiant courtroom tirade several weeks ago calling for the
destruction of America, he is now seeking to represent himself in
court. His trial is scheduled to begin in Alexandria, Va., this fall.</TE>
<TE>   The handling of the Moussaoui case before Sept. 11 has stirred
questions for months, but Rowley's letter represents the first
in-house attack and adds significant new details to the public
record.</TE>
<TE>   In her detailed 13-page letter, Rowley said Minneapolis agents
realized the serious risk that Moussaoui posed even before Sept. 11,
according to the government official familiar with her letter.</TE>
<TE>   She complained that FBI officials in Washington had changed the
warrant request so that it would be more easily rejected by the FBI
office that handles such requests. And she criticized the FBI for not
disseminating information about Moussaoui to other law enforcement
and intelligence officials before Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   Her revelation that the agency sought CIA assistance could prove
particularly damaging to the FBI, because the bureau's failure to
share information with the CIA about terrorist threats before the
attacks has been a central focus of the recent debate.</TE>
<TE>   On a separate front, Rowley also contended that Mueller and other
FBI officials made misleading statements in recent weeks by claiming
repeatedly that the FBI had no clear warning before Sept. 11 about
the looming threat.</TE>
<TE>   Rowley was particularly upset by Mueller's insistence in recent
weeks that the bureau might have been able to take some action to
prevent the tragedy if it had gotten more information. She and others
in the Minneapolis office tried to reach Mueller to tell him that
they thought he was skewing the facts, but the calls were either
rejected or fell on deaf ears, she wrote.</TE>
<TE>   "We faced the sad realization that [Mueller's] remarks indicated
someone, possibly with your approval, had decided to circle the
wagons at FBI headquarters in an apparent attempt to protect the FBI
from embarrassment and the relevant FBI officials from scrutiny,"
Rowley wrote.</TE>
<TE>   The Justice Department's inspector general's office will be
reviewing her allegations to determine whether department policies or
procedures were violated, but Justice Department officials say they
have already confirmed portions of her narrative.</TE>
<TE>   "The tone of her letter is a little over the top," according to an
official who asked not to be identified, "but her facts are right."</TE>
<TE>   Times staff writer Janet Hook contributed to this report.</TE>

<HD>Reid's Link May Not Be to Al Qaeda</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSH MEYER and ERIC LICHTBLAU</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>U.S. officials disclosed Thursday that they are investigating whether
Richard Reid's attempt to blow up a transatlantic airliner last year
was part of an effort by an Islamic militant group other than Osama
bin Laden's Al Qaeda network to wage war against America.</LD>
<LD>   Separately, authorities said in a court filing that Reid, a
British vagabond, all but confessed to the terrorist act two days
before boarding a Miami-bound American Airlines flight Dec. 22. He
was arrested after allegedly trying to ignite explosives hidden in
his sneakers.</LD>
<LD>   "What I am doing is part of the ongoing war between Islaam [sic]
and disbelief," Reid wrote in a Dec. 20 e-mail "will" to his mother.
"I didn't do this act out of ignorance nor did I do [it] just because
I want to die, but rather because I see it as a duty upon me to help
remove the oppressive American forces from the Muslim land and that
this is the only way for us to do so as we do not have other means to
fight them."</LD>
<TE>   The court documents also charge that Reid had at least one
accomplice in his alleged attempt to blow up the crowded American
Airlines jetliner--someone who helped construct the professional and
extremely powerful plastic explosive devices.</TE>
<TE>   But it is Reid's potential involvement with a terrorist group
other than Al Qaeda--or in conjunction with it--that has authorities
scrambling.</TE>
<TE>   They said in interviews that Reid's visits to the Gaza Strip and
other locations during his extensive travels, the particular type of
explosives he possessed when arrested, his own comments and other
information gained in their investigation have all raised significant
questions about whether Al Qaeda or another group was the primary
force behind Reid's planned attack.</TE>
<TE>   "They are damn sure he was part of a terrorist organization," one
federal law enforcement official said of Reid, citing the
professional explosives and Reid's global travels without any visible
income. "One could reasonably assume that Al Qaeda is not the only
group that is being looked at."</TE>
<TE>   Reid's lawyers did not return calls seeking comment Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Reid faces nine counts, including a charge of attempting to murder
the 197 passengers and crew members on the flight.</TE>
<TE>   Justice Department officials have accused Reid of being a soldier
in Bin Laden's network, saying in his indictment that he trained in
Al Qaeda camps in Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   He also appears to be the Al Qaeda operative whose name is
contained in a computer left behind at an Al Qaeda safe house that
was later sold to the Wall Street Journal and turned over to the FBI.</TE>
<TE>   FBI Director Robert S. Mueller III also said recently that the FBI
believes ''an Al Qaeda bomb maker'' constructed the shoe bombs, and
the court documents released Thursday say Reid, 28, has been ruled
out as the source of a human hair and palm print found in the bombs.</TE>
<TE>   Reid's British passport also reveals two trips to Pakistan in
2001, possibly so he could attend Al Qaeda training camps in
neighboring Afghanistan, the new documents show.</TE>
<TE>   But in an interview, the federal law enforcement official
confirmed that authorities are now looking particularly hard at
whether two Palestinian terrorist organizations--Hamas and
Hezbollah--were also somehow involved, which would mark a dramatic
shift in the agendas of both groups.</TE>
<TE>   At a minimum, authorities believe, Reid may represent a new kind
of hybrid terrorist, with links to Al Qaeda as well as Hamas,
Hezbollah or other major terrorist organizations. Either way, they
said, such links would dramatically expand the threat against
Americans because of the global reach and sophisticated tactics of
both groups.</TE>
<TE>   Traditionally, Hamas and Hezbollah have not sought to attack
Americans on U.S. soil or even on U.S. airplanes, limiting their
activities mostly to attacks on Israeli targets in the Middle East.
Hezbollah has attacked and kidnapped Americans, but never on U.S.
soil, and not for many years, authorities and terrorism experts said.</TE>
<TE>   A Bush administration official said the FBI and CIA have found no
formal organizational links between Al Qaeda and either Hamas or
Hezbollah, but that the groups have informally "bled" into each other
in recent years.</TE>
<TE>   Hamas and Hezbollah have sent soldiers to Al Qaeda camps in
Afghanistan, he said, and Hamas has provided training, particularly
expertise in explosives, to Al Qaeda.</TE>
<TE>   "There is certainly evidence to indicate that there are links and
contacts between them; they are like-minded organizations that hate
the U.S. and are tapping into a broader pool of resources and
people," said the official.</TE>
<TE>   "But I wouldn't say the Palestinian rejectionist organizations
[like Hamas and Hezbollah] are linking up with Al Qaeda and going to
war against us. We're not there yet."</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, that official--like other authorities--said Reid
represents "a wild card" because of his travels and affiliations.</TE>
<TE>   One recently retired Justice Department counter-terrorism
specialist confirmed that the Reid investigation has broadened to
include other terrorist organizations, particularly Hamas and
Hezbollah.</TE>
<TE>   Of particular note, he said, were Reid's trips to Gaza, a Hamas
headquarters, and his possession of an extremely powerful and
unstable explosive known as TATP, or triacetone triperoxide, which
has been used almost exclusively by Hamas suicide bombers.</TE>
<TE>   "The fact that he'd made several trips to Israel and other areas
in the Middle East is one reason why they're looking at a Hamas
connection," said the former official. "But Al Qaeda could very well
be working in some capacity with Hamas."</TE>
<TE>   Still other authorities believe Reid may have been working in
connection with Hezbollah, which has a history of recruiting in
Europe, and of sending non-Arab militants in reconnaissance missions
to Israel, according to Magnus Ranstorp, a terrorism consultant to
European governments and assistant director of the Center for the
Study of Terrorism and Political Violence at Scotland's St. Andrews
University.</TE>
<TE>   In particular, authorities are trying to nail down whether Reid
contacted Hamas, or Hezbollah's military wing, known as Islamic
Resistance, during the five days he spent in Israel in July.</TE>
<TE>   Neil Herman, a former FBI counter-terrorism supervisor, said any
connection between Reid and groups beyond Al Qaeda would be
significant and troubling.</TE>
<TE>   ''If he had any connection with either Hamas or Hezbollah, it
would certainly be a unique twist in a pattern of terrorism that we
had not seen from these groups,'' Herman said. ''Those groups have
historically never demonstrated the need to conduct such operations
in this country; that's been their track record for over 20 years.''</TE>
<TE>   Reid told authorities after his arrest that he acted because of
the U.S. military campaign in Afghanistan, and that he hoped his
planned attack would cause Americans to stop traveling, leading to a
downturn in the economy, prosecutors said in their memo.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities said they were actively searching for accomplices in
the attempted bombing. The legal brief was filed in opposition to
Reid's motion to lift restrictions on his communications with his
lawyers. The next hearing in the case is set for June 3.</TE>

<HD>Witness Doesn't Recall Skakel Joke on Killing</HD>
<DH>Court: Ex-baby-sitter says she can't remember a party where
defendant referred to '75 slaying.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NORWALK, Conn.</DL>
<LD>A former Kennedy family baby-sitter testified Thursday that she had
no recollection of a party at which Michael Skakel allegedly made a
joking reference to killing 15-year-old Martha Moxley.</LD>
<LD>   A prosecution witness testified earlier that Marissa Verrochi was
among the friends at his home in 1997 when Skakel referred humorously
to the 1975 beating death.</LD>
<LD>   But Verrochi, 24, said she did not recall the party. Defense
attorney Michael Sherman repeatedly asked whether Skakel had ever
confessed to her, but prosecutors objected and she did not answer.</LD>
<TE>   Verrochi, under questioning from prosecutors, said that Skakel had
befriended her and taken her under his wing during another Kennedy
family scandal when she was 15--her alleged underage affair with
Skakel's cousin Michael Kennedy.</TE>
<TE>   Skakel, 41, was the main contact for prosecutors investigating
Kennedy, who died in a Colorado skiing accident. Kennedy was never
charged.</TE>
<TE>   Skakel, a nephew of Robert F. Kennedy's widow, Ethel, is charged
with beating Moxley to death with a golf club in 1975. The families
were neighbors in wealthy Greenwich.</TE>
<TE>   The defense also called three witnesses who attended a substance
abuse treatment facility in Maine with Skakel in the late 1970s.
Prosecutors had presented two Elan School students who alleged Skakel
confessed, and others who said he told them he didn't know if he had
killed Moxley because he was so drunk.</TE>
<TE>   The former students testified Thursday that Skakel never confessed
despite being repeatedly beaten and spanked with a board when
confronted about Moxley's murder as part of school discipline.</TE>
<TE>   Skakel would deny the killing until he was put in a makeshift
boxing ring with other students, Sarah Petersen said.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier Thursday, the trial was delayed so the judge could ask
jurors whether they had discussed a remark about the defendant made
by a panel member.</TE>
<TE>   A juror said he saw Skakel mouth the words "good job" to his
cousin James Dowdle during a break in Dowdle's testimony on
Wednesday. The juror mentioned what he had seen as the panel was
headed to the break room and his comments were reported to a
courtroom marshal by an alternate juror.</TE>
<TE>   The judge has repeatedly directed the jurors not to discuss the
case with anyone.</TE>
<TE>   The juror told the judge Thursday he placed no significance on
Skakel's remark. Other panel members said they did not hear the
remark and the judge allowed the juror to remain.</TE>

<HD>South's Upheavals Not Over With Bomb Verdict</HD>
<DH>Race: Conviction marks gains made in the region, but some
find the changes threatening.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID LAMB and STEPHANIE SIMON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>BIRMINGHAM, Ala.</DL>
<LD>The bailiff snapped a pair of handcuffs tight around Bobby Frank
Cherry's wrists. And folks in this city of hills and honeysuckle
unfurled the worn-out words of cliche: A chapter closed. The Old
South put to rest. A chance for the New South to rise above an ugly,
hateful past.</LD>
<LD>   It was all true, as far as it went. But things are not that
simple.</LD>
<LD>   Cherry's conviction this week in the 1963 bombing of a black
Baptist church here that killed four young girls was hailed as a
symbol of the South transformed. But the trial of the former Ku Klux
Klansman did not speak to new tensions raking this proud, wary
region.</LD>
<TE>   The face of the population is changing in ways that some
Southerners find threatening. The manufacturing and textile
industries that have propped up the economy for decades are
collapsing. A defiant Southern pride is surging. And new hatreds are
welling.</TE>
<TE>   The temptation is to see Cherry's conviction "as some kind of
proof that the past is over and done with," civil rights activist
Mark Potok said. But that neat symbolism ignores the fact that the
South continues to change--in ways he sometimes finds scary. "There
is a real resurgence of Southern white nationalism," said Potok, who
tracks hate groups for the Southern Poverty Law Center. "In a word:
racism."</TE>
<TE>   This is not the racism that burst open into the raw brutality of
Birmingham, circa 1960. Not the racism evoked by the Cherry trial,
with its casual talk of white hoods and brass knuckles, of
supremacists who gleefully bashed black marchers as police stood by.</TE>
<TE>   That Birmingham, that South, is long gone. So long gone, in fact,
that to many here the Cherry trial seemed less a symbol than a
chore--a bit of historical housekeeping.</TE>
<TE>   "A murderer got convicted of murder. That's how the system is
meant to work. Let's not make too much of it," said Bill Littlefield,
40, a Birmingham carpenter.</TE>
<TE>   "For the younger generation of white Southerners, the wounds [that
the Cherry trial laid bare] are not theirs," said Joshua Rothman, an
assistant professor of history at the University of Alabama. "It
doesn't feel part of their lives, and they don't understand why they
should have to deal with it."</TE>
<TE>   If his students expressed any passion about the trial, Rothman
said, it was usually shame. "There's the feeling that it reinforces
the stereotypes of the redneck Southerner. [They ask], 'Do we need
more of that?' And for them, the obvious answer is no."</TE>
<TE>   The stereotypes that made his students cringe are out of date.</TE>
<TE>   In the early 1960s, Birmingham was fanatically segregated. Most
Southern cities were. Now, four decades later, the 10 most segregated
U.S. cities are all in the North, with Detroit, Milwaukee, New York,
Chicago and Newark, N.J., heading the list.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, the Northern city of York, Pa., is facing a trial just as
freighted with historical bigotry as the Cherry case: The former
mayor, who is white, has been charged in the murder of a black woman
after race riots in 1969.</TE>
<TE>   In the South, meanwhile, blacks--who couldn't even vote 40 years
ago--now hold the political power in many cities, Birmingham among
them. And there are more scenes of easy interracial interaction today
than even 10 years ago, on campuses, at parks, in offices.</TE>
<TE>   The transformation seems obvious to African Americans like Alfred
Mosley, 57. Standing outside a "Freedom Walk" dedicated to the "foot
soldiers of the civil rights movement," Mosley said he has seen good
progress since he moved to Birmingham as a boy. "I can tell you," he
said, "that my daughter, Tomica, is about to graduate from UCLA.
She's had opportunities I never dreamed of."</TE>
<TE>   Or, as one civil rights activist, Rev. Fred Shuttlesworth, put it:
"Birmingham today is not the same Birmingham."</TE>
<TE>   But for all the determined strides forward, echoes of the past
reverberate--and seem to be getting louder, Potok said. He argues
that the hatred embodied by the Cherry trial is spilling into the
21st century through the increasingly flinty rhetoric of the
neo-Confederate movement--which has been driven in part by huge
demographic shifts rocking the South.</TE>
<TE>   Over the last decade, the region has been a magnet for migrants
from all over the United States--drawing back hundreds of thousands
of blacks who left during the Jim Crow era, plus almost as many
whites seeking work or a quiet, warm place to retire.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time--and for the first time in the region's
history--foreigners have started moving to the South in droves, drawn
by low-skill agricultural work or high-tech computer jobs that are
replacing the old textile mills.</TE>
<TE>   "The 'Old South' population of native-born whites and native-born
blacks has changed. There are a lot more colors in the palette now, a
lot more faces in the crowd," said Harry Watson, director of the
Center for the Study of the American South at the University of North
Carolina.</TE>
<TE>   That transition has raised tensions among some old-guard
Southerners, who fear that their culture is being diluted by
transplants who don't speak with a drawling twang, don't reflexively
say "sir" and "ma'am," don't swear by the noble righteousness of Gen.
Robert E. Lee.</TE>
<TE>   "If people are going to come here, they need to appreciate and
become part of the South," said Kirk D. Lyons, chief counsel of the
Southern Legal Resource Center, a nonprofit preservationist group.
"People moving down here shouldn't try to bring the Bronx or Detroit
with them."</TE>
<TE>   Under siege by Yankees and foreigners, Lyons and other
traditionalists are fighting back--often by resurrecting the symbols
of the Confederacy.</TE>
<TE>   Neo-Confederate groups such as the League of the South have gained
traction, attracting an estimated 9,000 members through high-profile
fights to preserve Confederate flags and statutes of Confederate
heroes.</TE>
<TE>   The like-minded Heritage Preservation Assn. of Atlanta has
organized marches and letter-writing campaigns. "For some reason,
there are these crusaders who just love to bash us by nit-picking
every bad thing that ever happened [in the South]. We resent that,"
said Charles Lunsford, the group's president.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the Southern Legal Resource Center is taking scores of
"heritage violations" to court--mostly cases in which students are
disciplined for pinning the Confederate flag to their backpacks or
for wearing a Lee T-shirt. ("They say wearing the Confederate flag at
school is disruptive. Well, by God, so was integration," Lyons said.)</TE>
<TE>   Lyons and Lunsford dismiss the Cherry conviction as uninteresting
and unimportant. "If he committed the crime, let him rot in jail,"
Lunsford said. "The trial doesn't mean a thing to me."</TE>
<TE>   It does, however, mean something--a great deal--to Horace Huntley,
director of an oral history project at the Civil Rights Institute in
Birmingham. He sees the Cherry trial not as a symbol of the end of an
era, but as a spur to the beginning of a new one.</TE>
<TE>   He hopes no one will be satisfied with the verdict. He hopes no
one will be complacent.</TE>
<TE>   Huntley wants Birmingham--the South, the nation--to start
examining not just the bloody bigotry of the 1960s, but the economic
inequities that drag too many African Americans down even today. He
wants an honest reckoning of the insidious, subtle racism that he
says has replaced the white hoods and brass knuckles of Bobby Frank
Cherry and his buddies.</TE>
<TE>   Huntley worries a bit that the snap of the handcuffs on Cherry's
wrists suggests a curtain drawn on an era, a pat conclusion to the
horrors of the past.</TE>
<TE>   "Some would say we have made it," he said. "But we have to talk
about how we make it to the next level. Or else we will leave our
children with a mess."</TE>
<TE>   Times researcher Lianne Hart contributed to this report.</TE>

<HD>N.J. Teacher Guilty of Sex With Student Avoids Jail</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>HACKENSACK, N.J.</DL>
<LD>HACKENSACK, N.J. -- A teacher who had a sexual relationship with a
13-year-old student was sentenced to probation instead of jail by a
judge who said something had just "clicked" between the two.</LD>
<LD>   Pamela Diehl-Moore, 43, was sentenced to five years of probation
after pleading guilty to sexual assault in January. Prosecutors had
expected Diehl-Moore to be sentenced to three years in prison.</LD>
<LD>   "We are talking about a sexual assault of a little boy,"
prosecutor Martin Delaney said. "We need to send a message to these
people that this is unacceptable and you will pay with your liberty."</LD>
<TE>   Superior Court Judge Bruce Gaeta disagreed, saying people mature
at different rates.</TE>
<TE>   "It's just something between two people that clicked beyond the
teacher-student relationship," Gaeta said Wednesday. "Certainly
society doesn't need to be worried."</TE>
<TE>   Republican state Rep. Rose Heck called the sentence "shocking and
unacceptable."</TE>
<TE>   "Does that mean that he believes there should be no law against
adults having sex with minors? If so, I would suggest it is time for
this judge to be removed from the bench," Heck said Thursday.</TE>

<HD>EPA Posts First Figures on Dioxin Releases in Environment</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH SHOGREN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>For the first time, the Environmental Protection Agency on Thursday
included dioxins--industrial byproducts that cause cancer and other
health problems--in its annual list of the toxins released by
companies.</LD>
<LD>   Self-reported data from 23,000 facilities across the country
showed that 220 pounds of dioxins were released into the air and
water in 2000.</LD>
<LD>   While tiny compared with the hundreds of millions of pounds of
other pollutants discharged into the environment each year, this
amount is alarming to public health advocates because dioxins are
highly toxic in minuscule quantities.</LD>
<TE>   And unlike many chemicals, they accumulate inside the body, where
they can build to dangerous levels.</TE>
<TE>   The so-called toxics release inventory, posted on the EPA Web
site, lets individuals find out whether nearby industrial facilities
are releasing dangerous chemicals.</TE>
<TE>   "The toxics release inventory is a powerful tool to help citizens
assess local environmental conditions and to help them make decisions
about protecting their environment," said EPA Administrator Christie
Whitman.</TE>
<TE>   The program, which required industry to report the release of some
pollutants as early as 1988, has been credited with inspiring
companies to make sharp cuts in their releases of those chemicals.</TE>
<TE>   "I would hope that happens for dioxin," said Linda Greer, public
health director at the Natural Resources Defense Council, a national
environmental group.</TE>
<TE>   "It is more than a decade behind other pollutants that have had
public accountability since the late 1980s."</TE>
<TE>   Dioxins are unintentional byproducts of the manufacture of a range
of products, from paint to plastics. They are also emitted when these
and other products are burned in incinerators.</TE>
<TE>   They are known to cause cancer, attention deficit disorder,
learning disabilities, weakened immune systems, infertility and birth
defects, according to the EPA.</TE>
<TE>   "We already have too much dioxin in our bodies," said Stephen
Lester, science director for the Center for Health, Environment and
Justice. "Health effects have already been found at existing body
burden levels, and additional exposures make it more likely that our
health will suffer."</TE>
<TE>   In this latest inventory, the EPA also slashed the threshold for
reporting emissions of mercury, another highly toxic chemical that
accumulates in the environment and is hazardous in tiny amounts.
Industrial facilities formerly had to report mercury production or
use that exceeded 10,000 pounds a year, a figure that the EPA cut to
10 pounds for 2000.</TE>
<TE>   The industrial facilities covered by the latest inventory reported
releasing 4.3 million pounds of mercury into the air and water, the
majority of which came from power plants.</TE>
<TE>   "Last year the Centers for Disease Control showed that the amount
of mercury in the bodies of many women of child-bearing age was at or
above levels of concern," said Dr. John Balbus, director of the
environmental health program for Environmental Defense. The
"information released today will help us to understand where that
mercury is coming from and to start taking steps to reduce it."</TE>
<TE>   Mercury occurs naturally and is released into the air by
coal-fired power plants and other industrial facilities. In waterways
it builds up in the fish that people eat.</TE>
<TE>   Developing fetuses face the highest risks from mercury.</TE>
<TE>   At high doses, mercury can cause tremors, inability to walk,
convulsions and even death.</TE>
<TE>   Children who were exposed even to low levels of mercury in the
womb have suffered a variety of movement and learning disorders.</TE>
<TE>   Overall, the toxic release inventory showed that reported releases
dropped by 700 million pounds, or nearly 10%, to 7.1 billion pounds
from 1999 to 2000.</TE>
<TE>   California accounted for 64 million pounds of the total.</TE>
<TE>   Hard rock or metal miners again released more toxins than any
other industry, accounting for 47% of all releases reported.</TE>
<TE>   Along with gold, miners extract heavy metals such as arsenic, lead
and mercury. Most of the hard rock mining industry's discharges are
onto land, but some are into the air and waterways.</TE>
<TE>   Environmentalists said the huge quantity of toxic releases by that
industry underlines the urgency for reforming the 1872 law that
governs their activity.</TE>
<TE>   "The 21st century's largest toxic polluter shouldn't be regulated
by a 19th century law," said Alan Septoff, research director of the
Minerals Policy Center.</TE>
<TE>   They accused the Bush administration of making the problem worse
by changing an Army Corps of Engineers regulation to allow mining
companies to fill streams with the rock that miners expose to seek
gold and other metals.</TE>
<TE>   A federal judge blocked the rule change, saying it violated the
Clean Water Act. The Bush administration is appealing that ruling.</TE>
<TE>   The EPA cautioned that the database was limited because it did not
include all industries that discharged toxic chemicals.</TE>

<HD>Agency Sees Transit, Rail System Threat</HD>
<DH>Terror: Transportation Department says its warning is based
on unconfirmed data.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Department of Transportation has issued a warning about possible
attacks on rail and transit systems across the country, law
enforcement officials said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   The department's warning was based on unconfirmed and
uncorroborated information, one law enforcement official said.</LD>
<LD>   "It involves rail and transit systems ... and is about possible
attacks," he said.</LD>
<TE>   The Department of Transportation consulted the FBI before issuing
the warning, but the FBI did not put out a matching alert or advisory
to law enforcement officials across the country, the official said.</TE>
<TE>   He did not have details on how many cities' transit systems were
being put on alert.</TE>
<TE>   This is the latest in a series of warnings eight months after
hijacked airplanes slammed into the World Trade Center, the Pentagon
and a Pennsylvania field on Sept. 11, killing about 3,000 people.</TE>
<TE>   Over the last week, top U.S. officials have issued a series of
warnings of possible attacks on the United States.</TE>
<TE>   Vice President Dick Cheney warned over the weekend about the
probability that extremists could launch attacks on the United
States.</TE>
<TE>   FBI Director Robert S. Mueller III said Monday that another attack
is "inevitable" and told President Bush this week that it would be
difficult to stop another one.</TE>
<TE>   Officials said there has been a lot of intelligence coming in over
the last few weeks warning of a possible attack, but they said it
varied in terms of specificity and reliability.</TE>
<TE>   The FBI already warned this week of possible general threats
against landmarks in New York City, including the Statue of Liberty
and Brooklyn Bridge.</TE>

<HD>Generation Gap in How Brain Works Is Found</HD>
<DH>Science: New research highlights how children differ
dramatically mentally from adults.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBERT LEE HOTZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Shifting the image of youth, scientists have discovered that children
appear to use their brains to handle words far differently than do
adults, suggesting a generation gap that extends to the most
fundamental functions of the brain.</LD>
<LD>   The new research, published today in the journal Science,
highlights how dramatically children differ mentally from grown-ups,
not only because they still have so much to learn but because their
brains physically are in flux.</LD>
<LD>   "It has implications for developmental disorders and problems in
reading," said Cornell University expert B.J. Casey, who helped
pioneer brain imaging in children. "The patterns of neural activity
seem to be much more diffuse in children. If they are not as
efficient [as adults] in using their brains, they are going to be
more susceptible to interference."</LD>
<TE>   Every parent knows all too well that children have their own way
of thinking. A child's brain, however, is much more tumultuous and
much more dynamic than anyone thought, with neural growth spurts that
coincide with important leaps in early learning ability, recent
studies have shown.</TE>
<TE>   Young people lose some cognitive abilities as their brains mature
and gain others in the neural tug and pull of age and experience.</TE>
<TE>   From cradle to grave, the human brain adapts, shifts and
transforms itself in ways scientists only now are learning to
appreciate.</TE>
<TE>   Until recently, little was known about how normal human brains
change as they grow, because conventional medical imaging techniques
were too dangerous, invasive or uncomfortable for children, experts
said.</TE>
<TE>   The changing view of neural development is the brainchild of
newer, less demanding brain imaging devices, such as functional
Magnetic Resonance Imaging machines, called fMRIs, which can detect
subtle physical changes associated with mental activity.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of people think of the child's brain as a miniature version
of the adult brain," Casey said.</TE>
<TE>   The new scanning techniques are revolutionizing ideas about
childhood development. "You are seeing a ripe brain that is really
forming itself right there in front of you," she said.</TE>
<TE>   In the study, researchers at Washington University in St. Louis
combined fMRI brain scanning and simple word tasks to probe for
differences in the way brains work.</TE>
<TE>   They tested 19 children using simple word tests that required
participants to say a word in response to a written word, like a
rhyming couplet or the word's opposite. Those images then were
compared to those brain scans of 22 adults who took the same test.</TE>
<TE>   The images revealed which brain regions were actively involved in
different tasks. The study highlighted two brain regions in the left
frontal and left rear cortices, which are known to play a key role in
language processing. They also are thought to change considerably
between childhood and adulthood.</TE>
<TE>   The researchers found that children between the ages of 7 and 10
did not use their brains in quite the same way as adults performing
the same language tasks.</TE>
<TE>   The contrasts could be seen across many neural areas, but were
most noticeable in frontal brain regions associated with planning,
memory and attention. Some of the difference could be attributed to
skill and experience, while others clearly arose from age.</TE>
<TE>   In essence, children's brains seem fuzzy--more diffuse and
unfocused in some key regions of neural activity. Brain regions
necessary for crucial reading and language skills continue to develop
well into the school years, the researchers reported.</TE>
<TE>   "We found there are dozens of regions that differ between 7- to
10-year-olds and 18- to 35-year-old adults," said pediatric brain
specialist Bradley Schlaggar, who led the research team. "Depending
on age, the brain uses different components and strategies to
accomplish an identical level of performance.</TE>
<TE>   "Our results strongly suggest that functional neuroanatomy is
still developing during early school years," Schlaggar said.</TE>
<TE>   Elizabeth Bates, director of the Center for Research in Language
at UC San Diego, called the research "extraordinarily important,"
because the researchers were able to carefully document the
interaction of age, experience and skill. It allows a clearer view of
what changes can be attributed to age and what changes arise from the
neural effects of experience.</TE>
<TE>   "It has implications for developmental disorders and problems in
reading," Cornell's Casey said.</TE>
<TE>   Yale University language expert Paul Bloom viewed the new results
more cautiously, saying that brain-scanning studies often revealed
more to the eye than might actually be present.</TE>
<TE>   In particular, he said, most studies of this kind are unable to
distinguish whether variations between age groups reflect
developmental differences or whether they simply reflect the fact
that children don't perform as well overall as adults.</TE>
<TE>   Despite his reservations, Bloom said the Washington University
research was "a case study of the neural effects of learning."</TE>
<TE>   "I think these really are different parts of the brain developing
at different times for the same task."</TE>
<TE>   Schlaggar at Washington University said his group took particular
care to ensure they did not confuse the effects of age with those
neural changes caused by varying degrees of skill and expertise.</TE>
<TE>   "You have this chicken-and-egg problem," he said. "Is the
difference you see representing a true difference in the way the
brain of one group processes the information? Or is there the
difference just because one group doesn't do the task well?"</TE>
<TE>   Mirella Dapretto at the Brain Mapping Center at UCLA said the work
was important because the study took careful account of such issues
in diagnosing how growth alters the way the brain works.</TE>

<HD>New Images Show Infant Universe</HD>
<DH>Astronomy: A team from Caltech obtains the earliest visible
signals from the big bang.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>USHA LEE McFARLING</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Using radio telescopes set on a high, windy plateau in the Chilean
Andes, a team of Caltech astronomers has obtained the most detailed
snapshots yet of the early universe, revealing for the first time the
tentative seeds of matter and energy that gave birth to all structure
in the cosmos.</LD>
<LD>   The images are a swirling, tie-dye tableau of bright yellow and
orange, splotched with brighter areas that reveal temperature
differences in the fading glow of the big bang.</LD>
<LD>   These cosmic fossils show the first subtle structures to emerge
from the primordial soup that existed just 300,000 years after the
universe was created.</LD>
<TE>   "They really are seeing a whole new class of structures that were
previously unknowable," said Alan Guth, a particle physicist at MIT
who was not involved in the research.</TE>
<TE>   The new images open a portal onto creation, confirming several
radical notions about how the universe could have exploded out of a
tiny speck. They also help solve the biggest geometry problem of all
time, showing that the universe is indeed flat.</TE>
<TE>   The first images of this ancient light, called cosmic microwave
background radiation, could reveal only huge structures hundreds of
millions of light-years across. The new images show exquisitely fine
detail: blotches of light smaller than the moon. The earlier
pictures, taken a decade ago, were dubbed the face of God. These are
the freckles.</TE>
<TE>   Like a form of cosmic DNA, the freckles are blueprints for the
walls and bubbles of galaxies that form the architecture of our
universe.</TE>
<TE>   The feat was possible only because the cluster of telescopes used
in the experiment was able to detect temperature differences of a
ten-thousandth of a degree. The images show darker, redder areas that
are colder and less dense. The hotter, denser bright areas are the
embryonic clumps of galactic clusters.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the earliest visible signal we can see from the big bang,"
said Tony Readhead, a professor of astronomy at Caltech who led the
Cosmic Background Imager project.</TE>
<TE>   The images confirm the basic recipe of ingredients that many
cosmologists think make up the universe. About 5% is made of normal
matter, the kind that makes up stars, Earth, even people. Thirty-five
percent is the notoriously elusive dark matter, which has never been
detected.</TE>
<TE>   The rest of the universe is thought to be fleshed out by the even
more mysterious dark energy, a little understood commodity created by
theorists to explain the escalating clip at which the universe is
expanding.</TE>
<TE>   The findings also confirm leading theories of how the universe
expanded and evolved after the big bang, often called the standard
cosmological model. This model states that the universe grew from a
tiny, subatomic region during a violent outward expansion known as
inflation a microsecond after the big bang.</TE>
<TE>   Guth, the father of inflationary theory, said he was stunned to
see his theoretical calculations being verified with real-world
evidence. "When I first started working on these calculations in
1982, we all considered it to be great fun," he said. "I never for a
moment thought those calculations would be compared with actual
observations."</TE>
<TE>   The cosmic microwave background radiation was emitted when the
universe was still a blistering trillions of degrees but had cooled
enough that the dense, impenetrable fog of charged particles started
to coalesce into atoms, letting light and radiation escape.</TE>
<TE>   Over the 13.5 billion years or so since the big bang, the
radiation cooled to just a few degrees above absolute zero (-459.67
degrees Fahrenheit). It is this faint afterglow of radiation that
scientists now study with ultrasensitive telescopes and say is one of
the most powerful tools to understand the early universe.</TE>
<TE>   The existence of cosmic background radiation was first predicted
in the 1940s, but the ripples were not detected until 1965.</TE>
<TE>   Because earlier telescopes were not as powerful, scientists were
unable to pick out any temperature differences. This was a problem.
Without these differences, there was nothing that could evolve into
coherent structure--no galaxies, suns, stars, planets. And no humans.</TE>
<TE>   In 1992, a team at NASA and the Department of Energy's Lawrence
Berkeley National Laboratory announced they had used a NASA satellite
called the Cosmic Background Explorer Satellite, or COBE, to detect
the first temperature differences in the radiation. Those results
were immediately heralded as a missing link in cosmology and an
important verification of big-bang theory.</TE>
<TE>   The findings have since loosed a number of satellites, telescopes
and high-altitude balloons to study the radiation in more detail and
have spawned tens of thousands of scientific papers. "We didn't
understand how important this would become," said John Mather, a NASA
astronomer and co-leader of the COBE project.</TE>
<TE>   The COBE images, heralded as "wrinkles in time," were vast wisps
500 million to 10 billion light-years across that filled the sky.
They were solid proof of temperature differences but did not provide
any information about detailed structure. Newer instruments called
BOOMERANG, MAXIMA and DASI made significant advances, including
demonstrating the flatness of the universe, but were unable to
capture the elusive primordial structure as the new images have.</TE>
<TE>   The Cosmic Background Imager in Chile is 13 telescopes linked to
form an interferometer, an instrument that can gather far more
detailed information than the telescopes would separately.</TE>
<TE>   The machine is the highest-altitude scientific instrument in the
world. It is at Llano de Chajnantor, a windy, freezing Chilean
plateau at 16,700 feet, where scientists must use bottled oxygen to
work.</TE>
<TE>   The next step for those probing the radiation is to look for
polarized light waves, waves that fluctuate in a single plane instead
of a variety of directions. This could yield even higher-resolution
images and even more tantalizing details of these galactic
precursors.</TE>

<HD>UCI Moves to Save Department in Crisis</HD>
<DH>Education: Acrimony among music faculty has caused a flight
of professors and stymied hiring. In a rare step, the dean puts
outside officials in control.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The dean of UC Irvine's Claire Trevor School of the Arts has taken
the extraordinary step of putting the music department into
receivership, putting a pair of outside administrators in control of
the department for three years.</LD>
<LD>   Herb Killackey, UC Irvine's associate executive vice chancellor,
said that in the last several years the small department has suffered
an acrimonious split between classical and jazz musicians that has
made it almost impossible for it to agree on hiring of new professors
or to complete departmental business.</LD>
<LD>   "We've had several faculty leave, and we haven't been successful
in recruiting faculty," Killackey said Thursday.</LD>
<TE>   The department has dwindled to eight full-time professors and
depends on part-timers to teach many of its classes.</TE>
<TE>   Killackey said the decision was a dramatic one that Dean Jill Beck
discussed with top university administrators. He likened the move to
a bankruptcy in which a company continues to function while
restructuring itself. Asked if it represented a failure, he said,
"Yes."</TE>
<TE>   Such a move is made "only under very serious circumstances," said
Terry Hartle, senior vice president of the American Council of
Education in Washington, D.C. "Universities only do it when the
department has proven to be dysfunctional."</TE>
<TE>   Chuck McFadden, a spokesman for the University of California
system, estimated that a UC department is placed in receivership
about every five years.</TE>
<TE>   The music department was placed in receivership April 8. In a memo
to faculty, Beck said: "This means that we need to pause now for
review, redefinition and reinvestment in our music programs."</TE>
<TE>   Beck, who has been dean of the Claire Trevor School since 1995,
said the action was not punitive and downplayed it. "We've chosen
this course as a planning strategy to create an administrative
structure to allow a real vision for the department to unfold," she
said.</TE>
<TE>   The department will be run by Cameron Harvey, chairman of the
drama department, and Alan Terricciano, chairman of the dance
department.</TE>
<TE>   UC Irvine's focus on the music department is an attempt to bring
its quality to the level of the other highly ranked programs that
make of the school of the arts--dance, theater and studio art--and
not allow it to tarnish the university's reputation.</TE>
<TE>   Rae Linda Brown, an associate professor, had been running the
department. She took the job in 1999 after a nationwide search failed
to find a new department chair. Her three-year term was ended by the
receivership.</TE>
<TE>   "The dean tried to address the situation by putting a new chair in
place and had a go at it," Killackey said. "In retrospect, it didn't
appear to work."</TE>
<TE>   UC Irvine's music department has been plagued with problems for
years. A 1999 review of graduate programs by Jon Robertson, chairman
of UCLA's music department, called it "a department in crisis" that
had "continued on a downward spiral" in the previous eight years. He
said it suffered from low faculty morale, not enough money, "a total
lack of department leadership" and "an overall lack of vision
regarding the department's direction."</TE>
<TE>   Robertson wrote: "It would be criminal and educationally unethical
to allow this department to stay in its present condition or, worse,
erode further."</TE>
<TE>   After a separate review in 2000 of Beck's job performance, two
associate deans were appointed to help her manage the school of the
arts.</TE>
<TE>   As a result of the faculty openings, the department has decided
not to accept any new voice majors for the 2002-03 academic year.</TE>
<TE>   "We simply don't have the manpower to fill the obligations we put
in the catalog," Killackey said.</TE>
