<HD>A tribute to his 'sad and frenetic light'</HD>
<DH>Feltrinelli: A Story of Riches, Revolution and Violent
Death, Carlo Feltrinelli , Translated from the Italian by Alastair
McEwan, Harcourt: 344 pp., $30</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Lesley Chamberlain</AU>
<BD>Lesley Chamberlain is the author of "Nietzsche in
Turin" and "The Secret Artist: A Close Reading of Sigmund Freud."</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Giangiacomo Feltrinelli, international publisher of enormous
inherited wealth, a socialite, womanizer and radical anti-capitalist
political crusader, was, after nearly three years underground, one of
Italy's most wanted men in 1972, the year of his death. Still
troubled by its wartime Fascist past, the country was in the grip of
paranoia erupting in violence on both left and right. Feltrinelli, in
hiding, making bombs, felt he was at war. When he died in a bungled
attempt to blow up a Milan electricity pylon, his 10-year-old son was
left with a clutch of letters and memories of hugs enjoyed against
the pressure of time and political infamy.</LD>
<LD>   One reason why "Feltrinelli," Carlo's tribute to his father, is
such an engrossing story is that his father's character and motives
never become quite clear, even to those closest to him. The man who
published daring sex books, posed for Vogue, then suddenly changed in
his 40s -- in one phase wearing orange trousers before finally
letting his health go and becoming a tramp -- was always a
nonconformist and remains a mystery.</LD>
<TE>   But this thrilling biography is also a fine, unsentimental book
that captures an era we forget to our peril. As Carlo Feltrinelli
says at the conclusion, communism was not only about the East and did
not end on Dec. 25, 1989, with the execution of former Romanian
leader Nicolae Ceausescu and his wife, Elena. Communism has died many
deaths over the last three decades, and if it is dead, then it has
taken immeasurable quantities of commitment, hope, love and hatred
with it. Feltrinelli's involvement in the fate of that idea was one
of the most passionate.</TE>
<TE>   Giangiacomo Feltrinelli was born in 1926 into a family that, in
less than two generations, had risen from near-poverty to become one
of the wealthiest commercial families in Italy. His father died when
he was 9, and his mother married a man unsuitable as a stepfather and
not the best investment as a husband either. Luigi Barzini Jr. was a
bossy sybarite who played at espionage, harshly punished his stepson
and generally wasted his life in the shadow of a distinguished
journalist father.</TE>
<TE>   Giangiacomo was lonely. Both he and his sister Antonella married
quickly to escape the family. And escape had surely much to do with
Feltrinelli's communist politics from the age of 16. The proximity of
his mother to King Victor Emmanuel III repelled him. A few years into
the Italian republic, he avenged the use of the family home as one of
dictator Benito Mussolini's last hide-outs by holding a summer camp
for Marxist comrades there. As Giangiacomo later portrayed it, and as
his son agrees, his one social and emotional outlet as a boy was to
befriend the gardeners on the estate, and from this he dated his
solidarity with the working class. His sense that "ordinary people"
were exploited by the capitalist system gave shape to his hatred of
his own origins.</TE>
<TE>   Carlo begins his father's tale by expressing admiration for his
grandmother Giannalisa, though it is a barbed tribute to her
toughness and impatience that she startled even her chauffeur by
shooting a roe deer from the back seat of her Rolls-Royce. Giannalisa
was so incensed by her teenage son's politics that she arranged for
four bogus soldiers to search the house, where he had illegal
weapons, and frighten him into flight abroad. When she went to live
in Brazil, her son returned. At her son's funeral, Giannalisa
appeared in dark glasses and a black veil and told journalists that
at last her burden was lifted.</TE>
<TE>   Feltrinelli made the first of his four marriages to a Communist
activist and immersed himself in the classic Marxist literature that
structured his otherwise unimpressive intellectualizing. He was
always more of a businessman and a man of action than a thinker, but
he had a Marxist conscience. In Milan, where he founded a publishing
house, he early on created the Feltrinelli library, which made
classic Socialist texts available, ideally for workers' study. Many
of the library's first editions, sought out personally by Feltrinelli
in trips across Europe, were later coveted by an envious Moscow.</TE>
<TE>   In that library, he built a shrine to his self-taught achievement,
and vanity and self-justification certainly played their parts in his
life. After he fell out with the Communists over the Soviet invasion
of Hungary in 1956, he went his own way as an anti-capitalist,
pro-worker utopian. What made his stance possible and admirable to
many, even to those who were suspicious of his origins, was not only
that he had the money to finance real campaigns to pursue socialist
change but also that he was prepared to spend it.</TE>
<TE>   In his most appealing and intelligible guise, he thought he could
improve humanity through books. Giangiacomo Feltrinelli Editore
Milano became the copyright line of a highly successful left-wing
house, though its great triumphs were purely humanitarian- artistic:
Boris Pasternak's "Dr. Zhivago" and Giuseppe di Lampedusa's "The
Leopard." The story of how Feltrinelli defied Soviet authorities to
become Pasternak's savior by pioneering publication of the uncensored
text is both touching and intriguing. His coming to awareness of the
pressures on Pasternak, and of the maneuvers that had to be gone
through to establish reliable communication, highlight his idealistic
innocence and goodwill at the age of 33. The exchange of secret
letters with Pasternak is published here for the first time.</TE>
<TE>   Feltrinelli took emotional batterings several times, though the
worst had already happened by the time he emerged from childhood as a
shy and mumbling adolescent. He found compensation in the 1960s
fashion for defying all authority. His personal liberation produced a
revolution in marketing. Half a dozen Feltrinelli bookshops across
Italy suddenly became hip places that sold trinkets from London's
Carnaby Street and played dance music. The house published sex
manuals and Henry Miller's "Tropic of Cancer" and "Tropic of
Capricorn."</TE>
<TE>   These were Feltrinelli's glittering years, when he was surrounded
by the emerging and established big names in literature, including
Umberto Eco, Alberto Moravia, Italo Calvino and Gabriel Garcia
Marquez. Carlo Feltrinelli remembers constant illustrious visitors to
the house. His father's third marriage, in 1959 to the beautiful
photographer Inge Schoenthal, gave him a fine family base at a time
when he was most impressive to outsiders. Charles Rogers, the U.S.
consul general in Milan, recommended him for a visa despite his
communist past, sending this perceptive comment to Washington: "He
believes there is a parallel between the pressures to which the
individual is subjected as a result of the imposition of doctrine by
a tyrannical government under Communism and those self-induced
pressures of standardization and social convention under capitalism."</TE>
<TE>   By 1966, however, when Feltrinelli met his fourth wife-to-be,
20-year-old boutique owner Sibilla, and had already made two long
visits to Cuba to urge Castro to write his memoirs, he was already on
his way into a kind of madness. He told a glossy magazine in 1967
that he was not so much taken with Castroism but that "being in
direct contact with a concrete environment like the Cuban one can
change something in your life."</TE>
<TE>   That same year he was arrested in Bolivia while nominally pursuing
Che Guevara's diary. Not long after, a friend said he had gone off
the rails because he "had fallen in love with an analogy." He sent
food and live hens to Cuba and wrote an essay on the Italian
situation called "Guerrilla Warfare and Revolutionary Politics."</TE>
<TE>   Feltrinelli was ready for the rise of the student movements in
France and Germany when they came in 1968. His son remembers chatting
in the family home (still with Inge Schoenthal) to a recuperating
Rudi Dutschke, a radical German student leader shot on the streets of
Berlin by a right-wing extremist. Who was this Feltrinelli, now
demonstrating in Berlin, now sporting a pink jacket, now urging armed
resistance to an imminent Fascist coup d'etat? "He came across as
brilliant and powerful, with a touch of folly," wrote an Italian
journalist. "In his eyes shone a sad and frenetic light," recalled
Russian poet Andrey Voznesensky.</TE>
<TE>   Many people were unsure whether they liked Giangiacomo
Feltrinelli, but clearly his son, Inge and his secretary Tina loved
him. Foreigners, outsiders, sex and fashion helped the human being
called Feltrinelli escape himself. "All the lonely people, where do
they all come from?" Carlo Feltrinelli asks finally, echoing the
Beatles' song of the epoch. Sadly, he writes, his father's life "did
not unleash the power of symbol, it triggered displacement or
caricature."</TE>

<HD>Their lives, her camera, full of passion</HD>
<DH>Dorothea Lange: The Heart and Mind of a Photographer,
Edited by Pierre Borhan, Bulfinch Press: 264 pp., $75</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Linda Gordon</AU>
<BD>Linda Gordon is writing a biography of Dorothea Lange.
Her most recent book is "The Great Arizona Orphan Abduction." She
teaches history at NYU.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dorothea Lange's Depression photographs -- a worried, pensive Okie
mother with her children, discouraged farmers squatting in the dust,
black and white sharecroppers, Mexican and Filipino lettuce workers
-- are familiar even to those who don't know her name.</LD>
<LD>   Because Lange was a photographer of unusual emotional power, a few
of her pictures were reproduced so often that they became virtual
cliches. They served as 1930s icons of "the deserving poor." They
built support for Franklin D. Roosevelt and the New Deal and inspired
"The Grapes of Wrath." But thousands of never-published Lange
masterpieces hide in folders and on microfilm in the Library of
Congress, the National Archives and the Oakland Museum of California.
Her work also includes exotic portraits of elegant women, imperious
portraits of powerful men, romantic portraits of Pueblo Indians,
shimmering abstractions, glimpses of tender and painful intimate
moments, and a series that denounced the Japanese American internment
during World War II as explicitly as a legal brief.</LD>
<LD>   French photo curator Pierre Borhan's new book, "Dorothea Lange:
The Heart and Mind of a Photographer," demonstrates Lange's breadth
by joining some of her most famous images with some little-known
facets of her work. (An exhibit of Lange's work called "About Life:
The Photographs of Dorothea Lange" is now at the Getty Center through
Feb. 9, 2003.)</LD>
<TE>   Lange, born in Hoboken, N.J., in 1895, went to the Bay Area in
1919 and never left. She constructed a life with mystical edges, as
when at age 14, having never held a camera, she told her mother that
she wanted to be a photographer, believing that a disability from
childhood polio gave her an almost telepathic connection with those
who suffered. But mainly she constructed a life through discipline
and patient work. First married to Western painter Maynard Dixon, she
supported their family with her photography studio in San Francisco.
Her insightful and slightly eccentric portraits made her the favored
portraitist of the city's elite -- the Fleishhackers, Zellerbachs,
Strausses -- as well as the artistic elite, such as Yehudi Menuhin,
Mischa Elman, Ernst Bloch.</TE>
<TE>   In these San Francisco years, lasting until 1935, she lived a
bohemian life, socializing with her husband's artist friends in cheap
Italian restaurants, venturing on her own to San Quentin to
photograph framed union organizer Tom Mooney, hosting Diego Rivera
and Frida Kahlo when they visited.</TE>
<TE>   As the Depression hit, her rich clients and her marriage began to
seem confining beyond her endurance. She started to move around San
Francisco, photographing darker, poorer, more intense scenes. These
pictures came to the attention of Berkeley economist/reformer Paul
Schuster Taylor, who hired her to illustrate his exposes of the
brutal working and living conditions of migrant farm workers. Lange
fell doubly in love, with Taylor and with the challenges and rewards
of this so-called documentary photography (a phrase she hated).</TE>
<TE>   From 1935 to 1945, she did most of her work for the U.S. Farm
Security Administration, documenting -- along with Walker Evans,
Arthur Rothstein, Ben Shahn and others -- the Dust Bowl, agricultural
poverty, and, later, wartime defense workers. She slowed her pace
considerably for the next 20 years, fighting illness, but she turned
out superb, lasting work until her death in 1965.</TE>
<TE>   Borhan has made a beautiful book. The heavyweight production, with
thick, creamy paper and 260 elegantly printed photographs, presents
both the complexity and the unity of Lange's work. Including some of
her slightly eccentric studio portraits allows us to see that her
"documentary" work trained on the poor the same respect and insight
that she had afforded the rich. Snapshots she took of her children
running around naked hint at her bohemian sensibility and, as critic
Sally Stein has argued, her extraordinary sensitivity to bodies --
some of her most revealing images show only people's backs.</TE>
<TE>   Her first street pictures, from 1933 and 1934, merged this uncanny
feel for the language of face, body and gesture with classic
composition and concise communication of social context. Always a
portraitist, she never sought to capture her subjects unaware, as a
photojournalist might. She felt that her subjects needed time to
relax into their natural body language; she often recorded their
histories in a notebook. She required their collaboration to make
photographs, she said.</TE>
<TE>   This collection will not challenge the judgment that she did her
strongest work from 1935 to 1945. Far from bureaucratizing her
pictures, a government salary gave her freedom to dig ever deeper
into her genius. In a twist on gender patterns, she first married a
man dependent on her, financially and otherwise; her second husband
supported her in every way. Indeed, the Lange-Taylor collaboration
was one of the great romantic-intellectual-artistic-political
partnerships (think O'Keeffe and Stieglitz, De Beauvoir and Sartre).
Taylor's commitment to social justice and expertise on California
agriculture helped Lange interpret what she saw.</TE>
<TE>   Borhan provides a selection of fine photos Lange took while
accompanying Taylor as he studied agriculture in underdeveloped
countries. Despite the foreignness of these cultures, Lange's eye for
expressive gesture and composition remained keen. Perhaps the best of
her late work was her series on a public defender, part of a project
she campaigned for but never got funded: documenting urban America as
the Farm Security Administration had documented the countryside.</TE>
<TE>   The book includes brief essays, several translated from the
French, that offer glimpses of Lange's charisma, generosity,
stubbornness and willfulness. Critic A.D. Coleman praises Lange and
Taylor's nearly forgotten book on the Dust Bowl migration, "An
American Exodus." A Borhan essay encapsulates the technology, art and
politics at the time, but he misses the personal passion of Lange's
politics. She was not a Red, although she was in complete sympathy
with some of the Communist-led causes of the period, such as the farm
workers' struggles, the San Francisco general strike of 1934 and the
defense of the Scottsboro Boys. Borhan's assertion that "It is not
really in the nature of Americans to want to transform the world" is
an example of his failure to grasp the political context that shaped
her. In general, the essays offer little that is original -- the
essays in Elizabeth Partridge's 1994 "Restless Spirit: The Life and
Work of Dorothea Lange" are better. But Lange's photographs have
bodies and voice enough.</TE>

<DH>Reagan's War: The Epic Story of His 40-Year Struggle and
Final Triumph Over Communism, Peter Schweizer, Doubleday: 288 pp.,

<AU>Jacob Heilbrunn</AU>
<BD>Jacob Heilbrunn is an editorial writer for The Times.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The president has largely discredited the United States with his wild
rhetoric about an evil foreign enemy. Bombing raids in the Middle
East have incurred the ire of the Arab world. When he visits Italy,
demonstrators throng the streets with placards calling him a
warmonger and an executioner. At home, the country is embroiled in a
debate about whether the White House's recklessly provocative
unilateralism is going to lead to world war.</LD>
<LD>   This might sound like George W. Bush on the eve of war with Iraq,
but it also describes the popular view of Ronald Reagan during the
Cold War. The parallels are anything but accidental. Bush has staffed
his foreign policy team with former Reagan officials, ranging from
Deputy Defense Secretary Paul D. Wolfowitz to the hawkish Richard
Perle. Their conviction is simple: The Cold War provides the model
for American foreign policy. Just as Reagan's confrontational
policies destroyed the Soviet empire, so Bush's tough-minded actions
will defeat terrorism and permanently ensure American global
dominance.</LD>
<TE>   But will they? In drawing on the Reagan era, are Bush
administration officials following a sure-fire guideline for success
or a roadmap to disaster? Was Reagan really a visionary or merely a
bumbling dunderhead who happened to be president when the Soviet
Union imploded simply because of its own weaknesses? Or are the doves
opposed to the Bush administration the true fossils of the Cold War
era? The end of the Cold War has not stilled the debates about the
merits of militancy abroad but rather given them a new lease on life.</TE>
<TE>   Peter Schweizer's "Reagan's War" thus arrives at an opportune
moment. Schweizer, a fellow at the Hoover Institution, makes a
rousing and compelling case that Reagan's personal and political
odyssey, beginning with his days in Hollywood and concluding with his
presidency, was central to bringing down the "evil empire." Indeed,
Schweizer argues that Reagan had it right from the beginning. He
broke with the passivity of his predecessors to change America's goal
from containment to the outright overthrow of the Soviet Union.</TE>
<TE>   Schweizer has conducted numerous interviews with former Soviet and
American officials and drawn on archives in the former Warsaw Pact
countries. He confines himself to Reagan's role in the Cold War,
which makes for a coherent and gripping narrative. But he may have
stumbled upon an even bigger story: the transformation of the GOP
from being dominated by Wall Street internationalists to being taken
over by hawkish Sunbelt conservatives.</TE>
<TE>   As Schweizer reminds us, Reagan cut his anti-Communist teeth in
Hollywood after World War II. As an admirer of Franklin D. Roosevelt
and Harry S. Truman, Reagan was a Cold War liberal who saw Stalinist
aggression as a fundamental threat to the United States and Western
Europe. Confronted in 1946 with the specter of Communists trying to
take over Hollywood's major labor unions, including the Screen Actors
Guild, Schweizer says, Reagan began what would be a lifetime crusade
against the "Red Menace": "He was passionate about it, attending
meetings, reading up on the subject of communism, talking endlessly
about it with friends." His wife, Jane Wyman, thought he had lost it.
She divorced Reagan and married pacifist movie actor Lew Ayres, who
had sat out World War II in a conscientious objectors' camp in
Oregon.</TE>
<TE>   Reagan was undaunted. He became president of the Screen Actors
Guild and campaigned full time against Communist influence. But
Schweizer takes pains to show that Reagan was not a Red-baiter: He
opposed Truman's loyalty oath program for all federal employees and
viewed Sen. Joseph McCarthy (R-Wis.) as a loose cannon, although he
never attacked him publicly. Reagan's belief was that communism was
weak and would crumble as long as the West confronted it and did not
become fearful.</TE>
<TE>   As Schweizer tells it, Reagan became progressively dismayed with
U.S. presidents for their timidity in confronting the Soviet bear.
President Eisenhower's caution left him cold: Reagan delivered a
stream of speeches in the 1950s declaring that the U.S. was
economically superior to the USSR and needed to grind it into the
dust by spending the Soviet Union into the ground militarily. In
October 1964, Reagan's message hit the big time: He delivered a
nationally televised speech for Republican presidential candidate
Barry Goldwater that sounded his uncompromising theme -- victory or
defeat -- and $8 million poured into the beleaguered campaign. "The
GOP," says Schweizer, "which had for so long been a liberal party,
was now being reborn as a conservative party ...."</TE>
<TE>   But Reagan's dismay with the GOP only increased once Richard Nixon
and Henry A. Kissinger endorsed detente with the Soviet Union.
Kissinger's de facto recognition of Eastern Europe as a Soviet sphere
of influence was anathema to Reagan. As California governor, Reagan
lost none of his fervor for foreign policy. Schweizer shows that
Reagan was an instant convert to an antiballistic missile system in
the late 1960s: "[A]t the 1969 Republican Governors Association
meeting in Louisville, he took the unusual step of giving an
impassioned presentation in favor of the system to his fellow
governors," asking them to pass a resolution supporting deployment.</TE>
<TE>   Schweizer also explains that Reagan was profoundly influenced by
two books written by his friend, lawyer and amateur historian
Laurence Beilenson. In 1969, Beilenson wrote a book called "Treaty
Trap" which argued that arms-control treaties were useless. He also
wrote a book, "Power Through Subversion," that pushed for supporting
insurgents and guerrilla armies in the struggle against Moscow.
According to Schweizer, "for Reagan, a good idea was a good idea
regardless of whom it came from, and he would adopt Beilenson's ideas
and turn them into an approach to foreign policy that came to be
called the Reagan Doctrine."</TE>
<TE>   For Schweizer, Reagan was fully vindicated. By boosting military
spending, aiding the Nicaraguan Contras and Afghan rebels and
championing the Strategic Defense Initiative, or "Star Wars," Reagan
destroyed the Soviet Union. He quotes one of Mikhail S. Gorbachev's
former foreign policy assistants, Georgy Shakhnazarov, as saying that
Gorbachev was selected as leader as a result of "internal domestic
pressures and Reagan's rigid position and that of his
administration."</TE>
<TE>   Certainly, Reagan's uncompromising line came as a cataleptic shock
to a Kremlin that had become accustomed to American overtures, not
rhetorical bellicosity. But Schweizer's story line is too pat. The
truth is that other factors came into play. As former CIA Director
Robert Gates has noted in his memoirs, numerous weapon systems that
came on line in the Reagan administration were initially approved by
his despised predecessor, Jimmy Carter. Detente, as practiced by both
the United States and Western Europe, did soften up the Soviet
empire, particularly in the form of the Helsinki human rights
accords. Nor can the internal debility of the Soviet Union be
ignored: Reagan's policies exacerbated, but did not create, the
disastrous economic performance of the communist system.</TE>
<TE>   Above all, Schweizer fails to point out that Reagan ended up being
much more flexible than his advisors, excepting his prescient
secretary of State, George P. Shultz. To the distress of Caspar W.
Weinberger and others, Reagan actually believed his own rhetoric
about peace through strength. No sooner did Gorbachev come upon the
scene than Reagan embraced him and carried out radical arms cuts to
the extent of proposing, at the 1986 Reykjavik Summit, the abolition
of nuclear arms.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Schweizer correctly maintains that Reagan represented a
radical break with the containment policies that had characterized
American foreign policy during the Cold War. The once-regnant
establishment conservatives have been shunted aside. The boisterous
Sunbelt movement that Reagan led has now reached full potency in the
Bush administration, but whether it is truly a success story is about
to be tested in Iraq.</TE>

<BD>Tom Nolan is the author of "Ross Macdonald: A
Biography" and the editor of "Strangers in Town: Three Newly
Discovered Mysteries by Ross Macdonald."
&lt;Subhead&gt;From 'Farewell, My Lovely'</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Let's take it from the top. All right, Marlowe, you're on the air:</LD>
<LD>   "It was about eleven o'clock in the morning, mid October, with the
sun not shining and a look of hard wet rain in the clearness of the
foothills. I was wearing my powder-blue suit, with dark blue shirt,
tie and display handkerchief, black brogues, black wool socks with
dark blue clocks on them. I was neat, clean, shaved and sober, and I
didn't care who knew it. I was everything the well-dressed private
detective ought to be. I was calling on four million dollars."</LD>
<LD>   That's the distinctive voice of Philip Marlowe, the fictional Los
Angeles private eye and first-person narrator of Raymond Chandler's
seven novels, announcing his self-assured presence on the California
literary landscape in the opening paragraph of Chandler's first book,
"The Big Sleep."</LD>
<TE>   With that voice of Marlowe's, wised-up but still romantic,
Chandler told knowing tales of L.A. for 20 years -- from 1939, when
there were streetcars on Hollywood Boulevard and orange groves beyond
Pasadena, to 1959, when freeways were pushing ever west into the new
suburbs of the San Fernando Valley. Through Marlowe's voice, Chandler
defined Los Angeles for generations of readers around the globe.</TE>
<TE>   How often it's the out-of-town artist, with an outsider's
sharpened vision, who best sums up a city and its natives. Virgil, a
hick from the Mantuan sticks, became the greatest bard of Rome. The
provincial Balzac was the perfect guide to 19th century Paris. And a
mystery writer named Raymond Chandler -- born in Chicago, schooled in
England -- was posthumously crowned prose-poet laureate of Los
Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Chandler won the laurels through his remarkable style, full of
verve and color and a seemingly endless parade of sentences that
demand to be quoted. He possessed, among other tools, what Sue
Grafton (one of Chandler's many literary children and grandchildren)
has called "the mean eye," and he used it without much mercy. The
books zing with thumbnail bull's-eyes:</TE>
<TE>   "His smile was as cunning as a broken mousetrap."</TE>
<TE>   "Suspicion climbed all over her face, like a kitten, but not so
playfully."</TE>
<TE>   "Fuzz grew out of his ears, far enough to catch a moth."</TE>
<TE>   "She was as cute as a washtub."</TE>
<TE>   "He had beautiful teeth, but they hadn't grown in his mouth."</TE>
<TE>   "She looked almost as hard to get as a haircut."</TE>
<TE>   "His chin would never hit a wall before he saw it."</TE>
<TE>   "There was lace at her throat, but it was the kind of throat that
would have looked better in a football sweater."</TE>
<TE>   "To say she had a face that would have stopped a clock would have
been to insult her. It would have stopped a runaway horse."</TE>
<TE>   But if one eye was mean, the other was susceptible to romance.
Chandler also wrote mesmeric and evocative passages such as this one:
"We went west, dropped over to Sunset and ... curved through the
bright mile or two of the Strip ... past the gleaming new nightclubs
with famous chefs and equally famous gambling rooms .... Past all
this and down a wide smooth curve to the bridle path of Beverly Hills
and lights to the south, all colors of the spectrum and crystal clear
in an evening without fog, past the shadowed mansions up on the hills
to the north, past Beverly Hills altogether and up into the twisting
foothill boulevard and the sudden cool dusk and the drift of wind
from the sea."</TE>
<TE>   Chandler's visions of L.A. -- half-hard-boiled, half-lyrical --
proved irresistible not only to readers but also to Hollywood. The
Marlowe books inspired several movies, a radio show and television
series in both the black-and-white and cable eras. Other writers have
created dozens of Marlowe imitators and successors for the page and
screen. In recent years, there have been estate-authorized Marlowe
"sequels" and Chandler "collaborations." Biographies have made
Chandler's own exploits nearly as well-known as Marlowe's, and the
author's collected correspondence has proved as quotable as his
fiction.</TE>
<TE>   In the last half-century's smog of homage, imitation and
nostalgia, it's been easy to lose sight of Chandler's own work.
Returning to the books themselves -- as this season's reprints of
Raymond Chandler's novels and short stories in both hardcover and
paperback create the occasion to do -- can be a revelation.</TE>
<TE>   Read anew, Chandler's work seems as fresh and dazzling as ever. Of
the seven novels, four can fairly be called masterpieces; and two of
the three others, although flawed, have long flashes of brilliance.</TE>
<TE>   In Chandler's debut detective novel, 1939's "The Big Sleep," the
(for-now) sober Philip Marlowe is hired by that millionaire from the
first paragraph, the aged General Sternwood, to keep blackmailers and
gamblers from bothering one or both of his two high-living daughters.
The case soon opens up to include a pornography racket, a missing
ex-bootlegger and several corpses, in a plot that races all over the
Thomas Bros. map: Pasadena to West Hollywood to the ocean, Laurel
Canyon to beyond Bunker Hill.</TE>
<TE>   "The Big Sleep," beautifully paced and written, in some ways
remains Chandler's best book -- for its energy, its sense of Southern
California history and the feeling it gives of showing what "really"
goes on in a big town behind the civic facade. "Old" money, reckless
youth, suave mobsters, common grifters, stony-faced cops -- and in
the middle, Marlowe: wise-cracking, mostly likable and following a
private code of ethics that he remembers as he goes along.</TE>
<TE>   "Farewell, My Lovely" (1940), Chandler's great next book, is even
broader in scope than "The Big Sleep," and at times more comic. The
comedy helps make bearable an L.A. that can be as horrible as
Nathanael West's, whose "The Day of the Locust" was published the
same year as "The Big Sleep."</TE>
<TE>   The "entertainers" Marlowe glimpses in a shabby pile of publicity
photos in "Farewell" would be right at home in West's "suicide note"
of a novel (as Chandler called "Locust"): "Hoofers and comics from
the filling station circuit. Not many of them would ever get west of
Main Street. You would find them in tanktown vaudeville acts, cleaned
up, or down in the cheap burlesque houses, as dirty as the law
allowed ... grinning, sadistically filthy and as rank as the smell of
stale sweat. The women had good legs .... But their faces were as
threadbare as a bookkeeper's office coat. Blondes, brunettes, large
cowlike eyes with a peasant dullness in them. Small sharp eyes with
urchin greed in them. One or two of the faces obviously vicious."</TE>
<TE>   Marlowe seeks a woman named Velma, who's escaped this sordid
milieu, on behalf of one Moose Malloy, an oversize thug carrying a
torch to match. The soon-deadly hunt takes him from Central Avenue
joints to seaside mansions, from a "fakeloo" psychic's parlor to a
gambling ship anchored off "Bay City" (a.k.a. Santa Monica). The
book's voice -- Marlowe's -- seems objective, poetic and personal all
at once, giving both the geographic specifics of the journey and the
sense of nearly audible music beyond some distant hill.</TE>
<TE>   The feel is lighter still in the satisfying "The High Window"
(1942), in which Marlowe tries to retrieve a valuable coin stolen
from a private collection. It's as if, having given the lay of the
land in his first two books, the author is able now to relax and
write a more streamlined, straight-ahead story. Not that the case is
simple, of course; before long, the missing (or is it?) coin leads to
murder. Once again, Chandler achieves his literary goal of writing
scenes that seem never to have been written before, scenes that
shimmer with smart dialogue and those patented descriptions.</TE>
<TE>   Also elegant and enjoyable in its unfolding is "The Lady in the
Lake" (1943), written (and reflecting homefront conditions) during
World War II. A downtown business executive asks Marlowe to find his
estranged wife, missing after a trip to Little Fawn Lake (read Big
Bear). The detective goes up to the man's vacation cabin and there
makes a grisly discovery.</TE>
<TE>   These mountain scenes have an airy feel, in keeping with their
setting. Chandler didn't keep writing the same book over and over but
varied his approach, trying for different effects. It's surprising to
see the range he achieved, in mood and structure, within the
private-eye form he was so responsible for popularizing.</TE>
<TE>   Less pleasant to note is Chandler's casual use of racial and other
slurs; although, technically, it's Marlowe who refers to various
characters in the seven novels as a "fat greasy sensual Jew," a
"short dirty wop," a "nice-mannered Jap," a "pansy," a "big buck
Negro," a "greaseball" and the like. "It was the times," we may say
in partial excuse (although 1953, when "The Long Goodbye" was
published, seems a bit late in the century to be calling a Mexican
houseman "a cockroach in a white jacket"); and indeed, other great
writers used similar language. But it's no more fun to find it in
Chandler than in Hemingway, Mencken, Eliot or any other American
master.</TE>
<TE>   "The Lady in the Lake," with its exciting finale, is the last
completely pleasing Chandler novel. It would be six years between it
and the next Marlowe book, "The Little Sister" (1949) -- six years
during which Chandler earned much money writing screenplays and
stored up much bad feeling toward Hollywood. "The Little Sister,"
which has Marlowe trying to help a movie actress become disentangled
from blackmailers and racketeers, seems burdened with Chandler's own
movie-studio grievances. Although the book has many good passages,
there are also several sour Marlowe diatribes against modern
California. Chandler's urban knight-errant is getting older and
crabbier. There's also a jarring disparity between "The Little
Sister's" realistic sequences and its sillier-seeming interludes. One
wants to say to Chandler what Marlowe tells someone in another book:
"You're slipping your clutch."</TE>
<TE>   Read in order, Chandler's novels form a sort of vexed Marlowe's
Progress: from professional copaceticism to personal confusion. In
"Farewell, My Lovely," a placid Marlowe says of the detective
business: "There's not much money in it. There's a lot of grief. But
there's a lot of fun too. And there's always a chance of a big case."
By "The Little Sister," however, the P.I. is talking to himself with
a desperation that's only semi-comical: "Who am I cutting my throat
for this time? ... I don't know. All I know is that something isn't
what it seems and ... the wrong person is going to lose the pot. Is
that my business? Well, what is my business? Do I know? Did I ever
know? Let's not go into that."</TE>
<TE>   Marlowe's ambivalence escalates in the more subdued and ambitious
"The Long Goodbye," in which detective, author and client all seem to
be wrestling with interchangeable questions of self-worth, alcohol,
honor, the meaning of life and the value of writing.</TE>
<TE>   In one strand of this long book's plot, Marlowe helps a friend
elude the law and flee to Mexico the morning after the murder of his
wife (the friend insists he's innocent). In the other half of the
story's double-helix, Marlowe attempts to keep an alcoholic
popular-novelist from hurting himself or others while he finishes his
latest manuscript.</TE>
<TE>   "The Long Goodbye" seems sprawling and self-indulgent, annoying in
its complexity and arbitrary in its moralizing. Yet it contains some
of Chandler's most memorable paragraphs (including Marlowe's
oft-quoted catalog beginning: "There are blondes and blondes ... ")
and several convincing encounters between Marlowe and the cops --
good cops, bad cops and ones in between.</TE>
<TE>   Scenes with police were a Chandler specialty, giving drama and
credence to his fiction from the start. All the elements of
Chandler's great talent were present even in his apprentice work, two
dozen or so eminently readable "Collected Stories," the first of
which saw print (in pulp magazines) six years before "The Big Sleep."</TE>
<TE>   By the time of Chandler's final Marlowe book, "Playback" (1958),
only faint glimmers of that once-bright talent remained. Built on the
framework of an unproduced Chandler screenplay, "Playback" does not
properly belong in the Marlowe canon. Yet even this weak work is not
without interest, and even merit, as the last game effort of an
extraordinary writer who imaginatively and magically rendered his
place and period for all time.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   From 'Farewell, My Lovely'</TE>
<TE>   "TROUBLE," he said softly. "A little trouble."</TE>
<TE>   He turned in his chair and crossed his thick legs and gazed
thoughtfully towards one of his pairs of windows. That let me see
handspun lisle socks and English brogues that looked as if they had
been pickled in port wine. Counting what I couldn't see and not
counting his wallet he had half a grand on him. I figured his wife
had money.</TE>
<TE>   "Trouble," he said, still softly, "is something our little city
don't know much about, Mr. Marlowe. Our city is small but very, very
clean. I look out of my western windows and I see the Pacific Ocean.
Nothing cleaner that that, is there?" He didn't mention the two
gambling ships that were hull down on the brass waves just beyond the
three-mile limit.</TE>
<TE>   Neither did I. "That's right, Chief," I said.</TE>

<LD>Great Dream of Heaven: Stories, Sam Shepard, Alfred A. Knopf: 160
pp., $20</LD>
<LD>   Character and landscape compete in western fiction. Sometimes
characters cross the border into cartoonhood, and sometimes they
coexist gracefully with the overwhelming beauty of their natural
context. Sam Shepard is a student of character, but his are not
cartoons. They are too flexible, too fallible. His playwriting skills
-- dialogue, monologue, timing and conceit -- make his fiction
shimmer with a brutal clarity. This is especially evident in these
stories, which, like much of Shepard's writing, are about bad fathers
-- emotionally reckless, violent, absent -- intellectual cowards who
inflict shame and worse on their sons.</LD>
<LD>   In the story "The Remedy Man," a character who tames unruly horses
("not a horse whisperer") is called out to cure a horse and cures, in
the process, a 14-year-old boy locked in his father's world: "E.V.
winked at me and in that wink I understood there might be grown men
in this world who actually get a spark out of life and somehow manage
to dodge the black hole my dad had fallen into." Shepard has a nice
way of burying the "I" in his stories, which often end in a vista.
Rather than getting closer, the fathers recede into the distance
while the sons move on.</LD>

<TE>   Counting My Chickens And Other Home Thoughts, The Duchess of
Devonshire, Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux: 176 pp., $20</TE>
<TE>   "To be in love with Debo Devonshire is hardly a distinction,"
writes Tom Stoppard in his introduction to these reminiscences by the
sister of Jessica Mitford and lady of one of the great houses of the
world, Chatsworth in Derbyshire. Reading her accounts of gardening
("Moss is the thing") and communists ("to be in their presence was a
lowering thing"), one must glance back and forth between the chummy
nicknames in the text and the footnotes explaining their identities.</TE>
<TE>   The duchess, age "four score plus," expresses great befuddlement
at such things as televisions, computers and note paper with
addresses on the bottom, but stunning equanimity regarding such
subjects as windows and war atrocities, things that tend to receive
similar emphasis. The subject of class, "which people go on about now
almost as much as they do about sex," is far less fascinating to the
duchess than the minutes of the meeting of the local Dry Stone
Walling Assn. The luxurious pace of the memoir is extremely relaxing.
All it takes is a little willing suspension of political beliefs.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Consciousness and the Novel: Connected Essays, David Lodge,
Harvard University Press: 272 pp., $24.95</TE>
<TE>   You have to watch out for David Lodge, one of our most brilliant
critics. He has a tendency to lead a reader down a very long tunnel.
Conveniently, he is the only person who knows the way out, and this
creates a slavish devotion to his views. Stand firm! But read on.</TE>
<TE>   Lodge looks at the differences between literary and scientific
ideas of consciousness. In literature, he quotes Noam Chomsky (the
"dense specificity of personal experience" is unique from character
to character). Physicist Gerald Edelman writes that events are far
denser than scientific explanation; in Joseph Conrad's words, the
best that literature can do is make you feel before it makes you see.</TE>
<TE>   Lodge explains the concept of "qualia," a word used in both
cultures to describe the "specific nature of our subjective
experience of the world," like the "smell of coffee or the taste of
pineapple." Lodge writes about the modern novel with its placement of
narrative within consciousness, sometimes sacrificing "narrative
cohesion," in contrast to classical novels in which characters are
created from the outside in. He applies these thoughts to the work of
Henry James, John Updike, Philip Roth, Amis pere et fils, E.M.
Forster, Evelyn Waugh and Charles Dickens. A woman might have been
nice.</TE>

<AU>Eugen Weber</AU>
<BD>Eugen Weber is a contributing writer to Book Review.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Q is for Quarry," Sue Grafton's 17th Santa Teresa caper, begins at
Grayson Quarry beside Highway 1 near Lompoc, just north of Santa
Teresa, where the corpse of an unknown girl is found in the summer of
1969. The Jane Doe and her killer remain unidentified and the mystery
unsolved until a lifetime later when the two police detectives who
failed to crack the case get back on the trail. They are both retired
and afflicted with the ills of age; reopening the case provides an
interest.</LD>
<LD>   To do their legwork, they bring in our old acquaintance and
theirs, Kinsey Milhone P.I., who is only too glad for field work that
will get her away from the record searches and other routines with
which she earns her keep. Interrupted only by doctors' appointments
and hospital stays, punctuated by drinking and smoking sessions that
Kinsey deplores, the sinuous search on which the three embark takes
them up and down the Central Coast, inland to the desert near the
California-Arizona line, into the thickets of small town intimacies
and the meanderings of family histories.</LD>
<TE>   As pages turn, the details get more detailed, sentiments more
sentimental (although to Kinsey, bless her, most children look
interchangeable), solipsisms more solipsistic and provincialism more
stubbornly provincial. The drizzle of detail decelerates the action.
The story opens slowly, ambles on, then gathers momentum. The process
of discovery is not reasoned through but eased out of red herrings
and false trails, conjectured and worked out as Kinsey presses on
until her and her friends' quarry has been run to ground. This is not
one of Grafton's finest, which means that it's still better than many
mysteries and well worth the read.</TE>
<TE>   In Stuart Woods' "Blood Orchid," on the other hand, everything
moves fast. We get no soul-searching, little sentiment, lots of
action with little to stand in its way, lots of complications and
temptations for the reader to guess what's going on. Holly Barker is
chief of police in a small Florida town, Orchid Beach, where a prime
oceanfront property that the government confiscated from a
drug-running cartel has just been sold to a developer named Ed Shine.
An orchid fancier, Shine narrowly escapes being shot while he shows
off his latest creation, the Blood Orchid, to Holly and her father.
And the inquiry into the shooting escalates when it turns out that
two other developers bidding for the property have been more
successfully bumped off. The plot thickens as the FBI enters the
probe, and Holly's life becomes pleasantly complicated as Shine seems
to court her and as an FBI agent pursues her rather than more
criminal quarries.</TE>
<TE>   Commerce and criminality intermesh, as we expect these days, only
more murderously. The zoo of bad guys expands, assassins thrive,
casualties mount and Holly's own security wilts as the Miami mob
enters the fray. But perps or mobs or FBI, for Holly they're much the
same: trespassers on her turf. This is a war that she has to win, and
win it she does. The mettlesome woman and her swain triumph even more
amply than we anticipate. So here are all the spills, chills, thrills
and transports that we expect from a master of the genre.</TE>
<TE>   Jonathan Kellerman's velocious "The Murder Book" opens with Dr.
Alex Delaware recovering from a discouraging break with his beloved
Robin. He misses her and he really misses the dog she took with her.
Then he gets a heavy package in the mail: a handsome three-ring
binder full of police photographs of heinous crimes, 43 of them.</TE>
<TE>   Cut to his trusty sidekick, L.A. Homicide Det. Milo Sturgis, who
recognizes the last snapshot of inert remains as a stale case that
had been left unsolved. Flashback to the dull old days when
expletives were not deleted and Milo was a rookie cop partnered with
a bitter homophobe old hand called Schwinn. Together they had picked
up the call to a young woman's corpse, scalped, burned and sexually
assaulted, dumped in a ditch near a freeway ramp; and they had failed
to clear her murder. Twenty years later, Schwinn is dead, the
tortured girl forgotten, but Milo and Alex reopen the case.</TE>
<TE>   Their involuted search uncovers cover-ups long past and their
roots in youthful and adult sleaze. Flurries of turpitude eruct: fat
cat huckster families, their no-goodnik offspring, political vultures
gobbling at the trough, sex, dope, orgies, gang bangs, indiscretions
upgraded to mayhem, then swept under the mat. The edgy quest turns up
armies of suspects, or at least platoons: a bloody snarl of rogue
cops, pols on the take, sadists, rapists and arrogant rich scum.
Powerful people work to discourage the investigation, unknown allies
seek to urge them on, Robin remains elusive. But the scum responsible
for the victim's horrid end meet horrid ends themselves in a
satisfying scoundrel-dammerung that leaves Southern California strewn
with corpses. They sure had it coming.</TE>
<TE>   As Andrew Vachss' "Only Child" opens, his antihero, Burke, has
been on the run for years. Now he returns to New York City and has to
make a living. He is recruited by two Mafia barons to riddle out the
culprit and the motive for the horrific murder of a 16-year-old Long
Island girl. His investigation carries him deep into teenage culture,
Internet effervescence, furtive filmmaking and kinky sex. It turns up
a lot of joyless lore about freaks, how they work and how they work
out their freakishness.</TE>
<TE>   With Vachss, atmosphere is all, and the atmosphere here is grungy
and ominous, the wardrobe lurches between louche sloppiness and plain
uglification, weather is sullen, light bleary, mood murky, settings
sullied and action ruthlessly blunt. Vachss' style is personal,
laconic, shaded and, of course, creepy. If you like hard-boiled punk
narrative, this is a read for you.</TE>

<DH>Lost Discoveries: The Ancient Roots of Modern Science --
From the Babylonians to the Mayans, Dick Teresi, Simon and Schuster:
454 pp., $27</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Margaret Wertheim</AU>
<BD>Margaret Wertheim is the author of "The Pearly Gates of
Cyberspace: A History of Space From Dante to the Internet."</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Is science a purely Western enterprise? That's the conventional
wisdom drummed out with monotonous regularity in the pages of so many
science journals and books. Our science is empirically based, they
say; all other systems of knowledge are myths and fabulations. In
"Lost Discoveries," Dick Teresi sets out to demonstrate that, on the
contrary, the roots of Western science lie in many other cultures.</LD>
<LD>   As Teresi's book shows, our science did not spring fully grown
from Ionian and Renaissance soil but draws upon a wide variety of
work. Egyptians developed the foundations of geometry; Pythagoras'
famous theorem was known to the Babylonians; we inherit our number
system, including the critical innovation of zero and the use of a
decimal point, from India. Moreover, many cultures made scientific
discoveries long before the West came to similar conclusions. In the
first millennium BC, Indians posited the idea of atoms. Around AD
1000, the Maya had a sophisticated mathematics and astronomy far in
advance of what existed in medieval Europe.</LD>
<TE>   Bias against other scientific traditions is rife in Western
culture. In January 2000, Science magazine, the journal of the
American Assn. for the Advancement of Science, published a timeline
it called "Pathways of Discovery" that detailed 96 of what the
editors deemed the most important scientific achievements in history.
Of the 96, just two were attributed to non-Western cultures: the
discovery of zero in India and the astronomical observations of the
Maya and Hindus. Moreover, the journal gave credit for the printing
press to Johannes Gutenberg, although the Chinese and Koreans had
invented such devices two centuries earlier. Before 600 BC, the whole
of human history was deemed "prescientific," for in the editors'
view, science began with the Greeks.</TE>
<TE>   Teresi, a noted science writer, rightly wishes to challenge this
arrogant Eurocentrism. He begins his wide-ranging discussion with an
analysis of what is commonly touted as the definitive start to modern
science -- Copernicus' discovery of the heliocentric cosmos. Far from
being the first to hit upon this idea, Copernicus was following in
the footsteps of ancient thinkers, notably Aristarchus of Samos, who
had proposed a sun-centered system in the 3rd century BC. Copernicus'
debt to Aristarchus is well known: He even acknowledged it in his
famous book "Concerning the Revolutions of the Heavenly Spheres."
More radically, Teresi notes that several hundred years before
Aristarchus, Indian scholars "had understood that gravitation held
the solar system together, and that therefore the sun, the most
massive object, had to be at its center."</TE>
<TE>   Whether Aristarchus and other Greek helio-centrics, including
Pythagoras, were influenced by the Indian tradition is a difficult
case to make, though it is not an inconceivable linkage: Pythagorean
legend long held that he had been to India. But Teresi has a more
solid claim. In constructing his heliocentric model, Copernicus drew
upon two novel mathematical theorems that had been discovered by Arab
mathematicians, the Urdi lemma (a proposition in geometry) and the
Tusi couple (which deals with the problem of how circular motion can
generate linear motion). It is possible that Copernicus developed
these mathematical insights himself, but there is evidence that he
was aware of the earlier Arabic work, though he did not acknowledge
it. Thus, says Teresi, the Copernican revolution, so seminal to the
whole thrust of modern science, rests on a foundation of Arab
scholarship.</TE>
<TE>   Western science indeed owes an enormous debt to the Arab world.
During the early Middle Ages, when European scholars turned away from
nature to focus their attention on theological issues, Arabs
cultivated the disciplines of astronomy, mathematics, optics and
mechanics as they built upon the scientific heritage of the ancient
Greeks. It was from the Arab world, one learns in "Lost Discoveries,"
that Europe in the late Middle Ages got its basic scientific
education.</TE>
<TE>   The trouble with Teresi's book, however, is that he seems
incapable of judging scientific achievement in terms other than the
degree to which it mirrors current Western concepts in mathematics,
physics and cosmology. In a long chapter on physics, for example, he
asserts that "[M]any ancient cultures had inklings of quantum
mechanics." What he actually means is that ideas which have come into
Western thinking only with the development of quantum physics are
similar in spirit to concepts developed hundreds, even thousands, of
years ago by Hindu, Jain and Buddhist thinkers.</TE>
<TE>   The idea of a pregnant void and of the fundamental role of chance
are foundational to quantum mechanics and to ancient east Asian
worldviews. The parallels have been spelled out in detail, and far
more lucidly, in Fritjof Capra's "The Tao of Physics" and Gary
Zukav's "The Dancing Wu Li Masters." But what meaning should we
attach to these parallels? For Teresi, the Asian views have validity
only to the extent that they mimic the quantum picture. Likewise
Indian and Chinese ideas about the constituency of matter are judged
by how closely they mesh with contemporary particle physicists'
understanding of quarks and leptons. All other cultures' creation
accounts are adjudicated by their resemblance to big-bang cosmology.</TE>
<TE>   Despite his title, then, the implication is that all other
traditions are not truly scientific. At one point he quotes an
American physicist who opines that "the Upanishads refer to an
imaginary symbolic cosmos. Democritus was talking about the way
things really are." Though Teresi questions this view, one is left
with the impression that he too sees non-Western knowledge systems as
largely imaginative exercises. Again and again he circles back to the
notion that Western science unveils the Truth by which everyone else
must be judged.</TE>
<TE>   That idea is fundamentally challenged by scholars of what is
sometimes termed "ethnoscience." Western science, they say, is simply
one mode of science, which must be understood as a multivalent
phenomenon, sometimes manifesting in radically different guises to
any branch of the Western variety. For a good introduction, see Laura
Nader's "Naked Science."</TE>
<TE>   Thus although Teresi's intentions are honorable, his book is shot
through with the arrogance he wishes to redress. Perhaps that is not
surprising given the book's origin. His interest in the subject, he
tells us, sprang from an assignment in the early 1990s, when he set
out to write an article about "faulty multicultural science being
taught in schools." To his surprise, he found himself discovering a
marvelous new realm of ideas. Teresi wants to share these ideas with
us, but "Lost Discoveries" reads as if he is still trying convince
himself that there is anything of intrinsic value here.</TE>

"The Rockefellers: An American Dynasty."</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Anyone familiar with the Rockefeller story will probably be surprised
to find that David Rockefeller has written his memoirs. Since the
depredations of the Standard Oil Trust in the late 19th century --
the family's version of original sin -- the unexamined life has been
not only worth living for the Rockefellers but also an absolute
necessity. John D. Rockefeller Sr. once tried to defend himself from
the attacks that made him America's economic "Evil One" by blurting
out, "God gave me my money." After that, he and his heirs gave up
trying publicly to justify their wealth and power and lapsed into a
silence that has lasted until now.</LD>
<TE>   That 87-year-old David Rockefeller, survivor of this 150-year
saga, has set about recollecting his life in tranquillity suggests
the family is not the radioactive metaphor it once was in America
and, indeed, may have become a little passe. Certainly, times have
changed since the 1960s, when the vulgar Marxism of the New Left
portrayed the Rockefellers as a sort of executive committee of the
ruling class, practicing social control at home through proprietary
institutions ranging from the Population Council to the Council on
Foreign Relations, while working insidiously abroad to get the U.S.
into Latin America, South Africa and Vietnam. All malicious
occurrences could be explained with two words: the Rockefellers. On
this, the paranoid right agreed with the paranoid left, adding the
twist that the family's tentacles stretched into the sinister
conspiracies it imagined being propounded behind closed doors by the
Bilderbergers and the Trilateral Commission.</TE>
<TE>   But all those C. Wright Millsian analyses of the power elite and
the ingeniously nutty diagrams of interlocking directorates with the
Rockefeller name at their nexuses are artifacts of the past. Other
conspiracy theories have taken hold; a far wealthier class has arisen
to supplant the intergenerational ancien regime established by robber
baron money. It is at last safe for a Rockefeller to come out of
hiding.</TE>
<TE>   In writing about his life, Rockefeller does not attempt to gild
his persona. He is saturnine, self-satisfied and obtuse -- all
survival traits in this family -- and still very much the cosseted
last child whose grand passion as an adolescent was his world-class
collection of beetles, to which he added at the rate of 30 species a
night at the family's Pocantico Hills Estate in New York's Hudson
Valley. He doesn't have much new to say about the iconic John D. Sr.,
except to insist that he was the old man's favorite grandchild. He
insists that he was also the favorite of his mother, Abby Aldrich,
who warmed the Rockefellers' chilly Baptist souls and brought Picasso
into lives previously very Rembrandt. David does not claim to be the
favorite of his father, John D. Jr. ("Mister Junior" to the large
Rockefeller staff), a stern man who was often submerged in
neurasthenia by the magnitude of the task fate had given him:
cleaning the oil stains off the family name.</TE>
<TE>   But David appreciates the pivotal dynastic role that his father
played in the family. In spending roughly a billion dollars -- about
what the first John D. originally made -- in strategic philanthropy
for what he grandly called "the well-being of mankind," the second
John D. helped create the institutional world awaiting David and his
brothers, John D. III, Nelson, Laurance and Winthrop, when they burst
on the postwar scene as the most famous brother act in American life.</TE>
<TE>   David tells us disappointingly little about his youthful
relationship with his siblings (who also included a sister, Abby,
known as Babs), although he does hint that, at any early age, Nelson
made it clear that he at least would fight his way out of the
Rockefeller cocoon and become the leader of his generation by
challenging Mister Junior and pushing aside elder brother John D. III
and all presumptions of primogeniture. It is not that the author is
hiding the intimate details of his growing up; the brothers were
probably not very intimate, and he was probably not paying attention.
In any case, the steady subject of the "Memoirs" is "The Making of
David Rockefeller," and its rhetoric is mobilized to dispel the
notion that his self-hood and success were assured by his gilt-edged
birthright.</TE>
<TE>   He stolidly takes us through his days at Manhattan's Lincoln
School (one of those "democratizing" experiences his father used to
normalize the boys) and Harvard; his travels through Europe with
chums on the eve of war; his time at the London School of Economics
and the University of Chicago; his marriage to Peggy McGrath and his
reluctant entry into the Army (his mother shamed him into joining).
The portrait he draws is of a socially awkward and self-protective
young man anxious to keep the Rockefeller name at bay but nonetheless
eager to use the family's far-flung network of institutions and
influential individuals for his upward climb. We learn how he assumed
his "citizenship duties" in the postwar world, sitting on the boards
(as all his brothers did) of such family-built organizations as the
Rockefeller Institute and the Museum of Modern Art and fretting over
the future of Rockefeller Center.</TE>
<TE>   But his consuming interest is telling about his career at Chase
Manhattan Bank. Here the book becomes David's "apologia pro vita
sua," a tale of his rise (less certain than the Rockefeller
conspiracy theories assumed) in this family-dominated institution. He
tells of starting as a "subway strapper" making $3,500 a year; his
trouble with his predecessor at the helm of the bank, the rough-hewn
"wise man" John J. McCloy, who, unfairly in David's opinion, regarded
him as a spoiled rich kid; his struggle over leadership of the bank
with George Champion, whose rise from the lower ranks was real, not
virtual, as David's was; and then, once he finally made it to the
top, his difficulties, including an inexplicable failure to keep the
bank from becoming dangerously overextended by bad loans in the late
1970s before he managed to save the situation at the last minute and
achieve a career "redemption."</TE>
<TE>   It is a Rockefeller version of a rags-to-riches story, but, in
telling it, David proves himself to be no Horatio Alger, let alone a
Jack Welch. Chase is his "MacGuffin": Alfred Hitchcock's term for
that plot device which interests the protagonist intensely and the
spectator scarcely at all. Instead of the shrewd and astringent
insights one expects from a lifetime in the cockpit of a cutthroat
business, we get vintage Rockefellerisms: "I am a pragmatist who
recognizes the need for sound fiscal and monetary policies to achieve
optimum economic growth. I recognize, however, that otherwise sound
policies that ignore real human needs are not acceptable and that
safety nets have an essential place in our society."</TE>
<TE>   Rockefeller even manages to make his foreign travels
uninteresting, a difficult task considering that he was the
figurehead of the American ship of state in the 1960s and '70s, when
he sailed into the Soviet Union, China and the Middle East to do
business for Chase and, unofficially, for the U.S. State Department.
He talks about personal meetings with such figures as Nikita
Khrushchev, Gamal Abdel Nasser and Deng Xiaoping and how he
collaborated with Nelson's protege, "Henry" (A. Kissinger). Yet there
is a whiff of the downloaded appointment book in this section of
"Memoirs," a ceremonial figure talking with other ceremonial figures
in scenes that conjure the empty intellectual spaces of a Rene
Magritte canvas.</TE>
<TE>   But if at times David seems to have sleepwalked through a life he
keeps assuring us was monumentally interesting, the narrative does
come alive toward the end of the book, when he decides to get up
close and personal with his family. The section on his brother
Nelson's last years, for instance, is fascinating. David draws a
picture of his omnivorous elder brother as a force of nature,
especially powerful in a denatured family, and admits being drawn
along by him most of his life, at least until Nelson divorced Mary
Todhunter Clark to marry his second wife, Happy. ("I have always
identified it as the beginning of my disillusionment with Nelson,"
David says prissily, "when the scales fell from my eyes and I no
longer saw him as the hero who could do no wrong but as a man who was
willing to sacrifice almost everything in the service of his enormous
ambition.")</TE>
<TE>   David describes Nelson's decline after President Ford, acting on
the advice of his chief of staff, Donald H. Rumsfeld, decided to drop
him from the Republican ticket as vice president in 1976. Low on
money after having financed a lifetime in politics but retaining his
predator's nose for fresh meat, Nelson returned to New York and
engaged in a fratricidal war for control of the family and its
assets, the last political arena open to him. Still wounded by the
way he had been elbowed aside when they were young, the chronically
repressed John D. III opposed him, and the other brothers tried to
design a containment policy that would protect them from Nelson's
hurricane force. It was a struggle that resulted in abraded feelings
and threatened lawsuits -- both previously unheard of in the
Rockefeller realm -- and ended only with Nelson's death in 1979 while
in flagrante with a young female aide.</TE>
<TE>   David also takes the reader into another part of the family's
inner sanctum when he gives an account of the revolt of the fourth
Rockefeller generation: "the cousins." (Here, I must disclose an
interest. The catalyst for this struggle was "The Rockefellers: An
American Dynasty," a 1976 book I wrote with David Horowitz that drew
on the fears and angers of the children of David and his brothers in
creating a portrait of the family.) Rockefeller  says, "The portrait
drawn by Collier and Horowitz showed an unhappy, conflicted group of
people, many of them attracted to radical social causes and
revolutionary ideals, who were eager to distance themselves from
their reactionary and unsympathetic parents." He claims that this
information was obtained from the cousins under false pretenses, but
he acknowledges that the fourth generation might have been talking
with its elders through the authors and admits "there had to be some
truth in what they said, which made the book very painful reading for
Peggy and me."</TE>
<TE>   According to David, this book played into the larger sibling
rivalry. (John III supported the cousins in their rebellion; Nelson
viewed them only slightly more benignly than he had the rioting
prisoners at Attica in 1971, when he was governor of New York.) What
appears to have been an inter-generational free-for-all ensued, a
cataclysmic occurrence for a family that had always nurtured its
emotional distances. David himself slipped into a crisis of
confidence: "I have often wondered whether I simply did not have much
talent as a father, because my efforts to establish a connection with
my children often misfired."</TE>
<TE>   Out of this chaos arose something absent from the stately minuet
of Rockefeller domestic life for three generations: honest
communication. And eventually, there was a cautious rapprochement
between the brothers and the cousins that otherwise would never have
occurred. Today, David says of his once-disaffected children, "They
have embraced their heritage as strongly as I did and used their
resources to improve the world or at least try to change it."</TE>
<TE>   Equilibrium having been restored and emotional turbulence
vanquished, David concludes his "Memoirs" as he began them, on a note
of calm certainty. He feels requited in his old age as he watches the
family move on, having finally slipped outside the claims of history
into a day-to-dayness it was never before able to enjoy. David is
pleased with his status as the last Rockefeller.</TE>

<DH>The Free Speech Movement: Reflections on Berkeley in the
1960s, Edited by Robert Cohen and Reginald E. Zelnik, University of
California Press: 620 pp., $55; $19.95 paper</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jonathan Kirsch</AU>
<BD>Jonathan Kirsch, a contributing writer to Book Review,
is the author of, most recently, "The Woman Who Laughed at God: The
Untold History of the Jewish People."</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If there is a single place where the counterculture of the 1960s
first snapped into focus, it is Sproul Plaza on the Berkeley campus
of the University of California. There, on Oct. 1, 1964, a crowd of
students gathered around a police car to prevent the arrest of an
activist who had defied a newly imposed university policy that
prohibited political advocacy on campus. And so began the so-called
Free Speech Movement, a spontaneous act of protest that was soon
eclipsed by other expressions of the same spirit of rebellion -- the
struggle for civil rights, the campaign against the war in Vietnam
and the miscellaneous grotesqueries that fall under the heading of
"sex, drugs and rock 'n' roll."</LD>
<LD>   That is exactly why "The Free Speech Movement: Reflections on
Berkeley in the 1960s" comes as a healthy corrective to the
trivialization of the counterculture in American pop culture.
Nowadays, the aging hippie is literally a joke, a stock character in
sitcoms and 30-second spots. To understand what it was like to come
of age in the '60s, to understand how America was changed in profound
and even revolutionary ways, we need to be reminded of what was
really at stake when the banner of the Free Speech Movement was first
raised in Sproul Plaza.</LD>
<TE>   "There's a time when the operation of the machine becomes so
odious, makes you so sick at heart, that you can't take part,"
declared Mario Savio, a 21-year-old philosophy major who was one of
the movement's founders and quickly emerged as its face and voice.
"[Y]ou've got to put your bodies upon the gears and upon the wheels,
upon the levers, upon all the apparatus and you've got to make it
stop. And you've got to indicate to the people who run it, to the
people who own it, that unless you're free, the machine will be
prevented from working at all." The book's editors have assembled a
kind of colloquium-in-print on the subject of the Free Speech
Movement, an anthology that allows us to hear the voices of the men
and women who figured so prominently in the events, ranging from
Savio to Clark Kerr, then serving as president of the University of
California, as well as the scholars who have studied the Free Speech
Movement and reflected on its effect on history.</TE>
<TE>   The book is an impressive work of scholarship, enlivened by
moments of bittersweet memoir that will resonate for readers of a
certain age. Kate Coleman, for example, recalls what was on her mind
on the night in December 1964 when she participated in a sit-in at
Sproul Hall: "How was I going to dress for the revolution in such a
way that I would reflect well upon the aesthetics of a movement about
which I was very passionate?" Margot Adler shares the letters she
wrote to her mother about her experiences in jail after being
arrested at a demonstration: "I tried reading Thucydides but I just
couldn't concentrate," she wrote. "I will try to sleep until we go to
... get our mug shots."</TE>
<TE>   The Free Speech Movement, as we are reminded, was not merely a
manifestation of what was beginning to be called the New Left. The
original coalition ranged across the spectrum of political activism
from the College Young Republicans and Youth for Goldwater to the
Young People's Socialist League and the W.E.B. Du Bois Club -- the
point was to open the campus to debate and even confrontation over
issues that really mattered. "Groups that would shout at each other
from card tables at Bancroft and Telegraph were suddenly potential
allies," recalls Jackie Goldberg, then a member of the movement's
steering committee and now a member of the California Assembly.
Ironically, the fact that she was "pledge mom" of Delta Phi Epsilon
served to assuage the suspicions of right-wing members of the
steering committee, who joined with left-wing members in electing
Goldberg the movement's first spokesperson.</TE>
<TE>   "To reduce the FSM's story to a chapter in the history of the New
Left is to fail to see that the historical moment cannot be
compressed into a single meaning," insists co-editor Robert Cohen.
And Berkeley history professor Leon F. Litwack makes an even broader
claim for the achievements of the movement in his preface to the
book: "In the 1960s, first on the Berkeley campus and then nationally
and internationally, students tested the limits of permissible
dissent, challenged the conventional wisdom in unprecedented ways,
and insisted on participating as active agents in the shaping of
history."</TE>
<TE>   Significantly -- and touchingly -- the book is dedicated to Savio,
who died in 1996, and various of its contributors invoke him with
both awe and intimacy. Even when they do, however, the spirit of
debate that was championed by the movement is on display. Thus, for
example, some of the movement's old soldiers fret over the
"canonization of Savio as a civil liberties saint," as Cohen points
out, while movement veteran Michael Rossman unabashedly declares
Savio to have been "an avatar embodying a transcendental signature
and force." The spiritualized vocabulary may seem ironic, but it
turns out to be highly appropriate.</TE>
<TE>   "[T]he single greatest influence upon his politics and upon his
life, apart from that of family dynamics, was his early exposure to
Catholicism," offers his widow, Lynne Hollander Savio, who points out
that Savio aspired to the priesthood in his early teens and seemed to
find what he was seeking in political activism. "Catholic morality,"
she insists, "was what drove his politics: do good; resist evil."</TE>
<TE>   One symbol of how the world has changed since the movement's first
days -- and as a result of it -- can be found at Sproul Plaza, where
so many young people once gathered in protest. Not long ago, my wife
and I took our own children there, and while we were explaining the
importance of what had happened on the steps leading up to Sproul
Hall in 1964, we overheard another middle-age parent telling his
college-age child the same stirring tale. Today, however, the Sproul
Steps have been formally renamed: They are now the Mario Savio Steps.</TE>

<LD>Decked out in the invitation-prescribed "equestrienne, Gypsy or

County dined under the stars before attending the U.S. premiere on
Oct. 12 of Theatre Zingaro's "Triptyk," a French equestrian ballet
set to Stravinsky and Boulez.</LD>
<LD>   The society spent "six years of dreaming, 18 months of scheming,
and tonight we are beaming with pride," society executive director
Dean Corey told guests as they feasted on goulash at tables topped
with lanterns and flowers. Afterward, the crowd swept into a
darkened, incense-scented tent to watch the 23 horses perform ballet
moves with dancers from Kerala, India.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>When I finished college four months ago and decided to try my luck in
Hollywood, I knew breaking in here would be tough. But I figured that
if I talked to enough people, one was bound to reveal the "secret
formula" for success. I met with friends, who led me to their
friends, who led me to their uncles, who led me to their tennis
partners, who led me to their ex-wives' tennis partners, and so on,
and every one of them had career advice.</LD>
<LD>   One of my first talks was with Aaron, a former screenwriter turned
literary agent. He had seen the business from multiple angles and
thus seemed like an ideal candidate to lead me in the right
direction.</LD>
<LD>   When Aaron first started, he said, he made ends meet by working as
a chauffeur for a "somewhat shady" escort service. Good pay, flexible
hours, plenty of downtime to write -- sounded perfect for me.</LD>
<TE>   "Where do I sign up?" I asked.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not that glamorous," he cautioned. "You see, 'escort'
services don't just 'escort,' if you catch my drift."</TE>
<TE>   "Not quite -- what else do they do?"</TE>
<TE>   His answer burst the bubble. "Prostitution. Drug dealing. The
occasional getaway driving."</TE>
<TE>   He might've been pulling my leg, but I decided to play it safe and
scratch the chauffeur plan.</TE>
<TE>   Ben, a sitcom writer I knew from college, suggested forgoing
steady employment altogether. "Lock yourself in a room until you have
enough material to land a steady writing deal," he said. While he was
launching himself with that plan, he told me, he'd paid the bills by
doing freelance work for a company called Parke-Davis.</TE>
<TE>   Here was an appealing option -- all the flexibility of the
chauffeur job without the potential for serving eight to 12 with no
parole. Still, I knew that options like "earn fabulous money working
at home" always seem to have a catch.</TE>
<TE>   "Exactly what kind of freelance work did you do?" I asked.</TE>
<TE>   As it turns out, Parke-Davis is a division of Pfizer
pharmaceuticals, and Ben had been somewhat lower on the organization
chart than the folks who hand out free samples in doctors' offices.
"It's easy," he explained. "You pop a few pills and they strap some
wires to your head. Once your vision gets blurry you press the little
button and you're done."</TE>
<TE>   Next I tried my cousin's friend Ken, an executive at a major
network. His schedule was jammed, so I had to patch his advice
together from a series of interrupted cell-phone conversations.
Internships are the way to start, he told me. "You're doing such
interesting work and learning so much. At the end, they'll work
really hard to find you a job."</TE>
<TE>   This one I could translate for myself. Having done internships for
numerous shows before, I knew entertainment people speak in code:</TE>
<TE>   "Doing such interesting work" means: valet parking the star's
Mercedes.</TE>
<TE>   "Learning so much": discovering -- the hard way -- that you should
not balance the producer's chef salad on top of the research staff's
lattes, unless you want to earn the nickname "Timmy Coffee-Pants."</TE>
<TE>   "At the end, they'll work really hard to find you a job": The
internship coordinator, forgetting your name, sees you off with a
heartfelt, "Goodbye ... you."</TE>
<TE>   It was early in the game, but I was getting frustrated. I looked
up an old high school friend in New York, not for advice, but to
vent. As we chatted in Central Park, I noticed a man listening to our
conversation. He was around 50 and wore a tattered overcoat two sizes
too big -- probably something he found in a garbage bin or a shelter.
His pile of uncombed black hair jutted in 12 directions. One hand
held a coffee mug, the other a bulging garbage bag.</TE>
<TE>   "I overheard you fellas talking about Hollywood," he interrupted.
"Used to work out there myself. Worked for all the studios, all the
networks, all the agencies. They all wanted me, but I didn't need
their politics, you know?"</TE>
<TE>   He paused for a sip of coffee and a slight bit of effect. "I used
to be in your boat. Asked all sorts of nice people for advice. They
told me their stories. But I'll tell you something -- there's only
one thing you need to know about show business."</TE>
<TE>   Had I misjudged this man? I leaned in, anticipating his
revelation.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't imitate success. Nobody's path works for somebody else.
Stumble into success your own way."</TE>
<TE>   As he got up to leave, he handed me a business card with the name
"MICHAEL SPARROW" in thick block letters and a small phone number
printed below. With that, he walked away.</TE>
<TE>   A few months -- and several well-intentioned advisors -- later, I
came across Michael Sparrow's card in an old notebook. I thought
about the wisdom of what he said that day in the park, and on
impulse, I called the number.</TE>
<TE>   His raspy voice rambled on the answering machine. I decided not to
leave a message. On reflection, I figured I'd learned about as much
as I needed from him.</TE>
<TE>   I hung up and filed the card away back in the notebook.</TE>
<TE>   But the longer I stumble toward what I hope is success, the more I
think of Michael Sparrow.</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes you get your best advice from the strangest sources. You
just have to be ready to listen.</TE>

from Dartmouth College. He hopes to eventually make a career of

won't cause long-term medical side effects.</TE>

<HD>For Campbell Scott, no more Mr. Nice Guy</HD>
<DH>The actor might just be discovered all over again after
'Rodger Dodger.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>John Clark</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the new film "Roger Dodger," Campbell Scott plays the title
character, a fortyish ad copywriter who relentlessly strips away the
romantic delusions of the people -- mostly women -- around him with
long, lacerating, hilarious monologues.</LD>
<LD>   As Scott recalls, after seeing the film, "10 women came up to me
and said, 'I dated that.' Of course, my next comment was, 'Have you
moved on? Are you OK?' "</LD>
<LD>   In writer-director Dylan Kidd's dark comedy of manners, Roger
(Dodger was a nickname given him by his sister when he was a boy)
gets an unexpected visit from his teenage nephew (Jesse Eisenberg).
He takes the kid under his wing and gives him his bent view of gender
relations while squiring him to a bar, where they meet two women
(Jennifer Beals and Elizabeth Berkley), and crashing a party thrown
by his boss (Isabella Rossellini).</LD>
<TE>   Roger's abrasive shtick is a defense mechanism and a method of
seduction. And it works both on women (to a point) and on audiences.
The film won the best narrative feature award at the Tribeca Film
Festival and best first feature and best film outside the main
competition awards at the Venice Film Festival.</TE>
<TE>   "When he wants to be, the guy is drop-dead charismatic," Kidd says
of Scott, and "Roger" requires it. "He is burning up the screen. It's
a true leading man role." It may be a true leading man role, but it
might not bring Scott more leading man parts. Now 40, Scott, the son
of actors George C. Scott and Colleen Dewhurst, reports he's been
"discovered" half a dozen times. To hear him tell it, he's beyond all
that now.</TE>
<TE>   "I had my little Hollywood foray 12 years ago, one right after the
other, 'Singles' and 'Dying Young,' " Scott says. "Neither side
really liked it. I didn't like it, and they didn't like me. But I
think that's appropriate. And those were good scripts. They were good
movies. And then other things happened. I was naive and stupid. I was
a theater actor. I was like, 'Why aren't we working on the scenes?' "</TE>
<TE>   And so, over the past 15 years, Scott has appeared in countless
plays and made two dozen movies, many of them small and highly
regarded, some of which he's even directed. Among those roles are
parts in "The Sheltering Sky," "Mrs. Parker and the Vicious Circle,"
"The Day Trippers," "Big Night," "The Spanish Prisoner" and "Spring
Forward." In a number of these films he's been a jerk ("Day
Trippers," "Spring Forward"), but the image he has, such as it is, is
that of someone who plays bland, monochromatic characters -- in
short, nice guys.</TE>
<TE>   And that's exactly what Kidd was seeking, an actor who didn't have
"heavy" written all over him, because the part already had "heavy"
written all over it. (Roger to Berkley, whose character dates married
men: "It's the emotional unavailability that you look for.") Kidd
says he didn't have Scott in mind when he wrote the part. In fact,
he'd been nursing the project for years and was never able to break
through the firewall of agents who surrounded potential actors for
the role. Instead, he found his lead in a Greenwich Village coffee
shop.</TE>
<TE>   "I sat there and watched him for 10 minutes and thought, 'This is
perfect,' " says Kidd, who simply walked up to Scott and offered him
the script. At the time, Kidd, a New York University graduate, was
teaching and working at a video store.</TE>
<TE>   "He seemed very unthreatening," Scott says. "So I said, 'All
right, send it to my to agent.' 'No, I have a script right here in my
hand.' 'All right, give it to me.' It took me a while, but I read it
greedily. I was like, no one's going to give me this kind of part, so
I'll do it."</TE>
<TE>   "I never thought I'd hear from him again," Kidd says. "It seemed
too good to be true. Is this guy joking? Could he really be this
great?"</TE>
<TE>   Three months later, they were shooting. In the interim, Scott,
assuming the role of executive producer, helped secure funding (the
film cost $1.2 million) from Holedigger Films, which financed two
other movies Scott has been involved with over the past year and a
half, "The Secret Lives of Dentists" (as an actor) and "Off the Map"
(as a director). He recruited old friends Rossellini and Beals for
key roles -- "When Campbell Scott calls, I jump, because he is God,"
Beals says -- and introduced Kidd to film editor Andy Keir, who cut
the movie.</TE>
<TE>   "He's not a showy person," Beals says. "He's not flaunting his
talent.... With all that calm, he's very complicated, and nobody's
tapped into that darker side until this."</TE>

<DH>Romania is standing in for Civil War-era North Carolina
during 'Cold Mountain' filming. Unspoiled scenery is a plus; the wet
chill, a minus.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>David Gritten</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL>Poiana Brasov, Romania</DL>
<LD>Nicole Kidman flopped down on a wooden bench on the porch of a
replica Civil War-era Carolinas farmhouse. Surveying the gardens and
pastures around her, she let out a long sigh. "This is tough," she
said, sounding tired. "It's not exactly 'Little House on the
Prairie.' "</LD>
<LD>   Yet "Little House on the Prairie" is what it looks like, albeit in
the remote Transylvanian Alps. The views are idyllic and unspoiled;
from her farmhouse porch on high, Kidman peered down a long, broad
valley covered in dense forest starting to turn russet and gold on
this sunny October day. In her 180-degree view, there was not a sign
of modern life: no overhead power cables, no billboards, not even the
distant hum of traffic.</LD>
<LD>   That's a major reason why she and the cast and crew of "Cold
Mountain" have been in Romania since July. Charles Frazier's 1997
debut novel, which won a National Book Award and became a bestselling
publishing phenomenon, is set in rural 1860s North Carolina, and
director-screenwriter Anthony Minghella's adaptation for Miramax
Films requires shooting in remote places untouched by progress.</LD>
<TE>   "We started out going to the locations it was written in,"
recalled producer Bill Horberg. "But the last 30 pages of the script
call for snow, and you can't rely on snow in the Carolinas. We'd
always have had the need to move for snow. You can't build sets in
two places, so production logic dictated we move someplace where we
get all the seasons."</TE>
<TE>   After locations in Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Poland and
Ireland were considered and discarded, Romania became the choice. The
film's executive producer, Scotsman Iain Smith, had vacationed in the
Transylvanian Alps, and he recommended the area to Minghella, who
visited it last winter with production designer Dante Ferretti.</TE>
<TE>   "There's something so stark and primitive about this place that it
struck us as suitable for a story set in 1864," Horberg said. Indeed.
On the 2 1/2-hour journey from Romania's capital, Bucharest, one sees
as many horses and carts on the roads as automobiles, while field
laborers still wield scythes.</TE>
<TE>   Something else about Romania proved to be suitable. It is a cheap
place to shoot movies, ranging from the labor, the extras -- and
1,000 soldiers provided for battlefield scenes by the Romanian army.
Horberg characterized the budget of "Cold Mountain" as "mid-70s,"
saving what he estimated to be $20 million to $25 million had it been
shot in the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   "Cold Mountain" marks Minghella's third consecutive literary
adaptation, after Michael Ondaatje's "The English Patient" and
Patricia Highsmith's "The Talented Mr. Ripley."</TE>
<TE>   "I agreed to write and direct the film of this book when I was
only two-thirds through reading it," he said. As an adaptor,
Minghella makes radical changes to his source texts, rather than
being enslaved by them. His approach this time is no exception. (Once
Frazier sold the novel, he had no involvement in writing the
screenplay.)</TE>
<TE>   Novel versus screenplay</TE>
<TE>   The hero of Frazier's novel is Inman (played in the film by Jude
Law), a Confederate soldier injured in battle. He begins the story in
a convalescent hospital, but he abruptly decides to undertake the
long, dangerous walk back to his hometown, Cold Mountain, to reunite
with Ada (Kidman), with whom he had begun an unconsummated affair.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Ada, who had a sheltered upbringing in Charleston
,S.C., society, is struggling to maintain the farm where she'd moved
with her ailing father. After his death, she lacks the skills needed
to survive. Only when Ruby (Renee Zellweger), a rugged young rural
woman, moves in to share the farm does Ada begin her own journey
toward self-sufficiency.</TE>
<TE>   Frazier recounts all this in a rich, allusive style, describing
the changing seasons and the often hostile weather encountered by
Inman and Ada so closely that the climate almost functions as a
dramatic character.</TE>
<TE>   In contrast, Minghella's screenplay begins by showing Inman's part
in the brutal, bloody battle of Petersburg, Va. "I decided this
wasn't going to be a Civil War film," he said on a break between
scenes. "I wanted to establish quickly the nature of a war and make
the audience see why Inman would want to leave it and attend to his
obligations at home.</TE>
<TE>   "It made more sense to focus on Ada's home and Inman's journey
home. In this story, Inman travels hundreds of miles -- a profound,
life-changing journey. Ada begins in thrall to a culture that doesn't
serve her at all; she's hoop-skirted, corseted and aristocratic. But
she ends up running a farm with another woman and no men around."
Minghella has also departed from Frazier's text by creating a more
sharply focused danger to Ada and Ruby's farm.</TE>
<TE>   "There's something perverse with me when it comes to material," he
said. "I react extremely to cold; I don't like mountains; I knew
nothing about the Civil War; and I have little interest in war
generally. But the work I have to do to enable me to make a film like
this -- the things I have to learn -- interests me as much as the
story itself."</TE>
<TE>   As Kidman noted, if you embark on a film called "Cold Mountain,"
it's likely to be tough. The core crew is spending five months, from
mid-July to mid-December, in this remote region.</TE>
<TE>   The battlefield scenes, shot first in a village called Potigrafu,
much closer to Bucharest, were particularly arduous. Temperatures
rose to 105 degrees, and then came thunderstorms and wet weather so
extreme that it caused flooding across Eastern Europe. Rain fell on
21 consecutive days early in the shoot.</TE>
<TE>   "For the battle scenes, we had to dredge mud out of trenches
before we could get in them," Minghella said. "As a result, the
footage has such an edge. You see soldiers sliding and slithering
around helplessly. But we got covered in it. At one point, our
Bucharest hotel wouldn't let us back in until we changed out of our
muddy clothes. Some days, I felt defeated by it all."</TE>
<TE>   "The battlefield scenes were hot, brutal and emotionally intense,"
Law said. "One could choreograph certain set pieces, but once you put
them among a mosh pit of 1,000 men sliding around in mud, it was hard
to keep that choreography. And it was tough for a cameraman to be in
the middle of all that chaos without becoming part of it."</TE>
<TE>   Other individuals paid their dues in terms of physical hardships.
Kidman reluctantly showed a visitor her hands: scratched with dirty
nails. Her forearms were covered in painful-looking welts and
abrasions. "Oh, those," she said, casually. "Well, yesterday, Renee
and I had this fence-building scene, and I had to hammer this wooden
post into the ground and get frustrated about it. So I attacked the
post. I knew my hands were swollen, but I didn't realize I'd done
this. I don't even notice when I'm harming my body." She laughed
mirthlessly. "But with this story, adversity helps. There's something
about smooth sailing that wouldn't sit right."</TE>
<TE>   "Yep, that's us -- fence-building, butt-kickin' gals," Zellweger
said dryly, later in the day. Her nails were as dirty as Kidman's,
but she shrugs off the trials of filming "Cold Mountain"; she liked
the book so much that she tried to option the film rights.</TE>
<TE>   "Some friends from Charleston and I had an advance look at the
book," she said. "You hold something like that in your hands, and you
recognize an epic immediately. It was glorious -- the colors, the
characters, the details were so vivid. We had a smaller film in mind
and tried to get the rights for $10,000." (The film rights were
finally sold for $1.25 million.) Zellweger laughed loudly and said:
"What a tragedy it would have been if we had succeeded!"</TE>
<TE>   The script's Ruby is of mixed race. "Her heritage is never fully
described," Zellweger said. "But it seems there were people back then
living in the hills who were a mix of white, Afro-American and maybe
American Indian, with light eyes and light hair. Looking back on [the
novel] more carefully, we're just filling in the blanks."</TE>
<TE>   Casting gets complicated</TE>
<TE>   During the casting process, Minghella talked with Zellweger, who
had hoped to play Ada. "But when I met Renee, I thought she was born
to play Ruby," he said. "She told me she'd be happy to play whoever I
wanted. And then it took me a year to get back to her."</TE>
<TE>   It took so long because the casting of the main characters was
complex and prolonged. For a long time, Tom Cruise was set to play
Inman, but he withdrew. "There were many, many changes of plan and
permutations," Minghella recalled. No one on set spelled it out, but
after Cruise left, Kidman, who divorced the actor last year, became
available to play Ada.</TE>
<TE>   "The role wasn't something I saw in my future," Kidman said. "It
fell before me by chance. But this story makes you ache. It evokes a
sense of longing, which is hard to do. And I think I needed it. It's
lovely to be making a film about love at this time of my life.
There's a bleakness to the last three films I've done" -- the
yet-to-be released "Dogville," directed by Lars von Trier; the film
of Philip Roth's novel "The Human Stain"; and "The Hours," in which
she plays Virginia Woolf.</TE>
<TE>   "I love the female friendship in this movie. And Ada, who at first
is like a doll, not built to take care of herself, makes this huge
progression."</TE>
<TE>   Still, the really intriguing casting is Englishman Law as the
North Carolina hero Inman -- not just because of his accent, but
because he has never before played the lead in a large-scale movie.
"I was conscious of that," said Minghella, who cast him in "The
Talented Mr. Ripley."</TE>
<TE>   "Jude has so much of the equipment of a leading man, yet he seemed
more secure creating a character. But when I talked to him about
Inman, he said he was ready." Law remembers something different from
that same conversation: "Anthony made me feel that Inman was my part
-- something I could do, and as he put it, something I deserved to
do."</TE>
<TE>   Minghella insisted there was another reason he cast Law, Kidman
and Zellweger: He knew all three actors would enter wholeheartedly
into the spirit of the production, and do their work without
complaints or tantrums for the duration of the marathon shoot.</TE>
<TE>   "I have my crew, and they will go anywhere, do anything for me,"
he said. "We couldn't have a difficult, high-maintenance actor here,
someone who needed more than Romania could offer.</TE>
<TE>   "If you're setting out on a tough journey and making a film like
'Cold Mountain,' you need to pick your companions very carefully."</TE>

<LD>Miramax Films, noted for films based on contemporary literary works,
has had mixed success -- both critically and commercially -- with
them.</LD>
<LD>   The English Patient (1996), based on the 1992 novel by Michael
Ondaatje. It delivered nine Oscars, including best picture and best
supporting actress Juliette Binoche, as well as $232 million at the
box office.</LD>
<LD>   The Cider House Rules (1999), based on John Irving's 1985 novel.
Despite strong reviews, the movie proved to be a mid-level success at
the box office. Oscars for Irving's screenplay and supporting actor
Michael Caine.</LD>
<TE>   Chocolat (2000), from Joanne Harris' 1998 novel. Binoche, Judi
Dench and Johnny Depp starred; "Cider House's" Lasse Hallstrom
directed. Mixed reviews, five Oscar nominations (no wins) and $78
million worldwide.</TE>
<TE>   The Shipping News (2001), adaptation of Annie Proulx's 1993 novel.
Classy cast -- Kevin Spacey, Judi Dench, Julianne Moore -- but dismal
reviews and a mere $16 million at the box office.</TE>

<HD>Eggers' trail of broken hearts</HD>
<DH>The Bay Area goes gaga for the local boy who wrote 'A
Heartbreaking Work of Staggering Genius.' And his aversion to
publicity only feeds the frenzy.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Shawn Hubler</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>San Francisco</DL>
<LD>This is Dave Eggers country. Two hundred people -- that's a mob for a
literary reading -- packed the Berkeley bookstore where he debuted
his new book this month.</LD>
<LD>   "Any of my old neighbors here?" he asked. Hands shot up. He
smiled, dark eyes crinkling, dark hair so tightly curled it stood up.
"He was darker when I knew him -- I mean inside," a gray-bearded man
in the back murmured. At City Lights in North Beach, fans filled
three rooms and a balcony. In Santa Cruz, they played hooky in
mid-workday to see him.</LD>
<LD>   "He's here!" a young woman crowed to her friends. "I shook his
hand on the way in! It was all sweaty! You can still see his sweat on
my hand, even! Look! Wanna feel?"</LD>
<TE>   That's how people here tend to respond to Eggers, the gifted,
32-year-old author whose 2000 career-making memoir, "A Heartbreaking
Work of Staggering Genius," was set in the Bay Area. This, as his
readers will tell you, was where he moved in his 20s after his
parents died in suburban Chicago, leaving him and his siblings to
raise Toph, their little brother. This is where he lives now that
Toph is a college sophomore. This is where he moved his literary
journal and publishing imprint, McSweeney's, last year.</TE>
<TE>   His second book, "You Shall Know Our Velocity," has not received
the universal acclaim of the first one. The New York Times'
influential critic Michiko Kakutani called "Velocity," his first
novel, a "messy, unconvincing assemblage" that was "neither
staggering nor heartbreaking, only wearying." Entertainment Weekly,
which liked it, gave it a B.</TE>
<TE>   But here, everything Eggers does, including the novel, only serves
to stoke his star power. His decision to sell the book only through
independent booksellers has been seen as pure Northern California,
rewarding the small, socially conscious underdogs over the big,
corporate chain stores. His novel's plot -- in which sudden riches
and a sudden death prompt a young man to travel the world with a
friend, giving away money -- has parallels with his own life, but he
has also implied that it was inspired by San Francisco's own
disparities in income.</TE>
<TE>   A nonprofit writing lab, 826 Valencia, that he quietly founded
this summer for Bay Area schoolchildren ended up being hailed on the
front page of the San Francisco Chronicle as "A Heartwarming Work of
Literary Altruism." When he ran an ad for volunteers to staff its
writing workshops and in-school writing assistance programs, he got
200 applications in four days and contributions from Amy Tan, Michael
Chabon and a host of other local writers. For part of the summer,
there was a waiting list to tutor there.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a whole scene," said a laughing Heather Stiteler, a
29-year-old San Franciscan who, with members of her book club, has
attended benefits for Eggers' center, which runs on donations and
proceeds from a whimsical "pirate supply" shop in its lobby. "There
was one [fundraising] party there a while ago where, instead of
getting a stamp on your hand, you got anointed with these scented
oils that were, like, his personal fragrance. He's all over the place
here. Actually, it's to the point that a lot of my friends are like,
'Oh, God, Dave Eggers! Could I please never see that name again?' "</TE>
<TE>   Eggers can scarcely be accused of courting the attention. He rents
in Marin County, as opposed to the city's close, nosy quarters and,
though he invites audiences at readings to ask questions, the onetime
journalism student routinely declines press interviews.</TE>
<TE>   "It just complicates things," he said, politely refusing to speak
to The Times for this article. He later elaborated to an audience in
San Francisco: "It just becomes the job, and you don't get anything
else done, I mean, with the whole media thing." In fact, he told fans
in Santa Cruz, he has come to find nonfiction in general to be
problematic. "It's never right, and it can never be right for
everybody all the time," he said, adding that if he had his first
book to do over, "I might have fictionalized it. Or made it
semiautobiographical fiction. Or set it in the Old West."</TE>
<TE>   On his McSweeney's Web site, he wrote that he has "been at the
point for two years now, where I get a queasy feeling every time I
see my name in print."</TE>
<TE>   A publishing experiment</TE>
<TE>   And yet, Eggers' press aversion has been its own publicity magnet,
as has his tendency to experiment with the conventions of publishing.
The book tour for "A.H.W.O.S.G.," as fans refer to the first book,
featured absurdist twists such as post-reading field trips and panel
discussions on itching.</TE>
<TE>   This time, Eggers' experiment is with publishing itself. Three
years ago, he launched McSweeney's, a densely formatted quarterly and
Web site for offbeat fiction, essays and humor. Last year, it
expanded to books. So far, nine have been published, from a
short-story collection, "Samuel Johnson Is Indignant," by Lydia
Davis, to "The New Sins," an exploration of modern transgression by
David Byrne, the Talking Heads frontman. Printings have tended to be
done in small batches by a small printer in Iceland. The vast
majority of profits go to the authors after publishing costs.</TE>
<TE>   Literary agents have said that, with the success of his first
book, Eggers could easily have commanded an advance on royalties from
another publisher in the millions of dollars. His advance from
Vintage Books for the paperback rights to his memoir was more than
$1.4 million (of which, he has said, far more than half went to
taxes, agents and other costs of doing business and much of the rest
went to such charitable causes as cancer research). Rights to "A
Heartbreaking Work" -- which Eggers says is being adapted by Nick
Hornby and D.V. DeVincentis, who worked on Hornby's "High Fidelity"
screenplay -- were reported to have sold for $2 million.</TE>
<TE>   Sussing out his motives</TE>
<TE>   This time, Eggers has opted to publish under his own imprint with
an initial run of only 50,000 copies. "Everyone else had taken that
risk," he explained to the City Lights audience, referring to other
McSweeney's authors.</TE>
<TE>   But besides that -- and channeling all the available copies to his
own Web site and the independent stores that have long supported
McSweeney's -- he has earmarked the proceeds from online sales for
his 826 Valencia nonprofit. In other words, the payoff for Eggers
with this book isn't likely to be financial.</TE>
<TE>   "What he's done is completely unusual," said Amy Thomas, owner of
the independent Pegasus &amp; Pendragon bookstores in Berkeley and
Oakland, which sold 75 copies of Eggers' novel on the night of his
kickoff reading. "It may not be the only time something like this has
happened, but it's certainly the most spectacular time. I just love
it that someone who is very successful is willing to take some
financial hits this way."</TE>
<TE>   "It's sort of him putting his money where his mouth is," agreed
Gary Baum, a 19-year-old USC journalism student from Calabasas who
until last year, when he started college, tracked the arc of Eggers'
celebrity in an online column.</TE>
<TE>   Those who are more inclined to look at the commercial angle have
noted that with a small press run, Eggers actually loses very little
money if the book doesn't sell. At least one exchange on Readerville,
the literary forum, noted that if "Velocity's" sales are poor, Eggers
can say he depressed them on purpose. Also, the novel's scarcity --
only 10,000 copies were printed for online sales, with an additional
40,000 or so for the bookstores -- makes it a collectible. The $22
copies sold over the Web site were all signed by Eggers. As of this
week, they were selling for as much as double the retail sales price
on EBay.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, close readers wonder whether Eggers' motives are
psychological, like those of his narrator, who decides that giving
away a financial windfall he's received will cleanse him of confusion
and help him get over a friend's death.</TE>
<TE>   As if the loss of both parents was not devastating enough, Eggers
also lost his older sister, Beth, last year. It was because of Beth,
he wrote in his memoir, that the family moved to California, where
she was attending UC Berkeley's law school. After the first book's
success, she accused him on Baum's Web site of understating her role
in helping to raise their brother, then later apologized and
recanted. Coroners' records indicate she died in a Davis hospital
after an overdose of acetaminophen and benzodiazepine, a Valium
derivative associated with antidepressants. Investigators at the Yolo
County coroner's office classified it as a suicide. "Velocity" is
dedicated to Beth.</TE>
<TE>   "There are times when my brothers and I just look around and can't
believe there's only three of us left. You really can't do the math
or you'd lose your mind," Eggers wrote in an e-mail to McSweeney's
readers.</TE>
<TE>   In any case, Dave Eggers has only so much to say about himself and
his motives, and those who know him insist he really just wants to be
a regular guy. "He's so averse to promoting himself that it is the
canniest act of self-promotion," said Lawrence Weschler, director of
the New York Institute for the Humanities at NYU and a columnist for
McSweeney's. ""He really doesn't care -- really. But that's hard for
anyone in the frenzy business to believe."</TE>

<LD>Congratulations on the new look and content of the Calendar section.
Sunday's Calendar section was incredible, and I am delighted that you
followed up with the same insight in Monday's paper as well.</LD>
<LD>   This is the capital of the entertainment industry, and I always
thought The Times was a little light on coverage of Hollywood and the
business of entertainment. That is no longer the case.</LD>

<TE>   With the old Sunday Calendar, the format made it easy to read at a
cafe, take along for an afternoon movie, or browse to find a quick
review of a play. It was well designed, logical and a great size. It
was the first section I read and the last section to be thrown out.
The city mourns its loss.</TE>

<TE>   Believe me when I say I am neither a nut, a reactionary, nor
someone with too much time on his hands. I am a former professional
editor (print, not film) at Columbia University who now works in the
film industry. I have subscribed to your paper since moving to L.A.
five years ago. I understand that papers change, and I normally don't
really care if it's a little bit for either the better or the worse
-- but your new Calendar section has gone too far in the wrong
direction.</TE>
<TE>   While the other sections seem to have resisted major graphic
changes, the Calendar section has gone whole hog in its redesign. And
the result is a nearly incomprehensible puzzle of type sizes, fonts,
bars, boxes and other things beloved of graphic designers but the
bedevilment of readers who are actually looking for information.</TE>
<TE>   I find it hard to believe that Calendar's new look will actively
entice new subscribers in numbers outstripping those of us it
alienates. Please listen to me, a reader; and when your writers
complain that they can hardly find or read their own words, give
their opinions due weight over the easy enthusiasm of your graphic
designers.</TE>

<TE>   Bravo, bravo, bravo! I'm absolutely in love with the redesigned
Sunday Calendar section. It was broke and you did fix it.</TE>
<TE>   A much better look, smaller print, more interesting, sophisticated
stories and enough information about what's happening elsewhere, that
maybe from here on I won't have to buy the New York Times as well.</TE>
<TE>   William Criswell</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I've subscribed to The Times on and off for 20 years. As a film
and music lover, one of the highly anticipated points in my week has
always been to sit down with my Sunday Calendar and survey the week's
events so that I can select the screenings and concerts to attend.
Los Angeles is a huge city with innumerable entertainment options on
any given day, so the clarity, consistency and comprehensiveness of
Sunday Calendar's listings have made it invaluable.</TE>
<TE>   This is why I was very disappointed that The Times decided to
discontinue this format, and to instead pre-select a few events to
highlight, while instructing the reader to refer to Thursday's
newspaper for more information. I believe this is a miscalculation;
Sunday is simply the best day from whence to plan one's week, and to
have such a truncated menu of listings will prove frustrating. Please
return to a format that was not only not broken in the first place,
but that made Sunday Calendar one of the most reliable resources in
all of Los Angeles.</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   My husband and I don't get why the changes were made. They aren't
for the better. As my husband puts it, now Calendar is just another
section of the paper. We used to leave it around for part of the week
to read like a magazine.</TE>
<TE>   Maureen Discipulo</TE>
<TE>   Redondo Beach</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The most exciting aspect of your redesign is the reader's ability
to start and finish an article on the same page. Whoopee! No more
maddening "continued on Page 86" (then 87 and maybe even 88). Even
the writing seemed more interesting.</TE>
<TE>   Ronald J. Levin</TE>
<TE>   Pacific Palisades</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I am not in the entertainment industry (I believe that puts me in
the majority of your readers), and I am really irritated at having to
wade through all that Calendar and entertainment stuff to get to the
Living features. I'm a very busy working mom. You can consider this
to be a negative comment on the new format, i.e., hate it! Please
bring back Southern California Living.</TE>
<TE>   Susan Vignale</TE>
<TE>   La Canada</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   WOW! I've died and gone to New York! The new Calendar is a
triumph. The new design suggests that there's more to do here than in
the Big Apple. We seem to have our very own Broadway. Who knew? After
decades of having to separate Calendar from the Classifieds, we can
now simply open the section.</TE>
<TE>   William J. Becker Jr.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Boo! I hate the new Calendar! I miss the comprehensive listings of
bands/performers. Secondly, while I like the new fonts employed, in
order to scrutinize ads for upcoming events, I have to fold the paper
in such a way as to be able to hold it close to my face, so I can
read the very small print. With the old way, it was easy to just take
the section by its sides and hold it closer. So, by the time I was
done reading the new Calendar, I had a big mess to contend with,
which is a shame, for I often like to keep the Calendar for reference
to events. Psychologically, having Calendar as a tabloid section
resonated a "Yippee, I'm now at the fun stuff and have left the dire,
hard news sections behind" feeling. Please rethink this!</TE>
<TE>   Angel LaCanfora</TE>
<TE>   Torrance</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I am upset that your newly redesigned section has so drastically
reduced its art coverage. Your Oct. 6 Calendar had 173 art
exhibitions listed and yesterday's had only 45.</TE>
<TE>   The Times has been the best source for gallery and museum listings
and art reviews. You employ a top-notch group of critics that have
helped L.A. become the major art center it is.</TE>
<TE>   Please do not abandon that crucial supporting role.</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Sunday summary is useless -- what if people haven't kept the
previous Thursday's paper or, God forbid, didn't buy it?</TE>
<TE>   Richard Leary</TE>

LA Weekly.</TE>

<TE>   Editors Note: The Guide, the new Sunday Calendar list, offers a
selective look at the performances, events, exhibitions and special
screenings that our critics and writers believe will be of most
interest to readers. (The complete list of current movies in release
still appears in the Sunday section.) Comprehensive arts and
entertainment lists now appear in Thursday's Calendar Weekend.
Sunday's expanded Contents, opposite, helps readers navigate the new
section's style component, features and columns.</TE>

drunks bellowing, "Play some Skynyrd!"</LD>
<LD>   The last command, of course, translates to one of two songs: "Free
Bird" or "Sweet Home Alabama." And with two new movies featuring
three new versions of the 28-year-old tune -- by Cornbread and Jewel
in the Reese Witherspoon hit "Sweet Home Alabama" and a rap by Eminem
in "8 Mile" -- the inebriated bellowing promises to grow louder for a
song that would have been voted one of 1974's hits least likely to
live forever.</LD>
<LD>   Some votes might well have been cast by the band's own members.</LD>
<TE>   "We knew it was a cool tune, but we didn't know it would have this
kind of longevity," says Gary Rossington, the Lynyrd Skynyrd
guitarist who's been cranking out the signature riff for nearly three
decades.</TE>
<TE>   During that time, it's been recorded by Hank Williams Jr., the
Charlie Daniels Band and -- yup -- Alabama. There have been
steel-guitar, bluegrass, Elvis-impersonator and even Moog synthesizer
versions. And the original has cropped up in movies ranging from
"Forrest Gump" to "Joe Dirt." "I heard a bar band in Japan, and the
singer couldn't say, 'Alabama,' " Rossington says, "but everywhere we
go, in every little honky-tonk or bar with a band, they sing it."</TE>
<TE>   What's kept "Alabama" on the map? "I can't figure it out,"
Rossington says. "It was pretty simple, and it just caught on."</TE>

<HD>Chanel catches the wave</HD>
<DH>The surfwear industry is being buoyed by the newfound
respect high-end designers are showing their once-casual items.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Booth Moore</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The surfing community and the fashion community are miles apart
across the ocean of popular culture. So, when the two tribes -- one
reliant on dogged individuality, the other on slavish conformism --
collided on a catwalk in Paris recently, it made for a good show.</LD>
<LD>   Sure, there had been signs throughout the spring 2003 collections.
Neoprene mini-dresses by Nicolas Ghesquiere for Balenciaga; hibiscus
print board shorts at Miu Miu; black-and-yellow color-blocked "wet
suits" at Luella Bartley. But nothing as brazen as a model tottering
in three-inch heels down a runway carrying a beige surfboard with
Chanel's interlocking C logo under her arm.</LD>
<LD>   "She could have used some lessons on how to hold it," sniffed Sam
George, the editor of Surfer magazine in San Juan Capistrano, who has
been surfing for 37 years. Still, he said, it's understandable that
designers want to tap into the lifestyle. "The surfboard is the
perfect prop because there is no symbol or American icon that better
represents freedom and romance and adventure."</LD>
<TE>   But could any self-respecting surfer picture riding it? Not
likely.</TE>
<TE>   "The sport has a Pandora's box of image issues," said Matt Walker,
a senior editor at Surfing magazine in San Clemente. "The more
popular something is, and the more the mainstream market picks up on
it, the more you lose your core image."</TE>
<TE>   "In the hard-core surfing community, people look at these elegant
brands and say that they are just using surfing and scamming," said
Bill Sharpe, editor of Surf News, a tabloid based in Newport Beach.
"Last year it was hip-hop, this year we all want to dress up like
surfers. But it's dishonest. To say you are something that you
aren't, that's tacky." (Surf culture may offer high-end designers the
same sought-after quality they found so appealing in the hip-hop
culture: authenticity.)</TE>
<TE>   Chanel has produced snowboards, motorcycle helmets and other
sports equipment, but spokeswoman Anne Fahey said the surfboard was
just a runway prop. Still, she insisted that it was real. (And why
wouldn't it be? Burberry and Gucci have sold surfboards in extremely
limited quantities for the past year. "They probably sold a couple,
but chances are they are hanging on someone's mantel," said Walker.)</TE>
<TE>   But even if the waves will not soon be studded with surfers riding
little "C's," the Chanel board stands for something.</TE>
<TE>   "That board is a real statement about the time we are in," said
Randy Hild, senior vice president of marketing for Quiksilver Inc. in
Huntington Beach. "Not in the literal sense that a surfer would ride
it, because that's not going to happen ... but in the sense that our
world is influencing the runways."</TE>
<TE>   In some ways, the Chanel surfboard is the symbol of a
long-standing fashion practice -- the regular recycling of favorite
themes. "It's like El Nino," said L.A.-based swimwear designer Robin
Piccone, who can claim to be the first to craft neoprene into sexy
swimsuits for Body Glove in the 1980s. But some industry watchers say
the surf trend is different than in the past, and potentially more
important.</TE>
<TE>   "The last few cycles, it was just a trend," said Dick Baker,
president of the Surf Industry Manufacturing Assn. in San Clemente.
"This time, it's referencing a lifestyle that's here to stay."</TE>
<TE>   Surfing, of course, has permeated pop culture from the "Gidget"
era forward. It got another high-profile boost this summer, when
Universal Pictures released "Blue Crush," a movie about female
surfers, who were outfitted in clothes from Irvine-based Billabong
Inc.</TE>
<TE>   "Now that surfing is on the big screen, it's a pervasive influence
no matter what continent you are on," said Marie Case, partner and
managing director for Board-Trac, an Orange County-based research
firm that specializes in the action sports industry. "And it isn't
just youth who are ... surfing either."</TE>
<TE>   If designers are targeting the surf community, the move makes
sense because the demographic is ever-expanding, said Marshal Cohen,
co-president of NPD FashionWorld, a division of market research firm
NPD Group. "One of the funny things about surf culture is that it
evolves at a very young age, but those people don't disappear. It's a
culture that grows in size and age."</TE>
<TE>   A newfound respect</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, it's been years since the "surfwear" category transcended
the sport. The $2.4-billion industry, mostly headquartered in Orange
County, produces casual apparel, plus stylish sundresses and jeans.
Roxy, which makes girls and women's surfwear, even sells luggage and
bed linens.</TE>
<TE>   Quiksilver recently predicted that revenue from girls' products
could exceed that from men's and boys' within the next few years.
"More women are participating than ever before ... and high-fashion
folks are selling to this market," Case said.</TE>
<TE>   But some see another impulse at work. Rather than explaining high
fashion's surfing safari as a ploy for new customers, Quiksilver's
Hild sees it as a symbol of a newfound respect for an industry often
bastardized within the fashion community. "It's flattering that
designers would present surfwear as aspirational.... Up until five
years ago, whenever surfing was referenced on the runways, it was
always associated with the Beach Boys, surfer dudes and 'Fast Times
at Ridgemont High.' I'm relieved that we've gotten beyond those
references," he said.</TE>
<TE>   And though no Chanel board will make its way to the marketplace,
Hild, who collects boards, would still love to have one (maybe for
his mantel?) as a reminder of how the business has matured since
surfer Duke Boyd and seamstress Doris Moore designed the first board
shorts in 1959.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been in the industry 25 years and back then, very few people
who surfed cracked the cover of Vogue. Now, ask any designer who
works in the surf industry and they have shopped at Comme des Garcons
and Prada and Helmut Lang for crossover trends." Quiksilver was
inspired by Prada to design board shorts out of tech fabrics, he
said. "There's a cross-pollination."</TE>

<HD>Playboy's player</HD>
<DH>The new No. 2 man at the magazine reveals a little ...
philosophy.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>On Oct. 7, James Kaminsky, former executive editor of Maxim and a
cousin of funnyman Mel Brooks, took over one of magazine journalism's
most conspicuous gigs: editorial director of Playboy. Founder Hugh
Hefner will remain editor in chief. But Kaminsky, 41, will be the
hare-apparent for Playboy's day-to-day editorial operations. He told
us a bit about his plans.</LD>
<LD>   Will you be taking any meetings wearing black silk pajamas?</LD>
<LD>   I'll probably be wearing my traditional urban clothes. I would
like to emphasize, in no way will I be attempting to usurp Mr. Hefner
in either the business, the magazine or the hearts and minds of its
readers. He is not a hard act to follow; he's an impossible act to
follow.</LD>
<TE>   But still, the editor of Playboy is a high-profile position, yes?
And maybe the public sort of expects a colorful character. You won't
be just sort of a corporate organization guy in a gray flannel suit,
I assume?</TE>
<TE>   Well, I think I'm a pretty colorful guy, in my own way. Time will
tell.</TE>
<TE>   The first issue of Playboy contained Hef's version of the Playboy
Philosophy. As I recall, it had something to do with settling down in
your apartment, throwing some jazz on the hi-fi and discussing
Nietzsche with an attractive young lady.</TE>
<TE>   Sounds great to me.</TE>
<TE>   How has that philosophy had to change in the age of Viagra, adult
cable channels, sexually transmitted diseases and Oval Office
liaisons?</TE>
<TE>   I don't think the main philosophy changes much, because the main
philosophy is all about living the good life. That's what it was in
1953 and that's what it is in 2002 and beyond. It's all about this
attainable vision of endless possibilities, whether those endless
possibilities are sitting down with a beautiful woman and having a
conversation about politics and philosophy, or owning a great car, or
having a great job, they were all part of the package back then. The
language used to describe what that ideal night might've been may
have changed, but the idea hasn't changed much.</TE>
<TE>   Social mores have changed, but let's take a step back: They've
changed as much as anything else because of Playboy itself. This
magazine, unlike just about any magazine you can really mention, was
a force for social change and cultural change in this country. The
notion of wanting the best in life and wanting to share it with good
friends and beautiful women, I don't think that's changed, nor should
it.</TE>
<TE>   So is our culture actually getting sexier, or just more obsessed
with sex?</TE>
<TE>   I think we're catching up with the sexiness of culture. I think
it's hard to say we're more obsessed with sex than we've ever been. I
would say sex is more a regular part of our life than it's ever been.
Back in 1953, when this magazine was created, it was a taboo, it was
something talked about in dark corners and in alleyways. Now it's
something that's talked about on network TV. And it's talked about
very openly, and we're bombarded by visions of sex. Now, some of the
taboos still exist, but those doors are being broken down one by one.
And that's a very good thing for this country.</TE>

<DH>The art world's new darling is Mexico City. But how long
will the affair last?</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Christopher Reynolds</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>Mexico City</DL>
<LD>Contemporary art is a hard-to-crack profession that involves
irregular hours, offers no pension plan and, as practiced at the
moment in Mexico's capital, may entail posing pouty princesses in
palatial homes, organizing tiny bits of reflective tape or collecting
runoff from the city morgue. But if you persist in making such art
here, you have this consolation: The whole world seems to be
watching.</LD>
<LD>   For the last year, curators have been arriving from abroad,
hatching theories and hunting work for a flurry of exhibitions in
museums from Southern California to Rotterdam, a boom that has raised
spirits and suspicions among those who make, sell and collect art
here.</LD>
<LD>   "Here we are, the school of Mexican guys doing things," says
artist Inaki Bonillas, pleased and perplexed. "We're all going to
Berlin, we're going to San Diego, we're going to New York.... "</LD>
<TE>   The organizers of these ventures say they've come because these
artists have shown such wit, energy and international perspective --
the sort of sophistication that the conventionally wise expect from
art capitals like New York and Berlin. But these are artists schooled
in skepticism, and some can't help but wonder: What if it's really
just Mexico City's turn to be the art world's flavor of the month? Or
worse, what if all this attention isn't really about art at all?</TE>
<TE>   Capturing images of self-absorption</TE>
<TE>   "We're the new Cuba!" announces photographer Daniela Rossell, her
voice dripping skepticism.</TE>
<TE>   Rossell, 29, is one of perhaps two dozen artists who are getting
most of the attention. On a steamy afternoon, she slouches in her
studio amid secondhand furniture, stacks of paperwork and assorted
photos of nude women posed with raw fruit and vegetables.</TE>
<TE>   These are the photos that got Rossell noticed by museum and
gallery people in Spain and New York, among other places. But her
newer photos -- a few of which sit over there on the old couch --
have far more people talking. These shots, just printed in book form
by a Madrid-based publisher, show some of Mexico's most privileged
citizens, many of them Rossell's friends and relatives, at play in
their vast and fanciful homes. The book is called "Ricas y Famosas."</TE>
<TE>   The images are meticulous in their documentation of the good life
and the astonishing props that people choose to help them live it
(stuffed lions, for instance, and a hundred-foot turquoise Eiffel
Tower). Now Rossell is caught up in a thinking-class controversy over
whether she has skillfully indicted the self-absorption of Mexico's
nuevo rich, betrayed her friends and family, or both.</TE>
<TE>   "She's from that class," said one local curator, "and she's
documenting their own decadence."</TE>
<TE>   Rossell won't quite say that. She began, years ago, by
photographing houses, then superimposing names on their facades to
more explicitly express the owner's identities. Then, she recalls, "I
began to think about this whole idea about using mass-produced
objects to make yourself unique." Soon, she was shooting
environmental portraits of family members.</TE>
<TE>   "As I started getting into it," she says, "something curious
happened. A lot of people started offering to be photographed, and it
started a ball rolling. A lot of people helped me out."</TE>
<TE>   She says now that her project was intended as an investigation of
this social landscape, not an indictment, and that "when we were
doing it, it was very much about fun. It was cathartic, to me and
them."</TE>
<TE>   But now that the images are in print, it's all more complicated.
Some of her subjects, Rossell admits, "feel they are getting attacked
personally." And one element in the controversy is the fact that the
images are being seen, and judged, by so many people outside Mexico
-- people who might forget that Mexico isn't the only country on
Earth where a coddled upper class sequesters itself from blue-collar
realities.</TE>
<TE>   Rossell says she really doesn't understand the inner workings of
the art world, but she acknowledges that international exposure has
put her career on a different trajectory. Her publisher is in Madrid.
As for dealers, she nods significantly toward the laptop in the
corner.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't work with a Mexican gallery right now. I work with a New
York gallery through that little iBook over there," she says. "I
think in the past, I would have been a miserable, ambitious artist."</TE>
<TE>   Toward a more universal outlook</TE>
<TE>   Whether you credit the Internet or the passage of North American
Free Trade Agreement in 1994 or the end of the PRI party's
seven-decade domination of national politics in 2000, says art dealer
Jaime Riestra, it seems clear that for the first time in a long time,
Mexico is in on some of the art world's most interesting
conversations.</TE>
<TE>   "The artists are moving from problems that are more local to more
universal problems," says Riestra, director of the Galeria OMR in the
Roma district. But as he watches the march of the foreign curators,
he wonders if that's all they're thinking about.</TE>
<TE>   "There's the National Geographic point of view and the aesthetic
point of view. Sometimes, I feel they're looking at us
anthropologically," Riestra says.</TE>
<TE>   For many in Mexico City, the greatest illustration of that worry
was "An Exhibition About the Exchange Rates of Bodies and Values" at
New York's P.S. 1 Contemporary Art Center in the summer. Curator
Klaus Biesenbach's choices included videos of the city's wandering
homeless (from artist Francis Alys); gruesome crime scene photos
(Enrique Metinides); a sculpture of castoff corn cobs (Ruben Ortiz
Torres); and aerial shots of slums (Melanie Smith).</TE>
<TE>   The show "was read only on one level, the level of danger. But
there's more to the pieces than that. They speak about the
contemporary condition, about contemporary living," says artist
Yoshua Okon, who had work in the show and also has run Mexico City's
Panaderia gallery for several years.</TE>
<TE>   The capital looks less hellish and more thoughtful in curator
Betti-Sue Hertz's current San Diego Museum of Art show, "Axis Mexico:
Common Objects and Cosmopolitan Actions." Nineteen artists are
represented (including Rossell and Bonillas), 13 of whom live at
least part time in Mexico City. None was born before 1959.</TE>
<TE>   Hertz says she started campaigning for a Mexico show in December
2000, aiming to show how these artists have digested foreign
influences in a way few of their predecessors ever could, and adopted
methods that reach beyond painting and sculpture. For anyone who
hears the words "Mexican art" and still pictures the folk-influenced
paintings of Diego Rivera and Frida Kahlo, says Hertz, these videos,
photos, installations and assemblages are a wake-up call.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the Institute of Contemporary Art in Boston is readying
its own contemporary Mexican show for 2004. For the artists involved
in shows like these, says ICA curator Gilbert Vicario, the worst
possible outcome "is that they'll forever be labeled "Mexican
artists." And the best is that they'll be looked upon as somebody who
changed the nature of contemporary art, somebody who through local
experience has been able to transcend a national label."</TE>
<TE>   Powered by the possibilities</TE>
<TE>   A few miles from Rossell's apartment in another leafy, upscale
neighborhood, a clean-cut 21-year-old is about to fire up his
PowerBook upstairs at Programa, a gallery he co-directs. This is
Bonillas, already an art world jet-setter. He's just back from
Brussels and Berlin, where his work will be included in upcoming
exhibits. On his laptop, he punches up the details for a
site-specific work commissioned by the San Diego Museum of Art.</TE>
<TE>   For every source of artificial light in the museum's upstairs
galleries, Bonillas and collaborator Santiago Merino have affixed a
bit of reflective tape, 2 inches square, near the door. Five rooms,
426 light sources. And since the museum uses six kinds of bulbs, the
artists' squares come in six colors. Thus, gallery by gallery,
visitors see what Bonillas calls "an inventory of light."</TE>
<TE>   This theme -- the myriad, ghostly variables that lurk behind every
moment of creation and art appreciation -- drives much of Bonillas'
work. He made his first publicly displayed work at age 18, when he
and some collaborators took turns having their way with an empty
room.</TE>
<TE>   "I was thinking about the possibilities you have when you make a
photograph," Bonillas says. And so he set out to illustrate
variations on that theme: One notebook, he filled with images shot at
identical settings, but processed by 24 labs. In another, he
documented the same subject, shot in 84 combinations of exposure
light and time. And so on.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, "I haven't stopped working," he says, adding that
instead of going to college, "I decided to use Programa as my
school." Since 1998 he has averaged five group shows and two solo
shows per year, mostly in Mexico, but also in New York; Toronto;
Bordeaux, France; Milan, Italy; and Tirana, Albania.</TE>
<TE>   He has taken pictures of tourists taking pictures. He has
photographed a clock every three minutes for five hours. For a music
store display, he recorded the whirring sounds of 10 camera shutters,
then set up a listening station. Of these projects, he has sold four
or five works, "but if you think of selling your work," says
Bonillas, who, like Rossell, is a child of a well-to-do family,
"there are several things changed."</TE>
<TE>   Bonillas' work is resolutely abstract. In the words of one local
dealer, "it's almost mathematical," its social implications deeply
buried or absent. But he too has been thinking hard about the
implications of international attention.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, he says he turned down a chance to be part of the P.S. 1
exhibition because the dystopian context bothered him. These foreign
curators, Bonillas says, seem to be in too much of a hurry.</TE>
<TE>   "In two weeks," he says, "they pretend to discover everything."</TE>
<TE>   A compact scene on the move</TE>
<TE>   To an outsider, Mexico City's art scene does seem remarkably
compact. Most of the action happens in a handful of
government-controlled museums and a handful of galleries in the Roma
and Condesa neighborhoods, where dealers cater mostly to buyers from
other countries. For most of the '90s, Okon's Panaderia, a
bakery-turned-gallery, served as a sort of clubhouse for many of the
most adventurous artists, displaying their work and bringing in
foreign artists for brief residencies as well.</TE>
<TE>   But the landscape is changing. Earlier this year, Okon decided to
close the gallery and spend more time teaching and making his own
art. Meanwhile, an ambitious new venture has taken shape in a
well-guarded space behind the massive Jumex fruit juice distribution
center at the ragged industrial edge of town known as Ecatepec.</TE>
<TE>   That's where Jumex executive Eugenio Lopez (who also owns West
Hollywood's Chac Mool Gallery, and whose father is Jumex's top
executive) has taken over more than 15,000 square feet of
high-ceilinged interior space and redone it as a state-of-the-art
exhibition space. In this space, which opened in March 2001 and is
run by full-time director and curator Patricia Martin, Lopez displays
favored works in a contemporary art collection that has surpassed
1,000 pieces, about 30% of them by artists associated with Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   On one wall hangs New York photographer Gregory Crewdson's
"Untitled (Garden)," a dreamscape of a dazed female gardener,
compulsively working the soil that covers the inside of an otherwise
commonplace suburban home. On another wall hangs Mexican-born Gabriel
Orozco's "Atomists: Making Strides," in which the artist subjects
scenes of a soccer game to a sort of geometric charting. On the
screen in the video room (where cartons of Jumex juice stand at the
ready on the tabletop), Mexico City artist Daniel Guzman can be seen
in extreme close-up, singing along with a Neil Young recording on a
video titled "Momentos Irrepetibles." Martin calls this "probably the
country's largest collection of contemporary art."</TE>
<TE>   So far the collection is little known outside artsy and elite
circles. Though it's open by appointment on weekdays, total
attendance from February through mid-August was just 1,800. But plans
are in the works for a second space in the center of the city. And
already, curators elsewhere say, the Jumex collection has served to
raise the city's art profile and boost artists' hopes for domestic
sales.</TE>
<TE>   Tobias Ostrander, who moved here from California about 18 months
ago to serve as contemporary art curator at the Museo Tamayo Arte
Contemporaneo, is one of those who credit the Jumex collection with
raising Mexico City's profile. Another is dealer Monica Manzuto of
the 3-year-old Kuri Manzuto Gallery. But both Ostrander and Manzuto
say two other elements in the Mexico's surging popularity are
inescapable.</TE>
<TE>   First: the Orozco effect. To some degree, this Mexicomania may be
a matter of curators looking for another star to follow the path of
Orozco (born in Veracruz in 1962), whose mixed-media works have won
him solo museum shows in London, Paris, Amsterdam, Milan, New York's
Museum of Modern Art and, in 2000, the Los Angeles Museum of
Contemporary Art. (Orozco declined to participate in the San Diego
show, curator Hertz says, because he preferred to be viewed as an
international artist, not just a Mexican one.)</TE>
<TE>   Second is the movies: "Y Tu Mama Tambien" and "Amores Perros,"
which both premiered to great success in the U.S. last year, offered
a wide and wild view of life in Mexico. When the Mexican daily
Reforma asked curator Klaus Biesenbach what moved him to mount the
harrowing show at P.S. 1, he had to confess: It was "Amores Perros."</TE>
<TE>   Facing a fundamental quandary</TE>
<TE>   It's nearly 10 p.m., and the usual crowd of Mexico City art mavens
is assembled at the Panaderia, including Bonillas and Ostrander. The
occasion is a gallery farewell, and director Okon has commissioned
artist Teresa Margolles (another veteran of the P.S. 1 show) to stage
a happening between its blank white walls.</TE>
<TE>   Inside stand about 150 people. Outside, a chorus of car horns
erupts. A roaring concrete mixer has veered off the road in front of
the gallery. And rolled up to the gallery's loading bay. And dropped
a chute.</TE>
<TE>   As the crowd watches, wet concrete pours forth and creeps toward
the gallery's bare walls, more than a foot deep. And not just any wet
concrete. A gallery aide reveals a sign explaining that this gesture
is titled "Fin" (The End), and that the cement has been mixed with
100 kilos of water taken from the Mexico City morgue -- specifically,
the chamber where corpses are washed after autopsy.</TE>
<TE>   From the audience, there's applause and laughter. Margolles, a
former student of forensic medicine, is a known quantity. For the
exhibition in New York, she installed "Vaporization," which was a
room full of mist from spritzed, but disinfected, morgue water.</TE>
<TE>   You could view this spreading pool of goo as a universally pitched
exploration of death. Or you could view it as modern take on the same
Mexican preoccupation with mortality that fuels countless dancing
folk-art skeletons and Dia de Los Muertos rites. Or you could dismiss
it all as an empty spectacle.</TE>
<TE>   But if you stand in the gallery among the dozens whose exit has
been blocked by the ooze, what it means is only part of your
quandary. There is also the question of how exactly to get out of the
building.</TE>
<TE>   In this city's art scene these days, it seems, whether you're one
of the audience or one of the artists, that next step is going to be
tricky.</TE>

<LD>Hundreds of guests herded through the palatial Beverly Hills home of
Alan Ladd Jr. and his wife, Cindra, out to their lush backyard where
John Travolta and his wife, Kelly Preston, gamely chatted up a group
of fans. Travolta later explained his meet-and-greet philosophy. "It
takes away the tension in the air when you disperse the energy and
say hello. It's easier than the built-up stress in everyone wanting
to meet you," he said, pausing to shake hands.</LD>
<LD>   Nearby, Meryl Streep spoke into "Entertainment Tonight's" camera
about her upcoming role in "The Hours." Suddenly, one partygoer
shouted: "You're stunning!" Streep, wearing a light blue ankle-length
robe, smiled and replied dryly: "I feel like I'm in my bathrobe." In
a courtyard, Olivia Newton-John embraced singer Sheryl Crow, both of
whom later took the stage for a few songs, along with Melissa
Etheridge. "It's been a long time!" Newton-John said.</LD>
<LD>   The event, which raised more than $500,000 for the Children's
Health Environmental Coalition, celebrated the 10th anniversary of
the nonprofit. The group, founded by Nancy and Jim Chuda, funds
research and education on the dangers to children of toxins,
pesticides and cancer-causing agents.</LD>
<TE>   Decked out in the invitation-prescribed "equestrienne, Gypsy or
bohemian" attire, supporters of the Philharmonic Society of Orange
County dined under the stars before attending the U.S. premiere on
Oct. 12 of Theatre Zingaro's "Triptyk," a French equestrian ballet
set to Stravinsky and Boulez.</TE>
<TE>   The society spent "six years of dreaming, 18 months of scheming,
and tonight we are beaming with pride," society executive director
Dean Corey told guests as they feasted on goulash at tables topped
with lanterns and flowers. Afterward, the crowd swept into a
darkened, incense-scented tent to watch the 23 horses perform ballet
moves with dancers from Kerala, India.</TE>

<HD>From her novel a movie blossoms</HD>
<DH>Janet Fitch, author of 'White Oleander,' has watched the
adaptation process in wonder.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Renee Tawa</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Janet Fitch is trying to slink back into the Writer's Life -- working
unnoticed on her novel in a downtown Los Angeles studio, grabbing
meals out of a can -- the life she had before her bestselling book,
"White Oleander," was turned into a feature film.</LD>
<LD>   The movie, starring Michelle Pfeiffer and directed by Peter
Kosminsky, is one of several upcoming big-screen adaptations of
literary fiction that have the potential to introduce vast audiences
to writers who are known in relatively small circles. (The paperback
edition of "White Oleander," which originally was published by
Little, Brown, in 1999, hit No. 9 on Amazon.com after the movie's
publicity blitz.) Also slated for production are film versions of
Jonathan Franzen's "The Corrections" and Alice Sebold's "The Lovely
Bones"; the movie "The Hours," adapted from Michael Cunningham's
Pulitzer Prize-winning novel, is scheduled to open in Decem- ber.</LD>
<TE>   "White Oleander" -- adapted from Fitch's debut novel about a
mother-daughter relationship and a teenager's journey through foster
homes in Southern California -- debuted in September at the Toronto
Film Festival. "When we went into the press conference," recalled
Fitch, 46, "it was John Wells, the producer; Peter Kosminsky ...
click, click, a few random [photographer's] shots, then Michelle
Pfeiffer came in after me. It was like a lightning storm. I couldn't
see the rest of the time. It is such a funny experience as a writer.
It was, like, this is not my beautiful life."</TE>
<TE>   Fitch had no formal association with the movie but served as an
"informal voice," offering suggestions to screenwriter Mary Agnes
Donoghue, Kosminsky and Pfeiffer, and visiting filming locations in
the Los Angeles area. Still, she is avoiding the movie reviews and
box-office returns.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been unbelievably fun," Fitch said, "but just a little bit
distracting. It's a matter of trying to get back to work and not
getting all the trades and listening to every Hollywood TV show
that's covering box office and following all the reviews."</TE>
<TE>   Fitch, who has seen the movie three times with her husband and
12-year-old daughter, said she watched the on-screen story unfold as
a separate work of art. "I was able to just enjoy seeing things I had
imagined built in real space and time by someone else responding to
my book. The way they reacted to the book, their creation ... was
just a fascinating experience to me."</TE>

<LD>The opening of Michael Moore's documentary "Bowling for Columbine"
was preceded by a ubiquitous "see my movie" pitch. In case you
somehow missed the e-mail, here's an excerpt.</LD>
<LD>   Dear friends, fans, and fellow evildoers: I am very happy and
excited to tell you that this Friday, my new film, "Bowling for
Columbine," will open in New York and Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   It is, I promise, the last thing the Bushies want projected on the
movie screens across America this week. The film is, first and
foremost, a devastating indictment of the violence that is done in
our name.... I truly believe this film has the potential to rock the
nation.... Yes, I believe this movie can create a lot of havoc -- but
I will need ALL of you to help me do this. Are you game?</LD>
<TE>   ... Movies live or die based on what happens at the box office the
first weekend of its release. I need you, if you live in the New York
or L.A. area, to go see "Bowling for Columbine" this Friday and
Saturday -- and take as many family members and friends with you as
possible.... A strong opening not only means that the rest of America
will see this film, it means that a good number of people who see it
are going to leave the film angry enough to get active and get
involved. If it does poorly, I will have a difficult time finding the
funding for the movie I want to make next....</TE>
<TE>   Don't let that happen.</TE>
<TE>   ... Yours, Michael Moore</TE>

<LD>The John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington,
D.C., is extending a hand -- and advice -- to two ethnically oriented
Los Angeles performance troupes.</LD>
<LD>   Instead of cash, East West Players, an Asian American theater
company, and the Lula Washington Dance Theatre, an African American
ensemble, will have access to managerial expertise over the next two
years.</LD>
<LD>   The aim is to help strengthen their behind-the-scenes
administration and planning. The two L.A. groups are among 15
producers of African American, Asian, Latino and Native American
works nationwide chosen for the new initiative, which is partly
funded by $500,000 from SBC Communications Inc.</LD>
<TE>   Help will come via seminars and online dialogues during the
program's first year; then the Kennedy Center will pick up the tab as
graduates of its Vilar Institute for Arts Management join
participating companies' staffs for up to a year.</TE>

<LD>The architect who will receive the 2002 Gold Medal at the AIA/Los
Angeles Design Awards Gala on Thursday at downtown's new Cathedral of
Our Lady of the Angels is also one of the cathedral's most outspoken
critics.</LD>
<LD>   Barton Myers, a Westwood architect known for designing the
Cerritos Center for the Performing Arts, has no problem with Jose
Rafael Moneo's striking contemporary design -- he just doesn't like
the location. A proponent of redevelopment over urban sprawl, Myers
believes the Los Angeles Archdiocese should have remodeled downtown's
earthquake-damaged St. Vibiana's instead. The cathedral "doesn't have
the impact it could have had if they had redeveloped," Myers said in
a recent interview. The annual awards by the L.A. chapter of the
American Institute of Architects also will honor the late civic
leader and downtown developer Ira Yellin with a posthumous
Presidential Citation Award for lifetime achievement. Yellin died
Sept. 10 after a yearlong battle with cancer.</LD>
<TE>   Other honorees are Bob Timme of the USC School of Architecture,
for community service; Tom Gilmore, who will receive the City

<LD>Los Angeles has rarely been a hospitable place for magazines,
especially not art magazines. Last December, the bimonthly Art issues
closed shop after 13 years of publication here.</LD>
<LD>   Maybe academe can do it better.</LD>
<LD>   This month, a new art journal is coming to the Southland through a
joint effort between CalArts and London's Central Saint Martins
College of Art &amp; Design. Afterall was launched in 1998 but has not,
until now, had American newsstand distribution. Each $12.50 issue
covers five contemporary artists and offers essays on contemporary
art.</LD>
<TE>   CalArts is providing an editorial assistant and an office for the
publication, which will be headed here by School of Art Dean Thomas
Lawson.</TE>
<TE>   The closure of Art issues "left a terrible gap, and to some extent
we'll be filling that," he said, but there won't be local reviews.
Still, "artists here can see what's on the international radar. And
artists here can be read about by readers drinking coffee in
Cologne."</TE>
<TE>   The next issue of Afterall, which comes out twice yearly and has a
circulation of 2,000, should be on newsstands within weeks.</TE>

<LD>The first music played in the Walt Disney Concert Hall, we reported
last week, came from concertmaster Martin Chalifour as part of a
late-night adventure with architect Frank O. Gehry and Los Angeles
Philharmonic music director Esa-Pekka Salonen. But what will be the
first music heard by the public when the hall opens a year from now?</LD>
<LD>   The Philharmonic is being secretive until its official
announcement Nov. 21, smugly sealing news leaks more effectively than
the Pentagon. But music is not war, and it's interesting to know some
of the plans for the opening concerts, considering the enormous
impact they could have on Los Angeles' cultural profile.</LD>
<LD>   Here, at least, are a few details. There will be several, probably
four, opening events. John Adams was long ago approached for new work
to celebrate the occasion, and you can be sure Elton John, who made a
mockery of the opening night of Verizon Hall in Philadelphia, has no
such invitation. Mahler's Second Symphony, performed by Salonen, the
orchestra and Los Angeles Master Chorale, will also be among the
opening events.</LD>
<TE>   And during the first season of the hall there will be appearances
by the Berlin Philharmonic under its new music director, Simon
Rattle, and the San Francisco Symphony, under Michael Tilson Thomas.</TE>

<LD>At a recent symposium on collecting at the Museum of Latin American
Art in Long Beach, the moderator lobbed a tough question at New York
dealer Mary-Anne Martin: How can one avoid forgeries?</LD>
<LD>   "Understand that there are many people out there ready to fool
you," she said. "Frida Kahlo probably made 200 paintings and some
drawings in her life. Yet I am offered five to 10 new works by Frida
Kahlo every month."</LD>
<LD>   If Cuban artist Wifredo Lam had worked 24 hours a day during the
1940s, he could not have produced the thousands of works attributed
to him during that period. As for Mexican master Rufino Tamayo, 10 or
15 fakes show up on EBay every day, she said.</LD>
<TE>   The problem is that scholarship on Latin American artists lags way
behind their fully documented European counterparts, Martin said.</TE>
<TE>   So what's a collector to do?</TE>
<TE>   Above all, beware of bargains, she said. "Just remember, if
someone were offering you a diamond ring, you would go to an
appraiser."</TE>

<LD>Doris Roberts vividly remembers her reaction when told in 1996 that
CBS had scheduled her new show, "Everybody Loves Raymond," Fridays
after "Dave's World."</LD>
<LD>   "Friday night at 8:30 on CBS? It's a death slot. The last success
they had in that hour on Friday was 'Gomer Pyle.'"</LD>
<LD>   Of course, her skepticism was based on experience. Three years
earlier she co-starred in "The Boys," a sitcom starring Chris Meloni
as a young writer who befriends three older men. The cast included
Ned Beatty as a retired fireman and Roberts as his wife, Doris.</LD>
<TE>   The show lasted four weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Meloni currently stars in "Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit,"
while the actor who he ended up replacing at the last minute in "The
Boys" also did OK for himself. Anthony Edwards was cast a year later
as one of the leads on a new series, "ER."</TE>

<HD>Deep in the heart of Arlen, Texas</HD>
<DH>The 'King of the Hill' writers take a field trip for
stories -- and for barbecue.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Paul Brownfield</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>Austin, Texas</DL>
<LD>On the Monday morning after the Emmy Awards last month, while much of
the TV industry was sleeping off a night of self-celebration and
repeated acts of valet parking, 12 comedy writers from the animated
Fox series "King of the Hill" met in the American Airlines terminal
at LAX.</LD>
<LD>   By 8 a.m. they were at their gate, sprawled out. Seen as a
subspecies, TV comedy writers look like who they are -- white guys,
or mostly white guys, in their late 20s and 30s, with jobs that don't
require them to tuck in their shirts.</LD>
<TE>   These writers were headed to Austin, where for the next two days
they would interview people about floods, child beauty pageants and
propane. "King of the Hill," whose seventh season on Fox begins Nov.
3, takes place in the made-up town of Arlen, Texas, where Hank Hill
sells propane and propane accessories ("with dignity"). Hank's loves,
in no discernible order, are his backyard grill, his headstrong wife
Peggy and surprisingly deep, fruit-pie-eating son Bobby, and the art
of standing in front of a fence, drinking beer out of a can. In this
last pursuit, Hank is typically joined by his three friends: Bill, a
divorced loner, sad and wide-eyed; Boomhauer, who speaks in twangy,
vaguely comprehensible sentences; and Dale, an anti-government
enthusiast who sounds like a cross between William S. Burroughs and a
farmer on hooch. It is in front of the fence, from Hank to Dale, that
the show finds its political voice, in various shades of Texas drawl.
"The schools teach reading, writing and arithmetic, but they don't
teach the subjects that will really matter after the coming
apocalypse. Namely, etiquette and social dancing," is something Dale
says.</TE>
<TE>   In what has become something of a yearly tradition, the writers
dream up story lines for these characters in L.A., then head to
Austin for a research trip. It all sounds a little bit like an
African safari, wherein a bunch of Hollywood guys drop in on Texas to
watch the locals in their native habitat. Except these writers go for
the verisimilitude. And the barbecue.</TE>
<TE>   This year, in addition to touring a mega-church (Texas-speak for a
very large church) and Action Propane in Leander, the writers would
meet with a panel from the American Red Cross to talk flood relief
(it was time, they thought, for Arlen to be visited by a flood). Each
writer would be given $150 in cash and a suck-up pad -- show-speak
for the notepads they were supposed to use when interviewing people.</TE>
<TE>   The suck-up part is a facetious reference to executive producer
Greg Daniels. Daniels was the last one to show up at the gate. He was
wearing cowboy boots. Daniels, who is more than 6 feet tall and looks
a little bit like a policy wonk, grew up in Manhattan and went to
Harvard; there, he became a member of the Harvard Lampoon, the
school's humor society and progenitor of countless TV comedy writers.
Daniels, 39, is no exception; his credits include "Saturday Night
Live," "Not Necessarily the News" -- and the show that became the
Lampoon West, "The Simpsons."</TE>
<TE>   When Daniels signed up to develop "King of the Hill," he made a
pilgrimage to Austin, to visit Mike Judge. The creator and voices
behind the wildly popular MTV cartoon "Beavis and Butt-head," Judge,
who has an innate sense of people and their quirks, had pitched "King
of the Hill" to Fox based on a treatment and some drawings. "He
showed me some of the places where he thought Hank lived," Daniels
said of that initial trip to Austin to visit Judge. "I found it to be
very useful."</TE>
<TE>   One year the writers were thrown out of a gun show, but that only
taught them to identify themselves to locals on a need-to-know basis.
Like their show, they are not here to mock hillbillies, they are here
to gather data -- the details and anecdotes that give "King of the
Hill" that rare commodity on TV: a sense of an actual world.</TE>
<TE>   Most shows don't have a world. They have sets, and craft-service
tables, and actors with agents, but no world. With "King of the
Hill," it is possible to land at the Austin airport, rent several
cars and, after checking into the downtown Driskill Hotel, go looking
for Arlen. Their first night in town, the writers delved into the
ribs at the Ironworks Barbeque and afterward worked off the meal at
Red's Indoor Shooting Range, out in nearby Pflugerville. Red's offers
a frequent-shooter card for $119.95, but the writers just picked out
some handguns and rented several lanes for an hour. There was a
mother and daughter over in Lane 1 -- Sally Joe Frame of Round Rock
and her 13-year-old daughter, Amy Sue. "The NRA is really pushing
youth hunts," Frame told Kit Boss, one of the writers. He jotted this
down in his suck-up pad.</TE>
<TE>   If shooting a gun for the first time is a kind of bar mitzvah in
Texas, "King of the Hill" has already addressed this. In the episode,
Bobby asks Hank to take him hunting for the first time. Hank is
embarrassed -- not because he disapproves of firearms, but because
he's a bad shot and will screw up a key bonding ritual with his son.
In the end, Hank lets Bobby drive his truck and they proceed to run
over a deer. It is a measure of how marginally understood "King of
the Hill" is when you consider the TV Guide synopsis of that episode:
"Hank teaches Bobby to drive."</TE>
<TE>   Physics, mathematics and 'Beavis'</TE>
<TE>   Compared with Greg Daniels, Mike Judge is more idiosyncratic and
less sociable, and his sense of communion with the entertainment
industry is fraught with doom. He grew up in Albuquerque, where he
had a paper route and was in the post-Boy Scout Explorers. He has a
degree in physics from UC San Diego and later dropped out of the
University of Texas in Dallas, where he was working on an advanced
degree in mathematics. Judge, who appears to be a self-taught savant,
also spent several years playing bass in a blues band called Anson
Funderburgh &amp; the Rockets. Then he got into making animated shorts,
which led, in 1992, to Judge creating and/or perpetrating upon the
public "Beavis and Butt-head."</TE>
<TE>   The show moved Judge and his family to New York, where MTV is
headquartered, but he didn't stay long; in 1994, as the "Beavis"
craze was mounting, Judge high-tailed it out of Manhattan, choosing
to settle in Austin. MTV built him a recording studio in a suite of
offices and Judge, more happily cocooned, video-conferenced on
"Beavis and Butt-head."</TE>
<TE>   Judge, 40, works similarly on "King of the Hill." He comes to L.A.
during the summers to surf (he has a place in Malibu), but otherwise
remains ensconced in Austin, developing various feature-film ideas as
a follow-up to his 1999 film, "Office Space," and voicing Hank and
Boomhauer from his studio.</TE>
<TE>   Almost immediately after checking into the Driskill, the writers
went to Judge's office to discuss their two-day itinerary. They
convened in a large room dominated by a pool table and ringed by
musical instruments, including a "Beavis and Butt-head" double-necked
guitar. Judge demonstrated some pedal steel guitar and then stood
shyly beneath a framed drawing from R. Crumb's comic book "Mystic
Funnies."</TE>
<TE>   Most of the faces in the room were unfamiliar to him. Except for
Judge and Daniels, the original "King of the Hill" writers have moved
on. Nowadays, the show is being run by the writing team of Altschuler
(John) and Krinsky (Dave), who joined "King of the Hill" after Fox's
initial 12-episode order.</TE>
<TE>   They are not Lampoon guys. Judge is conflicted about Lampoon guys,
since he tends to associate them with shows where people sit in a
room "trying to get each other's references." "King of the Hill" has
long had a mix of Lampoon guys and native Texans, among others.
Altschuler, 39, grew up in Illinois and North Carolina, the son of an
anthropology professor who decided, when Altschuler was 15, to rejoin
the Merchant Marines (Altschuler promptly bought himself a trailer
for $3,000 and kept house, on his own). Krinsky, also 39, is from
Florida. They met as freshmen at the University of North Carolina in
Chapel Hill and, after graduation, struggled to make ends meet in
Hollywood for a decade, living out of a Burbank two-bedroom. Krinsky
was a bellman at a Beverly Hills hotel, Altschuler delivered room
service at a Hyatt. Once, when they were trying to become rich
screenwriters, Altschuler and Krinsky found themselves pitching a
remake of "The Sound of Music" as a Pauly Shore vehicle.</TE>
<TE>   Now Judge wanted to know if Cohen was in the room. He had two to
choose from -- Greg Cohen, a new writer, and Etan Cohen, the Cohen to
whom Judge was referring. (There was also previously an Alan Cohen on
"King of the Hill," who was partnered with Alan Freedland; they were
referred to as "the Alans.")</TE>
<TE>   Etan Cohen, soft-spoken and wearing a Boston Red Sox cap,
indicated his presence. He is a 28-year-old Orthodox Jew who wrote
for the Harvard Lampoon and freelanced his first TV script -- an
episode of "Beavis and Butt-head" -- while he was studying at a
yeshiva in Efrat, south of Jerusalem. He wrote the script during
breakfast. "In the yeshiva culture, there's a real sensitivity about
wasting time," he explained.</TE>
<TE>   Cohen, it turned out, is collaborating with Judge on several film
projects, including a sequel to the animated feature "Beavis and
Butt-head Do America," and a comedy, at one time called "3001," in
which a man of average intelligence is cryogenically frozen for a
thousand years. By the time he's thawed out, this average man has
become brilliant, because the country has gotten stupider.</TE>
<TE>   Asked later why he chose to collaborate with Cohen, Judge said:
"He comes from a smart place, but he's really good at writing dumb."</TE>
<TE>   Animation with a moral center</TE>
<TE>   As television, "King of the Hill" is counterintuitive. Its
characters are static, realistic-seeming drawings that move and talk,
as opposed to static, realistic-seeming actors who move and talk. The
show's stories build logically from character and place, and they
manage to be subversive and sweet. This can be confusing in a medium
in which shows scream about a star and a premise ("It's Ritter! And
he's a dad!!!"), then look around for a story, and a place, like so
many emperors last-minute-shopping for clothes.</TE>
<TE>   While "The Simpsons" is a consistent achievement in zany plots and
heavily referential joke writing, "King of the Hill" is
character-driven and deceptively slow. Thanks to syndication, the
show airs 11 times a week on Fox's KTTV in Los Angeles, and in prime
time the series returns this year to Sunday nights at 8:30, behind
"The Simpsons," where it enjoyed its best two seasons in the late
'90s, averaging more than 15 million viewers.</TE>
<TE>   Although Fox still has "Futurama" in its Sunday night lineup, that
series has not been renewed; it is on this season because new
episodes have already been made. For networks, animation is a dense
process that is difficult to control, forcing decisions well in
advance of ratings. It takes as many as nine months to complete an
episode of "The Simpsons" or "King of the Hill," because so much
creative and physical labor is involved -- a thicket of recording and
rerecording, of storyboarding and re-storyboarding, of waiting to see
a rough version of the animation, called animatics, which can also be
revised -- all before an episode is sent off to South Korea for the
images to be minted on cels. Because the process is so fractured and
drawn-out, topical jokes are committed at your own peril.</TE>
<TE>   But in 1997, prime-time animation was trendy, and Judge was even
trendier. Along with Trey Parker and Matt Stone of "South Park," he
was supposedly part of a band of misfit auteurs whose rudimentary
animation was directly proportional to the crudeness of their humor,
with characters who passed gas and barfed and belched, like puppet
shows gone horribly bad.</TE>
<TE>   The trouble with lumping in "King of the Hill" with "South Park"
or "Beavis and Butt-head" is that although all three shows are deeply
mischievous, "King of the Hill" is the only one with a moral center
and a deeply ingrained sense of place. Arlen, Texas, says Judge, is
anywhere you find "white guys and engines and beers." But it is also
a place where the Mega Lo Mart is forever crowding out the little guy
and a fellow can't go hunting without bumping into a bunch of Hacky
Sack-playing tree-huggers.</TE>
<TE>   To that end, it was Daniels who had the writers read "The Death of
Common Sense" to get inside the heart and mind of Hank Hill. The
book, written by Georgetown law professor Philip K. Howard and a
bestseller in the mid-'90s, argued that a regulatory-happy government
was crowding out good old-fashioned common sense with laws that
inspired lunacy. This, standing in front of his fence with his beer
and his friends and his otherwise unperturbed freedom, is the
thinking of Hank Hill.</TE>
<TE>   "Andy Griffith is back and he's pissed," is one of the ways in
which Johnny Hardwick remembers thinking of Hank Hill. Hardwick, who
voices Dale, was the first writer Daniels hired, after seeing him do
Texas material at a stand-up comedy showcase in L.A. After six years
in the writers' room, Hardwick recently bought a large, handsome
house in Austin that features a working teepee in the backyard.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday night, after barbecue at the Ironworks and gunplay at
Red's, the writers headed over to Hardwick's house for beers.
Hardwick was wearing a T-shirt that featured Vice President Dick
Cheney's face, with a dark, Hitler milk mustache. "Got oil?" it said.</TE>
<TE>   Inspiration from on high</TE>
<TE>   Greg Daniels was in the passenger seat of a rental car. Kit Boss
was driving. The writers had split up and fanned out. They had their
suck-up pads. "We Buy Ugly Houses," the billboard said.</TE>
<TE>   Daniels looked up and thought of a story line: Hank and Peggy Hill
swell with pride when a real estate agent calls wanting to purchase
their home, only to discover that she's from the "We Buy Ugly Houses"
agency.</TE>
<TE>   Already, the day had been fruitful. On "King of the Hill," Arlen
has been visited by a tornado and a freak ice storm, but not by a
flood. That's what prompted Daniels, Boss, Altschuler, Dan Sterling
and Etan Cohen to go to the American Red Cross offices for a meeting
with a panel of flood-relief workers.</TE>
<TE>   An alarmingly serious discussion ensued about flood relief. "Do
you find interesting senses of loss that you didn't expect?"
Altschuler asked Lois Heger, a disaster-related mental health
specialist. Heger talked of the person who mourned a favorite can
opener. She went on to describe a range of reactions to a flood's
devastation, and to a shelter, whose paradoxical purpose is to
provide a haven for the dispossessed while preparing them to go back
home. There are those, Heger noted, who find shelters to be homier
than their sad lives at home (story line for Bill?), and those who
don't trust the shelter hierarchy (story line for Dale?).</TE>
<TE>   That evening, some of the writers went to a Baptist singles mixer
at the mega-church. Christy Stratton sat in the lobby of the Driskill
Hotel, chatting with Annette Rushing and Kay Davis. Rushing runs the
Little Miss Austin pageant, and Davis' 5-year-old daughter is a
former winner. Stratton, who came to "King of the Hill" after writing
on NBC's "Three Sisters," was working on a story in which Hank Hill's
live-in niece, Luanne, gets involved in the baby pageant business.</TE>
<TE>   Stratton pumped the two women for information. What do judges look
for in babies? (Facial features, onstage personality, overall
appearance, she was told.) What kind of disasters can happen on
stage? ("Oh, kids throwing up," Rushing said.)</TE>
<TE>   On the phone two weeks after the trip, when the writers were back
in L.A. breaking stories, Altschuler said things looked good for the
pageant story line. "We're definitely going to do a flood story," he
said. "There's just too many good elements there."</TE>
<TE>   He was also high on a story involving a propane-fueled mosquito
killer and a story two writers had stumbled upon. "Etan and Kit, on
the way to the airport, stopped at a tractor place," Altschuler said.
They had run into a woman who apparently has a pet deer, whom she
calls Bam Bam, because that's the sound the deer made when the animal
hit her car.</TE>

<LD>Like other writer-directors who live in Austin, Texas -- Terrence
Malick and Robert Rodriguez, for whom he played a villain in "Spy
Kids 2" -- Mike Judge tries to work in the studio system while
remaining geographically detached from it.</LD>
<LD>   Judge's 1999 film "Office Space" hit with a thud at the box
office. But the movie is now held up as a deft satire of office
drones, who, in "Office Space," work at a faceless, downsizing,
high-tech company. Today, "Office Space" often airs on cable and is
beloved among video store clerks.</LD>
<LD>   After "Office Space," Judge said, "there was a movie I was going
to produce, a small movie, that eventually fell apart." With fellow
"King of the Hill" writers Greg Daniels and Jim Dauterive, Judge made
a pilot for Fox two seasons ago called "Monsignor Martinez," about an
excommunicated priest who breaks with the Catholic Church in his
corrupt village over the turn the other cheek issue and ends up
chasing down a drug lord in San Diego.</LD>
<TE>   A sequel to his animated feature "Beavis and Butt-head Do America"
is on hold, said Judge, who has also been doing battle with MTV over
a DVD compilation of the series "Beavis and Butt-head." MTV, Judge
said, put out the compilation without consulting him.</TE>

<HD>Where did the challenge go?</HD>
<DH>Independent films, lacking the aesthetic and political
urgency that once made them so exciting, seem to be less about 'art'
and more about the art of the deal.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Manohla Dargis</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Why has "art" become a dirty word -- at least when it comes to
American movies? The question first started to nag me last fall
around the time David Lynch's "Mulholland Drive" failed to set the
world on fire. This hypnotic, heartbreaking work was among the best
American films of the last decade and certainly its dystopic
visionary's greatest movie in years. If the world were sane or at
least more interesting, Lynch's film would have restored him to the
Valhalla of our acknowledged masters or at least onto the covers of a
few glossy magazines, where he'd once perched for "Twin Peaks."</LD>
<LD>   As it turned out, "Mulholland Drive" wasn't even nominated for any
major awards at that year's alternative Oscars, the Independent
Spirit Awards. The director, who with his 1986 film "Blue Velvet" had
helped to define contemporary independent cinema, had been kicked to
the indie curb.</LD>
<TE>   Movies have always been caught between the Scylla and Charybdis of
art and entertainment, between their aesthetic promise and hard
bottom line. Lately, though, the word "art" is scarcely mentioned in
discussions about films in this country, even where you might most
expect it, namely independent cinema. The reasons are complex but
would have to include the decline of fine art in middle-class life
and our love affair with the most trivial aspects of entertainment
culture. Grosses and gossip dominate the popular discourse, as does
the media's endless shilling for the hottest, sexiest stars and scads
of new movies that look an awful lot like the old ones, only worse.
Meanwhile, in more rarefied cinematic forums, the faithful risk the
public's indifference by writing about foreign-language movies most
Americans will never see -- because distributors won't release them,
because exhibitors won't show them, because critics won't look at
them.</TE>
<TE>   In a 1956 essay called "Movies, the Desperate Art," Pauline Kael
set her sights on Hollywood and avant-garde film, putting forth an
argument that is as relevant now as it was then. "From the
beginning," she wrote, "American filmmakers have been crippled by
business financing and the ideology it imposed: They were told that
they had an obligation to entertain the general public, that this was
a democratic function and a higher obligation than to give their best
to a few hundred or a few million people." For Kael, this flight from
the medium and its possibilities embarked on by Hollywood could now
be avoided because it had become clear that "there is more than one
audience, and that artists must judge their own obligations."</TE>
<TE>   It's a simple idea, really, the notion that there are different
audiences and that the artist must decide his or her own obligations.
Indeed, the recognition of different audiences and the belief that
filmmakers are artists cut to the heart and soul of the independent
film movement that took off in the mid-1980s. Yet we live in a moment
when fear of the mass audience and, perhaps more important, the
corporate fear of that audience, means that most filmmakers are no
longer allowed to decide their own obligations, even in the putative
independent film world. It is one of the ironies of contemporary
American cinema that although the studios have been revitalized by
independent film, from which they siphoned off ideas and talent, the
indies have become, more and more, as captive to the tyranny of
public taste as Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   Perplexingly poetic</TE>
<TE>   Awash in triviality, largely absent the aesthetic and political
urgency that once made it so exciting, independent film is suffering
from an identity crisis. Which isn't to say that good movies aren't
being made. Writer-director Richard Kelly's "Donnie Darko" was the
most auspicious debut by a young American director since Paul Thomas
Anderson showed us his stuff with "Hard Eight" some five years
earlier. Released in October 2001, "Donnie Darko," with its poetic
melancholy and ill-timed plot device of a wayward airplane engine,
didn't stand a chance. It didn't help that audiences, including
critics, seemed as perplexed by its narrative curves as by what it
all meant, including the engine and the raggedy bunny with the evil
metal grin. More than one critic complained that Kelly was overly
ambitious, suffering from the unusual affliction of having too many
ideas.</TE>
<TE>   It has been a decade since Quentin Tarantino hit with his gangster
film "Reservoir Dogs." As much as I admire that film and its
follow-up, "Pulp Fiction," I have started to wonder if American
cinema's reliance on genre is yielding increasingly diminished
returns for the medium as an art. After "Pulp Fiction" in particular,
the independent film world that had recently seemed so alive with
possibility began to seem, with each passing Sundance, in thrall to a
limited repertoire of stories and a crass commercial imperative.</TE>
<TE>   The expansive, often genre-transcending vision of filmmakers such
as Jim Jarmusch and Charles Burnett, who at their best made us
believe that the medium's possibilities were without limit, were
replaced by an indistinguishable parade of young (mostly) men who had
their eyes on the Hollywood prize. Genre for these young Turks didn't
seem like a means to personal expression but to a deal with Harvey
Weinstein. But who cared about art when there was so much fast, fun
entertainment to imbibe? Certainly not the media or the industry,
both of which were only too happy to embrace the easier (and
easier-selling) pop kicks of retread genre stories, leaving behind
the harder-earned returns of a Jarmusch.</TE>
<TE>   There have been worthy genre films made in the last decade, of
course, but too often even the best ones have had the feel of a room
with no windows. American film has gone through cycles of creative
fertility and drought; today, we look at the 1970s, in particular,
with nostalgia as well as amnesia. The decade is often lauded as a
period of aesthetic daring and independence. At the same time, it's
worth remembering that no matter how deep the influence of the
European art movie, many of the best American films of the 1970s were
made within the confines of genre. In certain circles, it is common
to blame "Star Wars" and the dawn of the blockbuster on the decline
of American film creativity. But shouldn't part of the blame rest on
our inability or unwillingness to escape genre? Even Coppola could
only squeeze two masterpieces out of the gangster film.</TE>
<TE>   That said, there is a world of difference between "The Godfather"
and its brilliant sequel -- gangster films that look at the immigrant
experience against the backdrop of capitalism -- and a movie like Sam
Mendes' "Road to Perdition." The first two "Godfather" films are
epics not only in narrative scale but also of aesthetic and
imaginative ambition. They are about something. But what is "Road to
Perdition" about, save for its own gleaming surface? Postmodernism's
double-edged sword means that while critics rightly take American
movies and pop culture seriously, and give genre film the same
consideration as any other artistic expression, too many of those
same gatekeepers no longer feel obliged to bestow the same attention
on work that doesn't fit inside familiar parameters. They're
uninterested in movies that don't subscribe to formula; at times,
they're resentful.</TE>
<TE>   The reaction to "Mulholland Drive" was instructive, especially in
light of Christopher Nolan's "Memento," a film that was greeted in
some critical quarters with the sort of weighty attention once
bestowed on the work of Michelangelo Antonioni and Ingmar Bergman.
For all its storytelling razzle-dazzle, "Memento" is more of a clever
puzzle than a metaphysical rebus; its delights primarily involve the
effort it takes to un-kink its narrative. Distributors nonetheless
believed the film was too difficult for viewers, and eventually a
company that had helped finance the film ended up releasing it as
well.</TE>
<TE>   "Memento" was a hit but not so "Donnie Darko." Although critics
had thrilled to the narrative zigzags of "Memento," they seemed
perplexed by those in "Donnie Darko," perhaps because the film didn't
seem to fit into any particular template. Was it a horror film or a
teen movie, Lynch-lite or the dark side of John Hughes? Most critics
didn't know and weren't interested in finding out. It was around the
time that "Donnie Darko" fell into an abyss of critical apathy that I
started to hear that "Mulholland Drive," which had opened a month
earlier, was making people angry. One friend actually admitted that
she had gotten into a fight with her husband because he had liked the
Lynch movie and she hadn't. The film made her feel stupid because she
hadn't understood the finale; by saying he liked the film, her
husband had made her feel the same way.</TE>
<TE>   Two viewings are required</TE>
<TE>   I didn't understand "Mulholland Drive" completely after one
viewing, either. It was only when I returned to it a second time that
I realized (or thought I did) the significance of an early shot of a
pillow. The pillow was the last thing that Naomi Watts' character saw
before sinking into her death and this moment was the start of a
narrative loop that would only close at the film's conclusion when
her character commits suicide. Was I right? I have no idea. In the
end, a more precise accounting of what happens seems beside the point
of what makes it a remarkable work of art. I felt the same way about
Jean-Luc Godard's recent "In Praise of Love," which I happily watched
twice before I grasped its meaning. One of the great pleasures of
art, after all, is ambiguity -- that place where you and the work
come together, and from which transcendence emanates even when an
instruction manual doesn't.</TE>
<TE>   If the critical hostility to "In Praise of Love" was surprising,
it wasn't shocking. A few months earlier, Steven Soderbergh's
bagatelle "Full Frontal" had worked numerous critics into a lather
mostly, it seems, because it didn't look like the director's last
three features, the social issue pictures "Erin Brockovich" and
"Traffic" and the heist film "Ocean's Eleven." Defying
categorization, Soderbergh is a cinematic chameleon who embraces the
polar extremes of expressionism, from his 1996 experimental freak-out
"Schizopolis" to 1998's "Out of Sight," a caper film as pleasurable
as anything from Hollywood's golden age. The irony is that his talent
for winning over audiences with his more mainstream features may have
made it more difficult for him to play with form and meaning as he
did in "Full Frontal." But playing with form these days, much less
aspiring to art, is a perilous enterprise for an American filmmaker.
Step out of the box these days and you might just get squashed.</TE>

<HD>Taper personnel now hear with their eyes</HD>
<DH>Sign language classes help them prepare for Deaf West's
'Big River.'</DH>

<LD>For the next few weeks, things may be a little quieter backstage at
the Mark Taper Forum. That's because some Taper staff members have
begun signing to each other instead of speaking -- busily practicing
their new skills in American Sign Language in preparation for the
Nov. 14 opening of Deaf West Theatre's musical "Big River -- The
Adventures of Huckleberry Finn," performed by a cast of hearing and
deaf actors using music, voice, sign language and dance.</LD>
<LD>   Since early August, staffers involved in everything from ticket
sales to costume-fitting have been offered the opportunity to attend
weekly lunch-hour classes in ASL to better serve deaf and
hard-of-hearing theater patrons and members of the "Big River" cast.</LD>
<TE>   Most classes are taught by Megg and Michael Davis, who are
hard-of-hearing and Deaf (Michael prefers the capital D),
respectively. Michael Davis, who portrays Tom Sawyer in "Big River,"
has been filling in for the pregnant Megg when morning sickness
renders her hard of teaching. Both Davises teach ASL as a
total-immersion course: all signing, all the time. No interpreters.
Production manager Jonathan Lee has a leg up on ASL newcomers: The
Taper veteran learned to sign during the Taper's 1979-80 season, when
the theater produced "Children of a Lesser God." Lee says
communication with the deaf has been rendered easier with the advent
of e-mail, text messaging, pagers and other electronic gadgets. But
the quick-start program in ASL has remained essentially the same.</TE>
<TE>   "When we were doing it with 'Children of a Lesser God,' we didn't
know whether it was going to work," he said. "We now know that
hearing actors can be taught how to sign in a relatively short period
of time."</TE>
<TE>   Phyllis Frelich, who starred in "Lesser God" and has a role in
"Big River," used e-mail to offer this observation: "Sign language
and deaf actors have gone from being novelties in 'Children of a
Lesser God' to becoming integrated into the many theatrical elements
of a large music production like 'Big River.' "</TE>

<HD>Windows on modernism</HD>
<DH>Frank Lloyd Wright's nature-inspired architectural style
found its way to his stained-glass making, with its own set of
abstracted forms.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Hugh Hart</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Judging from a 1902 sketch, Frank Lloyd Wright was not much of a
speller.</LD>
<LD>   The master architect scratched down "sumach," then tried "shumac."
But grammar aside, the notes he left behind have thrilled scholars of
his leaded-glass artwork. It's proof that the inspiration for the
stained-glass window he designed for the Dana House in Springfield,
Ill., was, in fact, the sumac tree.</LD>
<LD>   The sumac window, and the sketch, are included in "Light Screens:
The Leaded Glass of Frank Lloyd Wright." The exhibition, which runs
through Jan. 5 at the Orange County Museum of Art, features 50
windows created for Wright homes between 1885 and 1923. There are
also sketches, floor plans, photographs and a box of children's toys
to help explain the sources behind Wright's intricately patterned art
glass.</LD>
<TE>   Some explanation is useful, because Wright, unlike nearly all of
his contemporaries, was essentially creating abstract art with glass.
"Usually, whether it's medieval or modern glass in a cathedral or a
Tiffany window in a house, stained glass is a picture in glass," says
exhibition curator Julie L. Sloan. "Wright was doing abstractions,
and that was shockingly new."</TE>
<TE>   For Sloan, decoding Wright's glasswork has become vocation,
publishing specialty and presiding passion for the last 19 years.</TE>
<TE>   Outfitted in pearls and a sleek black ensemble, Sloan showed up at
the museum recently, fresh from a flight from her Boston-area home
and eager to recite chapter and verse on the influences fueling
Wright's handiwork.</TE>
<TE>   First, she reviews Wright's apprenticeship with Louis Sullivan,
which produced elegant but derivative windows, represented in the
museum exhibition by a piece he did for the Luxfer Prism Co. in 1898.</TE>
<TE>   Moving right along, the exhibition focuses on the period beginning
around 1900, when Wright launched his Prairie School style of
nature-inspired, low-to-the-ground architecture. The windows banish
curves in favor of chevrons, rectangles and squares, and Wright
introduces color for the first time. "Look at the buds of the sumac
tree," Sloan says, standing in front of the Dana House window. "It
was very important to him in this period that the colors are all
prairie-inspired -- gold, amber, green. They go with the houses. The
materials, the natural wood and the colors that he used to paint the
walls were all these warm colors."</TE>
<TE>   Inside meets outside</TE>
<TE>   Wright didn't pay much attention to the stained glass being
produced by his contemporaries, Louis Comfort Tiffany and John
LaFarge. Instead he looked east, drawing inspiration from Japanese
design concepts he'd first seen at the Chicago International
Exposition in 1893. "Wright was thinking much more along the lines of
shoji screens," Sloan says.</TE>
<TE>   "Since he was designing for the Great Lakes region, one of the
coldest places in the country, he had to use glass instead of paper.
But he was taking that same concept of the screen, that it's
transparent but is also a barrier. Wright wanted to bring the outside
in, but at the same time he wanted to make a difference between
outside and inside, so you had to have some boundary."</TE>
<TE>   The artfully hued tinctures of color added just enough separation,
simultaneously separating and transmitting the interiors from the
great outdoors. Says Sloan, "If it were plate glass it wouldn't have
been defining enough."</TE>
<TE>   Sloan believes Wright also absorbed the same impulses that
informed the Cubist movement in Europe. "If you compared what Wright
was doing with what Picasso was doing at the same time, it's not that
Picasso was influenced by Wright -- they didn't know what the other
was doing -- but they were both responding to something in the air,
to this modern school of thought."</TE>
<TE>   Besides the abstracted natural forms, more obscure references
inspired some Wright windows, Sloan says. "Many of the patterns are
abstractions of the design of the house itself." Pausing in front of
the Robie House exhibit, she explains, "If you take that window and
set it against the elevation drawing of the house, you not only get
the roof angles but also the same proportional relationship between
the walls and the chimney."</TE>
<TE>   Deciphering the windows has become a speculative parlor game for
some Wright aficionados. Is the red square anchoring the 1912 Francis
Little House window supposed to be Wright's "signature," which he
sometimes used as his homage to the Japanese "chop" mark? Are the
"dancing triangles" Wright used in the 1917 Los Angeles Hollyhock
House windows inspired by the short-lived fad known as
crystallography? And is that an eagle crowning the 1910 chevron-laden
window for the Bradley House?</TE>
<TE>   "Who knows?" Sloan says and laughs. "He didn't give us many clues.
So much has been read into these windows that I try to stand back
from assigning more to them than what he told us."</TE>
<TE>   Energized by wild colors</TE>
<TE>   Sloan walks into the next part of the exhibition and gestures at a
set of wildly incongruous red, white and blue windows he designed for
the Coonley Playhouse in 1911. Reminiscent of Piet Mondrian's work a
decade later, the windows' bright, buoyant circles represent a
radical departure from the strictly rectilinear shapes and
earth-toned palette found in most of his windows. What was that
about?</TE>
<TE>   "You have to look at what he was doing in his life as well as his
architecture," says Sloan, who explains that immediately before the
Coonley assignment, Wright had spent 18 months in Europe with a
client's wife, soaking up avant-garde culture.</TE>
<TE>   "He really was tossing everything out, getting rid of the status
quo, the family, the house in the suburbs, going to Europe. I think
that Wright was somehow energized with these wild colors."</TE>
<TE>   Sloan became intrigued with the stories behind the windows in
1983, when she cleaned two Wright windows for a Christie's auction
while working at a New York stained-glass studio.</TE>
<TE>   "I had to get up close and personal with literally
quarter-inch-by-quarter-inch pieces of glass, row upon row," she
recalls. "I spent hours looking at this glass. Our studio dealt with
Tiffany, with Lafarge, with the modern glass that went into the
National Cathedral. This was completely different. I thought,
interesting! Let's see what I can find out about it."</TE>
<TE>   Free-standing artworks</TE>
<TE>   As it turned out, not much had yet been published on Wright's
leaded glasswork. But in the early '80s, Wright's windows, which in
previous decades had sometimes been sold off in yard sales or simply
demolished, were beginning to be perceived as free-standing objets
d'art.</TE>
<TE>   Spurred by a spending spree by Tom Monahan, the founder of
Domino's Pizza who'd become a big-spending Wright collector, prices
for the architect's windows, rugs and furniture took off. By the
mid-'90s, some Wright windows were selling for six figures, including
the Tree of Life piece, which auctioned for $105,000.</TE>
<TE>   Sloan, meanwhile, had received a National Endowment for the Arts
grant to learn all she could about Wright's stained-glass legacy. She
took 18 trips to the Midwest, studying the windows in the structures
for which they were made.</TE>
<TE>   "It leaves you speechless to walk into one of his buildings," she
says. "I remember in the Martin house, in which all the Tree of Life
windows exist, in this one bedroom there was this series of seven
very ornate windows, one after the other. It really hit me about the
architectural meaning of this glass. They contributed enormously to
these interiors in a very subtle way. Without the windows you don't
get the whole message that Wright was trying to send. He never saw
these windows as autonomous objects.</TE>
<TE>   "And that's probably the biggest ambivalence I have about doing an
exhibition of this sort. We have to show one window at a time."
Exhibitions International, New York, which organized the "Light
Screens" show, devised display modules designed to simulate the
natural elements Wright so adored.</TE>
<TE>   "We know Wright wanted to connect exterior and interior space, so
we begin to approximate that the best we can inside a museum
structure by placing tree branches, lights, fans on the inside of
each exhibit module, so you'd feel when you're looking at this that
you're inside one of Wright's houses looking out," says Sarah Vure,
curator of collections at Orange County Museum.</TE>
<TE>   "Light was God to Wright," Sloan says. "Throughout his life he
wrote about light in such ecstatic language you'd think he was
talking about celestial visions. He saw light as the beautifier of
the building, and glass occupying the same territory as the jewel."</TE>
<TE>   Still, he never regarded his windows as autonomous pieces of art.
What would Wright, who died in 1959 at age 91, think about an
exhibition that isolates the windows from their homes?</TE>
<TE>   "The windows were part of the architecture, yes, but Wright
considered architecture to be the mother of all arts," Sloan says.</TE>
<TE>   "He thought the windows were art in the same way that his
furniture, his rugs and the houses themselves were art. To know that
his glass is in a museum? I think Wright would be thrilled to
pieces."</TE>

<HD>At home and at peace</HD>
<DH>Johnny Cash keeps the albums coming, though his days of
touring are just a memory. It seems illness won't silence the Man in
Black.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Robert Hilburn</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>Maces Springs, Va.</DL>
<LD>John R. Cash was born Feb. 26, 1932, which means a recent Saturday
was somewhere around his 25,800th day on Earth. That he spent most of
that day in a modest, two-story wood-frame house in a quiet Virginia
valley says a lot about the country music pillar and the historic
locale.</LD>
<LD>   Cash and his wife, June Carter Cash, own glamorous estates in
Nashville and Jamaica, but they find special comfort in the beauty
and tradition of this house and this unspoiled valley, both of them
the home to country music's hugely influential Carter Family.</LD>
<LD>   "It comes down to solitude and peace of mind," Cash says, sitting
in a rocking chair on the front porch. "That's something we cherish
now. The phone rarely rings up here.</LD>
<TE>   "We bought this place in the early '80s. June grew up here, and it
has always been her dream to come back here. We make it a couple of
times a year. I wish we could make it more."</TE>
<TE>   It was the inspired mountain music of the Carter Family -- A.P.,
Sara and Maybelle -- that helped lay the foundation for modern
country and bluegrass music in the 1920s. As a boy in Dyess, Ark.,
Cash heard such Carter Family tunes as "Keep on the Sunny Side" and
"Wabash Cannonball" on the radio, and he dreamed of being a singer
himself.</TE>
<TE>   Cash has lived that dream for nearly half a century. He's done
more than anyone since Hank Williams to raise the artistic level of
country music, thanks to his blue-collar tales of human desire and
redemption. Hailed as an influence by everyone from Bob Dylan to
Bono, he has been voted into the country music, rock 'n' roll and
songwriter halls of fame.</TE>
<TE>   Over the years, the Man in Black, as he is known for his trademark
garb, has spent close to 8,000 of his days on tour.</TE>
<TE>   But those days are long behind him. The years have been hard on
Cash, a hellion in his younger days who battled a fierce amphetamine
addiction.</TE>
<TE>   Many assumed Cash's music career was over six years ago when
doctors told him that he had a rare, life-threatening neurological
disorder, but the singer didn't give up. He has recorded three more
albums, two of which won Grammys. The third will be released Nov. 5.</TE>
<TE>   Even after learning in 2000 that the diagnosis was false, he has
continued to suffer from failing health. Cash has been hospitalized
several times for pneumonia, once spending nearly two weeks in a
coma. Glaucoma robs him of much of his eyesight, causing a sometimes
unsteady gait. Asthma leaves him short of breath, requiring him to
take rests during recording sessions.</TE>
<TE>   But his mind remains sharp, and his love of music is still
intense.</TE>
<TE>   "Music is part of my life every day," says Cash, who is warm and
surprisingly shy for someone who has been in the spotlight for so
long. "It's hanging around every morning; sometimes it is with me at
night. June says I was singing a song all last night in my sleep. She
had to shake me."</TE>
<TE>   Cash's voice breaks. "It's the asthma," he says as he reaches for
a glass of water and tries to catch his breath.</TE>
<TE>   In the evening, the Cashes head down the road for a guest
appearance at a weekly barn dance sponsored by descendants of the
Carter Family. Admission at the informal 1,000-capacity amphitheater
is just $4 for adults, and the seating is first-come, first-served.
The building has a homespun touch, with fans sitting on old school
bus seats, church pews and movie theater chairs.</TE>
<TE>   It's the only place Cash performs these days. Janette Carter,
June's cousin, doesn't advertise his appearances because she doesn't
want to put pressure on him if he doesn't feel up to performing. But
word has spread through the county that Cash is appearing, and
there's an overflow crowd.</TE>
<TE>   It's an older audience, and most have followed Cash's music for
years. The room explodes with cheers when he takes the stage, and for
a moment the magic is back. Joined by a three-piece band, Cash opens
with "Folsom Prison Blues," and his rich, deep voice is as strong as
the original recording:</TE>
<TE>   I hear the train a-comin'</TE>
<TE>   It's rollin' round the bend.</TE>
<TE>   And I ain't seen the sunshine</TE>
<TE>   Since I don't know when.</TE>
<TE>   I'm stuck in Folsom prison</TE>
<TE>   And time keeps dragging on ...</TE>
<TE>   Cash isn't a great singer technically, but he's a superb
communicator whose almost conversational vocal style captures life's
everyday search for comfort and salvation with uncommon warmth and
conviction. Even in the most joyous tunes, however, his instrumental
sound tends to be stark, as if reminding us of life's accompanying
hardships.</TE>
<TE>   There are flamboyant touches in his recordings (the mariachi-like
horn lines in "Ring of Fire"), but the trademark sound is a
"chicka-boom-chicka" guitar approach (pioneered by the late Luther
Perkins) that is as steady and self-affirming an amplified heartbeat.
His music is drawn equally from blues, gospel, traditional country
and folk -- woven together, in such songs as "Folsom Prison Blues"
and "I Walk the Line," into a rich tapestry of Americana.</TE>
<TE>   Cash also navigates nicely through Kris Kristofferson's "Sunday
Morning Coming Down," but the shortness of breath shows in places on
"Supper-Time," an obscure country song he recorded in 1958.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the fans are too excited to notice when he misses a word
here and there, but June, looking for any sign of difficulty, sees
what's happening and takes the stage at the end of the number, giving
her husband a rest. After a few minutes, he's back by her side,
joining her in a duet, and the voice has regained its power. The
crowd roars again.</TE>
<TE>   A trademark greeting</TE>
<TE>   There are no address markers identifying Cash's house, so what you
have to do is just turn into one of the long driveways that leads
from the old two-lane road, knowing that if the house doesn't belong
to Cash it will surely be a relative's. Everyone in the area about 15
miles from the Tennessee border seems to be a Carter cousin of some
sort.</TE>
<TE>   The Cashes' house is on a slope at the base of Clinch Mountain,
which means you can't see the faces on the porch from the driveway
below. But the deep, familiar voice tells you immediately that you've
found the right place.</TE>
<TE>   Hello, I'm Johnny Cash.</TE>
<TE>   Well, he really only says, "Hello"; your mind fills in the rest of
the line that Cash used thousands of times to open his concerts and
his national TV show.</TE>
<TE>   The greeting was as much Cash's trademark as his solid shock of
black hair and his black shirt and pants the cotton farmer's son wore
as a symbol of support for the downtrodden and oppressed. But his
hair is now white, and he's relaxing in a khaki shirt-jacket and gray
slacks.</TE>
<TE>   For anyone who remembers his rugged good looks and confident aura,
it takes a moment to adjust to the vulnerability that age has
brought. But Cash makes it easy to get past appearances.</TE>
<TE>   A deeply religious man, he's too aware of his many blessings to
complain about any physical ailments. Besides, in this idyllic valley
whose Shell station is the only sign of commercial intrusion, it's
hard to be downcast about anything.</TE>
<TE>   Cash loves the purity of the mountain music handed down by the
Carter Family, and he feels in touch with that tradition in Maces
Springs. He returns here for cleansing the way some people might turn
to the hot desert air or mineral baths.</TE>
<TE>   After a breakfast of ham, biscuits, scrambled eggs and three types
of homemade jelly prepared by the couple's two housekeepers, Cash is
tired and lies down for a morning nap.</TE>
<TE>   June, energetic at 73, uses the time to show off the valley.
Behind the wheel of the couple's Lincoln sedan, she points out the
places where members of the Carter Family went to school or fished.
She even takes me to the local cemetery to see the graves of A.P. and
Sara Carter, the husband and wife who formed the trio with June's
mother, Maybelle. The wording on their tombstones includes the title
of their most famous song, "Keep on the Sunny Side."</TE>
<TE>   As June, who sang with her mom and sisters in a version of the
Carter Family for years and who is a Grammy-winning recording artist
now working on a new collection, heads back to the house, she marvels
at how the area has retained its character.</TE>
<TE>   "I loved this place, but I also felt there was more outside of
these mountains and I was going to see it," she says. "I went to New
York to study acting, but I eventually went back to music. I remember
first hearing Johnny Cash on the radio, and he sounded so lonesome.
It reminded me of something deep inside of me. It was like there was
a piece missing in both of us, and God put us together and made us
whole."</TE>
<TE>   By the time June gets back to the house, Cash is refreshed and
wants to play a tape with some rough vocals of the black gospel songs
he is thinking about including on his next album. When the tape ends,
Cash picks up an acoustic guitar and starts singing some more songs
in a similar style, and his voice is straight and true.</TE>
<TE>   "As long as I can make records, I'm fine," he says, setting down
the guitar. "After all the years, I don't really miss the road. You
know what a big fun day for me is now? It's when June gets up and
we're both feeling good and we want to go shopping. We'll go to
Wal-Mart and I'll get one of those electric carts and just race
through the aisles. Imagine that being the highlight of your day."</TE>
<TE>   Still, isn't he looking forward to going on stage in a few hours?</TE>
<TE>   He looks up and smiles, "You bet."</TE>
<TE>   Fans lend him a hand</TE>
<TE>   At the barn dance that night, the Cashes take a seat in the
audience after their set to watch the other musicians. Fans surround
them, eager to shake their hands or get an autograph. After one song
they retreat backstage for a few more minutes before leaving the
building.</TE>
<TE>   In the '60s Cash was one of the most charismatic performers in pop
music -- prowling the stage with the nervous energy of a caged
animal. He looked so tough and unapproachable that fans used to step
out of his way as he moved about backstage. After all, he did sing in
"Folsom Prison Blues" about shooting a man in Reno "just to watch him
die."</TE>
<TE>   As he heads down the amphitheater steps on this night, however,
several admirers step forward, helping steady him.</TE>
<TE>   By the time I join them at their house a few minutes later, June
is wearing her robe and eating some corn bread and milk. John is in a
chair opposite her, looking tired. He's got cookies and milk on a
tray in front of him.</TE>
<TE>   He's not happy with his performance, and it brings out some of the
vulnerability that he hadn't shown earlier in the day, when he spoke
about the gospel album as if it were a foregone conclusion he would
make it.</TE>
<TE>   Now he admits he'd worried that his upcoming album might be his
last. He wasn't pleased with some of his vocals on it, and he
wondered if his producer Rick Rubin was losing patience working with
him. The last two albums may have won Grammys, but they didn't sell
much -- a tiny fraction of Rubin's albums with the Red Hot Chili
Peppers and other rock groups.</TE>
<TE>   "I had just finished my last vocal for the record and I shook
hands with Rick and I said, 'It's been fun.' I think it was my way of
saying I understood if he wanted to call it quits.</TE>
<TE>   "But he immediately asked what I wanted to do next. I mentioned
the black gospel album, and then I mentioned an album of songs that
would show my musical roots, and Rick said, 'Let's do them both.' I
was dumbfounded. It was just what I wanted to hear. I had thought I
might finally be at the point where I would only be singing for
myself."</TE>
<TE>   Taking a bet, and winning</TE>
<TE>   It's a sad image, but Cash's story again is his way of extolling
his blessings. After all, he still gets to make records.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier in the day, Cash had told another story, one that perhaps
best summarizes his feelings about all that has happened to him.</TE>
<TE>   Back in 1970, Cash took Michael Nesmith, of the Monkees, on a tour
of his lavish new house on Old Hickory Lake outside Nashville.</TE>
<TE>   "We looked at the house and Michael said, 'I'm glad for you. Shame
you can't keep it.' I asked what he was talking about and he said,
'We can't keep things like that in this business. My bet is you'll
lose this place and this woman because the business is awfully rough
and you're as vulnerable as anybody else.' "</TE>
<TE>   Cash pauses.</TE>
<TE>   "I knew what Michael was saying, but I told him I'd take that bet,
and you know what? I won."</TE>

<LD>Nothing has underscored Johnny Cash's role in raising the artistic
aspirations of country music more than his national TV show, which
ran from 1969 to 1971 on ABC. Rather than load the program with
mainstream faces, Cash recruited performers he admired regardless of
field. His first guests: Bob Dylan and Joni Mitchell. Later guests
ranged from Neil Young and Ray Charles to Merle Haggard and Odetta.
Cash has never lost this adventurism. If the TV show were back, the
first guests might be Bono and Beck.</LD>

<HD>Finding the soul of a horse</HD>
<DH>Bartabas began Theatre Zingaro 20 years ago as an
avant-garde experiment combining animals and dancers. Now it's a
French institution.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Kristin Hohenadel</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL>Aubervilliers, France</DL>
<LD>Each winter, Parisians venture to the ring at France's celebrated
Theatre Zingaro on the outskirts of the city to sit on wooden
bleachers and watch man and horse tangle in a mysterious pas de deux.
Six women in flowing hair and dresses float in on white horses. A
horse charges past, ridden by an owl. Acrobats bound weightlessly off
the bare back of a cantering horse. Dressed in a black cape,
Bartabas, the troupe's straight-backed, 44-year-old leader, perches
regally atop a black stallion that marches in place to the click-clop
of passing time. He chases a black horse through a pool, then the
horse chases him.</LD>
<LD>   Zingaro ("Gypsy" in Italian) is a high-concept mix of music,
movement, theater and art that has been variously labeled equestrian
opera, ballet and cabaret, and its pieces come together like images
from a far-flung dream. The company's 60-odd horses -- among them
Picasso and Goya, Nijinsky and Baryshnikov, Balanchine and Farinelli,
North, South, East and West -- are not one-trick ponies, nor do they
perform with any clowns, mimes or jugglers in what some people, to
Bartabas' dismay, call a traveling circus. The only thing his troupe
has in common with the circus is a ring, Bartabas says, and anyway,
circus is about showing off technique. His work, like all artists',
flaunts emotions. In particular, the spiritual liaison between man
and horse.</LD>
<TE>   "In America, people ask me if I'm a horse whisperer," says the
tall, chain-smoking Bartabas, who talks at a gallop as horses clop by
and scrappy dogs bark at the tops of their lungs. "I don't whisper to
the horses, I listen to them. I'm a horse listener."</TE>
<TE>   His life is his art</TE>
<TE>   It's a sleepy summer morning at the compound where Bartabas works
and lives with his 45-member troupe and their various pets and
relations, in green-and-red-painted caravans. In a nearby pen, a girl
and a horse stretch their legs. A few feet away in immaculate stables
lighted by a chandelier, 20 Portuguese cremolo Lusitanian horses
nibble demurely and shake their sleek blond manes from sky-blue eyes.</TE>
<TE>   "For me, Zingaro is a whole life, it's not a show," Bartabas says,
shifting his long legs in a wooden chair set in an outdoor gazebo.
"You could say that I work all the time. Or that I don't work at
all."</TE>
<TE>   Master of his own stylized bohemian universe, the once-bourgeois
Bartabas adopted this name 20 years ago and started over in life,
creating a singular art form and a lifestyle to match. But what began
as an avant-garde adventure is no longer considered fringe: Zingaro
is now one of Europe's leading theater companies, regularly
premiering new work at the prestigious Avignon Festival and -- as
quirky as it might sound -- it's a French cultural institution that
is more art than entertainment.</TE>
<TE>   When not in France, Zingaro lives up to its peripatetic name,
visiting about seven cities each year. Bartabas prefers to choose
just one city in a country and cultivate an audience there: In Spain,
it's Barcelona; in Switzerland, Lausanne.</TE>
<TE>   The troupe has traveled to the United States only twice before, to
New York's BAM Next Wave Festival with "Chimere," featuring Indian
gypsies from Rajasthan and "Eclipse," a black-and-white piece that
included a Korean singer and Himalayan dancers. Earlier this month,
Zingaro set up camp at the Eclectic Orange Festival in Costa Mesa,
where, through Nov. 8, it is performing "Triptyk," the company's
first foray into the classical music repertory. Twenty-three horses
perform with dancers from Kerala, India, trained in martial arts,
moving to "The Dialogue of the Double Shadow" by Pierre Boulez and
Igor Stravinsky's "The Rite of Spring" and "Symphony of Psalms" in
the 90-minute, three-act piece.</TE>
<TE>   Dean Corey, director of the Philharmonic Society of Orange County,
which organizes Eclectic Orange, first saw Theatre Zingaro in 1986 in
New York and persuaded Bartabas to break his one-city rule and bring
the show to Southern California. "Theatre Zingaro embodies what the
Eclectic Orange Festival is all about," he says, "a melange of world
culture and traditional art in one exceedingly unique and refreshing
package."</TE>
<TE>   Personality is key</TE>
<TE>   Bartabas -- whose own close-cropped skull slopes up to an eerily
equine peak -- is an autodidact who used his early experiences with
horses and street theater to invent a creative process all his own.
First he picks horses for their "personalities." Then he and his
riders find out how the animals want to move and build a show around
that. "Often people have an idea of the performance and choose a
horse capable of doing it," he says. "I do the opposite. I choose a
horse because he pleases me -- for his charm, or, you know, it's
undefinable -- the way he walks or looks. And after, I ask myself
what would be interesting to do with him to bring out certain
emotions or to bring out the best in him. I don't have a preconceived
idea. It's not very original to work like that. That's how Pina
Bausch works with dancers. What's original is to do that with
horses."</TE>
<TE>   He matches people and horses, then leaves them to build their own
relationships. "I choose the human and animal material," he says. "I
don't give courses, don't explain too much. I try to follow my
instincts. I like to take a horse, or a person -- and not just to
teach them technique, but to watch them flower," he says, a process
that takes time. Bartabas travels the world -- India or Korea or
Tibet -- for inspiration, bringing back dancers and musicians to live
on the compound in Paris and make a new work from scratch.</TE>
<TE>   He'll take the process one step further early next year, when he
will inaugurate the Academy of Equestrian Arts at the Grand Stables
of the Chateau de Versailles, once the site of theater and opera
performances under Louis XIV.</TE>
<TE>   Students from 18 to 26, most of them female, will undertake a
two-year course meant to do what he says other riding schools such as
the male-dominated Spanish Riding School in Vienna or the Cadre Noir
in Saumur, France, do not: Develop the artistic sensitivity of riders
by training them in dance, music and singing, movement, cinema,
theater, video, sculpture and plastic arts, martial arts, fencing and
"new age" veterinary practices. They'll perform in a 700-seat theater
that's under construction.</TE>
<TE>   'We don't impose, we propose'</TE>
<TE>   Developing, performing and touring a show takes 2 1/2 to three
years, and once it has run, it is technically impossible to reprise
it, because each show is so tailored by, and to, its riders and
horses.</TE>
<TE>   "That's my rhythm," he says, "and it's dictated by the horses. You
can't force them. We don't impose, we propose. It's a long process to
prepare horses psychologically and physically. A dancer or a musician
can accept to suffer, because he understands the objective. A horse
doesn't understand why, so he can't be made to suffer."</TE>
<TE>   Like all horse trainers, Bartabas dangles carrots before his
horses, but his goal is to get them to move naturally, as if from
their own imaginations. The result looks like a beautifully staged,
perfectly harmonious collaboration.</TE>
<TE>   There is no narrative in a Zingaro piece; Bartabas is less a
storyteller than a conjurer of emotions. "I work the imagination of
each viewer; to put people in a state to receive emotions so that
they can tell their own story," he says. "It's hard to get people to
enter into a different rhythm than the one created by television --
the American rhythm in which you take the viewer by the hand and lead
them nowhere. I'm not saying I'm a genius and if they don't
understand, too bad for them. Unlike television or film or a
painting, my shows only exist for an hour and a half in front of
people at a certain moment. Something has to happen, and if it
doesn't, it's not their fault -- it's my fault."</TE>
<TE>   Bartabas makes keepsake films of all his works -- seven so far --
but he admits there's nothing like a live show. "To me it's all
important: the breath of a horse passing, the smell, the music," he
says. "You have to help people to see details and to appreciate them.
You don't have to please them, but you have to provoke some kind of
emotion -- so that they boo, break the chairs or applaud. But not
indifference."</TE>
<TE>   Some of the horses that traveled to Orange County -- with Bartabas
sleeping by their side in the specially equipped plane -- will move
to Versailles after the Southland run of "Triptyk," which is also an
exercise in mourning for the namesake horse of 18 years that died in
New York on their last trip there. "I try not to have a favorite, but
it's true there was a horse that was a bit the memory of the company,
because he did 18 years of shows," he says of his old horse, whose
ashes he keeps in his caravan. "It's hard to rediscover that same
complicity with another horse; it's not the technique but the time
you spent with them that matters.... What fascinates me is not to
show horses, to give a demonstration, but to show the relationship
between man and the horse. That fascinates me, because the horse for
me is like a mirror. It shows you what you are incapable of giving."</TE>
<TE>   Bartabas says he has learned everything from his horses, but that
doesn't mean he loves them for their minds. "Horses are dumb," he
says, taming a smile. "People are often shocked when I say that. But
if intelligence is the reasoned conscience of what we might have been
put on Earth to do, an animal doesn't have that. But he feels a lot
more than at least the man of today. I think the more man knows how
to explain things, the less he feels. Horses are a lot more sensitive
than we are."</TE>

<HD>When Doris met Doris</HD>
<DH>Seeing similarities between a sitcom mom and his mother, a
reporter sets up lunch, and the topics include ageism, sexism, corned
beef and comedy.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Brian Lowry</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>WATCHING the series prototype for "Everybody Loves Raymond" in 1996,
long before it blossomed into television's second-most-watched
comedy, I was instantly struck by this thought: "Hey, that's my
mother."</LD>
<LD>   The reaction, I am pretty sure, was not unique, and one can argue
that a significant aspect of the CBS show's appeal stems from
people's ability to identify with its situations and personalities --
perhaps none more so than the title character's overbearing mother,
Marie, as played by Doris Roberts.</LD>
<LD>   My own mother, it so happens, is also named Doris. And though she
doesn't resemble Marie in all ways, they overlap in several key ones
-- not the least being that I can't remember ever reaching the living
room of my mother's house (one appropriately enters through the
kitchen) without being asked if I want something to eat.</LD>
<TE>   In addition, a plot point in the first episode involved Raymond
trying to buy his mother a gift by signing her up for a "fruit of the
month" club. Watching it, I recognized the blank look of horror that
greeted some of our more misguided attempts at buying my mother
gifts.</TE>
<TE>   Roberts, I realize, is not Marie, but a gifted character actress
who bounced around Broadway, film and television roles -- including a
stint on the 1980s series "Remington Steele" -- before becoming an
overnight sensation, as it were, in what are now her early 70s.
Outspoken and fearlessly willing to criticize CBS for programs such
as "Survivor" and "Big Brother," she addressed a U.S. Senate
committee in September about ageism in the media, which has become a
personal crusade.</TE>
<TE>   When Roberts' publicist called pitching a story about her, a
sort-of "My Dinner With Andre" concept seized me -- only this meal
would be shared by Roberts and my mother, who lives in the San
Fernando Valley and has become a huge fan of "Everybody Loves
Raymond."</TE>
<TE>   Forget "When Harry Met Sally." This would be "When Doris Met
Doris." If nothing else, I reasoned, putting them together for an
hour would, for me, be cheaper than therapy.</TE>
<TE>   Madison Avenue, it should be noted, doesn't care about my mother's
viewing habits, since she graduated out of the 18-to-49 age
demographic that advertisers covet 30 years ago. Still, Roberts
agreed to come to lunch -- a spread of corned beef, turkey salad,
potato salad and cole slaw from Art's Delicatessen in Studio City.</TE>
<TE>   Although my mother was never part of the entertainment industry
(she worked in the U.S. marshal's office in the 1940s, before she
began having kids), she has always been a huge film buff and someone
who can rattle off the names of Elizabeth Taylor's various husbands
in sequence.</TE>
<TE>   The two hugged when Roberts entered, as if they'd known each other
for years. As the discussion progressed, I was surprised by my
mother's detailed memory of "Raymond" episodes, until I realized
she's been watching the reruns every night in syndication.</TE>
<TE>   Having visited Washington not long before, Roberts began by
recounting her experience there, and how she had told the senators, "
'If you were in my business, you'd be out of a job.' Their eyes
popped out."</TE>
<TE>   "Look, they've got Strom Thurmond in there, propped up. What is
he, 97?" my mother said, while squirting some mustard on corned beef.
Thurmond, the senator from South Carolina, is actually 99.</TE>
<TE>   "The thing that really upsets me is the way in which the media
treats older people," Roberts continued. "Why are we talked about as
old coots, old codgers, old hags, over the hill? That's wrong. They
not only dismiss us, but they denigrate us. There's no need for
that."</TE>
<TE>   "Really," my mother said.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm working, I'm not looking for a job," Roberts said. "I have a
great passion for this subject."</TE>
<TE>   "And you're a good spokesman," my mother said.</TE>
<TE>   "In the last 100 years, the average age of a Nobel Prize winner is
65," Roberts said. "So many people do their best work in their 60s
and 70s; why are we being dismissed?"</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know," my mother said. "There's such an accent on youth
in Hollywood."</TE>
<TE>   Down to the nitty gritty</TE>
<TE>   My mother had a few specific questions. She wanted to know if
Roberts was as good a cook in real life as her character on the show.
"They all sit and drool at everything she makes," my mother noted.</TE>
<TE>   Roberts, in fact, is working on a book titled "Are You Hungry,
Dear?," a sort-of autobiography interspersed with recipes that she
describes as being about "life, laughs and lasagna."</TE>
<TE>   "I was a very good cook," she said. "When my husband died, I
stopped cooking. I thought, 'Why am I cooking for myself?' "</TE>
<TE>   At that point, The Times' photographer arrived.</TE>
<TE>   "Would you like something to eat?" my mother asked him, almost
before saying hello. I had told her about our plans to photograph the
session, but she still wasn't thrilled about the idea.</TE>
<TE>   "I photograph like Grandma Bert," she said, referring to her
mother.</TE>
<TE>   Roberts was just warming up about ageism, even after I pointed out
that broaching the subject generally makes the executives who run the
media business squirm.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't care," she said. "It's something that has to be talked
about. There's no reason in the world for us to be airbrushed out of
existence.""</TE>
<TE>   My mother turned to me. "She's an interesting person, because she
has values, and she has causes she's interested in. This is good."</TE>
<TE>   Roberts, taking a slice of kosher pickle and offering me one, also
alluded to a double standard in terms of women and men. Older actors
still play leading roles and are frequently paired with much younger
actresses, such as Sean Connery co-starring opposite Catherine
Zeta-Jones in "Entrapment." "There's ageism against women, not men,"
my mother said, although she quickly added in regard to Connery,
"He's still got it. He really has." Roberts agreed.</TE>
<TE>   For all her talk about ageism, Roberts had been equally critical
of programs such as "Survivor."</TE>
<TE>   "These shows are awful," my mother said. "I watched about 10
minutes of 'Survivor' one night, with the tom-toms and everything,
and I couldn't stand it. I didn't see any point in it."</TE>
<TE>   "What is the purpose of 'Fear Factor?' " Roberts said. "You can't
even talk about it over lunch."</TE>
<TE>   Roberts then brought up what she called "an incredible
experience," having visited ground zero in New York City with her son
and three grandchildren. The rescue workers presented her a flag that
had flown over the site along with a piece of the first tower.</TE>
<TE>   Roberts, who grew up in New York, was overwhelmed by the gesture
and choked up a bit discussing it. She recalls the workers telling
her, " 'We've been here since 9/11 looking for pieces of our friends.
And we go home and watch television and you make us laugh so much,
you bring us back into life.' There's no paycheck that's better than
that."</TE>
<TE>   "That is really touching," my mother said. "Your son and
grandchildren must have been so proud of you."</TE>
<TE>   Roberts' son, Michael Cannata, is actually her manager. He has
three children, ages 9 to 13. Not long ago, she renegotiated her
contract. Asked if she trusted her son to secure a good deal, she
quipped, "The money's all going to be his anyway."</TE>
<TE>   Stardom is not without its disadvantages. One woman, she said,
asked for an autograph as she exited a plane. When Roberts said she
needed to visit the ladies' room first, the woman followed her inside
and waited.</TE>
<TE>   For the most part, however, she welcomes the attention. "People
say, 'Do you get annoyed when people come up to you?' And I say, 'No,
because they're smiling.' They say, 'Thank you for making me laugh.'
" Roberts recalled meeting a woman with cancer who told her that
watching the show temporarily helps her forget her illness.</TE>
<TE>   "Doesn't that make you feel good?" my mother said.</TE>
<TE>   Plenty of good has come Roberts' way since "Raymond" came into her
life -- an audition she attended reluctantly. She was busy directing
a play at the time and didn't want to go.</TE>
<TE>   "Over 100 women had read for this part already, and I thought,
'They don't know what the hell they want,' because you can't read
over 100 people and not know that somewhere in there was a wonderful
actress," she said. "I just did it off the top of my head, with
whatever instincts I had, and I was right on. It was exactly what
they wanted."</TE>
<TE>   "It's the part of a lifetime," my mother said.</TE>
<TE>   "My name was on that one," Roberts agreed. "All my friends had
read for it. In New York, all of them. They hate me for it."</TE>
<TE>   Roberts has received two Emmys for the show, including one in
September. She also won an Emmy earlier in her career for a dramatic
role as a bag lady on "St. Elsewhere" and said she misses the chance
to flex those muscles, with few dramatic parts coming her way.</TE>
<TE>   Roberts said she still watches the program every week. "I go to
class on Saturday morning, and I learn something every time. That's
what I think keeps me young. Sure, I have bones that ache. Don't we
all? But when people ask why I work so hard, I tell them, 'I'll rest
when I'm dead.' "</TE>
<TE>   "Because you love it," my mother said.</TE>
<TE>   Given the headline dancing in my brain, I felt compelled to ask
how both of them felt about the name Doris, which, I noted, wasn't
among the cool choices bandied about when Rachel had her baby on
"Friends."</TE>
<TE>   "It's true," my mother said. "Doris Day is almost my age: 79.
Everybody else that I know named Doris, there are two or three of
them, are in their 70s."</TE>
<TE>   "Because comedians have made fun of the name," Roberts added. "If
you watch commercials, you hear some old guy say, 'Dor-riss!' "</TE>
<TE>   Clearly, Roberts was comfortable, sharing tales about past
co-stars. By the end, the afternoon became a lunch between two women
born before Franklin Delano Roosevelt's presidency as opposed to a
manicured celebrity interview. My mother has a way of doing that with
people, and I suspect the other Doris does too.</TE>
<TE>   When it was time for Roberts to leave, the two hugged again. My
mother, the one who does not fall into any of the most desirable
demographics, sent Roberts on her way with this wish: "Stay on the
show. I couldn't live without you on Monday nights."</TE>

<HD>Fans still idolize the declining single</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Randy Lewis; Steve Hochman</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The single as a format is dead, and everyone knows it. Just look at
the stats: Sales of singles are down 63% from last year at this time,
according to Billboard magazine, after heading downward for a decade
or more.</LD>
<LD>   So who forgot to tell more than half a million people who've
bought "American Idol" winner Kelly Clarkson's hit "A Moment Like
This" in the last four weeks?</LD>
<LD>   Or all those consumers who have gobbled up more than 300,000
copies of B2K's "Uh Huh" single this year?</LD>
<TE>   "We feel confident there is still a singles market out there,"
says Richard Sanders, executive vice president and general manager of
RCA Records, which put out the Clarkson single and now plans to issue
singles with the other "American Idol" finalists.</TE>
<TE>   "We actually had to overcome the negativity at retail toward the
single configuration," Sanders says. "We asked them not to perceive
it as a traditional single, but to view it as a $5 souvenir from
'American Idol.' "</TE>
<TE>   Some music merchants didn't need any persuading.</TE>
<TE>   "We have been actively petitioning the labels and distribution
companies to reconsider their position on singles," says Sam Milicia,
vice president of the Handleman Co., which provides music to
thousands of Wal-Mart, Kmart and other stores. "They really believe
singles cannibalize album sales. We don't believe that....</TE>
<TE>   "If the [record companies] would support it, we certainly would
support it, and our indications from the customers we service is that
they would support it also," Milicia says. "But you can't have a
singles business without all the hit singles," most of which no
longer are issued commercially."</TE>
<TE>   That's because most record companies much prefer pushing albums
that cost $15 to $18 at retail rather than singles that go for $3 to
$5.</TE>
<TE>   "We have been in a song-driven marketplace for a number of years,
and yet the availability of singles continues to decline," Pam
Horovitz, president of the National Assn. of Record Merchants, told a
conference recently. "When there is no way for the consumer to
purchase just the one song they want, why are we all surprised that
they take advantage of the widely available alternative -- which is a
free copy from one of the various file-sharing services?</TE>
<TE>   "If we want to get kids into the habit of paying for music,"
Horovitz said, "we've got to provide them with a product that they
want at an entry level price."</TE>

<TE>   A rock opera with grit(s)</TE>
<TE>   Rock operas have been with us for decades, but ones examining the
music and mind-set of the South are a rarity. Randy Newman's "Good
Ole Boys" from 1974 wasn't exactly a rock opera, but it's the closest
anybody's come.</TE>
<TE>   Until Drive-By Truckers, that is.</TE>
<TE>   The group's "Southern Rock Opera" has been earning praise from the
Village Voice, No Depression, Rolling Stone and other media. The
two-CD set tells the story of a fictional band called Betamax
Guillotine, modeled loosely on Lynyrd Skynyrd, that sees its career
take off, then end in tragedy.</TE>
<TE>   The group created "Southern Rock Opera" to explore what co-founder
Patterson Hood describes as "the duality of the Southern thing....
The most consistent thing about the South is how contradictory it all
is."</TE>
<TE>   Skynyrd, Neil Young, Bear Bryant, George Wallace and others are
referenced in such songs as "Ronnie and Neil," "Dead, Drunk and
Naked" and "The Three Great Alabama Icons." Drive-By Truckers comes
to the House of Blues on Friday, and will play some of the "Southern
Rock Opera" songs along with newer material and songs from its three
earlier albums.</TE>
<TE>   --Randy Lewis</TE>
<TE>   Searching for Leonard Cohen</TE>
<TE>   Leonard Cohen has been on a spiritual journey for some time,
residing part time at a Buddhist retreat on Mt. Baldy. He also
happens to be a destination on a young singer-songwriter's own
spiritual quest. New York musician Lizzie West, whose major-label
debut will be an EP in November on Warner Bros. Records, made a
cross-country journey shortly before signing to the label, and one of
her goals was to find Cohen.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd put out an album by myself, had a thousand copies and didn't
know what to do, so me and my dog got in the car and headed across
the country playing wherever anyone would take us," she says. "On
that journey I also went looking for Leonard, thinking maybe he could
tell me where to go and what to do."</TE>
<TE>   When she located him at his Los Angeles home, he was actually
expecting her.</TE>
<TE>   "He had gotten word [of our journey] and opened his doors to us
and took us in, and it was amazing inspiration," she says. "He took
us to the Zen Center, and was the source of support I needed at that
time to understand that what I was doing had a place in the culture."</TE>
<TE>   Now West is completing a film, "Holy Road Freedom Songs," shot
along that journey and supplemented with coverage of the making of a
full Warner Bros. album, due in the spring, as well as performance
footage. To thank Cohen, she's recorded one of his songs -- a sly
version of "I'm Your Man," without switching the gender perspective,
for the EP.</TE>
<TE>   -- Steve Hochman</TE>
<TE>   Small faces</TE>
<TE>   Producer Mitchell Froom is working with rootsy Americana band
eastmountainsouth for a debut album due on DreamWorks Records in
February. Froom pal Tchad Blake will handle the mixing, and band
members Peter Adams and Kat Maslich are getting help from musician
and DreamWorks executive Robbie Robertson, who signed the band, and
label chief Lenny Waronker in deciding which of more than two dozen
songs they've written will make the cut for the record. They play at
the Derby next Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   Toad the Wet Sprocket is reuniting four years after the Santa
Barbara alt-rock group disbanded. They'll open for Counting Crows on
Dec. 10 at the House of Blues in West Hollywood and plans several
other California shows in December.</TE>

<LD>Kelly Rowland</LD>
<LD>   "Simply Deep"</LD>
<LD>   ***, Columbia</LD>
<TE>   One of the other members of megastar R&amp;B-pop trio Destiny's Child,
Kelly Rowland scores points for truth in advertising with her debut
solo bow. This 14-track collection (in stores Tuesday) contains no
big insights, but its adept mainstream-pop ruminations on life and
love are surprisingly subtle, with an appealing sincerity that never
turns maudlin.</TE>
<TE>   Abetted by the usual throng of producers and songwriters, along
with guests Nelly and Solange Knowles (yes, Beyonce's younger
sister), Rowland doesn't bowl you over with her personality. But her
fine voice adapts nicely to different settings. She brings an ardent
sadness to the single "Stole," a rock-flavored soul tune about
promising young lives snuffed out; and a believable sense of wonder
to the gently percussive "(Love Lives in) Strange Places." One of
three songs she co-wrote, it reflects on how the right one often
comes along quite unexpectedly.</TE>
<TE>   Rowland deals mostly with romantic hopes and disappointments,
shifting confidently from whispered urgency ("Obsession") to sighing
heartbreak ("Everytime You Walk Out That Door") to breathy come-on
("Make U Wanna Stay"). But she also musters up some attitude for more
dance floor-oriented tunes such as "Dilemma," her propulsively boppy
smash duet with Nelly that reworks the Patti LaBelle '80s R&amp;B hit
"Love, Need and Want You."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Santana lets the guests run party</TE>
<TE>   Santana</TE>
<TE>   "Shaman"</TE>
<TE>   ** 1/2, Arista</TE>
<TE>   Let's face it: The tinkly tune from an ice-cream truck would turn
sensually soulful if Carlos Santana added his scorching guitar and
his band's seductive, pan-Latin rhythms.</TE>
<TE>   So it is in "Shaman" (in stores Tuesday), the follow-up to the
group's Grammy-sweeping, 11-million-plus selling "Supernatural," as
Santana plays musical shaman by sprucing up several routine pop songs
and rescuing some awkward collaborations with his time-tested recipe.</TE>
<TE>   The veteran fret wizard isn't about to tamper with a formula as
super-successful as "Supernatural's," which means guest stars galore
once again. Macy Gray, Michelle Branch, Dido, Seal, Musiq, Ozomatli,
Nickelback's Chad Kroeger, P.O.D. and even Placido Domingo are aboard
this time. Few of the pairings yield real magic, though Santana's
inextinguishable musicality makes it impossible to dismiss any as
wasted efforts.</TE>
<TE>   The gutsy artistic move after "Supernatural" would have been to
refocus attention on the man, his guitar and his band -- that's who
creates the highlights here, the Afro-Cuban "Adouma," "Foo Foo,"
"Victory Is Won" and "Aye Aye Aye."</TE>
<TE>   Instead, Santana sounds like a sparkling guest at his own bash,
often too busy in the kitchen to step out and assume his rightful
role as the life of the party.</TE>

<TE>   Foos' latest: Good, could be better</TE>
<TE>   Foo Fighters</TE>
<TE>   "One by One"</TE>
<TE>   ***, RCA</TE>
<TE>   "All my life I've been searching for something. ... Nothing
satisfies, but I'm getting close," sings Dave Grohl in the rapid-fire
opening of "All My Life," the first song on his Foo Fighters' fourth
album (due Tuesday). Throughout the album he confronts the
frustration of having goals in sight but not quite getting there. And
while that sense has always been the emotional foundation for the
Foos, Nirvana alumnus Grohl has brought new maturity to the subject.</TE>
<TE>   The song "Tired," in particular, trades in the band's muscular
power-punk for a slow-simmering stew of internal conflicts over an
unhealthy relationship. It's more subtly shaded than Nirvana's stares
into the abyss, if less compelling. And Grohl generally lacks
Cobain's essential gallows humor. But it still packs a sting.</TE>
<TE>   The close-but-not-quite frustrations also apply to some of the
music. There's an impressive expansion of the Foos' range with the
staccato rush of "All My Life," the tortured calm of "Tired" and some
nice melodic pop-rock twists in "Times Like These" and "Have It All."
But in other places there's a drift toward arena-rock conventions.
Grohl has proven before that he can set -- and reach -- higher goals
than that.</TE>

<TE>   More hot jams from LL Cool J</TE>
<TE>   LL Cool J</TE>
<TE>   "10"</TE>
<TE>   ***, Def Jam</TE>
<TE>   LL Cool J has been a model of consistency in a genre that
cannibalizes its elder statesmen, eager to replace them. With his
ninth studio album (in stores Tuesday), the Queens hip-hop star again
shows he's got enough edge to satisfy hard-core rap fans and the kind
of jams to hook the more radio-reliant. The single "Luv U Better"
features LL apologizing for his shortcomings and promising to improve
his behavior, while "Big Momma (Unconditional Love)" is a moving
paean to his grandmother, the parental figure in his life.</TE>
<TE>   Even on his softer selections, LL packs his rhymes with the witty
wordplay and imagination that are hallmarks of his work. On "Niggy
Nuts" and "Fa Ha," he flexes a harder side, boasting of his rhyming
skills on the former while warning about falling in love for the
wrong reasons on the latter. "10" is another strong package from one
of rap's most important figures.</TE>
<TE>   --Soren Baker</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Rod sings classics: It had to be him</TE>
<TE>   Rod Stewart</TE>
<TE>   "It Had to Be You"</TE>
<TE>   **, J</TE>
<TE>   At 57, Stewart seems to have reached that career point, familiar
to singers, actors, dancers, etc., at which the traditional
repertoire doesn't seem quite as foreign as it did in their younger,
more exploratory years. The Englishman has flirted with romantic
music of one sort or another over the last two decades. But "Downtown
Train" and "Have I Told You Lately" are a lot closer to the Stewart
roots than the music here -- tunes such as "You Go to My Head,"
"These Foolish Things" and "The Nearness of You."</TE>
<TE>   The principal problem with this collection (due Tuesday) is that
the superficial qualities that have worked so well for Stewart in the
past -- his throaty sound, his minimalist interpretations -- aren't
up to the demands of music that is filled with arching melodies and
subtle lyrics. The way the melody of "The Very Thought of You" was
truncated to fit his voice, the continual dependence on the
mood-setting powers of the talented accompanying musicians and the
predictable similarity of Stewart's renderings all illustrate what
happens when manner and ego are confronted by material that demands
musical maturity and storytelling insight.</TE>
<TE>   --Don Heckman</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In brief</TE>
<TE>   The Donnas</TE>
<TE>   "Spend the Night"</TE>
<TE>   ***, Atlantic</TE>
<TE>   On their fifth album (in stores Tuesday), the girls are still
demanding satisfaction ("Take It Off"), mocking poseurs ("Dirty
Denim"), partying like rock stars ("5 O'Clock in the Morning") and
occasionally almost caring ("All Messed Up"). Only now the
Crue-loving crew's doing it on a major label. Their lean-mean
garage-metal-punk withstands the bigger-budget bulking up, but
suddenly the Donnas sound quite slick next to much of the
rock-is-back-(whatever) class of '02. The group plays the Roxy on
Wednesday.</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Caravana Cubana</TE>
<TE>   "Del Alma"</TE>
<TE>   ***, Dreamer/Warner Latina</TE>
<TE>   If the 1999 debut by this informal ensemble deserved two Grammy
nominations (for best traditional tropical album and best package),
this follow-up deserves to win at least one. The concept is the same:
Top Cuban artists such as pianist Chucho Valdes, flutist Maraca and
the singers of Bamboleo are invited to record in L.A. with a
multiethnic collection of Latin and jazz players under the direction
of producer Alan Geik and musical director Jose Caridad "Perico"
Hernandez. But the result this time is several notches superior, as
are Perico's earthy vocals. This diverse collection of nine original
tunes has luster, depth and a confident sense of identity.</TE>

<LD>Listening fascinates me. Always has. I sometimes make the excuse for
waiting a bit late in the game to start a writing career by saying,
"I just listened for 36 years. Then I started writing it all down."</LD>
<LD>   Some of my most vivid memories of storytelling and compelling
human interaction involve being the wide-eyed, open-eared child at
the table, listening to my elders tell jokes, quote scripture, read
the newspaper, fling accusations, defend opinions, make excuses,

<LD>   My Great-Aunt Bertha saw to it that my mother, growing up in the
hardscrabble coal country of central Pennsylvania, was given
elocution lessons at an early age. Years later, when I was a small
child, Mom and Aunt Bertha would "do pieces" for me. I loved
listening to them. Still do. If you've never heard James Whitcomb
Riley's "Little Orphant Annie" recited to make your eyes pop, your
jaw drop and the little hairs on your arm stand up, let me take you
to a certain assisted-living facility in Boyertown, Pa., where
Great-Aunt Bertha, now 90, needs little prompting to give a private
performance. Just ask the maids.</LD>
<TE>   Listening isn't a passive act. To listen, really listen, takes
effort. The payoff is not always what the listener may have hoped
for. The result may be wonderful. It may be awful. What is heard, or
overheard, may be information that was never intended to land upon
the ears: that insight, that sharp observation, that admission of
guilt. It may be a vindication, or a call to action; it may soothe,
or sting.</TE>
<TE>   The ancient Greeks crowded in amphitheaters to hear myths brought
to life by human voices. In my play, "God's Man in Texas," a preacher
asks to hear God's whisper. The Greeks not only heard their gods
whisper, they could hear them participating in human life, not a bad
reward for spending a few hours at the theater.</TE>
<TE>   A few millennia later, the Elizabethans, presented with the most
sublime use of language in Western drama, understandably referred to
going to the theater as "going to hear a play."</TE>
<TE>   Then, in the late 1800s, brilliant American director and
playwright Augustin Daly broke the centuries-old "stand and declaim"
conventions of acting and brought momentum to the act of speaking
dialogue. Momentum in speech demanded realism in settings and
costumes. Realism became spectacle. Daly put the American West on
stage, with all its buttes, mesas, prairies, rivers and waterfalls.
His Shakespearean forests had trees that dropped leaves and streams
that sparkled. It wasn't enough for his audience to hear the heroine
was in peril; they could see it as Daly actually tied her to the
railroad tracks in "Under the Gaslight" -- the first time that
particular trick was pulled. In 1888, he debuted the use of electric
light on the stage in what must have been an enthralling (and
perilous) "A Midsummer Night's Dream," strapping acid batteries
beneath the fairies' costumes to illuminate lights in their hair and
at the tips of their magic wands.</TE>
<TE>   And audiences no longer said they were going to "hear" a play,
they began to "see" a play.</TE>
<TE>   But the innovations of Daly and his imitators soon became old hat,
as innovations will. Visceral, psychological, realistic acting -- as
evolved from Stanislavsky to the east, and the Group Theatre and
Actors Studio here -- became the innovation. Now we didn't just hear
or see a play, we could "feel" it. The art transcended speech and
spectacle.</TE>
<TE>   Who, or what, is to blame?</TE>
<TE>   Are audiences still listening? What are they doing during the
pre-show announcement to silence pagers and cell phones? Talking?
Where once they whispered, now they shout to their companions during
the play, perhaps to be heard over the assisted-listening devices
plugging their ears. Don't they realize the crumple of cellophane
that sounds so innocuous at home in front of the television sounds
like a helicopter taking off in a theater?</TE>
<TE>   Can we blame it all on television? On the general decline in
civility and generosity between people in public? Was it the '60s? Is
it simply that we compete with shortened attention spans in an age in
which information and conversation are transmitted at the speed of
light? Is that why the form has evolved from the daylong festival to
the five-act, from four acts to three, from two acts to the 75-minute
one-act play?</TE>
<TE>   Have you heard this tale, a kind of theatrical urban legend? Linda
Loman lies across Willy's grave: "I can't cry, Willy." The audience
is involved, the actors are on a roll, the words and emotions build
toward the big "Free and clear, Willy, we're free and clear" ... and
a cell phone rings in the house. The actors don't break
concentration, but they -- and the rest of the audience -- hear the
repeated rings, and, finally, the fumbling to unzip the purse and
remove the insistent phone. Does the phone's owner then turn the
ringer off? No. She takes the call, as casually as if she were at
home in front of the TV. Everyone in the room can hear. "Hello? ...
I'm at a play ... 'Death of a Salesman' ... it's OK."</TE>
<TE>   Director Anne Bogart and her SITI Company developed "Cabin
Pressure," which they called "a play about an audience." A character
in the play, speaking Bogart's own words, suggests, " ... theater is
a form of active culture ... an act of leaning forward as opposed to
leaning back."</TE>
<TE>   The Bogart character continues, "For me, the most thrilling
experiences in the theater have always been ones where I've felt like
I've had a role to play in this room, where something is asked of me
as an audience member, and I have to meet the actors halfway. Because
it's about that, being in the room together, this notion of breathing
common air, and that the relationship between the audience and the
actor is a circular one."</TE>
<TE>   That proposal speaks so profoundly to me because it suggests that
in our room, the theater, listening to one another is a vital
component of the art. The greatest actors aren't necessarily the ones
who just expose the most naked of emotions. Watch Marlon Brando as
Stanley Kowalski in the film of "Streetcar," notice how, after he
howls and whimpers for his Stella, he listens. He needs to hear her
response, and, in his silence, so do we. Imagine witnessing that
moment acted live on the stage, not daring to breathe during that
silence with Stanley, with Brando, with Stella, with the audience.</TE>
<TE>   That's a good example of why the word "pause" can be the most
powerful word in a script. Create a pause, a silence, and you allow
the audience to come in, so that actors and audience and the play all
speak to and listen to one another in the shared silence. The
experience is, I think, a divine communion.</TE>
<TE>   I believe that we come to the theater for that communion -- even
if armed with cell phones and cellophane -- to try to make some sense
of the experience of being human.</TE>
<TE>   Ever since Homo erectus rose to enact the hunt that led to the
kill sizzling over the coals, we've gathered round that fire for more
than warmth or food. When that acting out of the hunt included
imitations of the men and women involved, of the prey, of fear, of
need, of triumph, we -- in the persons of those ancient peoples --
watched, experienced and listened.</TE>
<TE>   I think listening -- listening to one another and to our planet --
is critical now.</TE>
<TE>   We live in times when things shift as violently as the tectonic
plates beneath California: the concepts of security, of who worships
the better God, of how old is old enough to die, of what the climate
should be, of how fast an idea can be shared, of disease and
wellness, of whether it's significant that a chunk the size of Rhode
Island breaks off the Antarctic ice cap -- these concepts are
changing rapidly.</TE>
<TE>   And so we gather round the fire; the Gods speak, Aunt Bertha
recites, Shakespeare spins gold and the fairies twinkle with
never-before-seen illumination. I'm there. You're there. And,
together, we're listening.</TE>
<TE>   (Pause)</TE>
<TE>   We're listening.</TE>

<HD>It's not the most exacting science</HD>
<DH>Cinematic depictions don't always match the reality of
scientific work. What's all this 'mad' business, anyway?</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Vincent H. Resh</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Each year, along with various biology classes, I teach a freshman
course at UC Berkeley called "Science and the Movies." Unlike a
science-fiction film course, we study how science and scientists are
portrayed in cinema. And unlike what most scientists tend to comment
about science-based movies -- whether what is depicted is technically
accurate -- we concentrate on examining the accuracy of the
portrayals themselves.</LD>
<LD>   On the first day of class, I begin by asking students for
adjectives they'd use to describe a scientist. Immediately, more than
80% say "mad" -- as in the archetypal "mad scientist." Other
descriptions include "nerdy," "power-hungry," "naive." Only far down
the list might "idealistic" and "self-sacrificing" appear.</LD>
<LD>   Having been raised watching "The Story of Louis Pasteur," "Madame
Curie" and "Arrowsmith," I did not have these negative images in my
memories of why I wanted to become a scientist. But assuming my
students hold the same views as the general public, what does this
negative depiction say about scientists and their work? If movies are
indeed a celluloid embodiment of our culture's dreams (and
nightmares), a projection of the drives and beliefs of its audience
onto the screen, what do movies tell us about how we collectively
perceive science?</LD>
<TE>   Analysis of such movies, especially ones with scientists as main
characters, reveals one inescapable fact: Science scares us. When
cinema steps into the laboratory, it reflects our anxieties about how
the power of science -- and our perceived lack of control over its
consequences -- can affect our lives. Was there anyone who watched
"Jurassic Park," "Outbreak" or "Deep Blue Sea" who afterward didn't
feel a twinge of "could they really be thinking about doing this?"
Even this summer's hit "Spider-Man" played into our fears -- in this
case, fooling around with genetics.</TE>
<TE>   To be sure, people have always been afraid of science's
possibilities. From condemnations against Galileo to the rise of
technology-shunning Luddites, scientific development has been
questioned, criticized and damned. New discoveries, and their
technological applications, have caused equal parts wonder and dread.</TE>
<TE>   Take the granddaddy of all popular science films, "Frankenstein,"
which presented a conflict that has appeared in almost every science
movie since: the quest for forbidden knowledge and the gradual
unveiling of the Maybe We Have Gone Too Far syndrome. From Pandora's
box in Greek mythology to the forbidden fruit in the Garden of Eden,
tampering with nature's secrets -- otherwise known as "the danger of
playing God" -- is one of Western civilization's most enduring
themes.</TE>
<TE>   "Frankenstein" also introduced the scientist-out-of-control role
through a popular misconception. The monster, brought back to life
with the electrical power of lightning, is not actually called
Frankenstein -- that's the doctor's name. But this subtle name
transfer (as in "Abbott and Costello Meet Frankenstein") equates the
monster's blind brutality with the scientist's relentless quest for
forbidden knowledge.</TE>
<TE>   Later, as movie story lines grew more sophisticated, other issues
were explored. "Island of Lost Souls" (and its remakes as "The Island
of Dr. Moreau") was an early warning of animal rights violations and
vivisectionism. In the 1950s, with the United States clutched in an
atomic arms race and the bombing of Hiroshima and Nagasaki still in
memory, fears of radioactive catastrophes materialized on film.</TE>
<TE>   Who's to blame in creating these calamities? Who else? The
scientists. However, it can get worse when scientists and the
government team up (such as in "Splash" or "E.T. The
Extra-Terrestrial"). With the government's backing, it seems that a
solitary researcher somehow becomes transformed into part of a
sinister swarm of faceless technocrats, indistinguishable from
military agents. In other words: villains.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps no person has ratcheted up fears about
scientists-gone-awry more than bestselling author Michael Crichton.
The common Crichton theme is the scientist engaging in destructive
folly -- myopic lab coats foolishly toying with things beyond their
control. In Crichton's "The Andromeda Strain," the deadly organism is
eliminated despite the scientists' (some of whom were depicted as
coming from Berkeley!) futile efforts, while in "Jurassic Park," the
scientists become victims of their own creations.</TE>
<TE>   Crichton takes genetic engineering, currently the doomsday movie
topic most in vogue, to unsurpassed heights in "Jurassic Park." He
also introduces updated (if erroneous) scientist stereotypes: the
flippant hipster (Jeff Goldblum as the chaos theorist) and --
politically incorrect although it may seem -- the hyper-intelligent
Asian (B.D. Wong, playing the role with geeky intensity), who, even
to today's multiethnic audiences, is meant to personify the brainy
discoverer.</TE>
<TE>   "Spider-Man" had an interesting revisionist twist on society's
fears of what genetics can do. The spider venom that sets the story
in motion in the original comic-book version resulted from exposure
to radiation. In the movie, it was from genetic engineering. (I
wonder whether the remake of "Godzilla" would have been less of a
bomb if the triggering event was switched from France's nuclear
testing in Tahiti to growing genetically modified corn in Mexico.)</TE>
<TE>   Among the changing portrayal of scientists in film is that of
women. Unfortunately, maladjustment and dysfunction still permeate
these female roles, rendering most of them incomplete as worthy
scientists or multidimensional characters on screen.</TE>
<TE>   In the portrayal of female scientists, the best depiction thus far
is Jodie Foster's researcher in "Contact," arguably the most
realistic movie made about the daily struggles a modern scientist
faces. Foster, as feisty and driven Dr. Ellie Arroway, contends with
real issues, both practical and philosophical: getting credit for
discoveries, securing funding for speculative research, determining
our place and relevance in the universe.</TE>
<TE>   Yet, outside of her research, Arroway is personally conflicted --
unable to handle relationships, still grieving over her father's
death. Hence, the "scientist as wayward loner" model is once again
displayed.</TE>
<TE>   In truth, however, real-life scientists aren't much different from
anybody else in movie audiences. Most of us have normal lives with
normal problems. It just happens that our jobs make for good (if
inaccurate) screen fodder, given that American society is obsessed
with technology, scientific development and our future well-being.</TE>
<TE>   For sure, motion pictures will continue to use science as a plot
device, be it ludicrous or plausible. And, for the time being at
least, my students and I will be there to be entertained by them and
to study them. Plus, it justifies sneaking out of the lab to watch a
matinee.</TE>

<HD>Culture being thrown out with the security bathwater</HD>

<AU>REED JOHNSON</AU>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Truth, goes the old saying, is the first casualty of war. But in
America's battle with terrorism, culture may be running a close
second.</LD>
<LD>   The collateral damage is falling hardest on musicians and other
performing artists, many of them from the seven countries -- Cuba,
Syria, Iran, Iraq, Sudan, Libya and North Korea -- identified as
"state sponsors of terrorism" under the Enhanced Border Security and
Visa Reform Act enacted last spring.</LD>
<LD>   The new law requires visa applicants from those countries to
undergo extensive background checks. Men between 15 and 45 are
especially subject to scrutiny. But what began as a legitimate effort
to tighten security after the Sept. 11 attacks is backfiring on many
foreign artists and creating a bureaucratic backlog for the FBI and
CIA.</LD>
<TE>   Caught in the middle are U.S. presenters and agents, who've
already lost tens of thousands of dollars marketing tours that had to
be canceled or postponed. The other losers, American audiences,
aren't just missing out on a chic night's entertainment. What they're
really missing is an enriching and challenging exposure to other
cultures' viewpoints and sensibilities, their ideas about what makes
life spiritual, sensual, righteous or otherwise worth living.</TE>
<TE>   "This goes well beyond money," says Scott Southard, a
Massachusetts booking agent and producer who recently had to abort a
U.S. tour of the Afro-Cuban All Stars, an offshoot of the popular
Buena Vista Social Club. The 20-city tour included a Nov. 14 date at
UCLA's Royce Hall.</TE>
<TE>   Where's the worst fallout? Try Southern California. First, Syria's
Whirling Dervishes of Damascus, devotees of the ecstatic devotional
dance genre grounded in Muslim mysticism, were forced to drop out of
the L.A. World Festival of Sacred Music in September, after being
told their visas wouldn't get processed in time.</TE>
<TE>   Chucho Valdes, the virtuoso Cuban jazz pianist, couldn't get to
Los Angeles on Sept. 18 to accept his award for best pop instrumental
album at the Latin Grammy Awards because the new restrictions held up
his and 21 other Cuban artists' visa applications. Ironically, Valdes
and several compatriots took part in a concert to raise funds for
relatives of police and firefighters killed in the Sept. 11 attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Then Googoosh, the Toronto-based Iranian pop singer, regarded by
many Iranians as an emblem of cultural resistance to that country's
repressive theocracy, had to pull out of a Sept. 28 Staples Center
concert. Two years ago, this legendary fiftysomething chanteuse moved
a sold-out Great Western Forum crowd with a show whose potent
political subtext equaled its star wattage.</TE>
<TE>   No credit for past visas</TE>
<TE>   Cuban artists have been especially vulnerable to the new
restrictions. Among those Angelenos won't be seeing this fall are
Pablo Milanes, founding godfather of the nueva trova popular song
movement of the late '60s, and the Afro-Cuban All Stars. Never mind
that the latter have already toured the U.S. half a dozen times since
1999, along with Europe, Asia and Australia, without sabotaging
anything except the notion that great art can't survive, and thrive,
within intellectually ossified regimes like Fidel Castro's.</TE>
<TE>   From Carnegie Hall to the Carmel Bach Festival to private
nightclubs, shows are being scrapped and performers simply not
booked. Among those reportedly ensnared have been a Yugoslav
classical pianist and a harpist from that well-known terrorist cell,
Norway. No wonder presenters like David Sefton, the British-born
director of UCLA Performing Arts, hardly know whether to cry or
guffaw.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not funny, but there's a kind of dark side to it that you
just have to laugh at in the end," Sefton says. While the
government's "instinct for security is obviously entirely
understandable," he believes that the new regulations are being
applied without regard to an individual artist's personal politics or
past behavior.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not just Cuba," Sefton says. "We've had difficulties
bringing in Swiss, Swedish, Danish, Japanese [artists]. I think
there's been a knock-on effect of all the extra [paper] work, which
means the INS is just grinding much slower these days."</TE>
<TE>   Disturbingly, the cultural drawbridge is being raised at a time
when at least one home-grown performer has been censured for
expressing mildly contrarian political views. The notoriously cranky
alt-country troubadour Steve Earle has been raked over the op-ed
coals for penning "John Walker's Blues," an imaginary interior
monologue by the so-called "American Taliban" that's plainly in the
tradition of classic folk songs about less-than-savory characters.</TE>
<TE>   Two weeks ago, President Bush invoked the Taft-Hartley Act to end
the lockout at West Coast ports, so as to ensure the uninterrupted
flow of sneakers, toys and consumer electronics from China. But the
free flow of foreign-made art and ideas is just as important to the
American Way as the free flow of cheap DVD players.</TE>
<TE>   War will scrap changes</TE>
<TE>   Cultural breakthroughs such as that of Buena Vista Social Club
three years ago have the power to redraw our mental maps of the
world. They bring remote corners of the planet into focus, pry open
closed regimes (like the Soviet Union during glasnost) and diminish
the odds of our being blindsided by whatever the rest of the world is
thinking and feeling. There's more potential danger lurking in one of
those truck-sized cargo containers down at the port than in some
middle-aged Cuban's carry-on congas.</TE>
<TE>   Think this stuff only matters to a handful of Armani-clad
audio-trendies? Think again. Longtime KCRW-FM program host Tom
Schnabel remembers when King Sunny Ade brought Afro-pop to the
Hollywood Palladium in February 1983. "I think every musician in Los
Angeles was there," says Schnabel, evoking the ripple effects of
seeing a live human being performing the music they love. What other
world-beat visionaries are currently tangled up in INS red tape?</TE>
<TE>   State Department officials say they're taking steps to speed up
visa processing, but some performance presenters remain skeptical and
are forming coalitions to lobby for swifter changes. The wildcard is
the looming U.S.-Iraq face-off. "If we are in fact going to be going
to war, our efforts are like spinning our wheels. Because as much as
we want to open the doors, war will close our doors," says Bill
Martinez, a San Francisco attorney who specializes in helping Cuban
artists get visas.</TE>
<TE>   Let's hope these prophesies are misplaced. Because, through no
clandestine motives of their own, art and culture are the best
undercover operatives that an open-minded society like the United
States can have. The more frequent-flier miles they rack up, the
better for everything we value.</TE>

<LD>Sometimes it seems that every dance season is crammed with daring new
versions of war horses: male swans, gay swans, bald swans -- anything
for novelty. However, new versions of old works are scarcely a recent
trend in the dance world. Such repertory classics as August
Bournonville's 1836 "La Sylphide" and the 1895 Petipa-Ivanov "Swan
Lake" adapted and outlived earlier ballets of the same titles, and
today only dance historians know much about their sources.</LD>
<LD>   The newest ballet remakes, created by a generation of mostly
European choreographers, are different: They want audiences to
remember the originals. Many of them prove daring about nudity and
sex. Others put classically trained dancers through deliberately
anti-classical moves to blur the line between ballet and modern
dance. But the biggest change may be their sense of historical
precedent. These ballets build on the past and acknowledge it every
step of the way.</LD>
<LD>   The presence of such forward- and backward-looking works on a
number of American stages this season could well influence our more
insular style of dance drama in the future. But, for now, they
represent a kind of repudiation of the auteur theory in dance, a
declaration that innovation always springs from heritage.</LD>
<TE>   Know the past to remake it</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes the reminders can be very simple: bits of the original
1912 Vaslav Nijinsky pantomime in emerging French choreographer
Thierry Malandain's "Afternoon of a Faun," for instance, or the use
of a classical tutu on bald, contorted male and female swans in
Swedish iconoclast Mats Ek's anything-but-classical "Swan Lake."
Sometimes it can be elaborate, as in the "Moth Maiden" 19th century
parody that British eclectic Matthew Bourne inserts into his "Swan
Lake."</TE>
<TE>   You can find both strategies in Angelin Preljocaj's "Spectre de la
Rose."</TE>
<TE>   Back in 1911, Mikhail Fokine's original "Spectre" -- created for
Sergei Diaghilev's Ballets Russes -- depicted a young girl dreaming
that a rose had turned into a handsome fantasy cavalier. This
situation grows ominous in Preljocaj's version, and another kind of
fantasy coexists with it. On one side of the stage, the controversial
45-year-old French choreographer creates a slow-motion rape duet,
dominated by a strange rose-covered male. Meanwhile, on a stage
within a stage, dancers in fancy dress parody antique classical
conventions as if they were ballet automatons. It's an update, all
right, and it incorporates moves from Fokine, but, like much of
Preljocaj's work, the mix is intended to be unsettling.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a dark part in sexuality," he says, "and it is not
usually shown in dance because of the idea of the beauty of the body
and the emphasis on love stories."</TE>
<TE>   He admits that it can be dangerous to impose his own ideas about
sex on a ballet from a more conservative age, especially a ballet
considered a masterpiece, "but it's also exciting. My work is really
about contemporary [movement] research, but I like to show that I am
the child of those who came before me. I believe you have to know
what has been done before -- even to destroy it. If you don't know,
you can do nothing truly new, only accidental repeats of what you
haven't seen."</TE>
<TE>   In his "Spectre," Preljocaj says, Fokine has been "remixed to
express movement at the beginning of the new century. Like now in
music you can take some samples and compose a new piece. I think the
most important thing for an artist is to give the taste of a new
period in the history of art."</TE>
<TE>   Preljocaj's other remakes include "Les Noces," "Parade" and, most
recently, "The Rite of Spring" (which his company will perform at the
Irvine Barclay Theater on Friday and Saturday) -- works, like
"Spectre," that allow him to pay tribute to the Ballets Russes.
Preljocaj calls it "the first contemporary dance company in history.
Because they worked like us. Diaghilev took young people completely
unknown like Picasso and Stravinsky and today their works are
considered the greatest masterpieces of the age."</TE>
<TE>   "It's the same today, and what I want to say to the audience is,
'Just be careful, be awake, because maybe right now there is some
other new masterpiece of contemporary art being born.' And it can be
very nice to be there at that moment."</TE>
<TE>   Thierry Malandain is the new kid on the remakes block, at least to
American audiences. His Ballet Biarritz has thus far appeared only in
Florida and makes its New York debut next month. Malandain, 43, has
not only created his own Ballets Russes tributes -- versions of
"Spectre," "Bolero," "Afternoon of a Faun" and "Pulcinella" -- he ran
a two-week Ballets Russes festival in Biarritz, France, a month ago
where you could have watched four choreographers' versions of
"Spectre," including Fokine's.</TE>
<TE>   Malandain's "Faun" takes Nijinsky's 1912 dance and expands on it.
In the original, a flirtation with a nymph creates a longing in the
faun that he transfers to a scarf she has left behind. In the
ballet's final moment, he masturbates into it, a sequence that caused
a scandal at the premiere in Paris and was censored in New York. But
that was then.</TE>
<TE>   Today Malandain's faun starts the ballet by licking the length of
his arm, and from there the sense of self-intoxicated desire never
stops. At the end, he plunges deep into a giant box of paper tissues
-- the nymph's scarf gone disposable -- as if his whole body has
become one consuming ejaculation.</TE>
<TE>   Malandain says he made the faun a kind of abstract portrait of
young, wild Nijinsky. "It is very representative of his sensuality,"
he says, "and also when he was a teenager, he was a bit autistic, and
so the movement is like that." He calls the ballet "a link to the
soul of Nijinsky. It's my own creation but it keeps the spirit of
Nijinsky alive."</TE>
<TE>   Such a link is crucial, in his mind. "In France, we are very good
about creating things," he explains, "but afterward we lose them --
like 'Giselle,' which we lost and came back to us from Russia after a
century. That's a very French specialty: always demanding the new,
the new, the new and losing the culture, the memory of history.</TE>
<TE>   "So in these new versions of the classics, we can make the history
of dance come alive again and not try to pretend that the art of
dance begins with us."</TE>
<TE>   Inviting the viewer to see anew</TE>
<TE>   To Mats Ek, remakes offer the opportunity to make audiences
reconsider everything about a ballet classic. "All those old stories
are dealing with hard stuff," he says, "love and death, revenge,
madness, whatever -- but maybe wrapped up in a cliche world. It's a
challenge to try to take it all seriously: to make it urgent again."</TE>
<TE>   Ek, 57, thus put mad Giselle where the insane usually belong: in
an asylum. He also made Aurora in "The Sleeping Beauty" into a drug
addict and in his "Swan Lake," which was danced this weekend at UCLA
by Sweden's Cullberg Ballet, decreed that the flawed, lovelorn Prince
ends up with impure Odile, instead of the swan queen Odette --
contrary to traditional versions.</TE>
<TE>   "The white swan Odette represents a dreamlike ideal," he says,
"and I made a conscious choice that he goes toward the black one, who
in my version somehow represents the dirty reality, the only true
possibility of moving forward, even if it's mixed with problems and
unease."</TE>
<TE>   However, Ek made a point of invoking classical tradition when it
came to the tutus. " 'Swan Lake' is so extremely attached to the
image of classical ballet, and the tutu is such a fantastic piece of
costume," he says, "that I thought putting it on a bold, naked body,
without toe shoes, would make the tutu look as strange as it is in
fact. "</TE>
<TE>   Ek insists that "each piece is, in a sense, a world of its own and
is meant to work by itself even if there are intertextual connections
that I cannot help being experienced."</TE>
<TE>   "I know that some of those who know the classical 'Swan Lake' will
get refreshment from my version and others will get upset and find it
grotesque. When I try to do a piece based on a classical ballet, I
try to make it function as logically as possible. And I believe my
'Swan Lake' is as beautiful as the old one. It's just that I have
another point of view about what's beautiful."</TE>

<KH>DAVID SHAW / MEDIA MATTERS</KH>
<HD>California series will be played on New York time</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID SHAW</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Here we go again.</LD>
<LD>   The World Series is underway, featuring two teams from California,
and yet, once more, the scheduling of the entire series is geared to
please the Only People Who Really Matter: the East Coast television
audience.</LD>
<LD>   Telecasts of every game in the series will start at 5 or 5:30 p.m.
in the West -- because that's 8 or 8:30 p.m. in the East. Prime time
on the East Coast, drive time on the West Coast.</LD>
<TE>   That's the way it's been ever since baseball shifted its annual
showcase event from the daytime (when God and Abner Doubleday meant
for baseball to be played) to prime time (where mammon and Madison
Avenue decided it would be more profitable).</TE>
<TE>   Never mind that most hometown fans of the Anaheim Angels and San
Francisco Giants will either be at work or driving home when the
games start. Never mind that California is the largest state in the
union and that the teams are based in two of the country's five
largest television markets (Los Angeles is No. 2, San Francisco is
No. 5).</TE>
<TE>   Never mind, even, that this year's World Series is being televised
on Fox, itself based in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   None of that matters. What matters -- all that matters -- is that
the all-important East Coast audience (and especially the New York
audience) be able to see these games at a time convenient to them.</TE>
<TE>   Fox's stance on the matter</TE>
<TE>   Fox insists this is not the case. (Of course, to get the official
Fox explanation, I had to call the sports division's New York office
if I wanted clearance to talk to the president of Fox Sports, who's
here in Los Angeles.) The timing of the series is intended "to
maximize the audience nationally," Fox New York says, just as all the
networks try to maximize the audience nationally for all championship
sports events. "Not too many people would be available to watch or
willing to watch if it started at 8 in Los Angeles -- 10 o'clock in
the Midwest and 11 o'clock in the East," Fox says.</TE>
<TE>   True. And both Fox and major league baseball were justifiably
hammered two weeks ago, when the first National League playoff game
between the St. Louis Cardinals and Arizona Diamondbacks started at
8:06 p.m. in Phoenix, which was 10:06 in St. Louis.</TE>
<TE>   But if the World Series started at 6:30 in Los Angeles, that would
be 7:30 Mountain Time and 8:30 in the Midwest. Fans in three of the
four time zones -- and seven of the 10 most populous U.S. cities --
would get the games in prime time.</TE>
<TE>   Not in New York and on the rest of the East Coast, though. They
wouldn't get the games until 9:30, which means fans there would
probably have to stay up past midnight to see games through to the
end. That's certainly not ideal. But for a World Series involving two
West Coast teams, it seems preferable to -- fairer than -- depriving
many West Coast fans of the first several innings of each game.</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately, in any "Who loses/gets inconvenienced/deprived"
battle between East and West, the mind-set is such that even when the
decision-makers are in Los Angeles, the winner is always
foreordained: New York, New York -- so pretty and nice, they named it
twice.</TE>
<TE>   Fox notwithstanding, the people who make most of the important
news-media decisions in this country (like those who run major league
baseball) live and work in New York. The people who run CBS, NBC and
ABC -- not to mention the New York Times, Wall Street Journal,
Associated Press, Time, Newsweek and virtually every other major
national magazine and book publishing company -- are based in New
York.</TE>
<TE>   They lunch together and party together and summer together and do
business together. They read New York newspapers and listen to New
York all-news radio stations and watch New York television stations.</TE>
<TE>   That's why New York sports teams that win championships are
lionized in the national media, and books about them come pouring out
faster than you can say George Steinbrenner. That's why, when Pat
Riley was leading the Los Angeles Lakers to all those NBA
championships, he was often derided in the New York-based media as a
lucky pretty boy, but when he took over the New York Knicks, he
suddenly became a coaching genius.</TE>
<TE>   No seeing past the Hudson</TE>
<TE>   The myopia of the New York-based media extends far beyond sports.
It helps explain why New York mayors, governors and senators --
Hillary Clinton, Rudy Giuliani, Mario Cuomo, Nelson Rockefeller --
are seen as almost automatic contenders for the White House, while
mayors, governors and senators elsewhere are most often seen as,
well, mayors, governors and senators.</TE>
<TE>   Although New York is the epicenter of the media myopia, as indeed
it is of everything that matters in life, the media echo chamber
actually extends north from Washington, D.C., through New York, to
Boston, thus encompassing the most powerful people in the country
(the politicians who make war, make laws and collect taxes) and the
smartest people in the country (those in and around Harvard, MIT and
the other campuses in the city that likes to think of itself as "the
Athens of America").</TE>
<TE>   Thus, the sniper in the suburbs of Washington, like New York's
"Son of Sam" before him, has received far more national media
attention than such Southern California serial killers as "the Angel
of Death," "the Hillside Strangler or "the Skid Row Slasher."</TE>
<TE>   But it's New York itself that dominates the media's consciousness.
Last Tuesday's New York Times, even in the national edition available
in Anaheim and San Francisco, among many other cities, featured a
Page 1 story on the New York teams that were not in the World Series.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, the story lamented the disaster that seems to have
befallen all of New York's professional sports teams -- "the city's
sense of sporting desolation," as the story put it -- even though one
of the teams mentioned (the basketball Knicks) have yet to start
their season, two others (hockey's Rangers and Islanders) have barely
started, and two more (football's Jets and Giants) are less than a
third of the way into their season.</TE>
<TE>   Next thing you know, while the Angels and Giants are battling in
the World Series, Time will have a cover story, CBS will do an
hourlong program and Random House will announce plans for a new book
-- all on the failure of the Yankees and Mets to make the World
Series and how this is a national tragedy of Shakespearean
proportions.</TE>

<HD>Simon says 'Alagazam' to Gang</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Don Shirley</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"I was astonished," said Adam Simon, describing his first impression
-- in 1985 -- of the Actors' Gang.</LD>
<LD>   Simon's latest collaboration with the Gang's artistic director Tim
Robbins, "Alagazam," opened Friday at the Gang's Hollywood theater.
But its origin goes back to that day in 1985.</LD>
<LD>   The not-yet-famous Robbins, the Gang's co-founder and benefactor,
met the then-23-year-old Simon -- who had just arrived in L.A. to
attend graduate film school at USC -- at a party and invited him to
watch the Gang improvise the following morning.</LD>
<TE>   Arriving at the Gang's downtown loft slightly hung over, Simon
recalled, he found two actors doing a fight scene, "but they weren't
using swords or Kazan-style fisticuffs. It was like seeing a Tex
Avery or Chuck Jones cartoon come to life. They were being everything
-- the weapon, the blood, the effects.</TE>
<TE>   "They seemed to be reborn vaudevillians, as if they would be at
home in a W.C. Fields or a Jimmy Cagney movie. There was a direct,
spontaneous connection to that raw, anarchic strain of popular
American culture."</TE>
<TE>   Simon had studied that side of Americana at Harvard, and he felt
right at home. He dug up a short story he had written when he was
about 15, and soon he and Robbins turned it into a play, "Slick Slack
Griff Graff."</TE>
<TE>   The Actors' Gang presented it for only three performances at the
tiny Wallenboyd, a now-defunct performance center in downtown L.A.,
but it enjoyed a longer run in Chicago. It became the first of three
Actors' Gang collaborations between Robbins and Simon. The next two,
"Violence" and "Carnage," added daringly original work to the Gang's
L.A. reputation, which had been established with rough-edged
revivals.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the Gang's devotees never saw "Slick Slack." But
"Alagazam," which is a "20% rewritten" version of "Slick Slack,"
Simon said, will give them a glimpse of this seminal work.</TE>
<TE>   "Alagazam" is set within a traveling medicine show in a fictitious
version of the '40s, one in which "some apocalyptic event like
Hiroshima recently happened here in the Midwest," Simon said.</TE>
<TE>   The play was "the least realized" of the Robbins-Simon
collaborations, Simon said, tempting them to try again.</TE>
<TE>   Robbins cited other reasons to revive the piece. The Gang "has
been doing some pretty heady stuff, and a lot of people just want to
cut loose." Also, much of "Alagazam" is "about war and its aftermath,
the neutralization of dissent, and what happens when entertainment
becomes a distraction rather than a visceral communal experience."</TE>
<TE>   Simon agreed. "As we started to revive it, we started to feel the
resonance of these people being nervous and depressed about a recent
disaster that may happen again. It's about the sacrifices people are
willing to make in response to fear."</TE>
<TE>   Lest all this sound too calculatedly arty, let the record show
that Simon's first post-USC gig was making Roger Corman movies like
"Brain Dead" and "Carnosaur," which Simon described as "undoubtedly
the greatest dinosaur movie ever made for $800,000."</TE>
<TE>   Simon's affection for popular showmanship was evident during the
rewriting of "Alagazam." He could hardly stop writing new grifter
pitches during the rewriting process, Robbins said. "He's a
reincarnation of an old-style grifter -- by way of Harvard."</TE>

<HD>The batons are being passed; now what?</HD>
<DH>Some of the most influential orchestras in the world have
new conductors. Only time will tell if we are truly at a watershed
moment.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In two short weeks in September, revolutionary regime change spread
through the classical music world.</LD>
<LD>   Simon Rattle ascended the Berlin Philharmonic throne with the
Ecstasy-laced "Asyla," by the brilliant, provocative young English
composer Thomas Ades. A day earlier in London, Antonio Pappano
stormed the staid Royal Opera, making his first appearance as its
music director with an edgy, erotic production of Strauss' "Ariadne
auf Naxos."</LD>
<LD>   The following week in America, Lorin Maazel lorded over the
contentious New York Philharmonic with John Adams' "On the
Transmigration of Souls," a profound meditation on the World Trade
Center attack. At the Cleveland Orchestra, Franz Welser-Most leaped
upon his first season with a pre-opening gala that included the
premiere of Marc-Andre Dalbavie's Frank Gehry-inspired "Rocks Under
the Water," even if his first night, devoted to Haydn's "Creation,"
was more traditional.</LD>
<TE>   These are exciting times. Young conductors are actively sought.
Progressive leaders wait in the wings in Boston, Philadelphia and
Minneapolis. Elsewhere, the hunt is on.</TE>
<TE>   There has been a generational shift. Rattle, Pappano and
Welser-Most are in their 40s; Maazel, 72, is the exception, but he
gets "radical change" points for being the New York Philharmonic's
first American music director since Leonard Bernstein.</TE>
<TE>   At their opening concerts last month, the mood ranged from guarded
optimism (New York) to outright elation (Berlin). In fact these four
music directors have been greeted not just as fine musicians but as
saviors.</TE>
<TE>   The much ado over Rattle is a good example. Berlin last month was
plastered with gigantic posters showing the curly-haired, fashionably
dressed British conductor looking almost like a rock star. As if a
new day dawned, the newspaper Die Welt welcomed "Sunny Sir Simon."</TE>
<TE>   All this giddy change is partly coincidence; music directors come,
and they go. But a new century also generates a new zeitgeist, and
that surely motivates managements, some of which have gently or
not-so-gently eased out aging, long-standing conductors.</TE>
<TE>   And these are turbulent times for classical music institutions. We
read of new financial troubles almost daily. The Chicago Symphony,
Philadelphia Orchestra, Cleveland Orchestra and San Francisco Opera
have posted significant deficits for the first time in years;
symphonies in St. Louis, Toronto and Pittsburgh have lately tottered
on the verge of bankruptcy. There is belt tightening across the
board, cancellations of operas and even a few outright closures, such
as the poorly managed San Jose Symphony.</TE>
<TE>   None of this, however, implies an artistic crisis for classical
music as much as it does an economic one for top-heavy institutions
with enormous budgets. Predictably, ticket sales and donations have
slowed since Sept. 11. American institutions are vulnerable to the
weakened performance of their endowments; European ones suffer from
reduced government subsidies. Anyone with anything to sell competes
for the youth market, and classical music fantasizes about its share.</TE>
<TE>   Still, there are encouraging signs. Audiences are returning to the
theaters; attendance is up at the Los Angeles Philharmonic, and there
is a three-year waiting list for subscriptions to the Berlin
Philharmonic. One might be cynical about the quest for fresh blood,
fresh ideas, fresh sounds, fresh energy, younger faces for the
marketing departments to work with. But given that classical music
has historically fought change, its sudden embrace of evolution, its
acknowledgment that classical music will not always be the same music
played the same way by the same sorts of musicians for the same sorts
of audiences, does at least suggest that it is no dinosaur.</TE>
<TE>   Berlin, the most closely watched orchestra, should be a good test
of just how much change is possible or useful. In its three decades
under Herbert von Karajan, it was generally regarded as the world's
best, if blandest, band. Most of the ensemble polish was retained
under Claudio Abbado's 13-year, cautiously modernizing leadership,
which also included a turnover of half the players.</TE>
<TE>   But Rattle, who has had the most meteoric rise of any conductor of
his generation, has far greater ambitions. He wants the orchestra to
do everything and be everything. His first season ranges from playing
early music under period-instrument specialists to initiating
out-reach programs to the schools.</TE>
<TE>   "We can no longer play the aloof and glamorous diva in Berlin,"
Rattle told a German newspaper. So, amid the Mozart, he is spending
his first weeks in Berlin with Mark Anthony Turnage's angry hourlong
jazz score "Blood on the Floor" and Bernstein's musical "Wonderful
Town."</TE>
<TE>   But there remain real-world obstacles. The orchestra depends on
$20 million from the city, which embroils it in Berlin's tangled
local politics. And Rattle and these splendid musicians don't play
Bernstein on the same level as Beethoven.</TE>
<TE>   But Rattle is in the best position of any conductor anywhere to
attract young listeners while continuing to maintain the glorious
tradition of this orchestra . If he succeeds -- and it has been
inspiring to witness the ample reserves of goodwill from audiences
and the media -- then the ramifications of this will travel
throughout the musical world.</TE>
<TE>   Unwelcome press</TE>
<TE>   In New York and Cleveland, however, there are a few doubts. The
local press has been unkind to Maazel, pointing out that he is a
contemporary of the outgoing Kurt Masur and drawing attention to his
arrogance and willful interpretations. On the other hand, at 42,
Welser-Most is thought too young and inexperienced for an orchestra
left in sterling condition by Christoph von Dohnanyi's 20-year
stewardship. But then Maazel was Welser-Most's age 30 years ago when
he began his own 10 years as music director in Cleveland.</TE>
<TE>   Thus far both conductors have shown their detractors wrong, or, at
best, only partially right. Maazel can be eccentric, and egocentric,
as he was in his lurching, highly mannered if virtuosic opening-night
reading of Beethoven's Ninth Symphony. He can also be daring and
responsible, as he was with the audacious Adams premiere.
Welser-Most's more conventional account of Haydn's "Creation"
demonstrated warm, first-rate musicianship and the ability to win
over orchestra and audience.</TE>
<TE>   In London, Pappano has shown that he will be an unusually hands-on
opera music director, getting involved in artistic decisions to a
much greater degree than his predecessor, Bernard Haitink. Pappano's
"Ariadne," an extremely smart production of an opera about overcoming
the problems of putting on opera, was the perfect start. From stage
director Christof Loy's riveting Euro-trash parody to an exceptional
cast (highlighted by Thomas Allen's slatternly Music Master, Marlis
Petersen's sexy Zerbinetta and Sophie Koch's gorgeously sung
Composer) to sparkling orchestral playing, this was opera that worked
on every level.</TE>
<TE>   Not all change is revolution, of course. Masur now reigns over
orchestras in London and Paris; the Boston Symphony's Seiji Ozawa
begins next month at the Vienna State Opera. The West Coast,
meanwhile, with Michael Tilson Thomas in San Francisco and Esa-Pekka
Salonen in L.A., has been ahead of the zeitgeist game for some time.</TE>
<TE>   But in visits to Berlin, London, Cleveland and even New York, the
sensation of momentum was unmistakable. And maybe, just maybe, there
is no stopping it.</TE>

<HD>'The 1900 House' didn't go far enough</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Who knew it would be PBS that would set off an escalating game of TV
one-upmanship in the historical "less modern convenience is more"
category? And who knows where it'll end?</LD>
<LD>   The trend-ette started innocently enough in 1999 when public
television -- picking up a program from Britain's Channel 4 --
launched the historical reality genre with "The 1900 House," the
so-called reality show masked as an education miniseries. It was
informative and fun, and viewers by the millions tuned in to see the
Bowler family struggle to adapt to the harsh demands of living in a
Victorian-era flat in London with none of the modern conveniences.
The show was a sensation, or at least as much of a sensation as
viewer-supported television tends to generate.</LD>
<LD>   Not to be outdone by the Brits, PBS created "The Frontier House,"
which aired earlier this year. This time the challenge was tougher:
Three families had to live like homesteaders in 1883 Montana. Now
there were inter-family dynamics, and the participants not only had
to live in old-style houses, they had to build their own.</LD>
<TE>   Next? If you think not having dish or laundry soap in the
Victorian house was hard, and enduring the harsh Montana winter with
no indoor plumbing was a challenge, just try life on a mid-18th
century tall ship.</TE>
<TE>   That's the setting for the History Channel's venture "The Ship,"
which aired this past week, in which 40 men and women were crew on a
re-creation of Capt. James Cook's ship, the one that brought the
first Europeans to Australia. Out at sea, food was always scarce,
water was precious, the work was grueling and as for diversions,
well, there are only so many sea chanteys one can endure.</TE>
<TE>   For next season, we foresee one of the well-meaning networks
offering "The Medieval Castle," in which contestants would endure the
plague, the rack and the Inquisition. Ouch.</TE>
<TE>   And, perhaps for 2005, one brave network might offer up the
ultimate: "The Caveman Cave." One lucky family would get the chance
to live the full Fred and Wilma experience, sewing their own
loincloths out of animal skins, hunting and gathering for food and
felling a giant elephant with a spear they honed themselves.</TE>
<TE>   It's bound to happen -- that's just how TV works. PBS, take it
away....</TE>

<LD>What scares you more? A friend was asking. Was it the shocking loss
of innocence on the shores of paradise in Bali? Or the dread of a
serial killer who could brazenly circle our nation's capital?</LD>
<LD>   Oh my, oh my. Every day is Halloween, the whole world crawling
with deranged goblins.</LD>
<LD>   Actually, if I was rational about danger, I'd be far more worried
about the 228 gang murders that occurred in Los Angeles in the first
seven months of the year -- 61% of all homicides in the city,
killings that took down plenty of random innocents as well as those
targeted, who may or may not have been innocent themselves.</LD>
<TE>   "Mama, how come Daddy was killed?" Small headlines for a big
question.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps I could slink into a corner and draw up my knees at the
horror of the daily commute. Extrapolating from past years, we can
calculate that about 34,000 Americans have randomly perished on the
highways so far this year, give or take. And 7,362 or so of us have
been killed in accidental falls -- as in falling off ladders or out
of bed or slipping on banana peels. About 400 of us have died so far
in 2002 from nothing more sinister than eating hot dogs, sub
sandwiches and cheese contaminated with listeria. An additional 250
have drowned in the bathtub, and 50 or so people have been violently
cut down by wasps and other venomous creatures.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, we aren't rational about these things. And now that the
Information Age has locked horns with the Age of Terrorism, it seems
we're getting less so all the time.</TE>
<TE>   A while back, Americans could wring their hands because their
nation had become too callous. Now, if we'd only take a deep breath
we would see that we're too callous and too fearful at the same time.</TE>
<TE>   Terrorism in its many forms, whether school shootings,
shopping-center shootings, far-off truck bombings or poison-by-mail,
is not just a physical danger but also a rising threat to our mental
composure. Lately, I've found myself in any number of macabre
conversations in which people seem to have slipped their moorings
entirely.</TE>
<TE>   I suspect there's a good chance we'll drive ourselves nuts long
before the maniacs get us. If one was to correlate demographic trends
with the headlines, we can imagine a future in which our children
will miss out on the enjoyment of ever-increasing life spans because
they'll spend all of their days worried about being killed.</TE>
<TE>   There is temptation here to rant against television news for
ginning up our blood pressure. Purely as an experiment, I broke my
solemn pledge and turned on cable news for one whole day. But you
know where this meditation might lead. TV is a tired old mule to
lash. If you cannot bear to thumb the off switch, you probably
deserve the mental breakdown that all-news cable is ever more intent
on delivering.</TE>
<TE>   And I don't mean to let my own end of the news business off the
hook either. Novelty is one thing, but increasingly I wonder what
happened to the old goal of trying to put the world into perspective
for people?</TE>
<TE>   The military was called out in the hunt for the Washington-area
sniper. Legions of shrinks were prettied up with pancake to face the
cameras and tell us how to hold our families together, providing
"balance" to the programming determined to see us fall apart.</TE>
<TE>   And when, inevitably, journalists recognized they had laid it on a
little thick, then over-coverage became another development in the
story to cover. Clever, eh?</TE>
<TE>   The consequence of this kind of attention and the resulting
anxiety contagion is self-evident. Terrorists prosper and multiply.
The whacked-out homicidal loonies we grow at home, as well as those
berserk religious fanatics that come at us from abroad, simply cannot
kill enough of us -- not with anthrax in the mail, random bullets,
hijacked airplanes or vehicles stuffed with explosives. They cannot
move events by carnage alone. They need our help. They have to count
on us to lose our heads.</TE>
<TE>   That's the victory they seek.</TE>

<LD>So far only a few tactless Republicans have tried to attack those
Democrats who voted against the congressional resolution granting
President Bush a free hand to deal with Iraq, including a preemptive
military strike if he deems it fit.</LD>
<LD>   But the most egregious instance of someone in the GOP trying to
make political hay out of the somber debate on Capitol Hill regarding
Iraq involves 15 members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus who
voted against the resolution. It was so off the wall that it merits a
rejoinder.</LD>
<LD>   Last week, an e-mail made the rounds among Latino activists that
blasted the 15 Latino Democrats who voted against the Iraq
resolution, a group that includes all six Latino Californians in
Congress and four of six Latino representatives from Texas.</LD>
<TE>   The e-mail, which reached many of its recipients from a user
account in the White House, slammed Latino Democrats for not
supporting the many Latinos in the armed forces. "If they have a
defense for their actions," it stated, "they should deliver it to the
kids in uniform."</TE>
<TE>   Harsh words, and they stirred an immediate backlash among Latinos,
who take particular pride in their military contributions to this
country.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration, which has worked hard to cultivate Latino
political support, immediately disavowed the missive, saying it was
written by a GOP activist who forwarded it to Washington. It was then
"mistakenly" sent to Latino leaders by a White House intern.</TE>
<TE>   I can verify the first half of that explanation because I was
among those who got the e-mail two weeks ago, just after it was
written in Los Angeles. Its author is longtime GOP activist Fernando
Oaxaca, who often sends out sharp-edged e-mails about political
issues. But I haven't a clue as to whether it was a mistake that
caused it to be sent across the country via the White House. That's
almost beside the point: Most of the Democrats that Oaxaca criticized
are convinced it was a cheap shot orchestrated by the White House.</TE>
<TE>   None of them is angrier than the chairman of the caucus, Rep.
Silvestre Reyes (D-Texas). Reyes, a member of the House Intelligence
and Armed Services committees, said critics of his vote "don't
appreciate how difficult a decision it was for me. But I believe we
face greater threats than Iraq and know my vote was the right thing
to do." Reyes, who was a helicopter crew chief in Vietnam, added: "I
was thrust 35 years ago into one foolish war. I am not going to vote
for another foolish war now."</TE>
<TE>   A veteran like Reyes is in a safe position to rebut questions
about his patriotism, of course. It is tougher for the many Latinos
in Congress who never served in the military. Each voted after
reaching his or her own conclusion following a restrained and
thoughtful debate. "We never even considered taking a position as the
Hispanic Caucus," said Rep. Xavier Becerra of Los Angeles. "You can't
ask people to vote as a caucus on something as important as a
question of war or peace."</TE>
<TE>   Of course, if the GOP persists in trying to cast aspersions on the
loyalty of members of Congress like Reyes and Becerra, Democrats can
always point to all the Republicans who never saw combat -- like Bush
himself, who served in the Air National Guard in Texas, or Vice
President Dick Cheney, who got student and marriage deferments.</TE>
<TE>   Bush got the Iraq resolution he wanted from Congress, so it now
behooves him to act like a statesman. And I have the perfect role
model: Rep. Jeannette Rankin, a Montana Republican who served in
Congress in the 1940s. She cast a courageous vote in December 1941.
With the nation still reeling from the attack on Pearl Harbor and
President Roosevelt's "Day of Infamy" speech echoing in the Capitol,
Congress declared war on Japan. Rankin was the only member of the
House or Senate who voted no: She felt a democracy should not vote
unanimously for war.</TE>
<TE>   Rankin's vote obviously made little difference in the epic
struggle that ensued once the U.S. joined the Allied war against the
Axis powers. But her honorable stance remains a symbol of the
freedoms that Americans, including many heroic young Latinos, have
fought wars to defend.</TE>
<TE>   Modern Republicans should remember Rankin when they are tempted to
use Congress' Iraq resolution for political gain.</TE>

<HD>Painful Dose of Reality for Patients</HD>
<DH>With medical costs exploding, insured employees will have
to dig deeper.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Paul B. Ginsburg</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Many insured working Americans, accustomed to paying as little as $10
for a doctor visit, have little idea of the true costs of medical
care. But employers are about to administer a dose of strong medicine
to workers in their 2003 health insurance plans.</LD>
<LD>   Spending on health care grew seven times faster than the overall
economy last year, an unsustainable pace. Starting next year,
consumers are going to feel the pain. Not only will they pay more
when they go to the doctor or fill a prescription, they are going to
have more taken out of their paychecks to cover the cost of health
insurance.</LD>
<LD>   In many ways, we are returning to the benefit structure that we
had in the days before managed care, when most insurance coverage had
large deductibles and other hefty out-of-pocket expenses.
Managed-care plans did away with much of that, offering low
co-payments and generous coverage of preventive services and
prescription drugs.</LD>
<TE>   So how did we end up back where we started? Faced with a backlash
against managed-care plans that seemed to do too much managing and
not enough caring, many plans relaxed limits on care and expanded
people's choice of doctors and hospitals. As health plans eased off
the cost-control brakes, doctors and patients started using more
services. The result: double-digit hikes in insurance premiums.</TE>
<TE>   Until recently, many large employers were willing to absorb most
of the increases and were loath to reduce benefits in a tight job
market during the late-1990s economic boom. Then the economy cooled.</TE>
<TE>   After the public's rejection of tightly managed care, there's
little left in the cost-containment arsenal except making workers pay
a greater share of premiums or increasing patient cost-sharing. So
far, most employers have wisely opted for increased cost-sharing
because it offers consumers the option of economizing on the use of
health care to limit their financial burden. The alternative of
making workers contribute a larger share of premiums also runs the
risk of tempting younger and healthier workers to decline coverage if
they see the cost as too high.</TE>
<TE>   The simple fact is that society needs to control health-care
spending. It's also important to keep in mind that most insured
patients are still paying a smaller proportion of the costs of their
care than they did before the managed-care era.</TE>
<TE>   Giving consumers more of a financial stake in their care can raise
awareness about costs. Medical care is complex, and it is better that
patients and their doctors consider treatment costs than be bound by
intrusive administrative rules. Moreover, there are opportunities to
economize without major sacrifices, such as by using generic drugs.</TE>
<TE>   But too much cost-sharing can indeed become a barrier to needed
care, especially for people with low incomes and those with chronic
illnesses. And we are starting to hear examples of that, especially
in regard to prescription drugs.</TE>
<TE>   Here are some ways to make cost-sharing effective:</TE>
<TE>   * Placing limits on how much a family has to pay annually.</TE>
<TE>   * Offering lower costs to steer patients to the most efficient
doctors and hospitals.</TE>
<TE>   * Offering bonuses to people who take steps to save money.
Diabetics, for example, could be encouraged to enter disease
management programs -- which save money by helping people to stay
healthy -- through offers of free diabetic supplies.</TE>
<TE>   * Giving consumers better information on price and quality to help
them make informed choices.</TE>
<TE>   When it comes down to it, if given an option of tightly managed
care, many consumers would prefer that to the current system of
loosely managed care with substantial cost-sharing.</TE>

<HD>Bush's Oil Plan Pours $3 Billion Down a Deep Hole</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Ronald E. Minsk</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Bush administration is busy burying $3 billion underground -- the
cost of filling the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to its 700-million
barrel capacity -- without any good reason. Moreover, it is filling
the reserve with $30-per-barrel oil, contributing in part to the
increase in the price of oil.</LD>
<LD>   The recent European Union announcement that it will create its own
reserve proves the political appeal of the policy but does nothing to
reduce the problems associated with burying oil without a plan on how
to use it. I see no plausible scenario in which the $3 billion in
additional reserves provides meaningful economic or security
benefits.</LD>
<LD>   The reserve is already large enough to serve as a "strategic"
reserve that can respond to physical supply disruptions related to
acts of war or terrorism. But it is unlikely ever to be large enough
to counter a catastrophic interruption in the supply of Persian Gulf
oil or to be an "economic" reserve that might counter the
Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries' exercise of market
power to increase oil prices.</LD>
<TE>   The Energy Department now can release up to 4.1 million barrels of
crude oil per day for nearly five months, an amount sufficient to
respond to nearly any terrorist event or war that temporarily
interrupts oil supplies.</TE>
<TE>   For example, in January 1991, during the Gulf War, the first Bush
administration placed 33 million barrels of the reserve's oil on
sale, but the market purchased only 16 million.</TE>
<TE>   However, today's reserve is far too small and probably could never
be made large enough to respond meaningfully to a catastrophic loss
of oil resulting from a crisis involving a long-term interruption in
the flow of Gulf oil.</TE>
<TE>   Likewise, the reserve is never likely to be large enough to work
well as an economic reserve that could moderate the price of oil.
When oil prices jump, it's usually because OPEC producers, led by
Saudi Arabia, have cut production to increase prices.</TE>
<TE>   Yet as easily as we can release oil from the reserve in response
to their exercise of market power, OPEC can simply cut output
further. Since OPEC's pockets are deeper than our reserves, we could
run out of oil before OPEC runs out of money.</TE>
<TE>   International reserves held by industrialized countries, which
might be expanded by a new European reserve, would be inadequate to
work as an economic reserve. Coordinating international reserves to
allow a more forceful response to OPEC's exercise of market power
would require a nearly impossible consensus about what constitutes a
"reasonable" price for oil.</TE>
<TE>   When the reserve was created in 1975, its use was an afterthought.
We simply presumed that its mere existence would protect us from
OPEC. But oil has since become freely available on commodity markets.
Today, all "supply shortages" are reflected immediately in the price
of oil.</TE>
<TE>   Although White House spokesman Ari Fleischer has indicated that
the reserve would not be used in response to high prices, there is no
scenario in which the administration could tap the reserve without
prices having risen.</TE>
<TE>   Even in the event of a supply interruption, using the reserve
could undermine price incentives to increase production elsewhere, a
realization that led the first Bush administration not to release oil
from the reserve when Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990.</TE>
<TE>   Without better understanding and clear agreement on how to use the
Strategic Petroleum Reserve, it is a mistake to spend $3 billion to
enlarge it. The administration should carefully study how we expect
the reserve to function and what policy we expect it to serve. Only
then should the president determine its size.</TE>
<TE>   In the unlikely event that the Bush administration can explain how
the Strategic Petroleum Reserve might work as an economic reserve,
then it certainly will need to be larger. But a credible analysis is
more likely to determine that the reserve is only viable as a
"strategic" reserve, in which case the current one is large enough.</TE>

assistant to President Clinton for economic policy in 2000 and 2001.</TE>

<LD>In 1905, President Theodore Roosevelt grew so concerned over college
athletics that he called two White House summits. The problem was the
maiming, sometimes even deaths, occurring during these new things
called college football games, which were basically rule-free
encounters between two merciless gangs in school colors.</LD>
<LD>   Soon, schools organized to police themselves through what became
the National Collegiate Athletic Assn., now a voluntary group of
1,200 colleges, universities, conferences and sports organizations.</LD>
<LD>   Some things changed over time; Roosevelt, for instance, is no
longer president. But collegiate athletic problems continued and were
exacerbated by commercialization, TV and their lifeblood, Money.</LD>
<TE>   Now, the NCAA is changing presidents. It's just named only its
fourth president in a half-century, Myles Brand, a 60-year-old
student of philosophy who's run Indiana University since 1994.
Brand's name may seem familiar; under him Indiana quadrupled
endowment, doubled research funds and tripled endowed chairs. Oh, and
Brand was the fearless fellow who fired basketball coach Bobby Knight
for unsportsmanlike behavior. Did we mention this was Indiana?</TE>
<TE>   As the first university president to run the NCAA, Brand brings to
his new job impressive credentials, a suitcase of savvy and the hopes
of many sickened by ethical lapses and plain cheating by grown-up
competitors in corporate America. At Indiana, Brand led 100,000
students on eight campuses. Now he'll monitor the administrative,
academic and competitive endeavors of 355,688 collegiate athletes
(and millions more adoring, affluent alums) in a plethora of sports,
most financially supported by the revenues of a few.</TE>
<TE>   Once, sports were less entertainment and revenue streams from auto
and beer makers seeking couch-bound consumers than an integral part
of a classical education of the whole person. Hence, the term
physical education. Brand must continue the re-integration of
academics and athletics.</TE>
<TE>   Though scandals, like quarterbacks, always draw more attention
than good news or linemen, recent NCAA figures from outgoing
President Cedric Dempsey offer encouragement; for the first time,
graduation rates for athletes at the largest schools have reached
60%, two percentage points above the all-student graduation rate.</TE>
<TE>   Learning to ethically balance competing interests is part of
life's curriculum before and beyond the classroom. Here's another
indication of our social imbalance: Brand will earn about half the
salary of some famed college football coaches. Unlike some, he'll
earn every penny.</TE>

<LD>The Times endorses selectively, on a case-by-case basis. Here are our
recommendations in state and local races in the Nov. 5 general
elections.</LD>
<LD>   State Offices</LD>
<LD>   Governor. Gray Davis. He deserves another term on the basis of his
well-balanced record, despite his unseemly fund-raising. Davis' GOP
opponent, Bill Simon Jr., has repeatedly demonstrated that he is not
up to the task of governing California.</LD>
<TE>   Lieutenant Governor. Cruz Bustamante. He has done a credible job
in his first term in a thankless post.</TE>
<TE>   Attorney General. Bill Lockyer. He has been active as the chief
law enforcement officer -- with abusive nursing homes among his
targets -- and has earned another term.</TE>
<TE>   Treasurer. Phil Angelides. This hard-working incumbent is the
Energizer Bunny on everything from financing the state's growing
deficit to fighting corporate fraud.</TE>
<TE>   Secretary of State. Kevin Shelley. He had a fine record as a state
legislator, advocating improvements in state voting systems and a
bond issue for new voting machines.</TE>
<TE>   Controller. Steve Westly. He is an executive and economic
development expert with the attitude and background to help get the
state's fiscal house in order.</TE>
<TE>   Insurance Commissioner. John Garamendi. The state's first elected
insurance commissioner seeks office again. Garamendi is a well-known
quantity for a troubled office that needs to regain consumers' trust.</TE>
<TE>   State Superintendent of Public Instruction. Jack O'Connell. A
former high school teacher who specialized in education issues during
his 20 years in the state Legislature, O'Connell has the right
portfolio for the job.</TE>
<TE>   State Ballot Measures</TE>
<TE>   Proposition 46. YES. This $2.1-billion bond measure would finance
housing ranging from shelter for the family on the streets to
apartments for low-income seniors and down-payment help for
first-time buyers. It's a grab bag but answers real needs.</TE>
<TE>   Proposition 47. YES. The state's schools are still overcrowded and
run-down, especially in cities. This $13-billion bond would match
local school bonds and would not raise state debt to unsafe levels.</TE>
<TE>   Proposition 48. YES. Merely conforms the state charter with
consolidation of municipal and superior courts.</TE>
<TE>   Proposition 49. NO. Funding after-school programs is fine, but
this measure locks up its budget from the state general fund,
depriving fundamental programs.</TE>
<TE>   Proposition 50. YES. This $3.4-billion bond would help assure
state water supplies and quality.</TE>
<TE>   Proposition 51. NO. An ugly example of the misuse of the ballot
initiative. Groups that financially backed this measure for 45
projects got their own included in it.</TE>
<TE>   Proposition 52. NO. Election-day registration offers too many
chances for fraud.</TE>
<TE>   Local Measures</TE>
<TE>   Measure A. YES. This $250-million bond would match private funds
to improve safety at Los Angeles County cultural facilities. A good
investment.</TE>
<TE>   Measure B. YES. A small parcel tax, based on property size, to
fund L.A. County emergency and trauma care. State and federal
governments have shirked their responsibility for the county's public
health crisis, making this measure a last resort.</TE>
<TE>   Measure F and Measure H. NO. Los Angeles is a powerful, remarkable
city that won't be better off if the San Fernando Valley and
Hollywood secede.</TE>
<TE>   Measure K. YES. The Los Angeles Unified School District has
finally hired professionals who understand big projects. Add to this
the district's desperate need for more classrooms and this
$3.3-billion bond is solidly worth voting for.</TE>
<TE>   Judicial Endorsements</TE>
<TE>   California Supreme Court</TE>
<TE>   Vote yes to retain these incumbents.</TE>
<TE>   Carlos R. Moreno</TE>
<TE>   Marvin R. Baxter</TE>
<TE>   Kathryn M. Werdegar</TE>
<TE>   State Court of Appeal</TE>

<HD>Brazil Should Look Twice at Privatization</HD>
<DH></DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>"Lula Will Need Ties to U.S." (editorial, Oct. 16) states that the
presumed president-elect of Brazil should not go back to an era of
"protected markets, state monopolies and government-managed
industries." The editorial vaguely states that those measures
"wouldn't help." Be advised that the fine folks at Enron were big
movers behind Brazil's privatizing its electric utilities. The
Brazilian people were promised that their electric bills would
plummet by privatization -- and then their rates actually increased.
Ring familiar? Service also became spotty with the change, and this
contributed to the weak production and deficits highlighted in your
editorial.</LD>
<LD>   To compound the coincidence, Enron and other companies were the
new owners of Brazil's utilities; these same folks brought
"deregulation" to our California utilities.</LD>
<LD>   You tiredly drag out the "free market" answer to Brazil's
problems, when the U.S. has been built into the richest nation in
history by a highly regulated, public-private mixed economy that
emphasized worker protections and relatively high wages through union
representation. When no less than free-market huckster President Bush
has signed off on significant subsidies for American farmers, tariff
protections for our steel industry -- and ignores federal deficits to
reduce corporate taxes -- how can the U.S. expect Brazil to do any
different?</LD>

<LD>It seems ironic to me that Republicans have been so vocal in their
condemnation of Gov. Gray Davis' ability to raise money. Among the
voting public, it is Democrats who are overwhelmingly in favor of
getting money out of politics and Republicans who fight so hard to
retain the status quo. They should stop complaining about the fact
that the Democratic candidate used their system to far better effect
than their candidate did.</LD>

<HD>Light Poles and Potholes Matter in Secession Vote</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Your poll of voters on the issue of the San Fernando Valley's
independence from Los Angeles may show the majority of us against it,
but I'm still straddling the divide ("Secession Trails in the Valley
for First Time," Oct. 16). Born and raised in Los Angeles, I truly
love L.A., but I've spent the past 18 years living in many of the
communities that make the San Fernando Valley great -- and presently
I live across the street from a light pole broken by an auto accident
that occurred in July 2001.</LD>
<LD>   Despite contacting the appropriate bureaus and agencies, more than
14 months later that broken light pole has yet to be replaced, and to
me it has come to symbolize the poor service and response that those
calling for separation from the city are railing about. That's when
the light bulb went off, so to speak.</LD>
<LD>   Tired of all the pro and con secession rhetoric, I boiled the
battle down to two options and put my councilman, Jack Weiss, in the
driver's seat. I told him: Fix the light by the evening of the coming
election and the city will get my vote; leave it in disrepair and
I'll support the Valley's liberation. It's an illuminating offer he
shouldn't refuse.</LD>

<TE>   The Valley is as pure Los Angeles as Hollywood or the Pueblo de
Los Angeles (Olvera Street) are. I'm so glad that fewer of my
neighbors are listening to that hypocritical power-grabbing clique
that has continually shot down local improvements even as it chants,
"We're not getting our fair share." You don't have to look at this
mob very long to see that it's not about "small is better." It's
about a greedy small-mindedness not suitable for a great city.</TE>

<TE>   Re "Secessionists Tar L.A.'s Efforts to Fill Up Potholes," Oct.
14: We all have legitimate complaints about the condition of our
streets in Los Angeles, but these Valley people are wrong on this
one. My experience confirms [interim director of the city's Bureau of
Street Services] Bill Robertson's statistics. If you call in a
pothole, it gets fixed in a day or so, but if you just complain and
don't call it in, nothing happens. However, Robertson should think
about making the system more user-friendly, having an interactive Web
site or even doing some public service announcements like the city
used to do, so more people are aware that they can call in and get a
pothole fixed.</TE>

<TE>   Re "L.A. Lags Behind Largest U.S. Cities in Basic Services," Oct.
13: Co-chair of the Valley Independence Committee Carlos Ferreyra is
right when he said, "We [the new Valley city] can do better." Take
the Chatsworth Library, for example. The old library was torn down
over a year ago. Then the property sat with nothing going on.
Finally, a contractor was chosen and some basic work started. Several
months ago, all work stopped. The contractor has gone out of
business. So right now, nothing is being built.</TE>
<TE>   Is downtown even aware that work has stopped? Can the bureaucrats
downtown not choose competent contractors? What is their plan to get
the library completed, and when? Why can't they learn from those in
the Walgreen's chain? They are putting in a new building on
Devonshire Street at De Soto Avenue. It looks like that store will be
completed in fewer than six months, start to finish. We need local
control!</TE>

<HD>Perle's Privileged View of War and Its Effects</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Well, well, well, isn't it wonderful to see Richard Perle sitting in
his multi-acre Chevy Chase, Md., estate having a souffle and a glass
of imported port with a good book while convincing President Bush to
send our sons and daughters off to invade Iraq. This dilettante has
somehow avoided military service of any kind and, of course, has not
experienced combat, i.e., that environment where folks kill each
other, sometimes at close range. The subject of war and all its
consequences is merely another academic exercise to toss about with
fellow ultraconservatives at the local think tank. It is amazing how
glorious and honorable war can be when one has nothing at stake.
Should Perle's war go badly he, like Robert McNamara of Vietnam fame,
will write a bestseller telling how sorry he is for his poor
judgments.</LD>
<LD>   Frank Ferrone</LD>
<LD>   El Cajon</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Perle's influence is scary. This man, chair of the Defense Policy
Board, was a staunch advocate of Ronald Reagan's now-defunct "Star
Wars" program. He now lobbies for the "bullet hitting a bullet"
offspring of "Star Wars," equally doomed to failure. And his
comparison of Neville Chamberlain's appeasement of Hitler to the
antiwar policy on Iraq shows either ignorance of European history or,
sadly, a deliberate, motivated attempt to mislead the uninformed
among the public and Congress.</TE>
<TE>   Aristid Berk</TE>

<TE>   Your article mentions that Perle, 61, studied international
politics under professor Ross Berkes of USC, read the realist classic
text of Hans Morgenthau, studied at the London School of Economics,
went on to study at Princeton and has a flair for gourmet cooking.
Except for going on to UCLA instead of Princeton, I too am of the
same age, studied under Ross Berkes of USC, read Hans Morgenthau,
studied at the London School of Economics and have a flair for
gourmet cooking. But I am not a crazy, unflinching hawk.</TE>

<LD>Re "Do Amber Alerts Put Drivers in Jeopardy?" Oct. 15: Would it be
right to discontinue the Amber alert system because it causes
occasional congestion on the freeways? Let's think about that. Would
it be right to discontinue stringent checks of airport passengers
because of the inconvenience? Abolish background checks on gun
purchases so people can purchase guns without waiting? Repeal
seat-belt laws because those things are awfully restrictive? The
answer is, of course, no. Amber alerts may cause minor congestion,
but it's a small price to pay to keep children safe. Gov. Gray Davis
was right to enact it statewide. People will get used to the alerts
in time.</LD>

<LD>Re "It's an All-California Series, but Fans Are Worlds Apart," Oct.
15: Isn't this a great way to finally, once and for all, settle the
Northern Californian-Southern Californian water dispute? When my sons
traveled north to college (Chico State), they were surprised at all
the animosity that exists "up north" toward us Southern Californians.
They found out that this hostility comes from the Northern
Californians' anger that we "steal" their water from them.</LD>
<LD>   In honor of the athletic prowess found in the sport of baseball,
in my opinion this is a very appropriate and testosterone-laced way
to settle an ages-long dispute over water: Do it via a gentlemen's
duel. Thus we have the northerners (San Francisco Giants) dueling
against the southerners (Anaheim Angels), which should settle this
very important dispute once and for all.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Voting System Reform Bill OKd, Sent to Bush," Oct. 17: I am
genuinely puzzled by the opposition of some members of Congress,
including Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton (D-N.Y.), and various civil
rights organizations, including the Mexican American Legal Defense
and Educational Fund, to the recently passed bill designed to improve
our election systems nationwide. The stated reason for this
opposition is essentially that the new regulations create "onerous"
and intimidating "obstacles" to voter registration.</LD>
<LD>   What are the new requirements? That first-time voters who
registered by mail provide a photo ID such as a driver's license or
alternatively, a copy of a utility bill, bank statement, government
check or other official document with a name and address. If the
first-time voter is unable to provide any of the foregoing, then a
driver's license number or the last four digits of a Social Security
number will do. Quite frankly, if a prospective voter was dissuaded
from registering to vote because he or she was supposedly intimidated
or confused by these requirements, or was unable to produce even one
of these forms of identification, this person should not be voting
anyway and the authorities rightfully should be suspicious.</LD>

has more black men in jail than in college (thanks to the
discriminatorily applied three-strikes law). What did we get instead?
A puff piece on the major candidates' "personalities" and a slanted
poll that deliberately omitted all third-party candidates. Talk about
dropping the ball!</LD>

<LD>The November ballot should be enshrined in history. Not because of
the quality -- or lack thereof -- of the candidates it features.
Rather, this particular ballot is notable because it so perfectly
illustrates the decline of California government. Only such a
deterioration explains the presence on the ballot of three measures
to be decided by voters scarcely aware of the complexities and
unintended consequences of the choices they will make.</LD>
<LD>   These are issues that should have been settled years ago by
lawmakers who were elected to do such work. But restricted by
deficits and Proposition 13, their careers unstable because of term
limits, and obsessed with raising money, elected officials have
abandoned the battlefield.</LD>
<LD>   There is Proposition 49, backed by action-movie star Arnold
Schwarzenegger, which would require the state to spend $550 million a
year from the general fund for after-school programs in elementary,
middle and junior high schools. The programs would include tutoring,
computer training, fine arts and physical fitness activities.</LD>
<TE>   There is Proposition 51, which would vastly increase the amount of
money from the state motor vehicle sales tax spent on mass transit,
highways and streets, school buses and the environment. This would be
done by dedicating 30% of the motor vehicle tax proceeds to these
causes. This would remove money from the general fund, where it is
now used to finance education, social services, health care, prisons
and a variety of other state programs.</TE>
<TE>   And there is Los Angeles County Measure B, conceived by Los
Angeles County Supervisor Zev Yaroslavsky, which proposes raising
$175 million a year to support the county's financially strapped and
shrinking network of trauma centers, which care for the most
seriously injured emergency patients. The money would come from a
3-cent-a-square-foot tax on developed property. Although Measure B is
limited to Los Angeles County, it results from the failure of
federal, state and county governments to provide health care to the
uninsured, who consequently wind up in county hospitals -- the care
centers of last resort. This huge patient load has drained the public
health systems in Los Angeles and other urban counties of funds. Now,
Los Angeles County is threatening to close hospitals as well as
trauma centers.</TE>
<TE>   These three measures demonstrate the bizarre way in which taxpayer
dollars are allocated these days: The best campaign wins. It matters
little whether a cause is good or bad, only how its ads play with
voters. Advertising is as close as we come these days to political
debate.</TE>
<TE>   In the case of Measure B, doctors at the county's Harbor-UCLA
Medical Center have hired political consultant Douglas Jeffe to help
them focus their message in order to compete in the new-style ballot
battles. Although Harbor's utilitarian facility is not in an upscale
neighborhood and serves a mostly working-class clientele, a group of
doctors there has reached out to business, labor and community
leaders to form the Harbor-UCLA Community Alliance.</TE>
<TE>   The group's political efforts are not aimed at the patients served
by the hospital as much as at the more affluent, more-likely-to-vote
residents of the beach cities, the Palos Verdes Peninsula, Torrance
and other middle-class and upper-middle-class areas in the South Bay.
The carefully crafted message being sent by the group is that
preserving the trauma center could save the life of a Palos Verdes
resident after a Harbor Freeway car crash.</TE>
<TE>   Refocusing the issue toward more affluent voters has obvious
political advantages. But it misses the root causes of the health
crisis. "The story is the profound underfunding that has gone on for
years and has finally caught up with us," said Dr. Gail Anderson Jr.,
the hospital's medical director. In Harbor's emergency room on a
recent afternoon, it appeared Anderson had the story right. Patients
filled every seat in the waiting room and all the examining rooms. By
evening, the sick would be seated on the waiting-room floor and
gurneys, with patients stacked up in hallways and the middle of the
emergency room. On busy days, the staff says, patients can wait eight
hours for care.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the patients are brought in after overdosing on drugs or
alcohol or with gunshot wounds. Along with such cases are the
uninsured who show up at the emergency ward when their illnesses
become too severe to ignore.</TE>
<TE>   There was a time when legislators would have spent time in such
wards studying the problems. Then, with the assistance of experienced
consultants, they would have dealt with the problem of the uninsured
instead of passing the buck to the voters, who don't have the
expertise to know what the best solution is. It's true that the old
legislatures had plenty of crooks, drunks and eccentrics. But the
legislators weren't afraid to take on -- and conquer -- seemingly
insoluble problems.</TE>
<TE>   And this isn't from the musty old memory of an ex-legislative
reporter. Working on a biography of Jesse M. Unruh, the late
California political leader, I have been researching our state
Legislature's work on improving care for the mentally ill during the
late 1950s and 1960s.</TE>
<TE>   Recently, I drove up to the Placerville area of Northern
California and interviewed a central figure in that reform, Jerome R.
Waldie, a former congressman and state assemblyman. The '50s were
still the "snake pit" era, and legislators, spurred on by relatives
of patients, wanted to close the huge warehouse state mental
hospitals, replacing them with something better. Waldie, who had been
active on legislation to help mentally impaired children, was asked
by Unruh to head a subcommittee to investigate care of the mentally
ill, particularly in the hospitals.</TE>
<TE>   A consultant, Arthur Bolton, prepared a 30-page questionnaire for
hospital officials. Waldie and his colleagues analyzed the answers
for two months and then held two months of hearings before a
subcommittee composed of legislators who knew the issue. Legislators
also visited facilities around the state. "After a tour, you didn't
want to do much else except cry," Waldie said.</TE>
<TE>   Waldie moved on to Congress, but the other subcommittee members --
Frank Lanterman of La Canada-Flintridge and Nicholas Petris of
Oakland, along with state Sen. Alan Short of Stockton -- drafted
legislation designed to shift huge numbers of the mentally ill from
hospitals to community care. The plans were ambitious and could have
transformed care for the mentally ill had Gov. Ronald Reagan and his
successors not starved the program. Most of the community facilities
were never built, and the homeless mentally ill are now our constant
companions on city streets. But that wasn't the fault of the
lawmakers who did the hard work and took the political risks to help
a powerless segment of society.</TE>
<TE>   Contrast that with the experience of Rob Reiner, the actor and
filmmaker, when in the 1990s he became interested in programs to
promote health, education, child care and other programs for
expectant parents and children under 5. He encountered indifference
in Washington, Sacramento and other state capitals. There were no
lobbyists for this particular segment of society, he found, nor were
there campaign contributions.</TE>
<TE>   But he had celebrity, connections and the ability to attract a
cadre of skilled political advisors. Against the heavily funded
efforts of tobacco companies, the Reiner team persuaded voters to
approve Proposition 10 in 1998, raising the cigarette tax by 50 cents
a pack. The tax has meant more than $600 million a year for
children's programs. Part of the money is spent by a state commission
and part by commissions in each of the state's 58 counties. The Los
Angeles County Proposition 10 Commission has approved two major
programs. One would allocate $100 million over five years to improve
health insurance coverage for children. The other would spend $100
million to begin providing free full-day preschool for every child in
the county.</TE>
<TE>   These are excellent ideas, but they should have been studied,
debated and improved in the Legislature. They should have been
considered alongside other funding needs. But failing that, someone
had to step in. Reiner deserves a place in history, along with this
year's ballot. Knowing Sacramento didn't care, he had to find a
source of funding -- the cigarette tax increase. He did it himself.
So did Schwarzenegger, fighting for a cause or trying to start a
campaign for governor. So did Yaroslavsky, rebuffed in his efforts in
Los Angeles, Sacramento and Washington to save the public health-care
system.</TE>
<TE>   It's a mess. But that's California government today.</TE>

<HD>Preventive Attacks Fail Test of History</HD>

<AU>Robert Dallek and Robert Jervis</AU>
<BD>Robert Dallek is a presidential historian at Boston
University. Robert Jervis is Adlai E. Stevenson professor of
international politics at Columbia University.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>BOSTON -- The Bush administration asserts that an attack on Saddam
Hussein would be a preemptive strike against a potential attacker.
Deterrence and containment, which brought down the Soviet Union and
its communist empire, are no longer viable options in a world of
terrorists ready to use weapons of mass destruction, it says, and
Hussein is a likely supplier if he can cover his tracks.</LD>
<LD>   This is a specious argument. An attack on Iraq would not be a
preemptive strike but a preventive action in response to a
speculative and future, rather than visible and present, threat. The
distinction is more than rhetorical: The recent history of U.S.
preventive actions is not one of great success.</LD>
<LD>   Preemption is a response to an imminent threat. President John F.
Kennedy's quarantine of Cuba in 1962 and demand that Soviet Premier
Nikita S. Khrushchev remove his missiles from the island preempted a
dramatic change in the balance of military power in favor of the
Soviet Union. The danger was clear and present.</LD>
<TE>   Kennedy's preemptive response, it should be noted, did not include
direct military action. Some of his advisors called for surgical
airstrikes against the missile sites in order to minimize civilian
casualties. Others wanted an invasion by U.S. forces. Kennedy
resisted these recommendations. He believed air attacks would have
blighted America's international reputation, and he feared that an
amphibious assault might, like the invasion of North Korea in 1950,
fall short of expectations and leave U.S. troops "bogged down."</TE>
<TE>   In contrast, the Bay of Pigs episode in 1961 was a preventive
action given legitimacy by national security guesswork. In the run-up
to the invasion by Cuban exiles, who were financed, armed and
transported by the U.S., CIA and military advisors told Kennedy that
time was on Fidel Castro's side. The longer we waited, the harder it
would be to overthrow him and the greater his opportunity to spread
communism across Latin America. But this assessment was chiefly based
on speculation about Castro's intentions and his ability to influence
political developments in the hemisphere. As it turned out, the
alarmist conjecture was unfounded. Castro could be contained and
deterred.</TE>
<TE>   Direct evidence of Hussein's involvement in Sept. 11 and of his
eagerness to supply terrorists with weapons of mass destruction --
the basis for a preemptive strike -- is similarly weak. Instead, it's
Hussein's reputed intentions that are at the center of the argument
to topple him. Unfortunately, the CIA isn't too sure what the Iraqi
dictator is up to. At a recent Senate Intelligence Committee hearing,
a CIA official said that the chances of Hussein using weapons of mass
destruction against the U.S. are currently "low" but would greatly
increase if we were to attack Iraq. Put another way, our threat to
take preventive action against Hussein if he doesn't disarm may
undercut the deterrence we now wield.</TE>
<TE>   There are many recent examples of how preventive actions by the
U.S. cost lives, squandered money and heightened international
antagonisms. The CIA role in replacing the elected regime of Mohammed
Mossadegh with that of Shah Mohammed Reza Pahlavi in 1953 is one.
Mossadegh was an Iranian nationalist and neutralist in the Cold War,
a stance that made him suspect in the eyes of the Eisenhower
administration. But by "preventing" his jump to the Soviet side, the
United States helped create the conditions for the eventual triumph
of Islamic militants in 1979 who remain hostile to us.</TE>
<TE>   The consequences of the Bay of Pigs invasion were similarly
disastrous. Nearly 200 Cuban exiles died in the aborted attack, some
1,200 spent more than two years in Cuban prisons and the United
States embarrassed itself before the world. Worse, when added to
subsequent attempts to topple Castro, the invasion gave Khrushchev an
excuse to ship missiles to his Cuban ally.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. invasion and occupation of the Dominican Republic in 1965
was another preventive action that cost the United States and a
presidential administration dearly. President Lyndon B. Johnson sent
Marines to the island to quash a "leftist" rebellion against a
conservative, pro-U.S. government. He said the action was necessary
to prevent a potential communist takeover. To support his case, the
U.S. Embassy in Santo Domingo published a list of 54 "communist and
Castroist leaders" of the rebels. Johnson went further: He claimed
that the rebels had murdered "some 1,500 innocent people" and had
assaulted several embassies, plus that of the U.S. The charges proved
exaggerated, to the point that the president's credibility with the
press and the American peopled suffered. Newsweek soon described him
as "touchy, bitter" about the complexities and unmanageability of
foreign events.</TE>
<TE>   Vietnam is the best-known case of U.S. preventive action gone
awry. True, the Johnson administration tried to preempt Vietnamese
communists from swallowing South Vietnam. But Johnson's commitment to
fight an air and land war in Vietnam rested on a larger goal: to
prevent the spread of communism throughout Southeast Asia so that, in
the overheated rhetoric of the time, we would not have to confront
the communist threat in Berlin, if not on the beaches of Santa
Monica. Hanoi's victory in 1975 produced no such outcome. As Lord
Salisbury, the great British statesman of the late 19th century,
explained, it is rarely wise "to go to war against a nightmare."</TE>
<TE>   Not all U.S. preventive actions have ended badly. The relatively
easy U.S. victories in the Mexican and Spanish-American wars, Grenada
in 1983 and Panama in 1989 could be held up as models of what the
United States needs to do in Iraq. But these successful preventive
strikes were carried off relatively close to home, and none of them
required the dispatch of hundreds of thousands of troops to a region
awash in anger at and hatred of the United States.</TE>
<TE>   President Bush claims that the Iraqi threat will only grow over
time, especially if Hussein produces nuclear weapons. But a great
many things can happen to contain, if not reduce, the danger. Libya
is a case in point. Moammar Kadafi was once America's public enemy
No. 1. He too was thought to be in the hunt for weapons of mass
destruction. He sponsored terrorist acts against the West and, after
the U.S. bombed one of his homes in retaliation, replied by blowing
up U.S. and French airliners. But in subsequent years, Kadafi mended
his ways in the face of a Western policy that combined military
threats with U.N. economic sanctions while holding out the
possibility of better relations. We never assumed that the menace
would grow unless we overthrew the regime.</TE>
<TE>   There's no compelling reason to think that Hussein is beyond the
reach of Western influence.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Few Californians seem aware of the state's disturbing economic
circumstances. The economy is losing well-paying blue-collar and
middle-class jobs at an astounding rate, especially in the Bay Area.
Meanwhile, growth is increasingly concentrated in a handful of
outlying counties. As a result, California's economy is fragmenting
as never before between slow-growth, politically powerful population
centers and pro-growth, politically marginal counties that surround
urban cores. And California's leaders seem indifferent.</LD>
<LD>   Since January 2001, the state has officially lost a net of about
82,000 jobs, far fewer than in the country as a whole. But this
apparent good fortune is misleading. California's employment picture
has been worsening over the last few months, while the jobless rate
nationwide has stabilized. California's manufacturing economy, a key
employment resource for the state's immigrant and working-class
populations, has shed nearly 170,000 positions since January 2001, a
staggering 10% of the industrial workforce. Bedrock middle-class
business services and the motion-picture industry are down nearly
130,000 jobs in the same period.</LD>
<TE>   The state's only employment bright spots are government, which is
adding jobs at nearly twice the national pace, and low-paying retail.
But neither of these sectors creates wealth. Record levels of deficit
spending, mortgage refinancing and short-term credit incentives are
artificially stimulating these sectors.</TE>
<TE>   To an unprecedented extent, most of California's economic pain is
concentrated in its heavily populated urban core areas. Since the
start of 2001, the San Francisco and San Jose metro regions have lost
nearly 150,000 jobs, about 7% of the total regional workforce. That's
a faster decline than even badly wounded Southern California suffered
from the defense and aerospace cutbacks in the dark days of 1990-92.</TE>
<TE>   After several years of solid if unspectacular expansion, Los
Angeles County, home to about 25% of the state's employment, has lost
about 55,000 jobs. All told, more than 200,000 jobs have vanished
from the San Francisco and Los Angeles metro areas since 2001, nearly
two-thirds of the state's total employment loss in the first 20
months of the 1990s recession. Unlike the early 1990s, the urban
meltdown is frighteningly universal in scope and includes reductions
in service, film production, manufacturing, high-tech, finance,
wholesale trade and construction employment.</TE>
<TE>   These realities, however, are partly obscured by the remarkable
vitality of the state's more conservative outlying areas,
particularly the southern counties surrounding Los Angeles.
Growth-oriented Riverside, San Bernardino, Orange and northern San
Diego counties have generated more than 90,000 new jobs in the teeth
of the national slowdown, offsetting about half of the decline in
employment in the San Francisco, San Jose and Los Angeles metro
regions. In marked contrast with Los Angeles and the Bay Area,
manufacturing-job losses have been minimal in these counties. Healthy
gains have been achieved in the construction, business services,
communications, trade, finance, engineering and management sectors.
Many parts of the Central Valley and other eastern areas of the state
are also expanding, albeit less rapidly.</TE>
<TE>   Still, California's manufacturing meltdown is especially troubling
because goods production is crucial to the state's social and
technological advancement. Manufacturing disproportionately employs
people who lack college degrees, like first-generation immigrants,
and pays better wages and benefits than nonmanufacturing jobs.
Deprived of quality jobs, working- and middle-class California
families will be unable to improve their lot. Inequality, already a
severe problem, will almost certainly become worse.</TE>
<TE>   The apparent failure of California's leaders to grasp such peril
is directly related to the state's urban anti-growth politics. To be
sure, the stock market bubble of the late 1990s breathed life into
the Bay Area and Los Angeles regions, creating, at least for a time,
the illusion that they had found a way to grow without a
full-spectrum economy. Even now, many fantasize that good times are
just around the corner. But California's biggest population centers
have long been economic laggards.</TE>
<TE>   Twenty years ago, the San Francisco and San Jose metro areas
generated about 16% of California's total employment. Today, they
account for less than 14%. Over the same period, unheralded Orange,
San Bernardino and Riverside counties grew much more rapidly and by
2002 accounted for 25% more jobs than their slower-growing northern
counterparts. The western Bay Area and the Los Angeles regions
accounted for more than half of California's job base in the early
1980s; their share has since fallen to 40%.</TE>
<TE>   This development reflects an urban political consensus that
disfavors all but elite, white-collar job growth, a strategy that has
boosted land prices to comparatively high levels, led to
unpredictable, complex regulation and limited working- and
middle-class business development. As these attitudes became
entrenched in Greater San Francisco and Los Angeles, economic
activity moved to the state's more conservative, pro-growth counties
inland. Quite possibly the most damaging fantasy spawned by the
bubble economy is the belief that California's cities had somehow
jump-started their economies without changing their policies. But
since the mind-numbing "new economy" hype ended, the state's split
into slow- and faster-growth regions has become more apparent than
ever.</TE>
<TE>   This has created something of a political paradox. The state's
overwhelmingly Democratic leaders, firmly anchored in large urban
areas, seek to boost the scope and size of government, which requires
a vibrant economy and ever-expanding tax revenues. During the last
boom, they gambled that a handful of stock-option multimillionaires
would finance public budgets indefinitely. That didn't happen, so
today they must rely on the state's most conservative, rapidly
growing regions for funding. It's difficult to imagine that a
leadership drawn from California's most anti-growth population
centers can possibly coexist with, let alone sustain, the politically
hostile pro-growth periphery they must increasingly tax to fund their
agendas.</TE>
<TE>   In the past, efforts to develop an urban growth policy usually
degenerated into bitter, inconclusive battles over the scope and
reach of regulation. In reality, the most urgent need is not the
removal of regulatory controls but assuring that controls are
predictably and uniformly applied. What most cripples urban
development is the possibility that any interest group or bureaucrat
can manipulate the regulatory process to upset business planning. The
state should eliminate the chronic capriciousness in land use, tax,
labor, environmental and similar laws that have restrained its urban
economy. At present, Californians are preparing to vote in an
atmosphere of economic delusion. After the election, when the state's
new leaders can safely claim their seats, they will almost certainly
discover that such neglect has a high price.</TE>

<LD>BOSTON -- One humid night in Berlin this summer, I dined with four
European acquaintances at the home of a Hungarian grad student. For
more than two hours, as my host opened first one and then another
bottle of Moldavian rose, we spoke intensely about Sept. 11,
Afghanistan and terrorism.</LD>
<LD>   The Europeans, like many on their side of the Atlantic, were
skeptical of U.S. motives. They lambasted what they saw as the U.S.
view that everything can be solved with bombs. I laid out the many
legitimate reasons for U.S. involvement in Afghanistan and for
military intervention in Iraq. They kept harping on what they saw as
U.S. neocolonialism and unilateralism.</LD>
<LD>   Throughout the evening, I reminded them about the October 2000
bombing of the Cole and the August 1998 African embassy bombings --
events that had barely scratched the surface of their
consciousnesses. The dinner ended with goodwill on all sides, and I
felt I had done something of at least partial value by articulating
the American point of view. But the evening was disturbing. These
were well-read people, intellectuals. Yet many of the points I made
were new to them. It was obvious that no one is making articulate
arguments on America's behalf directly to the Europeans.</LD>
<TE>   President Bush has worked hard to convince the American people of
the need to confront Saddam Hussein. His administration has reached
out to the Arab world, with Voice of America now employing Radio Sawa
to broadcast to Arab youths, and former advertising executive
Charlotte Beers heading up a State Department public diplomacy
effort. Such efforts have not been made in Europe. While diplomatic
contacts have been made at high levels of government, little effort
has been directed at influencing opinion among ordinary citizens --
particularly the Germans and the French. This lack of effort is
reflected both in recent opinion polls and in the anti-U.S. protests
that seem to sweep across Europe each weekend.</TE>
<TE>   There is nothing new in Americans and Europeans having different
viewpoints. After World War II, Western Europeans were far more
sympathetic to communism than people here. The difference is that
then, unlike now, the U.S. did something about it.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the Marshall Plan, which transferred $13.3 billion
from the U.S. to Europe, and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization,
which tied the U.S. to its European allies militarily, the U.S. also
engaged in a sometimes overt, sometimes covert effort to win over
European intellectuals. At a time when so few are cogently making
America's case abroad, the U.S. would be wise to look back to how it
won the battle of ideas during its struggle with the Soviet Union.</TE>
<TE>   During the Cold War, the U.S. carefully nurtured European
intellectuals who took the side of the U.S. Not far from the site of
my dinner in Berlin, according to Peter Coleman's book "The Liberal
Conspiracy," Hungarian-British writer Arthur Koestler 52 years
earlier addressed a gathering of a U.S.-supported group known as the
Congress for Cultural Freedom. "Friends, freedom has seized the
offensive," Koestler proclaimed, making the case against communism in
Eastern Europe. Sidney Hook, Melvin Lasky, Ignazio Silone and George
Orwell eventually joined Koestler's brigade of Western anti-Soviet
intellectuals.</TE>
<TE>   To promote this movement, the U.S. government also sponsored a
German literary magazine, Der Monat. "The Soviets were holding all
kinds of meetings, publishing newspapers, magazines," recalls Irving
Kristol, the co-founder of Encounter, a monthly English-language
magazine sponsored by the Congress for Cultural Freedom. "Apparently
someone thought America should be doing something to counteract
that."</TE>
<TE>   The congress generally, and Encounter specifically, had their
roots in the concept that, in order for the public to endorse an
idea, it must first be put forward by intellectuals. The congress,
although secretly funded by the CIA, served as the democratic,
liberal conduit for anti-communist ideas from 1950 until 1967, when
its CIA connections were exposed. It provided the funding and
infrastructure for a series of publications across Europe and the
rest of the world to promote these ideas and the convocation of
serious international seminars to do likewise.</TE>
<TE>   Today, American pop culture reaches Europe in other ways, mostly
through television, music, movies and the Internet. But these venues
do not provide a serious breeding ground for ideas, and in Europe,
much more than in the United States, ordinary people look to
intellectuals for guidance.</TE>
<TE>   American lawmakers acknowledge that the U.S. must do a more
effective job of making its case to Europe. "Clearly, we need to do a
better job of getting our message out to other parts of the world
about who we are, what our values are and what we stand for," says
Sen. Evan Bayh (D-Ind.). (Bayh does call it "surprising that we even
face that task in Western Europe, an area where you would feel the
preexisting common ground would be much stronger.")</TE>
<TE>   But simply replicating the Congress for Cultural Freedom is not
likely to succeed today. The United States already participates in a
number of cultural exchange programs with Europe. Transatlantic
academic conferences are a regular occurrence. Says Sen. John McCain
(R-Ariz.): "There are a myriad of exchange programs, particularly
among students. I think the fundamentals of the relationship, U.S.
and European, are very sound." And, as Stephen Grand, a fellow at the
German Marshall Fund, points out, there is a limit to what exchange
programs can accomplish: "If there's no common perception of a common
threat, if the Europeans don't see a threat, there's a limit to what
they can do."</TE>
<TE>   Also, when the public finally learned that the Congress for
Cultural Freedom's main financial backer was the CIA, the group lost
much of its earlier credibility and intellectual resonance. Clearly,
any new effort aimed at the European public cannot be created behind
closed doors. But neither can it be an official government effort, as
skeptical Europeans would dismiss such a project as tainted.</TE>
<TE>   These difficulties do not, however, mean that there is nothing to
be done. Making America's case in Europe is an important task.
Organizing such an effort could become the work of existing nonprofit
corporations and think tanks -- or provide a raison d'etre for a new
group.</TE>
<TE>   Providing a platform to U.S. intellectuals in Europe and assisting
pro-American intellectuals already there is a vital duty. In the last
year, we have seemed to be moving further away from our European
allies -- but we need them more than ever.</TE>

<DH>If Hussein is forced to admit inspectors, Iraq's clans may
desert him -- toppling the dictator without a U.S. attack.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Sandra Mackey</AU>
<BD>Sandra Mackey is the author of "The Reckoning: Iraq and
the Legacy of Saddam Hussein."</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>ATLANTA -- In its headlong rush into war, the Bush administration is
evaluating the power of Saddam Hussein only by its well-known
elements -- the Republican Guard, the internal security system and
the stockpiles of chemical and biological weapons. Its conclusion is
that Hussein is so entrenched that only U.S. military power can
remove him. But the administration is ignoring another pillar of
Hussein's power: an intricate set of alliances with Iraqi tribal
leaders. These are allies who can be rented but not bought. The
president and his hawkish advisors need to understand that the tribes
could bring about the collapse of Hussein without America having to
fire a shot.</LD>
<LD>   The nature of Hussein's regime is rooted in the nature of Iraq. In
the aftermath of World War I, the British jammed Sunni Arabs, Shiite
Arabs and non-Arab Kurds, along with a cluster of other ethnic and
sectarian groups, into a contrived state called Iraq. Most of the
pieces composing this human mosaic contained powerful tribal
elements. Although there were also strong urban traditions within
each of these ethnic and sectarian groups, particularly among the
Sunnis, Iraq was essentially a tribal society.</LD>
<TE>   In 1921, the British created a monarchy to rule over what was
technically a mandate assigned to London by the League of Nations.
The search for a king by the British Colonial Office placed Faisal I,
a Hashemite from Mecca, on a hastily contrived throne. From the day
of his crowning, the king in Baghdad was defied by powerful tribal
confederations that claimed their own law and leadership. During his
12-year reign, Faisal I spent an enormous amount of energy on tedious
negotiations to keep the tribes loyal. His successors in the monarchy
and every government that followed the 1958 revolution faced the same
challenge -- control of the tribes.</TE>
<TE>   Yet the urban tradition present since the days of the Ottoman
Empire counterbalanced the tribalism in the countryside. Through the
1950s and the 1960s, one regime after another appealed to the
increasing numbers of urbanites to give Baghdad the support that
would move Iraq from a state to a nation. In the 1970s, the Baath
government, of which Hussein was a part, used the riches that
resulted from the explosion of oil prices in 1973 to woo every Iraqi
to the authority of Baghdad. The party achieved a level of success as
most ethnic, sectarian and tribal groups benefited from government
largess that provided health care, education, housing and a vastly
improved and expanded infrastructure.</TE>
<TE>   The Baathists even dreamed up a new identity for Iraqis that was
designed to cross the barriers of group, sect and tribe. Ignoring the
historical truth -- that most Iraqis are either of mixed heritage
born of centuries of conquest or are immigrants who arrived as late
as the early years of the 20th century -- the Baath government
declared all Iraqis direct descendants of ancient Mesopotamia.</TE>
<TE>   In pursuit of this ideology, the Baath government poured millions
of dollars into archeology. The walls of Nineveh, the Assyrians'
ancient capital, rose again out of the plain near the current city of
Mosul. And Babylon, the seat of Nebuchadnezzar, was pulled out of the
salt and mud of southern Iraq. Tying these symbols of ancient history
to a socialist economic system, the rulers in Baghdad sold the idea
that ethnic, sectarian and tribal rivalries should give way to Iraqi
nationalism.</TE>
<TE>   Even so, the forces of tribalism continued to challenge the Iraqi
state. The Sunni Arab tribes west of Baghdad continued to hold sway
over parts of the desert. The Arab Shiites of the south still gave
their first allegiance to their tribal leaders, not to the central
government. And the Kurds of the north staged one of their periodic
rebellions against Baghdad from 1970 to 1975. Although the
overarching cause was Kurdish demands for autonomy or independence
from the Iraqi state, internal tribal politics infected the uprising.
In cities where rural migrants pursued economic promise, tribalism
was well established. Members of some tribes transplanted themselves
from their villages to urban neighborhoods, where they replicated
their tribal structure and pledged allegiance to traditional tribal
leaders.</TE>
<TE>   In the Iran-Iraq war of 1980-88, Hussein, by then the sole
political authority in Baghdad, sacrificed the idea of Mesopotamia as
the unifying theme of the Iraqi state. Instead of acknowledging the
war for what it really was -- a contest between the two commanding
personalities of Hussein and Ayatollah Khomeini -- Baghdad turned the
battlefield into a stage on which the epic struggle between Arabs and
Persians was played out. The Kurds were not part of the equation that
was to save the Iraqi state from the hated Persians. But neither was
it a great national cause, only a bloodbath in which government
conscription and tribal leaders sent Iraqis into the trenches to die.</TE>
<TE>   The next war, the Gulf War of 1991, confronted Hussein with defeat
and simultaneous rebellions by the Arab Shiites in the south and the
Kurds in the north. With only the Sunni center of Iraq behind him,
Hussein jettisoned more than eight decades of effort by kings,
military dictators, the Baath party and himself to nurture an Iraqi
nation. No longer commanding enough loyalists to man either the
military forces or security services necessary to police the country,
the Iraqi president held on to political power by reviving the most
basic element of Iraqi identity -- tribalism.</TE>
<TE>   The dust of war and rebellion had yet to settle before tribal
sheiks from the Shiite south and the Sunni midlands were summoned to
Baghdad to publicly pledge their allegiance to Hussein. It was a deal
based on mutual benefit. The tribal leaders won money, favors and
guns from Hussein in return for holding their people in check for the
Iraqi dictator. Even in what became the Kurdish autonomous zone
patrolled by U.S. military aircraft, one Kurdish faction allied with
Baghdad in 1996 to gain advantage over a rival Kurdish group.</TE>
<TE>   Since the Gulf War, the urban neighborhoods that had organized
themselves along tribal lines in the 1950s have been woven into
Hussein's network of tribal alliances. At the same time, the Iraqi
president has created a new category of tribes. Non-kinship groups
carrying labels of labor union, professional organization, trade
association, student group, art school and every other conceivable
economic or social organization now operate like tribes in alliance
with Hussein. The result is that Iraq today is a more tribal society
than it was at the time the country was pasted together by the
British.</TE>
<TE>   Yet the tribes have never totally surrendered to Hussein's
control. The Sunni tribes west of Baghdad govern Hussein as much as
he governs them. In ordinary times, they are satisfied as long as
they are allowed to control the trade routes to Syria. But they are
not to be trampled on. One of these tribes, the Dalaim, is suspected
of seriously wounding the president's oldest son, Uday, in 1996 in
retaliation for the arrest and execution of its principal sheik.
Other tribes also can threaten the regime if they choose.</TE>
<TE>   Hussein understands perhaps better than anyone else that the
tribes pose a real danger to him. Because tribes ally themselves only
with the strong, Hussein commands their allegiance only as long as
individual leaders gain advantage in the relationship. Consequently,
a perception of weakness undercuts the whole alliance. This is where
the Bush administration has an opportunity to achieve regime change
in Iraq without a war.</TE>
<TE>   Put United Nations arms inspectors back into Iraq. Their mere
presence, forced on Hussein by international pressure, creates the
perception that Hussein's power is waning. This, in turn, tempts
tribal leaders to withdraw their support from the Iraqi leader before
the alliance proves worthless and perhaps detrimental to their
interests. Without the support of the tribes, Hussein may be able to
retain control of the center of the country but not the periphery.
Once one pillar of his support crumbles, others are likely to follow.</TE>
<TE>   This will not happen by January, but over the time defined by the
current arms-inspection regimen, Hussein is likely to topple.
Allowing time for the forces of tribalism to destroy the regime of
Hussein is something for the Bush administration to think about
before it commits the lives of unknown numbers of American soldiers
and billions of dollars to a war in the Persian Gulf, with all of its
unintended consequences.</TE>

<HD>Musharraf's Win, Pakistan's Loss</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU>Paula R. Newberg</AU>
<BD>Paula R. Newberg is the author of "Judging the State:
Courts and Constitutional Politics in Pakistan."</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON -- Pakistan's politics often set the world on edge, and
this month's fundamentally flawed and predictably fragmented
elections are likely to annoy allies and enemies for years to come.
By manipulating every aspect of the polling, Pakistani President
Pervez Musharraf mocked the value of the elections, risked regional
security and set back the country's transition to civilian
government. This shameful episode has made it much harder for
Pakistanis to redeem the ideas of democracy and tolerance in a region
rife with social tension and terror.</LD>
<LD>   Since the coup that brought him to power three years ago,
Musharraf has routinely disparaged politics and the politicians who
practice it. He agreed to elections this year only because Pakistan's
courts and the international community demanded them. But he set the
rules to divide an already fractious polity to ensure that he would
retain preeminent power. The European Union, the British
Commonwealth, human-rights and democracy organizations in Pakistan
and outside it -- almost everyone except the U.S. government --
condemned his maneuverings long before polling day. Nonetheless,
Musharraf's ploy worked: No party secured a majority, and the
coalition that will soon emerge will undoubtedly diminish
parliament's future role.</LD>
<LD>   That's the bad news. But the sheer orneriness of Pakistan's
politics sent some interesting, mixed messages.</LD>
<TE>   First, many Pakistanis stayed home rather than vote, a clear slap
in the general's face.</TE>
<TE>   Second, local politics matters, even if it doesn't to Musharraf.
If the new government strays too far from basic concerns -- poverty,
education or the effects of terrorist bombing campaigns and
anti-terrorism actions on ordinary Pakistanis -- resistance is not
just possible but likely. By removing tribal leaders from their
accustomed perches, where they could pick and choose their fights
with the military, Musharraf opened the door to transnational Islamic
parties with little stake in familiar electoral politics.</TE>
<TE>   That's the third message: There is a newly empowered group of
religion-based parties that now rivals traditional secular leaders
and will figure prominently in any new government. This has already
set teeth grinding in Kabul, Delhi and Washington, where these
parties are seen as Taliban look-alikes that will compromise the
global war on terrorism and reinforce religious stricture in a
society desperate to modernize.</TE>
<TE>   To some voters, however, these parties challenged the military in
the borrowed language of democracy. In a political season notable for
the absence of substantive discussion, the religious parties raised
issues of foreign and domestic policy and stood firm on a return to
constitutional rule. This doesn't make them democrats, but for the
disenfranchised, it doesn't necessarily mean they're dictators,
either.</TE>
<TE>   Not that much democracy is being practiced in Pakistan these days:
No one was completely clean and open in the elections. While some of
the parties have labored for decades to win religion a place in
politics, others have spent recent times in criminal pursuits,
including murder and sectarian assassinations, setting fire to
Christian villages and communities of Muslim minority sects, and
implicating innocent citizens in trumped-up blasphemy charges that
carry mandatory death sentences. In doing so, they have exposed the
hypocrisies of Pakistani political life. After all, every government
of the last 30 years has tolerated or been complicit in such
behavior, and few politicians have lifted a hand to prevent the awful
constitutional mess now confronting Pakistan.</TE>
<TE>   Who rules whom, and how and why, is a problem that Pakistan's
leaders have been loath to solve. While an impoverished population
has borne the burdens of bad governance, almost no one has made an
effort to solve the country's disputes about secularism and religious
representation, democracy and dictatorship, and economic and
political equality all challenge the political system. The rise of
the religious right signals everything that is wrong with Pakistan's
electoral environment -- not because it was left out, as happened in
Algeria, or because its ideas about constitutional rule are always
dangerous, or because it will ineluctably work its way around to
renewed terrorism in the shadow of the Hindu Kush -- or because it
unexpectedly won so many seats. Rather, the rise of the right echoes
the misrule that has plagued Pakistan for so long.</TE>
<TE>   Today more than ever, government should matter in Pakistan.
Otherwise, every important issue will be left to soldiers and
foreigners to adjudicate according to calculations that rarely
benefit millions of rural poor. It matters in India, where ruling
ideologues countenance the slaughter of unarmed Muslims by Hindu mobs
and then blame neighboring Pakistan for the ignorance and desperation
of poor Indians and the increasing absence of compassion in the
Indian state. It matters in the sharply disputed regions of Kashmir,
where India and Pakistan battle in the name of religion and ideology,
and in Afghanistan, which now fears that Pakistan's religious
militants will try to fight their way back to Kabul. Government in
South Asia today rests on a foundation of token and broken promises.
Only government can fix the problems, and then only by respecting the
electoral rights of its citizens.</TE>
<TE>   Pakistan's election offered a chance to set a context for future
governance -- to change systematically the ways that Pakistanis
encounter elections -- but Musharraf chose instead to turn away. He
acted on the misconception that the Pakistani state is simply a place
and its people only an inconvenient afterthought, and then treated
this election as if it were only about tiny slips of ballot paper
rather than a symbol of sovereignty and human value.</TE>
<TE>   Musharraf acted as if he were irreplaceable. His opponents, some
soon to be found down the road in Parliament House, are likely to
think differently. Let us hope that when they do, they do so
democratically.</TE>

<BD>Wendy Orent writes frequently on infectious disease and
is writing a book about plague.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>ATLANTA -- Officially, smallpox strains exist only in the legitimate
World Health Organization repositories of Vector in Novosibirsk,
Russia, and the national Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
in Atlanta. But the people most familiar with the disease say they
almost certainly exist in other places as well. Intelligence reports
place the virus at the Russian military laboratories of Sergiyev
Posad and perhaps elsewhere in Russia. Many believe North Korea has
stores of the virus -- perhaps alluded to in that nation's
announcement last week that it has continued to pursue nuclear
weapons "and more."</LD>
<LD>   About Iraq's bioweapons program there has been little but hints
and rumors. Bioterror expert Michael Osterholm, formerly of the
Minnesota Department of Health, reports that Jordan's late King
Hussein told him "on his deathbed" that Iraq has the smallpox virus.
Laboratory equipment labeled "smallpox" was found in 1994 by United
Nations Special Commission inspectors, although Iraqi scientists said
the equipment was used only to prepare smallpox vaccine. They
admitted, however, to working with camelpox, a related virus that can
be used as a stand-in for smallpox in the laboratory.</LD>
<TE>   A declassified 1994 U.S. intelligence report states that the
Soviets passed "technology relating to smallpox and anthrax" to North
Korea and Iraq. The author of that report, a former intelligence
officer who wishes to remain anonymous, told me that he did not mean
that the virus itself had been passed to Iraq; "they wouldn't have
done that," he insists.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe. But, in any event, all this is circumstantial evidence,
reported in the press for years. Now there is reason to believe the
Bush administration has new cause for alarm about smallpox and Iraq.
This alarm, whispered about in high circles, has caused a major
policy change, quietly implemented in the last couple of weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the clear risks of the live smallpox vaccine, the Bush
administration is moving as quickly as supplies become available
toward offering voluntary smallpox vaccinations to the entire
country.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever the government now knows or suspects, the threat is real
enough to eliminate most informed opposition to rapid voluntary
immunization. The CDC, which has long promoted a strategy of "ring
vaccination" aimed at containing an epidemic after it occurs, has
dropped its reflexive opposition to the idea of pre-attack
vaccination.</TE>
<TE>   Even Donald A. Henderson, director of the World Health
Organization smallpox eradication campaign that eliminated smallpox
from nature in 1977, who is a longtime opponent of mass vaccination,
may be changing his position. He has publicly stated that the Bush
administration, in which he is a top public health advisor, is "very
worried" that Iraq has smallpox samples.</TE>
<TE>   Peter B. Jahrling, a chief smallpox scientist for the Department
of Defense, puts it more bluntly: "I think we're nuts not to offer
vaccination to the public immediately if we're about to go to war."
Israel has already begun vaccinating emergency workers based,
presumably, on intelligence estimates of its own.</TE>
<TE>   There are still holdouts against offering the vaccine to all
Americans. In last week's issue of the Journal of the American
Medical Assn., professor of pediatrics John M. Neff and his
co-authors presented a new analysis of adverse reactions among 11.8
million people vaccinated for the first time against smallpox in the
1960s, before routine vaccinations ceased.</TE>
<TE>   Smallpox vaccinations contain a live virus (vaccinia), which is
closely enough related to smallpox that it confers smallpox immunity
to anyone vaccinated. Most people have little or no adverse reaction
to the virus contained in the vaccination, but some -- particularly
those with weakened immune systems or even the common skin disease
eczema -- can develop full-blown vaccinia infections from the
injections.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, the virus can spread from person to person. Neff and his
colleagues found that for every 100,000 vaccinations, there were
between two and six instances of the virus spreading to unvaccinated
people, and some of these transmitted infections were fatal.</TE>
<TE>   Routine vaccination stopped in 1972 because scientists felt that
the risks from the vaccine were greater than the threat of smallpox.</TE>
<TE>   But in the eyes of the Bush administration, the threat of smallpox
now outweighs the risk of vaccination, with its possible attendant
liabilities of lawsuits and public anger. Would mass vaccinations
actually protect us from whatever it is the Iraqis have? Jahrling
says yes, that vaccinating even 60% of the population would
dramatically curb the virus' value as a weapon.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no point in launching a weapon that doesn't have a
target," he says. Furthermore, "even if we don't reach the entire
population, significant herd immunity would blunt epidemic spread of
the virus."</TE>
<TE>   But this assumes that what the Iraqis have is what Jahrling calls
"your mother's smallpox," the virus as we knew it before its
eradication. What if modern technologies have allowed Iraqi
bioweaponeers to produce a new, modified form that would evade
vaccine-induced immunity altogether?</TE>
<TE>   Such constructs have been created using related viruses: An
Australian team reported last year that it had inadvertently created
a deadly altered form of the virus -- a chimera -- by introducing a
gene for a mammalian immune protein, interleukin 4, into mousepox.</TE>
<TE>   Among mice that were genetically resistant to mousepox and who
were immunized with a weakened strain of the same disease, 60% (three
of five) died after they were injected with the new chimera. This
startling result -- a genetic modification to a virus that appeared
to overcome vaccine-induced and natural immunity -- worried many
experts, who feared that the same results could be achieved with the
smallpox virus.</TE>
<TE>   Furthermore, as I reported in this section a year ago, Sergei
Popov, a former Soviet bioweapons researcher at the Vector
Laboratory, hand-synthesized the DNA for a number of human immune
chemicals in the mid-1980s, introducing it into smallpox vaccine and
into mousepox as a stand-in for smallpox.</TE>
<TE>   He had every intention, he says, of marching through all the
interleukins, but he stopped after interleukin 2 when he left Vector.
The technology to make smallpox chimeras with interleukins,
therefore, has existed for a long time, and it is not unreasonable to
suppose that Iraq could have this capacity.</TE>
<TE>   But, as former Soviet bioweaponeer Igor Domaradskij puts it, "It
is not so simple" to make a workable genetically altered bioweapon.</TE>
<TE>   Attempts to repeat the Australian experiment with mousepox have
been ambiguous. Mark Buller of St. Louis University replicated the
experiment -- but he gave his genetically resistant mice stronger
vaccine-induced immunity before infecting them with interleukin 4
mousepox. His mice did not die. "It's one thing to engineer the
construct," says Buller. "It's another to get the result you are
looking for."</TE>
<TE>   We also don't know what would happen if someone added interleukin
4 to smallpox. "The disease course of [smallpox] in man is totally
different from [mousepox] in mice," says Buller. We don't even know
what happens to a chimeric virus in a population: Would the added
genes drop out, or would the disease fail to transmit at all?</TE>
<TE>   Buller plans to test his construct's staying power by introducing
it into a mouse colony and letting it spread -- if it does spread.
But even those results won't mean much for smallpox, as the diseases
are spread through entirely different routes.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think any of these concerns should preclude mass
vaccination right now," says Jahrling. Chimeric viruses may represent
a threat in the future, as science better understands how to make
stable constructs that can spread.</TE>
<TE>   It is possible that someday the smallpox vaccine may not be
enough. We may need more sophisticated vaccines, or antiviral drugs,
as a critical second line of defense. But until then, it would be
very foolish not to protect against a real danger for fear of a
chimerical one.</TE>

<HD>A Media Mouse That Roared</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU>Jill Stewart</AU>
<BD>Jill Stewart is a former columnist for New Times Los
Angeles.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When Mike Lacey, owner of the New Times newspaper chain, sat down
with the editorial staff of New Times Los Angeles three weeks ago and
told us he had the worst possible news for us all, my first thought
was, "Oh, no, Lacey has cancer."</LD>
<LD>   With only 20 full-time writers, editors, photographers and other
editorial employees, New Times was a full-throated, outsized voice in
a tremendously meek media town. Many of us saw our noisy weekly paper
as indispensable to the battle over how to shape this troubled city
-- and we felt invincible because of it.</LD>
<LD>   New Times writers like Michael Gougis, Susan Goldsmith, Tony
Ortega, Ron Russell, Rick Barrs and others were raking in big
journalism awards that often went to major dailies. Talk shows and
Hollywood agents were clamoring for access to our investigative
revelations. Most important, we were hated by all the right people.</LD>
<TE>   But there was also that other thing: red ink.</TE>
<TE>   After Sept. 11, advertising sales dropped off dramatically as
cautious national advertisers cut back and never re-upped. Since the
newspaper was free to readers, advertising was all there was to
support the operation. So New Times came to an agreement with Village
Voice Media, which owns the LA Weekly: Village Voice Media would pay
New Times an undisclosed sum and fold its paper in Cleveland, where
it competes with a New Times paper, and New Times would fold its
paper here.</TE>
<TE>   I look out on the media landscape of Los Angeles and I mourn not
merely the passing of a great, gutsy newspaper but also the state of
the media in the country's second-largest city. The New Times chain
puts out the only alternative weeklies that hit the news harder with
each passing year. Other alternative newspapers have become
increasingly soft and mired in out-of-touch 1970s-era liberal
Democratic mantras. The Village Voice rarely breaks or illuminates
the news anymore. And the paper controlled locally by the Voice,
rightly dubbed the "L.A. Weakly," frets so about hewing to ancient
leftist cant that it is incapable of pursuing most of the juicy and
endless stories that offend black liberals, Latino liberals,
laboristas, feministas and the like.</TE>
<TE>   New Times reveled in offending those liberal interest groups,
whose power far outstrips their numbers. But it wasn't merely that we
delighted in annoying people -- although we did love that fringe
benefit. No, we were engaged in a crucial business. We were trying to
put an end to outrageous assumptions and activities that we believed
were helping drive L.A. into the ground.</TE>
<TE>   And we did it, time and again. New Times staff meetings often
touched on how the local media were not plundering the amazing riches
of controversies here, and might just as well have been covering Des
Moines. Investigative reporter Goldsmith wrote bravely about tough
racial truths in her cover story "Blacks Only," which reported on
overt racism practiced against nonblack doctors by the black power
elite who run King-Drew Medical Center. Her investigation into
indefensible practices by L.A. County workers to prevent interracial
adoptions won her the Casey Medal for Meritorious Journalism, but the
story died on the local 11 o'clock news.</TE>
<TE>   The media in Los Angeles for years missed the story of pedophile
priests who betrayed both their faith and their followers. But when
it finally started to come out, our reporter Russell did, for my
money, the best job of explaining how Cardinal Roger Mahony had for
years deviously covered up for these priests and allowed them to
continue working around children. Russell won the Silver Medallion
from the California Bar Assn. for his probe into the Mexican Mafia.
When New Times closed its doors, Russell was working on yet another
disturbing Mahony piece that everyone should have read.</TE>
<TE>   I like to think that my columns, in which I regularly exposed
educational malpractice within the Los Angeles Unified School
District (or L.A. Mummified, as I called it), played a role in
persuading voters to oust a shameful school board controlled by a
teachers union that cared only about pay. The new reformist board has
dramatically raised reading ability among inner-city and immigrant
grade-schoolers -- practically a modern miracle -- due in no small
part to the abandonment of those twin anathemas of education:
whole-language reading instruction and bilingual education.</TE>
<TE>   New Times circulation had reached about 115,000 when it ceased
publication, so most of the 3.65 million Angelenos never saw our
coverage. Much of our power to influence these debates derived from
the fact that we were widely read by print, radio, online and TV
journalists. We took credit for educating those reporters to meatier
news in a town that was drowning in journalistic pablum.</TE>
<TE>   We became known as an institution that refused to behave itself.
We took on the sacred cows, like multimillionaire developer Danny
Bakewell, state Assemblywoman Jackie Goldberg (D-Los Angeles), state
Sen. Kevin Murray (D-Culver City), Mahony, L.A. County Supervisor
Gloria Molina and the whole crew of cookie-cutter elected liberal
Democrats who control the L.A. City Council and legislative seats in
Sacramento.</TE>
<TE>   It was interesting to watch people's reactions. Some hated us,
prayed for us to disappear. Others, although certainly not happy with
our coverage of them, came to like New Times because it skewered
their enemies, too. We were equal-opportunity lambasters. We just
wanted to force crucial issues into the open, to keep our massive
region from devolving into a West Coast urban nightmare a la Detroit.</TE>
<TE>   When the Daily News wrote of New Times' end, it quoted former
Mayor Richard Riordan, who called it "a horrible event." Even more
surprising to some, he praised editor Rick Barrs' column, The Finger
-- even though it had regularly attacked Riordan as a weak mayor
controlled by puppeteers, dubbing him Mayor Howdy Doody. He was right
to praise The Finger, the column that broke, among many other things,
news of the Los Angeles Times' unethical production of a magazine
about Staples Center in which profits generated by the magazine were
shared with Staples Center. "I felt The Finger's finger many times,"
Riordan told the Daily News. "I thought The Finger was right on,
didn't respect anybody."</TE>
<TE>   That was almost, but not entirely, true of all of us at New Times.
Lacey hired us six years ago with the promise that if we unearthed
uncomfortable truths, he would print them. He granted us incredible
freedom. But some members of the power elite won our respect. A
handful told the truth, fought hard to make the world a better place
and rarely acted merely for themselves. They included school board
member David Tokofsky, former state legislator Tom Hayden and even
the bumbling but popular Riordan (who once excitedly approached Barrs
at a party, offered up a dramatic handshake and loudly cried out,
"Howdy!").</TE>
<TE>   Riordan keeps threatening to launch his own weekly newspaper. He
has, full disclosure requires me to reveal, raised the possibility of
my being involved if he goes forward. I don't know, in the end, what
I'll do next, but I certainly agree with one thing Riordan recently
told me: "L.A. needs a paper that is controversial and gets people
mad and talking about people and power. New York has several like
that. But now, Los Angeles has none."</TE>
<TE>   The Daily News comes closest but is confined to the San Fernando
Valley and needs a much bigger staff if it is ever to consistently go
after in-depth issues. Besides my devotion to on-target Daily News
City Hall reporter Rick Orlov and the courageous Larry Elder on
KABC-AM radio, I now look to a precious few insightful TV reporters
like Channel 2's Joel Grover, Channel 11's John Schwada and Channel
9's Dave Bryan to give us the quick and dirty on what is really
happening in this lushly complicated society we call Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   It shouldn't be this way in the second-largest media market in the
country. I am looking out at this desert of a media landscape, and I
am praying for rain.</TE>

<LD>A number of adults with developmental disabilities will have a new
place to call home beginning this week, when they take up residence
in a newly constructed complex of affordable apartments in Pasadena.</LD>
<LD>   The 13-unit development, designed specifically for the needs of
the disabled, is the culmination of seven years' work by United
Cerebral Palsy, which lined up the partners to make the complex a
reality, said Ronald Cohen, executive director of United Cerebral
Palsy of Los Angeles, Ventura and Santa Barbara counties.</LD>
<LD>   "Without this apartment complex, these tenants would be living in
institutions or licensed care facilities or with their parents,"
Cohen said.</LD>
<TE>   The nonprofit advocacy group, in partnership with the Department
of Housing and Urban Development, Los Angeles County, the city of
Pasadena and others, raised the $2.7 million to build the project.</TE>
<TE>   The tenants' rents are set by HUD and are one-third of their
adjusted incomes, Cohen said. For some tenants, that could be as low
as $150 a month.</TE>
<TE>   United Cerebral Palsy has three other affordable-housing projects
in the works in Santa Monica, Goleta and Burbank.</TE>

<HD>Access Davis-Stirling Act on Web</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Stephen Glassman and Donie Vanitzian</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Question: Every time I see or hear the words Davis-Stirling Act, I
wonder how it got that name. Can you tell me? Where can I get a copy
of it?</LD>
<LD>   Answer: Then-Assemblyman Gray Davis and then-state Sen. Lawrence
W. Stirling were co-authors of what became the Davis-Stirling Act,
which governs common interest developments in California. Davis is
now the governor and Stirling is a San Diego Superior Court judge.</LD>
<LD>   If you have access to the Internet, you can download a copy of the
1985 Davis-Striling Act by logging on to www.leginfo.ca.gov, then
clicking on the "California law" button. Place a check mark next to
"civil code" and in the search box, type "Davis-Stirling." Click on
search and the result should be the full text of the act. Either
print it or download it to your computer.</LD>
<TE>   You should repeat that process every year to ensure you have the
latest version.</TE>
<TE>   Board could bar owner from pool</TE>
<TE>   Question: I live in a complex of more than 75 condominiums in
Southern California. I weigh just under 400 pounds and have decided
to lose weight. As part of staying healthy, my doctor told me I
should swim every day.</TE>
<TE>   Even though I've lived here for nine years, I have never used the
pool. I figured that since my dues are used for the upkeep, I could
swim in it.</TE>
<TE>   But after the first time I went swimming, a board member told me
to "get out of the pool." He said that my using the pool is a "hazard
to everyone in the complex" and that I am a "liability to the
association."</TE>
<TE>   I have no idea if any of my neighbors complained or if it's just
the board, but I am very hurt and embarrassed. Can he do anything to
me, and can he stop me from using the pool that I pay for? Can I go
back in the pool?</TE>
<TE>   Answer: Home buyers purchase into common-interest developments
believing they will share amenities and maintenance by paying a
monthly fee. That includes using the pool.</TE>
<TE>   Your board member neighbor needs to respect your right to use the
pool but, if he chooses not to, you may ignore him and continue your
daily swim.</TE>
<TE>   The fact that you pay for an amenity, however, does not
automatically guarantee the right to use it. As outrageous as it may
sound, your board probably can prevent you from using the pool, but
not because a board member claims that you are a hazard to other
homeowners. The board needs to have a "reasonable" basis for barring
you from using the pool, regardless of this member's pronouncements.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to being rude, the board member's statement might also
constitute a slander, subjecting him and the board to an action by
you for damages.</TE>
<TE>   It is probable that your governing documents provide that "any"
owner, and the owner's family and guests, may use the pool and other
amenities.</TE>
<TE>   Ignoring the board member could increase his efforts to keep you
out of the pool. His first step might be to have the board label you
a "disgruntled" or "complaining" homeowner. The board could create
rules and regulations meant to exclude only you but without actually
mentioning you by name. Fines might follow for disobeying those
rules.</TE>
<TE>   The way the Davis-Stirling Act stands today, the board cannot
foreclose on your home for failure to pay the fines, but that does
not mean it will not try, nor does it mean the board cannot place a
lien on your unit.</TE>
<TE>   Should you be threatened with a lien or fines, immediately seek
the advice of an attorney.</TE>
<TE>   Hopefully, your board will see the common sense inherent in
minding its own business when it comes to an owner's use of the
complex's shared amenities in the manner for which they were
intended.</TE>

<HD>Toluca Lake, where the stars meet the water</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Diane Wedner</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Known for its pedestrian-friendly village of stores and restaurants,
79-year-old Toluca Lake has, since its inception, attracted
celebrities and others who love the upscale East Coast feel of the
neighborhood. Centrally located, Toluca Lake is surrounded by
Universal City, North Hollywood and Burbank in the east San Fernando
Valley.</LD>
<LD>   Drawing card</LD>
<LD>   The town of about 3,000 residents has leafy streets with older,
architecturally interesting homes, about 30 of which face the lake.
Stars such as Bing Crosby and Bob Hope originally were attracted to
the neighborhood's exclusivity and private golf club. Those
amenities, plus the town's proximity to Universal, Warner Bros. and
Disney studios and three television networks are a draw today for
stars such as Andy Garcia, Wayne Knight, Daman Wayans and others in
the entertainment industry.</LD>
<TE>   Wow factor</TE>
<TE>   The lake, which covers about 5 acres, is stocked with fish but is
closed to the public. It was used in the filming of the "Our Gang"
series.</TE>
<TE>   Report card</TE>
<TE>   Public schools in Toluca Lake are part of the Los Angeles Unified
School District. The two elementary schools are not the strong suit
here, but Walter Reed Middle School is known for its Individualized
Honors Program for gifted children, and nearby North Hollywood High
School draws students citywide to its Highly Gifted Magnet and the
Biological Sciences/Zoo Magnet programs.</TE>
<TE>   Good news, bad news</TE>
<TE>   The town's proximity to the Ventura and Hollywood freeways makes
for easy access to Pasadena, Hollywood and downtown Los Angeles but
is a source of noise and smog.</TE>
<TE>   Universal City is within walking distance, so families have a safe
place to go at night for movies and other entertainment. However,
some of the entertainment complex's attractions are noisy and can be
heard from residents' backyards.</TE>
<TE>   Insider information</TE>
<TE>   At Halloween, residents should be armed with pounds of candy to
hand out to the hundreds of children who come to the neighborhood
each fall to trick-or-treat and walk through haunted houses created
by the locals.</TE>
<TE>   Hot spots</TE>
<TE>   Homes on the lake and golf course are highly desirable but rarely
on the market. Homes south of Moorpark Street, such as those on
Mariota Avenue, Forman Avenue and Talofa Avenue, are in strong demand
and range from $700,000 to $1.6 million.</TE>
<TE>   They typically are on the market for 60 to 90 days.</TE>
<TE>   Housing stock</TE>
<TE>   The community is made up primarily of single-family residences
built in the '30s and '40s, from smaller white-picket-fence homes to
huge estates.</TE>
<TE>   There also are about 50 condominiums and townhomes and some
apartment rentals, mostly on Riverside Drive, Cahuenga Boulevard and

<LD>Oscar winner's taking his sled on the road</LD>
<LD>   James Coburn, who co-starred earlier this year with Cuba Gooding
Jr. in the movie "Snow Dogs" and will co-star with Gooding again in
the 2003 sequel, and his wife, Paula, have listed their Beverly
Hills-area home at $5.9 million.</LD>
<LD>   The actor, who won a best supporting actor Academy Award for his
role as Nick Nolte's alcoholic father in "Affliction" (1998), and his
wife want a smaller home as they plan to do some traveling.</LD>
<TE>   They have owned their Beverly Hills-area home since 1991, when it
was built.</TE>
<TE>   The five-bedroom, 11,728-square-foot home has a master suite with
his-and-hers marble baths, a den, a library-study, dining and
breakfast rooms, a bar, a basement, a sauna and a Pilates room.</TE>
<TE>   The gated five-story estate has an elevator and sweeping views of
the city. There is a pool on the half-acre grounds.</TE>
<TE>   Coburn, 74, plays a crusty novelist married to a much younger
woman in the just-released "The Man From Elysian Fields," produced by
Andy Garcia and co-starring Mick Jagger and Anjelica Huston.</TE>
<TE>   Joyce Flaherty of Coldwell Banker, Beverly Hills South, has the
listing.</TE>
<TE>   This good sport is hoping to sell, period</TE>
<TE>   Tom Arnold, co-host of the Fox Sports Network show "Best Damn
Sports Show Period," has put his Beverly Hills-area home on the
market at $3.25 million.</TE>
<TE>   The actor-comedian listed the home at about $3.4 million in May
2001 but took it off the market about a year ago. Now he and his
bride of a few months, political consultant Shelby Roos, want a new
place to call home.</TE>
<TE>   Arnold has owned the house he listed since June 1998, when he
bought it from singer-actress Paula Abdul. He was divorced from
hairstylist Julie Champnella in 1999. His earlier, much-publicized
marriage to TV star Roseanne ended in 1994.</TE>
<TE>   The 6,800-square-foot house, built in 1990, has a master suite
with a sitting room, a terrace and two walk-in closets. The home also
has three other family bedrooms plus a maid's quarters, gym, wine
cellar, family room and pool.</TE>
<TE>   The Spanish villa-style house is at the end of a cul-de-sac in a
gated community.</TE>
<TE>   Arnold, 43, joined the Fox Sports show in 2001. He starred in the
WB sitcom "The Tom Show" from 1997 to 1998. He was acclaimed for his
supporting role opposite Arnold Schwarzenegger in the James Cameron
movie "True Lies" in 1994.</TE>
<TE>   Arnold's autobiography, "How to Lose Six Pounds in Five Years," is
expected to be published in November. He appears with Jet Li in the
movie "Cradle 2 the Grave," due out this fall.</TE>
<TE>   Stephen Shapiro at Westside Estate Agency, Beverly Hills, has the
listing.</TE>
<TE>   Home of the original Ozzie sold</TE>
<TE>   Ron Fair, president of A&amp;M Records, has sold his traditional-style
Hollywood home for $2.2 million.</TE>
<TE>   The five-bedroom, 5,200-square-foot house was the home for many
years of Ozzie and Harriet Nelson, and the front of the house
appeared weekly at the beginning of the Nelsons' ABC series, "The
Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet," which marked its debut 50 years
ago.</TE>
<TE>   Fair, who signed and produced Christina Aguilera, had owned the
home since 1993. The house, built in 1916, has been updated in recent
years and has a refurbished kitchen and four bathrooms.</TE>
<TE>   Fair has relocated to a newly built modern-style residence
designed by Michael Mueller that he purchased for about $3.1million.
William Rose of Westside Estate Agency, Beverly Hills, had the
listing on the house Fair sold and represented Fair in buying his new
home, which Alexis Valentin had listed at Sotheby's International
Realty, Beverly Hills.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile back on the ranch ...</TE>
<TE>   Glen Larson, a producer of such '70s and '80s hit series as
"McCloud," "Quincy," "Magnum, P.I.," "Knight Rider" and "The Six
Million Dollar Man," has sold his Bel-Air home for $6.3 million. He
is moving to a ranch he owns in the San Fernando Valley.</TE>
<TE>   The Bel-Air house has six bedrooms and 10 bathrooms in 13,000
square feet. The 1927 home, on almost an acre, is walled and gated.
Its floor-to-ceiling glass walls overlook the Bel-Air Country Club.</TE>
<TE>   The home also has a 35-millimeter screening room, a master suite
with his-and-hers baths, a pool area with rolling lawns, a
two-bedroom guest house and a wine cellar.</TE>
<TE>   Larson, 64, is also a director, a composer of film and TV theme
music, a screenwriter and a novelist. He was a member of the Four
Preps singing group during the 1950s.</TE>
<TE>   Elaine Young and Barbara Eisner at DBL, Beverly Hills, had the
listing. Dee Crawford of Re/Max represented the buyers.</TE>

<LD>Question: The rental property I live in is for sale and the real
estate agent has given my telephone number to prospective buyers.
People are calling me at work to set up appointments to view the
property. I don't want these people calling me. What can I do?</LD>
<LD>   Answer: The agent should not have given out your personal or work
phone numbers. Ask him or her to stop. When selling an occupied
rental, there are procedures to follow. For example, you can request
that a lockbox not be put on the door and that you be present for all
agreed-to showings. For the agent, this means setting up convenient
appointments, respecting your privacy and accommodating your needs.
You can insist that "showings" be limited to normal business hours,
with at least 24 hours notice, or you can work out a mutually
acceptable schedule.</LD>
<LD>   Extra step ensures timely payment</LD>
<TE>   Question: My apartment complex has a new owner. For the last four
years I've been paying my rent directly at the management office's
address on the first business day of each month, even though my lease
allows a three-day grace period. The new landlord has sent me a
notice requesting that I now mail the rent to her out-of-town
address. The notice also said the late fee will be charged if the
rent is not received by the first of each month. I don't know how I
can ensure the rent is received on the first of each month, and I
don't want to pay a late fee. What can I do?</TE>
<TE>   Answer: Since you have a lease, the grace period cannot be changed
or eliminated during the period of your lease. Additionally, Civil
Code 1961 (f) states: "If the address provided by the owner does not
allow for personal delivery, then it shall be conclusively presumed
that upon the mailing of any rent or notice to the owner by the
tenant to the name and address provided, the notice or rent is deemed
receivable by the owner on the date posted, if the tenant can show
proof of mailing to the name and address provided by the owner." You
can mail the rent payment on or before the first of each month at the
post office and request a "certificate of mailing," also known as a
"proof of mailing." This will satisfy the civil code requirement and
ensure that your rent is considered paid on the day it was mailed.</TE>
<TE>   Calculating the extended rent</TE>
<TE>   Question: A tenant who is scheduled to move out needs an
additional week because her new apartment is not ready. What amount
of rent can I charge her for this additional week?</TE>
<TE>   Answer: If her rental agreement specifies a "holdover" rent
amount, you can use this amount to determine a daily rental rate. If
the agreement does not specify a holdover amount, then you must
charge a daily rental rate that accurately reflects the rent in
effect. Divide either the current rent or the holdover rent amount by
30 to determine the daily rental rate. Then multiply this daily
rental rate by the number of additional days the tenant is
requesting. This is the amount of rent the tenant will owe.</TE>
<TE>   Whenever there is an extension of a 30-day notice to move, it is
recommended that the agreement be put in writing. This way all
parties understand that the 30-day notice is "extended" only.</TE>

<HD>No more home work with a brand-new start</HD>
<DH>After failing to fix their last fixer-upper, a family opts
to buy in a new Arcadia development.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Kathy Price-Robinson</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Buying a newly built home, like the two-story Craftsman that Ronnie
and Teresa Sarmiento moved into earlier this month, never occurred to
the couple when they started their home search a few years ago.</LD>
<LD>   Motivated to purchase when their first child was born in 2000, the
couple figured they could pay about $250,000. But they quickly became
discouraged with the townhouses, tiny houses and fixer-uppers that
populated their price range.</LD>
<LD>   Those homes, Ronnie recalled, "were too expensive, too small and
not worth our time."</LD>
<TE>   Plus, the couple had discovered they had no interest in fixing up
a house after five years of renting a 1950s 900-square-foot home in
Echo Park from Teresa's mother. Grand plans to upgrade the bungalow
never materialized, and the complications of new parenthood made
repairing a house even more unlikely.</TE>
<TE>   "It's too overwhelming," Ronnie, 34, said of home improvement.
"I'd like to start with a clean slate, not start behind the eight
ball."</TE>
<TE>   By the time news came that the couple's second child would arrive
late in 2001, they had approached a mortgage broker to calculate
exactly what they could afford. They were surprised to discover the
amount was much higher than they thought, up to $350,000.</TE>
<TE>   "Are you sure?" asked Teresa, 31, a licensed optician. "Did you do
the math right?" wondered Ronnie, an engineer.</TE>
<TE>   With the increased budget, and offers from Teresa's family to help
with a down payment, the couple started considering new homes,
particularly those within commuting distance of Ronnie's job in El
Segundo and Teresa's job in Northridge.</TE>
<TE>   Flipping through the newspaper, Teresa discovered a development in
Huntington Beach that offered a few homes in the couple's price
range. Visiting the site, they found little more than surveyors'
stakes and an office trailer. There were already 20 people on the
buyer list, but without model homes to look at, the couple hesitated
to sign up. Not long afterward, they heard the list had grown to more
than 300.</TE>
<TE>   In August 2001, Teresa noticed an ad announcing that information
would be "coming soon" about a Greystone Homes development in
Arcadia, at the foot of the San Gabriel Mountains. By October, the ad
gave more details, including the sizes of the houses being offered,
from 1,830 to 2,398 square feet, and the location of the development.
Even though construction had not started, the couple drove out to see
the 15-acre site.</TE>
<TE>   "I had to know what was there before," said Teresa, who learned
the site had been used as a drive-in theater from the 1950s until it
closed in 1995.</TE>
<TE>   Not wanting to miss out, the Sarmientos resolved to be at the head
of the line when the first of eight phases of homes was to be offered
for sale in November. At that time, the model homes would be ready to
view.</TE>
<TE>   But with the new baby due and a flurry of doctor appointments, the
couple didn't make it back to the sales office until two weeks after
the opening. With 125 houses for sale, there were already 132 buyers
on the list.</TE>
<TE>   The models, representing the four floor plans offered, impressed
the couple. They especially liked No. 3, which has 2,200 square feet,
a two-story ceiling in the living room, four bedrooms, including one
downstairs, three baths, a family room with media cove, a computer
niche built into a hallway and an upstairs laundry room.</TE>
<TE>   Teresa was taken with the opulence of the master bedroom, large
walk-in closet and spacious master bathroom.</TE>
<TE>   With a price tag of $310,000, the model was within the couple's
budget. However, the Sarmientos would learn, the price would rise
with each phase release, according to what the market would bear,
meaning the last buyers in the tract could end up paying $100,000
more than the first buyers for the same floor plan.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the number of buyers ahead of them, sales consultant Steve
Merryman told the couple that if they got on the list, they would
likely get a home as others would drop off for various reasons. The
eight phases would be offered at intervals of six weeks as crews
built the houses.</TE>
<TE>   According to Merryman, each developer decides how the waiting list
is set up. Some choose a first-come, first-served system for each
phase, which often results in buyers camping out to be first in line
for the next phase. Others choose a lottery system, where random
numbers are called for each phase.</TE>
<TE>   Merryman prefers yet another system, in which numbers simply are
called in the order that the buyers signed up, without requiring a
sign-up for each phase.</TE>
<TE>   To get on the list, buyers are asked to fill out a one-page
application that gives the company permission to run a credit check,
and buyers must supply a recent bank statement showing that the funds
for the down payment are available and not contingent on the sale of
another house.</TE>
<TE>   To familiarize themselves with the process, the Sarmientos
attended each phase release, viewing it as a fun outing with Aaron,
now 2 1/2, and Madison, 9 months. The sales consultants offered the
buyers refreshments on picnic tables.</TE>
<TE>   With each phase release, the Sarmientos worried that prices would
eventually rise above what they could afford. When their number came
up during the fifth phase release, in March, there was only one Model
No. 3 left, and it was priced $15,000 more than other No. 3s because
it would be built on a corner lot across from a small park.</TE>
<TE>   Hesitating only briefly at the price tag close to $380,000, the
couple said, "We'll take it." Thirty minutes later, the paperwork was
done.</TE>
<TE>   By combining their savings and with help from family, the couple
were able to offer $90,000 as a down payment. To simplify the
process, they used the mortgage, escrow, title and insurance
companies the builders recommended.</TE>
<TE>   Two weeks later, the Sarmientos visited a design center in Yorba
Linda to select cabinets, counters, carpets and other items. To
accommodate their active children, they opted for upgraded carpet and
thicker padding. Upgraded tile was selected for the entryway, kitchen
and two bathrooms.</TE>
<TE>   The Corian counters in the kitchen were sufficient, so an upgrade
to granite was passed over. "Not a priority," Ronnie said.</TE>
<TE>   Once building began, the couple visited the site about every two
weeks. In June, the foundation was poured, the house was framed and a
stack of drywall sat in what would one day be the frontyard. The
superintendent pointed out the earthquake reinforcement required in
new homes, and the couple could see where all the wiring and plumbing
were located.</TE>
<TE>   "We wouldn't see that with a used house," Teresa said.</TE>
<TE>   During July, the windows were hung, the exterior was lathed and
ready for plaster, and concrete roof tiles were piled overhead. The
house was plastered on the outside and drywalled on the inside.</TE>
<TE>   In August, the exterior and exterior trim were completed, the
interior doors hung, and walls and ceilings painted. The roof also
went on, the driveway was poured and the frontyard started to take
shape.</TE>
<TE>   On an early September visit, the couple saw that the cherry-toned
kitchen cabinets and the gray Corian had been installed, and the
rock-faced fireplace in the adjacent family room was finished.</TE>
<TE>   In the gated community, the Sarmientos now have access to a
community swimming pool and barbecue area. Homeowner dues are $107 a
month, which includes basic cable service.</TE>
<TE>   The new location will add about 15 minutes to each of their
commute times, and Ronnie has already found a carpool partner so he
can travel the carpool lanes.</TE>
<TE>   The downside of buying the newly built home is the small size of
the lot (3,380 square feet), which eliminates the large backyard they
wanted for their children.</TE>
<TE>   "That was one of our sacrifices," Ronnie said.</TE>
<TE>   But overall the experience has been positive, Teresa said. "For
us, it's really exciting."</TE>

<LD>Question: We have an upstairs bathroom floor with termites and a
history of asthma in the family. A termite inspection has confirmed
the need for fumigation, but we are hesitant. We've contacted a pest
control company that uses nitrogen to freeze out termites from
localized home infestations. What do you think of this method?</LD>
<LD>   Answer: You are among the growing number of homeowners who are
seeking less toxic alternatives to the conventional methods of
dealing with household pests.</LD>
<LD>   According to Sheila Darr, executive director of the Bio-Integral
Resource Center, a nonprofit organization formed in 1978 to provide
practical information on least-toxic methods for managing pests, the
effectiveness of the liquid nitrogen method is not as well-documented
as some of the other alternatives.</LD>
<TE>   Darr said one of the most effective and least-toxic alternatives
uses heat. This is a system wherein propane space heaters blow hot
air through ducts into a tented structure, raising the temperature
enough to kill the termites.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, the heat is not supposed to harm the structure or its
contents. It might, however, be a good idea to remove any valuables
and electronic equipment susceptible to damage by heat. Technicians
also warn that candles or thin sheets of plastic should be removed.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Home prices in Southern California set a new peak last month, the
result of steady demand and affordable mortgage financing, according
to DataQuick Information Services.</LD>
<LD>   The median price Southland buyers paid for a home was $279,000 in
September. That was up 0.4% from $278,000 for August and up 18.2%
from $236,000 for September 2001. The year-over-year increase was the
strongest since the late 1980s.</LD>
<LD>   Sales counts were strong but not record-breaking. A total of
26,216 new and resale houses and condos were sold in Los Angeles,
Riverside, San Diego, Ventura, San Bernardino and Orange counties in
September. That was down 14.7% from 30,732 for August and up 5.8%
from 24,777 for September 2001.</LD>
<TE>   A decline in sales from August to September is normal for the
season.</TE>

<LD>Major cities nationwide are moving toward decentralization, according
to a new survey of census data released by the Brookings Institution
Center on Urban and Metropolitan Policy.</LD>
<LD>   The study's findings show that revitalized central business
districts in the 100 largest cities are often "islands" surrounded by
neighborhoods experiencing significant population decay, and that 62%
of all major-city population growth occurred along suburban borders,
compared with just 11% in the city cores.</LD>

they rocked their babies and distracted their toddlers.</LD>
<LD>   ''Do you really want to do this?'' Garcia asked. ''I want to make
sure there's a real commitment. I don't want to start something and
then have it become a failure.'' Heads nodded; they were in.</LD>
<TE>   But two weeks later, with many of the same women gathered at the
East Los Angeles school, that commitment seemed to be ebbing fast.
PTA rules require at least 11 dues-paying members to form a chapter
and elect officers, but only eight parents at this largely poor,
largely Latino school had paid the $5 fee. When a representative from
the PTA's downtown office asked whether anyone else wanted to sign
up, for several awkward minutes the only sound in the auditorium came
from a squeaky stroller being rolled back and forth to calm a
restless baby. Then two mothers came forward with $5 bills. They had
10. Finally, Belvedere's assistant principal, Robert Martinez, pulled
out his wallet, became the 11th member, and the elections got
underway. A less than roaring start. When the meeting ended, the new
Belvedere PTA had its first president in many years, a shyly beaming
Veronica Salazar, a mother of two studying for her teaching
credential.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles Unified School District leaders insist that parental
involvement is a key component of student success, and until the
1980s, the Parent Teacher Assn. had a near-monopoly on this
mission--nationally and locally. But where the PTA was once a
powerful presence, with chapters at most Los Angeles schools, the
organization has fallen on hard times, with only about one-third of
the district's campuses able to recruit enough parents to sustain a
chapter.</TE>
<TE>   The easy explanation is that today's working mothers aren't
available to clean paintbrushes during the day, as housewives were in
decades past, and they are too bushed at night to attend planning
meetings for the holiday pageant. But the roots of the PTA's current
troubles are more complicated than that. Many immigrant parents such
as some of those at Belvedere come from countries without a strong
tradition of school volunteerism. In addition, 1978's Proposition 13
sharply cut into school revenues, compelling parents at many schools
to concentrate their energies on fund-raising booster clubs to
replace services--such as art teachers and regular maintenance--that
earlier generations took for granted. These clubs that have sprung up
on wealthier campuses have eclipsed the PTA. Every dollar they raise
stays on campus while a big chunk of the money that PTA parents raise
must be distributed among regional, state and national offices.</TE>
<TE>   The LAUSD's stubbornly low test scores and its mantra of parental
involvement continue to draw extraordinarily dedicated parents to the
PTA, giving rise to cautious talk of an eventual comeback. Yet at
schools like Belvedere, the PTA is struggling just to gain traction.
Is there a future in Los Angeles for the organization that was
ubiquitous on campus in the era before blackboards became whiteboards
and recess became nutrition?</TE>
<TE>   The PTA is the nation's oldest and largest volunteer child
advocacy organization. Founded in 1897 as the National Congress of
Mothers, its mission was to promote the education and welfare of all
children--a mission that has not changed. Along with marshaling
volunteers and raising money in local schools, the PTA has taken the
lead in addressing child welfare issues. In the 1950s, it helped
organize the testing of the polio vaccine and the mass inoculation of
schoolchildren. In the '60s, the PTA opposed tobacco advertising and
produced public service messages on the dangers of drug use; in the
'70s, the PTA created a school curriculum on the effects of media
violence on children. Today, the PTA runs dental and vision clinics
open to any needy LAUSD student. Last year, dentists and optometrists
at these clinics served 7,000 children, filling cavities and fitting
kids with proper eyeglasses.</TE>
<TE>   Nationwide membership peaked about 40 years ago at 12 million. As
the decline continued, the PTA, originally a white organization,
merged with the National Congress of Colored Parents and Teachers,
prompting still more members to resign in protest. In the meantime,
moms were heading to the office, school budgets were imploding and
student populations, especially in big city districts, were becoming
more diverse. By the early 1990s, though, national membership had
begun to climb slightly, and it now hovers at 6.5 million, with 1
million in California.</TE>
<TE>   In an increasingly pluralistic culture, the PTA's ''everychild,
onevoice'' credo and its notion of advocating for all children is
seen by some as quaint and irrelevant. With budgets tight and test
scores low, parents sometimes view their children as members of
competing interest groups--poor students, gifted students, disabled
students, minority students--whose educational success depends on
their ability to corral funding. Moreover, despite the merger with
its African American counterpart, the PTA still struggles against its
1950s caricature as a coffee-and-cookies club for white, middle-class
women.</TE>
<TE>   In Los Angeles and elsewhere, the PTA is providing Spanish and
Korean translators at meetings and offering leadership training to
parents with no experience and much timidity about wielding a gavel.
These efforts are changing the face of the PTA but the fight for
relevancy continues.</TE>
<TE>   Pansy Wing remembers when Glassell Park Elementary School had a
thriving PTA chapter; she was its president in 1968 when her children
attended the mostly white school. But as the working-class community
along the Los Angeles River in northeastern Los Angeles became home
to growing numbers of immigrants from Mexico and Central America, the
PTA ''faded away.'' Now it's ''faded back in.'' Wing is one of a few
Glassell old-timers helping new PTA leaders work with Principal
Sandra Carter to engage parents and boost student performance.</TE>
<TE>   They're bumping up against obstacles common to many schools.</TE>
<TE>   Rosaura Tirado led Glassell's revived PTA last year. A small woman
with a quiet, commanding bearing, Tirado returned to Los Angeles
nearly four years ago from her native Mexico City so that her two
young sons could go to school here. She took on the PTA presidency
because, ''for my child, it's very important that I'm involved. I'm
very concerned that when kids grow, they don't go to the street.''</TE>
<TE>   For Tirado, setting that example meant overseeing the annual
events and continuing activities at this year-round school of 1,000
students. At the school's holiday celebration last December, the PTA
gave each of the 880 children in Track C a book. With nearly all of
Glassell Park's students poor enough to qualify for the school's free
breakfast and lunch program, that book was a significant gift--and a
strong signal from the PTA about the importance of reading. On top of
that, Tirado, who worked part time in a local library, showed up
before the first bell three to four mornings a week to volunteer in
Glassell's reading lab, where kids get breakfast and one-on-one help.</TE>
<TE>   But by last spring, Tirado had handed over her gavel to a new
president in favor of returning to school herself. The turnover of
parent volunteers, fueled by the PTA's unrelenting time commitment,
may mean that the PTA's revival at Glassell and other schools will
ultimately rest as heavily on principals as on a stable roster of
parent leaders.</TE>
<TE>   Principals such as Carter are key to the PTA's success everywhere;
they often work long extra hours to bring uncertain parents and
sometimes-reluctant teachers together, and devote even more nights
and lunch hours to help parent leaders plan school events and keep
their records in the exacting order the PTA requires. In return,
these principals get what the school district can't give them: more
adult eyes and ears on campus, extra hands in the classroom and the
ability to mount new programs for kids. Yet neither Carter nor Eva
Garcia at Belvedere can expect their bosses, the assistant
superintendents who watch over their schools, to always reward these
efforts. The school district evaluates administrators on six
criteria; none directly addresses a principal's efforts to involve
parents.</TE>
<TE>   Another barrier to a PTA revival is the disconnect between
school-based chapters and the PTA's federal, state and regional
organizations. At Beethoven Elementary in Mar Vista, PTA President
Sylvia Shelp has boosted membership and volunteers in part by
reaching out to Latino parents, but she was initially flustered last
year by a question from a father, one that has stumped local PTA
leaders at many other schools:</TE>
<TE>   "I've been paying these $5 dues for six years now,'' the man said.
"But I don't know what we get for our money."</TE>
<TE>   ''Well," Shelp offered hesitantly, "the PTA runs dental and vision
clinics downtown." But her hesitation underscores a major problem for
PTA chapters everywhere: Only a tiny portion of funds raised on
school campuses stays there, and chapters have little or no control
over how most money is spent. PTA dues are set at each school, with
$5 typical across the district. Yet the organization's rules require
each school to ship $4 of every $5 off-campus, to be distributed
among the national, state and regional offices. And 20% of all other
funds that parents raise locally--through pancake breakfasts or
Halloween carnivals--is siphoned off as well. This tithing to support
the organization's all-children credo is a very different message
from the one that booster clubs or mandatory committees send, focused
as they are exclusively on the needs of individual schools or one
group of students.</TE>
<TE>   Shelp's initial unfamiliarity with the PTA's spending is not
uncommon for new chapter leaders busy with the logistics of
back-to-school nights, drug abuse prevention campaigns and
citizenship award contests. But her uncertainty points to a gulf
between the PTA's undisputed lobbying clout with lawmakers and its
much weaker presence on urban school campuses, and also helps explain
the group's trouble getting parents' attention these days.</TE>
<TE>   Or the attention of school officials. Caprice Young, LAUSD board
president, believes the ''PTA is starting to become more of a
player'' in the district, and its mission to work on behalf of all
kids is ''more relevant than ever.'' Lobbying by state and local PTA
leaders was critical, she says, to the board's adoption in 1999 of a
10-year program that aims to make art part of the core curriculum.
''Nobody else talks about art, but the PTA decided we're not willing
to let it go.''</TE>
<TE>   Others, however, see the PTA as still struggling for its niche.
For former school board member Mark Slavkin, the all-children message
is the problem. ''Historically, it's never been possible to speak for
all anything--kids, grown-ups, teachers, whatever,'' he says. ''The
PTA remains important, but like the Red Cross or the Rotary Club, the
PTA may need to reinvent itself in a new era [with] new
demographics.''</TE>
<TE>   That reinvention is evident at 3rd Street Elementary School in
Hancock Park, where the PTA has been a strong force for decades. In
addition to children from the imposing landscaped homes nearby, 3rd
Street draws the children of immigrants from dense apartment blocks
not far away. Half of its students are Asian, most of them Korean and
Korean American, and many of their parents struggle with English.</TE>
<TE>   Cindy Yang recognizes herself in these parents and believes her
job as 3rd Street's co-PTA president is to reach out to them.
Splitting the job of PTA president is not unusual but dividing the
job, in essence, to serve different ethnic groups is less common.</TE>
<TE>   Yang, with a new co-president, Katrina Braunsdorf, is starting her
second year as co-president.</TE>
<TE>   At first, Yang, the mother of two, said she found the idea of
working with the PTA odd. Korean schools don't generally rely on
parent volunteers the way American schools do, but ''I could see that
this school needed my help.'' When a child was nearly run over while
darting between cars to get into the school, Yang pushed for a
special drop-off lane. Now she and her helpers, decked out in
fluorescent vests courtesy of PTA parents, direct traffic in front of
3rd Street most mornings starting at 7. She involves other Korean
parents slowly, suggesting activities that don't require fluent
English, such as photocopying materials for teachers. Over time, she
thinks that brief conversations with them on campus will lead to
greater participation.</TE>
<TE>   ''She knows I'm here, I know she's here,'' Yang says, referring to
a parent she is trying to get involved.</TE>
<TE>   With other parents, she ladles on the guilt: ''I tell them, 'This
country does something for you, you do something for them. You're
here every day dropping off your child, why don't you spare 10
minutes?' ''</TE>
<TE>   Third Street's annual Back-to-School Breakfast exemplifies the
PTA's creative approach to involving parents. Years back, 3rd Street
switched its back-to-school event from early evening to early morning
when it found that working parents who were dropping off their kids
anyway were more likely to tour the classroom then than return to
school after a long day. But the breakfast works only because the PTA
officers, who lead the planning, can depend on a dozen hearty
souls--including members of the school's booster club--to show up as
early as 5:30 a.m. to slice the bagels and sell grocery scrip and 3rd
Street T-shirts. Says Laurie Block, last year's booster club
president, ''We're the right hand and [the PTA is] the left hand but
we're all part of the same body.''</TE>
<TE>   That kind of collaboration seems to succeed at Beethoven as well,
cemented by a tradition of interlocking officers; the president of
that school's booster club serves as the PTA vice president, and the
PTA president serves as booster club vice president. Beethoven's new
library is testament to the power of that cross-pollenation.
Renovation of the dreary room with its worn books was not an official
PTA project, but without the PTA it would not have happened. Working
together, the booster club and the PTA raised $35,000 over five
years, a major undertaking for any school. A local nonprofit group,
The Wonder of Reading, began construction last September and by early
November, Beethoven children entered a brightly colored library with
new carpeting, lots more space, a small amphitheater, Internet hookup
and 700 new books.</TE>
<TE>   There are other benefits to a strong PTA as well. Once a parent
has committed to a leadership position, they are eligible for
training by the PTA--and that training often transforms them into
stronger advocates for their schools. Shelp and Tirado began their
presidential terms by attending a daylong workshop run by regional
PTA leaders. They learned how to use Robert's Rules of Order,
maintain financial records and foster better communication between
parents and teachers. Belvedere's Salazar attended similar training
sessions. Each went home with literature about the state and national
PTA and templates for writing bylaws and meeting notes. As women with
little leadership experience, they left as well with confidence that
they could coordinate classroom volunteers, organize after-school art
classes, even plan a new library.</TE>
<TE>   Leadership training and how-to manuals are important, but they
don't bridge the gap between the PTA's state and national presence
and its activities at local schools. The organization's clout on the
state and national stage is still formidable. ''If you're a lawmaker,
you listen to what they have to say,'' observes Beethoven's
principal, Anne Doublier. State and national PTA leaders on occasion
urge parents to write letters in support of, for example, increased
federal funding for public schools and against vouchers for private
schools--two current priorities. But the PTA as a whole suffers
because parents are understandably focused on improving their local
school while state and national leaders have their eyes on larger
policy battles.</TE>
<TE>   For most Los Angeles schools, the 10th District PTA is supposed to
be that bridge. In addition to running the dental and vision clinics
and sponsoring training sessions, officers from the 10th
District--one of the two regional offices that serve LAUSD
schools--often testify at school board meetings. The 10th District
serves campuses south of the Santa Monica Mountains while the 31st
District represents those in the San Fernando Valley. But the
districts' influence is limited because many of their board members
simultaneously serve as PTA officers at their children's schools and
are swamped in activities there.</TE>
<TE>   The districts are also responsible for helping parents organize
new chapters, but 10th District leaders say they wait for schools to
invite them in. Yet, some parents and principals report that they
have made repeated phone calls before district representatives would
visit their schools to help draft the bylaws and elect officers to
start new chapters.</TE>
<TE>   In early June, Veronica Salazar stood behind the lectern in
Belvedere's auditorium to open her first PTA meeting. About 40 moms
and dads showed up--a respectable turnout for most schools,
particularly on an evening when they could have stayed home for
either the NBA championship or a World Cup soccer match.</TE>
<TE>   ''Muchas gracias,'' Salazar began as she took the microphone
nervously. ''Thank you very much for coming and supporting your
children.'' Speaking in Spanish, Salazar crisply outlined the PTA's
plans for the 2002-2003 school year. Parents took away handouts that
spoke to both their ambitions for their children and to the economic
realities that many families face in this school. One pamphlet
graphically depicted the tooth decay that results when toddlers fall
asleep sucking a bottle and another listed free and low-cost health
clinics nearby. A third explained the course requirements for
admission to the University of California and exhorted parents to
start preparing their young children now.</TE>
<TE>   Her immediate concern, however, was the $225,000 budget cut this
East Los Angeles school has to absorb this year. The shortfall means
''there will be no money for field trips,'' warned Vice Principal and
PTA Treasurer Robert Martinez as he took the microphone. ''None,''
and the number of teachers' aides in this year-round school will drop
dramatically. You parents can help fill this gap, he said, leaning
over the lectern. Get involved. Volunteer in your child's classroom.
Join the PTA. ''We need you to help us.''</TE>
<TE>   ''We're starting a penny drive,'' Salazar said, to collect money
for field trips. Each classroom will have a jar, she said. ''We hope
you'll contribute,'' she urged, mindful of the Sisyphean task of
restoring thousands of dollars in field-trip money one penny at a
time.</TE>
<TE>   If pennies for field trips or new paint on aging bungalows were
all it took to boost Los Angeles schools, then Sylvia Shelp, Cindy
Yang, Rosaura Tirado and Veronica Salazar could justly claim that
their labors--the endless meetings and telephoning, the classroom
volunteers, spaghetti dinners and the book fairs--will lift student
test scores and graduation rates. But these women are the first to
admit that sparking and sustaining improved student performance is a
more complicated enterprise, one beyond even their prodigious energy
and capabilities. Indeed, at Beethoven, 3rd Street and Belvedere
schools, Stanford 9 test scores rose last year but at Glassell Park
they fell slightly.</TE>
<TE>   ''My son asked me, 'Mom, why are you involved in the PTA?' ''
Shelp recalls one morning. ''I told him, 'You do it to make a
difference.' My mother was involved in the PTA--when parents get
involved, their kids get better grades.''</TE>
<TE>   But do they? When parents show up on Saturday to plant flowers
around school, is their child inspired to work harder in class? Or
are the kids who do well in school simply more likely to have parents
who are involved in all aspects of their education? In the face of
LAUSD's crushing deficits and widespread overcrowding, is any parent
group--particularly one stubbornly committed to looking beyond
individual schools--relevant? With the new school year underway, the
PTA is facing one of its severest tests.</TE>

<HD>In Defense of an Urban Survivor</HD>
<DH>When It Comes to Coyotes, L.A. Has a Not-in-My-Backyard
Mentality. But There May Be Less to Fear Than You Might Think. By
Deanne Stillman</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Deanne Stillman last wrote for the magazine about
researching her book "Twentynine Palms: A True Story of Murder,
Marines in the Mojave" (William Morrow), a Los Angeles Times
selection as one of the top nonfiction books for 2001.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I know, I know. The coyote killed your cat, attacked your dog, ate
your daughter's homework, your wife's Palm Pilot and your Greg Norman
signature golf tees, ripped your pet bunny to shreds, devoured your
chickens, wiped out your sheep farmer brother-in-law's spring lamb
population and gorged for days on hundreds of priceless black Angus
cattle, thereby reducing the country's livestock supply by a third
and simultaneously quadrupling the price of a good steak, before a
holiday weekend no less.</LD>
<LD>   OK, maybe I'm exaggerating. But to listen to a lot of people tell
it, the coyote is the four-legged, cloven-hooved antichrist, ranging
around our cities and plains for the sole purpose of destroying the
American economy, and having a few laughs along the way. Now, I admit
that the coyote probably did eat your cat, and maybe he knocked off a
couple of sheep, give or take a hundred, out in the hills somewhere.
But so what? The coyote is just doing what he or she has to do to
survive.</LD>
<TE>   I would also like to suggest that instead of simply chuckling
patronizingly when someone tells a story about a coyote rummaging
through an urban garbage can and spitting out a tennis shoe in favor
of an approaching rodent, we reconsider this Los Angeles totem, this
atavistic representative from long ago, eons before the first humans
entered the stadium and evolved into a species that could tolerate
the survival of no other.</TE>
<TE>   First, a few biological stats: coyotes, Canis latrans, are often
mistaken for domestic dogs, as they typically weigh 25 to 40 pounds
and look like a relative of the German shepherd--perhaps a third
cousin from the fun and irresponsible side of the family. They can be
distinguished from dogs by their black-tipped tail, which is carried
down (at or below the level of the back) while running, whereas dogs
run with their tails higher. One evening, Robert Wayne, a biology
professor at UCLA, saw a coyote making a beeline down Sunset
Boulevard. The animal was acting very much like a stray dog, which,
he pointed out, he would be more likely to fear than a loose coyote.
"Coyotes are afraid of people, they'll run away," says Wayne. "I'd be
more frightened of a dog off leash than a coyote." His point is
well-taken: Dogs kill several people every year while coyotes
reportedly have never been responsible for a human death in L.A.
County.</TE>
<TE>   Although they have long lived on the fringes of the metropolis,
particularly dry years such as this one drive them out of hiding. As
rabbits and other prey look for more water sources, cruising backyard
gardens, golf courses and other suburban attractions, in their
footsteps come the coyotes.</TE>
<TE>   Classified as carnivores, coyotes are really omnivores; in
addition to eating small rodents, rabbits and insects, they feed on
fruit, nuts and vegetables. This makes the common suburban garden,
despite the coyotes' mistrust of people, a rather attractive
proposition. Where coyotes do live in suburbia, their numbers are
denser than they would be in the wild, says Seth Riley, a wildlife
ecologist with the National Park Service. This seems to correlate
with human populations: Compare the populations of Montana, a
comparatively vast wilderness area, with Southern California, which
is the national template for suburban sprawl.</TE>
<TE>   Coyotes are found in every contiguous state in the union, showing
up in a slightly larger form in the Great Lakes and maritime states,
probably as a result of hybridizing with Algonquin wolves. In the
Eastern United States, where they can live on deer, they hunt in
packs. In Southern California, when not caring for their young, they
are usually found in pairs, although sometimes they pal up in groups
of three or four. Typically there will be resident coyotes crossing
paths with commuters, usually young males looking for somewhere to
settle down. Coyotes do not generally carry rabies, although they
can. Adults have relatively long reproductive lives of three to 10
years, and they have been known to compensate for adverse conditions,
such as heavy hunting and trapping, with larger litter sizes, with
the average litter numbering about four.</TE>
<TE>   A trait that they share with humans is that they punish group
members for breaking rules. There have been incidents in which a pack
attacked and ostracized a beta male after he attempted to mount the
group's alpha female. They also indulge in a sort of play not unlike
a milder version of frat boys on spring break. That wild yipping that
city slickers assume is a pack of coyotes tearing up a cat is
actually the rambunctious outbursts of frolicking coyotes, says
Wayne.</TE>
<TE>   The ease with which coyotes have learned to live on the fringes of
civilization is what sets them apart from the bobcat and mountain
lion, both of whose numbers have declined with the expansion of
suburbia. The coyote has no natural predators except the wolf and
mountain lion, and where wolves have been reintroduced, as in
Yellowstone National Park, coyote populations have dropped. With no
move afoot to repopulate California with wolves, human activities,
such as poisoning and vehicle collisions, will have to do. In other
words, we are largely responsible for coyote mortality in Southern
California.</TE>
<TE>   Riley, who has been working for the last three years on a coyote
study in the Santa Monica Mountains, says that while individuals will
generally stay within a five-square-mile area, there have been
intriguing exceptions. One female originally tagged in the
Agoura-Calabasas area was found hunting as far away as Pierce College
in Woodland Hills: Biologists figured out that she was using the L.A.
River basin to move freely through the Valley.</TE>
<TE>   But the perpetually clogged 101 Freeway "is a huge barrier to
them," says Ray Sauvajot, senior Park Service biologist in charge of
the study. "They don't attempt to cross it at all. Those that do, get
hit." On the other major roadway in the study, the 23 Freeway that
connects the 101 to the 118, "there have been a lot of road kills,"
20 in one nine-month period alone, says Sauvajot. "In our study, road
kill is the No. 1 cause of death."</TE>
<TE>   The finding echoes what was discovered in seven months at the 241,
a toll road in Orange County. Although five underground crossings for
animals were built and fences erected, at least 30 animals (including
coyotes, deer, bobcats and other wildlife) were hit and killed while
attempting to cross the road, which bisects a wildlife preserve.</TE>
<TE>   But while car-versus-coyote incidents are lethal, poison has an
equally sweeping effect on the coyote population. The anti-coagulants
used to kill mice and rats not only affect coyotes dining on rodents
deep in suburbia, but also those farther away. Riley's study found
that as the poisoned pests make their way afield, they eventually
spell death for their far-flung predators.</TE>
<TE>   As it happens, spiking the coyotes' food may one day protect them.
For the past 27 years, behavioral psychologist Stuart Ellins has been
studying coyotes and food-aversion conditioning at Cal State San
Bernardino. "I try to get coyotes to stay away from livestock and
pets with lithium chloride," he explains. "It is nontoxic, similar to
table salt. It makes coyotes nauseous." The image conjured is of the
roadrunner playing a trick on Wile E. Coyote by making his food taste
funny, and then dashing off with a smug "beep-beep" as the coyote
heaves his lunch. Reality is not far from image, as the food-aversion
method works like this: Doses of lithium chloride are placed inside
dead bait, such as turkeys or sheep. When the coyotes approach and
start to eat the bait, they are repelled.</TE>
<TE>   The method has been so successful that Ellins has been consulted
by ranchers in Orange County and wilderness stewards at Joshua Tree
National Park about humane coyote control. "Suddenly, a lot of people
are calling me," he says. Currently he is trying to find out if
coyotes transfer their aversion to other coyotes. "Rats don't
communicate food aversions," he says, "but they do with their
preferences. So far, even though coyotes don't share food, I have
found that if a rabbit has lithium in it, coyotes won't eat it and
they will keep others from eating it too.</TE>
<TE>   "There are a lot of two- and three-legged coyotes out there,"
Ellins says, referring to the consequences of non-humane methods of
control such as trapping, "and hopefully this will reduce it."</TE>
<TE>   To investigate exactly how the urban coyote fares, I decided to
spend an evening with Sauvajot and Riley's carnivore study team in
the central Santa Monica Mountains. The mission--to learn about
coyotes, bobcats and gray foxes and how they ply their living on the
edge of a giant metropolis--could one day be crucial to saving other
species. If we can't protect these carnivores, they speculated, how
can we protect anything? The mountain area they covered runs from the
23 Freeway on the west to Topanga Canyon Boulevard on the east, and
here they examined such issues as how development patterns affect
animals and how these three species interact within human-impacted
areas.</TE>
<TE>   The study, the largest of its kind involving urban California
coyotes (smaller studies had been done with significantly fewer
animals) captured 120 coyotes (50 females and 70 males) and tagged
104 with radio collars. On a winter evening, I joined a team heading
out from Park Service headquarters in Thousand Oaks in a van with a
rooftop antenna. We drove into a middle-class suburban
neighborhood--lots of cul-de-sacs and large ranch homes with SUVs in
the driveways. At 5:21 p.m. we stopped at the corner of Valley Spring
just off Westlake Boulevard. We were tracking a female coyote known
as C84. Lorraine Tigas, a graduate student at UC Davis, hopped out of
the van with a walkie-talkie and a radio monitor and sent her
assistant about 20 yards down the street, on a parallel track with a
stretch of undeveloped terrain owned by the Conejo Open Space
Conservation Agency. Five minutes away are a freeway and a mall,
complete with a Starbucks and Macy's.</TE>
<TE>   Tigas and her assistant, who carried a portable antenna and a
radio monitor, turned on their listening devices. "She's inactive,"
Tigas said. We cruised around the Westlake patch to another location
a few blocks away. Tigas and her assistant assumed their positions
and the routine was repeated; the object was to see if the coyote was
moving. "Still inactive," Tigas said. She explained that C84 is a
mate of C29, who died at the age of about 5 of "rodenticide." In
other words, C29 ate a rodent that had been poisoned. As we waited,
so did C84 remain motionless; was she tracking our movement with her
keen senses?</TE>
<TE>   While there is much folklore about coyotes, both in Native
American narratives (which present the animal as a trickster,
creator, wise man, wise guy, thief) and the journals of explorers and
trappers (which present the animal as a social nuisance or as sneaky
vermin with somewhat valuable pelts), there is not much accounting
for Canis latrans in mainstream literature (unlike the bear or wolf,
for example, which are enduring icons of prose wonderment). This
dearth of scrutiny works to the coyote's advantage; he remains a
puzzlement to his greatest threat, daring the world for
triangulation.</TE>
<TE>   A human resident of the neighborhood approached the team and the
Park Service van, a curious-looking arrangement that an outsider
could have taken for a Home Depot attempt at extraterrestrial
contact, or a high school surveillance project. "What's up?" he said.
Tigas explained. "My dog ran off for a few days," he elaborated.
"He's an Akita-Lab mix. Where did he go?" They had a brief
conversation, in which Tigas told him that his dog might have mated
with a coyote, among myriad possibilities, most of which did not
involve coyotes. We continued to listen for signs of movement from
C84. Had she hooked up with the man's dog? I wondered. Had the dog
heeded the call of the wild and joined a pack of urban coyotes? "Last
month," Tigas recounted, "a woman stopped me and said, 'I saw a
coyote cross the road. I didn't know whether to slow down or speed
up.' "</TE>
<TE>   It was time to take a break and we headed down the hill, away from
this wilderness patch, to the local mall. We never did find C84;
perhaps she was waiting for us to leave so she could begin her
evening rounds, helping us two-legged critters in ways we should
note: eating rodents and, yes, the occasional cat, which may well be
preying on local birds. A San Diego study published in the Journal of
Science found that an increase in the coyote population had brought a
subsequent increase in the songbird population, as the coyotes
eradicated the feral cat population.</TE>
<TE>   The fact that we were monitoring coyotes at night is significant:
In the wild, coyotes are more likely to have some daytime activity,
while in suburban areas they are mostly nocturnal, a direct response
to the presence of people--and the times when they are least likely
to run into them.</TE>
<TE>   It is at night that I feel most connected to the coyote: I fall
asleep while listening to tapes of their songs. If I don't listen to
the tapes, I like to think that they are around, watching and
listening and playing. Although I have never heard of any sightings
in my beach-adjacent area, I have heard of coyotes boldly walking
down the streets of Santa Monica, as if to window shop along Montana
Avenue. There is, however, an injured possum living at my apartment
complex. Sometimes at night it crawls from underneath a building, and
a bloody patch on its back is illumined as it dashes before a pair of
headlights in the parking lot. I've seen it enough times that I think
I can make out bite marks around the wound. Was it waylaid by a
coyote? I think as it scurries off to hunt before it is hunted again.
Is brother coyote lurking in Marina del Rey? If so, he is clever
indeed. I have heard that to avoid being detected in areas where they
are heavily hunted, the coyote stops singing. So I resort to my
tapes.</TE>
<TE>   A couple of months later, I joined a group of campers in Malibu
Creek State Park. We had gathered for a twilight talk on coyotes. We
sat on wooden benches in an amphitheater staring at a blank movie
screen. As sunlight faded and the stars came up, a ranger arrived and
began a slide show. The slides comprised a generic nature
show--coyote pups, coyote tracks, coyotes on the hunt, coyotes at
play. After the visual presentation, it was time for questions and
answers. Most questions had to do with coyote control; evidently,
those who had gathered under the stars to talk of wilderness had come
not out of curiosity but fear. "Why aren't they moved away when
they're caught?" one camper asked. "How can I keep coyotes away from
my cat?" said another. "Will coyotes eat my toddler?" a third
wondered. The ranger advised them that it's best to keep cats away
from coyotes, and that it is not likely a coyote would consume human
toddlers.</TE>
<TE>   The evening reminded me of traffic school. "If I have an unopened
six-pack in my trunk," someone inevitably asks, "can I get busted?"
"What if my wine bottle is uncorked but it's in my back seat?"
"Exactly how many feet from the driver's seat can I leave the booze?"
The conversation is always a perversion of the concept of individual
rights, the pursuit of happiness, the national mantra, "It's a free
country, Your Honor. It says right here I can do what I want."</TE>
<TE>   So, too, with the coyote: "I'm camping and I brought my Chihuahua
. . . . So what if my housing development displaces a coyote
settlement? It's easy for them to move. Isn't that what they do?"
Yes, they do move. They wander. They are rootless. They survive. Kind
of like Americans. In particular, the kind of people who live in Los
Angeles. And so they move into our neighborhoods, fleeing other
less-desirable regions, dragging a trap perhaps, singing a silent
song, searching for a room and a meal.</TE>

<HD>Searching for Sandy Koufax</HD>

<AU>JOSH KARP</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Willie Stargell called hitting against Sandy Koufax like "trying to
drink coffee with a fork." And so it was. Koufax, the hype-aversive
legend sometimes dubbed "the J.D. Salinger of baseball," dominated
the sport from 1962-1966 like no pitcher before or since. He made his
mark off the field as well, refusing to pitch on Yom Kippur and
retiring at his peak in 1966, after 12 years with the Brooklyn and
L.A. Dodgers, to avoid further injuring his arthritic left elbow.
During three years of research, author Jane Leavy conducted 469
interviews to find the real Koufax for her new book, "Sandy Koufax: A
Lefty's Legacy" (HarperCollins). Koufax, 66, who still mentors
occasionally for the Dodgers at spring training, declined to be
interviewed for the book but helped provide access to friends and
teammates. We asked Leavy about the man behind the myth.</LD>
<LD>   Why has Koufax been so reclusive since his retirement?</LD>
<LD>   He's not a recluse. He has friends. He has a life. My guess is
that he can be most himself when he's not being a public person. A
public entity who doesn't choose to spend his afterlife exploiting
his public self isn't a recluse. He's just not a media hound.</LD>
<TE>   Describe your first encounters with Koufax.</TE>
<TE>   He left me a message saying, "Ms. Leavy, this is Sandy . . . uh .
. . Koufax. I don't really have any interest in this project, but
I'll call you back." And the next day he did. He's a very polite,
courtly man. I started talking and he wouldn't interrupt me. At the
end of the conversation, he said that he really didn't have any
interest in the project, but [that] if I wanted to come to Vero Beach
[Dodger spring training camp], I could talk to him about it.</TE>
<TE>   So did you?</TE>
<TE>   At Vero Beach, there's a walk up to the main entrance with a mural
of Dodger Stadium and a row of seats from Ebbets Field. If you're a
big-time kind of guy and want attention, you stroll down that walk
and linger purposefully in front of the mural. Koufax came through
the side door. He doesn't need or crave the attention that everyone
presumes is his birthright. I sat under a wall-sized [photo collage
showing] him embracing [catcher] Johnny Roseboro after the 1963 World
Series. He didn't look up.</TE>
<TE>   What separates Koufax from legends like Mickey Mantle and Joe
DiMaggio?</TE>
<TE>   Koufax gave the impression by the way he left the game that he
didn't need baseball to know who he was. It's the opposite of when
Hank Aaron was asked what he did to keep busy and responded, "I'm
being Hank Aaron." I don't think Koufax wanted to spend his life
being Sandy Koufax, the public persona. I think he wanted to be
himself. It was a radical thing to do. The Koufax persona seems part
of a world apart from today's baseball industry. [Former U.S. poet
laureate] Robert Pinsky said, "His triumph surpassed mere success."
He was bigger than winning. He's an American icon as much for what he
refused to do as what he did on the field. There's a hunger in this
world of $252-million shortstops and [cryogenically] frozen
Hall-of-Famers to reach back to an era where things seemed more pure,
whether they were or not. The defining differences of Koufax's career
weren't economic. They were moral, and bound up with a sense of
responsibility to his teammates and the game. In every way that
matters, he offers a barometer--a way of measuring where we were and
where we've come to.</TE>
<TE>   What was your lasting impression of Koufax?</TE>
<TE>   Two words were used for him by ballplayers. He's "class" and a
"gentle, gentle man," in the old sense. Picture that coming out of
the mouths of so many sweaty ballplayers.</TE>

<DH>As Any Spice Zombie Will Tell You, Fresh Is First</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARTIN BOOE</AU>
<BD>Martin Booe last wrote for the magazine for the annual
restaurant issue.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Science fiction has its space zombies, but the home kitchen has its
spice zombies. Spice zombies think they love spices and may well have
a considerable arsenal in the pantry. They add a half teaspoon of
caraway seed or ground mace or anise to whatever they're cooking and
congratulate themselves for not having to make an extra trip to the
market. But they're oblivious to the fact that because the spices
were bought when people were quitting good jobs to work for dot-coms,
heat, light and time have since rendered the contents of those vials
inert.</LD>
<LD>   I should know because I used to be a spice zombie. Then I became
friends with a chef who could work himself into a grand mal seizure
on the subject of spices. He lectured, he implored, he pleaded and
ranted about the absolute importance of using fresh, high-quality
spices. "Ze espices! Zey must be fresh! Joo must always get ze best
quality possible! Otherwise, zis lobster, zis chicken, zis cow--he
die for notheeng!" Did I mention he was French?</LD>
<LD>   That was my wake-up call, and I inspected my spice rack. My main
interest in cooking was always to impress women, so I found I could
correlate most of my spices to some past girlfriend. As an exercise
in personal archeology, it was interesting. But for cooking purposes,
my collection was pretty lame.</LD>
<TE>   My chef friend bought his spices at a store called All Spice on
Fairfax Avenue. He liked to wander around the shop and sniff the
bins, and this inspired many a dish. He said the spices there were
the best you could get in these parts, and he marched me there to
introduce me to Perry Doty, its proprietor.</TE>
<TE>   As you might expect, Doty is passionate on the subject, even
though falling into the spice business was one of life's unexpected
bank shots. While earning a doctorate in political science from
Oxford, he traveled far and wide, sampling the local cuisine
everywhere he went. "From that, I learned what things were supposed
to taste like," Doty says. And for him, taste is serious business.
After all, Doty learned to cook "defensively" because his mother, he
says, could even ruin TV dinners in a way that required a certain
kind of genius. He also wanted to impress women. Once, for example,
he prepared his date a historically correct Medieval dinner using
frankincense. While he won't share the outcome of the date, he will
concede that "there's a reason we don't cook with frankincense
anymore."</TE>
<TE>   In Europe, he notes, spice shops are a common feature of culinary
life. He fell in love with one particular store in Notting Hill; it
planted the mustard seed of his inspiration, which came into blossom
four years ago when he went hunting for authentic Jamaican allspice
(he takes a dim view of the Mexican-grown stuff) and couldn't find
any that suited him. If London, Paris and New York could have spice
shops, he reckoned, why not Los Angeles? All Spice opened for
business four years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Doty screens his suppliers as if they were going to rent his spare
bedroom. Samples go to laboratories for analyses of their volatile
oil contents, their constituent oils and other aspects of their
composition that affect their flavor profiles. He also does his own
grinding, creates his own blends and curry powders and replenishes
bins before the contents lose their freshness. Once ground, most
spices are short-timers, good for only six to eight months, although
black pepper loses its snap after three months, and ground nutmeg
goes for only five days.</TE>
<TE>   Depending on how adventuresome you've been with food, you will
experience All Spice either as a trove of all the ingredients you've
wanted but could never find, or as a revelation. Fennel pollen,
grains of paradise, curry leaves, monk's pepper. But Doty is quick to
shoo cooks away from a fixation on the merely exotic. "It's all about
the quality and freshness," he says. "Actually, my biggest-selling
item is black pepper. When you're using the best of even ordinary
spices, it makes a huge difference."</TE>
<TE>   I expected to pay a premium for freshness, but found the prices
were lower than in the supermarket, where you're mostly paying for
packaging and where the spices are sold by volume rather than weight.
At All Spice, Doty measures them out of their glass bins and funnels
them into small plastic packets.</TE>
<TE>   That day I walked out with packets of hot Spanish pimenton (smoked
paprika), juniper berries, sumac and mustard seed. As I would
discover, the difference between stale spices of dubious origin and
fresh, highborn ones is fairly stunning. Using high-quality spices,
one can actually cook quite simply, creating simple dishes with just
one or two ingredients. The addition of a well-chosen spice shifts
the flavor into an altogether different dimension. For example, I'd
been trying to re-create a pimenton-laced spinach dish I'd had as a
tapa in Seville. With recently purchased grocery store paprika, it
was agreeable. With the fresh pimenton, it was stunning. Later, I
threw some juniper berries into an improvised saurbraten, or
German-style marinated beef, and was amazed at how the bitter, floral
pungency infused the meat. I found that the pleasantly sour but
fruity sumac, used in Persian and Middle Eastern cooking, adds pizazz
to basic salads. Soon I'll get around to making my own mustard. As
for my old sentimental spice collection, I guess I'll follow Doty's
advice and "just put 'em out of their misery."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Just beyond the sprawling outskirts of Phoenix, the heat is 111
degrees and the rush-hour traffic shimmers like a mirage. A billboard
filled with verdant pine trees beckons: ''Come to the real Arizona.''
To the northeast, the landscape climbs from 1,500 feet in the Valley
of the Sun to 7,000 feet along the forested Mogollon Rim, a magnet
for vacation homes and retirement communities drawn by the promise of
trout in cool streams and elk grazing beneath the ponderosa pines.</LD>
<LD>   This day in early summer, the magnet is on fire. A stream of
evacuees in pickups and RVs is heading the other way. Soon, flurries
of ashes hiss against the windshield, air tankers lumber overhead
toward the mountains and a thunderhead of smoke boils up from flames
raging through the forest canopy 10 miles away. Arizona is suffering
the largest fire in its history.</LD>
<TE>   The blaze, known as the Rodeo-Chediski fire, tops the Mogollon Rim
and is racing eastward. Most of the town of Overgaard and parts of
Heber are quickly overrun. In the development of Pinecrest Lakes, 166
of 200 double-wide mobile homes are literally vaporized. In Bison
Ranch, dozens of faux-log cabins are left twisted and smoking.
Undeterred by an army of 4,500 firefighters and a squadron of air
tankers, the fire surges outward along a 400-mile perimeter. To the
north, it has jumped the highway in several places, making a fast run
toward the high desert.</TE>
<TE>   Up ahead, at 8,500 feet in the hamlet of Alpine, potentially in
the path of the advancing flames, Arizona State University professor
Stephen J. Pyne and his wife, Sonja, are packing up their cabin. The
inferno is coming, just as he had long predicted. One of the world's
leading authorities on fire, Pyne has for years advanced the
paradoxical prophecy that the greatest threat to America's forests is
not too much fire, but too little. In Pyne's paradox, without
regular, low-intensity wildfires to clear out undergrowth, the
landscape will one day explode in devastating firestorms like the one
nearby, fires so intense that they obliterate the forests and the
creatures within them.</TE>
<TE>   The Pynes' cabin is a house with rounded wooden siding meant to
look like logs, set in a sparse subdivision of similar houses carved
into dense forest. Pyne greets me at the door. He is tall and lanky,
with an open, bright face and a nearly constant smile. He's younger
looking than his 53 years and more relaxed than might be expected in
light of his prodigious scholarly output. So far he has written 14
books, 11 of which compose a panoramic history of the world as seen
through the lens of fire--an extraordinary ouevre for which he was
awarded a MacArthur ''genius'' fellowship in the late 1980s.</TE>
<TE>   Inside, Sonja is carefully packing important items, leaving what
they don't mind losing--which she cheerfully admits includes the
house itself if forced to choose between it and the ancient ponderosa
pines outside. Pyne is packing too, in between telephone calls from
the media. The national press this year is reporting a growing
consensus that the ''fire deluge,'' as Pyne and others have argued,
is the unintended consequence of a century of government policy of
putting out fires in the woods. What's more, Pyne says, our attitudes
toward fire ignore the historical reality that man's role in nature
has been to start fires, usually unintentionally, but almost always
to healthy effect.</TE>
<TE>   For nearly 100 years, Americans have been at war with wildfire,
and we have been enormously successful, cutting U.S. acreage burned
by 95%. But fire suppression has left the landscape loaded with fuel
in the form of brush and trees. In effect, it has planted bombs in
the forests. ''If you take the normal, historical rhythm of fire out,
you get these kinds of horrific fires that scour out the landscape,''
Pyne says. ''These are of a scale and intensity and size that are
just beyond the range of what this forest can adapt to.''</TE>
<TE>   A landscape some distance from the cabin illustrates his point.
Under a low, leaden ceiling, a forest of black poles stands in a
rolling black landscape punctuated by still-smoking stumps. White
flakes of ash as big as autumn snowflakes blow lazily through the air
and across the charred crust the soil has become, building low dunes
against stumps and filling holes where trees had been. There is a
pleasant, sweet smell of burning pine and juniper, exactly like a
campfire. Every living thing has been killed, transformed into
charcoal. Hiroshima in the pines--luckily with no human victims,
though nationally 21 firefighters have already died this season.</TE>
<TE>   Ultimately, the White Mountain Apache reservation, where the
Rodeo-Chediski fire started, is the hardest hit. Of the acreage
burned, two-thirds is reservation land. Timber is the among the top
three sources of income on the reservation, which has 60%
unemployment. The fire claimed 12 years of their harvest, worth
perhaps $241 million and 400 jobs at the two mills. According to the
Forest Service, the forest will take at least 100 years to return to
what it was.</TE>
<TE>   The news reports of this fire bring a parade of government
officials repeating Pyne's scenario like a mantra: There is too much
fuel in the woods. But beyond that, the discussion quickly dissolves
into a cacophony of old arguments, with the same antagonists drawing
the same battle lines that have frustrated Pyne for
years--environmentalists versus loggers arguing about U.S. forest
policy, neither of them seeing the bigger picture.</TE>
<TE>   In this fire season, Arizona Republican Sen. Jon Kyl blames
''radical environmentalists. They would rather the forests burn than
to see sensible forest management,'' which to him means thinning out
the forests by logging and burning the debris left behind.</TE>
<TE>   Arizona Republican Gov. Jane Dee Hull, who keeps a second home in
Pinetop-Lakeside, rails: ''The policies that are coming from the East
Coast, that are coming from the environmentalists, that say we don't
need to log, we don't need to thin our forests, are absolutely
ridiculous. Nobody on the East Coast knows how to manage these fires,
and I for one have had it.''</TE>
<TE>   On CNN's "Crossfire," conservative co-host Robert Novak taunts
Kieran Suckling, director of the Arizona-based environmental group
Center for Biological Diversity: ''You have created a holocaust,
haven't you?''</TE>
<TE>   Suckling's reply: ''What's wrong with these forests is they've
been managed exclusively for timber industry profits for a hundred
years. The old fire-resistant trees have been cut down and shipped to
the timber mills and the fires have been suppressed because they were
viewed to be dangerous to the timber industry . . . . I'll tell you
what's happening right now in Arizona. The Forest Service is not
focusing its thinning projects around the urban areas that are
threatened. Instead, they're off cutting down old growth trees in the
wilderness, 30, 40, 50 miles from the nearest home.''</TE>
<TE>   Pyne has heard it all before. ''I see the same sort of distressing
political polarization'' as in past seasons, he says. ''Nobody is
willing to deal with the fire problem as a fire problem. They want to
use it for something else.'' That ''something else'' is a series of
agendas that beg a central question: How can we keep our forests and
wildlife healthy?</TE>
<TE>   For the logging lobby, fire is a disaster, eating up a valuable
resource, ''standing board feet,'' as trees are called. The
industry's approach is to ''go in and cut it out--which doesn't solve
the problem at all,'' Pyne says, because it takes the largest trees
and leaves behind smaller trees and other highly flammable material.</TE>
<TE>   For the angry politicians, fire is the enemy, threatening the
homeland--or at least its second homes. It's the same view that
guided the era of vigorous fire suppression and it leads back to the
same precipice, Pyne says.</TE>
<TE>   Environmentalists concede the need for logging and controlled
burning to protect communities, but bridle at allowing either in the
backcountry. They also see fires set by humans as unnatural. The
Sierra Club's policy is typical: in wilderness, ''fire should be
managed primarily by the forces of nature.''</TE>
<TE>   The flaw in that reasoning is a point that underlies much of
Pyne's research. Pyne insists that fire is not, in any useful sense,
simply natural. The most common natural source of fire is lightning,
but many landscapes in North America see little of it. Instead, for
more than 10,000 years, when human hunters first came into North
America, many fires, perhaps most of them, were set by people. Even
in places with abundant lightning, like Arizona, the forests are also
unmistakably shaped by ''anthropogenic'' fire, which in Pyne's
lexicon, means fire started by people.</TE>
<TE>   ''The issue is that we need to start thinking seriously about is
how fire belongs here,'' he says. ''And we have to accept that we are
the creature that has to make those decisions. It's our ecological
task. Other animals knock over trees, dig holes in the ground, eat
plants, but we're the fire creature, we're the one creature that does
that. It's not enough to just turn it over to nature. If we can't get
fire right, we might as well resign from the Great Chain of Being, as
far as I'm concerned.''</TE>
<TE>   Forests need fires to germinate the seeds of many plants, to cycle
nutrients and to create the mosaic of open spaces that underpin
diversity. Many animals cannot survive without berries, grasses and
other vegetation that flourish in sunny meadows where tall trees have
been burned away. In the Banff National Park region of the northern
Rocky Mountains, he continues, ''The big, charismatic
creatures--bears, bighorn sheep, elk--are all dependent on
fire-created landscapes. But there's almost no lightning-caused fires
in there. If we choose to stand aside and let nature do it, we're
going to eliminate all these animals.''</TE>
<TE>   While the squabbling continues, the danger rises. By government
estimates, the U.S. needs to reduce fuel on 70 million to 80 million
acres; right now it is managing to deal with 2 million acres per
year. The record-breaking fire season of 2002 is just one more hot
summer in a ratcheting national bonfire. By mid-August, Oregon and
Colorado had joined Arizona in suffering the worst fires in their
history.</TE>
<TE>   The week after his high school graduation in 1967, Pyne went to
Grand Canyon National Park to take a job as a summer laborer. Instead
he was offered a place on a five-man North Rim fire crew. Eighteen
years old, living away from home for the first time, he fell in love
in the classic coming-of-age sense: ''We were living on the rim of
the Grand Canyon and getting paid for it: clearing the fire roads,
cutting the limbs off trees, digging out of the mud,'' and hiking all
over the backcountry to find the source of smoke reported by
lookouts. ''You become very sensitized to the landscape around you,
to the things that matter: how the seasons come and where the winds
are; to soil; to duff, because that's where fire persists. You're
going to have to mop it up, you're going to spend hours, days, at the
wrong end of a shovel spading over smoking pine needles.</TE>
<TE>   ''It wasn't just fighting fires, it was also the place. The
rituals of your life were defined by the rhythms of fire and the
geography of fire and the character of fire, and had there been no
fire, there would have been no reason for the Park Service ever to
send anybody out there. We got to go where most tourists didn't. I
didn't ever want to leave.''</TE>
<TE>   Most seasonal firefighters stay for two or three summers. Pyne
stayed for 15, between college terms at Stanford University and
graduate school at the University of Texas at Austin. He met Sonja at
the North Rim and married her there five years later. (Long-term
focus is one of his hallmarks. One summer he ordered pancakes, bacon
and cantaloupe for breakfast 105 mornings in a row.)</TE>
<TE>   With his PhD in hand but without an academic post in the lean job
market of the late 1970s, still supporting himself as a seasonal
firefighter, Pyne decided as a last gambit to combine his love of
fire with history. The resulting book, ''Fire in America,'' published
in 1982, became an instant classic in the new field of environmental
history and won him the MacArthur in 1988. The award funded a
five-year peregrination to all five continents, where he did the
research that underpins his five-volume ''Cycle of Fire,'' the fire
histories of America, Australia, the World, Antarctica (a place
distinguished by the absence of fire), and what is acknowledged to be
his masterpiece, ''Vestal Fire," a fire history of Europe and
European colonialism, published in 1997. His most recent book, "Year
of the Fires," while not part of the MacArthur series, touches on
familiar territory in addressing government policy on firefighting
before and after the year 1910, when a wave of wildfires threatened
to consume the Western United States.</TE>
<TE>   By ''treating fire as a larger cultural force,'' putting it at the
center of the narrative, Pyne has uncovered an analytical tool of
surprising scope and power. In his work, fire is paradoxically both
natural and cultural, acting like a Promethean ur-species, sometimes
competing with, sometimes domesticated by, people. Nature gave us
fire in the form of lightning, and we took it and altered it, making
it the fire in the hearth of civilization and the engine that, by
clearing land, helped create agriculture and allow its expansion into
inhospitable zones. It is embedded in every society and landscape--as
the biology of every continent except Antarctica has been, to some
extent, fashioned by human fire use. In Australia, for example, Pyne
argues convincingly that fire-stick-wielding aborigines literally
created the landscape by favoring the fire-loving eucalyptus over
other species.</TE>
<TE>   Arizona is no exception. It has the highest incidence of fire
caused by lightning in America and a long history of human
occupation. Nowhere is this combination more keenly felt than in the
ponderosa pinelands, where periodic fires fed by thick grasses left
larger trees standing but cleaned out smaller trees and brush. Burned
often enough, ponderosa forests can be largely fireproof. But when
Euro-American settlement began 150 years ago, overgrazing soon
stripped the grasses and bouts of logging cut out the old growth
trees. Firefighting, believed to protect the resource, instead
eliminated the janitor. Smaller trees grew into dense thickets,
transpiring scarce water through their leaves so that springs and
creeks dried up.</TE>
<TE>   Bruce Babbitt, former Arizona governor and Interior Department
secretary, says that when he was growing up, he could look out from
his bedroom window in Flagstaff at the San Francisco Peaks, the
12,600-foot dormant volcano that looms over the city, ''and watch the
change of the seasons across the mountain. You could see all these
large parks, which were obviously originally cleared by fire, and
across the years you could see them gradually closing in. In the area
where we used to go skiing, you could actually watch the aspen
forests, fire-generated, disappear, crowded out by fir trees."</TE>
<TE>   At the peak of the Rodeo-Chediski fire, I leave the Pynes to their
packing and drive to Show Low, a town of 7,700 named for the Wild
West card game by which a ranchhand won the land, now evacuated and
serving as the base for the firefighting effort. I'm looking for Jim
Paxon, a district ranger in the Gila National Forest in New Mexico
and Forest Service spokesman on the fire.</TE>
<TE>   It is eerily calm. Police cruisers and military units in Humvees
patrol empty streets under a milky orange sun filtered through a
light fall of ash. On the playing fields at the high school, swarms
of blue crew tents are massed like jellyfish in a green sea. Parking
lots stretching two blocks are jammed with TV satellite trucks. Five
times daily, Paxon appears before TV cameras to announce the numbers
of acres burned, of homes ''saved'' and of those afforded no
salvation. A Texan with a thick mustache and a laconic drawl, Paxon
is the very definition of a grizzled veteran: since 1969, he has
worked on some of the biggest wildfires in American history, and has
seen the bodies of scores of firefighters taken out of the mountains.</TE>
<TE>   ''I'm a prescribed burner,'' he tells me. ''Some of my own peers
call me a pyromaniac. I burned 86,000 acres in the last four years in
my little bitty district''--the Black Range, 560,000 acres of
ponderosa and pinyon-juniper pine woodlands within the national
forest. He can quantify the results: ''Where I've burned, I've got
creeks that have been dry for 15, 20 years that are flowing water
year round now." Some areas of pinyon-juniper forest that have been
thinned are yielding about 700 pounds per acre of grass, he says. "I
can show you a biological desert, where there's 400 juniper trees an
acre, and you're getting 200 pounds of forage [grass] an acre. I can
show you where we burned and there's 1,200 pounds.</TE>
<TE>   ''I take some of these old ranchers, in their 70s and 80s, and I
walk 'em through blue grama grass that's brushing their crotch, and
they've never seen that.''</TE>
<TE>   Paxon is the first to admit that his is a rare situation. His
district is mostly wilderness in a near-empty quarter of a sparsely
populated state, 50 miles from the closest thing to a city--Truth or
Consequences, N.M., named after the game show. Successes like this do
not constitute a nationwide model.</TE>
<TE>   Paxon was also lead information officer on the May 2000 ''Los
Alamos'' fire in New Mexico, a prescribed fire at Bandelier National
Monument that turned out of its intended track and blew toward the
town of Los Alamos and the nearby national laboratory, where nuclear
materials are kept. Conditions in Upper Frijoles Canyon, the target
of the fuel-reduction burn, were probably too moist for burning,
according to Pyne's post mortem, while conditions in the ponderosas
around Los Alamos were superb for a firestorm.</TE>
<TE>   In spite of intensive firefighting efforts, the blaze was
unstoppable, burning 42,849 acres, 235 homes and part of the lab
itself. In its wake, prescribed burning fell under a cloud of smoke.
Its record is, on the whole, good: In the last few decades, less than
3% of controlled burns have become uncontrollable--exactly the same
percentage as the number of unintentional wildfires that defeat
suppression efforts. But the exceptions make the perception. Some of
the worst fires of the past 20 years have been escapes, Pyne says.
Seven have killed firefighters; one burned a small town in Michigan
to the ground.</TE>
<TE>   Burning remains an art, not a science--one with innumerable
variables that must line up for success, and a steep price for
failure. Of those prescribed burns that are attempted, many end in
failure--fizzling out, going the wrong way when the wind shifts or
just not burning hot enough, singeing trees enough to kill them but
not fell them, leaving standing deadwood that is more flammable than
live trees. The burning also creates smoke, which few people
associate with a wholesome weekend in the mountains.</TE>
<TE>   ''Urban people,'' Pyne says, ''the only fire they see is a
disaster--the car is burning, there was an accident, the house is
burning, they see it on TV, it's a crisis.'' In their cabins in the
pines, they can't see the ''large fuels,'' in firefighter parlance,
for the trees. It's tough to get them to cut down the trees that
brush against their wood-shake roofs; it's even harder to persuade
them to welcome prescribed fire into the nearby woods.</TE>
<TE>   Burning programs nationwide are routinely stifled by complaints
about drifting smoke. The White Mountain Apache tribe, historically
among the most aggressive controlled burners in the country, has seen
its program severely curtailed when smoke sinks down into smog-choked
Phoenix, pushing it into violation of clean-air statutes. In 1996, a
fire closed Phoenix's Sky Harbor airport for three days to all but
instrument landings.</TE>
<TE>   Against that backdrop, advocates of prescribed burning have had to
give ground to those who see a greater role for chainsaws in bringing
the forests back into balance.</TE>
<TE>   The nation unquestionably needs to find a way to put fire back
into the landscape, on a huge scale. But how? It's a riddle Pyne has
struggled with for most of his career.</TE>
<TE>   Back at the Pynes' cabin, I ask if burning alone can restore the
tangled ponderosa forest in which the house sits. ''No," he replies.
''And I say that reluctantly. Twenty years ago, I would have said,
'Yeah we took fire out, now what we need to do is just put it back
in.' But I think we've learned to our pain that it is not a
reversible process. You can't put fire back in the same way you took
it out. It turns out to be very complicated. It's like introducing a
lost species: you can't take wolves and dump them into Arrowhead Mall
and expect that they're going to behave as they would have 200 years
ago. You can't dump fire into some of these landscapes and expect
that fire is going to dissolve all the ills out there."</TE>
<TE>   There is consensus that forest ''treatment'' must involve a
combination of cutting and burning. Smaller trees would be cut down
and, along with other debris from the forest floor, either ground up
or burned after the snow falls. In a given forest, the process might
have to be repeated, and it might take several years.</TE>
<TE>   Pyne cautions against any universal prescription. ''Right now it's
all slashing and burning, it's all shoving biomass around, it's all
an engineering problem: we take out so much fuel, we kindle so many
fires, or we suppress so many.''</TE>
<TE>   Instead, the recipe must be tailored to the habitat. What works in
a ponderosa pine forest won't apply to a coastal Douglas fir forest,
a lodgepole pine forest, a pinyon-juniper forest or chaparral. It
will differ on north-facing slopes and south-facing slopes. And, to
top Pyne's paradox with another, he points out that, in some
high-altitude forests, periodic ''stand-replacing'' fires that strip
away every living thing are ecologically normal and necessary.
Thinning would only deprive them of the fuel they require.</TE>
<TE>   ''We're talking about boutique burning,'' Pyne says. ''Site
specific, knowledge-intensive, time-intensive, and hugely expensive."</TE>
<TE>   The greatest barrier to free-burning fire is the growing phalanx
of homes being built in fire-prone environments. Houses in the woods
form the most bitterly contended front in the fire wars: the
''wildland/urban interface.'' Now resources have to be committed to
saving structures, at great cost and risk to firefighters trained and
equipped to fight for territory, not lives or property. ''Suddenly
the firefighter is even more compromised. Do you save the houses or
the trees?'' Pyne asks.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps fires like those this season will spur a keener awareness
of the risks of building in fire-prone regions, and changes in
attitudes and legal and financial incentives will follow. As Babbitt
says, ''Living in the forest is dangerous, and ironically, in most of
these areas there are no building codes at all. The governor and all
the politicians are busy blaming everybody, but they seem to be
unable to turn to the communities themselves and say, 'You have a
responsibility, and it's about time to enact some building codes and
to take some simple precautions.' We still haven't learned that
lesson.''</TE>
<TE>   Even in Los Alamos, Paxon says, people still resist providing
buffer zones between the forest and their homes. Within four months
of the fires there, some homeowners sought permission to build to
within five feet of the national forest boundary. The existing
setback was 15 feet. The city denied the request. The fire had burned
20% of Los Alamos, Paxon notes, yet among those in the other 80% were
people who thought: "It'll never happen to me.See, the big fire's
already come."</TE>
<TE>   In California, an explosive hillside intermix is a traditional
form of urbanism, and it has shown a discouraging pattern. When a
neighborhood burns in Malibu or Berkeley, the owners rebuild,
generally with insurance and disaster relief money, building bigger
and more expensive houses. Property values rise, the area becomes
more desirable, and more houses are built even higher on the slopes.
Eventually, another fire torches the neighborhood, and the insurance
and relief payments, being larger, cover the cost of rebuilding even
bigger structures, and so on. So far, no limit to this perverse cycle
has been reached.</TE>
<TE>   The federal land management agencies spent their entire
fire-suppression budgets this year by mid-July. The Forest Service
drained half of its reserve on just five fires. To continue the
effort through the fire season, the agencies will have to ask for at
least $1 billion in emergency appropriations--money the White House
is loath to grant during a budget crunch and an election year, but
which influential members of Congress are loath to deny constituents.</TE>
<TE>   After the disastrous 2000 season, the Clinton administration
secured passage of the National Fire Plan, with $2 billion in funding
for mitigation efforts, including fuel reduction. To date, fewer than
half of the national forest fire plans required by the legislation
have been prepared--hence, little progress has been made. The money
is regarded as just a down payment on a fuel-reduction bill that is
expected to reach $12 billion over a decade.</TE>
<TE>   By the end of August, the national burn tally exceeded 6.2 million
acres--double the mark last summer, surpassing the year-to-date burn
tally for the devastating 2000 fire season, the worst ever recorded.
Various governments spent $1.6 billion fighting those fires, calling
out 30,000 firefighters.</TE>
<TE>   Pointing to these numbers, the Bush administration is pushing
Congress to exempt 10 million acres from environmental laws to clear
the way for "treatment"--mostly by for-profit logging, not burning.
Environmentalists counter that the White House is using the fires as
a smoke screen for letting loggers back into the wilderness, setting
back decades of environmental gains.</TE>
<TE>   Pyne is not optimistic. ''You're going to see some change around
the houses. Congress is tired of having houses burning on TV,'' he
says. Some national parks and monuments will have a form of
preventive treatment, including prescribed fires. But the vast
expanses of generic public lands, the 50% of the West owned by
federal agencies like the Forest Service and the Bureau of Land
Management, remain in danger of catastrophic fires and, in their
wake, cascading biological shifts that no one can predict.</TE>
<TE>   ''It's hard to justify billions of dollars and years and years of
effort to try and prevent it from burning under extreme conditions,''
Pyne says. ''The likely scenario is they'd rather spend $12 billion
on prescription drugs. We've just put them aside until we tackle
those other issues, but fire isn't waiting and fire is going to chew
those lands up.''</TE>
<TE>   Arizona's Rodeo-Chediski fire eventually destroyed 467 structures
and blackened 468,638 acres. Its eastward advance, toward the Pynes'
cabin, was stopped by an Apache fire crew working day and night in a
last-ditch effort along a fire line that had been cleared two years
before in a controlled burn. The earlier fire had successfully
removed enough undergrowth and small trees that the new fire was
deprived of fuel. When it hit the line, the inferno ''just lay down
and died,'' says Rick Lupe, a 24-year firefighting veteran and head
of the Apache crew. The Pynes' cabin was spared.</TE>
<TE>   The same thing happened to Colorado's Hayman fire. After joining
with the Arizona fire, it, too, ran into a previous prescribed burn
and died.</TE>
<TE>   The lessons seemed clear.</TE>
<TE>   As I left the cabin, Sonja gave me two gifts: a bag of cookies and
a sack of ponderosa pine cones she had soaked in paraffin to make
foolproof firestarters for the fireplace.</TE>

<LD>In the late 1970s, while his peers were out surfing, Patrick "P.J."
Sheehy was following a pinball machine mechanic around the El Dorado
Bowl on Lincoln Boulevard near LAX. "I'd go meet him, even if it
meant ditching class," Sheehy says. "I idolized those guys more than
any pro baseball player." Sheehy was so transfixed with the machines
that he wrote to local pinball distributors offering to sweep floors,
clean up--anything--to be near the bumpers, flippers, bells and
spectacularly painted "back-glass" designs. In those days, he was
usually told (in effect) to get lost.</LD>
<LD>   After finishing school, Sheehy fixed VCRs and copiers before
moving on to pinball and jukebox repair. Now the established
specialist gets calls at all hours from the same distributors who
once ignored him. "It's taken me nine years of 24/7 work," he says.
Along the way, Sheehy, 37, says he has fixed Arnold Schwarzenegger's
pinball machine and performed jukebox repair for Quentin Tarantino
and Tom Hanks.</LD>
<TE>   Sheehy acquired more than 125 pinball machines before realizing
that he was running out of room. This summer he created P.J.'s
Pinball Museum, which displays more than 50 working machines in his
Culver City storefront space. "You can live it all over again," he
says. "It's like falling in love, but it never ends.'' The oldest
machine on view is a 1952 wood machine called Key West. "They're my
children," he says. "This is your own personal Disneyland on a
3-by-4-foot table. It's a comic book come alive."</TE>
<TE>   It's also a pop culture history lesson. "The artwork on 'Mata
Hari' was too suggestive," says Sheehy. "It made church women go
bananas. They were calling pinball machines pornography." He also
displays "Nip It," a machine created in the 1970s but featured
mistakenly, he says, on TV's '50s-themed "Happy Days" sitcom. Many
machines, such as "Six Million Dollar Man," "Star Trek" and a
"Playboy" game, anticipate the era of the licensing tie-in. The
images of Roger Daltrey and Ann-Margret appear on "Wizard," a homage
to the Ken Russell film based on the Who's rock opera "Tommy," which
featured the hit song "Pinball Wizard."</TE>
<TE>   Games in which players use sticks to land balls in holes have been
around for centuries; early pinball machines such as the Ballyhoo
began appearing in the early 1930s, and the game went electric in the
same decade. Classic features such as bumpers and flippers appear
during the '40s. Pinball ruled the arcades between the late '70s and
early '80s, he says, but business dwindled with the advent of video
games. "They moved away from bells in 1978 and went to electric
sounds," says Sheehy, who plays but appreciates the machines
primarily for their artistic design. "Now [pinball] is Americana."</TE>
<TE>   Future museum exhibits include Johnny Six Shooter, a life-sized
outlaw mannequin that Sheehy acquired with other animatronic displays
when Disneyland and Knott's Berry Farm got rid of some of their gun
games. He also hopes to form an appreciation society for special
events. As adolescent thrills go, Sheehy is still racking up the
bonus points. "Guys my age, we'll go to our graves lovin' this."</TE>

<LD>Stanford law professor Larry Lessig ("The Cultural Anarchist vs. the
Hollywood Police State," by David Streitfeld, Sept. 22) is to
creators of intellectual property what U.S. Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft
has been to the United States Constitution.</LD>
<LD>   Should professor Lessig's latest academic pursuit--Eldred v.
Ashcroft, a civil suit scheduled to be heard Oct. 9 before the U.S.
Supreme Court--succeed, it will have the force and effect of dropping
"the big one" in every still photography, motion picture and video
archive across this land. Gone will be the financial incentive--for
big and small businesses alike--to house, maintain and restore this
nation's greatest form of expression, the recorded image.</LD>
<LD>   Lessig argues that "the Supreme Court isn't owned by Hollywood,"
and his suit will free "hundreds of thousands of artistic
works"--much the same way that Ronald Reagan's administration "freed"
the gravely mentally ill from state hospitals, allowing them to die
in the streets without medical treatment, food or money. It's
"cultural anarchists" like Lessig who are the real threat to our
cultural heritage.</LD>
<TE>   Robert Tur</TE>
<TE>   Photojournalist</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles News Service</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Apparently Lessig and many others outside of the entertainment
industry feel it's their right to exploit any and all aspects of
intellectual property, whether it was created 80-plus years ago or
yesterday, without payment to the creators or the copyright holders.</TE>
<TE>   Grossly absent from the article is the fact that someone may earn
a living from the copyrights Lessig wishes to annul. Big corporations
aside, there are thousands of people who have been involved
creatively with film, music and other arts that rely on copyright
protection to feed their families. Most of them cannot rely on the
income derived because it is so small, and they have to find other
means to subsist.</TE>
<TE>   Fred Bailin</TE>
<TE>   Irvine</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I fail to understand why the copyrights for movies, novels and
music are treated differently than the limited patents on
prescription drugs. The "creators" of these products do not receive
anywhere near the majority of the money generated; those involved in
mass production and distribution do.</TE>
<TE>   If the goal of copyrights is to protect creativity, then they
should end with the death of the artist (or very shortly thereafter)
so that the work can develop or disappear according to its cultural
significance. As any artist will tell you, imitation is the highest
and most irritating form of flattery. What most artists want after
death is simply recognition and attribution.</TE>

<DH>Flash Is Out. Obvious Is Over. Men's Fall Fashion Is All
About Subtlety and Discretion.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Peter McQuaid</AU>
<BD>Peter McQuaid last wrote for the magazine about casual
Friday fashion.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The runways--and the stores--are awash in them: camel overcoats, navy
pea jackets, plain-front, traditional-rise pants in wool, pleated
pants in wool, tweed sports jackets, trench coats, neckties and, most
importantly, lots and lots of dress shirts--long sleeved and
preferably French cuffed.</LD>
<LD>   Pack up all your tricky denim and your low-rise, beltless boot
flares for another day, say the sages. Same goes for those
body-hugging silks or synthetics. Super-baggy, logos,
trademarks--it's over.</LD>
<LD>   The classics are back, say those whose business it is to dress
you. But before you go digging through your father's hand-me-downs or
looking for those dusty boxes your domestic partner finally shipped
off to the Salvation Army a few months back, know this: Nothing in
Fashion Ever Comes Back Exactly As It Was.</LD>
<TE>   That's because you wouldn't have any reason to buy the new stuff,
now, would you?</TE>
<TE>   The bad news is that you're expected to look pulled together all
the time. The good news is that you no longer have to have a body
like a Calvin Klein model to look pulled together. Classic clothes,
beautifully designed and cut, are more forgiving of an imperfect
physique.</TE>
<TE>   That's not to say the trend was easily accomplished; hip-hop
especially was a force to be reckoned with. "We had this huge return
to prestige and luxury a while back, and then hip-hop really blew it
out the door," says DeeDee Gordon, co-president of the L.A.-based
information and marketing company Look-Look. But Gordon, who divides
her time between L.A. and New York and counts Calvin Klein and Nike
among her clients, is always ahead of the pack. It's sophistication,
not flash, that's de rigueur. In today's economy, the trend is to put
your best foot forward, even on Fridays. Take a look at Wall Street
and you'll see that the ubiquitous "casual Friday" garb of chinos and
denim is slowly, but surely, making its exit.</TE>
<TE>   One store where they've been hooked on classics for 53 years is
Carroll &amp; Co. in Beverly Hills, where tradition has always been,
well, a tradition. John Carroll, now head of the business his father
founded, characterizes the new approach to dressing as a "return to
classic checks, bolder plaids, more gray and more camels, more basic
stripes in suits, two button, center vent, a shorter center vent.
We're seeing a lot of plain-front trousers again. Not so much of the
tight short-rise [styles]."</TE>
<TE>   The days of a man's turning heads at an event--for any reason
other than his accomplishments--are over, says Carroll. "I'm a big
believer in a man and woman going out--whether it's black tie or
dinner--and the woman being the one who turns heads. The man needs to
be dressed with style, elegance and grace. You shouldn't notice how
beautifully dressed the man is unless you're talking to the couple."</TE>
<TE>   The new style, says Carroll, is reminiscent of Old Hollywood in
the '30s and '40s, which was a stylistic translation in itself--an
idealized version of tailored English style, made snazzier (and
roomier) for the movies and the bigger, bulkier American male. The
new classic look may be a two-button jacket in a smart wool pinstripe
or solid, but it won't be a sack or overly tight, it won't be in a
heavy English tweed and it will accommodate the shoulders as well as
the waistline. Think natural fabrics, discreet tailoring and elegant
and understated accessories.</TE>
<TE>   The classic twist isn't limited to clothes.</TE>
<TE>   Dick Messer, director of the Petersen Automotive Museum, says that
automotive trends are following suit. In automotive and high-tech
style, he's seeing a return to classic colors such as reds, maroons,
subtle greens and grays, but with a metallic sheen--a modern take on
the original. Again, the twist.</TE>
<TE>   "Everything is getting more stylized," Messer says, "but in a less
flashy way. You see more chrome trim and chrome wheels, which is an
eye-catcher, but it's not as gaudy as it used to be."</TE>
<TE>   One thing's for sure, says Messer. "We won't be going back to the
bland."</TE>
<TE>   There is, of course, a difference between classic and boring. Get
the classic suit or cardigan. Spice it up with a brilliant tie or a
colorful shirt or a beautiful watch. But think beyond fall, to next
fall and the fall after that, and ask yourself if this garment (item,
consumer product, whatever) is something you'll still find useful
then.</TE>
<TE>   If it's well made, and not too tricky, chances are the answer is
yes.</TE>
<TE>   Leonard Leib, the West Coast representative for Hickey-Freeman,
sounds very much like a dog having his day.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been in this business almost 50 years, and for the last 10,
almost 15 years, this market has been dominated by what the Italians
have done, starting with Armani, big shoulder, notched lapel," Leib
says. But even Armani and his fellow Italians have bowed to the
trends. This season's Armani is pared down. "The tide started turning
a few years ago. Part of it has to do with the cyclical wheel of
fashion."</TE>
<TE>   Leib is also happy to close the book (at least for a time) on the
dressed-down trend. "The dressed-down syndrome went to the point
where men looked terrible when they got out of a suit. [But] with
this economy, well, you can't look for a job in cutoffs and a
T-shirt. You have to look good."</TE>
<TE>   Carroll believes the bursting of the dot-com bubble has fueled
much of the new interest in traditional style. And the guy who went
to work in sneakers and jeans, Carroll contends, isn't jumping into
anything too edgy or out-there now that he has to dress up. "It's a
back-to-basics mentality. We're coming off a dot-com boom where guys
were looking the same on the golf course as in the boardroom. [Today]
that guy is not going to move right into a low double-breasted,
side-vent, baggy pants suit. He's going to buy a solid navy, a solid
gray, one stripe and one check--stuff he can rotate."</TE>
<TE>   Jim Moore, creative director of GQ magazine, says he hasn't seen
so many classic clothes in several years. "When you have someone like
Tom Ford doing a homage to matinee idols--Bogart trenches, Gene Kelly
looks--now everyone is doing the classic thing--and not apologizing
for it. As far as the economy goes, I think designers want men to
embrace something they feel comfortable with. Men can really grasp a
season like this; they can find something familiar. I don't think a
twentysomething is going to relate to Gary Cooper necessarily, but he
is going to like dressing up. Even Lenny Kravitz is looking more
glamorous than he did a year ago."</TE>
<TE>   But extroverts like Lenny will still be able to have fun, Moore
says, thanks to this fall's hottest item--the dress shirt.
"Everyone's wearing these bright Paul Smith shirts with jeans or
under suits. There's more to play with."</TE>
<TE>   Colby McWilliams, vice president of men's fashion and merchandise
development for Neiman Marcus, agrees with Moore that the hot, fun
item is definitely the shirt. "Shirts are getting better and better,"
says McWilliams. "French cuffs, striped shirts from Paul Smith, all
of them. Club ties, foulards, things that were popular 20 years ago
are back."</TE>
<TE>   McWilliams is also high on cardigans, leather trench coats,
classic suits in chalk or pinstripes and the traditional
double-breasted suit.</TE>
<TE>   Deborah Lloyd, who assumed the title of senior vice president of
design and product development with Banana Republic 10 months ago,
says her company's shelves are also staying pretty classic. Though
Banana Republic made its name selling basics, in seasons past the
merchandise has drifted in and out of trendy.</TE>
<TE>   "We brought back suiting in a big way," Lloyd says. "People want
to get dressed up. We're also doing great topcoats in pressed wools
and rain mackintoshes in Italian cloths and gabardines. They're core
classics--things a guy can have for a long time. Fashion has been so
crazy. Now it's about establishing your wardrobe in a back-to-work
kind of way. It's a bit more grown-up."</TE>
<TE>   But this is L.A., the most ethnically, culturally and socially
diverse city in the nation, and the city we are today isn't rooted in
an Anglo-Saxon milieu. It's rooted in a cultural convergence that
includes (but is hardly limited to) Mexican Catholic, Midwestern
Protestant, Eastern European Jewish and Asian. Add Hollywood, Kar
Kulture, Surf Culture, the Hippie Aesthetic, and it's easy to see
that L.A. classic . Our classics draw from sources far beyond the
English manor.</TE>
<TE>   One place where you can find indigenous L.A. style is at Ron
Herman (one of the collection of stores at the Fred Segal complex at
Melrose Avenue and Crescent Heights Boulevard). Buying as they do,
from local talent as well as Europeans, Ron Herman is the place to go
when you're ready to lighten up. Menswear buyer Nina Garduno says the
Ron Herman classic seems dressed down, but it is seldom cheap.</TE>
<TE>   "You never know whether people here have money or not," says
Garduno. In keeping with this, she says, "I've got a 100% cashmere
pea coat or topcoat from Helmut Lang. Who would know it was really
cashmere? But it is. Whether we carry YSL or Maharishi, it's all
sportswear."</TE>
<TE>   More to the point is a line of ponchos from Lucien Pellat-Finet.
"They look like ponchos you'd buy on the beach in Baja. But the
poncho is in cashmere and it's $2,300."</TE>
<TE>   In other words, surf's up, cognoscenti, and the L.A. dude is still
kicking it, but if you buy anything beyond the Anglo-Saxon pale, it
should be so good and so exquisite that you'll want to keep it around
for a long time--and, like it or not--ponchos, thongs and Western
shirts are as much a part of our classic culture as the black watch
plaid is a part of Scotland's. It's just that there's a time and a
place for everything, and right now neither your boss--nor your blind
date--is likely to appreciate any flights of fancy.</TE>
<TE>   "People are pickier and they're taking more time finding out about
what they buy and what they put in their home," Gordon says. "I think
people are really more interested in 'curating' their style. A lot of
luxury products have been so mass marketed or knocked off, and now
it's about finding things of which you can really take possession."</TE>

<HD>Passion That Speaks Volumes</HD>
<DH>Santa Ana's Lion of Bilingual Literacy Has a Loud Roar</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENNIFER MENA</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Rueben Martinez runs like a loco. A couple of days in the life of
Santa Ana's community bookstore mastermind and bilingual literacy
activist go something like this: Back in town after talking
literature with college students in Fayetteville, Ark., Martinez
heads to La Brea Head Start to inspire Spanish-speaking parents to
read to their children. One evening later, he's urging students in
the graduate teaching program at Cal State Long Beach to include
Latino literature in their curriculums. Then it's back to Libreria
Martinez Books and Art Gallery, his bilingual bookshop (and de facto
community center) in Santa Ana, where Cheech Marin will sign his new
art book. No sooner is the event over than Martinez cranks up a
rented truck for a 25-hour drive to the Houston installment of this
year's Latino Book &amp; Family Festival, the annual event he helped
establish. Along the way, of course, he'll squeeze in a few sales
stops at schools and libraries and a pro-literacy event in San
Antonio with actor Edward James Olmos, a friend and fellow activist.</LD>
<TE>   That's not the half of it. Last year, Martinez opened a second
store, Libreria Para Ninos, adjacent to his original store even as
industry reports had many independent booksellers closing their
doors. Come Nov. 2 and 3, he'll be at the Los Angeles Convention
Center for the L.A. gathering of the multi-city book festival he
developed in 1997 with Olmos and Kirk Whisler, founder of the
National Assn. of Hispanic Publications. The event draws nearly
60,000 people a year in Los Angeles. "We are taking books to our
gente [people]," Martinez says. "Latinos are cuentistas,
storytellers. We need to get the word out that books can be the key
for them to get ahead. They make you think, they keep you in school.
I want to be the one to take that message out there."</TE>
<TE>   Before his visit with the Cal State Long Beach grad students,
Martinez quipped: "I don't know why they want me to speak to them.
They have more education than I ever will." Well, maybe, if you
measure education only in sheepskin. Martinez, 62, left the Arizona
mining town where he grew up about 40 years ago for a life in
California and stopped his formal schooling in his early 20s after
attending barber school. During 27 years as a barber in Santa Ana,
Martinez watched the Latino population grow in his community. He
campaigned for John F. Kennedy. He organized pickets supporting
Caesar Chavez's grape boycott and opposed Proposition 187, a ballot
measure to deny myriad public services to illegal immigrants. There
were always a few books on hand in the barbershop--and then Martinez
read a Spanish-language Reader's Digest article stating that Latino
families spent more on chewing gum than books. In 1993 he opened
Libreria Martinez Books and Art Gallery (haircuts still offered) with
then-business partner Diana Hernandez. The store has occupied its
current 7,000-square-foot space since 1999.</TE>
<TE>   "He ended up creating one of the great bookstores in Southern
California," Olmos says. Today, the 2-year-old Libreria Para Ninos
next door has one of the highest percentages of Spanish-language
books (65%) of any children's bookstore in the country.</TE>
<TE>   Martinez's brightly painted bilingual-stock stores are among the
few institutions in Santa Ana to reflect the city's language
demographics. According to the 2000 census, about 70% of Santa Ana's
nearly 340,000 residents speak Spanish. But with more Latino authors
in print and more books being released simultaneously in Spanish and
English, Latino publishing is gradually coming into its own. These
days, when Martinez talks about Carlos Fuentes, Sandra Cisneros and
Jorge Ramos, he's not name-dropping authors, he's just telling you
who is appearing at the bookstore this fall. Ramos, an anchor for
Univision and author of several books, requested a signing at
Martinez's store to promote his new autobiography this fall after
switching from a Spanish-language publisher to HarperCollins, where
publicists had not scheduled a Santa Ana stop. "There is not a
bookstore in the United States that can attract more people for a
book like mine," says Ramos, who drew about 3,000 people to Martinez
Books in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Trim and almond-skinned, with a salty mustache, Martinez still
gives the occasional haircut and greets all comers with small-town
charm, often switching between English and Spanish in mid-sentence.
He affectionately calls the kids who come in for books, free art
classes and readings "mija [my daughter]" or "mijo [my son]."</TE>
<TE>   That personal touch doesn't stop with the store. Aware that
potential readers may not be able to patronize a retail bookstore,
Martinez goes out of his way to include libraries and schools on his
client list, packing his 1986 Volvo station wagon (odometer reading:
300,000 miles) for sales calls during literary road trips. "This is a
passion business,'' he says. "Literature to me is numero uno en este
mundo."</TE>

<LD>When a photo from the hush-hush Taos, N.M., nuptials of Julia Roberts
and cameraman Daniel Moder hit the cover of People magazine in July,
no one was more surprised than the bridal gown designer. "I did not
know the dress was for a wedding," insists L.A. couturier Judith
Bodart-Beylerian, who made several pieces for Roberts after meeting
the actress through a friend. "It was a secret for me, too."</LD>
<LD>   Creating a wedding gown for a gorgeous Oscar-winning film star
might seem like a PR mother lode, but this is the age of the
confidentiality agreement, and Bodart-Beylerian is a woman of her
word. Within 24 hours of the ceremony, the indie designer, whose
business card reads "art couture," was ducking inquiries from fashion
editors and TV producers around the world. "I didn't answer the phone
for 10 days," she says, almost apologetically, in a lilting French
accent.</LD>
<TE>   On the Pretty Woman subject, Bodart-Beylerian still isn't talking,
except to say the experience was "a huge honor" and "a really good
time.'' But it's fair to call the whimsically romantic
gown--described as a "full-length Empire dress with a twist of the
Bohemian''--typical of the designer's signature style. The pale pink
cotton halter gown was decorated with handiwork that included pearls,
embroidered antique beads and hand-painted flowers, all details
favored by Beylerian, who makes each piece by hand and prefers
natural fibers along with materials such as upholstery fabric and
metal.</TE>
<TE>   Bodart-Beylerian, a native of France, was born into a family of
artists and craftsmen. She learned to sew from her mother, a graphic
designer and painter, and her grandmother, also a painter. "They
showed me everything I know about style, beauty and texture." She
apprenticed as a graphic designer before finding her calling three
years ago while creating three dresses for her own wedding to L.A.
artist Gregory Beylerian.</TE>
<TE>   Commissions for Bodart-Beylerian's one-of-a-kind designs come by
word of mouth. Many pieces reflect the five years she lived on
Reunion Island near Madagascar and two years in the Caribbean. "I'll
mix a little of the Middle Ages with Asian and contemporary," says
Bodart-Beylerian, who would like to design for theater or film. The
term "art couture" on her business card is meant to be playful. "With
'fashion designer' you put yourself in a category," she says. "It's
not only about fashion and style; it's about dreams and life."</TE>

<HD>STUART SPENCER HAS A FEW ZINGERS LEFT</HD>
<DH>Why Does the Man Who Helped Create Modern Politics and
Loves the GOP Lament the Current State of Both?</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mark Z. Barabak</AU>
<BD>Mark Z. Barabak is a Times staff writer who covers
politics. He last wrote for the magazine about Arnold
Schwarzenegger's political aspirations.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>High above Palm Springs, past the intersection of Bob Hope and Frank
Sinatra drives, lives a celebrity of a different sort, a man as
famous and influential in his way as either of those two legends.
There is no desert boulevard immortalizing Stuart K. Spencer. Not
even a side street or alley. But of the three men, he arguably had
the most important impact on world events, helping shape history from
a place just offstage. Along with his business partner, the late Bill
Roberts, Spencer virtually invented the modern practice of political
consulting. More importantly, Spencer and Roberts took a washed-up
movie actor, Ronald Reagan, and cast him as something new and
vibrant, something they called a "citizen-politician." With their
assistance, Reagan romped to the California governorship and,
eventually, the White House.</LD>
<LD>   Not bad, Spencer says, for a guy who started with $500, a degree
from Cal State Los Angeles and dreams (back when he ran the city
parks in Alhambra) of coaching big-time college football. On a
playing field or inside a smoky back room, competition, not ideology,
is what has always driven Spencer. This is not to say that he lacks a
strong set of core beliefs--those might surprise people who associate
him with Reagan's iconic conservatism.</LD>
<TE>   Now 75, Spencer is semiretired and living the luxe life with his
wife, Barbara. There is the posh home in Palm Desert (two hip
replacements keep him off his private tennis court), an Oregon ranch
where he spends summers, and a condo in Maui for golf getaways. He
does a bit of lobbying--"influence peddling," as he calls it--and
dispenses wisdom via phone and fax to a generation of campaign
disciples who revere the salty Spencer as a kind of mountaintop sage.
There are no regrets. "Anything I did, I did ... met a lot of great
people. Met a lot of [jerks]. I saw a lot of the world."</TE>
<TE>   The present and future, though, are cause for concern. He laments
the state of modern political campaigning--"the monster Bill and I
created"--with its reductive emphasis on polling, focus groups and
fund-raising. And he worries about the continued viability of the
Republican Party, particularly in California, where the GOP is
struggling to shed an image of exclusion and intolerance.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to show some openness to bring people in and let the
debate rage within the party," he says. "I mean, as long as we're
going to be a basically two-party state or nation, there's going to
have to be a lot of room in both parties for points of view. The
Democrats since the Clinton era ... have really broadened their base.
They've moved toward the middle ... a lot. I think the Republicans
got to sort of do the same thing."</TE>
<TE>   For his valedictory, Spencer has turned the courtship of estranged
Latinos into something of a personal crusade. "Our party has a sad
and politically self-defeating history of alienating immigrant groups
and new voters," he said in a scathing assessment, dispatched five
years ago as an open letter to fellow Republicans. "The GOP closed
the door to the Irish and the Italian immigrants in Massachusetts and
New York in the last century. We did the same to Poles and other
Eastern Europeans in Chicago and other urban centers."</TE>
<TE>   With the explosive growth of the Latino population, today's choice
is simple, Spencer said: The Republican Party can change, or consign
itself to permanent minority status.</TE>
<TE>   Stu Spencer is hosting lunch, root beer and sandwiches, in the
super-sized RV garage he turned into his home office. He is wearing
blue shorts, deck shoes, little white ankle socks and a gray-striped
polo shirt splotched with mustard, which he has not bothered to
change for company. His flagrant disregard for fashion is notorious.
(People still talk of the purple double-knit suit he wore during the
Gerald Ford administration.)</TE>
<TE>   Photos from the Reagan years show him alongside Ronald and
Nancy--at the White House, traveling aboard Air Force One--with tie
askew, collar undone and shirttail flapping out the side. Call it
sloppiness. Others see a welcome lack of pretense and pomposity,
which helps explain how Spencer became such a valued advisor to
Reagan and many other politicians. "There's an absence of arrogance,
of attitude and posturing on his part, that's refreshing in this
business," says Don Sipple, a Republican campaign strategist who has
known and admired Spencer for close to 30 years.</TE>
<TE>   That contempt for stuffiness and self-import also helps explain
why Spencer never moved to Washington--"a phony town," he harrumphs.
It also kept him off the public payroll--"dealing with the
bureaucracy, I would've gone nuts or gone to jail." Instead Spencer
played an unpaid but vital behind-the-scenes role during Reagan's two
White House terms. When Donald Regan, the imperious chief of staff,
had to go, it was Spencer who flew to Washington to help push him
out. When the Soviet Union shot down Korean Airlines Flight 007 in
1983, killing 269 passengers and sending Cold War shudders across the
continent, it was Spencer who demanded--profanely--that the
vacationing president "come down off the mountain and read a
statement." Reagan resisted, but gave in.</TE>
<TE>   Spencer is renowned for just that sort of unvarnished advice. When
he worked for President Ford in 1976 (during his one serious split
with Reagan), it fell to Spencer to dissuade the hapless campaigner
from venturing too far beyond the Rose Garden. Others hemmed and
hawed. "Forgive me, Mr. President," Spencer told him, "but as much as
you love it, you're a [expletive] campaigner."</TE>
<TE>   He pulled it all off with a wink and a smile. He was blunt-spoken,
fought hard and sometimes played mean. (In 1976, when Reagan ran
against Ford in the Republican primary, Spencer produced a
Reagan-is-warmonger ad and aired it in his home state of California
just to give him fits.) But for all of the obvious irreverence,
Spencer always abided by his own quiet code of honor. He would never
back a challenger against an incumbent, hence his work for Ford. It
was always a respectful "Mr. President," even alone between the two
of them. And he never cashed in by writing one of those tell-all
tomes, despite lucrative opportunities. It is wrong, he says, to know
a man intimately, to watch up close as he falters and flails, then
turn a profit on his trust.</TE>
<TE>   He was born Stuart Murphy, but took the name of the man who raised
him. A. Kenneth Spencer was a GOP activist who helped Richard M.
Nixon win his first race for Congress. Stu Spencer was politically
indifferent; after leaving the Navy, he cast his first presidential
vote for Democrat Harry Truman, though he later came to like Ike.</TE>
<TE>   In 1954, Spencer was working for the parks department in Alhambra
and recruiting for the Junior Chamber of Commerce when a Republican
up-and-comer, John Rousselot, made an offer: He would join the
Chamber if Spencer would join the GOP. Spencer took to politics right
away--it was like sports, with winners and losers--and after
volunteering in a series of campaigns, he eventually got a job as an
organizer for the Los Angeles County GOP. There he met Bill Roberts,
a former TV salesman. After a year working for the party, they left
and started their own firm with a $1,000 stake. They flipped a
quarter. Spencer called heads and won, so Spencer-Roberts it was.</TE>
<TE>   Philosophic purity was no virtue; pragmatism was no vice. They
worked for everyone in the Republican Party--from the
archconservative Rousselot, winning him a House seat, to the
left-leaning U.S. Sen. Tom Kuchel. It was only later, when they could
afford it, that Spencer-Roberts became more selective in its
clientele.</TE>
<TE>   Spencer calls himself a moderate Republican. He hates big
government and believes in a strong defense. He favors legalized
abortion, affirmative action and certain gun controls. He disdains
the pigeon-holing nature of political debate. "We live in a
single-issue society," he says. "I am not a single-issue person."</TE>
<TE>   Reagan may have been conservative, but he was practical, too, and
that may explain their kinship. Both men liked to win.</TE>
<TE>   Spencer relates the famous story of how Reagan ended up hiring
Spencer-Roberts to manage his successful 1966 run for governor.
Working for Nelson Rockefeller in the 1964 presidential primary, the
pair ran a vicious campaign against Barry Goldwater, falling just shy
of an upset. About a year later, Reagan visited Goldwater, who told
him, "If I ran in California, I'd hire those sons of bitches
Spencer-Roberts."</TE>
<TE>   Spencer laughs, a deep, rich guffaw. "It shows the pragmatism of
Ronald Reagan," he says. "He knew what we did."</TE>
<TE>   In the last few years, Spencer has taken to chiding his fellow
Republicans for squandering the good will of Latino voters, speaking
bitterly from personal experience. In the 1950s, as a Republican
Party volunteer, he opened a community service center in East Los
Angeles, offering free polio shots, immigration counseling and legal
advice. "I was trying to plant a seed," he says. As soon as he quit
the party post, the GOP shut the center down.</TE>
<TE>   More recently, he blames former Gov. Pete Wilson, a decades-old
friend, for turning illegal immigration into a wedge issue in his
1994 reelection campaign. "Did a lot for Wilson," he says. "Didn't do
a lot for the party."</TE>
<TE>   Even after 40 years and, by his estimation, 400 campaigns, Spencer
still relishes a good political scrap. He leans forward, sweeping his
thick forearms back and forth across the table, as he sizes up the
governor's race in Hawaii. His friend, Linda Lingle, is vying to end
years of Democratic rule by purging the puritans and litmus-testers
from the Republican establishment. It is a model, he suggests, for
California's struggling GOP.</TE>
<TE>   "She took over the party chairmanship, she wiped all those sons of
bitches out of the party that had their single issues they wanted to
worry about. Took abortion out of the platform, period. And she's got
her state committee, which is a cross-section of niseis
[second-generation Japanese Americans], Hawaiians ... the whole
thing. Win or lose, the Republican Party in Hawaii is going to be a
FAC-tor," he says, chortling.</TE>
<TE>   It is an infectious laugh--filled with years of hope and cynicism
and knowledge that comes from many decades down.</TE>

<LD>I first experienced culture shock in second grade. We had just moved
from Echo Park to Laurel Canyon, and my familiar, freewheeling Area H
Alternative School was beginning to seem too faraway. Against their
own inclinations as much as mine, my parents enrolled me in Carpenter
Avenue Elementary in Studio City, and suddenly I was thrust into a
world of linoleum and chalkboards, lessons and homework. I hadn't yet
learned to read, or even to sit in a chair--at the alternative
school, we sat "Indian style"--but that wasn't the only reason I felt
a desperate need to catch up.</LD>
<LD>   My new classmates were unlike any kids I'd met before. They were
whiter, wealthier, better groomed. They ate carefully packed lunches.
They wore designer jeans. They played kick ball. They were like kids
on television. In some cases, they were kids on television. The whole
environment was alarmingly, alluringly normal.</LD>
<LD>   It was, in short, the Valley.</LD>
<TE>   I lived on the other side of the hill, in our new and, for the
mid-'70s, very avant-garde (read weird) house that was a brief but
crucial distance from the all-important dividing line of Mulholland
Drive. Nonetheless, the house lay within the Studio City school
district, and soon the Valley became the center of gravity for my
family. We did our grocery shopping in the Valley. We ate pancakes at
the Studio City Du-par's. I bought model airplane kits at Kit Kraft.
I opened my first bank account at the Ventura Boulevard branch of the
now-defunct Imperial Savings, where the tellers actually knew me by
name. For a while, I even rode what was in those days a Valley kid
trademark: a skateboard. Mine was an early-model fiberglass Hobie to
which I was very attached despite my inability to stay on it for more
than a minute at a time.</TE>
<TE>   Still, even two years into my Valley stint, I had a nagging fear
that I would be exposed as an alien. My grade-school peers didn't
live in houses covered in corrugated metal. Their parents didn't
smoke anything more illicit than a cigarette. To Valley kids, I
discovered all too soon, "the City" was unknown and dangerous, and
slightly declasse. (This was an attitude toward Los Angeles that I
wouldn't encounter again until I attended graduate school in Irvine,
a city that makes the Valley look like, well, the City.) l didn't
want to admit to living in such a place. But I didn't want to lie
either. When people asked whether I lived in the Valley, I always
said, "Sorta."</TE>
<TE>   I'm sure I wasn't the only one in the Valley to feel as if he'd
been dropped from outer space. One of my classmates at Carpenter was
Moon Unit Zappa. She lived close to me, in the hills, and I once even
got a ride home in the Zappa Rolls. When, years later, her single
"Valley Girl" came out ("OK fine, Fer sure, fer sure..."), I knew a
not-so-secret truth about her: Moon wasn't really from the Valley,
any more than she really talked like that. She was a Lady of the
Canyon, to quote Joni Mitchell, not a Valley Girl. Her song was
satiric, poking fun at the trendiness and materialism of Valley
youth. But I suspect it also hid a bit of that wistful yearning you
can't help feeling when you grow up so close to the Valley yet so
apart from it, when your own family diverges so dramatically from the
ideal of normalcy that the Valley embodies. And whose family diverged
more than hers?</TE>
<TE>   As time passed, I stopped being embarrassed in the Valley and
started being embarrassed by the Valley. In junior high I was safely
returned to a magnet school on the other side of the hill. I would
hang out in Santa Monica with friends from the Westside, my new
heroes of upper-middle-class cool. When we entered one of the
underpasses that led out to the beach, I always stared at the
graffiti scrawled across the concrete: "Vals Go Home!" In the surf
vernacular of the time, a "Val" was the epitome of everything bad: a
nonlocal geek wannabe. (Just as later, among my more bohemian
friends, the Valley would come to represent all the worst suburban
sins: racism, NIMBYism, bourgeois conformity.) I no longer went to
school in the Valley, but I still lived close enough to fear
contamination. Was I the one being told to go home?</TE>
<TE>   By the time I was a teenager, my parents had separated,
compounding my sense of homelessness. Because I was free to come and
go at will, they seldom knew where I was; I hardly knew myself.
Chances were I wasn't at a party or a club or raising any kind of
teen hell. Instead, I was driving back and forth across the length of
the Santa Monica Mountains. Other kids cruised Sunset or Whittier
boulevards, I cruised Mulholland--usually alone. From most spots on
Mulholland, the view is of either Valley or City, rather than both at
once, as if their connection to each other were nothing more than a
quixotic notion, disproved by the land itself. But every so often as
my car rounded a bend or reached a crest, the view exceeded 180
degrees, and for a moment I got a vision of an expansive urban
ecosystem broken into many parts, but nonetheless vital and
beautiful. It was for those fleeting feelings of togetherness that I
drove.</TE>
<TE>   As every student of Los Angeles history knows, William Mulholland
was the city engineer who diverted Sierra water from the once-verdant
Owens Valley to drought-prone Southern California. That grand-scale
act of thievery led to the development of the San Fernando Valley as
well as to the annexation of the Valley by the City of Los Angeles.
How fitting that the scenic drive named after Mulholland is now the
front line in a civil war that may lead to the diversion of financial
resources from the city. Opponents of Valley secession call it a
"divorce"; good for people, bad for cities, goes the sentiment.</TE>
<TE>   For hill dwellers, the word is especially apt. We are the children
caught between fighting parents, the one wanting to leave, the other
not wanting to let go. We cannot choose sides because in each side we
recognize ourselves. With the secession possibility looming, we worry
about who will pave our streets and who will put out our fires. But
our deeper worry is this: Our family is breaking up, and we won't
have a city to call home.</TE>

<LD>Airline tickets -- An article in the Sept. 29 section said that
several airlines no longer allow travelers to apply unused,
nonrefundable tickets to new flights for up to one year. It should
have added that these tickets generally can be used after the booked
flight has departed as long as travelers cancel the reservation in
advance and rebook for a later date (subject to fees and

<KH>WEEKEND ESCAPE</KH>
<HD>In Oxnard, near-bliss at a beach resort</HD>
<DH>Large suites, plenty of sand and an ocean of nearby outlet
shopping possibilities make this a sweet retreat.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>Oxnard</DL>
<LD>The morning people were out in force -- fishing, jogging, throwing
pretzels to hungry sea gulls.</LD>
<LD>   Pretzels?</LD>
<LD>   "I usually have bread, but I ran out this morning," Oxnard
resident Casey Schneberg said with a laugh as she tossed a handful of
fat pretzels in the air, to the delight of about 30 Western gulls
that screeched and flapped and bounded into the sky as they jockeyed
for the crumbs.</LD>
<TE>   It was 7:55 a.m. on a bright late-September Sunday. Saturday had
dawned with a bad case of the drizzles, which made Sunday morning's
clear golden sunrise all the more special. The beach had that fresh,
washed-clean feeling that follows a rain.</TE>
<TE>   Co-worker Gail Fisher and I were in Ventura County taking
advantage of fall discount rates at the Embassy Suites Mandalay Beach
Resort. We had arrived with plans for a weekend of heavy-duty
shopping at Camarillo Premium Outlets, a 120-store mall along U.S.
101. On the side, we would visit a few of Ventura County's wine bars,
do some sightseeing and probably catch some rays. It was a good thing
rays ranked low on our priority list, given Saturday's gloomy skies.</TE>
<TE>   No matter. Ralph Lauren, Ann Taylor and Kenneth Cole were waiting,
and they didn't disappoint.</TE>
<TE>   Our getaway had started Friday evening at the 284-room Mandalay
Beach Resort, where weekend rates often exceed $200. We had planned
to spend only one night there, but when I called for reservations I
found the lowest rate, the $169 "suite retreat," required a two-night
stay. At least it did on this particular weekend.</TE>
<TE>   "Pricing varies," marketing and sales director Susan Koehler said
a few days later when I asked about the shifting rules that seem to
govern the hotel's rates. "If we begin to fill up, the price goes up.
If bookings are soft, the price goes down. If you call early, you're
more likely to get low rates. We're just like the airline industry.</TE>
<TE>   "And you have to admit we have a very special property here."</TE>
<TE>   She was right about that.</TE>
<TE>   Southern California has few on-the-sand hotels. Some hotels call
themselves beachfront but are actually across the highway from the
beach or high on a bluff.</TE>
<TE>   Embassy Suites Mandalay Beach is on the sand. If you're in an
oceanfront room in Building 3 or 6, your door opens onto a lush patch
of grass that melds into the beach. About 200 yards in front of you,
waves are crashing, surfers are hanging ten and seabirds are soaring.
Anacapa and Santa Cruz islands hang lazily on the horizon.</TE>
<TE>   That doesn't happen if you purchase the $169 fall special. In that
case, your room may face an interior courtyard or another building
or, in our case, a park- ing ramp.</TE>
<TE>   Chino residents Jesse and Jennie Isom -- Building 6, Room 102 --
knew better.</TE>
<TE>   "The first time we came, we tried the special rate and regretted
it," Jennie said as she and her husband sat outside their
ground-floor, oceanfront room Saturday night watching waves pound the
shore. "Now we splurge. We don't come as often, but when we do, we're
on the beach." Their room cost $279 per night that weekend, with a
two-night minimum stay required. (In summer, the same room would cost
$379 per night.)</TE>
<TE>   The hotel, which opened in 1986, is Spanish Mission style: three
floors of tan stucco, dark brown wood trim and red-tiled roofs. There
are four waterfalls, two spas and a pool.</TE>
<TE>   Our suite was comfortable and a big 800 square feet. It had two
baths, two TVs, a refrigerator, a microwave and a queen-size fold-out
bed in the living room. The wraparound veranda made it feel more
spacious -- and allowed us to look down into the subterranean parking
garage. The carpeting was a bit worn, and some of the wallpaper
seemed mismatched, but everything was clean, and I thought the king
bed in the master bedroom was comfortable. Gail wasn't quite as
enthusiastic about the fold-out; she thought the mattress was lumpy
and said it left her with a backache in the morning.</TE>
<TE>   The size of the rooms can make the hotel a good deal for families.
But perhaps the biggest boon for parents with kids, and other
visitors too, is the complimentary receptions morning and night in
the Surf Room next to the pool. A large breakfast buffet, with
cooked-to-order eggs, start a guest's day, and mixed drinks, wine,
beer and snacks are available for two hours each evening. Saturday
night, I had a Cape Cod: vodka and cranberry juice. Or was it two?
Probably two, because when Gail and I left the Surf Room we couldn't
find our way back to our parking ramp-view room, getting lost in the
extensive leafy gardens.</TE>
<TE>   Hotel employees compare the grounds to a Hawaiian resort. That
assessment is a bit inflated. While the central courtyard is verdant,
it isn't tropical. But the hotel's circular, palapa-style dining
room, Capistrano's, would fit in well at any Maui or Kauai resort. We
tried it and were happy with the food and service. The tablecloths
were crisp, the flowers fresh, the sourdough bread crusty. Gail's
Chilean sea bass served with garlic-marinated scallops ($24.50) was a
hit. My chicken Caesar salad ($9.75) was light and fresh.</TE>
<TE>   Saturday morning we drove into neighboring Camarillo. Before
tackling the mall, we dropped by a newly renovated historic home, the
Camarillo Ranch, built in 1892 by city father Adolfo Camarillo. The
huge Queen Anne-style mansion endured years of neglect before the
city obtained a $500,000 grant from California to restore it. It
opened for tours last December; visitors are welcome on Wednesdays
and weekends.</TE>
<TE>   Grandeur and glamour</TE>
<TE>   The 17-room house is a snapshot in time, richly decorated with
period furniture and photos. Docents in turn-of-the-century attire
lead visitors through the 6,000-square-foot building, pointing out
the 12-foot ceilings, six fireplaces and two staircases.</TE>
<TE>   The home had been the center of a 10,000-acre ranch that attracted
politicians and celebrities, including silent film star Tom Mix and
glamour queen Rita Hayworth. Now the 4 1/2-acre property is popular
with brides, who pay $2,200 to hold weddings on the grounds. On the
day we visited, rain came at just the wrong time for the bridal
party. But it didn't drive them inside; they said a little rain
brings good luck to a marriage.</TE>
<TE>   Interesting logic, we thought. Perhaps the rain would bring us
good luck at our next stop: the Camarillo Premium Outlets.</TE>
<TE>   Let's see, will it be the black wool coat at Barneys New York,
discounted from $645 to $419?</TE>
<TE>   How about the slinky $320 red velvet dress with faux fur collar at
the Betsey Johnson store?</TE>
<TE>   Decisions, decisions ...</TE>
<TE>   The upscale outlet center, which opened in 1995, draws about 10
million visitors a year. Its sister mall, Desert Hills Premium
Outlets in Cabazon near Palm Springs, serves a somewhat higher-end
clientele with shops such as Prada, Armani and Gucci. But the
Camarillo center has more than enough stores to choose from.</TE>
<TE>   We dodged raindrops as we made the rounds, and then decided a
glass or two of wine might be nice to celebrate our excellent
purchases.</TE>
<TE>   We were in the right place. Ventura County has developed a
thriving wine bar scene, places where oenophiles can choose from a
large by-the-glass selection or try small wine samples grouped by
region or varietal.</TE>
<TE>   Our first stop was at Wine Lovers in downtown Ventura. This funky
club, which opened seven years ago, is the oldest wine bar in the
area and was fun the night we visited. Customers can hear live music
Wednesdays through Saturdays. Outside the front door is a stairway
leading to a hillside patio where you can sit at small stone-slab
tables, drinking wine and eating free pizzas baked in front of you in
a wood-burning fireplace. The wine list changes frequently; prices
range from $5 to $10 per glass. Portions are bountiful.</TE>
<TE>   From there we moved on to J's Tapas, also in downtown Ventura.
This small storefront tavern specializes in martinis but also pours
36 wines by the glass. Prices range from $5 to $10.50. Portions are
small. We would have liked to try something from the tapas menu, but
the kitchen closed about 10 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   That made us realize it was late. It wouldn't do to get overtired.
We still had another day to shop.</TE>

<HD>With test rooms, inn at LAX asks guests to snore and tell</HD>
<DH>Giant TVs, Internet gadgets. But what do they really want?
More bathroom door hooks.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jane Engle</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There's something different about Room 267 at the Hilton Garden Inn,
a modest hotel near Los Angeles International Airport that caters
mainly to business travelers.</LD>
<LD>   Lights turn on automatically when you enter the room. A 42-inch,
flat-screen TV looms over the desk, where there's a videophone that
lets you see who's outside your door. A leather massage lounge purrs
nearby. The generous bathroom has a separate shower and a TV-equipped
Jacuzzi, plus European-style fixtures like a towel warmer and a
bidet. Settle into the king-size bed and you sink in -- way in.</LD>
<LD>   Hilton Hotels Corp. dubs this the "Room of the Future." It's the
most technologically advanced of 14 rooms at the inn where the
Beverly Hills-based conglomerate tests new features for its many
hotel-chain brands, including Embassy Suites, Doubletree and Hampton
Inn. Each room has different door hooks, soap dishes, shower heads
and other fixtures. One is a resort-style suite complete with garden
patio. The rest of the 162-room hotel operates as a regular Hilton
Garden Inn.</LD>
<TE>   Guests are the guinea pigs here. Members of Hilton HHonors, the
company's rewards club for frequent travelers, are randomly assigned
to the 14 rooms as upgrades, says Barbara Bejan, the hotel's
friendly, efficient general manager. Most mornings between 6:30 and
7:30 you can find her polling the breakfast crowd in the dining area,
asking guests what they thought of the rooms. Their answers help
determine how Hilton designs new hotels.</TE>
<TE>   "We're always trying to figure out what's the next thing," says
Dennis Koci, Hilton's senior vice president of operations support.</TE>
<TE>   So am I. Which is why I recently toured the test rooms.</TE>
<TE>   Chains typically introduce features in one or two hotels at a
time, but Hilton is unusual in using a single place as a laboratory
for the whole company, Koci says. The 14-room wing of the Hilton
Garden Inn LAX/El Segundo has served that purpose since the hotel
opened in 2000. The test rooms are continually undergoing change and
have been redesigned about three times in two years.</TE>
<TE>   The company hit on the idea after a costly misadventure a few
years ago, when it equipped the 2,000-plus-room Hilton New York with
pioneering "smart cards." The cards have computer chips that combine
the functions of a room key and, potentially, credit cards and phone
cards. But the combination technology never caught on, and the cards
were expensive to replace when lost, costing the hotel tens of
thousands of dollars. Small-scale experiments suddenly looked good.</TE>
<TE>   The "Room of the Future" tries to satisfy some contradictory
goals. Travelers want their home away from home to be cozy but
equipped with the latest TV and Internet gizmos; welcoming to
visitors but safe from strangers; luxurious but not costly. It's a
big order for a 390-square-foot space.</TE>
<TE>   For security, there are the motion-sensor lights, the videophone,
a safe with digital keypad and an electronic "Do not disturb" sign
activated from inside the room. Besides high-speed Internet service,
cordless phone and the big-screen TV, there's a remote control that
taps into a digital entertainment world with hundreds of TV shows,
movies and music CDs. For luxury, there's the shower with several
shower heads and the bidet-toilet with seat warmer.</TE>
<TE>   And then there's the bed. It's positioned at a 45-degree angle to
the wall for what Hilton hopes will induce a "warmer, more open
feeling."</TE>
<TE>   Using air baffles supported by wood slats instead of springs, it
molds to your body shape and weight, purportedly to eliminate tossing
and turning. Each half of the bed, which is also used in some
hospitals, can be adjusted separately, lowering or raising the foot
or head at different angles for two sleepers.</TE>
<TE>   General Manager Bejan slept on it for three months. Every morning,
"I woke up exactly where I had been," she reports. "It was like I was
mummified." She loved it, but it's not for everyone, especially at
$2,500 to $3,000 per bed.</TE>
<TE>   "The first night, we don't get a positive reaction," says Koci,
the operations executive. But some guests later grow to like it.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, what keeps hotel rooms from being more cutting-edge is
that they can't depart too much from what we're used to, he says. We
have only a brief time to adapt.</TE>
<TE>   To that end, Koci and his crew have puzzled over how to make the
remote unit more user-friendly. "Otherwise," he worries, "you're
handing manuals to guests."</TE>
<TE>   Some customers complain to Bejan that the "Room of the Future"
lacks a microwave, a standard fixture of Hilton Garden Inns. "Two
hundred thousand dollars' worth of features, and they want a
microwave," Koci says with mock horror.</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, Bejan says, guests rave about a low-tech
accouterment in some test rooms: a double hook on the bathroom door,
so that they can hang more stuff. "Long Beach is changing all of
theirs," she says.</TE>
<TE>   Whether we're ready or not, Hilton is looking seriously at even
more room technology. Goodbye, bland pictures on the wall; hello,
video screens that you can program to show your favorite art, be it
Rembrandt or Picasso. How about a climate control system that emits
the soothing sounds and smells of rainfall while projecting TV images
of a jungle?</TE>
<TE>   Here's my favorite: a self-cleaning bathroom. The housekeeper
closes the door and pushes a button, and jets in the ceiling, floor
and walls spray steam and sanitizing chemicals throughout the room.</TE>
<TE>   I don't know if this would speed me to a Hilton on my next trip.
But I'd order one for my home in a New York minute.</TE>

<HD>Savoring a fine old port</HD>
<DH>With its quaint harbor and Franco-American links, La
Rochelle delivers history (and seafood) on a platter.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Peter Wortsman</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL>La Rochelle, France</DL>
<LD>We didn't take long to RSVP when friends who are renovating a
200-year-old farmhouse near La Rochelle invited us to visit in
August. "It'll be good for the children's sense of history," said my
French wife, Claudie, a college professor. I readily agreed, noting
the proximity to Cognac, where the world's most famous brandy was
born, and to Marennes-Oleron, France's finest oyster bed. And there
was La Rochelle's new aquarium, a tantalizing lure for the kids.</LD>
<LD>   Of course, there was also the setting and the scenery.</LD>
<LD>   La Rochelle has one of the best -- and most picturesque -- harbors
along the Atlantic Coast, as well as western France's largest
yachting basin. The entrance to the Vieux (Old) Port is guarded by
two 14th century towers, the Tour St. Nicolas  and the Tour de la
Chaine, from which links of the chain that once blocked the harbor at
night still dangle. The view toward town is also impressive: An
outsize clock tower rears its domed head above the town gate,
dwarfing all other dwellings. Arcades and stately mansions grace
medieval byways that play hide-and-seek in the folds of time.</LD>
<TE>   We arrived at our friends' house on a Wednesday night and enjoyed
their hospitality the next day. But that made us slow in getting
started for our actual destination. We finally rolled into La
Rochelle at twilight, when the gulls fly low and the sky closes in,
reclaiming the city from the sea.</TE>
<TE>   Our little clan of four joined a group of 80 or so spectators near
the Tour St. Nicolas, the fortified, slightly off-kilter keep named
for the patron saint of mariners. We awaited the appearance of a
guide to lead us on the Ronde de Nuit (Night Watch), a hike through
old La Rochelle organized on Thursday nights from early July to
mid-September by the local tourist office.</TE>
<TE>   Children don't usually take kindly to historical walking tours,
especially nocturnal ones. But when at last our man emerged from the
tower in medieval garb with staff and lantern, a ring in one ear and
a twinkle in his eye, my kids followed him as if he were the Pied
Piper, racing to keep up with his commentary.</TE>
<TE>   Pointing his staff out to sea, the night watchman (alias Philippe
Laugrand, manager of the welcome center of the La Rochelle tourism
office) launched into the saga of the fishermen, monks, merchants and
mariners who made their mark on this accommodating rock (la roche in
French, thus the name).</TE>
<TE>   The two-hour romp through the past made the cobblestones come
alive. There were encounters with barefoot Franciscans, white-wigged
merchants and women in 18th century decollete, all tourist office
staff. It helped to have good walking shoes and at least a
rudimentary knowledge of French, although the tourist office also
runs walking tours in English.</TE>
<TE>   Returning to La Rochelle the next morning, the Night Watch still
fresh in our minds, we lingered awhile at the Vieux Port, which was
full of small boats. "Will you buy me a toy boat to sail in it?"
asked my 7-year-old son, Jacques, evidently charmed by the harbor's
Lilliputian dimensions.</TE>
<TE>   Toylike to the contemporary eye, this big bathtub hardly seems
large enough to contain all the history that has sailed through. It
was from here that the wines of the Charente, the illustrious brandy
from nearby Cognac, and precious salt harvested from the neighboring
marshes made their way into the world. Here the fiercely independent
Huguenots, who had turned the town into the capital of French
Protestantism, made a last stand before succumbing to the forces of
Cardinal Richelieu. Some sailed all the way to the New World to save
the faith and founded such havens as New Rochelle, N.Y. Later, the
Vieux Port was a pivotal link in the so-called triangular trade with
Africa and the West Indies, harboring heavy vessels laden with
spices, skins and slaves. Fortunes were amassed and lost here by
merchants and ship owners gambling on the trade winds.</TE>
<TE>   Leaving the harbor behind, our crew entered the old city, as
travelers and traders have done for centuries, through the Gothic
Porte de la Grosse-Horloge (Gate of the Big Clock Tower). Continuing
along the Rue du Palais, the city's central axis and shopping street,
we ducked into the palatial courtyard of the Chambre de Commerce,
built in 1749 in the style of a miniature Versailles. We passed the
opulent 18th century residences of the great shipping magnates that
line the stately parallel thoroughfares, Rue Admyrault and Rue de
L'Escale.</TE>
<TE>   We then stopped for a look at the luxurious trappings and human
toll of trade at the Musee du Nouveau Monde (Museum of the New World)
in the refurbished digs of an 18th century merchant family named
Fleuriau.</TE>
<TE>   The museum highlights the exotic and the dark side of the city's
heritage of trade with Africa and the New World, a heritage with
which, for better and for worse, we Americans are deeply bound. Cargo
vessels sailed for Africa laden with French textiles, clocks and
firearms and returned with a hold full of slaves.</TE>
<TE>   The people on board were then shipped back through La Rochelle to
the Americas and the Antilles, where they were sold for sugar,
spices, cotton, coffee and cocoa. Merchant families like the
Fleuriaus invested heavily in plantations on the French enclave of
the island of Santo Domingo, the future Haiti.</TE>
<TE>   Jewels of the sea</TE>
<TE>   After the museum, lunch was a platter of oysters and other seafood
freshly shucked beside the city's former fish market, under the
arcades of the colorful Chez Andre, a beloved local institution since
1947.</TE>
<TE>   Our sightseeing was beginning to try the patience of the junior
members of the crew. My fashion-conscious 12-year-old daughter,
Aurelie, had had it with the trappings of the musty past, insisting
on a shopping spree among the boutiques that line the Rue du Temple.</TE>
<TE>   My son enjoyed his own just recompense at the Aquarium La
Rochelle, on the right bank of the Bassin des Grands Yachts. Built
like a giant fish tank, the aquarium holds 792,000 gallons of water
and 10,000 specimens of sea life. The numbers may seem abstract, but
the sum total is dazzling for children and adults. It is sobering to
stroll through a water tunnel of jellyfish and fathom that these
slimy things have been around for millions of years. The tunnel of
the shark tank was the most popular spot for my son, who jubilantly
declared, "I'd like to live here!"</TE>
<TE>   Expedience demanded that the next day's sightseeing be generously
dosed with child-friendly attractions, such as the Automaton Museum
and the Museum of Scale Models just next door, both of which were
hits. Also popular were the Museum of Natural History and the
Neptunea Maritime Museum, with its access to the weather ship Le
France I.</TE>
<TE>   We had planned to spend only five days in La Rochelle, so in the
two days that remained -- though we had by no means exhausted the
city's riches -- we turned to its environs.</TE>
<TE>   Northeast of La Rochelle, the marshlands of the Marais Poitevin,
intersected by man-made canals called conches, immediately bring to
mind the bayous of Louisiana. Submerged in prehistoric times, the
Marais surfaced as the salt water receded. The region was cultivated
and irrigated by medieval monks, who controlled the water flow with
an intricate system of dikes and dams.</TE>
<TE>   Today the ecologically fragile landscape is rapidly eroding. An
audiovisual show at the Maison des Marais Mouilles, a regional museum
in Coulon, explains the geology and history of the marsh. Just
outside town we spotted a few splendid old cabanes, vintage
whitewashed, water-side houses with colorful shutters, typical of the
region. They line the banks of the Sevre Niortaise River.</TE>
<TE>   We wanted to explore these wetlands, known as Venise Verte, or
Green Venice. In the village of La Garette, we found a little black
skiff steered by a strong-armed guide who used a hooked pole not
unlike the Venetian gondolier's oar to ram the boat down sleepy
waterways.</TE>
<TE>   Along the way we saw a poule d'eau, or water chicken, with
atrophied wings and webbed feet; a slithering black eel; and a diving
nutria, a native of North America originally imported for its fur.
Tall, straight-backed poplar trees that line the conches were
imported from Virginia to prevent erosion and subsequently became the
typical trees of the region.</TE>
<TE>   The next day we discovered a far more moving Franco-American link
in Rochefort, a boat-building center and naval arsenal town
established under Louis XIV southeast of La Rochelle. A team of
historians, craftsmen and maritime enthusiasts is rebuilding the
Hermione, the frigate on which the young Gilbert du Motier (a.k.a.
the Marquis de Lafayette) sailed to Boston in 1780 to rejoin the
forces of the American Revolution. Here, in a dry dock of the old
royal maritime arsenal, we climbed into the oak ribs of this mammoth
labor of love. Plans are underway, when the boat is completed in
2008-09, to sail it across the Atlantic into Boston Harbor. The
canopied construction site is part of a vast marine park along the
Charente River.</TE>
<TE>   A taste of history</TE>
<TE>   All this salty fare built up an awful thirst that no common
beverage could quench. Continuing southeast, it was Daddy's turn to
indulge in a city whose name conjures up cultivated sloth.</TE>
<TE>   Billboards along the road to Cognac flash the legendary names of
distilleries: Hennessy, Courvoisier, Remy Martin, Camus, Martell,
Otard, each of which can be visited. Every wall in town is blackened
with a microscopic fungus that thrives on the potent fumes
euphemistically known as la part des anges (the angels' share).
Developed in the late 16th century, brandy was originally a "burnt"
wine, fired to prevent spoilage on long-distance ocean voyages. It
would take 200 years for the firewater of Cognac to evolve into the
king of spirits.</TE>
<TE>   What more fitting place to ponder the pedigree of this elixir than
Chateau de Cognac? The birthplace of King Francois I, the chateau has
been the home of Cognac Otard -- one of the city's most illustrious
distilleries -- since 1795. A guided tour takes you through the royal
residence, including the Helmet Hall, where Richard the Lion-Hearted
once supped, and a reception hall allegedly designed by Leonardo da
Vinci.</TE>
<TE>   In several cellars in the former dungeon known as le Paradis
(Paradise), the oldest casks are left to age in a snow-white coat of
fungus. A soused breed of spider, its state shamelessly revealed in
the asymmetrical weave of its web, feeds on insect larvae and watches
over the precious stash. It takes 60 years to age a cask of Extra,
the highest category of cognac, but it takes less than a minute to
succumb to its divine effects. Every tour ends with a tasting.</TE>
<TE>   Bidding farewell to our friends and to fair La Rochelle on the
last leg of our trip, I shed crocodile tears, my mouth already
watering for the oyster beds of Marennes. We bypassed the
bumper-to-bumper traffic to the Ile d'Oleron, an island overrun in
season, and followed the signs to Marennes' oyster port.</TE>
<TE>   Boats take you out to tour the mother lode, where, in rectangular
rows, washed by the tide, the mollusks fatten to maturity by feeding
on microscopic algae. We had no time for touring but satisfied our
palates at a simple roadside restaurant along a canal where oyster
boats lay beached at low tide.</TE>
<TE>   Shuffling the shells on his plate, my son made a mess. I asked,
"What do you think you're doing?" He said, "I'm sailing into La
Rochelle."</TE>

<LD>Bali bomb shocks travel industry; tours canceled</LD>
<LD>   The bombing on the Indonesian island of Bali that killed scores of
foreigners Oct. 12 caused aftershocks throughout the struggling
travel industry last week, leading tour operators to cancel trips
there.</LD>
<LD>   On Monday, the State Department issued a warning that urged
Americans to avoid travel to Indonesia. It noted that it ordered
nonemergency U.S. government employees and their families to leave.</LD>
<TE>   Club Med stopped accepting new guests at its Bali resort village
after the bombing and was expected to continue the suspension until
at least today, a spokeswoman said. It also canceled excursions for
about 600 vacationers who were already there. It offered to send
customers who had been scheduled to arrive last week to a different
resort or to allow them to book a future trip.</TE>
<TE>   Singapore Air, which added flights to Singapore for travelers
leaving Bali, said it would waive airline-related fees for customers
who are changing their travel plans to Bali.</TE>
<TE>   The bombing also caused start-up Air Paradise International, which
dubbed itself Bali's first international airline, to cancel plans to
start service Oct. 27. No new date was immediately set. The company
said it refunded more than 10,000 tickets for flights between Bali
and Australia.</TE>
<TE>   Although the State Department had issued warnings on Indonesia at
various times in the past, mostly Hindu Bali had been considered
relatively safe from political violence until the Oct. 12 bombing.</TE>

<TE>   A heads-up on natural happenings</TE>
<TE>   Globe-trotters curious about volcanoes, floods, storms, wildfires
and other events at their destinations can find NASA satellite
photographs and details at www.earthobservatory.nasa.gov. (Click on
"natural hazards.") The photos have useful keys that locate the
natural features and explain what the colors mean. A world map
spotlights the affected regions.</TE>
<TE>   The information is updated frequently. "We can often achieve
same-day images from nearly anywhere in the world," says David
Herring, the site's chief editor, who works out of NASA's Goddard
Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Md.</TE>

<TE>   Shipyard fire delays debut of Princess vessel</TE>
<TE>   Princess Cruises canceled sailings of its new Diamond Princess
through Feb. 28, 2004, after a fire broke out on the ship in the
Japanese shipyard where it is being built.</TE>
<TE>   "We're still assessing the damage," spokeswoman Kelly McCarthy
said last week.</TE>
<TE>   The 2,670-passenger vessel was scheduled to make seven-day
round-trip Alaska voyages starting June 15 and 10-day Mexico voyages
starting Sept. 27, 2003.</TE>
<TE>   Passengers were being offered refunds or rebooking on other ships,
depending on the voyage, the line said.</TE>
<TE>   Traveler's notes</TE>
<TE>   Aeromexico will begin nonstop service between San Diego and Loreto
in Baja California on Nov. 14. Flights operate Thursdays and Sundays.
Introductory round-trip fares start at $178.... Delta will begin
seasonal daily nonstop service between Palm Springs and Atlanta on
Dec. 1. The service runs through April 30.... US Airways, which
previously announced that it would begin charging holders of
nonrefundable tickets $100 to fly same-day standby starting Jan. 1,
moved up the date and began charging the fee Oct. 10.... Zagat
Survey's Internet site, www.zagat.com, has stopped offering free
access to restaurant ratings and reviews. Individual subscriptions
cost $14.95 a year; businesses get a reduced rate. "We'd prefer not
to give away what we spend a lot of money creating," said Tim Zagat,
chief executive. He added that as of last week about 30,000
individuals and 60,000 businesses had subscribed.... BritRail is
discounting its Classic Passes and FlexiPasses by 25% for travel Nov.
1 to Feb. 28. The Classic Pass provides consecutive-day, unlimited
travel for varying periods in Britain; the FlexiPass covers various
numbers of nonconsecutive days within a two-month period. With the
discount, adult Classic Passes start at $139 for four days, and adult
FlexiPasses start at $176 for four days of off-peak travel. (877)

<HD>A divine design or a pretentious box?</HD>

<LD>The Westin New York at Times Square, scheduled to make its debut this
weekend with about half its 863 rooms ready for guests, has already
made a splash in the design world -- although not to universal
acclaim.</LD>
<LD>   Publicists describe the 45-story building, sheathed in 8,000
sheets of colored glass, as "split by a curving beam of light that
will soar into the Manhattan skyline and beckon visitors." It's a
"marvel of design" and an "icon for the 21st century," boasts the
hotel's Internet site, www.westinny.com.</LD>
<LD>   The architecture critic for the New Yorker magazine offers a
different opinion in the Oct. 7 issue.</LD>
<TE>   In a three-page review titled "Miami Vice: Is This the Ugliest
Building in New York?" critic Paul Goldberger objects to the curving
line as "all pretense," calls the glass "the ugliest curtain wall in
New York" and describes the "bustle" at the building's base as "one
of the strangest attempts at decorating a box that you are ever
likely to see."</TE>
<TE>   We include a photo so that you can decide.</TE>
<TE>   Goldberger does find things to like, including what he calls the
"splendid" details in the lobby and the "reasonable sophistication
and comfort" of the guest rooms.</TE>
<TE>   John Sweeney, the hotel's general manager, said last week he was
"flattered" that Goldberger devoted so much space to the review. He
said of the hotel, "It has an edge to it. Some people are going to
like it and some are not."</TE>
<TE>   The project, at 270 W. 43rd St., was designed by Arquitectonica of
Miami, known for the Atlantis Condominium on Biscayne Bay, Fla.</TE>
<TE>   The New York hotel includes a nine-story atrium, a lounge, a sushi
bar, a pastry and coffee shop, a fitness center and a spa with
treatment rooms and saunas. Guest rooms come with two-line phones,
high-speed Internet access, a mini-bar, bathrobes and an ironing
board. The main restaurant, Shula's Steak House, is expected to open
next month.</TE>
<TE>   Published room rates start at $439, but be sure to ask about
specials. For information and reservations, call (888) 627-7149 or
(800) 937-8461 or visit the Web site.</TE>

<KH>Destination: Brazil</KH>
<HD>An Amazon for adventurers</HD>
<DH>The three-day 'banana boat' trip is no luxury cruise. But
trade your bed for a hammock and let the journey begin.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Shirley Skeel</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL>Manaus, Brazil</DL>
<LD>Nir Etz-Hadar leaned over the deck rail, looking down on a wharf
overrun with hemp bags, crates of Coca-Cola, oil barrels and
Brazilians as I approached the riverboat Sao Francisco.</LD>
<LD>   He grimaced and waved. "Expect the worst," he called out.</LD>
<LD>   I did. A week earlier, two Danes at my hotel in Manaus, a steaming
city in the heart of the Brazilian jungle, had described the banana
boat ride up the Amazon River as a trip they would "never do again."</LD>
<TE>   I climbed the narrow gangplank, scaled the ladder past the Gypsies
in second class and met my new Israeli friend, Nir, in primeiro
class: a vast floor of steel, skirted by tiny private cabins. Earlier
that morning I had slipped aboard, gripping the ticket I had bought
with my 30 words of Portuguese, and, on an empty deck, hung the new
red hammock that would be my bed for the next three days. Now I faced
a sea of yellow, blue and green hammocks strung from the rafters. I
searched for the wretched thing.</TE>
<TE>   There it was. A fat woman, already pretending to sleep in her own
hammock, lay like a beached whale against mine. On the other side,
someone else's limp hammock hung an arm's length away. I counted. In
all, 80 hammocks were slotted like poker chips into about 150 square
yards of deck space.</TE>
<TE>   The cruise down the Amazon between Manaus, Brazil's former
rubber-trading capital, and the colonial city of Belem on the
Atlantic Ocean is a 1,100-mile run on the world's largest river in
volume. Costing only $60 (meals included) for a three-day trip,
thanks to Brazil's plunging currency, it is a magnet for budget
travelers who come to experience local life in the raw. That,
unerringly, is what they get.</TE>
<TE>   At 46, I am not the typical young adventure-seeker who chooses to
take a public riverboat down the Amazon rather than luxuriating in
one of the tourist cruisers at several times the price. But giving up
an air-conditioned cabin and a soft bed for an opportunity to mix
with local people struggling to get by in Brazil's volatile economy
seemed a small sacrifice.</TE>
<TE>   I also had to travel cheaply, because I had given up my
journalist's job in London to make a seven-month journey from the top
to the bottom of South America. I planned to start in Venezuela,
cruise down the Amazon, then go south along the east coast to Tierra
del Fuego at the bottom of Argentina. Though I started alone, I did
not remain that way for long: Locals and other travelers were always
quick to invite me to share a coffee and swap stories.</TE>
<TE>   I arrived in Manaus, a city of 1.5 million that erupts from the
rain forest like a heap of glass and concrete, after a meandering,
three-week bus trip from Caracas, Venezuela.</TE>
<TE>   At the peak of the rubber boom a century ago, Manaus was the Paris
of Brazil, run by perhaps 100 magnates who forced the local Indians
to work their estates and filled the shops with English china, French
clothing and Belgian rugs.</TE>
<TE>   The restored opera house, or Teatro Amazonas, built in 1896,
stands as an aloof reminder of that lost grandeur amid chaotic fruit
juice stands, electronics stores and souvenir shops. The theater's
gold ceramic-tiled dome and pink-and-white pillared exterior enclose
sweeping Italian Renaissance balconies and a ceiling rosette painted
to mimic the view you would get standing beneath the Eiffel Tower and
looking up.</TE>
<TE>   Each morning at my hotel, the modest Pensao Sulista, I waded
through a breakfast of melon, bananas, bread and coffee. On a local
tour I met Nir, a 29-year-old university graduate, and discovered
that he too planned to take the 150-passenger riverboat that three
times a week carries cargo and people down the Amazon.</TE>
<TE>   Girding for the voyage</TE>
<TE>   The boat departed Friday, so Nir and I scrambled to buy hammocks,
fresh food and tickets. We could sleep in hammocks on the covered
deck or take a cabin for $30 more apiece. I peeked into one of the
cabins. It was cramped, with four bunks and no air-conditioning. We
chose the open air.</TE>
<TE>   By midafternoon the three decks of the Huckleberry Finn-style boat
were filled with bodies.</TE>
<TE>   At 6 p.m. the boat pulled out from the dock, blowing its horn like
a bus.</TE>
<TE>   By 6:20 p.m. it was dark, because Manaus is only three degrees
south of the equator. By 8 p.m. the hammocks were full.</TE>
<TE>   At 4 a.m. two roosters, in crates on the lower deck, were crying
murder.</TE>
<TE>   At 6 a.m. the breakfast gong rang, and we had coffee and buns
lathered in margarine. Boxed in by bodies on every side, I think I
got three hours of sleep.</TE>
<TE>   I awoke to see the Amazon Basin, the source of a fifth of the
world's fresh water and oxygen, as a vast breadth of brown water
lined with an unbroken canopy of leaves, veils of thick vines,
patches of coconut palms and the wood huts of the Indians who live on
the riverbanks.</TE>
<TE>   The Sao Francisco is a 145-foot steel-hulled cruiser that offers
the best and worst of life at its simplest. At times you could
believe you were on a luxury holiday. Dusk was such a time: sitting
in the stern on the top deck, looking down the dance floor to tables
of dominoes players and a bar serving Antarctica beer and Simon and
Garfunkel tunes, brain lulled by a warm wind and the gentle thump of
the motor, a red sun draining the evening sky, and the muddy river
curled in silver, with dark slices of rain forest sliding off the far
banks. People pay good money for such a life.</TE>
<TE>   But soon reality swings back: Only money buys privilege. It was
humbling to crouch under a 5-foot shower in the dubiously clean
closet that passed for a bathroom and to gaze at the chicken, manioc
root, beans and spaghetti at mealtimes, wondering whether this was
the beginning of the end for your stomach.</TE>
<TE>   On the first night, Amit Shaham, a 19-year-old Californian, caught
up in the music and the bright night sky, bounced onto the deck to
give a spontaneous samba lesson. Would she have done so on a luxury
cruise? Maybe. But would I have met the English-soccer fan and maitre
d' of the boat, Armando, who lectured me in Portuguese on life after
divorce? Or the naked kids, faces as wild as monkeys'? Or the spry
old woman who faked near-death one moment to beg for money, then
shouted down a man twice her size the next? For that matter, would I
have made four instant friends when there proved to be only six
foreigners among the 150 Brazilian passengers?</TE>
<TE>   Not likely. It was a privilege to be among these delightful
people, with their crazy music and bashful friendliness, on this tin
pot in the Amazon. Everyone had time. Everything was warm, slow,
gently inspiring.</TE>
<TE>   We passed the hours playing cards, reading, talking, probably
saying more than we should have in the intimacy of this floating
village. Beer was popular, gossip even more so.</TE>
<TE>   Meals were times to socialize, with the men sitting at one long
table and the women at another. We dined in the cramped space between
the hammocks and the kitchen. The food, alternately beef or chicken
stew, was served on platters that came through a small window from
the kitchen. The food wasn't bad, if you tried not to imagine the
conditions on the other side of that magic hole.</TE>
<TE>   The captain was rarely seen. He sat in the forward cabin, behind a
large steering wheel, while his crew lolled below deck, seemingly
indifferent to the noxious smell and noise of the engine.</TE>
<TE>   The four women I met -- American, Canadian, Israeli and Japanese,
all in their 20s -- were there as charity workers. They hoped to
convince a handful of Brazil's 12 million abandoned children to give
up glue sniffing and go to a local farm where they would be cared
for. Already, two boat kids had come up to us asking for "cola,
cola." A Coke? I wish. Cola is Portuguese for "glue."</TE>
<TE>   By Day 2, Amit was ill. For two nights she lay sweating on the
cool deck, while we worried. By Day 3, Chiharu, the Japanese
sociology student, was missing her camera. It had been nipped in the
night from a bundle beneath her hammock, only inches from the nose of
Amit. My own backpack was locked and chained to a post.</TE>
<TE>   Theft is one of the hazards of traveling on the cheap. Though I
never worried for my safety among all these families and young
couples, I knew my possessions could disappear the moment I turned my
back.</TE>
<TE>   The boat stopped briefly in the riverside town of Santarem, two
days down the Amazon from Manaus. In the 1920s, Henry Ford built an
"American" town near here to harvest rubber for tires. The bubble
burst when Malaysia won leadership in the rubber trade and synthetics
replaced rubber. Today the town is neglected.</TE>
<TE>   As the boat unloaded goods, we strolled into Santarem, stopping
for mangoes and coffee. The narrow streets were quiet. The only
activity was the sleepy nodding of shopkeepers selling pottery made
by the Tupaiu Indians and a swell of song from a church filled with
parishioners dressed in Sunday best. We had only two hours and
quickly walked back.</TE>
<TE>   Arriving in Belem</TE>
<TE>   A day later we turned into the Amazon Delta. For more than an
hour, shallow canoes, many paddled by a mother and child, glided
toward the Sao Francisco from the nearby shores. Some sold shrimp.
Some had nothing. Sympathetic passengers threw plastic bags of food
to them.</TE>
<TE>   As we arrived at the Belem dock, weary but excited, my five
friends and I looked at one another. All around us, people rushed to
meet our fellow passengers. Unlike Manaus, Belem has maintained much
of the grandeur it attained when it served variously as an export
center for sugar, beef, cotton, rubber, jute, Brazil nuts and black
pepper after it was founded in 1616.</TE>
<TE>   In the Ver-o-Peso market we poked among stalls selling live
rabbits; bags of oranges; black, yellow and red sausages; drinks made
from fruits I've never heard of; and charms of the African-derived
Umbanda religion. Ugly vultures sat amiably on posts at the nearby
fishing harbor. Across the water, the terraced houses were a candy
shelf of pastel blue, pink and green.</TE>
<TE>   Here too the heat was oppressive. My guidebook said it rains like
clockwork every afternoon. Not for us it didn't.</TE>
<TE>   We walked for hours along the mango tree-lined streets, stopping
at the neoclassical Teatro da Paz, the Baroque Merces Church and the
Palacio Antonio Lemos art museum. In the latter, the two-toned
striped wood floor, marble staircase, engraved furniture and vast
rooms left no question about where the wealth of this country went.</TE>
<TE>   Outside of Belem's grand buildings, however, you cannot escape the
flip side of this civilization of extremes. We saw a man begging on a
busy sidewalk. He had no legs, no forearms. Someone dropped a coin.
No one looked him in the eye.</TE>
<TE>   The journey down the Amazon River took a little more than three
days. Rarely have I, in so short a time, been immersed in such a mix
of humility and peace. Looking back now, I can say without doubt that
the Danes were wrong about the banana boat.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>By late November, the Caribbean's hurricane season is generally
regarded as over. Nonetheless, tourist traffic to the tropics usually
slumps from Thanksgiving until mid-December. That is when you can
expect reduced rates from Caribbean airlines and packagers and also
when you can bargain yourself into a lower-priced room by phoning the
resort and requesting a discount.</LD>
<LD>   Cancun: From Dec. 1 to 22, you can snare the party-hearty resort
area of Cancun on Mexico's Yucatan Peninsula for $636, flying from
Los Angeles and staying for six nights at the Imperial Laguna Cancun.
Those rates are at least $200 less than you would pay at nearly any
other time of year. Call (877) 471-3876 or see www.e-vacations.com.</LD>
<LD>   Barbados: This English-speaking crown colony is usually among the
pricier Caribbean destinations. But from Thanksgiving through Dec.
14, Atlas Vacations, (800) 634-1057, www.atlasvacations.net,
transforms Barbados into a rock-bottom treat. For $833 per person,
fly from LAX to a seven-night stay at the Golden Sands Hotel, the
Allamanda Hotel or the Dover Beach Hotel on the shores of the
island's southern coast, within walking distance of shopping and
night life.</LD>
<TE>   Jamaica: Another Atlas Vacations trip features low rates to the
home of reggae from Thanksgiving until Dec. 16. For $610 from Los
Angeles, Atlas flies you round trip on US Airways or Air Jamaica to
this island for seven nights, including breakfasts. You can stay at
the Crane Ridge or Columbus Heights; both are condos in Ocho Rios.
Both have pools, and they are a five-minute walk from downtown, with
shuttle service to a private beach. Contact (800) 634-1057,
www.atlasvacations.net.</TE>
<TE>   Turks and Caicos Islands: The Turks and Caicos, a crown colony of
Britain, are a new Caribbean hot spot that's quietly growing in
popularity, thanks in part to Caradonna Caribbean Tours, (800)
328-2288, www.caradonna.com. The company has specials from late
November until Dec. 14 at Comfort Suites. The charge for air fare
from LAX and seven nights' accommodation is $999.</TE>
<TE>   Belize: From mid-November until Dec. 10, Belize specialist
Capricorn Leisure, (800) 426-6544, www.capricorn.net, has trips to
two of the nation's cayes (narrow offshore islands) for sunning,
swimming and snorkeling. The first stop is Caye Caulker for three
nights at the Anchorage Hotel, and then it's on to Ambergris Caye for
four nights at the Sunbreeze Hotel. Including round-trip
transportation on American Airlines, the price is $894 from Los
Angeles or San Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   Guatemala: From mid-November until Dec. 15, you can visit this
culturally rich Central American country for $799, flying out of LAX.
The price increases over the Christmas holiday, then falls back to
$799 from Jan. 11 to March 31.</TE>
<TE>   You'll spend three nights at the Biltmore Hotel in Guatemala City,
then one night at the Villa Grande Hotel in the highland arts and
market center of Chichicastenango. Additional nights are $39 in
Guatemala City, $59 in Chichicastenango. Sunnyland Tours, (800)
783-7839 or www.sunnylandtours.com.</TE>

<KH>Destination: Florida</KH>
<HD>Unlocking the charm of Gulf's Cedar Key</HD>
<DH>Vast, wild marshlands and an island of indolence prove to
be fine nesting grounds for waterfowl and artists -- and tourists who
appreciate both.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Michal Strutin</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL>Cedar Key, Fla.</DL>
<LD>"We came to Cedar Key from Tampa with an Audubon tour," said Connie
Crane, an artist staffing the counter at the Cedar Keyhole gallery
cooperative. "I saw a cat lying in the middle of the street nursing
her kittens, and I said, 'Oh, that's the kind of town I want to live
in.' " And now she does.</LD>
<LD>   The former New Yorker is one of the painters, potters and
photographers who have made this Florida city something of an
artists' colony. A growing number of tourists has found it too, drawn
by the quaint, off-the-clock town and the nearby national wildlife
refuges and vast salt marshes teeming with fish and fowl.</LD>
<LD>   Cedar Key is not the sort of place you stumble on. It's an island
in the Gulf of Mexico, 20 miles from the nearest major highway and
about 60 miles from the nearest airport, in Gainesville. It lies at
the southern end of the Big Bend, where the state's panhandle makes a
long arc down to the Florida peninsula.</LD>
<TE>   In a state bursting with tourism, the Big Bend is one of the least
visited areas, known for timber and cattle, not theme parks and golf
resorts. But those who do venture here are rewarded with a taste of
old Florida: Sinuous, watery channels part low marsh grasses
undulating in the sea breeze, giving the landscape the look of a
sensual jigsaw puzzle.</TE>
<TE>   I've visited many times, most recently this summer when I fled
with my friend Nancy Fischman from what had become a too-frantic
summer at home in Tennessee. We had visions of palms and a
lemon-yellow wash of sunlight on a turquoise sea, of pelicans sitting
on piers and roseate spoonbills sifting through the shallows of a
marsh.</TE>
<TE>   As we approached Cedar Key on Route 24, the world slowed down. We
passed a jumble of palms, bays, live oaks and red maples. Soon we
could smell salt air. The forest ended, and a low bridge came into
view, one of several connecting a cluster of islands to the mainland.</TE>
<TE>   Pullouts here offer some of the best bird-watching in Cedar Key --
or anywhere in Florida. From both sides of the bridge, salt marshes
stretch to the horizon. The shallow waters are a natural fish nursery
and seafood supermarket, as rich in life as any habitat on Earth. At
low tide, wading birds pluck fish, frogs and small crabs from the
mud. Low tide also reveals the oyster bars that lie between land and
water.</TE>
<TE>   The first time I visited Cedar Key, in the mid-'90s, I was working
on a nature book and decided to take my mother along for part of the
journey. We reached the easternmost bridge, called the Fourth Bridge,
and were compelled to stop when we saw herons, egrets, black skimmers
and orange-billed oystercatchers. We explored Cedar Key for the day
and were so taken with its waterfront and quaint historic center that
I promised myself a return trip.</TE>
<TE>   A couple of years later, while working on a book about Florida
state parks, I stopped with my husband at Cedar Key's Island Hotel &amp;
Restaurant, built in 1859 and on the National Register of Historic
Places. Our room's time-polished wood floors and four-poster bed
swathed with mosquito netting put me in mind of a Humphrey Bogart
movie, perhaps "Key Largo." The broad upper balcony fitted with
rockers, the rattan-furnished lounge and the pale pink-and-white
dining room cooled by ceiling fans all felt languid and tropical.</TE>
<TE>   Back when the hotel was built, Cedar Key reigned as the premier
port town on Florida's west coast. Ranchers and plantation owners
shipped timber, beef, cotton and sugar cane down the nearby Suwannee
River. After a railroad connected Cedar Key to the Atlantic Coast in
1861, the goods went out all along the Eastern seaboard.</TE>
<TE>   Through the early 1890s, Cedar Key was chief supplier of pencil
blanks for Eberhard Faber -- until the cedar ran out and a hurricane
hit in 1896. The factories, on neighboring Atsena Otie Island,
shipped pencils across the shallow channel to what is now Dock
Street. Back then, Atsena Otie ("Cedar Key" in the language of Creek
Indians) was where the town of Cedar Key and its industries lay.
After the hurricane decimated everything on the island, the town
moved to its present location. These days Atsena Otie is part of the
Cedar Keys National Wildlife Refuge. You can boat out to the island,
lie on the beach, bird-watch and hike.</TE>
<TE>   Nancy and I stopped at Dock Street and its collection of seaworthy
buildings. Built over water, the street is anchored by a broad pier
where people cast for sea trout, redfish and flounder, and where
tourists eat ice cream and watch pelicans. It's the place to be
Saturday night. Live music pulsed from Frog's Landing the evening we
arrived.</TE>
<TE>   We had booked a room at Harbour Master Suites, next door to
Frog's, and worried that the music would keep us awake. But Harbour
Master's rooms are a couple of stories above the street and turned
out to be quite private.</TE>
<TE>   The best part was the balcony, which looked directly down into the
Gulf of Mexico and out toward Atsena Otie. We could see the pier to
our right, pelicans sitting smugly atop pilings and a great blue
heron waiting for an angler to throw a fishy snack. We sat briefly to
enjoy our view of dolphins breaching and royal terns on the wing.</TE>
<TE>   After unpacking, we set off for a drink at the Island Room
Restaurant at Cedar Cove, a great place at sunset because of its
expansive view of the water. We were feeling so relaxed in the airy
bar that we decided to stay for dinner. (The Island Room and the
Island Hotel are the two top restaurants in town.)</TE>
<TE>   I had a smoked chicken ravioli appetizer and a main dish of
grouper piccata. Nancy had littleneck clams in a white wine sauce
with fettuccine. The food was fine, but the wild mushroom soup was
outstanding: smoky, earthy and thick. I would have been satisfied
with a huge bowl and the restaurant's crusty rolls.</TE>
<TE>   Wowed by the roost</TE>
<TE>   The next day we were ready for the sea, so we caught a tour aboard
the Lady Pirate. Our boat mates were a fellow from St. Petersburg and
a couple looking for a good beach on which to be married. Nancy and I
intended to take the tour, then be dropped off at Atsena Otie for a
few hours on the beach.</TE>
<TE>   Our captain took us to Seahorse Key, where the University of
Florida has marine labs and, more important, where hundreds of birds
mate and nest. As he edged toward shore, we saw dozens of magnificent
frigate birds, "littering the trees as if they were common crows,"
the captain noted. The birds are large and black, with deeply forked
tails and enormous red neck pouches on breeding males. We barely
noticed the immature bald eagle, ibises, cormorants and others
crowded on the island.</TE>
<TE>   Nancy and I were foolishly willing to brave summer mosquitoes to
lounge on the beach at Atsena Otie Island, but a summer squall
loomed. After a quick stop to admire the beach, sea oats and palms,
we beat the rain back to Cedar Key and spent the rest of the day
browsing galleries.</TE>
<TE>   Cedar Key's artist-colony ambience is neither as bohemian as
Silver Lake nor as upscale as Carmel but somewhere comfortably in
between. Avoiding souvenir shops reeking of incense, we headed to two
galleries on Dock Street, where we admired glassware and copper lamps
at Sawgrass and linen clothing and jewelry at Suwannee Triangle.</TE>
<TE>   Second Street, the town's main street, is the best place to browse
and examine historic buildings. Cedar Keyhole and Island Arts carry a
mix of oil paintings, mixed media, pottery, garden art and basketry.
Natural Experience keeps odd hours but exhibits fine photography as
well as wood sculpture.</TE>
<TE>   Two museums can offer more background on the area. The Cedar Key
State Museum displays the most complete Florida shell collection I've
seen. The Historical Society Museum has artifacts dating from
prehistoric peoples who lived here 11,000 years ago. The John Muir
exhibit caught my eye. Yes, California's most famous early naturalist
was here too. In 1867, less than two years before he saw Yosemite,
Muir walked from Indianapolis to Cedar Key, where he recovered from
typhoid fever. He wrote "A Thousand-Mile Walk to the Gulf" about that
adventure and his time at Cedar Key.</TE>
<TE>   That night we dined at the Island Hotel: soft-shell crab glazed
with sherry, rich crab bisque and succulent fish en papillote,
aromatic with East Indian spices. The hotel's hearts-of-palm salad
lived up to its reputation as a novelty: crunchy hearts of palm and
fresh fruit atop greens with a scoop of frozen dressing that combines
vanilla ice cream, lime sherbet, mayonnaise and peanut butter. The
dressing sounds weird but tasted so good we asked for the recipe.</TE>
<TE>   The next day we went by Manatee Springs State Park. In winter, the
park is one of the most reliable places in Florida to see manatees,
the aquatic mammals that can grow to more than 3,000 pounds. Visitors
can swim the crystalline spring waters, hike and bike along trails,
check out the cedar swamp boardwalk and canoe into the Suwannee River
-- as long as they keep a respectful distance from the gentle,
endangered manatees.</TE>
<TE>   Nancy and I stopped at the Lower Suwannee National Wildlife
Refuge, whose headquarters lie on Route 347 about seven miles from
Cedar Key. The refuge's nine-mile wildlife drive took us past
pinelands and swamp but not much wildlife. Perhaps our timing was
off.</TE>
<TE>   Near dusk, we went to the Fourth Bridge to loll and watch birds.
We saw great white egrets, little blue herons and a clutch of
red-billed white ibises. A roseate spoonbill, dipping for dinner,
swished its bill through the shallow water. Then it stopped, lifted
its pink wings and flew into the gathering blue-gray night.</TE>

<HD>Panama Canal trip squeezes in a variety of tropical ports</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>Harry Basch</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>At one time a Panama Canal cruise was thought to be a
once-in-a-lifetime experience. But since the Sept. 11 attacks many
travelers with time and money have chosen to avoid planes and travel
coast to coast by ship. More repeat passengers are taking the cruise
not just for the canal experience but also for the variety of
Caribbean, Central American and Mexican ports of call.</LD>
<LD>   Lines are offering stops at a number of ports, including Aruba;
St. Lucia; St. Martin; St. John and St. Thomas of the U.S. Virgin
Islands; Jamaica; San Juan, Puerto Rico; the San Blas Islands of
Panama; Puntarenas, Costa Rica; San Juan del Sur in Nicaragua; Puerto
Quetzal in Guatemala; and Cozumel, Santa Cruz Huatulco, Acapulco,
Zihuatanejo, Puerto Vallarta and Cabo San Lucas in Mexico.</LD>
<LD>   But the highlight of the voyage is still the six to eight hours
spent squeezing into lock chambers barely wider than the ship and
navigating by stair-step locks from sea level up 85 feet and then
back to sea level. The spectacle draws passengers on deck throughout
the day.</LD>
<TE>   The canal cut runs 50 miles across the isthmus between the
Atlantic and Pacific oceans, passing, east to west, through Gatun
Locks, the man-made Gatun Lake, the steep Galliard Cut excavated
through eight miles of rock and shale, and the Pedro Miguel and
Miraflores locks.</TE>
<TE>   Nine major cruise lines have Panama Canal sailings from October to
May.</TE>
<TE>   Celebrity Cruises ([800] CELEBRITY [235-3274],

<HD>Angelic oasis, cool walks in the Valley's Devils Canyon</HD>
<DH>Near the Ventura County line is a little swatch of cowboy
country with creeks.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>John McKinney</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Much of the San Fernando Valley's west side has long been developed,
but I still like one place that remains wild: a heavenly place named
Devils Canyon.</LD>
<LD>   This canyon and neighboring Browns Canyon, which holds a primary
tributary of the Los Angeles River, had been exceptions to the steady
march of land development, at least until recently. Browns Canyon is
undergoing extensive grading to prepare for new housing.</LD>
<LD>   But Devils Canyon remains a favorite of equestrians and hikers.
This is the cowboy side of the valley. Cattle graze on private
property in the upper canyon and sometimes wander down to public land
in the lower canyon.</LD>
<TE>   So peaceful is this place -- cool and green, unlike the hot, dry
rim of the San Fernando Valley -- that Devils Canyon seems a
misnomer. The seasonal Devils Canyon Creek flows through the
oak-shaded landscape, a welcoming oasis particularly after winter
rains.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this month, I was surprised to find a couple of creek
crossings with enough water to require careful stepping.</TE>
<TE>   To reach the trail head, take the Ronald Reagan Freeway (Highway
118) to the Topanga Canyon Boulevard exit. Park in the little dirt
lot just north of the freeway or alongside the frontage road.</TE>
<TE>   Begin hiking on the unsigned paved road nearby. It leads 100 yards
up to a flat area rimmed with houses. Skirt them by staying right.</TE>
<TE>   Then pass an abandoned car and an unsigned footpath on the left
that loops toward a housing development.</TE>
<TE>   The main trail dips under the shadow of condominiums lining the
west wall of the canyon. As it bends left, signs of development
recede, trees shade the road and the route narrows to a footpath
paralleling and occasionally crossing the seasonal creek. (All along
the route, watch out for poison oak.)</TE>
<TE>   The canyon bottom is lovely, shaded by oaks, alder and sycamore.
The trail narrows more as it heads up the creek. After more than a
mile, just short of where Ybarra Canyon joins Devils Canyon, the path
delivers hikers to a shady flat, ideal for a picnic.</TE>
<TE>   The trail ends a mile farther at a gate, beyond which lies private
property.</TE>

<KH>TAKING THE KIDS</KH>
<HD>Even the hardheaded need ski helmets</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Eileen Ogintz</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Let's face it: There are lots of battles vacationing parents won't
win, and we don't want to spend precious time together arguing with
the kids. But when their safety is the issue, we can't give in.</LD>
<LD>   Take the fight that starts in my house every year around this time
and continues all winter. I urge 18-year-old Matt, an expert skier,
to wear a ski helmet. He refuses, insisting he doesn't need one.</LD>
<LD>   I wasn't ready to draw the proverbial line in the snow until I
talked to Denver neurosurgeon Stewart Levy. Now I am. Matt: No
helmet, no lift ticket.</LD>
<TE>   "The bottom line is that helmets can reduce the risk of brain
injury as much as 75%," says Levy, who has researched the subject for
the last seven years. "If you get a brain injury with a helmet, it
won't be as severe."</TE>
<TE>   Levy's findings prompted him to start It Ain't Brain Surgery, a
program at the two St. Anthony hospitals in Denver that makes helmets
available to skiers and boarders when they rent skis across Colorado.</TE>
<TE>   Fatalities are rare on the slopes; the odds are less than one in a
million, the National Ski Areas Assn. reports. Far fewer children are
badly injured skiing and snowboarding than riding bikes.</TE>
<TE>   But that's no comfort if it's your child and the injury could have
been prevented or lessened.</TE>
<TE>   That became clear last winter when 5-year-old Leonie Arguetty of
Palm Beach, Fla., was killed after hitting a tree during a ski school
class at Aspen Highlands in Colorado. She wasn't wearing a helmet,
and her parents are now suing the ski resort. A month later at the
same mountain, another child suffered a head injury, but he was
wearing a helmet and quickly recovered.</TE>
<TE>   "We've had children in our database who have skied into trees,
metal poles, etc., while wearing helmets, and none of them had a head
injury more severe than a concussion," says Lori McBride, a pediatric
neurosurgeon at Children's Hospital of Denver and Levy's research
associate. "It doesn't take long to become a believer."</TE>
<TE>   Colorado resorts are leading the charge for helmets. Aspen Ski
Resorts, www.aspensnowmass.com, has announced that this season, kids
12 and younger must wear helmets in ski school. So has Crested Butte
Mountain Resort, www.cbmr.com. Vail Resorts (which include Vail,
Beaver Creek, Breckenridge, Keystone and Heavenly; visit
www.vailresorts.com) will require kids 14 and younger to wear helmets
in ski school, though parents can sign a waiver if they don't wish to
comply.</TE>
<TE>   The National Ski Areas Assn., the National Ski Patrol,
Professional Ski Instructors of America, the American Assn. of
Snowboard Instructors and the National Safety Council, among others,
are on the helmet bandwagon with a new Web site, www.lidsonkids.org,
meant to promote helmet use and overall safety on the slopes.</TE>
<TE>   Young skiers and boarders account for more than one-third of all
the folks hitting the slopes every year -- more than 4 million kids
younger than 18, according to the National Sporting Goods Assn.</TE>
<TE>   Just as significant, more parents are taking their kids with them
when they ski.</TE>
<TE>   "I get very upset when I see a parent without a helmet skiing with
a child who's got one on," says Levy, who warns that the older you
are, the harder it is to recover from a brain injury.</TE>
<TE>   The experts say that if kids see the skiers and boarders they
admire wearing helmets, they are less likely to resist wearing them.</TE>
<TE>   More than 620,000 helmets were sold in 2001, a 40% increase from
1999, according to the Colorado-based Leisure Trends Group. Many
kids' helmets retail for less than $100.</TE>
<TE>   "You wouldn't play football or hockey without a helmet," Levy
says. "You can talk all you want about skier safety, but you can't
prevent all accidents."</TE>

<LD>Amanda Jones' interaction with moose in Jackson Hole, Wyo., was
disturbing ("Fall in Cowboy Country, Sept. 22). Moose are dangerous,
as she pointed out belatedly.</LD>
<LD>   In my travels I've seen people approach warthogs in Africa,
buffalo in Yellowstone, bears in Alaska. The tourists' lack of
knowledge is appalling -- and dangerous. It's amazing that more
people aren't killed, although plenty, including children, are
injured.</LD>
<LD>   Please take time to read and learn about wildlife before
traveling. People can perish for lack of knowledge.</LD>

<LD>Our mouths watered with delicious memories rekindled by Jerry Haines'
article, "Studying the Food Chain in Chiang Mai" (Oct. 6). We fondly
remember -- and still taste -- all those wonderful combinations of
flavors, textures and aromas that filled our minds and stomachs when
we walked the streets of Chiang Mai.</LD>
<LD>   What an eye-opener to find out that one can take a cooking class.
It's back-to-school time for us retired teachers.</LD>

<TE>   As I read Haines' article my mind was filled with the sights and
smells of Thailand. Thirty years ago I lived in the fishing village
of Sattahip. Pushcarts, smoking woks and enticing spices are
ingrained in my memory, especially the barbecued chicken with sweet
red chili marinade.</TE>
<TE>   For all the wonderful foods and aromas and magnificent temples,
the main attraction is the Thai people. Even the wild tuk-tuk drivers
have a constant smile and courtesy. When you are lost, they will go
out of their way to help you.</TE>
<TE>   Reading Haines' lovely piece made me ache to return to Thailand to
see its friendly people and beautiful temples and to sample the
delicious foods.</TE>

<CP>PHOTO: We reeled in this "Best Shot" from Pacific Palisades
reader Sharon Henry. Her husband, Ted, took the photo Labor Day
weekend on a backpacking trip to Arrowhead Lake, a splash of water in
the Sierra south of Mammoth Lakes. Send it to the Travel editors,
Sharon said. Naw, Ted said humbly, they won't like it. But Sharon
did. And we were hooked. That's Ted's friend Chris Cole casting his
line in the lake. Ted favors Arrowhead Lake because it's quiet and
uncrowded, a part of the John Muir Wilderness that's far enough off
the popular Pacific Crest Trail to attract only a small number of
serious outdoors enthusiasts.</CP>

<HD>Island crime problems point to trouble in paradise</HD>
<DH>After a series of robberies, some cruise lines have pulled
their ships out of the Virgin Islands' St. Croix.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Susan Spano</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I like to think of myself as an adventurous traveler, willing to go
to wild places where I need to keep my guard up. But having to stay
alert to potential dangers is hard work, especially these days.
Sometimes all I want is an easy vacation -- like a cruise, which is
about the safest, most comfortable way I can think of to see some of
the most beautiful places on Earth.</LD>
<LD>   But some of those places aren't as paradisiacal as they look in
brochures. On a Caribbean cruise about 10 years ago, my ship visited
St. Thomas in the U.S. Virgin Islands. There, a cabdriver told me
about gang wars in the port town of Charlotte Amalie and warned me
about wandering on my own. I lived in New York City then and knew all
about watching my back. The idea that I had to worry about crime on
lovely St. Thomas made me groan, but I visited without incident.</LD>
<LD>   Caribbean islands are beguiling, so it's easy to forget that they
sometimes harbor trouble. Maybe that's why I was so surprised to
learn recently that three big ships have stopped visiting the U.S.
Virgin Island of St. Croix after nine passengers and crew members on
two ships, the Triumph and Destiny, both owned by Carnival Cruise
Lines, were robbed or mugged there in the last year.</LD>
<TE>   One of the incidents that caused Carnival, and later Holland
America, to pull out of St. Croix occurred Feb. 20, when a couple
from the Triumph was robbed at gunpoint on Sandy Point Beach, about
two miles south of the town of Frederiksted, where the bigger cruise
ships dock.</TE>
<TE>   The line contacted Virgin Islands authorities even before the
Triumph incident because of crimes against other Carnival passengers
and crew. By late April, Carnival removed St. Croix from the
itineraries of both of its ships that called there. Later, Holland
America, a cruise line also owned by Carnival, stopped sending the
Zuiderdam there. That leaves just one major cruise line, Celebrity
Cruises, that's calling at St. Croix.</TE>
<TE>   Celebrity spokesman Michael Sheehan said none of the line's
passengers had been affected by crime on St. Croix. The line
occasionally reminds passengers to be cautious in certain ports of
call but hasn't issued such cautions for St. Croix, he said. (De la
Cruz, the Carnival spokeswomen, said warnings about using caution in
some ports of call are left to the discretion of each ship's cruise
director.)</TE>
<TE>   But having to alert visitors to potential dangers in a port "is
counterproductive to the experience of having a good time," said
Holland America spokesman Erik Elvejord. "Passengers should feel
comfortable enough to enjoy a place, to wander and have a beer in a
local pub."</TE>
<TE>   Crime is not new to St. Croix. The little island, about 1,000
miles south of Miami, is one of the U.S. Virgin Islands, along with
St. Thomas and St. John.</TE>
<TE>   St. Croix's reputation was first significantly scarred in 1972,
when eight people, including four tourists, were slain during a
robbery on an island golf course, an incident that has come to be
known as the "Fountain Valley massacre." In some ways, the island
never quite recovered.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, there were 30 homicides (12 of those on St. Croix) in
the three-island U.S. territory, a per capita rate five times the
national average, according to the St. Thomas Source, an online
newspaper. (The U.S. Department of Justice said it has not received
crime figures from the U.S. Virgin Islands since 1995.) "We have
horrific problems down here," said Michael Bornn, a former tourism
commissioner. "But, thank God, they haven't touched a lot of
tourists."</TE>
<TE>   The U.S.V.I. Police Department did not respond to requests for
crime statistics, but Lt. Randolph DeSuza said that none of the
murder victims was a tourist; most were involved in local drug and
gang violence.</TE>
<TE>   Police Chief Novelle Francis added that recent crimes against
cruise ship passengers and crew were "mostly petty." He said that
apprehending criminals who prey on tourists is particularly difficult
because cruise visitors tend to report incidents to ship authorities
rather than police.</TE>
<TE>   The ship pullouts mean that St. Croix, already economically
depressed, will suffer even more. Celebrity's 1,950-passenger
Constellation will make 23 stops there from November to April 2003.
But ship visits during the winter cruising season in the Caribbean
will decline 37.8% from the previous year, leaving the island with an
estimated $40 million in lost tourist revenue, according to the St.
Croix Chamber of Commerce.</TE>
<TE>   St. Croix also is a less appealing stop than shopping mecca St.
Thomas, the busiest cruise ship port in the Caribbean.</TE>
<TE>   Since Carnival and Holland America left, surveillance cameras have
been installed in the dock areas, the number of tourist-oriented
police officers has been increased and a public awareness campaign
has been initiated to involve the community in keeping tourists safe,
said Police Chief Francis.</TE>
<TE>   I'm skeptical. But I wish St. Croix success in solving its
problems, for the sake of islanders and visitors. After all, the last
thing I want to do on a Caribbean cruise is watch my back.</TE>

<HD>When a Small Screen Was the Biggest Thing</HD>
<DH>The makers of 'The Big Time' happily uncovered the
similarities, and differences, between TV in 1948 and 2002.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Susan King</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>SET in a bustling Manhattan of 1948, the new TNT movie "The Big Time"
recreates the fly-by-the-seat-of-your-pants excitement and
experimentation of the early days of television. Both the Emmy
Award-winning writer and director of the drama, which premieres
Sunday on the cable network, admit they would have loved to have
worked in the medium back then.</LD>
<LD>   "What I discovered when I was doing my research is that many of
the same elements that are in television today were present from the
beginning," says writer and executive producer Carol Flint. "Like the
conflict between art and commerce and the social ills that America
still faces. It was surprising to find so much of it at the
beginning."</LD>
<LD>   But 1948 and 2002 aren't entirely similar, and Flint says she was
also intrigued by the differences. "It was so overtly optimistic and
gung-ho," she says. "It didn't mean that there wasn't racial tension
or the blacklist looming, but people were friendly and pitching in.
People were celebrating America's role in World War II, and they were
happy to be getting back to their lives. I feel the same elements are
there today in kind of a reverse order. Cynicism is so dominating."</LD>
<TE>   Director and co-executive producer Paris Barclay, who, like Flint,
has worked with "Big Time's" executive producer John Wells, always
had affection for early television, especially the live dramatic
series that presented abridged adaptations of classic theater. "When
I graduated from Harvard, one of my first jobs was working for the
Museum of Television &amp; Radio, and my project was 'Studio One.' I was
putting together all the research for 'Studio One.' They would do
live dramas, and I am watching these tapes and thinking this is
really wonderful. If you come from theater, which I do, it is such a
fantastic crossbreeding of television and theater. Before they knew
what television would ever be, they decided, let's put theater on
television."</TE>
<TE>   The late John Frankenheimer, who began his directing career in
live television, was a close friend of Barclay's. "I would have just
about done anything to have a career like his. He always talked about
how exciting it was. He said it was like flying a plane."</TE>
<TE>   Flint had a personal connection to "The Big Time" era. "I wasn't
born in 1948; I wasn't even conceived in 1948, but soon after that.
There was this personal curiosity about delving into that time period
right before I was born, when my parents were meeting, and really
trying to imagine what that time was like."</TE>
<TE>   Molly Ringwald, Christopher Lloyd, Dylan Baker, Christina
Hendricks and Sharif Atkins head the ensemble of "The Big Time,"
which is set in a struggling TV network that is owned and operated by
an eccentric millionaire inventor (Lloyd). Ringwald plays the
inventor's young bride, who realizes the potential in the fledgling
medium. Baker is the devoted producer and vice president of
programming for the network. Hendricks is the perky girl from the
Midwest who comes to New York and gets a job as the producer's
secretary, and Atkins plays a jazz musician who gets a gig for his
group, the Royal Flush, on the network.</TE>
<TE>   In one powerful sequence, Lloyd's character flies into a rage
after he sees the Royal Flush performing on television. Atkins' Joe
Royal had broken an unwritten law: At that time, no African American
could address the audience, and Royal sang directly to the camera.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't know African Americans could not speak directly to the
camera," says Barclay, who is African American. "I asked
Frankenheimer about that, and he said, absolutely. It wasn't like it
was ever spoken about, but it was understood."</TE>
<TE>   "The Big Time" can be seen Sunday at 8 and 10 p.m. on TNT. The
network has rated it TV-14 (may be unsuitable for children under 14).</TE>

<HD>Adams Should Be Evaluated</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The give and take of a political campaign should generate solid
information for voters who are struggling to find the truth, which
often gets lost in the blue smoke and mirrors. That's particularly
true in judicial elections, in which winners are handed the power to
determine the fate of those who appear in their courtrooms. And it's
of the utmost importance in the unusual race for Judicial Office No.
21.</LD>
<LD>   Voters had reason to hope that the race would calm down after the
incumbent, accused child molester Ronald Kline, took his name off the
ballot in order to focus on an upcoming trial for allegedly molesting
a teenager and downloading child pornography onto his computer.</LD>
<LD>   Former prosecutor Gay G. Sandoval and Dana Point attorney John
Adams deserve credit for stepping up and campaigning as write-in
candidates after it became clear that Kline no longer was a viable
candidate.</LD>
<TE>   Their appearance gave voters a welcome alternative to Kline, but
the campaign trail since the March primary has been unexpectedly
messy, with mud-slinging and attempts at obfuscating -- troubling
developments, because voters are struggling to learn more about two
relatively unknown write-in candidates seeking Kline's job on Nov. 5.</TE>
<TE>   A private investigator working for one of Adams' former business
associates has made public documents detailing Adams' past financial
and political woes, as well as a bitter divorce. Sandoval
subsequently sent letters to Adams supporters, urging them to study
court documents flowing from the divorce and several civil lawsuits
involving her opponent. Adams cried foul, arguing that he's done
nothing improper and that Sandoval has no business making an issue of
his private life.</TE>
<TE>   Both candidates have campaigned hard and sought dozens of
endorsements from city council members, mayors, judges, prosecutors
and others in the political arena. They have proved that the write-in
process works.</TE>
<TE>   But Adams did voters a disservice by refusing to sit for the
Orange County Bar Assn.'s candidate review. He argued that the bar
association review wouldn't produce a full appraisal of his legal
career.</TE>
<TE>   Judicial candidates rarely decline to take part in the review,
according to the president of the local bar. Most candidates complete
a detailed questionnaire, conduct an interview with committee members
and supply the names of judges and attorneys who can document their
legal achievements.</TE>
<TE>   It's not a perfect process, and some candidates question the
political maneuvering that goes on as the ratings are completed. But
most candidates welcome the opportunity to showcase their significant
contributions in the legal arena.</TE>
<TE>   Adams' refusal to submit to a peer review meant that the bar
association was unable to make an official evaluation of his
candidacy. Sandoval, who did take part, was rated as qualified to
serve as a judge.</TE>
<TE>   The bar association is just one measure of a candidate, but in an
unusual race that pits lesser-known candidates against each other,
it's a measure that Adams should have allowed.</TE>

<HD>El Morro Should Go Public</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The residents of the El Morro mobile home park aren't letting any
good deed by the state go unpunished.</LD>
<LD>   They've had the privilege of living for nearly two decades on
state-owned oceanfront land just north of Laguna Beach. Their rental
rates in the midst of pristine Crystal Cove State Park remain way
below market price. But for many years, the state has warned them it
planned to reclaim the property for park use.</LD>
<LD>   Most people figure the mobile-home residents had no permanent
claim on the land. But the 294 El Morro tenants aren't most people;
they're householders who don't want to lose an exquisite housing deal
courtesy of taxpayers.</LD>
<TE>   The state says they must move out when leases expire in two years.
The state Department of Parks and Recreation wants to replace the
asphalt-covered canyon with coastal habitat, picnic tables and 60
camping spots that would be open to the public.</TE>
<TE>   The El Morro tenants are trying to take a page from the history of
nearby Crystal Cove, where residents of 1920s beachfront cottages
fended off eviction for decades. They aim to keep their gated
community private by positioning themselves as environmentalists and
guardians of child safety and the public dollar. The environmental
report for returning the parkland to the public is inadequate, they
claim in a lawsuit filed against the state. Students at the nearby
elementary school would be in danger from those "itinerant" campers.
And the state would make more money collecting continued rent
payments than by building park facilities.</TE>
<TE>   This is self-serving rhetoric at best. The state is not in the
business of making money from its parks. It's in the business of
providing public services, and it hasn't provided any new campgrounds
to Southern Californians in 10 years.</TE>
<TE>   If El Morro residents were really worried about the California
budget, they would drop their lawsuit and save the state years of
expensive legal wrangling.</TE>
<TE>   The state's plan at El Morro would bring the land closer to its
natural state and open it to thousands more people. In addition, the
Laguna Coast Wilderness Park adjacent to Crystal Cove is opening to
the public; the El Morro parcel provides a crucial trail link from
inland to ocean that is now fenced off from the public.</TE>
<TE>   The Sierra Club is openly offering its support to the state on El
Morro. So is a long list of local environmental groups and activists.
These watchdogs do not see the problems in the state's environmental
report that the mobile-home residents allege in their lawsuit.</TE>
<TE>   El Morro residents, it's been fun, but that's not your land. It's
time to start packing.</TE>

<HD>Churches as Neighbors</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It would be a shame if houses of worship gained a reputation as
undesirable neighbors. Unfortunately, that's the way it's been headed
in some corners of Orange County.</LD>
<LD>   At one time, churches were busy only once a week for services.
Now, as they expand their range to include social clubs, youth groups
and continuing education, the traffic flows all days, at nearly all
times. Several neighborhoods have fought off church proposals to
install cell phone towers in their steeples.</LD>
<LD>   Homeowners in an expensive new section of Newport Beach are
fighting plans for a Mormon temple, complaining about the towering
steeple and dramatic evening lighting. Unfortunately, church
officials initially fed local opposition by asserting that the
temple's design had been decreed by God, as interpreted by a church
prophet, and was nonnegotiable. Then, on a more conciliatory note,
they offered to lower the steeple from 124 feet to 100 and changed
the design to California Mission style.</LD>
<TE>   But this offer gained them only mistrust, as residents took it as
evidence that church designs are indeed changeable. Neighbors also
worry about the bright lights meant to bathe the steeple in a
heavenly glow until 10 each evening, a natural concern for any parent
who has to get the kids to bed by 8:30.</TE>
<TE>   The land where the temple would be built is zoned for houses of
worship, so home buyers should have been forewarned. But a Mormon
temple isn't your ordinary neighborhood church. It is meant almost by
definition to be an imposing and visually dominant building that
evokes heaven-inspired awe in viewers.</TE>
<TE>   The Mormon temple in San Diego is such a building, both
eye-catching and ethereal. It also rises alongside a freeway in an
office district, where it fits within its landscape and few are
around at night to be bothered by lights.</TE>
<TE>   None of this helps the unhappy situation in Newport Beach, where
the temple would be far smaller than San Diego's. Even though the
church has made significant design concessions, down to changing the
color from the usual gleaming white to more of an earth tone,
neighbors are still spitting mad and ready to fight.</TE>
<TE>   Heaven only knows whether it would have made a difference had the
church worked with neighbors from the start instead of saying its
concerns are bigger than theirs.</TE>
<TE>   Religious organizations are guaranteed great latitude in building
designs as part of their freedom of religion. That doesn't mean
neighbors, especially the affluent and power-familiar residents of
Newport Beach, can't make life difficult in City Hall and in the
courts. It's worthwhile for religious leaders and householders to
remember humbly that a little voluntary neighborliness goes a long
way.</TE>

<HD>Arguments in Favor of, Against Proposition 51</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Re " 'Great' Reason to Pass on 51," Editorial, Oct. 13:</LD>
<LD>   A "yes" vote on Proposition 51 will make Orange County a better
place. Proposition 51 will provide local governments with money to
fix dangerous roads, improve bus transportation and replace old and
unsafe school buses without raising taxes. But, beyond this,
Proposition 51 allocates $10 million in state funds per year to help
the county create one of the nation's finest metropolitan parks.</LD>
<LD>   Another good reason to vote for Proposition 51 is that it
allocates $50 million for the Fly Away program -- a transportation
program that will enable Orange County air travelers to use the
Irvine Transportation Center to buy their tickets, check their
luggage and board an express bus to airports outside the county,
including Los Angeles International, Ontario International and Long
Beach airports. This is a popular centerpiece of Irvine's strategy to
meet future air travel demand without building a dangerous, noisy,
polluting and unwanted airport at El Toro.</LD>
<TE>   It is no secret that the California Legislature is dominated by a
powerful Los Angeles delegation that is hostile to Orange County,
particularly on the issue of an El Toro airport.</TE>
<TE>   The most recent evidence of this hostility was the passage of AB
2333, which was designed to punish Orange County voters for opposing
an El Toro airport by depriving us of tens of millions of dollars of
regional state transportation funds. A veto by the governor was
required to stop this ridiculous law from taking effect.</TE>
<TE>   Orange County is a "donor county." Every year we send millions of
dollars to Sacramento that are redirected to Los Angeles and Bay Area
counties. This disparity of dollars is particularly evident in the
distribution of funds for transportation and parks. Proposition 51
will help us begin to get our fair share of state funds.</TE>
<TE>   We certainly can't expect Los Angeles politicians to allow any
state money to be used to enhance the Great Park or establish a Fly
Away program -- not when these same politicians are still working to
dump LAX air traffic onto Orange County by building an airport at El
Toro.</TE>
<TE>   Proposition 51 gives Orange County voters the power to get back
our fair share of the millions of dollars we have donated to Los
Angeles, San Francisco and Sacramento -- and it will help us create
one of America's greatest parks for the enjoyment of every Orange
County resident. Those are great reasons to vote "yes."</TE>
<TE>   Larry Agran</TE>
<TE>   Mayor of Irvine</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Re "Irvine's Great Park Plan Carries Equal Price," Oct. 8:</TE>
<TE>   Isn't everything done by the state paid for by taxes? Once taxes
are paid the money is then distributed to various projects and
programs. The attack on Irvine by The Times is just that: an attack.</TE>
<TE>   The tax issue was raised by the pro-airport side when it said that
local taxes would be needed to build the park. This was a lie then
and a lie now. If you were to ask them, an airport could have been
built without any additional taxes. San Francisco, Los Angeles and
San Diego all have parks for their citizens. Orange County should
also be able to provide its residents a place to get away from the
urban sprawl. With what we kick into the state coffers every year, we
will just be getting what is due us.</TE>

<TE>   As for the air terminal, why would anyone object to a convenient
service that would check our bags, transport us to the gate of our
chosen airport and save us from the inconvenience and headache of
driving, lugging bags, etc.?</TE>

its fair share of our taxpayer dollars.</TE>

<TE>   I am furious since reading that Irvine and its mayor, Larry Agran,
are slipping a few plums for themselves into Proposition 51. First,
the citizens of California are being asked to pay $110 million to
enhance Irvine with the Great Park that was used as bait to encourage
their South County cohorts to kill the perfectly located, sorely
needed airport at El Toro. Then, to rub salt into the airport wound,
Irvine is boldly requesting $50 million for a "remote" airport
terminal, so that the traveling multitudes from South County can
check luggage and board a shuttle van to John Wayne, where they will
cheerfully fly over the heads of the hapless Newport Beach folk.</TE>
<TE>   Let's get a proposition that does not shower state millions on one
city.</TE>

<TE>   I only hope the state denies any funds for this park and uses the
money to boost medical help for people on fixed incomes and reopen
the medical facilities in the state that have been closed because of
lack of funds. Let's get real and help people who need help, like
people on kidney dialysis that most health insurance companies no
longer cover. They could use this money.</TE>

<LD>Re "Angel Fans Few but Fearless in N.Y.," Oct. 2:</LD>
<LD>   Too bad the same can't be said for Yankee fans in Anaheim.</LD>
<LD>   During the regular-season matchups between the Yankees and Angels,
the crowd is split, but we share a respect for the new rivalry.
Taunts and jeers are readily accepted and given in good nature. But
the crowd of Angel fans that crawled out from under a rock for the
Oct. 6 game were not fans of baseball and far from Angels. They
mobbed and nearly assaulted two Yankee fans who sat in their car
humiliated enough by their team's loss waiting to leave the parking
lot. The police and security that patrol the pregame festivities were
of little help after the game.</LD>
<TE>   Hoorah for the Halos; they were the better team. But the fans have
a long way to go before they're champions.</TE>

<LD>Re "Ballot Measures Give Voters a Say Over Development, Taxes,
Schools," Oct. 9:</LD>
<LD>   You mentioned Measure I, which would help build a new police
headquarters in Buena Park, but you failed to mention Measure H, an
important school bond for the Centralia School District. If passed,
it could result in up to $31 million with district contributions and
state matching funds, which would be used to modernize schools and
classrooms; upgrade communications, fire alarm, and security systems;
improve handicapped access; repair and replace roofing, plumbing and
electrical systems; install air-conditioning; and provide access to
computers and modern technology.</LD>
<LD>   The average school in Centralia School District is more than 35
years old. Many are in dire need of these upgrades. It will be up to
voters in Buena Park, La Palma and Anaheim to decide on this crucial
bond issue Nov. 5.</LD>

<LD>   Writer Bob Ipema of San Clemente suggests that "since Bill Simon
can't win the election race he ought to be asked to step down and
perhaps have anyone who can beat Gray Davis run instead." Mr. Ipema,
we did have just that person -- Richard Riordan. However, the
ultraconservative wing of the Republican Party hijacked the
nomination and now we will be cursed with four more years of Davis.
As a moderate Republican seriously thinking of becoming an
Independent, I can truly say that I didn't leave the Republican
Party; the party left me.</LD>

<LD>Re "O.C. Judge Race Takes 2nd Ugly Turn," Oct. 15:</LD>
<LD>   Given the high volume of white-collar crime cases that winds
through O.C. courts, a judicial candidate's background is extremely
relevant. The last thing the bench needs is a judge who may have
indulged in financial chicanery.</LD>
<LD>   If the facts as stated are true, Patrick and Jeannette McDaniel as
well as John Adams' own parents were victims of Adams' pecuniary
misbehavior and moral bankruptcy. Our judiciary system does not need
a fox watching the henhouse.</LD>

<LD>Re "Infrastructure Graded, Warnings Sounded," Oct. 11:</LD>
<LD>   So an organization that is in the business of advising those who
would contract to repair infrastructure discovers that Orange County
needs repair. And their case studies for the schools are one high
school and one district out of 28 districts in the county. And the
"research" done on these two was based on a visit to reports posted
on their Web sites.</LD>
<LD>   Both the Huntington Beach Union High School District and Foothill
High School in Santa Ana have spent several years describing
themselves in the worst possible terms in order to get voters to
support them in bond elections -- to repair the schools.</LD>
<TE>   Surprise, those descriptions are horrific.</TE>
<TE>   The real news here is that no one has gone to the trouble to
investigate those districts that have not held bond elections. Are
there districts where deferred maintenance is not the rule and where
buildings are maintained and repaired in a timely fashion? Are there
districts where you cannot take photos of crumbling ceilings, broken
plumbing, rotted floors and termite-infested walls?</TE>

<LD>Re "Crowded Future Challenges Imaginations of Planners," Oct. 11:</LD>
<LD>   Evan Halper's article on USC's Reality Check on Growth conference
provided a good overview of the challenges facing Southern
California's continued growth.</LD>
<LD>   At the conference, I stressed that we must balance the need for
new housing with the need to protect our remaining ecologically
sensitive lands, our clean air and water, and our quality of life now
and for our children.</LD>
<TE>   I am working to achieve a solution for the remaining 23,000 acres
of Rancho Mission Viejo in south Orange County. What I am trying to
achieve is a plan that will enable the landowners to build houses
where it makes sense as well as carry on their historic ranching,
while preserving globally significant natural treasures that support
rare wildlife such as the mountain lion, golden eagle and steelhead
trout.</TE>
<TE>   This balanced planning must be based on sound scientific data from
state and federal resource agencies in the form of a Natural
Community Conservation Plan. This process, initiated by former Gov.
Pete Wilson, is designed to achieve conservation while directing
development to less sensitive areas. Balanced planning must also be
based on community input. We are fortunate that this opportunity is
being provided by Supervisor Tom Wilson's precedent-setting South
County Outreach and Review Effort. We have a unique opportunity with
the planning of Rancho Mission Viejo to create a model. We must do
the right thing for the land and for the children who will live here
tomorrow.</TE>

<TE>   The members of our organization -- the Heart and Soul Coalition --
are very concerned about the impacts of unplanned and irresponsible
growth on our natural treasures, and clean air and clean water. We
expect growth to continue, but we want to make sure it's properly
managed, makes sense and doesn't destroy the quality of life we would
be proud to pass on to future generations. For the 23,000-acre Rancho
Mission Viejo development, we are supporting efforts that would
enable the landowners to build where it makes the most sense yet
preserve the most environmentally sensitive lands.</TE>

<LD>Re "Bilingual Education Gets an F (for Farce) Grade," Letters, Oct.
13:</LD>
<LD>   Mary Margaret Silva claims that bilingual education has produced
"mostly all negative results." The scientific research says
otherwise. Nearly every scholar who has reviewed the published
research has concluded that bilingual education works. Children in
bilingual programs acquire at least as much English as children in
all-English immersion programs and usually acquire more.</LD>
<LD>   The most recent review of this research, by Jay Greene of the
Manhattan Institute, found that use of the native language has
positive effects and that "efforts to eliminate the use of the native
language in instruction ... harm children by denying them access to
beneficial approaches."</LD>
<TE>   Those who profit from bilingual education are not its advocates,
as Silva claims, but the children in the programs. They acquire
English and develop their first language at no extra cost.</TE>

<LD>I received my San Clemente Nuclear Emergency Information Packet in
the mail today.</LD>
<LD>   Evacuation directions ... gulp.</LD>
<LD>   My first impulse ... read and discard.</LD>
<TE>   A nuclear disaster here? Naw ... then I reflect on Sept. 11, and
Zap! -- onto the fridge door it goes. Now every time I go for the
mayo I reflect on my own personal nuclear winter. My home is my
office, strategically located 4.5 miles due north of San Onofre
Nuclear Generating Station, or SONGS, the sweetest-sounding acronym
for "Nobody Gets Out Alive."</TE>
<TE>   Here's my question: Three candidates for San Clemente City Council
wholeheartedly endorse plowing the 241 toll road extension through
the city's virgin back country to make way for massive urban sprawl.
Do we really want to back 35,000 more people into our San Onofre
emergency zone?</TE>

<LD>Re "Ignore Walkout, UCI Chief Advises," Oct. 12:</LD>
<LD>   I am behind the lecturers 100%. They are crucial to the learning
environment at UCI, but they are treated as if they are disposable. I
do not understand why they have to reapply for their jobs every year,
even every quarter. I have heard stories about excellent lecturers
leading class for the fall quarter but suddenly disappearing the next
quarter, and sometimes they never return.</LD>
<LD>   Not only does this directly affect the lecturers, but it also
directly influences the students when they have actually built a
strong relationship with one of the lecturers. When the lecturers
disappear, the relationship dies, and they can kiss that
recommendation-letter-ticket to graduate school goodbye.</LD>

<LD>Re "Farmland Likely to Become Upscale Santa Ana Houses," Oct. 6:</LD>
<LD>   When one of the last undisturbed parcels of local farmland is
allocated for the bulldozer, you can be sure that the quest for 30
more pieces of silver is involved. But since the clan members
involved already have incredible 401(k)s, why not leave something to
the county that would perpetuate their name in a beloved rather than
mercenary light and preserve a portion of Orange County history as
well?</LD>
<LD>   Rather than becoming yet another gated megaplex, the acreage could
be turned into a children's farm experience, similar to the Dana
Point shipboard program for school kids. At Segerstrom Farm, second-
and third- graders could plant garden crops and learn about farm
animals. Fourth- and fifth-graders could learn how to make adobe and
pottery and learn other curriculum-appropriate lessons. A museum in
the existing clapboard church would inform visitors about the area's
progress from prime hunting territory to bucolic farmland to real
estate profit, and ... oops. Well, scratch that. Bring on the
bulldozers.</LD>

<HD>County Campaign Laws Need Update</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Shirley Grindle</AU>
<BD>Shirley Grindle is a longtime community activist.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Measure A has been placed on the Nov. 5 ballot to update the county's
campaign-reform ordinance. The ordinance has been in effect since
1978, when a broad-based citizens group known as Tin Cup qualified
the first campaign ordinance for the ballot. An updated version of
Tin Cup was approved by voters in 1992, and the resulting campaign
ordinance has governed all elections for county office for the last
10 years.</LD>
<LD>   The 1992 ordinance needs to be updated to comply with recent court
decisions and to tighten up reporting and disclosure requirements.</LD>
<LD>   For these reasons, I asked the Board of Supervisors to place
Measure A on the ballot for voter approval.</LD>
<TE>   In the 10 years since county voters revised the campaign
ordinance, several disturbing events have occurred that demand
changes to the ordinance. The most glaring and opportunistic of these
events occurred in the recent campaign for the 4th District
supervisor, in which more than a dozen slate mailers were devoted
largely to supporting a single candidate.</TE>
<TE>   A legitimate slate mailer lists many candidates who are
recommended to the voters by the organization producing the slate
mailer. The slate mailers in question, however, contained 3 1/2
full-color pages devoted to only one candidate.</TE>
<TE>   Normally the candidate would have paid for and produced his own
literature, but in this case, the slate mailer organization produced
the campaign literature.</TE>
<TE>   Because contributions to a slate mailer organization are not
regulated by the existing ordinance, the candidate was able to get
around the county's $1,000 contribution limit, and this candidate
received contributions in excess of $600,000 to produce and
distribute his campaign literature cloaked as a slate mailer.</TE>
<TE>   This was clearly an orchestrated deception, deliberately aimed at
circumventing the spirit and intent of the campaign ordinance.</TE>
<TE>   The Board of Supervisors closed this loophole in July when it
passed an ordinance regulating slate mailers. That language is
included in Measure A.</TE>
<TE>   Another change included in Measure A is that husband-and-wife
contributions will no longer be aggregated. This has long been a
controversial issue particularly for those spouses who have separate
incomes.</TE>
<TE>   But it should be remembered that husband-and-wife contributions
were aggregated at the request of many couples that are part of the
"captive audience" -- the small-business owners who contributed
$1,000 (the current limit) and then received a phone call from the
candidate or his representative reminding them that their spouse
could give another $1,000.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, it is fairly apparent that the courts view the
aggregation of husband-and-wife contributions as unconstitutional and
discriminatory to married couples. For that reason, this change is
reluctantly included in Measure A, and we can only rely on the moral
integrity of county candidates and elected officials not to abuse
this provision.</TE>
<TE>   Measure A includes a number of improvements concerning the
reporting and disclosure of contributions and expenditures. A
contributor would be required to disclose to the candidate any other
contributions made at his direction by a business or other entity
that he or she owns or controls.</TE>
<TE>   As it is now, only the candidate is responsible for determining
which contributions are aggregated, and this has proved to be
extremely burdensome and requires a level of detective work that is
outside the purview of most candidates.</TE>
<TE>   By requiring the owner of a company to disclose his ownership if
he makes contributions both personally and through his company, the
burden of full disclosure will be placed on both the candidate and
the contributor.</TE>
<TE>   Another reporting requirement that should assist candidates in the
last hectic weeks before election day is that any individual or
committee that makes a late independent expenditure for or against a
county candidate will be required to notify all candidates running
for that office within 24 hours.</TE>
<TE>   Independent expenditures are generally made in the last few days
before an election when there is not sufficient time to respond to
whatever erroneous information is printed or otherwise distributed.
This 24-hour notice is an attempt to provide early notice to
candidates so that they may respond to last-minute attacks and to
discourage the use of "hit mail" just before an election.</TE>
<TE>   The media and other watchdogs of county campaigns will appreciate
a new provision requiring the filing of a post-election campaign
statement that discloses contributions and expenditures made during
the 16 days before an election and the 10 days after it.</TE>
<TE>   This is particularly beneficial for elections held in March
because campaign-disclosure reports under existing law are not due
until the July 31 after a March election. The public is kept in the
dark too long as to the campaign activities just before and after an
election, which is often the period of most interest. Measure A
corrects this omission by requiring the filing of a campaign
disclosure report 15 days after the election.</TE>
<TE>   In summary, Measure A:</TE>
<TE>   * Updates the current campaign-reform ordinance so that it
reflects recent court decisions.</TE>
<TE>   * Tightens up the reporting and disclosure requirements for
candidates running for county office, for certain contributors, and
for those making independent expenditures in county elections.</TE>
<TE>   * Retains the contribution limit of $1,000 per election and
prohibits the Board of Supervisors from raising this limit without
approval of the voters.</TE>

<HD>Modern County's Glimpses of Farmland Bring It Back to Earth</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Nick Spain</AU>
<BD>Santa Ana resident Nick Spain has been an archeologist
in Southern California for 30 years.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There are precious few places left in Orange County where one can
find land under cultivation. Witness the occasional strawberry field
hemmed in by the cement-slab walls of industry, choked off by
ever-expanding residential development, or strategically situated
along a high-tension power line corridor. This is all that remains of
a once-thriving agricultural economy that was fueled by large tracts
of citrus, avocados, walnuts and endless acres of beans and tomatoes.</LD>
<LD>   Much of the county was blessed with light, sandy, easily
cultivated soil that proved ideal for farming. In parts of Santa Ana,
Costa Mesa, Fountain Valley and Huntington Beach, however,
large-scale draining of sloughs, marshes and swamps was necessary to
open up additional cropland. Once drained, this land became some of
the best vegetable-producing acreage in the country.</LD>
<LD>   Walking through my grandfather's bean fields as a child while
growing up in Santa Ana in the 1950s, I got to see the last years of
Orange County's agricultural empire. Through his eyes and those of my
two uncles, I was able to experience their journey, which started at
the end of World War I and ended in the 1970s, when, after nearly 50
years of farming an Irvine Ranch lease, Uncle Ernie retired.</LD>
<TE>   During my childhood, Orange County was home to a mix of suburban
residential and rural agricultural land use. Extensive housing
tracts, industrial parks and mega-malls had yet to surface on the
Southern California landscape.</TE>
<TE>   During the 1960s and 1970s, real estate developers, industrialists
and corporate retailers and bankers flooded the region, pumping
capital into a sea of development projects. This phenomenon
transformed the county's economic base within a decade's time from
one that was heavily agricultural to one that was largely commercial
and industrial.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, farmers were hit hard. Those who wanted to continue
farming were forced to move, as most of my family did. Others sold
out and, if they were lucky, entered the county's growing nouveau
riche class.</TE>
<TE>   Those who chose to move their farming operations for the most part
gravitated to the state's major agricultural centers: principally the
San Joaquin and Imperial valleys and, to some extent, western
Riverside County.</TE>
<TE>   Some 30 to 40 years later, those meccas of agri-business are
experiencing the same pressures Orange County did earlier. This is
especially true in the San Joaquin Valley, where population growth
and increased commercial and industrial demands are pricing land out
of agricultural use. The long-term implications of such a trend are
disturbing.</TE>
<TE>   One must remember that no matter how technologically sophisticated
we may think we are, we are still an agriculturally based society. As
such, there are two fundamental and irreducible requirements to feed
our large, urban-centered populations: adequate land of sufficient
quality, and water of sufficient quality and quantity. History tells
us when either land or water are squandered in a non-sustainable
fashion, the carrying capacity of the food resource base will drop,
followed by a commensurate reduction in the human population.</TE>
<TE>   In the most severe cases, the very integrity of a society can be
threatened. The object lesson is that we simply cannot continue to do
in other parts of the state what we did in Orange County.
Furthermore, we should do what we can to retain our remaining farms.</TE>
<TE>   Today, a five-acre plot sits a mile from the Santa Ana Civic
Center. This is where Jimmy Otsuka's father started a vegetable farm
in 1947. Fifty-five years later, that piece of Orange County farm
history is one of our few remaining family-run, roadside farm
businesses. An atavistic reminder of days gone by, the Otsuka stand
is more than mere nostalgia.</TE>
<TE>   It is a striking reminder of our inexorable tie to the land, a
bond for which there is no substitute.</TE>
<TE>   To eliminate all vestiges of this link would deny Orange County
not only its past -- its very origins -- but also its future.</TE>
<TE>   Historical perspective is a valuable commodity in an expanding
society. It provides a soundboard for assessing possibilities and
selecting among alternative courses of action.</TE>
<TE>   The Otsuka farm, and others like it, help provide this perspective
by giving the community a glimpse into its past, a clear view of its
present and a vision for its future.</TE>
<TE>   These small farming operations reflect the important reality of
our agricultural dependence, and thereby serve as urban classrooms --
living museums of a sort -- that incorporate history, science,
technology and economics within a framework of continuity.</TE>
<TE>   This continuity symbolizes a contract between generations, between
communities and their neighborhoods, and between people and the land
they live on.</TE>
<TE>   One can only hope municipalities, school districts and other
government institutions will see the wisdom in protecting and
promoting these important historical islands in our urban midst.</TE>

<LD>Cheers for Arthur on Halloween</LD>
<LD>   "Arthur's Halloween"</LD>
<LD>   By Marc Brown</LD>
<TE>   The characters are Arthur, D.W., Mom, Dad, Mr. Marco, Francine and
Mrs. Tibble. The setting is home, class and Mrs. Tibble's house.</TE>
<TE>   First, Arthur's family is decorating for Halloween. Then they go
trick-or-treating, and Buster tells them where not to go--to the
witch's house. Finally they all go to the cemetery.</TE>
<TE>   I learned from this book that kids can help older people. I felt
happy because of what Arthur does--he helps Mrs. Tibble.</TE>

<LD>GRANDPA Bob lay in a hammock.</LD>
<LD>   Jack and Janey played in the sand next to him.</LD>
<LD>   Grandpa Bob asked, "Have I ever told you about the Hawaiian Shoe
Bird?"</LD>
<TE>   "What's a Hawaiian Shoe Bird?" Jack asked.</TE>
<TE>   "It's called a shoe bird because it likes people's shoes," Grandpa
Bob explained.</TE>
<TE>   "What does this bird look like?" Janey asked.</TE>
<TE>   "It has a beak 2 feet long that's shaped like a shoehorn," Grandpa
told her.</TE>
<TE>   "Wow! I've never seen a bird like that anywhere!" Jack said.</TE>
<TE>   "That's because every time someone sees one, they say, 'Shoo!
Shoo!' And the bird flies away," Grandpa Bob said, smiling.</TE>
<TE>   "Where do they live?" Janey asked.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes they live in the trees. They use old shoes to make
nests. Then they call it a Shoe Tree," Grandpa Bob said.</TE>
<TE>   "How do you know so much about shoe birds?" Janey asked.</TE>
<TE>   "Because they took my shoes once. See?" Grandpa Bob wiggled his
bare toes. "One time these birds built a Shoe Mountain. Shoe birds
came from all the islands to help. They piled up red shoes, blue
shoes, white and brown shoes, running shoes, beach shoes, tennis
shoes. It was wonderful. Big kids climbed up the outside. Small
children crawled under like a shoe cave. But then the parents came by
and saw it. They screamed, 'What are my shoes doing here?' They
grabbed their shoes right and left until the Shoe Mountain collapsed.
The shoe birds flew down to fix the Shoe Mountain. But the people
shouted, 'Shoo! Shoo!' Most of the birds never came back. So that's
why you rarely see them anymore."</TE>
<TE>   "Grandpa Bob, is this all true?" Jack asked.</TE>
<TE>   "It's as true as the Hawaiian Snorkel Bird," he said. "But that's
another story." Grandpa Bob lay back in the hammock again. "Give me a
little push, will you please?"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Nancy Robison says, "If you are ever missing your shoes, look
around for the Hawaiian Shoe Bird." This story will be on The Times'

<HD>Huggins Will Prowl Court His Own Way</HD>
<DH>Heart attack suffered in September by the Cincinnati
Bearcat basketball coach shouldn't change his style on the sideline.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mike DeCourcy</AU>
<BD>Sporting News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Nearly half of his first practice passed before Bob Huggins' voice
first echoed off the walls of the Shoemaker Center. He merely was
shouting out basic instructions, not shouting down a bewildered
freshman, but it was a reminder he will coach the Cincinnati Bearcats
the same as always.</LD>
<LD>   A prototypical Huggins harangue would have been inappropriate on
this Saturday morning, the first official day for NCAA basketball
practice, because this was a happy occasion. It began with a few
thousand Cincinnati fans gathering in the Shoe for the antithesis of
Midnight Madness -- a morning affair the school arranged in
mid-September and labeled "Breakfast with Bob."</LD>
<LD>   Only Bob almost didn't make it.</LD>
<TE>   "If it's your time to go, it's your time to go," Huggins says.
"God decided it wasn't my time."</TE>
<TE>   As heart attacks go, Huggins was uncommonly lucky to have been
stricken when he was, where he was, the morning of Sept. 28. If it
had happened earlier, he would have been alone in his hotel room. If
he had been at an airport designed differently than Pittsburgh
International, he might have been in the middle of a 10-minute ride
in a car rental bus. An hour later, he would have been in an airplane
and removed from the medical attention that probably saved his life.</TE>
<TE>   If it had happened a week later, though, Huggins probably would
have found a way to be back in his trademark black sweatsuit when
practice began. "It would have been a whole lot more strain on me
sitting at home, wondering what's going on," he says.</TE>
<TE>   If you are expecting a different Huggins, if you are hoping for
that, you will be disappointed. He will be as manic as his team
requires and his body allows. Huggins rarely has been one to dash
about the floor in practice. He prefers to stand majestically near
midcourt and issue his bellowing rebukes for all to hear. Huggins is
more theatrical during games, but he rages in short bursts, and his
doctors have not suggested a change. "Their goal is to get me back to
as close to normal as I can be," he says.</TE>
<TE>   Huggins hadn't screamed at a ref for more than six months when he
had his heart attack. Rather, he had traveled extensively, slept
nominally and eschewed exercise. He had gained weight in recent
years. Despite an ominous family history -- his father had a heart
attack before age 40 -- Huggins ignored what he considers, in
retrospect, to be small warnings.</TE>
<TE>   "I should have done a better job of staying in shape," Huggins
says. "There are signs, if you look for them. I probably didn't look
for them."</TE>
<TE>   Huggins didn't work himself into this circumstance. But he did
allow his work to lead him here. When he talks now about his
thrice-daily workouts, he says he "never had the time" before. The
simple truth: He never made the time.</TE>
<TE>   Huggins' friends do not worry about him remaining vigilant in this
area. But they wonder if he'll excuse himself from the late
gatherings he enjoys with fellow coaches and former players, when the
collected cigar smoke and the hilarious stories leave everyone near
tears.</TE>
<TE>   Charlie Coles, the coach at Miami (Ohio), went into cardiac arrest
during a conference tournament game in February 1998, but he still is
coaching five seasons later. He does not hold himself back from
shrieking at players in practice. He says the most important thing he
learned about staying healthy is the importance of getting proper
rest.</TE>
<TE>   Huggins joked as he began to introduce his 2002-03 team that
"Breakfast with Bob" obviously wasn't his idea: "I'm a late-night
guy."</TE>
<TE>   But if Huggins wants to be the same coach, some things will need
to change.</TE>

<HD>Runnin' Smack With T-Mac</HD>
<DH>Orlando's McGrady is proud that he's one of the NBA's
leading trash-talkers, and the forward can back it up.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Sean Deveney</AU>
<BD>Sporting News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There's a sense of relief by the time you pull up to the winged "1"
that sits square in the middle of the gate outside Tracy McGrady's
deluxe Orlando, Fla., home, complete with a basketball court in the
front yard and jet skis emblazoned with Orlando Magic logos in the
lake out back.</LD>
<LD>   McGrady has been bobbing and weaving through traffic in his plush
white Bentley -- his "cruising car," he says -- and you can't help
but worry that you will lose him among the cars on Interstate Highway
4. But then you remember that there probably aren't that many
Bentleys mixed into central Florida traffic. And when you watch
McGrady pull the Bentley into his garage, where a slumbering silver
Ferarri sits, well, you realize things could have been worse.</LD>
<LD>   "You kept up," McGrady says in mock surprise. He smiles. "I
thought I might lose you out there."</LD>
<TE>   Hmm. If you're not mistaken, McGrady is talking a little smack to
you and your rental car. It's a Chevy Malibu, so there is no
effective rebuttal. When McGrady sees you're wearing jeans on a
90-degree September day in Orlando, he can't help but say, "You must
be enjoying this weather. I would not even call this hot. It could be
a lot hotter." Wait, did he just trash-talk the sun?</TE>
<TE>   This is Tracy McGrady, NBA superstar and proud talker of trash.
McGrady simply likes talking. He would just as readily trash-talk
your lame set of wheels while standing in his driveway as he would
trash-talk some lame effort to guard him on the court. McGrady
trash-talks during games, in the locker room and in the media. You
get the feeling that on garbage collection day, he waits by the curb
to trash-talk the trash collectors. "Hey, I don't mind mixing it up
with anyone who wants to," McGrady says. "As long as they take it the
right way. I'm not out to hurt anyone's feelings."</TE>
<TE>   There's the rub for McGrady: Folks don't take it the right way,
and he winds up portrayed as a self-centered blowhard. As McGrady
sees it, there has been a decline in the rivalry-building ragging
that fueled NBA showdowns during his childhood. There still is plenty
of junk being jawed in the NBA, but many players are restrained by
the threat of technicals, fines and public opinion. McGrady finds
this lamentable and aims to change it.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know when people got so sensitive," McGrady says.
"Muhammad Ali would never be able to talk the way he did today. If I
say I am one of the top five players in the league, people say, 'Why
did he say that? Why is he talking about himself?' It does not matter
if it's true."</TE>
<TE>   Just 5 1/2 months ago, as the Magic's season was ending thanks to
a first-round playoffs loss to the Hornets, McGrady took a public
flogging for stating that he was the best player in the series. He
said that if Hornet star Baron Davis put up better numbers, it was
because he had better players around him. McGrady's point about truth
in trash-talk seems valid -- among the floggings, few stopped to ask
whether what McGrady said was true. Few considered that there isn't a
general manager in his right mind who would swap McGrady for Davis.
Few asked whether the well-stocked Hornets really were better off
than the Magic, who have not been able to surround McGrady with much
talent, thanks to Grant Hill's recurring foot injury.</TE>
<TE>   McGrady just shrugs. "Clearly, he had a lot more depth than we
did," he says. "That's what I was dealt. I was not putting down my
teammates. I love my teammates. It was just reality. Look at what
Baron Davis has on his team. He's got guys who can rebound, who can
score and who play defense like (crazy). People said I was
disrespecting my team. That's not it."</TE>
<TE>   That sort of criticism, McGrady says, does not bother him. He is
not going to clip his lips simply because some people don't like what
he has to say. He thinks he could average a triple-double someday.
Ask him who he'd pick first if he were building a team from scratch,
and he won't hesitate: "Me." Who does the best job of guarding him?
"Ain't no one," he says. "No one who can do it every night."</TE>
<TE>   McGrady is 23, still two years away from his prime by his
reckoning, and probably the NBA's most gifted player. Certainly, no
player will be called upon to carry a bigger load for his team, and
if you're forecasting the MVP race, that makes McGrady the top
candidate. He followed a breakthrough year in 2000-01 (26.8 points,
7.5 rebounds and 4.6 assists), with a big '01-02 (24.8 points, 7.9
rebounds and 5.3 assists). He can score from the perimeter and the
post, frequently defends the opponent's top player, passes like a
point guard and rebounds like a power forward. Shouldn't he be given
some trash-talking latitude?</TE>
<TE>   "With his skills," says Buck guard Sam Cassell, "Tracy has the
right to talk all he wants. He can back it up."</TE>
<TE>   Cassell would know, because it was against the Bucks in the
opening round of the 2001 postseason that McGrady first began carving
out his identity. He still smiles when recalling that series, in
which he averaged 33.8 points, 8.3 assists and 6.5 rebounds in a
four-game defeat.</TE>
<TE>   What stood out even more than McGrady's play was the force of his
personality. He talked trash like Oscar the Grouch, barking in the
ear of Glenn "Big Dog" Robinson -- "You're gonna be locked down all
night" was among the few lines he used that are suitable for print.
Indeed, McGrady held Robinson to 14.6 points per game, 7.4 below his
average. He labeled Robinson "the Big Puppy."</TE>
<TE>   "That," McGrady says, "was fun as hell. Brings a smile to my face
just thinking about it."</TE>
<TE>   That's all McGrady says he wants to do -- bring a little fun to
the game, especially in the playoffs. The Bucks and the Magic had a
simmering rivalry, with an ongoing feud between coaches George Karl
and Doc Rivers adding intrigue. Why not give the rivalry a little
boost by adding a McGrady-Robinson subplot?</TE>
<TE>   "There should be more of that," McGrady says. "In the playoffs,
it's a different game. I am going to be in your ear. You want to talk
smack to people and see if they bring their A-game. You want to do
some talking because it forces you to bring out your own A-game.</TE>
<TE>   "Look back to when Michael Jordan played Magic (Johnson) or Jordan
faced the Pistons, or Celtics-Lakers. You think Magic was just quiet
out there? Larry Bird would be out there telling people what he was
going to do, then he'd do it. You think the Pistons weren't talking
... to Jordan? They hated each other. That was fun to watch. Those
were the series that people could not miss.</TE>
<TE>   "You are sitting there watching, wondering what is going to happen
next -- a fight, maybe, or somebody making a big shot to shut
somebody else up. You read quotes in the paper and say, 'Can you
believe he said that about this guy?' People are a lot more willing
to watch those kinds of games. Then they want to watch the next game
to see what happens next, what the next chapter in the story is.</TE>
<TE>   "That's what I try to bring back. Talking trash, having two teams
that hate each other, having a rivalry. What's wrong with two teams
hating each other? I just wanted to start something up. I just wish
other teams and players did more of that."</TE>
<TE>   McGrady says it is not really decorum and civility that keeps many
players from getting into free-flowing talking battles. Rather, it is
the fear of embarrassment, the fear of landing on television in an
unfavorable light.</TE>
<TE>   "There is really not that much trash-talking in the league,"
McGrady says. "I think a lot of guys are scared to talk noise because
you're putting yourself on the line when you do. A lot of guys don't
want to get into it, because they know you will bust their butts, and
there is nothing they can do about it. Then you're gonna hear it from
the fans, from the press, but worst of all, you're gonna hear it from
me."</TE>
<TE>   McGrady is sitting, resting his elbows against the gray marble of
his kitchen table, contemplating used-up defenders from his past in
the way that Willie Nelson and Julio Iglesias recall all the girls
they've loved before. For a 6-foot-8 player with McGrady's level of
skill, versatility and swagger, what often gets lost is how smart a
player he is. A defender might give him trouble on a particular
night, but a bit of film study and a consultation with coaches
usually provide a remedy.</TE>
<TE>   Last season, McGrady struggled in a game against the Raptors
because of the way hefty 6-9 forward Jerome Williams was guarding him
-- Williams was tight on him, putting his arm in McGrady's back as
soon as McGrady got the ball, and setting his feet soon thereafter.
Usually against someone Williams' size, McGrady penetrates and blows
by him, but Williams was getting position too quickly.</TE>
<TE>   "Next time, I did not let him get his feet set," McGrady says. "As
soon as I got the ball, I acted, I moved. That's the kind of thing
you have to do."</TE>
<TE>   In the playoffs, against the Hornets, McGrady was having a tough
time with 6-1 guard David Wesley. McGrady had a serious size
advantage, so he was trying to post up Wesley and shoot over him. But
in the first game of the series, Wesley was giving McGrady slight
bumps as he went up for shots, and it caused McGrady to misfire -- he
was 8-for-21 from the field in that game.</TE>
<TE>   "Second game, after I watched the film, I faced him up," McGrady
says. "It was over from there."</TE>
<TE>   As McGrady has sharpened his tongue, he also has sharpened his
mental approach to the game. He can rattle off the way defenders play
him with ease and knows the best way to attack.</TE>
<TE>   "You never want to do the same thing twice with him," says Bull
forward Jalen Rose. "He will figure you out pretty quickly, and he
has the tools to expose you if he does."</TE>
<TE>   Still, the one tool McGrady says he must work on is leadership.
McGrady accepts responsibility for the two early postseason exits in
his two years in Orlando. The series two seasons ago against the
Bucks was fun, but the first-round loss to the Hornets last spring
stung. "Depressing," he says. "I failed." McGrady moped for much of
the summer, doing rehab to help his back, which he admits is not 100
percent. He traveled, mostly to get out of Orlando -- zipping off to
Los Angeles, Hawaii and Cancun, keeping his mind off basketball.</TE>
<TE>   "You can tell he is a guy who plays with hunger," says new Hornet
guard Courtney Alexander. "He is not a good loser. This guy works his
tail off, and he does not care about his stats. He's been around long
enough now to know that does not matter. He's hungry to win, and I
think if he keeps that, it could be scary in a couple of years."</TE>
<TE>   After spending one postseason as a trash-talking, first-round
novelty with impressive numbers, McGrady believed he should have
carried the Magic further in the playoffs last year. Indeed, the
Magic had a lead in the fourth quarter in three of the games against
the Hornets, including Game 1, when the Hornets closed out the game
thanks to a steal in the waning seconds by Davis, who slapped the
ball from McGrady's hands.</TE>
<TE>   "That's the next step for him," says one Eastern Conference scout.
"He has got to carry the team into the second round and forget about
them not having a frontcourt, forget about whether Grant Hill is
healthy. This is a huge year for Tracy McGrady. He can win games by
himself. The Magic should get to the second round, no matter what,
because of him."</TE>
<TE>   If he does, you better believe he is going to get there with his
tongue wagging.</TE>
<TE>   "We're going further this year," McGrady says. "And when we do, I
am going to have a whole new set of talk ready to go."</TE>
<TE>   And, just to get in one last bit of ribbing, McGrady smiles and
adds, "Bring your tape recorder."</TE>

<HD>Cheap Skates of the NHL</HD>
<DH>Rule changes help shine light on less-heralded and
inexpensive rookies, including three in Anaheim.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Paul Grant</AU>
<BD>Sporting News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Show me a team that did poorly last season, and I'll show you a team
that is giving a lot of ice time to unproven rookies this season.</LD>
<LD>   The young season has been noteworthy for the play of young
players. Big-name rookies Jay Bouwmeester and Rick Nash have been
stealing the spotlight with Florida and Columbus, living up to
expectations on teams that did not last season. But the play of
other, less-heralded rookies has drawn the bright light elsewhere.</LD>
<LD>   Take the Mighty Ducks' trio of wingers Stanislav Chistov and
Alexei Smirnov and defenseman Kurt Sauer. Chistov, 19, is 5-foot-10
and 195 pounds, one of the early benefactors of the obstruction
crackdown. Fearless in driving to the net, Chistov, the fifth overall
pick in the 2001 draft by the Ducks, has good speed and was touted as
the most skilled player in his draft. He had four points in his first
NHL game.</LD>
<TE>   Smirnov, 20, is 6-4, 218, and just like his alcohol namesake, is
big and bold and could make a lasting impression if you're not
careful. The Ducks' 2000 first-round pick, 12th overall, Smirnov also
goes hard to the net.</TE>
<TE>   Duck Coach Mike Babcock, a rookie himself, at times put the two
Russians on the same line, throwing his young Ducks to the wolves
alongside sophomore center Andy McDonald, 25. Although they didn't
play together for the entire game, they had 10 of the Ducks' 12
points in a season-opening, 4-3 victory over the Blues.</TE>
<TE>   Chistov played a significant amount on the power play -- which was
dreadful last season -- in the first few games of the season. It's
unrealistic to say this young unit will hold it together all year,
but the possibility of having a third line that can play like a
second one certainly takes pressure off Duck duos Paul Kariya and
Adam Oates, and Petr Sykora and Steve Rucchin.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think there's any question that the people who are front
and center in Canadian junior hockey get more attention because
they're better known," Duck General Manager Bryan Murray says, "but
both (Chistov and Smirnov) are real talented kids."</TE>
<TE>   Murray likens Chistov to a young Oates.</TE>
<TE>   "(He's) intelligent, quick, spins off checks ... he makes plays,
sees the ice extremely well, has real good hands," Murray says.
Murray predicts Chistov will produce more points than Smirnov but
added the latter will be good for at least 20 goals at his peak.</TE>
<TE>   "We're all anxious to see what they can do," Oates says. "We'll
see how they respond. They obviously have a lot of skill. You see
that in practice every day. How long it takes them to adjust to the
NHL game will be the test."</TE>
<TE>   And we can't forget about Sauer, 21. He's 6-3, 219, has played a
lot -- in his first NHL game, Sauer had the most ice time of any Duck
-- and looks like a solid addition to their blue line.</TE>
<TE>   Why the influx of youth in the league? The obstruction crackdown
has forced teams to look for cheap thrills. If the crackdown holds,
the young players will stick, and there are a few other rookies
you'll be hearing from:</TE>
<TE>   * Pierre-Marc Bouchard, C, Wild. Small and skilled, Bouchard led
the team in preseason points with eight in seven games.</TE>
<TE>   * Fedor Fedorov, LW, Canucks. The cocky and talented younger
brother of Sergei led his team in preseason goal scoring.</TE>
<TE>   * Alexander Frolov, LW, Kings. He scored a highlight-reel goal
against Patrick Roy in the preseason and could be a thriller.</TE>
<TE>   * Ron Hainsey, D, Canadiens. The Habs finally have the
puck-moving, rugged defense they've always wanted.</TE>
<TE>   * Ales Hemsky, RW, Oilers. General Manager Kevin Lowe told
reporters Hemsky might have the most talent of any player the team
has drafted in 10 years.</TE>
<TE>   * Scottie Upshall, RW, Predators. This gritty all-around forward
will be given loads of opportunity on a team that desperately needs
his scoring.</TE>
<TE>   * Stephen Weiss, C, Panthers. A two-way prospect, he will get
plenty of ice time on a young team and has a chance to flourish under
Coach Mike Keenan.</TE>

<KH>THE WORLD SERIES / ANGELS VS. SAN FRANCISCO</KH>
<HD>A Reason to Smile</HD>
<DH>Tim Salmon's postseason dream finally within reach</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There was a time when Tim Salmon considered leaving the Anaheim
Angels.</LD>
<LD>   Perhaps after last year, they wouldn't have minded.</LD>
<LD>   Now, Salmon and the Angels are happy together -- and going to
their first World Series.</LD>
<TE>   "I can't put into words what it means. It's something you dream
about as a kid and as an adult," he said Wednesday. "Even now, it's
dreamlike. We're riding with it. After 10 years of not happening,
it's like it still hasn't sunk in.</TE>
<TE>   "Sunday night, I could hardly even eat, my jaws were so sore from
smiling."</TE>
<TE>   That was the day the Angels beat the Minnesota Twins 13-5 to win
the American League championship series 4-1 and advance to the World
Series, which begins Saturday night at Edison Field.</TE>
<TE>   Salmon joined the Angels in 1992 and was the AL Rookie of the Year
the following season, hitting .283 with 31 homers and 95 RBIs.</TE>
<TE>   The 34-year-old right fielder is the Angels' career leader in home
runs (269), RBIs (894), extra-base hits (576) and total bases
(2,558).</TE>
<TE>   Salmon entered the playoffs with the most games played (1,388) and
at-bats (5,009) of any big-leaguer without postseason experience.</TE>
<TE>   "This guy has been a championship-caliber player for a long time,"
Angels Manager Mike Scioscia said. "This core, which Tim has led, has
gotten close a number of times. I think of all the guys in the
clubhouse, he realizes the journey to get here better than anyone.
He's taken nothing for granted."</TE>
<TE>   Salmon has acknowledged thinking about leaving the Angels before
signing a four-year, $40 million contract extension in March 2001
because he was concerned that there wasn't enough emphasis on
winning.</TE>
<TE>   But he stayed and his decision</TE>
<TE>   paid off with a postseason appearance.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no guarantee in life," Salmon said. "After 10 years, I
can testify to that. You've got the Derek Jeters and Chipper Joneses
who are there every year. You do start wondering, maybe it's not to
be."</TE>
<TE>   Salmon hit .286 with 22 homers and 88 RBIs this season -- not
nearly as good as some of the years he's had, but far better than
last season, when he hit .227 with 17 homers and 49 RBIs.</TE>
<TE>   And that was right after he signed the contract extension.</TE>
<TE>   "It was sad to see him go through that, he turned the page,"
hitting coach Mickey Hatcher said. "It was tough for him. It gets to
be a mental thing when you miss pitches you know you can hit."</TE>
<TE>   Salmon had surgery on his left shoulder after the 2000 season, and
it affected his bat-speed.</TE>
<TE>   "He was just a tiny bit late, wasn't able to get out there on the
fastball," Hatcher said. But it was back to normal this year.</TE>
<TE>   "The first time he grabbed a bat in spring training, I saw it," he
said. "I didn't have to say anything -- let's play."</TE>
<TE>   And that's what Salmon did, after getting past his typical slow
start.</TE>
<TE>   Center fielder Darin Erstad has also bounced back from a miserable
year in 2001.</TE>
<TE>   "I remember last year, we are kind of bosom buddies saying, 'Let's
just make it through the year,' " Salmon said. "He made it a point to
come to me the other day and say, 'Fish, we really did it.'</TE>
<TE>   "Here he and I both are. We can both appreciate it."</TE>
<TE>   Outfielder Orlando Palmeiro, who first played with the Angels in
1995, called Salmon a true professional.</TE>
<TE>   "We've had some frustrating seasons since I've been here. I can
only imagine what he's been through," Palmeiro said. "To see him
soaking up the moment is really special for me. And he really has --
I heard something about his face hurting from smiling.</TE>
<TE>   "He's always ready to work, he does everything right. That's all
you can ask for from a player. He shows up for work every day. I'm
very happy for him, for all those people who are here who never
reached the playoffs."</TE>

<HD>Playing Under the Radar</HD>
<DH>With the World Series opener, perhaps fewer East Coast fans
will sleep on hard-working, yet under-recognized West Coast players.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>To J.T. Snow, it was almost a routine play. To many others, it was
much more -- and that made the San Francisco first baseman laugh.</LD>
<LD>   Snow made a nice, backhanded stop on Chipper Jones' grounder to
start a double play that ended the first round of the playoffs. The
next day, Snow woke up to hear people all over raving about his
defense.</LD>
<LD>   "Not to be rude or anything, but I've made about a thousand plays
better than that in my career," the six-time Gold Glover said. "It
was almost like people had never seen me.</LD>
<TE>   "But it's that West Coast vs. East Coast thing. When our games
start, half the country is already asleep."</TE>
<TE>   Starting Saturday night, everyone will be wide awake when Snow and
the Giants take on the Anaheim Angels in Game 1 of the World Series.</TE>
<TE>   The timing is just right for a lot of guys. Because beyond Barry
Bonds, there are a lot of deserving players here still waiting to
make big names for themselves.</TE>
<TE>   Garret Anderson, Troy Glaus and Darin Erstad all have done huge
things for Anaheim. But really, it's a good bet that some fans are
more aware of Shane Spencer, simply because he plays for the Yankees
and always seems to show up in October.</TE>
<TE>   "I live in L.A., and three weeks ago, I didn't know any of the
Angels," said Michael Weisman, coordinating producer of Fox's
baseball coverage.</TE>
<TE>   All it takes is one clutch hit or one key play to change that.</TE>
<TE>   Or maybe one memorable game on the mound. If that happens, even
casual fans will be able to tell Russ Ortiz from Ramon Ortiz. The
two, who aren't related, could start against each other in the next
few days.</TE>
<TE>   "Some people have gotten us confused," said Russ, whose 14
victories tied for the Giants' lead. "They'll say, 'Oh, you're the
one who pitches for the Angels.' "</TE>
<TE>   Jarrod Washburn will start the opener for Anaheim. At 18-6 with a
3.15 ERA, he was excellent this year. He also exemplifies these
wild-card Angels -- successful and unheralded.</TE>
<TE>   "I mean, we were under the radar all season long and it didn't
bother us. We kind of like being the unknown team," Washburn said. "I
think we kind of all thought that if we just go out there and do what
we know we're capable of doing, pretty soon everyone's going to know
about us."</TE>
<TE>   Anderson posted another big year, hitting .306 with 56 doubles, 29
homers and 123 RBIs. Yet because he's not whistling those balls into
the upper deck at Yankee Stadium, a lot of people still aren't sure
how to spell his first name -- one "t" or two?</TE>
<TE>   Glaus has averaged 37 homers for the last four years, and led the
American League with 47 in 2000. If he'd been hitting those shots
over the Green Monster, fans in Boston and beyond would know a lot
more about him.</TE>
<TE>   Erstad got a whopping 240 hits in 2000 and became the first
leadoff man in history to have 100 RBIs. Like Glaus and Anderson, he
does not seek publicity. Even so, if he'd been doing that on the East
Coast, playing every night for Atlanta on a superstation, he'd be a
much bigger star.</TE>
<TE>   Could happen for Scott Spiezio. He hit .375 with two home runs and
11 RBIs in the first two rounds of the playoffs. Besides, he's hard
to miss now -- he's put Angel red streaks in his hair and goatee.</TE>
<TE>   "Every question about Spiezio now is, 'Is he deserving of a Gold
Glove?' " Angels outfielder Tim Salmon said. "Well, they're getting
to see him now. They're getting to see what he can do with the glove
and what he can do with the bat. Being a West Coast club, we don't
get that national recognition and exposure, so this is good for those
guys."</TE>
<TE>   Spiezio's family is thrilled by the prospects. His father, Ed, was
a backup for the St. Louis Cardinals and went 1-for-2 lifetime in
series play.</TE>
<TE>   "My mom keeps saying, 'I can't believe you're in the World
Series.' I said, 'Why not? Dad was in three,' " Spiezio said
Thursday. "She said, 'But you're playing.' "</TE>
<TE>   Snow, who played four years for the Angels and six with the
Giants, also is enthused that his teammates might get some attention.</TE>
<TE>   "When this is all over, people might be saying, 'Hey, Rich Aurilia
is pretty good hitting shortstop' or, 'You know, that David Bell
plays a nice third base,' " Snow said.</TE>
<TE>   "But guys don't just turn it on in the postseason," he said. "The
thing is, if I make a nice play against Montreal at Olympic Stadium
in the middle of the season, no one sees it and no one notices."</TE>
<TE>   Of course, there are other ways to noticed at this time of year.</TE>
<TE>   Angels reliever Ben Weber is probably better known for his
grimaces and ugly goggles than his pitches. That's fine with him.</TE>
<TE>   "I hope I'm a positive figure in a positive way. I mean, I don't
want to do what Byung-Hyun Kim did last year," he said. "I felt so
bad for that kid, but they ended up winning, so that's all that
mattered.</TE>
<TE>   "We haven't had the exposure all year and we'd like to keep it
that way. We kind of want to keep it low-key, because every time a
reliever gets in the news, it's usually something bad," he said. "So
as long as we're not in the news, I think that's better for us."</TE>

<HD>Change Isn't a Perfect 6.0</HD>
<DH>New rules to combat skating's scoring flaws to get a test
at Skate America</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With Sarah Hughes having pulled out because of injury, Alexei Yagudin
gets top billing at Skate America for his shiny gold medal at the
Salt Lake City Olympics.</LD>
<LD>   But it's the less-pleasant memories of Salt Lake City that will be
attracting all the attention. Again.</LD>
<LD>   While Yagudin kicks off the season next weekend at Skate America
in Spokane, Wash., the first Grand Prix event, a new judging system
designed to help prevent scandals will also make its debut. Judges
will be selected randomly by a computer, and no one -- not even the
judges themselves -- will know whose marks are being used.</LD>
<TE>   "I think people felt that something really needed to happen now,"
said Phyllis Howard, president of the U.S. Figure Skating Assn. "We
did feel there was some urgency to it."</TE>
<TE>   Judging shenanigans -- real or imagined -- were skating's dirty
little secret for years. It wasn't a major competition without
someone whining about being slighted, and plenty more mumbling and
grumbling was done in private.</TE>
<TE>   But skating and the Olympic movement were humiliated by the Salt
Lake City scandal. French judge Marie-Reine Le Gougne admitted she
was pressured to "vote a certain way" when she put Russian pair Elena
Berezhnaya and Anton Sikharulidze over Canadians Jamie Sale and David
Pelletier. Both couples wound up with gold medals.</TE>
<TE>   Le Gougne later recanted her accusation, but the International
Skating Union suspended her and French federation president Didier
Gailhaguet for three years and barred them from the 2006 Olympics.</TE>
<TE>   When the ISU Congress met in June in Kyoto, Japan, it was clear
changes had to be made.</TE>
<TE>   The congress approved a radical reform project that would scrap
the century-old 6.0 scoring scale and replace it with an X-Games-like
points system.</TE>
<TE>   But that system isn't ready yet, so the congress approved this new
scoring formula to be used in the meantime.</TE>
<TE>   "This is an interim proposal," said Howard, also a member of the
ISU council, the sport's governing body. "I think the proponents of
this system feel that it's a start and feel it will remove pressure
on the judges from their member federations."</TE>
<TE>   In years past, all judges on a panel marked every skater, and the
votes were posted for the public and skaters to see. A few
calculations and it was easy to figure if votes were breaking down
along cultural or geopolitical lines.</TE>
<TE>   Under the new system, the marks from the entire panel will be
posted in ascending order, first for technical merit, then for
artistry. But a computer will randomly and secretly select which
scores count -- probably seven judges from a 10-judge panel at Grand
Prix events, and nine judges of a 14-judge panel at the world
championships.</TE>
<TE>   The marks won't be read, and no one -- not the skaters, the
judges, the event officials, or the fans -- will know which judges'
scores were used or how a judge ranked one skater against another.
The only way to tell where a skater ranks will be to look at the
standings.</TE>
<TE>   "It's going to be very confusing this year, frankly," Howard said.
"We're just going to have to educate people to exactly what this is.
[And] it is an interim system."</TE>
<TE>   But ISU officials hope it will be enough to protect judges from
being pressured by their federations or other judges. If no one knows
whose marks will be used, the thinking is, how can deals be made?</TE>
<TE>   Not everyone is so sure.</TE>
<TE>   "I hope people are not buying into the new system, because I don't
believe it will work," Pelletier said. "It's weird to not know whose
mark that is, which judge. They can all hide behind it now even more.</TE>
<TE>   "The judge should be responsible," he added. "I am responsible for
what I do on the ice as soon as I step on the ice. Whatever I do is
judged. They say they are doing this to protect them. Protect them?
Did I miss something?"</TE>
<TE>   Skaters also aren't sold on the idea of dropping scores,
especially when the larger panels are used. Some of the other
subjective sports drop an athlete's highest and lowest scores, but
throwing away as many as five scores could skew the outcome of a
competition, Yagudin said.</TE>
<TE>   "What if nine vote me first, but only four of them count? And the
other five who count vote for someone else. I would have nine judges
on the panel and not win," Yagudin said. "Maybe not even be second."</TE>
<TE>   ISU officials know this new system isn't perfect. It will probably
be confusing, particularly to fans used to seeing scores lined up
judge by judge. Some say, after the Salt Lake City debacle, something
had to be done.</TE>
<TE>   Yagudin isn't convinced.</TE>
<TE>   "There will be no perfect system in our lifetime. These are humans
sitting there," Yagudin said. "I think this will not work, and in a
few years, they will go back to the old system and say, 'We did all
we could, and it did not work.' "</TE>

<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Big Ten commissioner Jim Delany has an open mind about officiating
and all the respect in the world for Penn State coach Joe Paterno.</LD>
<LD>   But amid a growing clamor from coaches and administrators to take
a hard look at league officials, Delany warned there's a line even
Paterno should not cross.</LD>
<LD>   "And where I draw the line," the commissioner said Thursday, "is
when somebody begins imputing bad intentions."</LD>
<TE>   Delany is smart enough to know he has a problem, even if it has
more to do with perception than reality. Because when officiating is
involved, they might as well be one and the same.</TE>
<TE>   Without providing exact numbers, the commissioner said preliminary
research by the league found "four or five mistakes every game,
pretty much the average for the 13 years I've been here."</TE>
<TE>   But his headaches began with a Sept. 21 game between Purdue and
nonconference opponent Wake Forest, and they've only gotten worse
since.</TE>
<TE>   After dismissing four league officials who worked that game,
Delany tried to head off a second round of problems by promising to
review Penn State's complaints about calls that figured in overtime
losses to conference rivals Iowa and Michigan. (For purposes of full
disclosure, my son attends Michigan.)</TE>
<TE>   But then Paterno turned up the pressure by suggesting favoritism
may have played a role in the Michigan game, prompting Delany to fire
back.</TE>
<TE>   In his first extended remarks on the subject, the commissioner
made clear that while he'll consider any and all tools to help Big
Ten officials do a better job -- including instant replay -- he won't
let anyone question their integrity.</TE>
<TE>   "Joe Paterno has been a leader, both inside and outside the game,
and over the course of decades he's come to represent our best
values. So if he loses confidence in the system, even temporarily,
we've lost a lot. And he's not the only one to suggest we have a
problem," Delany said.</TE>
<TE>   "But whether or not this is easily corrected, whether it's the
stresses and strains of parity, or simply because our officials had a
few bad games, the bottom line is our people are honest. And any
mistakes that were made were honest ones.</TE>
<TE>   "Recently, a number of people have said things that played very
near that line. And that," Delany said, "is where I've got a
problem."</TE>
<TE>   Paterno's problems, on the other hand, began with a Sept. 28 loss
to Iowa. Moments after the final whistle, the 75-year-old coach raced
down the sideline and grabbed an official by the jersey to complain
about two late calls.</TE>
<TE>   Paterno wasn't disciplined after the incident, but he wasn't
through complaining, either. After another late call figured in
another tough overtime loss at Michigan, Penn State athletic director
Tim Curley requested a comprehensive review of league officials.</TE>
<TE>   What finally coaxed the response from Delany was something Paterno
said during a news conference Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   "You try not to be paranoid about it, but the same crew that did
this game did the umpiring a year ago when we played Michigan,"
Paterno said.</TE>
<TE>   He also noted three crew members lived in Michigan. "There were
some concerns that some of them said to me that they had met with
Dick Honig, who was the guy I had some problems with at the Iowa
game, who lives in Ann Arbor.</TE>
<TE>   "Those kinds of things are what they should be looking at,"
Paterno continued. "Not necessarily that anybody is incompetent. We
are all human beings and have friends and impulses. I think that is
what Penn State would like to see have done. Just re-examine how
officials are assigned."</TE>
<TE>   Because of his reputation, Paterno's decision to speak up
emboldened a few of his colleagues.</TE>
<TE>   Asked if he agreed with Penn State's call for a review, Purdue
coach Joe Tiller replied, "Absolutely. Unequivocally. Yes."</TE>
<TE>   Michigan's Lloyd Carr and Illinois' Ron Turner recently echoed
those sentiments, with Turner, long a proponent of instant replay,
talking about even more sweeping changes.</TE>
<TE>   Delany said everything about the officiating program will be open
for discussion -- after the season.</TE>
<TE>   "At the moment, we're going to have to live with the handful of
mistakes that happen in every game. If they came earlier in games or
if the outcomes were different, this might not even be a topic.</TE>
<TE>   "And maybe we'll get lucky and have a few quiet weeks," he added.</TE>
<TE>   Then Delany paused. It sounded too much like wishful thinking.</TE>
<TE>   "The reality is everybody makes mistakes -- coaches, players and
officials. We'd do anything to reduce the bad calls to zero, but I
don't know if we can.</TE>
<TE>   "And look, if some form of replay would cut that down to two a
game, and there's support from coaches and administrators, we'd be
silly not to look at it," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't have a preordained view. My only stake in this is to come
up with a system our people believe in. And right now -- rightly or
wrongly -- a number of those people have lost confidence."</TE>

<HD>They're Having Bear of Time Passing Ball</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bob Oates</AU>
<BD>Special to the Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Football fans comparing the Chicago Bears against other pro clubs
this year have been struck by one obvious difference: The Bears have
the least sophisticated pass offense in the league.</LD>
<LD>   The problem is more than the Bears' simple insistence on running
repetitiously. Clearly, their coaches also lack a deep understanding
of modern pass offense.</LD>
<LD>   The Bears could, of course, improve some today at Detroit, where
they're favored over a team with a long current history of losing. By
kickoff time, thanks to a bye in their schedule, the Bears will have
had two weeks to change gears.</LD>
<TE>   In the season's first five games, though, they offered little hope
for much improvement. Starting 2-3 as a defending division champion,
the Bears regularly presented the opposite of a well-oiled,
well-coached offense.</TE>
<TE>   With some above-average receivers plus Anthony Thomas at running
back and Jim Miller at quarterback -- who has tendinitis in his
shoulder and will be replaced today by Chris Chandler -- the Chicago
talent structure is adequate. But on a daily basis, the Bears,
plainly, don't practice pass plays enough.</TE>
<TE>   And with any game on the line, they don't pass enough to learn
what an effective passing groove is. They don't really compete.</TE>
<TE>   Must Run AND Pass</TE>
<TE>   For a football team to win its share of games, the requirement is
an offensive system that, on most plays, challenges the defense with
a double threat: running and passing. The Bears instead usually line
up and run the ball with Thomas.</TE>
<TE>   Or, on third and long, they stand back and throw it.</TE>
<TE>   In other words, they tell the defense what's coming and then do
just that.</TE>
<TE>   It's a measure of how good Thomas and Miller are that they're
separately proving that if they were coupled as an integrated threat,
they'd really excel.</TE>
<TE>   The winning teams this year are doing it with a twin threat -- San
Diego, for instance, with young quarterback Drew Brees and running
back LaDainian Tomlinson.</TE>
<TE>   To win last week, 35-34, the Chargers confused Kansas City's
defensive players on most snaps by threatening simultaneously with
tough runner Tomlinson and able quarterback Brees, the San Diego
passer who put it up 41 times for 319 yards -- on a team coached by
Marty Schottenheimer, the plucky former conservative.</TE>
<TE>   The Bears, if they understood what has been happening to them,
could do the same. Their passer, Miller, has the ability of a
top-five NFL quarterback. Their runner, Thomas, could run forever
against a defense anticipating Miller. Bear fans need just that.</TE>
<TE>   A Lesson for Chicago</TE>
<TE>   The classic example of a pro club that knows how to integrate
running and passing is a ballclub in Chicago's own division, Green
Bay.</TE>
<TE>   At the moment, the Packers are playing the best in the league with
twin threats Brett Favre and Ahman Green, who have been the most
effective quarterback and running back this season.</TE>
<TE>   Realizing that NFL defense is better than ever this season, the
Packers, however, don't run the league's best running back too often.
Nor does Favre necessarily throw on every passing down. On a typical
snap, the Green Bay preference, instead, is to fake a pass, then run.
Or fake a run, then throw.</TE>
<TE>   Characteristic of the Favre-Green offense last Sunday against New
England were the two plays that led the Packers to their touchdown in
the third quarter that made it 21-3 and sent them to a big victory
against a team that had been outplaying them. Both times -- on plays
executed several moments apart -- Favre faked to Green sweeping
right, then rolled left to get a timely completion. That is
integrated offense.</TE>
<TE>   Sunday's final score (Green Bay, 28-10) doesn't accurately reflect
a game that seemed to belong to New England through most of the first
half. Only in the last three minutes of the half, after a tremendous
break -- an errant Patriot lateral that put the Packers on the
Patriot eight -- did Favre finally get the upper hand with an
eight-yard touchdown pass, 14-3. That throw went to Green, who, in a
running set, had begun as a running-play threat as usual, confusing
the Patriots on both ends of the play.</TE>
<TE>   The ball was thrown on first down -- a down on which, in Chicago,
the Bears are usually running the ball with Thomas. And Favre threw
it from a point inside the opponent's 10-yard line, where
conservative teams like Chicago always seem to be running on first
down.</TE>
<TE>   Knox Trophy</TE>
<TE>   Ahman Green -- how's that for the name of a Green Bay star? -- is
often overlooked when football fans talk about the game's best
runners. Yet Green has been the making of the 21st century Packers.</TE>
<TE>   He has not only exceeded 1,000 yards as a ground gainer in each of
his two seasons at Green Bay, he also led the club in receiving those
seasons.</TE>
<TE>   Speaking of classic examples, Green, who used to play for the
Seattle Seahawks, is this year's candidate for what should be an
annual Chuck Knox trophy. When Knox was coaching the old Los Angeles
Rams to a record five consecutive division titles, he always said:
"Absolutely the worst mistake you can make is to cut a good player."</TE>
<TE>   Thus after reviewing player performance at length, Knox made every
cut at the last moment, if not later.</TE>
<TE>   The Seahawks, despite their record for soundness, were apparently
not that thorough this time.</TE>
<TE>   Although they knew enough about Green to draft him after his
junior year at Nebraska, they gave up on him after only two seasons
and traded him to a place where, with that name, he belonged all the
time.</TE>
<TE>   He is one of the most unusual of NFL running backs. At 6-0 and 217
pounds, Green doesn't overwhelm in any of the six respects -- power,
speed, quickness, moves, slashing ability or receiving ability -- but
he ranks close to first in the league when you average all that out.</TE>
<TE>   Most significantly, in an integrated pass-run world, he makes
Favre better than ever.</TE>
<TE>   Truman Trophy</TE>
<TE>   The world-champion Patriots, who are spending their bye week
regrouping before the Denver Broncos appear at Foxboro on Oct. 27,
have fallen two games behind a Miami team that expects to be in a
Super Bowl preview Nov. 4 in a big Monday nighter at Green Bay.</TE>
<TE>   By then, the Dolphins feel they will have worked quarterback Ray
Lucas into the attack that offensive coordinator Norv Turner has
improved considerably.</TE>
<TE>   Lucas and Miami starter Jay Fiedler, who will be out awhile with a
broken thumb, are this year's co-leaders for what could be called
Harry Truman trophy recognition. Of Truman it was said, in the days
before he became a great president, that he proves anybody can be
president.</TE>
<TE>   Of the two Miami quarterbacks it might be said they prove that
anybody can be an NFL quarterback. Both players, minus NFL talent,
are wondrous performers.</TE>
<TE>   The question as the season started was whether Turner -- who broke
into pro ball as an adventurous offensive coordinator -- or head
coach Dave Wannstedt, a notorious conservative sort, would call the
tune offensively at Miami. So far, Turner seems to have prevailed.</TE>
<TE>   But the nearer the Dolphins get to the playoffs, the more you have
to remember that Wannstedt is in charge.</TE>
<TE>   Catching Problems</TE>
<TE>   The result of a New England-Miami rematch in Foxboro on Dec. 29 --
the Patriots lost at Miami on Oct. 6, 26-13 -- could well depend on
whether Patriot Coach Bill Belichick can get more production out of
his corps of receivers.</TE>
<TE>   Receiving breakdowns beat him in the Green Bay game.</TE>
<TE>   The only reliable New England catcher is Troy Brown, who is one of
football's finest but relatively ineffective now, for him, with what
appears to be a very bad knee. Otherwise last Sunday, even veteran
Patriot receiver David Patten was among the many dropping quarterback
Tom Brady's passes or otherwise running the wrong way or misplaying
the ball or failing to fight for it.</TE>
<TE>   Belichick, whose football instincts are beyond question, knew
enough this season to improve New England's receiving after winning
the Super Bowl with not much besides Brown and Patten. But so far he
has been unlucky in his additions -- a thing that often happens in
pro ball when a team goes for need.</TE>
<TE>   Patriot free agent Donald Hayes, the 6-4 receiver whose last stop
was at Carolina, has the size Brady needs but doesn't seem nifty or
fast enough. Rookie Deion Branch has the speed but at 5-10 and 193
not the size or strength. The new tight ends, Christian Fauria and
Cam Cleeland, have helped some but not enough.</TE>
<TE>   The upshot in the Green Bay game was that Brady could outplay
Favre in the first half, controlling the ball on twice as many plays
as Green Bay ran, though in the end he became a victim of the
Patriots' many errors.</TE>
<TE>   Coming QBs?</TE>
<TE>   Lost in the commotion over Minnesota's first win this year --
which, as Detroit fell, 31-24, in Week 6, was also the first win for
controversial receiver Randy Moss -- was rookie quarterback Joey
Harrington's big game for the Lions.</TE>
<TE>   On a 309-yard passing day, 25 for 41, he led veteran Viking
quarterback Daunte Culpepper for three quarters. Only on his last
long drive did Harrington throw his interception at the end, when as
the quarterbacks all say, they have to try to make something happen.</TE>
<TE>   In a 43-27 loss, another rookie quarterback, Patrick Ramsey of
Washington, also had a 300-plus yard day in a game-long catch-up
effort against the much better New Orleans Saints, the only conqueror
of Tampa Bay this season. The Tampa Bay-New Orleans rematch winner
Dec. 1, pairing two teams now 5-1, plans to take the 5-1 Packers out
of the Super Bowl.</TE>

<HD>Far-Off Terrorism Cuts Close to Home</HD>
<DH></DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Philip Linssen, co-owner and manager of the San Diego Ice Arena in
Mira Mesa, always figured that a few outside players could have a big
effect on his small business: the local banker and maybe Fed Chairman
Alan Greenspan. But now, he has another name to add to that list:
Osama bin Laden.</LD>
<LD>   The awful truth is that terrorism is becoming a permanent factor
in the U.S. and world economies.</LD>
<LD>   The terrorist bombing that just killed more than 180 people in
Bali, Indonesia, drove that point home. So did the flood of airline
industry losses reported last week -- hundreds of millions of dollars
in red ink at AMR Corp.'s American Airlines, UAL Corp.'s United
Airlines and Delta Air Lines Inc.</LD>
<TE>   Bluntly put, the economy is at a turning point -- and terror is
one reason. The easy growth of global trade and access to finance
that characterized world business in the last two decades are over
now.</TE>
<TE>   "America is at the beginning of a contained depression, a period
of generally disappointing profits and financial retrenchment that
may last for years," says economist David Levy of the Levy
Forecasting Institute in Mount Kisco, N.Y.</TE>
<TE>   The need to work down corporate debt and correct abuses of the
1990s is to blame for most of the those troubles, Levy says. But
terrorism is definitely a factor as well.</TE>
<TE>   Feeling the Effects</TE>
<TE>   Most everyone is familiar with the drumbeat of costs associated
with terror. Skyscrapers cannot easily get insurance these days. The
newest estimates by the Bush administration and insurance experts
show that $15 billion in new building projects and a potential
300,000 jobs have been lost in the year since the great terror
attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.</TE>
<TE>   Communities around the globe that are dependent on tourism have
suffered, with more losses anticipated in the wake of the Bali
bombing.</TE>
<TE>   The federal government has responded rightly to both the terrorist
threat and the economic one by spending heavily -- an additional $40
billion this year on homeland security, plus $355 billion on defense,
of which about $100 billion is paying for the worldwide war on
terrorism. Last week, the White House and congressional leaders
worked to create government protection for the insurance industry so
projects could get coverage.</TE>
<TE>   But less well recognized amid these ballooning statistics is that
the effects of terror have seeped down into the warp and woof of the
economy, affecting small businesses directly and indirectly.</TE>
<TE>   Listen, for instance, to the worries of Teresa Covington, chief
financial officer of Line 6 Inc., a 208-employee company in Agoura
Hills that makes sophisticated guitar amplifiers and other musical
accessories that are sold online and in stores in 60 countries. Line
6 will struggle this year to equal its $38.9 million in sales in
2001.</TE>
<TE>   "Our insurance broker has told us to expect a 25% to 35% increase
in our general property coverage and 50% in workers compensation for
2003," Covington says. "I attribute most of those increases to the
weak financial conditions of the insurance companies and re-insurers
as a result of the terror attacks."</TE>
<TE>   After the Indonesia bombing and incidents in the Philippines last
week, Covington says, "we are greatly concerned about any terror
activity in Malaysia since our contract manufacturing is done there."</TE>
<TE>   $1.9 Billion in Loans</TE>
<TE>   Recognizing the effect of far-off terrorism on small companies,
the Bush administration in January set up the Supplementary Terrorist
Activity Relief program to guarantee loans to firms that may have
been affected by 9/11.</TE>
<TE>   To date, the Small Business Administration effort has lent more
than $1.9 billion to 4,897 companies nationwide, including $466.3
million to 1,017 firms in California.</TE>
<TE>   Linssen, the Mira Mesa ice-rink entrepreneur, got one of those
loans to upgrade his 30-year-old arena and keep it in business.</TE>
<TE>   The effect of terrorism was slow and indirect.</TE>
<TE>   "On Sept. 11 we closed and stayed closed another day, but people
didn't come back to skating right away," he says. "It has taken a
year to stabilize.</TE>
<TE>   "In an Olympic year like this," he adds, "we normally would do
$1.8 million in annual revenue. But we won't do that this year."</TE>
<TE>   Linssen and partners were considering closing up shop.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't want a commercial loan with the business so uncertain,"
Linssen explains, "but the banker kept insisting that I apply to
SBA."</TE>
<TE>   He did so, and after months of preparing a business plan, the rink
won an SBA-guaranteed loan of more than $600,000, enough to pay for a
new skating surface and other upgrades to accommodate the young
figure skaters and hockey players</TE>
<TE>   who keep the place open from 4:30 a.m. to midnight.</TE>
<TE>   "It's really impressive to see those young skaters come out so
early in the morning to practice," says Linssen, an accountant by
training who immigrated to Southern California from Cape Town, South
Africa. "It makes you think that maybe higher profits are not that
important."</TE>
<TE>   A nice thought perhaps. But is it good business for the government
to guarantee a loan to an ice arena just because 9/11 seemed to have
slowed its already struggling business?</TE>
<TE>   All things considered, the answer is yes. The river of government
spending now flowing strong is a big factor in keeping the nation's
economic malaise from becoming something far worse.</TE>
<TE>   In the case of Linssen and his 40 employees at the Ice Arena,
their dedication promises to make the place work. It's a good bet
that the loan will be repaid.</TE>
<TE>   In microcosm, the Linssen loan and the many more made to small
firms this year reflect the U.S. economy's ability to adapt -- even
in the face of something as menacing as this new challenge of terror.</TE>

<HD>Southland Defense Companies Homing In on Laser Weapons</HD>
<DH>Laboratories make significant strides in developing
technology that some say could revolutionize warfare.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Peter Pae</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Turning a Buck Rogers fantasy into reality, Southern California
defense companies are on the verge of building a laser weapon small
enough to fit on a fighter jet, yet powerful enough to destroy an
enemy aircraft at the blink of an eye.</LD>
<LD>   After more than four decades of doggedly pursuing the elusive
technology, engineers working in at least three laboratories around
the Southland have been quietly developing high-powered, solid-state
lasers that some defense analysts say could revolutionize warfare.</LD>
<LD>   The laser guns are still years away from being used in combat and
won't play any role if the U.S. goes to war with Iraq. In fact, it
may be the end of the decade before they are installed on fighters,
tanks and destroyers.</LD>
<TE>   But laser scientists say significant technical challenges recently
have been overcome, transforming laser weapons from a laboratory
project into a promising part of the U.S. arsenal.</TE>
<TE>   With such lasers, a fighter jet could destroy ground targets with
pinpoint accuracy, significantly reducing the chance of injuring
civilians.</TE>
<TE>   A Navy ship could use the laser, with its beam traveling at the
speed of light, to fend off even the fastest missiles. And ground
troops could use a Humvee-mounted version of the weapon to instantly
knock out incoming enemy artillery and mortar shells.</TE>
<TE>   "This is not a pipe dream anymore," said Chaunchy F. McKearn,
director for high-energy laser programs at Raytheon Corp. in El
Segundo, where a laboratory recently was built to put together a
table-size solid-state laser weapon. "The glacier is finally moving."</TE>
<TE>   Besides Raytheon, other large defense contractors working to build
laser weapons at their Southland facilities include TRW Corp. in
Redondo Beach and Boeing Co. in the San Fernando Valley. Southern
California is also home to HRL Laboratories in Malibu, where the
first laser was built 42 years ago and continues to be the foremost
center for solid-state laser research.</TE>
<TE>   Raytheon already is working with Lockheed Martin Co. to outfit the
next-generation fighter jet, known as the Joint Strike Fighter, with
a solid-state laser. Lockheed officials said they are considering
modifying the short takeoff-vertical landing version of the plane to
carry a 100-kilowatt laser gun. The weapon would be powered by
electricity generated by the jet engine and used mainly to defend the
warplane from missiles.</TE>
<TE>   Raytheon also is teaming with Northrop Grumman Corp. to outfit the
next-generation Navy destroyer, dubbed DDX, with a laser that would
use the ship's electric drive to power a laser-based air-defense
system.</TE>
<TE>   TRW, which has about 500 engineers working on laser programs, has
been exploring the possibility of developing a laser that would fit
in a casing the size of an external fuel tank. It could then be
attached under the wings of fighter jets, much like a missile or a
bomb.</TE>
<TE>   At Boeing's Integrated Defense unit in West Hills, engineers are
working on advanced tactical lasers that could fit on the company's
V-22 tilt-rotor aircraft and other helicopters to take out
short-range targets.</TE>
<TE>   The word "laser" is an acronym that stands for "light
amplification by stimulated emission of radiation." The technology
turns atomic particles into light with enough radiation to damage an
object it encounters.</TE>
<TE>   The range and severity of the damage depend on how much power can
be generated and how well the light can be focused on the target.</TE>
<TE>   Solid State vs. Chemical</TE>
<TE>   The beam from a solid-state laser is powered by electricity, which
can be generated by a gas-powered jet engine or the turbines of a
tank.</TE>
<TE>   Chemical lasers are capable of producing much more energy, but
because the energy output relies on the quantity of chemicals used,
they take up a lot of space.</TE>
<TE>   The laser's potential as a weapon was recognized when it was
conceived in 1957, but development has been slow. Critics had been
skeptical of claims made by defense contractors regarding laser
technology because the companies have long promised more than they
have delivered.</TE>
<TE>   Yet John Pike, director of GlobalSecurity.org, a defense research
firm that often criticizes weapons programs as impractical, said
solid-state laser weapons technology finally appears to be moving
from "pure physics to engineering."</TE>
<TE>   "They're starting to talk about specific platforms and specific
missions for the lasers," Pike said. "They are getting close enough
that they can actually ask for money with some confidence that they
can deliver on what they promised."</TE>
<TE>   Although the Pentagon has emphasized development of chemical
lasers, the focus in the last year has begun to shift to solid-state
variants, which would be easier to package and transport. Low-power
solid-state lasers are used in a variety of commercial applications,
from compact disc players to grocery store scanners.</TE>
<TE>   The Holy Grail</TE>
<TE>   Research insolid-state lasers received a major boost last month
when the Pentagon quietly launched a $50-million initiative to
develop a 25-kilowatt laser by the end of 2004, with the goal of
deploying by the end of the decade a 100-kilowatt laser that could be
installed on warplanes, tanks and ships.</TE>
<TE>   The most powerful laser currently is a 10-kilowatt model that is
being tested by the Army.</TE>
<TE>   Information about the damage such lasers could inflict is
classified. But in general, experts say, a 25-kilowatt laser could
blind an enemy sensor several hundred miles away. It also could put a
hole through a sheet of metal from a distance of several miles.</TE>
<TE>   Correspondingly, a 100-kilowatt solid-state laser -- the Holy
Grail for weapons developers -- could deliver a destructive beam to a
target dozens of miles away, making it an effective tactical weapon.</TE>
<TE>   A laser's beam would not by itself cause a target to explode. But
it could slice through the outer casing of a missile, disabling the
guidance system or causing the missile's propellant to explode.</TE>
<TE>   Lasers do have one big drawback. The beam is not very effective in
inclement weather and requires greater levels of energy to pierce
thick clouds.</TE>
<TE>   Still, such technology is at the center of a major strategic shift
underway at the Pentagon, where war planners are looking for
so-called transformational weapons.</TE>
<TE>   Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld "is hot on ... the notion of
zapping people," Pike said. "Lasers are in line with Rumsfeld's idea
of transforming the military, which is to come up with wonder-weapons
that other countries can't emulate."</TE>
<TE>   Advancing Technology</TE>
<TE>   The Pentagon's focus on solid-state lasers represents a
significant step in the technology.</TE>
<TE>   "Based on the knowledge of the science that we have and the
technology breakthroughs that have been coming from the contractors,
we felt it was a good point in time to encourage competition to push
the technology along," said Capt. Kalliroi Lagonik, the Pentagon's
project manager for solid-state lasers.</TE>
<TE>   For the military, low-kilowatt solid-state lasers have been used
mainly for determining the distance of a target or to tag targets to
improve the accuracy of other weapons. Pentagon research dollars have
been spent mostly on developing chemical lasers, which for years have
held the most promise for producing high-energy beams with ranges
measured in miles instead of inches.</TE>
<TE>   It's not clear how much the Pentagon has spent developing a laser
weapon, but an Air Force official last summer said that his service
alone had poured $4.5 billion into direct-energy weapons, which
include microwave and chemical laser technologies.</TE>
<TE>   But in recent years, Pentagon officials have raised concerns about
the size of the system required to fire a deadly chemical beam.
What's more, some have expressed worries about the potential
environmental damage from caustic chemicals.</TE>
<TE>   Weapons developers at Kirtland Air Force Base in New Mexico, for
instance, have been able to shoot a chemical laser and put a
basketball-size hole in a Scud missile replica from dozens of miles
away. But to do that required several truck-size vats filled with
chemicals.</TE>
<TE>   Environmentalists are concerned about the deployment of a modified
Boeing 747, the world's largest commercial jet, that would operate
the nation's first airborne chemical laser, contending that the
chemical beam could be harmful to the atmosphere and that the
potential for toxic spills is unacceptable.</TE>
<TE>   It may be possible to scale down the chemical laser to fit on a
fighter jet or an armored vehicle, but it could take decades to
perfect the technology, some analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, scientists working on solid-state lasers have made
major strides in boosting the power output and the quality of the
beam, two key factors for determining a laser's lethality and
accuracy.</TE>
<TE>   "Over time, solid-state lasers will become more powerful and more
compact, which will make them more useful on the battlefield and
perhaps revolutionize the conduct of war," said Loren B. Thompson,
chief operations officer for Lexington Institute, a defense think
tank.</TE>
<TE>   "I have no doubt that by the end of the decade, we will have a
laser weapon installed on a Joint Strike Fighter jet or an AC-130
gunship."</TE>

<LD>   I can see that I will be spending more time at Universal. With
attendance down, you would think they would be doing more to attract
guests, not alienate them.</LD>
<LD>   They've raised ticket prices, discontinued many of the classic
shows that made Disney, raised the price of parking, discontinued the
Disney Club -- what's next? Will they start charging for
re-admission?</LD>
<TE>   I've been going to Disneyland since 1978. Every time I go now I

<DL></DL>
<LD>I was surprised to learn that PacifiCare Health Systems Inc. has
offered a new HMO program with a major catastrophic void noted
["PacifiCare's New HMO to Limit Choice," Oct. 4]. The gist of the
program, as reported, is to reduce cost to employers as well as the
insured by offering a trimmed-down number of physicians and
authorized hospitals.</LD>
<LD>   The three hospitals that were dropped from PacifiCare's list were
Childrens Hospital of Los Angeles, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center and
UCLA.</LD>
<LD>   Probably more than 80% of the specialized critical pediatric care
in this county is handled by these centers and the only other
nongovernmental hospitals in this county that have pediatric
intensive-care units are in Pasadena and Long Beach.</LD>
<TE>   The largest obstetrical unit in the area is at Cedars-Sinai, which
is known for its care of the high-risk pregnancy patient. It is a
shame that an insurer is willing to jeopardize the health of a child
by offering such an inadequate package and that the larger employers
were willing to take an interest in it.</TE>

<HD>Marketing Costs Scale the Heights</HD>
<DH>The stage is set for Hollywood to surpass the nearly $3
billion it shelled out in 2001 to promote its movies</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Claudia Eller</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When John Woo's costly World War II epic "Windtalkers" had a
disastrous debut this summer, MGM Studios responded in Hollywood
fashion: It spent millions of dollars on emergency marketing.</LD>
<LD>   Despite the infusion of cash for new ads, the box-office receipts
didn't climb, but the losses did. "Windtalkers," starring Nicolas
Cage, grossed just $41 million in the U.S., or $1 million less than
what sources said it cost to market. And that didn't include the
film's price tag of more than $110 million.</LD>
<LD>   Such desperation spending has helped drive studio marketing
expenses to an all-time high. Ten years ago, it cost an average of
$12 million to market a studio movie. Today, that average is $31
million, and studios can spend nearly twice that on big "event"
releases such as "Spider-Man." With spending on movie advertising up
17% so far this year, the stage is set for Hollywood to surpass the
nearly $3 billion it shelled out to promote its movies in 2001.</LD>
<TE>   The record amounts increasingly are skewing the economics of the
volatile movie business and raising the ante in the high-stakes
box-office game. The studios say if they spend more they'll make
more, particularly on blockbuster hopefuls. It's great when it works,
but when it doesn't, marketing costs eat away at already thin profit
margins and bloat the losses on big flops.</TE>
<TE>   For every heavily promoted movie such as "Spider-Man," which has
grossed more than $800 million worldwide before one DVD has gone on
sale, there are dozens of duds such as "Windtalkers," which struggle
to recoup their marketing costs, let alone make a profit.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone thinks we spend like drunken sailors, and they're
right," said Peter Adee, who took over marketing at MGM after the
release of "Windtalkers." "It's because it's an all-or-nothing game.
You either open [big] or you die, so there's a lot at stake."</TE>
<TE>   Afraid to Be Timid</TE>
<TE>   Studio executives believe they cannot afford to spend less than
their competitors even on movies with built-in audience awareness
such as the highly anticipated sequel "Men In Black II," which had a
$50-million promotion campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Even with support from a big advertising partner such as Pepsi,
which New Line Cinema teamed up with for its big summer comedy,
"Austin Powers in Goldmember," studios still spend as much as they
would have on their own.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to make sure you're not taking anything for granted,"
said Russell Schwartz, marketing president at New Line, which is
owned by AOL Time Warner. "We can't assume the promotional partner is
actually selling the movie or just creating awareness. We still have
to spend to make sure the audience understands why they need to go
see it."</TE>
<TE>   The same was true at Sony Pictures this summer. The studio perhaps
could have saved some of the $60 million it spent to market an
already highly-recognizable title, "Spider-Man."</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody wants to save the dollar that leaves you a dollar short,"
said Jeff Blake, head of worldwide marketing and distribution at Sony
Pictures. "Could we have saved a couple of dollars and pulled a
couple of bricks out of the building? I wouldn't have even wanted to
try."</TE>
<TE>   Some question the wisdom of such excessive spending when studios'
corporate parents, such as AOL Time Warner, Walt Disney Co. and
Vivendi Universal, are being pummeled by the stock market.</TE>
<TE>   "It is obscene," said Peter Sealey, a marketing consultant and
adjunct professor at UC Berkeley who headed marketing at Columbia
Pictures in the mid-1980s. "There's no excuse for the consistent
overspending ... it's close to corporate fraud."</TE>
<TE>   There is no way to quantify what advertising dollars actually buy.
Studios defend big-budget marketing because they believe it can turn
a solid performer into a global blockbuster and deliver additional
revenue with the sale of videos, DVDs, TV rights and merchandise.
With high-profile movies today often costing more than $100 million
to produce, executives reason, a mega-marketing campaign is the
insurance policy that protects that investment.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to spend money to make money," said Geoffrey Ammer,
marketing president at Sony, which outspent its competitors this
summer to promote such hits as "Spider-Man," "Men in Black 2" and
"XXX."</TE>
<TE>   But the studio also spent about $50 million to promote its
$120-million sequel "Stuart Little 2," which opened to a dismal $15
million and grossed $63 million in the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   The 'Batman' Factor</TE>
<TE>   Hollywood's current spending frenzy can be traced to 1989, when
Warner Bros. flexed its marketing muscles with another big event
movie, "Batman." Far in advance of the movie's release, the studio
bought TV ads and plastered billboards with the iconic bat logo.
"Batman" also started the trend of opening movies in more than 2,000
theaters.</TE>
<TE>   Today, the push to open films even wider requires studios to mount
lavish marketing campaigns aimed at filling those seats on what has
become a movie's do-or-die opening weekend. If a movie doesn't
immediately ignite at the box office, it will be kicked out of the
way by the next mega-marketed competitor -- dramatically cutting its
chances of turning a profit.</TE>
<TE>   "If you don't hit it within 24 to 72 hours, you're out of the
game," said Universal Pictures Vice Chairman Marc Shmuger.</TE>
<TE>   Added Robert Friedman, vice chairman of Paramount Pictures Motion
Picture Group, "The life expectancy of movies is shortened by this
style of marketing ... it feeds on itself."</TE>
<TE>   Sealey, the onetime marketing chief, calls Hollywood the "last
remaining bastion of irrationality in the marketing world,"
especially because studios have the benefit of pre-release tracking
that helps predict a movie's prospects.</TE>
<TE>   Studio bosses say such marketing research sometimes comes too
late.</TE>
<TE>   By the time Disney realized it had a dud on its hands with its
$80-million action comedy "Bad Company," it couldn't rein in its
$39-million ad campaign.</TE>
<TE>   "Unfortunately, when you're opening a movie, you've spent most of
your money and you have to hope and pray that your movie will break
through," said Disney Studios Chairman Richard Cook. "That's the
movie business."</TE>
<TE>   When movies do open poorly, like "Windtalkers," studios defend
pouring more money into advertising in hope of setting up the movie's
release beyond the box office.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not saying we made the right decision," said MGM Chief
Operating Officer Chris McGurk, "but you're trying to create
awareness for the video and DVD release and hopefully that pays off."</TE>
<TE>   More than 2 million videos and DVDs of "Windtalkers" arrived in
stores last week. MGM officials project the movie will generate more
than $30 million in home entertainment revenue over the next six
months. Even then, the movie still will lose money.</TE>
<TE>   In this environment, it's not surprising that marketing costs
continue to rise as studios struggle to make their films stand out.</TE>
<TE>   A recent Warner Bros. study showed that between October 2001 and
March, an average of 27 movies -- and as many as 43 -- were
advertised each week on television, Hollywood's preferred advertising
medium.</TE>
<TE>   "The clutter in the TV marketplace is so severe, you've got to get
your message through," said Warner Bros. domestic marketing chief
Dawn Taubin.</TE>
<TE>   Studios feel the need to spend big on innovative ways to get their
movie noticed.</TE>
<TE>   This summer, Revolution Studios painted a 100-foot-by- 500-foot
logo and Aug. 9 release date of its thriller "XXX" on the roof of the
Hollywood Park racetrack so it would be visible to passengers on
flights making their approach to Los Angeles International Airport.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a clutter-buster.... We had to do something to distinguish
ourselves," said Revolution marketing President Terry Curtain.</TE>
<TE>   Caught in the Middle</TE>
<TE>   Getting noticed isn't the only pressure studios feel these days.</TE>
<TE>   Executives say they are caught between parent companies imploring
them to spend less and powerful, marketing- savvy stars and
filmmakers urging them to spend more.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a hard line to walk," said Schwartz. "On one hand, you have
corporate pressure not to overspend, then you've got talent, producer
and agent pressure to spend what they think is enough. And on the
blockbusters, there's an expectation that you're going to spend an
aggressive amount based on the competition."</TE>
<TE>   Producers will tell you that it's part of their job description to
badger studios.</TE>
<TE>   "That's what producers do," said industry veteran Laurence Mark.
"We figure out different ways of telling the studios to spend more
money ... you have to buy attention because you're competing with a
lot of big spenders."</TE>
<TE>   Of course, there are exceptions to that rule.</TE>
<TE>   Take this year's two biggest surprise hits, MGM's "Barbershop" and
IFC's "My Big Fat Greek Wedding." Both low-budget movies had narrowly
focused marketing campaigns costing about $20 million each.</TE>
<TE>   "Most films today do not follow that pattern, and they become
instant blockbusters through the sheer force of the marketing," said
Paul Dergarabedian, whose company, Exhibitor Relations Co., tracks
box-office results.</TE>
<TE>   But as "Windtalkers" and others prove, marketing doesn't guarantee
success.</TE>
<TE>   Studio marketers say they see no way out of the cycle of
unrestrained spending.</TE>
<TE>   "If there was some kind of spending cap to keep us from our bad
habits, it would be greatly welcomed," said New Line's Schwartz.</TE>

<HD>Take a Hard Look at Situation Before Turning to Bankruptcy</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Liz Pulliam Weston</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Question: I bought my house four years ago for $178,000. I borrowed
$150,000 and now have a second mortgage for $26,000, as well as
credit card debt. With all this debt, my husband has to work a second
job to pay all our bills. If I sell the house and pay off the
mortgages and the credit cards, I can walk away free from debt. I
would want to purchase another home, though, and starting out with
virtually no down payment would be tough. As an alternative, I am
considering a Chapter 13 bankruptcy filing to wipe out my debt and
stay in my house. Can you help me?</LD>
<LD>   Answer: Probably not. You left out too much information, such as
how much your home has appreciated, how much your credit card bills
are and whether you're falling behind on the payments. But here are
some questions to consider:</LD>
<LD>   How did you get all this credit card and second mortgage debt in
the first place? Was it a catastrophe for which you failed to plan,
such as a job loss or huge medical bills? Or do you just spend more
than you earn? If you file for bankruptcy protection, how would that
change the situation that got you into this mess? If you don't learn
to control your spending and set aside some money for emergencies,
won't you be right back in this same place in a few years?</LD>
<TE>   Are you looking at bankruptcy as a way to escape your mortgages as
well as your credit card debts? If so, it won't work. Debt that's
secured by your home generally has to be paid off, one way or
another.</TE>
<TE>   Do you understand that Chapter 13 does not necessarily erase your
debts, but requires you to repay at least some of them? That's
different from a Chapter 7, which erases most debts but may require
you to give up your property, or at least the equity in your home. A
Chapter 13 filing allows you to keep your home, while paying your
creditors over three years. After that, the remaining balance is
usually wiped out.</TE>
<TE>   If, with some effort, you could pay your credit cards back over
the next three years, then bankruptcy wouldn't be a great option for
you. If, however, you already are falling behind and unable to make
payments, bankruptcy could be a way for you to meet at least some of
your obligations and keep your home.</TE>
<TE>   You should discuss your options with a qualified bankruptcy
attorney before taking any action. You also should take a hard look
at your spending, and make sure that if you do file for bankruptcy
protection, it's a one-time event, not the pattern of a lifetime.</TE>
<TE>   Selling Second Home Can Mean Tax Bite</TE>
<TE>   Q: I recently sold a vacation home that we owned for 12 years. I
know that there is a tax exclusion available when you sell your
primary residence, but am not sure about the tax consequences of
selling a second home. Although we made little or no profit on this
house, I would like to know the consequences for any gain we might
have.</TE>
<TE>   A: When you sell your primary residence, each owner can avoid
paying capital gains taxes on as much as $250,000 of profit. So a
married couple could have $500,000 of profit on a home without paying
any taxes.</TE>
<TE>   You're correct that there is no such exclusion for a second or
vacation home. Such property is treated like any other asset, with
the profit taxed at capital gains rates. Although federal capital
gains rates are lower than federal income tax rates, this tax bite
can still hurt.</TE>
<TE>   But only if you make a profit.</TE>
<TE>   If you made some improvements to the property over the years (and
kept the receipts), you can add those costs to whatever you paid for
the home. That's the figure you'll subtract from your sale price to
determine your profit. If, as you suspect, your profit wasn't much,
your tax bill won't be either.</TE>
<TE>   All this assumes you didn't rent out your vacation home. If you
did, you could run into some other tax rules regarding any
depreciation you took along the way. If that's the case, consult a
tax professional for details.</TE>
<TE>   Seek Expert's Help to Catch Up With IRS</TE>
<TE>   Q: In 1972, a friend quit filing with the IRS as a protest against
the Vietnam War (or so he says). Now, he is thinking he might want to
come back into the fold, being nearly of retirement age. He has
worked quietly in the trades for very little money all those years
and doesn't even have a checking account. I told him to just start
filing and take it from there. He thinks they will "come and get
him." What do you think?</TE>
<TE>   A: Your friend would be smart to hire a tax pro who's experienced
in "tax controversy" -- that's code for "smoothing things out with
the IRS." Since your friend hasn't filed a return in 30 years, the
statute of limitations hasn't even started (it's only after you file
a return that the clock starts ticking). If he was paid cash all
those years, and never had money withheld, he could owe back taxes --
it depends on how little "very little money" actually was.</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, if he did have money withheld, he's forfeited
most of it, because you generally can't claim a refund that's more
than three years old.</TE>
<TE>   What would be even sadder is if he never contributed to Social
Security during his working years. If you're low-income, Social
Security checks can equal 40% or more of what you earned during your
working years. But you have to pay into the system to get anything
out.</TE>
<TE>   You may be right that he doesn't have much to worry about, but
better safe than sorry.</TE>
<TE>   Given the Internal Revenue Service's notorious bureaucracy, it can
pay to have a guide who's familiar with how things work and who knows
whom to call inside the vast IRS machine to make sure your friend's
"return to the fold" doesn't somehow go awry.</TE>

<LD>Stock Market Posts Another Positive Week</LD>
<LD>   Stocks racked up their second straight winning week as Wall Street
cheered better-than-expected corporate profits.</LD>
<LD>   The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index jumped 5.9% for the week, and the
Dow climbed 6%, the biggest weekly gains for both indexes since
September 2001. The tech-laden Nasdaq composite index rose 6.4%, its
biggest one-week increase since May.</LD>
<TE>   Upbeat earnings or forecasts from bellwether companies such as IBM
and Microsoft helped power the market, while investors looked beyond
weak results from Sears and Intel. Concern about a possible war with
Iraq continued to weigh on the market, however.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Former Top Executive of Enron Pleads Guilty</TE>
<TE>   A former top Enron Corp. executive pleaded guilty to a federal
conspiracy charge for rigging California's electricity markets during
the power crisis, giving the state powerful ammunition in its claim
for $9 billion in refunds from energy companies.</TE>
<TE>   Timothy Belden, 35, Enron's chief energy trader in the West and a
corporate vice president, became the first person convicted of a
crime in connection with California's 2000-01 energy crisis. He also
agreed to cooperate with investigators in a widening probe that could
lead to charges against executives at Enron and other companies.</TE>
<TE>   The guilty plea, which also requires Belden to forfeit $2.1
million in "criminally derived" compensation from Enron, was
vindication for California Gov. Gray Davis and other state officials
who have alleged that criminality was at the root of the crisis. Last
year, Vice President Dick Cheney suggested California was to blame.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Global Crossing Probe Targets Period in 2001</TE>
<TE>   Federal investigators looking into possible wrongdoing at Global
Crossing Ltd. are sharpening their focus on the first half of 2001, a
period when employees took questionable steps to fend off financial
collapse and top executives cashed out shares.</TE>
<TE>   Internal documents and e-mails obtained by The Times show that by
May 2001, the telecommunications company was dangerously close to
violating a key bank requirement. Had such a violation occurred,
Global Crossing's banks could have demanded repayment of more than $2
billion in loans, triggering a default on $3.8 billion in notes.</TE>
<TE>   In turn, Global Crossing could have been forced into Bankruptcy
Court months before its Chapter 11 filing Jan. 28. To avert the
potential crisis, Global Crossing employees used suspect accounting
to boost the company's adjusted EBITDA, or adjusted earnings before
interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization, according to e-mails
and interviews with former employees. Raising that figure helped keep
the firm in compliance with a bank formula that measured its adjusted
EBITDA against its total debt.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Sun Microsystems Posts Loss, Plans Job Cuts</TE>
<TE>   Sun Microsystems Inc. posted a $111-million loss for its fiscal
first quarter and said it would cut 11% of its worldwide staff, the
most aggressive move yet by a Silicon Valley bellwether to compensate
for lackluster sales by slashing costs.</TE>
<TE>   The layoffs, which will begin in November and reduce full-time
staff by 4,400, will be supplemented by widespread cuts among the
Santa Clara, Calif.-based computer maker's temporary and contract
workers.</TE>
<TE>   Such cuts will hit California hard: 16,000 of the 39,400 employees
work in the state.</TE>
<TE>   The news marks the second major round of cuts at Sun, which shed
10% of its staff, or about 3,900 jobs, a year ago.</TE>
<TE>   For the three months ended Sept. 29, Sun's per-share loss was 4
cents. A year earlier, the company posted a loss of $180 million, or
6 cents a share.</TE>
<TE>   Sun's first-period revenue fell 7% to $2.7 billion.</TE>

<TE>   Boeing Profit Falls 43% Amid Continued Slump</TE>
<TE>   Battered by a slump in the commercial aircraft business, aerospace
giant Boeing Co. reported sharply lower third-quarter earnings and
acknowledged that a downturn in the airline industry could last
through 2004.</TE>
<TE>   Boeing Chairman Philip Condit also predicted that the
Chicago-based company's commercial satellite and rocket launch
business would remain sluggish for the foreseeable future. Much of
Boeing's satellite and rocket work is handled in Southern California,
where its space and communications unit is the largest private
employer.</TE>
<TE>   Net income fell nearly 43% to $372 million, or 46 cents a share,
from $650 million, or 80 cents, a year earlier. Revenue fell 7% to
$12.7 billion.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   World Series to Be a Windfall for Two Cities</TE>
<TE>   With two California teams -- the Anaheim Angels and San Francisco
Giants -- playing in the World Series, state and local officials are
counting on an economic lift from the Fall Classic, which began
Saturday in Orange County.</TE>
<TE>   In terms of an immediate windfall, economic development experts
say San Francisco and Anaheim each can expect to take in about $10
million a day from the surge of visitors. That's nothing compared
with what the Super Bowl -- which is played on neutral turf and thus
is guaranteed to fill hotel rooms -- brings in: about $250 million.
Nor does it compare with the Rose Bowl on New Year's Day, which
showers the local economy with $200 million annually.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Sides Blame Each Other in Ports' Ship Backup</TE>
<TE>   Despite a crush of activity at major West Coast ports from Long
Beach to Seattle, shipping lines said there has been little progress
in breaking the logjam of ships that built up during a 10-day
employer lockout.</TE>
<TE>   Shipping companies and unionized dockworkers continued to blame
each other as the number of vessels outside the ports of Los Angeles
and Long Beach held steady.</TE>
<TE>   In San Francisco, a federal judge officially extended the
injunction that forced ports to reopen Oct. 9 for 80 days under the
rarely used Taft-Hartley Act. U.S. District Judge William Alsup noted
that the injunction not only prohibits employers from closing the
ports, it also bans workers from staging slowdowns.</TE>
<TE>   The Pacific Maritime Assn., which represents shipping lines and
terminal operators, claims the union has been deliberately slowing
the work pace by failing to dispatch sufficient numbers of skilled
workers to job sites.</TE>
<TE>   But the International Longshore and Warehouse Union claims
shipping companies and terminal operators have been sabotaging
efforts to clear the ports by ordering insufficient labor. They also
said logistical problems, such as a shortage of truck chassis to
carry containers, make the dig-out difficult.</TE>

<TE>   Glitch Blocks Access to CalFed Accounts</TE>
<TE>   California Federal Bank left more than 9,000 customers stranded
without access to their cash last weekend after their ATM/Visa check
cards were mistakenly canceled.</TE>
<TE>   In anticipation of its pending takeover by Citigroup Inc., CalFed
officials decided to change account numbers and issue new cards for
about 13,000 CalFed customers whose account numbers overlapped with
accounts at Citigroup, the nation's largest bank.</TE>
<TE>   But because of a "programming glitch," cards were deactivated Oct.
11 for about 9,000 customers, said a spokeswoman for San
Francisco-based Golden State Bancorp, parent of California Federal
Bank. The company apologized and accounts were reactivated.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   AOL, MSN Face Off With Web Software</TE>
<TE>   AOL Time Warner Inc.'s America Online launched software package
AOL 8.0 with a concert by Alanis Morissette, but it might as well
have started with a battle call as Microsoft Corp. gears up for
another push against the online giant.</TE>
<TE>   Through a combination of user-friendly technology and clever
marketing, America Online has created a virtual community that rivals
have found tough to dent. AOL boasts more than 26 million U.S.
subscribers, compared with about 8 million for Microsoft's MSN
service.</TE>
<TE>   Microsoft plans to spend $300 million to support its launch
Thursday of its Internet service software, MSN 8. Much of Microsoft's
push will be aimed at getting AOL customers to switch.</TE>

<HD>Xbox Elicits Holiday Ho-Hums</HD>
<DH>So far, many aren't impressed by the lineup of titles for
Microsoft's video game console.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Alex Pham</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Robin Luckey wants his money back.</LD>
<LD>   The Seattle programmer was among the first to buy Microsoft
Corp.'s Xbox video game console when it launched last fall. Now the
machine gathers dust beneath his television. And none of the games
that Microsoft plans to offer this holiday motivates Luckey to fire
up his Xbox.</LD>
<LD>   "I'd rather have my $300 back," he said.</LD>
<TE>   A year after Microsoft introduced its console, game critics and
industry analysts are decidedly underwhelmed by the holiday lineup of
Xbox exclusive titles -- games that can be played only on Xbox and
not on rival consoles. Exclusives are important because they help
sway consumers to buy the Xbox over competing machines.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously, they don't have the killer [game] that makes people
sit up and take notice," said Shawn Milne, an analyst at SoundView
Technology Group in San Francisco. "You need exclusives to drive
console sales."</TE>
<TE>   The stakes are high. Consumers spend about as much on games as
they do at movie theater box offices -- about $9 billion on hardware
and software combined in North America. Microsoft spent hundreds of
millions developing Xbox, its first entry into the competitive and
fickle console market.</TE>
<TE>   For manufacturers such as Microsoft, Nintendo Co. and Sony Corp.,
consoles are the high-tech versions of razors. They rarely make much
money. But, like blades, the games for the consoles can be extremely
profitable because manufacturers get a licensing fee from every
title, regardless of who publishes it.</TE>
<TE>   The next two holiday seasons represent the sweet spot for the
industry, a time of expected double-digit growth. Sales of console
games alone topped $4.5 billion in the U.S. last year. Analysts
estimate that figure to grow between 20% and 25% this year and about
30% next year.</TE>
<TE>   Shelf Space at Risk</TE>
<TE>   But the growth won't be evenly distributed among console
manufacturers. Those that don't attract buyers will quickly lose
precious shelf space in stores such as Wal-Mart, Best Buy and
Electronics Boutique.</TE>
<TE>   Games sell consoles and games live or die on word of mouth. Last
year, when Xbox debuted, the exclusive "Halo" took off. But little
else did. A second Christmas with a lackluster lineup could relegate
Microsoft to the growing pile of failed console manufacturers. Sega
Corp., Atari Inc. and 3DO Co. have quit making consoles in the last
decade after losing millions.</TE>
<TE>   Few believe that Microsoft will surrender easily, but "the games
that differentiate this machine just aren't there," said Geoff
Keighley, an editor for GameSpot, a game news Web site.</TE>
<TE>   There is plenty of buzz around "Grand Theft Auto: Vice City" for
Sony's PlayStation 2 and, to a lesser extent, around "Metroid Prime"
for Nintendo's GameCube. But there's considerably less talk about
"Splinter Cell," "Mech Assault" and "Blinx: The Timesweeper" -- three
marquee titles for Xbox this holiday.</TE>
<TE>   Ed Fries, Microsoft's vice president for games, said he isn't
bothered by the naysaying.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm a little used to that," Fries said. "People said 'Halo'
wasn't going to do well for various reasons, but it sold 2 million
copies. When you have new, fresh titles, you'll always have
skepticism."</TE>
<TE>   Critics, however, point out that they see nothing in this year's
lineup that comes close to "Halo," Microsoft's exclusive bestseller
last holiday. To be sure, people who have played "Splinter Cell" and
"Mech Assault" say both are solid games. They're just not garnering
the same consumer anticipation as "Vice City."</TE>
<TE>   That Xbox has few exclusive titles that sparkle suggests Microsoft
is having trouble persuading top game publishers such as Redwood
City, Calif.-based Electronic Arts Inc. to devote significant
resources to developing games just for Xbox, analysts said.
Publishers privately acknowledge that's the case.</TE>
<TE>   It's a function of pure economics. As a quick rule of thumb,
publishers allocate their game development dollars according to the
market share for each console. Microsoft is in a distant second, with
a quarter as many Xboxes in U.S. living rooms as Sony has PlayStation
2s.</TE>
<TE>   By the end of August, Sony had sold 10.8 million PS2s in North
America, accounting for about 69% of the U.S. console market,
according to estimates from game publishers. Xbox's 2.7 million boxes
represent 17% of the market. Nintendo follows with 2.2 million
GameCubes, a 14% share.</TE>
<TE>   "We have an excellent relationship with Microsoft," said a senior
executive at a major publisher. "But ultimately, it's all about the
installed base."</TE>
<TE>   Exclusive Offerings</TE>
<TE>   Publishers would prefer to put their games out on all three
platforms because the cost of transferring a game to multiple
consoles is insignificant. But hardware companies dangle financial
incentives in front of publishers to snag exclusives.</TE>
<TE>   Microsoft budgets these incentives directly into its cost of doing
business in an "opportunity fund." The company, for example, can
offer to help pay marketing or development costs in exchange for
exclusive content or exclusive time windows during which only Xbox
versions are sold. Microsoft also gains leverage by discounting the
$7 licensing fee it charges publishers for each copy of an Xbox game
sold.</TE>
<TE>   But Sony plays that game too. The company this year announced that
Take-Two Interactive Software Inc.'s hugely popular "Grand Theft
Auto" franchise would be exclusive to PS2 until 2004. Although
Nintendo also uses incentives to lure exclusive games, it relies less
on them because the Japanese company already owns strong studios that
can crank out games for its platforms.</TE>
<TE>   Such one-upmanship is expensive. Microsoft last month purchased
Rare Ltd., a British developer, for $375 million. Xbox games from
Rare, however, won't be out until next year -- too late for this
holiday season.</TE>
<TE>   If this year's crop of games appears lackluster, next year is
shaping up nicely for Microsoft. By generously sprinkling incentives
from its "opportunity fund," Microsoft will reap exclusive titles
such as "Panzer Dragoon: Orta" from Sega; "Halo 2" from a studio it
purchased two years ago; "Perfect Dark" from Rare; and "Doom 3" from
Id Software Inc.</TE>
<TE>   "Part of my job is to encourage people to develop for us," Fries
said. "But I'm not going to bribe someone to build something
exclusive on my platform. I want to spend it on titles we think are
important. There are some publishers who are inclined to develop for
all platforms, and the only way you can change their mind is to dump
a huge pile of money on them. I guess you can do that if you want to,
but I'd rather see that money go to creating new content."</TE>
<TE>   That still leaves the next few months to worry about, when about
half of the industry's annual sales are rung up.</TE>
<TE>   "Even if they have great games, it's going to be very hard for
Microsoft to compete," said Michael Pachter, an analyst with Wedbush
Morgan Securities in Los Angeles. "Sony's got a huge head start. If
Microsoft has trouble getting people lined up this year, by 2003
they'll be three years behind. By then, it'll be awfully tough for
them to convince retailers to give them enough shelf space. If I'm
Wal-Mart, I'm going to want to concentrate on the top sellers."</TE>

<HD>Swiss Army Adapts to Changing Times</HD>
<DH>Massive mountain fortresses are considered obsolete, at
least for now. Force is shrinking and modernizing.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Clare Nullis</AU>
<BD>Associated Press Writer</BD>
<DL>ST. MAURICE, Switzerland</DL>
<LD>High on the mountainside, hidden behind green foliage and an
unobtrusive door, lies a fascinating glimpse into the Swiss army's
past secrets and its future face.</LD>
<LD>   It's based on an old Swiss military doctrine: In time of war, head
for the hills.</LD>
<LD>   It is here that Switzerland's engineering wizardry and a stubborn
survival instinct combined to produce Dailly fortress -- one of its
biggest underground defense facilities, with artillery emplacements,
troop quarters, and even hospital and bakery facilities, all linked
by a labyrinth of tunnels stretching for dozens of miles.</LD>
<TE>   Now it lies silent and empty as the army moves to modernize itself
to meet 21st-century threats.</TE>
<TE>   Landlocked Switzerland hasn't been invaded for 204 years and has
always relied on its mountains as the backbone of its defense.
Fearing that Hitler and Mussolini wanted to carve up the country,
Switzerland built its network of 20,000 Alpine hide-outs and
fortified bunkers between 1940 and 1943 and continued to modernize it
until well into the 1970s.</TE>
<TE>   The two fascist leaders stayed away, although critics say
Switzerland's service as banker and supplier to the Nazi war machine
also helped.</TE>
<TE>   For decades, Dailly was the jewel in the crown of the Alpine
Redoubt.</TE>
<TE>   "The fortress used to be classed as top secret and was meant to
block access to potential enemies," defense minister Samuel Schmid
explained to a group of foreign journalists allowed a rare tour of
the fort.</TE>
<TE>   "But history is in constant movement, like Swiss watches. Today,
conditions are changing and our army has to adapt." As he spoke, a
batch of young recruits practiced on a target range beside a herd of
peacefully grazing cows.</TE>
<TE>   Risk analysis by the military says the biggest threat to
Switzerland is conflicts beyond Europe and their attendant economic
disruption. Next come natural catastrophes, conflicts within Europe
and terrorism. A direct military attack on Switzerland comes last.</TE>
<TE>   So Schmid has launched what he describes as the most sweeping
reforms since the modern Swiss confederation and its militia army
were established 154 years ago.</TE>
<TE>   The central plank of the program is to cut the number of men in
active service and the reserves from 350,000 to 220,000 by
lengthening basic military training from 17 to 21 weeks and limiting
reserve duty to men under 30 instead of 40.</TE>
<TE>   Thus, goes the reasoning, recruits will complete active duty at a
relatively young age and come away with the skills to make them
Value-Added Citizens, in the words of armed forces commander Jacques
Dousse.</TE>
<TE>   The defense ministry also wants salaried instructors instead of
amateurs, but insists that this doesn't mean the army is going
professional.</TE>
<TE>   "The militia army is so anchored in the Swiss collective mentality
that I don't think Switzerland would be able to enter fully the
professional era," Dousse said.</TE>
<TE>   He also doubts that enough Swiss men would forgo high salaries in
business to sign up to defend their country.</TE>
<TE>   The reforms are unlikely to cut the $2.9-billion defense budget
because Schmid wants to spend more on sophisticated weapons and
communications.</TE>
<TE>   A prominent victim of the high-tech push is Switzerland's fabled
bicycle brigade, which will be disbanded, much to the regret of
traditionalists who say the cycling troops are fast, efficient and
cheap.</TE>
<TE>   But there are no plans to tamper with the militia tradition that
allows all men to keep their service weapon in a closet at home.</TE>
<TE>   Schmid estimates that about 500,000 army-issue weapons are in
private hands and that up to 40% of reservists choose to keep their
weapons upon retirement from active duty.</TE>
<TE>   "And we don't want to change that," he said, mindful of the
political clout of the half-million-strong rifle association,
Switzerland's biggest professional sporting organization.</TE>
<TE>   So strong is the defense mentality that all modern Swiss apartment
buildings and houses have fallout shelters -- a regulation that was
widely ridiculed until the Sept. 11 attacks on the United States and
the anthrax scare.</TE>
<TE>   But only now, as it comes to be seen as obsolete, is the scope and
sophistication of the military's defense network coming to light.
With fort entrances carefully hidden by trees or rustic chalets, most
Swiss were unaware they were there.</TE>
<TE>   Nothing on the hairpin bends on the narrow road up from St.
Maurice suggests the existence of the mighty Dailly fort and its web
of immaculately preserved tunnels and caverns.</TE>
<TE>   A 55-year-old cable car, which transported soldiers and supplies
through the heart of the mountain, takes the visitor on a
stomach-churning, 1,180-foot climb to a chamber that served as the
ammunition production line for the army's fearsome 150-mm cannon.
Nearby is a vast barracks that could sleep more than 600 soldiers.</TE>
<TE>   Dailly was constructed to help defend St. Maurice, regarded as the
doorway from the southern Valais mountains to Switzerland's
productive plains. The two other main fortresses were on the central
St. Gotthard Pass and Sargans, in the east.</TE>
<TE>   Like most other Swiss forts, it was closed as a result of army
reforms in 1995 that left just 5,000 smaller mountain hide-outs with
more sophisticated equipment in use.</TE>
<TE>   There are moves to turn some decommissioned facilities into
tourist attractions, even hotels. But the fate of Dailly remains
unclear because of its huge size and maintenance costs.</TE>
<TE>   "Most of the fortresses are closed now," said Col. Alexandre
Morrisod, who used to command Dailly. "But history is cyclical and
maybe one day they will become important again."</TE>

<BD>Associated Press Writer</BD>
<DL>GULU, Uganda</DL>
<LD>Head bowed, Cosmos Onek fiddles with a whistle as he mumbles the
story of how he took a bayonet and hacked off the ears and lips of a
woman because she was working in her field on a Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   That was two years ago, when he was 16 and in the Lord's
Resistance Army, a rebel movement whose fight is guided by a jumble
of Christianity, traditional religion and mythology -- and fueled by
resentment.</LD>
<LD>   Both the brutalized woman and the youth, now 18 and undergoing
rehabilitation, are victims of an insurgency that has bloodied
northern Uganda for 16 years, killing thousands and forcing tens of
thousands to live in bleak camps.</LD>
<TE>   Onek is one of an estimated 14,000 children who have been abducted
by the rebels to be porters, fighters and sex slaves. In June, he
escaped after four years with the group.</TE>
<TE>   He looks forward to returning to his family, once counselors
decide that he can handle normal life, but he worries that the rebels
will just grab him again. "At the moment, I'm not feeling anything
.... I just want to go back to school," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The rebels, led by Joseph Kony, have intensified their attacks
since March, when the Ugandan army sent soldiers and tanks into
neighboring Sudan to attack rebel bases in an effort to force them to
agree to a government-dictated cease-fire.</TE>
<TE>   While not directly linked to the 19-year civil war in southern
Sudan or the four-year conflict in neighboring Congo, the insurgency
in northern Uganda is fueled by the seemingly endless supply of small
arms and ammunition that pour into this corner of Africa.</TE>
<TE>   The insurgency has waxed and waned, depending on relations between
Uganda and its neighbors. The Ugandan army offensive was undertaken
with the blessing of the Sudanese government, perhaps because of
Sudan's desire to polish its anti-terrorist credentials.</TE>
<TE>   Sudan's withdrawal of support for the Ugandan rebels has
considerably weakened the Lord's Resistance Army, Ugandan military
officials contend.</TE>
<TE>   "Militarily, we are capable of defeating Kony because he no longer
has support from Sudan," said an army spokesman, Lt. Paddy Ankunda.
"When a bullet is shot, he cannot replace it, and that is how people
lose wars."</TE>
<TE>   Rebel leaders insist that they have the means to carry on, and
they contend that they have changed their brutal ways.</TE>
<TE>   In a rare interview, the rebels' chief of staff, Tolbert Yardin
Nyeko, said the group has remodeled itself and put a stop to
abductions and other atrocities that he blamed on low-level
commanders.</TE>
<TE>   He said the movement also is now willing to talk peace.</TE>
<TE>   "If it's guaranteed that peace talks are going to work, we will
come out willingly," Nyeko said. "We have seen the war has taken
long, and we have seen the suffering of the people of the soil, our
own people."</TE>
<TE>   Nyeko, 38, said he was recruited by the rebel movement while still
in high school and joined because he didn't trust President Yoweri
Museveni, who rose to power in 1986 after leading a guerrilla war
against President Milton Obote.</TE>
<TE>   The Lord's Resistance Army rose from the remnants of a revolt by
Acholi soldiers after Museveni, a southerner, won power. Most of the
rebels had given up by mid-1988, but those who kept up the fight
coalesced into the Lord's Resistance Army.</TE>
<TE>   Kony, one of the original members, is the son of a Roman Catholic
religion teacher and claims to posses spiritual powers. Originally,
the group proclaimed that it would run the country according to the
Ten Commandants. Now, it would be satisfied with equal treatment.</TE>
<TE>   Despite talk of a cease-fire, bloodshed continues. The army says
abductions are on the increase; the rebels say the government is not
sincere about peace.</TE>
<TE>   People in Gulu, a town surrounded by lush, green savanna, have
seen too much conflict to be optimistic. No one pays attention to
1960s-vintage T-55 tanks rumbling through the streets except for the
barefoot kids chasing after them.</TE>
<TE>   "People here have lost hope because the government is not helping
the people with all its heart," said Richard Komakech, a shopkeeper.</TE>
<TE>   "The government is now hoping for a military solution, which we
see as not viable."</TE>
<TE>   Most of the 500,000 people in the Gulu district are Acholi, a
warrior tribe devoted to its long-horned cattle. But herds have been
decimated during the war, and about three-fourths of the people have
been forced into squalid camps that the government claims will
protect them from rebel attacks.</TE>
<TE>   People regularly call the army-run Radio Freedom in Gulu to
complain about the army and Museveni, who won less than 12% of the
vote in the Gulu district in last year's presidential election. The
callers want to know why the government has taken so long to rein in
the rebels. Museveni blames the failure to crush the rebels on a lack
of resources. He says international donors, who provide more than
half the government's operating budget, discourage any increase in
defense spending.</TE>
<TE>   He also defends the army's offensive in Sudan, Operation Iron
Fist, saying it resulted in 450 rebel deaths and 470 rescued
abductees. The army lost only 134 men, he said recently .</TE>
<TE>   Nyeko, the rebels' chief of staff, put government losses at
"hundreds and hundreds" and those of the rebels at "below 500."</TE>
<TE>   Nyeko refused to say how many fighters the rebels have. But a
former senior rebel, who left the group in August, put the number at
2,500, most of them under 16.</TE>

<HD>3 Die, 23 Hurt as a Bomb Damages Philippine Bus</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>QUEZON CITY, Philippines</DL>
<LD>A bomb tore through a passenger bus in this Manila suburb Friday
night, killing at least three people and injuring 23, police said.</LD>
<LD>   There were no immediate suspects or claims of responsibility for
the latest in a series of bombings this month in a nation where
U.S.-trained troops are battling a Muslim rebel group.</LD>
<LD>   The blast in the blue Golden Highway company bus ripped off its
roof and part of its sides and sent debris flying 20 to 30 yards. The
passenger who brought the explosive aboard the bus was believed to be
among the dead, but it was unclear whether the blast was intended as
a suicide attack.</LD>
<TE>   The explosion came a day after two deadly bombings in the southern
Philippines and hours after a grenade blast in the capital's
financial district.</TE>
<TE>   Officials said Abu Sayyaf, which the Philippine and U.S.
governments have linked to the Al Qaeda terrorist network, was the
most likely suspect for Thursday's bombings in Zamboanga, which
killed seven people and injured more than 150.</TE>
<TE>   Abu Sayyaf recently threatened attacks in retaliation for an
ongoing military offensive against the group and has been blamed for
an Oct. 2 bombing in Zamboanga that killed four people, including an
American Green Beret.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier Friday, President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo visited the
Zamboanga bombing sites and urged her people to help fight
terrorists. She said troops and police had identified the suspects
and were looking for them.</TE>

<LD>Yeung Ching-yee lifts four strings between two chubby fingers, and an
ancient Chinese lady half his height springs to life.</LD>
<LD>   Clad in a pink embroidered dress with blue collars, the figure
turns her head demurely as she lifts her right elbow, revealing
elegant fingers beneath long white sleeves. A second later, she
gracefully sways and walks in small steps.</LD>
<LD>   Yeung's dexterous manipulation makes puppetry look easy. It isn't.</LD>
<TE>   "This is so complicated!" exclaim several of his students,
struggling with the strings of their own puppets.</TE>
<TE>   Yeung had to flee Mao Tse-Tung's Cultural Revolution in mainland
China to practice his life's calling. Now he's one of the last puppet
masters in Hong Kong who have watched their once-popular art decline
in the era of discos, television, movies and computer games.</TE>
<TE>   Yeung says he runs the territory's only remaining Chinese
marionette troupe -- the Hong Kong Sky Bird Puppet Art Group.</TE>
<TE>   Hoping to raise appreciation of the art before it's too late, last
year he published a 536-page book on traditional puppet plays, and
for several years he's been teaching classes in puppetry.</TE>
<TE>   When Yeung, 53, grew up in the coastal city of Quanzhou, home to
China's best puppet troupes, the art seemed to have a bright future.</TE>
<TE>   At age 13, he embarked on a five-year apprenticeship, dreaming
that one day he, like other veteran puppeteers, would be able to
travel outside China to perform overseas.</TE>
<TE>   Yeung says a vivid imagination is even more important than
physical skill in nimbly manipulating a puppet's strings to make it
look lifelike.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to get inside the head of the characters and imagine how
exactly they'll move to express their emotions," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Each puppet has at least 17 strings to move limbs and other parts
of the bodies. Some have more than 30. "It's not easy," Yeung said.</TE>
<TE>   Puppet art in China originated in the Han dynasty, which ruled
from 206 B.C. to A.D. 220. The shows usually feature swordsmanship or
historical stories.</TE>
<TE>   Quanzhou's puppet masters are renowned for crisp singing voices as
well as creating marionettes with meticulously carved heads and
delicate, colorful costumes -- strongly reminiscent of traditional
Chinese opera.</TE>
<TE>   Yeung says he once had a powerful singing voice that could carry
the show, but he lost much of it in middle age. Now, he uses tape
recordings during his performances.</TE>
<TE>   As a young puppeteer, he was in the right place but in the wrong
time. The Cultural Revolution began in 1966, just as his
apprenticeship was ending, and militant young people organized as Red
Guards set out to destroy old customs, arts and culture.</TE>
<TE>   Yeung was sent to work on farms and forced to abandon his beloved
craft. He escaped in 1974 and settled in Hong Kong, then a British
colony.</TE>
<TE>   Puppet shows were a popular form of entertainment in the territory
in the 1970s. Yeung was good enough to make a living at it back then,
but by the 1980s, interest began to fade and he could no longer
scrape by on puppet shows alone.</TE>
<TE>   He took a full-time job as a civil servant, leaving his puppet
performances to his leisure time. He also began teaching puppet
courses and is still at it after retiring from the government.</TE>
<TE>   His classes attract all types: Young and old, Chinese opera
lovers, even a French-Chinese who plays African drums.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm so lucky because it's very difficult to find a good puppet
master and I've found one," said the 21-year-old drummer, Chou
Min-wan, who's undeterred by being unable to understand Cantonese. He
must rely on fellow classmates to translate Yeung's words.</TE>
<TE>   Chou says he's been mesmerized by Chinese marionettes ever since
he saw a mainland troupe perform in France, so he enrolled in Yeung's
class after arriving in Hong Kong in June for an extended visit.</TE>
<TE>   Chou's musical background may help. He is able to walk his puppet
more fluidly than some of the other students.</TE>
<TE>   "It's difficult learning to coordinate all a puppet's movements
smoothly," said Sandy Hui, a 25-year-old accountant, amateur dancer
and actress.</TE>
<TE>   Still, she enjoys puppetry because it's a unique genre of
performing art that combines Chinese history, operas, masks and
embroidery.</TE>
<TE>   "It's special because you express yourself through your fingers
and not your body," Hui said.</TE>
<TE>   Yeung's wife, Choi Ling-ling, helps teach the course. She says
most students quit because of the difficulty. "It takes a lot to
achieve mastery," she said.</TE>

<HD>Forgotten Italian May Be Phone's Inventor</HD>
<DH>Although the U.S. House declared that Bell ripped off
Antonio Meucci, his countrymen have done little to champion his
cause.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Frances D'emilio</AU>
<BD>Associated Press Writer</BD>
<DL>ROME</DL>
<LD>Italians are a people who love to talk, so they find it natural that
the inventor of the telephone was one of their own.</LD>
<LD>   What, you say, Alexander Graham Bell was Italian?</LD>
<LD>   No. But, for Italians, the Scotsman is not the inventor of the
telephone. Italian textbooks have long taught that Antonio Meucci, a
Florentine immigrant in New York, invented the phone while Bell got
the credit.</LD>
<TE>   Now, nearly 113 years after Meucci died a virtual pauper on New
York City's Staten Island, there's some vindication for him.</TE>
<TE>   In June, the U.S. House of Representatives declared that,
essentially, the Italian was ripped off by the Scotsman.</TE>
<TE>   The congressional resolution was sponsored by Rep. Vito Fossella,
an Italian American from Staten Island, and backed by Italian
American organizations.</TE>
<TE>   In the ponderous language of government, the declaration sums up
Meucci's hard-luck history:</TE>
<TE>   "Whereas Meucci never learned English well enough to navigate the
complex American business community ... whereas Meucci was unable to
raise sufficient funds to pay his way through the patent application
process ... whereas on Jan. 13, 1887, the government of the United
States moved to annul the patent issued to Bell on the grounds of
fraud and misrepresentation ... whereas Meucci died in October 1889,
the Bell patent expired in January 1893, and the case was
discontinued as moot ...."</TE>
<TE>   Given all the bad breaks, lawmakers concluded that "the life and
achievements of Antonio Meucci should be recognized, and his work in
the invention of the telephone should be acknowledged."</TE>
<TE>   Of course, there was dissent. A little later in June, Canada's
House of Commons passed a motion recognizing Bell as the telephone's
inventor. Bell, who had come to Ontario with his parents while a
young man, died in 1922 in Nova Scotia, where he had a summer home.</TE>
<TE>   Then, the flurry of patriotic coverage in Italy was over.</TE>
<TE>   The truth is, textbooks and encyclopedias aside, Italians have
done little to champion the cause of Meucci, who emptied out his
heart and his pockets for his countrymen.</TE>
<TE>   Take a look at how Rome's Historic Museum of Post and
Telecommunications treats this native son who didn't make good.</TE>
<TE>   One recent rainy morning, the steps of a sole visitor echoed
noisily through room after room, past the bust of Guglielmo Marconi,
the Italian who won a Nobel for physics for his pioneering work in
wireless telegraphy, past the telephone used by dictator Benito
Mussolini in his headquarters in the heart of Rome.</TE>
<TE>   The Meucci display was easy to miss. Among the items were
reproductions of two primitive wooden telephone models made by the
inventor, two letters he wrote from Staten Island lamenting that he
was reduced to living on charity, and a cheap-looking ceramic plaque
from one Carlo Meucci complaining how badly life treated his father.</TE>
<TE>   By the time the visitor left, the exhibition was even thinner. It
was pointed out to museum officials that Meucci was thought to have
had no recognized offspring, and a call to the museum's recently
retired director got the word that there has been a rash of Meucci
heir impostors. The plaque was removed.</TE>
<TE>   The museum's new director, Barbara Desimio, said that although
"local pride" largely figures in Italians giving credit to Meucci,
the record shows that Italy, in practice, championed Bell.</TE>
<TE>   In 1878, when the telephone made its first appearance in Italy, in
the presence of the royal family, two Bell receivers were used. A
year earlier, two Italian brothers from Milan, using Bell's patent,
produced Italy's first telephone device.</TE>
<TE>   "Even in Italy, as in the rest of the civilized world, the name
Bell became famous, while the name of an Italian, Antonio Meucci,
remained unknown," Desimio said.</TE>
<TE>   So much for a man who, in his cottage on Staten Island, hosted
Italian patriots like Giuseppe Garibaldi as they struggled to make a
nation out of a homeland that for centuries was cut up into fiefdoms
by popes and warlords.</TE>
<TE>   Meucci was largely forgotten here until Marconi, during
Mussolini's Fascist drive to glorify Italian achievements, battled to
win some glory for his compatriot.</TE>
<TE>   Marconi didn't make much headway, judging by a 1954 letter in the
museum's files. The letter advises another museum in Italy to be
cautious in putting together any exhibition on Meucci because what
was known about the patent battle was "still obscure" and "the Bell
Co. could raise objections" if the show wasn't properly documented.</TE>
<TE>   A little over a decade ago, an electronics engineer in Turin,
about to retire from Italy's state telecommunications company, took
up the challenge of properly documenting Meucci's story.</TE>
<TE>   Basilio Catania recalled how he was immediately struck by
something as he started reading what he could find on Meucci.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone's judgments of him were diametrically opposed," Catania
said in a telephone interview from his home.</TE>
<TE>   "Some said he was a charlatan, that he did little more than
duplicate the old kids' game of stringing two boxes together. Others
said he was a genius who was ripped off."</TE>
<TE>   Meucci's troubles began young. A chemistry student, he invented a
powerful propeller for fireworks and when one of the rockets
propelled by his device did some damage at a celebration for a
Florentine duchess, he ended up in court. Later, he was jailed for
his activities to free Italy from foreign rulers.</TE>
<TE>   When he was offered a job in Cuba as engineer for an Italian opera
company, Meucci accepted, taking with him his seamstress wife,
Esther. They had met while working at a Florence theater that still
uses another of Meucci's devices -- an acoustic pipe that allow
stagehands to transmit orders from backstage to above the stage.</TE>
<TE>   In Cuba, the couple were well-to-do by today's standards, Catania
said, and Meucci was able to spend a lot of money on his hobby --
inventing.</TE>
<TE>   Among his eclectic inventions: a filter similar to those used in
today's coffee machines, and patented, bubbly, vitamin-rich fruit
drinks.</TE>
<TE>   Meucci was curious if electricity could be used in medicine. When
a man who worked for him fell ill, Meucci put one end of a copper
wire in the man's mouth and delivered an electrical charge from the
other end. The poor man's scream was transmitted through the wire,
and Meucci was set on his quest to use electricity to transmit the
human voice.</TE>
<TE>   New York awaited.</TE>
<TE>   "Meucci thought he could better exploit his genius there," Catania
said. "Unfortunately, he found something there he didn't expect:
hundreds of Italians -- aristocrats, generals -- who needed help" in
exile as they mapped strategy in their drive to unite Italy.</TE>
<TE>   Next to his Staten Island home, where he settled in 1850, Meucci
opened a factory to produce a new kind of candle he invented, and
gave the exiles jobs. But the candle business fizzled in the face of
competition, and by 1861, Meucci was forced to sell off personal
possessions.</TE>
<TE>   In 1870, Meucci was badly burned in a fire aboard a ferry, spent
three months in a hospital and went on welfare, receiving $15 a week.</TE>
<TE>   Meucci applied for the cheaper, simple warning about his work in
telephony instead of a full patent after his fellow Italians rebuffed
his bid for a $200 loan to take out a patent. Three years later, he
couldn't even come up with the $10 to renew the caveat.</TE>
<TE>   After Meucci heard that Bell took out a patent on the telephone in
1876, he wrote his lawyer and started a newspaper campaign to claim
that he was first. In 1887, the U.S. government went to bat for
Meucci, but the Italian died two years later and he never had his day
in court.</TE>
<TE>   In New Jersey, a spokeswoman for AT&amp;T Corp., the descendant of the
Bell Telephone Co., is staying out of the fray.</TE>

<HD>Deaths From Fires Skyrocketing in Russia</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Sarah Karush</AU>
<BD>Associated Press Writer</BD>
<DL>MOSCOW</DL>
<LD>At a training center of the Russian fire service, intricate homemade
models depict some of the worst emergencies a firefighter could
imagine: an inferno raging at a soccer stadium, a blaze spreading
through the aisles of a crowded theater, even a nuclear mushroom
cloud hovering ominously over residential high-rises.</LD>
<LD>   But Russia's real fire emergency is far more insidious and goes
largely unnoticed. Fifty people a day -- 18,000 a year -- die in
fires caused mostly by people smoking while drinking or others who
are just plain careless.</LD>
<LD>   That's four times the number of fire deaths in the United States,
which has twice the population. The contrast is even more stark with
the United Kingdom, which sees 600 fire deaths a year, or one per
100,000 people -- compared to 12.5 per 100,000 in Russia.</LD>
<TE>   Experts say fire fatalities have skyrocketed since the end of the
Soviet Union because of lower public vigilance, a disregard for
safety standards and a dramatic rise in the number of homeless
desperate to keep warm during icy winters. These factors -- and the
country's many stove-heated wooden houses in isolated villages --
lead to some of the world's grimmest fire statistics.</TE>
<TE>   "It's mostly people in a drunk state with a cigarette butt," said
Didivan Chichinadze, head of the training center and adjacent fire
department in southern Moscow.</TE>
<TE>   In summer, the culprit is often the upstairs neighbor, casually
enjoying a cigarette on his balcony, Chichinadze said. When he
finishes his smoke, he throws the still-lighted butt to the street
below. But it falls on another balcony, where the downstairs neighbor
keeps extra furniture, paint and other flammable substances, which
ignite.</TE>
<TE>   According to the Moscow fire department, 137 of the 226 fire
deaths in the capital in the first half of this year were caused by
smoking. Alcohol also seems to have played a role: 142 of the victims
were drunk.</TE>
<TE>   The homeless, whose numbers have swelled over the last decade,
start fires in abandoned buildings and the basements of apartment
houses.</TE>
<TE>   "We conduct propaganda fairly actively," said Vladimir Rodin,
Moscow's fire chief, frustration creeping into his voice. "But these
people don't read the papers or listen to the radio or watch TV."</TE>
<TE>   In the countryside, one spark can ignite an inferno. "The stations
are far apart, and those wooden houses are like candles," Chichinadze
said.</TE>
<TE>   Russia wasn't always a tinderbox.</TE>
<TE>   A few decades ago, it was a model of fire safety, said Sergei
Lupanov, head of the statistics department at the State Fire
Service's research center. In 1965, there were one-tenth the fire
fatalities of today. In that year, 2,500 people died in all the
Soviet Union, including about 1,800 in Russia, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Few appear to be listening.</TE>
<TE>   In apartment buildings, hallways are frequently blocked with junk,
and residents install illegal metal doors in front of staircases -- a
tactic that might help keep out intruders but could also trap people
fleeing a blaze.</TE>
<TE>   Public spaces are not much safer: Theaters and concert halls often
keep all but one door locked in an effort to conserve heat and
control crowds.</TE>
<TE>   Firefighters say fines for violations are too low to make people
obey the law, and residents complain that fire inspectors are more
concerned with extorting bribes from small businesses than in
preventing fires.</TE>

<KH>LETTER FROM SINGAPORE</KH>
<HD>Multiethnic Island Seems at Odds Over Its Identity</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Regan Morris</AU>
<BD>Associated Press Writer</BD>
<DL>SINGAPORE</DL>
<LD>The first thing I noticed when I rode into downtown Singapore at 3
a.m. was the garbage-strewn field -- cans, cigarette butts, gutted
cartons of take-away food.</LD>
<LD>   Could this be Singapore? Squeaky-clean, litter-at-your-peril
Singapore, where even chewing gum is outlawed?</LD>
<LD>   The answer would come soon enough, and like much about Singapore
over the next five years, it would surprise me.</LD>
<TE>   Next morning, a more familiar Singapore lighted up under the
equatorial sun -- shiny glass skyscrapers and British colonial
beauties such as Raffles Hotel, host to Kipling and Conrad. The
street names -- English, Chinese, Tamil and Malay -- reflected the
multiethnic makeup of the city and its 4 million people.</TE>
<TE>   The city was awash in red-and-white national flags celebrating
Aug. 9, National Day. August is the only month when it is legal to
fly the Singapore flag -- and almost everyone does.</TE>
<TE>   This would be my home for the next five years, during which it
lived up to all the stereotypes of cleanliness and schoolmarmish
strictness, yet seemed forever at odds with itself over what identity
to pursue in the 21st century. Now that we have wealth, Singaporeans
seemed to be saying, what do we do with it?</TE>
<TE>   Lost among the high-rises that house most Singaporeans, my
neighborhood was one of the few remaining British colonial-era
streets of breezy black-and-white bungalows with coconut, banana and
frangipani trees in the lush, green yards.</TE>
<TE>   My yard was often the venue for all-night parties where Malays,
Chinese and Westerners would swill tequila off giant ice blocks,
cutting loose against the many rules that governed them by day -- the
ban on tabletop dancing in bars, or flying the national flag except
in August lest it be subjected to indignities, or the incessant
chimes that ring out in taxis whenever they exceed the speed limit.</TE>
<TE>   There are government-mandated campaigns -- the Clean Toilet
Campaign, the Courtesy Campaign -- and elevators in newer buildings
that have urine sensors attached to alarms.</TE>
<TE>   The aura of English suburbia mixes uneasily with the tropics.
Toads, geckos, spiders and tree frogs invade shoes and closets.
Cobras slither into gardens.</TE>
<TE>   Snakes have become increasingly common in my old neighborhood this
year because a huge construction site is destroying their habitat.
"Biopolis" is a biotechnology research center that Singapore hopes
will result in groundbreaking research using embryonic stem cells and
other futuristic technologies.</TE>
<TE>   Some grumble about sci-fi embryo doctors taking over the
neighborhood, but others dream of a cancer cure discovered in their
former backyard. Alan Colman, the Scottish scientist who cloned Dolly
the sheep, has moved to Singapore and plans to do research on
diabetes there.</TE>
<TE>   Residents joke that Singapore's scientific ambitions include
cloning the city-state's powerful founding father, Lee Kuan Yew --
who once vowed: "Even if you are going to lower me into my grave and
I feel that something is wrong, I'll get up."</TE>
<TE>   Authoritarian, outspoken and brilliant, Lee is largely responsible
for making Singapore one of Asia's greatest success stories. He
turned 79 last month and still actively wields power under the title
of senior minister.</TE>
<TE>   When Singaporeans make jokes about Lee or other political leaders,
they do it quietly. Lee and his long-ruling People's Action Party
tolerate little dissent. Two years ago, Singapore got a Speaker's
Corner modeled on London's, but speakers must first register with
police, and avoid taboo subjects like race and religion.</TE>
<TE>   Racial harmony has long been a government passion. The race riots
of the 1960s aren't forgotten. Now nerves are again on edge over the
Sept. 11 attacks, and the arrest of 31 people suspected of plotting
to blow up the U.S. Embassy and other targets.</TE>
<TE>   At a National Day rally, Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong said that he
was concerned many Muslims worldwide were becoming more extreme and
that "some Singapore Muslims too have become more rigid in the
practice of their religion."</TE>
<TE>   Singapore society is carefully engineered. Eager to boost the
middle class, the government pushes educated women to get married and
have babies.</TE>
<TE>   Every government apartment building is a microcosm of Singapore
because occupancy must by law be about 75% Chinese, 15% Malay, and
the rest Indian and other races.</TE>
<TE>   In my first year in Singapore, I lived in a government housing
block and was treated like royalty by my neighbors, who were
intrigued to have an "ang moh" -- literally redhead, but meaning any
foreigner -- in the building.</TE>
<TE>   When I had dengue fever, a painful mosquito-borne illness, the
neighbor I knew only as Auntie Lim would check on me daily to make
sure I was alive and to bring me herbal soup and star fruit -- which
I was too sick to eat. She would creep in quietly to avoid
aggravating my pounding head and bones.</TE>
<TE>   The apartment buildings are called "HDBs" for Housing Development
Board or, jokingly, Highly Dangerous Buildings, because potted plants
fall off balconies, prompting frantic witch hunts for "killer
litterbugs."</TE>
<TE>   Intensely globalized, with one of the world's busiest ports,
Singapore offers everything from Starbucks to Borders to the latest
movies.</TE>
<TE>   What it doesn't offer is full-blown democracy and freedom of
speech.</TE>
<TE>   Singapore is changing its education system to wean itself off rote
learning and to encourage more creative thinking.</TE>
<TE>   Parliament recently debated easing the law against dancing on bars
and tabletops, but one lawmaker warned that people could get hurt and
that dancing on tables could inflame jealousies and trigger brawls.</TE>
<TE>   "Some people will die," Vivian Balakrishnan warned Parliament.
"Blood will be shed for liberalizing the policy."</TE>
<TE>   No decision has been made.</TE>
<TE>   In defending firm social controls, Lee points to the wealthy,

<HD>EPA Evaluating Pollution on Columbia River</HD>
<DH>Tribe pushes for cleanup of area that was once a place to
fish, trade and socialize. For decades, the river was a sewer for
mining interests.</DH>

<DL>KETTLE FALLS, Wash.</DL>
<LD>Before the Grand Coulee Dam flattened Kettle Falls into Lake
Roosevelt, back when the upper Columbia River ran thick with salmon
each summer, tribes from across the region met here to fish, trade
and socialize.</LD>
<LD>   "This is where people met, got married, had babies, settled
disputes," said Patti Stone, water quality coordinator for the
Colville Confederated Tribes' environmental trust office. "It was the
second-largest fishery on the Columbia River."</LD>
<LD>   The huge falls are gone, and so are the days when the last salmon
chief shared pieces of the first fish caught with everyone present in
honor of abundance and friendship.</LD>
<TE>   But the salmon culture and the river remain historically and
spiritually important to the nearly 9,000-member Colville tribe.
"This is our home," Stone said.</TE>
<TE>   That's why, in 1999, the Colvilles initiated the first step of the
Superfund process by asking the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency
to study the level of contamination in the upper Columbia River,
including the lake.</TE>
<TE>   It's too early to say if Lake Roosevelt, a national recreation
area that attracts 1.5 million visitors a year, would ever be listed
for Superfund cleanup, said Monica Tonel, a site assessment manager
for the EPA in Seattle.</TE>
<TE>   But this fall, the EPA will release a draft report on pollution in
the upper Columbia River watershed that will help determine how much
more needs to be done.</TE>
<TE>   For decades, the early heavy industry of the West -- mines, mills
and smelters -- on both sides of the U.S.-Canada border dumped their
waste into the river, counting on its powerful flow to disperse and
dilute the poison.</TE>
<TE>   In 1937, the Grand Coulee Dam -- the biggest hydropower producer
in the country -- was built, and behind the mammoth dam, the Columbia
River became Lake Roosevelt, a 130-mile-long reservoir.</TE>
<TE>   "The river has always been a convenient sewer for industry. Once
the dam was built, the sewer started backing up," said Don Hurst,
president of Fulcrum, an environmental consulting firm hired by the
Colvilles.</TE>
<TE>   The shores of the lake glint in the sunlight where fragments of
glassy black slag catch and collect to form transient sparkling
beaches, a deceptively pretty testament to more than a century of
heavy-metal pollution.</TE>
<TE>   "We do have some indication that there are some problems out
there," said Flora Goldstein, the state Department of Ecology's
acting regional director in Spokane. "We're not talking immediate
health threats."</TE>
<TE>   The state Department of Health has issued advisories warning
people to limit the amount of fish they eat from the lake and to take
special precautions when preparing it.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Geological Survey and EPA data show copper, lead and zinc in
river sediment.</TE>
<TE>   While the biggest heavy-metal polluters along the river on the
U.S. side have long since shut down, six miles north of the Canadian
border, at Trail, British Columbia, Teck Cominco operates the largest
lead-zinc smelter in the world.</TE>
<TE>   "The big kahuna is Cominco, but there are other sources," said
Gary Passmore, director of the tribes' environmental trust office.</TE>
<TE>   For example, a copper and lead smelter that closed in 1922 is in
ruins near Northport's city park, six miles south of the Canadian
border. Gold mines across northeastWashington once used mercury in
processing.</TE>
<TE>   Teck Cominco acknowledges its role as an industrial polluter
historically and, like the tribes and the state, is waiting to see
the results of the EPA report.</TE>
<TE>   "It's impossible for us to commit to anything specifically," said
Mark Edwards, Teck Cominco's manager for environment, health and
safety at Trail. "We really want to stand on our record of
improvements, certainly in the last 10 years, and we are committed to
doing the right thing to follow up on our historic practices."</TE>
<TE>   From the 1920s until 1995, Cominco typically released 100,000 tons
of slag annually into the river. The smelter stopped the discharge
because of environmental concerns and the successful development of a
market for some of the slag.</TE>
<TE>   Hurst and the tribes' analysis of public records from British
Columbia show that since the dam was built, Cominco deposited what
amounts to a dump-truck full of slag into the river every 35 minutes.
The data also show that the century-old smelter's primary disposal
pipe repeatedly exceeded its British Columbia permit limits,
releasing almost 1,200 pounds of mercury between 1992 and 1996.</TE>
<TE>   "In the late '80s and the early 1990s, our mercury releases were
problematic," Edwards said. "We worked very hard to meet our
permits."</TE>
<TE>   Part of the problem was a phosphate rock that contained elevated
levels of mercury and was used to make fertilizer.</TE>
<TE>   "We tried our darnedest to control the release amount for the
phosphate rock," Edwards said. Eventually, the plant abandoned the
process and replaced it with one that requires no discharge to the
river.</TE>
<TE>   Between the mid-1970s and the 1990s, Cominco upgraded and
modernized the smelter with changes that were driven by worker and
environmental concerns, he said. In the last 10 years, Teck Cominco
has reduced the release of individual heavy metals such as mercury
and lead by 95% to 99%, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "We're certainly now well below permitted levels," Edwards said.
"The river meets very stringent water-quality objectives, objectives
that are more stringent than those that apply in Washington state or
federally in the United States."</TE>

<HD>Divorce Court Offers a Peek at Companies' Dirty Laundry</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Rachel Beck</AU>
<BD>Associated Press Writer</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Here's some advice to corporate America: If you want to make sure
proprietary information about your companies stays that way, you
better add marriage counselors to your staff.</LD>
<LD>   If what's happened in the last month is any indication, divorce
court is becoming the place to look for juicy details about the
finances of top executives and the businesses they operate.</LD>
<LD>   It goes like this: A high-powered marriage breaks up, and after
settlement talks fail, a scorned mate makes public through divorce
proceedings all sorts of company secrets -- from lavish executive pay
and perks to corporate dealings.</LD>
<TE>   Forget regulatory filings and annual reports. This is public
disclosure of a different kind, with powerful repercussions.</TE>
<TE>   "There are many adverse consequences of divorce, not just for you,
but for your company too," said Jerry Reisman, an attorney
specializing in corporate finance in Garden City, N.Y.</TE>
<TE>   The estranged wives of General Electric's former chairman, Jack
Welch, and Ernst &amp; Young's current chief executive, Richard Bobrow,
have gone to court to fight for higher-paying divorce agreements.</TE>
<TE>   These women -- Jane Welch and Jan Bobrow -- want a portion of the
big money that they say their husbands make. They say they are
entitled to keep the lifestyle they have grown accustomed to and
helped earn.</TE>
<TE>   Both women first tried to get respectable divorce settlements from
their husbands, but when that didn't happen, they chose to disclose
the magnitude of their spouses' wealth. And that's sure been
revealing, not just for readers of gossip columns and society pages,
but for investors and competitors too.</TE>
<TE>   In the Welch case, investors were surprised to learn that the
former executive was still being showered with costly perks by GE,
which even picked up his dry-cleaning tab. Details of this
extravagance weren't spelled out in the proxy statement mailed to
shareholders.</TE>
<TE>   Jane Welch's disclosures generated so much criticism of Welch and
GE that the former chairman decided to give up most of his perks and
to reimburse the company for the special services provided since his
retirement last year.</TE>
<TE>   The Bobrow case is different, with perhaps more serious
implications for the company: Ernst &amp; Young is privately held and
does not have to disclose details of its financial performance. The
divorce did that anyway.</TE>
<TE>   Judge Steve Nation of Hamilton Superior Court, outside
Indianapolis, recently issued an opinion that put a value of $5.53
billion on the accounting firm as of March 2000, when the couple
separated. According to the court papers, Bobrow's stake in the firm
was 0.22%, and this earned him $2.75 million in 2000 and $3.125
million last year.</TE>
<TE>   That's far more informative than what was in the company's annual
report. Released Oct. 14, it said only that revenues for the year
ended June 30 were $10.1 billion, up $300 million from the previous
year.</TE>
<TE>   Judge Nation awarded Jan Bobrow just over $14 million -- or 60% of
the couple's net worth as he valued it. The husband is appealing.</TE>
<TE>   What makes the revelations so damaging are their usefulness to
competitors. They now know not only the salary and other earnings of
its chief executive, but the value of the firm's client
relationships, which also was outlined in the judge's opinion. With
that insight into Ernst &amp; Young's finances, they can better map their
own strategies.</TE>
<TE>   "Accounting firms are breaking up these days and splitting off
various segments," said Shannon Pratt, managing director at business
valuation company Willamette Management Associates in Portland, Ore.</TE>
<TE>   "This would be very useful to anyone who is looking to make
acquisitions or sell."</TE>
<TE>   Other spouses of Ernst &amp; Young's thousands of employees could use
the information in their own divorce proceedings. It also might spur
some employees, now armed with details of what their chief executive
and other company partners make, to lobby for bigger paychecks for
themselves.</TE>

<HD>Suburbia Marches on Civil War Battlefield</HD>
<DH>Preservationists defend Chancellorsville, Va., where the
South won an improbable victory.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Ellen Gamerman</AU>
<BD>The Baltimore Sun</BD>
<DL>CHANCELLORSVILLE, Va.</DL>
<LD>There are no shops here. No hotels, no restaurants, no malls. Around
one of the Civil War's most historically significant battlefields,
there is no road to a frappuccino or Victoria's Secret.</LD>
<LD>   But suburbia is banging on this battlefield's door.</LD>
<LD>   A national fight over just how much development can bump up
against Civil War battlegrounds is erupting here, on the land where
Confederate Gen. Thomas "Stonewall" Jackson died, where one of
history's most famous surprise attacks occurred, where Robert E.
Lee's troops scored a stunning and improbable victory.</LD>
<TE>   Plans to build what one developer calls the new "town of
Chancellorsville" near the historic killing ground promises to bring
in roughly 6,000 residents, several big-box stores, four hotels, a
library, a skating rink, a movie theater and more.</TE>
<TE>   And with those plans, laid out on colorful story boards and
awaiting action this month by the Spotsylvania County Board of
Supervisors, comes what preservationists call the biggest threat to
any Civil War battlefield today -- to destroy the land where one of
Virginia's bloodiest battles took place.</TE>
<TE>   "We've got to fight this one to the death," said James Lighthizer,
president of the Civil War Preservation Trust, a national nonprofit
organization.</TE>
<TE>   "There's plenty of other places to put these gargantuan
developments -- not here," he added, gazing from the ridge that Union
troops fled in May 1863. He predicted an onslaught of traffic and
sprawl if the new town is approved.</TE>
<TE>   The fight to protect Chancellorsville, just west of Fredericksburg
and almost midway between Washington and Richmond, is part of a
national effort to preserve battlefield land.</TE>
<TE>   And for that there is no better testing ground than Spotsylvania
County and its environs, where 100,000 men died in four major battles
during the war: Fredericksburg, Chancellorsville, the Wilderness and
Spotsylvania Courthouse.</TE>
<TE>   Some local officials, noting that Spotsylvania is one of
Virginia's fastest-growing counties, argue that if they tiptoed
around all the land that Civil War armies fought over, none of the
property in the county would be developed.</TE>
<TE>   "Somewhere or another, an army passed through Spotsylvania County
and people died," said the county's administrator, Anthony Barrett.</TE>
<TE>   The controversial development would be built on a dairy farm up
for sale -- land adjacent to the Chancellorsville battlefield, of
which 1,600 acres are federally protected as a national military
park.</TE>
<TE>   Although combat occurred on a piece of the farm's 790 acres,
preservationists place greater value on what did not happen there:
The absence of development on the land since the Civil War has
indirectly helped preserve the battlefield's sight lines and rural
character.</TE>
<TE>   Now the county is considering rezoning the property to allow for
10 times the houses that could otherwise be built there and four
times the business development: That's 2,350 homes and 2.4 million
square feet of commercial space.</TE>
<TE>   Ray Smith, a northern Virginia developer who hopes to build the
new town, argues that if the land were so important, preservationists
would have bought it two years ago when its owner, undertaker John
Mullins, put it up for sale.</TE>
<TE>   Preservationists contend that they were not given enough time to
assemble a bid for the property, which they say carried an
$18-million price tag. Now they are trying to persuade local
officials to deny the new zoning or, better yet, persuade the federal
government to buy the land and make it part of the park.</TE>
<TE>   So far, the state government is sitting on the sidelines.</TE>
<TE>   Smith, noting that a four-lane highway already runs by the
Chancellorsville battlefield, insists that, like it or not, a tide of
development is coming.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't just take away people's property rights," argued Smith,
whose Dogwood Development Group holds an option on the property.
"This is still America. That's one of the freedoms people fought for
in that Civil War."</TE>
<TE>   The three-day Battle of Chancellorsville is known to historians
for a maneuver so bold that Winston Churchill came to study it,
military students still analyze it and Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf
called it a model for his Gulf War tactics.</TE>
<TE>   Although the North outnumbered the South more than 2-to-1 at
Chancellorsville, Stonewall Jackson, under Lee's command, gambled and
led his men on a 12-mile march along largely hidden wooded trails,
sneaking up on the North's right flank and routing the unsuspecting
Union troops.</TE>
<TE>   About 7,500 men died -- including Jackson, who was mistakenly shot
by Confederate sentries.</TE>
<TE>   Lee saw his victory at Chancellorsville as evidence of the
Confederacy's might: Two months after that battle, in what some
historians view as a fatal miscalculation, an emboldened Lee pushed
into Union territory, moving through Maryland and into Pennsylvania
only to suffer defeat at Gettysburg. The Confederacy never recovered.</TE>
<TE>   "If this development is built, it would be a tragedy for American
history," said Robert Krick, a former Park Service historian and an
authority on Chancellorsville.</TE>
<TE>   "It would enrich a few people a great deal right now and hurt a
lot more in the future."</TE>
<TE>   Preservationists worry that the battlefield will go the way of
Salem Church, a Civil War landmark that sits amid the strip malls of
nearby Fredericksburg. The church offers a view of a drugstore and
absorbs the exhaust from 10 lanes of traffic.</TE>
<TE>   There is a reason for all this commercial activity: The
Spotsylvania area is attracting new waves of commuters looking for
affordable homes and ready access to Interstate 95.</TE>
<TE>   Champions of the Chancellorsville development say the state has
plans for an inter-county highway that would run through the area
near the battlefield, making construction inevitable regardless of
the wishes of the preservationists.</TE>
<TE>   But critics say the unfunded highway project might never get
built, and Virginia's budget problems are not likely to speed up
decisions about the road's future.</TE>
<TE>   Lighthizer, a former Maryland transportation secretary, fears that
local officials will be swayed by the developer's promises of
economic growth.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a lack of sophistication -- you see that in rural counties a
lot around the country," he said. "This is not smart growth -- this
is dumb growth."</TE>
<TE>   In his Reston office, with a view of Northern Virginia sprawl from
nine floors up, Smith describes how his new village would respect
history.</TE>
<TE>   The developer said he would create a 34-acre battlefield park in
the corner of the property where fighting occurred. Cannons, statues,
maps and military plaques would be placed around the town.</TE>
<TE>   Smith contends that residents would not overload roads because all
their jobs, shops and byways would be inside the bubble of his
community -- a notion that preservationists call laughable.</TE>
<TE>   But critics recognize the allure of Smith's bottom-line argument:
The development would enhance the local tax base, attract new waves
of tourists and make the battlefield more popular than ever.</TE>
<TE>   "Who are these elitists trying to save this battlefield for if not
for Americans coming to visit?" Smith asked.</TE>

<HD>Microbes That Fed on Oil Carved Carlsbad Caverns,
Scientists Say</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Richard Benke</AU>
<BD>Associated Press Writer</BD>
<DL>ALBUQUERQUE, N.M.</DL>
<LD>The Big Room at Carlsbad Caverns, a room that could fit more than six
football fields and reach the height of a 30-story building, inspires
awe among visitors, but it's a nagging puzzle for geologists.</LD>
<LD>   For decades, visitors were told that the cave, with its gypsum
formations, was formed by the relentless drip-drip-drip of carbonic
acid eating away at the limestone.</LD>
<LD>   But where did all that rock go?</LD>
<TE>   In most caves formed that way, subterranean streams carry off the
residue. But there are no underground streams in Carlsbad Caverns.</TE>
<TE>   The story scientists had been telling tourists didn't make sense
to Carol Hill, a University of New Mexico geologist.</TE>
<TE>   "What really puzzled us was the size of it: The Big Room in
Carlsbad Caverns is the biggest cave room in North America. That's a
lot of limestone to be carried away. The room is just there, and it
doesn't go anywhere," she said.</TE>
<TE>   The answer was under their noses all along.</TE>
<TE>   An old explanation was printed on guideposts for the 500,000
annual visitors along Carlsbad Caverns' pathways: Carbonic acid was
said to have seeped down to the limestone from rain runoff, slowly
eating away all that rock.</TE>
<TE>   But as Hill discovered, this old trickle-down theory was
misleading.</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't trickle-down. It was bubble-up.</TE>
<TE>   And it wasn't just geology. It was biology and geology.</TE>
<TE>   Diana Northup, a University of New Mexico biologist who worked
with Hill, said single-cell microbes -- bacteria -- that fed on pools
of petroleum under the Carlsbad region were the real cave carvers.</TE>
<TE>   "The carbon compounds available in oil are eaten by the
micro-organisms," Northup said, "and the product they produce is
hydrogen sulfide."</TE>
<TE>   This deadly gas rises through fissures until it reaches water --
and oxygen. Hydrogen sulfide reacts chemically with oxygen to produce
sulfuric acid, which can dissolve whole stadiums of limestone.</TE>
<TE>   This process leaves clues for geologists. Large blocks of gypsum,
hard to overlook in Carlsbad Caverns and especially Lechuguilla Cave,
within the park boundaries, are the chemical byproducts.</TE>
<TE>   Like most detectives, Hill had to find the answers long after the
culprit had left the scene. Carlsbad and Lechuguilla were formed 3
million to 4 million years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Some answers were found in literature about other caves --
particularly the Lower Kane Cave in northern Wyoming and the Cueva de
Villa Luz in Mexico. The work of J. Harlen Bretz, who challenged
conventional views of cave formation in the 1940s, also helped.</TE>
<TE>   Hill's book, "The Geology of Carlsbad Caverns," published in the
1980s, was fully accepted by scientists only within the last five
years.</TE>
<TE>   Hill and Art Palmer, a professor of earth sciences at the State
University of New York at Oneonta, said caves like Carlsbad are among
just 5% to 10% in the United States formed primarily by such sulfuric
acid reactions. Hill's work is regarded as very accurate, Palmer
said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's just very exciting to have a totally different way to form
caves," Palmer said.</TE>
<TE>   There remain doubters in the oil industry, he said, but "there are
just so many smoking guns -- minerals that can only be produced by
sulfuric acid" -- that the evidence gets stronger supporting Hill all
the time.</TE>
<TE>   Pete Modreski, a geochemist with the U.S. Geological Service in
Denver, also endorsed Hill's work, saying her findings have "advanced
the science in quantum jumps."</TE>
<TE>   Hill's comparative work with sulfur isotopes, skewed versions of
the element, let her trace sulfur through the process and see how it
worked. If her research weren't enough, the process is still at work
inside caves in Mexico and Wyoming.</TE>
<TE>   Today, at Carlsbad Caverns, the brochures reflect the latest
findings.</TE>

<HD>Magic Isn't Just About Tricks, Professor Says; It's About
Life</HD>
<DH>He uses the device to teach philosophy and to show students
how to be powerful and artistic.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bill Bergstrom</AU>
<BD>Associated Press Writer</BD>
<DL>ALLENTOWN, Pa.</DL>
<LD>As a dozen students waited for philosophy professor Lawrence Hass to
start class, some did card tricks, shuffling and rearranging decks,
fanning them into circles, reclosing them with one hand.</LD>
<LD>   The class at tiny Muhlenberg College was Theory and Art of Magic,
and Hass started by chatting about tricks, and giving some students
books and videos on ones they might perform in a show. Yes, they
would be graded.</LD>
<LD>   But this class wasn't really about the tricks.</LD>
<TE>   "It's to learn how to make magic out of a trick. Tricks are easy
to come by," he said. "Magic is deceptive, powerful, entertaining,
and perhaps--this is the Holy Grail--perhaps even artistic."</TE>
<TE>   Magic is about life.</TE>
<TE>   As Hass stood before his wide-eyed charges, a light blue shirt
over his otherwise all-black T-shirt and trousers, he wondered aloud
which of their own qualities they might craft into a performing
magician's persona.</TE>
<TE>   Wise guy or sage? Trickster or friend? Teacher or clown?</TE>
<TE>   "Who am I going to be when I perform? What side or sides of myself
will I reveal in my performance? You can't present every side of
yourself or you are going to present mush," Hass said. "That's a
pretty high-level kind of reflection."</TE>
<TE>   The popular class began three years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Philip LaPorta, a 19-year-old sophomore physics major from Lodi,
N.J., said he was eager to be in this fall's group.</TE>
<TE>   "All of last semester I practiced," said LaPorta, who before class
rehearsed fanning a deck of cards into a full circle and closing it
again one-handed, without dropping any. "That took me a month.
Closing it took another two weeks."</TE>
<TE>   Other colleges offer classes in magic. The Chavez College of Magic
in Hollywood is devoted entirely to it. The University of Minnesota
offers the Art of Magic as a youth program for students 12 to 15.</TE>
<TE>   To Hass, who has taught at the 2,100-student liberal arts college
since 1991, magic was an intriguing way to approach the study of
philosophy. His insight came while watching a magic show 10 years ago
with his son.</TE>
<TE>   "I said, 'Wait, magicians are creating experience. I want to be
able to do that.' "</TE>
<TE>   The class invites magicians to perform and lecture. Hass teaches
the basics: sleight of hand, directing attention and the psychology
of deceptions. Students put on juried performances, judged by
professional magicians.</TE>
<TE>   Among the performers who visit the 154-year-old school are Eugene
Burger, author of 16 books on magic; Margaret Steele, a musician and
magician who has performed throughout the world and written music and
magic programs, and mind-reader Max Maven.</TE>
<TE>   "When we see Eugene Berger with his low voice, Max Maven with his
[demonic] eye, David Copperfield with his flourishes, Siegfried and
Roy with their tigers, it is so tempting to take up their personas,"
Hasssaid. But that won't work.</TE>
<TE>   "When you are an actor or musician, you are letting yourself come
forth in your performance. It's hard," Hass said.</TE>
<TE>   In ancient Greece, the temple of the Oracle at Delphi was
inscribed "Know Thyself," and Socrates, the first philosopher, said
that was the most difficult question. "With Freud, we know there are
sides that are hidden from ourselves," Hass said.</TE>
<TE>   "There is so much psychology in it," said Michael Bernstein, 20,
who is from Philadelphia. Bernstein, a double major in philosophy and
psychology, said magic skills would help him connect with children he
works with.</TE>
<TE>   Bernstein, too, put in time learning basics, such as causing the
deck of cards to stream smoothly from one hand to the other with his
hands a foot apart. That took a week.</TE>
<TE>   Hass covers craft as well as philosophy, including a magician's
need to control the attention of the audience. To show how not to do
that, he stood still and spoke in a monotone.</TE>
<TE>   "I have a quarter. Now it's gone," he said. "Not very
interesting."</TE>
<TE>   The result was different when he swept his hand forward with a
flourish, leaned almost over the first row of desks, fixed his eyes
on the upraised coin and intoned: "Lives can be won or lost on the
flip of a coin."</TE>
<TE>   The class stared. "If I am weaving a tale, I could truck the
elephant in," Hass said. "And that's exactly how the elephant gets in
there."</TE>
<TE>   After class, LaPorta observed that magicians direct attention away
from the skills they work for hours to perfect.</TE>
<TE>   "We practice things nobody is supposed to see," he said.</TE>
<TE>   But success is rewarding.</TE>
<TE>   "There is nothing better than to show somebody a magic trick and
see them smile," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Hass advises students to fight tension that can tangle the
fingers. In his first notebooks as a beginning magician, he
constantly reminded himself in big letters: "RELAX LARRY."</TE>
<TE>   For those he hoped would be magicians one day, he offered another
tip: Don't draw attention to the deception by looking guilty.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not out to trick you; I'm trying to make magic for you," Hass
said. "I'm trying to make you have an experience that's interesting
and enjoyable."</TE>

<HD>Sweet Return From Syrup May Be Heading North</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jeff Donn</AU>
<BD>Associated Press Writer</BD>
<DL>FERRISBURGH, Vt.</DL>
<LD>Sam Cutting Sr. eases from his pickup, lumbers stiffly in blue jeans
and suspenders up a hillside, and cranes his neck toward the maple
grove that nearly broke his heart.</LD>
<LD>   The crowns are finally spreading again. But some 3-foot-thick
trunks are sheered 30 feet from the ground. Dead branches lie
scattered in piles like drying bones.</LD>
<LD>   Cutting's sugarbush -- a syrup maker's term of endearment for his
maple woods -- is still recovering from an ice storm four years ago
during a winter thaw.</LD>
<TE>   "There was so much damage, you couldn't even walk through here,"
said Cutting, the 70-year-old patriarch who remains master syrup
maker of a family business now run by his son. "I just thought: I've
had it. I'm never going to sugar again."</TE>
<TE>   He was wrong. The 30-acre leased sugarbush is finally returning to
its earlier seasonal output of about 300 gallons of syrup. For the
Cuttings, though, it was a sour taste of what global warming from
man-made greenhouse gases could do in coming generations.</TE>
<TE>   "We've always had worries with the maples. I've seen bugs and
drought," Cutting said. "When it gets to man-made things, it's more
of a worry."</TE>
<TE>   He may be right to worry. Government-sponsored researchers have
found statistical evidence that cold-loving maples yield less sap in
warmer winters. In keeping with that data, an Associated Press
analysis of syrup production over the past eight decades shows a
decline in every New England state but Maine -- the only one to buck
the warming trend.</TE>
<TE>   There is no definitive scientific proof yet that warmer
temperatures take even part of the blame. But University of New
Hampshire forester Rock Barrett, who oversaw the government report,
fears that it may already be too late for maple country.</TE>
<TE>   It is said that roughly one in four Vermont trees is a sugar
maple. Vermonters made almost 60% of New England's 850,000 gallons of
syrup this year, according to federal farm data.</TE>
<TE>   Every year, as winter begins to melt away, Vermont's sugarhouses
come back to life. They puff thick white smoke from stainless steel
evaporators that boil sap down to syrup. Punctuated by vacuum gauges,
sap-carrying plastic tubing -- a technology that is replacing
suspended buckets -- snakes through thick woods to collection tubs.
Vermont kids, as always, freeze maple treats in the snow.</TE>
<TE>   In Ferrisburgh, in western Vermont about 60 miles from the
Canadian border, the Cutting grandchildren are already lending a hand
in the family business. But the adults wonder if it will eventually
be lost to future generations.</TE>
<TE>   "It would be devastating because it has been such a strong part of
our heritage," said Cutting's son, also named Sam.</TE>
<TE>   Already, over recent decades, most expansion in syrup production
has occurred in the north, in colder Quebec. In the last 10 years
alone, yearly production there has doubled to satisfy a booming
market, now eclipsing the United States fivefold, according to the
North American Maple Syrup Council.</TE>
<TE>   Over the last 80 years, New England's typical syrup output has
dropped by more than half, from more than 1.6 million gallons a year
to less than 800,000, the AP analysis shows. Syrup has dwindled to a
$22-million annual regional business, according to the U.S.
Department of Agriculture.</TE>
<TE>   Clearly, social and economic changes, including the shift from an
agrarian society and the advent of popular syrup substitutes, explain
much of the maple industry's contraction. But the region's average
annual temperature -- combined with upstate New York's -- also
climbed nearly 1 degree during the 20th century, possibly further
depressing syrup flow. Vermont has warmed by 1.6 degrees, the climate
data shows.</TE>
<TE>   Only Maine has cooled, slipping a yearly average of nearly half a
degree -- perhaps because of its long coast, vast forests or other
differences in geography and land use. Meanwhile, Maine's syrup
production has exploded from less than 12,000 gallons a year through
most of the 1980s to 230,000 gallons this year. The boom stems partly
from an invasion of Quebec sugar makers working Maine forests, but
temperature may also play a part, the research suggests.</TE>
<TE>   In another possible hint of the future, some New England syrup
makers have noticed an earlier sugaring season over past decades. In
Vermont, it now typically starts a few weeks sooner, in late
February.</TE>
<TE>   Without more control of man-made greenhouse gases, New England's
average yearly temperature could rise by 6 to 10 degrees over the
next century, according to the report sponsored last year by the
federal government's Global Change Research Program.</TE>
<TE>   Seemingly slight annual shifts in temperature can transform
climate and landscape. After all, parts of New England were buried
under 2 miles of ice about 20,000 years ago -- when the annual global
average temperature was just 10 to 12 degrees colder than now. The
warming forecast in the next century would make Boston's climate more
like today's in Richmond, Va., or Atlanta, the federal researchers
say.</TE>
<TE>   Their prediction unsettles Bill Eva, president of the New
Hampshire Maple Producers Assn. "They make very little syrup in
Virginia," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Many sugar makers are unruffled. They say that even if the
predictions are right, changes will unfold gradually over decades,
with limited effects on them or their children.</TE>
<TE>   "I haven't really seen any deterioration in the health of our
trees because of warm weather, and I haven't seen any real decline in
sap production," said third-generation mapleman Hank Peterson of
Londonderry, N.H. "It's the old Yankee saying that 'if it ain't
broke, don't fix it.' "</TE>
<TE>   New England governors and eastern Canadian premiers have set a
goal of reducing the region's greenhouse gas output to at least 10%
below 1990 emissions by the year 2020. Activists are pressing for
more fuel-efficient cars and cleaner energy generation.</TE>
<TE>   Even in Quebec, where sap still gushes like Texas oil, there is
disquiet.</TE>
<TE>   "We could lose the industry totally," said Luc Lussier, a Quebec
syrup distributor who is president of the North American Maple Syrup
Council.</TE>

<HD>Mercury Levels in Seafood Questioned</HD>
<DH>Substance is known to impair infants and children, but its
effects on adults are unclear. Public officials hope to find out.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Sharon L. Crenson and Martha Mendoza</AU>
<BD>Associated Press Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Mercury is poison. And yet it is on dinner plates everywhere -- in
sea bass served in fancy restaurants, in tuna casserole ladled out at
home.</LD>
<LD>   Most of the time, there is so little mercury, it goes unnoticed.
But that doesn't mean the mercury in swordfish, shark, trout or
snapper is harmless. Eat enough -- or eat enough fish from especially
polluted waters -- and it can make you sick.</LD>
<LD>   Too much mercury damages the nervous system, especially the brain.
Too much in pregnant and breast-feeding women, or those who may
become pregnant, can hurt their babies -- adversely affecting
children's intelligence, coordination and memory. Children under 7
are vulnerable too because their young brains are still forming.</LD>
<TE>   But how much is too much? And are adults at risk as well?</TE>
<TE>   Rising public concern about those questions, which have been
in the background for years, is prompting public health officials to
look more seriously at mercury and its effects. After a four-year
moratorium, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration is set to decide
this month whether to resume measuring mercury in fish. The
Environmental Protection Agency will host a conference beginning
Sunday in Burlington, Vt., to discuss cases in which people are
believed to have been sickened by mercury in fish.</TE>
<TE>   State and federal officials disagree over what constitutes a safe
exposure level; their programs for monitoring mercury in fish are an
on-again, off-again hodgepodge full of scientific holes. There are no
long-term studies on Americans, and some of the studies that have
been done are contradictory or involve people whose diets are far
different from that of Americans.</TE>
<TE>   There are those who say mercury in seafood is a menace, perhaps
the biggest threat to childhood development since scientists
discovered lead exposure lowers IQ. They say emissions from oil- and
coal-powered plants are spreading this poison to an alarming degree.</TE>
<TE>   There are others who say the threat is overblown -- that fish,
loaded with protein and heart-healthy Omega 3 fatty acids, is so good
for you, it outweighs any concern.</TE>
<TE>   The fact is, no one knows.</TE>
<TE>   "We're all looking for the truth. I don't think anybody knows what
the truth is," said Dr. Spencer Garrett of the National Marine
Fisheries Service.</TE>
<TE>   Suzie Piallat has a name for it: "fish fog." Piallat, of Tiburon,
Calif., was tired and achy and she couldn't concentrate. Finally, she
went to Dr. Jane Hightower, a San Francisco internist.</TE>
<TE>   When Hightower asked Piallat if she ate a lot of fish, she said
yes -- eight meals a week. And when Hightower tested her blood, she
found mercury levels of 76 parts per billion, 15 times the amount
considered safe by the federal Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm a health nut; I've always done the healthy thing. I never
heard any of the warnings," Piallat said. "I thought eating fish was
good for me."</TE>
<TE>   Piallat -- who cut back on her fish consumption and soon felt
better -- can't be faulted for missing those warnings. It is only
recently that some doctors have reported that adult patients are
being harmed by mercury in fish.</TE>
<TE>   "I see people in my practice, sick from eating way too much
commercial seafood, on a regular basis," Hightower said.</TE>
<TE>   Her peer-reviewed study of seafood consumption and high mercury
levels in her patients, many of whom report symptoms such as aching
joints and exhaustion, is slated for publication by the National
Institutes of Health this fall.</TE>
<TE>   There is no doubt that these patients feel sick, and no doubt that
they have high levels of mercury in their blood. But, as of yet, no
study has proven that the mercury caused their illness, although
Hightower notes many of her patients' symptoms are consistent with
mercury poisoning.</TE>
<TE>   There are skeptics, and there is much confusion about safe levels
and whether they vary from person to person.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not an absolute, like over this level everybody dies and
below this level nobody gets sick," said Dr. Henry Anderson, medical
officer at the Wisconsin Bureau of Public Health, who studied a
family contaminated with mercury after eating fish meals three to
four times a week.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like being on a highway; how many miles above the limit can
you go without getting arrested? There are a lot of factors and some
chance," Anderson said.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Michael Gochfeld, a clinical professor of environmental and
community medicine at Rutgers University in New Jersey, said he sees
two or three patients a year with elevated mercury levels from eating
too much mercury-laden fish.</TE>
<TE>   "Ironically, these are usually health-conscious people who have
shifted their diets away from red meat to fish," he said. "Some
people eat 10 fish meals a week."</TE>
<TE>   The latest FDA guidelines recommend that pregnant women and small
children eat no more than two meals of fish each week.</TE>
<TE>   The recommendation is based on a study conducted in the Faroe
Islands, a remote archipelago in the North Atlantic between Norway
and Iceland.</TE>
<TE>   The Faroes researchers, from Boston University, found that
children whose mothers' diets featured whale meat or blubber during
pregnancy had lower scores on a battery of tests designed to measure
intelligence, coordination, memory and similar skills. Children
exposed to the most mercury in utero were especially impaired in
language, memory and attention.</TE>
<TE>   But even children exposed to relatively low levels, comparable to
the upper end of the range found in the U.S. population, had some
impairment.</TE>
<TE>   There are some problems with the Faroes study:</TE>
<TE>   * It focuses on exposure of fetuses and embryos to mercury, while
the FDA uses it to gauge safe limits for adults.</TE>
<TE>   Still, it may be better than the research the EPA used until
recently to set its standards -- a 1971 study of people in Iraq who
mistakenly ate mercury-contaminated grain. A onetime poisonous dose
of mercury -- 459 people died in that incident -- is not the same as
long-term exposure to slightly elevated levels.</TE>
<TE>   (The most notorious incident of mercury seafood poisoning occurred
in Japan. Beginning in the 1950s, more than 1,400 people died and
thousands of others were sickened or crippled from eating fish
tainted by mercury in Minamata Bay.)</TE>
<TE>   * The FDA guidelines use the Faroes study to establish the number
of fish meals any one person could safely eat. In calculating that
figure, the agency did not take into account that fish from some
waters have far more mercury than the average serving of commercial
seafood.</TE>
<TE>   Freshwater fish sampled by states bordering the Gulf of Mexico,
for example, average 3 1/2 times as much mercury as the average for
commercial seafood, according to a computer-assisted analysis by the
Associated Press.</TE>
<TE>   Also, the Faroes results are based on people who eat whale, a
mammal rather than a fish.</TE>
<TE>   * A second study -- conducted in the Seychelles islands in the
Indian Ocean off Africa -- found no ill effects from elevated
exposure to mercury in fish during fetal development.</TE>
<TE>   The University of Rochester scientists who conducted the
Seychelles study, which was published in 1998, have struggled to
explain why their results are so different from those of the Boston
researchers. Maybe the Faroes results were skewed because of PCBs in
whale blubber (the researchers deny it). Maybe it was because of
differences in the ways the two studies measured children's
development.</TE>
<TE>   It is also possible that high fish consumption in the Seychelles,
while exposing children to relatively high levels of mercury, also
improves brain development. In other words, the nutritional value of
the fish itself could overwhelm any negative effect of mercury.</TE>
<TE>   That would resonate with the arguments of many in the fish
industry.</TE>
<TE>   "Fish is good for you," said Randy Ray of the Pacific Seafood
Processors Assn. of Mercer Island, Wash. "Pretty much most of the
ocean is really, really safe. You've got some local water bodies
which are an issue and some fish at the top of the food chain that
are an issue but, by and large, chow down on the shrimp."</TE>
<TE>   What is beyond dispute is this: Mercury warnings for U.S. lakes,
rivers and coastal regions increased 115% from 1993 to 2001. There
are almost 2,000 mercury-in-fish warnings on various water bodies in
44 states.</TE>
<TE>   Mercury is a naturally occurring element found in the Earth's
crust and sometimes exposed by volcanic eruptions, mining and other
disturbances. More commonly, it makes its way into the environment
when oil- and coal-fired power plants burn those fossil fuels,
separating the mercury from the carbon and spewing it into the
atmosphere.</TE>
<TE>   Rain washes the metal from the air onto land and into waterways,
where it settles and is eaten by microorganisms that turn it into
methylmercury. Small fish then eat the organisms, absorb the
methylmercury and are eaten by larger fish.</TE>
<TE>   The methylmercury accumulates, making its way up the food chain in
ever-increasing concentrations until people consume it.</TE>
<TE>   If there is a consensus among scientists, it is that the most
vulnerable population by far is the very young, especially
still-developing fetuses. Like lead, mercury can wreak havoc on the
rapidly multiplying cells of a growing brain, leading later in life
to decreased intelligence, lowered coordination and impaired hearing.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the chemical that can push the child over the edge," said
Dr. Philip Landrigan, chairman of the Mount Sinai medical school's
Department of Community and Preventive Medicine.</TE>
<TE>   According to a National Academy of Sciences report issued in 2000,
60,000 babies born each year might be at risk of neurological damage
because of mercury, and that will probably mean more kids who
struggle in school and need remedial classes or special education.</TE>
<TE>   Findings like these have led British authorities to recommend that
pregnant women abstain from eating fish.</TE>
<TE>   In Japan, where per-capita fish consumption far outpaces that
in the United States, researchers are beginning to investigate the
effects of chronic, low-level mercury exposure. Studies have
repeatedly shown elevated mercury levels among the Japanese, as well
as medical problems in some people. But a Health Ministry spokesman
said the Japanese government does not issue any consumption
guidelines for specific foods.</TE>
<TE>   In the United States, the FDA held a three-day conference in July
and suggested that pregnant women limit the canned tuna they eat to
two six-ounce cans a week -- if that is the only source of fish in
their diets -- and to only one can if they eat other fish. The agency
zeroed in on canned tuna because it is by far the most popular
seafood Americans eat. There is no evidence that it is potentially
any worse than many other fish. Canned tuna has more mercury than
scallops or catfish, for example, but less than fresh tuna or
lobster, according to a May 2001 FDA report.</TE>
<TE>   The FDA advises pregnant women not to eat swordfish, shark, king
mackerel or tilefish (also known as golden or white snapper), the
species known to contain the highest levels of mercury.</TE>
<TE>   But this is not enough for some doctors and activists, who
say that because of gaps in our knowledge about mercury, the
standards are little more than educated guesses. They lament that the
FDA stopped monitoring mercury in fish four years ago -- "so that it
could look at all the data that had accumulated," said spokesman Mike
Herndon. He did not say why monitoring stopped during the evaluation.</TE>
<TE>   "Without an adequate mercury-monitoring program for seafood, it is
virtually impossible for pregnant women and women of reproductive age
to make informed dietary choices," said Dr. Ted Schettler of
Physicians for Social Responsibility.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.) has also been among those
pressing for a stronger FDA effort.</TE>
<TE>   The Centers for Disease Control says one in 10 women have
potentially dangerous levels of mercury in their blood. Wendy Moro
was one of them.</TE>
<TE>   Moro, 40, of Burlingame, Calif., wanted to get healthy, so she ate
fish: Tuna for lunch. Crab salad for a snack. Sushi for dinner. But
the more fish she ate, the sicker she felt.</TE>
<TE>   For years, she visited doctors, neurologists, endocrinologists,
general practitioners, even a psychologist who assured her that she
wasn't crazy -- just sick.</TE>
<TE>   Finally Moro visited Hightower, the San Francisco internist who
tested, among dozens of other items, the mercury levels in Moro's
blood.</TE>
<TE>   What she found was three times the medically safe levels spelled
out by the CDC.</TE>
<TE>   "I was shocked," Moro said. "We're told to eat fish; we're told
it's great for you."</TE>
<TE>   And that, to experts like Dr. Jae Hong Lee, former senior medical
policy analyst at the National Center for Policy Research for Women
and Families, is the crux of the problem. Not enough has been done to
determine the effects of mercury or the amount of mercury in fish --
or to publicize the fact that there is reason for concern. "The
public knows about the many health benefits of eating fish," Lee
said. "But few know about the risk of eating too much."</TE>

<HD>Young 'Carveboarders' Head for the Hills for Their Thrills</HD>
<DH>Sport combines skills of snowboarding, skateboarding and
surfing. Bus drivers liken themselves to ski lift operators.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Martha Irvine</AU>
<BD>Associated Press Writer</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>It's nearing 11 p.m. as six guys hop on a city bus, each of them
toting a wheeled contraption that looks like the monster truck of
skateboards.</LD>
<LD>   The men, mostly young professionals in their 20s, have already
spent years looking to ride the perfect wave or carve into an
untouched mountainside of powder snow.</LD>
<LD>   But those aren't options right now.</LD>
<TE>   Tonight, the moon is out, the fog uncharacteristically absent and
traffic scant -- ideal conditions for a sport that combines
techniques used in skateboarding, snowboarding and even surfing.</TE>
<TE>   Some call it carveboarding or flowboarding, names derived from the
brand of boards they ride.</TE>
<TE>   In rougher terrain, with no asphalt and wheeled boards that have
bindings, it's commonly known as mountainboarding.</TE>
<TE>   "Final destination," driver Roy Flugence says over the bus
loudspeaker, drawing a chorus of laughter and cheers as the group
exits at the top of a steep hill.</TE>
<TE>   The next few hours are a flurry of wild rides and commentary --
"Nice one!" and "Watch the wall!" -- through San Francisco's Sunset
District, a residential neighborhood with Pacific Ocean views.</TE>
<TE>   Fueled by a steady intake of doughnuts, candy and the occasional
beer, the riders race down the hills, one after the other, making
quick, zigzagging turns. Along the way, they scope out driveways that
make good ramps for fancy turns and a little added excitement.</TE>
<TE>   Beginners are advised to start with deeply carved, slower turns.
And even the most experienced riders adjust their wheel pressure to
the incline (softer tires have more grip on steep hills).</TE>
<TE>   "Ohhhhh, man," Josiah Bunting said as he got up after a too-close
encounter with a telephone pole.</TE>
<TE>   Even he admits that falling is "unnerving" -- and he won on the TV
show "Fear Factor," a gig that included jumping from a moving
vehicle.</TE>
<TE>   "All you can do is dig in your wheels, lower your center of
gravity and hope for the best," said Bunting, who sells ads for a
high-tech magazine by day.</TE>
<TE>   He and the others choose not to wear helmets or other protective
gear. But most board makers recommend otherwise.</TE>
<TE>   On their Web site, for example, the makers of Mongoose All-Terrain
Boards advise wearing "a helmet, protective eye wear, wrist guards,
leather gloves, elbow pads, knee pads, sturdy athletic shoes, long
pants and long sleeves."</TE>
<TE>   The boards themselves are often well over 3 feet long and
generally cost $200 to $300.</TE>
<TE>   The first time Steve Agnew saw one, he thought: "Dude, that looks
like a death missile."</TE>
<TE>   "But no, it was flexible," he said, noting the looser springs that
allow the board to pivot from side to side much more easily than
traditional skateboards. That feature, along with more or larger
wheels, makes it easier to turn.</TE>
<TE>   Agnew, a longtime surfer, said he liked the boards so much he
became a sales representative for Carveboard, a company based in
Carlsbad, Calif., and founded more than three years ago by surfing
star Brad Gerlach and his father, Joe.</TE>
<TE>   Flowlab, another California-based company, makes a board that has
a series of wheels underneath, lined up in rows on either end of the
board.</TE>
<TE>   Agnew said many stores that carry surfing and snowboarding gear
are starting to ask for more of these boards. The companies that make
them also distribute as far away as Australia, Japan and Europe.</TE>
<TE>   But the sport, while growing in stature, is still clearly in its
infancy. Online message boards dedicated to it often contain pleas
from people looking for riding partners.</TE>
<TE>   Many, said Agnew, keep their boards in their cars, searching for
any decent patch of ridable incline. The less traffic, the better.</TE>
<TE>   That's why the San Francisco group often chooses later weeknights
to make their runs.</TE>
<TE>   They have little to fear from police, who are pretty tolerant of
skateboarding, although Jabez Boyd said friends who don't ride give
him a hard time.</TE>
<TE>   "They ask, 'How old are you?' " said Boyd, who's 28 and works in
commercial real estate. "And it does -- it takes us back to eighth
grade. It makes us smile a lot."</TE>
<TE>   He and the others found each other by word of mouth. Some met
snowboarding. Others are college or work buddies.</TE>
<TE>   When they're out riding, they take turns driving a "chase car," in
case of injury or problems with their boards.</TE>
<TE>   But they rely on the bus for transportation up the hills -- and
share doughnuts with the drivers who are nice to them.</TE>
<TE>   It's a well-known fact that Flugence, one of their favorite
drivers, likes chocolate doughnuts.</TE>
<TE>   "These guys are outta sight. They're out here all the
cotton-pickin' time," Flugence said, grinning. "They make me feel
like I'm a ski lift."</TE>
<TE>   If you squint your eyes, rider Chris Clark said, you might just
believe it, especially on nights when fog rolls in from the ocean and
over the San Francisco hilltops.</TE>
<TE>   Said Clark: "It almost looks like you're in a snowstorm."</TE>

<HD>Answer to Heavy Backpacks: E-books</HD>
<DH>Some educators say the real solution is Internet
assignments or CD-ROMs. But the cost may preclude their widespread
use for now.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Martha Irvine</AU>
<BD>Associated Press Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Something's missing at Sun Valley Charter High School in Ramona,
Calif. There are no textbooks, only computers.</LD>
<LD>   That means students there don't have to lug heavy backpacks -- a
familiar ritual for many young Americans who carry books from class
to class and home at day's end.</LD>
<LD>   Growing back-pain complaints prompted a California law limiting
textbook weight. But some say assignments from the Internet,
"e-books" or CD-ROMs will be the real solution.</LD>
<TE>   "It's not the wave of the future; it's the wave of the present,"
said David Tarr, executive director -- instead of principal -- at Sun
Valley High, a public school near San Diego.</TE>
<TE>   Officials there used money normally spent on textbooks for
computers. The new school's first students -- about 60 incoming
freshmen -- get assignments from such services as Cuestia.com, an
online library, and Interactive Mathematics, curriculum on computer
CD.</TE>
<TE>   It sounds nice, but unrealistic to Monika Rohall, 15, of Chicago.
"What about kids who don't have fast-running computers at home?" she
asked.</TE>
<TE>   A freshman at Chicago's Lane Tech High School, she's stuck
navigating four flights of stairs with all her books because she has
no time to get to her locker between classes. Back pain from her
overloaded pack has caused her to quit the volleyball team.</TE>
<TE>   Such health problems are increasingly common, says Grace Walker, a
registered physical therapist in Orange, Calif.</TE>
<TE>   Each year, she and other practitioners say they seemore young
people with backpack-related pain. In severe cases, it can lead to
curvature of the spine.</TE>
<TE>   Some students have found solutions.</TE>
<TE>   Megan Brychcy, a high school senior in Perry, Ga., says a
different kind of book bag -- one with a single padded strap intended
for one shoulder -- helped her.</TE>
<TE>   Walker's 12-year-old son uses a rolling backpack, dragged on
wheels behind him. His mom also buys extra textbooks to keep at home.</TE>
<TE>   That's not an issue at Sun Valley High. Sometimes, students print
out assignments to take home. And if homework requires a computer,
they use the school machines after class.</TE>
<TE>   Still, in some lower-income districts, textbooks -- let alone
computers -- are already scarce.</TE>
<TE>   Students in some Chicago elementary schools, for example, aren't
allowed to take textbooks home for fear they'll get lost or stolen.
Students often copy assignments out of textbooks.</TE>
<TE>   Such funding shortages make CD-ROMs and desktop computers seem
unattainable.</TE>
<TE>   "Clearly, electronic delivery will make this problem go away. But
I think we're a number of years away from that," said Stephen
Driesler, executive director of the Assn. of American Publishers'
school division, a trade group for textbook publishers.</TE>
<TE>   Still others believe that with wider use, high-tech devices will
be cheaper than costly-to-print textbooks.</TE>
<TE>   That's why last spring, Richard Bellaver asked his graduate
students at Ball State University to test e-books, hand-held devices
that present electronic text and pictures. He says the average scores
of students who studied only with e-books and those who used
traditional textbooks were virtually the same.</TE>
<TE>   Now he wants to try other high-tech options to see what works best
for students -- "and, hopefully, save them some money," said
Bellaver, associate director of the university's Center for
Information and Communication Sciences.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever technology becomes dominant, Mark Gross -- CEO and
founder of New York-based Data Conversion Laboratory Inc. -- says
schools will eventually save money.</TE>
<TE>   "This will be a boon for poor educational districts," said Gross,
whose company has converted everything from bulky law books to the
Defense Department's weapons systems guides into electronic text.</TE>
<TE>   Until then, New Jersey is considering imposing a maximum textbook
weight. California Gov. Gray Davis signed a similar measure this
month.</TE>
<TE>   Textbook publishers, meanwhile, suggest restoring lockers that
have been removed at many schools and giving students time between
classes to get to them.</TE>
<TE>   Driesler said more students should wear backpacks properly -- on
both shoulders not one.</TE>

<HD>Chi Kung Practitioners Call It a Healing Art</HD>
<DH>Elderly Waikiki students consider it their fountain of
youth. Martial arts master teaches the classes free.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jaymes Song</AU>
<BD>Associated Press Writer</BD>
<DL>HONOLULU</DL>
<LD>Twice a week, about 100 people gather under a giant banyan tree at
the foot of Diamond Head to imitate the body motions and breathing of
a martial arts master who believes that "health is wealth" and that
acquiring it should be free.</LD>
<LD>   It's clear that they leave the one-hour classes refreshed and
renewed. Those who swear by the art of chi kung say it does even more
than that -- from reducing asthma symptoms to helping them walk.</LD>
<LD>   Whatever the reason for these changes, students of Master Luk Chun
Bond say his free guidance has brought them to their fountain of
youth.</LD>
<TE>   Luk's students are mostly in their 60s, 70s and 80s, although a
few are younger. They come from all economic and ethnic backgrounds,
dressed in everything from jogging suits to business attire.</TE>
<TE>   The classes in Kapiolani Park just off Waikiki Beach draw folks
from the island of Oahu and all over the world. Tourists walking
around the park often stop and watch for a few minutes before
dropping their cameras to join in. And some attend the class each
time they return to Hawaii.</TE>
<TE>   They swear by the health benefits of the class and the ancient
healing art that uses breathing and slow, subtle movements to channel
"chi" -- a person's inner energy -- to heal an ailment or injury.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike other martial arts classes, chi kung has no jarring moves,
no kicks, no punches, no black belts and no uniforms. It is simply a
laid-back, comfortable atmosphere where people come to relieve stress
and meditate. Students do a series of bending and squatting
movements, raising their arms and holding a position. As they go
through the movements, they appear to be praying, dancing, relaxing
and stretching.</TE>
<TE>   "All the moves should be done slowly and gracefully," Luk tells
the students. "Communicate with your body."</TE>
<TE>   Luk, a 52-year-old third-generation master from Hong Kong, says he
conducts the free classes to carry on his grandfather's dreams of
creating a better society and sharing the art. Luk makes his living
running a Waikiki hair salon.</TE>
<TE>   Charging people for his classes is against his family's policy.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a very famous Chinese saying: 'If you have good health,
you have everything,' " Luk said. "Good health is a great asset.
Health is wealth. Money can't buy it. It's priceless."</TE>
<TE>   All Luk asks in return is that his students practice chi kung for
30 minutes a day and eat a proper diet of natural foods.</TE>
<TE>   "My father always said in all the dietary considerations, you have
to be moderate," Luk said. "Everything in moderation, including
moderation itself."</TE>
<TE>   As the students go through each exercise, Luk explains what part
of the body the movement is intended to help -- everything from
hemorrhoids to heart disease, he claims.</TE>
<TE>   Rosanne Harrigan, chairwoman of the Complementary and Alternative
Medicine division at the University of Hawaii, said more clinical
research needs to be completed before she accepts chi kung as having
healing qualities.</TE>
<TE>   "Much of traditional Chinese medicine is built on theories of
balancing one's life and, much like anything else, when you bring
things into balance, energy flows better," she said. "So from a
traditional Chinese medicine point of view, it makes a lot of
potential sense."</TE>
<TE>   No scientific studies affirm the therapies practiced by Luk, she
said. "However, people use them and we are hearing many positive
testimonials about them."</TE>
<TE>   Joe Kim, 89, has been coming to Luk's sessions for a couple of
years. "I'm more relaxed and my joints are looser," he said. "I think
it just counteracts old age."</TE>
<TE>   Syndy Soucy, a 67-year-old native of Massachusetts, has suffered
from health problems all her life, including severe respiratory
problems. For years, she has been on prescription medication and
making regular trips to the doctor. Only after taking Luk's classes
does she feel healthy.</TE>
<TE>   "The class saved my life. It saved my life because I would've
continued to get sicker and sicker and now I'm so healthy I can't
believe it," she said. "I couldn't breathe well enough to walk, I
would count steps. I've been coming here for four years and my asthma
is almost nil. Here I am so healthy, I cannot believe it."</TE>
<TE>   Terry Hasagawa, 73, says the secret is faithfulness.</TE>
<TE>   "Chi kung, you just don't do once or twice a week," he said. "You
got to do it every day. You got to make it a part of your day. If you
do that, then you'll find the results are there. I feel so much
stronger."</TE>

<HD>Opals Fire the Passion of Small Idaho Town</HD>
<DH>Spencer is located near one of the largest deposits in the
U.S. Its four stores carry everything from loose stones to jewelry.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Rebecca Boone</AU>
<BD>Associated Press Writer</BD>
<DL>SPENCER, Idaho</DL>
<LD>From Interstate 15, the tiny town passes in a moment, just a blip of
brown buildings in the desert.</LD>
<LD>   But inside the local stores is a treasure trove. The fire of opals
erupts from jewelry cases lining the walls.</LD>
<LD>   Spencer, population 38, holds one of the largest opal deposits in
the United States and is home to rare star opals. Although white is
the most common color worldwide, Spencer miners find rarer blue, pink
or red gems.</LD>
<TE>   "Our customers are generally jewelers and distributors," said Bob
Thompson, who owns Opal Mountain Mines with his wife, Susan. "In the
winters, we close up and go to California because you can't mine when
the ground is covered in snow. But people do stop in from the
highway, and they're generally surprised at all we have."</TE>
<TE>   All they have includes opal jewelry and loose stones, traditional
fire opals and opals that have rarer patterns that look like peacock
feathers, harlequin squares or stars.</TE>
<TE>   One wall is lined with jars, filled with gray, broken rocks. The
rocks are veined with flaky layers of raw opal, the same way it comes
out of the mine.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the only place in America where you can sell canned
opals, you've got so much," Susan Thompson said.</TE>
<TE>   Two lost deer hunters from Rexburg discovered opals in the area in
1948 as they wandered about 70 miles from the west edge of
Yellowstone National Park. The first claim was filed in 1952, and now
the town is dominated by four commercial opal companies.</TE>
<TE>   Dennis and Jackie Hooper are the newcomers. Dennis Hooper, a
longtime rockhound, mines his claim to supply his store, High Country
Opal. Brightly painted signs aimed at the highway proclaim that the
store is open 365 days a year -- an idea that his neighbors laughed
at.</TE>
<TE>   "They said there's no way I'd stay open every single day of the
year," he said. "But I am. In wintertime, this is the only restroom
open in 100 miles."</TE>
<TE>   Travelers who dash in for a rest stop pause when they see the
gems, he said. They generally leave sporting an opal ring, earrings
or necklace.The price ranges from a few dollars to a few hundred.</TE>
<TE>   "You never know what you're going to end up with until the final
cut," Hooper said, turning one under a light so the fire flashed.
"Opal is thousands of microscopic colors. The trick to cutting it is
stopping."</TE>
<TE>   The colors are spheres of silica and water suspended in the rock.
The deposits formed when geysers erupted, leaving thin layers of opal
that stacked up over time.</TE>
<TE>   Occasionally, opal miners will find a layer thick enough to cut
solid stones. More frequently, the opals are made into doublets or
triplets. Doublets are opal ground into a thin layer and glued on a
basalt or obsidian back. Triplets are doublets that have been capped
with a clear, protective quartz dome.</TE>
<TE>   The dome protects the gems. Opals have a high water content and
tend to flake or crack as they dry out, unless they are sealed or
treated with chemicals.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel like I can cut as good an opal triplet as anyone in the
world," Hooper said. "It's not rocket science, just ... tedious,
time-consuming work."</TE>
<TE>   Claudia Couture knows that as well as anyone. She owns the Spencer
Opal Mine, the oldest and largest mine in the area.</TE>
<TE>   Couture's parents bought their 40-acre claim in 1964, and the
family moved to Spencer in 1968 when she was 15. At first, they
opened the mine to tourists and rock hounds who paid a set fee for a
day of digging.</TE>
<TE>   Now that Couture is in charge, opal-hunting tourists can still pay
$30 a day, per person, on summer holiday weekends. But the mine
primarily supplies her retail business.</TE>
<TE>   "I've done this my whole life, and I've never had to work for
anyone else," she said. "... Opal mining is just a good living."</TE>

<HD>Woman Held, Accused of Aiding Husband's Suicide</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Vivian LeTran</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A 59-year-old Westminster woman was arrested at her home on suspicion
of helping her husband commit suicide, police said Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   Judith Lopez was being held in lieu of $1-million bail at Orange
County Jail on a single count of murder. Her arraignment is scheduled
for Monday. She listed her occupation on jail documents as a claims
representative.</LD>
<LD>   Police investigators said they suspect Lopez gave her husband,
Mariano, a lethal dose of his cancer medications early Friday to help
end his ongoing pain.</LD>
<TE>   Mariano Lopez, 61, was diagnosed with oral cancer in 1996 and had
developed other ailments since, including pneumonia, spinal
degeneration and heart and gallbladder complications, police said.</TE>
<TE>   He also suffered severe pain from eight fused spinal discs that
required him to wear a body brace. He could not eat solid food. His
illnesses, however, were not deemed life-threatening, authorities
said.</TE>
<TE>   Judith Lopez called authorities to her home on the 13000 block of
Illinois Street at 1:31 a.m. Friday, saying her husband had died.
Authorities who arrived at the scene found evidence that she had
helped administer a lethal dose of several prescribed medications,
police said.</TE>
<TE>   Neighbors knew of Mariano Lopez's declining health.</TE>
<TE>   "I think this is a shame, what happened with Mrs. Lopez," said
Richard Hayden, 79. "If I were that sick and bedridden, I'd
appreciate a little help from a loved one."</TE>
<TE>   Hayden lives about a block from the Lopezes' single-story house in
a senior living community. The couple settled into the neighborhood
23 years ago, three years after they married.</TE>
<TE>   Oregon is the only state where assisted suicide is legal.</TE>

<HD>Migrants' Lives as Seen Through Camera Lens</HD>
<DH>Photographer Rick Nahmias seeks to tell the stories of
today's California farm workers with exhibit in Hollywood.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Sandra Murillo</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The black-and-white picture of Josefina Flores may appear to be
nothing more than an artful portrait of a stoic, silver-haired woman
flourishing in her golden years.</LD>
<LD>   But for Flores, 72, who keeps a shrine to Cesar Chavez in her
living room, sitting for the photo was her way of ensuring that the
legacy of the pioneer labor organizer is never forgotten.</LD>
<LD>   Flores is one of dozens of California farm workers who agreed to
be photographed last summer when Beverly Hills photographer Rick
Nahmias set out to tell the story of today's migrant farm workers.</LD>
<TE>   The routine of their daily lives -- from fields, to schools, to
makeshift playgrounds -- is captured in 40 glossy prints on display
at the Goldwyn Hollywood Library in an exhibit titled "The Migrant
Project."</TE>
<TE>   Flores, who considers the day she joined the United Farm Workers
in 1965 one of the happiest of her life, said she hopes future
generations will continue the struggle against abusive labor
practices.</TE>
<TE>   "I want people to see the faces behind those strikes, those
protests," she said from the UFW retirement home in Delano. "A lot of
people lost everything they had for this movement."</TE>
<TE>   During the farm labor movement of the 1960s and '70s, Chavez's
union swelled to about 100,000 members, and strikes and crop boycotts
made it a national symbol of an age of unrest in America. In "The
Migrant Project," Nahmias tells stories of life, death, work, play
and hope as they relate to today's farm workers.</TE>
<TE>   There's the old man from Calexico who sits inside a rail car,
holding a $74.08 paycheck for two full days of work.</TE>
<TE>   There's the picture of little Mixtec Indian boys playing
unattended in a backyard near the Ventura Freeway in Oxnard.</TE>
<TE>   There's the 11-year-old daughter of farm workers who has already
begun her life as an outreach worker by distributing fire
extinguishers to poor mobile home residents.</TE>
<TE>   These are the people who took Nahmias into their homes and
churches, and who sometimes sneaked him into the fields.</TE>
<TE>   Many did not want their full names used, but most were eager to
give the world a glimpse into their lives, Nahmias said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not fair what we endure in silence," said Maria, a
35-year-old mother of four who has a terminal illness and can no
longer harvest crops. "I have no way to prepare my children for what
might happen to me or what might come next. Everything is in God's
hands."</TE>
<TE>   Nahmias' exhibit is a result of five months of research and some
unlikely partnerships with several farm-worker advocacy groups.</TE>
<TE>   Nahmias received about one-third of the project's $20,000 cost
from the Kurz Family Foundation and the Center for Latino Policy
Research at UC Berkeley. Outreach workers at California Rural Legal
Assistance, a nonprofit consortium of lawyers, helped gain access to
the farm workers, and eventually kicked in money too.</TE>
<TE>   Santos Gomez, directing attorney at the CRLA Oxnard office, saw
Nahmias' project as a chance to portray migrant workers in a way that
would capture both the harshness and dignity of their lives.</TE>
<TE>   "This had a direct connection to us and to what CRLA is all
about," Gomez said. "The general public has a fairly limited
understanding of farm working conditions. It's important to see
images that portray farm workers in a proud and dignified manner."</TE>
<TE>   The legal aide group hopes to bring the exhibit to Ventura County
soon, and to the other 21 counties where it has offices. The law
group has agreed to buy two sets of the photographs.</TE>
<TE>   Nahmias said the project stemmed from his desire to combine art
with social issues.</TE>
<TE>   "No matter how far we advance as a society, this is a segment of
the population that basically feeds us," he said. "But it's
invariably one of the most cast-off and forgotten."</TE>
<TE>   In one of Nahmias' photos, several women are standing outside a
bus in the middle of the night, about to begin another long day.</TE>
<TE>   "They weren't moping, they weren't resentful in any way," he said.
"They were proud of their work."</TE>
<TE>   They were women like Maura Salazar, 48, of Lamont. The former farm
laborer is now a community worker with Lideres Campesinas, a
farm-worker advocacy organization based in Pomona. She's inspired by
the pictures.</TE>
<TE>   "I saw those photos, and I wanted to work even harder for my
women," Salazar said. "A lot of these women, including me at one
time, think they can never achieve anything. But little by little,
we're all learning."</TE>

<HD>Simon and Davis Rally the Troops</HD>
<DH>Adopting partisan tones in Southland campaign stops, both
candidates for governor encourage faithful supporters to get out the
vote.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The two men vying for the California governor's office appealed to
their stalwart backers Saturday, as Republican nominee Bill Simon Jr.
laid out his conservative platform for Asian American supporters and
Gov. Gray Davis promised union members he would protect workers'
rights.</LD>
<LD>   Each of the candidates adopted strikingly partisan tones with
about two weeks to go until election day. As they reached out to
their bases, Davis and Simon exhorted supporters to go to the polls
and defeat expectations of a low voter turnout.</LD>
<LD>   "We've got 17 days left until November the 5th, and we need your
help," Simon told about 100 Asian American community leaders
assembled for a morning meeting at a golf resort in the City of
Industry. "Can you get out the vote? Can you get your friends out to
vote? Can you give us a hand? I think it's going to be a close
election, and I know we can put it over the top if we have your
help."</LD>
<TE>   The investment manager said that, if elected, he would work to cut
the capital gains tax and slash regulations that he said are
burdensome and driving businesses from the state. The GOP candidate
also promised to reform schools by making accountability mandatory.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't have enough money going into our classrooms," Simon
said. "We are spending plenty of money on bureaucrats and social
experiments, and I think that should stop."</TE>
<TE>   The Republican nominee said that the governor has failed to
improve the state's business climate and education system. More
broadly, Simon argued that what he sees as Davis' failures are
symptomatic of a larger character issue: Davis, according to his
rival, is so consumed by politics that he has failed to act in the
state's interest.</TE>
<TE>   "He never really has been a governor; he's been a full-time
fund-raiser," Simon said. "He's a politician who cares only about his
reelection."</TE>
<TE>   The enthusiastic audience cheered loudly, especially when the
candidate promised to include Asian Americans in key appointments and
to work to strengthen trade with the Pacific Rim.</TE>
<TE>   "Bill Simon is the candidate who best reflects the values that we
hold," said Mei Mei Ho, a business consultant in Industry and Simon
campaign volunteer. "Getting him elected is not just good for Asians,
but good for the whole state."</TE>
<TE>   Kim Wang, a real estate broker from Torrance, said she believes
many Asian Americans share the Republican outlook on business,
education and family values. Once she met Simon, she said, she was
even more excited about his campaign.</TE>
<TE>   "You find him to be a really honest, sincere, caring
non-politician," Wang said.</TE>
<TE>   An hour later, about 300 members of organized labor gathered in a
union hall in Gardena to cheer Davis and other Democratic candidates
for statewide offices. Lawn signs touting various candidates dangled
from the ceiling in the half-full hall, and a blues band performed as
labor members munched on barbecued ribs and sausages.</TE>
<TE>   "Labor is the backbone of this country, and we've been put down
for so long," said Peter Martyniuk, head of the International Union
of Painters and Allied Trades Local 1595, which represents painters
and drywall finishers. Davis "is an amazing man," he said. "All he
cares about is what's good for California and what's good for the
working families."</TE>
<TE>   Before Davis spoke, an array of union leaders and officials
praised his record on labor issues and warned that Simon would try to
reverse many worker protections.</TE>
<TE>   "This governor has done more than any other Democratic governor in
California to protect working men and women," said former state Sen.
Art Torres.</TE>
<TE>   Added Bob Balgenorth, an official with the building trades unions:
"Simon says he would do away with every issue that means anything to
working men and women."</TE>
<TE>   When he addressed the crowd, Davis recited a list of labor-backed
bills he has signed into law, including those to restore the
eight-hour work day, increase workers' compensation benefits and
establish the first paid family leave law. Simon opposed all three of
those bills.</TE>
<TE>   "All the good work we have done and all of the progress we have
made is at risk," the governor warned.</TE>
<TE>   The Democratic governor said that, even though he is ahead in most
polls, union members need to encourage others to vote. "Polls don't
vote," Davis said. "People vote."</TE>
<TE>   "I am just the vehicle," he said. "This is not about me. This is
about what kind of future you want."</TE>
<TE>   The candidates did find something to agree on. They similarly
dodged questions about the other contest claiming the attention of
Californians: the World Series matchup between the San Francisco
Giants and the Anaheim Angels.</TE>
<TE>   When asked who he was rooting for, Simon responded with a grin:
"The underdog." He refused to elaborate.</TE>
<TE>   Davis also avoided picking sides.</TE>
<TE>   "Whoever wins, it's a great story," he said. "I'm the governor, so
I know I'm going to be drinking champagne someplace."</TE>

<HD>Victims Get Aid From Lawyers in Training</HD>
<DH>At USC's Domestic Violence Clinic, women find legal help
while students gain trial skills.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jose Cardenas</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For more than 20 years, a Los Angeles woman says, she endured
physical, verbal and sexual abuse by her husband.</LD>
<LD>   When she finally went to the police last year, she embarked on the
legal trek, often an expensive one, that victims of domestic violence
must take to escape their batterers.</LD>
<LD>   The woman, supporting several children, couldn't afford private
lawyers. But one attorney led her to USC Law School's Domestic
Violence Clinic, which offers free legal services to desperate
victims.</LD>
<TE>   Now, two law students supervised by their professor are
representing her. First, they're trying to get a civil restraining
order and child support.</TE>
<TE>   The students, Amanda Airo and Jocelyn Riedl, and student social
worker Cynthia Armstrong are playing a crucial role in helping the
woman (whom The Times is not identifying to protect her safety)
rebuild her life.</TE>
<TE>   "Their initial response was that they were concerned for my safety
and my family," the woman said. "That was really important to me --
that they took notice of that."</TE>
<TE>   The Domestic Violence Clinic aims to provide the community with a
badly needed service, said director Kathryn Vaclavik, a USC assistant
clinical professor of law who supervises the students in court.</TE>
<TE>   Free legal service is important, Vaclavik said, because batterers
often initiate costly legal proceedings to frighten women with the
possibility of losing custody of their children.</TE>
<TE>   The cases also give the law students their first crack at
presenting arguments in court and citing case law to a judge.</TE>
<TE>   "Most of law school is very theoretical, and the clinic allows me
to get practical experience in trying cases," said Paul Levin, 27, a
third-year law student. "At the same time, I'm able to [make] a huge
difference in our clients' lives."</TE>
<TE>   Law students, under the supervision of a professor, are legally
allowed to represent clients in court. Several schools around the
country have similar clinics, said Vaclavik, who worked at one at
Georgetown University.</TE>
<TE>   USC's clinic, just out of its pilot stage, already has helped
dozens of women from the L.A. area, according to the university. It's
unusual, Vaclavik said, in its multi-disciplinary approach.</TE>
<TE>   While law students handle the legal work, students from USC's
school of social work help the women obtain social services.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the women have been referred by the Violence Intervention
Program at County-USC hospital in Boyle Heights.</TE>
<TE>   This approach tries to deal with a victim's full situation.</TE>
<TE>   "We may be representing her in a child custody case or a
restraining order," said Vaclavik. But "she has to deal with, where
is she going to go in the immediate future? She may need therapy. Her
children may need therapy with having been exposed to violence."</TE>
<TE>   The clinic specializes in representing women both in family and
dependency court, Vaclavik said. In the first, the domestic violence
victims are battling their spouses for custody of children. In the
second, they are battling the state.</TE>
<TE>   Vaclavik said the clinic takes the most complicated cases because
other over-burdened legal service agencies in the community won't.
But for the law students, the cases make perfect learning challenges.</TE>
<TE>   "They involve more litigation, court time and counsel on the other
side of the case," Vaclavik said. "That gives the student lawyers the
opportunity to really practice."</TE>
<TE>   The cases also offer the law students -- who don't necessarily
want to practice this sort of law after graduation -- the
satisfaction of helping women in desperate situations.</TE>
<TE>   "It's very satisfying," said Riedl, 24, a second-year law student.
"It's a group of people that often have a hard time finding legal
representation. It's very expensive."</TE>
<TE>   Working with the woman battered for 20 years has been rewarding,
she said.</TE>
<TE>   "She is very intelligent," Riedl said. "Sometimes it's hard to
reconcile a story that is so horrible with a person that is strong
and capable.... When people get into a situation like that, it could
happen to anyone."</TE>
<TE>   The woman, who like her children is in therapy, said she wonders
how she survived.</TE>
<TE>   "I never filed a police report because I was very much afraid to
do so," she said. "I felt like I was in prison all those years."</TE>
<TE>   Though she's still seeking child custody, a restraining order and
eventually divorce, her life and her children's lives are brighter,
she said.</TE>
<TE>   During her marriage, she said, her husband sometimes prohibited
the children from speaking to her. Now, she and the children go to
movies or the museum or play miniature golf.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel liberated," she said. "I'm doing things I never did
before."</TE>

<HD>Hospital Investigated After Sexual Assaults</HD>
<DH>West Hills psychiatric center where two girls were attacked
is focus of allegations.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Richard Fausset</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Prompted by two separate sexual assault cases involving 13-year-old
patients, the Los Angeles County Department of Mental Health is
conducting an investigation into allegations of other sexual
misconduct at a West Hills psychiatric hospital, officials said.</LD>
<LD>   The investigation of Pine Grove Hospital began after a girl was
raped Aug. 13 by a 17-year-old male patient at the private facility,
said David Meyer, chief deputy director of the county mental health
agency. The investigation is expected to be completed within a month,
he said.</LD>
<LD>   "Ultimately, should we validate that there are patient-care
issues, we'll take vigorous action to protect people," Meyer said,
adding that the investigation is part of a broader review of the
80-bed hospital's entire operations.</LD>
<TE>   Pine Grove Administrator Larry McFarland declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   The teenage boy arrested in the rape case has pleaded guilty to
one count of a lewd act with a child and is scheduled to be sentenced
Oct. 30.</TE>
<TE>   In an inspection conducted after the assault, the state Department
of Health Services determined that no one was monitoring the hallways
of the adolescent unit, allowing the boy to enter the girl's room
unnoticed, a violation of the hospital's own policy, according to
department documents.</TE>
<TE>   The hospital has since ordered its staff to adhere to the rules
and has separated male and female patients in its adolescent unit,
according to state records.</TE>
<TE>   In August 2000, another 13-year-old girl was sexually molested by
Pine Grove employee Quincy Crawford, 28. He is serving a three-year
prison term for his conviction on charges of performing lewd acts
with a minor.</TE>
<TE>   That incident also prompted changes at Pine Grove. Male staff
members were banned from working with adolescent girls with a history
of sexual problems and prohibited from escorting young girls without
a female staffer present, according to hospital documents. More
detailed employee background checks and orientation programs also
were adopted.</TE>
<TE>   Prior to the change in policy, two other male mental health
workers were accused of molesting Pine Grove patients in 2000,
according to hospital documents and sworn testimony produced in a
civil suit brought by the mother of Crawford's young victim.</TE>
<TE>   One of the employees was fired and the other resigned during
separate internal investigations, according to hospital documents and
depositions conducted with former employees in the civil suit.
Neither one was charged with a crime.</TE>
<TE>   In the lawsuit filed last year in Los Angeles Superior Court,
Crawford, Pine Grove and its Arizona-based parent company, Doctors
Community Healthcare Corp., are all named as defendants. It seeks
damages for negligence and emotional distress, and alleges the
hospital failed to conduct adequate background checks and training of
employees.</TE>
<TE>   The suit also contends the hospital failed to put a stop to the
incidents, even though administrators knew workers were "taking
advantage of female patients, including troubled girls."</TE>
<TE>   Richard Ryan, attorney for Pine Grove and its parent company,
denied the accusations. He declined further comment.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles attorney David Ring, who is representing the family of
Crawford's victim, said he is disturbed by allegations made by former
employees that the hospital encouraged intimate conversations between
adolescent patients and mental health workers with little
psychological training. He said this added to an unsafe atmosphere in
the adolescent unit.</TE>
<TE>   Crawford and the two employees suspected of molesting patients
were all classified as "mental health workers," according to
documents and depositions. These workers are unlicensed by the state
and their qualifications vary from institution to institution.</TE>
<TE>   At Pine Grove, they were not required to have a college degree,
according to the deposition of Christopher Luke Jackson, an assistant
nursing director fired in 2000 for failing to adequately supervise a
problem employee.</TE>
<TE>   Adolescents at the hospital were encouraged to engage these
workers in brief "staff talks," in which the patients discussed their
"feelings, emotions and problems," Jackson said. A successful talk
could help a patient earn privileges like TV time, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Ring's complaint alleges that the hospital took "inadequate steps
to educate and train [mental health workers like Crawford] to
recognize and control their emotional involvement with
child-patients."</TE>
<TE>   As a result, the suit contends that when the high school-educated
Crawford had sex with the 13-year-old in a hospital restroom Aug. 25,
2000, it was "an outgrowth of his fulfilling his duties and
responsibilities as a counselor/attendant."</TE>
<TE>   Three days after the Crawford incident, another teenage patient
told Pine Grove administrators that she had sex with one of
Crawford's co-workers, according to hospital documents. The hospital
contacted police and launched an investigation, and the employee was
eventually fired.</TE>
<TE>   The individual later filed a lawsuit for wrongful termination. The
case was settled out of court.</TE>
<TE>   The employee was not charged with a crime, because prosecutors
said the victim did not want to relive the incident and refused to
cooperate with the investigation, according to the district
attorney's records.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles Police Department detectives investigated a third
worker after he was accused of forcing a 49-year-old patient to
perform oral sex on him in April 2000, according to hospital
documents. Police records show semen was found on the victim's
clothing, but prosecutors said they had insufficient evidence to go
to trial.</TE>
<TE>   The worker resigned shortly after the incident. The woman who was
allegedly molested filed a civil suit against Pine Grove and Doctors
Community Healthcare Corp. in March 2001. The case has since been
settled, according to court records.</TE>

<HD>Hot Home Sales Cool Slightly in September</HD>
<DH>The median price of $333,000 is $2,000 below June's peak,
but figures are highest for the month since 1988. Surge is expected
to taper off.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Gregory W. Griggs</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The pace of Ventura County home sales has slowed from its summer
peak, but September figures released this week were the highest for
the month since the 1988 housing boom, and median prices still hover
at a third of a million dollars.</LD>
<LD>   "The September we have here is one of the strongest I have on
record," said analyst John Karevoll of DataQuick Information Systems,
which compiled the sales data for new and existing homes and
condominiums. "Prices will continue to go up, there's no doubt about
that. But prices probably won't continue to go up as fast as they
have been."</LD>
<LD>   The number of homes sold last month was 1,399, up 27 from
September 2001. The year-over-year median price was up 16% to
$333,000. The median is the point where half the homes sold for more
and half for less.</LD>
<TE>   But the September showing couldn't match a particularly robust
summer. In August, 299 more homes were sold than in September for a
median price $1,000 greater.</TE>
<TE>   And in the peak month of June, when 159 additional homes were
sold, the median price reached its highest level of the year at
$335,000.</TE>
<TE>   For the first nine months of 2002, more than 1,030 additional
homes and condos sold countywide than in the same period last year,
Karevoll said. The median price rose 17.2% since January, but is
expected to top out around $345,000 through the end of the year.</TE>
<TE>   The year-to-year price increase -- which has ranged from 10.1% to
24.3% so far in 2002 -- should begin to slow down in January,
Karevoll said.</TE>
<TE>   "I expect that to taper off by spring, down to about 10% to 12%,"
he said. "The extra surge the market got when interest rates went
down in the summer has almost played itself out."</TE>
<TE>   Sellers in Thousand Oaks, Moorpark and Oak Park realized steady
gains last month. The median price of an Oak Park residence was up
more than $104,000, or 27.1%, in 12 months to $489,000. Thousand Oaks
home prices jumped 14.9% to $455,000 and Moorpark prices rose 37.1%
to $380,000.</TE>
<TE>   The exclusive communities of Lake Sherwood and Westlake Village
sold four fewer houses last month than a year ago, but prices rose
more than 9% to $520,000.</TE>
<TE>   "It's still a strong seller's market," said Geoff Baker, president
of the Conejo Valley Assn. of Realtors, whose more than 1,100 members
sell property in Thousand Oaks, Oak Park, Westlake Village and Agoura
Hills. "It's fairly common to see multiple offers on nearly every
property that's out there."</TE>
<TE>   Though prices are likely to level off a bit, Baker said he does
not expect a drop in home values in the near future.</TE>
<TE>   In the west county, Camarillo home prices were up 24.8% to
$388,000, Ojai homes rose 21% to $381,250 and Port Hueneme prices
increased 40.8% to $250,250.</TE>
<TE>   Only two areas in the county experienced price declines in
September. Fillmore home prices fell 5.9% to $243,773 and in the
eastern portion of Simi Valley the median price dipped $3,500 to
$285,000.</TE>
<TE>   Broker Kay Wilson-Bolton, who operates Century 21 offices in
Fillmore, Santa Paula and Ojai, said some buyers have started to
reconsider entering an overheated market.</TE>
<TE>   "We're starting to see a little resistance from buyers," she said.
"They're either not qualifying for loans for the higher prices or
they're saying, 'This is crazy. We'll take a step back and see how
things are going.' "</TE>
<TE>   Wilson-Bolton, former president of the Coastal Assn. of Realtors,
which represents agents in six west county cities, said this last
year's rapid price increases come at a cost.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been at this 27 years and I've seen it like this before --
and it's just not healthy," she said. "A good steady [price] growth
is better.</TE>
<TE>   "People like to see the appreciation in their homes, but where are
they going to go? To capitalize on that growth they'd have to leave
the area, and that's not what most people want to do."</TE>

<HD>Man Seeks Court's Protection After Judge's Threat</HD>
<DH>L.A. County jurist said in child custody hearing that he
would kill his daughter's boyfriend.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jean Guccione</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A 41-year-old man is asking the court for protection from his
girlfriend's father, a Los Angeles County Superior Court judge who
testified during a bitter child custody hearing that he would kill
him. Judge James A. Kaddo testified in April that he would kill Fadi
Nora because he didn't want the man near his three young
grandchildren -- a remark the judge now says he regrets.</LD>
<LD>   "It was a stupid thing to say, but I was a grandfather in tears,"
said Kaddo, recounting the April 22 court hearing.</LD>
<LD>   Nora said the remark was just the latest threat that Kaddo has
made against him in the last two years.</LD>
<TE>   In court documents, Nora said he is so afraid of Kaddo that he
moved to an undisclosed location and quit attending services at his
church.</TE>
<TE>   "I live under a constant threat of death," he said in a
declaration filed last month in Orange County Superior Court.</TE>
<TE>   Nora, who is living with Kaddo's daughter, Nadia Yammine, is
asking the court to bar Kaddo from coming within 150 yards of him,
his home, his car or workplace. A hearing is scheduled for Oct. 25.</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles County district attorney's office declined last
month to file criminal charges against Kaddo, who was appointed to
the bench by then-Gov. George Deukmejian in 1991 and is now assigned
to Van Nuys.</TE>
<TE>   The 68-year-old jurist's statement is not considered an actual
threat "because the specific intent necessary to commit the crime is
lacking," the district attorney's investigation concluded. "Rather,
his statement appears to be an inappropriate emotional response to a
very charged issue."</TE>
<TE>   During the hearing, Kaddo urged Commissioner Ann Dobbs to deny his
daughter's bid for custody of her three children, now 8 to 13.</TE>
<TE>   He said he didn't want his grandchildren near Nora, a friend of
the Kaddo family for two decades until he began dating the judge's
daughter.</TE>
<TE>   Kaddo testified that he told Yammine: "I can't stand to have that
psycho around my grand kids. I'm going to do what I have to do to
save my grandchildren," according to a transcript of the hearing.</TE>
<TE>   On cross-examination, Yammine's attorney, Wendy A. Herzog, asked
Kaddo what he had meant.</TE>
<TE>   "If it means killing him, I will do it," the judge responded.</TE>
<TE>   "Killing who?" Herzog asked.</TE>
<TE>   "Mr. Nora," Kaddo answered.</TE>
<TE>   "Is there anything else that it could have meant?" she asked.</TE>
<TE>   "That's what I had in mind," Kaddo said.</TE>
<TE>   That's where the exchange ends in the court transcript. But Nora,
Yammine and Herzog contend the court reporter did not capture Kaddo's
final words on the subject. They assert in court documents, that
Kaddo also said, "And I would do it with my bare hands if I had to."</TE>
<TE>   Kaddo's attorney, Theodore A. Cohen of Beverly Hills, denied all
of the allegations against his client. He said the judge's testimony
was misinterpreted.</TE>
<TE>   "What he intended to say was that anybody would do whatever they
could to protect a child or grandchild," Cohen said. "He said what
any one of us would have said" under the same circumstances.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to seeking a restraining order against the judge, Nora
filed a complaint with the state Commission on Judicial Performance,
which investigates allegations of misconduct and disciplines errant
judges.</TE>
<TE>   No California judge has ever been publicly disciplined for
threatening to kill another person, according to commission records.
But an intemperate jurist was censured for threatening to jail a
telephone company worker if the judge's phone service was
interrupted. Another judge was removed from office for misconduct
that included threatening to give a police officer "a .38-[caliber]
vasectomy" after he cited the judge for excessive use of her car
horn.</TE>
<TE>   Yammine said in a declaration that the court should take the
threats her father made against Nora "very, very seriously."</TE>
<TE>   Nora and Yammine said their dispute with Kaddo began almost two
years earlier, when Nora, a family friend, helped Yammine with her
divorce from a wealthy Lebanese businessman. Kaddo wanted Yammine to
return to her husband.</TE>
<TE>   According to his declaration, Nora said the judge showed him four
tire valves a few days after the tires on his Jeep were deflated in
October 2000 in a secure garage, implying that the judge was
responsible.</TE>
<TE>   Kaddo, who once presided over a Compton courtroom, also threatened
to "get gang members that he has done favors for as a judge to harm
me," Nora said in court papers.</TE>
<TE>   And a month before the heated child custody hearing, Nora said he
received an anonymous call from someone who told him in Lebanese that
"my days were numbered."</TE>
<TE>   In court documents filed this week, Yammine accused her ex-husband
of having ties to the terrorist group, Hezbollah. She said her father
has sided with him in an effort to fulfill his political and business
aspirations in his homeland.</TE>
<TE>   Yammine also accused Kaddo of conspiring with her ex-husband to
keep her children, who are U.S. citizens, in Lebanon against her
will.</TE>
<TE>   Cohen denied the allegations against his client. "The whole thing
is just insanity," he said, noting that a Hezbollah sympathizer would
never retain a Jewish attorney to represent him.</TE>
<TE>   Yammine signed an agreement permitting her husband to raise their
children in Lebanon. When she tried to have the stipulation
overturned, her father testified against her, and she lost.</TE>
<TE>   Santa Ana-based attorney Richard C. Gilbert, who is representing
the couple, accused the justice system of giving Kaddo special
treatment because he is a judge.</TE>
<TE>   "That transcript is troubling," Gilbert said. "The commissioner
[Dobbs] does not report it to the Commission on Judicial Performance
or the police ... Instead, she just changes the subject."</TE>
<TE>   Gilbert said temporary restraining orders are routinely granted in
heated domestic situations like these. But Nora has been unable to
get such an order, he said, without retaining an attorney and
testifying in court with Kaddo present.</TE>
<TE>   "Could you imagine," Gilbert said, "what would happen if Mr. Nora
had threatened a Superior Court judge?"</TE>

alongside him, as he'd always been since childhood.</LD>
<LD>   "I felt his presence -- I felt my brother's spirit here," said
Webster, 40, as he joined 250 fellow surfers who turned out to pay
tribute to their comrade, who was killed in a terrorist attack in
Indonesia. "We loved the water ever since we were kids."</LD>
<LD>   Steven Webster was killed Oct. 12 in a car-bomb attack at a
nightclub on the island of Bali in Indonesia, where he'd gone on a
surfing trip with friends to celebrate his 41st birthday.</LD>
<TE>   "I spent the last moments of Webbie's life with him, and he didn't
suffer; he was happy until that moment," said friend William Steven
"Crabbie" Cabler.</TE>
<TE>   Cabler and Webster were at the Sari Club when the bomb exploded,
killing nearly 200 people. The bar was frequented by surfers from
around the world.</TE>
<TE>   Cabler sat in a wheelchair for the memorial on an overcast
Saturday on the sandy shore wearing eyeshades and a long-sleeved
flannel shirt, watching the flotilla of long boards and short boards
dotting the waves.</TE>
<TE>   "From this moment on, this should not be a time of mourning, but a
celebration of life," said Cabler, who suffered a broken shoulder, an
injured eardrum and third-degree burns in the explosion. His hands
were still in bandages.</TE>
<TE>   Sobs rang out amid the crashing waves as about 350 friends, family
members and onlookers gathered for an hourlong ceremony accompanied
by live music, singing, poetry, laughs and "Webbie" surf tales.</TE>
<TE>   "Paddle outs" are surfers' traditional way of mourning the loss of
a fellow rider. And so it was Saturday that the surfers swam off the
52nd Street jetty, known among friends as "Webster's Hole," one of
Steve Webster's favorite spots.</TE>
<TE>   They paddled in pairs, then formed an outer circle and an inner
circle around a surfing pastor. Bobbing in the waves, the band of
surfers began chanting "Webbie, Webbie" and waving thumb and pinkie
fingers to the sky. "It's a Hawaiian thing" that means "Hang loose,"
the surfers explained.</TE>
<TE>   After a 20-minute ceremony, the circles of surfers drifted
together. A plane towed a banner that read "Webster's Boys!"</TE>
<TE>   Close friend Kelly Walker recited a poem she helped write: "Cross
over to the other shore, surf, in peace, forevermore.... Go now
Steven, find the light. We'll miss you, our friend."</TE>
<TE>   Webster's tearful stepdaughter Samantha, who stood beside her
mother and Webster's son Dylan, told the crowd, "If there's one thing
you can do for my dad, I just want you all to smile at least once
today in his memory."</TE>
<TE>   His friends also hope to create a memorial at the 52nd Street
jetty, where they hope to scatter his ashes.</TE>
<TE>   Webster, a waiter at the Rusty Pelican, was so affable that he was
nicknamed "Insta-Bro." The friends became lifelong companions with
whom he would golf, surf, fish and share his day's catch. They said
he weaved tall and small tales with the same ease that he threaded
the waves.</TE>
<TE>   "Steve was a guy we could always rely on to tell us how unreal the
surf was the day we didn't check the waves ... and how he even
surprised himself when he pulled off that move on that one wave,"
wrote Lisa Coutts from Honolulu in a letter read to the crowd.</TE>
<TE>   Other mourners offered words of anger and hope.</TE>
<TE>   "We're saddened by this senseless act," said friend Felipe
Bascope, reading from a prepared speech.</TE>
<TE>   "Yeah, from the surf to his hole-in-ones on the golf course, he
could talk a mean story, that's for sure."</TE>

<HD>Cheap Seats, Almost Inside the Stadium</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Tim Newtson arrived early to secure his place at the World Series. At
9 a.m. Saturday, he parked his rented motor home outside Edison
Field, and when the gates opened he pulled it under the Big Red A and
set the parking brake.</LD>
<LD>   His plan worked -- for $40, he had the best seat outside the
house.</LD>
<LD>   "This is the spot I wanted," said the 27-year-old from Fullerton,
who was joined later by about 20 friends lugging a grill, food and
drink. "I just wanted to be here with the crowd."</LD>
<TE>   The action at Game 1 of the World Series wasn't all on the field
and in the stands. Plenty was happening in the Edison Field parking
lot, where hundreds of people without tickets traded the comfort of
home for a slab of asphalt and a chance to be at least close to
history.</TE>
<TE>   The lot began filling up four hours before the first pitch was
thrown. By 3 p.m., the smell of carne asada, burgers and chicken
mingled with the sound of booming hip-hop music and the buzz of
airplanes and helicopters overhead.</TE>
<TE>   With tickets going anywhere from $400 to more than $1,000 on the
street, the parking lot was the deal of the day. A carload cost you
$10, motor homes $40. But if you wanted to spread out, like Danny
Frechette did -- he commandeered 10 spaces for his 31-foot rolling
tailgate headquarters, a pickup truck, a grill, two tables, a dozen
lawn chairs and a 27-inch TV -- no one seemed to mind.</TE>
<TE>   "It's fun to be out in the parking lot. It's the atmosphere," said
Frechette, 39, of Bellflower. "Everybody's excited. Everybody's
wearing red. Everybody's screaming. There's no better place to be."</TE>
<TE>   Well, maybe inside. Frechette and his friend, Noah Musser, bought
tickets to today's game on EBay.</TE>
<TE>   It set them back $750 -- a lot more than the keg they covered with
a blanket Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   "It took me a couple of days to rationalize it," Musser said of
the ticket purchase.</TE>
<TE>   "The way I look at it, I've been a halo fan all my life and I
don't know whether something like this will ever happen again. It's
for the memories."</TE>
<TE>   Mike and Susan Lombardo looked into getting tickets to Saturday's
game, but the price of being inside turned them away.</TE>
<TE>   So they settled for outside. The Garden Grove couple brought their
11-year-old son and his friend to the parking lot, plopped a
satellite dish on the roof of their pickup and a small television on
an overturned bucket.</TE>
<TE>   "We're campers, so we rough it all the time," Susan Lombardo said
as the two boys spray-painted their hair red.</TE>
<TE>   "Rough" is a word that aptly describes 18-year-old Bradley
Burtness' pickup. Nicknamed "White Lightning," the dented rust bucket
sported a giant stuffed monkey on its roof and a series of bullet
holes on one side.</TE>
<TE>   "West Hollywood," Burtness explained. "Scuffle over a parking
spot."</TE>
<TE>   But the truck's battery works, and that's all that was needed to
help power the TV that he and about a dozen friends watched during
the game.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't have $800 for a ticket. So we got out the ... tube and
came here," Burtness said. "We're chillin'."</TE>
<TE>   As game time approached, Frechette, his friends and their children
gathered outside the mobile home, doffed their hats and sang the
national anthem. They whooped at the fireworks. They screamed when a
military stealth aircraft flew over the stadium, banked and came
right over them in a salute that seemed designed just for fans in the
parking lot.</TE>
<TE>   "That's why we're here," 34-year-old Darrell Denning said. "That's
hot!"</TE>

<HD>Donors Put Stranded Sailor Back on Course</HD>
<DH>After his rescue, Rich Van Pham has another boat and is the
toast of Ventura Harbor.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>David Kelly</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Disaster has been very good to Rich Van Pham. A few weeks ago, the
62-year-old itinerant sailor was drifting helplessly off the coast of
Costa Rica, mast broken, sails shredded and faith ebbing.</LD>
<LD>   "I prayed for a quick death," he said.</LD>
<LD>   Now, very much alive, Pham sits aboard his new 25-foot sloop in
Ventura Harbor, discussing the healing benefits of boiled sea turtle
and roasted sea gull.</LD>
<TE>   An unopened copy of "Practical Sailing" sits beside a donated
global positioning system that baffles a man more accustomed to
ragged maps and compasses.</TE>
<TE>   "For four months I see no one," he said, sitting in the cramped
boat. "I have a new life, everyone wants to talk to me. I have no
plans to go anywhere, I will relax here for awhile."</TE>
<TE>   Since being rescued last month from his battered vessel floating
off Costa Rica, Pham has been showered with offers of aid from around
the world.</TE>
<TE>   The boat was a gift from Erwin Freund, a bioengineer at Amgen in
Thousand Oaks. Hotel rooms, flights, clothing and navigation
equipment have also been donated to Pham, who appears simultaneously
grateful and puzzled by it all.</TE>
<TE>   "I think they are interested in the story, not in me," he said. So
far, nothing about Pham's murky background or memory lapses about
past scrapes with the law seems to have dampened the public's
enthusiasm for him.</TE>
<TE>   Law enforcement records show the Vietnamese immigrant was arrested
three times in the last 17 years on suspicion of felonies that
include aggravated battery and marijuana possession in Texas,
California and Florida. No charges were ever filed and details of the
case were not available.</TE>
<TE>   "The arrests don't make me change my mind, he was not prosecuted,
he didn't spend a day in jail," said 49-year-old Freund of Camarillo.</TE>
<TE>   Freund felt strongly enough to donate his boat, which he was
selling for $4,400, to Pham.</TE>
<TE>   "I figured this guy deserves it," he said. "He appeals to our
alter ego. I'd like to be carefree and sailing. He's living the way
I'd like to."</TE>
<TE>   Doug Warner, a talent agent in Encino, said Pham's story is a
natural for a movie-of-the-week or a cable docudrama. All the
elements, he said, are there: a boat person who ends up living on a
boat, man against nature, homelessness and the Vietnam War.</TE>
<TE>   "It's what Tom Hanks did in 'Castaway,' it's Robinson Crusoe on a
boat," Warner said. "I would think someone like Jackie Chan would
take an interest in developing this project the way Spike Lee would
develop a story about a kid coming up from Harlem."</TE>
<TE>   Pham's new home occupies a prime slip in Ventura Harbor and has
five sails, a radio, flares, television, VCR and small bedroom. He
apologizes for the clutter and draws a curtain over his ruffled
sleeping quarters.</TE>
<TE>   "When Erwin showed me the boat I loved it," he said. "Now I need
to find a [permanent] place to put it."</TE>
<TE>   Pham has remained an enigma since the McClusky, a Navy narcotics
interdiction frigate, found him last month floating 350 miles off
Costa Rica. He had left Long Beach Harbor in his 26-foot-boat, Sea
Breeze, for a 22-mile jaunt to Santa Catalina Island. But high winds
snapped his mast, his radio failed and he drifted for 2,500 miles,
living for 120 days by his wits and off the bounty of the sea.</TE>
<TE>   It was a compelling story, and when he returned to America he was
an instant media star, though not without detractors.</TE>
<TE>   "Why is someone as incompetent as him getting such recognition for
being a screw-up?" asked Steven Bien, a veteran long distance sailor
from Los Angeles. "His story seems a little farfetched."</TE>
<TE>   Pham, a slightly built man with a deep tan, smiles at such
comments. "People find it hard to believe," he said. "I understand
that."</TE>
<TE>   Born to a Buddhist father and Catholic mother in Vung Tau, a port
city in southern Vietnam, Pham said he was a mechanic on local
fishing boats as a young man.</TE>
<TE>   During the Vietnam War, Pham served in the local militia guarding
bridges and ports from Viet Cong infiltrators.</TE>
<TE>   In 1975, the North Vietnamese army rolled into Saigon, defeating
the south and sending hundreds of thousands of people fleeing in
flimsy boats across the South China Sea.</TE>
<TE>   Pham and some friends sailed a fishing boat to Thailand, a journey
of 10 days.</TE>
<TE>   After winning refugee status in the U.S., Pham moved to the gritty
mill town of Holyoke, Mass., where he worked as an auto mechanic.</TE>
<TE>   "The snow was too high in Massachusetts," he said. "I went to
Hollywood. I saved my money and opened three furniture stores. I
didn't get rich, but it was OK. My plan was to save money and open a
car dealership and a furniture store -- those were the two things I
knew."</TE>
<TE>   Pham said he sold furniture and delivered it himself the same day.</TE>
<TE>   But 10 years ago, he said, he was involved in a car accident that
left him in a coma for six months at an El Monte hospital. Officials
at the Greater El Monte Community Hospital said they could not
release information on whether Pham had been there or not.</TE>
<TE>   "I wake up and my brain is blank, there is no picture in my
brain," he said. "I couldn't speak English anymore. I didn't know how
to pay a bus driver. But day by day I remember more."</TE>
<TE>   With minimal insurance, Pham's savings were depleted by medical
bills. He survived on disability checks and bounced around the
country by bus, living in parks and the occasional apartment. He says
he can't recall his contacts with law enforcement but said being
homeless often meant dealing with dangerous people.</TE>
<TE>   Pham eventually wound up living on a boat in Long Beach.</TE>
<TE>   "I would sometimes go out a few hundred miles and let the current
take me. I went to Panama and Mexico," he said. "I'd go to the port
and talk to people, buy something and go."</TE>
<TE>   He expanded his journeys, he said, traveling down the coast of
South America.</TE>
<TE>   "When you are on the ocean, the first week you are tired," he said
dreamily. "The second week you like it and the third week you love
it."</TE>
<TE>   A few months ago he left for Catalina Island. At some point during
the trip a cable snapped and the mast collapsed. The Sea Breeze began
drifting aimlessly, heading nowhere.</TE>
<TE>   He drank rainwater collected in his sails. When a sea turtle
surfaced, he paddled quietly toward it. "I tie it up until I need to
eat," he said. "Turtle meat makes you strong, confident."</TE>
<TE>   Pham fell into a languid life of drifting, sleeping during the day
and emerging at dusk. Whales sometimes erupted from the deep before
crashing back into the sea. Sharks tore into dolphins off his bow.
Hundreds of seabirds staked out every available inch of the vessel.</TE>
<TE>   On Sept. 17 the Navy spotted the Sea Breeze. "The mast was broken
down, sea gulls were all over it. They were the only signs of life,"
said Capt. Gary Parriot, the ship's commanding officer. "He heard us
and came out waving. He was distraught at the prospect of losing his
home and was convinced he could sail back to Long Beach."</TE>
<TE>   Parriot told him the ship was dangerous and had to be scuttled.</TE>
<TE>   "He lost his home and everything he had," said Parriot.
"Obviously, it's an incredible story. We asked how this could be, but
there was nothing that caused us to doubt him. From the condition of
the boat it was obvious he was at sea for awhile."</TE>
<TE>   The mysterious refugee from Vietnam was a refugee again, and his
story touched a chord with many.</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes you read something and it just grabs you," said Vance
Vaughan of Woodland Hills. "I am married to a Vietnamese woman who
was a boat person. For a guy to come here and learn English and then
lose it all really struck a note."</TE>
<TE>   Phillip Nguyen of Tustin wanted to donate $1,000. "I want to help
him get on his feet, find a job," said the Cal Fed loan officer.
"Lots of us ended up with no family or friends because of the war. I
don't want to dig up his past, he's not a politician. When someone
needs help, you help."</TE>
<TE>   Jerry Pool, owner of Larry Dudley Yacht Sales in Ventura Harbor,
is letting Pham keep his boat in his dock for awhile.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought this was really bizarre when I heard it," Pool said. "I
had red flags going up all over the place. But when you talk to him
you realize he doesn't have a dishonest bone in his body. He seems to
draw people to him."</TE>
<TE>   Pham doesn't know his next move. He disappears for days at a time
before returning. He says he may sail down to San Diego or Oceanside.
"If you travel on the sea you love it," he said. "Water, sea and
yourself--that's the best, that's No. 1."</TE>

<HD>Search for Rapist of Girl, 14, Continues</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Wendy Thermos</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Police continued their search Saturday for a man who abducted and
raped a teenage girl on her way to school a day earlier in Panorama
City.</LD>
<LD>   "It is a very serious case," Los Angeles Police Department
spokesman Jack Richter said. "On any given day, thousands of kids are
on the streets at that hour. If this guy did this once, he'll do it
again."</LD>
<LD>   Investigators were attempting to put together a sketch of the
rapist but said they had no suspects.</LD>
<TE>   The 14-year-old girl was walking in the 9000 block of Willis
Avenue between 6:30 and 7 a.m. when a stranger drove up and pointed
what appeared to be a handgun at her, police said.</TE>
<TE>   The man ordered the girl into his car and drove her to an alley
about two blocks away, where he raped her, according to the police
report. The girl told investigators he then allowed her to walk away.</TE>
<TE>   She described the man as Asian, 20 to 23 years old, weighing 120
pounds with black hair and driving a white, two-door Honda.</TE>
<TE>   Richter said investigators are giving extra scrutiny to the case
because of the victim's age and the man's use of a gun or a simulated
weapon to frighten the girl into getting into his car. Detectives
from a special assault unit in the LAPD's robbery-homicide bureau
have been assigned to the case. Authorities said the girl was
hospitalized.</TE>

<HD>Big City Stretches a Small Council</HD>
<DH>Frustration over size of districts gives an issue to
secessionists. Even some opponents of breakup agree they're too
large.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Nita Lelyveld</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the official voter's guide to the Nov. 5 election, advocates of
both Hollywood and San Fernando Valley independence cite a key reason
they think Los Angeles should be broken into pieces: The City
Council's members, they say, have districts so large that they cannot
begin to represent them adequately.</LD>
<LD>   Each of the 15 council members represents nearly 250,000 people,
far more than council members in any other American city. A council
district can include residents of so many cultures and points of view
that it is impossible for one person to be accountable to them all,
secessionists say.</LD>
<LD>   New York, with a little more than twice the population of Los
Angeles, has more than three times as many council members: 51.
Chicago, with nearly 1 million fewer people, has 50. Phoenix, the
city that comes closest to Los Angeles' ratio, still has 81,000 fewer
people per council member.</LD>
<TE>   Frustration with the size of council districts is a driving force
in the secession movement. Backers of the breakup say council members
cannot possibly know their vast districts intimately enough to tackle
problems efficiently.</TE>
<TE>   Size, they add, has bred a sense of remoteness, encouraging the
council to see itself as something apart from the neighborhoods it
represents and encouraging residents of those neighborhoods to
disengage from civic life. It's hard to engage, after all, when just
getting to a council meeting can mean an hour's drive, some residents
say.</TE>
<TE>   Under the secession proposals, a new Valley city would have 14
council members, each representing about 95,000 people, and an
independent Hollywood of about 183,000 would have five council
members elected at large, or one representative per 37,000 people.</TE>
<TE>   The city's promises of reform do little to soothe. Los Angeles
first got 15 council members in 1878, when it was still a farm town
of 10,000 people.</TE>
<TE>   The number of council members shrank for a while to nine, but it
never grew beyond 15, said James W. Ingram III, a political scientist
at San Diego State University.</TE>
<TE>   Today, the population is about 380 times what it was 124 years
ago, edging toward 4 million, but the size of the council remains
unchanged.</TE>
<TE>   Those who oppose secession argue that size does not dictate
quality. They say secessionists' cozier councils, with part-time
members living next to those they represent, could not deliver
without ample staff and finances.</TE>
<TE>   But some prominent secession opponents say the criticisms are
valid and that the council needs to grow.</TE>
<TE>   Assemblywoman Jackie Goldberg (D-Los Angeles), served two terms as
a Los Angeles city councilwoman and opposes secession. But she agrees
that districts are too large.</TE>
<TE>   "I think that, at some point, you just get too big to be
manageable. I think we long exceeded that here."</TE>
<TE>   As a councilwoman, Goldberg was known for activism in her
district, which included Silver Lake, Echo Park and part of
Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   Three of her staff members spent all their time out in the
district, helping community groups to organize meetings and
articulate their concerns. To reach the district's diverse
population, she hired aides who spoke Tagalog, Spanish and Armenian.
She and her staff drove different routes each day to work, combing
the area looking for potholes and dumped couches.</TE>
<TE>   But even so, Goldberg acknowledges, they could not keep a constant
eye on the whole territory. And even though her district was one of
the smaller ones, so many people competed for her attention that she
usually couldn't visit any one community group more than once.</TE>
<TE>   "We were knocking ourselves out, and we still felt like we
scratched the surface," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Secessionists offer a more intimate version of government, in
which council members would hold night meetings that all could
attend.</TE>
<TE>   Council members in smaller districts, they say, would run into
residents at the diner or the supermarket. They'd learn about
problems quickly.</TE>
<TE>   Assemblyman Keith Richman (R-Northridge), who is running for
Valley mayor, said there's a term for what happens when people
realize there's no way for them to play a meaningful role in their
government: rational ignorance. People decide it's rational to be
ignorant about their government. Many Angelenos feel that way because
they can't get to council meetings, and their representatives spend
more time at City Hall than with them, Richman said.</TE>
<TE>   "What happens is that, after a point in time, they give up and
say, 'You can't fight City Hall.' When people feel that way, that's
how you get independence movements."</TE>
<TE>   "A more local government allows people to become involved. It
empowers them to become involved with their governments and to help
effect change in their communities."</TE>
<TE>   Secessionists also say they would have a leaner, more efficient
government. Their council members, at least at first, would be paid
only $12,000 a year, a far cry from Los Angeles council members'
salaries of $136,000. Unless voters approved more spending for
salaries of council members and others, the new councils' budgets
would allow for little staff, let alone big bureaucracy.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles council members usually have more than a dozen staff
members apiece. Each of the 15 representatives has an annual budget
of around $1 million to pay for field offices and staff members who
can show up at community meetings and pound away at solving
residents' problems.</TE>
<TE>   The council members' salaries are the nation's highest, a fact
secessionists decry, but are meant to give the officials freedom to
work full time on city problems.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no doubt it's a lot of work. It's a 24-7 job," said
council newcomer Wendy Greuel, who represents a portion of the
Valley, adding that she's talking not just about her own work, but
also about that of her staff of 18. Greuel said she spends a lot of
time out in the district, recruiting volunteers to help her scout
potholes and abandoned cars. She's also told downtown department
heads that she expects them to fix such problems quickly. Government
must be much more responsive, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's all about priorities and having the community work with
you," she said, adding that even though she has too many constituents
to spend time with them all, "A lot of people don't care if they meet
me at all. Ninety percent of the people in the city just want the job
done."</TE>
<TE>   Other cities have dealt with growth by expanding their city
councils. Just a little over a decade ago, New York added 16 council
seats.</TE>
<TE>   But James Svara, a North Carolina State University political
scientist and an expert on city government, said increasing the size
of the council to make smaller districts can be a trade-off. Council
members, he said, have two roles: one of governance, helping to
determine the direction of the city, and the other of representation,
hearing from constituents and channeling those views into policy.</TE>
<TE>   "The larger the council gets, the more they can fulfill the
representative role, but the harder it is to function as a group," he
said. "Also, when you have smaller districts, they tend to be more
homogeneous. You have to figure out how to aggregate those 30 or 40
or 50 voices being articulated. It can be very hard to pull them
together."</TE>
<TE>   In large councils, strong political factions can end up running
the show, often making it harder for specific communities to get
heard, he said. Mayors, too, can step between competing factions and
forge a more powerful role for themselves.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Goldberg said she believes doubling the council's size
would make sense.</TE>
<TE>   Erwin Chemerinsky, the USC constitutional law professor who led
the city's elected charter commission, is also adamant that some
increase is necessary.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no doubt that the Los Angeles City Council desperately
needs to be larger. I think many of the complaints of the Valley
secessionists could best be answered by having smaller council
districts," he said.</TE>
<TE>   If secession fails Nov. 5, he said, supporters should back the
idea of a larger council.</TE>
<TE>   But Chemerinsky knows firsthand the difficulties that such a
proposal would confront. For every person angry that government seems
remote, there is another who complains that it is too big and
expensive. Sometimes, in fact, people hold both views at once.</TE>
<TE>   In 1999, Chemerinsky and others rewriting the city's charter
wanted to expand the council, but couldn't agree on a size. They also
feared that opponents of expanding the government could sink the
entire charter reform effort.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, voters were given three proposals: one to enact a new
charter, and two to expand the council (to either 21 or 25 members).</TE>
<TE>   The charter passed, but 63% of voters opposed the measure to
expand the council to 21 members, and 65% voted against 25 members.
The margins against the expansions were high in the Valley, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd like to think it was because of confusion in having two
competing measures. But I don't really believe that," Chemerinsky
said.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the real problem was the unpopularity of adding to the
size of government and persuading people to pay more. It's a hard
sell."</TE>

<LD>Troop leader June Cleaver in a starched green shirtdress -- it's an
enduring yet outdated and disabling image that Girl Scouts of the USA
is taking bold steps to replace for the survival of the 90-year-old
institution.</LD>
<LD>   Girls by the millions -- 2.8 million, to be exact -- still want to
be Scouts. It's just that their moms and other women can't or won't
lead troops.</LD>
<LD>   Adult role models shepherding girls toward good citizenship and
success are the cornerstone of the organization founded in 1912. And
the dearth of such volunteers, especially among the country's growing
Asian and Latino populations, threatens to cripple it.</LD>
<TE>   As 15,000 Girl Scouts and volunteers gather at the Long Beach
Convention Center through today for their national convention,
strategies for attracting Latina volunteers ages 18 and older will be
central to policies delegates will consider. "We are involved in a
major effort to recruit Hispanic girls and Asian girls," said Joannie
Ransom, executive director of the Angeles Girl Scout Council and a
co-coordinator of the convention. "In order to keep Girl Scouting
relevant, it is so important that every girl has an opportunity to
become the very best she can be through Girl Scouting."</TE>
<TE>   For a national organization that was a fixture of white suburbia
at its 1969 peak of 4 million girls, shifts in race, ethnicity and
cultural mores also have depleted membership, to about 2.8 million as
of September 2001. About 75% of those members are white. That number
includes girls who are not Scouts in troops but participate in Girl
Scout-run programs.</TE>
<TE>   Nearly 11% are African American, and black membership continues to
rise, according to Michelle Landa, a national spokeswoman.</TE>
<TE>   But efforts in almost every state have gained new members in the
unlikeliest of places -- homeless shelters, migrant farm encampments,
Khmer-speaking Cambodian neighborhoods and what would seem to be the
capitol of anti-Scout territory, juvenile hall.</TE>
<TE>   Clearly, the Girl Scouts of yesteryear -- those who had to sport
the nerdy uniform of green beret and knee socks, who sewed sit-upons
of vinyl filled with newspaper, who crafted for light and cooking the
buddy burners of wax-dipped rope coiled in tuna cans -- have been
replaced.</TE>
<TE>   The founding mission remains: to serve every girl, everywhere.
Uniforms have been updated to include not just Girl Scout green but
navy and khaki -- there is also a confused garment called a skort --
and they are completely optional. Badges are still earned. But they
have names like "Stress Less" and "Global Awareness."</TE>
<TE>   Most incredibly, the Girl Scouts are now sometimes even -- gasp!
-- serving boys.</TE>
<TE>   "Nobody likes to advertise that, but in communities where we are
trying to increase membership, like the Cambodian and Hispanic
groups, they are family-oriented, and we can't exclude anyone -- not
even boys," explained Michelle Burton, economic development director
for the Girl Scouts Council of Greater Long Beach.</TE>
<TE>   As she says this, a glance at her appearance is telling: She is
wearing a Talbots-looking pine green cardigan, modest A-line skirt
and sensible pumps. Her hair is in cornrow braids, into which beads
have been woven in "the colors of the African flag," she explained.</TE>
<TE>   Burton said she is a truer picture of the Girl Scout of 2002 than
the Betty Crocker stereotype the organization aims to overcome.</TE>
<TE>   "In Girl Scouting, we have the challenge of removing the stigma
that we're an upper-class, white organization, and we haven't ever
been," said Burton, part of a council that oversees troops and
programs in 17 communities, from Catalina Island to Compton.</TE>
<TE>   Standing in front of the convention center Saturday morning, a
group of Girl Scouts from Corona, near Riverside, including black,
Latina and white members, snapped photographs alongside their mothers
and troop leader Barbara Mathews.</TE>
<TE>   Elnora Gomez, 53, a mother of one of the Scouts, said she grew up
yearning to be a member, but she could not afford the fees. Another
mother, Alma Padilla, 38, said she, too, wanted to be a member but
her Latino parents were resistant to the idea because it was
unfamiliar to them, and they were wary about letting her go on group
field trips.</TE>
<TE>   Now, their daughters are not only learning the values taught by
the organization, they are learning about different cultures and
foods from their Scouting peers. The Corona troop also has members
with Italian, French, Japanese and Hungarian backgrounds.</TE>
<TE>   Mathews, 52, has been a member of the Scouts for 34 years, and she
has watched its membership diversify ethnically and among social
classes.</TE>
<TE>   "The national organization has made a real effort to try to reach
out to other groups," she said. "It's great because I hated to see
groups feel like they were being excluded."</TE>
<TE>   National membership of Latino, African American and Asian American
girls has increased from 2000 to 2001, the latest figures available,
according to Girl Scouts of the USA.</TE>
<TE>   Besides recruiting troop leader volunteers, the convention will
focus on strategies to continue reaching out to every girl. The goal
is to have Scouting "serve" one of every five girls nationally.</TE>
<TE>   Latina magazine founder Christy Haubegger was Saturday's keynote
speaker. Olympic gold medal gymnast Dominique Dawes, who works with
the organization on a self-esteem campaign, met with girls.</TE>
<TE>   Haubegger said she was once a member of the Girl Scouts, and the
organization helped her develop self-esteem and courage at a time
when she was battling adolescent insecurities. The organization is
crucial for helping young women, especially women of color, find role
models, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "They're the snapshot of the future, and they've got to be able to
reflect and address not only what the population looks like now, but
also what it will look like," she said. "Particularly girls from
diverse background need [Girl Scouts] because we're the ones who
don't get to grow up with our images reflected back on television or
in the media."</TE>
<TE>   At Saturday's conference, Dawes talked about body image, peer
pressure and self-esteem in front of a crowd of nearly 100 Girl
Scouts and volunteers.</TE>
<TE>   "Look around this room," she said. "No one looks like you
whatsoever. You are each unique."</TE>
<TE>   She told them to celebrate their differences and be confident.</TE>
<TE>   "The Girl Scouts of America are working hard to make sure you have
a strong foundation and sense of self-esteem," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Holding the convention in Long Beach was no accident. Besides the
multicultural backdrop that Southern California provides, Long Beach
is among the country's most diverse cities. Its population of 461,000
includes the largest Cambodian population outside Asia, which after a
generation here is moving out of poverty and whose elders sometimes
resist learning English; a growing poverty level and immigrant
populations from Mexico, Central America and Samoa, and a white
middle and upperclass who aren't volunteering because both parents
work.</TE>
<TE>   The story facing the national organization can be told in this
city. By the early 1990s, membership in the 17 communities of the
Girl Scouts Council of Greater Long Beach added up to only 4,000
Scouts.</TE>
<TE>   "As demographics have drastically changed in Long Beach and
surrounding communities," said Burton, a paid staffer and mother of
two sons, "the population that was once served changed. If we wanted
to reach our girls, we had to get out there to translate materials,
hire staff and role models that speak their language."</TE>
<TE>   In 1995, a campaign was launched to aggressively recruit in
schools for volunteer leaders, mentor role model leaders and
introduce the benefits of Girl Scouting to the Latino and
Khmer-speaking populations. It remains a work in progress, Burton
said, but seven years later, membership has nearly doubled to 7,000,
and about 70% of the members are Latino.</TE>
<TE>   In Long Beach, a Girl Scout troop that fluctuates between 20 and
40 members thrived last year and is about to resume at the city's
public school for children of the homeless or abused. Boys and girls
both were served in the classroom by Scout-paid teaching assistants
specializing in science. The assistance is funded by private
foundations and grants and run by the Long Beach Council.</TE>
<TE>   At five middle schools, nearly 100 girls have joined Scouting
programs, and some of them are in traditional troops now. In the
somewhat insular Khmer community of central Long Beach that is
estimated at 50,000, the Girl Scouts met with a choreographer who
leads a dance troupe of young girls at the newly founded Khmer Arts
Academy.</TE>
<TE>   Sophiline Shapiro, a central figure in the community's teaching
and performing of traditional Cambodian music and dance, worked with
the Long Beach Girl Scout Council to get funding grants for the
girls.</TE>
<TE>   The troupe discussed with the Girl Scout Council how the girls
might be helped by the Scouts. As a result, the Long Beach Council is
about to deliver to the girls a sewing machine with which to make
their own performance costumes. The council also provides an
after-school tutoring program for girls and boys through the academy,
located in a Cambodian church.</TE>
<TE>   The girls don't wear uniforms, and don't even consider themselves
Scouts, Shapiro said. But the Girl Scout Council hopes they will
eventually want to join.</TE>
<TE>   Intense recruiting at schools for volunteers produced mixed
results; the Girl Scout Council often has to pay women just above
minimum wage to work as troop leaders, a role historically played by
an unpaid stay-at-home mother.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not the Beaver Cleaver Mom who's at home baking cookies all
day, and it never was," Burton said. "We have many volunteer leaders
who don't have daughters. Our largest troop is led by a Lakewood
couple who don't have children. They exemplify that volunteers [don't
have to be] what people think. We have to meet people halfway, and
let them serve Girl Scouting in any way they can. It's a changing
world, and we have to change with it."</TE>

<HD>In Search of 'Last Word' on Breakup</HD>
<DH>Mayor extols city's virtues at UCLA forum, while secession
leaders push the alternative.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Sharon Bernstein</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles Mayor James K. Hahn took a new approach in his fight
against secession on Saturday, pushing the message that Los Angeles
is a great city, rather than focusing on the financial and political
risks of breaking up the city, as he has in the past.</LD>
<LD>   "I love Los Angeles," the mayor said at a forum on secession
organized by the UCLA School of Public Policy and Social Research.
"It's a great city that's more than just a place on a map. It
continues to be a magnet for people from all over the world."</LD>
<LD>   Hahn addressed about 200 people -- community activists, union
representatives, political officials and academics -- who had
gathered for a conference that the university dubbed "The Last Word"
on secession.</LD>
<TE>   He was followed by the chairmen of the two pro-secession political
campaigns, Gene La Pietra of the Hollywood Independence Committee and
Richard Katz of the San Fernando Valley Independence Committee.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn's appearance capped a morning of discussions on secession,
including a panel of academics and politicians who examined the roots
of the movement and its political legacy. Voters will decide on Nov.
5 whether to break up Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn, La Pietra and Katz appeared in succession, because the mayor
refused to sit on a panel with the two secessionists, or to debate
with them.</TE>
<TE>   In discussing secession, the mayor was more specific than he has
been in the past, and he stuck to a positive message.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn used his speech to compare Los Angeles to other cities,
saying that trash collection in L.A. costs just $6 per month, whereas
other cities in the county charge as much as $23 per month.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles libraries are open six, and in some cases seven, days
a week, Hahn said, while Glendale and Burbank keep theirs open part
time.</TE>
<TE>   He chided those secessionists who complain that potholes are not
routinely repaired, saying that motorists who drive past unfixed
potholes should call the city and tell street maintenance officials
where the holes are. Once the city is notified, he said, the hole
will be fixed, but if officials don't know about the pothole, they
can't repair it.</TE>
<TE>   "We respond to requests to fill potholes in 24 hours," the mayor
said.</TE>
<TE>   Still, he said, the city must improve in some areas. Los Angeles
has one of the least educated work forces in the nation, he said.</TE>
<TE>   He cited the hiring of Police Chief William Bratton as an example
of his administration moving forward to fix problems in the city. "We
have to end the years of scandal at the LAPD," the mayor said.</TE>
<TE>   But to make the city better, "we need to work together," Hahn
said. "Not break apart."</TE>
<TE>   La Pietra, the driving force behind the movement for Hollywood
secession, spoke after the mayor. La Pietra compared the mayor to
King George III of England, and said that the American Revolution was
really a secession movement.</TE>
<TE>   He claimed that, like the mayor, the king predicted that the
colonies would not do well on their own. And he said that England was
now run more efficiently, since it became smaller after the American
colonies broke away.</TE>
<TE>   La Pietra was followed by Katz, who urged voters to set aside
their fears about secession -- even though it may seem to be a
radical idea.</TE>
<TE>   By splitting off the Valley and Hollywood, secession would result
in three smaller, better-run cities, Katz said. The new cities would
be more democratic, because the council districts would be smaller,
making it easier for constituents to discuss issues with elected
officials and to influence public policy.</TE>
<TE>   "We're asking all of you to take the opportunity to take control
of your destiny," Katz said. "It just requires some trust and faith
in yourself and your friends and neighbors."</TE>

<HD>Mystery of Missing Starlet Was Never Solved</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Cecilia Rasmussen</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>She doesn't rank with Amelia Earhart, Jimmy Hoffa or Judge Crater,
but more than half a century later, there are still some people who
wonder what happened to a young actress named Jean Spangler.</LD>
<LD>   It's been 53 years since Spangler, 27, vanished as she walked from
her Park La Brea home to the Farmers Market and into thin air.</LD>
<LD>   Her disappearance on Oct. 7, 1949, captured the imagination of
Angelenos, who were still absorbed by the 2-year-old "Black Dahlia"
dismemberment murder and the more recent disappearance of a widowed
Bel-Air socialite named Mimi Boomhower -- who went missing with her
front door open and her lights burning.</LD>
<TE>   Family, friends, police detectives and the just plain curious have
devised various scenarios about what might have befallen Spangler, a
sultry blue-eyed divorcee with a young daughter.</TE>
<TE>   Some of those who still obsess over her disappearance think the
talented hopeful who wanted to be a star was silenced by the mob
because of her ties to Mickey Cohen's henchmen. Others think her
ex-husband did her in to get permanent custody of their daughter.
Some think she died as the result of a botched abortion.</TE>
<TE>   Her case dominated headlines for almost two weeks because police
saw parallels in her and Boomhower's disappearance.</TE>
<TE>   Spangler, born in Seattle, graduated from Franklin High School in
Highland Park in 1941. She landed work as a model and soon began to
eke out a living by dancing at Hollywood's Florentine Gardens and
Earl Carroll Theatre, and getting bit parts in movies, including
"When My Baby Smiles at Me" (1948) and "Wabash Avenue" (1950).</TE>
<TE>   In 1942, Spangler married plastics manufacturer Dexter Benner. He
was in his early 20s; she was 19, and a vivacious party girl.</TE>
<TE>   Their union didn't last long. She filed for divorce six months
later, accusing him of cruelty. But the couple's on-and-off
relationship lasted almost another four years, during which time they
had a baby daughter.</TE>
<TE>   When their messy divorce was finalized in 1946, Benner received
temporary custody of the child, Christine, 2, in part by charging
that Spangler "preferred parties to priorities."</TE>
<TE>   During the two years he had custody, Benner denied Spangler the
right to see Christine on 23 different occasions. He threatened
Spangler repeatedly that he'd "fix it so you'll never get to see
her." Finally, the judge ruled that Spangler's questionable conduct
was "buried in the past" and the "little girl's place is with her
mother." Spangler and her daughter moved to an apartment in the Park
La Brea neighborhood, sharing quarters with her mother, brother and
sister-in-law.</TE>
<TE>   But domesticity didn't diminish her ambitions of stardom: She kept
looking for the lights, action, excitement and that one big break.
Then she got the role that would make her famous -- but not in the
movies.</TE>
<TE>   On Oct. 7, 1949, she kissed 5-year-old Christine goodbye and told
her sister-in-law that she was going to meet her ex-husband about his
child-support payment, which was a week overdue. Afterward, she said,
she was going to work on a night shoot for a new film.</TE>
<TE>   "Wish me luck," she said as she crossed her fingers, winked and
walked into the misty night.</TE>
<TE>   With that, Jean Spangler disappeared virtually without a trace.</TE>
<TE>   Two days later, just hours after her sister-in-law reported her
missing, a Griffith Park worker found Spangler's purse in Fern Dell,
a leafy glen that has long been a favorite destination for strollers
and picnickers, as well as a dumping ground for the city's killers.</TE>
<TE>   One strap of Spangler's double-handled purse was torn, indicating
a possible struggle, police said. But it was the note inside that
intrigued detectives: "Kirk, Can't wait any longer. Going to see Dr.
Scott. It will work best this way while mother is away."</TE>
<TE>   Who, police wondered, was Kirk?</TE>
<TE>   Before Los Angeles Police Department Deputy Chief Thad Brown, who
had headed up the Black Dahlia case, could begin to reconstruct
Spangler's last hours, Kirk Douglas phoned him.</TE>
<TE>   The actor, who was vacationing in Palm Springs when Spangler
disappeared, said he'd heard news reports about the case. He told
Brown that Spangler may have worked as an extra in his last film,
"Young Man With a Horn," but said he barely knew her.</TE>
<TE>   Douglas' call raised questions, but police soon cleared him of
wrongdoing.</TE>
<TE>   A 60-man team canvassed Griffith Park and the Sunset Strip bars
and nightclubs that Spangler had frequented. Detectives learned of a
mysterious former medical student known as "Doc" who hung around the
Strip and performed abortions for a fee, but never found him.</TE>
<TE>   Media speculation was rampant. If the mysterious "Dr. Scott" was
an abortionist who had operated illegally on Spangler and botched it,
killing her, why would he carelessly toss her purse -- bearing a note
with his name on it -- in Griffith Park?</TE>
<TE>   The only "Scott" investigators came up with in Spangler's past was
a handsome Army Air Corps lieutenant named Scotty, with whom she'd
had an affair while she was married. Scotty had beaten her and
threatened to kill her when she left him in 1945, police learned, but
Spangler apparently never saw him again after her divorce.</TE>
<TE>   Her ex-husband denied having seen her, a story supported by his
new wife.</TE>
<TE>   Police did not discount the possibility that Spangler had lied
about going to see Benner, using him as a cover story to hide the
fact that she was heading off to have an abortion. Most of her
girlfriends denied she was even pregnant, but one friend told
investigators Spangler had confided that she was.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators checked with the studios and the Screen Extras Guild
but found no records of her working that night. A saleswoman at
Farmers Market, only a few blocks from Spangler's home, remembered
seeing her browsing for a while that night around 6 and said that she
appeared to be "waiting for someone."</TE>
<TE>   Actor Robert Cummings told the police that, while working at
Columbia Studios two weeks earlier, she had walked past him
whistling.</TE>
<TE>   "You sound happy," Cummings told her.</TE>
<TE>   "I am," Spangler replied. "I have a new romance."</TE>
<TE>   "Is it serious?"</TE>
<TE>   "Not really ... but I'm having the time of my life," she told him.</TE>
<TE>   At the time, she and Cummings were working on "The Petty Girl,"
which was completed just two days before she vanished.</TE>
<TE>   Complicating the investigation further, Spangler had been seen in
Palm Springs a few days before her disappearance on the arms of
"Little Davy" Ogul and Frank Niccoli, henchmen of mobster Mickey
Cohen. Both were under indictment for conspiracy, and both
disappeared around the same time as Spangler.</TE>
<TE>   Although investigators checked out Spangler's Palm Springs haunts,
they would later have it on good authority that Niccoli's body had
been tossed into a lime pit in a Cucamonga vineyard before she
vanished, and Ogul's body, if not already there, wasn't far behind.</TE>
<TE>   (Ogul and Niccoli were out on bail for a total of $75,000. Their
disappearance meant that Cohen would have to cough up the bail money,
putting him out of business. Or at least that's what mobster Jack
Dragna thought when he ordered the hit, according to Cohen's
attorney, Jack Dahlstrum, who wrote an unpublished book on Cohen.)</TE>
<TE>   "Sightings" of Spangler continued to pour in to the police. She
and Ogul supposedly were seen from El Paso to Phoenix, Mexico City to
San Francisco. But police found no supporting evidence that they were
even alive, much less together.</TE>
<TE>   "Jean was not the kind of girl to get mixed up with people like
that," meaning the mob, her mother, Florence, told the press. "I am
sure she would have communicated with us if she is alive and free.
And nobody can tell me that she would have left her baby unless she
was forced to do so; she loved her too much."</TE>
<TE>   Custody of Christine reverted to Benner. The child became the
focus of another hotly contested court battle when he refused to let
her see her grandmother.</TE>
<TE>   Benner repeatedly defied a court order that he permit Florence
Spangler to visit. When ordered to serve 15 days in jail for
contempt, he fled the state, taking Christine with him. They were
never seen again.</TE>
<TE>   Official and unofficial searches for Spangler persisted. Police
continued to circulate her picture.</TE>
<TE>   For at least three years, the Los Angeles Times ran a story about
the missing starlet on the anniversary of her disappearance.
Hollywood gossip columnist Louella Parsons and Spangler's mother each
offered a $1,000 reward for information that might lead to her
whereabouts.</TE>
<TE>   But today, her fate remains as misty as the night into which she
vanished.</TE>

<HD>Spitzer's War Chest Buys Him Early Clout</HD>
<DH>Some of the Assembly candidate's cash aids others, perhaps
helping him to a leadership post.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jean O. Pasco</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>His black hair gelled back, knees bared in boxy khaki shorts, Todd
Spitzer strode through Green River Golf Club in Corona shaking hands
and posing for pictures like a candidate in the final sprint of a
razor-close race.</LD>
<LD>   The sold-out fund-raiser for Spitzer's Assembly run raised
$90,000, but he probably won't spend a dime of it on the campaign.</LD>
<LD>   His newly redrawn district in Orange and Riverside counties is
heavily Republican, all but assuring him victory. His Democratic
opponent has raised less than $1,000 -- a pittance compared to the
$662,000 collected by Spitzer, who has the largest war chest of any
state Assembly candidate.</LD>
<TE>   But Spitzer will need the money once he gets to Sacramento, as he
struggles to make an impact in the six years he can serve in the
Assembly before being term-limited out.</TE>
<TE>   Spitzer's campaign reflects the new reality for legislative
candidates, where the fight is less about getting elected than having
power once you enter the Capitol.</TE>
<TE>   Ambitious lawmakers hoping to rise to leadership must arrive with
clout -- or enough money to buy it. The realities are even tougher
for a freshman Republican in the Democrat-dominated Capitol.</TE>
<TE>   Spitzer said that when he was in Sacramento recently, candidates
were already asking for a piece of his riches. He agreed to part with
$12,000 for three GOP Assembly candidates and a Senate candidate in
more competitive races.</TE>
<TE>   "Money is a significant factor in whether people interact with you
and take you seriously," said Spitzer, 40. "I'm going to be a
back-bencher minority freshman who's not going to get any playing
time, I know that."</TE>
<TE>   Such a hefty campaign fund will open many doors for a freshman
assemblyman, said longtime GOP analyst Tony Quinn, who co-produces
the California Target Book, which analyzes state races.</TE>
<TE>   Spitzer could spread the money around to the party and Republican
officeholders, hoping to lock in support for a leadership spot.</TE>
<TE>   This was the playbook of Herb Wesson (D-Culver City), who became
Assembly speaker this year after successfully raising millions to
help party colleagues after his 1998 election. In the state Senate,
three incumbents in safe districts have more campaign cash than
Spitzer.</TE>
<TE>   But Spitzer is unique because he's accumulated the war chest even
though he's not in the Legislature yet.</TE>
<TE>   This fund-raising record will probably make him an instant player
in Sacramento, said Rob Stutzman, state Republican party spokesman.
"It qualifies him for future leadership because he's demonstrated he
can raise the money, and it certainly gives him a leg up in any
future race," Stutzman said.</TE>
<TE>   Spitzer's strategy points up one of the unintended consequences of
term limits, said Jim Knox, executive director of California Common
Cause. With their tenure now limited, Knox said, lawmakers are
committed to nonstop fund-raising to raise their profile and get
things done.</TE>
<TE>   "It never stops," he said. "[The money] is never enough."</TE>
<TE>   Spitzer has been a prodigious fund-raiser since his first try for
office in 1996. Running for the Board of Supervisors, Spitzer raised
$150,000 and won a surprise victory even through much of the GOP
establishment backed his opponent.</TE>
<TE>   A former prosecutor, Spitzer gained a reputation as a firebrand,
becoming a vocal opponent of an airport at El Toro and often clashing
with county executives. His outspokenness earned him the nickname
"Ready, Fire, Aim."</TE>
<TE>   Even from the safety of his board seat, Spitzer continued to build
his campaign bankroll. His fund-raising, however, accelerated over
the past year when he announced his candidacy for the 71st Assembly
district.</TE>
<TE>   Spitzer has collected most of his campaign cash during this
period, as he served both as supervisor and as chairman of the Orange
County Transportation Authority, the government panel that oversees
transportation spending. His major donors include the Irvine Co.,
21st Century Insurance and Medix Ambulance Service.</TE>
<TE>   He also has attracted attention from political action committees
that are staples for incumbents, including the California Real Estate
PAC and California Medical Assn. PAC.</TE>
<TE>   Locally, his supporters include Republicans as well as Democrats,
who see him as driven more by policy than partisanship.</TE>
<TE>   Many donors said they know he doesn't need more money for his
Assembly race. They said their checks are an investment in his
future. "He'll be our governor in the next 10 years," said Bill Wood,
a Democrat, former chairman of the Orange County Human Relations
Commission and a Spitzer contributor.</TE>
<TE>   Spitzer said he raised the first half of the money when he thought
he'd face a wealthy Riverside County challenger, who never
materialized. He isn't saying what he'll do after the election,
declining to comment on persistent chatter that he's interested in a
run for attorney general.</TE>
<TE>   Some in Sacramento, however, said Spitzer has annoyed party
leaders by being less generous than they had hoped. He can still give
unlimited amounts to the party until the election. When he takes
office, new federal rules limit contributions to a political party to
$20,000 per election cycle. He can also contribute up to $3,000 per
legislative candidate.</TE>
<TE>   Spitzer has been much more generous this year with non-campaign
efforts. He donated $3,200 to the Orange County GOP and another
$1,500 to its Riverside County counterpart. But he gave $37,000 to
back a successful March initiative on the Orange County ballot that
gives voters, rather than the governor, the ability to choose his
replacement on the Board of Supervisors. He donated $36,000 to the
anti-airport measure.</TE>
<TE>   "I've spent my money on issues I felt strongly about," he said.
"When I'm in Sacramento, I want to be able to look at things that are
problems and be able to do something about them. When you want to do
things like that, you have to have money in the bank."</TE>
<TE>   On the Green River course, Spitzer was clearly enjoying the day of
sunshine and financial security. He mused that politics was much like
golf: When you play, you find out who cheats. The easier the swing,
the more distance you get. And both activities are highly social,
leading to friendships.</TE>
<TE>   "Next year I'm going to make this a two-day event," he said.
"It'll start on a Sunday so the lobbyists can fly in from
Sacramento."</TE>

<HD>Hospital Cuts Hit the Poor</HD>
<DH>UCI Medical Center is referring one-fifth of new indigent
patients to other clinics in O.C.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jeff Gottlieb</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the first two months of a cutback, UCI Medical Center has turned
away more than one in five people who called for an appointment under
the county's medical program for the poor.</LD>
<LD>   UCI figures show that 21% of new patients enrolled in the county's
Medical Services for the Indigent program who sought help at the
Orange hospital in August and September were referred to clinics
closer to home. The result is that some clinics, especially those in
the northern part of Orange County, are finding their waiting rooms
filling up.</LD>
<LD>   "Everybody has decided to come to our facility," said Maggie
Trejo, a patient resource worker at Sierra Health Center in
Fullerton.</LD>
<TE>   Even poor patients who continue to receive treatment at the
medical center in Orange and its two clinics in Anaheim and Santa Ana
are affected by UCI's changes.</TE>
<TE>   In the past, these patients were treated for whatever ailed them,
regardless of whether the county reimbursed doctors and the hospital.
But since Aug. 1, UCI has moved to a system akin to an HMO, in which
treatment must be approved through a case-management system. If the
county doesn't pay for it, UCI will not provide the treatment.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, close to 17% of requests for treatment for existing
patients have been turned down, said Mary Owen, who heads UCI's
case-management unit. Most of the vetoed referrals have been in
dermatology, gastroenterology and orthopedics, she said. A patient
who needs a consultation with a cardiologist could make an
appointment, but he or she could not see a specialist for a condition
such as eczema, which is not life-threatening, Owen said.</TE>
<TE>   Orange is one of three counties in the state, along with
Sacramento and San Diego, that do not operate county hospitals.
Because it is legally obligated to fund indigent health care, Orange
County reimburses hospitals and doctors a portion of their costs to
treat the poor.</TE>
<TE>   The MSI program provides medical care for people 21 through 64 who
make too much money to qualify for Medi-Cal and are not old enough
for Medicare. The care is limited to services that protect life or
prevent a significant disability or serious deterioration of health.</TE>
<TE>   There were 17,532 MSI patients in Orange County in fiscal year
2000-01, the last year for which the county had statistics.</TE>
<TE>   The county will spend $47 million for the MSI program in the
current fiscal year. Health-care advocates argue that is far too
little and say Orange County is among the least generous counties in
the state when it comes to per-capita spending for health care for
the poor.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a very bad place to be poor and sick," said Marika Bonner,
executive director of the Orange County Medical Assn.</TE>
<TE>   Since Aug. 1, UCI hasn't taken new MSI patients who live more than
five miles from the hospital or two miles from its clinics. UCI
officials said the medical center cannot afford to continue treating
the largest portion of the county's uninsured and that other
hospitals and community clinics need to take more patients. UCI
continues to treat poor patients in its emergency room.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the changes at UCI, the county reorganized the MSI
program starting Oct. 1. The county will establish its own
case-management system to provide cheaper alternatives to hospital
care, said Jon Gilwee, vice president of the Southern California
Hospital Assn. He said that in fiscal 2001, the county paid hospitals
about $25 million for $190 million worth of services.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the early days of the redesign," Bonner said. "We're all
willing to take a cautiously optimistic view. It certainly wasn't
working the other way."</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Ralph Cygan, chief executive of UCI Medical Center, said it is
too early to tell how the new system is working.</TE>
<TE>   The most common referrals from UCI have been to Sierra Health
Center in Fullerton, Nhan Hoa Comprehensive Health Center in Garden
Grove and Camino Health Center in San Juan Capistrano.</TE>
<TE>   The change has doubled the number of indigent patients at Sierra.
Trejo, the patient resource worker, said the wait for an appointment
has grown from two or three days to two weeks. Christine Ta,
executive director of Nhan Hoa, the only nonprofit clinic geared
toward the Vietnamese community, said the clinic is seeing about 21%
more MSI patients than previously. Camino Health Center director Deb
Drew would not comment.</TE>
<TE>   Another important change has been that UCI specialists are not
seeing patients from outside the area, forcing clinics to find other
doctors who will treat their patients. Trejo said clinic physicians
sent patients who needed special care, such as treatment for
hepatitis C or a hernia, to specialists at UCI. "It was a lifesaver
for us," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Nowadays, sometimes it is up to the patient to find the doctor.</TE>
<TE>   "We can't go through the Yellow Pages every time someone comes in
here," Trejo said. "We tell them to locate a specialist. When they
do, we give them a referral so they can start treatment."</TE>
<TE>   Nancy Rimsha, director of the Health Consumer Action Center at the
Legal Aid Society of Orange County, said some MSI patients won't be
able to find specialists to treat them. One of her clients can't find
an orthopedist willing to take what the county will pay, she said.</TE>
<TE>   Also, Bonner said doctors worry that if they earn a reputation for
accepting MSI patients, they will be inundated with the indigent.
Bonner said the county is developing a network of specialists who
will treat more MSI patients in exchange for a higher reimbursement.</TE>
<TE>   "The specialty network is probably one of the greater hurdles to
overcome," she said.</TE>

<HD>Dump, Blight Top District Issues</HD>
<DH>Candidates for a new Valley council worry about
neighborhoods and landfill expansion.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Sharon Bernstein</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Stretching from the pristine Santa Susana Mountains to the grimy
industrial flats of eastern Northridge, the 1st City Council District
for the proposed San Fernando Valley city is the birthplace of the
secession movement.</LD>
<LD>   The onetime white, Republican stronghold now has an ethnically
mixed population and a slim majority of Democrats.</LD>
<LD>   "It's full of very residential neighborhoods surrounded by city,"
said Tamara Trank, who lives in the Sherwood Forest neighborhood, in
the house where her husband grew up.</LD>
<TE>   Trank is one of nine 1st District candidates for the council that
will be created if secession passes in the Nov. 5 election. A Valley
city would have 14 such council districts of about 95,000 residents
each. It would also have an elected mayor.</TE>
<TE>   Trank opposes secession. She is running for office, she said,
because she would like her views to be represented in a new city.</TE>
<TE>   The proposed district would encompass Granada Hills and parts of
Northridge and include the 32,500-student Cal State Northridge. It is
an area with a tradition of conservative activism dating to the
anti-busing movement and an earlier secession drive in the 1970s.</TE>
<TE>   But it is also home to a new crop of liberal activists. Some are
outraged at plans to reopen a massive city dump near a water
treatment plant in Granada Hills. Others worry about conditions in
low-income apartments along several blocks of Parthenia Street.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Sidney Gold, a psychiatrist who is running for a council seat,
has lived in Granada Hills since 1976. Touring the proposed district
recently, he pointed out a Northridge industrial park near Parthenia
Street and Tampa Avenue, across from apartment buildings whose
security fence is topped with razor wire to keep drug dealers out.</TE>
<TE>   There is a proposal to place a recycling facility there but,
though Gold supports recycling, he is concerned that the facility
would further blight an already disadvantaged neighborhood.</TE>
<TE>   Shaunn Cartwright, who like Gold and Trank considers herself
liberal, lives near the university and sees the proposed construction
of a new high school on the CSUN campus as a key issue in the
neighborhood.</TE>
<TE>   Cartwright opposes the construction of Academy High School, in
part because she is concerned that there will not be enough parking.</TE>
<TE>   One candidate who knows first-hand the changes that have affected
Northridge is Susan Deas, 33, a management consultant who grew up in
the north end of the district and still lives in the family home with
her mother.</TE>
<TE>   When the family moved in, cows grazed on nearby farms. Now her
neighborhood, at Balboa Boulevard and Parthenia Street, is near some
of the district's most urban corners.</TE>
<TE>   She is committed to making the Valley a separate city and does not
plan to run for office in Los Angeles if secession fails. Deas, who
has a law degree and a master of business administration degree in
finance and management, said she is particularly interested in making
sure the new city gets off on the right foot, with council members
who have the budgeting and management skills necessary to set up and
run a new government.</TE>
<TE>   Much of the political life in the district is consumed with the
proposal to reopen a portion of Sunshine Canyon landfill, which
straddles land in the city and the county of Los Angeles and has been
closed for decades.</TE>
<TE>   A plan by the owners, Browning-Ferris Industries, to expand it
from unincorporated county land into Granada Hills has often been
cited by secession backers as a reason the Valley should form its own
city.</TE>
<TE>   Other residents support secession because they resent having tons
of trash trucked in from all over the city and dumped near their
homes. In 1999, the Los Angeles City Council approved a project --
since delayed by homeowners' legal action -- to expand the landfill
closer to residential neighborhoods. Mayor James K. Hahn has since
said that he would try to find alternatives to the dump.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the candidates have cited Sunshine Canyon as a top
land-use concern, along with the proposed expansion of a local
parochial school.</TE>
<TE>   One who has been particularly active is Kim Thompson, a mother of
two who has devoted herself to fighting any expansion of the dump and
the reopening of the Los Angeles side. Despite having been appointed
by Hahn to the Environmental Affairs Commission, Thompson favors
secession. It's a point of view that solidified after she organized a
community group to speak before the council about Sunshine Canyon.</TE>
<TE>   "These people were truly thinking the council was going to listen
to what they were saying," Thompson said of the 300 residents packed
into council chambers. But council members "were eating and they were
chatting and they were getting out of their seats. They were talking
on the phone. It was horrible."</TE>
<TE>   Candidate Ken Aslan is a father of three who lives in the Granada
Hills home he bought from his parents and where he grew up. Aslan
established and runs the Historic Core Business Improvement District
and Property Owners Assn. in downtown Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   In his role as executive director of the organization, he said, he
is already serving like a councilman, coordinating competing needs of
the improvement district, applying for grants and putting together
the organization's budget.</TE>
<TE>   Robert Nelson Norris, president of the Granada Hills Chamber of
Commerce, is an attorney running on a platform of fiscal
responsibility for the new city.</TE>
<TE>   "One of the important things to do with a new city is to try to
avoid the mistakes of the current system, to try not to spend as much
money as Los Angeles does," Norris said.</TE>
<TE>   Two other candidates in the district, Andrew W. Anderson Jr. and
Don L. Larson, could not be reached for comment.</TE>

aggressive manner, authorities saidSaturday.</LD>
<LD>   Kirt Tenerio, 46, remained in Ventura County Jail on Saturday on
suspicion of domestic violence. Authorities said he punched his wife
in the face and resisted arrest.</LD>
<LD>   The incident occurred about 4 p.m. Friday at the couple's home in
the 200 block of El Medio. During the argument, Tenerio allegedly
armed himself with a hatchet but his wife was able to flee to a
neighbor and then call the police.</LD>
<TE>   Shortly before officers arrived, the couple's adult son wrestled
the weapon away from his father. Tenerio, though, came out of the
house "acting aggressively," authorities said, and challenged the
officers.</TE>
<TE>   Both Tenerio and his wife were treated for minor injuries at a
local hospital.</TE>

<HD>Group Attempts to Increase Minority Voting</HD>
<DH>African American Voter Project plants volunteers all over
the city to sign people up, and they're seeing increased success.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Anthony McGinnis stood outside a Food 4 Less off Slauson and Western
Saturday, armed with a clipboard in one hand, a pen in the other. He
had a mission, and nothing, not even cranky morning shoppers, would
deter him.</LD>
<LD>   "Good morning, miss," he called cheerily to one woman in her
mid-60s, as she walked right by him as if he were invisible. "Would
you like to register to vote?"</LD>
<LD>   McGinnis, 45, is a foot soldier of sorts, a dedicated volunteer
for the African American Voter REP (Registration, Education and
Participation) Project, a grass-roots organization aimed at getting
African Americans to participate in the voting process that is an
outgrowth of the African American Vote 2000 Project.</LD>
<TE>   This weekend is the last chance for many groups to register a
large number of voters before the Monday deadline. In addition to the
African American organization, all of the political parties planned
voter registration drives this weekend. The California Democratic
Party will be registering voters at the Sherman Oaks Street Fair, the
Green Party at the Hollywood and Pico-Cloverfield farmers markets. A
spokeswoman for the California Republican Party told The Times that
"the troops will be in full force throughout California."</TE>
<TE>   As of Friday, the Los Angeles County Registrar of Voters said the
African American group had registered 21,595 voters. A registrar
spokeswoman, Marcia Ventura, called the group's rate of return, on
the 54,000 affidavits that had been issued to it, "better than
normal." The normal return, she said, is 15% to 25%.</TE>
<TE>   "We've never registered this many people before," said Los Angeles
City Councilman Mark Ridley-Thomas, the chairman of the organization,
which includes labor, political, business and religious leaders on
its steering committee. Seventy-five percent of the voters it
registered are African American, he said, and 25% are Latino.</TE>
<TE>   McGinnis, a dispatcher for Los Angeles Unified School District who
spends at least five hours a day helping the group register and
verify new voters, said he was buoyed by the group's success. Working
in front of the supermarket Saturday, he approached strangers with
unflappable enthusiasm.</TE>
<TE>   "You try to be bubbly," he said of his formula for success. "And
show a positive attitude....you say something catchy. Anything that
might spark their interest."</TE>
<TE>   "We have some important measures coming up," he told Yvonne Bruce,
36, as she filled out a form to reregister herself at her new address
in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll give you one of these fliers, to read up on it," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Although his group is non-partisan, it has taken stands on several
of the measures on November's ballot, including support for Measure
B, which would impose a parcel tax on homes, office buildings and
other developed properties to fund Los Angeles County trauma and
emergency medical services.</TE>
<TE>   The threat that hospitals could close caught the attention of
Raquel Del Toro, 24, of Los Angeles, who said she would be voting for
the first time this November. She filled out a form while her sons
and nieces looked on.</TE>
<TE>   It also was an impetus for Latonia Jones, 28, of Los Angeles to
reregister.</TE>
<TE>   The last time she voted, she said, was in the 2000 presidential
election. This election, it's the issues more than the candidates
that concern her. "They are trying to close down the trauma centers
and the after-school programs for the kids," she said.</TE>
<TE>   McGinnis said that one of his chores for the African American
organization is to verify each new voter, calling the number provided
on the registration form.</TE>
<TE>   "Our integrity is beyond that of the registrar of voters," he
said. "It has to be a correct phone number -- or someone has to
answer." In two hours, McGinnis signed up four new voters, a total,
he acknowledged, that wasn't spectacular.</TE>
<TE>   "It works in spurts," he said. "The best days are the 1st and
15th, when people get their paychecks and Social Security checks and
come to the shopping center because they have money to spend."</TE>
<TE>   Still, he was satisfied. "Everyone who said they'd do it on the
way out came by" and signed a form, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "People who are real soldiers out there get 35 or 40 in a day. Me,
I'm not that aggressive, because I've got to go back to the office
and check to make sure the forms are good."</TE>

<HD>Mother Defends Daughter Suspected in Biting Death</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The mother of a Modesto woman who police suspected bit her husband so
many times that he eventually died is defending her daughter, saying
frustration led to the attack.</LD>
<LD>   Kelli Pratt's mother told the Modesto Bee that her daughter
suffers from health problems, including cerebral palsy. Pratt's
mother spoke to the newspaper on condition of anonymity.</LD>
<LD>   Arthur Pratt, 65, died earlier this week, six days after he told
police that his wife bit him about 20 times. He told investigators in
a videotaped interview that his wife was angry that he was too weak
to have sex, said police Det. Al Brocchini.</LD>
<TE>   Officers called to the house reported that Arthur Pratt had
lesions and sores all over his body, and at first believed they were
all bites. An autopsy revealed only two bites -- both severe -- on
his side and stomach.</TE>
<TE>   The mother said her daughter was devoted to caring for Pratt. "She
was well aware of the fact that her husband was ill, and she
respected that," the mother said. "When I saw her today, she told me
this definitely didn't happen over sex."</TE>
<TE>   Pratt's mother said her daughter's health makes it difficult for
her to take care of herself, and the burden of her husband's care
ultimately became more than she could handle.</TE>
<TE>   "Kelli maintains it happened over the fact she was so stressed
out," the mother said. "While he was getting care, she was home
fending for herself. She just didn't get the care she needed."</TE>

<HD>Oceanside Reins In Plans for Ethnic Rodeo</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Beth Silver</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL>OCEANSIDE</DL>
<LD>There's the traditional textbook picture of a charro, or Mexican
cowboy, who pays homage to his warrior ancestry in disciplined rodeo
maneuvers that take years to master.</LD>
<LD>   And then there's the view of some City Council members, who
conjure up a swaggering, beer-guzzling and tequila-toting misfit who
displays his machismo by lassoing his horses by the legs.</LD>
<LD>   The images clashed last month when a local group of charro and
their families, in full rodeo dress, pitched a plan to make a
four-acre plot of city land their permanent home.</LD>
<TE>   The charros and their children told of a sport that has become an
art and of weekly events that have become family gatherings with folk
dances, music, lasso tricks and, of course, the rodeo itself.</TE>
<TE>   One council member came back with accounts she had read of a
tradition of alcohol and macho behavior.</TE>
<TE>   The charros say that's a racist view.</TE>
<TE>   The councilwoman, Carol McCauley, says it's reality.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not a prude by any means and I love tequila," McCauley said.
"[But] one of their traditions before these charreadas, or rodeos,
was heavy drinking. There's no bones made about it that the true
tradition of the charros is that. It gives them the courage to go out
and participate in the sport without any fear of the broken bones and
injuries. That's unacceptable to me."</TE>
<TE>   The council laid the plan aside indefinitely at its Sept. 18
meeting. It will be at least January before the council votes on the
proposal.</TE>
<TE>   At issue is a patch of city land, designated for recreational use,
called Ivey Ranch Park. It is covered with dirt and a stubble of
brittle grass. It's surrounded by a horseshoe of ramshackle buildings
and gardens, an aviary, a tiny jungle gym, a group that provides care
for children, many of them disabled and a center that trains dogs for
the disabled.</TE>
<TE>   The Asociacion Charros de Jose Mario Morales was formed 25 years
ago. The group was orphaned in the mid-'90s when a developer bought
the Encinitas site of the association's stables and rodeo arena to
build strip malls and mega-stores.</TE>
<TE>   The charros have since scattered around the area, using nearby
Escondido's facilities, boarding their horses in their backyards and
practicing only at meets, said Michael Chez, a charro and the group's
spokesman.</TE>
<TE>   But the issue goes beyond location, he said. It even goes beyond
tradition.</TE>
<TE>   Although drinking may occur at other Mexican rodeos, called
charreadas, he said, it would be banned at Oceanside's. It's against
the charros' national association rules. The same would be true of
some of the more controversial rodeo practices, such as horse
tripping, in which a charro ropes a horse at the legs, pulling
tighter and tighter until the animal drops to the ground. The
practice is illegal in California.</TE>
<TE>   "What do they have against us? This is a different breed of
people. If we are changing, why not give us a break?" Chez asked.</TE>
<TE>   Esther Sanchez, the only Latino member of the council, said her
fellow council members' comments hurt and surprised her. In a city of
170,000, a third of whom are Latino, she said it showed an
insensitivity to a major portion of the population.</TE>
<TE>   "Those statements were the most racist statements I've ever heard
from this council," Sanchez said.</TE>
<TE>   McCauley cringed at the accusation of racism, which she denied.
And she was joined by the rest of the five-member council, except for
Sanchez, in voting, for a variety of reasons, to defer action on the
charros' plan.</TE>
<TE>   "It has nothing to do with [the charros'] background," said the
city's mayor, Terry Johnson.</TE>
<TE>   The field is one of the few remaining pieces of city-owned
parkland. The City Council had envisioned a ballpark or soccer field,
not a dusty rodeo that would attract, among other things, flies and
traffic, Johnson said.</TE>
<TE>   The charros wanted to set up a lienzo, or arena, where they would
practice and perform, along with stables for 18 horses. In addition
to the rodeos, the charros would provide therapeutic riding time for
the disabled children at the nonprofit Ivey Ranch Park Assn. and from
the area.</TE>
<TE>   The charros and a volunteer group that has allied with them called
PRIDE, or the Pacific Rim Institute for Development and Education,
would invest about $190,000. The city would be responsible for about
$120,000 and giving the charros a 30-year lease on the field.</TE>
<TE>   Portable stadium seating would be erected around a
microphone-shaped dirt stage. That, too, presents a problem, Johnson
said. The charros estimate 500 people could attend their events, and
there is not enough parking for such numbers in a spot already
crowded with houses, a nearby church and the historic Mission San
Luis Rey, Johnson said.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson said the city may still be able to accommodate the
charros, just as is done in many cities in California and around the
country. Although he said he thought nearby cities with more
available parkland might be more compatible, he said he plans to meet
with the charros in the next few weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Sharleen Maldonado, of the PRIDE charity group based in
Carlsbad, said the only alternative that would satisfy her would be
to elect a new City Council. McCauley and another councilwoman are up
for reelection next month. Maldonado said she plans to organize a
political action committee and start collecting donations to unseat
the incumbents Nov. 5.</TE>
<TE>   "We're just taking on Oceanside," Maldonado said.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Eileen Jackson Southern, an authority on Renaissance and African
American music and Harvard University's first tenured black female
professor, has died. She was 82.</LD>
<LD>   Southern died Oct. 13 in Port Charlotte, Fla., of complications
from Alzheimer's disease.</LD>
<LD>   Born in Minneapolis in 1920, Southern studied piano and played her
first concert in Chicago at age 7.</LD>
<TE>   Southern attended Chicago public schools, earned her undergraduate
degree from the University of Chicago in 1940, her master's the
following year and a doctorate in musicology from New York University
in 1961. She also studied piano at Chicago Musical College, at Boston
University and at the Juilliard School of Music in New York City.</TE>
<TE>   She taught at Prairie View University in Texas, Southern
University, Brooklyn College, and York College of the City University
of New York, before going to Harvard in 1974 as a lecturer.</TE>
<TE>   She became a full professor in 1976, with a dual appointment in
Afro-American studies and music. Between 1975 and 1979, she headed
the Department of Afro-American Studies, before retiring in 1987.</TE>
<TE>   She wrote and edited many works, including "The Music of Black
Americans, a History" (1970), which has become essential reading for
those interested in the subject.</TE>
<TE>   In 1973, she and her husband, Joseph Southern, established "Black
Perspectives in Music," the first musicological journal on the study
of black music.</TE>
<TE>   In 2000, she was the recipient of the Lifetime Achievement Award
from the Society of American Music.</TE>
<TE>   In April, President Bush honored her as a National Humanities
Medalist for her work.</TE>
<TE>   She is survived by her husband, who is also a retired Harvard

<HD>Ocean Search for 4 Downed Navy Aviators Is Called Off</HD>
<DH>The rescue effort is suspended indefinitely. The missing
crewmen are identified.</DH>

<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>POINT SUR, Calif -- The search for four Navy aviators missing after
two F/A-18F jets collided Friday morning during a training exercise
was called off at sundown Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   The men were identified as weapons system officers Lt. Stephen
Nevarez, 31, of New Orleans; Lt. Stephen Benson, 26, of Virginia
Beach, Va.; and pilots Lt. Joel Korkowski, 30, of Phoenix; and Lt.
Matthew Shubzda, 27, of Dallas.</LD>
<LD>   The crewmen were all members of Strike Fighter Squadron 41,
nicknamed the Black Aces.</LD>
<TE>   The search was "suspended indefinitely" and the helicopter and two
Coast Guard cutters that had been searching for the pilots were
returning to their berths, said Matt Juillerat, a Coast Guard
spokesman.</TE>
<TE>   Civilian boats, which aided the search Friday, were not allowed to
rejoin the search.</TE>
<TE>   Navy officials are investigating the crash, which took place about
80 miles south of Monterey. The F/A-18F Super Hornet jets were based
at Lemoore Naval Air Station, about 30 miles south of Fresno.</TE>
<TE>   All four crewmen flew combat missions over Afghanistan in F-14
Tomcats during Operation Enduring Freedom. When they returned in
December 2001, they traded in the Tomcats for the Super Hornets, Navy
spokesman Dennis McGrath said.</TE>
<TE>   Lemoore was the first base to receive the Super Hornet planes. The
Black Aces Squadron was training so that it could be deployed on the
aircraft carrier Nimitz.</TE>
<TE>   It was the first crash involving a $57-million Super Hornet since
the Navy began deploying them in 1999.</TE>

<HD>Mehli Mehta, 94; Youth Symphony Conductor</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Chris Pasles</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Mehli Mehta, the father of conductor Zubin Mehta and mentor to
generations of music students through the American Youth Symphony,
died Saturday at Santa Monica-UCLA Medical Center. He was 94, and
died of heart failure and other causes associated with aging.</LD>
<LD>   Born in India, Mehta was a lifelong devotee of Western classical
music. He discovered it as a child, and focused on it during a career
of more than 60 years as a violinist, conductor and teacher with the
American Youth Symphony, which he remade in 1964 and led until his
retirement in 1998.</LD>
<LD>   With his wife of 67 years, Tehmina, he also raised two sons who
have had important roles in global classical music. One son, Zubin,
former music director of the Los Angeles Philharmonic and the New
York Philharmonic, is music director for life of the Israel
Philharmonic and general music director of the Bavarian State Opera.
The other, Zarin, former executive director of the Montreal Symphony
and the Ravinia Festival in Chicago, is executive director of the New
York Philharmonic.</LD>
<TE>   Zubin Mehta, who maintains a home in Los Angeles, said Saturday
that he had just flown in from Munich, Germany, to visit his ailing
father, but arrived after his death.</TE>
<TE>   "Any concert of mine that he attended, there was no doubt to whom
my message was going," the internationally famous son said. "That is
what I will miss in Los Angeles, because he will not be there any
more."</TE>
<TE>   Mehli Mehta last watched his son conduct in December when Zubin
Mehta was guest conductor of the Los Angeles Philharmonic at the
Dorothy Chandler Pavilion. "It is a divine coincidence that the last
concert of mine that he attended was the 'Requiem,' " Zubin Mehta
said.</TE>
<TE>   He said that his father had been his first teacher, that he had
grown up listening to his father's symphony and quartet rehearsals
and that, until he was 18 and went to Vienna to study, "everything I
knew about music was from my father."</TE>
<TE>   The younger conductor echoed others' appraisal of Mehli Meta as a
strict disciplinarian, but kind and a universally adored teacher. "He
had two loves -- his family and his music," Zubin Mehta said. "This
was his entire life."</TE>
<TE>   Violinist Lawrence Sonderling, a member of the Los Angeles
Philharmonic since 1977 and a former American Youth Symphony
concertmaster, said that Mehli Mehta "did everything with great
intensity and great purpose and great love for music. It was always
the music that was the most important thing. In rehearsal with the
orchestra, he would badger us, he would yell and scream; sometimes he
would tell stories of things he had heard and seen in his musical
youth. Always the intensity was there. And the passion."</TE>
<TE>   Mehta was born to Parsi parents in Bombay, India, on Sept. 25,
1908. He became interested in Western classical music while listening
to his father's records of violinists Fritz Kreisler, Jascha Heifetz
and Efrem Zimbalist, and began violin studies when he was 5.</TE>
<TE>   After studying at the University of Bombay and Trinity College of
Music in London, he founded the Bombay Symphony in 1935, serving for
10 years as concertmaster before becoming its conductor. In 1940, he
founded the Bombay String Quartet.</TE>
<TE>   "I should have been born in Europe," he told The Times in 1994.
"In my 25 years playing in India, not one Hindu, not one Muslim came
to my concerts. Only the English and the Americans came."</TE>
<TE>   Hoping to become a world-class violinist, Mehta moved to New York
on a student visa in 1945 to study with the eminent pedagogue Ivan
Galamian.</TE>
<TE>   "It was the heyday of great conductors and virtuosos," he said.
"At my best, unhappily, I was no match for [Nathan] Milstein and
Heifetz."</TE>
<TE>   Mehta returned to Bombay to take over the podium of the Bombay
Symphony, but wanted to return to the United States. When he was
unable to obtain a U.S. visa, he moved to England in 1955. He served
there for five years as assistant concertmaster or concertmaster of
the Halle Orchestra under Sir John Barbirolli, whom he acknowledged
as "one of the greatest influences of my conducting life."</TE>
<TE>   Mehta joined the Curtis String Quartet in Philadelphia in 1960 as
second violinist and toured with the group until he moved to Los
Angeles in 1964.</TE>
<TE>   That was two years after his son Zubin began his duties at the Los
Angeles Philharmonic. The elder Mehta came to Los Angeles to become
director of the orchestra department at UCLA and taught there until
1976.</TE>
<TE>   Within two months of his arrival, he took over the American Youth
Symphony, made up of university students from Southern California,
and made it his own. The orchestra ultimately grew into a 110-member
ensemble, with musicians ranging in age from 18 to 25. It continues
to perform around the world.</TE>
<TE>   As a conductor, Mehta was known for memorizing all his scores. "I
come from what I call the golden age of music, when no one used a
score," he once said. "Today's great conductors -- let's even leave
my darling son Zubin out of it -- but Abbado, Maazel, Ozawa, all
conduct from memory."</TE>
<TE>   As a teacher, Mehta was known as an inspiring taskmaster.
Prospective American Youth Symphony members were asked three
questions: their age, who they studied with (he would not accept
someone not studying with a reputable teacher) and whether they were
willing to commit to 3 1/2 hours of rehearsals every Saturday. "What
is our aim?" Mehta said in 1993. "To train them in great orchestra
playing."</TE>
<TE>   More than 15 American Youth Symphony alumni went on to become
members of the Los Angeles Philharmonic, and another 80-plus
graduates play in orchestras across the country and in Europe.</TE>
<TE>   "I joined when I was about 16, which was just shortly after he
came to Los Angeles and took over the orchestra," said Sonderling,
the former American Youth Symphony concertmaster.</TE>
<TE>   "Here I was, a high school student, and here's this orchestra
playing this great symphonic repertory. It was a whole different
world for me. There was this man up there, he was cajoling and
brow-beating and everything in between, and trying to impart his love
and experience to young people. It was a shock, like nothing I had
heard or seen before. But it was this sort of thing that made it
possible for me to have a career."</TE>
<TE>   Mehta was slowed down by heart attacks in 1995 and 1996 and
subsequent bypass surgery. At his American Youth Symphony farewell
concert at UCLA's Royce Hall in May 1998, he hobbled off the stage,
suffering chest pains, after completing Ravel's "La Valse."</TE>
<TE>   "The doctor said that, were it not for the defibrillator
regulating my heartbeat, I would have been dead on the spot," Mehta
told The Times two days later.</TE>
<TE>   The Russian-born violinist-conductor Alexander Treger, a longtime
member and concertmaster of the Los Angeles Philharmonic and a music
educator at UCLA and Crossroads School in Santa Monica, took over the
American Youth Symphony in fall 1998.</TE>
<TE>   "His musicianship and his love of music are the first things that
come to my mind when I think of him," Treger said. "And his total
dedication. Music was totally his love. His knowledge of music, of
certain phrasings, bowings, just name it, it's amazing. I call it the
Mehta genius. They see the page one time and it's there. It's
amazing. The generations of musicians he trained, it's absolutely
marvelous."</TE>
<TE>   In addition to his wife and sons, Mehta is survived by four
grandchildren and two great-grandchildren. Services will be at 10
a.m. Tuesday in the Hall of Liberty at Forest Lawn Memorial-Park,
Hollywood Hills.</TE>

<HD>Anaheim Is L.A.? Geographically, Giants' Baker Is Way Off
Base</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Dana Parsons</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Before the first pitch of this World Series had been thrown, Giants
manager Dusty Baker brushed back the Angels and their fans with a
high hard one. Right under the chin. A message pitch, as they say in
baseball.</LD>
<LD>   "Beat L.A.!" Dusty crowed, echoing cries heard earlier in the
evening from San Francisco fans after the Giants knocked off the
Cardinals to earn their World Series trip. Then, perhaps recalling
vaguely where Anaheim was, Baker amended his remarks: "Southern L.A.
It's Orange County, but let's beat L.A."</LD>
<LD>   In a few choice words, Baker hit Anaheim and Orange County fans
where they live. Literally. Four hundred miles away, 2.7 million
people groaned.</LD>
<TE>   Beat L.A.?</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles. Orange County. Hollywood. Anaheim. What the heck's
the difference? It's all one big offramp, right? It's all SoCal,
right? We're all in La-La Land down here.</TE>
<TE>   To Dusty Baker, apparently so. And this from a man who grew up in
Riverside and played eight seasons with the Dodgers. If Dusty can't
or won't distinguish L.A. from O.C., can we hope for much more from
the rest of the country?</TE>
<TE>   Probably not.</TE>
<TE>   In short, here we go again. Even in their moment of seminal glory
-- the long-awaited trip to the World Series -- Angel fans in
particular and Orange County in general can't escape the shadow of
Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Does it matter? At the risk of over-thinking the issue, you're
darn tootin' it does.</TE>
<TE>   Logical or not, championship sports teams carry their local fans
right along with them. Psychologists will tell you there's a
transference of pride and joy that passes between a team and its
fans.</TE>
<TE>   At a primal level, fans feel more worthy because their valiant
warriors fought off all comers and emerged victorious. If fans didn't
feel that way, they wouldn't care if the team won or lost.</TE>
<TE>   The Yankees are mighty, so New Yorkers feel mighty. The Green Bay
Packers have a permanent niche in American sports history, so their
fans feel special -- and not just because they're shareholders in the
team.</TE>
<TE>   Now come the Angels. If they are winners, then, by God, so are we.
You think those delirious fans at Edison Field last weekend were
exulting just for the players and Disney management?</TE>
<TE>   Nope, the World Series is the national stage on which all of
Orange County emerges as a success story.</TE>
<TE>   Which is why Dusty Baker's zinger galled so many.</TE>
<TE>   It's like Miss Virginia winning the Miss America pageant only to
hear the judges mistakenly announce the winner as Miss West Virginia.</TE>
<TE>   Beat L.A.</TE>
<TE>   Hasn't Orange County itself spent the better part of the last 40
years trying to beat L.A.? Stretching the point or not, at the very
least we can say for sure the county doesn't want to be thought of
synonymously with its older brother to the north.</TE>
<TE>   The county has tried to carve out its own identity. To an extent,
it's still living down an image from a rapidly fading past.</TE>
<TE>   "In terms of an identity issue," says Calvin Morrill, chairman of
the UC Irvine sociology department, "there's always been this
perception -- and I think it still persists around the country --
that Orange County is a hotbed of Republican conservatism. It takes a
while to change that."</TE>
<TE>   Maybe that reputation persists because at one time it was more
than conservative; it was seen as nearly Neanderthal.</TE>
<TE>   The late Walter Knott, the amusement park builder later considered
"Mr. Republican" in the county, set the tone in the early 1960s when
he wrote to Richard Nixon, who was running for governor: "We will do
everything we can to help you win in November, but it would make our
work much easier in Orange County if you would lay off the John Birch
Society and refrain from depreciating the conservative movement."</TE>
<TE>   For the next generation, Orange County was thought of not just as
politically conservative, but as ultraconservative.</TE>
<TE>   The "Orange Curtain," as Morrill notes, wasn't as mythical as it
sounds. On one side was the white population of Orange County; on the
other, the increasingly multihued Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   That was then, and this is now. Whether the rest of America knows
it or not, Orange County 2002 is a melting pot.</TE>
<TE>   "Orange County," a movie released this year, probably reinforced
another erroneous stereotype, Morrill says -- that of the "upper
middle-class beach culture, rather vacuous, meaningless,
post-suburbia kind of existence."</TE>
<TE>   Orange County still has conservative Republicans and malaise among
its youth, but neither accurately defines the county, Morrill says.</TE>
<TE>   What does are things like its emerging immigrant populations and
its diversified and growing economy.</TE>
<TE>   Still, there is the identity issue.</TE>
<TE>   We can't really blame casual sports fans around the United States
if they don't have Anaheim and Orange County on their radar screens.</TE>
<TE>   Until the 1990s, the county was home to only two major sports
franchises, the Angels and the football Rams. Throughout their tenure
in Anaheim and before leaving in 1995, the Rams retained the "Los
Angeles Rams" name they brought with them from L.A. And only in 1997,
after 30 years in Orange County, did the Angels adopt the "Anaheim"
moniker. Only the Mighty Ducks of the NHL started and stayed with
Anaheim as the team name.</TE>
<TE>   Mike Blake, a former Brea resident for 23 years and author of five
baseball books, now lives in northern Michigan. "I'm not sure the
public knows where Anaheim is," he says.</TE>
<TE>   Not even the World Series, Blake says, will emboss Anaheim and
Orange County on the country's consciousness.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's a step," he says. "I don't think it's a panacea.
Should the Angels be prominent again over the next couple years, or
should the Mighty Ducks ever get into the playoffs and do anything,
should another team call Orange County its home, it's a possibility.
This won't go down as one of the most greatly watched World Series.
There's no real history between these teams. So this is a step."</TE>
<TE>   Should we care about being recognized?</TE>
<TE>   "For community self-respect and personal self-respect, yes," Blake
says. "For potential business, yes."</TE>
<TE>   But he and Morrill say the county's diversity and division into 34
cities works against a single view of ourselves, even from within.</TE>
<TE>   The result, Morrill says, is less "solidarity" among residents of
different cities. "What Orange County is is a metroplex," Morrill
says. "It's not a city, but it's not a county in the usual sense,
either."</TE>
<TE>   Therein lies an inherent problem for the Angels. While Anaheim
Mayor Tom Daly rightly says the World Series is a great opportunity
for his city to emerge, I'd argue that the team's more accurate name
would be Orange County Angels.</TE>
<TE>   Blake disagrees. He thinks the Angels mainly are the province of
North County residents. He wonders whether South County or the beach
cities, as a whole, embrace the team like the residents of Brea,
Anaheim or Fullerton.</TE>
<TE>   Sheesh. That leads us right back to the nub of the conundrum. Even
if we who live here were to define Orange County, how would we do it?</TE>
<TE>   Are we the Surf City of Huntington Beach? The Little Saigon of
Westminster? The working-class neighborhoods of Garden Grove? The
comfortably rich of Newport Beach? The planned communities of Irvine
and Mission Viejo?</TE>
<TE>   Other cities around the country have their different
neighborhoods. In Orange County, our diversity shows up in different
cities.</TE>
<TE>   That's too complicated for TV to capture. To coin a word, Orange
County isn't as "graspable" as the good folks of Green Bay or even
the New Yorkers we've come to know and love.</TE>
<TE>   Surely there are worse lots in life than to be an undefinable
metroplex.</TE>
<TE>   Still, as elusive as our true identity may be, Orange County most
definitely knows who it is not.</TE>
<TE>   For better or worse, we are not L.A.</TE>
<TE>   So, Dusty Baker wants to beat L.A.? Go right ahead.</TE>
<TE>   As long as his Giants don't beat the Angels, nobody -- from San
Clemente to La Habra -- cares what the Giants do to L.A.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Walden P. Boyle, 94, a founder of the UCLA department of theater
arts, died Tuesday of complications from surgery at UCLA Medical
Center.</LD>
<LD>   Boyle joined the UCLA faculty in the 1943-44 academic year as a
lecturer in the English department. Until 1947, the work of drama
majors was part of the English department, and Boyle and one other
faculty member did that work.</LD>
<LD>   They directed all the plays, occasionally built scenery and
lighted productions. After the department of theater arts was founded
in 1947, Boyle directed its first production: "The Wanhope Building."
He also developed the department's one-act play program, which
required theater majors to write, direct and act in original plays.</LD>
<TE>   After 32 years of full-time academic service, in which he also
served terms as department chairman, he took emeritus status in 1976.</TE>
<TE>   Boyle was born in Winside, Neb. He earned his bachelor's degree at
the University of Oregon and served as a drama instructor there.</TE>
<TE>   He earned his master's and doctorate at Cornell before going to
UCLA.</TE>

<HD>Ronald A. Malt, 70; Led First Surgeons to Reattach a Human
Limb</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dr. Ronald A. Malt, 70, who is best known for leading a team of
surgeons in the first successful effort to reattach a human limb,
died Oct. 5 in Wellesley, Mass. The cause was complications of
Alzheimer's disease.</LD>
<LD>   In 1962, Malt was the chief surgical resident at Massachusetts
General Hospital. A 12-year-old boy, Everett Knowles, was brought
into the emergency room after his right arm had been ripped off as he
attempted to hop a freight train. Malt's team of 12 surgeons attached
the bone with a pin and reconnected the arteries. Muscle and skin
grafts were done with equal success. Malt said later that he
attempted the surgery because Everett had lost so much of his arm
that it would have been hard for him to use an artificial limb.</LD>
<LD>   A native of Pittsburgh, Malt earned his bachelor's degree from
Washington University and his medical degree from Harvard.</LD>

<HD>Sailor Lost at Sea Finds a New Life</HD>
<DH>After his rescue, Rich Van Pham has another boat and is the
toast of Ventura Harbor.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>David Kelly</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Disaster has been very good to Rich Van Pham. A few weeks ago, the
62-year-old itinerant sailor was drifting helplessly off the coast of
Costa Rica, mast broken, sails shredded and faith ebbing.</LD>
<LD>   "I prayed for a quick death," he said.</LD>
<LD>   Now, very much alive, Pham sits aboard his new 25-foot sloop in
Ventura Harbor, discussing the healing benefits of boiled sea turtle
and roasted sea gull.</LD>
<TE>   An unopened copy of "Practical Sailing" sits beside a donated
global positioning system that baffles a man more accustomed to
ragged maps and compasses.</TE>
<TE>   "For four months I see no one," he said, sitting in the cramped
boat. "I have a new life, everyone wants to talk to me. I have no
plans to go anywhere; I will relax here for awhile."</TE>
<TE>   Since being rescued last month from his battered vessel floating
off Costa Rica, Pham has been showered with offers of aid from around
the world.</TE>
<TE>   The boat was a gift from Erwin Freund, a bioengineer at Amgen in
Thousand Oaks. Hotel rooms, flights, clothing and navigation
equipment have also been donated to Pham, who appears simultaneously
grateful and puzzled by it all.</TE>
<TE>   "I think they are interested in the story, not in me," he said. So
far, nothing about Pham's murky background or memory lapses about
past scrapes with the law seems to have dampened the public's
enthusiasm for him.</TE>
<TE>   Law enforcement records show the Vietnamese immigrant was arrested
three times in the last 17 years on suspicion of felonies that
include aggravated battery and marijuana possession in Texas,
California and Florida. No charges were ever filed and details of the
case were not available.</TE>
<TE>   "The arrests don't make me change my mind: He was not prosecuted;
he didn't spend a day in jail," said 49-year-old Freund of Camarillo.</TE>
<TE>   Freund felt strongly enough to donate his boat, which he was
selling for $4,400, to Pham.</TE>
<TE>   "I figured this guy deserves it," he said. "He appeals to our
alter ego. I'd like to be carefree and sailing. He's living the way
I'd like to."</TE>
<TE>   Pham's new home occupies a prime slip in Ventura Harbor and has
five sails, a radio, flares, television, VCR and small bedroom. He
apologizes for the clutter and draws a curtain over his ruffled
sleeping quarters.</TE>
<TE>   "When Erwin showed me the boat I loved it," he said. "Now I need
to find a [permanent] place to put it."</TE>
<TE>   Pham has remained an enigma since the McClusky, a Navy narcotics
interdiction frigate, found him floating 350 miles off Costa Rica.</TE>
<TE>   He had left Long Beach Harbor in his 26-foot-boat, Sea Breeze, for
a 22-mile jaunt to Santa Catalina Island. But high winds snapped his
mast, his radio failed and he drifted for 2,500 miles, living for 120
days by his wits and off the bounty of the sea.</TE>
<TE>   It was a compelling story, and when he returned to the U.S. he was
an instant media star, though not without detractors.</TE>
<TE>   "Why is someone as incompetent as him getting such recognition for
being a screw-up?" asked Steven Bien, a veteran long distance sailor
from Los Angeles. "His story seems a little farfetched."</TE>
<TE>   Pham, a slightly built man with a deep tan, smiles at such
comments.</TE>
<TE>   "People find it hard to believe," he said. "I understand that."</TE>
<TE>   "Sometimes you read something and it just grabs you," said Vance
Vaughan of Woodland Hills. "I am married to a Vietnamese woman who
was a boat person. For a guy to come here and learn English and then
lose it all really struck a note."</TE>
<TE>   Phillip Nguyen of Tustin wanted to donate $1,000. "I want to help
him get on his feet, find a job," said the Cal Fed loan officer.
"Lots of us ended up with no family or friends because of the war. I
don't want to dig up his past; he's not a politician. When someone
needs help, you help."</TE>
<TE>   Jerry Pool, owner of Larry Dudley Yacht Sales in Ventura Harbor,
is letting Pham keep his boat in his dock for awhile.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought this was really bizarre when I heard it," Pool said. "I
had red flags going up all over the place. But when you talk to him
you realize he doesn't have a dishonest bone in his body. He seems to
draw people to him."</TE>
<TE>   Pham doesn't know his next move. He disappears for days at a time
before returning. He says he may sail down to San Diego or Oceanside.
"If you travel on the sea you love it," he said. "Water, sea and
yourself--that's the best; that's No. 1."</TE>

<HD>Allen Walker Read, 96; Word Scholar Traced Origin of 'OK'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Claudia Luther</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Among etymologists, Allen Walker Read, who died Wednesday in New York
City at the age of 96, was known as the man who had discovered the
origin of the term "OK."</LD>
<LD>   His quest began in 1941 when, as a former research assistant for
the Dictionary of American English, he thought he would help out old
friends still working there by finding an earlier reference to OK to
"add some freshness to their entry."</LD>
<LD>   What he found was that "OK" didn't stem from the Choctaw word okeh
or oke -- a popular theory of the time. Nor did it come from "aux
cayes" -- the Haitian port of Aux Cayes from which premium rum was
exported. Or olla kalla, Greek for "all good." Or Orrin Kendall, who
manufactured a better-than-average Army biscuit. Or any number of
other sources.</LD>
<TE>   Knowing that the first general use of OK began in the 1840s, Read
paged through old newspapers from that decade. He was able to
document -- and documentation is the key among etymologists -- that
"OK" stood for "Old Kinderhook," a reference to President Martin Van
Buren, a native of Kinderhook, N.Y., who ran unsuccessfully for
reelection in 1840.</TE>
<TE>   Democrats supporting Van Buren dubbed themselves the "Democratic
O.K. Club," Read found. Later, a writer supporting Van Buren asked,
"Will you not say O.K.? Go ahead!" This, Read wrote in 1941, was the
origin of the word that later became ubiquitous in almost every
language and throughout the world.</TE>
<TE>   Much to the consternation of his fellow, begrudgingly admiring
etymologists, the issue seemed settled.</TE>
<TE>   Years later, when another academic found an earlier use, Read was
forced to dig deeper. He found an even earlier source -- a Boston
newspaper in 1838 that playfully used initials for such phrases as
G.T.D.H.D. (give the devil his due) and O.K.K.B.W.P. (one kind kiss
before we part) In this vernacular, O.K. stood for "all correct,"
spelled just for fun as "oll korrect." Old Kinderhook and "oll
korrect" have long been the first accepted sources for the word.</TE>
<TE>   Thus Read remained the "OK" man, a notoriety that, by age 83, he
told the New Yorker magazine in 1989, he was "almost a little tired
of."</TE>
<TE>   Read, who was born in Winnebago, Minn., on June 1, 1906, earned a
bachelor's degree from the University of Northern Iowa (then known as
Iowa State Teachers College) and a master's from University of Iowa
and was a Rhodes scholar at Oxford. An English professor at Columbia
for 29 years before retiring in 1974, he also was a consultant on
many dictionaries, including American College, Funk &amp; Wagnalls
Standard, Random House of the English Usage and others.</TE>
<TE>   But he did not believe that dictionaries should be final arbiters
of correct usage.</TE>
<TE>   "The great danger in the use of dictionaries is that they may come
to be thought of as straitjackets that prevent the swinging, free
enjoyment of the mother tongue," he wrote in Consumer Reports, which
had asked him to make a recommendation of a dictionary. According to
the New Yorker, the Consumer Reports article brought Read the most
scathing criticism of his academic career from readers who called him
"a wrong-side-up pedant" and "standardless sociologist of language."</TE>
<TE>   But Read stuck by his guns.</TE>
<TE>   "Standards are a personal matter, and any attempt to impose them
on others is fraught with great danger," he wrote in Magazine Word
Study in 1965. "Anyone who tries to defend 'the treasure of our
tongue' should recognize that a valuable part of the treasure is the
colloquial element, localisms and slang."</TE>
<TE>   Extending this theory, he believed that everything changed all the
time. Thus he developed a "strong dislike for what he calls
'absolutisms,' such as 'perfect,' 'correct,' 'certain,' 'pure,'
'total,' 'true,' 'final,' 'ultimate,' " New Yorker writer Michelle
Stacey wrote in her 1989 piece.</TE>
<TE>   Take, for example, the arbitrariness of the name "Rockies," now an
absolute. Read found that in 1804 the Rockies were called the
Northern Andes and that other names given to the range were Stony,
Shining and Enchanted -- all perfectly good names that now seem odd.</TE>
<TE>   Or take, for another example, the word "liberal." President Reagan
took this very good word and turned it into something "dreadful,"

<TE>   Read called this phenomenon a "semantic blockage," something of
great interest to him but one that, alas, he never brought to the
level of academic fruition that he intended. The other lifelong
project that he didn't finish was a comprehensive dictionary of
"Briticisms." Though he had boxes and boxes of files on the subject
in his apartment on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, including files
that explored the differences among old bean, a gent, a bloke, a
chap, a cad, a toff and a lad, he was not able to finish this
momentous project.</TE>
<TE>   Read throughout his life grappled with what language should and
could be to a people. In an essay he wrote as a forward in Funk &amp;
Wagnalls, he recited this allegory from psychologist Hadley Candril:</TE>
<TE>   Three baseball umpires were discussing how they made their
decisions. The first one said, "Some's balls and some's strikes and I
calls 'em as they is." The second umpire said, "Some's balls and
some's strikes and I calls them as I sees 'em." Then the third umpire
said, "Some's balls and some's strikes but they ain't nothin' till I
calls 'em."</TE>
<TE>   Read liked to think of himself as the middle umpire.</TE>
<TE>   Read's wife of 49 years, semantics scholar Charlotte Schuchardt,
died in July. They had no children.</TE>

<LD>Los Angeles Mayor James K. Hahn took a new approach in his fight
against secession on Saturday, pushing the message that Los Angeles
is a great city, rather than focusing on the financial and political
risks of breaking up the city, as he has in the past.</LD>
<LD>   "I love Los Angeles," the mayor said at a forum on secession
organized by the UCLA School of Public Policy and Social Research.
"It's a great city that's more than just a place on a map. It
continues to be a magnet for people from all over the world."</LD>
<LD>   Hahn addressed about 200 people -- community activists, union
representatives, political officials and academics -- who had
gathered for a conference that the university dubbed "The Last Word"
on secession.</LD>
<TE>   He was followed by the chairmen of the two pro-secession political
campaigns, Gene La Pietra of the Hollywood Independence Committee and
Richard Katz of the San Fernando Valley Independence Committee.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn's appearance capped a morning of discussions on secession,
including a panel of academics and politicians who examined the roots
of the movement and its political legacy. Voters will decide on Nov.
5 whether to break up L.A.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn, La Pietra and Katz appeared in succession, because the mayor
refused to sit on a panel with the two secessionists, or to debate
with them.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn used his speech to compare Los Angeles to other cities,
saying that trash collection in L.A. costs just $6 per month, whereas
other cities charge as much as $23 per month.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles libraries are open six, and in some cases seven, days
a week, Hahn said, while Glendale and Burbank keep theirs open part
time.</TE>
<TE>   He chided those secessionists who complain that potholes are not
routinely repaired, saying that motorists who drive past unfixed
potholes should call the city and tell street maintenance officials
where the holes are. "We respond to requests to fill potholes in 24
hours," he said.</TE>
<TE>   La Pietra, the driving force behind the movement for Hollywood
secession, spoke after the mayor. La Pietra compared the mayor to
King George III of England, and said that the American Revolution was
really a secession movement.</TE>
<TE>   He claimed that, like the mayor, the king predicted that the
colonies would not do well on their own. And he said that England was
now run more efficiently, since it became smaller after the American
colonies broke away.</TE>
<TE>   La Pietra was followed by Katz, who urged voters to set aside
their fears about secession.</TE>
<TE>   By splitting off the Valley and Hollywood, secession would result
in three smaller, better-run cities, Katz said. The new cities would
be more democratic, because the council districts would be smaller,
making it easier for constituents to discuss issues with elected
officials and to influence public policy.</TE>
<TE>   "We're asking all of you to take the opportunity to take control
of your destiny," Katz said. "It just requires some trust and faith
in yourself and your friends and neighbors."</TE>

<HD>Arizona State's Upset of Oregon Is 'Huge'</HD>
<DH>Walter's school-record 536 passing yards leads Sun Devils
in 45-42 win that ends No. 6 Ducks' winning streak at 11.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>EUGENE, Ore.</DL>
<LD>Arizona State quarterback Andrew Walter tried to come up with words
to adequately describe his team's upset of No. 6 Oregon, and he kept
going back to one in particular.</LD>
<LD>   "You dream about getting a win in a place like this," Walter said
after the Sun Devils' 45-42 victory Saturday night. "It huge. It's
huge for the program and it's huge for the team."</LD>
<LD>   Walter threw for a school-record 536 yards and four touchdowns,
and Arizona State rallied from a 21-0 second-quarter deficit.</LD>
<TE>   The Sun Devils (6-2 overall, 3-0 in the Pacific 10) are one of
only two unbeaten teams -- idle Washington State is the other -- left
in the conference.</TE>
<TE>   The loss sended an 11-game overall winning streak for the Ducks
(6-1, 2-1). It was the second-longest streak in the nation behind
Miami's 28. Oregon had also won six consecutive Pac-10 games.</TE>
<TE>   "Unfortunately we just couldn't control the game; we couldn't
corral it, turn it our way," Oregon Coach Mike Bellotti said.</TE>
<TE>   Walter , whose yardage topped Paul Justin's 534 yards against
Washington State in 1989, completed 31 of 53 passes and Arizona State
had 590 total yards.</TE>
<TE>   "Wow. I'm stunned," Oregon free safety Keith Lewis said. "You can
never give up 500 yards, I don't care who you are."</TE>
<TE>   Shaun McDonald had 12 receptions for 204 yards and a touchdown for
Arizona State, which ended a losing streak to Oregon at four.</TE>
<TE>   "I've played against the Ducks for five years now and hadn't
beaten them. So if I didn't do it this time, I would never have the
chance again," linebacker Mason Unck said.</TE>
<TE>   Oregon's Jason Fife, who entered the game ranked third nationally
in passing efficiency, completed 21 of 32 for 288 yards and three
touchdowns.</TE>
<TE>   Onterrio Smith, the conference's leading rusher, gained 172 yards
in 27 carries and scored three touchdowns for the Ducks.</TE>
<TE>   Arizona State took a 39-35 lead early in the fourth quarter on
Walter's 58-yard touchdown pass to Justin Taplin.</TE>
<TE>   The Sun Devils extended their lead on Mike Barth's 44-yard field
goal.</TE>
<TE>   Oregon, which built a reputation for comeback victories in recent
years and did it twice this season, tied the game with 6:55 left. On
third and 11 at the Arizona State 12, Fife passed to Samie Parker for
a touchdown.</TE>
<TE>   Walter, a sophomore, calmly moved the Sun Devils back downfield,
but overthrew McDonald on third and five at the Oregon 12, and
Arizona State settled for Barth's 29-yard field goal with 1:58 left.</TE>
<TE>   Oregon's final series ended when Arizona State safety Brett Hudson
intercepted Fife's pass.</TE>
<TE>   It was Arizona State's first victory over a ranked team since
defeating No. 10 Washington, 44-31, on Nov. 1, 1997.</TE>

<LD>Michael Sgroi kicked three field goals, and Chris Lewis threw to Alex
Smith for the game's only touchdown as Stanford defeated Arizona,
16-6, Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   The Cardinal (2-4 overall, 1-2 in the Pacific 10 Conference) took
the lead for good in the first quarter when Sgroi kicked a 45-yard
field goal.</LD>
<LD>   Jason Johnson passed for 244 yards to lead Arizona (3-4, 0-3), but
he threw three interceptions and was sacked six times.</LD>
<TE>   After Sgroi's field goal, Arizona began moving up the field, until
Stanley Wilson intercepted one of Johnson's passes and ran 35 yards
to the Wildcat 17-yard line.</TE>
<TE>   On the second play of possession at the 12, Lewis passed to Smith,
who pulled the ball down from over his head and fell backward into
the end zone for a 9-0 lead.</TE>
<TE>   Arizona's Bobby Wade was the single biggest threat to Stanford,
catching eight passes for 121 yards.</TE>
<TE>   The Wildcats' only scores came on two field goals by Bobby Gill,

<LD>Both kickers felt confident, but only one got to leave feeling good.</LD>
<LD>   As the crowd chanted, "We hate you, we hate you," Dusty Mangum
drilled a 27-yard field goal with 1:32 left Saturday night to give
eighth-ranked Texas a 17-14 victory over No. 17 Kansas State at
Manhattan, Kan.</LD>
<LD>   With seven seconds to go, Kansas State's Jared Brite could have
tied the score by making a 36-yard field-goal attempt. But the kick
was low, and Marcus Tubbs got a hand on it to preserve the victory
for Texas.</LD>
<TE>   "I was pretty confident going out there that I was going to make
it," said Mangum, who suffered through a one-for-five slump against
Tulane and Oklahoma State this season.</TE>
<TE>   "All of a sudden, they were chanting. I was really glad that I got
that kick and was able to shove it in their face."</TE>
<TE>   Chris Simms threw two touchdown passes for the Longhorns (6-1, 2-1
in conference) and B.J. Johnson had four catches for 132 yards and a
score.</TE>
<TE>   Brite, who had an extra-point attempt blocked in the second
quarter, appeared to hit the kick low.</TE>
<TE>   "To tell you the truth, I couldn't tell," he said. "My head was
still down when I heard the thump from someone's hands. The way I hit
it, it felt like it was going high."</TE>
<TE>   Tubbs, a 6-foot-4, 305-pound lineman, was put in specifically to
try to get the block.</TE>
<TE>   "It was just about getting penetration, raising your hands and
jumping as high as you can," he said. "That's all it was."</TE>
<TE>   It was a crucial victory for the Longhorns, who came back strong
after last week's 35-24 loss to No. 2 Oklahoma. It also dropped
Kansas State (5-2, 1-2) to 2-23 in games against top-10 teams under
Coach Bill Snyder.</TE>
<TE>   "It's great for our team," Johnson said. "We are going to fight
throughout the year, so if [reporters] want to count us out of this
thing, we're not out. We'll be back."</TE>
<TE>   Ell Roberson hit James Terry on consecutive passes for 27 and 15
yards to move the Wildcats into position for Brite's tying attempt.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Texas A&amp;M 47, Kansas 22 -- Dustin Long threw for a school-record
399 yards and three touchdowns to lead Texas A&amp;M (5-2, 2-1) at
Lawrence, Kan.</TE>
<TE>   Derek Farmer had 111 yards rushing in 21 carries for the Aggies
with touchdown runs of four yards in the second quarter and one yard
in the fourth.</TE>
<TE>   Bill Whittemore threw two second-half touchdown passes to Byron
Gasaway and ran one yard for a fourth-quarter touchdown for Kansas
(2-6, 0-4), which was outgained, 566-289, and has not won a
conference game since beating Texas Tech, 34-31, on Oct. 6, 2001. The
Jayhawks haven't beaten a Big 12 team at home in two years.</TE>
<TE>   Long's yardage -- on 18-for-32 passing -- was the fifth-most ever
against the Jayhawks, who gave up a 300-yard performance for the
third straight week. Baylor's Aaron Karas threw for 359 yards against
the Jayhawks in the Bears' 35-32 win on Oct. 5, and Colorado's Chris
Brown ran for 309 yards a week ago as Kansas lost, 53-29, to the
Buffaloes.</TE>
<TE>   Bethel Johnson caught two of Long's scoring passes, for 18 yards
in the second quarter and 30 yards in the fourth, and finished with
124 yards and six receptions.</TE>
<TE>   Whittemore, who was sacked seven times, finished with 187 yards on
21-for-44 passing. He also ran for 27 yards and caught a 16-yard pass
from running back Dan Coke.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   No. 23 Colorado 34, Baylor 0 -- Chris Brown ran for 167 yards and
three first-half touchdowns before leaving the game with a sprained
ankle, and the Buffaloes (5-2, 3-0) won at Boulder, Colo.</TE>
<TE>   Brown, the nation's leading rusher, boosted his per-game average
slightly to 164.9 yards as Colorado won its fourth game in a row.</TE>
<TE>   Baylor (3-4, 1-2) had 251 yards -- compared with 395 for the
Buffaloes -- and crossed midfield only three times.</TE>
<TE>   The Bears had two scoring threats in the final five minutes, but
third-string quarterback Josh Zachry fumbled at the Colorado 20-yard
line with 4:55 remaining and threw incomplete in the end zone on the
final play of the game.</TE>
<TE>   Brown had touchdown runs of 55, four and one yard. He became the
fastest player in Colorado history to reach 1,000 yards in a season,
doing it in 143 carries. Rashaan Salaam needed 149 carries to hit
1,000 on his way to 2,055 yards and the Heisman Trophy in 1994.</TE>
<TE>   Robert Hodge completed 13 of 16 passes for 125 yards and scrambled
34 yards for a touchdown.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Texas Tech 52, Missouri 38 -- Kliff Kingsbury completed 49 of 70
passes for 510 yards and five touchdowns for Texas Tech (5-3, 2-1) at
Lubbock, Texas.</TE>
<TE>   Kingsbury broke his own school records for completions, attempts
and yards and also became the 20th passer in Division I-A history to
reach 10,000 yards in his career.</TE>
<TE>   He came in needing 182 yards to become the first Red Raider
quarterback with 10,000, and he had that by the first quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Missouri is 3-4, 0-3.</TE>

<HD>First-Place Iowa Pays Attention Just Long Enough to Defeat
Indiana</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Iowa didn't need to play its best to prove it could stay in
contention for a Big Ten title.</LD>
<LD>   Grant Steen set a school record with three interceptions, Fred
Russell ran for two touchdowns and Brad Banks threw for another, but
the 15th-ranked Hawkeyes struggled after building an early lead in a
24-8 victory over Indiana at Bloomington, Ind.</LD>
<LD>   "We didn't play the crisp kind of football you've got to play to
win consistently," Iowa Coach Kirk Ferentz said. "We didn't tackle
well, so it's a little disappointing."</LD>
<TE>   Hawkeye players acknowledged they "lost focus" after taking
control with 17-0 lead in the game's first eight minutes. Iowa, off
to its best start since 1991 at 7-1 overall and in first place in the
Big Ten at 4-0, can now concentrate on next weekend's game at
Michigan. The Wolverines are also unbeaten in the Big Ten at 3-0.</TE>
<TE>   Iowa had 168 yards rushing, 57 fewer than its average, and allowed
Indiana (3-4, 1-2) to run for 146 yards -- the first time an opponent
has topped 100 yards this season. The Hoosiers' Brian Lewis had a
career-high 121 yards on 25 carries.</TE>
<TE>   Indiana had its home winning streak end at six, which was tied
with Minnesota for the longest in the conference.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   No. 11 Michigan 23, Purdue 21 -- John Navarre threw for 271 yards
and a touchdown for the Wolverines (6-1, 3-0) at West Lafayette, Ind.</TE>
<TE>   Michigan matched its second-lowest point total of the season, but
the points came quickly. They needed less than 3 1/2 minutes on all
four scoring drives. Seven plays of double-digit gains in the first
half helped Michigan pick up 190 yards in only 10 minutes 15 seconds.</TE>
<TE>   Brandon Kirsch passed to John Standeford for a 31-yard touchdown
in the third quarter for the Boilermakers (3-5, 1-2), cutting
Michigan's lead to 17-14. But Calvin Bell's 34-yard touchdown run
almost with 12:28 remaining in the game proved decisive for the
Wolverines.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Minnesota 28, Michigan State 7 -- Terry Jackson became the first
Minnesota player to rush for 200 yards in consecutive games, leading
the Golden Gophers (7-1, 3-1) at East Lansing, Mich. Michigan State
(3-4, 1-2) has won only one of its last five games.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson, a native of Saginaw, Mich., ran for 238 yards in 29
carries and set Minnesota's two-game rushing record with 477 yards.</TE>
<TE>   Teammate Thomas Tapeh ran for 147 yards and a touchdown.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   No. 20 Penn State 49, Northwestern 0 -- Larry Johnson ran for a
school-record 257 yards and two touchdowns for Penn State (5-2, 2-2)
at State College, Pa. Johnson broke the school mark of 256 yards, set
by Curt Warner against Syracuse on Oct. 17, 1981.</TE>
<TE>   Northwestern (2-6, 0-4) threatened to score only once.</TE>

<LD>Steve Rubenstein of the San Francisco Chronicle writes that true
Giant fans have come to this conclusion: "There are just as many
reasons to hate the Angels as there are to hate the Dodgers: Probably
more.</LD>
<LD>   "The Anaheim Angels, after all, are represented by a monkey, are
owned by a company that got its start making cartoons and can be
found in the Los Angeles basin.</LD>
<LD>   "The Los Angeles basin, Giant fans know, is the same basin where
Los Angeles is located."</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   More bias: Many years ago, the late Herb Caen of the Chronicle and
Jack Smith of The Times wrote facing articles in a magazine. Caen's
theme was why San Francisco hates L.A. and Smith's theme was why San
Francisco really hates L.A.</TE>
<TE>   Not much has changed. Personally, I've always found San Francisco
to be a charming little place ... cable cars, bridges, foghorns,
steep hills, overrated but interesting restaurants....</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Trivia time: Who was UCLA's first All-American football selection?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Civilized sport: David Whitley in the Orlando Sentinel: "Tiger
Woods hit a really nice shot Thursday. The ball stopped two feet from
the pin on hole No. 3 to set up an easy birdie.</TE>
<TE>   "Woods got to the green, picked up the ball and started dancing
circles around playing partner David Toms. Then he took a magic
marker out of his sock, autographed the ball and tossed it to his
agent, who was wearing a 'Mickelson Stinks' T-shirt.</TE>
<TE>   " 'T.W.'s just being T.W.,' he explained.</TE>
<TE>   "Fortunately, it's just make-believe. Woods did birdie No. 3. His
response was an understated wave to the Disney Golf Classic gallery.
Terrell Owens would call it boring.... In a sports world that seems
to be getting overrun by clowns, golf still hasn't joined the
circus."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Familiar routine: Steve Jacobson of Newsday, on Latrell Sprewell:
"Fining him $250,000 for failing to report he had an injured hand is
excessive and likely will be knocked down by the union....</TE>
<TE>   "However, fining Latrell Sprewell for behaving like Latrell
Sprewell is not such a bad idea.... When he continually walks into
the dressing room late, when he misses a week of training camp, when
he blows off a team workshop on how to deal with the media, when he
blows off a shoot-around, it takes something away from the whole.
This is especially costly when a new coach is installing a new
system."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: Tailback Kenny Washington in 1939.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   And finally: Bernie Lincicome in the Rocky Mountain News: "The Los
Angeles/California/Anaheim Angels have lurched through identity
disorders and several awful baseball movies without winning the
American League pennant.</TE>
<TE>   "So one can concede the laws of compensation without being at all
pleased that baseball has finally put two afterthoughts into the Fall
Classic....</TE>
<TE>   "And the fact it is happening in California is just as appropriate
as it is phony, because it allows the rest of us to take our usual
position on West Coast weirdness, which is to be grateful there are
mountains between us and it."</TE>

<KH>CLIPPER REPORT</KH>
<HD>Wang, Miller May Pair on Pick and Roll</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Elliott Teaford</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There is no way to defend a well-executed pick and roll. It's one of
basketball's oldest and most effective offensive plays, designed
perhaps only minutes after Dr. James Naismith nailed his peach
baskets to the opposite ends of the Springfield, Mass., gymnasium.</LD>
<LD>   One of the reasons the Clippers coveted and eventually signed
center Wang Zhizhi was to run an effective pick and roll with new
point guard Andre Miller. Michael Olowokandi is expected to give the
Clippers standout play on the low post, with Wang adding a deft touch
from as far out as the three-point line.</LD>
<LD>   "We feel he can play with his back to the basket if he's playing
center," General Manager Elgin Baylor said of Wang, who is 7 feet 1.
"We also think he'll be effective playing the pick and roll. He can
hit the open shot and he has great range. He can use his size to his
advantage. He's still learning, still improving."</LD>
<TE>   Now, if Wang can help the Clippers stop opponents' pick-and-roll
plays, Baylor would really be on to something special in his Chinese
import.</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers are expecting quite a bit from Wang, who averaged 5.6
points in 55 games last season for the Dallas Mavericks. Wang spent
the off-season working out and playing in pick-up games with other
NBA players at Loyola Marymount.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers found a translator for Wang, whose English isn't
nearly as strong as his jump shot. Actually, Wang and Simon Chan have
been friends for some time. Chan will travel with the team this
season, helping to bridge the language barrier.</TE>
<TE>   Wang knows enough English to ask to wear a Clipper uniform with
No. 16 on it. The Clippers just happened to have one with his name
and number on the back, delivering home and away versions for his
inspection.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Backup point guard Keyon Dooling got his wish Friday, finally
getting a chance to play in an exhibition game after an off-season
surgery on his sprained left ankle. Dooling played 25 minutes during
the Clippers' loss to the Bulls at Chicago. He scored two points on
one-of-six shooting and had eight assists.</TE>
<TE>   The Clippers hoped to err on the side of caution with Dooling, who
sprained his ankle last Nov. 14 against the Bulls at Staples Center.
He had been trying to talk Coach Alvin Gentry into playing him in one
of the team's recent exhibitions. He finally got to play in Friday's
98-91 loss to Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   Gentry has tried to limit his top players to about 25 minutes
during exhibitions and gave Miller the night off Saturday against the
Detroit Pistons, the Clippers' third exhibition in four nights.</TE>
<TE>   Marko Jaric started at point guard at Detroit, missed all nine of
his shots from the field and had three assists in an 83-79 defeat. He
played 36 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   Dooling played 28 minutes, made five of 13 shots and finished with
14 points and two assists.</TE>
<TE>   It's not immediately clear how Gentry will break up the minutes
for the three point guards once the regular season begins Oct. 30.</TE>

<HD>Play-Action's Thing for USC</HD>
<DH>This One May Mark Start of Two New Eras</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Chris Dufresne</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Saturday's game reminded of that algebraic question about two trains
headed toward each other going opposite directions.</LD>
<LD>   USC and Washington were two 4-2 schools crossing paths at the
Coliseum, yet ultimately bound for different destinations.</LD>
<LD>   USC's convincing 41-21 victory left the impression of one program
finally separating the wheat from a chaff, a demarcation point in the
Pete Carroll era.</LD>
<TE>   Washington's defeat, conversely, may have marked a darker turning
point for the Huskies, who have never finished lower than second
place in the Pacific 10 under Coach Rick Neuheisel, a streak that
figures to end this year.</TE>
<TE>   It was only one game, on one fall day, but somehow you felt the
implications for both schools were going to be long-lasting.</TE>
<TE>   You sensed this kind of victory catapulting USC toward a Rose Bowl
run and this sort of defeat plunging Washington toward leaner times.</TE>
<TE>   For all the talk of how much better the Trojans looked under their
second-year coach, and how this was the dawning of an old era,
Carroll's 10-8 overall record did not quite match the rhetoric.</TE>
<TE>   Saturday, though, offered undeniable evidence of how far USC has
come and reminded you that the Trojans were two plays against Kansas
State and Washington State from being undefeated and, given their
schedule strength, maybe No. 1 when the first bowl championship
series standings are released Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Saturday, USC laid waste to a Washington team some thought would
compete for the national title this year. Senior quarterback Carson
Palmer could not have been more superb, undressing a young Huskies'
secondary for 348 yards and four touchdowns, while the Trojan defense
held Washington to minus five yards rushing.</TE>
<TE>   USC's crushing defeat at Washington State a few weeks ago cannot
be recouped, yet the Trojans now find themselves in the thick of the
Rose Bowl race, only a game behind undefeated Washington State and
Arizona State.</TE>
<TE>   When linebacker Melvin Simmons heard Arizona State had upset
Oregon in Eugene on Saturday, he made a fist with his right hand and
let out a yelp regarding the Pac-10 race.</TE>
<TE>   "Yes!" Simmons said, "We are in this baby!"</TE>
<TE>   USC has not been to the Rose Bowl since winning its last
conference title in 1995, two head coaches ago. And while there are
no sure things in this league -- USC could easily lose at Oregon next
week -- these Trojans at least have the look of winners.</TE>
<TE>   Saturday's victory was critical in sustaining the momentum Carroll
has tried so hard to build, and a 5-2 record makes it easier to pitch
a philosophy than 4-3.</TE>
<TE>   "This sort of gets him over the hump," guard Lenny Vandermade said
of his coach. "For a while we'd win one, lose one, win one, lose one,
but we're clicking way more than last year. Nobody's crying about
playing time; we all want to win. It's just come together."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, in the visitor's locker room, you wondered if
Washington was falling apart.</TE>
<TE>   Neuheisel has had an incredible run in Seattle, somehow able to
pull off one improbable victory after another.</TE>
<TE>   It even appeared for a while that Washington might do it again
against USC after pulling to within two touchdowns after trailing
34-7 after the third quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Washington has engineered 14 fourth-quarter comeback wins in
Neuheisel's three-plus seasons in Seattle, but the Huskies may have
used their last magic trick in last week's last-minute victory over
Arizona.</TE>
<TE>   As it appears now, Washington and Neuheisel may be close to a
crisis point. The team is 4-3 and has lost five consecutive road
games, with remaining Pac-10 road games at suddenly sizzling Arizona
State (next week) and closing the year at Oregon and Washington
State.</TE>
<TE>   "We are a football team that has to do a complete introspection as
to how we're going to salvage the season," Neuheisel said.</TE>
<TE>   Washington has suddenly become a one-dimensional team, relying on
the arm of Cody Pickett and a few talented receivers to win games.
The rushing game, which mostly went backward against USC, is totally
inept.</TE>
<TE>   Neuheisel said Washington fans "had the right to be disappointed."</TE>
<TE>   The program appears in a state of malaise, still shell-shocked
over losing a game it should have won at Michigan on Aug. 31, or
perhaps feeling the ramifications from recent NCAA sanctions leveled
against Neuheisel while he was coaching at Colorado.</TE>
<TE>   These Huskies, in fact, remind of the often undisciplined teams
Neuheisel coached in Boulder, and even Neuheisel admitted he hasn't
endured tough times like these since his 1997 Colorado team finished
5-6.</TE>
<TE>   "You always consider losses like these critical," he said
Saturday. "Our program has been very successful over the last several
years. We're going through a transition that hopefully will come to a
conclusion very quickly."</TE>
<TE>   USC, conversely, has to like the transition it seems to be in.</TE>

<HD>Coach Doesn't Fret Giguere's Wild Play</HD>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>

<LD>Nothing makes Mighty Duck Coach Mike Babcock antsy these days like
questions about the double-edged sword his goalie, Jean-Sebastien
Giguere, has been this season.</LD>
<LD>   At times, Giguere has been amazing, weathering shot barrages and
breakaways.</LD>
<LD>   Yet, there have been lapses, like Friday when Vancouver's Todd
Bertuzzi came from behind the net and banked a shot off Giguere's
shoulder to tie the score with five minutes left.</LD>
<TE>   "What are you guys doin'?" Babcock said when asked about Giguere's
performance this season.</TE>
<TE>   "He's the glue. He hasn't played like we expected ... "</TE>
<TE>   Babcock paused to watch a fight during the Philadelphia-Washington
game, then continued, "Every night it's a one-goal game, if there's
one bad goal and that's the goal that cost you the game, is that what
you mean?"</TE>
<TE>   Giguere was pelted by the Kings Wednesday and stopped three
breakaways. Yet Giguere said he should have stopped the game-winner
by Adam Deadmarsh, which zipped by his glove hand. Against Vancouver,
he twice stopped Markus Naslund on prime chances in the third period.
Then Bertuzzi slipped one in.</TE>
<TE>   "I figure there are a lot of tricky goals that have gone in, goals
that you don't see very often," Giguere said. "I just have to cut
those goals off."</TE>

<TE>   Update -- The Ducks have given up a goal in the first two minutes
in their last two games. "We're going to play the first two minutes
in the dressing room before we get on the ice," Babcock said. The
Avalanche defeated the Sharks, 3-1, Saturday afternoon in San Jose.</TE>

<KH>SPOTLIGHT / WEEK 8</KH>
<HD>There's No Solace for Solich</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Robyn Norwood</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>What should the name Bill Jennings mean to Frank Solich?</LD>
<LD>   Jennings was the last Nebraska coach to lose to Oklahoma State.</LD>
<LD>   In 1961.</LD>
<TE>   The next year, Bob Devaney replaced Jennings as coach, and
Nebraska hasn't had a losing season since.</TE>
<TE>   Solich is almost a part of the landscape in Lincoln after 19 years
as an assistant coach and the last five as head coach following Tom
Osborne's retirement.</TE>
<TE>   Solich played for the Cornhuskers from 1963-65, and was the first
Nebraska back to rush for 200 yards in a game.</TE>
<TE>   He has never been in a spot like this one.</TE>
<TE>   Already unranked for the first time since 1981, Nebraska is 5-3
after a 24-21 loss to Oklahoma State with Texas A&amp;M, Texas, Kansas,
Kansas State and Colorado left to play.</TE>
<TE>   Only Kansas looks like a sure victory.</TE>
<TE>   These are dark days in Lincoln, as people wonder if Solich can
survive, only one season removed from playing for the national title.</TE>
<TE>   It's even harder to find anyone who thinks defensive coordinator
Craig Bohl can.</TE>
<TE>   In a side story, Solich also came under scrutiny last week for
allowing quarterback Jammal Lord to start despite being ticketed for
disturbing the peace at a party, a misdemeanor charge.</TE>
<TE>   The truth is, fans are probably more upset that Lord, the
replacement for Heisman Trophy winner Eric Crouch, is a run-oriented
quarterback who hasn't proven an effective passing threat, running
for 73 yards and passing for 110 in the loss to Oklahoma State.</TE>
<TE>   In another distraction, disgruntled backup running back Thunder
Collins left the team.</TE>
<TE>   The famous Blackshirt defense is a big problem too, after allowing
Tatum Bell to rush for 182 yards Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   And this is a 3-4 Oklahoma State team that was coming off a 44-9
loss to Kansas State.</TE>
<TE>   Saturday's victory was a goalpost-toppler for the Cowboys.</TE>
<TE>   As Oklahoma State Coach Les Miles told reporters last week, 1961
was a long time ago.</TE>
<TE>   "Let me think back," said Miles, who was 8 in 1961, told The
Oklahoman. "I probably had a flat-top haircut and wore jeans and a
corduroy shirt. In the fall of the year, I was probably in somebody's
ditch playing army."</TE>
<TE>   On Saturday, it was Nebraska that had to surrender.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Attention: Ignore This Team</TE>
<TE>   Yes, North Carolina State is one of eight remaining unbeaten
teams.</TE>
<TE>   No, you do not have to take the 14th-ranked Wolfpack seriously.</TE>
<TE>   Not after Saturday's 24-22 victory over Duke.</TE>
<TE>   The Blue Devils, winless the last two seasons, are 2-6.</TE>
<TE>   But with 16 seconds left, they scored on a 40-yard touchdown pass
by quarterback Adam Smith, then recovered an on-side kick.</TE>
<TE>   After three incomplete passes, Duke tried a 65-yard field-goal
attempt that would have won the game.</TE>
<TE>   Kicker Brent Garber's best was 56 yards, and he missed.</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't as much of a longshot as it sounds.</TE>
<TE>   Garber reportedly has made kicks of 71 yards in practice, and he
made a 52-yarder by more than 10 yards earlier in the game.</TE>
<TE>   "We went out there and the wind started blowing in my face,"
Garber said. "That's a tough one. I'm not sure with that kind of wind
I could hit more than one out of 10 times."</TE>
<TE>   He was a good 10 yards short.</TE>
<TE>   But Duke made its point -- N.C. State, which still might go
undefeated into its final game at Florida State, is no contender.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   What a Rush</TE>
<TE>   John Cappelletti, Curt Warner, D.J. Dozier, Ki-Jana Carter, Curtis
Enis.</TE>
<TE>   None of those big-name Penn State running backs did what Larry
Johnson did Saturday against Northwestern.</TE>
<TE>   His 257 yards in a 49-0 victory set the school rushing record.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a heck of a day and he deserves it," quarterback Zack
Mills said. "It's been a long time coming. He's been waiting around
for four years and he deserves every bit of it."</TE>
<TE>   Johnson is a home-grown product. The son of Penn State defensive
line coach Larry Johnson Sr., he played at State College Area High
and has waited for his turn to be the featured back.</TE>
<TE>   Now he's featured in the record book.</TE>
<TE>   "It means a lot," Johnson said. "It means a lot that all the guys
who have come before me, guys I've been able to meet with, like Curt
Warner, D.J. Dozier, Curtis Enis, Ki-Jana Carter and Kenny Watson,
all those guys have always encouraged me in my college career. This
kind of seems that it is dedicated to them, even though they didn't
make the record. It's just, what you saw out there is a part of
them."</TE>
<TE>   Coach Joe Paterno expressed his teasing appreciation for Johnson,
too.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a very aggressive kind, very competitive," Paterno said. "I
don't have any problem with Larry. He works like a dog on the
practice field. He's a little moody sometimes, but so is my wife."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Quarterback Anonymous</TE>
<TE>   Quick, who is Andrew Walter?</TE>
<TE>   Time to get it fixed in your mind: He's the Arizona State
quarterback who set the school passing record with 536 yards in the
Sun Devils' 45-42 upset over No. 6 Oregon at the Ducks' Autzen
Stadium.</TE>
<TE>   Walter took over the starting job from Chad Christenson in the
fourth game of the season, and already has three 400-plus passing
yardage in five starts this season.</TE>
<TE>   The sophomore is starting to stir memories of another No. 16 who
played for the Sun Devils: Jake Plummer.</TE>
<TE>   That's not to say Walter is widely recognized on campus yet.</TE>
<TE>   "There's not much of a buzz," Walter told the Arizona Republic.
"It's not as big a deal as I thought it would be."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Put Him In, Coach</TE>
<TE>   Backups know they have to stay ready.</TE>
<TE>   Quarterback Kyle Keating of Lehigh did his job -- even though he's
the fourth-stringer.</TE>
<TE>   Starter Chad Schwenk has a sprained knee. Backup Matt Shiels has a
broken toe. Another backup, Kevin Weschler, already was out with an
injury to his throwing hand.</TE>
<TE>   So what do you know, Keating got the start.</TE>
<TE>   The sophomore did fine, throwing touchdown passes of 36 and 15
yards as Div. I-AA Lehigh defeated Yale, 14-7.</TE>

<HD>Another Shot for Galaxy</HD>
<DH>L.A. hopes its fourth try will result in its first MLS
title. Revolution will have the home-field advantage.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Lisa Dillman</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>FOXBORO, Mass.</DL>
<LD>This being futbol, not football, it certainly didn't make much sense
to bring up the Buffalo Bills to El Salvador-born and bred Mauricio
Cienfuegos of the Galaxy, a man who has suffered enough in three
losing visits to the final of the MLS Cup.</LD>
<LD>   If 1996 and 1999 were emotionally wrenching, then last year, it
literally ended in tears for the classy midfielder, an original
member of the Galaxy. He sobbed after the 2-1 overtime loss to San
Jose, thinking he may never get another shot at the title.</LD>
<LD>   But the talented Galaxy returned again, facing turnaround artists,
the New England Revolution, today in the MLS Cup, which is the fourth
trip to the final for Los Angeles. But this, naturally, has brought
forth some dire potential comparisons to the Bills -- 0-4 in the
Super Bowl -- even in the usually upbeat weekly U.S. Soccer release:</LD>
<TE>   "Will Los Angeles fall yet again as the favored team in the MLS
Cup, cementing their place in history as the Buffalo Bills of
soccer?"</TE>
<TE>   Galaxy Coach Sigi Schmid and his players are staying in the
present tense, and speaking of the past only when asked about it.
Cienfuegos was one exception on Saturday after the team went through
a brisk workout on a windy day at Gillette Stadium. He was asked what
a victory would represent for him.</TE>
<TE>   "We lose three finals," he said. "This is the fourth time to come
to the final and we need to get it this time. Not for me, but for
everybody. This would mean a lot. We need to win this time."</TE>
<TE>   The angst level appears minimal, however. Cienfuegos and Cobi
Jones are the only remaining members from the first Galaxy team, and
Cienfuegos said there is a significant change between this team and
others in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "It's different. The difference is we play for each other," he
said. "It's like a team now, it's much better. Everybody knows we can
win the Cup when we play for each other."</TE>
<TE>   There are no cheap motivational gimmicks -- real or imagined -- in
motion.</TE>
<TE>   "It's nothing we can change," Schmid said. "It's history. The only
motivation is that we were able to put ourselves into the final again
this year, and we're good enough to make our history on Sunday."</TE>
<TE>   Defender Alexi Lalas concurred.</TE>
<TE>   "We knew all the questions," he said. "It's all the same. Fourth
time back and this and that, and not winning. This core of players
that's been together is completely different than any other team
that's been there. The only history that we bring into this game
started in February of this year, in preseason.</TE>
<TE>   "There's only a couple of players that have been around for the
other ones. You think it would creep in and people would think about
it. I don't think anybody thinks about it at all."</TE>
<TE>   The Revolution's home-field advantage is another matter. Ticket
sales hit 55,000, officials said, and there was a steady stream of
walk-up business at Gillette Stadium even late in the afternoon.</TE>
<TE>   The 1997 final between D.C. United and Colorado at RFK Stadium
drew 57,431, which is the MLS Cup record.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't see it as a disadvantage for us," Schmid said. "I don't
think it's going to make us play any worse. I don't think it's going
to make us all of a sudden forget how to pass the ball. Certainly
there's a point in every game where maybe you get down a bit and it's
nice to have that boost from the crowd. It's something New England is
going to have and we're not gonna have."</TE>
<TE>   He paused and smiled, saying: "We just have to have a loud bench."</TE>
<TE>   The Revolution is expected to receive a significant boost with the
return of striker Taylor Twellman, who finished second to Galaxy
forward Carlos Ruiz in voting for the league's most valuable player
award.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not Carlos against Taylor," Twellman said of today's final.</TE>
<TE>   Twellman has been ailing because of a sprained right knee but has
resumed training, saying Saturday that he is ready to play.</TE>
<TE>   "My knee is something you have to deal with and you move on,"
Twellman said. "It's the final. I'm not going to sit out this game.
I'm going to give it my best shot."</TE>
<TE>   The Galaxy does not have any novel way of containing him.</TE>
<TE>   "We're gonna play him the same way as basically we did the last
time," Schmid said. "We have two markers -- Tyrone Marshall and Danny
Califf -- and one of those two will be on him at all times and the
other one will be on Wolde Harris.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not going to be super strict with it."</TE>

<LD>   Radio -- KSPN 1110 AM (English); KTNQ 1020 AM (Spanish)</LD>
<LD>   Record vs. Revolution -- 1-1</LD>
<TE>   Update -- The Revolution scrambled to make postseason play,
finishing 5-0-1 and securing a playoff spot in its final game.
Goalkeeper Adin Brown, who is 6 feet 5, is having a superb run,
recording four shutouts in six playoff games. His goals-against
average is 0.64. Striker Taylor Twellman missed the last playoff game
because of a sprained right knee but said he expects to play against
the Galaxy. For the Galaxy, midfielder Peter Vagenas continues to
nurse a strained right hamstring. "At this stage, we haven't decided
100% [of him starting]. Peter will play -- whether he starts or comes
off the bench," Galaxy Coach Sigi Schmid said. The Galaxy put two
players -- defender Alexi Lalas and forward Carlos Ruiz -- on the
league's Best XI, a lineup of 11 players based on a 3-5-2 alignment,
which was announced on Saturday night at the MLS' awards ceremony.
Last year, the Galaxy beat the Revolution in the U.S. Open Cup final,
2-1, in overtime.</TE>

<HD>Momentum Will Sit Out Cup Classic</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bob Mieszerski</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>While one Breeders' Cup Classic participant was completing his major
preparation for the $4-million race, another has gone to the
sidelines.</LD>
<LD>   Before War Emblem worked seven furlongs in 1:24 2/5, Momentum, the
runner-up in three consecutive graded stakes in California, was
declared out of next Saturday's Classic because of an injury to his
right foreleg.</LD>
<LD>   Owned by J. Paul Reddam and trained by Craig Dollase, the
4-year-old Nureyev colt, who had been scheduled to work Saturday
morning at Hollywood Park, will be sidelined the rest of 2002.</LD>
<TE>   "We noticed it Friday and he was scheduled to work Saturday,"
Dollase said of the soft tissue injury. "It looks like he'll be out a
few months, then we'll re-scan it and see where we are."</TE>
<TE>   A winner of three of seven racing exclusively on the turf in
England, Momentum has only one victory -- the 2001 Native Diver
Handicap at Hollywood Park -- in nine starts in this country. In his
last three races, the Kentucky-bred was second by a nose to Sky Jack
in the Hollywood Gold Cup, second to Came Home in the Pacific Classic
at Del Mar and second to Pleasantly Perfect in the Goodwood Breeders'
Cup Handicap at Santa Anita.</TE>
<TE>   Owned by the Thoroughbred Corp. and trained by Bob Baffert, War
Emblem, who came to prominence with his surprising victory in the
Kentucky Derby more than five months ago, worked about 30 minutes
before Saturday's first race at Santa Anita.</TE>
<TE>   With exercise rider Dana Barnes aboard, the 3-year-old, who will
be retired after the Classic, started slowly, working the first
quarter of a mile in 25 1/5 before picking it up. He went the half in
49 4/5, six furlongs in 1:12 4/5 before completing the final eighth
of a mile in 11 3/5 seconds. He galloped out a mile in 1:37 1/5.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Heavily favored Gander held off 8-1 shot Compelling World to win
the $250,000 Empire Classic Saturday at Belmont Park. The Classic was
the seventh and final event of a day showcasing New York-breds.</TE>
<TE>   Ridden by Richard Migliore, the 4-5 favorite paid $3.60 and
completed the 1 1/8 miles in 1:48 4/5.</TE>
<TE>   Other stakes winners on the Belmont Park card were: Beautiful
America in the $100,000 Maid of the Mist, Funny Cide in the $100,000
Sleepy Hollow, Dat You Miz Blue in the $125,000 Iroquois, Well
Fancied in the $125,000 Hudson, Rhum in the $150,000 Ticonderoga and
45-1 shot Quiet Ruler in the $150,000 Mohawk.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Only The Best, the 4-1 third choice, quickly opened a clear lead
in the $96,600 Sunny Slopes Stakes and kept on going all the way to
the wire at Santa Anita.</TE>
<TE>   Owned and bred by Alvin Toffel and trained by Brian Lynch, the
2-year-old Smokester gelding won his second in a row and third in
five starts, completing the six furlongs in 1:09.</TE>
<TE>   Domestic Dispute, a 7-1 shot, was two lengths back in second and
Roll Hennessy Roll, who was making his California debut after winning
his first three starts in New Mexico, was third. Spensive, the 5-2
favorite, finished fourth.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Churchill Downs, which had expected to host the Breeders' Cup in
2005, will have to wait a year. That weekend, a Future Farmers of
America convention, which will be attended by an estimated 50,000,
has booked many of the hotel rooms in Louisville.</TE>
<TE>   Breeders' Cup officials were unable to move their racing date
because NBC, which has the TV contract, is committed to carrying a
Notre Dame football game a week later.</TE>
<TE>   The 2005 Breeders' Cup probably will be run at Belmont Park. Next
year's races will be run at Santa Anita, followed by Lone Star Park
near Dallas in 2004.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Perfect Drift, one of the horses heading for the Breeders' Cup
Classic, had a workout postponed because of a foot infection but is
still expected to run.... Gygistar, undefeated in five starts this
year, is out of the Breeders' Cup Sprint after cutting his foot in a
stall accident. Thunderello will move up off the also-eligible list.</TE>

<LD>Junior Michael Haddan of Irvine Woodbridge set a course record to win
the boys' sweepstakes race of the Orange County cross-country
championships at Irvine Regional Park on Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   Haddan, the defending state champion in the 800 meters in track,
clocked 14 minutes 37 seconds over the three-mile course to remain
unbeaten and lower the previous course record of 14:45 set by William
Feliciano of Cypress in 1984.</LD>
<LD>   Senior David Napper of Cypress finished second in 14:50 and senior
Juan Robles of Placentia Valencia was third in 14:58.</LD>
<TE>   Haddan posted the fastest time in the county championships last
year, but his 15:00 clocking came in winning the Division II title.</TE>
<TE>   The sweepstakes races are usually reserved for the top 15-ranked
boys' and girls' teams. But Orange County coaches voted earlier in
the week to allow Haddan to run in the sweepstakes race because they
wanted him to compete against the other top runners in the county.</TE>
<TE>   Dana Point Dana Hills, the No. 8-ranked boys' team in the
Southland by The Times, won its first county title with a 76-point
total in the meet. Anaheim Katella, ranked 10th, was second with 110
points and No. 2 Orange was third with 111.</TE>
<TE>   Senior Alison Costello of No. 5 Anaheim Esperanza won the girls'
sweepstakes race in 17:30 to lead the Aztecs to their second
consecutive title and third in five years.</TE>
<TE>   Esperanza totaled 113 points, followed by No. 8 Dana Hills with
118 and No. 6 Fountain Valley with 138.</TE>
<TE>   Senior Bethany Nickless and freshman Crystal Reed finished second
and third for Fountain Valley with identical times of 17:42.</TE>

<TE>   The Long Beach Wilson boys' water polo team didn't let the tight
confines at North Hollywood Harvard-Westlake ruin their mastery of
the Wolverines. The Bruins defeated Harvard-Westlake, 8-6, in a
nonleague game Saturday at Harvard-Westlake, its second victory over
the Wolverines in eight days.</TE>
<TE>   Wilson (17-0), ranked No. 1 by The Times, held the Wolverines to
one goal in the second half after entering halftime tied, 6-6. The
score was tied, 6-6, after three quarters. Thomas Hale scored his
second goal with 4:53 remaining to break the tie and Paul Sherrin
added an insurance goal with 2:11 to play. Matt Norris also scored
twice to lead the Bruins.</TE>
<TE>   Harvard-Westlake (14-2), ranked second, defeated Wilson, 9-7, in a
nonleague game last season, its first win over the Bruins since 1991.
But the Wolverines have been stymied since that victory, including a
loss in the Southern Section Division I final last season and the S&amp;R
Sport Cup tournament championship game last weekend.</TE>

<TE>   Sarah Fansler, a freshman ranked No. 4 in Southern California in
the U.S. Tennis Assn. girls' 16 division, will not play any more
matches this season for the Dana Hills girls' tennis team, Coach Jim
Wilson said Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Fansler and her parents had agreed that she would play part-time
for the Dolphins (8-2, 6-0 in South Coast League play), ranked No. 1
in the Southern Section Division I coaches' poll and No. 4 in The
Times' rankings, primarily against stronger opponents.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't know until two days ago," he said. "She didn't talk to
me. Her stepfather just left a phone message that she wasn't going to
be playing and they were thinking of going in another direction."</TE>
<TE>   Fansler, who played only in matches against Palm Desert and Laguna
Beach, could not be reached for comment.</TE>
<TE>   There's little doubt that it's a new year and a new girls' tennis
team at Fullerton Troy.</TE>
<TE>   The Warriors won the Southern Section Division II title last
season with superior doubles strength and depth.</TE>
<TE>   This season, Troy (8-3), ranked No. 2 in the Division II poll and
No. 10 by The Times, has a stellar singles lineup but has been hurt
by a lack of depth in its losses to No. 1 Palm Desert, No. 6 Rolling
Hills Estates Peninsula and No. 8 Irvine University.</TE>
<TE>   Freshman Cosmina Ciobanu, the U.S. Tennis Assn. Southern
California sectional girls' 16 division champion, and sisters Serena
and Clare Fermin, who also compete on the junior circuit, bolster the
singles lineup, but the Warriors lost five of six doubles players
from last year's team to graduation.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the opposite of what I've ever had," Coach Donna Judd said.</TE>
<TE>   The L.A. Washington girls' tennis team forfeited two recent
matches because of a lack of players, according to Athletic Director
La Monte Peters.</TE>
<TE>   "There was not enough players to field a team," Peters said.</TE>
<TE>   Marine League matches against San Pedro on Oct. 3 and Gardena on
Oct. 10 were forfeited, according to Barbara Fiege, director of the
City Section.</TE>
<TE>   Washington was able to field a full team of 10 players for a
Marine League match at Carson on Thursday.</TE>

<LD>Driving north along Highway 101 from downtown Los Angeles, it takes
170 miles and close to three hours to reach Nipomo, a community of
19,300 on the Central Coast between Arroyo Grande and Santa Maria.</LD>
<LD>   Known for its large avocado and lemon orchards and rows of
eucalyptus trees, Nipomo is home to the Simonson family, which has
sent four boys to Arroyo Grande High.</LD>
<LD>   Jake, 21, and Jason, 20, played on two Southern Section
championship football teams. Sam, 23, played on one.</LD>
<TE>   The youngest of the brothers, Chad, 17, has been a four-year
starter at free safety. He hasn't won a ring.</TE>
<TE>   "They always have that over my head," Chad said. "I'm hoping to
settle the score."</TE>
<TE>   Arroyo Grande is 6-0, ranked No. 1 in the section's Division IV
poll and No. 11 in the Southland by The Times.</TE>
<TE>   Chad, 6 feet 1, 200 pounds, is considered the best football player
in the family and should be the first to receive a college
scholarship.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a stud," said Valencia Coach Brian Stiman, whose team lost
to Arroyo Grande, 28-21. "He's so physical and so imposing and plays
with such confidence."</TE>
<TE>   Since elementary school, when he was serving as a team ball boy,
Chad has prepared to follow his brothers as an Eagle standout.</TE>
<TE>   "I just remember those guys being so big and thinking, 'Man, I'll
never be that big,' " he said. "It was a rush, a natural high you
can't resist. I was always in the middle of it. I always paid
attention on the sideline or around my brothers."</TE>
<TE>   Coach Jon Huss, who moved from Glendale Hoover to take over the
Arroyo Grande program 21 years ago, is grateful for having the
Simonson brothers come through.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been a great experience," he said. "Their family has
tremendous values. Every one of them has innate leadership qualities
as part of their personalities. They're kind of a throwback group of
kids."</TE>
<TE>   Whether playing touch football or basketball in the backyard, the
Simonson brothers always provided neighborhood entertainment growing
up.</TE>
<TE>   "Whenever we had our family basketball games, it was usually
blood, sweat and cramps before they were over," father Dave said. "It
was not OK to lose."</TE>
<TE>   Dave and his wife, Cathy, have been married for 23 years. Dave is
a construction superintendent who has stressed a blue-collar work
ethic to his sons. He coached them in youth football. Cathy was a
team mom and booster president. Both have emphasized being part of
their children's lives.</TE>
<TE>   "I always wanted rough, tough boys," Dave said. "They're very well
disciplined. We believe kids should have respect not just for their
elders but themselves. They picked up on it. They didn't have a
choice."</TE>
<TE>   Dave insists he never needed a curfew for his teenage sons. Sam,
who's married and has a 3-month-old daughter, disagrees.</TE>
<TE>   "Let me put it this way," Sam said. "He was a little different
when I was Chad's age. Those extra years have mellowed him."</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes more than a dozen family members come to Arroyo Grande
games just to watch Chad play.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a thrill," Chad said. "The adrenaline rush is overwhelming."</TE>
<TE>   The older brothers are still adjusting to being spectators. Sam
was a quarterback, Jake played center and Jason was a linebacker. By
watching Chad, they're recreating the excitement and energy of their
high school days.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a little bit living vicariously through his actions," Sam
said.</TE>
<TE>   Being the youngest, Chad has tried to take something from each of
his brothers' strengths and experiences.</TE>
<TE>   "They all had great hearts," Chad said. "Sam was really dedicated
to school, a real leader. He had a passion for football. Jake was
real tough. He held the bench press record. He led more by example
and brute force. Jason was more a technician. He had great speed. He
was a real big hitter."</TE>
<TE>   Some might consider it a burden to follow three high-profiled
brothers in a small community. Chad, though, welcomed the pressure
and expectations.</TE>
<TE>   "It put me in a kind of leadership position, not just in school
but in life," he said. "It forces you to set a good example and be
the standard everyone looks up to. It makes you work hard lifting
weights, doing well in the classroom. It's made me happy to be where
I'm at."</TE>
<TE>   No matter how much recognition Chad receives in football, he
understands his pecking order among the brothers isn't going to
change.</TE>
<TE>   "They're still pretty big," he said. "No matter how physical I
get, they're still my big brothers."</TE>

<LD>Those who thought Lido Palace had a chance in what is shaping up as a
subpar Breeders' Cup Classic are out of luck.</LD>
<LD>   The 5-year-old Chilean-bred isn't Breeders' Cup eligible and his
owner, John Amerman, elected not to put up an $800,000 supplementary
fee.</LD>
<LD>   So, in lieu of running for a $4-million purse in Arlington Park in
six days, Lido Palace will run in a $58,000 allowance race today at
Belmont Park, the final day of the fall meet.</LD>
<TE>   Trained by Bobby Frankel, the son of Rich Man's Gold will be a
short price to topple his seven rivals as he drops out of graded
company for the first time in this country.</TE>
<TE>   Since coming to the United States last year, Lido Palace has run
in a Grade III, four Grade II's and six Grade I's.</TE>
<TE>   Race of the day: Ain't It Sweep is the 5-2 favorite in today's
$75,000-added Anoakia Stakes at Santa Anita, where there is a
pick-six carryover of $142,856.41.</TE>
<TE>   The six-furlong race attracted seven other 2-year-old fillies.</TE>
<TE>   Who's hot: Beau Greely. The trainer had a double on Friday at
Santa Anita, winning with two comebackers -- Sligo Bay in the third
and Bully's Del Mar in the seventh.</TE>
<TE>   Who's not: Ken Tohill. At last glance, the jockey was two for 67
at Bay Meadows.</TE>
<TE>   Exotically speaking: A pick three using Snowballs Chance and Club
Forty One in the first, Film Critic, Neeshanha, Chapeau and Coconut
Girl in the second and singling Window B in the third.</TE>
<TE>   Winners: Previous day/meet total: 3/37. Money: Previous day/meet
total: $12.40/$216. Total money bet: $260.</TE>

<HD>Johnson Is Rooting for Angels in Series</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>King left wing Craig Johnson may have been rooting against the Angels
in the American League championship series against Minnesota, but
he's pulling for them in the World Series against San Francisco.</LD>
<LD>   That's because Johnson grew up in the Minneapolis-St. Paul area,
but his wife, Brittany, is from Orange County and the couple lived
near Anaheim Stadium for a couple years before moving to Manhattan
Beach last season.</LD>
<LD>   "I have always been a Twins' fan, but ever since I've lived in
Orange County for those years, I started to follow the Angels,"
Johnson said. "I go to a lot of games at Edison Field and I watch
them on television almost every night. I know all of their players
and I love the game of baseball."</LD>
<TE>   The biggest Angels' fan in Johnson's household is his oldest son,
Eric, who attended Anaheim's Game 3 victory over the Twins.</TE>
<TE>   "He used to call them the Minnesota Angels," Johnson said. "He's
always been an Angels' fanatic. He has the Angels' shirt, Angels'
hats and those Angels' sticks that everyone has."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   After having the best power play in the NHL last season, the Kings
continue to struggle while playing with a man advantage this season.
Against the Canucks, the Kings were scoreless in six power-play
opportunities against backup goaltender Peter Skudra. Although they
moved the puck well and had several solid scoring chances, the Kings
failed to score a power-play goal for the third consecutive game and
have only three in 31 opportunities this season.</TE>

<HD>Kings Find Room for a Tie</HD>
<DH>In tightly played contest against Vancouver, they get goals
from Schneider and Armstrong, and game ends in a 2-2 deadlock.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Lonnie White</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The NHL's crackdown on obstruction, which is supposed to increase
scoring this season, certainly didn't have an impact on Saturday's
game between the Kings and Vancouver.</LD>
<LD>   With skating room hard to come by the entire game, Mathieu
Schneider and Derek Armstrong scored third-period goals for the
Kings, who played to a 2-2 tie with the Canucks in front of 16,762 at
Staples Center.</LD>
<LD>   "We are two similar types of teams that are successful playing
with a lot of speed," King captain Mattias Norstrom said. "But this
wasn't a fast game either because both teams eliminated each other
pretty well or two teams that did not play up to their potential."</LD>
<TE>   Vancouver, which played without injured veteran Trevor Linden,
struggled to find any offensive rhythm in a scoreless opening period,
but the Canucks (2-2-2) did a better job of controlling the puck
early in the second period, and that led to successive power-play
opportunities.</TE>
<TE>   But Vancouver, which tied the Mighty Ducks on Friday, was unable
to score thanks to a couple of highlight stops by King goaltender
Felix Potvin, who finished with 17 saves.</TE>
<TE>   Potvin, however, was not on top of his game minutes later in the
period when Vancouver winger Todd Warriner launched a harmless
looking shot from just inside the blue line. Warriner scored his
second goal of the season when Potvin seemed to be screened on the
shot at 13:38.</TE>
<TE>   Although the Kings had plenty of chances, they either shot poorly
or Vancouver's No. 2 goaltender Peter Skudra was able to make the
save for the first two periods.</TE>
<TE>   Bryan Smolinski, who injured his right leg against Colorado on
Thursday and was not expected to be in the lineup against the
Canucks, was involved in plays that had the best scoring
opportunities against Skudra in the second.</TE>
<TE>   Early in the period, Smolinski made a nice pass to teammate Craig
Johnson on a 2-on-1 breakaway, but Johnson was unable to get off a
solid shot. Later in the period, Smolinski had another breakaway, but
his shot from the slot missed wide left.</TE>
<TE>   With Ziggy Palffy, who has played in only two games this season,
being placed on the injured reserve list because of a left groin
strain, the Kings needed someone to pick up the slack offensively.
Schneider and Armstrong did just that in the third.</TE>
<TE>   Schneider tied the score, 1-1, on his first shift of the period
when he scored with a backhand shot from the right circle 41 seconds
into the third. Schneider appeared to be looking to get the puck to a
teammate, but his pass eluded two Vancouver defenders, including
Skudra, for his second goal of the season.</TE>
<TE>   The Kings took their first lead of the game when Armstrong,
acquired in a summer trade from the New York Rangers, scored his
first NHL goal since Dec. 27, 1997.</TE>
<TE>   Defenseman Andreas Lilja set up the score when, from the left
circle, he found Armstrong in front of the crease at 5:57 to put the
Kings ahead, 2-1.</TE>
<TE>   Armstrong was recalled from Manchester of the American Hockey
League on Friday.</TE>
<TE>   The Canucks, who have not defeated the Kings in Los Angeles since
Jan. 7, 1997, were able to tie the score in the third period when
they took advantage of the Kings' failure to clear the puck out of
their zone.</TE>
<TE>   Vancouver captain Markus Naslund fired home a shot from the high
slot that beat Potvin low to his glove side at 10:31.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a slow game that didn't have a lot of big hits," Norstrom
said. "The game was filled with tight-checking and a lot of cycling
on both sides. It just wasn't a fast game."</TE>
<TE>   The Kings hit the road for a five-game trip starting at Detroit on
Wednesday. Los Angeles will play 13 of its next 15 games away from
Staples Center.</TE>

<HD>Star Tour Keeps Its Act on Road</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>LAS VEGAS</DL>
<LD>In eight exhibition games, the Lakers will have traipsed through
Bakersfield, through the Midwest, to here and beyond, spreading the
word of the NBA and their own golden jerseys, Laker Girls in tow.</LD>
<LD>   They travel like the superstars they most certainly are, playing
in the early evening, chartering jets from tiny airports at midnight,
media herd gaining on them by commercial flights the next morning.</LD>
<LD>   Two Fridays ago was Derek Fisher Day in Little Rock, because there
are few finer citizens than Derek Fisher, and because he brought pals
Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant to their town, their hotel, their
streets.</LD>
<TE>   By the next morning, the Lakers were gone and the loiterers in the
lobby gawked not at the fleeing Phil Jackson, but at four obedient
ducks, whose exit from an indoor fountain left tiny dark footprints
on a red carpet.</TE>
<TE>   In Boston and New York and San Antonio, the Lakers are glamorous,
three-time champions and sexier than the local teams, but sightings
of them in NBA strongholds are routine. In Oklahoma City and San
Diego, they are demigods rushed through lines of security guards,
rushed away by the local luxury bus company.</TE>
<TE>   Rick Fox touches their hands and Brian Shaw laughs with their
jokes and Bryant tries to leave them with at least one dunk that will
have them talking at the Dairy Queen the next day. Most nights,
O'Neal, in civilian clothes, follows the Lakers to the floor by five
minutes, and the walls of the arena nearly crinkle with the gasp.</TE>
<TE>   In a sweltering nightclub Friday night at the Palms, the hotel
owned by the men who own the Sacramento Kings, O'Neal stood in a club
named Rain, pulled a microphone to his face and rapped at the people
below. Witnesses said he disparaged the Kings, but that's not new.</TE>
<TE>   Asked to list the benefits of such places, Jackson at first was
typically blunt.</TE>
<TE>   "Absolutely none," he said. "Well, the benefit is you get to play
in front of an audience with NBA referees and test the players in
certain situations.</TE>
<TE>   "There are some things that are refreshing about it. But, all in
all, the travel is much more difficult. Things are much more
cumbersome. However, it's part and parcel to what we do."</TE>
<TE>   The Laker rank and file make the best of these towns, and
management and players profit, both financially and in the manner of
public relations.</TE>
<TE>   In a meeting this week, Jeanie Buss, Laker vice president of
business operations, told the players that the preseason accounts for
about 4% of the team's revenue, apparently putting it in the same
neighborhood as postseason revenue. The Lakers sell out, or come
close to it, in all eight games, all considered home games for them,
though Saturday's game against the Phoenix Suns was an exception:
Huge blocks of seats in the lower bowl of Thomas &amp; Mack Center were
empty.</TE>
<TE>   "The Dallas Cowboys were America's football team," Buss said. "In
a way, the Atlanta Braves were America's baseball team because of the
exposure they got. So, I like to think of the Lakers as America's NBA
team. The way to expose our brand is to take it across America."</TE>
<TE>   The Chicago Bulls had the same strategy in the height of the
Michael Jordan era.</TE>
<TE>   So they go, to Memphis and New Orleans two years ago, and two
games in Honolulu last year, after games in Japan were canceled. Buss
chases new, big arenas in non-NBA territories, rents the facilities
and brings the Lakers. She also occasionally sends players ahead to
market the game. Fisher was in Little Rock, promoting, about a month
before the Lakers played there.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not like the old-time promoters, who got out of town just
ahead of the angry mob," Buss said. "We feel we invest back into the
community."</TE>
<TE>   Said Fox: "We're broadening our appeal, expanding our fan base."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers lost to the Suns, 90-84. Bryant had 23 points as the
Lakers' exhibition record fell to 2-3. Mike Tyson watched from a
front-row seat, but the game lacked the excitement (and the crowd) of
recent years, when the Lakers played the Kings here.... Shaw (groin)
did not dress. Robert Horry, who did not play Thursday in Anaheim
because of tendinitis in his right knee, started against the Suns.</TE>

<HD>La Verne-Redlands Game Suspended After Player's Injury</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>From Staff Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>La Verne quarterback Rollie Dykstra was in critical condition
Saturday night at Pomona Valley Medical Center after he collapsed
with 8 minutes 14 seconds left in the second quarter of a game
against Redlands.</LD>
<LD>   Dykstra, a senior from Redlands, went to the sideline following a
head-to-head collision on an option play. Dykstra kept the ball on
the play and as he tried to split two defenders, he lowered his head
and collided with a defensive player.</LD>
<LD>   After he went to the sideline, Dykstra collapsed and went into
convulsions. He was taken to Pomona Valley Medical Center, where he
was unconscious and listed in critical condition from head trauma,
according to Frank Garcia, a hospital spokesman who said the family
would not allow any more information to be released.</LD>
<TE>   Both teams agreed to suspend the game with Redlands leading, 24-0.</TE>

Starburst Derby, a 400-yard race for 3-year-olds. The 10 fastest
qualifiers in each age group move on to the finals in two weeks.</LD>
<LD>   In the first Futurity trial, Cha Cha Chickie will be looking for
her fourth win in five starts for owners Pam Maloney and Robin Moraga
and trainer Connie Hall. The Easy Jet Too filly won the Red Sky
Futurity on Aug. 31.</LD>
<TE>   Among the older paints and appaloosas, Judys Cash will be trying
for her third win in a row and 10th in 18 starts in the eighth race,
the first trial for the Starburst Derby. Trained by John Bassett, the
Judys Lineage filly will be ridden by Joe Badilla.</TE>
<TE>   The picks: 1. Oh Beda. 2. Just A Berry. 3. Saatin. 4. Cee A Dash.
5. Cha Cha Chickie. 6. Flying T Coyote Ugly. 7. Cabaway. 8. Judys
Cash. 9. By Gone. 10. Rhymer.</TE>
<TE>   Four! Use Dorion and Oh Beda in the first, Just A Berry and Night
Time Dixie in the second, Saatin, Monarchsbutterfly and Papriqas
Tarah in the third and Cee A Dash and Loves That Gold in the fourth.</TE>
<TE>   Shots in the dark: Jacks Gamblin Plan had some trouble in his
local bow and could improve in the fifth for trainer Blane
Schvaneveldt. Traffic Boss should go better in the 10th, his second
start after being away almost six months.</TE>
<TE>   Post time: 5:40 p.m.</TE>

<LD>Kasey Kahne prepared for the upcoming Turkey Night sprint car race at
Irwindale Speedway by winning the 40-lap United States Auto Club
Western Sprint Cars feature Saturday night in front of 3,940.</LD>
<LD>   Kahne, whose last appearance at Irwindale resulted in a
third-place finish in the 2001 Turkey Night Sprint race, battled for
the lead with Bud Kaeding and Tony Hunt. Kahne pulled away despite a
yellow flag with five laps to go.</LD>
<LD>   In the 30-lap USAC Western States Midget series feature,
Riverside's Josh Wise dived under Danny Ebberts with 10 laps to go
and held on for his second victory this season.</LD>
<TE>   The Grand American Modified series closed its season with a 50-lap
Open Competition feature. Series runner-up Travis Thirkettle took
over the lead on Lap 32 and held on.</TE>

<TE>   L.W. Miller passed Jamie Tomaino with little more than 50 laps to
go and earned his first victory in the NASCAR Featherlite Modified
series.</TE>
<TE>   Miller, who led only 10 laps in the first 17 races this season,
beat Rick Fuller to the finish line by 0.779 seconds in the Advance
Auto Parts 200 at Martinsville, Va., to win in his 70th start.</TE>
<TE>   The result helped further jumble the points race, the closest in
series history. Mike Stefanik remained in front, boosting his lead
from eight points over Jerry Marquis to 52 over Fuller.</TE>
<TE>   Ted Christopher is third, 77 points behind, with one race left.
Marquis dropped to fourth, 96 points behind, after finishing 39th,

<HD>DiMarco Shoots a 69 to Keep Two-Stroke Lead</HD>

<LD>Chris DiMarco might not be playing golf for a living if not for Skip
Kendall, who taught him the "claw" putting grip and rescued his
career.</LD>
<LD>   DiMarco has gone on to win three times on the PGA Tour.</LD>
<LD>   Kendall is 0 for 260.</LD>
<TE>   They will be in the final pairing today in the Disney World Golf
Classic at Lake Buena Vista, Fla., after DiMarco shot a
three-under-par 69 in the third round Saturday to maintain his
two-stroke lead.</TE>
<TE>   It seems like an appropriate time for DiMarco to repay the favor.</TE>
<TE>   Forget it.</TE>
<TE>   "My job tomorrow is to not give it to him," said DiMarco, who is
at 20-under 196. "If he goes out and beats me, I'd probably feel just
as happy as if I won. If I play good and somebody beats me, that's
fine. And if it's Skip, it's even better."</TE>
<TE>   Kendall put himself in position to become the 16th first-time
winner on the tour this year by making birdies on eight of his first
13 holes and finishing with a 66.</TE>
<TE>   Despite his only bogey on the final hole, Scott Hoch had a 69 and
also was two strokes back at 198, along with Bob Burns (67).</TE>
<TE>   Tiger Woods, despite a pedestrian 67 on another easy day for
scoring on the Magnolia course, gave himself 17 birdie chances and
was among 19 players within six strokes of the lead.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Dana Quigley shot a bogey-free seven-under 64 to take a one-stroke
lead over Argentina's Vicente Fernandez after the second round of the
SBC Championship at San Antonio.</TE>
<TE>   Quigley is at 10-under 132 on the Oak Hills Country Club course.
Fernandez shot a 67.</TE>

<TE>   Sergio Garcia set up a title match against Ernie Els in the World
Match Play Championship at Virginia Water, England, recording an
eagle on the 35th hole to beat Michael Campbell, 2 and 1.</TE>
<TE>   Els, the British Open champion, beat Vijay Singh, 3 and 2.</TE>

<TE>   Tennis</TE>
<TE>   Defending champion Lindsay Davenport angered Justine Henin, then
defeated her, 7-6 (2), 7-6 (5), to reach the Swisscom Challenge final
at Zurich, Switzerland.</TE>
<TE>   Davenport will play Patty Schnyder, who advanced by beating
Conchita Martinez, 6-0, 6-3, for the title.</TE>
<TE>   Henin accused Davenport of exaggerating a right ankle injury.</TE>
<TE>   "She was taking it too far. I was injured too, with a sore
shoulder, but I didn't make a song and dance of it," Henin said.</TE>
<TE>   Davenport said she would have retired if the match had gone to a
third set.</TE>
<TE>   "I wasn't playing it up. I would have been going home to the World
Series if I'd lost," said Davenport, who lives in Laguna Beach. "It's
not a tactic after winning the first set."</TE>
<TE>   That is when Davenport called timeout to have the ankle treated,
and she often limped during the second set. With Henin ahead, 4-1, in
the second, Davenport again asked for the trainer.</TE>
<TE>   The momentum shifted after that, with Davenport winning three
consecutive games.</TE>
<TE>   Andre Agassi defeated Sebastien Grosjean, 6-4, 3-6, 6-4, in the
semifinals of the Madrid Masters.</TE>
<TE>   The seven-time Grand Slam tournament champion and former No. 1
broke Grosjean to end the match.</TE>
<TE>   Agassi will play 11th-seeded Jiri Novak in today's final. Novak
beat Fabrice Santoro, 6-2, 6-4, in the other semifinal.</TE>
<TE>   Iveta Benesova defeated top-seeded Nathalie Dechy, 7-5, 4-6, 6-1,
and Maja Matevzic won the last 12 games and beat third-seeded Rita
Grande, 0-6, 6-2, 6-0, in the semifinals of the VUB Open at
Bratislava, Slovakia. Grande was the defending champion.</TE>
<TE>   Michael Chang lost to Bjorn Rehnquist, 5-7, 6-4, 6-2, and Robby
Ginepri defeated Michael Russell, 6-3, 6-4, in the semifinals of the
USTA Challenger of Burbank.</TE>
<TE>   Wimbledon men's champion Lleyton Hewitt accepted a wild-card entry
for the Stockholm Open and will play three-time winner Thomas Enqvist
in the first round. Hewitt left the Madrid Masters because of a
virus.</TE>

<TE>   ** Chicago (2-3) at Detroit (1-4), 10 a.m.: Veteran Chris Chandler
gets nod at quarterback over injured Jim Miller. "It feels like 10
years since I've played," Chandler said, proving that the older you
get, the faster time really does fly by. LINE: Chicago by 3.</TE>

<TE>   *** Buffalo (3-3) at Miami (5-1), 10 a.m.: Here's one for you fans
of exotic bets: What will be higher, the number of completions for
Drew Bledsoe or the number of carries for Ricky Williams? LINE: Miami
by 4.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   ** Carolina (3-3) at Atlanta (2-3), 10 a.m.: Panthers lead the

<TE>   * Minnesota (1-4) at New York Jets (1-4), 10 a.m.: If ever there
was a week for Randy Moss to break out, this has to be it. Hard to
believe that by the end of this one, the Jets' 31st-ranked defense
will keep Moss at 8.8 yards per catch. LINE: New York by 3.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   ** Seattle (1-4) at St. Louis (1-5), 10 a.m.: Mike Martz calls
Mike Holmgren "one of the all-time great head coaches." Holmgren says

<TE>   *** Denver (4-2) at Kansas City (3-3), 10 a.m.: If Tony Gonzalez

<TE>   ** Jacksonville (3-2) at Baltimore (2-3), 10 a.m.: Who will win
the Salary Cap Bowl? Kind of hard to figure since so few faces remain

LINE: Baltimore by 1.</TE>

<TE>   *** San Diego (5-1) at Oakland (4-1), 1 p.m., Channel 2, KMPC

<TE>   ** Washington (2-3) at Green Bay (5-1), 1:15 p.m., KNX (1070):

<TE>   **** Tampa Bay (5-1) at Philadelphia (3-2), Channel 11, 1:15 p.m.:

<HD>Dolphins Consider Signing Cris Carter</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The Miami Dolphins are giving serious consideration to bringing
receiver-turned-broadcaster Cris Carter out of retirement and back
onto the football field, according to NFL and HBO sources.</LD>
<LD>   Carter, who turns 37 next month, retired after last season as the
league's second all-time leading receiver. He has been working as a
commentator on HBO's "Inside the NFL."</LD>
<LD>   The Dolphins, who at 5-1 are tied with three teams for the
league's best record, are hurting at receiver in light of an injury
to Oronde Gadsden, who suffered a ruptured ligament in his left wrist
last Sunday and is considering season-ending surgery. Gadsden's
decision about whether to undergo the operation right away hinges on
whether the Dolphins offer him a satisfactory contract extension.</LD>
<TE>   Another Dolphin receiver, Chris Chambers, was knocked out of last
Sunday's game at Denver after absorbing a helmet-to-helmet hit by
Bronco safety Kenoy Kennedy. Chambers is listed as questionable for
today's game against Buffalo.</TE>
<TE>   A Dolphin official said no decisions on Gadsden or roster moves
will be made until Monday, at the earliest.</TE>
<TE>   Miami was one of the teams that considered signing Carter in the
off-season. In 15 seasons with Philadelphia and Minnesota, Carter
made 1,093 catches for 13,833 yards and 129 touchdowns.</TE>
<TE>   --Sam Farmer</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Tampa Bay Buccaneers, who have the NFL's top-ranked defense,
gave defensive coordinator Monte Kiffin a two-year contract
extension.</TE>
<TE>   Kiffin is in his seventh year with the Buccaneers and his 20th in
the NFL. His extension runs through the 2004 season.</TE>
<TE>   Tampa Bay (5-1) has given up an NFL-low 56 points and an average
of 250.7 yards season. The Buccaneers have given up only 30 points in
their current five-game winning streak.</TE>
<TE>   "Monte is one of the best defensive coordinators in the league,"
Buccaneer General Manager Rich McKay said on the team's Web site.
"The continuity of the coaching staff is a priority of this
organization, and extending Monte is a part of that continuing plan."</TE>
<TE>   The Buccaneers didn't disclose financial terms of the extension.
ESPN reported on its Web site that Kiffin's salary will average $1
million annually in 2003 and 2004, making him the highest-paid
assistant in the league.</TE>
<TE>   The Detroit Lions activated wide receiver Germane Crowell from the
physically unable to perform list and put linebacker Brian Williams
on injured reserve.</TE>
<TE>   Crowell has been recovering from injuries to both knees. Williams
sustained a leg injury against Green Bay in Week 3.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Pittsburgh Steeler linebacker Kendrell Bell expects to start
Monday against the Indianapolis Colts despite a sprained ankle that
has limited him to playing in one quarter this season.</TE>

<LD>Myles Berkowitz is a director whose first movie, "20 Dates," is a
humorous documentary about his quest to find Ms. Right. His most
recent project tackles a much darker subject, one that most
filmmakers wouldn't dare touch.</LD>
<LD>   He spent an NFL season with fans of the Cincinnati Bengals.</LD>
<LD>   Berkowitz, who grew up in New York but always rooted for the
Bengals, shot the documentary last year and now is marketing it to
networks.</LD>
<TE>   "It's almost a celebration of fanhood," he said. "What you're
doing is getting a lesson in loyalty, patriotism and passion. But, as
a Bengal fan, I just see the same mistakes on a management level
being made every year.... No one is enthusiastic about the Bengals
anymore. You see some basic mistakes and problems that are just so
simple to fix, but nothing's being done about them."</TE>
<TE>   Berkowitz watches his favorite team each Sunday at Yankee Doodles,
a Santa Monica sports bar, where he can commiserate with his fellow
Bengal brethren.</TE>
<TE>   "You can see the difference in fans there," he said. "Raiders fans
are loud and obnoxious; Giants fans have this pained expression, no
matter what's happening; Jets fans hate Giants fans; Miami fans seem
to have blow-dried hair and are good looking."</TE>
<TE>   And Bengal fans?</TE>
<TE>   "They're always way in the back, next to the men's room," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "They always have this slow, sad expression. The life has just
been beaten out of them."</TE>

<LD>Robert Esche proved he fits in with the Philadelphia Flyers.</LD>
<LD>   Starting his first game with his new team, Esche made 23 saves and
had a roughing penalty, and the Flyers remained unbeaten by defeating
the Washington Capitals, 3-1, Saturday at Philadelphia.</LD>
<LD>   John LeClair and Simon Gagne scored 1 minute 39 seconds apart in
the second period to help lift the Flyers, who are 3-0-2 under
first-season Coach Ken Hitchcock. Washington had won its first three
games -- its best start since opening with four victories in 1997-98.</LD>
<TE>   Esche made his presence felt right away, attacking Petr Bondra
early in the first period after the Capitals' forward fell into him.</TE>
<TE>   Esche, who grew up a fan of former Flyer Ron Hextall, evoked
images of the hot-tempered goaltender by hitting Bondra twice as he
slumped to the ice and covered up.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a dumb play, but sometimes it helps you a lot," Esche
said. "It really got me into the game."</TE>

<HD>Notre Dame Gets Its Offense Rolling</HD>
<DH>Irish ground previously undefeated Air Force, 21-14, to
improve to 7-0, their best start since 1993.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL>AIR FORCE ACADEMY, Colo.</DL>
<LD>The Notre Dame offense finally produced an effort worthy of a top-10
team. That doesn't mean the Fighting Irish defense took the game off.</LD>
<LD>   Ryan Grant ran for 190 yards and a touchdown, and the
seventh-ranked Fighting Irish stuffed the nation's top rushing team,
beating Air Force, 21-14, Saturday night to remain unbeaten and set
up a showdown against No. 12 Florida State in Tallahassee, Fla.</LD>
<LD>   Notre Dame (7-0) won its first six games despite an offense that
was among the nation's worst. The Irish won Saturday by taking
advantage of their size up front -- up to 60 pounds heavier than Air
Force's line -- to produce a season-high 447 total yards.</LD>
<TE>   "I think our offensive line, our backs, our entire offensive team
did an excellent job of execution," said Tyrone Willingham, who
joined Jesse Harper (1913-14) and Ara Parseghian (1964) as the only
Notre Dame coaches to win their first seven games.</TE>
<TE>   Air Force (6-1), playing in front of a record crowd of 56,409,
couldn't keep Notre Dame's defenders out of the backfield and wasn't
able to get around the speedy Irish on the outside.</TE>
<TE>   The 18th-ranked Falcons finished with only 104 yards rushing, 235
below their average.</TE>
<TE>   "They didn't surprise with anything particularly they did. They
just executed very well," Air Force Coach Fisher DeBerry said.</TE>
<TE>   The Irish did it by focusing on Chance Harridge. The diminutive
Air Force quarterback had been elusive during Air Force's first six
games, running for 615 yards and 15 touchdowns -- tied for most in
the nation.</TE>
<TE>   Notre Dame consistently had two players in Harridge's face
immediately after he made the first fake on the option. The Irish
also kept the running backs from reaching the corner on the outside.</TE>
<TE>   Harridge finished with only 31 yards in 13 carries. He also was
only six of 14 passing for 57 yards, and he had a pass intercepted by
Shane Walton in the third quarter.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought they had a good plan and I thought they executed that
plan," DeBerry said. "We didn't block them very well."</TE>
<TE>   Notre Dame totaled 199 more yards than Air Force in the first
half. But the Irish had three fumbles and two missed field goals by
Nicholas Setta.</TE>
<TE>   Carlyle Holiday fumbled on Notre Dame's first drive when he was
sacked by Cameron Hodge, then he put the ball on the ground again
when he was blindsided by Jon Hicks.</TE>
<TE>   Air Force's Marchello Graddy returned the second one 21 yards for
the game's first score.</TE>
<TE>   Willingham said he didn't think the turnovers had much of an
effect. "The mistakes that cause turnovers, I don't think they
bothered our guys one bit," said Willingham, whose team is off to its
best start since opening the 1993 season with 10 consecutive
victories.</TE>

<DH>Bengals, off to another 0-6 start, are the NFL's
laughingstock, and there doesn't appear to be any light at the end of
the tunnel</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Sam Farmer</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dave Lapham played 10 seasons on Cincinnati's offensive line and has
spent the last 12 covering every Bengal game as a radio analyst.</LD>
<LD>   The first job punished his body; the second punished his soul.</LD>
<LD>   The Bengals are 0-6 for the fifth time since 1991 and are on pace
to score the fewest points, and give up the most, in franchise
history. Several times this season, Lapham has overheard visiting
assistant coaches in their booth laughing -- laughing! -- about the
Bengals' ineptitude.</LD>
<TE>   "Some guys come out of their college programs with life in their
eyes," Lapham said. "They're here for a few years and they become
Stepford Bengals. The life just gets sucked out of their eyeballs."</TE>
<TE>   Lest you think Lapham is speaking out of turn -- he works for the
team's flagship station, after all -- consider what he has had to
endure. The Bengals have been outscored by an average of 30-9 this
season, and have fallen behind by at least 20-0 in all but one game.
They haven't scored an offensive touchdown in the first quarter and,
in six games, have enjoyed a lead for 2 1/2 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   "To see the manner in which they're losing is sickening," Lapham
said. "If they don't care, why the hell should I?"</TE>
<TE>   That sentiment seems to have taken hold in the city that supplied
the Bengals with a $450-million stadium three years ago, encouraged
by the notion the team would become more competitive with a
state-of-the-art venue. But the team is 10-28 since moving into
65,600-seat Paul Brown Stadium and has sold out the place only seven
times in 19 home games.</TE>
<TE>   "I've watched this franchise for 12 years," said Paul Daugherty,
sports columnist for the Cincinnati Enquirer. "I ran out of
adjectives for lousy about five years ago."</TE>
<TE>   The big news in Cincinnati last week was what didn't happen --
Coach Dick LeBeau didn't lose his job, as many people thought he
would after such a horrendous start. Mike Brown, who doubles as owner
and general manager, is notoriously slow to fire coaches. Dave
Shula's teams were 19-52 before he was shown the door; when an 0-3
start in 2000 ran his coaching record to 21-39, Bruce Coslet wasn't
fired but left in disgust.</TE>
<TE>   Now, the yoke -- and the joke -- is on LeBeau, a kind and likable
man who took over for Coslet two years ago, at age 63, making him the
oldest rookie coach in league history. The former Detroit cornerback
spent 14 seasons as an NFL player and 30 as an assistant coach.
People who see him every day say there's a weary sadness to LeBeau
now. The stress also is evident in the players, who mercifully get
this weekend off.</TE>
<TE>   "Thank God it's a bye week," linebacker Takeo Spikes told
reporters last week. "It's bad. You can't sugarcoat it. You start to
feel like you're a piece of meat in the ocean and the damn shark is
taking his turn pulling you apart. Now at least the bleeding will
stop for a week."</TE>
<TE>   Things have gotten so bad that Hamilton County Commissioner Todd
Portune has called for the county to renegotiate the stadium lease,
arguing the Bengals are in breach of contract for failing to field a
competitive team.</TE>
<TE>   So the Hamilton County commissioner feels cheated? Get in line. On
Monday, in the wake of a 34-7 loss to Pittsburgh, Spikes said every
member of the organization "from the top down to the waterboy"
shoulders the blame for the losing tradition. A day later, in a
contractually obligated interview with the team's Web site, Pro Bowl
running back Corey Dillon said he will study his options before next
season, hinting he might retire or demand a trade.</TE>
<TE>   "They better get it right, or at the end of the season I've got a
surprise for them," he told a team employee. "You'll see, because I'm
just going to leave it like that. Mark it. Print it. Photo it.... I'm
sick of this ... period."</TE>
<TE>   Dillon, in the second year of a five-year, $26.1-million deal,
would have to pay back $6.3 million of his $10.5-million signing
bonus were he to retire, and the Bengals would be losing the only Pro
Bowl player they've had in two seasons.</TE>
<TE>   That's not to say the Bengals don't have good players. They have
average talent and have done relatively well shopping the free-agent
market, considering many NFL players simply refuse to play for
Cincinnati and some even have clauses in their contracts barring a
trade to the Bengals.</TE>
<TE>   The Bengals would have loved to have Drew Bledsoe, for instance,
but he had no interest in leaving New England for a franchise that
has gone through 12 starting quarterbacks in 12 seasons.</TE>
<TE>   Former Bengal cornerback Solomon Wilcots, who still lives in
Cincinnati and has covered the team as a local TV reporter, then for
ESPN and now CBS, said that instability at quarterback is a major
reason the club hasn't been to the playoffs since 1990. Wilcots has
committed this grim statistic to memory: In the last 2 1/2 seasons,
Bengal quarterbacks are responsible for 20 touchdown passes and 53
interceptions.</TE>
<TE>   "You need hope," he said. "When you look at that guy under center
and you know he doesn't have it, you're not going to win."</TE>
<TE>   Whereas Wilcots stops short of pointing the finger at Mike Brown,
son of legendary coach and Bengal founder Paul Brown, almost no one
else is so forgiving. Even former quarterback Boomer Esiason -- a
Cincinnati icon who considers the team owner a friend -- thinks Brown
needs to wake up and smell the compost heap the Bengals have become.</TE>
<TE>   "There's just this permeation of mediocrity, this acceptance of
losing," said Esiason, a CBS commentator who led the Bengals to the
Super Bowl in the 1988 season. "The biggest problem there is just the
mentality of the franchise, the mentality of the players there. They
have a willingness to give in, to not fight back.</TE>
<TE>   "Dick LeBeau and Mike Brown, those are the leaders of the
franchise. They are the guys you have to point to."</TE>
<TE>   The Bengals have a skeleton scouting staff -- most of that
responsibility falls on the coaches -- and are generally thought to
do a poor job of cultivating talent.</TE>
<TE>   "The franchise is like a flesh-eating virus," said Bob Trumpy, who
played tight end for the Bengals from 1968 through '77. "Good players
go there and get bad. Bad players go there and get horrible."</TE>
<TE>   The most common criticism of Brown is he doesn't have the eye for
talent, or football know-how, of his father, who died in 1991, yet he
stubbornly refuses to hire a general manager who can help turn around
the franchise. Brown declined to be interviewed for this story.</TE>
<TE>   "When you're down as far as down can go, you look forward to the
next week as a chance to redeem yourself," Brown told Cincinnati
reporters last week. "That's pretty much everybody's feeling here. We
know we've fallen flat on our face, but that doesn't mean we can't
get up and get back in the running and be a respectable team. We
think we can, and we think we will."</TE>
<TE>   Back in the 1980s and earlier, the Bengals were among the cheapest
organizations in sports. They practiced at Spinney Field on the aptly
named lower Price Hill, a facility surrounded by run-down industrial
buildings with boarded-up windows. Mill Creek, a sewage-strewn
waterway, snaked past the field, and the smell was rancid enough to
turn stomachs if the wind was blowing the wrong way.</TE>
<TE>   Esiason remembers a time when the equipment men would wheel out
two canvas laundry carts each day -- one filled with socks, the other
with jock straps. Gearing up for practice meant fishing around to
find two matching socks, then grabbing a random jock. Players called
the place "the kennel" because of the chain-link lockers.</TE>
<TE>   But none of that mattered; the team reached the Super Bowl twice
during the '80s and had four winning seasons. Lately, the Bengals
have done most of their winning at the end of the season, when it
only does damage to their draft position. Since 1991, Cincinnati has
picked up 21 of its 53 victories in games played in December and
January.</TE>
<TE>   Lapham has a theory about that: The players are out of shape
compared to those on other teams, so they tend to wear out quickly in
warm-weather games. When the temperature drops, players in poor
condition are not at such a disadvantage. So he doesn't think the
Bengals will make history by going 0-16 -- something no NFL team has
done -- not with opponents such as Houston, Cleveland and Carolina
left on the schedule.</TE>
<TE>   As the Bengals discover new depths every week, and opposing
coaches laugh their way through games, no low seems out of reach.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Lou Piniella met with the Tampa Bay Devil Rays for several hours
Saturday, beginning discussions about becoming the last-place team's
next manager.</LD>
<LD>   The Devil Rays, in a statement, characterized the meeting as
"positive and constructive" and said talks would resume after
Piniella returns from a trip to Arizona, where he will attend the
funeral of a friend this weekend.</LD>
<LD>   The Devil Rays were given permission to talk to Piniella, a native
of Tampa, Fla., after they agreed to provide compensation to the
Mariners in the event they sign him.</LD>
<TE>   The New York Mets, without a manager after firing Bobby Valentine,
are also interested in interviewing Piniella. But Met officials have
been unable to agree with the Mariners on compensation.</TE>
<TE>   "We're still at point A," Met spokesman Jay Horwitz said Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   Piniella and his agent, Alan Nero, met Saturday in Tampa with
Vince Naimoli, the Devil Rays' managing general partner, and General
Manager Chuck LaMar.</TE>
<TE>   The parties will meet again early next week, the Devil Rays said.</TE>

<HD>Buckeyes Have the Magic Touch</HD>
<DH>No. 4 Ohio State remains undefeated with a come-from-behind
19-14 victory at Wisconsin.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>MADISON, Wis.</DL>
<LD>Instead of dancing on the Wisconsin Badgers' logo, the Ohio State
Buckeyes gathered at midfield and knelt in prayer.</LD>
<LD>   The fourth-ranked Buckeyes might have been thankful to pull out
another close road game, edging Wisconsin, 19-14, at Camp Randall
Stadium on Saturday to keep alive their hopes of a national title.</LD>
<LD>   The visiting team has won the last four games in this series, but
the Buckeyes (8-0, 3-0 in the Big Ten) ended a recent trend in which
the victorious players danced on the other team's logo.</LD>
<TE>   Ohio State has only three formidable opponents left -- Penn State,
Minnesota and Michigan -- and those games are at Columbus. The
Buckeyes also have road games at Purdue and Illinois. Because Ohio
State doesn't play Iowa and doesn't have to play in a conference
championship, it could have the inside track to a Fiesta Bowl berth.</TE>
<TE>   "There have been some questions about the quality of our
schedule," defensive tackle Tim Anderson said. "But this was
certainly a quality win for us."</TE>
<TE>   The Buckeyes had struggled in road victories at Cincinnati and
Northwestern.</TE>
<TE>   Freshman Maurice Clarett ran for 133 yards in 30 carries to lead
the Buckeyes.</TE>
<TE>   Clarett had a shoulder stinger on his final carry. But Coach Jim
Tressel said his running back should be able to play Saturday against
Penn State.</TE>
<TE>   The Badgers (5-3, 0-3), who lost for the eighth time in their last
10 conference home games, took a 14-13 lead into the fourth quarter,
but Craig Krenzel threw a three-yard touchdown pass to Ben Hartsock
with 10 minutes left to put the Buckeyes ahead, 19-14.</TE>
<TE>   "I was catching that with every part of my body possible,"
Hartsock said. "It was like there was a baby in there."</TE>
<TE>   The Buckeyes' Mike Nugent made a school-record 16th consecutive
field goal, from 27 yards, in the first quarter for a 10-7 lead and
added a 25-yarder to make it 13-7 after Ohio State recovered a fumble
at the Badger 32.</TE>
<TE>   The Badgers' Anthony Davis had 25 carries for 144 yards, including
a 44-yard touchdown run.Wisconsin fell to 0-9-1 against top-five
teams under Coach Barry Alvarez.</TE>

<HD>Oklahoma Looks Second to None in a 49-3 Victory</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NORMAN, Okla.</DL>
<LD>Nate Hybl kept rubbing his red, swollen nose as he sat deep inside
Memorial Stadium.</LD>
<LD>   The Oklahoma quarterback found it more amusing than painful.</LD>
<LD>   "Sorry my nose is a little swollen," said Hybl, who had taken a
hit from an Iowa State defender. "I feel like Rudolph."</LD>
<TE>   That was about the only blemish on the performance of Hybl and the
second-ranked Sooners, who delivered a brutal blow of reality
Saturday to No. 9 Iowa State in defeating the Cyclones, 49-3.</TE>
<TE>   Quentin Griffin and Kejuan Jones each ran for two touchdowns and
Oklahoma dealt a setback to Seneca Wallace's Heisman Trophy hopes
with an overwhelming effort on defense.</TE>
<TE>   Oklahoma (7-0, 3-0 in the Big 12) outgained Iowa State, 225-4, in
building a 35-0 halftime lead against a team that had been averaging
432 yards and 39 points a game.</TE>
<TE>   "It never seemed it would end," Iowa State Coach Dan McCarney
said. "We could never get in sync. We couldn't get any first downs.
We couldn't get our defense off the field."</TE>
<TE>   Iowa State (6-2, 3-1), in the top 10 for the first time, had been
enjoying a dream season until running into a quick, swarming Oklahoma
defense that frustrated the Cyclones at every turn on a dreary, rainy
afternoon.</TE>
<TE>   A win would have vaulted the Cyclones into the national
championship picture. Instead, they fell to 1-35-1 against Oklahoma
since 1962 and are 0-47-2 against teams ranked in the top 5.</TE>

<LD>It's tough writing about football and trying to get a word in
edgewise during a weekend when everyone around here is transfixed by
noise sticks and video monkeys and pigs flying over Edison Field now
that the Angels are in the World Series.</LD>
<LD>   We've become one obsessed glass-eyed menagerie -- not our usual
condition; knowing what we know, this probably won't happen again for
another 42 years -- but there are hours to kill before Game 2's
opening pitch and an NFL game or two is a good way to pass the time
while icing muscles strained while clambering aboard the bandwagon.</LD>
<LD>   Try Fox's 10 a.m. offering, 49ers at Saints. San Francisco comes
in with the most-talked-about player in the game, a controversial
figure on his own team, a long-ball threat every time he plays, a
potential game-breaker who is never satisfied with the number of
balls pitched his way, as arrogant as they come....</LD>
<TE>   News flash: Barry Bonds is not one of a kind.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, Bonds and his doppelganger conduct their business in the
same town.</TE>
<TE>   It would have to figure, San Francisco serving as stamping ground
for both Bonds and Terrell Owens. Kansas City, Cincinnati, Cleveland
-- those towns aren't big enough (just to pick one adjective) for the
two of them. San Francisco, which fashions itself as "The City" and
the rest of the world -- Paris, London, Rome, Tokyo -- the suburbs,
not only tolerates self-absorption but cultivates and promotes it,
making it the ideal sanctuary for the twin Goliaths of I-me-mine,
Bonds and Owens.</TE>
<TE>   There are some base differences. Bonds was the golden child from
birth -- son of a major league All-Star, godson of Willie Mays,
cousin of Reggie Jackson, All-American at Arizona State, first-round
draft choice. Owens played for a small college, Tennessee
Chattanooga, and was the 49ers' third-round choice in the 1996 draft.
Eighty-eight players were chosen ahead of Owens, who joined a team
that had spent its No. 1 pick in 1995 on another wide receiver,
UCLA's J.J. Stokes.</TE>
<TE>   That may explain why Owens tries harder, breaking out the Sharpie
pen in front of a prime-time Monday night audience. He's playing
catch-up.</TE>
<TE>   Other than that, Owens and Bonds could have been classmates in the
same career-management extension course.</TE>
<TE>   * Carving Your Own Niche: Bonds has done that, turning his corner
of the Giant clubhouse into Barry World, complete with personal
trainer, support staff, reclining chair and big-screen TV. All that's
lacking is a warning sign: "DO NOT DISTURB. LEGEND AT WORK (OR
ENGROSSED IN A FASCINATING DVD)." Owens has done it stylistically,
stomping and dancing on the midfield Cowboy logo at Texas Stadium --
until Dallas safety George Teague evicted Owens from his own niche,
so to speak -- and pulling a pen from his sock to sign a football for
the financial advisor who represents him and the man he just burned
for the touchdown.</TE>
<TE>   (Seattle cornerback Shawn Springs: Just a close friend of Owens?
Or an accessory to a premeditated crime against humility?)</TE>
<TE>   * How to Win Friends and Influence People: Bonds doesn't do the
team thing. He doesn't join his teammates for pregame stretching
drills, he doesn't pose for team photos, he regally waves rather than
stoops to shake teammates' hands during player introductions at home
playoff games. Owens is a 49er unto himself, although quarterback
Jeff Garcia does what he can to maintain their working relationship
-- and Owens once cried when a rare 49er friend, reserve wide
receiver Jimmy Farris, was cut.</TE>
<TE>   * Employer-Employee Relations: Bonds' spats with his manager in
Pittsburgh, Jim Leyland, were legendary -- and, sometimes, captured
on video. Giant Manager Dusty Baker and Bonds have cut their own
deal: You give me .370 and 200 walks, I'll give you your space.
Owens' icy-hot relationship with 49er Coach Steve Mariucci is a
perennial topic on Bay Area talk shows. Last season, it nearly
imploded when Owens chided Mariucci for lacking the killer instinct
in an overtime loss to Chicago, suggesting that Mariucci played too
cautiously in regulation because he was looking out for his friend,
Bear Coach Dick Jauron.</TE>
<TE>   * Life Is Not a Popularity Contest: Showboating is a way of life
for Owens -- "It's a TO thing" -- whereas Bonds picks his spots. If a
certain pitcher has annoyed him, he'll stop and stare at his 450-foot
drive a littler longer than usual. His home-plate pirouette after
taking Chan Ho Park deep in 1997 is just another reason Dodger fans
are rooting for the Angels this week. Beloved by San Francisco fans,
Bonds was booed across America as he closed in on Mark McGwire's
home-run record in 2001. From coast to coast, Owens is viewed much
the same way. In a recent interview with ESPN Radio, 49er defensive
tackle Dana Stubblefield estimated that 97% of the players in the NFL
dislike Owens.</TE>
<TE>   * Just Give Us the Damn Ball: Pitching around Bonds has become the
new national pastime. Unless you ask Owens, who is convinced the
49ers have conspired to pitch around him. No player in football --
high school, college or pro -- throws bigger tantrums when a teammate
scores a touchdown. As Owens loudly reminded the 49ers' bench, and
all of America, Monday night in Seattle: TO wants the ball and he
wants it now. "I was frustrated," Owens reasoned. "I want to be a
big-play maker, and to do that, I need to get my hands on the ball."</TE>
<TE>   One other thing: Although Bonds is edging closer, neither Bonds
nor Owens has won the big one. Before October 2002, Bonds was winless
in five postseason appearances. Since Owens arrived, the 49ers are
3-4 in playoffs -- 1-3 versus Green Bay and 0-1 when playing for the
NFC title.</TE>
<TE>   As Bonds knows and Owens has yet to find out, that is one portion
of your legacy that can't be written by simply pulling something out
of your sock.</TE>

<HD>Georgia Finally Finds Offense</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Mark Richt walked into the postgame news conference with a smile.</LD>
<LD>   "Finally," the Georgia coach said, "we got some offense going."</LD>
<LD>   Sure, the opponent was lowly Vanderbilt, but the fifth-ranked
Bulldogs weren't complaining after a 48-17 victory Saturday at
Athens, Ga. Everything clicked: David Greene's passing, Musa Smith's
running and Terrence Edwards on the receiving end.</LD>
<TE>   "I don't care who you're playing," Richt said. "If you don't
execute well, you're not going to move the ball downfield and score.
We executed well."</TE>
<TE>   Georgia (7-0, 4-0 in conference) had been getting by with defense
and special teams, winning four games by a total of 16 points. The
offense began the game ranked 11th in the Southeastern Conference and
94th nationally in yards.</TE>
<TE>   The Bulldogs piled up 606 yards -- the highest total in nine years
and seventh-most in school history.</TE>
<TE>   Greene threw for 319 yards and accounted for three touchdowns.
Smith rushed for 102 yards and scored twice. Edwards caught seven
passes for 163 yards, including a 65-yard touchdown on a perfectly
executed trick play.</TE>
<TE>   Vanderbilt (1-6, 0-4) was relieved just to make it to Sanford
Stadium. One of the buses carrying players and coaches was involved
in a wreck, but no one was seriously hurt.</TE>
<TE>   "We tried not to let it affect us," Coach Bobby Johnson said. "I
don't see that it had much to do with the game."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   No. 24 Alabama 42, No. 21 Mississippi 7 -- Santonio Beard rushed
for 138 yards and tied a school record with five touchdown runs for
the Crimson Tide (5-2, 2-1) at Tuscaloosa, Ala.</TE>
<TE>   The Crimson Tide held Eli Manning to one completion for one yard
in a six-possession stretch beginning in the second quarter. Manning
was sacked three times and pressured into a fumble and interception.</TE>
<TE>   The Rebels (5-2, 2-1) blew a chance for their first 3-0 conference
start since 1970 and have lost 19 of 20 in Tuscaloosa and 16 of the
last 18 meetings. It was Mississippi's worst defeat since falling,
45-7, to Alabama on the Rebels' previous visit in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   No. 14 Louisiana State 38, South Carolina 14 -- Making his first
start at quarterback because of an injury to Matt Mauck, Marcus
Randall completed four of 10 passes for 52 yards and ran five times
for 39 yards and a touchdown and the Tigers (6-1, 3-0) scored 25
unanswered points in the third quarter at Baton Rouge, La.</TE>
<TE>   Demetrius Hookfin had two interceptions, and the Tigers outgained
South Carolina (5-3, 3-2) in yardage, 132-1, during the third
quarter, and LSU held the ball for 10:52.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Florida 30, Auburn 23 -- Throwing off his back foot just as he was
hit, Rex Grossman passed to Taylor Jacobs for a 25-yard touchdown in
overtime to lift Florida (5-3, 3-2) to a victory at Gainesville,
Fla., after the Gators had blown a 16-point lead in the fourth
quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Clint Mitchell stopped quarterback Jason Campbell on fourth down
in Auburn's overtime possession.</TE>
<TE>   Auburn (4-3, 2-2) scored two touchdowns and two two-point
conversions to erase a 23-7 fourth-quarter deficit. After Florida
missed on fourth and one from its own 42 with 3:39 left, Damon Duval
had a chance to win it with a 23-yard field-goal attempt with 30
seconds left in regulation. But Bobby McCray blocked it.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Kentucky 29, Arkansas 17 -- Jared Lorenzen threw for 253 yards and
two touchdowns for the Wildcats (5-2, 1-2) in a victory at
Fayetteville, Ark.</TE>
<TE>   Derek Abney returned a punt 86 yards for a touchdown, and the
Wildcats had two more touchdowns in a 29-second span after turnovers
for 20 third-quarter points.</TE>
<TE>   Arkansas (3-3, 1-3) led ,10-9, at halftime, but Matt Jones' pass
was intercepted by Mike Williams on the first play of the third
quarter, and running back Artose Pinner gave the Wildcats a 16-10
lead on the next play with a 12-yard touchdown.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Mississippi State 29, Memphis 17 -- Fred Reid scored on a one-yard
run in the fourth quarter and the Mississippi State defense scored
twice as the Bulldogs (3-4) won at Memphis, Tenn. Mississippi State's
16 fourth-quarter points erased a 17-13 lead by Memphis (2-5).</TE>

<HD>There's No Defense for Ignoring Lalas</HD>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Rants, raves and miscellaneous ramblings while waiting to watch the
Galaxy implode -- or maybe not -- for the fourth time in a Major
League Soccer title game....</LD>
<LD>   With due respect to Chicago Fire and former UCLA player Carlos
Bocanegra, it was the Galaxy's Alexi Lalas who deserved to be named
the league's defender of the year, not Bocanegra.</LD>
<LD>   Ignoring Lalas' immense value to Los Angeles as the most quotable
player in MLS -- and indeed in U.S. soccer -- his statistics were
more impressive. For instance:</LD>
<TE>   Both played 26 games, but Lalas scored four goals and had four
assists (both personal bests) compared to Bocanegra's two goals and
three assists (also personal bests). Lalas contributed three
game-winning goals compared to Bocanegra's one, and one of Lalas'
game-winners was against the Fire.</TE>
<TE>   Statistics aside, the fact that Lalas at 32 was able to perform at
such a level should have counted far more in the voters' minds than
Bocanegra's admittedly fine season at age 23.</TE>
<TE>   Then, too, Lalas got his team to the title game; Bocanegra's
barely made the playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Korean Mistakes</TE>
<TE>   South Korea's soccer federation took a large backward step
Saturday by firing Coach Park Hang-Seo, the very man it had said last
month would remain in charge through the 2004 Athens Olympics.</TE>
<TE>   Park was the top assistant under Guus Hiddink as the national team
reached the World Cup semifinals. After taking over from the
Dutchman, he led the team to the bronze medal at this month's Asian
Games.</TE>
<TE>   But he didn't win the gold, the team falling on penalty kicks to
eventual champion Iran in the semifinals, and for that he paid with
his job.</TE>
<TE>   The federation has unrealistic expectations. The national team
overachieved this year, but instead of building on its unexpected
success, soccer leaders in the country are demanding even more.</TE>
<TE>   It would have been much more sensible to have retained Park and
the experience he has gained. Instead, it's back to square one. Bad
move.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   More Stupidity</TE>
<TE>   Despite repeated searches, no sign of intelligent life has been
found within CONCACAF, the loose-knit confederation of 38 North and
Central American and Caribbean soccer federations.</TE>
<TE>   The organization's latest hare-brained idea is to tell CONMEBOL,
its counterpart in South America, that it no longer wants to see
Mexican teams made to hop through hoops to take part in the Copa
Libertadores.</TE>
<TE>   The argument is that Mexican teams have done so well in what
originally was intended to be the South American club championship
that they should not have to qualify at all but instead should be
invited directly into the tournament proper.</TE>
<TE>   Nonsense.</TE>
<TE>   What CONCACAF ought to be doing is not allow its teams to take
part in the Copa Libertadores at all.</TE>
<TE>   CONCACAF has its own Champions Cup, but it will remain an
insignificant event as long as the door is left open for this
region's best clubs to participate in what they perceive to be a more
prestigious tournament in South America.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Rude Referee</TE>
<TE>   Given the way referees are verbally abused by fans, it's a wonder
that more of them don't react the way one of Norway's leading
officials did the other day.</TE>
<TE>   Roy Helge Olsen was handed a one-match ban by the Norwegian soccer
federation for making an unseemly gesture toward fans who were
barracking him as he left the field.</TE>
<TE>   "Referees are also people, and sometimes we react like that,"
Olsen said in apologizing for his behavior.</TE>
<TE>   Referees are people. Who would have thought?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A Lesson for Mexico</TE>
<TE>   Club America of Mexico City, which has won the Mexican title nine
times and is the defending league champion, wanted to celebrate its
86th anniversary in style, so it invited Spanish champion Valencia to
play a game at Azteca Stadium in Mexico City last week.</TE>
<TE>   But Valencia, with commitments of its own, decided to send a
reserve team. As a result, Club America canceled the proposed game.</TE>
<TE>   That should be a lesson to MLS teams and American promoters.</TE>
<TE>   The next time a Mexican club sends an under-strength team to play
in this country, the game should be canceled.</TE>
<TE>   If not, MLS and the promoters are simply ripping off the fans and
hurting the sport.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Arrogance Again</TE>
<TE>   Karl-Heinz Rummenigge is never happier than when he is whining
about some imagined injustice.</TE>
<TE>   The Bayern Munich chairman's latest cause is to get the smaller
nations tossed out of the quadrennial European Championship by
consigning them to a pre-qualifying event that would eliminate all
but one or two.</TE>
<TE>   It's an old, tired and bad idea, but it was not surprising that
Rummenigge unearthed it the day after his beloved Germany, ranked
fourth in the world, was almost tied at home by the Faroe Islands,
ranked 119th.</TE>
<TE>   Heaven knows what Rummenigge might have recommended had Germany
lost, instead of scraping to a 2-1 victory in Hanover.</TE>
<TE>   The suggestion is typical of the former World Cup player's
arrogance and was deservedly stomped on by Gerhard Aigner, chief
executive of UEFA, European soccer's ruling body.</TE>
<TE>   "It can't harm the highly trained and spoiled professionals to
take a look at the reality of life and our continent," Aigner said.</TE>
<TE>   "The matches also give the smaller teams the chance to measure
their progress against the larger teams.</TE>
<TE>   "A little damn solidarity can be expected. Please excuse my
anger."</TE>
<TE>   Excused. In fact, praised.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Just Asking</TE>
<TE>   Fans understand that MLS clubs can't compete financially with
leading European teams for players. What they don't understand is why
a team such as the Shimizu S-Pulse of Japan's J-League could afford
to sign South Korea striker Ahn Jung-Hwan while the Galaxy could not.</TE>
<TE>   And bringing in downward-spiraling defender Hong Myung-Bo next
season, when he will be 34, isn't the answer either.</TE>
<TE>   And Finally</TE>
<TE>   If Southern California really has 90,125 women's soccer fans --
that was the attendance at the 1999 FIFA Women's World Cup final at
the Rose Bowl -- those same fans will turn up in the same stadium a
week from today when the Americans begin defense of their world
championship.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. plays Mexico in its first stop on the road to China 2003,
and if Brandi Chastain, Joy Fawcett, Julie Foudy, Mia Hamm and
Kristine Lilly alone aren't worth the price of admission, who is?</TE>
<TE>   Tiffeny Milbrett, that's who.</TE>

<HD>UCLA Is Out of Its Depth</HD>
<DH>Bruin offense founders after injuries to Paus and Olson,
and Cal ekes out a 17-12 victory.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Henson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>BERKELEY</DL>
<LD>As evening shadows fell on Memorial Stadium three minutes into the
second half, the sun set on the UCLA career of Cory Paus.</LD>
<LD>   As he was being carted off with a fractured right ankle, the
senior quarterback cried out for his teammates to win for him. They
might well have, but his replacement, freshman Drew Olson, soon
departed with a shoulder injury and the Bruins would have been better
off shutting off the lights and sparing themselves the agony of 15
minutes of offensive blunders and blown opportunities.</LD>
<LD>   Two blocked punts in the fourth quarter by the Bruins and a
sensational defensive effort throughout could not overcome a
rudderless offense in the fourth quarter and California escaped with
a 17-12 victory Saturday before 46,697.</LD>
<TE>   "What are the odds?" Bruin defensive end Dave Ball said. "Two
quarterbacks get injured in the same quarter. It was too much to
overcome."</TE>
<TE>   The score was tied, 10-10, when Olson was replaced by third-string
quarterback John Sciarra, a redshirt freshman whose sum total of
experience was handing the ball off a few times during mop-up time
against San Diego State three weeks ago.</TE>
<TE>   He misread the call signaled in from the sideline on his second
play and fumbled, giving Cal the ball on the UCLA 25-yard line. The
Bears scored five plays later on a four-yard run by Joe Igber.</TE>
<TE>   UCLA scored two points on the game's final play when quarterback
Kyle Boller ran out the clock on fourth down by throwing a long
lateral to Jonathan Makonnen, who stepped out of the end zone for a
safety.</TE>
<TE>   Without Paus or Olson, it might be a while before the Bruins score
again. Coach Bob Toledo is unsure who will play quarterback next
week.</TE>
<TE>   "I have to sit and think," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Besides Sciarra, there is Matt Moore, another freshman. Moore is
scheduled to redshirt and was not on the traveling squad. Brian
Callahan, a walk-on freshman quarterback, was on the sideline in
street clothes.</TE>
<TE>   Sophomore cornerback Matt Ware played briefly at quarterback last
season, exclusively running the option, but Toledo said Ware hasn't
taken any snaps at the position in practice.</TE>
<TE>   Sciarra, the son of a former UCLA standout quarterback with the
same name, hasn't taken many either.</TE>
<TE>   "It was kind of weird playing for the first time," he said. "I
have confidence in myself and my teammates. I know they say they
believe in me too."</TE>
<TE>   He did little to inspire confidence during a quarter that probably
ended any hopes UCLA (4-3, 1-2) had of winning the Pacific 10
Conference title.</TE>
<TE>   First came the fumble, then came a botched possession that began
at the Cal three after Marcus Reese blocked a punt with 9:32 to play.
The Bruins were guilty of a false start before the first play, but a
pass interference call gave them another first down, at the two.</TE>
<TE>   Tyler Ebell lost five yards, then gained three, bringing up third
down. Sciarra made a good pass, but it sailed through the hands of
leaping receiver Tab Perry. A 21-yard field goal try by Chris
Griffith was blocked.</TE>
<TE>   "I definitely should have caught it," Perry said. "I feel like
that loss is on my shoulders."</TE>
<TE>   UCLA had another chance, taking over on the Cal 20 when Ware
blocked a punt with 2:31 to play. Ebell, who rushed for 102 yards,
gained three on first down, but linebacker Marcus Daniels tipped a
pass intended for tight end Mike Seidman and Sciarra threw high on a
middle screen to Craig Bragg, bringing up fourth down.</TE>
<TE>   The Bears (5-3, 2-2) blitzed on fourth down and Sciarra fumbled as
he was hit. It was the seventh sack of a UCLA quarterback, five by
blitzing linebackers.</TE>
<TE>   Paus was 10 for 15 for 129 yards, but Swiss-cheese protection
resulted in four sacks. On the fateful play that probably ended his
UCLA career, he called an audible and connected with Bragg on a
perfectly thrown pass for 28 yards.</TE>
<TE>   He was sandwiched by Bear ends Josh Gustaveson and Tully
Banta-Cain as he released the ball, landed awkwardly and did not get
up.</TE>
<TE>   The injury stirred passion in the Bruins, and they scored in two
plays, Ebell runs of nine and 11 yards, to knot the score, 10-10.</TE>
<TE>   "Our leader was down and everybody had to suck it up and get it
done for him," said Ebell, who has rushed for 424 yards in three
games.</TE>
<TE>   Olson, who had played credibly in three earlier relief
appearances, appeared ready for the challenge. He connected with
Seidman on a 49-yard touchdown pass that was nullified by a holding
penalty, but two plays later he was injured on a hit after throwing
an incomplete pass and did not return.</TE>
<TE>   "They were looping linebackers around," Olson said. "I got hit on
my backside and my shoulder hit the ground first.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a shame because we had such a good feeling. I felt it.
Everybody felt it. Now I just have a sick feeling in my stomach."</TE>
<TE>   As did Bruin defensive players, who held Cal to 40 yards rushing
and limited Boller to 13-for-30 passing for 133 yards.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a terrible feeling," Bruin safety Ben Emanuel said. "There's
nothing we can do. We gave a great effort out there. But when two
quarterbacks get hurt, it's hard to overcome."</TE>
<TE>   The immediate challenge is not to allow the season to spiral. UCLA
has had losing streaks of at least three games each of the last three
seasons and is 6-9 after losses in the last four years.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm convinced we'll come back strong," Toledo said. "A couple
real good players are hurt. It's a mental thing too. We lost one of
our leaders."</TE>
<TE>   And a game that seemed within the Bruins' grasp until the
quarterbacks went down.</TE>
<TE>   "That's what hurts the most," Reese said. "We had it. Then we
didn't. Now we have to figure out what to do next."</TE>

<HD>Bruins' Costly Mistakes</HD>

<AU>Steve Henson ;Thomas Bonk</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Winning without injured quarterbacks Cory Paus and Drew Olson next
week will be possible only if the Bruins find a way to cut down on
mistakes. UCLA is the least-penalized team in the Pac-10 but was
called for seven infractions against California, including five in
the first half.</LD>
<LD>   The first two came on special teams and cost the Bruins field
position in the first quarter. A holding call nullified a 47-yard
kick return by Tab Perry and forced UCLA to begin its first
possession at its 13-yard line, and another holding call on a punt
return pushed the ball back to the UCLA 30.</LD>
<LD>   The most costly infraction was dubious. With seven seconds left in
the half, Keith Short was called for not giving Cal punt returner
Vincent Strang enough room on a fair catch.</LD>
<TE>   Replays showed Short was blocked into the vicinity of Strang, who
fumbled the ball trying to make an over-the-shoulder catch. Short
recovered on the Cal 18, but the play did not stand and Cal took a
10-3 lead into the locker room.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the quarterbacks, UCLA had another injury -- and an
odd one at that.</TE>
<TE>   Safety Jibril Raymo separated a shoulder thrusting his arms in the
air in celebration after teammate Marcus Reese blocked a punt in the

<TE>   "I think I hurt it earlier, then when I [celebrated] it popped out
and I couldn't go back in," Raymo said.</TE>

<TE>   A week after missing a 46-yard field-goal attempt that might have
given UCLA a victory over Oregon, Chris Griffith made his first try,
a 42-yarder that pulled the Bruins even, 3-3, in the first quarter.</TE>
<TE>   However, he had a 21-yard attempt blocked in the fourth quarter
with the Bruins trailing, 17-10.</TE>
<TE>   Griffith, a senior, has had two field goals and one PAT kick
blocked this season. He has struggled with a low trajectory, and has
made only eight of 14 field goals. It is one more miss than in any
previous season.</TE>
<TE>   -- Steve Henson</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   He is listed as 5-9 and 170 and Tyler Ebell had another busy day
at the office. UCLA had 226 yards of total offense and Ebell
accounted for 111 of them, including 102 yards rushing.</TE>
<TE>   By the scratches, bruises and red marks on his back and shoulders,
Ebell had the marks to show that he earned all of it.</TE>
<TE>   The Bruins may have lost their top two quarterbacks, which may
mean that Ebell is going to have to carry the football even more
often than the 28 times he touched it against Cal.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm always ready to shoulder the load," Ebell said. "I know we'd
be pounding the ball."</TE>
<TE>   Ebell has 424 yards rushing in the last three games, since he
became a starter when Manuel White was injured against San Diego
State.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Cal quarterback Kyle Boller's 24-yard scoring pass to Tom Swoboda
in the second quarter was his 55th, a school record. Boller was tied
with Pat Barnes (1993-96) with 54. Boller completed 13 of 30 passes
for 133 yards.</TE>
<TE>   The Bears, who had 19 sacks in their first seven games, had five
in the first half against UCLA and seven in all. Cal's defense had
allowed an average of 26.4 points a game.</TE>

<HD>Solving This Problem Won't Be Snap</HD>
<DH>Injuries to Paus, Olson leave UCLA with Sciarra and a big
dilemma at quarterback position.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Thomas Bonk</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>BERKELEY</DL>
<LD>As he watched the starting quarterback break his ankle and the backup
quarterback sprain his shoulder, UCLA tailback Tyler Ebell wondered
for a moment whether he could step in, line up behind the center and
be next?</LD>
<LD>   "At this level?" Ebell said. "Well, maybe, snap me the ball in the
shotgun formation and let me run it."</LD>
<LD>   Maybe it's not that bad yet for the Bruins, although losing to
California, 17-12, losing Cory Paus for the season and then Drew
Olson for who-knows-how-long certainly provides a good test of
whether it's the right time to panic.</LD>
<TE>   Here is Coach Bob Toledo's assessment of what happened Saturday at
Memorial Stadium: "Cory got hurt, Drew got hurt, then it was pretty
tough."</TE>
<TE>   John Sciarra, a redshirt freshman, won the UCLA quarterback
position by default and played at a level you might expect from
someone in his situation. Sciarra completed one of seven passes for
10 yards. He also had a pass intercepted, was sacked twice and
fumbled twice, losing one.</TE>
<TE>   "I just wish I could have done more," Sciarra said. "Hopefully, I
can come back and do better."</TE>
<TE>   As for Paus, there seems to be no hope for his return to the UCLA
huddle. Paus was surrounded when he dropped back to pass early in the
third quarter and wound up under a pile of defenders. His pass was
complete to Craig Bragg, but Paus never saw it. Instead, he was on
his back near midfield, clutching his right ankle. A trainer had to
cut away Paus' shoe with a pair of scissors and after his entire leg
was placed in a protective wrap, Paus hopped onto the back of a cart.</TE>
<TE>   Flanker Tab Perry tried to comfort Paus, who was waiting to be
taken away.</TE>
<TE>   "He said, 'I can't believe it happened like this,' " Perry said.</TE>
<TE>   Paus, a history major, should have known better. One arm resting
on his knee, Paus rode away, the only passenger on the injury train,
straight down the field, disappearing into the tunnel.</TE>
<TE>   Ebell said it was an eerie sight that he won't soon forget.</TE>
<TE>   "It's nothing I ever expected to see," Ebell said. "When he was on
the ground, holding his ankle and screaming, you knew it wasn't a
sprain."</TE>
<TE>   X-rays of Paus' right ankle showed a fracture, effectively ending
a career that earned a place in the UCLA record book and also at the
admissions desk at the hospital. Paus is second only to Cade McNown
in passing yardage, third behind McNown and Tom Ramsey in completions
and third behind McNown and Ramsey in touchdown passes.</TE>
<TE>   But he also had more than his share of injuries. He had recurring
thumb injuries in 2001. As a redshirt sophomore in 2000, Paus
separated his right shoulder on the first play of the season against
Alabama. He fractured his left collarbone in the Sun Bowl against
Wisconsin.</TE>
<TE>   He started seven games as a redshirt freshman, but was slowed by
bruised ribs and a left shoulder injury, then was gone for the season
when he fractured his left collarbone against Washington.</TE>
<TE>   Toledo isn't sure what to do next. He said Olson's injury was a
separated shoulder, but the postgame injury report listed it as a
sprain, so Olson may be back, possibly in time for next week's game
against Stanford. If not, there's Sciarra, and maybe using up what
was supposed to be a redshirt season for freshman Matt Moore.</TE>
<TE>   "I've got to sit down and think," Toledo said.</TE>
<TE>   His players are already thinking a lot about what's ahead without
Paus. It might start with more work for Ebell, who rushed 28 times
for 102 yards and scored UCLA's only touchdown on an 11-yard run in
the third quarter that tied the score, 10-10.</TE>
<TE>   "He's our leader, but if it's John's turn, he has to step up and
contribute," Ebell said. "He just needs to prepare."</TE>
<TE>   Tight end Mike Seidman said the Bruins have to refocus, and
quickly.</TE>
<TE>   "Cory is a big loss, but we just have to come out ready with
John," he said. "Our psyches are shot, but talk to me Monday and
maybe we'll be better. I just know everybody is pretty bummed out
right now."</TE>

<HD>Play-Action's Thing for USC</HD>
<DH>Palmer throws four touchdown passes, three to Williams, in
41-21 victory over Washington that puts Trojans in the Pac-10 race.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Gary Klein</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Turns out, USC did not need its running game after all.</LD>
<LD>   The mere threat of another big performance by Trojan tailback
Sultan McCullough was more than enough to freeze Washington on
Saturday at the Coliseum.</LD>
<LD>   USC exploited the Huskies' respect for the rushing attack and
produced several long scoring passes off play-action fakes in a 41-21
victory before 52,961.</LD>
<TE>   The victory, USC's seventh in a row at home, put the No. 19
Trojans in prime position for a run at the Pacific 10 Conference
title.</TE>
<TE>   "This was a really big opportunity for us," USC Coach Pete Carroll
said. "More important is how it sets us up for next week."</TE>
<TE>   Ah, next week.</TE>
<TE>   USC, which improved to 5-2 overall and 3-1 in the Pac-10, travels
to rowdy Autzen Stadium in Eugene, Ore., next Saturday to play
previously unbeaten Oregon, which lost to Arizona State, 45-42.</TE>
<TE>   Arizona State and Washington State are 3-0 in conference play. USC
and Oregon are 3-1.</TE>
<TE>   "Oregon and the other teams are going to see the tape," USC
offensive lineman Lenny Vandermade said. "If they want to take away
the run, we have some receivers that can hurt you."</TE>
<TE>   Wide receiver Mike Williams, making his first start, was the
biggest pain for No. 22 Washington, which entered the game with the
worst-rated pass defense in the conference</TE>
<TE>   The 6-foot-5, 223-pound freshman from Tampa, Fla., overcame two
early drops, caught nine passes for 159 yards and scored on touchdown
pass plays of 43, 14 and 11 yards. It was the third consecutive
100-yard receiving game for Williams, who started because senior
Kareem Kelly was nursing a sprained right ankle.</TE>
<TE>   "It's no picnic," Williams, who tied a school record with his
three touchdowns, said of playing the majority of snaps. "I'm used to
rotating with Kareem and making cornerbacks tired. They were rotating
a lot of cornerbacks so I never really got a chance to wear one
down."</TE>
<TE>   Junior flanker Keary Colbert doubled the Huskies' frustration,
catching seven passes for 146 yards, including a 61-yard touchdown.
It marked the first time since 1999 that two Trojan receivers
finished with more than 100 yards.</TE>
<TE>   McCullough, who ran for 176 yards in 39 carries last week against
California and gained 132 yards in 32 carries against the Huskies
last season, finished with only 37 yards in 22 carries.</TE>
<TE>   "Their safeties are really aggressive and come up on the run
game," said USC quarterback Carson Palmer, who completed 21 of 34
passes for 348 yards and tied a personal best with four touchdown
passes. "We knew that we weren't going to run for 150 or 200 yards,
but we knew the passing game was going to be there."</TE>
<TE>   USC overcame an intercepted pass on the game's first offensive
play and took a 17-7 halftime lead on Palmer's 43-yard pass to
Williams, his 61-yard strike to Colbert and a 30-yard field goal by
Ryan Killeen.</TE>
<TE>   The 10-point lead provided an unusual cushion for a Trojan team
with a penchant for second-half rallies.</TE>
<TE>   "Coaches emphasized all week that we can't sit around and wait for
the second half and explode; we have to do that from the beginning,"
Palmer said.</TE>
<TE>   The Trojan defense took over after Williams extended the lead with
his 14-yard touchdown reception on the first possession of the third
quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Throughout the week, Carroll preached that the defense needed to
come up with more interceptions against its pass-oriented Pac-10
opponents. The Trojans responded with two in the third quarter that
led to touchdowns.</TE>
<TE>   Linebacker Matt Grootegoed made the first interception of his
career when one of Washington quarterback Cody Pickett's 61 passes
bounced off receiver Patrick Reddick's shoulder pads and into
Grootegoed's hands. Grootegoed returned it 49 yards to the Washington
26 and a personal foul penalty against the Huskies moved the ball to
the 13. Two plays later, Palmer and Williams connected for an 11-yard
score.</TE>
<TE>   On the second play of the ensuing possession, All-American safety
Troy Polamalu intercepted a pass and returned it 33 yards to the
Washington 12. Killeen put the Trojans ahead, 34-7, with a 33-yard
field goal with 4:56 left in the third quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Washington (4-3, 1-2 in the Pac-10) pulled to within 34-21 on
fourth-quarter touchdown passes from Pickett to tight end Kevin Ware
and wide receiver Reggie Williams, but Trojan running back Justin
Fargas sealed the victory with a 13-yard touchdown run with 3:23
remaining.</TE>
<TE>   "We finished strong like we always do," Grootegoed said. "We
opened the door a little bit, but this time we didn't let them get
back into the game."</TE>
<TE>   Pickett completed 34 of 61 passes for 350 yards and three
touchdowns. But Washington, averaging 480 yards before the game, was
held to 356 yards and finished with minus five yards rushing, the
fewest against USC since Oregon had minus 10 in 1992.</TE>
<TE>   "We were plagued by the things that have plagued us all year --
big plays and the inability to run the ball," Washington Coach Rick
Neuheisel said.</TE>
<TE>   Sophomore end Kenechi Udeze recorded a sack, three tackles for
losses and blocked a field-goal attempt to lead a Trojan defensive
line playing without injured tackle Shaun Cody.</TE>
<TE>   Senior Bernard Riley filled in, played most of the game and
started looking ahead a few minutes after it was done.</TE>
<TE>   "Look out, Oregon," he said. "Here we come."</TE>

<HD>Grootegoed Remembers How to Run</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Rob Fernas</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Having the ball fall into his hands was one thing.</LD>
<LD>   When USC linebacker Matt Grootegoed also realized he had an open
field in front of him after making the first interception of his
college career, he couldn't believe his good fortune.</LD>
<LD>   "I was like, 'Oh, my gosh. I'm going to have a touchdown here,' "
he said.</LD>
<TE>   But the running skills are not quite what they were when
Grootegoed was a two-way standout at Santa Ana Mater Dei High. After
returning the ball 49 yards, he was driven out of bounds by
Washington quarterback Cody Pickett at the Husky 26.</TE>
<TE>   Grootegoed's interception set up an 11-yard touchdown pass from
Carson Palmer to Mike Williams, giving the Trojans a 24-point lead in
the third quarter en route to a 41-21 victory. Grootegoed caught the
ball after it bounced off receiver Patrick Reddick, who wasn't
looking for Pickett's quick slant pass.</TE>
<TE>   "I was hoping he would have caught it, then I would have got a hit
on him," Grootegoed said. "But it popped up and I just happened to be
right there.... It was a weird feeling, since I haven't touched the
ball in three or four years."</TE>
<TE>   Grootegoed touched the ball plenty during an All-American senior
season at Mater Dei in 1999. He played running back and some
quarterback in addition to anchoring the defense at safety. But he
has played strictly defense at USC, switching from safety to
strongside linebacker in fall camp last year after redshirting in
2000.</TE>
<TE>   On his interception, Grootegoed ran along the sideline until
Pickett closed the angle on him.</TE>
<TE>   "I should have cut back," he said. "But I opted just to run out of
bounds. The running back skills are lost, I think."</TE>
<TE>   His defensive skills remain sharp, though. The 5-foot-10,
205-pound sophomore entered the game leading the Trojans in tackles
and added three Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Strong safety Troy Polamalu returned to the USC lineup after
sitting out a game because of a sprained ankle and had his first
interception of the season.</TE>
<TE>   Showing no ill effects from his injury, Polamalu made several
cutbacks during his 33-yard return to the Washington 12. The
interception was the sixth of his career and set up a field goal that
gave USC a 34-7 lead late in the third quarter.</TE>
<TE>   "For some reason, I really didn't feel it then," the senior said
of the high sprain on his right ankle. "I let my emotions take
over.... I think it was the energy of having the ball in my hands for
the first time this season. It's always fun to run the ball."</TE>
<TE>   Polamalu aggravated the injury breaking up a pass in the fourth
quarter and took himself out of the game. Afterward, he said he was
fine and expects to play Saturday at Oregon.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Tailback Justin Fargas secured USC's victory with a 13-yard
touchdown run up the middle with 3:23 to play.</TE>
<TE>   It was the fifth-year senior's first touchdown as a Trojan and the
second of his injury-riddled college career.</TE>
<TE>   "I was kind of hungry for that one," said Fargas, who scored for
Michigan as a freshman in 1998. "I saw the end zone and smelled it a
little bit."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Ryan Killeen was shaken up after kicking a 30-yard field goal in
the second quarter that gave USC a 17-7 lead. He had the wind knocked
out after teammate Alex Holmes accidentally ran into him. David Davis
kicked off after the play, but Killeen returned and made a 33-yard
field goal in the third quarter. ... USC receiver Kareem Kelly tied a
Pacific 10 Conference record by catching a pass in his 42nd
consecutive game. The senior shares the mark with Dennis Northcutt of
Arizona (1996-99) and Oregon senior Keenan Howry, who tied the record
Saturday against Arizona State.... Washington tailback Braxton Cleman
caught a school-record 15 passes but for only 69 yards.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Former quarterback Pat Haden was among 24 inductees into the sixth
class of USC's Athletic Hall of Fame, announced at halftime Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   Also inducted were: Football--Nate Barragar, Paul Cleary, Marshall
Duffield, Grenville "Grenny" Lansdell, Jim Sears, Stan Williamson and
Richard Wood; Track and field--Ken Carpenter, Lillian Copeland,

<HD>Scrutiny of Ward Increases</HD>
<DH>USOC will debate its CEO's membership in Augusta, and he
could be forced to choose one or the other.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Alan Abrahamson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The U.S. Olympic Committee will debate chief executive officer Lloyd
Ward's membership in Augusta National Golf Club at the Nov. 1 meeting
of its executive committee, officials said Saturday, raising the
prospect that Ward may face the choice of keeping his job or his golf
membership.</LD>
<LD>   Ward, who took over as the USOC's CEO about a year ago, has
publicly declared twice -- once in April, again a couple of weeks ago
-- that he hopes to work for change from within Augusta National. The
club, site each April of the Masters golf tournament, does not permit
women to become members. Ward is one of a few African American
members of the club.</LD>
<LD>   Ward's pronouncements, however, have not mollified some on the
policy-making executive committee, in particular Marty Mankamyer,
elected in August as president of the USOC's all-volunteer board of
directors.</LD>
<TE>   She said she wants each of the executive committee's 22 members
"to examine the duties and responsibilities of serving as a director
of an organization whose ideals reflect gender equity, fair play,
tolerance and inclusion."</TE>
<TE>   Ward could not be reached Saturday for comment. He has
consistently declined to elaborate on his previous remarks relating
to Augusta National.</TE>
<TE>   It remained far from clear Saturday that the USOC is ready to
plunge into yet more management turmoil. Ward, whose resume includes
a stint as CEO at Maytag Corp., took over as chief executive last
Nov. 1, the USOC's third senior administrator in two years. Since
1978, the USOC has had 11 chief executives; the job has turned over
on average every two years.</TE>
<TE>   Also unclear is whether the executive committee has the will to
take a decisive stand on the eve of a critical decision -- the Nov. 2
vote by the full 123-member board of directors on the choice of the
U.S. candidate for the 2012 Summer Games, between New York and San
Francisco. Both the executive committee and the full board will meet
at USOC headquarters in Colorado Springs, Colo.</TE>
<TE>   After a year in the job, however, Ward's performance has recently
been generating significant internal criticism. For instance, though
he came to the job with a reputation as a marketing guru, and though
the U.S. team won a record 34 medals in Salt Lake at the 2002 Winter
Games, the USOC has not announced a single big-ticket sponsorship
deal since the Games wrapped up. And it's not yet evident whether
forthcoming budget figures will show the USOC in the black.</TE>
<TE>   Given those issues, as well as concerns by some over the amount of
time Ward's other activities have taken him away from the USOC -- he
has served this year on the corporate boards of General Motors, Belo
Corp. and J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co., garnering hundreds of thousands of
dollars in cash or stock to supplement his $550,000 annual USOC
salary -- the Augusta membership has sparked an "emerging concern"
over Ward's USOC future, as Herb Perez, an influential executive
committee member, put it.</TE>
<TE>   At issue, fundamentally, are questions about what moral standards
are most appropriate for leadership at the highest levels of the
Olympic movement.</TE>
<TE>   Other executives who also belong to Augusta National, in
particular Sanford Weill of Citigroup and Kenneth Chenault of
American Express, have in recent weeks issued guarded statements of
support for female members at the club.</TE>
<TE>   Ward, however, doesn't work for a corporation dedicated to making
money, responsible primarily to shareholders. He stands at the helm
of a not-for-profit institution whose central missions revolve around
winning Olympic medals and leading by example.</TE>
<TE>   In May, for instance, then-USOC president Sandra Baldwin
acknowledged discrepancies in the depiction of her academic
qualifications in her USOC biography. She resigned, and has said many
times since that her decision was prompted in large measure by a
belief that more is expected of top leadership at the USOC.</TE>
<TE>   In a telephone interview on Friday, Baldwin, asked about Ward's
Augusta National membership, said, "I think it flies in the face of
everything the U.S. Olympic Committee is all about."</TE>
<TE>   The search committee that recommended Ward for the USOC job last
fall did not know he was an Augusta National member, two sources told
The Times on Friday. If that had been known, one source said,
speaking on condition of anonymity, there would have been an
"absolute demand" that Ward quit the club.</TE>
<TE>   Since taking office, Ward has preached that the USOC's mission
between editions of the Games is winning the "hearts and minds" of
ordinary Americans. To that end, in the October edition of Steppin'
Out, a Colorado Springs magazine, Ward says the USOC's job is to
provide "equal access" to the "Olympic dream."</TE>
<TE>   He says the USOC is "committed to a broad reach into society
across all our demographics. We want to provide more opportunity for
minorities of all persuasions, gender equity in this process."</TE>
<TE>   The apparent disconnect between such remarks and Ward's membership
in Augusta National has already proven exquisitely sensitive for the
USOC.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, for instance, the U.S. Dept. of Education's Title IX
commission is due to hold a town-hall meeting in Colorado Springs.
Title IX is the landmark 1970s legislation that dramatically
increased sports opportunities for women. As CEO, Ward would be a
logical choice to speak for the USOC. Instead, Mankamyer will do the
speaking.</TE>

<HD>Another Grand Season for Cobourne</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>West Virginia running back Avon Cobourne joined some distinguished
company Saturday, becoming the fifth player to run for 1,000 yards in
all four seasons of a Div. I-A career.</LD>
<LD>   He joins Pittsburgh's Tony Dorsett, Wisconsin's Ron Dayne, North
Carolina's Amos Lawrence and New Mexico State's Denvis Manns.</LD>
<LD>   Cobourne needed 106 yards against Syracuse to reach 1,000, and he
finished with 108 in West Virginia's 34-7 victory, picking up the
record on a 12-yard run in the fourth quarter.</LD>
<TE>   "I really don't know what to think, and I don't know how to feel,"
Cobourne said. "I don't know anyone that this ever happened to."</TE>
<TE>   He had to be good -- and he had to be lucky. Cobourne became the
starter his freshman season after Amos Zereoue left school after his
junior season to enter the NFL draft in 1999. Then the heir-apparent,
Alvin Swoope, left the team during the summer for personal reasons.</TE>
<TE>   That left a freshman to carry the load -- and he has carried it
for four years.</TE>
<TE>   By the way, better to pick up the record this week than try next
week: West Virginia will play host to No. 1 Miami.</TE>

<HD>Giant Relievers Use Familiar Formula</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>J.A. Adande</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Angels should know the formula. Get the lead, call in the
bullpen, send in Rodriguez, close up shop.</LD>
<LD>   That's the way they've beaten teams throughout the postseason.
Except this time the San Francisco Giants worked the routine on them.
In their own house.</LD>
<LD>   Felix Rodriguez played the hard-throwing role usually occupied by
the Angels' Francisco Rodriguez, starting the string of three
effective Giant relievers that finished the Angels and Game 1 of the
World Series with a 4-3 victory that ended with Robb Nen's fifth save
in October.</LD>
<TE>   "That's what they've been doing all year," said Giant starter
Jason Schmidt, who gave up all three Angel runs but still got the
win. "They were outstanding. That's why we're where we're at. These
tight games like this, they come in and slam the door shut. That's
what this is all about."</TE>
<TE>   The Giants are now 7-0 when tied or holding the lead after seven
innings.</TE>
<TE>   Their only relief corps blowup of the postseason came when Dusty
Baker sent in Manny Aybar with the Giants trailing the Atlanta Braves
by one run in Game 3 of the division series. Aybar gave up two home
runs, five runs in all, and Baker was almost shipped out right there.</TE>
<TE>   Nothing wrong with Baker's moves Saturday night. He got 1 1/3
perfect innings from Rodriguez, one walk in one inning from Tim
Worrell and a 1-2-3 ninth from Nen, who has 10 postseason saves to
rank him third behind Yankee Mariano Rivera's 25 and the 15 of
Oakland's Dennis Eckersley.</TE>
<TE>   The Angel bullpen did its part to keep it close, with Brendan
Donnelly, Scott Schoeneweis and Ben Weber combining to throw 3 1/3
hitless innings in relief of Jarrod Washburn.</TE>
<TE>   "Both teams have the ability to shorten a game," Angel Manager
Mike Scioscia said. "We know that coming in. We've been great at it
all year, the Giants have been great at it."</TE>
<TE>   The real Bull-pen issues were upstairs in a booth on the stadium's
third floor. That's the domain of Peter Bull, the Angels'
entertainment manager, a title that might be more easily described
these days as the head monkey keeper.</TE>
<TE>   If baseball's postseason is all about second-guessing decisions,
then here goes: Bull blew it. He went to the rally monkey too soon.</TE>
<TE>   The monkey made his first appearance just before the bottom of the
sixth inning, with the Angels trailing, 4-1. He produced his usual
results: Troy Glaus homered to lead off the inning, Brad Fullmer
walked and scored two outs later on a single by Adam Kennedy. They
were right back in it.</TE>
<TE>   But asking the monkey to go four full innings was too much. It was
like a manager bringing in his closer to start the eighth.</TE>
<TE>   The monkey appeared in two skits, making cameos in place of a
dinosaur in "Jurassic Park" and Tom Cruise in "Risky Business." He
jumped around in the eighth and the ninth.</TE>
<TE>   Now, Bull has some steadfast rules he must follow: the monkey
can't appear before the sixth inning and the Angels must be trailing
or the score tied. He'll consult with others around him, such as the
Jumbotron director, if he's having doubts.</TE>
<TE>   "But ultimately, I've got to make the call," Bull said.</TE>
<TE>   Listening to Bull explain his decision sounded a lot like Scioscia
defending his use of Troy Percival in the opening-game loss of the
Yankee series.</TE>
<TE>   "Honestly, it sounds strange, but we're sticking with what we've
done during the regular season," Bull said. "There's a little more
pressure, but it's basically the same baseball game."</TE>
<TE>   After all that work, there must be some doubt about the monkey's
availability for Game 2. "If we need him again, we'll use him," Bull
said. "I don't think he's worn out. I wouldn't say that."</TE>
<TE>   Despite his efforts, he couldn't get the job done Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   "If it's got them a few wins, that's great, but I've yet to see
him get a hit or throw a strike or get somebody out," Giant first
baseman J.T. Snow said.</TE>
<TE>   "The rally monkey doesn't talk," Nen said. "It's the people
screaming and yelling. So you block out the people.</TE>
<TE>   "You go out there and focus and you don't hear the noise at all.
You're really focused.</TE>
<TE>   "When you need to make a pitch, your focus gets higher, your
adrenaline gets higher. You can't make a mistake."</TE>
<TE>   Rodriguez said the big crowds at Pacific Bell Park all season
helped them prepare for the red-clad, noise-sticks-banging throng at
Edison Field.</TE>
<TE>   "We're used to playing in front of a sellout crowd," Rodriguez
said. "It's no big deal."</TE>
<TE>   The Angels, on the other hand, aren't accustomed to facing these
National League relievers. The Angels and Giants didn't face each
other in interleague play this year.</TE>
<TE>   "You always like to feel comfortable facing guys and knowing what
they've got," Tim Salmon said. "When you're facing guys coming out of
the pen throwing 94, 95 [miles per hour], I mean those aren't exactly
guys you want to be giving strikes to. It makes it tough.</TE>
<TE>   "Hopefully they make a mistake and leave something out over the
plate you can handle."</TE>
<TE>   Don't expect it, not the way the Giants have been going.</TE>
<TE>   "The bullpen's been doing a great job," Giant catcher Benito
Santiago said.</TE>
<TE>   "Especially Rodriguez. Rodriguez, coming up and throwing heat, and
Worrell ... and Robb Nen, everybody knows what he can do."</TE>
<TE>   At least everyone who has seen it knows. They're good enough to
get the better of a potent Angel lineup -- and one magical monkey.</TE>

<LD>David Eckstein looks down on few men -- literally speaking -- but the
Angels' mighty little catalyst can look down upon the original
leadoff hitter in franchise history.</LD>
<LD>   Eckstein, the Angel shortstop, stands a couple eyelashes taller
than 5 feet 6. Albie Pearson, the center fielder and leadoff hitter
for the Angels from 1961 to '66, doesn't quite measure up.</LD>
<LD>   "He's a monster compared to me," Pearson said with a laugh.</LD>
<TE>   Pearson, at 5 feet 5, scored the first run in franchise history in
1961, led the American League in runs in 1962 and made the All-Star
team in 1963. He attended Saturday's World Series opener, happily
cheering for the little kid at shortstop.</TE>
<TE>   "He's big," Pearson said, "as the key and the spark the Angels
have needed. He even gets hit in the rear end when he needs to. Those
are the intangible things that win ballgames.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm tickled to watch him play. It brings back a lot of memories."</TE>
<TE>   After his retirement as a player, Pearson became a minister. Next
month, after five years of construction and fund-raising, Pearson
will open the gates to Father's Heart Ranch in Desert Hot Springs, an
11-acre home for abused, neglected and abandoned children.</TE>

<HD>No Infield Shift Could Contain Bonds' Blast</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL SHAIKIN, LARRY STEWART and MIKE DIGIOVANNA</AU>
<BD>From Staff Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Yeah, that Bonds guy is a pretty good hitter after all. In his first
at-bat of the World Series, Barry Bonds crushed a fastball from
Jarrod Washburn, a shot hit so hard that replays caught Washburn
smiling.</LD>
<LD>   The scouting report was simple, and correct: Throw a fastball over
the plate, and kiss it goodbye.</LD>
<LD>   The distance of the home run was estimated at 418 feet.</LD>
<TE>   "That's it?" Washburn said. "That had to be at least 450."</TE>
<TE>   The Angels contained Bonds, who in addition to that solo home run
struck out, grounded out and walked. They defended him with an
exaggerated version of the shift they used against Jason Giambi of
the New York Yankees and Jim Thome of the Cleveland Indians, with
second baseman Adam Kennedy playing short right field, shortstop
David Eckstein playing second base and third baseman Troy Glaus
playing shortstop.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels have considered a number of defensive options against
Bonds, including playing four outfielders and leaving the left side
of the infield vacant. Ron Roenicke, the Angels' outfield coach, said
only that "there are other scenarios we have come up with that we may
go with."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Fox and baseball officials were more than a little concerned about
all the aircraft flying over Edison Field on Saturday night.</TE>
<TE>   David Hill, Fox Sports chairman, said, "When you consider the NFL
demands a three-mile radius no-fly zone around any NFL event, to see
the skies above Edison Field filled with aircraft pulling banners was
ludicrous. It was like everyone had forgotten the dangers of
terrorism."</TE>
<TE>   Tim Bronsan, Major League Baseball executive vice president, said,
"The TSA [Transportation Security Administration] made the wrong
call, plain and simple."</TE>
<TE>   The government agency OKd the aircraft advertising. One plane was
even advertising an 800 number to call to order a banner at $500 a
half-hour.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Fox's Steve Lyons, working the World Series as a field reporter,
said he apologized to Jackie Autry for calling her "Mrs. Jean Yawkey"
when he interviewed her after Game 5 of the American League
championship series.</TE>
<TE>   There is a Mrs. Jean Yawkey. She is the widow of former Boston Red
Sox owner Tom Yawkey.</TE>
<TE>   Lyons said Autry accepted his apology.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   As players milled around the batting cage before the game, Bonds
and Angel first baseman Scott Spiezio broke up laughing. Neither team
had played since Monday.</TE>
<TE>   "He told me he felt like he hadn't played in 10 days," Spiezio
said. "I said, yeah, you're just trying to set us up."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Angel right-hander Aaron Sele underwent arthroscopic surgery
Friday to repair the torn rotator cuff in his right shoulder. Dr.
Lewis Yocum, who performed the operation, said Sele would be ready
for spring training.</TE>
<TE>   Sele, 32, was diagnosed with the injury Aug. 21 but opted for
therapy rather than surgery in the hope of returning this season. He
started the final game of the regular season, but the Angels left him
off the playoff roster.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels signed Sele to a three-year, $24-million contract in
December, the largest contract awarded to a free-agent pitcher in
club history. In his first season, he went 8-9 with a 4.89 earned-run
average.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Shigetoshi Hasegawa traded in his uniform for a blazer and slacks
Saturday, working the World Series as a broadcaster for the Japanese
television network NHK. Hasegawa pitched for the Angels for five
years before signing as a free agent with the Seattle Mariners this
year.</TE>
<TE>   The Mariners missed the playoffs for the first time in three
years. The Angels made it for the first time in 16 years.</TE>
<TE>   "Good for them. That's what I always wanted here," Hasegawa said.
"Unfortunately, I picked Seattle this year."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Angels added four banners along the outfield fence at Edison
Field, one in honor of this year's American League champions and
three commemorating the division champions of 1979, 1982 and 1986.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Seated behind Commissioner Bud Selig in the first row next to the
Angel dugout was former commissioner Peter Ueberroth, who lost out to
Disney in a bid to purchase the Angels from the Autry family in 1996
and is interested in buying the team again.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Garret Anderson has been bothered by a tight hamstring the latter
part of the season, according to Angel Manager Mike Scioscia.
Anderson's health became an issue when he was unable to score on
Spiezio's double in the fourth inning. "He's still not 100%," said
Scioscia.</TE>

<LD>FIRST INNING</LD>
<LD>   GIANTS: Angels 0, Giants 0--Fox opens with a song by Bruce
Springsteen, which proves at least one person at Fox has some sense.
Kenny Lofton struck out swinging at ball four. Rich Aurilia popped to
third. Troy Glaus and David Eckstein almost collided, but Eckstein is
so short he ran right under Glaus' arms. Jeff Kent struck out
swinging. No runs, no hits.</LD>
<LD>   ANGELS: Angels 0, Giants 0--In tribute to Tim McCarver, this
half-inning's play-by-play will be one giant run-on sentence that
will meander aimlessly, only occasionally giving actual information
about the game. OK, maybe not. Eckstein lined to left. Darin Erstad
flied to left. Tim Salmon struck out swinging. No runs, no hits.</LD>
<TE>   SECOND INNING</TE>
<TE>   GIANTS: Giants 2, Angels 0--On a 2-and-1 pitch, Barry Bonds
homered to deep right. Jarrod Washburn just shrugged his shoulders.
Here's a tip, you really shouldn't give Bonds a belt-high fastball
right down the middle of the plate. Benito Santiago grounded to
third. Reggie Sanders homered to right. J.T. Snow grounded to second.
David Bell grounded to third. Two runs, two hits.</TE>
<TE>   ANGELS: Giants 2, Angels 1--Garret Anderson struck out swinging.
Another "Sounds of the Game" and Bud Black still hasn't referred to
an Angel pitcher by name. That's why he didn't want the Indians' job,
he didn't want to call 25 guys "Hey". Troy Glaus homered to left,
awakening the fans. Brad Fullmer singled to right. Scott Spiezio
flied to center. Fullmer stole second. Actually, he was out but the
umpire called him safe. John Travolta and Tim Allen are at the game.
Probably discussing whose career is fading faster. Bengie Molina
flied to left. One run, two hits, one left.</TE>
<TE>   THIRD INNING</TE>
<TE>   GIANTS: Giants 2, Angels 1--Has anyone ever seen Jarrod Washburn
and Kiefer Sutherland in the same room together? Is this whole World
Series just part of a plot to get more advertising for "24"? Tsuyoshi
Shinjo struck out swinging. Longtime Angel fan Tom Lasorda is at the
game. Lofton flied to center. Aurilia grounded to short. No runs, no
hits.</TE>
<TE>   ANGELS: Giants 2, Angels 1--Adam Kennedy almost hit his fourth
homer in two games, but had to settle for a double on a drive hit off
the top of the right-field wall. Eckstein, who fouled off several
two-strike pitches, hit a ground ball to the right side, advancing
Kennedy to third. Nice piece of hitting. Erstad struck out swinging
at a pitch way out of the strike zone. Salmon flied to center. No
runs, one hit, one left.</TE>
<TE>   FOURTH INNING</TE>
<TE>   GIANTS: Giants 2, Angels 1--The cast of "FastLane" is at the show.
Sitting in the third row. Meanwhile, real Angel fans are unable to
get seats. Kent grounded to short. Bonds struck out swinging at a
pitch that was too high. Santiago singled to center. Sanders walked.
Snow fouled off several full-count pitches and drew a walk. Nice
at-bat by Snow, who has a lot of trouble hitting left-handers. The
bases are loaded. Bell popped to short right, Salmon called off
Spiezio and Kennedy to make the catch. No runs, one hit, three left.</TE>
<TE>   ANGELS: Giants 2, Angels 1--Anderson singled to right. Glaus
popped to second. Fullmer struck out swinging. The Angels are trying
to swing for the seats instead of just putting the ball into play.
Spiezio doubled down the right-field line, Anderson to third. The
ball was hit so hard, Anderson didn't have a chance to score. Molina
grounded to third. No runs, two hits, two left.</TE>
<TE>   FIFTH INNING</TE>
<TE>   GIANTS: Giants 2, Angels 1--Shinjo singled to right-center. Lofton
sacrificed. Aurilia hit a broken-bat fly ball to left. Someone should
send the bat to Mark Cresse, so he can make a lamp out of it. Kent
grounded to short, Eckstein bobbled the ball and then put every ounce
of his energy into his throw to first. Kent was out by a mile. No
runs, one hit, one left.</TE>
<TE>   ANGELS: Giants 2, Angels 1--Kennedy struck out swinging. Typical
Adam Kennedy at-bat, it's either all or nothing. Eckstein hit a
grounder up the middle. Kent made a diving stop but was unable to
throw out Eckstein. See Jeff, that's how you run out a ground ball.
Erstad singled to center, Eckstein to third. Salmon popped to Snow,
who slipped and fell but had enough time to get up and make the
catch. A really nice play by Snow. Anderson struck out swinging. No
runs, two hits, two left.</TE>
<TE>   SIXTH INNING</TE>
<TE>   GIANTS: Giants 4, Angels 1--Bonds hit a bad-hop grounder to first.
Spiezio stayed with it and threw to Washburn covering. Charlie Hough
is at the game. Reggie Jackson has bought tickets for Hough, Elias
Sosa and Burt Hooton for every World Series game since Game 6, 1977.
Santiago struck out swinging. Sanders singled to left. Snow, of all
people, homered to left-center. Brendan Donnelly pitching. Bell
fouled to left. Two runs, two hits, none left.</TE>
<TE>   ANGELS: Giants 4, Angels 3--Glaus homered to left. Another solo
homer. At this rate, Glaus will end the playoffs with fewer RBIs than
homers. Fullmer walked. Spiezio flied to right. Molina grounded to
third, Fullmer to second. Kennedy singled to right, Fullmer scored.
Felix Rodriguez pitching. Eckstein lined to short. Two runs, two
hits, one left.</TE>
<TE>   SEVENTH INNING</TE>
<TE>   GIANTS: Giants 4, Angels 3--Shinjo grounded to third. Lofton
popped to left, Anderson made a nice sliding catch. Aurilia grounded
to third. No runs, no hits.</TE>
<TE>   ANGELS: Giants 4, Angels 3--Erstad, who suddenly thinks he is Mark
McGwire, struck out swinging. Salmon lined to right. Where's the kid
in the monkey suit? Anderson grounded to second. No runs, no hits.</TE>
<TE>   EIGHTH INNING</TE>
<TE>   GIANTS: Giants 4, Angels 3--Kent lined to short. Eckstein dropped
the ball but had plenty of time to retire Kent. Scott Schoeneweis
pitching. Bonds walked on four pitches. Good thing Scioscia brought
in a left-hander to do that. Ben Weber pitching. With Bonds running,
Santiago grounded to short, Bonds stopping at second. Sanders struck
out swinging. No runs, no hits, one left.</TE>
<TE>   ANGELS: Giants 4, Angels 3--Tim Worrell pitching. Glaus took
strike three right down the middle. You really need to swing at that
pitch. Fullmer grounded to second. Spiezio walked. Chone Figgins ran
for Spiezio. Is Figgins related to Herb Washington? Orlando Palmeiro,
hitting for Molina, fouled to third. Still no sign of the kid in the
monkey suit. No runs, no hits, one left.</TE>
<TE>   NINTH INNING</TE>
<TE>   GIANTS: Giants 4, Angels 3--Jose Molina catching. Shawn Wooten at
first. Snow flied to left. Bell struck out swinging. Tom Goodwin,
batting for Shinjo, grounded to short. No runs, no hits.</TE>
<TE>   ANGELS: Giants 4, Angels 3--Robb Nen pitching. Kennedy flied to
right. Every Angel is still trying to hit a homer on every pitch.
Eckstein struck out swinging. They finally showed the kid in the
monkey suit, but only for a second. His agent will be mad. Erstad
flied to center. No runs, no hits, no win.</TE>

<HD>More Power to Giants</HD>
<DH>They hit three home runs to overcome two solo shots by
Glaus in opener</DH>

<LD>If the Angels win the World Series, they ought to nudge the rally
monkey aside and adopt Alfred E. Neuman as their mascot.</LD>
<LD>   The "What Me Worry?" Angels did it again Saturday, reprising their
unintentional but highly effective strategy for success this year.
They lost the season opener, then made the playoffs. They lost the
first game of the division series, then won the series. They lost the
first game of the American League championship series, then won the
series.</LD>
<LD>   And they lost the first game of the World Series on Saturday, 4-3
to the San Francisco Giants. The Giants won a home run derby, against
a team poorly equipped to compete in one.</LD>
<TE>   Troy Glaus homered twice for the Angels, both solo shots, becoming
the sixth player to homer twice in his first World Series game. The
Giants trumped that with solo shots from Barry Bonds and Reggie
Sanders and a two-run blast from J.T. Snow.</TE>
<TE>   And so again, this time in their last series of the season, the
Angels trail a series, one game to none.</TE>
<TE>   "We've been here before," Angel designated hitter Brad Fullmer
said. "I don't think anyone's going to panic."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, this was the playoff opener at Yankee Stadium all over
again: Glaus hits two homers, ace Jarrod Washburn gives up three,
Angels outhit the other guys and lose.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels are 0-3 in playoff openers this fall, 7-0 in all other
playoff games.</TE>
<TE>   However, this series is the first in which the Angels hold
home-field advantage and this was their first loss at home in the
postseason. They must win tonight or wade into Pacific Bell Park with
the Giants in a commanding position.</TE>
<TE>   "We've played well on the road, and we've played well at home,"
center fielder Darin Erstad said. "So I don't buy into that stuff."</TE>
<TE>   Said right fielder Tim Salmon: "I don't know, with this club, if
it's that huge of a deal. I don't want to downplay it, and I don't
expect it to be easier to play there, but we've got the kind of club
that usually plays well regardless."</TE>
<TE>   They did not play well Saturday. Bonds did not beat the Angels,
despite over-the-top hype that suggested the Angels were facing the
king and his court.</TE>
<TE>   San Francisco starter Jason Schmidt beat the Angels, throwing as
hard as 98 mph and striking out six in 5 2/3 innings. The San
Francisco bullpen beat the Angels, with Felix Rodriguez, Tim Worrell
and Robb Nen getting the final 10 outs without giving up a hit.</TE>
<TE>   Snow beat his old team, with the home run in the sixth inning that
gave the Giants a cushion they would need, and with a spectacular
catch of a pop foul on which he slipped, fell on his butt, jumped to
his feet and made the catch.</TE>
<TE>   And the Angels beat themselves. In seven at-bats with runners in
scoring position, they had one hit. In a game they lost by one run,
they twice stranded a runner at third base with one out. Erstad
struck out the first time and Salmon fouled out the second time --
that was the ball Snow caught -- on occasions when a hit or even a
fly ball would have scored a run.</TE>
<TE>   However, in Glaus they trust. He tied a major league record with
his sixth home run of the postseason.</TE>
<TE>   "Don't change his meals," Erstad said. "Don't change his sleep."</TE>
<TE>   The Angels pitched to Bonds with honor and with smarts, and with
flashbulbs popping from every direction in the ballpark.</TE>
<TE>   The smartest strategy, of course, is to make sure Bonds does not
bat with runners on base. He never did. Jeff Kent, batting ahead of
Bonds, failed to hit the ball out of the infield in four at-bats.</TE>
<TE>   Washburn retired the Giants in order in the first inning, so Bonds
led off the second. Washburn threw two balls, then a strike, and then
the most feared hitter in the game redirected a really bad pitch
really far over the right-field fence.</TE>
<TE>   "I set up low and away," catcher Bengie Molina said. "We left it
up and in, and he made us pay."</TE>
<TE>   Should the Angels have walked Bonds? Wouldn't have mattered, as it
turned out.</TE>
<TE>   One out later, Sanders homered, and so the Giants would have led
2-0 either way.</TE>
<TE>   Bonds batted again in the fourth inning, and Washburn struck him
out, on a 3-2 fastball, high and inside.</TE>
<TE>   In the sixth, with the Giants up 2-1, Bonds led off and grounded
out to first baseman Scott Spiezio. Benito Santiago struck out, but
Sanders singled and Snow homered, and that was all for Washburn.</TE>
<TE>   The Giants would not score again. In his last at-bat, with one out
and none on in the eighth inning, Bonds walked, on four pitches from
Scott Schoeneweis.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not worried about Barry Bonds that much," Molina said.
"We're more worried about the other guys. We're worried about guys
like Sanders and J.T. Snow and Benito Santiago."</TE>
<TE>   Said second baseman Adam Kennedy: "If we can hold Barry to a solo
home run every game, we'll be OK."</TE>
<TE>   They did, they lost, and they trail the series, one game to none.
To the Angels, they're OK.</TE>
<TE>   (BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX / INFOGRAPHIC)</TE>
<TE>   THE BIG PLAY</TE>
<TE>   J.T. Snow, who has hit nine of his 39 homers against left-handed
pitchers in the last four seasons and has often been benched against
left-handers during his career, hit a two-run homer off Jarrod
Washburn in the sixth to give the Giants a 4-1 lead. Lefties hit .199
with five homers off Washburn this season.</TE>
<TE>   NOT IN BOX SCORE</TE>
<TE>   On Salmon's popup to first in the bottom of the fifth, J.T. Snow
made a fine play. Running over to the stands, he slipped when his
cleats hit a wet spot, falling right on his rear end. Snow kept his
eyes on the ball, got up and made the catch. Not many first basemen
would have made that play. Snow showed why he has won six Gold
Gloves.</TE>
<TE>   THE BIG LETDOWN</TE>
<TE>   The Angels left eight runners on base, five in scoring position.
But the worst offense had to be in the fifth. With runners on first
and third and one out, the Angels, trailing, 2-1, seemed sure to tie
the score. But Tim Salmon popped to first on a great play by J.T.
Snow and Garret Anderson struck out.</TE>
<TE>   DID YOU NOTICE?</TE>
<TE>   Every Angel hitter seemed to think that he had home run power.
Darin Erstad swung hard and struck out twice on balls that were out
of the strike zone. Bengie Molina left three runners in scoring
position during the game because he wanted to be Johnny Bench all of
a sudden. They forgot what got them here: smart hitting.</TE>

<HD>A Wasted Evening</HD>
<DH>Angels rue missed opportunities that loom large in a
one-run defeat.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mike DiGiovanna</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>All Angel right fielder Tim Salmon seemed to see in his first two
at-bats against San Francisco Giant right-hander Jason Schmidt on
Saturday night was fastball away, fastball away, and the results
weren't pretty: A strikeout swinging at a 97-mph heater in the first
inning and a fly-ball out to center in the third.</LD>
<LD>   So when Schmidt came in with a first-pitch fastball over the
middle of the plate with runners on first and third in the fifth
inning, Salmon's eyes "got real big." What happened next made 44,603
in Edison Field want to shield their eyes.</LD>
<LD>   Salmon lifted a high pop-up in foul territory near the San
Francisco dugout, Giant first baseman J.T. Snow sprinted in, slipped
on the rubber-like surface near the screen, fell flat on his back,
bounced back up--no standing eight-count necessary--and made a superb
catch.</LD>
<TE>   "Just my luck, huh?" Salmon said.</TE>
<TE>   It was that kind of night for the Angels, who left runners
stranded like motorists in the break-down lane during a frustrating
4-3 loss to the Giants in Game 1 of the World Series.</TE>
<TE>   An Angel team that hit .290 with runners in scoring position
during the regular season and put together an eight-run inning
against the New York Yankees and a 10-run inning against the
Minnesota Twins in two previous playoff series went hitless in seven
at-bats with runners in scoring position in the first five innings
Saturday night.</TE>
<TE>   An Angel team that struck out the fewest times in the American
League this season struck out nine times Saturday night, losing
despite outhitting the Giants, 9-6.</TE>
<TE>   "We had chances, we had the right guys up there, and we just
didn't do the job, we didn't get it done," Angel batting instructor
Mickey Hatcher said. "Our guys aren't happy. They're going to come
back [ticked] off [tonight]. So watch out."</TE>
<TE>   There was plenty to be angry about Saturday night. After Troy
Glaus homered with one out in the second to trim the Giant lead to
2-1, Brad Fullmer singled and, with two out, stole second. But Bengie
Molina flied to left. End of threat.</TE>
<TE>   Adam Kennedy doubled off the wall in right-center field to open
the third inning and took third on a masterful at-bat by David
Eckstein, who, after failing to lay down a sacrifice bunt, fisted a
97-mph,1-and-2 fastball on the ground to second base.</TE>
<TE>   Schmidt, whose fastball was clocked between 95 and 99 mph, blew a
high 97-mph pitch past Darin Erstad for strike three, and Salmon
flied to center to end the inning.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels threatened again in the fourth when Garret Anderson led
off with a single. Two outs later, Scott Spiezio worked a 2-and-2
count against Schmidt, presenting aggressive-minded Manager Mike
Scioscia with a situation in which he has usually sent the runner.</TE>
<TE>   But Anderson, Scioscia revealed afterward, has been suffering from
a tight hamstring, and Scioscia didn't send him. Spiezio laced a
double down the right-field line, but Anderson had to hold at third.
Molina grounded out to third to end the inning.</TE>
<TE>   Then came the fifth, which included the at-bat that Salmon
replayed in his mind a few times Saturday night. With one out,
Eckstein reached on a single, and Erstad lined a hit-and-run single
to center, moving Eckstein to third.</TE>
<TE>   Salmon admitted he was a little keyed up in his first-ever World
Series game--"It was real easy to get excited in this kind of
atmosphere," he said--but high anxiety wasn't a factor in him
swinging at Schmidt's first pitch.</TE>
<TE>   "All year long I've been aggressive early in the count," he said.
"I was ready for a pitch I could handle, that I could put in play
hard. It was a good swing, I was just a little under it.... Just a
click off. He gave me a pitch to hit, and in most circumstances,
you'd think I could put the ball in play."</TE>

<HD>Team's Loss Dwarfs Glaus' Personal Success</HD>
<DH>Angel third baseman knows that hitting two home runs in his
first World Series game is special, but says 'right now we're trying
to win ballgames.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Helene Elliott</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Troy Glaus' expression never changed, not when he was asked about the
joy of hitting two home runs in his first World Series game, and not
when he was asked about the disappointment of the Angels' 4-3 loss to
the San Francisco Giants Saturday at Edison Field.</LD>
<LD>   Happiness and pride were set aside. The idea is to win, and the
Angels, for the third consecutive postseason series, lost their
opener. As Glaus sees it, nothing else meant much, not his second
two-home run game in postseason play or any of the historical
footnotes that went with it, such as tying five other players for the
most home runs in one postseason (six), or joining five other players
who hit two homers in their World Series debuts.</LD>
<LD>   "It doesn't really matter," he said of his exploits. "We didn't
win tonight. This team has been about winning all year, and we came
out on the losing end. We just have to forget it and move on."</LD>
<TE>   Glaus rarely displays emotion, and he stayed in character after he
hit his first home run, an 0-2 blast into the Angels' bullpen in left
field in the second inning that made him merely the 27th player to
homer in his first World Series at-bat.</TE>
<TE>   And after the game, after he emerged from the trainer's room and
his ritual of icing his right shoulder, he told a throng of reporters
gathered around his locker that he didn't feel any great surge of
sentiment after his feat.</TE>
<TE>   "I felt like we were down, 2-1, and we've got to play the game,"
said Glaus. "That was an at-bat. I happened to hit a home run."</TE>
<TE>   He happened to hit another, leading off the sixth inning. This
time, he powered a 1-0 pitch to left, the 44th time a player has had
a multi-homer game in the World Series and the second time a player
has had two multi-homer games in one postseason. In that regard,
Glaus, who also hit two homers in the opener of the Angels' American
League division series against the New York Yankees, joined Willie
Aikens, who had multi-homer games in the first and fourth games of
the 1980 World Series.</TE>
<TE>   Glaus' homer cut the Giants' lead to 4-2, and the Angels
manufactured another run in the inning. However, despite the support
of a loud and loyal crowd of 44,603 and the presence of the rally
monkey on the right-field scoreboard, they couldn't generate the
rally magic they showed against the Yankees and again in the American
League championship series against the Minnesota Twins.</TE>
<TE>   "It's special, obviously, but right now we're trying to win
ballgames," said Glaus, whose homers have been hit with the bases
empty. "We got it back to a 2-1 game and one more swing from somebody
else, and it's tied.... We just came up a little short."</TE>
<TE>   For that, he was quick to commend Giant starter Jason Schmidt and
the San Francisco bullpen.</TE>
<TE>   "Jason's got great stuff," said Glaus, who took a called third
strike in his final at-bat, against Tim Worrell, in the eighth. "He's
got an electric fastball, great change and good slider. He made a
couple of mistakes. Unfortunately, we just didn't get enough....</TE>
<TE>   "They're a great team. They're well-balanced. They pitch well, hit
well and play good defense. You don't get to the World Series lacking
one or the other."</TE>
<TE>   Glaus said he was a bit nervous when he awoke Saturday, mostly
because he was antsy to get back on the field after the Angels'
pennant-clinching victory over the Twins last Sunday. Once the game
began, however, he said his jitters faded.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the same game we've been playing since we were kids. The
only thing that's different is all this," he said, gesturing toward
the reporters standing around him.</TE>
<TE>   If there's one thing he hopes won't be different, it's the Angels'
resilience. They lost their first game against the Yankees at New
York but won the next three; they lost the AL championship series
opener at Minnesota, but came back to win the next four and clinch
their first AL pennant.</TE>
<TE>   "This time, we were trying to change it up," he said, in what
passes as a joke from him. "If we can take anything, it's that we've
come back before.... It's about winning. It's all about the 'W.'
We've just got to go out and give 100% [today]."</TE>

<HD>Cowboy Justice</HD>
<DH>Those who knew Angel owner Gene Autry say despite his film
and singing success, these days might have been his happiest</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>David Wharton</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If Gene Autry were alive to see this day, he might shower and shave
and read the newspaper over breakfast, just like any other day.</LD>
<LD>   With his Anaheim Angels playing in their first World Series, he
and his wife Jackie might leave home in time to stop by the clubhouse
and chat with the players, just as they would for any other game.
From there, they would go to the owner's box, where he would sit with
a customary scorecard in hand.</LD>
<LD>   "He would be very calm," Jackie said. "If someone hit a home run,
he might stand up and applaud. He never screamed and yelled."</LD>
<TE>   But deep inside, behind that poker face, might be a different
story.</TE>
<TE>   The man they called "the Cowboy" spent almost four decades hoping
to see his team play for the championship. He suffered through losing
seasons. Even worse, he suffered through playoffs when the Angels
came one game, one out, one strike, away from the Series.</TE>
<TE>   For all the renown Autry enjoyed as an actor and singer, all the
millions he made before his death four years ago, people who knew him
suspect that -- even with the Angels down a game to the San Francisco
Giants -- he might never have been happier.</TE>
<TE>   "This was his ultimate goal," said Bobby Knoop, a former second
baseman and coach for the Angels. "You just got the feeling he wanted
it so badly."</TE>
<TE>   The original singing cowboy, the one with the 10-gallon hat and a
smile as broad as Texas, loved baseball since the days when he played
it well enough to be offered a tryout by the St. Louis Cardinals.
Though he chose another career -- Will Rogers discovered him plucking
a guitar at his night job as a telegraph operator -- Autry never
strayed far from the game.</TE>
<TE>   Performing on a Tulsa radio show in the late 1920s, he befriended
Dizzy Dean and other players who came through town for Texas League
games. Later, while in Chicago to record albums, Autry frequented
Wrigley Field.</TE>
<TE>   His true involvement began near the end of a career that spanned
about 94 films and more than 600 recordings. In 1952, Autry purchased
the radio station that carried Dodger games and, when he lost that
contract, sought the broadcast rights to an expansion club the
American League wanted to put in Southern California.</TE>
<TE>   By 1961, almost by accident, he was co-owner of the new franchise.</TE>
<TE>   It was paradise for a baseball fan, recalled Johnny Grant, who met
Autry in the Army Air Corps during World War II and later worked for
his radio and television stations. At Lakeside Country Club, Autry
traded barbs with Bob Hope, a part-owner of the Cleveland Indians. At
a house Grant shared with several Angel players, Autry often stayed
until the wee hours talking baseball.</TE>
<TE>   "Gene was one of the biggest stars around, but he was like a kid
when we would go out and have a meal with Stan Musial or Red
Schoendienst," said Grant, who later became honorary mayor of
Hollywood. "He loved it when Roger Maris and Mickey Mantle came
through town."</TE>
<TE>   The admiration was often mutual because, as former manager Gene
Mauch said, a lot of players "thought he was a god." Knoop collected
his records, an autographed baseball, even a pair of his old boots
emblazoned with a flying "A."</TE>
<TE>   When minor league clubs needed a celebrity to raise money, they
asked Autry.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd drive him up to Bakersfield or San Jose," Grant said. "He'd
sit in the passenger seat the whole way reading the newspaper, from
cover to back, even the want ads. When we got to the banquet, he'd
get up and tell a few jokes. He would do anything to support the
game."</TE>
<TE>   On one such trip, police kept stopping them even though Grant was
watching his speed. The third time, an officer explained why. "They
were radioing ahead, saying Gene Autry's in that car," Grant
recalled.</TE>
<TE>   Outfielder Tim Salmon, born long after Autry's heyday, learned of
this fame when he was searching through his grandmother's house and
found a stack of Gene Autry comic books that had belonged to his
father. Salmon brought his dad and the comics to the ballpark.</TE>
<TE>   "My dad was like a kid," Salmon said. "Here he was excited about
me playing in the big leagues, but the biggest thing was that,
through his son, he got to meet his childhood hero. For me, it was
really finding out who Mr. Autry was through my father."</TE>
<TE>   Even players who knew little of the singing cowboy became enamored
of the owner who spent spring training with the team and threw lavish
barbecues behind his Palm Springs hotel. They always asked him to
sing his hits, "Back in the Saddle" and "Here Comes Santa Claus."</TE>
<TE>   Once the season began, Autry stopped by the clubhouse before and
after games.</TE>
<TE>   "Mr. Autry loved his players and he loved to sit and talk," Knoop
said. "He might talk about the game, especially if we won. If we
lost, he'd find something else to talk about. 'How was your day?'
'Was everything else all right?' He was never, ever negative."</TE>
<TE>   There were reasons to be discouraged. As Autry said years later:
"In the movies, I never lost a fight. In baseball, I hardly ever won
one."</TE>
<TE>   The Angels tried to keep pace with their successful neighbors to
the north, the Dodgers, by trading away young prospects for big
names. Rod Carew, Reggie Jackson, Frank Robinson and Nolan Ryan
passed through Anaheim but none produced a pennant.</TE>
<TE>   Even when the Angels reached the playoffs in 1979, '82 and '86 --
Mauch recalled seeing "happiness all over Gene's face" -- they found
ways to slip before taking the final step to the Series.</TE>
<TE>   The team was said to be jinxed, losing key players to injury or
accident or worse, always losing in the end. Grant, who spent many
nights with Autry in the owner's box, said: "I think he was hurting
through the smiles, I really do. But he kept smiling."</TE>
<TE>   And he never meddled. "I have wondered often why a manager did
this or that, but I have always tried to restrain my
second-guessing," Autry once said. "I have never ordered a manager to
play a certain player, and I have never called a manager at 3 in the
morning to ask why he didn't play the infield back with one out."</TE>
<TE>   Some wonder if Autry wasn't too nice, too understanding, the
antithesis of New York Yankee owner George Steinbrenner. As the years
passed, his club's desire to succeed approached desperation, loyal
management and players adopting the credo, "Win one for the Cowboy."</TE>
<TE>   "To my knowledge, Gene never once said, 'Look, guys, I'm not going
to be around much longer, we've got to get it done this year,' "
Jackie said. "Gene wanted to win for the fans and the people who
worked for him in the organization, but as he aged and his health
began to fail, there were times I got a sense of urgency and even
panic from our baseball people that if we don't do it this year, he
may not be around next year.</TE>
<TE>   "We simply mortgaged the future at times," she said. "We could
probably staff two major league teams with the kids we lost from our
farm system."</TE>
<TE>   Autry was 91 when he died in 1998. His team had just finished
three games out of first place but, as always, there was hope. "He
knew some of these young men like Tim Salmon and Troy Percival, and
he knew they would get it done some day," Jackie said.</TE>
<TE>   Dick Clark, a longtime friend, tries to explain why the club meant
so much to Autry.</TE>
<TE>   "He had accomplished everything else he needed to accomplish," the
former "American Bandstand" host said. "He owned everything he needed
to own and he was happily married. So that team was his life ... his
baby."</TE>
<TE>   If Autry could look around Edison Field this weekend, he would see
the number 26 displayed beyond the left-field bullpen, signifying his
place as the extra man on the roster. He would see his smile flashed
across the scoreboard and, no doubt, fans still waving signs that
read "Win one for the Cowboy."</TE>
<TE>   "Every team has its star," said Dean Chance, a former Angel
pitcher. "The Yankees have Babe Ruth. The Angels, their star is Gene
Autry, the owner."</TE>
<TE>   The fuss would please Autry, friends say, but he would not crow
about it. He would sit in his box and quietly keep score. "And if he
had to go to the restroom, he would hand you the scorecard and you'd
better make sure you got it right," Grant said.</TE>
<TE>   At some point, a team official would call to inform him of the
attendance before it was shown on the scoreboard. If one of his
players hit a home run, he might clap.</TE>
<TE>   "Outwardly," Jackie said, "he would look the same."</TE>
<TE>   But inside, that might be a different story. These days, the
Cowboy's team is in the World Series.</TE>
<TE>   These days, his widow said, "he may have been jumping around on
the inside."</TE>

<LD>Right-hander Dean Chance was an Angel for the team's first six
seasons, then pitched five more seasons with the Twins, Indians, Mets
and Tigers. His finest year was 1964 when, at age 23, he won the Cy
Young Award by going 20-9 with a 1.65 earned-run average, 11 shutouts
and 15 complete games. He was also a 20-game winner with Minnesota in
1967. His career record was 128-115. Chance, now a boxing promoter,
is guest analyst for The Times in this World Series.</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<LD>   I remember back in the mid-'90s, I spent a spring working with the
Angels. And one of the guys who stuck in my mind was J.T. Snow. I
thought he was just phenomenal at first base.</LD>
<TE>   And that defensive ability may have been the difference Saturday
night.</TE>
<TE>   I think that play where he slid in foul territory, got up and
still caught the ball was the key play of the game. I don't know
many, if any, other players who could slip like that and get up and
still make that play.</TE>
<TE>   That could make him the best defensive first baseman I have ever
seen.</TE>
<TE>   As far as the Giants' runs are concerned, those home runs that
Jarrod Washburn gave up came on high fastballs. The one Barry Bonds
hit wasn't cheap. But when you throw those high fastballs, the
risers, you've got to come inside. I think it's better if you keep it
down, but if you come up you've got to stay inside.</TE>
<TE>   I remember I got Reggie Jackson once by getting two strikes on him
and then throwing the high fastball. With two strikes, they can't lay
off it.</TE>
<TE>   But the Angels came back with two Troy Glaus home runs and both of
those were on fastballs. So they showed they'll be able to get their
share of home runs in this series.</TE>
<TE>   Ultimately, this game came down to the closer, Robb Nen. But I'll
tell you something, I wouldn't trade him for [Troy] Percival. Nen may
have a better slider, but Percival has the better fastball.</TE>
<TE>   Overall, I really like this Angel club. I like the way Mike
Scioscia uses the hit and run, the way he keeps them aggressive.</TE>
<TE>   And most of all, I love their heart. They came back Saturday and
lost by only one run. And they'll be back today. All you can do is
forget about the last game and move on.</TE>
<TE>   I'm predicting the Angels will win this series, but I think it
will go seven games.</TE>
<TE>   To me, the most touching moment was when Jackie Autry threw out
the first pitch. I couldn't help but think of the Cowboy, Gene Autry.
When you mention the Yankees, you think of all those stars from Babe
Ruth and Lou Gehrig on down. But when you think of the Angels, you
think of only one guy, Gene Autry. He was the star. Then, you had
your ballplayers.</TE>
<TE>   The rest of us only shared a little of our careers with the
Angels, but I'll tell you this, anybody who ever played for Gene
Autry has a special place in his heart for the Cowboy.</TE>

<KH>GIANT NOTES</KH>
<HD>Magowan Stays Noncommittal About Baker</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jason Reid and HELENE ELLIOTT</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>General Manager Brian Sabean and Manager Dusty Baker, whose contracts
expire after the World Series, will soon know whether they will
remain with the San Francisco Giants, the club's owner said Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   Peter Magowan, managing general partner, said a decision on
Sabean, who is expected to return, could come "a day or two" after
the Giants' final game, and that the managerial situation would be
resolved "within a week."</LD>
<LD>   Does that mean Magowan has someone on deck to replace the
three-time manager of the year, reportedly among the leading
candidates for openings with the Seattle Mariners, New York Mets and
Chicago Cubs?</LD>
<TE>   "I'm not talking about that," said Magowan, surrounded by a throng
of reporters in the visiting dugout at Edison Field before Game 1. "I
just think we'll know. I think we'll know who it's going to be."</TE>
<TE>   Does Magowan want Baker to return?</TE>
<TE>   "I don't want to say," he said. "If I say it, it interferes with
the general manager's responsibility and authority on doing what he
wants to do. If I say, 'I think he's the greatest manager in baseball
and I absolutely want him to be here,' then [how can I] tell the
general manager, 'Whoever you have as your manager is going to be OK
with me?' How's he going to take that when I, as his boss, have gone
out and said that?"</TE>
<TE>   Magowan did praise Baker for leading the Giants to the National
League pennant.</TE>
<TE>   "We've played well in the postseason, we had not done that in the
previous nine years, so that's definitely a positive development,"
said Magowan, who hired Baker. "He's gotten the job done. He's
managed beautifully in the playoffs. I honestly think he outmanaged
two of the best managers in baseball in Bobby Cox and Tony La Russa.
And we won."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Magowan fondly remembers when the World Series wasn't exclusively
late-night TV.</TE>
<TE>   "As a kid who loved the game of baseball, I would not have been
allowed by my dad, at 9 and 10 years old, to stay up to 11, 12 at
night to watch games, even if it was my favorite team," he said. "At
least not on a school night, so I am very sympathetic. This is a very
difficult problem."</TE>
<TE>   But Fox paid $1.5 billion for postseason rights -- and prime time
is moneymaking time.</TE>
<TE>   "We can wear our purists' hats and we can be advocates for
children who want to watch games," he said, "but there are a lot of
bills that have to be paid."</TE>
<TE>   -- Jason Reid</TE>
<TE>   Baker likes the designated hitter -- but for the American League,
not for his own league.</TE>
<TE>   "It gave an opportunity for a lot of guys that can still play, or
still hit, at least to continue to hit and play," he said. "It gives
an opportunity to give guys days off. There is a place for it, I
think.... But I like our style of baseball over here."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Encino native Russ Ortiz needed two game plans for his start
today: one on how to face the Angels' batters and one for handling
ticket requests from friends and relatives.</TE>
<TE>   The 28-year-old right-hander said he took care of the ticket
request problem early. "I tried to nip it in the bud," he said. "I
asked, before everybody else called me. I asked them, 'Hey, who wants
to come to the game, and I'll get tickets?' So we got that taken care
of in a nice and timely fashion."</TE>
<TE>   As for the Angels, whom he hasn't seen since spring training, that
took more preparation.</TE>
<TE>   "When I look at video and hear the reports, I try to take in as
much information as possible and go about it like I would at the
beginning of the season, just kind of looking at every single little
detail," he said. "As opposed to the [division series and National
League championship series] where I saw the guys, and so I learned
quite a few things from watching our other pitchers throw, or facing
them myself. This time, it's just trying to get every little detail I
can."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Anyone who had bet on Baker knowing the name of the Angels' home
field would have lost. Asked about the baseball memories he
accumulated while growing up in Riverside, he waxed poetic about
Steve Bilko, Albie Pearson, Dean Chance, Bo Belinsky and Bobby Knoop.</TE>
<TE>   "So it's really pretty neat to have grown up watching both sides,"
he said, "and then here I am managing here in Angels Stadium."</TE>
<TE>   He paused when he heard laughter. "Or what is it called now,
Edison Field?"</TE>

<HD>Sanders Is Giants' Gain</HD>
<DH>Right fielder who nearly became an Angel in the off-season
helps San Francisco win Game 1.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jason Reid</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Eleven years in the major leagues has taught Reggie Sanders not to
assume anything, so he phoned Angel General Manager Bill Stoneman to
check the fine print.</LD>
<LD>   Sanders planned to sign with the club last December but wanted to
confirm his role as the everyday right fielder, which he figured he
would be during fast-moving contract negotiations. Talk about
miscommunication.</LD>
<LD>   Tim Salmon has occupied that spot for a decade and wasn't going
anywhere, prompting Sanders to shift gears because becoming a
designated hitter wasn't on his to-do list. The San Francisco Giants
were waiting with just the right offer and continue to be pleased
they closed the deal.</LD>
<TE>   The Giants got a big performance from their right fielder Saturday
night in a 4-3 victory over the Angels in Game 1 of the World Series
at Edison Field.</TE>
<TE>   Sanders did his part to help the Giants zap the excitement from a
noise stick-banging crowd of 44,603, following Barry Bonds' leadoff
homer in the second inning with a one-out solo blast. He also walked
in the fourth and singled with two out in the sixth, scoring on J.T.
Snow's two-run homer that ended a rough night for Angel ace Jarrod
Washburn.</TE>
<TE>   Everything quickly came together for Sanders in Anaheim after a
1-for-16 slump in the National League championship series. So that's
why the Angels were interested.</TE>
<TE>   "I was very close to signing," Sanders said. "I knew Anaheim would
be a great team and the Giants would be a great team. I've always
wanted to be on a team that's contending and trying to win, and it's
just real interesting to see how things work out."</TE>
<TE>   Things didn't work out well for the Angels in Game 1.</TE>
<TE>   They stranded eight runners, failing to get the timely hits that
the Giants did. Sanders was at the forefront of the attack, making
the necessary adjustments after an awful experience as the Giants
defeated St. Louis for the NL pennant.</TE>
<TE>   Several conversations with hitting instructor Gene Clines, and a
lot of extra batting practice, paid off for Sanders in the second
against Washburn. The streaky hitter got a fastball in the right spot
and could finally smile again after homering over the right-field
scoreboard.</TE>
<TE>   "I got position ready," he said. "I was in position to hit the
ball a lot sooner. Before, I was caught behind. Now, I'm in good
position to hit the ball out front and I know what I have to do.</TE>
<TE>   "It's just a matter of not getting too low during the lows or too
high on the highs. You have to stay as even as you can and believe
that it's going to turn around."</TE>
<TE>   The Giants were especially happy Sanders had a good vibe at the
plate because he's one of the most respected players in the
clubhouse. A member of the Arizona Diamondbacks' World Series
championship team last season, Sanders has contributed to the Giants'
success despite batting .189 in the postseason.</TE>
<TE>   "This team knows it can count on Reggie," catcher Benito Santiago
said. "Everybody knows what he can do. Yeah, he's been kind of
struggling in the postseason, but he came up big. If he does that
again [tonight] nobody is going to [remember] what he did last week."</TE>
<TE>   It's good that Sanders has a short memory, the Giants said.</TE>
<TE>   "Reggie is one of those players who doesn't let too much bother
him one way or another," reserve outfielder Tom Goodwin said. "It's
not like he's going to come in and panic and make a whole bunch of
changes. He knows what kind of swing he has and the adjustments he
has to make. Anybody would be happy to have a Reggie Sanders on their
team."</TE>

<HD>Snow Slipped in Angels' Eyes, but Delivers</HD>

<AU>Ross Newhan</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It was the fifth inning of Game 1 of the World Series, and the first
baseman of the San Francisco Giants was flat on his back.</LD>
<LD>   How embarrassing. How inelegant.</LD>
<LD>   It happened while pursing a foul popup hit by Tim Salmon that J.T.
Snow lost his footing on the synthetic warning track and virtually
skidded into the laps of ringside fans in the dugout boxes.</LD>
<TE>   Of course, you don't win six consecutive Gold Gloves for no
reason.</TE>
<TE>   While many first basemen might have remained prone, administering
to their wounded pride long enough for the blush to fade from their
cheeks, Snow would use the netting in front of the boxes to pull
himself up and make a remarkable catch, registering the second out of
an inning in which Garret Anderson's ensuing strikeout left two
runners stranded.</TE>
<TE>   In the aftermath of a 4-3 San Francisco victory over the Angels,
Snow would blast the synthetic track as being "dangerously below
major league standards," but his more important blast, in the context
of the series opener, had come in the sixth inning when he ripped a
two-run homer off Jarrod Washburn.</TE>
<TE>   Snow's second postseason homer, coming against the team that had
basically dumped him in a lamentable 1996 trade for pitcher Allen
Watson because of upper management's view that he was too soft, and
coming in the ballpark that was only a short drive from his boyhood
home in Seal Beach, extended the Giants' lead to 4-1, proved to be
decisive and prompted Snow to pump his right arm as he rounded first
and watched the ball clear the fence in left-center.</TE>
<TE>   He would later attribute that show of emotion to adrenaline,
insisting he wasn't sending a message to former Angel president Tony
Tavares, who didn't think of Snow so much as a boy of summer but one
of several players on the '96 team "who looked like they came from
Newport Beach, where their mommies and daddies gave them everything
they wanted."</TE>
<TE>   Sweet payback?</TE>
<TE>   Not really, Snow said.</TE>
<TE>   "You always want to beat the team you once played for," he said,
"but this is pretty much a new place, a new stadium, new [Angel]
uniforms. I think there's maybe only four or five players and one
coach still there.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't have a rally monkey or any rally animal when I was
here. I mean, it felt good, but we're just trying to take one game at
a time in the postseason, and it seems like every night or every game
it's a different guy coming through big, and that's the sign of a
good team."</TE>
<TE>   For Snow, coming off his poorest offensive season (.246 average,
six home runs and 53 runs batted in), a season in which he lost his
job for a prolonged period to Damon Minor, the postseason truly
personifies the cliche of a new season and a shot at redemption.</TE>
<TE>   He was ahead of Washburn, 3 and 1, and got the fastball he
anticipated.</TE>
<TE>   "I was just trying to stay inside the ball and drive it to
left-center because I kept fouling balls off my second at-bat," he
said. "I like the way Washburn pitches. He throws his fastball and
challenges you the way Jason Schmidt [who went 5 2/3 innings and
gained the victory for the Giants] does for our team. I mean, it
makes for two guys who are proud of their fastball and challenge you
with it the way the game used to be played, not backing down from
anybody. You like to play games like that."</TE>
<TE>   Snow may love getting fastballs on a 3-and-1 count, but he didn't
appreciate ending up on his back in the fifth inning, forced to make
a catch of a type that he had never previously made in his gold-laden
career and hopes never to have to make again.</TE>
<TE>   "I was pretty upset," he said. "I'm surprised Major League
Baseball hasn't done something about that track. I'd hate to see
somebody get hurt and miss the rest of the World Series. One of their
players told me it's happened a lot to other guys, so it's not as if
it's something new."</TE>
<TE>   Snow said he was fortunate to fall on his back so that he could
keep his eye on the ball.</TE>
<TE>   "I called [catcher Benito Santiago] off right when it went up," he
said. "I just tried to stay with it because you can't call a guy off
then expect him to pick you up.</TE>
<TE>   "I called it the whole way, even when I was laying down. Luckily
the net was there and I was able to grab onto it and pull myself up."</TE>
<TE>   Manager Dusty Baker said it reminded him of a catch Roberto
Clemente had made in Dodger Stadium when he slipped pursuing a fly
ball in right field, flipped his sunglasses down, and made the catch
on his back. It also reminded him of a catch he had made in Clemente
fashion when he slipped chasing a Clemente fly with the bases loaded
in Pittsburgh.</TE>
<TE>   "I couldn't believe it and he couldn't believe it," Baker said.
"If I hadn't seen him do it first, I wouldn't have had the presence
of mind to just stay on my back and do the same thing."</TE>
<TE>   Edison Field is far different from the Anaheim Stadium in which
Snow played with the Angels, the Anaheim Stadium he came to as an
Angel fan while attending Los Alamitos High, buying the cheapest
seats, he recalled, and sneaking down to the box seats while trying
to avoid security.</TE>
<TE>   Snow now lives in San Mateo and said he didn't really have too
many old friends or family members among the crowd of 44,603.</TE>
<TE>   "The last thing you want to do is play ticket broker in the World
Series," he said.</TE>
<TE>   His sixth-inning homer on Washburn's 106th pitch chased the
starter and put the rally monkey in the lineup. Asked if he feared
the monkey, Snow said that it might be great for the fans and the
Angels, "but I've yet to see him get a hit or throw a strike or get
somebody out. As long as you keep your attention on what's going on
in the field, that's all that matters."</TE>
<TE>   In the Series opener, Snow kept his eyes on the ball in more ways
than one.</TE>

<LD>The first fastball didn't come from the pitcher.</LD>
<LD>   The first fastball came from the pitching coach.</LD>
<LD>   Before Saturday's World Series opener, Barry Bonds was approached
in the batting cage by Bud Black.</LD>
<TE>   "You're going to get some pitches to hit," Black told him.</TE>
<TE>   The words flashed in front of Bonds like a red cape.</TE>
<TE>   The message squirted him in the eyes like a lapel flower.</TE>
<TE>   So you're going to get some pitches to hit, huh Barry?</TE>
<TE>   "And I got one," said Bonds later, his mouth still watering.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, in their first battle with the San Francisco Giants, the
Angels lived up to their promise to challenge arguably the greatest
power hitter ever.</TE>
<TE>   Like a fly challenges a windshield.</TE>
<TE>   Like an ant challenges a foot.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels were good sportsmen, hearty fellows, manly men.</TE>
<TE>   And big fat losers after Bonds' second-inning homer on his fourth
World Series pitch set the tone for the Giants' 4-3 victory at Edison
Field.</TE>
<TE>   "Doesn't matter if it's in the World Series or Little League or
whatever you guys want to call it," Giant catcher Benito Santiago
with a shrug. "Barry Bonds is Barry Bonds. And if you make a mistake,
he will make you pay."</TE>
<TE>   But the mistake wasn't in Washburn's fastball that Bonds launched
into the old right-field bullpen.</TE>
<TE>   The mistake was in the approach that Washburn was going to try and
beat him with that fastball.</TE>
<TE>   Tried to beat him four straight times on that first at-bat.</TE>
<TE>   Tried once too many.</TE>
<TE>   You know, Superman's cape and all that.</TE>
<TE>   Second inning, scoreless tie, Bonds stepped to the plate amid boos
and flashbulbs and Washburn's bearded glare.</TE>
<TE>   "I said all week, hopefully he would come up with nobody on base
so I could pitch to him, and here it was," Washburn said.</TE>
<TE>   First pitch, 88-mph fastball outside, ball one.</TE>
<TE>   Second pitch, 88-mph fastball outside, ball two.</TE>
<TE>   Third pitch, 89-mph fastball, Bonds swings and misses, strike one.</TE>
<TE>   Fourth pitch, Bengie Molina sets up outside, Washburn throws
another fastball, good 90-mph velocity, but leaves it out across the
plate.</TE>
<TE>   Gone.</TE>
<TE>   The ball was hit so hard, everyone in the stadium stopped and
stared, including Bonds.</TE>
<TE>   The ball was hit so smoothly, Molina didn't even hear it hit the
bat.</TE>
<TE>   "That's the amazing thing," Molina said. "I heard nothing."</TE>
<TE>   The ball was hit so far, it landed in the old bullpen area
alongside the right-field bleachers, nearly nailing the giant
Memorial Care Medical Centers sign, about 418 feet way.</TE>
<TE>   The hit felt so historic, Washburn could only smile.</TE>
<TE>   "I made a mistake, he made me pay," Washburn said. "He's hit more
than 600 home runs, I'm not the first guy to give one up to him. What
can you say?"</TE>
<TE>   I don't know.</TE>
<TE>   How about, "Uncle?"</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, Washburn struck him out on his next at-bat, but it was on
a high pitch that would have been ball four.</TE>
<TE>   And, indeed, Bonds grounded out in the sixth inning, but it was on
a shot that took a bad hop and nearly skulled first baseman Scott
Spiezio.</TE>
<TE>   Scott Schoeneweis must have been watching closely before he was
brought into the game in the eighth inning for the specific purpose
of pitching to Bonds.</TE>
<TE>   He threw four balls that weren't even close, walking him.</TE>
<TE>   "He wasn't trying to walk him," Molina said. "He just couldn't
find the plate."</TE>
<TE>   Well, he should have been trying to walk him.</TE>
<TE>   Officially, Saturday, Bonds only made the Angels pay once.</TE>
<TE>   But the Giants could reap dividends for the entire series.</TE>
<TE>   Bonds' homer gave the Giants a lead they never lost in a game
which many figured the Angels needed to win. They must now rely on
the hair-pulling pitching of Kevin Appier tonight to avoid a home
sweep.</TE>
<TE>   Bonds' homer also settled down the Giants quicker than the Angels,
who struggled with uncharacteristic jitters during the early innings,
stranding five runners in scoring position in the first five innings.</TE>
<TE>   "It brought our tension down a little bit, yeah," Bonds said of
his homer.</TE>
<TE>   If it lifted blood pressures in the other dugout, you would never
know it.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels continued to maintain afterward that this is the way
you must pitch Bonds, and whatever happens, happens.</TE>
<TE>   This space continues to maintain that it could be a series-costing
mistake.</TE>
<TE>   "You have got to be aggressive with him," Black said. "That
aggression that cost us in the second inning, it led to the punchout
his next time up."</TE>
<TE>   The only time they weren't aggressive with Bonds was before the
game, when the Molina brothers approached him in left field during
the Giants' batting practice.</TE>
<TE>   Obviously ignoring the long-ignored rules against pregame
fraternization, the Molinas spent 10 minutes talking with Bonds while
the Giants took batting practice around him.</TE>
<TE>   "I played with him on an all-star team in Japan, but I was worried
he wouldn't remember me, so I was a little timid," Molina said. "But
he was a lot nicer than I thought."</TE>
<TE>   A little timid. Not a bad idea. The Angels, who lost by fighting
with their heart instead of their head, should try it more often.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>So the Angels lost the first game of the World Series.</LD>
<LD>   Big deal.</LD>
<LD>   So the Angels lost, 4-3, to the Giants and left men at third base
three times, twice with fewer than two outs, which would seem to be
terribly disheartening, awfully discouraging, horribly draining</LD>
<TE>   But it's not.</TE>
<TE>   This is how they do it, these Angels. This is how they play their
game. They give you something, sure.</TE>
<TE>   They gave the Yankees a win in Game 1 of the American League
division series. Remember that? How Troy Glaus homered twice (just
like Saturday night) and the Angels went ahead late at Yankee Stadium
until Brendan Donnelly gave up the Bernie Williams home run? Remember
how distraught the Angels were, how they were left for dead, just a
happy little band of Yankee road kill? They were so psychically mind
boggled that they swept the next three games.</TE>
<TE>   And the way Joe Mays and all his off-speed, off-kilter, off-center
stuff twisted the Angels all up in Game 1 of the American League
championship series. Remember that? Remember how they lost 2-1, left
men on base, had lots of terrible at-bats, lunged at pitches, were
impatient, not smart, confoundingly frazzled and got very frustrated?
They were taken out of their game so much that the Angels came back
to win the next four games against the Twins.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels give you something, then they come back and take
everything from you. They give you a game, they take a series. They
give you hope, they take your hearts.</TE>
<TE>   They gave away the first month of the season, 6-14 at the start,
worst ever for a franchise filled with worsts. So why would anyone
think the Angels would be different in the World Series?</TE>
<TE>   "I thought we did a lot of good things tonight," Angel Manager
Mike Scioscia said. "I thought we were aggressive and did some
things, made some plays. Just not enough, but I'm not in any way
discouraged."</TE>
<TE>   It is the way Scott Spiezio battled hard, came from an 0-2 count
down to ease a walk off of Tim Worrell in the bottom of the eighth
inning when there were two outs already so that he could become the
tying run. And the way Orlando Palmeiro, pinch-hitting, worked the
count to 3-2 before he popped out to the third baseman. On this night
Spiezio didn't score. Palmeiro didn't get the walk or the single. On
another it will be different.</TE>
<TE>   These Angels keep plugging away. They will put pressure on Russ
Ortiz today. They will look over pitches, as if sifting through sand
for gold, as if prying open oysters and searching for pearls. They
will put men on base again and will keep trying to get them home.</TE>
<TE>   Tim Salmon will maybe not pop out, foul, on a first pitch, first
swing, just after David Eckstein had singled and Darin Erstad had
singled Eckstein to third. Salmon will not be shy about swinging
again, but he'll be better.</TE>
<TE>   Kevin Appier will probably make a mistake or two. He'll give up
some runs, two or three. Barry Bonds might hit another home run on a
mistake. But Angel pitchers probably won't give up three home runs in
Game 2.</TE>
<TE>   "We've been able to come back all year," hitting coach Mickey
Hatcher said. "I'm really not worried." He was speaking specifically
about the batters who left all those runners stranded but his words
are true of the Angels, all of them.</TE>
<TE>   There will be second-guessing today. Did Scioscia leave Jarrod
Washburn in one batter too long? Wasn't Washburn struggling in the
sixth after he had gotten two outs but had also thrown moe than 100
pitches and had given up a hard single Reggie Sanders and had gone
3-0 on J.T. Snow, then 3-1, then home run?</TE>
<TE>   But Washburn is Scioscia's guy, the ace, the tough competitor and
Scioscia trusts his players and he trusted Washburn to get that final
out in the sixth inning. He didn't do it this time. He will the next
time. The way that Washburn shrugged his shoulders and smiled when
Bonds homered in his first World Series at-bat?</TE>
<TE>   That shrug, that smile, that's the Angels. They lose, they shrug,
they smile, they win the next one and the next and the next.</TE>
<TE>   A loss, blown chances? So what?</TE>
<TE>   "It's not that we want to lose the first game," Eckstein said.
"But it's not as if we're worried about it. I'm not really
concerned."</TE>
<TE>   "We lost," Spiezio said. "It was a close game, same as the other
two game ones. It was close and exciting, same as the others, and we
lost. We've battled in every one of these first games. And we lost.
What's the same? We won the next one."</TE>
<TE>   Down the line it went.</TE>
<TE>   Missed chances, hate that. Next game, we'll win that. Salmon said
it, Washburn said it, Erstad said it, Glaus said it, Bud Black said
it, Scioscia said it, Bengie Molina said it.</TE>
<TE>   It's as if these Angels need to punish themselves a little, need
to blow some chances, waste some swings, throw some bad pitches, put
Angeldom to thinking about how this is it, the time when everything
falls apart, now it's happening, this is the loss that can't be
overcome, this is the game that is the beginning of the end.</TE>
<TE>   "One loss? We'll get over it," Washburn said. He shrugged. He
smiled. He will pitch again. He's sure of it.</TE>

<LD>My World Serious Diary: Game 1.</LD>
<LD>   The very best sportswriters from around the country were sitting
in the main press box at Edison Field for the first game of the World
Series on Saturday, so I was asked to sit in right field with the
others who failed to make the cut.</LD>
<LD>   I took a seat behind a press table next to Times Sports Editor
Bill Dwyre, who ignored the seating chart so he could sit in one of
the spots reserved for "Best Damn Sports Show Period!" It has always
been Dwyre's goal to be on TV, and at this late stage in his life at
least he understands this is as close as he's going to get.</LD>
<TE>   Lisa Guerrero was sitting in the row directly in front of Dwyre,
and when she stood up there was no way Dwyre could see what was
taking place on the field. I thought it admirable on his part he
never complained.</TE>
<TE>   At the end of the first inning, I stood up so Dwyre could get by
me to make his way to the concession stand, knowing his love for hot
dogs and the fact it had been 15 minutes since he had eaten last, but
he didn't budge.</TE>
<TE>   A moment later I understood why. Barry Bonds socked a massive home
run that was headed directly toward our right-field seats.</TE>
<TE>   Now I can't tell you for sure what Dwyre was thinking, but I got
the impression he was positioning himself to jump over the press
table, which would have meant landing on Guerrero, and I guess if you
had the chance to get the first and maybe only World Series home run
ever hit by the guy who might ultimately go down as baseball's
all-time slugger, you might not act your age either.</TE>
<TE>   Bonds' ball, however, dropped out of our sight into the
right-field tunnel -- just shy of the first press row, and so I told
KCAL's Alan Massengale it was safe and he could get out from under
the table.</TE>
<TE>   "That would have been worth at least six figures," Dwyre said, and
if you're not sure what Dwyre looks like, he'll be the only
sportswriter in the right-field press area tonight wearing a
fielder's glove on each hand.</TE>
<TE>   Now I've got to be honest. I was thinking "court case" if Dwyre or
I had gotten the ball, or if Dwyre had fallen on top of Guerrero
without the ball. And so I got to wondering what really happened to
the ball I almost caught?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I WENT to the Edison Field basement while the game was still going
on, learned Bonds' massive homer had cleared the dirt in the
right-field tunnel, hit the cement and bounced hard into the tailgate
of an Anaheim city fire department vehicle.</TE>
<TE>   Major League Baseball announced the ball traveled 418 feet on the
fly. As you know from recent labor negotiations, Major League
Baseball just makes things up that sound good while never really
doing the math, so who knows how far it really went?</TE>
<TE>   After the ball hit the truck's tailgate, it rolled beneath the
vehicle and Anthony Tindall went under to retrieve it.</TE>
<TE>   Now when Bonds hit his 73rd homer, and then again his 600th, the
first guy who touched each ball had lost it after someone else took
it away. But I can honestly say I never thought about trying to take
the ball from Tindall, who is an FBI special agent working here as
part of an L.A. SWAT team, because he didn't look opposed to drawing
his sidearm or tossing one of his diversionary grenades.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, for the safety of fans everywhere, I'd recommend all of
Bonds' homers from now on be caught by armed officers packing
diversionary grenades, which would prevent our courts from being
clogged with "it's my ball; no, it's my ball" silly litigation.</TE>
<TE>   I would, however, not recommend Tindall for the job.</TE>
<TE>   "I ran from it," the tough guy said. "I saw it coming directly to
me and put my hands out to catch it, and then said to myself, 'It's
really cooking,' and ran from it."</TE>
<TE>   Obviously he's got what it takes to play for the Dodgers, but holy
J. Edgar Hoover, I'd have thought a trained FBI agent would've snared
the ball with bare hands.</TE>
<TE>   "I wasn't wearing my bullet-proof vest," he said, while pulling
the ball out from inside his black SWAT team shirt. "If I had it on,
I'd have really gone after it."</TE>
<TE>   The ball, which was stamped with the official 2002 World Series
seal, looked as if it had been beaten up. On one side it had a scuff
mark, and on the other side oil picked up from beneath the truck or
Jarrod Washburn's failed attempt to load up the ball.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a very cool thing," Tindall said, and that's when he was
told by an Anaheim Stadium guard the ball might be taken away from
him by day's end if someone from Major League Baseball insists --
because he hadn't bought a ticket.</TE>
<TE>   Tindall, who said he was donating his time to baseball to be part
of the security detail here, said, "if they ask for it back, they get
it back."</TE>
<TE>   I told him they wanted it back badly, and I'd deliver it for him.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   TINDALL SAID he'd wait to hear from a baseball official, or a
reporter who has been given a seat in the main press box, before
surrendering his prize, "and if I have it only for a few hours," he
said, "it's still a great thrill."</TE>
<TE>   Well, I've got news for Mr. FBI. I spoke to Tim Mead, the Angels'
VP of communications, and he said, if Tindall got the ball, "he keeps
it. And if we see it on Ebay in a few days, God bless him."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   TODAY'S LAST word comes in e-mail from Cameron Schetter:</TE>
<TE>   "On Leno, Salma Hayek mentioned how disappointed she was her
boyfriend didn't give her a Big George rotisserie grill for her
birthday. What were you thinking?"</TE>
<TE>   My wife would find out.</TE>

Fullmer and Russ Ortiz had to endure the nadir of exclusion from the
Southern Section playoffs.</LD>
<LD>   Fullmer, an Angel designated hitter, and Ortiz, a San Francisco
Giant starting pitcher, were teammates at Van Nuys Montclair Prep, a
small private school in the San Fernando Valley that won section
titles in 1990 and '91.</LD>
<LD>   In 1992, Montclair Prep had one of its best teams, with the
slugging Fullmer and the hard-throwing Ortiz leading the way. Ortiz,
a senior bound for Oklahoma, and Fullmer, a junior preparing to
supplant Ortiz as team leader, seemed like strong candidates to guide
the Mounties to a third consecutive championship.</LD>
<TE>   But they never got the chance.</TE>
<TE>   Montclair Prep was barred from postseason play in all sports
during the 1991-92 school year after admitting to recruiting
violations in the football program. Most of the violations were
committed during the 1985 football season -- when Fullmer and Ortiz
were in elementary school -- touching off legal action by the
baseball team.</TE>
<TE>   The team suffered two more indignities during the last week of the
season. First came the denial of a temporary restraining order, which
would have allowed them to compete in the playoffs. Then came the
season finale.</TE>
<TE>   Montclair Prep was scheduled to end its season at Sierra Madre
Maranatha, but when the Mounties arrived, only eight players had
shown up for Maranatha. The game was forfeited even though Montclair
Prep offered to allow its opponent the use of a player. The Mounties
finished the season 18-5-1.</TE>
<TE>   "It was very frustrating," said Ortiz, the right-hander who is
scheduled to start Game 2 for the Giants tonight at Edison Field.
"All year you work hard and play to go to the playoffs. But we knew
that no matter how well we did, we weren't going to have the
opportunity to do that."</TE>
<TE>   Ten years later Ortiz and Fullmer are playing postseason baseball
at the highest level -- against each other.</TE>
<TE>   "I never thought we'd be here, both playing in the World Series,"
said Fullmer, who went into the World Series batting .316 in the
postseason with three doubles, a home run and four runs batted in.
"But you have to put personal feelings aside here. This is about
business, this is about getting a ring.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not my favorite thing to face guys I'm friends with, but I
already got that out of the way with him."</TE>
<TE>   Fullmer played against Ortiz as a member of the Montreal Expos in
the late 1990s, going one for six. "It was kind of a push," Fullmer
said. "I got a cheapie off him, and he got me out a few times.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't have any secrets [to hitting Ortiz]. He throws hard, he
comes right at you. We're going to have to go up there and swing the
bats."</TE>
<TE>   Ortiz is 2-0 this postseason, registering both victories against
Atlanta in the National League division series. The 28-year-old did
not fare as well in his start against St. Louis in the NL
championship series, giving up four runs -- all earned -- and five
hits in 4 2/3 innings to earn a no-decision.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't expect to have a good outing every single time," said
Ortiz, who went 14-10 with a 3.61 earned-run average in the regular
season. "The biggest thing is just giving the best effort. So I went
out there and gave the best effort I could for that day. I'm pretty
pleased with how I'm throwing and everything feels great."</TE>
<TE>   Walt Steele, who coached Ortiz and Fullmer at Montclair Prep, has
not been surprised by his former players' rise to prominence
considering the talent and work ethic they exhibited in high school.</TE>
<TE>   "Russ used to love to throw his cage sessions to Brad," Steele
said. "They had that competitiveness."</TE>
<TE>   When Montclair Prep's 1992 season ended prematurely, Ortiz
continued lifting weights and throwing off the mound to anyone who
would catch him. Fullmer wore out the batting cage near his home,
trying to improve on a junior season in which he hit 10 home runs and
struck out only twice.</TE>
<TE>   The extra work paid off in Fullmer's senior year when he set a
season school record with 15 home runs. He turned down a scholarship
from Stanford to sign with Montreal after setting records at
Montclair Prep with a .508 average, 30 home runs and 130 RBIs.</TE>
<TE>   Ortiz moved on to Oklahoma, where he was a three-year standout
before being drafted by the Giants after his junior season.</TE>
<TE>   The quiet, reserved Ortiz and brash Fullmer -- who sports a tattoo
on his right arm depicting an undead creature next to the words
"Can't Break Me" -- present a contrast in styles. Yet they were close
friends who stayed in touch after high school, dining with each other
after major league games, until finding themselves in different
leagues when Toronto acquired Fullmer before the 2000 season.</TE>
<TE>   Since then the friends have kept up through their Southern
California relatives, including Fullmer's mother Judy, an
administrator at Montclair Prep.</TE>
<TE>   "I see how he's doing in the papers and I'm sure he does too,"
Ortiz said.</TE>
<TE>   Said Fullmer: "I haven't talked to him in a while so we're going
to have to catch up. It's going to be fun."</TE>

<HD>Fox Broadcast Makes a Monkey of Itself</HD>
<DH></DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>"Monkey! Monkey! Who's got the monkey?!" Joe Buck hollered shortly
before the first pitch of the first game of the World Series on
Saturday evening. I don't know, call me old school, but I miss the
days when "Play ball" used to suffice.</LD>
<LD>   Buck, lead play-by-play baseball broadcaster for Fox, was excited,
and why shouldn't he be? Friday, while he was in town, Buck stopped
by Craig Kilborn's show to introduce the host before holdover
Letterman viewers switched to Conan O'Brien. A day later, Buck was
calling Game 1 of the World Series, and chances were good people were
going to stay tuned awhile, at least until Tim McCarver drove them to
the radio.</LD>
<LD>   Who's got the monkey? Buck didn't have to ask. Fox was all over
it, especially local Channel 11, which made 11 mentions of the rally
monkey, not counting a feature on the infernal beast, during its
"World Series Countdown" pregame show, which featured this highlight:
field reporter Jennifer Gould, standing outside Edison Field,
clicking the heels of her bright red sandals and announcing, "All
right, Dorothy had her ruby slippers, I've got my red. So Angels win
the World Series."</LD>
<TE>   Who was Gould's journalism instructor in college? Rex Hudler?</TE>
<TE>   Serious baseball fans thinking they were about to watch a historic
encounter between the Angels and the San Francisco Giants were
stunned when Channel 11's pregame show instead introduced another new
Fox cartoon: Super Barry versus The Rally Monkey.</TE>
<TE>   The matchup, as teased by the station:</TE>
<TE>   "One team led by one of the giants of the game."</TE>
<TE>   Cue footage of Barry Bonds' home-run swing.</TE>
<TE>   "The other spurred on by a monkey that rallies fans that thunder."</TE>
<TE>   No mention of Tim Salmon, Garret Anderson, Troy Glaus, Darin
Erstad or Jarrod Washburn.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels wait 42 years to play in their first World Series and
we're told the reason they finally got there is a mangy video mascot.</TE>
<TE>   For those who wondered, this is what happens when Disney puts a
team in the World Series.</TE>
<TE>   Once the local affiliate handed off to national Fox, at least we
learned that Salmon and Anderson and Glaus held roster spots on the
2002 American League champions.</TE>
<TE>   But we didn't hear anything about closer Troy Percival or backup
catcher Jose Molina or pinch-run specialist Chone Figgins during
pregame introductions.</TE>
<TE>   That's because the Angel reserves and relief pitchers, along with
the Giants', were not introduced before the game. Starters only.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels wanted to give every player on the playoff roster their
few moments in the spotlight -- it had been 42 years, after all --
but Fox pulled rank and cut the introductions short. "It was a
network decision," Angel vice president of communications Tim Mead
explained.</TE>
<TE>   Television viewers also missed the ceremonial first pitch --
another major moment in Angel history, since it was delivered by Gene
Autry's widow, Jackie, and caught by former Angel Chuck Finley, who
labored fruitlessly through so many failed Angel summers. Fox cut
that, too, although it generously managed to squeeze in a replay
during the game.</TE>
<TE>   Can't let baseball get in the way of "Boston Public" commercials.</TE>
<TE>   Baseball eventually happened, although Fox big-footed its way all
over another big event, Bonds' first World Series at-bat, which also
happened to produce Bonds' first World Series home run.</TE>
<TE>   This was can't-miss television, the game's biggest star breaking
another historic drought, but Fox found a way to foul it up, piping
in the sound of cheesy regal trumpets while Buck mock-dramatically
declared, "Royalty circles the bases in the second."</TE>
<TE>   The Giants won the opener, 4-3, but even if they go on to sweep
this thing, you get the feeling this is going to be a long World
Series.</TE>
<TE>   McCarver started talking about the rally monkey in the fourth
inning and Buck jokingly chided him, "You're not allowed to talk
about it till later in the game. For the sake of this country ... I'm
sure that before the end of this World Series, we'll have had our
monkey's fill."</TE>
<TE>   I do believe we're there already.</TE>

<LD>I think that Fox Sports' starting coverage of the 2002 World Series
was extremely flawed by not showing Jackie Autry throwing the first
pitch. This was disrespectful to Gene Autry and to all fans of the
game.</LD>

<TE>   Who are these baseball experts who know so much more than Tim
McCarver, who played 21 years and hit over .300 in three World
Series?</TE>
<TE>   As to his ability at analyzing the game, may I remind you that he
called the ninth-inning hit that won the 2001 Series for Arizona? He
noted that a left-handed batter often dropped a hit over the infield
with the fielders drawn in. Next pitch, that's exactly what happened
and the Diamondbacks were the champions.</TE>
<TE>   Despite what the letters said Saturday, he is a fine commentator.</TE>

<TE>   As a Dodger fan, my worst nightmare has become a reality: The
Angels and Giants are in the World Series while the Dodgers continue
to try to find themselves. Nevertheless, congratulations to the
current Angel players for their sheer determination in grinding out
victories. Their style of play is second to none.</TE>
<TE>   The same praise, however, cannot be relayed to the sudden wannabe
and fair-weather bandwagon fans suddenly pledging their allegiance to
the team. Where were you a few weeks back when only 26,000 turned out
to view a crucial game against the Oakland Athletics? At least the
Dodgers can draw 30,000 on a weekday night even against the Milwaukee
Brewers!</TE>
<TE>   Jim Edmonds said it best when he labeled Anaheim fans as
apathetic. Of course, it doesn't help when an organization doesn't
have a clue when it comes to marketing its team: The colors and logo
change just about every year! And this year is no different since the
choice was to recycle the old Texas Ranger uniform.</TE>
<TE>   Let's face it, despite its World Series appearance, the Angel
organization is clearly 20 years behind everyone, especially when it
comes to tapping into the lucrative Latino market. Remember, even our
Canadian neighbors (Blue Jays) saw this advantage in the early '80s
and it has taken the Angels that long in recognizing the obvious.</TE>
<TE>   My advice to Peter Ueberroth, Mexican billionaire Carlos Peralta
or any other potential buyers: Save your money.</TE>

<TE>   Bill Shaikin's Oct. 19 article asks if the 2002 World Series
really pits the two best teams against each other, or merely the two
"hottest" teams.</TE>
<TE>   Not mentioned is that these two teams were indeed the best in
their leagues over the full 162 games at something that ought to be a
pretty good indicator of quality baseball: The ability to score more
runs than the team allows.</TE>
<TE>   In the AL, the Angels scored 207 runs more than their opponents,
the best margin in the league (New York was next with 200, then
Boston with 194).</TE>
<TE>   In the NL, the Giants outscored their opponents by 167 runs. That
was the best margin, with Arizona next at 145. Atlanta, despite
having the most wins, was only third, at 143 more runs than their
opponents.</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes even 162 games is not enough to determine who is really
the best. But, thanks to the wild-card format, this Series really
does pit the best vs. the best.</TE>

<LD>A look at some classic World Series openers:</LD>
<LD>   1929 -- Rather than start Lefty Grove, the American League's best
pitcher, A's Manager Connie Mack chose veteran Howard Ehmke, who
pitched only 55 innings in the regular season. Ehmke gave up one
unearned run and struck out 13 in a 3-1 win.</LD>
<LD>   1954 -- Willie Mays' over-the-shoulder catch off Vic Wertz, the
most famous catch in Series history, kept Game 1 between the Giants
and Indians tied at 1-1. The Giants won, 5-3, in 10 innings and went
on to sweep the Series.</LD>
<TE>   1968 -- One of only two times that two eventual league MVPs faced
each other on the mound. Bob Gibson, Cardinals, vs. Denny McLain,
Tigers. Gibson struck out 17 in a 4-0 victory.</TE>
<TE>   1972 -- Oakland's Gene Tenace homered in his first two World
Series at-bats, a Series first. A's beat the Reds, 3-2.</TE>
<TE>   1982 -- Paul Molitor of Milwaukee had five hits, a World Series
record, in the 10-0 opener against the Cardinals in St. Louis. Mike
Caldwell tossed the shutout for the Brewers.</TE>
<TE>   1987 -- The Minnesota Twins overpowered St. Louis, 10-1, in the
first indoor World Series. Dan Gladden's grand slam capped a
seven-run fourth inning.</TE>
<TE>   1988 -- With two out in the bottom of the ninth, Kirk Gibson hit a
two-run, pinch homer to give the Dodgers a 5-4 victory over Oakland.
Gibson, who had a strained left knee, limped around the bases as the
Dodgers won one of the most dramatic games in Series history.</TE>

<LD>When Chuck Finley reached the playoffs with the Angels as a
23-year-old rookie in 1986, the left-hander figured it would be the
first of many postseason appearances, with a World Series or two or
three sprinkled in.</LD>
<LD>   "I thought that was the norm," said Finley, who caught the
ceremonial first pitch from former Angel owner Jackie Autry before
Game 1 Saturday night. "I said, 'Wow, OK, that's good. Next year
we'll just do it again, do it again.' Then there was a 16-year
drought, and I'm still not here.</LD>
<LD>   "I got here halfway, though. I had to drive my own truck in here
and borrow a ticket from Jackie. That's how I got to the World
Series. That's not quite the way I envisioned it."</LD>
<TE>   Finley, a fan favorite during a distinguished 14-year career in
Anaheim, left the Angels as a free agent to sign with Cleveland in
2000, and the Indians traded him to the St. Louis Cardinals in July.</TE>
<TE>   Finley went 1-0 with a 3.18 earned-run average in two playoff
starts for the Cardinals, who were eliminated by the San Francisco
Giants in the National League championship series, one step short of
a return to Anaheim this weekend.</TE>
<TE>   "It would have been a great storybook ending," Finley said. "It
probably would have given me closure of not only leaving Anaheim, but
17 years of baseball, just coming back to the place you started and
loved, playing in a World Series, that would have been terrific....</TE>
<TE>   "I'd be lying if I told you I wasn't a little envious of the fact
I'm not playing in [the Angels'] first World Series. But I'm honestly
happy for them.... These fans have been starving for this team. We
teased them so many times, from 1982 to '86 to '95 and '97. It's just
great to see a team that brought them to their feet and kept them on
their feet throughout the whole year."</TE>
<TE>   Finley, a free agent this winter, said he has "every intention of
going back and playing next season," and St. Louis General Manager
Walt Jocketty has told the 39-year-old he would like him to return.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels have five starting pitchers under contract or team
control, so there is virtually no chance of him returning to Anaheim
to close out his career.</TE>
<TE>   "I still feel like I can be very competitive and win a lot of
games," Finley said. "I'm not going to the East Coast, though, I can
tell you that. I'm either staying on this side of the line or I'm
going back to St. Louis."</TE>
<TE>   IN THE LIMELIGHT: Among the celebrities in attendance Saturday
night were actors Sylvester Stallone, John Travolta, Tim Allen and
David Hasselhoff, actress Bonnie Hunt, figure skater Michelle Kwan,
singer Jessica Simpson, and Peter Chernin, president and chief
operating officer of News Corp, which owns the Dodgers.</TE>
<TE>   Laker fans, bring the binoculars tonight: Kobe Bryant, Rick Fox,
Derek Fisher, Robert Horry and Samaki Walker are scheduled to attend
Game 2.</TE>
<TE>   Mingling on the field during batting practice were Hall of Fame
shortstop Ozzie Smith and Montreal Manager Frank Robinson. Cardinal
center fielder Jim Edmonds, a former Angel, and former Chicago Cub
Manager Don Baylor, another former Angel, also were in attendance.</TE>
<TE>   MO WHO?: Sign held by fan in Edison Field: "Hey Mo, Is That Couch
Comfy?" Mo, of course, is Mo Vaughn, the former Angel first baseman
who was traded to the New York Mets last winter.</TE>
<TE>   Vaughn ripped Southern California fans for being passive, saying
they "lacked that East Coast intensity." In a he-said, she-said spat
with former teammate Troy Percival last spring, Vaughn ripped the
Angels, saying, among other things, that "there ain't no flags flying
over Edison Field."</TE>
<TE>   Stoneman, when asked if he would invite Vaughn to hoist the
Angels' American League pennant in Edison Field next season, grinned
and said, "I'm not touching that one."</TE>
<TE>   FEATHERED FRIENDS: Feeling a need to commune with a few thousand
other Angel fans while the team travels to San Francisco this week?
The Mighty Ducks, the city of Anaheim and the Arrowhead Pond have
teamed up to allow fans to view Games 3, 4 and 5 from Pacific Bell
Park on the Pond's Diamond Vision screens.</TE>
<TE>   Tickets are $5 per person and will be sold at the Edison Field and
Pond box offices only. Doors will open at 4 p.m. each afternoon. In
addition, fans attending the Ducks' 1 p.m. game today against
Colorado will be allowed to stay in the Pond and watch Game 2 of the
World Series from Edison Field.</TE>
<TE>   -- MIKE DIGIOVANNA</TE>
<TE>   NO DICE: Giant Manager Dusty Baker was asked whether he's a
betting man, and whether he'd bet on returning as manager next
season.</TE>
<TE>   Baker, accustomed to similar questions over his uncertain status,
laughed.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't bet. That's one of the vices my dad wouldn't let me do as
a kid," he said. "My sister told on me when I was 12 years old that I
had some dice beneath my pillow. My dad took them out in the driveway
and broke them with a hammer. Broke my heart. I was going to get rich
at school.</TE>
<TE>   "My dad said no son of his was going to be a gambler."</TE>

<HD>Indonesia Arrests Cleric in Bombings</HD>
<DH>Abu Bakar Bashir is taken into custody a day after being
hospitalized, signaling the country is willing to move against
terrorism.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Richard C. Paddock</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>JAKARTA, Indonesia</DL>
<LD>Radical Muslim cleric Abu Bakar Bashir, accused of heading a
terrorist network in Southeast Asia, was arrested Saturday for his
alleged role in a series of deadly church bombings and a plot to
assassinate President Megawati Sukarnoputri.</LD>
<LD>   The arrest, after months of pressure from the United States,
signaled a new willingness by Indonesia to crack down on suspected
terrorists, although it remains to be seen how seriously the
government will pursue other suspects.</LD>
<LD>   Authorities say Bashir is the spiritual leader of Jemaah Islamiah,
a group seeking to create an Islamic state in Southeast Asia.
Singaporean officials say that the organization has close ties to Al
Qaeda and that several of its members were trained at the terrorist
network's camps in Afghanistan.</LD>
<TE>   Authorities suspect that Jemaah Islamiah had a role in a car
bombing last weekend outside two nightclubs on the island of Bali
that killed more than 180 people, but Bashir has not been charged in
that case.</TE>
<TE>   Bashir, who served three years in prison for anti-government
activities during the rule of former President Suharto, says he has
never been involved in terrorist activities. He denies that he is the
leader of Jemaah Islamiah and contends that the group does not exist.</TE>
<TE>   Bashir was placed under arrest at a hospital in the Central Java
city of Solo where he was taken Friday because of what aides said was
exhaustion and respiratory problems. He had agreed earlier to report
to the police for questioning.</TE>
<TE>   Police doctors examined Bashir and determined that he was not
suffering serious health problems, said Brig. Gen. Saleh Saaf, the
national police spokesman.</TE>
<TE>   "The police don't believe he is sick," Saaf said. "He might be
pretending."</TE>
<TE>   It was unclear how long Bashir would remain in the hospital and
whether he would be taken to Jakarta, the Indonesian capital, for
questioning.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the victims of the Bali bombing were Australian, and on
Saturday, President Bush offered Australia his condolences in a taped
speech broadcast there.</TE>
<TE>   "Together we face an enemy which does not value innocent life, an
enemy which tries to terrorize the free world into inaction," Bush
said. "They will fail. Together we will hunt down the killers so that
there's justice in the world. Together we will fight terror so as to
keep the peace and to make the world more free."</TE>
<TE>   Bashir's alleged role as the head of Jemaah Islamiah emerged in
January after authorities in Singapore and Malaysia broke up a
suspected suicide-attack plot targeting seven sites with truck bombs,
including the U.S. Embassy in Singapore. Suspects arrested in both
countries identified Bashir as the leader of the group.</TE>
<TE>   Bashir has appeared to relish the attention, giving interview
after interview in which he promotes radical Islam.</TE>
<TE>   Police accuse Bashir of helping to mastermind a series of nearly
simultaneous church bombings on Christmas Eve 2000 that killed 19
people in cities across Indonesia.</TE>
<TE>   He also is accused of playing a role in a botched plot to
assassinate President Megawati last year with a bomb planted in a
shopping mall.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, Bashir is charged with having a role in the 1999
bombing of the Istiqlal mosque, Jakarta's most important, in the hope
that blame would fall on Christians and spark religious conflict.</TE>
<TE>   The charges are based mainly on the statements of Omar Faruq, a
confessed Al Qaeda member who was apprehended by Indonesian
intelligence agents in June and quietly turned over to the United
States. After Indonesian police officials interviewed Faruq in the
U.S., they returned to Indonesia last week and brought charges
against Bashir.</TE>
<TE>   Adang Syafaat, the executive secretary at the Istiqlal mosque at
the time of the bombing, said that it is hard to believe that a
Muslim could have bombed a mosque and that he doubts Bashir is
guilty. But he said whoever has been carrying out bombings ,
especially the one in Bali, should be caught and punished.</TE>
<TE>   "It means there is a person who wants to destroy this Republic of
Indonesia," he said. "If the police find him, whether he is
Indonesian or Muslim or even a cleric, he should hang."</TE>

<LD>   France, which has more than 1,000 troops in its former colony,
agreed to monitor the cease-fire, signed last week, until a regional
force can be sent to help end the month-old conflict.</LD>
<LD>   The fighting has left hundreds dead and displaced more than
200,000. French troops have evacuated hundreds of foreigners since a

<DL></DL>
<LD>Irish voters went to the polls on whether to approve a vast European
Union expansion, a proposal they rejected last year. Approval would
remove the last major legal impediment to expanding the EU into a
community of nearly half a billion people.</LD>
<LD>   With less than a sixth of the vote counted, the proposal was
leading about 66% to 33%. Final results are expected today.</LD>
<LD>   The expansion would also reorganize EU institutions to streamline
decision-making. It must be ratified by all 15 current members to
take effect, and 14 already have done so by parliamentary vote.
Ireland's Constitution required a referendum.</LD>

<HD>Beautiful Mind Meets Match as Computer Ties Chess Champ</HD>
<DH>Russian master's crucial move was an elegant one, but the
all-business machine saw its fatal flaw. 'Brains in Bahrain' series
is another draw.</DH>

<DL>MANAMA, Bahrain</DL>
<LD>In the end, world chess champion Vladimir Kramnik was apparently
undone by an attribute that separates humans from machines: an
appreciation of beauty.</LD>
<LD>   After eight matches, a contest here between the Russian-born champ
and a German-made computer program, Deep Fritz, was declared a draw
Saturday night. Tied with two victories each and three draws, Kramnik
and the computer battled to another draw in what was billed as the
tiebreaker in the $1-million "Brains in Bahrain" competition at the
Bahrain Mindsports Center, chess headquarters for this Persian Gulf
nation.</LD>
<LD>   Chess analysts said Kramnik's failure to beat Deep Fritz was due
to a miscue earlier in the week--a knight sacrifice--that was a thing
of beauty to a chess aficionado because of its intricate strategy but
that the computer immediately saw as a fatal mistake.</LD>
<TE>   Deep Fritz pounced, and Kramnik's chances for victory were ruined.</TE>
<TE>   "That's the weakness of humans: They are seduced by beauty," said
Justin Ricketts, an official of a London-based sports marketing firm
that helped promote the match for the kingdom of Bahrain and a
British television company.</TE>
<TE>   Frederic Friedel, a founder of ChessBase, the German firm that
created Deep Fritz, said the computer's greatest strength was not its
calculating speed but its ability to stay focused.</TE>
<TE>   "Vladimir understands hundreds of times more about chess than the
computer," Friedel said. "But tactically, Fritz is a monster and will
always put a human under pressure."</TE>
<TE>   In Saturday's match, Kramnik, 27, who dethroned Garry Kasparov two
years ago as world champion, played more defensively, seemingly
content to tie the computer. In 1997, Kasparov was beaten by the IBM
computer program Deep Blue.</TE>
<TE>   Kramnik, at a post-match news conference, said Kasparov lost then
because he tailored his strategy to competing with a computer and was
playing "a game that was not even chess." He said he had played
against the computer just as he would have against a human opponent.</TE>
<TE>   Kramnik will receive $800,000; the handlers of Deep Fritz,
$200,000. The money was put up by King Hamed ibn Isa Khalifa.</TE>
<TE>   If Kramnik had won, he would have received $1 million and the
computer nothing. If Deep Fritz had won, the computer company would
have gotten $400,000 and Kramnik $600,000.</TE>
<TE>   Enrique Irazoqui, a Spanish chess champion who served as arbiter
for the competition, said he thought that Kramnik was done in by the
computer's quick and relentless moves. Deep Fritz also began each
game with a different opening.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought Vladimir, with his deep strategy and long-term
thinking, was the kind of opponent that a computer would fear most,"
Irazoqui said. "But after his blunder, I think he was worn out."</TE>
<TE>   Kramnik said that the moves he made probably would have beaten
humans but that the computer was able to spot flaws.</TE>
<TE>   "I made some mistakes, which is very human," he said.</TE>

<DL>BUKAVU, Congo</DL>
<LD>The nation's main rebel group said Saturday that it had retaken the
strategic port town of Uvira after fighting in which scores of
civilians and soldiers died, reigniting the war in eastern Congo.</LD>
<LD>   The rebel advance triggered the flight of more than 30,000 Uvira
inhabitants toward Burundi's frontier. The rebel group, the
Rwandan-backed Rally for Congolese Democracy, said it had recaptured
Uvira, which pro-government Mai-Mai tribal militias had taken six
days ago.</LD>
<LD>   Rwandan President Paul Kagame accused Congolese President Joseph
Kabila of backing the militias and undermining efforts to bring
peace.</LD>
<TE>   Under a peace accord between Rwanda and Congo in July, most
foreign troops withdrew from the vast Central African country this
month, but violence has flared in the power vacuum left by retreating
armies, causing renewed tension.</TE>
<TE>   A rebel spokesman said 100 people were killed in the night battle
to recapture Uvira.</TE>

<HD>Divide Widens for Hamburg's Muslims</HD>
<DH>In a German city linked to Sept. 11 hijackers, pressure
from police and hate groups are pushing Islamic immigrants further
onto fringes of society.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jeffrey Fleishman</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>HAMBURG, Germany</DL>
<LD>HAMBURG, Germany -- Through alleys scented with oranges and peppered
lamb, Afghan spice sellers sip morning tea with Pakistani vegetable
vendors. Mothers wearing head scarves hurry children to school, past
trickling sounds of water as men in mosques wash their hands in deep
porcelain sinks before prayers.</LD>
<LD>   Just beyond the German train station, past prostitutes and
methadone addicts, the Muslim neighborhood unfolds, moving, as it has
for decades, to its own sequestered rhythms. Life here, though, has
been disrupted since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks on America. More
undercover police ply the alleys, more young men are hauled in for
questioning. Phones are tapped. Businesses are searched. Computers
are confiscated.</LD>
<LD>   Hamburg's Muslim neighborhoods are retracting -- some would say
they are being pushed -- further away from German society. Anger,
distrust and cultural suspicions are widening rifts between German
and Islamic communities throughout this nation of 82 million -- 3.5
million of whom are Muslim. Those on both sides worry that deepening
divisions will stoke radical elements and complicate this country's
long-standing problem with integration.</LD>
<TE>   "If a few Muslim men gather on the sidewalks, the police come and
say, 'Ah, you're from Afghanistan. Do you sympathize with the
Taliban? With Osama bin Laden? With Al Qaeda?' " said Abdul Hai
Zakarwal, an Afghan cleric at a local mosque. "Germans are now
suspicious when they look into an Arab face. I have no innocent blood
on my hands."</TE>
<TE>   Hamburg has a storied history as a cosmopolitan city-state built
on trade and commerce. But its recent past is clouded by Sept. 11
hijacker Mohamed Atta and his terrorist cell. Logistics for the
attacks on New York City and the Pentagon were refined here.
Fanaticism was cultivated, money raised -- all quietly, beneath the
surface. It is an irony of sorts that while Atta was living at
Marienstrasse 54 and a few Hamburg mullahs were preaching jihad, or
holy struggle, the primary task of police in this port city of 1.7
million was curbing skinhead and neo-Nazi violence.</TE>
<TE>   The police now have put this neighborhood under a microscope.
There is little doubt that religious extremists live among the
Moroccan booksellers and Turkish barbers.</TE>
<TE>   Police estimate that Hamburg has 1,000 Islamic radicals, about 100
of whom are considered dangerous. Still, that is only a fraction of
the city's Muslim population of 150,000, many of whom claim that they
are stereotyped and harassed.</TE>
<TE>   "Many Germans in Hamburg have lost their innocence," said Heino
Vahldieck, head of the city's domestic intelligence agency. "Their
trust of Muslims has diminished, and this is affecting Muslims. They
all feel under suspicion. A girl wearing a veil these days could
easily become a heated topic at a school board meeting. I don't know
how to stop that."</TE>
<TE>   Less than a mile from Vahldieck's office, a man who gave his name
only as Isaak stood in the dusk outside an Albanian mosque. He was
bundled in a jacket, a cap snug on his head. A construction laborer,
he had a thick chest and rough hands.</TE>
<TE>   Isaak moved to Germany from Macedonia 13 years ago. He is a Muslim
with a 4-month-old son and barely enough money for rent. He pays
taxes and speaks German, but he has been denied citizenship.</TE>
<TE>   "I used to feel German. But now I feel like more of a foreigner,"
Isaak said. "Every time I unzip my backpack and pull out a newspaper,
the Germans stare at me and wonder if it's a bomb. I blame the
politicians. They've frightened the public. Germans think there are
hundreds of thousands of sleeper cells all over the country."</TE>
<TE>   He kept speaking, an angry whisper concealed with a smile.</TE>
<TE>   "There are people here who think Atta is a good man," Isaak said.
He didn't count himself as one.</TE>
<TE>   "What happened in the U.S. was tragic," he said. "But what about
all the murdered Muslims in Palestine, Bosnia and Kosovo? What about
Muslim suffering? Some in this neighborhood say America brought the
attacks on itself.... And here the neo-Nazis are putting hate
leaflets in our mailboxes."</TE>
<TE>   About 80% of Germany's Muslims are Turks who migrated here after
World War II. Their children attended German schools and took German
jobs. They were followed by others: war refugees from the former
Yugoslav federation and migrants fleeing economic turmoil in Africa
and the Middle East.</TE>
<TE>   Because they straddled two worlds, balancing Muslim souls with
German livelihoods, assimilation for Turks, Pakistanis and Afghans
has always been confusing. Sensitive of its Third Reich past, Germany
is careful not to discriminate against different cultures and is
tolerant of religious expression by law. But many Muslims, even ones
with German citizenship, complain that they feel estranged. Young
women often discard the head scarves of their faith in order to blend
in better. Men sometimes dye their hair blond and wear blue contact
lenses to disguise their dark features.</TE>
<TE>   In the mid-1990s, a Hamburg social agency and the Muslim community
made some progress on integration: Sections of local cemeteries were
set aside for Islamic burials, and Muslim prisoners were permitted to
pray more freely in jail. There was an effort at religious education
in Hamburg institutions for young men wanting to become mullahs and
imams. Most religious clerics now come from Turkey and the Middle
East, knowing little of German culture or sensibilities.</TE>
<TE>   The Sept. 11 terrorist attacks and a changing political landscape
sent a chill through Hamburg's integration aspirations. The new
conservative government, reacting to Germans' fears of foreigners,
shut down the social agency that worked with immigrants. Police here
and throughout Germany questioned scores of terrorist suspects,
parading some before TV cameras but making few arrests.</TE>
<TE>   "We've always led separate lives from German society," said
Mustafa Yoldas, deputy chairman of the Council of Islamic
Communities. "Conservative politicians say, 'Foreigners eat our
breakfast.' My father worked here 40 years -- he deserves a
breakfast. I'm a second-generation German. The politicians are under
pressure to show Germans they live in security. But they are not
realizing what they are doing to Muslims.... It's a very dangerous
situation."</TE>
<TE>   Yoldas and other Islamic leaders fear that the pressure the Muslim
community is under may foment extremist passions. "Right now," said
Yoldas, a doctor, "we are trying to control radical elements. We're
stopping the fiery speeches in mosques. We've eliminated radical
books, including one by a Turkish writer that denies the Holocaust
happened.... I've spoken at 160 seminars since Sept. 11 trying to
ease tensions.</TE>
<TE>   "A woman who works in the hospital asked me after Sept. 11,
'Mustafa, are you supporting Osama bin Laden?' I said, 'You've known
me for so long. Can you really imagine my doing that?' "</TE>
<TE>   A Moroccan who emigrated from Casablanca 11 years ago, Abdelhak
Safer runs the Islamic Attawhid bookstore two blocks from the Al Quds
mosque, where Atta used to pray. The titles in Safer's shop include
"The Battle of the Prophet," "International Islam" and "Jesus, Son of
Mary." Safer, who is married to a German, said life was hard but good
until July 3, when police raided his home and store.</TE>
<TE>   Safer and seven other men from Morocco, Egypt and Afghanistan had
been under surveillance for months. Police suspected them of plotting
jihad while they drank tea in Safer's store. Safer's computers and
CD-ROMs were confiscated. He was interrogated for 10 hours and
released. His bookstore stayed shuttered for three months during the
police investigation. Safer says he lost about $15,000 in business,
and his landlord, fearing that he's a terrorist, wants him to move.</TE>
<TE>   "The police are just looking for scapegoats," said Safer, who
hired a lawyer. The federal prosecutor's office said it has no
evidence that Safer planned terrorist attacks. Its investigation is
continuing. "It's been a business disaster," Safer said. "It's
becoming too much. You can't make us all guilty people."</TE>
<TE>   But one of the men who sipped tea in the bookshop was arrested and
charged last week with supporting Atta's sleeper cell. Abdelghani
Mzoudi is suspected of providing logistical support and money to
terrorists, including hijacker Marwan Al-Shehhi, believed to have
piloted the Boeing 767 that hit the south tower of the World Trade
Center. Mzoudi visited an Al Qaeda training camp in Afghanistan and
was one of two people to sign Atta's will, police said.</TE>
<TE>   It is such overlapping relationships within an insular community
that led police into the lives of men such as Safer. It is difficult,
law enforcement officials said, to infiltrate this world and weed out
terrorist sympathizers from those just sipping tea. Safer said many
people came through his shop. They chatted about religion and
politics. They spoke of families and of living as immigrants.</TE>
<TE>   "The police said we wanted to 'die for Allah,' " Safer said. "No
one said that."</TE>
<TE>   Around the corner, the sun was rising, slanting in the alleys and
off the dome of a mosque. On one side of this Muslim neighborhood,
shopping carts clattered at a Wal-Mart; on the other, the neon of
brothels had been switched off, the prostitutes had retreated. The
Lebanese butcher sharpened his knife. Young men sat in barbershops,
laughing and dreaming of Kurdistan.</TE>
<TE>   This is Mehmet Cicek's world.</TE>
<TE>   He wore a peacoat against the cold. The son of a Turkish guest
worker, Cicek arrived in Hamburg in 1987. He was 14. His father
worked in a gold and silver factory. "By the time I was born," he
said, "my dad was already speaking German." Cicek went to a German
school. But he said he doesn't see much of a future here, not since
Sept. 11, when some of his German friends stopped calling and police
spent more time eyeing him.</TE>
<TE>   "You can grow up here, but you're always an outsider," he said.
"When I'm here, I feel like a visitor. Some of my friends dyed their
hair blond. It changed nothing. We really feel at home nowhere. Not
Germany, not Turkey."</TE>
<TE>   He lighted a cigarette and looked down a street crowded with men
just like him. "They don't trust us anymore," he said.</TE>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia</DL>
<LD>KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia -- In an era of resurgent Islam, Zainah Anwar
is a different kind of holy warrior.</LD>
<LD>   She's a moderate.</LD>
<LD>   An articulate, outspoken Malaysian who peppers her arguments with
Koranic verses, Zainah is in a high-profile fight against the
fundamentalism that has swept in from the Middle East and elsewhere
in Asia over the last two decades. Today, that fundamentalism buffets
her country -- a moderate Muslim nation.</LD>
<TE>   "We are fighting within the rules and laws of Islam," she said in
a recent interview. "We're challenging their [fundamentalist] laws on
their grounds."</TE>
<TE>   Unlike hard-liners in many Middle Eastern countries who have been
driven underground by their regimes, Malaysia's fundamentalists
pursue their agenda openly -- and so far peacefully -- through the
country's main opposition party.</TE>
<TE>   As such, Malaysia provides a rare glimpse into a vital struggle in
the Muslim world -- that between moderates and conservatives for
political supremacy and the power to shape one of the world's great
religions. Few are prepared to predict the outcome, in part because
events elsewhere in the Muslim world threaten to shift the balance.</TE>
<TE>   The country's religious moderates -- often accused of being
aligned too closely with the West -- fear that a U.S.-led attack on
Iraq would almost certainly bring new strength to the fundamentalists
and erode their own support.</TE>
<TE>   In an especially pessimistic assessment, Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamad expressed concern in a recent interview in the Financial
Times newspaper that a U.S.-led attack on Saddam Hussein would not
only generate more recruits to the extremist cause but could also
spark a global wave of communal violence.</TE>
<TE>   It wouldn't be the first time that unexpected events both at home
and far away have whipsawed the momentum in the battle for dominance.
The 1999 imprisonment of popular former Deputy Prime Minister Anwar
Ibrahim, following a trial widely viewed by his supporters as a
Mahathir vendetta, triggered large-scale defections by moderates,
with voters repelled by what they saw as a vindictive, unjust kind of
rule.</TE>
<TE>   The fundamentalist Pan-Malaysian Islamic Party, known by its Malay
acronym, PAS, quickly converted its advantage into strong election
gains later that year. The party's image as a largely honest movement
drew additional support as Mahathir's United Malays National
Organization battled accusations of corruption and crony capitalism.</TE>
<TE>   But two years later, the Sept. 11 attacks on the United States
reversed the pendulum's swing as moderates recoiled at the atrocities
committed in the name of their religion. Subsequent calls by PAS
leaders for a jihad, or holy struggle, against the United States also
played badly in a country that has sent many of its young to America
for advanced education and has the U.S. as its single biggest trading
partner.</TE>
<TE>   "Their reaction stunned people," Zainah said. "Did it mean that
PAS was ready to declare war on the U.S.? It showed just how little
attention PAS gives to realities."</TE>
<TE>   Added Chandra Muzaffar, a former political ally of Anwar's and now
head of a social issues think tank called International Movement for
a Just World: "Sept. 11 made a lot of Malaysians aware of a trend in
Islam they're not comfortable with."</TE>
<TE>   As the struggle among Malaysia's Muslims unfolds, Zainah has been
a consistent and controversial voice. Twelve years ago, she
co-founded and now heads a group of professional women called Sisters
in Islam, committed to promoting women's rights within the framework
of Islam.</TE>
<TE>   But she and her group are far from alone.</TE>
<TE>   Their allies include both Mahathir and leaders of Malaysia's
sizable non-Muslim minorities, who make up about 40% of the
population.</TE>
<TE>   Energized by the sudden reversal of his opponents' political
fortunes, Mahathir has gone on the offensive during much of the last
year, lashing out at his PAS opponents, accusing them of "shamelessly
misinterpreting" Islam for short-term political gain, even hinting
that he might ban the party.</TE>
<TE>   The atmosphere has also been sharpened by the death last summer of
the party's longtime leader, Fadzil Noor, a man considered to have
been a moderating influence on the party's harder-line elements.</TE>
<TE>   His successor, Abdul Hadi Awang, the governor of the northeastern
state of Terengganu, is far more conservative. It was under his
leadership that the state legislature two months ago passed laws
under the ancient legal code of hudud that included sentences of
stoning to death for adulterers and hand amputation for convicted
thieves. Although a federal challenge has prevented immediate
implementation of the new law, Hadi has vowed to press forward.</TE>
<TE>   So far, the debate over the future shape of Islam has remained
free of violence. PAS leaders note proudly that they have won power
in two of the country's 13 states via the ballot box and insist that
they are committed to the democratic process.</TE>
<TE>   "As much as people would like to paint us as extremists, we have
never gone beyond the bounds of parliamentary democracy," declared
Dzulkifli Ahmad, a senior PAS strategist. "But we make no bones that
our party hinges on Islamic ideology, and we make it clear we want
Islam setting the rules for our society."</TE>
<TE>   Dzulkifli stressed that the party strictly forbids incitement or
incendiary rhetoric and now claims that it was wrong to declare a
holy war against the United States following the first U.S. bombing
raids on Afghanistan last October.</TE>
<TE>   "We made a mistake," he said. "We were seen as going overboard."</TE>
<TE>   A strong cultural aversion to direct confrontation and violence
plus the political safety valve of free elections have helped contain
tensions that have exploded elsewhere in the Muslim world. Here,
those tensions have generated free-wheeling debate.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel safe expressing the views that I have," Zainah said. "I've
had no death threats, no demonstrations against us." Still, the
stakes are high, the mood frequently strained.</TE>
<TE>   "If PAS holds sway, this could become a difficult place for women
and for the [non-Muslim] Chinese and Indian minorities," a senior
Western diplomat said.</TE>
<TE>   Although Zainah said she has not felt physically threatened, she
also recognizes that there are limits.</TE>
<TE>   "There's definitely a hostile reaction to our message," she
acknowledged.</TE>
<TE>   Many moderate Islamic scholars avoid the debate completely for
fear of being branded anti-Islamic. In part because of this, Zainah
said, her group and others like it have been pushed toward the
forefront of the moderate cause -- a position that she says required
mastering the Koran at a new level.</TE>
<TE>   Her battlegrounds include:</TE>
<TE>   * Opposing fundamentalist calls that a Muslim renouncing Islam be
sentenced to death. Aside from challenging the Koranic underpinning
for capital punishment, she also argued that it is inappropriate for
Malaysia's multicultural society, where interfaith marriages are
common.</TE>
<TE>   "Are you going to sentence to death a woman who converted to Islam
upon marriage to a Muslim man, but then gives it up in divorce?" she
asked. "I don't think that is justice."</TE>
<TE>   * Challenging a federal Religious Affairs Department proposal this
year to ban all but Islamic scholars from making public statements on
Islamic issues.</TE>
<TE>   * Rejecting polygamy as an ultimate right of Muslim males and the
Koranic justification for Muslim men to beat their wives and
children.</TE>
<TE>   In response, PAS officials dismiss such issues as overblown and
irrelevant. Traditional laws and draconian punishments are needed to
rescue a culture on a moral slide toward decadence, Dzulkifli said.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to purify society," he said. "Punishments are strong
precisely so they will never have to be used."</TE>
<TE>   Where this struggle leads remains unclear, but some talk of
eventual compromise. If Mahathir steps down as planned next year,
they reason, then Anwar Ibrahim may one day emerge from prison to
lead a more moderate Muslim party to power.</TE>
<TE>   "Malaysia may be the first to have an Islamic democratic party
like the Christian Democrats in Europe," said James Wong, chief
political analyst for the independent online newspaper
Malaysiakini.com. "Anwar could be a role model for the Islamic
world."</TE>

<HD>U.S. Works to Pressure North Korea Over Arms</HD>
<DH>Envoys will ask Tokyo, Moscow, London and Paris to persuade
the Communist state to reverse course on its nuclear program.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mark Magnier</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>SEOUL</DL>
<LD>The U.S. plans no hard and fast response to North Korea's admission
this month that it is trying to develop nuclear weapons. But the
administration expects to exert maximum pressure through allies and
intermediaries to persuade the isolated Communist state to reverse
course, a senior American official said Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   "This is a difficult and complex problem," Assistant Secretary of
State James A. Kelly told reporters here after meeting with senior
South Korean officials. "The easiest [solution] would be for North
Korea to immediately and visibly dismantle this program."</LD>
<LD>   Senior North Korean officials confirmed Oct. 5 that their country
has been seeking to join the nuclear club -- according to the U.S.,
after Kelly confronted them in their capital, Pyongyang, with
evidence of their uranium enrichment program. North Korea hasn't
commented on the issue since the story broke Wednesday.</LD>
<TE>   Kelly denied Saturday that North Korea had offered a formal
package deal under which it would give up its weapons program if
Washington agreed to forswear a first strike, sign a peace treaty and
acknowledge the Pyongyang government.</TE>
<TE>   But, he said, North Korea did suggest "when all of these wonderful
things were done, that then we might be able to talk about their
uranium enrichment program."</TE>
<TE>   "That in my mind has it upside-down," he added.</TE>
<TE>   Before receiving hard evidence of the North Korean weapons
program, the U.S. was poised last summer to offer the North a "bold
approach" of economic and diplomatic benefits, Kelly said. Then it
shifted gears to confront the regime, he said.</TE>
<TE>   At his meeting in Pyongyang, Kelly found the North Korean
admission harsh and surprising, he said. He did not explain, however,
why the administration waited several months to raise the issue with
Pyongyang and nearly two weeks after the confirmation to inform the
world.</TE>
<TE>   Kelly and Undersecretary of State John Bolton are on a whirlwind
tour of global capitals in a bid to get allies to use their leverage
on North Korea to end research into, fuel enrichment for, and
development and production of nuclear weapons.</TE>
<TE>   Both men were in Beijing on Friday before splitting up. Kelly was
scheduled to fly to Tokyo today after his South Korean visit, while
Bolton was set to travel to Moscow, Paris and London before heading
home.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts say Washington is trying to gain agreement from those
with influence on North Korea not to offer it any money or aid even
as they urge it to comply. South Korean Unification Minister Jeong Se
Hyun arrived in Pyongyang on Saturday for a long-scheduled three-day
visit, while Japan is set to meet with North Korean leaders in
Malaysia at the end of the month.</TE>
<TE>   North Korea's admission appears to violate its pledge under the
1994 agreed framework to give up its plutonium weapons program in
return for 500,000 tons of fuel oil annually and two light-water
civilian nuclear reactors. Kelly declined to say whether the pact is
now dead.</TE>
<TE>   North Korea's disclosures have come at a bad time for the U.S.
administration. They have diverted attention from Iraq, and the
administration's desire to unseat Saddam Hussein, and put Washington
on the defensive as to why Iraq merits unilateral action while North
Korea, with potentially more menacing weapons, does not.</TE>
<TE>   "It's pretty clear Washington was not expecting true confessions
on this one and is now trying to figure how to respond without
undermining its Iraq effort," said Ralph A. Cossa, executive director
of the Pacific Forum Center for Strategic &amp; International Studies.</TE>
<TE>   The admission by Pyongyang has also brought unwelcome attention to
the nuclear technology and know-how that Pakistan, China and Russia
may have provided the North -- at a time when Washington has placed
their future support in a war against Iraq well above any past
misdeeds.</TE>
<TE>   Leaders of all three countries have denied any involvement with
Pyongyang, and Kelly refused to comment Saturday on their alleged
links to North Korea, characterizing the issue as an "intelligence
matter."</TE>
<TE>   Washington and Seoul have had their differences over North Korea
policy, with many hard-liners in the Bush administration dismissing
South Korean President Kim Dae Jung as a pushover. Kelly, who
appeared relaxed during his 25-minute news conference, expressed
polite support for recent efforts by his hosts and neighboring Japan
to engage the North, as well as for Pyongyang's nascent steps to open
its economy and expand international contacts.</TE>
<TE>   But he also said he disagreed with the interpretation provided by
several South Korean officials that North Korea's nuclear confession
was its way of coming clean and opening diplomatic channels.</TE>
<TE>   "There are many ways to signal a forthcoming dialogue rather than
that," Kelly said, especially since Pyongyang initially said it had
no desire or need for dialogue, he added.</TE>
<TE>   The best way for North Korea to resume communication, which broke
off at the end of the Clinton administration, would be to end its
violation of past agreements on limiting nuclear weapons, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts said Kelly's efforts to win Tokyo and Seoul over to the
tougher U.S. position could prove difficult. South Korea and Japan
have both experienced a warming in relations with the North in recent
months.</TE>
<TE>   "They're three bedfellows sharing the same bed with different
dreams," said Lee Dong Bok, a university professor here.</TE>
<TE>   "I think what Washington would like to see happen is to somehow
keep the North Korea issue on hold until there's a new government in
Seoul," Lee added. South Korea goes to the polls in December.</TE>

<HD>A Week Later, Balinese Gather to Pay Homage to Bombing
Victims</HD>
<DH>Hundreds hold vigil at blast site. As authorities probe
possible Muslim links to attack, locals vow to preserve island's
religious balance.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Ching-Ching Ni</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>KUTA, Indonesia</DL>
<LD>A week before, they had to shout to hear one another above the
partyers at Bali's most famous tourist hangout. Saturday night --
same time, same place -- all they had to do was whisper.</LD>
<LD>   Everybody could hear the pain in the air, spoken or not,
especially the once happy-go-lucky young Balinese who had their
hearts shattered along with their peace of mind in this tropical
paradise.</LD>
<LD>   "I just want to cry, but I can't. I just want to blame somebody,
but who?" said Gede Sandi, 25, as he sat on a curbside after a vigil
here marking the worst terrorist attack in Indonesian history.</LD>
<TE>   Exactly a week earlier, more than 180 people died after a car bomb
tore up the popular Sari Club and gutted the neighborhood around it
that once epitomized night life in this vacation dreamland.</TE>
<TE>   Hundreds of people have been drifting to the site to place wreaths
and say prayers. Flowers are piled so high that they've almost buried
the bombed-out Aloha beachwear store next to the hole in the ground
where the Sari Club used to stand.</TE>
<TE>   The smells of death and flowers mingle in the sea breeze. Candles
flicker in the darkness, shedding faint light on the remains of the
departed: blackened hiking boots without mates; scratched motorcycle
helmets; a ripped baseball cap; deformed bar stools; an LP; a pair of
blue baby's sandals.</TE>
<TE>   By day, the area is part of a crime scene, off limits to ordinary
people who want to pay their respects. By night, it turns into a
public cemetery, as vigils hum under the watchful eyes of armed
guards.</TE>
<TE>   "This place is like a ghost town," Hermy Novianti, 19, said in
hushed tones. "We used to pass this way almost every day."</TE>
<TE>   "It's 100% different," said her friend Ledina Natalia, 20.</TE>
<TE>   Indonesian officials said Saturday that they will open the entire
street to the public Wednesday, including the site of the bombing.</TE>
<TE>   Some Balinese want that to happen so people can see the
devastation, rebuild and move on. Others want to know when justice
will be meted out.</TE>
<TE>   "In my heart, I want to punch them, whoever did this," said Made
Wardana, 22.</TE>
<TE>   "I want them to be put to death and have the whole world watch it
on TV. But if we did that, we would be no different from the
bombers," Sandi said. "The Balinese people believe in karma. Maybe
we'll get our revenge in their next life."</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the young people here turn to one another for
consolation and vow to live by example. They know investigators are
focusing on Muslim extremists with connections to the Al Qaeda
terrorist network. They know that's a potential threat to the
delicate religious harmony on this fabled resort isle, the only Hindu
enclave in the world's most populous Muslim nation.</TE>
<TE>   But they trust their friendship more.</TE>
<TE>   "He's my best friend," said Harmanto Anton, 30, a Muslim, as he
put his arm on the shoulder of Sandi, who is Hindu.</TE>
<TE>   Somehow, the tragedy and their close call seem to have brought
them closer. On the night of the blast, this group of friends planned
to head to Paddy's Irish Club, across the street from Sari's. Both
were packed with foreigners, great spots to make friends and practice
their English.</TE>
<TE>   The friends were supposed to meet up at midnight. The explosion
happened around 11:30. One of their buddies passed by the area
earlier and was killed.</TE>
<TE>   "I hate the people who made the bombs," said Sandi, sitting in a
traditional Balinese sarong next to his friend, who wore a white
embroidered skullcap. "But I don't hate the religion. He's Muslim.
I'm Hindu. We have Bali together."</TE>
<TE>   The world, however, may not be so kind, or so willing to
distinguish good from evil.</TE>
<TE>   Wardana said that last weekend, he had just been hired to work on
an American cruise ship. But after the bomb attack, he no longer has
the job.</TE>
<TE>   "There were 180 candidates from Bali," he said. "But after what
happened, they said they would not take any more Indonesians."</TE>
<TE>   The rest of the Balinese economy, too, is taking a beating. To
locals, Kuta used to stand for "Kampung Untuk Tourists Australia," or
"Village for Australian Tourists."</TE>
<TE>   Many Aussies love vacationing in Bali so much that they consider
the island their own backyard.</TE>
<TE>   Now, most seem unable to leave fast enough. They suffered the most
casualties in the bombing. Many bodies still lie in the morgue,
unidentified and unable to go home.</TE>
<TE>   And more and more foreign tourists are heeding the calls of their
governments to abandon Bali for fear of more attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Even as Saturday's memorial ceremony continued past midnight,
rumors of bomb threats at nearby hotels sent people scurrying. Real
or not, the threats signaled that Bali's holiday from the world's
troubles is over. Nobody here feels safe anymore.</TE>
<TE>   "As long as they don't find the suspects, tourists will never
believe in Bali again," Sandi said.</TE>
<TE>   But the young people keep on hoping and praying, to their separate
gods, for peace and prosperity to return.</TE>
<TE>   A few steps from the bomb site, at the foot of a mountain of
flowers, a promise is made by the folks from the land down under,
signed by Annie, Baggio, Kiarney and Shada, from the central coast of
Australia:</TE>
<TE>   "We will be back next year and will never stop visiting Bali."</TE>

<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>NABLUS, West Bank</DL>
<LD>Israeli troops and police scuffled with hundreds of Jewish settlers
near Nablus on Saturday as they made good on a government promise to
dismantle about 20 rogue hilltop settlements in the West Bank.</LD>
<LD>   Israeli troops also arrested at least eight suspected Palestinian
militants in a sweep of the Nablus area, and four soldiers were
injured when they blew up a door to one suspect's house. The eight
Palestinians belong to Yasser Arafat's Fatah faction or the militant
Islamic group Hamas, the army and Palestinian witnesses said.</LD>
<LD>   Hundreds of police and soldiers faced off against the Jewish
settlers, some of whom had rifles slung over their shoulders, as they
followed Defense Ministry orders to dismantle the Havat Gilad
outpost.</LD>
<TE>   Several settlers climbed onto the roof of one structure to prevent
it being demolished by a bulldozer, but were thrown down by police.
Thirty people, including soldiers and police, were injured, said
Israel Radio, whose reporter estimated that 1,000 settlers were at
the site.</TE>

<HD>Military Is Easing Its War on Drugs</HD>
<DH>The Pentagon wants to scale back the $1-billion program and
focus more on combating terrorism. Such a move could meet strong
opposition in Congress.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Paul Richter</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Citing the need to redirect resources to the war on terrorism, the
Pentagon has quietly decided to scale back its effort to combat
international drug trafficking, a central element of the national
"war on drugs" for 14 years.</LD>
<LD>   Officials are still weighing how exactly to pare the
$1-billion-a-year program, but they want to reduce deployment of
special operations troops on counter-narcotics missions and cut back
the military's training of anti-drug police and soldiers in the U.S.
and abroad. And they want to use intelligence-gathering equipment now
devoted to counter-drug work for counter-terrorism as well.</LD>
<LD>   But the military's counter-narcotics effort is highly popular
among some on Capitol Hill, where the retrenchment plans could run
into trouble. The plans have not yet been spelled out for lawmakers;
however, Defense Department memos and interviews with current and
former officials make the Pentagon's intentions clear.</LD>
<TE>   Congress ordered a reluctant Pentagon to enter the drug war in
1988, when surging cocaine traffic from South America sparked a sense
of crisis in the U.S. and set off calls for stronger measures to
fight drugs.</TE>
<TE>   "We should not be relaxing our efforts in the war on drugs," said
Rep. Porter J. Goss (R-Fla.), chairman of the House Select Committee
on Intelligence and an advocate for the effort. "Terrorism is the
highest priority, but drugs are still insidious.... Every time
[military officials] bleed off assets, it just opens up the drug
corridors again."</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps because of such sensitivities, the Pentagon's plans have
been couched in indirect terms. They were signaled this summer in a
memo from Deputy Defense Secretary Paul D. Wolfowitz and distributed
to senior uniformed and civilian officials.</TE>
<TE>   He said the department had "carefully reviewed its existing
counter-narcotics policy" because of "the changed national security
environment, the corresponding shift in the department's budget and
other priorities, and evolving support requirements." The Pentagon
will now focus its counter-narcotics activities on programs that,
among other things, "contribute to the war on terrorism," he added.</TE>
<TE>   But even before the Sept. 11 attacks, senior officials including
Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld had bluntly stated their lack of
enthusiasm for the anti-drug mission, which they contend is better
handled by civilian agencies.</TE>
<TE>   Before becoming secretary, Rumsfeld described military efforts to
stop drugs as "nonsense" and said during his Senate confirmation
hearing in January 2001 that drugs were "overwhelmingly a demand
problem," meaning the problem can be solved only when Americans quit
using them.</TE>
<TE>   Thus, some experts believe that the Defense Department may be
taking advantage of the war on terrorism to scale back a mission they
never wanted.</TE>
<TE>   Lawmakers who support the Pentagon's anti-drug mission have been
worried for some time by what they view as signs that the Rumsfeld
team intends to scale back the effort.</TE>
<TE>   Early last year, top defense officials asked the Pentagon
comptroller to study whether to continue the counter-narcotics work
and other "nontraditional" missions. The study recommended paring the
program, former defense officials say. And some observers note that
Rumsfeld has not named a permanent assistant defense secretary for
special operations and low intensity conflict, who is supposed to
oversee the anti-drug program.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview, Pentagon counter-drug chief Andre Hollis
emphasized that the Pentagon wants to retain parts of the program
that have worked well but that all the pieces are being examined to
determine whether each "is still a priority mission.... The top
priorities now are to defend the homeland and to win the war on
terrorism."</TE>
<TE>   Programs Multiplied</TE>
<TE>   Over the years, Hollis said, the counter-narcotics mission has
multiplied into 179 separate sub-programs, a number he called
"surreal." He said his first assignment when he came to the job in
August 2001 was to conduct a "bottom-up review" that would
distinguish what the Pentagon does well in counter-narcotics from
"what we shouldn't be doing, or that didn't need to be done any
more."</TE>
<TE>   In particular, Hollis said, the Defense Department wants to reduce
the burden on special operations forces, which are relatively few in
number and in heavy demand for terrorism-related missions.</TE>
<TE>   And when possible, he said, the department wants to double up on
the use of intelligence gathering equipment. If, for instance, a
National Guard helicopter is flying along the California-Mexico
border "looking for drug activity, there's no reason why they can't
also be looking for terrorists," he said.</TE>
<TE>   But a former senior defense official, who requested anonymity,
said the counter-drug operations would inevitably get short shrift if
forced to share equipment with anti-terrorism operations.</TE>
<TE>   The Pentagon spent about $1 billion on drug-related operations in
fiscal 2002, out of a total federal counter-narcotics outlay of $19
billion. The Pentagon has a bigger anti-drug budget than the Coast
Guard, Customs Service or the Immigration and Naturalization Service,
and accounts for a significant share of federal money spent to fight
drugs abroad.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the Pentagon's anti-drug efforts are in the Western
Hemisphere, notably the Andean region, Central America and the
Caribbean. Its efforts in Mexico are more limited. The military also
offers training and gathers intelligence in Southeast Asia, notably
Thailand.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to facing trouble in Congress, the cutbacks could be
unpopular with some Latin American governments. Most countries in the
hemisphere have taken advantage of training programs the Pentagon has
offered.</TE>
<TE>   Colombia: Special Case</TE>
<TE>   While it retrenches elsewhere, the Pentagon intends to continue
its growing effort in Colombia, where U.S. military trainers and
intelligence personnel have been helping a weak government wage a
four-decade war with drug-dealing rebels. The Bush administration
regards Colombia as a special case where danger from guerrilla groups
involved in drug trafficking could destabilize the region and
threaten the United States.</TE>
<TE>   In its drug-interdiction role, the military acts as the lead U.S.
agency for gathering intelligence on drug trafficking, and uses an
array of aircraft, ships, radar and other eavesdropping tools.</TE>
<TE>   Although barred from conducting drug raids directly, troops
provide some real-time technical help -- such as communications and
intelligence analysis -- during anti-narcotics operations being
carried out by law enforcement and foreign military organizations.</TE>
<TE>   Highly skilled special operations troops and other military
personnel also train foreign police and soldiers, as well as U.S. law
enforcement personnel. They teach everything from basic infantry
skills to languages, first aid, boat handling, swimming and
horsemanship.</TE>
<TE>   Hollis said these duties could be scaled back. For example, he
said, if Special Forces are training U.S. customs officials in
horseback riding, customs should now turn to local ranchers for that.
And if the Border Patrol is learning swimming from Special Forces,
"they'll have to go to the local YMCA."</TE>
<TE>   One high-profile anti-drug operation that may see changes is Joint
Task Force 6, based at Fort Bliss, Texas.</TE>
<TE>   The task force conducts counter-drug reconnaissance missions on
the Mexican border and provides military training and technical
services for local, state and federal civilian agencies. It has
provided training and other help for 430 civilian agencies, in such
areas as intelligence analysis, language, canine training and
marksmanship.</TE>
<TE>   The task force has been asked to review its programs in light of
Wolfowitz's memo. Hollis said reports that the task force "is going
to go away ... are just rumors," but he added that although "people
are generally anxious about change, 9/11 changed everything for us.
We need to look at the collective good."</TE>
<TE>   The military's counter-narcotics efforts have not exactly "won"
the drug war, some experts note. The price and supply of cocaine, for
example, have been relatively stable since 1989.</TE>
<TE>   "They're certainly working at the margins in making a difference,"
said Peter Reuter, a University of Maryland economist and former
director of Rand Corp.'s Drug Policy Research Center.</TE>
<TE>   Liberal critics have argued that by training foreign police and
soldiers, the U.S. military has in some cases given new tools to
brutal regimes that often abuse human rights.</TE>
<TE>   Yet the Pentagon's work has led to important drug seizures and
arrests, and has helped build U.S. ties and open doors for American
military access in many countries. Advocates maintain that it has
also helped spread U.S. values overseas, by teaching foreign
militaries the idea of civilian control.</TE>
<TE>   The former defense official said that easing the counter-drug
duties of the Special Forces "sort of makes sense." But he said the
benefit would be small, because only 200 to 250 Special Forces
personnel are used in Latin American counter-drug operations at any
one time.</TE>
<TE>   The ex-official said 7th Special Forces Group soldiers used in
Latin America are regional specialists who are well-suited to the
assignment and would have limited value if transferred to the Middle
East or South Asia.</TE>
<TE>   Changes in 2004 Budget</TE>
<TE>   The key unanswered question about the shift in plans, the
ex-official added, is how much the administration intends to trim
from Pentagon anti-drug spending in the upcoming fiscal 2004 budget,
and whether officials plan to shift to other areas the
intelligence-gathering ships and planes that have been the backbone
of the mission.</TE>
<TE>   Pentagon counter-drug officials have had to struggle to hang on to
intelligence-gathering planes, such as Navy P-3s and AWACS
surveillance aircraft, which the Joint Chiefs have frequently
diverted to missions considered priorities.</TE>
<TE>   Officials of Southern Command, which oversees the Latin American
mission, acknowledge that they are able to monitor only 15% of the
drug trafficking corridors about 15% of the time.</TE>
<TE>   Top defense officials are expected to work out the details of the
shift in counter-drug priorities in the next few weeks.</TE>

<DL>MANILA</DL>
<LD>Bomb-sniffing dogs patrolled rail station entrances and Philippine
police randomly searched vehicles as officials stepped up security
Saturday, a day after two people on a suburban Manila bus were killed
in the fourth of a recent series of terrorist blasts.</LD>
<LD>   President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo appealed for calm in a national
radio and television address, saying the Philippines wouldn't be
bullied by terrorists.</LD>
<LD>   Arroyo's office announced stricter security measures, including
random checks of vehicles, malls and other public places, and the
deployment of 1,700 police trainees.</LD>
<TE>   The national police chief, Hermogenes Ebdane, said investigators
are trying to reassemble the device used in the bus blast. A cell
phone was being tested for traces of nitrates.</TE>
<TE>   According to police intelligence chief Rodolfo Delfin, passengers
said that just before the blast a woman and a man got off the bus and
a cell phone rang. Authorities have a sketch of a man in his 20s
described as a "potential suspect," Ebdane said. No one has claimed
responsibility.</TE>
<TE>   Officials announced one success Saturday: the arrest of a leader
of the Muslim extremist group Abu Sayyaf who allegedly was involved
in the kidnappings of Western tourists from the Sipadan diving resort
in neighboring Malaysia two years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Mark Bolkerin Gumbahale, 21, also allegedly colluded with
Indonesians linked to Jemaah Islamiah, a Southeast Asian Muslim group
suspected of ties to Al Qaeda, in a wave of bombings in Manila on
Dec. 30, 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Gumbahale, also known as Abu Pula and Dr. Abu, was arrested
Thursday in the Manila suburb of Taguig, police said.</TE>

<DH>China's embrace of capitalism is making it the factory
floor to the world, posing a serious challenge to the U.S. economy.</DH>
<SE>First of three parts</SE>
<AU>Evelyn Iritani and Marla Dickerson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL>ONGGUAN, China</DL>
<LD>Ten years ago, this southern Chinese city was little more than
vegetable farms and rice paddies. Today it is a teeming, smoggy
monument to manufacturing. More than 4 million workers toil in 22,000
factories, churning out everything from patio chairs to power tools.</LD>
<LD>   Rows of industrial buildings the size of airplane hangars stretch
on for miles. Uniformed workers spill out of factory dormitories
before dawn, stopping for a quick bite of porridge before heading to
the assembly lines. Container trucks zip along modern superhighways
to high-tech ports, where cargo is loaded around the clock onto ships
bound for Los Angeles, Tokyo and Rotterdam.</LD>
<LD>   Poor and isolated 30 years ago, China is emerging as the world's
factory floor. The country's embrace of capitalism, coupled with an
abundance of cheap labor, massive foreign investment and the collapse
of international trade barriers, has sparked an explosion of
manufacturing. The reverberations are being felt around the globe.</LD>
<TE>   Shopping for a pair of shoes? Chances are that nimble Chinese
hands sewed them, along with nearly 80% of the footwear purchased in
the United States. That French provincial bedroom set on the showroom
floor? It's probably part of the $4.6 billion in furniture that China
shipped to the United States last year.</TE>
<TE>   Computers? Factories here in Dongguan, 50 miles north of Hong
Kong, produced 37% of the world's disk drives and 10% of its computer
monitors last year -- not to mention tens of millions of scanners,
printers and DVD players.</TE>
<TE>   Though many of China's exports are familiar Western brands, made
in factories owned or run by foreigners, home-grown Chinese
enterprises are making refrigerators, microwave ovens and
high-definition televisions for customers worldwide.</TE>
<TE>   "They're going to be a force to be reckoned with," entrepreneur
George Thomas said of the Chinese. Thomas heads an Illinois company
that makes computer networking equipment. He recently moved his
manufacturing operation to the Chinese city of Suzhou to take
advantage of low wages, tax breaks and inexpensive supplies.</TE>
<TE>   "They're going to drive standards," he said. "They're going to
drive everything."</TE>
<TE>   China is not the first developing country to become a center for
low-cost production. But the speed and scale of its emergence set it
apart. Until recently a minor player in the world economy, China now
is the sixth-largest trading nation. Experts predict that it will
rank second by the end of the decade, ahead of Germany and Japan and
behind only the United States.</TE>
<TE>   "The pace of China's industrial development and trade expansion is
unparalleled in modern economic history," said Nicholas Lardy, a
China expert at the Brookings Institution in Washington and author of
several books on the Chinese economy. "While this has led to
unprecedented improvements in Chinese incomes and living standards,
it also poses challenges for other countries."</TE>
<TE>   Despite its spectacular progress in recent years, China remains an
impoverished country: Two-thirds of its people live on less than $1 a
day. Its industries remain far behind their U.S. counterparts in
technology, innovation, managerial expertise and marketing know-how.</TE>
<TE>   But international economists say China is advancing steadily and
eventually will compete with U.S. companies in making complex,
high-value products such as aircraft and semiconductors. Whether this
is to be encouraged or feared is a source of growing debate.</TE>
<TE>   Some security experts, business leaders and members of Congress
say that an economically powerful China will become a political and
military rival. It is worrisome, they say, that an authoritarian
country with a history of contentious relations with the U.S. has
become a key source of all kinds of manufactured goods. If a
political upheaval or a diplomatic dispute interrupted those
supplies, the U.S. economy would suffer.</TE>
<TE>   This vulnerability was underscored recently when a labor dispute
shut West Coast ports, interrupting the flow of computer parts,
Christmas toys and other products from China.</TE>
<TE>   The skeptics would like to see China's rise slowed and its access
to advanced U.S. technology limited.</TE>
<TE>   "The economic growth of China is at least as potent a threat to
U.S. security as the actual military power," said June Teufel Dreyer,
a China specialist at the University of Miami. "Obviously, a strong
economy can field a stronger military."</TE>
<TE>   Advocates of free trade with China, who include President Bush,
contend that economic engagement is the best way to foster a stable,
prosperous China capable of buying U.S. airplanes, wheat and
pharmaceuticals.</TE>
<TE>   "The key is not to try to hold China back, because that in the
long run is an exercise in futility and it's a political mistake. It
breeds an enormous amount of resentment," said William Reinsch, a
former top Commerce Department official who is president of the
National Foreign Trade Council in Washington. "What makes more sense
is to run faster because we can. We're an entrepreneurial society."</TE>
<TE>   40 Cents an Hour</TE>
<TE>   China's low wages have been the main catalyst for its
manufacturing boom. The population of 1.3 billion, the world's
largest, provides an almost inexhaustible supply of low-cost labor.
The average factory wage is about 40 cents an hour -- one-sixth that
of Mexico and one-fortieth what U.S. factory workers are paid.</TE>
<TE>   China's total trade -- imports and exports -- was $510 billion
last year, nearly 15 times greater than in 1980. Forty-one percent of
the exports went to the United States. China recently supplanted
Japan as the country with the largest trade surplus with the U.S.
Last year American purchases of Chinese goods were $83 billion
greater than Chinese purchases of U.S. products.</TE>
<TE>   Wal-Mart Stores Inc., the world's largest retailer, bought $14
billion in merchandise from China last year -- 13% of all U.S.
imports from the country. To be closer to its suppliers, the company
recently opened a worldwide purchasing center with 300 employees in
the southern city of Shenzhen.</TE>
<TE>   On U.S. shores, the torrent of Chinese merchandise has been both
bane and blessing.</TE>
<TE>   To the delight of budget-conscious shoppers, retailers have filled
their shelves with inexpensive Chinese-made goods, many of them
bearing such brand names as Black &amp; Decker, Stanley and Rubbermaid.
The low prices of these products have helped keep inflation in check
and bolstered the bottom line for many U.S. companies.</TE>
<TE>   Trade with China has created millions of jobs for U.S. lawyers,
marketers, shippers, truckers and others.</TE>
<TE>   The trade-off is in U.S. factory jobs. In one industry after
another -- clothing, furniture, light electronics -- domestic
manufacturers unable to match Chinese prices have gone out of
business or shifted production abroad. A recent study done for a
congressional panel found that at least 760,000 U.S. manufacturing
jobs have migrated to China since 1992.</TE>
<TE>   Scheu Manufacturing Co. of Rancho Cucamonga sells portable
industrial heaters. Until two years ago, it made all its products in
Southern California. Today, it imports two-thirds of them from China.
The change eliminated 130 seasonal jobs at Scheu.</TE>
<TE>   "We've always prided ourselves on being a low-cost producer,
because of the quality of our engineering," said Craig Scheu, a
principal in the family-owned business. "The next thing we knew, not
only were we not competitive, we weren't even in the ballpark. It's
stunning the prices they can do."</TE>
<TE>   China's emergence has been a mixed blessing for developing
countries as well. Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore and the Philippines
have lost thousands of jobs, in some cases entire industries, as
production has moved to the Chinese mainland.</TE>
<TE>   Mexican factories that once supplied the United States with golf
clubs, blue jeans, door locks and other products have closed by the
thousands over the last two years as China has taken their business.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, China's purchases of raw materials and equipment
to power its export sector have bolstered Asian economies weakened by
the slowdown in the U.S. and Europe.</TE>
<TE>   The struggle for control of the U.S. bicycle market illustrates
China's raw manufacturing muscle.</TE>
<TE>   As recently as the mid-1990s, more than half the bicycles sold in
the United States were made in U.S. factories. Manufacturers had
survived low-cost competition from Taiwan, Japan and South Korea.</TE>
<TE>   Then bicycle makers moved their assembly lines to China.</TE>
<TE>   "Within a couple of years you had [factories in] what had been
dirt fields churning out a half-million bicycles [each]," said
Michael Kershow, a Washington attorney who represented major U.S.
manufacturers in a failed attempt to secure trade protection.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. companies could not match the Chinese prices. Chinese imports
now dominate the market, accounting for nearly 85% of the 16.8
million bicycles sold in the U.S. last year. The share of U.S.-made
models has dropped to 2%. Venerable American brands such as Huffy and
Schwinn now are made abroad.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. bicycle industry lost an estimated 8,000 manufacturing
jobs. Asian countries that saw their shares of the American market
shrink also lost jobs. But U.S. consumers saved billions of dollars
as the average price of bicycles sold through mass retailers such as
Wal-Mart dropped from more than $100 to $77.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know how [Chinese manufacturers] deliver a ridable
bicycle for 70 bucks, but they do," said Fred Clements, executive
director of the National Bicycle Dealers Assn., a trade group with
headquarters in Costa Mesa. "The low-end bikes are as good as they
were when they were made in the United States. Only the prices have
dropped."</TE>
<TE>   Opening the Market</TE>
<TE>   China's rise was made possible by a convergence of political and
economic forces. Under Deng Xiaoping, China's Communist leaders began
dismantling the centrally controlled economy and encouraging private
enterprise in the late 1970s. The move toward a free market
accelerated in the late 1980s as the Soviet Union teetered toward
collapse.</TE>
<TE>   China entered the global economy just as trade barriers were
falling around the world and the Internet was making it easier to do
business across borders. Like their Asian neighbors, China's leaders
promoted exports as a way to spur economic growth. They also wanted
to create jobs for a vast peasant population.</TE>
<TE>   But in contrast to Japan, China welcomed foreign investors,
particularly overseas Chinese. Entrepreneurs from Hong Kong and
Taiwan whose families had fled the Communists decades earlier led the
way in moving production to the mainland, making cheap clothing and
plastic toys.</TE>
<TE>   As other outsiders set up factories, the trickle of low-margin
export goods turned into a flood of increasingly sophisticated
products.</TE>
<TE>   Multinational companies had been chasing cheap labor around the
globe for decades. But the outcome was more impressive in China, for
a variety of reasons.</TE>
<TE>   Foreign firms, eager to establish a presence in China, brought
valuable technology and built some of the world's most modern and
efficient factories. The Communist regime provided tax breaks, cheap
land and other inducements and spent billions of dollars on highways,
ports, fiber-optic networks and other infrastructure.</TE>
<TE>   At first, foreigners were required to take on a Chinese partner to
share the wealth. They were free to export their products, but the
government severely limited what they could sell in China to protect
domestic companies. The regime also tightly restricted foreign
investment in key industries such as autos, steel and
telecommunications.</TE>
<TE>   Those restrictions gradually were eased. To qualify for entry to
the World Trade Organization last year, Beijing agreed to open its
economy still further.</TE>
<TE>   The growing concentration of manufacturers and suppliers became a
spur to further development. China developed into a place for
one-stop shopping, where companies could obtain everything from raw
materials to packaging and get their products to customers in record
time.</TE>
<TE>   The potential to sell their products to Chinese consumers and
industries, as well as to export them, was another powerful incentive
for foreign companies to invest in China. Wal-Mart, in addition to
stocking its U.S. stores with Chinese goods, operates 15 stores in
China and plans to open more.</TE>
<TE>   The country's middle class, though just a sliver of the
population, is estimated at more than 100 million and is growing
rapidly. Even now, China buys more cell phones than any other
country. Its expanding industrial sector is becoming a major buyer of
raw materials, machinery and high-tech equipment.</TE>
<TE>   China faces formidable barriers to further development. Its
financial markets are small and poorly regulated. The closure of
unprofitable state-owned companies has put millions of people out of
work and left the country's banks with massive debts. Government and
judicial institutions are rife with cronyism and corruption.</TE>
<TE>   Yet the industrial transformation of recent years is nothing short
of startling.</TE>
<TE>   The Pearl River Delta in southern China is a center of the
manufacturing explosion, producing ceiling fans, lightbulbs, pianos
and other products by the container load. In less than a decade,
farmland has been overrun by concrete, steel and smokestacks across
an area five times the size of Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Dongguan, Shenzhen and Guangzhou (formerly Canton) have been
transformed into giant industrial zones, linked to Hong Kong, the
region's major port, by expressways more modern and less congested
than those in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Dongguan, which is divided into 32 districts, each specializing in
its own slice of the global industrial pie, has become one of the
country's wealthiest cities. Giant factories bearing names such as
Nokia and Sony sit side by side with luxury housing developments for
Chinese entrepreneurs and foreign managers.</TE>
<TE>   "What is happening is a huge, unprecedented shift of trade flow
from ... other places into China," said Craig Pepples, chief
operating officer of Global Sources Ltd., an online trading network
based in Hong Kong that matches suppliers in Asia with customers
around the world.</TE>
<TE>   Chinese suppliers now represent 34% of Global Sources' business, a
level twice as high as three years ago. "It's really quite shocking,"
Pepples said. "You see the export figures in Taiwan and Hong Kong,
which have dropped in double digits, while China is increasing even
in a bad economy."</TE>
<TE>   Doubts Dispelled</TE>
<TE>   George Thomas, the Illinois entrepreneur, can attest to the
advantages of manufacturing in China. His 40-employee company,
Contemporary Controls, in Downers Grove, Ill., near Chicago, makes
computer networking equipment used to automate factories.</TE>
<TE>   Thomas, 58, became interested in China several years ago after
getting orders from factory managers there. He was buying most of his
components from China because prices were so low. After attending
several trade shows in China, he realized there was strong demand for
his products in that country and that he could make them much more
cheaply there.</TE>
<TE>   Thomas did the math. Production workers were paid $1 an hour in
China and $12 an hour in Illinois. Factory lease: $2 per square foot
in China, $8.50 in Illinois. Once in China, the company would be
close to its suppliers and no longer would have to pay to ship
components across the globe.</TE>
<TE>   Yet Thomas had doubts about whether Chinese workers could meet his
standards for quality. As a test, he sent a Chinese factory
instructions for making a piece of customized networking equipment.
Within days, he had a sample that worked flawlessly.</TE>
<TE>   "I was fairly flabbergasted," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Contemporary Controls began looking for a location in China and
found one in Suzhou, an ancient city of canals and exquisite formal
gardens near Shanghai that has become one of China's busiest
manufacturing zones. The company agreed to spend $200,000 on a
production facility and began operations last summer, with 13 Chinese
employees.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to low labor costs, Suzhou offered a two-year tax
holiday, cheap real estate and a ready network of suppliers and
customers.</TE>
<TE>   Contemporary Controls can buy just about everything it needs
within a 20-mile radius. Semiconductors are the one component it must
import; the chips now made in China are not sophisticated enough. But
some of the world's leading chip makers, including Fairchild
Semiconductor International Inc., are opening factories in China and
the company hopes to be able to buy all its chips locally within a
few years.</TE>
<TE>   Thomas expects difficulties operating in China, given the horror
stories he has heard about customs delays, unreliable suppliers,
corrupt officials and theft of designs and techniques.</TE>
<TE>   But he is optimistic, because his customers are factories and
China is building more of them than any other country. Thomas plans
to keep his 28 U.S. workers busy with research and development,
design work and manufacturing for the U.S. market. The Suzhou
facility will supply the rapidly growing Asian market.</TE>
<TE>   Moving Up a Level</TE>
<TE>   Beijing's leaders know that being the cheapest assembly line in
the world will not keep their people fed forever; too many other
countries are vying to fill the same role. So China is working hard
to reach the next level of industrial sophistication.</TE>
<TE>   This will require more than foreign money and technology. Though
its factories excel at producing foreign-designed goods, China has
yet to develop a cadre of industrial innovators comparable to those
in the U.S., Japan or Germany. Its ranks of skilled managers are
thin, its command of marketing weak.</TE>
<TE>   The result is that though the Chinese can make high-quality cars
for Volkswagen, Toyota and General Motors, they have yet to develop a
model of their own with a recognizable brand and an international
market.</TE>
<TE>   Chinese officials are striving to change that. They are trying to
develop their own global brands in electronics, home appliances and
personal computers -- Chinese versions of Sony, General Electric and
Dell. Some of these products -- Legend computers, Haier refrigerators
and Konka televisions -- already are well-established in developing
countries and are making inroads in the U.S. and other industrialized
nations.</TE>
<TE>   The government also is spending heavily to develop the highly
sophisticated industries that could propel China into the first rank
of economic powers -- aerospace, semiconductors and biotechnology.</TE>
<TE>   China has built dozens of high-tech research centers, mounted a
campaign to lure ethnic Chinese scientists living abroad and
overhauled its higher-education system, with a focus on training
first-rate scientists and engineers.</TE>
<TE>   Gary Hufbauer, a senior fellow at the Institute for International
Economics in Washington, said he would not be surprised if Chinese
workers were assembling commercial aircraft within a decade.</TE>
<TE>   China's move into industries traditionally dominated by the U.S.
will lead to greater tension, much as Japan's economic ascent did in
the 1980s.</TE>
<TE>   "China will become more prosperous and we will have more trade
battles," Hufbauer said. "But they will be battles of prosperity."</TE>

<LD>FURNITURE</LD>
<LD>   Ethan Allen's chief is stressing personal service in the company's
U.S. stores and plans to open branches in China's biggest cities.</LD>
<LD>   After watching low-cost Chinese imports devastate much of his U.S.
competition, Farooq Kathwari has launched what he calls a reinvention
of his company, 70-year-old furniture retailer Ethan Allen Interiors
Inc.</LD>
<TE>   Kathwari, 58, chairman and chief executive, is stepping up the
personal service in his gallery stores. To reduce costs, he has cut
jobs at his three sawmills and 17 U.S. manufacturing plants and is
importing more medium-priced furniture from China.</TE>
<TE>   Finding a way to distinguish the Ethan Allen brand will be
critical, because so many U.S. retailers now buy their goods from the
same Chinese suppliers, said Kathwari, whose privately held firm is
based in Danbury, Conn.</TE>
<TE>   "China is going to equalize a lot of people by providing good
value for the same price," he said. "Now you've got to decide on what
basis you're going to compete. Price is no longer a competitive
advantage."</TE>
<TE>   In addition to adjusting his strategy in the U.S., Kathwari is
preparing to market the American lifestyle to China's burgeoning
middle class. He is teaming up with Markor Co., one of China's
leading furniture manufacturers, to open Ethan Allen stores in
China's biggest cities.</TE>
<TE>   Kathwari, an immigrant from Kashmir, a disputed area between
Pakistan and India, has watched China remake itself since he first
started visiting that country in the 1970s as a textile importer.</TE>
<TE>   Now, he believes, U.S. businesses will have to do the same as they
adjust to China's rising economic power.</TE>
<TE>   "The natural process of rise and fall of empires always takes
place," he said. "Reinvention is an element to stop that decay. Now,
does the U.S. reinvent itself or go the way of great powers?"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   RETAILING</TE>
<TE>   The head of All American Home Center in Downey has watched China
come to dominate entire categories of consumer products.</TE>
<TE>   Greg Fuller has never been to China. But the CEO of All American
Home Center can see its influence in his store in Downey.</TE>
<TE>   Striding the bright, well-stocked aisles, he points to the "Made
in China" label on small appliances, hardware, patio furniture,
coolers, swimming pool supplies and ceiling fans. The veteran
retailer has watched China come to dominate entire categories of
consumer goods.</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't always so.</TE>
<TE>   All American was founded in 1959 by the late Irving Gertler, a
Eastern European immigrant who so loved his adopted homeland that he
gave his store a patriotic name and filled his shelves with
American-made products.</TE>
<TE>   A buyer for All American in the 1980s, Fuller recalls a failed
attempt to persuade Gertler to stock a bargain-priced Chinese tool
set. The handle of a screwdriver nearly came off in the boss' hand,
much to Fuller's chagrin.</TE>
<TE>   Today, 50% to 70% of the goods on All American's shelves are
imports, many of them made in China by U.S. firms. "The brands, the
packaging are so Americanized that most people don't realize this
stuff isn't made in the United States," Fuller said. "And most of
them don't care as long as it comes with a warranty."</TE>
<TE>   Fuller said the rise of giant discounters such as Home Depot and
Wal-Mart has reordered the retail universe and lent impetus to the
manufacturing boom in China and other developing countries. The big
chains, he said, exert powerful pressure on their suppliers to keep
prices low. That leads manufacturers to seek the cheapest sources of
production, wherever they may be.</TE>
<TE>   Fuller doesn't spend a lot of time pondering whether that is good
or bad. He's too busy trying to keep All American competitive with
the big guys.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not driving this train," he said of the family-owned store.
"We're just riding on it."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   COLLECTIBLES</TE>
<TE>   Chi Van of Ontario says China's tax incentives and low-cost labor
and land helped him expand his figurine business</TE>
<TE>   Some U.S. companies blame China for stealing their business. Chi
Van of Ontario, a maker of figurines and gift items, says China has
helped him expand his company.</TE>
<TE>   Born in Vietnam, Van worked in his family's picture-frame business
in Hong Kong before immigrating to the U.S. in the early 1980s. His
"eureka" moment came in 1989 at the Orange County Fair, where he saw
shoppers snapping up miniature cows, pigs and chickens at a craft
stall.</TE>
<TE>   "People just loved them," Van said. "I was inspired."</TE>
<TE>   Van opened a factory to manufacture collectibles in Southern
California. But success proved more elusive than he expected. He had
a hard time finding American workers willing to paint whiskers and
eyeballs on ceramic animals all day. Customers loved his products but
balked at his prices, which could reach $100 for the largest, most
labor-intensive pieces. Van realized he had to cut costs
dramatically.</TE>
<TE>   He found an open door in southeast China, where officials offered
cheap land, tax breaks, expedited paperwork and a ready supply of
low-wage factory hands.</TE>
<TE>   "We just put out a sign and they lined up at the front gate," Van
said. "There must have been 1,000 of them the first day."</TE>
<TE>   Today, Van Group employs 5,000 workers at four factories in China,
and its U.S. sales and distribution staff has grown to 300.</TE>
<TE>   The product line has moved far beyond the barnyard to include
collectibles from fairies to firefighters, as well as picture frames,
wind chimes, birdhouses and cookie jars. Items range in price from $8
to $300. Van credits a combination of American design and low-cost
Chinese manufacturing for his success.</TE>
<TE>   "People can make their homes look beautiful for an affordable
price," he said. "Without China, I don't know how we could maintain
... the [low] inflation we've all been enjoying for many years."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   TEXTILES</TE>
<TE>   With the influx of inexpensive, high quality goods from China,
U.F.N. Textile's David Glasberg worries about the future of the U.S.
garment trade.</TE>
<TE>   After the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, textile entrepreneur David
Glasberg of Vernon went into the American flag business. Within days,
his U.F.N. Textile Group Inc., which specializes in novel styles and
speedy production, was cranking out hundreds of thousands of
red-white-and-blue banners.</TE>
<TE>   For a couple of months, U.S. retailers snatched them up as fast as
Glasberg could make them. Then imported American flags began arriving
from China -- more than 100 million of them, according to government
trade data.</TE>
<TE>   "They were selling finished products cheaper than I could buy the
material," Glasberg said. "That was the end of that."</TE>
<TE>   It's a pattern that has Glasberg worried about the future of the
domestic garment trade. U.S. textile and apparel makers have battled
imports from around the globe for years. But China has quickly become
a source of low-cost, high-quality textile products that are proving
irresistible to U.S. buyers -- Glasberg included. He recently began
importing Chinese-made sheets and bedspreads.</TE>
<TE>   "Hey, if you can't beat them, join them," he said. "I've got to
make a living."</TE>
<TE>   Still, Glasberg is saddened by the decline in the local textile
industry. His firm, which once employed 60 people, is down to 15. He
said the hidden price for those cheap imported goods is U.S. factory
jobs. He fears Americans will wake up one day and realize they didn't
get such a bargain after all.</TE>
<TE>   "Even if a shirt only costs $1, how are you going to buy it if you
don't have a job?"</TE>

<HD>Trying to Understand Eddie's Life -- and Death</HD>
<DH>His loved ones grew to accept his sexuality. They can't
accept the silence after his killing.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tim Reiterman, Jessica Garrison and Christine Hanley</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL>NEWARK, Calif.</DL>
<LD>Stephanie, who still wears Eddie Araujo's friendship ring, bumped
into her childhood friend about three years ago. He was sporting his
new look: a cascade of black hair with red streaks, perfect makeup
and sculptured brows.</LD>
<LD>   Seeing him surprised her, but she didn't ask why he was dressed
like a girl. "I understood him so much," said the 17-year-old friend,
who did not want her last name used.</LD>
<LD>   Araujo's closest friends tried to understand. His mother tried to
understand. She even sensed something different about her son when he
was a child.</LD>
<TE>   So when the 17-year-old's beaten body was unearthed Wednesday from
a shallow grave in the Sierra foothills, his mother and friends said
they immediately suspected that prejudice had turned to murder.</TE>
<TE>   "This was my worst fear," said Araujo's mother, Sylvia Guerrero,
"that someone would kill him because they did not know he was a man."</TE>
<TE>   What she and others say they cannot understand is how the killing
could have been kept quiet so long.</TE>
<TE>   Michael Magidson, 22, of Fremont, and Jason Chase Nabors, 19, and
Jose Merel, 24, both of Newark, face murder charges with hate crime
enhancements, which could lengthen any sentence. A fourth man -- Paul
Merel Jr., 25, Jose's brother -- was arrested and released.
Authorities allege that the suspects had sex with Araujo and then
killed him after discovering he was male.</TE>
<TE>   Paul Merel, who is on probation for grand theft, said Saturday
that he met Araujo two months ago and that the teenager he knew as
Lida had been at his house several times since then. "I never saw
anything to indicate that she could possibly be a man," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Nabors led police to the grave, police said, and the body was
found wrapped in a sheet with hands and feet bound. Police said
Saturday that more arrests were possible.</TE>
<TE>   On Oct. 3. Araujo, who had told people to call him Gwen or Lida,
went to a party at the Merels' house, dressed in a denim miniskirt
and shirt.</TE>
<TE>   Paul Merel said he had planned to pick up Araujo at a nearby
school that night but that Araujo had not been there. Araujo
telephoned the Merel house and arrived later. Some of Merel's friends
came over, he said, and he tried to persuade Araujo to go home.</TE>
<TE>   "Lida didn't want to go home," he said. "She wanted to keep
drinking."</TE>
<TE>   He finally walked Araujo outside when Magidson, Jose Merel and
Nabors arrived. Paul Merel said he went to bed. "The next thing I
recall is waking up and hearing a commotion," he told The Times. "I
recall hearing someone say, 'She's a man.' "</TE>
<TE>   Records show that, through days of silence, about a dozen
partygoers at the Merel house never told authorities what they knew.</TE>
<TE>   Lt. Lance Morrison of the Newark Police Department said the
investigation unfolded "like a giant game of telephone" among a small
circle of teenagers and adults who either had attended the party or
heard about it later. "Every nugget of information we got tended to
reinforce that something very bad had happened," he said.</TE>
<TE>   A break in the case came when a friend of Nabors' agreed to wear a
concealed microphone and, during their conversation, Nabors indicated
that he was afraid.</TE>
<TE>   Nabors talked about how police wanted him to reveal what had
happened at the party, according to court records. "I'm not narking
on anybody," Nabors reportedly told his friend.</TE>
<TE>   When the friend told him not to worry, Nabors responded, "I have
to worry," the documents stated. When the friend said everything
would be OK, Nabors interrupted: "No, it ain't, dude. [The police
officer] knew everything, dude; he knew everything."</TE>
<TE>   During a later interview with police, Nabors said his friends Jose
Merel and Magidson might have had sex with the victim at the Oct. 3
party, court records show.</TE>
<TE>   Nicole Brown, Paul Merel's girlfriend, reportedly went into the
bathroom with Araujo and discovered that he was a boy. Paul Merel
told police he had heard Brown yell, "It's a man; let's go." Merel
said he heard a tussle and went to see what was happening. He
recounted finding Araujo lying on the floor, skirt partially pulled
up, exposing his underwear.</TE>
<TE>   Nabors described the attack to police, saying Jose Merel first
punched Araujo, according to court papers. When someone asked for a
knife, Nabors said, he volunteered his folding pocketknife.</TE>
<TE>   Jose Merel and Magidson dragged Araujo, who was semi-conscious,
into the garage, Nabors told police. The two men then tied a rope
around his neck until they believed he was dead, Nabors said. Later
they wrapped Araujo's body, put him in the back of Magidson's truck
and drove to a remote area near the Silver Forks campground where,
Nabors told police, he helped the others bury Araujo.</TE>
<TE>   "Someone was dumped like a piece of trash on the side of a
mountain," Lt. Morrison said. "I'm getting a sense that a lot of
people heard about it." At least five or six people heard enough
about what happened but didn't come forward, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Araujo's mother reported her son missing Oct. 5, telling police
she was worried, even though he sometimes stayed away from home.</TE>
<TE>   Police said the rumors spread quickly around Newark, a
13-square-mile town of 42,000 rooted in salt mining. The East Bay
city north of San Jose served mostly as a bedroom community for
blue-collar San Francisco airport and auto-plant workers before being
subsumed by Silicon Valley in the last two decades.</TE>
<TE>   Within days of Araujo's disappearance, his aunt, Imelda Guerrero,
recounted what she described as "fourth-hand rumors" to police: A
girl had had anal sex with at least one male and when "they found the
girl was in fact a male ... they killed him and buried him in Tahoe,"
according to court records.</TE>
<TE>   The three suspects were all known around town and had been high
school athletes.</TE>
<TE>   The Merels' home sits on a corner in a middle-class neighborhood,
within half a mile of the police station. Residents said officers
were often called there. Jose Merel works at a mattress warehouse and
has a daughter who lives out of state with her mother. Neighbors said
the brothers had a lot of visitors, mostly young men. Toward the end
of the summer, they said, the parties grew more frequent.</TE>
<TE>   Wanda Merel, who visited her son Jose and Magidson in jail
Saturday, said Jose had told her he had nothing to do with the
killing. She wanted to pass a message to Araujo's mother: "I'm sorry
for what happened to her son. I didn't raise my sons to do something
like this. But if my son did take part in this murder, then he's
where he's supposed to be."</TE>
<TE>   She said she doesn't think the slaying was a hate crime, adding
that whoever did it was "temporarily insane."</TE>
<TE>   "If you find out the beautiful woman you're with is really a man,
I think it would make any man go crazy," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Nabors attends community college, works at a restaurant and has a
10-month-old child with his girlfriend, court records show. Longtime
friend Miles Reece said Nabors is a responsible, bright kid who likes
trucks and rhythm and blues music. "It's kind of devastating," Reece
said. "You know him pretty well ... and now in the paper you see him
as a killer. I don't think he did it."</TE>
<TE>   Magidson, who lives in a middle-class Fremont neighborhood near
railroad tracks, attended Fremont Christian High School. As a
teenager, one neighbor said, he started hanging out with a different
crowd, getting tattoos and shaving his head.</TE>
<TE>   Araujo's mother said she had tried to understand the changes Eddie
was going through over the past several years. She does not use words
like "transgender" or "transsexual" to describe her son, the second
of four children.</TE>
<TE>   When Eddie was born, he was named after his father. His parents
divorced 10 months later. Guerrero said the father was never a part
of Eddie Jr.'s life.</TE>
<TE>   As a boy, Araujo played Little League, earned school awards and
loved to go fishing and camping. His mother said she had long sensed
he was different and believes he was born that way.</TE>
<TE>   "He felt feminine and never, never felt masculine," Guerrero said.
"I never understood what he felt. He came out three years ago and
still was confused. Being who he was was very painful. He felt like a
freak."</TE>
<TE>   She said she had supported him as best she could; his dressing
like a girl "took guts, especially in this town." After he told his
mother, who works as a legal assistant, that he wanted to live his
life as a woman, the two had many conversations about his sexual
identity -- seldom easy ones. He kept his sex life private, and she
said she never asked.</TE>
<TE>   "He felt like a girl trapped in a man's body," said his mother.
She too struggled, refusing to call him Gwen until he could have the
sex-change operation he wanted.</TE>
<TE>   Other boys teased and hassled Eddie at school, she said, calling
him names. He eventually dropped out after his attendance and grades
fell off.</TE>
<TE>   "He never liked school, because he never felt comfortable," she
said.</TE>
<TE>   He couldn't find a job, his mother believed, because his
appearance as a girl did not match the name on job applications.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Araujo had friends, both at school and in his neighborhood.
About 200 people attended a candlelight vigil in his memory Friday in
a park not far from his home. His friends, his mother said, were
Latino, black, white, boys, girls -- like an extended family.</TE>
<TE>   "He had a lot of girl friends," his mother said. "He did their
makeup. He wanted to go to cosmetology school and move to Hollywood
and be famous."</TE>
<TE>   Her son drank alcohol and went to a lot of parties, his mother
said.</TE>
<TE>   She had warned him about strangers. His friends told police he had
been drinking and had taken methamphetamines the afternoon of the
party, according to the affidavit.</TE>
<TE>   Struggles such as Araujo's are not uncommon, said Dr. Virginia
Erhardt, a psychologist and gender specialist.</TE>
<TE>   "These are people who believe they should have been born the other
sex," she said. "It's not that they are out of touch with reality
.... Inside their minds, they know what they really are, and that
doesn't match."</TE>
<TE>   The recognized treatment for "gender identity disorder" is
therapy, hormone pills and possibly a sexual change operation.
Erhardt said people who have gender identity disorder often suffer
from anxiety or depression and abuse alcohol or drugs.</TE>
<TE>   "They are uncomfortable in their own skin," she said. "They have
to cope with the disapproval of society. That's why a lot of other
issues arise."</TE>
<TE>   Shirley Bushnell, a member of the National Transgender Advocacy
Coalition, said the realization that your gender and your sex do not
match is terrible. "You feel like your body is betraying you," said
Bushnell, 53.</TE>

<KH>THE TIMES POLL</KH>
<HD>15% Identify as Gay or 'on Homosexual Side'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Larry B. Stammer</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The subject of gays in the priesthood has been hotly
debated throughout the sexual abuse scandal that has rocked the Catholic
Church in the U.S.</LD>
<LD>   Many Catholic traditionalists, including some bishops and Vatican
officials, have sought to blame gay priests for the scandal. On the
other side, many have said the church has increasingly come to depend
on gay men who have entered the priesthood in larger numbers in
recent years.</LD>
<LD>   Despite the debate, there has been little data on how many priests
actually are gay.</LD>
<TE>   The Times poll of priests asked respondents to characterize their
sexual orientation. A combined 15% identified themselves as
homosexual (9%) or "somewhere in between, but more on the homosexual
side" (6%).</TE>
<TE>   But among younger priests -- those ordained for 20 years or less
-- the figure was 23%.</TE>
<TE>   The figures, particularly for the younger priests, are higher than
most estimates of the percentage of U.S. gay men, but lower than some
estimates of the percentage of homosexuals in the priesthood, which
have ranged up to 50%.</TE>
<TE>   The figures bolster the idea that more gay men have entered the
priesthood in recent decades or at least that gay priests are now
more open about their sexuality.</TE>
<TE>   Five percent of respondents placed themselves "completely in the
middle" between heterosexuality and homosexuality, while 67%
identified themselves as exclusively heterosexual in orientation.
Eight percent referred to themselves as "mostly" heterosexual, and 5%
declined to answer the question.</TE>
<TE>   Asked whether a "homosexual subculture" -- defined as "a definite
group of persons that has its own friendships, social gatherings and
vocabulary" -- exists in their diocese or religious order, 44% said
"definitely" (17%) or "probably" (27%) yes, while 52% said no. Asked
if such a subculture existed at the seminary they attended, 26% said
"definitely" (12%) or "probably" (14%) yes, while 71% said no. But
53% of priests who were ordained in the last 20 years said such a
subculture existed in the seminary when they attended.</TE>
<TE>   Just as many traditionalists have blamed the sexual abuse scandal
on homosexuals in the priesthood, many liberals have blamed the
church's requirement that priests be celibate.</TE>
<TE>   The poll also asked priests about "the role that celibacy plays in
your life." One-third of those surveyed said they "do not waver" from
their vow of celibacy, while 47% described celibacy as "an ongoing
journey" and 14% said they "do not always succeed in following" it.
Two percent said they are not celibate, and 5% declined to answer the
question.</TE>
<TE>   Psychologists and other experts on sexuality generally say sexual
abuse of children is not connected to sexual orientation or celibacy.
Most offenders suffer from arrested psychosexual development and are
heterosexual, those experts say. But such views have done little to
discourage arguments in the church and the secular media about
celibacy or the renewed efforts by the Vatican to discourage the
ordination of homosexuals.</TE>
<TE>   The poll respondents were guaranteed anonymity, but results on the
sexuality questions could have been influenced by wariness of the
media and fears among gay priests that disclosing their sexual
orientation amid the current crisis would be ill-advised.</TE>
<TE>Catholic research groups periodically survey priests' views on many
subjects, but the church has never polled its priests about their
sexual orientation. Catholic researchers have said members of the
church heirarchy did not want the question asked.</TE>

<HD>Most Priests Say Bishops Mishandled Abuse Issue</HD>
<DH>Many believe that the U.S. church's charter, though
protective of children, is unfair to clerics, and many are angry at
prelates.</DH>
<SE>First of two parts</SE>
<AU>Larry B. Stammer</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two-thirds of the nation's Roman Catholic priests disapprove of the
way that U.S. bishops have handled sexual abuse allegations against
members of the clergy, a nationwide Los Angeles Times poll of the
priesthood has found.</LD>
<LD>   The findings of the poll, the most extensive nationwide opinion
survey of American priests since 1994, point to a pervasive and
deep-seated anger among many priests. Many are upset at the nation's
bishops. They are also, in many cases, angry at the news media.</LD>
<LD>   In written comments that many priests submitted with the poll
responses, they said bishops delayed dealing with the crisis in the
first place, then compounded the problem by adopting a
"zero-tolerance" policy, the Charter for the Protection of Children
and Young People, that denies accused clerics their rights to due
process.</LD>
<TE>   But the poll also found a bedrock of faith among priests,
happiness in their chosen vocation and a belief that the church will
come out of the crisis stronger.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, in their comments on the sexual abuse policy, which
the U.S. bishops approved in June, priests expressed many of the same
objections raised by Vatican officials. On Friday the Vatican
released a letter to the U.S. bishops saying some aspects of the
policy conflict with church law and need to be changed.</TE>
<TE>   Seventy-five percent of poll respondents said the charter has done
a "good" or "excellent" job of protecting minors from sexual abuse by
priests.</TE>
<TE>   "Probably at this point the safest place for any kid to be is in
the church," said Father Frank Jasper, a Franciscan priest and
psychotherapist in Indianapolis who agreed to a follow-up interview.</TE>
<TE>   Fifty-five percent said the charter would restore confidence in
the church.</TE>
<TE>   But only 34% rated the charter's fairness to priests accused of
abuse as "good" or "excellent," with 45% calling it "fair" or "poor"
in that regard.</TE>
<TE>   Like many other priests, Jasper, 56, who has been ordained for 29
years, said the charter was hastily put together under intense media
pressure and undermined the due-process rights of priests guaranteed
by the church's canon law.</TE>
<TE>   The sexual abuse scandal has resulted in an estimated 300 priests
nationwide being removed from ministry and an unprecedented official
apology from the church. The furor has taken a toll on the morale of
priests who have never been accused of sexual abuse, the survey
found.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel so badly for the innocent victims, but in a way, I feel
victimized by these sexual monsters because they, in a way, stole
from me some of the pride and joy I had as a priest," said one
California cleric.</TE>
<TE>   More than three out of five of those surveyed said they believed
that most or many of the allegations of sexual abuse of minors by
priests were true. More than half, 53%, said they think the church
has been too lenient in disciplining those accused of misconduct.</TE>
<TE>   Yet in addition to disappointment with the bishops, many priests
expressed anger at how the news media have covered cases of abuse.
Seventy-three percent of priests responding to the survey said the
news media had been "negative" in their treatment of the church.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm terribly disappointed," Father Eugene Burns of Chicago said
in a follow-up telephone interview.</TE>
<TE>   "I never saw anything about us who have borne the heat of the day
and have been good, faithful priests," said Burns, 74, who has been a
priest 47 years. "They threw mud at all of us. I used to enjoy our
national news, as well as local, but it was getting nauseating. So I
just shut it off."</TE>
<TE>   Many said they were outraged by the publication of unproven
allegations, particularly in cases involving alleged molestations
that occurred decades ago and in which there had been no indication
of further offenses.</TE>
<TE>   "Faithful laity seems to forgive our sins. The press seems to
delight in our sins," a priest from New Jersey wrote.</TE>
<TE>   Although there have been polls of rank-and-file Catholics and
Americans in general since the sexual abuse scandal erupted in
January in Boston and spread across the U.S., this poll marks the
first attempt to survey the views of priests.</TE>
<TE>   Catholic institutions have done some polls of the nation's roughly
45,000 active and retired priests in recent years, but the current
survey, conducted by the Los Angeles Times Poll, is the most
extensive opinion survey of U.S. priests since a similar Times poll
of priests and nuns conducted in 1993 and 1994.</TE>
<TE>   The latest poll surveyed 1,854 priests nationwide and has a margin
of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points. Priests were given an
opportunity to add written comments along with their answers. Some
also agreed to follow-up interviews with Times reporters.</TE>
<TE>   The poll found that overwhelmingly priests are happy with their
vocations (70% say they are "very satisfied" with their lives as
priests), approve of the way their local bishops manage their own
dioceses (76%), and expect that in the long run the church will
emerge from the crisis stronger and healthier.</TE>
<TE>   "At 85 years of age, I see the ship listing greatly but not ready
to sink," commented one person who responded to the poll. "God's
promises are too convincing for that. I'll stay on board with God's
help."</TE>
<TE>   Another said: "I believe the church will survive this scandal, as
it has for the last 2,000 years. Hopefully, it will emerge more pure,
more refined and more holy. I pray for that every day."</TE>
<TE>   But the priests also agreed that the current crisis is a serious
one. Asked if the sex abuse scandal was the worst crisis the church
in America has faced in a century, more than two-thirds said yes.</TE>
<TE>   None of the priests in their written comments sought to excuse or
minimize child abuse. As have U.S. bishops and Pope John Paul II,
they expressed agreement that there is no room in the priesthood for
those who would sexually abuse minors.</TE>
<TE>   "They should be removed from ministry, but not publicly," Burns
said. "They must know that nobody's above the law. It's their fault.
They're stupid. They must have known it was wrong. Certainly, God
wouldn't look the other way. They had to know what a horrible
disgrace. But the power of passion!"</TE>
<TE>   Others faulted the bishops for waiting so long to address the
issue of sexual abuse, which they began discussing at their national
meetings at least as early as 1985.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm very angry that no charges have been brought against" bishops
who failed to protect children from molesters, "and at the present
time it seems that no charges will ever be brought against them,"
wrote one Pennsylvania priest.</TE>
<TE>   "Heads have to roll in the episcopacy [bishops] before people are
going to be satisfied," commented a cleric from the northern Great
Plains.</TE>
<TE>   Wrote one Southern California priest: "I can't wait for a bishop
or cardinal to go to jail."</TE>
<TE>   About one-third of priests identified themselves as liberals in
matters of doctrine; roughly another third identified themselves as
conservatives. Both groups expressed criticisms of the bishops, but
liberals were more likely to criticize them than conservatives, 76%
versus 59%.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the same priests also said the rights of the accused, as
well as victims, must be honored. Many asked if Christian forgiveness
had also become a victim of the scandal, particularly in cases in
which a priest may have abused once decades ago and led an abuse-free
life with an effective ministry ever since.</TE>
<TE>   "The Dallas charter is so broad that it places most priests at
risk of an unjust accusation," wrote a cleric from upstate New York.
"An allegation is regarded as proved if it is merely credible."</TE>
<TE>   Some came to the defense of the bishops. "The church is taking
aggressive action to end these scandals. Please don't make its task
more difficult by trying to dictate how it should do its duty," wrote
one priest, adding that the church's "leaders, wisely, are looking
to, and praying to, God for help."</TE>
<TE>   Others, however, commented angrily on the fact that bishops are
not subject to the rule requiring abusers' removal from ministry and
the priesthood. Sixty-five percent said the charter did a fair to
poor job in providing for the discipline of bishops who cover up for
abusive priests.</TE>
<TE>   According to church law, only the pope can discipline a bishop.
Nonetheless, the anger of some priests was palpable.</TE>
<TE>   "In the end, the bishops have absolved themselves and will walk
away unscathed," wrote a priest from the New York City area. "Perhaps
corporate America is following the bishops' lead."</TE>

being a Catholic priest!"</TE>

ordained and could get free from the church. But, at this age and

hypocrite."</TE>
<TE>   Priest from the northern Great Plains</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "Most bishops and priests are good men -- sinful -- but trying to
do God's work: loving the people and the church. The one thing the
present crisis has given us is an opportunity for humility. All of
us."</TE>
<TE>   Midwestern priest</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "I grieve the loss of a certain moral voice the bishops rightly
had in challenging our culture to be better. This, next to the harm
inflicted on the abused children and families, is the greatest loss
suffered, and some bishops have only themselves to blame."</TE>

but now they put at social, spiritual and physical risk those of
different sexual orientation. Shame!"</TE>

<KH>THE TIMES POLL</KH>
<HD>How the National Survey Was Taken</HD>
<DH>Response rate among the 5,000 priests who were mailed the
questionnaire was 37%, considered statistically representative.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>This is the most extensive opinion survey of the nation's Catholic
priests since a Los Angeles Times poll of priests and nuns conducted
over several months in 1993 and 1994.</LD>
<LD>   Opinion surveys of the general population usually are conducted by
telephone, using random-digit dialing. For a small population such as
priests, however, that method is impractical.</LD>
<LD>   Instead, The Times Poll chose a sample of 5,000 active and retired
priests across the country in 80 dioceses and mailed surveys to them.
The packet included a cover letter promising that all results would
remain anonymous.</LD>
<TE>   The sample was designed to be geographically distributed in the
same way as the 45,382 priests who make up the total U.S. priest
population. Diocesan priests and those in religious orders were
included in proportion to their overall share of the total priest
population in each geographic area.</TE>
<TE>   Addresses and population counts were taken from directories of
dioceses and religious orders and from the Official Catholic
Directory published by P.J. Kennedy &amp; Sons.</TE>
<TE>   To achieve the largest possible return rate, the poll contacted
respondents four times, mailing questionnaires June 27 and July 25, a
reminder postcard Aug. 5, and a final set of questionnaire packets
Sept. 4. The end date of the survey was Oct. 11, giving it a 16-week
field period.</TE>
<TE>   The poll was criticized by some Catholic organizations that said
it asked inappropriate questions. Nonetheless, it achieved a response
rate of 37%, for a total of 1,854 respondents nationwide, which is
considered statistically representative.</TE>
<TE>   Response rates were acceptable in all the dioceses surveyed, and
ranged from 30% in some dioceses in the South to 44% in some parts of
the Midwest. The margin of error for the sample is plus or minus 3
percentage points.</TE>
<TE>   The sample of priests who responded to the survey slightly
over-represents active diocesan priests as compared with those who
belong to religious orders. It also slightly over-represents priests
in the South as compared with those in the East and Midwest. The
final results were adjusted slightly to account for the differences.</TE>
<TE>   Besides the survey questions, the poll invited respondents to
submit additional written comments. Some priests also agreed to speak
with reporters for follow-up interviews.</TE>
<TE>   In the written comments, some priests praised the survey. Others
criticized the wording of some of the 67 questions.</TE>
<TE>   The most common complaint was that some questions required a more
complicated answer than simply yes or no.</TE>
<TE>   Others suggested that certain items were designed to produce
responses that would embarrass the church.</TE>
<TE>   The survey was supervised by Los Angeles Times Poll Director Susan
Pinkus along with Associate Director Jill Darling Richardson and
Field Director Roger Richardson. Claudia Vaughn was the data
management supervisor, and Ray Enslow was the publications
coordinator.</TE>
<TE>   Further information on this study is available by writing to Los
Angeles Times Poll, 202 W. 1st St., Los Angeles, CA 90012-4105. In
addition, Times Poll data and question wording may be found online at

<HD>Giants Outlast Angels in a Game of Firsts</HD>
<DH>Barry Bonds homers in the World Series opener, and San
Francisco holds on. Still, Anaheim fans have faith in their team to
come back yet again.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Geoffrey Mohan and Kimi Yoshino</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>First blood in the war between the Californians was drawn by the San
Francisco Giants in a 4-3 victory Saturday night over the Anaheim
Angels that provided enough firsts to put sports shows into extra
innings.</LD>
<LD>   It was the first World Series game ever played in Anaheim, and the
first to feature two wild-card teams. And now the Angels have lost
the first game of each of the three postseason series they've played
this year.</LD>
<LD>   If that weren't enough firsts, slugger Barry Bonds made his first
appearance in a World Series, promptly launching a 2-1 pitch 418 feet
over the right-field wall in the second inning, to become the 26th
major leaguer to homer in his initial at-bat in the major leagues'
biggest show. Bonds' shot also might be the first home run to be
retrieved by an FBI agent.</LD>
<TE>   It was enough to get Super-Angel fans nervous early. Two fans from
Whittier who wore Batman and Superman outfits with big A's on the
chest, Gus Garcia, 20, and Mike Weaver, 21, didn't sit down and
seldom stopped.</TE>
<TE>   "We have seats, but it's kind of a superstitious kind of thing,"
Weaver said. "If we sit down, the Angels start to fall behind."</TE>
<TE>   After Bonds' home run, they cut the conversation short to wend
their way through a stadium packed with 44,603 fans. "That's OK,
we'll get back into it," Weaver said.</TE>
<TE>   Two batters later, though, Giant Reggie Sanders swatted a shot
into the center-field stands, right into the hands of a man dressed
in a Rally Monkey suit, who promptly threw the ball back, to
thunderous applause.</TE>
<TE>   Scott Parkin, 24, a season ticket holder from Laguna Niguel, spent
$215 for the outfit, which he wore in every playoff game. "I had
perfect vision, all the way from the bat to my glove," he said. "The
ball just landed directly in my glove. I was so excited to get it,
and then I realized it was a Giant ball.... I think it's worth more
that I threw it back."</TE>
<TE>   Parkin was being congratulated well into the Angels' half of the
inning, when Troy Glaus joined the first-at-bat homer club with a
solo shot. That put the score at 2-1, Giants, where it stayed for a
while.</TE>
<TE>   Thunder sticks, superstitious superheroes in tights and capes, men
with angel wings exchanging compliments like "Now, those are monkeys"
were all in a cool mid-autumn evening's madness, Orange County-style.</TE>
<TE>   Up in the worst seats possible, Andrew Wiggins, 25, and Jeff
Reenders settled into Section 540, Row 12, a bit surprised that their
$110 tickets didn't come with binoculars. Neither of them had any
idea what kind of view they had bought on the Internet until they got
to Edison International Field. "We had a suspicion, but we weren't
quite sure," Wiggins said. "I think maybe we are in the worst seats
in the stadium, but in my mind they're the best seats."</TE>
<TE>   After all, Wiggins noted, the aisle ended right at their seats,
giving them plenty of legroom and no one to step over to get beer.
"You do get a little dizzy, sitting up this high," Wiggins said. But
what a view they got of the fireworks, which exploded nearly at eye
level over center field.</TE>
<TE>   Kurt McFall, a 39-year-old Aliso Viejo contractor, got the best
parking spot -- a handicapped space only a few hundred feet from home
plate. But McFall had to arrive at 11 a.m. to get it. By game time,
piles of pistachio and peanut shells surrounded his white pickup,
where McFall sat in a lawn chair, munching away, posting two signs:
"I see red people," and "I need one ticket."</TE>
<TE>   A game regular who said his signs never fail to draw
ticket-sellers, McFall bought and re-sold three tickets during the
day before scoring a face-value seat well after Jackie Autry, widow
of team founder Gene Autry, had thrown out the first pitch. "Trust
me, I'd be here if I had to hop the fence," McFall said.</TE>
<TE>   About the only spectators clueless to the whole spectacle were
visiting Belgians Gerald Deschamps and Patrick Diels, two chefs on an
exchange program with Aramark, a catering company. Sure, it's a nice
game, they acknowledged politely, but you should taste the Flemish
stew we made for the stadium's Diamond Club!</TE>
<TE>   "We don't know anything about baseball," Deschamps said, when
asked whether he cared who wins. "I think John Travolta is here," he
added, excitedly. "I love his movies."</TE>
<TE>   By the sixth inning, the Giants added two more runs on another
homer, by ex-Angel J.T. Snow. Abused Giant fan Dave Bressoud, 41, of
Bakersfield, shouted at Angel fans: "Where's those thunder-clappers
now?"</TE>
<TE>   He was joined in the center-field club level by a gaggle of fellow
San Franciscans who said they had been pelted by ice, peanuts and
insults all during the game. "You've got a bunch of uneducated,
fair-weather fans," Bressoud complained. "They have ATSD, Attention
Thunder-Stick Disorder."</TE>
<TE>   Bressoud and his newfound friends chatted away about the 1989
World Series and the virtues of Pacific Bell Park over Edison Field.
A video clip on the outfield screen spliced a Rally Monkey into a
scene from Jurassic Park, followed by House of Pain's "Jump Around,"
the Rally Monkey's official theme song (penned by a Yankee fan).
Proto-primates in the stands went into a simian shimmy.</TE>
<TE>   The visiting San Franciscans were still gabbing when Glaus smacked
another home run in the Angels' half of the inning, and Adam Kennedy
singled in another run, to bring the score to 4-3, Giants.</TE>
<TE>   Out came the thunder sticks and the monkeys.</TE>
<TE>   But the Rally Monkey couldn't deliver. Andy Kerr, a 27-year-old
Aliso Viejo resident, blamed it on security guards, who for the first
time wouldn't let him and his two fellow "rally drunkeys" into the
game with monkey masks. "Everything is the same gear, even our
underwear," Kerr said of the three's good-luck uniform of red shorts
and red-and-white baseball shirts, emblazoned with their rally
drunkey logo.</TE>
<TE>   "They stole our monkey masks and brought us bad karma, but we'll
be back tomorrow," Kerr said, as he filed out with a subdued Angel
crowd.</TE>

<HD>Cumberland Gap Restores a Path to the Past</HD>

<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>MIDDLESBORO, Ky.</DL>
<LD>Politicians, history buffs and a few hundred spectators gathered at a
notch in the Allegheny Mountains known as the Cumberland Gap on
Saturday to celebrate the unbuilding of a highway.</LD>
<LD>   They came to dedicate the newly restored Wilderness Road, a
footpath through the Gap traveled first by American Indians and
marked out in 1775 by famed frontiersman Daniel Boone.</LD>
<LD>   Located where Kentucky, Virginia and Tennessee meet, the route
served as a gateway for westbound pioneers but evolved in modern
times into a dangerous stretch of pavement for drivers.</LD>
<TE>   Saturday's ceremony capped a 30-year effort to obliterate a
section of U.S. 25E known as "Massacre Mountain" and restore the
mile-long earthen path through the Cumberland Gap to resemble the way
it looked more than two centuries ago.</TE>
<TE>   "Now you can walk out on the Wilderness Road in the Gap, where
Boone and all the others passed through, and actually see deer and
turkey. It's a major transformation from a highway that was carrying
18,000 vehicles a day six years ago," said Mark Woods, superintendent
of the Cumberland Gap National Historical Park.</TE>
<TE>   Through a joint project of the U.S. National Park Service and the
Federal Highway Administration, traffic was diverted to a pair of
nearby tunnels completed in 1996. Woods said the old highway recorded
fatal accidents every year, but the new road has had none in six
years.</TE>
<TE>   Work to restore the Wilderness Road footpath began in August 2001.
In addition to grinding up pavement from the old highway, crews moved
hundreds of tons of earth to restore hills and a ravine that existed
in Boone's time but were filled in when the U.S. highway was built in
the 1900s.</TE>
<TE>   "We have taken it back to its natural state," Woods said.</TE>

a.m., Holmes County Sheriff Willie March said. He said the children
were two sets of three siblings.</LD>
<LD>   March said the state fire marshal's office was investigating, but
a preliminary account showed a candle the children were using
probably burned down and started the fire.</LD>

<HD>Labor Dept. to Implement 401(k) Protection, Bush Says</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>President Bush said Saturday his administration was acting to protect
investments of the 40 million Americans who have put $1.5 trillion
into 401(k) retirement savings accounts.</LD>
<LD>   "Turbulence in the markets reminds us that every investment
carries some risk," Bush said in his weekly radio address. "Yet
American workers also have rights that must be respected and
enforced."</LD>
<LD>   The $1.5 trillion in the hugely popular 401(k) accounts "is real
money for real workers, and we must do all we can to help make sure
it's there for them when they retire."</LD>
<TE>   Bush announced that the Labor Department will begin implementing
retirement plan protections Monday that Congress approved this year
as part of a bill to overhaul corporate accounting practices. Under
terms of the new regulations, 401(k) participants will be given 30
days' notice before being locked out of buying or selling in their
accounts when administrative changes are ordered.</TE>
<TE>   "This important protection will help ensure that workers don't get
stuck in a bad investment simply because their employers block them
from accessing their own accounts," Bush said.</TE>
<TE>   Another regulation, which bars corporate executives from selling
their stock during such blackout periods, is being enacted through a
regulation from the Securities and Exchange Commission.</TE>
<TE>   "If you can't sell on the shop floor, you should not be able to
sell on the top floor," Bush said, adding that both rules will be in
effect by early next year.</TE>
<TE>   Even though the rules already were required by Congress, White
House aides sought ahead of time to portray the president's radio
address as evidence of presidential news-making on the economy.</TE>
<TE>   The White House has its eye on the Nov. 5 elections that will
determine control of the House and Senate and many state legislatures
and governorships. Bush hopes to deflect Democrats' claims that the
economy has worsened during his presidency, and that he has done
little to help.</TE>
<TE>   Bush also urged Congress, especially the Democrat-controlled
Senate, to pass additional retirement savings protections beyond
those included in the accounting changes law. These would include
ensuring that workers can sell any company stock they own after three
years, "so that no one's nest egg is tied up in the stock of a single
company."</TE>
<TE>   His proposal also includes giving workers access to professional
investment advice and making sure they receive quarterly reports on
the performance of their 401(k)s.</TE>
<TE>   The Republican-led House passed a pension overhaul in April that
included those and other provisions. Senate Democrats, however, have
yet to agree on such issues as whether to limit how much company
stock workers can have in 401(k) plans and whether to require that
employees serve on company boards that oversee retirement plans.</TE>
<TE>   Bush said lawmakers should resolve their differences. "People who
work hard and save for the future deserve every protection we can
give them," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Bush was spending the weekend at the presidential retreat in Camp
David, Md.</TE>

<HD>2 Members of Illinois Death Row Clemency Board Being
Reassigned</HD>
<DH>The men were skeptical about claims that the state's system
for capital punishment is broken and that defendants did not receive
fair trials.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SPRINGFIELD, Ill.</DL>
<LD>A member of the board hearing more than 140 clemency petitions for
Illinois death row inmates this month has been removed from the
hearings after criticizing the process and the inmates' claims.</LD>
<LD>   A second outspoken member also will be transferred this week, but
that was planned before the clemency reviews began.</LD>
<LD>   Arvin Boddie and William Harris have expressed skepticism about
the claims of defense attorneys that the state's capital punishment
system is broken and that their clients did not receive fair trials.</LD>
<TE>   Prisoner Review Board Chairwoman Anne Taylor said Saturday that
their reassignments had nothing to do with the men's comments or a
complaint about Boddie from a third board member.</TE>
<TE>   She said the changes were simply attempts to keep up with the
board's other duties, and that she was not pressured by Gov. George
Ryan's office to make the moves.</TE>
<TE>   Harris said he was told last month that he would be assigned to a
Harrisburg prison near his home in southern Illinois to hear
discipline and parole requests during the second week of the
hearings. He doesn't believe anyone is trying to silence him, he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Boddie was told Friday to work at the Pontiac prison this week
instead of hearing clemency cases. Taylor said Boddie was chosen for
that job because he lives close to the prison.</TE>
<TE>   The hearings, which began Tuesday, come more than two years after
Ryan halted executions in Illinois, citing the wrongful convictions
of 13 inmates. After Ryan raised the possibility of commuting every
death sentence to life in prison without parole, condemned inmates
flooded the review board with clemency requests.</TE>
<TE>   The 14-member board, split into four panels in Chicago and
Springfield, is speeding through cases to determine whether inmates
should receive life sentences. Ryan, who urged the sweeping review,
can accept or reject its recommendations.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors and victims' families have been critical of the
hearings, calling them a slapdash attempt to undo justified death
penalty verdicts that took months or years to win.</TE>
<TE>   Dennis Culloton, a spokesman for the governor, said Saturday that
board member Jorge Montes complained to the governor's office about
Boddie's conduct but was told that the board had to resolve the
problem itself.</TE>
<TE>   Culloton criticized some members for taking sides during the
hearings.</TE>
<TE>   "They are supposed to be somewhat impartial at this point and to
make confidential recommendations after deliberating with other
members," Culloton said. "I don't see how declaring how you're going
to vote is consistent with how the board is supposed to operate."</TE>
<TE>   Boddie said he will accept his reassignment, but he defended his
comments.</TE>
<TE>   "It doesn't hurt me to be silenced. It hurts those that should
have the benefit of hearing what I've got to say," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Boddie was particularly vocal during the hearings, at one point
saying he was "sick and tired" of inmates making claims they couldn't
back up with hard evidence. He also said he was "offended by the
manner" in which the hearings were being conducted.</TE>
<TE>   Harris, a former Democratic state representative, repeatedly
indicated that he supports prosecutors and victims' families who have
opposed clemency for condemned prisoners.</TE>
<TE>   He also doesn't believe anyone is trying to silence him by
reassigning him.</TE>
<TE>   "If anyone were trying to curtail my thoughts I'd be surprised and
amazed," Harris said. "That's not true."</TE>
<TE>   Boddie was appointed to the board by Ryan in 2000 and Harris was
appointed by Gov. James Thompson in 1990.</TE>

<HD>A Congress of Milestones Exits</HD>
<DH>In spite of partisanship, legislators head into the
election having passed far-reaching bills on issues from campaign
finance to agriculture.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Janet Hook</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON -- A weary Congress is trudging to the exits knee-deep in
unfinished business, ranging from homeland security to health
legislation, with partisan tensions almost as taut as when the
session began after the disputed 2000 presidential election.</LD>
<LD>   But what may be more remarkable -- and easily obscured by the
mountain of stalled bills -- is how much far-reaching legislation
this divided Congress managed to produce, almost in spite of itself.</LD>
<LD>   The authorization of a possible war in Iraq is just the most
recent example. Significant changes were made in campaign finance
laws, corporate accounting standards, trade policy and farm
subsidies. In each of those areas, lawmakers passed what amounted to
legislative milestones, capping some debates that had lasted years,
even decades.</LD>
<TE>   Driving Congress to act in many of those cases was an
unpredictable series of events that buffeted and bruised the nation.
From the war in Afghanistan to a threat of war with Iraq; from an
epidemic of corporate scandals to a spectacular stock market plunge;
from recession to drought and wildfires in the West, Congress' agenda
has been set by forces far beyond its control.</TE>
<TE>   But underlying partisan differences became harder and harder to
bridge as lawmakers drew closer to an election day that could be a
watershed for one party or the other.</TE>
<TE>   The result has been a Congress that has shown flexibility in
responding to extraordinary circumstances but little creativity in
dealing with more enduring long-term quandaries.</TE>
<TE>   "Congress has been reactive, rather than addressing some
long-standing problems, like Social Security and Medicare," said
Burdett Loomis, a professor of political science at the University of
Kansas.</TE>
<TE>   This mixed record of accomplishment and impasse is the report card
that lawmakers will be taking home to voters as the Nov. 5 elections
approach.</TE>
<TE>   But the last chapter of this Congress will not be written until
after the elections, when lawmakers return for a lame-duck session.
They will have to finish writing the must-pass appropriation bills
needed to fund government agencies and programs for the 2003 fiscal
year.</TE>
<TE>   Stymied on these basic spending bills and many other issues, House
leaders last week sent their members home for the rest of the
campaign season. The Senate remains nominally in session, and House
leaders say they would reconvene before the elections if there is a
breakthrough on a major issue. But many lawmakers believe they have
effectively begun their preelection recess, not to return until the
week of Nov. 11.</TE>
<TE>   As the focus grows on the elections, each party is blaming the
other for impasses on such issues as helping the economy, creating a
department of homeland security and providing prescription drug
coverage through Medicare.</TE>
<TE>   "I believe that in many respects this was a very disappointing
Congress, disappointing in the sense that so much more could have
been accomplished," Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle (D-S.D.) said
Friday. He complained about "Republican obstructionism" and laid a
good deal of the blame on President Bush. "The president came to
Washington promising to change the tone, and he did: It's worse."</TE>
<TE>   Republicans, not surprisingly, depict a starkly different dynamic.
In a typical comment, Rep. George P. Radanovich (R-Mariposa) said:
"Daschle and the Democrats would have had to produce something for us
to obstruct, which of course they did not."</TE>
<TE>   A review of the year's odd melange of results -- some major bills
whizzing through while others languish -- provides a window into how
this Congress' output was shaped by the often-dizzying shifts in
political, economic and international developments.</TE>
<TE>   Take, for example, concern about corporate accounting and business
scandals. The issue burst onto the political scene early this year,
after the collapse of the Enron Corp., whose bankruptcy cost
investors -- including company employees -- billions of dollars in
pension funds and other savings.</TE>
<TE>   Because Enron officials were well-connected political donors to
both parties, the company's collapse helped propel legislation to ban
the national political parties from receiving the unlimited
contributions from corporations, unions and wealthy individuals known
as "soft money." Many skeptics thought reformers would forever lose
this battle, but in March the soft-money ban became the first major
campaign finance law enacted in a generation.</TE>
<TE>   Enron and the subsequent spate of corporate scandals also
catapulted to the fore an array of business-related issues that
previously had received little attention. The bill that toughened
oversight of the accounting industry and increased criminal penalties
for corporate fraud cleared Congress in July with head-spinning
velocity. It was widely hailed as the most far-reaching corporate
reform bill since the Great Depression.</TE>
<TE>   But now, after the Iraq issue dominated Congress for weeks,
corporate reform seems to have lost its political sizzle. Pension
protection legislation has fallen off the table. Efforts to crack
down on offshore tax havens have come to naught.</TE>
<TE>   Through all the vicissitudes of this year in Congress, one trend
remained fairly constant: Bush's dominance of Capitol Hill on issues
related to national security. That is a remarkable shift from when he
came to office and critics regarded his foreign policy leadership as
untested at best, amateurish at worst.</TE>
<TE>   But following the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, Democrats have been
loath to challenge Bush on foreign and defense policies. That
reluctance -- coupled with Bush's aggressive efforts to assert and
expand his presidential authority -- has tipped the balance of power
toward the White House.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a president who is really asserting presidential powers
in a forceful way," said Catherine Rudder, a professor of public
policy at George Mason University. "This is a Congress marked by
following presidential leadership" on foreign policy.</TE>
<TE>   The most striking demonstration of Bush's command came during the
debate on Iraq. Many Democrats and Republicans initially expressed
serious reservations about Bush's push to confront Iraqi President
Saddam Hussein. But after making only relatively modest concessions,
Bush won strong support for the measure authorizing the use of force
against Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   One major security issue on which Bush has not gotten his way is
his plan to create a homeland security department. Once considered
unstoppable, it has stalled in the Senate over Bush's proposal to
scale back civil service protections for employees in the new agency.
Labor unions, a core Democratic constituency, are vehemently opposed
to the provision.</TE>
<TE>   "The closer you get to the election, legislation loses its value
as public policy and gains value as a campaign issue, and there is no
better example of that than homeland security," said Ross K. Baker, a
political scientist at Rutgers University in New Jersey.</TE>
<TE>   Bush's failure to triumph -- at least so far -- on the homeland
security bill is just one example of the limits of his ability to
translate his preeminence in foreign policy into domestic policy
victories. Although he won passage of his big tax cut and education
reform bills last year, other domestic initiatives have become bogged
down this year.</TE>
<TE>   Among the bills expected to die is Bush's proposal to extend the
1996 welfare reform law. Also stalled is his initiative to expand
federal support for social services provided through faith-based
institutions. Energy legislation could pass during the lame-duck
session, but it would lack the cornerstone of Bush's proposed policy:
expanded oil drilling in part of Alaska's protected wilderness.</TE>
<TE>   Other bills that have made it through Congress' political
minefield tend to be on issues that do not break along traditional
party lines.</TE>
<TE>   That's part of the reason why Bush was able to win approval of
legislation giving him broader authority to negotiate international
trade agreements, restoring a presidential power that lapsed in 1994.
Trade is an issue that tends to split lawmakers on regional rather
than partisan lines, because international economic pressures vary in
different areas and industries.</TE>
<TE>   Helping Bush win what President Clinton could not was the argument
that the bill was needed to shore up the sagging economy -- and to
strengthen his hand abroad at a time when lawmakers were wary of
undercutting him on that front.</TE>
<TE>   Bipartisan momentum also was behind the big farm bill -- costing
$171 billion over 10 years -- that passed in May. It was a landmark,
albeit rued by conservatives and budget watchdogs, because it
essentially repealed a 1996 law designed to wean farmers from federal
subsidies and make U.S. agriculture more market-oriented.</TE>

<HD>Parents Resolve Nasty Custody Fight</HD>
<DH>Woman, son return to U.S. from China after settling dispute
with the boy's father.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>A woman returned home from China with her 5-year-old son Saturday
after a tense custody battle with her Chinese ex-husband that
threatened to become a diplomatic incident.</LD>
<LD>   Camille Colvin, 35, spent nine days in the central Chinese city of
Zhengzhou negotiating with her ex-husband, Guo Rui, over their child,
Griffin Guo.</LD>
<LD>   "It's been a long ordeal and we're really glad it's come to an
end," Colvin said at Kennedy International Airport.</LD>
<TE>   They were accompanied by her brother, Cal Elliott, who went to
China with her.</TE>
<TE>   "Griffin's doing well. He's a little intimidated right now, but
he's going to be himself in no time. He's an adorable child with a
lot of energy," Elliott said.</TE>
<TE>   Colvin and Elliott said they agreed to Guo's demand for money but
wouldn't say how much they paid. Guo has said the money was a form of
trust fund for Griffin and denied it was related to the boy's
release.</TE>
<TE>   Colvin's case drew the attention of high-ranking Chinese and
American officials as Chinese President Jiang Zemin prepared for a
visit to the United States this week.</TE>
<TE>   Guo took the boy during a July visit in New York, saying custody
of his son, a Chinese-born U.S. citizen, should be decided under
Chinese law.</TE>
<TE>   He said he had no other means of seeing the child and claimed
Colvin violated a California divorce agreement that gave him
visitation rights.</TE>
<TE>   After Colvin and Elliott arrived in Zhengzhou on Oct. 8, police
placed them and Guo in a hotel suite and told them to negotiate an
agreement.</TE>
<TE>   Elliott had said he kept constant watch over Griffin while Colvin
negotiated because police said they would grant custody to whichever
spouse had physical possession of the boy.</TE>

<HD>GOP Is Losing Its Grip on Illinois Governor's Mansion</HD>
<DH>Era of power-sharing in jeopardy as Democrat leads contest
for state's top spot. Republican candidate suffers from name
confusion.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Eric Slater</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>CHICAGO</DL>
<LD>For more than a quarter century, conservative residents of rural and
suburban Illinois have helped check the influence of the nation's
most famously Democratic city with a brilliantly simple, if not
necessarily easy, maneuver: they have elected a Republican governor
every four years.</LD>
<LD>   Since 1976, Illinois has had a de facto system of checks and
balances, with conservatives holding the governor's mansion and
liberals in charge in the nation's third largest city. The era of
power-sharing, however, may be coming to a close.</LD>
<LD>   With less just over two weeks to go before election day, the
Republican candidate for governor, state Atty. Gen. Jim Ryan, is low
on cash, short on endorsements and down by double-digits in most
polls to Democratic challenger Rod Blagojevich.</LD>
<TE>   One of the 56-year-old Ryan's most intractable problems has been
explaining to voters that he isn't already governor. That's George
Ryan -- no relation and no friend -- who is bowing out after one
scandal-plagued term.</TE>
<TE>   Blagojevich, meanwhile, a 45-year-old congressman from Chicago who
has an energy and look that elicits comparisons to John F. Kennedy,
has spent much of the campaign making friends with the conservatives
from "downstate" who Ryan expected to be his supporters. And he's had
remarkable success in offering lessons on Serbian name pronunciation.
"How do you say his name?" his Web page asks. "Bla-GOYA-vich," it
instructs, the "GOYA" pulsing for emphasis.</TE>
<TE>   "Each party in Illinois has long had a sort of veto somewhere,"
said Jim Nowlan, a former state legislator and longtime Republican
strategist.</TE>
<TE>   When Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley wanted to renovate Soldier
Field in the mid-1990s, then Gov. Jim Edgar refused to go along, and
the plan died.</TE>
<TE>   When Daley first pushed for expansion of O'Hare International
Airport, which sits just inside the city limits, current Gov. Ryan
supported the building of a new airport well south of the city. The
result: a moderated O'Hare expansion plan that has plenty of critics
but which most analysts agree will benefit the city and the state.</TE>
<TE>   The two also negotiated an agreement to rebuild Soldier Field, a
project now underway.</TE>
<TE>   "I think Republicans are going to lose their veto," Nowlan said.
"Jim Ryan has just not gotten any traction on any issue and the party
faithful are terribly demoralized."</TE>
<TE>   The last Democratic governor of Illinois took office when Richard
Nixon was president. Dan Walker earned the job in 1972 despite the
fact that he didn't have the backing of the Chicago party machine. He
lasted one rocky term.</TE>
<TE>   People remember him as something of a pro-union politician. Other
than that, most don't recall much about the state's political climate
a quarter century ago.</TE>
<TE>   They know, however, that the state and the city of Chicago have
done pretty well when the governor has had to negotiate with the
Windy City mayor on issues that affect both, and vice versa. And they
wonder what will happen if a Democrat wins the state's top job,
especially since the party, which already controls the state House,
may be able to take the state Senate as well, giving them full
control of Springfield.</TE>
<TE>   They also wonder how Jim Ryan, an old hand at the political game,
fell so far behind an ambitious young congressman with little name
recognition.</TE>
<TE>   In a sense, Ryan's problems began long before the campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Current Gov. Ryan was secretary of state, which oversees the Motor
Vehicles Division, before he was elected governor in 1998. After he
took the statehouse it was revealed that some of his underlings at
the secretary of state's office had exchanged commercial driver's
licenses for bribes, and that some of the ill-gotten funds had made
their way into his gubernatorial campaign coffers.</TE>
<TE>   The so-called licenses-for-bribes scandal has dragged on
throughout George Ryan's administration.</TE>
<TE>   Fifty people have been convicted thus far, though the governor
himself has not been implicated.</TE>
<TE>   Ryan's administration has been marked by another notable
controversy: his decision to place a moratorium on executions
following revelations that since the death penalty was reinstated in
Illinois in 1977, the state has executed 12 people and freed 13 who
had been wrongfully convicted.</TE>
<TE>   The moratorium has infuriated many in his own party -- and further
colored the name Ryan among conservatives.</TE>
<TE>   "Not very many voters can distinguish the fact that these are
different Ryans," said Kenneth Janda, a political professor emeritus
at Northwestern University. "Jim Ryan has really been hurt by the
governor and the scandal that has surrounded his administration."</TE>
<TE>   Jim Ryan's own history has haunted him as well, however.</TE>
<TE>   As attorney general when the licenses-for-bribes scandal broke, he
declined to launch an investigation. The FBI has handled the case.</TE>
<TE>   And it was Jim Ryan who carried out the most infamous of the
wrongful death-penalty prosecutions.</TE>
<TE>   As a state's attorney in Du- Page County, he prosecuted and
convicted Rolando Cruz and Alejandro Hernandez for the 1983 rape and
murder of a 10-year-old girl.</TE>
<TE>   Another man later confessed to the crime and the state Supreme
Court overturned Cruz and Hernandez's convictions. But Ryan insisted
on trying them again, despite additional evidence that they were not
guilty. Again he secured convictions, and again the Supreme Court
overturned them. Evidence of the two men's innocence continued to
grow, but Jim Ryan tried the two, and convicted them, a third time.</TE>
<TE>   Both were eventually freed -- Hernandez after 11 years on death
row, Cruz after 12 -- when DNA evidence suggested that the man who
had confessed was indeed the killer and after a police officer
confessed to lying during the trials. Last week, the lawyers who
helped exonerate Cruz -- including attorney and best-selling author
Scott Turow -- gathered to proclaim Jim Ryan unfit to be governor
based on his handling of the case.</TE>
<TE>   Such problems, as well as name confusion (on his campaign signs
"Jim" is about twice the size of "Ryan"), have certainly hurt the
Republican's run for the governorship. What has probably hurt him
more, observers agree, has been the well-funded and nearly seamless
campaign of Blagojevich.</TE>
<TE>   "Rod Blagojevich has run a very good campaign," said former
Democratic Sen. Paul Simon, who lives in Carbondale, the center of
anti-Chicago political sentiment. "And he has been spending a lot of
time in Southern Illinois."</TE>
<TE>   As of June 30, the last deadline for reporting on campaign funds,
Blagojevich had raised $11 million to Ryan's $7 million. Blagojevich
has invested much of his money on television ads downstate, where he
has shored up considerable support, pollsters say. Many of the ads
sought to solidify the very link Ryan has been trying to break -- the
one to George Ryan.</TE>
<TE>   Jim Ryan appears to have gained some ground by pointing out that
Blagojevich has the kind of family history downstate voters have
historically found so distasteful about Chicago Democratic politics.
Blagojevich's father-in-law is Alderman Richard Mell, a longtime ward
boss.</TE>
<TE>   Mell drafted his son-in-law for his first race, a winning run for
the state Assembly in 1992, and has contributed $118,000 of his own
money to Blagojevich's campaigns, according to state records.</TE>
<TE>   Still, as Ryan chips away at him, Blagojevich is viewed as a near
shoo-in, securing endorsements from historically pro-Republican
groups ranging from a powerful retailers' association to the State
Medical Society.</TE>
<TE>   Their contributions to Blagojevich "are insincere," scoffed state
Republican Party chair Gary MacDougal. "They just want to do business
with the state.</TE>
<TE>   "Our ads are just starting to run," MacDougal added. "The momentum
is now on our side."</TE>
<TE>   Ryan had indeed whittled several points from Blagojevich's lead in
one recent poll, to a 10-point difference. Nevertheless, residents
are preparing themselves to be led by two Democrats -- two Chicago
Democrats -- for the first time in more than a generation, should
Blagojevich win in November.</TE>
<TE>   And some are a bit unnerved.</TE>
<TE>   "We've had a balanced system here in Illinois for years, and I
think it's been good for both the Republicans and the Democrats,"
said Jeff Mays, president of the Illinois Business Roundtable. "It's
also been good for Illinois. We'll see what happens now."</TE>

<HD>Impromptu Debate in New Jersey</HD>
<DH>Republican Senate candidate Forrester confronts Democrat
Lautenberg on the campaign trail, prompting an exchange.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>METUCHEN, N.J.</DL>
<LD>Dragging two wooden podiums into an intersection at a street fair
Saturday, Republican Senate candidate Douglas R. Forrester challenged
Democratic rival Frank R. Lautenberg to make good on his "any place,
any time" debate pledge.</LD>
<LD>   Lautenberg, a three-term former senator, complied in a 10-minute
exchange during which Forrester criticized his opponent's voting
record and the Democrat focused on issues such as abortion rights and
gun control.</LD>
<LD>   The impromptu debate ended when the candidates' supporters started
shouting at each other.</LD>
<TE>   It was the second time since Lautenberg replaced beleaguered Sen.
Robert Torricelli in the race early this month that Forrester, who
trails slightly in polls, paid him a surprise visit on the campaign
trail to challenge him to debate.</TE>
<TE>   Forrester said Saturday that approaching Lautenberg at public
events is the only way to bring campaign issues to the public eye.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the most shameless attempt to hijack an election in New
Jersey's history," Forrester said.</TE>
<TE>   Forrester has proposed more than 20 debates around the state, but
Lautenberg, who retired two years ago, has agreed to just one
televised joint appearance, three days before the Nov. 5 election.
Tom Shea, Lautenberg's campaign manager, said the Democrat will agree
to at least one other televised debate.</TE>
<TE>   On Saturday, Forrester directed Lautenberg to the podium and
peppered him with questions about his voting record. Forrester has
criticized Lautenberg's 1991 vote against authorizing the Persian
Gulf War.</TE>
<TE>   Lautenberg discussed issues traditionally kind to New Jersey
Democrats and raised the topic of a newspaper column Forrester wrote
in 1990 that opposed drunk-driving checkpoints.</TE>
<TE>   The New Jersey Supreme Court allowed Democrats to replace
Torricelli with Lautenberg after a state deadline for switching
candidates.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. Supreme Court declined to review the state judges'
ruling.</TE>
<TE>   Torricelli pulled out of the race after a rebuke by Senate
colleagues over allegations of unethical conduct.</TE>

<KH>SEVEN CORNERS, Va.</KH>
<HD>Distance Offers Sniper Safe Haven</HD>
<DH>Providing an element of surprise and a chance to escape, a
shot from afar also confuses witnesses.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Stephen Braun</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>SEVEN CORNERS, Va. -- Distance is the Beltway killer's lethal edge.</LD>
<LD>   Firing from hundreds of yards away, he remains a phantom to
victims and witnesses. Distance provides the element of surprise and
the luxury of escape, a cloaking remoteness that has emerged as the
most frustrating obstacle for investigators struggling to catch the
serial murderer before he kills again.</LD>
<LD>   When the gunman shot his 11th victim Monday night, Ligia Baldivia
knew in an instant where the shot came from. The sonic crack echoed
out of a darkened school parking lot close to her first-floor
apartment.</LD>
<TE>   "I didn't know it was from this guy until the next day," she said.
"It was so loud, everybody around here heard it."</TE>
<TE>   But across U.S. 50, a noisy six-lane highway, sniper task force
detectives were convinced that the fatal shot had been fired from
inside a Falls Church, Va., Home Depot garage. For two days after FBI
analyst Linda Franklin was felled near her car, investigators thought
the gunman had finally made a critical mistake, surrendering the
safety of distance to kill close up.</TE>
<TE>   Then investigators discovered that a primary witness had trumped
up a tale that Franklin had been shot from only 40 yards away, and
they shifted their focus to the parking lot 100 yards across the
highway. It was a return to the painstaking long-range searches that
have strained police manpower and complicated evidence-gathering for
18 wearying days.</TE>
<TE>   The gunman's ability to murder from long distances has forced
investigators to expand their crime scenes by hundreds of yards and
bogged them down in a tedious hunt for what might be left behind. It
also has distorted the sound from the sniper's high-powered rifle,
making it hard to know where the shots are coming from.</TE>
<TE>   "We're now at the point where we go out on each new case knowing
we have a remote crime scene we have to deal with," one investigator
said. "That doesn't make it any easier to solve."</TE>
<TE>   Task force officials say the rifle-wielding assailant has fired
each of his 11 solitary shots from a distance of 150 to 500 yards.
Using high-velocity .223-caliber ammunition, the sniper has tended to
fire closer to the 150-yard range in most of the shootings,
investigators believe. He has killed nine people and wounded two, and
authorities were investigating a Saturday night shooting in Ashland,
Va., as possibly connected.</TE>
<TE>   But in at least two cases, one official said, the bullet's
trajectory showed it was fired from so far away that police are still
uncertain exactly where the gunman hid.</TE>
<TE>   Distance "makes it hard for us in several ways," said Douglas F.
Gansler, the Montgomery County state's attorney who heads a team of
prosecutors in the five Maryland murders.</TE>
<TE>   "You have fewer witnesses because the sniper isn't seen," Gansler
said. "The witnesses focus most of their attention on the victim
because that's the only part of the crime they see. And you end up
having to deal with two crime scenes -- where the victim was hit and
where the shooter fired from."</TE>
<TE>   If his penchant for targeting people from long range signals a
thirst for killing as sport, as some police and serial murder experts
say, it also shows a deep sense of caution.</TE>
<TE>   "The farther away you are, the greater the chance you escape
undetected," said Peter Gagliardi, a former federal firearms official
who now works as a private forensics consultant.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators believe that, in some instances, the killer may have
fired from inside a vehicle -- which could contain valuable crime
scene evidence such as powder burns and spent shells. On Saturday,
police forensics teams examined a white box truck after being tipped
by a cleaning crew that found a shell casing inside. The rental
vehicle had just been returned to an agency near Dulles International
Airport in Virginia.</TE>
<TE>   Some task force members are exploring the possibility that the
killer's vehicle was moving as he fired -- a difficult feat that
suggests an accomplice as driver.</TE>
<TE>   Firing from afar confuses witnesses because, as a bullet travels a
long trajectory in a split second, the sound of the gunshot is
distorted by "traffic patterns in the street, wind, noise and rain.
Sound travels funny," said Gagliardi, a former head of the Department
of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms in New York who now is a vice
president at Forensic Technology in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   The result is echo, distortion and the mistaken impression that a
bullet was fired from one direction when it actually came from
another.</TE>
<TE>   That confusion is magnified by the fact that the sniper fires only
a single round. "When you have only one shot," Gansler said, "it
doesn't give witnesses a chance to use a second shot to tell its
direction."</TE>
<TE>   A remote firing site also complicates the search for evidence by
giving the gunman time to clean up the evidence around him before he
flees.</TE>
<TE>   Jim Pasco, a former federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and
Firearms deputy director who now heads the National Fraternal Order
of Police, said that, even outdoors, forensics experts know how to
look for critical shell casings and traces of gunpowder on fences,
walls, car hoods -- anywhere that a gunman might brace his rifle
before firing.</TE>
<TE>   But those efforts can be frustrated if police take days to find
the actual firing spot -- a period in which evidence such as powder
burns can erode in the wind and rain.</TE>
<TE>   The ATF has used metal detectors and search dogs sensitive to
trace amounts of gunpowder to speed the search for powder burns and
other residue.</TE>
<TE>   "They'd like to move fast to get all the material they can,"
Gagliardi said. "But if they have huge areas to search, they might
not find the firing point. Even if they do, it might be too late."</TE>
<TE>   Baldivia, the Fairfax County resident, and half a dozen other
people who live in a maze of red brick apartments directly across
U.S. 50 from the Home Depot said police did not question them on the
night of Franklin's murder. Adriana Velasquez, 35, a Salvadoran
emigre, said she was not interviewed until the day after, when she
went to the Home Depot to leave a votive candle at the parking spot
where Franklin died. Baldivia still had not been questioned by
detectives by week's end.</TE>
<TE>   Although Fairfax County police said the false witness did not
impede the investigation, it took investigators three days to mount a
full-scale search for evidence in the school parking lot.</TE>
<TE>   Police have provided few details of their searches. The scene that
yielded the most clues was a patch of woods where detectives found
the killer's perch hours after the sniper shot and wounded a
13-year-old student in Prince George's County, Md. Police found a
shell casing, matted grass and a Tarot card scrawled with a taunting
message: "Dear Mr. Policeman, I am God."</TE>
<TE>   All of those items could become crucial in matching the killer to
the remote crime scene -- but only after police make progress in
finding a suspect. As long as the sniper stays far out of sight, the
amassed evidence remains useless.</TE>

<HD>New Bishop for Scandal-Hit Diocese</HD>
<DH>Sean Patrick O'Malley's two predecessors in Palm Beach
resigned after sexual misconduct.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>PALM BEACH GARDENS, Fla.</DL>
<LD>A church leader known for combating sexual abuse by clergy was
installed Saturday as bishop of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Palm
Beach, where two predecessors resigned amid scandals.</LD>
<LD>   Sean Patrick O'Malley was installed before more than 1,800 people,
including 200 clergy members, 14 bishops and the papal nuncio, the
Vatican's top representative in the United States.</LD>
<LD>   "To those who are upset with the church, I say don't forget the
whole picture," O'Malley said during the service. "The storm of
crisis and scandal rages about us, but amidst the worst storm that
engulfs us, our Lord is with us."</LD>
<TE>   Outgoing Bishop Anthony J. O'Connell resigned in March after he
admitted that he spent time naked in bed with one of his students at
the Missouri seminary where he taught in the late 1970s. In 1998,
then-Bishop J. Keith Symons resigned after admitting he molested five
altar boys decades earlier.</TE>
<TE>   O'Malley said his first task will be to appraise diocesan policies
regarding abuse.</TE>
<TE>   O'Malley took over as bishop of Fall River, Mass., in 1992, when
that diocese was rocked by the sexual abuse scandal.</TE>
<TE>   He implemented policies including criminal background checks and
training for everyone involved with children -- priests and
volunteers -- and referring sex abuse victims to independent social
workers.</TE>
<TE>   O'Malley is a member of the Capuchin order and wears the simple
brown robes, sandals and rope belt traditional to the order.</TE>
<TE>   He holds a doctorate in Spanish and Portuguese literature from
Catholic University of America in Washington, D.C., and served as
bishop in St. Thomas, Virgin Islands, before his appointment to Fall
River.</TE>
<TE>   Appointed by Pope John Paul II on Sept. 3, O'Malley assured the
public that his background is free of scandals and accusations.</TE>

<HD>Jury Acquits Ex-York, Pa., Mayor in '69 Killing of Black
Woman</HD>
<DH>Two others convicted in incident that ripped apart
community during race riots.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>YORK, Pa.</DL>
<LD>The former mayor was acquitted and two other men were convicted
Saturday in the shotgun slaying of a young black woman during race
riots that tore apart York in 1969, the verdicts all but closing the
books on a crime that has haunted the city for more than three
decades.</LD>
<LD>   Charlie Robertson, 68, cried after the all-white jury's verdict
was read, saying later the tears were "from prayers."</LD>
<LD>   The former mayor and two other men were tried in the death of
Lillie Belle Allen, a preacher's daughter from Aiken, S.C., who was
gunned down by a white mob on July 21, 1969. Robert Messersmith and
Greg Neff were convicted of second-degree murder and face sentences
of 10 to 20 years in prison; jurors had the option of convicting them
of manslaughter.</LD>
<TE>   The long-unsolved case is nearly finished: Of the 10 white men
charged in Allen's slaying, six pleaded guilty earlier and await
sentencing. The final suspect faces trial later.</TE>
<TE>   The case was dormant for years before prosecutors, saying they had
new information, opened it again in 1999. Many in this faded
manufacturing city of 40,000 worried openly that the investigation
and trial would reopen old wounds.</TE>
<TE>   The riots, touched off by simmering violence between white and
black youths, left Allen dead, white patrolman Henry Schaad mortally
wounded, more than 60 people injured and whole blocks burned. It took
400 National Guardsmen and state police troopers to quell the
violence.</TE>
<TE>   Robertson, a police officer during the riots, went on to become a
popular two-term mayor. Prosecutors said Messersmith and Neff were
members of the white gangs that ambushed the car carrying Allen, 27,
and four relatives.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors said Robertson handed out ammunition to at least one
of the gunmen in an effort to even the score for the shooting of the
patrolman three days before Allen was slain.</TE>
<TE>   One of the men who pleaded guilty, Rick Knouse, testified that
Robertson gave him .30-06 caliber rifle ammunition and told him to
"kill as many" blacks as he could.</TE>
<TE>   Robertson admitted shouting "white power" at a gang rally the day
before Allen's killing, but he denied the other accusations. He has
apologized for those views, saying the mugging of his father by three
black men when he was a youth affected him deeply.</TE>
<TE>   Messersmith, 53, was accused of firing the shot that killed Allen,
while Neff, 54, was accused of shooting at the white Cadillac
carrying Allen and her sister, brother-in-law and parents.</TE>
<TE>   The family was on its way to the grocery store when the car turned
into a predominantly white neighborhood where armed youths had girded
for war with blacks. The car stalled, and Allen was shot when she
climbed out to take the wheel.</TE>
<TE>   Robertson was the first officer to arrive at the murder scene.
Though he credited himself with saving the lives of Allen's
relatives, he and three other officers did not disarm gang members,
take witness statements or file a report.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone knew who was involved," Robertson told Time magazine
last year.</TE>
<TE>   "But everyone just thought it was even. One black had been killed
and one white -- even."</TE>
<TE>   None of the three defendants testified at trial.</TE>
<TE>   The jury had deliberated for about 10 hours over three days before
reaching the verdict, appearing at times to struggle to come to a
conclusion.</TE>
<TE>   At one point Saturday, they asked the judge if it was too early to
declare a hung jury; the judge said yes and sent them back to
deliberate.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been two years," Robertson said after the verdict. "I'm a
little tired and I'm going home."</TE>
<TE>   Defense attorneys said there was no definitive proof that any of
the three killed Allen.</TE>

<HD>Sniper Task Force Rolls on Shooting</HD>
<DH>A man is wounded by a single shot that 'came out of
nowhere' 80 miles south of the capital.</DH>

<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>An interstate highway traveler was seriously wounded Saturday night
in the parking lot of an Ashland, Va., steakhouse by a single
long-range gunshot -- circumstances similar enough to the suburban
Washington attacks to prompt sniper task force investigators to rush
to the crime scene.</LD>
<LD>   Sheriff's officials in Hanover County, Va., and residents who live
near the crime scene said the unidentified victim, a 37-year-old man,
was struck in the abdomen as he emerged from the restaurant and
walked to his car with his wife. Police said the man was out of
surgery in critical condition at the Medical College of Virginia
Hospital in Ashland, a highway transit town about 80 miles south of
Washington in the Richmond suburbs.</LD>
<LD>   Racing their squad cars down highway ramps, police shut down
traffic along Interstate 95 from the Washington Beltway to Richmond,
searching for an unseen assailant. As helicopters darted overhead and
the strobes of police cars lighted clogged roadways, Virginia state
troopers and Hanover deputies went car by car, searching for anything
out of place. Police had little to go on because, authorities said,
no one saw the assailant or any vehicle leave the scene.</LD>
<TE>   Police said the victim appeared to have been shot from a darkened
tree line behind the restaurant about 100 feet from where he walked
toward his car. The Washington-area sniper, who has killed nine
people and wounded two over the last 18 days with expertly aimed
solitary rifle shots, has struck his victims from a similar distance
and usually near a major highway.</TE>
<TE>   A sniper task force was on its way to the scene, said Montgomery
County, Md., Police Capt. Nancy Demme.</TE>
<TE>   If the Ashland shooting is connected to the 11 others that have
terrorized the Washington area, it would represent new breaks in the
sniper's established pattern. The incident would extend the gunman's
rampage more than an hour south of his Beltway killing ground and
mark the first time he has struck on a weekend. It also would mark
the longest lull between shootings; his last attack was on Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Ashland Police Chief Frederic Pleasants Jr. cautioned late
Saturday night that police had no immediate evidence suggesting that
the Beltway killer had struck in Ashland. "We do not have any
description of a suspect, witness or vehicle at this time," the
sheriff said.</TE>
<TE>   But Maryland State Police Sgt. William Vogt said troopers were on
the lookout for a white van with a ladder rack -- the familiar
suspect vehicle that sniper investigators have sought since a slaying
at a gas station just over a week ago in Spotsylvania County, Va.</TE>
<TE>   Pleasants noted grimly that the unexplained shooting didn't fit
the rural county's low crime patterns.</TE>
<TE>   "This is an unusual incident for the community, someone being shot
in this way for no reason," said Pleasants, who added that the
county's most recent gunshot incident occurred in February.</TE>
<TE>   Federal forensics experts who reached the scene within two hours
of the shooting joined police in scouring woods behind the
restaurant. Virginia State Police helicopters aided the search,
shining bright beacons of light down into the trees.</TE>
<TE>   In the other shootings, firearm analysts typically took at least a
day of ballistics tests before they were able to tell whether the
fired rounds were the .223-caliber bullets linked to the sniper's
high-velocity rifle.</TE>
<TE>   Pleasants and Sheriff's Lt. Doug Goodman said the victim was an
out-of-state traveler who had pulled off I-95 with his wife to fill
up his car with gas and have dinner at the Ponderosa steakhouse. As
the couple walked from the restaurant after dinner, Pleasants said,
the man's wife "heard a sound, but didn't relate it to a gunshot. Her
husband took about three steps and then collapsed in the parking
lot."</TE>
<TE>   Victor Johnson, a night clerk at the Hampton Inn across the street
from the Virginia restaurant, said people heard only one gunshot --
the hallmark of the Beltway sniper.</TE>
<TE>   "They kept saying it's only one shot," Johnson said. "There was no
altercation or anything. They said it just came out of nowhere."</TE>
<TE>   Ashland, with about 6,000 residents, is a favorite stop for
travelers along I-95. It is just off the highway north of Interstate
295, a bypass of Richmond and Petersburg.</TE>
<TE>   Raymond Loving, who owns a Texaco station about 50 yards from the
steakhouse, told CNN that a woman came into his gas station and said
someone had been shot in the parking lot.</TE>
<TE>   "She didn't see anything. She just heard a loud boom," Loving
said.</TE>
<TE>   It was uncertain Saturday night whether military surveillance
aircraft were alerted to the shooting. Last week, after the Beltway
sniper struck his 11th victim, the Pentagon offered up its RC-7
planes to help hunt for the killer. The plane is primarily designed
to spot movements of vehicles, machinery and cadres of soldiers, not
a lone suspect. The plane's thermal detectors could detect a muzzle
flash if it were staking out a limited area, such as a shopping
center, but not a sprawling region, and it is unclear how much could
be done in the dark of night.</TE>
<TE>   The Ponderosa is on England Street, a strip of restaurants, hotels
and gas stations 3 1/2 blocks from an I-95 onramp. Similarly, in the
most recent sniper shootings in Virginia, the killer felled his
victims and reportedly vanished onto major highways, eluding massive
police dragnets.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier Saturday, Montgomery County Police Chief Charles A. Moose
said investigators do not intend to reveal until Monday, at the
earliest, any findings regarding a shell casing found in a rental
truck at Washington Dulles International Airport on Friday.</TE>
<TE>   The vehicle where the casing was found is a white box-type truck
-- the type described by some shooting scene witnesses -- returned to
a rental car agency. An employee found the casing while cleaning the
vehicle.</TE>
<TE>   The truck was seized by police and is being swept for evidence.
The shell casing is being examined by the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco
and Firearms.</TE>
<TE>   Experts said that a link between the shell casing and the sniper
attacks could be readily determined by comparing it with another
shell casing found near one of the shootings.</TE>
<TE>   The challenge for forensic specialists will be to assess whether
the shell casing bears markings that link it to a casing recovered
near where the sniper gravely wounded a 13-year-old boy Oct. 7 in
Bowie, Md. If the casings were discharged by the same rifle, "They
should be able to make a strong connection," said John C. Gibbons, a
former Justice Department prosecutor.</TE>
<TE>   A shell casing holds the powder charge for a bullet to be fired.
Investigators will search for signature-bearing marks on the casings.</TE>
<TE>   Explained Russ Champagne, an assistant store manager for Turner's
Outdoorsman in Fountain Valley, "If they find a particular striker
mark on the side of the shell case, you can tell which gun it came
from, up to the point of being able to tell that it is [from] an
identical gun, if you can recover a second casing."</TE>
<TE>   However, experts said that determining whether the shell casings
are linked poses somewhat more of a challenge than comparing
.223-caliber bullets, the type used by the sniper. Champagne noted
that a dozen or more different types of casings could be used for a
.223-caliber bullet.</TE>
<TE>   Two of the sniper's victims were buried Saturday. More than 400
people turned out at the Shrine of the Sacred Heart Roman Catholic
Church in Washington to remember Pascal Charlot, 72, a carpenter who
moved from Haiti to Washington in 1964. He was gunned down Oct. 3
while standing on a street corner.</TE>
<TE>   Near Pottstown, Pa., more than 100 people filled Christ
Evangelical Congregational Church to remember Dean Meyers, 53, a
Vietnam veteran, civil engineer, motorcycle enthusiast and huge
Beatles fan. He was shot Oct. 9 on his way to his Gaithersburg, Md.,
home after stopping for gas in Manassas, Va.</TE>

<HD>Culture Collision Brews in Maine</HD>
<DH>The arrival in Lewiston of 1,500 Somali refugees in 18
months has the city straining to provide social services and maintain
civic harmony.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Elizabeth Mehren</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>LEWISTON, Maine</DL>
<LD>In the park near City Hall, Abdullah Ibrahim kicked a soccer ball
with his 9-year-old daughter. As the ball spun across crisp autumn
leaves, Ibrahim's mind whirled. At Yasmin's age, he realized, he had
no idea where -- or even what -- Maine was.</LD>
<LD>   "Maybe I knew what America was," Ibrahim said. "Maybe. I am not so
sure." But now the 44-year-old computer technology student is one of
more than 1,500 Somali refugees to arrive in this fading industrial
city about 30 miles north of Portland. The large influx of families
-- most of them Muslim -- from East Africa came swiftly, in just 18
months. For longtime residents and newcomers alike, the sudden
population shift has brought a sense of mutual culture shock.</LD>
<LD>   "There is a difference of traditions, a difference of religion, a
difference of color, a difference of language -- so many things,"
Ibrahim said as Yasmin, in her Muslim headpiece, rushed off to play
on the jungle gym. "It is culturally confusing, of course."</LD>
<TE>   Sometimes wary, sometimes welcoming, this community of 36,000 --
where some residents still identify themselves as being French or
Irish -- has struggled to provide services and to maintain civic
harmony.</TE>
<TE>   Mutual skepticism and curiosity gave way to controversy when the
mayor announced this month that the Somalis were draining Lewiston of
its financial and emotional resources. Although tensions eased
somewhat after a City Hall meeting with Somali leaders Oct. 11,
Lewiston's melting pot continued to simmer.</TE>
<TE>   Mayor Larry Raymond referred questions to Assistant City
Administrator Phil Nadeau, who called Lewiston's adjustment to the
immigrants "nothing short of miraculous." Nadeau said he has spent
much of the last year coordinating efforts among 18 agencies detailed
to help the Somalis, while ordinary concerns such as potholes and
barking dogs have assumed distant spots on his priority list.</TE>
<TE>   Nadeau faulted U.S. policymakers for leaving Lewiston with a host
of problems. He said most of the Somalis are "second-wave" immigrants
-- families who have been in the U.S. more than a year, thus
exhausting refugee resettlement benefits. They fled a poor,
agro-pastoral country, racked by civil war, where the literacy rate
is around 30%. Most first settled near Atlanta, but high crime and
worries about drugs and prostitution drove them to Maine -- known for
decent schools, a low crime rate and long, frigid winters.</TE>
<TE>   Job skills were minimal among the new residents, and bias ran
high, Nadeau said, recalling that some employers admitted that they
were suspicious of Muslims after last year's terrorist attacks.
Displaying what Nadeau called "naive ignorance," some business owners
said they could not afford to hire workers who pause to pray five
times a day.</TE>
<TE>   Cultural conflicts sometimes arose in the workplace, Nadeau said,
recounting that one Somali worker faced off with a boss who crooked a
finger to summon him to a meeting. In Somalia, the worker said, that
gesture is reserved for calling dogs.</TE>
<TE>   Eighteen months after the first refugees showed up, 50% of the
adult Somalis in Lewiston are employed, Nadeau said, "but that means
50% are not." Some here saw the immigrants' high unemployment rate as
a cue for criticism. False rumors circulated that the refugees were
all getting free cars, or that City Hall was buying them new
automobile transmissions.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd like to know why they came here anyway. All they want is the
handout," said Jim Packard, dining on his daily frankfurter at
Simone's "World Famous" hot dog restaurant. "They don't want to work.
They come here, they get this, they get that. Well, I work. I don't
get any of those things."</TE>
<TE>   At Big D's lounge, a dark and smoky bar, owner Don Dube echoed
these sentiments. Asserting that Muslim schoolchildren "get more
rights than Catholic children, Protestant children, Jewish children,"
Dube, 67, said the refugees cry discrimination whenever things seem
to go against them.</TE>
<TE>   "The Somalians get away with everything here. I get so
aggravated," Dube said. "We got landlords in this city who are
kicking out our own people to put Somalians in. We're giving them
everything, everything they want. Now they're talking about raising
our property taxes to cover the budget increases. They're depleting
our finances."</TE>
<TE>   In fact, the needs of the new residents caused Lewiston's general
assistance budget to double last year, to more than $500,000, Nadeau
said. Emergency grants from several sources are expected to bring
some fiscal relief.</TE>
<TE>   At a free furniture bank in downtown Lewiston, Dot Treadwell said
she doubted that families piling up in apartments built a century ago
for mill workers were living in opulence. "A lot of them have two and
three families together," she said. "They have big families with lots
of children. They come in here, they get a free mattress to put on
the floor and they are really appreciative."</TE>
<TE>   At the local mosque -- a converted food store where plastic trash
bags are used to darken the windows -- Abdullah Abdirahman Ali
Hassan, 46, refused to acknowledge any difficulties in his adopted
home. More than 250 people braved icy rain last week to demonstrate
in support of the Somalis, he pointed out. He said his children are
happy in school, and as a diabetic, he is pleased with his health
care. "This is a fine country," he insisted. "One may not be of the
same color, but one is of the same mentality."</TE>
<TE>   But Abdiaziz Ali, 31, said he understood why some in Lewiston
might wonder about their city's rapid demographic shift.</TE>
<TE>   "If I woke up in my city in Somalia and there were 2,000 white
people, I'd say what is going on here too," said Ali, the city's only
welfare caseworker assigned to the Somali community. "I might even
say things like, 'Oh, they are taking our jobs.' That's not racism.
That's just human nature."</TE>
<TE>   Ali said a small city such as Lewiston, where "everybody knows
everybody, nobody gets shot or killed," is exactly where he wants to
raise his five kids. "I see myself being here, sending my children to
college here, retiring here. This is home."</TE>
<TE>   At Frenchy's Barber Shop, a one-chair establishment next door to
the mosque, "Frenchy" Langlois said he was 15 when he hopped a train
in French-speaking Canada 48 years ago and made his way south to
Maine.</TE>
<TE>   When he got here, some people bitterly charged him with trying to
take away jobs, Langlois remembered. That experience, he said, made
it easy to put himself in the Somalis' shoes.</TE>
<TE>   "How can you judge a person by what they look like or how they
pray?" he asked. "All I got to say is, they're nice people. They're
human beings. They got two arms, two legs, two eyes. They're so
different from you and me?"</TE>

<HD>Movement Would Thrust Greatness on Lake St. Clair</HD>
<DH>It's a pretty big lake, but a Great Lake? Though many
scoff, proponents say it rates a promotion.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Terril Yue Jones</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>ST. CLAIR SHORES, Mich.</DL>
<LD>Standing on the edge of Lake St. Clair, the water stretches as far as
one can see, beyond fishermen in motorboats in the foreground and
long, narrow freighters far in the distance. Clearly, this is one big
lake.</LD>
<LD>   But is it a "Great Lake"?</LD>
<LD>   Some would like it to be, and a movement to get Lake St. Clair
named the sixth official Great Lake is getting underway. Jim LaHood
thinks the idea is, well, a great one. "I've always considered Lake
St. Clair the greatest of all the Great Lakes," says LaHood, who owns
Lakeshore Lanes, a bowling alley that his father built here in 1950.</LD>
<TE>   "I'd get up every morning and look out on the lake," says LaHood,
stocky and tanned with a shock of white hair ringing his head. "Of
course it's a Great Lake. It's not as big as the other Great Lakes,
but you can't see to the other side. It sure doesn't feel like an
inland lake."</TE>
<TE>   Lake St. Clair lies between southeast Michigan and Canada, just
north of Detroit. Connecting Lake Huron to Lake Erie, it's a critical
passage on the shipping route stretching from Duluth, Minn., to the
Atlantic Ocean. Three thousand freighters a year pass through it.
Teeming with perch, walleye, bass and muskie, it's home to more than
153,000 pleasure boats on the American side alone.</TE>
<TE>   But at 670 square miles, it's only one-eleventh the size of Lake
Ontario -- the smallest of the five Great Lakes -- though more than
three times the size of Lake Tahoe. Lake Superior is 47 times as
large. And the lake is shallow, averaging only 10 feet except where
the shipping channel has been dredged. At Metro Beach in Harrison
Township, the biggest beach in the Detroit region, swimmers can wade
out 300 feet and still be only waist deep.</TE>
<TE>   Trying to classify it as a Great Lake is not so much for tourism
or bragging rights as for federal grants that would accompany the
designation and help clean up the frequently fouled waters.</TE>
<TE>   Lack of water treatment facilities, funds and scientific data to
better control the problem have led to raw sewage and chemical
runoff, soil erosion and contamination, and alarmingly high levels of
plant growth and E. coli bacteria in the lake.</TE>
<TE>   "Ninety percent of the total flow into Lake Erie comes through
us," says Doug Martz, chairman of the Macomb County Water Quality
Board and the driving force behind the sixth Great Lake campaign.
"The majority of their pollution is coming from us."</TE>
<TE>   Martz says pregnant women and children shouldn't eat fish out of
Lake St. Clair. Recent tests have found E. coli concentrations at 170
times what is considered safe. He also complains that there's little
monitoring of more than 70 chemical plants and refineries upriver in
Sarnia, Canada -- known locally as "Chemical Valley."</TE>
<TE>   Back in June 1994, there was a billion-gallon sewage spill when
heavy rains caused retention basins to overflow. It closed many of
the lake's beaches, and excessive plant growth tangled the waters up
to several hundred feet offshore. "You could walk on it and your feet
would stay dry," says Metro Beach Supt. Jim Pershing, still amazed.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the lake has a romantic draw to those who live in the towns
that ring it.</TE>
<TE>   "It's sort of a source of energy for me. I can walk to the end of
my street and watch a sunrise," says Tom Stanton, 41, a writer who
lives a block from the lake in New Baltimore. He has gone boating and
water skiing, summer and winter fishing and even cross-country skiing
on the lake, which often freezes over in the winter.</TE>
<TE>   Yet for all his fondness, Stanton is a skeptic about the Great
Lake designation. "It's a wonderful lake. But it's not a Great Lake,"
he says. "When you look at a map, you see that Lake St. Clair just
doesn't measure up."</TE>
<TE>   Even the pollution concerns aren't persuading some residents to
back Martz's grass-roots campaign.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it stinks," Ed Fritz said of the idea as he packed up his
motorboat and catch of about 30 perch at a loading dock in Harrison
last week. "You're going to have to change all the history books,"
said the 76-year-old retiree who used to work on furnaces for Ford
Motor Co.</TE>
<TE>   His fishing buddy Larry Jeziorski, 63, a retired financial planner
who remembers boating on Lake St. Clair in the 1940s when you could
see the bottom, was more sympathetic to the notion of six Great
Lakes.</TE>
<TE>   "But I don't know if it's going to change anything," said
Jeziorski, who has been to all five Great Lakes but likes the fishing
here best. "It's a nice lake, but I don't know if it's a Great Lake."</TE>
<TE>   Some officials who work on lake and waterway issues are supportive
of Martz's efforts to clean up the lake, if not enthusiastic about
the Great Lake designation. "I don't think it needs to be designated
a Great Lake to get attention," says Jessica Opfer, executive
director of the Clinton River Watershed Council in nearby Rochester
Hills. "Most grant funding available to the Great Lakes system
includes connecting waterways." The 1970 Merchant Marine Act declared
the Great Lakes system as "the nation's fourth sea coast" and as part
of that system, Lake St. Clair is eligible for some grants that come
with the designation.</TE>
<TE>   But Great Lakes Commissioner Michael Donahue, whose board
represents eight states and two Canadian provinces, agrees that Lake
St. Clair has fallen through the cracks. "It simply has not received
the attention and funding it deserves from an economic and ecological
standpoint."</TE>
<TE>   The commission isn't taking a position on adding a Great Lake,
although at least one member, Rex Damschroder of Ohio, is vehemently
opposed. "It's clearly not a Great Lake, neither in size nor volume,"
he told the Detroit News last week.</TE>
<TE>   Martz calls it the forgotten lake, insisting: "This lake has been
lost, and I want it found again."</TE>
<TE>   A wiry, tireless fellow of 53 who says he works 60 hours a week on
local water quality issues, Martz is somewhat of a showman. A few
years ago he drove around Macomb County in a 1972 Cadillac Fleetwood
with plungers mounted on the fenders and a toilet attached to the
roof collecting signatures to support clean water initiatives.</TE>
<TE>   At a Great Lakes Commission meeting in Cleveland last week, Martz
passed out bumper stickers saying, "Lake St. Clair: Heart of the
Great Lakes" and laid out his case to commissioners. No vote was
taken; it's up to Congress to elevate the lake's status. The next
step for Martz and fellow water quality board member Bill Smith, who
is helping to spearhead the campaign, is to lobby U.S. senators and
congress members.</TE>
<TE>   It wouldn't be the first effort to declare Great Lake No. 6. In
1998 Sen. Patrick Leahy of Vermont unsuccessfully sought an amendment
to bestow the title to Lake Champlain, which sits between Vermont and
New York. True Great Lakers snort at the thought. "That's not even in
our drainage basin," says Commissioner Donahue.</TE>
<TE>   Schoolchildren in America, no matter where they grow up, learn
about the five Great Lakes in geography lessons. LaHood, the bowling
alley owner, says Americans should know the name of Lake St. Clair as
well.</TE>
<TE>   "We're very critical to the Great Lakes," he says, "because we
link it all together."</TE>

<HD>Study Finds a Graying of the American Electorate</HD>

<BD>From the Washington Post</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The nation's electorate is rapidly graying, with the cadre of older
Americans who plan to take part in the Nov. 5 elections outnumbering
people younger than 30 by more than 2 to 1, creating a distorted
national politics in which the issues that dominate campaigns and
Capitol Hill reflect an ever-smaller slice of the country.</LD>
<LD>   This underrepresentation of young voters is becoming more acute:
If current trends continue, the number of people 65 and older who
vote in midterm elections is likely to exceed that of young adults by
a 4-to-1 ratio by 2022.</LD>
<LD>   These findings emerge from a study conducted by the Washington
Post, the Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation and Harvard University,
which surveyed the political beliefs and behavior of Americans of
different ages and created a forecast of future elections based on
population patterns and voting habits.</LD>
<TE>   The study shows that young adults hold beliefs distinct from those
of their parents and grandparents -- more conservative in many of
their views of government, more tolerant in many of their social
values -- and yet are not expressing them at the polls.</TE>
<TE>   The net effect is an accelerating cycle of political
disengagement. "If young people don't vote, their issues don't get
addressed, which further diminishes their incentive to participate in
the process and keeps the downward spiral going," said Thomas
Patterson, a Harvard political scientist.</TE>
<TE>   Disaffected and relatively nonpartisan, the country's 45 million
young adults are a constituency-in-waiting -- if candidates could
capture their imagination. But in the final weeks before the next
elections, attempts to capitalize on the potential young vote are
rare.</TE>
<TE>   The themes that politicians are emphasizing this season are
evident in the advertisements that Wichita, Kan., residents see on
television for their local congressional race. Rep. Todd Tiahrt
(R-Kan.) has used an ad in which the congressman walks through a
hospital corridor as he tells voters, "I'm working to secure
prescription drug coverage for seniors, just like we fought to
protect their Social Security, their Medicare and their retirement
savings." His Democratic challenger, attorney Carlos Nolla, is airing
an ad in which an elderly man and woman sit at a table criticizing
the incumbent. "The idea to invest Social Security money in the stock
market," she says, "could've wiped us out."</TE>
<TE>   Those ads reflect a basic political axiom: Campaign funds are used
to target people who are going to vote.</TE>
