<HD>Happy Birthday, AC: 100 Years of Playing It Cool</HD>
<DH>When the mercury rises, air-conditioning spells major
relief. Yet it was invented for paper, not people.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The man you should be thanking today, and tomorrow and pretty much
every day from now until sometime in October, is Willis Carrier. He's
the reason beach traffic isn't worse than it is and the urban death
toll rises less dramatically during summer months. He's why computers
can exist, why the Sistine Chapel should last a few more centuries,
why there are bananas for breakfast and chocolate bars after lunch,
why there's such a thing as a summer blockbuster.</LD>
<LD>   He made summer school possible and the summer workweek longer, but
we won't hold that against him because 100 years ago today, Carrier
invented air-conditioning, and if that seems like a small thing, just
imagine life without it.</LD>
<LD>   "He's right up there with Salk and Edison and Henry Ford," says
Jon Shaw, senior manager of communications for the Carrier company,
named for its founder and still the country's largest
air-conditioning manufacturer. "But most people don't know who he is
or what he's done. Everyone just takes air-conditioning for granted."</LD>
<TE>   Certainly by mid-July, most Americans take air-conditioning for
granted. As the temperature rises in June, everyone notices the AC.
It's hard not to. Folks entering malls and corporate towers and movie
theaters are met with a sudden glacial back-draft. Women wander
through the office place in search of sweaters, blowing on their
hands. "It's not that hot," they mutter, scurrying outside for a few
minutes just to warm up.</TE>
<TE>   But by mid-July, in almost every region of the country, it is
indeed that hot, and the heat's settling back on its haunches,
planning to stay awhile. During these dog days, air-conditioning
becomes just another utility, like water and electricity--necessary
and constant, a forgotten blessing (until the power goes).</TE>
<TE>   So it seems fitting that the 100th anniversary of the invention of
air-conditioning is July 17, a day in which temperatures in Southern
California are expected to reach the upper 80s and as high as the
upper 90s elsewhere in the nation. To mark this birthday, no doubt,
most of the more than 80% of American homes and 90% of businesses
that have some form of air-conditioning will set the dials somewhere
between high and arctic blast. And if people complain that it's too
cold inside, well, they can go sit on the front stoop like folks did
in the old days.</TE>
<TE>   "I know work got done back then," says Shaw, from Carrier's
Syracuse offices, "but it's 90 degrees out there, and right now I'd
rather be sitting here comfortable than literally sweating over my
desk."</TE>
<TE>   Air-conditioning was, in fact, invented to solve the detrimental
effects of heat in the workplace, but not for the benefit of humans.
In 1902, a Brooklyn printing company was having trouble keeping paper
stable during the summer--the heat and humidity changed its
dimensions, so the images printed fuzzy and out of whack. Carrier,
then a 25-year-old mechanical engineer, designed a system to control
the temperature and humidity around the printing press.</TE>
<TE>   Four years later, engineers used Carrier's system to "condition"
the air at a cotton mill in North Carolina. Although the name
"air-conditioning" stuck, it wasn't until 1914 that anyone tried to
use the technique to make people, rather than paper or fiber, more
comfortable; Minneapolis millionaire Charles Gates commissioned the
first home system.</TE>
<TE>   In 1922, Carrier developed the centrifugal refrigeration system,
and two years later, J.L. Hudson, a Detroit department store,
installed it in the bargain basement so sales could continue through
the summer. Then, in 1925, Grauman's Chinese Theatre in L.A. and the
Rivoli Theater in New York decided to cool down that flickering dark,
and the rest is history.</TE>
<TE>   History in the literal sense. Last month, the Smithsonian Press
published the first cultural history of air-conditioning: "Cool
Comfort: America's Romance With Air-Conditioning," by Marsha
Ackermann, a lecturer in history at East Michigan University.
Ackerman, who grew up in Carrier's hometown of Buffalo, is interested
in things that Americans take for granted. "I wanted to show that
air-conditioning wasn't this miraculous technology that was invented
and then everyone had it."</TE>
<TE>   In the beginning, she discovered, AC was a hard sell. It was
expensive and it was newfangled. Business owners would invest in
equipment if it improved the productivity of their machinery; they
were not at all interested in the comfort of their workers.
Air-conditioning was often used to increase the heat. The term, and
the technology, Ackermann explains, was not originally synonymous
with cool; it was simply a way of controlling temperature and
humidity.</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't until after World War I that anyone in the burgeoning
industry thought to expand its horizons by defining coolness not only
as the epitome of comfort but as a sign of intellectual and physical
superiority. For hundreds of years, Ackermann writes, the Nordic
races had considered the endurance of colder climes to be an
achievement, indicative of their racial prowess. People from warmer
climes were considered slower-witted, their brains having gone
languid in the perpetual sunshine.</TE>
<TE>   In early campaigns for air-conditioning, these beliefs were
exploited. If employers were not impressed by the thought of a more
comfortable workforce, they were a bit more taken with the image of a
smarter, more productive one.</TE>
<TE>   But movie palaces increased the popularity of air-conditioning
more than any ad campaign. Even in these days of almost universal
air-conditioning, people find sanctuary in the theater during the
summer months. In the 1920s, there was no other place like it on
Earth. "Relax in Cooool Comfort," the signs would tempt; the Rivoli
guaranteed "always 69 degrees."</TE>
<TE>   As air-conditioning became more widespread--by the 1950s, it was
fairly common in homes--it became a favorite target of social critics
and bohemians.</TE>
<TE>   "Henry Miller saw it as a symbol of the bland conformity of
American life," says Ackermann. "He wrote a book called 'Air
Conditioned Nightmare.' Other people have connected it to the
isolation of the new suburbia--people stayed cool in their houses
rather than gathering on the front porch."</TE>
<TE>   Ackermann doesn't think air-conditioning should take the rap for
suburban malaise--television, she says, probably has more to do with
it--but she says universal availability of air-conditioning has
changed Americans' relationship to heat, both literally and as
metaphor. As she points out in her book, heat is a time-honored
literary device, a catalyst and symbol of simmering hatred, passion,
oppression, all manner of things that often led to acts of
violence--or great sex. From "Cat on a Hot Tin Roof" to "In the Heat
of the Night" the steamy summer heat is as much a character as any of
the people.</TE>
<TE>   "[Jay] Gatsby is murdered on the hottest day of the year,"
Ackermann says. "[The movie] 'Body Heat' would be nothing if not for
the sweltering weather. Gore Vidal lamented the demise of
pre-air-conditioned Washington, with its slow moving overhead fans.
No doubt a certain atmosphere has been lost. But," she adds, "if you
need your characters to be hot, you can still take them outside."</TE>
<TE>   In exchange for the hypnotic image of those slow-moving fans, she
says, we have gained virtually everything that has come to mean
modern society. Without air-conditioning, there would be no
high-rises, no glass towers, no windowless offices. "We'd have no
computers," she says, "because computers require a consistent
temperature and level of humidity, which is also necessary for a lot
of scientific research, particularly in the pharmaceutical industry."</TE>
<TE>   Our diet would be different without AC--tropical fruits, such as
bananas, do better in air-conditioned, rather than refrigerated,
conditions and all those chocolate bars stashed in desk drawers and
vending machines would be gooey puddles in the summer months. Ancient
paintings and works of art would deteriorate faster without climate
control--the Sistine Chapel got a specially designed system just a
few years ago.</TE>
<TE>   But if early fears that air-conditioning shock--that initial
skin-crawling moment after stepping into or out of a chilled
building--would lead to widespread disease have been proved mistaken,
the drain on public utilities has not. Where once power companies
welcomed air-conditioning as ballast to the hump that occurred during
winter months, now they view July with trepidation. An attempt in the
1970s by President Jimmy Carter to force Americans to moderate their
energy use by setting thermostats no lower than 78 degrees was a
complete failure.</TE>
<TE>   More recently, air-conditioning exacerbated the crisis that led to
the brownouts and blackouts in Southern California last year, and now
many power companies are looking at ways to regulate
air-conditioners, to lower them even by a few degrees during peak
usage periods. At Carrier, the latest technology would allow
homeowners and utilities to either preset temperatures throughout the
day or change them through remote control. So far, Shaw says, the
company is working with San Diego Gas &amp; Electric, Con Edison in New
York, Long Island Power and a few others.</TE>
<TE>   "It allows homeowners to turn off the air when they're not there
and then turn it back on just before they come home," he says. "Which
alone can save you a few hundred bucks a year. But utilities can also
turn a whole grid down a degree or two during peak times, which
people probably wouldn't even notice."</TE>
<TE>   All of which should add yet another facet to the remote-control
war between the sexes. According to Shaw, the only complaints people
have with air-conditioning is that it's either too cold or not cold
enough. And although there has been no formal study of the gender
breakdown, after eight years in the biz, Shaw says invariably it's
women who are too cold and men who are too hot.</TE>
<TE>   "Don't ask me why," he says, laughing. "I don't even want to
guess."</TE>
<TE>   Ackermann, who tends to be too cold, says even she's grateful for
the chill blast on days when the thermometer tops 90. But, she says,
even then, air-conditioning is not right for every venue. "The
Houston Astrodome was an achievement of air-conditioning technology,"
she says, "but it was not a success. People want to experience the
outdoors at a ballpark, including the sweaty people."</TE>

<LD>People settled into the velvety seats of the Skirball Cultural Center
theater early, enjoying the cool, dark reprieve from the suffocating
heat blanketing the hills outside. They arrived in sundresses and
barbecue wear to hear Los Angeles writers read their stories and
essays, several of which offered irreverent takes on Hollywood life.</LD>
<LD>   Poet and novelist Carol Muske-Dukes took the stage first, warning
the audience: "Please don't cough." (The late-afternoon
performance--presented by L.A. Theatre Works and Spoken
Interludes--was being recorded for radio broadcast on XM Satellite
Radio and KPCC (89.3 FM). Her essay "Married to the Ice Pick Killer"
was an excerpt from her upcoming book. Muske-Dukes, who was married
for 17 years to actor David Dukes until his death in 2000, called
acting the "proactive search for psychosis." "Living with an actor is
like living with someone who keeps getting kidnapped and longs to be
kidnapped," she read, describing her husband's agonizing wait for
roles followed by long shoots around the world away from home.</LD>
<TE>   In "Magic Hour," writer Erika Schickel explored the thoughts of an
aspiring actress, so conflicted about her move to L.A. from N.Y. that
she seeks comfort in the wares of her marijuana dealer. Unlike the
young girls with blond ponytails that her N.Y. friends call
"snacktresses," Schickel's character wants to be an "actor," a title
she prefers because it shows "seriousness of purpose in the craft."
Actress and writer Ann Magnuson performed "You Oughta Be in
Pictures," a story narrated by an actress bemoaning her career
choice, which often seems like "an ongoing performance art project."
She's weary of being typecast as the evil woman and feels conflicted
about her breakout role in a big-budget Bruce Willis movie. "I just
hate Bruce Willis, that Planet Hollywood, harmonica-sucking slime,"
she read. "Of course, I'm not above being in a Bruce Willis
movie...."</TE>
<TE>   Fallen Heroes</TE>
<TE>   "You look so much like Helen Hunt," a woman was saying to
playwright Anne Nelson after the gala premiere of Nelson's "The Guys"
at the Actors' Gang in Hollywood on Saturday night. The play stars
Hunt as a journalist who meets a New York fire captain, played by Tim
Robbins, in the aftermath of Sept. 11, and helps him write eulogies
for eight of his men lost in the destruction of the twin towers.
Nelson, who slightly resembles the actress, smiled.</TE>
<TE>   "The Guys" came about when a director, Jim Simpson, asked Nelson
to convert her real-life experience helping a fire captain compose
eulogies. It was first staged at the Flea Theatre in New York, with
Bill Murray and Sigourney Weaver. It continues indefinitely, with a
cast change every three weeks, at the Actors' Gang in Hollywood. The
gala was attended by a host of celebrities, including Matthew Perry,
Susan Sarandon, Philip Baker Hall, Dermot Mulroney, Diane Lane and
Bryan Lourd.</TE>

<HD>Now Will She Tell All?</HD>
<DH>Ex-madam Jody 'Babydol' Gibson has a TV movie in
development and is angling for a talk show and book deal</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBERT W. WELKOS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When the world last saw Jody "Babydol" Gibson, the aspiring pop star
was headed to prison, a consequence of her secret sideline: running
an international call-girl ring that catered to the rich and famous.</LD>
<LD>   Now, fresh from 22 months behind bars, she's coming at Hollywood
in a new way, with a "Babydol" movie for television, a late-night
talk show in development and, although she doesn't yet have a
publisher, she's writing a book about her secret life.</LD>
<LD>   Whether it will be a tell-all book remains to be seen,
particularly when it comes to divulging the names of the high-powered
entertainment figures in her infamous trick book. "Let's just say
it's a big maybe, with a capital M," she said.</LD>
<TE>   You might think it would be dicey going back to Hollywood--where
so many of her former clients still hold power--but she said she has
managed to avoid them. "Whatever business I am doing now has nothing
to do with any of my clients," she said. "They are just
straight-ahead network and studio projects." Besides, she adds, her
former clients produced feature films, not TV shows. "I don't know
network people."</TE>
<TE>   To get her ventures off the ground, she has joined forces with her
younger sister, Amy Gibson, an actress who once starred on "Love of
Life," "General Hospital" and "The Young and the Restless."</TE>
<TE>   A script that Amy Gibson helped develop, titled "The Babydol
Story: The Price of Fame," is being developed for the USA Networks
cable network by Jaffe/ Braunstein Films Ltd., a production company
that recently made the ABC movie "Gilda Radner: It's Always
Something."</TE>
<TE>   Amy Gibson also has been pitching the syndicated talk-show idea to
executives in L.A. and New York.</TE>
<TE>   Before she began shopping the project to producers, she said, a
"very prominent guy in Hollywood" took her aside and asked, "Can I
ask you a quick favor? Before we go in to pitch this, could I at
least ask you to ask your sister if they're in the [trick] book, so
I'm not embarrassed when we're in the meeting?"</TE>
<TE>   "I had to go, 'Wow, OK,' " Amy Gibson said.</TE>
<TE>   Burt Kearns, a producer for "Hard Copy" and "A Current Affair"
whose book "Tabloid Baby" gave an insider's look at the advent of
tabloid TV, said Babydol Gibson joins a long line of people who have
tried to capitalize on a brush with fame.</TE>
<TE>   "If you pick a notorious personality who made it big through
scandal or malfeasance, you find they cash in," Kearns said. "That is
the way of life in Hollywood and in American culture.... There used
to be a thing called notoriety and shame. We don't have that
anymore."</TE>
<TE>   As evidence, he points to the recent Fox television special
"Celebrity Boxing," which pitted scandal-tarred ice skater Tonya
Harding in one corner against Paula Jones, who accused Bill Clinton
of sexual harassment, in the other. And the only reason Jones was in
the ring was because another tabloid character, "Long Island Lolita"
Amy Fisher, couldn't get permission from her parole officer to leave
New York for the taping.</TE>
<TE>   "I think there came a point in our culture and in our society
where people stopped differentiating between accomplishment and
celebrity," Kearns said. "So this is Babydol's chance to be in the
spotlight."</TE>
<TE>   But as far as the late-night talk show is concerned, the odds are
against her, said Bill Carroll, a programming consultant with Katz
Television Group in New York. Of the 150 to 200 talk shows that
receive serious discussions each year, he said, maybe 15 at most make
it on the air.</TE>
<TE>   Still, he doesn't count her out. "I never say never because none
of us could ever have predicted Ozzy Osbourne," Carroll said,
referring to the heavy-metal rocker whose MTV series, "The
Osbournes," has been an unexpected ratings winner.</TE>
<TE>   Gibson, a petite, 44-year-old ex-New Yorker with blond hair and a
gift for gab, knows better than most the long odds of achieving
stardom.</TE>
<TE>   During the years she was operating her escort service, Gibson also
tried to make it as a pop star. She once purchased space on a huge
billboard along Sunset Boulevard to promote her debut single, a
self-penned dance track called "Good Girls Go to Heaven, Bad Girls Go
Everywhere." But the song flopped, and the billboard vanished. In
all, Gibson recorded a single, a five-song track and an album.</TE>
<TE>   Her 1999 arrest by an undercover officer disguised as a wealthy
Middle Eastern businessman made headlines rivaling the infamous case
of another Hollywood madam, Heidi Fleiss.</TE>
<TE>   One of the more explosive aspects of the Babydol case revolved
around her logbook containing the names of more than 100 clients,
including actors, producers and wealthy businessmen. The men shelled
out $1,000 an hour for women supplied by Gibson's escort service, and
she pocketed 40% of the proceeds.</TE>
<TE>   Her clients' names were not divulged publicly at trial.</TE>
<TE>   When police raided her home, they also discovered a book treatment
Gibson had been writing. In it, she described a torrid affair with an
unnamed Beverly Hills police detective, whom she claimed played a
crucial role in shielding her during earlier investigations.
Prosecutors discount the story.</TE>
<TE>   Describing her as "tragic and pathetic," Los Angeles Superior
Court Judge Lloyd M. Nash sentenced Gibson to three years in state
prison after a jury convicted her on three counts of felony pimping.
A federal court later gave her 18 months for tax evasion.</TE>
<TE>   Amy Gibson said that she didn't know of her sister's double life
until the arrest but that when she read the book treatment discovered
during the police raid, she realized that it was the genesis of a
good story.</TE>
<TE>   It was, she said, the tale of a woman who led a "007" secret life
while playing four distinct roles: She was "Sasha," the Hollywood
madam; "Babydol," the aspiring pop star; "Sheri," the escort service
secretary; and "Heather," a disguised voice on the phone, checking on
clients.</TE>
<TE>   Howard Braunstein, who is developing the made-for-TV movie for USA
Networks, said he has no intention of "doing a sort of tawdry story
about prostitution. What interests me much more is a character study,
what makes her tick," he said. "I have no interest in doing a film
about Hollywood and prostitution.</TE>
<TE>   "I think [Gibson] is a tragic figure," he added. "I think she is a
woman who went to great lengths for her dream--she wanted to be a big
musical star, the next Madonna, and it didn't happen."</TE>
<TE>   Deputy Dist. Atty. Richard F. Walmark, who prosecuted Gibson,
doesn't share Braunstein's enthusiasm for the proposed TV movie. "I
wouldn't be interested in seeing it," Walmark said. "Maybe I would
change my mind if George Clooney played the role of the prosecutor,"
he quipped, then added: "In terms of the actual story, I would not
[want to see it]. I know what happened. Basically, she was pimping
and pandering."</TE>
<TE>   For her part, Gibson maintains that her punishment far exceeded
the crime. "I never said I didn't do what I was charged with doing,"
she said. "But I don't think it warranted a three-year prison
sentence."</TE>
<TE>   Gibson calls the months she spent at Chowchilla "hellacious,"
questioning why prison officials housed her with more serious
offenders, including murderers, which led to an attack by other
inmates.</TE>
<TE>   "I was locked in a room by three girls and jumped and beat up, and
they knocked my teeth out and I had two black eyes and I was rushed
to the hospital," she recalled over lunch at a Beverly Hills
restaurant. "I had a fractured skull.... I should never have been
interned there."</TE>
<TE>   Margot Bach, a spokeswoman for the California Department of
Corrections, confirmed that Gibson was battered by another female
inmate Oct. 15. Responding to Gibson's assertion that she never
should have been housed with serious offenders, Bach explained that
each of California's four women's prisons--unlike the men's
institutions--house all levels of prisoners in the same facility.</TE>
<TE>   Gibson, who now sports a perfect smile, said she wants to host a
talk show to discuss controversial topics such as prostitution and
conditions in the state and federal prison systems.</TE>
<TE>   "Jody is not stupid," her sister said. "She's articulate and one
of the most erudite women I know, and with the command of the English
language that she has, it is never going to be a show that is going
to be risque." But she's not ruling out an eye-catching talk show
set. Amy Gibson said her sister has suggested a novel decorating
touch: a couch shaped like a pair of lips.</TE>

<DH>A Bastille Day celebration in Long Beach cheers homesick
French ex-pats</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CINDY CHANG</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Imagine celebrating the Fourth of July in a foreign country--France,
say. You attend a party thrown by the American Chamber of Commerce
for expatriates. It's not quite like back home. The hamburgers look
lonely in a vast expanse of bun devoid of ketchup and mustard. The
beer is of European extraction--no Bud Lite or Rolling Rock in sight.
And the music that fills the air during the fireworks display is not
"The Star-Spangled Banner" but "La Marseillaise."</LD>
<LD>   Would you stomp away in a huff, deriding the experience as
inauthentic and vowing never to return? Likely not. For the homesick
ex-pat, any reminder of home is usually a welcome one, as the natives
of France who celebrated Bastille Day on Saturday night in front of
the Queen Mary in Long Beach tended to agree.</LD>
<LD>   "It's nice to hear French music, hear the French language, see
French kids running around," said Philippe Tilikete, who left his
native Paris six years ago for a job in Los Angeles' animation
industry. "On any holiday, it's hard being away from home."</LD>
<TE>   Jerome Gregeois, another Frenchman, said that while there were
differences between the Long Beach celebration and the one at home,
the main ingredients--food, music and fireworks--were there.
Party-goers elbowed their way through the crowds carrying golden
slabs of quiche, banquettes filled with ham, cheese or sausage and
pissaladiere (an anchovy tart). The edibles were "not the best French
food I've ever had," Gregeois said, but, he added, the street cuisine
in France rarely soars to great gastronomic heights.</TE>
<TE>   Bastille Eve and Day in France center around community and
champagne. "You go out with friends, have a good meal at lunch, go
out into the streets ... and finish in a bar," said Valerie Sornette,
who moved to Los Angeles from France three months ago.</TE>
<TE>   The day commemorates the storming of a state prison by an angry
crowd on July 14, 1789, and it symbolizes the overthrow of the gilded
reign of Louis XVI and Marie Antoinette and the beginning of the
French Republic.</TE>
<TE>   The Long Beach celebration, organized by the French American
Chamber of Commerce, took place in a parking lot rather than in a
picturesque town square, but it achieved the bustle of a proper
street fair as the evening wore on. Chanteuses belted out French
standards with the intensity of Edith Piaf, while Norm Panto, in a
blue beret, weaved through the crowds playing his accordion.</TE>
<TE>   Only California wines were served--not a French one to be
sipped--but the crowd managed to get plenty happy anyway. Many had no
ties to France but came to party under the Queen Mary's giant orange
smokestacks. Two Frenchmen in the crowd weren't fazed by the
incongruous event, where even the fireworks boomed to the "The Battle
Hymn of the Republic" before edging into a contemporary French reggae
beat. Said Bruno Clement, the owner of a garment business who came to
the U.S. from France eight years ago, "We have to accept that in L.A.
we're a mix of both cultures."</TE>

<LD>THE EXTINCTION CLUB</LD>
<LD>   By Robert Twigger</LD>
<LD>   William Morrow</LD>
<TE>   222 pages, $23.95</TE>
<TE>   For every book we read, there are at least two stories lurking
within the covers: the tale the author intended from the outset to
write, and the book that actually resulted. If the author is writing
nonfiction, the choices of how to tell the story are extensive, but
open the door to fabrication, and the possibilities become nearly
endless.</TE>
<TE>   As readers, we're usually aware of only the completed work,
blissfully unconcerned about the many permutations that took place
between the book's conception and its final birth as a published
volume.</TE>
<TE>   British author and adventure journalist Robert Twigger ("Big
Snake: The Hunt for the World's Longest Python") succeeds with "The
Extinction Club" in giving us a number of morphing story lines in one
slim, yet amazingly cohesive volume.</TE>
<TE>   A mostly nonfiction exploration into the near-extinction and
miraculous rescue of the exotic Milu deer, "The Extinction Club" also
reveals the messy, often contradictory process of an author stumbling
his way through to a sustained narrative, using fact, fibs and
whatever it takes, while bringing the reader along on his quest.</TE>
<TE>   Focused on the concept of extinction, the tale is multitiered. One
layer follows Twigger's life as a struggling writer when a phone call
changes his life with the offer of a lucrative book contract. "I'd
been fantasizing about this phone call for 10 years," he tells us. "
... THE PHONE CALL that will CHANGE YOUR LIFE WITH MONEY." In tracing
his own writing life, Twigger highlights the evolutionary process,
creating a kind of survival-of-the-fittest scenario in the realm of
book creation.</TE>
<TE>   He's asked to write a book on the Milu deer (also known as Pere
David), an animal so rare that it's been extinct in its native China
since the Boxer Rebellion of 1900 but has survived in pockets around
the world. Most notably, the deer can be killed for a price, he tells
us, at a Texas wild game preserve.</TE>
<TE>   The odd-looking mammal (neck of a camel, horns of a stag, tail of
a donkey and feet of a cow) once belonged solely to the Chinese
emperor in Beijing who kept a number of the deer hidden for 1,000
years in a walled retreat and insisted that his staff keep secret the
deer's existence.</TE>
<TE>   In 1865, the hidden species was "discovered" by a Basque
missionary priest, Pere David (from which the species takes one of
its common names), who shipped deer remains to zoologists in Paris.
Soon, a number of European nations had nabbed a deer or two of their
own, and an eccentric English nobleman, the 11th Duke of Bedford,
helped deer thrive in Bedfordshire, where today there is a sizable
herd.</TE>
<TE>   In short chapters that sometimes seem non sequiturs, Twigger
ushers readers deep into the adventure of the Milu deer, paralleling
their near extinction with the demise and tentative reawakening of
Egypt's Ezbekiya Gardens, a massive Cairo market for secondhand
books, while illustrating the harrowing endeavor of writing a book.</TE>
<TE>   He uses data, conjecture, a hefty measure of humor and
philosophical ramblings to question the boundaries between truth and
invention. (If you've ever been to the wonderful Museum of Jurassic
Technology in Culver City, this is a similar experience, though more
weighted to the factual.)</TE>
<TE>   Artfully, Twigger ties the postmodern tale together with the
thinnest of filament--but it's enough. We're invited to collect the
puzzle pieces he drops along the way and assemble in our own minds a
concept of extinction that is vaster, perhaps, than we had
considered.</TE>
<TE>   Though we do learn about the deer, of primary concern to Twigger
is an investigation into what dying out means to us as a species, we
who hold the potential to annihilate ourselves.</TE>
<TE>   It's less our physical demise that is cause for concern, Twigger
suggests, than the slow, insidious death of consciousness among
humans, the numbing that takes place in our consumer-minded,
entertainment-obsessed world, which he sees as a precursor of the
ultimate snuffing out. "Hope, self-belief, natural wonder: all these
can be switched off, year by year, and slowly the individual becomes
extinct."</TE>
<TE>   There's optimism, too. Researching the precarious rejuvenation of
the deer, Twigger sees in their tenacity a reflection of what he
hopes will be the perseverance of books, of writers, of ourselves.</TE>
<TE>   Much of the gravity is cloaked in humor, as in this description of
a road-trip companion: "It's easy to travel with someone who has both
sheepish and impish grins in his repertoire." But the narrative is
still pensive and deep.</TE>
<TE>   Twigger encourages readers, in this book within a book within a
book, to draw personal correlations among the lives of deer, books,
writers and ourselves and to look our own extinction in the eye.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps it's not so much the deer and other endangered species we
should be concerned with saving, he suggests. "All along it is not
animals that have been most at risk, but ourselves, our innermost
selves."</TE>

<HD>President Appeals to Our Thirst for Metaphor</HD>
<DH>Bush's bingeing/hangover speech about the economy will
resonate with the public, some experts say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARTIN MILLER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sometimes it's difficult explaining things to the American people,
especially when it comes to complex topics such as the economy. But
President Bush made plain Monday the reason behind the sad state of
the U.S. stock market, which recently hit a five-year low: It's the
bingeing, stupid.</LD>
<LD>   "America must get rid of the hangover that we now have as a result
of the binge, the economic binge, we just went through," Bush told
business leaders at the University of Alabama at Birmingham on
Monday.</LD>
<LD>   As metaphors go, Bush could have scarcely invoked one that
resonated more with the American people, no strangers to the
mood-altering substance.</LD>
<TE>   "It's language people understand," said James Twitchell, a
professor of English at the University of Florida. "We're fiercely
puritanical about drugs, but alcohol somehow made it through the
sieve. We think of it as being the mother's milk of drugs.</TE>
<TE>   "In fact, the analogy is made all the more poignant by a guy who
has gone dry," Twitchell added.</TE>
<TE>   This isn't the first time a U.S. president has used the alcohol
metaphor in reference to the economy. Both Gerald Ford and Ronald
Reagan made similar comparisons during their tenures, said Frederick
J. Antczak, a University of Iowa professor who has studied
presidential rhetoric. Presidents also have been fond of comparing a
bad economy to an overheated engine, Antczak said.</TE>
<TE>   "The hangover talk is common anytime there's a gust in the economy
that slows things down," he said. "Presidents feel the populous is
acquainted with this, and they are usually right."</TE>
<TE>   Exactly why the president thought Americans would understand a
comparison based on alcohol consumption is open to debate.</TE>
<TE>   It could be Bush was familiar with recent U.S. census figures that
put the average American alcohol consumption at more than 36 gallons
per year. According to those statistics, the average American tosses
back about 10 more gallons a year of beer, wine and distilled spirits
than he does coffee.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, it could have been his own family history with alcohol.
Bush has acknowledged alcohol-related problems in his past that
included an arrest for driving under the influence when he was 30. He
gave up drinking, he has said, after his 40th birthday. Meanwhile,
both of his daughters were ticketed for underage drinking last year.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever the inspiration, debt counselors applauded the sentiment.</TE>
<TE>   "I think he's right on," said Ray Cooper, the education director
at the Consumer Credit Counseling Service, a national nonprofit
organization that helps people get out of debt.</TE>
<TE>   "The whole nation got intoxicated from the boom era of the last
eight years, and I think a lot of people thought it was never going
to end. Well, it did, and we have a serious headache."</TE>
<TE>   But those who treat and study addictive behavior and alcohol abuse
think Bush's alcohol metaphor was off base.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not sure that's an appropriate comparison," said Norman
Hoffmann, an associate professor at Brown University who studies
alcohol addiction. "If we're talking about a stock market tanking in
response to scandal after scandal where investors are continually
lied to, then it seems to me a realistic reaction based on a loss of
confidence in leadership in corporate America more than it is someone
overindulging or having a hangover."</TE>

<LD>Carla, a double yellow-headed Amazon parrot, has cut her first CD.</LD>
<LD>   "Bird Beat" will be the third album to be released by Laurel
Canyon Animal Co., whose other titles include "Cat-a-Tonic" and "Ugly
Dogs Need More Love."</LD>
<LD>   In a universe with a cable TV channel devoted to animal antics and
a job market for pet psychics, should it be surprising that there is
a record label for animals?</LD>
<TE>   Music producers Skip Haynes and Dana Walden started the company
for fun, writing about their own and neighbors' pets. What they've
ended up with is a label, attached to Quicksilver Records, of
original music inspired by the relationship between animals and their
humans.</TE>
<TE>   Haynes and Walden, neighbors in Laurel Canyon, had been searching
for the perfect bird vocalist to sign to their label when they read
about Carla the parrot in an article on bird clubs in The Times in
March. Carla's vocal tour de force (and favorite refrain) is
"Zippety-do-dah, I'm a green chicken," in the fashion of Ethel
Merman.</TE>
<TE>   Haynes and Walden, who had previously auditioned three birds,
realized Carla could be a major talent discovery and lost no time in
getting her signed. Her rendition, with Haynes, of the green chicken
song (an excerpt can be heard at www.petradio.com) is the lead cut on
"Bird Beat," and it is being released nationally as a single this
month.</TE>
<TE>   Lorrie Mitchell, Carla's owner and constant companion, says she's
not at all surprised by her parrot's success. "She's always had it in
her. She has the most amazing personality," says Mitchell, "even at
an early age she had the crowd eating from her feet."</TE>
<TE>   Haynes and Walden, who have worked with such mega talents as Buddy
Miles, the Grateful Dead and Bonnie Raitt, said they were very
impressed with Carla's professionalism her first time out. "She was
pretty cool," says Haynes, "she did the whole session in just two
takes and about 17 minutes--including warmup!"</TE>
<TE>   Never having signed a bird to a recording contract, the producers
wanted to do everything by the book. Walden contacted friend and
colleague Dean Kay, an American Society of Composers, Authors and
Publishers board member, to say they were signing Carla and wanted to
see about getting her registered as songwriter with ASCAP for royalty
payments.</TE>
<TE>   Walden says Kay's initial response was "don't do this to me,'" but
he agreed to check into it. He presented the idea of Carla's being
ASCAP's first songwriting parrot to the society's senior management
and legal department. She wasn't immediately accepted, but the idea
might be revisited "when she gets a Social Security number," Kay
says.</TE>
<TE>   Carla, 16, is one of six parrots in Mitchell's L.A. household.
Mitchell, who is a preschool teacher, has taken her to local schools
to help students learn about exotic birds. Carla's favorite food is
pizza, though she's under vet's orders to follow a fat-free diet
until she loses some extra ounces.</TE>
<TE>   Once in the studio, Carla, like any diva, had special requests.
Since it was her first recording session, Haynes asked Lorrie what
would make Carla most comfortable. Lorrie responded "a brunet." It
seems Carla prefers brunets to perch on while she sings (Mitchell is
blond). Haynes and Walden found a dark-haired woman, and things
worked out as Mitchell had predicted. Standing on the shoulder of
Walden's sister Amber Nunez (who got assistant producer credit on the
record as a result), Carla sang her little heart out.</TE>
<TE>   Haynes, whose lead vocals dovetail with Carla's on the single "I'm
a Green Chicken," says he felt odd at first singing a duet with a
parrot but quickly got over it when he heard how well it came out.
Mitchell says she was also surprised it came out as well as it did,
"Carla's sense of melody isn't exactly the same as ours," she
observed.</TE>
<TE>   If "I'm a Green Chicken" is a hit, there will be more to come:
Carla also reportedly does a mean version of "Somewhere Over the
Rainbow." The next stop for Carla? "TV appearances," says Haynes. But
Mitchell worries, "I just hope all of this doesn't go to her yellow
head." Meanwhile, Haynes and Walden are working on their next
project. It will involve Koko the gorilla.</TE>

<LD>Katsinam</LD>
<LD>   You may recognize this object as a "kachina" doll, but it's really
called a tihu (doll) and represents a Katsina  spirit. A Native
American Hopi artist created it.</LD>
<LD>   Katsinam (the plural of Katsina) are kind spirit beings that are
important to Hopi religious beliefs. There are about 400
Katsinam--the spirit beings of things such as the sun, clouds and
animals.</LD>
<TE>   Tithu (dolls) are special gifts for Hopi girls and baby boys.
Traditionally, the first doll that Hopi babies receive is Happy
Mother, representing the goodness of motherhood. As girls get older,
they are given more dolls at ceremonies, and young girls often play
with the dolls or hang them on a wall at home.</TE>
<TE>   Traditional tithu made by Hopi artists are carved from the root of
a cottonwood tree. Today Katsinam are very popular, and many people,
both Hopi and non-Hopi, make objects inspired by them. Katsina-like
images also appear in paintings and on baskets, gourds and jewelry
and can be made from bronze, clay, silver or cloth. You can even find
images painted on buildings, and on T-shirts, key chains and
Christmas tree ornaments.</TE>
<TE>   This Qoqlo tihu was made in 1995 by Hopi artist H. Tewa. When the
black Qoqlo shown here speaks, he means the opposite of what he says.
If he says, "It's not a good day," he means that it is a beautiful,
pleasant day. This opposite talk is an indication of his spiritual
nature.</TE>
<TE>   You can see this tihu and many more at the UCLA Fowler Museum of
Cultural History, and even make your own Katsina-inspired paper doll.
The exhibition "KATSINA/Kachina: Tradition, Appropriation,
Innovation" opens Aug. 4 with a children's art workshop, live music
and refreshments. The exhibition continues through March 23, 2003.
The museum is free for visitors 17 and younger. For more information
and times, call (310) 825-4361 or visit www.fmch.ucla.edu.</TE>

<DH>What's Your Favorite Amusement Park Ride?</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Arlene Delaney's fifth-grade students at Oxnard Street Elementary in
North Hollywood like the following rides.</LD>
<LD>   * My favorite ride is Superman at Six Flags Magic Mountain. It
makes your stomach go round and round. It feels like your head is
going to crack, and your hair is blowing everywhere. (Magaly, 9)</LD>
<LD>   * My favorite ride is the Dragon at Legoland because it is not
that fast and it is fun for me. (Mitzie, 10)</LD>
<TE>   * My favorite ride is Back to the Future at Universal Studios.
When you get on it you start to feel like you are going to barf. It
is scary in the beginning. (Bryan, 10)</TE>
<TE>   * My favorite ride is Splash Mountain at Disneyland because it
gets you very wet, and it is very dark and scary. (Athziry, 9)</TE>
<TE>   * My favorite ride is Cliffhanger in Santa Monica. It makes my
head spin and looks like you are falling. (Michel, 10)</TE>
<TE>   * My favorite ride is Xcelerator at Knott's Berry Farm. This
roller coaster makes me feel like I have a knot in my stomach! When
the ride starts, it launches you rapidly out of the tunnel and then
you go straight up and straight down. After that comes a mind-bending
loop that makes you feel as if you are going to fall down. (Steffany,
10)</TE>
<TE>   * My favorite amusement park is Universal Studios Hollywood. I
like to watch the Spiderman show. Spiderman kills the Green Goblin. I
like it when Spiderman throws the web. (Christian, 10)</TE>
<TE>   * My favorite ride is a roller coaster called HammerHead at
Knott's Berry Farm. At first it seems scary to see other people ride
the loops, but once I'm on it, it's really fun! (Briana, 10)</TE>
<TE>   --Compiled by MARY ELLEN WALKER</TE>

<HD>It Happens --So Why Don't We Face It?</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Sandy Banks</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>I've never been body-slammed onto the hood of my car. Never been
spread-eagled and searched on the street or handcuffed and poked with
batons by police. I know enough people who have to know that it
happens, and not infrequently. But my encounters with police have
been uneventful and mercifully brief.</LD>
<LD>   In fact, my lone example of mistreatment is so insignificant as to
be laughable, in the face of our current controversy. But it opened a
window for me into the kind of attitudes that can lead to police
brutality, whether the victim is a teenager munching potato chips or
a fleeing suspect high on PCP.</LD>
<LD>   I was working "night cops" at police headquarters 25 years ago for
a Cleveland newspaper, reporting crime stories passed along by
police. I'd heard from my predecessor--a middle-aged white guy with
years on the beat--that the cops were kind and cooperative. But from
my very first night on the job, most were rude and contemptuous
toward me. They ignored my polite requests for information, rebuffed
my friendly overtures, greeted my presence with racist and sexist
jokes that seemed funny to everyone but me.</LD>
<TE>   After months of this I sought help from my editor, a black man
who'd spent years on that beat. What had I done to make these cops
dislike me, I asked him. Why were they so nice to others and so mean
to me?</TE>
<TE>   It's not you, he told me, but what you represent ... and what
their lives have taught them to expect. Back then, Cleveland was
dreadfully segregated, and most officers had been raised in white,
working-class neighborhoods, tightknit communities of first- and
second-generation Americans from places such as Poland and Croatia
and Italy.</TE>
<TE>   They go their whole lives and never meet a black person until they
join the police department, I recall my editor telling me. Then, most
of the blacks that they encounter are on the other end of handcuffs
or at the point of a gun. The life experiences of these officers give
them a way of looking at people that automatically puts folks like
you and me in the "criminal" category.</TE>
<TE>   That same attitude is what might have landed Donovan Jackson and
his dad in the criminal category, when police rolled up on their car
at a gas station in Inglewood, a city with a police force that is
mostly white and a populace that is overwhelmingly black and brown.</TE>
<TE>   Deputies reported that 16-year-old Donovan looked at them "with an
angered expression" when he saw them questioning his dad about his
expired auto registration. When they ordered the boy to stay away
from the car, he began "breathing hard" and "intently staring," they
said.</TE>
<TE>   But did that reflect anger or merely confusion? His family and
friends say the he suffers from speech and hearing problems that make
it difficult for him to understand commands and explanations. The
police didn't know that at the time, of course. Their inclination was
to regard his reluctance not as bewilderment but defiance.</TE>
<TE>   And it doesn't surprise me that when they closed in on him,
barking orders, Donovan struggled and resisted their efforts to take
him into custody. He has had life experiences too. And just as the
officers feared what he might do, his experiences may have convinced
him that whatever was about to happen at the hands of police could
only be bad news.</TE>
<TE>   In this case, both sets of expectations seem to have come true.</TE>
<TE>   In the 10 days since the videotape aired, complaints have been
pouring in from folks claiming that the cop Jeremy Morse, who punched
Jackson, has cursed, threatened or beat them too. Morse's lawyer says
that the alleged victims are merely trying to profit from the
publicity.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe, but the more likely reality is that they recognize that now
the videotape gives them credibility. Reporting police abuse is too
often like whistling in the wind. Complaints are made, then
disappear. We don't believe it until we see it on TV.</TE>
<TE>   My sister-in-law is a small, serious and soft-spoken college
professor, a product of Harvard, with a PhD. Ten years ago, she led
the procession at her college graduation with bruises on her face
from an encounter with police.</TE>
<TE>   The night before, she'd been stopped in Boston as she dropped a
classmate off at a housing project. Her license tags were from out of
state, her registration had expired. Police ordered her out of the
car, and when she asked why, an officer grabbed her, pushed her up
against her car and slammed her face into the roof. Just as in
Inglewood, two more cars arrived as "backup." She was handcuffed and
hauled off to jail, ostensibly for resisting arrest, though no
charges were ever filed.</TE>
<TE>   And when she tried to press a complaint--with the police, civil
rights groups, the ACLU--no one would take her case because she
hadn't been hurt badly enough, hadn't lost time from work or hadn't
miss her graduation. What happened to her happens all the time, they
told her. "You're lucky it wasn't worse."</TE>
<TE>   I guess Donovan Jackson is lucky too. The videotape of his beating
promises accountability. But it also offers us an easy out, a way to
dismiss the problem as one rogue cop or random act of police
brutality. Why is it that only when a camera is rolling that we take
police abuse seriously?</TE>

<LD>That evening Annette's father said, "Your mother and I decided that
you can take care of Nadia's mouse. It will be an exercise in
responsibility for you." Then he added, "You must not trouble your
mother with his care in any way."</LD>
<LD>   Annette jumped up and down for joy. "Yes, yes, Dad, I promise."</LD>
<LD>   Next morning Nadia brought over Cherry Eyes in his big cage with a
large exercise wheel. A water bottle hung upside down with a tiny,
curved glass tube that water didn't come out of until a little pink
mouse mouth sucked on it.</LD>
<TE>   Annette carefully put Sammy outside and latched the cat door, then
let Cherry Eyes out of his cage. Tyler sat watching. "See how tame he
is? He doesn't run around like a wild mouse. That's 'cause he's not
afraid of people." He walked up Annette's arm. Then she sat him on
her head to observe the world. She let him go into Tyler's shirt
pocket. "Hey, just a sec," said Annette and ran to get her camera.
She took a picture of Cherry Eyes peeping over the edge of the
pocket. "Oh, he's so cute!" Annette said.</TE>
<TE>   Then she went into the kitchen. Her mother was cutting up carrots
for dinner, "Can I have some carrot pieces for Cherry Eyes?" she
asked. Her mother gave her a couple.</TE>
<TE>   She took them to him. Putting him carefully on the rug, she placed
a miniature carrot stick in front of him. He grabbed it with his
front paws that were just like hands. Then he sat back on his hind
legs and rose up in front with the carrot stick. He nibbled away at
it like a squirrel eating a nut. Annette and Tyler laughed with
delight. He was such fun to watch.</TE>
<TE>   "I wish he were my mouse," Annette said. "I don't want to give him
back."</TE>
<TE>   Wednesday: Will Annette take good care of Cherry Eyes?</TE>
<TE>   Mice are interesting animals. You can learn more about them at
your local library. This story will be on The Times' Web site at www.

<LD>Sony's sci-fi sequel "Men in Black II" grossed $24.4 million to
remain the No. 1 film for a second weekend, but did DreamWorks miss a
golden opportunity to see its new Sam Mendes gangster drama, "Road to
Perdition," win the box-office derby?</LD>
<LD>   With perennial box-office draw Tom Hanks in the lead role, "Road
to Perdition" grossed $22.1 million for a strong No. 2 debut. But had
DreamWorks released the film much wider than 1,797 screens, it would
have stood a good chance of beating "Men in Black II," whose grosses
tumbled 53% from its opening weekend.</LD>
<LD>   DreamWorks distribution chief Jim Tharp defended the studio's
decision, saying the lower release pattern was about seeing the film
play strongly through the summer.</LD>

<HD>CBS Defends 'Hitler' Series, 'CSI: Miami' Casting</HD>
<DH>Television* Network execs say the project on the Nazi
leader will be based on scholarly works; the spinoff's diversity is
cited.</DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>CBS executives defended on Monday plans for a four-hour biographical
miniseries about Adolf Hitler, saying the project will not portray
the leader in a favorable light.</LD>
<LD>   "We know how his story ends, and we're going to show how the story
begins," CBS Television President Leslie Moonves told a gathering of
television journalists in Pasadena, some of whom questioned the
propriety of the project. "This is very timely."</LD>
<LD>   CBS Entertainment President Nancy Tellem added, "We're looking at
Hitler between the ages of 17 to 34, before he became 'Hitler.' We're
showing how a bad guy rose to power." She said there seemed to be
some concern that the miniseries would somehow portray Hitler as "a
hero or sympathetic character. But this is going to be based on
scholarly works."</LD>
<TE>   The miniseries will be based on Ian Kershaw's biography "Hitler:
1889-1936 Hubris." Moonves said he did not anticipate any problems
with advertisers sponsoring the project. The lead role has not yet
been cast.</TE>
<TE>   Moonves also announced that CBS, the first of the major networks
to appear before the reporters in the twice-yearly ritual to discuss
their fall schedules, will debut seven new comedy and dramatic series
during the week of Sept. 23.</TE>
<TE>   One of those new dramas, "CSI: Miami," also drew some flak from
reporters due to its casting. Though the series--a spinoff of the hit
series "CSI: Crime Scene Investigation"--is set in a predominantly
Latino urban setting, only one Latino is in the six-member ensemble.
The show, which stars David Caruso, Kim Delaney and Emily Procter,
also features African American actress Khandi Alexander as the
investigative team's coroner.</TE>
<TE>   Moonves said the network's continued commitment to racial
diversity is demonstrated by the fact that minorities make up
one-third of the drama's cast.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not running away from diversity," he said. "There's not a
single role on any of our shows where it doesn't come up."</TE>
<TE>   He added that if the new "CSI" is a hit, other "CSI" spinoffs
might be possible, similar to the model of NBC's "Law &amp; Order," which
has spawned two successful spinoffs.</TE>
<TE>   "Would I like to see 'CSI' five nights a week? Sure, but I want to
play this cautiously," he said. "I don't think we're going to make
plans for 'CSI: Toledo.' "</TE>
<TE>   Moonves and Tellem added that CBS is also moving forward with
plans for a Victoria's Secret fashion show during the key ratings
month of November.</TE>
<TE>   Controversy, including complaints to the Federal Communications
Commission, surrounded a similar program broadcast by ABC last year
that nonetheless drew a vast audience. As before, the new specials
will feature women in sexy lingerie.</TE>
<TE>   "Yes, it's a bit out of character for CBS," said Moonves. "It's
not what people expect from us. It's not your grandmother's CBS."</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Recently, Bob Barker, the cordial emcee of the longest-running show
on daytime television, beat Johnny Carson.</LD>
<LD>   Brute force was not involved.</LD>
<LD>   It's true that in the 1996 movie "Happy Gilmore," Barker made such
short work of co-star Adam Sandler that MTV viewers honored him with
an award for best fight; this year, however, "The Price Is Right"
host won a longevity contest, surpassing Carson's tenure at "The
Tonight Show."</LD>
<TE>   For three decades and counting, Barker and Co. have beckoned with
the trademark "Come on down!" and viewers have tuned in, turning "The
Price Is Right" into a perennial champ of daytime TV. This summer,
with six specials broadcast during prime time, the ratings have
flared higher than usual and the show figured briefly among the most
watched programs in prime time, according to data compiled by Nielsen
Media Research.</TE>
<TE>   Yet on a recent July morning, Barker contemplated scaling back on
his duties as host and executive producer of the most durable game
show ever. He used to tape two shows every day; now he usually does
just one daily taping. "It's quite a workout, and as I got a little
older, I realized it was too much," he said during an interview in
his Hollywood home. He was on vacation, and his companions were a
plump black Labrador named Winston and a cat named Dolce.</TE>
<TE>   "At my age, I do not make long-range predictions," he explained,
"but God willing, I intend to do it for another year."</TE>
<TE>   Barker will turn 79 in December. He looked fit in a white shirt,
jeans and white sneakers. A dab of foundation gave his complexion a
tan glow. He was preparing for a trip to George Washington University
Hospital the next day for a procedure to reduce the size of his
prostate. (A spokesman said Monday that the operation had gone
according to plan and that Barker was expected to return home today.)</TE>
<TE>   He said it had been keeping him awake. "Suffering from sleep
deprivation," he quipped, "is not a good condition when you're giving
away refrigerators all day."</TE>
<TE>   In addition to refrigerators, Barker has handed over jukeboxes,
Chevy Camaros and piles of cash since 1972 to contestants who have
approximated the correct price of household items. "Week after week,
month after month, year after year," he recited in comic crescendo,
"decade after decade, century after century...."</TE>
<TE>   On "The Price Is Right," Barker displays a talent for stirring
contestants into a state of excitement: They bob up and down, scream,
throw themselves to the floor. Some ask if they can kiss him, and
they are usually told they can.</TE>
<TE>   Such breathless displays of adoration better suited to teenage
rock 'n' roll idols do not bother the host. "I love it. I love it,"
he said. "Men like to retire and get a sail boat or play golf; I
thoroughly enjoy what I do. I've done this all my life, and here I
am: still wanting to do it."</TE>
<TE>   "The show and the man are intertwined," said Lucy Johnson, senior
vice president for daytime programming at CBS, who has worked with
Barker for 14 years. "He just keeps finding new generations of people
who appreciate him."</TE>
<TE>   Barker won more Emmys for "The Price Is Right" than he can fit on
his mantelpiece: 14, including a lifetime achievement award. In the
process, he has become an American institution and a paternal icon.</TE>
<TE>   "I have one contestant after another who says to me, 'Bob I've
watched you ever since I was a baby,' 'The first thing I remember is
you on television,' that sort of thing," he recalled.</TE>
<TE>   His willingness to poke fun at himself has scored with the
collegiate set, who loved Barker's cameo in "Happy Gilmore," in which
the septuagenarian--who actually does take karate training--won a
fistfight with the film's protagonist. "People loved that scene,"
said Dennis Dugan, who directed the film. "Bob Barker never shows any
anger on his show, so we thought it was funny to [reveal] his dark
side. We wanted to use a double, but he said, 'I can do this.' He
wanted to do all the fighting."</TE>
<TE>   Older viewers see Barker as a throwback to an era of gentlemen TV
hosts. "He makes all contestants feel cared for even if they lose,"
said CBS' Johnson. Unlike a new crop of television personalities who
wear their tartness as a badge of honor, Barker is not one to rip
anybody to shreds on the air. Four generations of contestants have
been known to appear on his show--a testimony to his appeal.</TE>
<TE>   Barker's stint as a game-show host began almost half a century
ago. "I did 'Truth or Consequences' for the first time on Dec. 31,
1956. Wow!" he exclaimed with self-mocking emphasis. It has been a
long journey for the onetime-fighter pilot, who grew up in a tent on
South Dakota's Rosebud Reservation.</TE>
<TE>   His unparalleled longevity on the air amazes him; his pop icon
status amuses him.</TE>
<TE>   "Audience members want to know why I haven't been in any more
movies. And I explain to them that I refuse to do nude scenes,"
Barker said, pausing for an imaginary drum roll.</TE>
<TE>   "Hollywood producers want to capitalize on my obvious sexuality: I
don't want to be another beautiful body. I wanna be an actor, so I'm
waiting [for better roles]. And I'm waiting. And I'm waiting."</TE>
<TE>   To be sure, Barker's tenure as a TV personality has not been
entirely sunny. In the last decade he has been named in lawsuits
filed by disgruntled ex-models on "The Price Is Right," alleging age
discrimination and sexual harassment. ("The things that they claim
are not true," said Barker. Litigation is still underway in several
suits, but the harassment claims have been dropped.)</TE>
<TE>   But overall Barker's image remains that of a benign, courteous
host. His vegetarianism and commitment to animal rights are
long-standing. He plans to leave the bulk of his estate to the DJ&amp;T
Foundation, an organization he established to sponsor the spaying and
neutering of stray pets.</TE>
<TE>   As Barker's schedule gets leaner, viewers are bound to see more
reruns of "The Price Is Right" and fewer original episodes next
season.</TE>
<TE>   Beyond that, Barker's employers are not willing to peer too far
into the future. Said CBS' Johnson, "I'd rather not talk about life
without Bob."</TE>

<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When Hal Prince directed his Tony Award-winning revival of "Show
Boat" in 1995, he boasted that he had restored much of the material
that had been trimmed from the show over the years.</LD>
<LD>   Now, Musical Theatre West goes Prince one better. In honor of the
show's 75th anniversary, MTW is presenting an uncut version as first
performed in 1927. The resulting production, now running at the
Carpenter Performing Arts Center in Long Beach, is a fascinating
sociological document, a window into a bygone era. Thanks to director
David Galligan's streamlined pacing, this unedited version of Jerome
Kern and Oscar Hammerstein II's musical, while a mite creaky at
times, is never doddering. Often hailed as the first modern musical,
"Show Boat" remains a grand old lady of the theater. A few wrinkles
may show behind the greasepaint, but she's spry.</LD>
<LD>   Paul Garman, executive director of MTW, is careful to issue a
pre-show disclaimer of sorts, apologizing in advance for any ruffled
feelings that might result from the African American stereotypes that
are part and parcel of the story.</LD>
<TE>   That's a legitimate concern. "Ah Still Suits Me," a second-act
number in which Queenie (Brenda Silas Moore) rails at her "shiftless"
husband Joe (Dan Tullis Jr.), is wince-worthy, despite the best
efforts of Moore and Tullis to sell the song. Joe, who sings "Ol' Man
River," is a towering American figure, sadly diminished by this
"comic" turn. Still, one has to respect the producers' intentions to
present this as-is rendition, a bit of unvarnished Americana,
time-warped though it may be.</TE>
<TE>   Despite his awkward character arc, the gifted Tullis remains one
of the strongest performers in the show. Also winning is Billy
Beadle, who plays Captain Andy not as buffoon, but as a dry and
gentle humanist. Choreographer Lee Martino's ethnic dance sequences,
executed with bounding energy by the African American members of the
ensemble, are high points. Dale Kristien and Sean McDermott, as sweet
young thing Magnolia Hawkes and rakehell gambler Gaylord Ravenal
respectively, display awesome vocal range in such duets as "Make
Believe" and "You Are Love." Despite her troweled-on Southern accent,
Anne Runolfsson, who plays the ill-fated Julie, delivers a smoothly
authoritative "Can't Help Lovin' Dat Man." Musical director Stephen
Gothold assures a rapturous conjunction of voices in this
well-rendered and worthy effort, a rare opportunity to see an
American classic in its original form.</TE>

<HD>Wasserman: The Power of Silence</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICK GOLDSTEIN</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Lew Wasserman died last month with his legend intact, which is more
than you'll be able to say for most of today's superstar CEOs. The
reason was simple: He kept his mouth shut. In an era when you
couldn't walk past a newsstand without seeing a smug winner's smile
from some entertainment tycoon, Wasserman kept a Godfather-like code
of silence, going to his grave without penning a memoir or even
talking to Vanity Fair.</LD>
<LD>   I cajoled a friend into taking me to lunch with Wasserman a couple
of years ago at the Universal commissary, where he still had a corner
table, even though he'd been unceremoniously shunted aside by Edgar
Bronfman Jr. after Seagram's bought Universal in 1997. Though I'd
agreed to his ground rules--no pen, no paper, no quotes--Lew eyed me
suspiciously for the first 20 minutes.</LD>
<LD>   Then he relaxed. Speaking in a hoarse rumble, he told stories
about his old cronies: Alfred Hitchcock, Ronald Reagan, Cary Grant
and Howard Hughes. I would've made a dash for the men's room and
scribbled them all down except I was afraid of what I'd miss while I
was gone.</LD>
<TE>   Wasserman's Olympian silence came naturally. He was an agent
before he became an empire builder, and he decided early on to stay
out of the spotlight. He might have maneuvered the levers of power,
but it was the client who basked in the limelight.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, Wasserman's very remoteness bred mystique.</TE>
<TE>   In a town that has little regard for its elders, the memorial
service held for Wasserman on Monday at the Universal Amphitheater
was the hottest ticket in town, with Bill Clinton scheduled to close
the show. When Wasserman died, this newspaper, like every other,
couldn't print enough accolades.</TE>
<TE>   That's not the kind of treatment superstar CEOs are getting now.</TE>
<TE>   In the 1990s, as the stock market boomed, entertainment and
Internet moguls were venerated as Masters of the Universe. It would
be hard to say who was on more magazine covers over the past
decade--Bill Gates or Tom Cruise. Barry Diller and Ted Turner were
mainstays in the New York gossip columns. The annual Davos business
conference and Herb Allen's Sun Valley mogul retreat were given
breathless media coverage. Sumner Redstone and Michael Eisner wrote
autobiographies. AOL Time Warner chief Gerald Levin gave regal
interviews, not just to Larry King but also to Architectural Digest,
when he quoted Greek philosopher Heraclitus.</TE>
<TE>   But, oh, how the worm has turned. Since the collapse of the bull
market in 2000, it's been open season on media moguls of all stripes
and sizes.</TE>
<TE>   We've seen the downfall of Vivendi Universal's Jean-Marie Messier,
the not-so-voluntary departure of Levin and the ignominious
disintegration of Mike Ovitz's AMG empire--made complete earlier this
month by his disastrous "gay mafia" interview in Vanity Fair. Even
Martha Stewart is licking her wounds after giving a "let me get back
to my salad" response to charges of insider stock trading. In short,
the glory days are over.</TE>
<TE>   Obviously the collapse of the stock market--and the recent Enron
and WorldCom scandals--has hastened the abrupt reversal of fortune.
But rampant arrogance and indulgence have played an equal role. AOL
Time Warner's Bob Pittman is widely disliked even inside his own
company, where he is viewed as a slick salesman and a rabid control
freak. Redstone, who told Fortune, "Viacom is me, I'm Viacom, that
marriage is eternal," often acts like a schoolyard bully, picking a
fight with his presumptive successor, Mel Karmazin, forcing the
Viacom board to pull the two combatants apart like a mother on the
playground.</TE>
<TE>   Karmazin is no shrinking violet himself. When his sales executives
complained that it was physically exhausting trying to sell ads
during an economic slump, the charmless Karmazin replied, "I haven't
heard of anyone having a heart attack yet!"</TE>
<TE>   In 1999, with a flood of top executives leaving the company and
the stock in a downward spiral, Disney czar Michael Eisner waged a
nasty legal battle against Jeffrey Katzenberg, his former
second-in-command, which found Eisner in court, having to deny that
he'd once said of Katzenberg, "I think I hate the little midget."</TE>
<TE>   No one today seems able to check his or her ego at the door. For
me, the most stunningly dumb move made by Ovitz wasn't his "gay
mafia" remarks but believing that just when his business had
collapsed would be the right time to sit down and dish with Vanity
Fair.</TE>
<TE>   "It's ironic that Ovitz self-destructed by spilling his guts,
Oprah-style, which was the opposite of what created his mystique in
the first place," says Allan Mayer, a former business reporter and
magazine editor who runs the entertainment practice for Sitrick &amp;
Co., a communications publicity firm that specializes in handling
crises. "In the '80s, Ovitz was the ultimate behind-the-scenes
operator. He knew that by being cryptic and operating by indirection,
that it only increased his profile."</TE>
<TE>   Mayer argues that in the 1990s, when the press was lionizing every
corporate chieftain in sight, "a lot of these guys got seduced by the
attention; they craved the limelight. The smart executives, like Lew
Wasserman or Warren Buffet, realized a little mystery goes a long
way. When the Internet bubble burst, people were rooting for the
self-promoting executives to get their comeuppance."</TE>
<TE>   But there's another huge difference between Wasserman and today's
moguls, one that has nothing to do with executive style or ego.
Beneath his cool but toned-down exterior, Wasserman was a ruthless
riverboat gambler. In the early 1950s, when everyone else scoffed at
television, Wasserman embraced the new medium and established MCA as
a major player. In 1958, before anyone knew there was a market for
movies on TV, he snapped up the Paramount film library for a song. In
1962, with the Justice Department breathing down his neck, Wasserman
completely reinvented his company, buying Decca Records and its
subsidiary, Universal Pictures, abandoning his lucrative talent
agency overnight.</TE>
<TE>   He was one of the pioneers of today's franchise mania, using
Alfred Hitchcock's success as a filmmaker to launch the successful TV
series "Alfred Hitchcock Presents." He did get more conservative in
later years, grumbling about production costs and passing up a chance
to make "Raiders of the Lost Ark," believing George Lucas' deal was
too rich. But even in the 1970s, it was Wasserman who urged MCA to
corner the market on patents for compact discs, which soon became the
preferred format for recorded music.</TE>
<TE>   Today's moguls loathe rolling the dice; they want to take the risk
out of a notoriously unpredictable business. Viacom's business is
built around establishing market dominance and collecting ad revenue.
When asked last year about the most exciting trends in entertainment
programming, Karmazin replied: "The most exciting trend is the cash
flow we make."</TE>
<TE>   AOL Time Warner has tried to turn each division of the company
into a giant cross-promotional machine, with its movie divisions
geared toward churning out easily digestible brands like "Harry
Potter," "Austin Powers," "The Lord of the Rings" and "Terminator 3."
Just last week the studio announced it was moving ahead with "Batman
vs. Superman."</TE>
<TE>   Wasserman made his share of mistakes--and plenty of bad
movies--but he didn't live quarter to quarter, like today's CEOs. As
Sam Goldwyn Jr. once put it: "Lew thought of where things are going."
Perhaps that's why he was so fascinated by Howard Hughes, the
daredevil-pilot-turned-movie-tycoon who was as nutty as any movie
star but whose entrepreneurial vision helped shape America's
aerospace industry.</TE>
<TE>   "Howard was friends with Cary Grant," Wasserman told me over
lunch. "And when he heard Cary was going to New York for a week, he
asked if he could stay at his house. But when Cary came back, Howard
wouldn't leave. He told Grant to stay at the Beverly Hills Hotel.
'Don't worry,' he said. 'I'll pay your bill.' Grant stayed there for
nine months.</TE>
<TE>   "Finally, he called me and said, 'Will you get Howard out? I want
my house back.' So I called Howard, but he wouldn't budge. 'Tell Cary
to calm down,' he said. 'After all, what are friends for?' "</TE>
<TE>   Wasserman clearly got a kick out of bigger-than-life characters
like Hughes. In his own unflashy way, he was one himself, in a way
today's CEOs will never be, because he knew that the less you try to
show off, the more imposing you become.</TE>

<HD>On Second Thought</HD>
<DH>The reputation of Bartolome Esteban Murillo is deservedly
reconsidered at a LACMA show.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRISTOPHER KNIGHT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sometime in the late 1650s, when he was about 40 years old, Bartolome
Esteban Murillo painted his self-portrait. The picture is exquisitely
rendered, but it's also odd and revealing.</LD>
<LD>   The Spanish artist chose to paint his dashing likeness on an
imaginary block of stone. The block rests on an angle atop a ledge or
commode, like an artifact on display. A chiseled frame, broken at the
upper left, is carved around his portrait bust, but otherwise the
gray block is chipped and abraded. The portrait stone appears old, a
fragment salvaged from an antique era.</LD>
<LD>   "I am an artist for the ages," this unusual composition declares,
matching candor with ambition and skill. Murillo combines his clever
intimation of antiquity with an intensely observed realism, invoking
the glories of the past to describe his objective for the present.</LD>
<TE>   For much of the last century it has been hard to take too
seriously Murillo's painted proposition regarding his own importance
as an artist. "Sentimental" is the word--or epithet--most commonly
associated with the Spaniard's work. It has often been applied to his
many pictures of scruffy urchins, bright-eyed children and beatific
Madonnas, born aloft on clouds of lily-wielding cherubs. These
paintings are a source for any number of department store knockoffs
and a lot of calendar art. Introductory college textbooks on the
history of European painting rarely even bothered to mention him.</TE>
<TE>   Well, it's time to revise the textbooks. At the Los Angeles County
Museum of Art, a new exhibition of Murillo's paintings is an
unexpected gem. Limited to works borrowed from American museums and
private collections, it's the first solo survey of the artist ever
organized in the United States. It shouldn't be the last.</TE>
<TE>   Murillo was prolific. The show is not large--just 33
pictures--although many of the paintings are. All but two have
religious subjects, and only one is focused on the theme of children.
(It's a depiction of St. Thomas of Villanueva as a well-born child,
shown removing his fine clothes and handing them out to a grateful
group of beggar boys.) But there are many extraordinary paintings on
view, including the aforementioned self-portrait that hangs near the
entrance--which has been held in a private collection and is being
seen in public for the first time since 1848. And the exhibition
might just change your mind about the persuasive uses of sentiment in
art.</TE>
<TE>   Murillo was born into a comfortable family in Seville in 1617, and
he died there in 1682 after falling from a scaffold while working on
an altarpiece in nearby Cadiz. He trained with artists locally. The
familiar blend of naturalism and somber gloom most famously
associated with Francisco de Zurbaran is readily apparent in the
show's earliest painting. A Franciscan monk, standing before a
startled group of townsmen on a hilltop, gestures toward an
apparition in the distance. There, the translucent golden figure of
King Philip II of Spain--a vision of his immortal soul--ascends to
heaven above a miraculous blaze of fire.</TE>
<TE>   Murillo was 27 when he painted this large and impressive work--one
of 11 canvases on the subject of Franciscan miracles that were his
first important commission. With the Counter-Reformation in full
swing, the Catholic Church had need of painters capable of unusual
feats. If the Bible was filled with miracles, and if religious faith
overflowed with mysteries, the task for Counter-Reformation art was
to depict them. Murillo's cycle of Franciscan marvels did.</TE>
<TE>   A year or so later, he made an artistic leap. A magnificent
painting of "The Flight Into Egypt" turns on the life-size figure of
the sleeping infant Jesus, cradled in his mother's arms. Joseph
firmly leads the gentle donkey that they ride through an
indeterminate landscape. The child virtually glows, a blissful smile
implanted on his lips. Mary is serene, while stoic Joseph, hovering
close by, doesn't take his eyes off the pair.</TE>
<TE>   Any Christian who saw this painting circa 1650 knew full well that
the little family was fleeing for its life. No one else would know
it, though. Murillo doesn't stick with the dramatic narrative. He
doesn't portray a risky adventure. Nobody breaks a sweat. Through the
rhetoric of sentimental feeling, he lets you know it all turns out
just fine. The perilous journey through life is assuaged through the
power of familial love.</TE>
<TE>   Murillo's painting is as much an exhortation about human
experience as it is an instructive Bible story. The sacred converges
with the profane.</TE>
<TE>   No doubt the experience he's relating is in part his own. In 1645
Murillo had married Beatriz Cabrera y Villalobos, and soon she bore
the first of 11 children that arrived during their 20 years of
marriage. "The Flight Into Egypt" to some degree represented the new
journey of his own as-yet small family, which he depicted in an
empathetic manner.</TE>
<TE>   Murillo didn't travel to the cosmopolitan capital of Madrid until
a dozen years after he finished this wonderfully accomplished
picture. There, perhaps through the intercession of his fellow
Sevillian artist, the incomparable Diego Velazquez, he was able to
gain entrance to various royal and aristocratic collections.</TE>
<TE>   Almost half the exhibition is composed of pictures painted in the
decade or so after the artist's return to Seville from this
eye-opening trip. Visual qualities of the Venetian and Flemish
paintings he studied there, especially those by Rubens, soon found
their way into his own work. Murillo's paintings became richer in
color, looser in brushwork.</TE>
<TE>   The show was jointly organized by Fort Worth's Kimbell Art Museum,
where it was seen in the spring, and LACMA, which owns Murillo's oil
sketch for the altarpiece that he was working on when he died. The
selections were made by guest curator Suzanne L. Stratton-Pruitt.
It's beautifully installed on the ground floor of the Anderson
Building. Sensitive juxtapositions are made.</TE>
<TE>   In two cases, paintings of the same subject from different periods
in Murillo's career are deftly placed in different galleries, where
they both can be obliquely seen from a single vantage. The
comparisons are instructive.</TE>
<TE>   The crisp, tight, sensational composition of the "Virgin of the
Immaculate Conception" from the late 1650s becomes fluid and
ethereal--more relaxed--20 years later. And the harrowing sight of a
bloodied Christ consoled by angels after his brutal flagellation is
subsequently transformed from melodrama into a focused vision of
stark humility. There's not an extraneous brush stroke in the second
painting, which is the most powerful work in the show.</TE>
<TE>   Murillo's most celebrated pictures in American collections are
probably "Two Women at a Window" from the National Gallery and "Four
Figures on a Step" from the Kimbell. Both terrific genre scenes are
probably pre-Madrid, painted around the same time (circa 1655-60).
Like "The Flight Into Egypt," they're executed with skillful realism;
unlike the biblical tale, their stories are unknown.</TE>
<TE>   No one is quite sure what the flirting girls at the window are up
to. Some have suggested they're courtesans (if so, they're demure).
Nor do we know in the other canvas what is represented by the young
dandy, the winking maid and the bespectacled matron delousing the
hair of an urchin with torn pants. (The business of prostitution has
likewise been proposed, as has the possibility of an as yet
undiscovered literary narrative.)</TE>
<TE>   This much is certain. In both, the ambiguous, enigmatic quality of
the painting is itself a main factor in its modern acceptance. A pass
can thus be given to their significant quotient of sentimental
feeling.</TE>
<TE>   The modern era is an age of doubt, not devotion, and has responded
to these unclear pictures accordingly. Murillo, by contrast, was a
devotional painter--like most Spanish Baroque artists of the era,
major and minor. The inventive abstraction in El Greco and the
conceptual brilliance in Velazquez made them the big exceptions for
their day, which the modern world embraced.</TE>
<TE>   But radical doubt and cleareyed devotion are oil and water. It's
no wonder Murillo's reputation skidded in the 20th century. Now that
we've left that century behind, this exhibition makes a persuasive
case for looking at Murillo anew.</TE>

<HD>Voicing Their Creations</HD>
<DH>Animation* After drawing their characters for film and
television, some artists and writers also provide the voices.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL MALLORY</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It is not uncommon for an animator to be described as an actor with a
pencil. Increasingly, however, animators, animation directors,
writers and story artists are not just actors with pencils but actors
with SAG cards and residual checks.</LD>
<LD>   John Kricfalusi, who created the voice of Ren Hoek for his
groundbreaking "The Ren and Stimpy Show"; Mike Judge, whose
performance as Hank Hill in "King of the Hill" has garnered two Annie
(the animation industry's big award) nominations; and Traci Paige
Johnson, co-creator of the preschool hit "Blue's Clues" and the voice
of Blue, are just a few of the cartoon creators who voice their own
creations.</LD>
<LD>   This phenomenon is not exclusive to television, where budgets
rarely allow for A-list voice talent or where shows such as "South
Park" (whose creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone were actors before
becoming cartoonists) and "Beavis and Butt-head" originate in their
creator's dining rooms, voices and all. Animated features are also
seeing artists and writers becoming actors.</LD>
<TE>   Take for instance Disney's hit "Lilo &amp; Stitch," in which Chris
Sanders, the film's co-director, stars as the voice of Stitch. That
was a casting decision that was made early in development, when the
character was conceived as mute. "Since he wasn't going to talk, we
imagined the uncomfortable scenario of having a prominent actor in a
booth and asking him to make little noises," says Sanders.</TE>
<TE>   About a year into the production, though, Stitch gained his voice
(he's now become the film's spokesman in the ads). Since Sanders
voiced the role on the scratch track--a temporary voice track that is
often recorded by studio personnel to accompany a film's story reel,
which is a taped presentation of the storyboard--co-director Dean
Deblois encouraged him to officially take the part. Sanders agreed,
with the understanding that if he felt his performance was not up to
snuff, he would insist that that part be recast with a seasoned actor
(and damn the embarrassment). With Deblois' coaching, Sanders came
through, and he is continuing to voice the character for the spinoff
TV series and for talking products, which, he notes, allows him a
level of control over how the character is presented.</TE>
<TE>   Chris Wedge, director of 20th Century Fox's "Ice Age," says his
decision to voice the character of Scrat himself came about almost by
accident. "One afternoon in our editing room I just started making
sounds to go along with the animation, and we all thought it was kind
of funny, so we stuck with it," he says. Since the character--whose
Sisyphus-like quest to crack open an acorn in a hostile environment
all but stole the film in the eyes of some reviewers--was added after
"Ice Age" was scripted, there were no lines per se, only noises with
attitude. But Wedge says it was an attitude to which he could relate.</TE>
<TE>   "Scrat is a character that never sees what's coming, and he can't
possibly anticipate how impossible his predicament is going to
become, so the sounds were easy for me to make in the midst of
production," Wedge says. "I don't know if I could make those sounds
right now, I'm too relaxed."</TE>
<TE>   Before any scratch track is made, story ideas have to be sold to
the filmmakers through pitch sessions. In one such session for
"Shrek," the film's producers and directors not only bought story man
Conrad Vernon's concept for the tortured Gingerbread Man, but his
voice as well. "In order to sell our ideas we do the sound effects
and voices and everything," Vernon says. "If everyone liked it a lot,
we'd go ahead and put that on the scratch, and then they would
decide, 'Well, it works well in the reel, let's go ahead and have him
record for the film.' "</TE>
<TE>   While not quitting his day job, Vernon has continued to record
scratch for other projects, and was even asked to record the voice of
the Colonel in "Spirit: Stallion of the Cimarron." Those tracks were
rejected when, in his words, "we all decided I sounded like a
teenager coming out of that [character's] mouth," and the part was
recast with actor James Cromwell.</TE>
<TE>   Occasionally, though, the reverse happens, with the professional
actors' recordings being rejected in favor of those on the scratch
tracks. In the case of Paramount and Nickelodeon Movies' "Jimmy
Neutron: Boy Genius," director John A. Davis and co-producer Keith
Alcorn took on small roles. "In some cases we went ahead and
rerecorded [the roles] with talent," says Davis, who voiced the
unglamorously named "Octapuke Kid," "but everyone decided they liked
it better the way it was, so we stayed in."</TE>
<TE>   And even though the voice cast of Revolution Studios' upcoming
feature "Li'l Pimp," based on the Web cartoon by Peter Gilstrap and
Mark Brooks, includes such marketable names as William Shatner,
Jennifer Tilly and Bernie Mac, the lead characters are being voiced
by writers-directors Gilstrap and Brooks. For Brooks, it's a question
of understanding. "A lot of times actors come in and even though
they're doing a great job, they may not understand all the ways it's
going to be implemented through the animation or how it's going to
look," he explains. "It's a little more difficult for them to
visualize, so they have to record more, whereas I think someone
working on it as a director can just do it easier."</TE>
<TE>   That's likely true for those new to animation, but how are the top
animation actors in town accepting this trend? Philosophically,
according to Emmy and Annie-winning voice specialist Rob Paulsen.
"There are always folks coming in that are vying for the same jobs we
are, but I don't think they're trying to take them from us," he says.
"Frankly, [creator voicing] is still in the minority. But Chris
Sanders did a great job. He's got a hit character on his hands and I
hope he rides it for all it's worth."</TE>
<TE>   While such self-voicing is becoming increasingly common, due in
part, perhaps, to Davis' judgment that "a lot of us are hambones,"
there are plenty of historical precedents for it. Walt Disney himself
provided the voice of Mickey Mouse from the character's first sound
cartoon in 1928 through the mid-1940s. Legendary cartoon director Tex
Avery likewise did voices in his own cartoons, notably "Junior," a
Lenny-like bear; Fleischer Studios story man Jack Mercer became the
voice of Popeye for decades; and director William Hanna was
responsible for Tom's shattering screams and gasps in the "Tom and
Jerry" cartoons he made with Joseph Barbera.</TE>
<TE>   More recently, animator-producer-director Bill Melendez, the man
behind innumerable "Peanuts" TV specials and commercials, has doubled
as the voice of both Snoopy and Woodstock.</TE>
<TE>   But in the 1970s the Screen Actors Guild began to take greater
notice of the animation industry, and even uncredited voice work came
under closer scrutiny. Under the Taft-Hartley Labor Act of 1947, a
performer can have a speaking role in one film under SAG's
jurisdiction without being forced to join the union, but for any
subsequent work, membership is mandatory. Sanders, Wedge, Vernon,
Brooks and Gilstrap have all become members of SAG, though Sanders
earned his card in 1999 for voicing an incidental character in
Disney's "Tarzan."</TE>
<TE>   Many animated series, however, are recorded in Canada with
Canadian actors, chiefly for budgetary reasons, and fall outside of
SAG's jurisdiction. Such was the case for Sue Rose, co-creator (with
Joanna Ferrone) of TV's "Angela Anaconda," who opted to do the voice
of the title character herself. "I got paid Canadian scale, so it
certainly wasn't a matter of making more money," she laughs.</TE>
<TE>   For Rose (who earned a SAG card from doing incidental voices for
her previous series, "Pepper Ann"), the move into voice work seemed
like a natural. "I've been told I have a rather interesting voice,"
she says, in tones that sound like a cross fade between Carol
Channing and Fran Drescher. "I don't think it's a stretch that I
would voice a cartoon character."</TE>

<LD>   McCartney Leads the Pack in Ticket Sales</LD>
<LD>   A survey by trade publisher Pollstar found that, recessionary
times notwithstanding, concert ticket prices have risen more than 11%
from last year to an average of $50.81. Perhaps as a result of the
spiraling costs, sales for the top 50 music acts are down by 3% from
last year and a hefty 18% from 2000.</LD>
<TE>   Still, the biggest stars are raking it in. Paul McCartney, with an
average ticket price of $129.59, is the top earner, with ticket sales
of $52.8 million. He is followed by the double bill of Billy Joel and
Elton John ($44.4 million), veterans Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young
($34.9 million) and the boy band 'N Sync ($33.2 million).</TE>
<TE>   Ticket grosses for 2002, however, could end up surpassing last
year, given that Bruce Springsteen hits the road in August, followed
by the Rolling Stones in September.</TE>

<TE>   Lackluster Response Halts 'Turandot'</TE>
<TE>   Tibor Rudas, the impresario who brought us "The Three Tenors," had
planned to bring a lavish $7-million production of Puccini's
"Turandot" from the Chinese National Opera on a 14- city tour of
North America this fall.</TE>
<TE>   Funded by the Ministry of Culture of the People's Republic of
China, the opera was billed as the first all-Chinese rendition of the
Italian-language work. The story of a young prince determined to
capture the heart of a princess is set in Beijing's Forbidden City.</TE>
<TE>   Due to insufficient demand, however, the tour has been called off.
Anaheim's Arrowhead Pond had been among the sites considered by the
promoters, who blame the aftermath of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks
and the ailing American economy.</TE>
<TE>   "This ambitious project was conceived in the summer of 2001, when
the world was a very different place both politically and
economically," Rudas said. "Even then, it was going to be challenging
to meet the deadlines involved in creating a mammoth production and
bringing a company of 150 performers to the West."</TE>

<TE>   RADIO</TE>
<TE>   More Bad News for the Classical Format</TE>
<TE>   Finding Bach, Brahms or Stravinsky on the radio dial is an
increasingly rare phenomenon. And the situation is getting worse.
According to a recent Arbitron survey, 34 of the nation's top 100
markets don't have a classical music station.</TE>
<TE>   New York's public radio station WNYC has slashed its music
programming in favor of more music and talk. And, earlier this year,
Miami's WTMI became the latest casualty when its new owner, Cox
Communications, switched it to a dance format.</TE>
<TE>   Insiders blame the fact that the profit margins for commercial
stations playing classical formats are lower--a deterrent in the eyes
of owners seeking to recoup their investment.</TE>
<TE>   One holdout is Saul Levine, owner of the successful Los Angeles
classical music station KMZT-FM (105.1). He bought the frequency for
a song in 1958 and has been offered as much as $400 million for it.
Still, he's having more trouble with his classical station, also
named KMZT, in San Francisco. Last month, he switched it to a country
format--prompted, he said, by the fact that the city no longer had a
country music station.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm a broadcaster, not a guy who only likes to listen to
classical music," he told the San Francisco Chronicle.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   TELEVISION</TE>
<TE>   Lawmakers Send Warning to PBS</TE>
<TE>   Sesame Workshop, producer of the children's program "Sesame
Street," says it has no intention of introducing an HIV-positive
character to the show in the U.S., as it plans to do for the
program's South African co-production, "Takalani Sesame."</TE>
<TE>   House Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Billy Tauzin (R-La.)
and five other committee members sent a letter to PBS on Friday
expressing concern that such a character could be inappropriate for
the show's 2-to-4-year-old audience. They also reminded PBS President
Pat Mitchell that they have budgetary oversight of public
broadcasting.</TE>
<TE>   The Tauzin letter gave PBS until Friday to answer questions about
the issue and the show's public funding; PBS said it would respond
today.</TE>

<TE>   QUICK TAKES</TE>
<TE>   Robert Goulet, who is starring in "South Pacific" at the Wilshire
Theatre, came down with the flu Friday and missed five performances
over the weekend. Doctors confirm that he has recovered sufficiently
to return tonight....Film editor Anne Thompson will host a
conversation with producer Robert Evans tonight at the Los Angeles
County Museum of Art, after a 7:30 screening of "The Kid Stays in the
Picture," a movie based on his autobiography.... Diahann Carroll will
join Phylicia Rashad in the Pasadena Playhouse production of Charles
Randolph-Wright's "Blue," the story of an affluent African American
family in rural South Carolina. The play, directed by Sheldon Epps,
opens on Aug. 30....In the wake of its recent disclosure that a
pledge of almost $7 million from a board member has not been met, the
Museum of Contemporary Art has announced that Leonard Nimoy and his
wife Susan Bay Nimoy have donated $1 million to present the work of
emerging artists.... Drummer Max Weinberg, a member of Bruce
Springsteen's E Street Band since 1974, is taking a leave of absence
from "Late Night With Conan O'Brien" to tour with the group, starting
Friday. Jimmy Vivino, guitarist for the Max Weinberg Seven, will be
the temporary bandleader.... Twentieth Century Fox TV will release
the first season of its real-time drama "24" on DVD on Sept. 17--the
first time a full season of a network show will be put on sale in
that format before the series has been sold into syndication or
canceled, Variety reports. The six-disc set will feature an alternate
ending to the season's finale.... In its first major foray into the
horror genre since "The Blair Witch Project," Artisan Pictures will
remake "Scanners," the 1991 David Cronenberg thriller, about people
with extraordinary telepathic abilities trying to take over the
world, Variety reports.</TE>

<LD>It wouldn't be totally off the wall, especially 'round these parts,
to think that a band called the Cato Salsa Experience was some kind
of Latin-music-flavored thing. But in fact the Norwegian group is
actually another bunch of Scandinavians who find the heart of rock
'n' roll in vintage garage and punk.</LD>
<LD>   The Oslo-based quartet was reduced to a trio for its L.A. debut at
Spaceland on Sunday because keyboardist Nina Bjorndalen was ill. Her
presence might have added more of the gritty psychedelic aspects
heard on their debut album, "A Good Tip for a Good Time," but
singer-guitarist Cato Thomassen, bassist Christian Engfelt and
drummer Jon Magne Riise ripped into their 50-minute set with such
abandon you didn't notice anything lacking.</LD>
<LD>   Indeed, the large crowd responded enthusiastically to the music,
which blended Detroit punk swagger, funky bits and the thunderous
crunch of the Jon Spencer Blues Explosion capped by Thomassen's
shouted vocals.</LD>
<TE>   In terms of fellow Scandinavians, the songs weren't political like
those of the (International) Noise Conspiracy, and CSX didn't affect
any airs a la the Hives' mock arrogance. But their tunes did have
classic themes, mostly involving the pursuit and capture of fun, as
in the propulsive "Cool Cat," about a new girlfriend and a new pair
of shoes, and the self-explanatory "Time to Freak Out!"</TE>

<HD>Soviet Secrets: Subs, Germs and Dolphins</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TONY PERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Inside the Soviet Military Machine," a three-part series that begins
tonight on the History Channel, provides an explanation from a
Russian Parliament member for the decision by the Soviet Union to
produce a massive amount of killer germs despite a 1972 treaty with
the U.S. to ban biological warfare.</LD>
<LD>   "The logic was very simple," says Alexei Arbatov, an arms control
expert. "The other side has it or may have it, so we have to have it.
And preferably more."</LD>
<LD>   While his explanation is specific to anthrax, bubonic plague and
50 other biological horrors that the Soviets "weapon-ized" in
mind-boggling quantities, it just as easily provides the overall
rationale that fueled both sides of the Cold War arms race: They have
it and so we need it.</LD>
<TE>   With top-notch reporting and succinct narration by veteran
reporter Morton Dean, "Inside" provides a fascinating look at three
Soviet military programs meant to compete with similar efforts in the
U.S.: construction of nuclear-powered submarines, development of germ
warfare, and use of dolphins to thwart saboteurs.</TE>
<TE>   Tonight's installment details the Soviets' desperate attempt to
catch the U.S. in the construction of submarines. With the launching
of the Nautilus, the first nuclear-powered sub, and then the
Washington, the first sub capable of launching ballistic missiles,
the Soviets were frantic.</TE>
<TE>   "They were convinced the imperialists were trying to encircle them
and prepare for war," says Dean.</TE>
<TE>   In their rush, the Soviets skipped prototypes and scrimped on
safety. The result was the 1961 catastrophe aboard the K-19 (which is
now the story line of a movie, opening this week, starring Harrison
Ford as the Soviet submarine captain).</TE>
<TE>   A malfunction and fire in the reactor threatened to sink the boat
and spread radiation into the water off northern Europe. Only the
bravery of the crew, led by a young lieutenant, Boris Korchilov,
allowed the sub to stabilize.</TE>
<TE>   The captain, unfairly, was made a pariah within the military
establishment. The 14 dead were buried in lead-lined coffins and no
public mention was made of the tragedy. "The image of an all-powerful
Soviet Union had to be maintained and all deficiencies hidden," Dean
notes.</TE>
<TE>   Of the three parts, the scariest is Wednesday's look at the
Soviets' "toxic archipelago," a germ-producing empire that
proliferated despite a 1972 anti-germ warfare treaty. The Soviets
were convinced that President Nixon was lying when he promised to
dismantle the U.S. germ capability.</TE>
<TE>   With the crumbling of the Soviet Union, the germ plants are now in
ruins, and the U.S. is part of a program to round up the lethal
stockpile and offer employment to the germ scientists to keep them
from selling their expertise to a rogue nation or terrorist group.</TE>
<TE>   But a U.S. germ expert, Amy Smithson, doubts the program's
effectiveness. Smithson says the U.S. is putting only "chump change"
into the effort. Germ scientists are driving cabs and selling fruit
in the nearly-liberated republics.</TE>
<TE>   The final installment, "Dolphin Soldiers," tells of the Soviets'
attempt to train dolphins to detect and, in one farfetched plan,
capture enemy saboteurs.</TE>
<TE>   The Soviets were convinced the CIA caused the sinking of a Soviet
battleship in 1955 with the loss of 608 sailors.</TE>
<TE>   In the frenzy and fear of the Cold War, not even Flipper had a
deferment.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "Inside the Soviet Military Machine" begins tonight at 9 on the
History Channel and continues through Thursday. The network has rated
it TV-G (suitable for all ages).</TE>

<HD>Lifting Blame for Autism Off Moms</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSH FRIEDMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If anything could be tougher on a mother than seeing her child slip
into autism, it might be having to shoulder the blame. That's what
happened to a generation of moms in the 1950s and '60s, when doctors
blamed autism on a woman's failure to bond with her child.</LD>
<LD>   Some of those women help set the record straight in "Refrigerator
Mothers" (10 p.m., KCET), an alarming "P.O.V." documentary about the
impact of misdiagnosis.</LD>
<LD>   "Cold mother syndrome" was the theory of Bruno Bettelheim, a
concentration camp survivor who believed autism arose from detached
mothering--something akin to how prisoners reacted to Nazi guards.</LD>
<TE>   Before the diagnosis was debunked in the 1960s and '70s, when
doctors realized the neurological disorder couldn't be cured with
Freudian analysis, thousands of children were condemned to
questionable therapies, their mothers to years of self-doubt. Many
women eventually resisted the verdict and still care for their
children--illustrating a bond that has outlasted scientific error. As
one mother says, "I had this darling little boy, and I lost him. I've
been trying to find him ever since, and I'll never stop."</TE>
<TE>   The film, directed by David E. Simpson and produced by J.J. Hanley
and Gordon Quinn, is told in typical "P.O.V." style, without heavy
narration. Instead, it offers the points of view of various mothers.</TE>
<TE>   One black woman recalls being denied treatment for her boy because
he didn't fit the autism profile: coming from a white,
upper-middle-class family.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't even be a refrigerator mother," she says. "The irony of
it all." She finally got him into a school, but the teachers were
Bettelheim disciples who isolated the child from her.</TE>
<TE>   With autism diagnoses on the rise, there are now several leading
theories about the cause of the mysterious disorder. None of them
blames the mother.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Ernest Frank Cossey, former chief executive of investment firm TLC
America Inc., was sentenced to nearly five years in prison for his
role in a $146-million scheme that targeted the elderly.</LD>
<LD>   Cossey had pleaded guilty in March to income tax evasion and
conspiracy to commit mail fraud. He also was ordered to return more
than $60 million to his investors.</LD>
<LD>   TLC America operated as a Ponzi-type scheme, paying early
investors with money from later investments, from 1997 to 2000, when
federal authorities took over the company, prosecutors said.</LD>
<TE>   TLC raised money from 1,850 investors, promising annual returns of
12% or more through a distressed real estate investment program. The
average age of TLC's investors was 67, prosecutors said.</TE>
<TE>   Cossey, 56, spent more than $7 million on racehorses and greyhound
race dogs. He also used investors' money to buy and furnish a
$1.46-million home and donated $1.5 million to refurbish the football
stadium at his son's high school in Diamond Bar.</TE>
<TE>   Cossey, who moved TLC's operations from San Diego to Brea in 1998,
previously had agreed to pay $10.9 million as well as to forfeit his
home, valued at $1 million, and personal furnishings.</TE>
<TE>   TLC co-founder Eunan Aeria of San Diego pleaded guilty last year
for his role in the scam.</TE>

<HD>Drkoop.com Sold for $186,000 to Vitacost.com</HD>
<DH>Internet: The Florida-based online vitamin retailer gets
the name and a list of nearly 1 million subscribers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID COLKER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Attention shoppers looking for dot-com bargains: It's now possible to
snap up an entire up-and-running e-commerce site, complete with
nearly 1 million registered subscribers and a celebrity name, for
less than a house in Palmdale.</LD>
<LD>   Drkoop.com Inc., once a stock market darling worth more than $1
billion, has been sold in Bankruptcy Court for $186,000 to a Florida
e-commerce company, Vitacost.com. Drkoop.com, which filed for
bankruptcy protection in December, racked up more than $5.5 million
in debt, according to the company's court-appointed trustee.</LD>
<LD>   Vitacost--which has 30 employees and specializes in online sales
of vitamins, herbal supplements and homeopathic remedies--got the
Drkoop.com domain name, subscriber list and some computer equipment
as part of the deal.</LD>
<TE>   "Three years ago, Drkoop.com would not have given us the time of
day," Vitacost President Dr. Allen Josephs said Monday. "Now we own
them."</TE>
<TE>   Vitacost also paid former Surgeon General C. Everett Koop, who
founded the site in 1998, $10,000 to secure the use of his name. "We
made that agreement with him in case there was any lawsuit in the
future for trademark infringement," Josephs said.</TE>
<TE>   Shortly after going public in 1999, Drkoop.com's stock hit $45 a
share. Koop's stock holdings in the company were at one point worth
about $56 million. In 2000, he sold at least $850,000 worth of stock.</TE>
<TE>   But the company tanked that year, resulting in layoffs, frantic
scrambles for capital and the resignation of top executives. Its
business plan was a prescription for disaster. The site depended on
advertising revenue and was committed to paying other Web sites for
exposure.</TE>
<TE>   Shortly before the bankruptcy filing, Drkoop.com stock was worth
less than a penny a share.</TE>
<TE>   But the Koop name is still magic.</TE>
<TE>   "There are still a million people who come to the Drkoop.com site
every month," Josephs said. The site was kept alive, said trustee
lawyer Doug Kappler, to make it a more attractive property for sale.</TE>
<TE>   "The total number of people now working on the site is one, just
to maintain it," Kappler said. "And he will lose his job."</TE>
<TE>   Josephs said the site would keep the 4,500 informational articles
it had when the content was frozen at the time of the bankruptcy
filing. But he is more interested in the subscriber list.</TE>
<TE>   "It has 900,000 valid e-mail addresses of people who signed up on
the site," he said. "We think a lot of those people will buy
vitamins, and it takes our weekly newsletter distribution--now at
650,000--to more than 1.5 million. For $186,000, that's a bargain."</TE>
<TE>   Koop's lawyers objected to the sale in Bankruptcy Court, arguing
that the site's original licensing agreement allowed him control over
which products were sold.</TE>
<TE>   "Specifically, we objected to the fact that Vitacost was selling
things like ma huang that have been shown to be dangerous," said
attorney Lorraine Loder, who represented Koop's interests in the
proceedings.</TE>
<TE>   Eleven formulations of ma huang, an herb advertised as a treatment
for respiratory ailments such as asthma, are sold on Vitacost. Ma
huang, a natural source of the stimulant ephedrine, is especially
popular among student athletes and has been blamed for causing
serious health problems, including heart attacks and strokes.</TE>
<TE>   The judge overruled Koop's objections, allowing the sale. But
Vitacost's separate agreement with Koop includes a promise that the
site will clearly state he is no longer associated with it.</TE>
<TE>   Vitacost also agreed not to sell tobacco products on the site,
which Koop railed against when he was surgeon general from 1982 to
1989.</TE>

<HD>Value of Euro Surpasses Dollar</HD>
<DH>Money: The rebound of the European currency is propelled by
weakening confidence in the U.S. economy, analysts say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SEBASTIAN ROTELLA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>PARIS</DL>
<LD>The euro passed parity with the U.S. dollar Monday, attaining a
symbolic breakthrough almost seven months after the 3-year-old
European currency went into public use in 12 countries.</LD>
<LD>   The euro was pegged at $1.17 when it was introduced for limited
use in January 1999, then plummeted over some 20 months to a low of
about 82.3 cents.</LD>
<LD>   Monday's close in New York at nearly $1.01 meant the euro
surpassed the dollar for the first time since February 2000, its
rebound propelled by weakening market confidence in the U.S.
currency.</LD>
<TE>   The rising euro means tougher times for American tourists in
Europe but better times for U.S. exporters, whose goods will be
cheaper. Although a robust euro will help keep inflation down in
Europe, the news does not mean that the continent's economy is
booming compared with that of the U.S., which still has a better
growth rate.</TE>
<TE>   Monday's milestone is more psychological and political than
anything else, analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   "The euro is no longer undervalued, but I don't think this is a
sign of a very strong euro," said Marc Touati, a financial analyst
for Natexis Banques Populaires in Paris. "It is still a long way from
overcoming the dollar, which is still the superstar currency. Fifty
percent of the world's transactions are still in dollars, and 70% of
the world's central bank reserves are in dollars. The rise of the
euro today is linked to extra-economic factors."</TE>
<TE>   The euro has benefited from U.S. government policy designed to
permit a weak dollar and boost U.S. exports and industry, according
to Touati. U.S. officials have insisted there is no policy to weaken
the dollar in relation to the euro.</TE>
<TE>   A more worrisome trend also played a role in the weakening of the
dollar. Already ailing stock markets are bracing for corporate
earning reports expected to reflect the damage of a wave of
accounting scandals in the United States, observers said.</TE>
<TE>   European business and financial interests are nonetheless enthused
about a success story in the European Union's sometimes arduous
advance toward economic and political integration. Among the
institutions welcoming the currency's two-month surge to parity is
the European Central Bank.</TE>
<TE>   "From a point of view of morale, parity is surely a good thing for
the European Central Bank, favorable for its self-confidence," said
Julian Landsberger of HyopVereinsbank in Germany. "But from a
macroeconomic point of view, I don't think parity changes a great
deal in the current scene."</TE>
<TE>   The EU's central bank endured criticism last year during a period
when the euro foundered, hitting its nadir of 82.3 cents last summer.</TE>
<TE>   "This confirms that the market is very pessimistic regarding the
dollar," said Nick Parsons of Commerzbank, quoted by the Agence
France-Presse news agency. "We could see the dollar drop another 10%
this year.</TE>
<TE>   "The principal factor in the decline of the dollar is the poor
performance of the American stock market. But there is a risk that
this weakening will have repercussions in the world markets."</TE>
<TE>   Parity, let alone a further slump of the dollar, probably will
discourage the U.S. tourists now flooding Paris, London and other
capitals as Europe becomes increasingly high-priced. Conversely, the
new currency dynamic should attract foreign investors to the euro
zone.</TE>
<TE>   But European exporters could suffer if the euro goes too high,
according to Touati. Germany would face particular risks because more
than 17% of its exports are outside the euro zone, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "The markets will have fun testing how far this can go," Touati
said.</TE>
<TE>   The most probable scenario is that the euro will not go much
beyond $1.05, with markets striking a balance between a more
attractive investment climate in Europe without ceding too much
ground to U.S. trade competitors, some say.</TE>
<TE>   More fundamentally, Europe still trails the United States in terms
of growth. The EU economy probably will grow by a maximum 1.3% this
year compared with an anticipated 2.5% or better for the U.S.
economy, according to Touati.</TE>
<TE>   The euro was officially launched on financial markets in January
1999 by Austria, Belgium, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy,
Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal and Spain. Greece joined the
club two years later.</TE>
<TE>   Euros appeared in banks, cash registers and wallets across the
zone during a remarkably smooth period of introduction in January. At
that point, the euro was worth 90 cents. It began a rebound that has
not flagged since.</TE>
<TE>   Although Britain is in many aspects a leading member of the
European Union, the British public has steadfastly resisted the
notion of adopting the euro and abandoning the sturdy pound, which
has a current value of about $1.57. Lately, the administration of
Prime Minister Tony Blair has toyed with the idea of putting the
issue to the voters in a referendum.</TE>
<TE>   The bottom line, according to analysts, is that the euro has
completed what some called its "pilgrimage through the desert." But
times are volatile.</TE>
<TE>   "The rise of the euro is above all speculative and therefore
fragile," Touati said. "It could surpass parity in the short term,
but that will not necessarily be durable."</TE>
<TE>   The weakening of the dollar is also reflected in other currencies.
In late New York trading Monday, the dollar fell to 116.31 yen from
116.79 late Friday, while the pound went to $1.57 from $1.55.</TE>

<HD>Stocks Plunge, Then Recover</HD>
<DH>Wall Street: Buyers emerge in the final 90 minutes, leaving
the Dow off by 45.34 points. Some analysts say the whiplash might
mark a near-term bottom.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSH FRIEDMAN and E. SCOTT RECKARD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Dow index plunged 440 points Monday before a dramatic reversal
left major stock gauges mixed for the session, but investment pros
disagreed over whether there were enough signs of a "washout" that
could mark a bear market bottom.</LD>
<LD>   Stocks fell almost relentlessly throughout the morning and early
afternoon. Heavy trading suggested that many investors who had been
on the verge of selling in recent weeks finally pulled the trigger,
analysts said.</LD>
<LD>   But with 90 minutes to go in the session and many stocks at new
five-year lows, buyers suddenly emerged. The blue-chip Dow
industrials closed off 45.34 points, or 0.5%, at 8,639.19. At the
low, the Dow had been off more than 5%.</LD>
<TE>   Other major indexes also recovered from deep midday losses. The
Standard &amp; Poor's 500 closed with a loss of 3.46 points, or 0.4%, at
917.93. The Nasdaq composite index posted a net gain of 9.12 points,
or 0.7%, to 1,382.62 after being down 58 points.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the wild early plunge and then powerful recovery, analysts
said it's unclear whether selling in the 2-year-old bear market may
finally be exhausting itself. At various points since the market
peaked in 2000, "panic" selling has appeared to signal a bottom, but
it always proved short-lived.</TE>
<TE>   The Nasdaq index has fallen 73% from its all-time high; the S&amp;P
500 is down nearly 40%.</TE>
<TE>   "We're probably in the early stages of a capitulation for the
general public, but bear market bottoms are tough to pinpoint," said
Bill Ryder, quantitative strategist at Wachovia Securities in
Richmond, Va. "They don't spike down; they grind you lower and
lower."</TE>
<TE>   "There's a saying that they either scare you out or they wear you
out, and this looks like one of those times, like 1973-74, where they
just wear you out," said Kevin Marder, Los Angeles-based strategist
at Ladenburg Thalmann Asset Management.</TE>
<TE>   Though key indexes recovered Monday, losers still swamped winners
by 23 to 9 on the New York Stock Exchange and by 22 to 13 on Nasdaq.
Trading, though heavy, was far from record levels.</TE>
<TE>   Still, some investment pros said Monday's whiplash had some
earmarks of a major turning point.</TE>
<TE>   "It looks like we bounced back pretty dramatically. Maybe this is
it," said Laura Tarbox, a Newport Beach financial planner.</TE>
<TE>   Tarbox has been advising clients not to sell their stock holdings
and has suggested that those with cash buy more equities. But when
she returned from a two-week vacation Monday, she discovered that
five clients had sold out of the market, including two of her biggest
accounts.</TE>
<TE>   "Before the last couple of months, we only had a couple of clients
capitulate," Tarbox said.</TE>
<TE>   Historically, at market bottoms, even many die-hard investors find
they're unable to handle the emotional pain of more losses and bail
out.</TE>
<TE>   Tarbox believes that "for long-term investors, this is close
enough to the bottom," though she said she is cautious about the
market's next move.</TE>
<TE>   Robert Markman, a Minneapolis financial advisor who acknowledged
he "stayed far too long" as a bullish proponent of tech stocks, said
Monday's early selling spree was clearly panic behavior.</TE>
<TE>   Markman Capital Management recommends mutual funds for
growth-oriented investors, and those "with a low pain threshold are
already out" of the market, Markman said. "Now people with high
thresholds are reaching the breaking point."</TE>
<TE>   "I can't believe there are people in the industry who still say
people aren't panicking. Give me a break. Investors are saying,
'Look, I may have lost 40%, 50% or 60% of my money, but being stuck
with 40% [of an original investment] is better than watching it go
down to 20%.' "</TE>
<TE>   Markman still thinks the best bet for stock investors is "to tough
it out," but he's no longer putting up much resistance if clients
want to sell. "If you're kicking the cat and waking up at 3 in the
morning, it's not worth it," he said.</TE>
<TE>   At mutual fund giant Vanguard Group in Valley Forge, Pa.,
spokesman Brian Mattes said he did two-hour stints fielding calls
Thursday, which was a big down day for the market, and again Monday.
On Thursday, many investors were cutting back on stocks by 10% to
30%, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "That was happening [Monday] too," Mattes said. "But ... there
were a lot of other shareholders going the other way, wanting to get
into equities. Every 10 or 15 minutes it seemed like I'd get another
buyer moving large amounts in. Some of them were saying they liked
the Dow when it was over 10,000, so why not like it now."</TE>
<TE>   Strategists said they saw no fundamental news to warrant the
afternoon reversal. Once it began it may have gotten a boost from
"short-covering" by traders who had previously sold borrowed shares,
betting on lower prices. Some of those traders may have bought stocks
to close their bets.</TE>
<TE>   Early in the day the market ignored what might otherwise have
passed for good news. Drug stocks fell despite the planned
Pfizer-Pharmacia mega-merger. Traders also were unmoved by President
Bush's latest upbeat speech on the economy, or, initially, by Home
Depot's promise to launch a stock buyback plan, or by mortgage giant
Fannie Mae's better-than-expected earnings report.</TE>
<TE>   Home Depot fell as low as $28, then rebounded to close at $30, up
91 cents. Fannie Mae fell to $70.50, but closed up $2.10 at $72.73.</TE>
<TE>   One potential sign that the market is bottoming is that many
battered technology stocks either have rallied over the last week or
have fallen less than blue-chip indexes.</TE>
<TE>   Some analysts say it would be a classic end to the bear market if
the weakest sectors bottom first, while investors continue to dump
their stronger stocks. But strategists say such a pattern is more
common in a bull market "correction" than at the end of a prolonged
bear market, when timing signals are considered less reliable.</TE>
<TE>   Marder said portfolio managers may have been selling blue chips
over the last week in a bid to stabilize their performance by locking
in any remaining gains, or, in the case of some mutual funds, to
raise cash in preparation for more shareholder redemptions.</TE>
<TE>   The heavy selling of big-name stocks also may indicate that
investors anticipate slower economic growth in the second half of the
year, and that Congress will approve changes to accounting standards
that will sharply crimp reported earnings, some say.</TE>
<TE>   "This goes well beyond the effects of the tech and telecom bubble
bursting," Marder said. "Stocks like the homebuilders, restaurants,
defense contractors, apparel retailers and school companies should
not being coming apart if everything is OK with the economy."</TE>
<TE>   Marder pointed to Lockheed Martin in the defense sector, which
fell 5.9% on Monday, sliding $3.64 to $58.55. The stock still is up
25% year to date.</TE>
<TE>   Another wild card is that companies may voluntarily make
accounting changes that lower their profits, Ryder said, alluding to
Coca-Cola's surprise announcement Sunday that it will begin expensing
stock option costs.</TE>
<TE>   "We could have a pretty rough summer, because the competition for
companies to come clean adds uncertainty to an already shaky market
environment," Ryder said. "In the long term it's great because it
makes earnings more transparent, but while we go through this process
investors may just throw their hands up and say, 'Forget it.' "</TE>

<HD>Pfizer Deal Roils Its Stock</HD>
<DH>Investors fret over price; some experts laud bid for
Pharmacia</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RONALD D. WHITE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Investors hammered the stock of Pfizer Inc. on Monday, driving it
down nearly 11% amid concerns over the price and timing of its
proposed acquisition of Pharmacia Inc.</LD>
<LD>   But many analysts said the deal made strategic sense and could be
expected to trigger a round of mergers as brand-name drug companies
consolidate in the face of pressure from cheap generic competition.</LD>
<LD>   Under terms of the deal, Pharmacia shareholders would receive 1.4
shares of Pfizer stock for each of their shares; that would value
Pharmacia shares at $40.29 each, a 24% premium above their Friday
close of $32.59.</LD>
<TE>   New York-based Pfizer closed at $28.78 on Monday on the New York
Stock Exchange, off $3.42, putting the value of the deal at $52.1
billion. Shares of Pharmacia, based in Peapack, N.J., jumped to
$39.25, up $6.66, also on the NYSE.</TE>
<TE>   Henry McKinnell, Pfizer's chief executive, would serve as chairman
and CEO of the new company; Fred Hassan, Pharmacia's chairman and
CEO, would be vice chairman and a board member.</TE>
<TE>   Pharmacia, formed by the mergers of Pharmacia of Sweden with
Upjohn and Monsanto, also would move ahead with previously announced
plans to spin off its remaining 84% ownership of Monsanto to its
current shareholders.</TE>
<TE>   "It is becoming increasingly costly to fund the high-risk and
long-term research that will be necessary," McKinnell said in
explaining the rationale for the deal in a conference call with
investors. "That is occurring while payers and providers are
increasingly demanding lower costs."</TE>
<TE>   Analysts said investors were concerned about the price and the
timing of the deal, coming at a time when the stock market has been
so volatile and there has been a public outcry against the drug
industry's pricing practices.</TE>
<TE>   Some expressed concern that Pfizer was turning into the New York
Yankees of the drug industry, trying to buy whatever it needed to
stay on top rather than developing talent--in this case drugs--from
within.</TE>
<TE>   "There's concern about the price, and if they're going to grow at
the rate they say they will, then they shouldn't have to buy
Pharmacia," Eric Thorne, who helps manage $2 billion at Pfizer
shareholder Bryn Mawr Trust Co., told Bloomberg News. "The market's
reading into this that the deal may be masking growth issues."</TE>
<TE>   Some analysts viewed those as short-term concerns, noting the
tremendous research and development money the combined company would
have.</TE>
<TE>   As for timing, "the industry is always everyone's enemy--that
isn't going to change anytime soon," said Adam Greene, an analyst for
Dresdner, Kleinwort &amp; Wasserstein.</TE>
<TE>   The pressure on other drug companies to merge or acquire will be
even stronger now, analysts agreed. But the problem those other
companies face, according to experts, will come in finding a merger
partner or acquisition target that is as good a fit as Pfizer and
Pharmacia.</TE>
<TE>   "For the next major merger to occur, you have to figure out where
it makes similar strategic sense, said Richard R. Stover, an analyst
for Arnhold &amp; S. Bleichroeder who covers both Pfizer and Pharmacia.
"Because that's going to be difficult, I don't think that this will
signal a rash of new consolidations. For companies to join out of
weaknesses that have already shown themselves just doesn't add up."</TE>
<TE>   Other merger possibilities cited by analysts Monday included Merck
&amp; Co. acquiring Schering-Plough and a pairing of Merck and
Bristol-Myers Squibb.</TE>
<TE>   But some of the same observers looked less kindly on a possible
consolidation of GlaxoSmithKline and Bristol-Myers Squibb, saying
both companies had failed to digest the consolidations they had
already made as separate companies.</TE>
<TE>   As Stover put it: "It would be a lot like the seventh marriage of
a Hollywood actor."</TE>
<TE>   Observers saw few hurdles from American and European regulators,
despite a growing anger toward the brand-name pharmaceutical
industry--from politicians, employers, consumers and labor
unions--over ever-increasing drug prices and the industry's unabashed
efforts to preserve patent protections.</TE>
<TE>   There is only one product area that might raise regulatory
concerns over a monopoly, analysts said, citing Pharmacia's urinary
incontinence drug Detrol and Pfizer's planned entry, Darifenacin.</TE>
<TE>   Otherwise, observers said, there would be little product overlap.
Just as Pfizer acquired Lipitor in its merger with Warner-Lambert two
years ago, the combined company would boast blockbuster arthritis
medication Celebrex, cancer drug Camptosar and other successful
drugs.</TE>
<TE>   Pfizer's global share of total pharmaceutical sales--currently
8%--would rise to only about 11% if the deal was completed, but a new
powerhouse would be created. The merged company would have $40
billion in global sales and a combined research and development
budget of $7 billion.</TE>
<TE>   "This creates a company that is almost in a field by itself," said
Berkeley-based health-care expert Peter Boland.</TE>
<TE>   Separately, Pfizer announced that second-quarter earnings rose 7%
to $1.96 billion, or 32 cents a share, from $1.83 billion, or 29
cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose 5% to $8 billion from
$7.6 billion a year earlier.</TE>

<HD>Downturn Continues in Region's Office Market</HD>
<DH>Real estate: Landlords are cutting rents to stimulate
demand. Relief isn't expected until 2003.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JESUS SANCHEZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Los Angeles-area commercial office market continued to
deteriorate during the first half of the year as the region remained
stuck in a nearly two-year-long downturn, although demand for
industrial property remained strong with the help of discounted
leases.</LD>
<LD>   In Orange County, office vacancy rates dipped slightly but only
after landlords cut rents by up to 10% to stimulate demand.</LD>
<LD>   Faced with a dearth of new demand, the Greater Los Angeles-area
office market saw the second-quarter vacancy rate increase to 17.13%
from 16.29% the previous quarter, according to newly released figures
from Insigna/ESG, a real estate brokerage and services firm.</LD>
<TE>   Although the region's commercial real estate market has held up
well compared with other national markets, many real estate observers
do not expect that Los Angeles-area landlords will see a significant
and sustained turnaround until early next year, when job growth is
expected to pick up.</TE>
<TE>   "Things are starting to bottom out and we will bump along for the
next six to eight months," said brokerage executive Clay W.
Hammerstein at Insignia/ESG.</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles-area commercial market is mirroring the national
trend, and Los Angeles is doing better than the San Francisco Bay
Area and other regions where the high-technology bust has created
huge pools of vacant space and a sharp decline in rental rates.</TE>
<TE>   "L.A. as a whole seems to have fared better than the rest of the
Western region," said Andrew Wright, senior consultant with Reis
Inc., a real estate research firm.</TE>
<TE>   "Even though the vacancy rate has been creeping up, it [Los
Angeles] seems not as quite hard hit [as other cities] and seems to
be holding right on par with the U.S."</TE>
<TE>   During the first half of this year, most of the activity in the
Los Angeles and Orange County office markets consisted of firms faced
with lease expirations or those that relocated to take advantage of
cheaper locations. There were only a few deals involving significant
corporate expansions that helped reduce the overall amount of vacant
space on the market.</TE>
<TE>   In Los Angeles, for example, aerospace company BAE Systems
Controls leased about 150,000 square feet of space at the Wateridge
project owned by Crown Realty &amp; Development. But Irvine-based Crown,
which owns about 2 million square feet of space in Los Angeles and
Orange County, said demand across the region remains soft.</TE>
<TE>   "Until we see some job creation I don't see much of a pickup in
demand for the balance of this year," Crown President Robert Flaxman
said.</TE>
<TE>   One reason for higher vacancy rates is that many companies have
empty cubicles and unused work spaces, real estate brokers said. Some
of these companies do not need to expand as they rebuild their work
forces or are taking less space to save money when they renew their
leases.</TE>
<TE>   Although the office market has seen vacancies surge, the demand
for industrial space has remained strong enough to keep vacancies in
check. In Los Angeles County, for example, the industrial vacancy
rate at the end of the second quarter hit 4.6%, up less than a
percentage point from the beginning of the year and below year-ago
levels, according to Cushman &amp; Wakefield.</TE>
<TE>   Firms looking for distribution and warehousing space to service
Southern California's huge population gobbled up 14.6 million square
feet of industrial space in the Inland Empire alone, said Darla
Longo, a broker at CB Richard Ellis. However, landlords have had to
cut leasing rates by 10% or more from last year to keep up the pace
of leasing, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "Leasing was steady but not booming," Longo said of activity
during the first half of the year. "We're busy compared to other
people" in real estate.</TE>
<TE>   In Orange County, the second-quarter office vacancy rate edged
down to 20.30% from 20.70% in the first quarter as landlords cut
rates and busy mortgage companies expanded, according to Steve Case,
an executive at CB Richard Ellis in Orange County. It was the first
time the quarterly vacancy rate had dropped in nearly two years.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Orange County office landlords have had to cut leasing
rates by as much as 10% and are eager to make other concessions,
brokers said. "Even though there is more stability in the market, the
landlords are being aggressive to get the deals done," Case said.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the weak leasing market, commercial real estate sales
remain brisk, with private and institutional investors showing a
preference for apartments, industrial properties and small shopping
centers anchored by supermarkets, said Michael Ross, head of
investment sales for brokerage firm Colliers Seeley.</TE>
<TE>   The property markets in the Los Angeles area and elsewhere have
benefited from low interest rates, and the depressed stock markets
have made real estate a good buy in the view of many investors.</TE>

<LD>Arthur Andersen lost its last audit client in the Standard &amp; Poor's

disintegrating accounting firm and hired Ernst &amp; Young.</LD>
<LD>   Andersen had been Freeport's auditor since 1988, said New

<LD>   Andersen, Enron Corp.'s auditor for 16 years, was convicted last

<HD>B of A Profit Rises; Fleet Reports Loss</HD>
<DH>Banking: Cutting costs helps lift the No. 3 bank. Closing
of investment unit hurts Boston firm.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Bank of America Corp. posted higher quarterly profit Monday on cost
controls and consumer banking gains, but FleetBoston Financial Corp.
reported a loss on economic chaos in Argentina and the closing of its
Robertson Stephens investment bank.</LD>
<LD>   Lending profit rose at Charlotte, N.C.-based Bank of America, the
No. 3 U.S. bank holding company after Citigroup Inc. and J.P. Morgan
Chase &amp; Co., on growth in consumer loans, deposits, loan syndication
and advisory fees. FleetBoston, however, took charges to cover loan
and investment losses in Argentina and to shutter its loss-making San
Francisco investment banking operation.</LD>
<LD>   Bank of America's second-quarter earnings rose 10% to $2.22
billion, or $1.40 a share, from $2.02 billion, or $1.24 a share, in
the year-earlier quarter. Cost cutting and growth in consumer loans
and deposits helped the quarter.</LD>
<TE>   In contrast, FleetBoston, the country's No. 7 banking company,
reported a loss of $386 million, or 37 cents a share, in the second
quarter after taking $1 billion in charges. It earned $531 million,
or 48 cents a share, a year earlier.</TE>
<TE>   Boston-based FleetBoston took after-tax charges of $592 million in
connection with losses on investments and corporate loans in
Argentina--raising to $2.3 billion the total charges it has recorded
since Argentina's economic troubles began.</TE>
<TE>   It also took a $278-million after-tax charge partly to shut its
money-losing Robertson Stephens arm. FleetBoston said Friday that it
will close the unit after it failed to reach a buyout deal with
Robertson Stephens officials.</TE>
<TE>   Bank of America shares fell 82 cents, to $67.79, on the New York
Stock Exchange, while FleetBoston shares dropped $1.62, to $27.42,
also on the NYSE.</TE>
<TE>   Net interest income, or profit from lending, at Bank of America
rose 3% from a year earlier, to $5.26 billion, as the bank benefited
from low interest rates and higher consumer loan and deposit levels.</TE>
<TE>   Bank of America's cost cutting, combined with low interest rates
that reduced its borrowing costs, offset a stock slump that eroded
investments and trading revenue. Growth in consumer deposits also
helped as rocky stock markets made people put money in bank accounts.</TE>
<TE>   The bank's expenses fell 7% to $4.49 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Bank of America's net charge-offs for loans on which it does not
expect repayment rose to $888 million, or 1.06% of loans and leases,
up from $787 million, or 0.82%, a year ago. The increase was
concentrated in the consumer bank card portfolio, the bank said.</TE>
<TE>   Excluding charges, FleetBoston earned $635 million, or 60 cents a
share. That compared with profit of $724 million, or 67 cents a

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A senior executive vice president of operations and finance for
Universal Studios, Vincent Grimond, has resigned, sources say.</LD>
<LD>   Grimond was tapped by former Canal Plus Chairman Pierre Lescure to
serve as a link between the European film and television company and
Universal Studios after the firms merged 18 months ago. Grimond was
the architect of StudioCanal, the film production and distribution
entity of Canal Plus.</LD>
<LD>   Grimond's role was thrown into question earlier this year when
Vivendi Universal bought the film and television properties of Barry
Diller's USA Networks for $11 billion.</LD>
<TE>   Grimond is joined by several other Vivendi executives who have
stepped down, or are expected to resign, after the board's ouster
this month of fallen Chief Executive Jean-Marie Messier.
Communications chief Catherine Gros also turned in her resignation
last week.</TE>
<TE>   The departures come as new Vivendi CEO Jean-Rene Fourtou attempts
to restore investor confidence in a company whose stock has plummeted
70% amid concerns over its debtand strategy.</TE>

<HD>Ford Accused of Violating Laws</HD>
<DH>Safety: Consumer group says the company did not tell the
owners of Crown Victoria-type cars about a recommended fix.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MYRON LEVIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A consumer group Monday accused Ford Motor Co. of violating "secret
warranty" laws in California and three other states by failing to
tell owners of Crown Victorias and similar cars about a program to
reduce the risk of fires from gas tank ruptures.</LD>
<LD>   In letters to California Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer and his
counterparts in Connecticut, Virginia and Wisconsin, the Center for
Auto Safety said Ford had broken their laws by telling repair shops
about a recommended fix but keeping owners of the cars in the dark.</LD>
<LD>   It was unclear whether the states will take action. Aides to
Lockyer and Connecticut Atty. Gen. Richard Blumenthal said they had
not seen the letters and could not comment.</LD>
<TE>   But Clarence Ditlow, executive director of the Washington-based
center, said he hopes the latest salvo will increase pressure on Ford
to issue a nationwide recall--not only of the Crown Victoria police
cruisers that have been in the news, but of civilian models that also
have fuel tanks behind their rear axles, which critics say makes them
unusually vulnerable to rear-collision fires.</TE>
<TE>   There are about 3 million "Panther" platform cars--the Crown
Victoria, Lincoln Town Car and Mercury Marquis--on the road,
including 400,000 police cruisers.</TE>
<TE>   Sara Tatchio, a Ford spokeswoman, said the center had
misinterpreted the state laws. Ford is in compliance, "and there was
no intention of hiding anything," she said. The company has
maintained that the cars are safe and that the gas tank fires have
been extremely rare, the result of high-speed collisions that no fuel
system would be likely to withstand.</TE>
<TE>   In the last 10 years, there have been reports of at least a dozen
police officer deaths in fiery wrecks involving the popular Crown
Victoria police cruisers. Using court and medical records and a
government database of accidents, the Center for Auto Safety said it
had identified about 30 fatal wrecks since 1992, mostly involving
civilians, in which occupants of the cars appeared to survive a crash
but died in the ensuing fire.</TE>
<TE>   The letters Monday focused on a "technical service bulletin" that
Ford sent to repair shops in October, advising that the risk of tank
punctures in 1992-2001 Panther platform cars could be reduced by
grinding down a metal tab and replacing a protruding bolt that could
be pushed into the tank in an accident.</TE>
<TE>   Ford said the work was recommended only for Crown Victoria police
cruisers, which are frequently exposed to high-speed rear collisions
during traffic stops. But the service bulletin said all owners of
Panther platform cars could have the work done free of charge if
their cars were under warranty.</TE>
<TE>   The auto safety group said Ford violated the law by not informing
the owners. The letters quoted from state laws requiring
manufacturers to inform owners within 90 days of any offer to repair
"any condition that may substantially affect vehicle durability,
reliability or performance."</TE>
<TE>   The letters called on Lockyer and his counterparts "to require
Ford to comply" by notifying owners of model year 1998 through 2001
cars that are still under warranty.</TE>
<TE>   The "secret warranty" laws grew out of a campaign by the center in
the early '90s that helped get the laws on the books in the four
states. Ditlow said they were a response to numerous cases in which
vehicles weren't recalled, but manufacturers told repair shops "they
would fix something for free, but they wouldn't tell consumers."</TE>
<TE>   Ford's view is that the laws don't cover technical service
bulletins, which frequently are issued without consumers being
notified, Tatchio said. "We do not believe their interpretation is
anywhere near correct. They've twisted the facts to fit their
argument."</TE>
<TE>   The Crown Victoria flap, which had been simmering for about three
years, rose to a boil last month with the fiery death of a police
officer in Chandler, Ariz. Robert Nielsen, 25, became the third
Arizona officer to die in less than four years when the fuel tank of
his Crown Victoria erupted in flames after a crash.</TE>
<TE>   Class-action suits have been filed against Ford in Arkansas, Texas
and New Jersey, seeking a recall of all Crown Victoria police
cruisers.</TE>
<TE>   At the insistence of Arizona Atty. Gen. Janet Napolitano, Ford has
launched a pair of task forces to investigate the safety of the fuel
system and possible changes in police procedures that may lower the
risk of rear-collision fires.</TE>
<TE>   A safety investigation by the National Highway Traffic Safety
Administration is continuing.</TE>

<HD>Fleetwood Enterprises Posts Loss in Quarter</HD>
<DH>Mobile homes: The growth in its RV sales is not enough to
offset a slump in prefab housing.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Fleetwood Enterprises Inc. posted a narrower quarterly loss Monday
after higher sales of recreational vehicles helped mitigate a
slumping prefab housing business.</LD>
<LD>   But the loss was still worse than some analysts' estimates, and
the Riverside-based company said it does not expect to post a profit
in the current quarter. Fleetwood shares fell more than 11% to their
lowest level in more than five years.</LD>
<LD>   "They just missed by a mile," said Robert Marshall, an analyst at
Wachovia Securities.</LD>
<TE>   Fleetwood reported a net loss for its fiscal fourth quarter ended
April 28 of $40.5 million, or $1.15 a share, including $14.1 million
in charges related to restructuring and impairment of assets due to a
bleak industry outlook for 2003.</TE>
<TE>   In the year-earlier quarter, the company posted a loss of $44.5
million, or $1.36 a share, including $9.2 million in goodwill and
restructuring impairment charges.</TE>
<TE>   Revenue rose 10% to $603.2 million, largely because of a
substantial improvement in recreational vehicle sales. Sales of RVs
jumped 28% to $371.4 million, with motor home sales up 46%.</TE>
<TE>   But manufactured housing revenue fell 11% to $222 million, with
retail sales down 37% to $59 million because of tighter credit and
competition from repossessed houses, the company said.</TE>
<TE>   While saying there is an industrywide "lack of visibility"
regarding 2003 earnings, the company said it thinks the tight lending
environment and continuing competition from repossessed homes will
"delay any meaningful recovery well into calendar year 2003."</TE>
<TE>   That led the company to book charges to boost reserves and reduce
the value of its assets, Chief Executive David Engelman said.</TE>
<TE>   Fleetwood expects to report improved results in the first quarter
of fiscal 2003, but management does not expect a profit, the company
said.</TE>
<TE>   The company does expect to post positive operating income in
fiscal 2003, helped by new and revamped RVs.</TE>
<TE>   Fleetwood also said it has revised agreements with its creditors
to reflect market conditions, which should help provide adequate
liquidity for at least a year.</TE>
<TE>   The company replaced outside auditor Arthur Andersen with Ernst &amp;
Young in April and delayed fiscal fourth-quarter results to complete
a new audit.</TE>
<TE>   Fleetwood shares closed down 78 cents, or 11%, at $6.16 on the New
York Stock Exchange after hitting a low of $6.10.</TE>

<HD>European Indexes Drop 5% on U.S. Cue</HD>
<DH>Stocks: Bourses follow steep sell-off at Wall Street's
opening. Falling dollar cushions losses for American investors.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>European stock markets plunged an average of nearly 5% on Monday,
taking their cue in late trading from the steep sell-off at Wall
Street's opening.</LD>
<LD>   The euro currency's rally against the dollar--lifting the euro's
value to the $1 level--was little help in supporting share prices.</LD>
<LD>   The latest slump in Europe left blue-chip indexes there with
greater year-to-date declines than the U.S. Standard &amp; Poor's 500
index has suffered. But the falling dollar has cushioned European
losses for Americans invested in those shares.</LD>
<TE>   Panic selling set in Monday after Wall Street opened and European
bourses crashed through the lows they plumbed Sept. 21, in the wake
of the terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   "What we're seeing is the natural progression of the bear market,
and we seem to have entered a capitulation phase," said Robert
Crenian, equity strategist at Dresdner Kleinwort Wasserstein in
London.</TE>
<TE>   In Britain, the FTSE-100 index sank 229.60 points, or 5.4%, to
3,994.50.</TE>
<TE>   The main German share index tumbled 218.29 points, or 5.3%, to
3,912.51; France's CAC-40 index dived 189.60 points, or 5.4%, to
3,323.74; and Italy's MIB-30 index slid 1,136 points, or 4.3%, to
25,110.</TE>
<TE>   The Bloomberg European-500 index lost 4.9% for the day.</TE>
<TE>   Many European markets are at their lowest levels in at least four
years.</TE>
<TE>   European markets have been hammered by some of the same issues
dogging the U.S. market, including fears of a weakening economic
recovery, worries about new terrorist attacks and doubts about the
accuracy of corporate accounting.</TE>
<TE>   In theory, however, European markets should be benefiting from the
stronger euro currency: The currency's gain, at the dollar's expense,
should be encouraging investors to pump money into European assets.</TE>
<TE>   But the flip side of a strong euro is that it makes European
exports more expensive abroad, potentially hurting corporate
earnings.</TE>
<TE>   Year to date the German market is down 24%, the French market is
down 28% and the Italian market is down 22%, measured in euros. Those
are steeper losses than the 20.1% drop in the S&amp;P 500.</TE>
<TE>   Adjusted for the euro's appreciation, however, European markets
have lost less than the S&amp;P 500. In dollar terms--the return that's
relevant for American investors who own European stocks--the German
market is down 14.4% this year, the French market is off 19% and the
Italian market is down 12%.</TE>
<TE>   In other markets Monday, Canada's S&amp;P/TSX index lost 2.1% to
6,677.76 and Mexico's IPC index eased 0.4% to 6,372.08.</TE>
<TE>   They had been off much more sharply but rebounded with Wall
Street.</TE>

<HD>Congressmen to Propose Digital TV Bill</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JON HEALEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Hoping to accelerate the country's shift to digital television,
leaders of the House Energy and Commerce Committee on Monday said
they plan to introduce legislation to resolve several nagging
disputes among Hollywood studios, consumer electronics companies,
broadcasters and cable operators.</LD>
<LD>   The broad scope of the bill, however, and the short time left in
this session of Congress make it doubtful that the legislation would
pass this year.</LD>
<LD>   The proposal by Reps. W.J. "Billy" Tauzin (R-La.) and John D.
Dingell (D-Mich.) arrives more than five years after the Federal
Communications Commission ordered U.S. television stations to switch
from analog to digital broadcasting. So far, less than a third of the
1,300 commercial stations have turned on their digital signals, and
relatively few consumers have bought digital sets.</LD>
<TE>   Tauzin said he planned to draft a bill by the first week in
September, and he urged the various parties to strike compromises.</TE>
<TE>   Sharp disagreements remain, however, on several key issues. These
include whether cable operators should carry all analog and digital
broadcasts from local stations, how to ensure that digital TV sets
are compatible with digital cable TV programs and whether new TV sets
should be required to have digital TV tuners.</TE>
<TE>   Some disputes also remain over how to protect digital broadcasts
against Internet piracy, although a flurry of recent negotiations
have drawn the studios, set makers and high-tech companies closer to
a compromise. The Tauzin-Dingell bill also could try to protect
digital broadcasts against unauthorized analog copying.</TE>
<TE>   Also Monday, 10 chief executives at top high-tech companies,
including Steve Ballmer of Microsoft Corp. and Craig Barrett of Intel
Corp., sent a letter to the chief executives of the seven major
Hollywood studios cautioning that there is no technological cure-all
to the piracy problem.</TE>
<TE>   They offered to join the studios in working on a response to
piracy but said the effort also must include educating consumers,
enforcing existing laws, offering legitimate alternatives online and
respecting consumers' rights.</TE>

<HD>Honda Faces Kickback Suit</HD>
<DH>Autos: An Ohio dealer resurrects claims that bribes were
sought for shipments of key models.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Honda Motor Co. is facing a new lawsuit alleging that executives of
Japan's second-largest auto maker demanded kickbacks from dealers in
exchange for shipments of hot- selling Accords and Preludes.</LD>
<LD>   Officials of Motorcars Inc., a Cleveland Honda dealership, sued
last week in state court in Ohio, resurrecting bribery claims that
are more than 20 years old. Those accusations led to mail fraud
convictions of nearly a dozen executives at Honda's U.S. unit.</LD>
<LD>   Honda already has paid more than $400 million to resolve dealers'
suits claiming the company shipped them fewer cars after they refused
to pay kickbacks starting in 1975. Officials of the Cleveland
dealership opted not to join that settlement.</LD>
<TE>   "The pattern of corrupt activity and the extent of illegal acts
and conspiracy was widespread throughout the management of American
Honda, Honda North America and Honda Japan," lawyers for the
Cleveland dealership said in the suit.</TE>
<TE>   Honda representatives declined to comment, saying they don't
discuss pending litigation.</TE>
<TE>   In 1998 a federal judge in Baltimore approved a $316-million
settlement of dealers' suits over the kickbacks. It called for
dealers to get cash, auto parts, signs and dealership improvements in
exchange for dropping their claims about the kickback arrangement.</TE>
<TE>   Honda agreed in 2000 to add $60 million to the class-action
settlement after dealers unhappy with it uncovered a memo showing
Honda's lawyers hid evidence of management's involvement.</TE>
<TE>   A group of dealers objected, saying $60 million was insufficient
to compensate them for Honda's wrongdoing. The firm agreed to provide
an additional $21 million in January to win their approval of the
deal.</TE>
<TE>   The additional funds brought to more than $400 million the total
Honda has paid to settle individual and class-action suits by
dealers.</TE>
<TE>   Federal indictments handed down in 1994 estimated that $15 million
in bribes were paid to Honda executives for car shipments from 1975
to 1992.</TE>

<HD>DirecTV Helps Hughes Narrow Loss for Quarter</HD>
<DH>Earnings: The results come even as growth in new
subscribers to the satellite TV service is not as strong as expected.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Hughes Electronics Corp. narrowed its losses in the second quarter
because of growth in its DirecTV business and lower costs to acquire
subscribers, but subscriber growth was not as strong as expected.</LD>
<LD>   The company, based in El Segundo, reported a net loss of $155.1
million, including interest expenses of $122.3 million, compared with
a loss of $156.5 million in the same period last year. On an
operating basis, without interest expenses, the company reported a
loss of $138.5 million, compared with a loss of $223 million a year
earlier.</LD>
<LD>   Hughes, a unit of General Motors Corp., does not report earnings
per share. GM agreed last year to sell Hughes to rival EchoStar
Communications Corp. in a $25.8-billion deal that remains under
review by federal regulators.</LD>
<TE>   The company's cash flow and revenue beat guidance announced last
quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Net subscriber additions, the lifeblood of pay television
companies, totaled 202,000 at DirecTV, up 53% from a year earlier but
missing expectations of 225,000 to 250,000.</TE>
<TE>   The satellite service lost more customers than it had anticipated
when it eliminated its lowest-priced package and required subscribers
who bought subsidized packages to sign one-year contracts.</TE>
<TE>   "We're a little disappointed in the subscriber numbers at DirecTV,
but it's not something to slit your throat over," Chief Executive
Jack A. Shaw told Reuters. "If you look at the other numbers
associated with the company, they overwhelm the subscriber numbers."</TE>
<TE>   Shaw said the firm was maintaining its full-year forecast of 1.2
million more subscribers.</TE>
<TE>   Hughes said second-quarter earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortization totaled $123.1 million, compared with
$82 million a year ago, beating the high end of its EBITDA guidance
announced last quarter of $80 million to $110 million.</TE>
<TE>   Revenue for the quarter rose 11% to $2.21 billion, beating the
company's previous guidance of $2.1 billion to $2.2 billion.</TE>
<TE>   For the third quarter, Hughes said it expected EBITDA of $175
million to $225 million and revenue of $2.2 billion to $2.25 billion.
The company expects to add 250,000 to 300,000 subscribers in the
third quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Hughes nudged its full-year DirecTV revenue forecast higher to
$6.3 billion from $6.2 billion. It expects EBITDA to be in a range of
$525 million to $545 million, compared with its earlier expectation
of $525 million.</TE>
<TE>   The Hughes Electronics tracking stock rose 32 cents to $10 a
share, and shares of General Motors gained $1.32 to $47.92. Both
trade on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>

<HD>Appeals Court Says Insurers in State Must Reveal
Holocaust-Era Policies</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KAREN GULLO</AU>
<BD>BLOOMBERG NEWS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Insurers in California must disclose information about policies they
wrote in Europe during the Holocaust, a federal appeals court in San
Francisco said.</LD>
<LD>   The U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals rejected claims by the
American Insurance Assn., Gerling Global Reinsurance Corp. of America
and other insurers that a California law requiring companies to turn
over information about Holocaust-era policies was unconstitutional.</LD>
<LD>   "A request for information is simply not equivalent to a direct
regulation of out-of-state transactions," the court said in an
opinion published Monday.</LD>
<TE>   The decision means multinational and domestic insurers doing
business in California must disclose the names of people who bought
Holocaust-era policies and whether payments were made on claims.
Companies that don't comply with the 1999 Holocaust Victim Insurance
Relief Act could lose their license in the state.</TE>
<TE>   David Smith, an attorney for Gerling, and Nicole Mahrt, a
spokeswoman at the American Insurance Assn., said they were reviewing
the decision.</TE>
<TE>   California's insurance commissioner, Harry Low, was thrilled with
the decision, a spokeswoman said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's our hope that now the insurance companies will comply as the
statute required them to," said Nancy Kramer, a spokeswoman for Low.</TE>
<TE>   Kramer said 2,300 claims from Holocaust survivors or their
descendants are pending in California. The state has a few hundred
names of policyholders from five insurance firms that voluntarily
turned them over and from a private insurance research company.</TE>
<TE>   The case will go back to the federal district court, which halted
the law from being enforced two years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Advocates for Holocaust victims called on insurers to directly
disclose the names of policyholders.</TE>
<TE>   "We have been urging since Day 1 that the insurance companies
simply release last names, first names" and countries where the
policies were issued, said Rabbi Abraham Cooper, associate dean of
the Simon Wiesenthal Center in Los Angeles.</TE>

<HD>Inventories Rise for First Time in 1 1/2 Years</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Inventories of unsold goods increased in May for the first time in 1
1/2 years as spending by retailers and wholesalers declined,
government reports showed Monday.</LD>
<LD>   Stockpiles at retailers, wholesalers and factories rose 0.2%, the
Commerce Department said.</LD>
<LD>   Retail inventories piled up at the fastest pace in almost two
years because of reduced consumer spending. One reason was that
General Motors Corp. and other auto makers removed no-interest
financing on new cars and light trucks.</LD>
<TE>   In June, retail sales rebounded, rising 1.1%, the government said
Friday. That may lead to increased production.</TE>
<TE>   The inventory-to-sales ratio, a measure of how long goods remain
unsold, rose to 1.36 months, close to a record-low 1.35 months' worth
in April. The inventory increase in May was the first since a 0.2%
gain in January of last year.</TE>
<TE>   Auto sales fell 3.2% in May, resulting in a 2.5% rise in the
number of cars and trucks on dealer lots and in showrooms. That
increase led to the largest rise in retailer inventories since June
2000.</TE>
<TE>   Cars and trucks sold in May at the slowest pace in four years as
consumers shunned rebates that replaced no-interest financing. May
sales at General Motors fell 12%.</TE>
<TE>   Auto sales rose in June as General Motors and Ford Motor Co.
brought back no-interest loans. In June, car sales rebounded to a
16.5-million-vehicle annual pace from a 15.7-million-vehicle rate in
May.</TE>

<HD>Broker Delivers Phone Records</HD>
<DH>Probe: Peter Bacanovic avoids contempt charges by turning
over December's call lists in ImClone investigation.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANNE D'INNOCENZIO</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Martha Stewart's broker, who has emerged as a key link in the ImClone
Systems trading scandal, avoided charges of contempt of Congress, and
handed over his home phone and cell phone records for December to
congressional investigators late Monday.</LD>
<LD>   "We met the deadline," said Melissa Berenson, a spokeswoman for
Richard Strassberg, the attorney representing Peter Bacanovic.</LD>
<LD>   On July 8, the House Energy and Commerce Committee, which is
investigating trading in ImClone shares, issued a subpoena to
Bacanovic threatening him with contempt of Congress if the records
weren't delivered by Monday.</LD>
<TE>   Bacanovic worked at Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. and orchestrated Stewart's
highly scrutinized sale of nearly 4,000 shares of ImClone on Dec. 27,
the day before the Food and Drug Administration announced publicly
that it had rejected the biotech firm's application to review its
cancer drug Erbitux.</TE>
<TE>   The company's shares subsequently plummeted.</TE>
<TE>   Congressional investigators are hoping to clear up conflicting
accounts of what happened. They also want to find out whether
Bacanovic contacted any of his other clients about ImClone.</TE>
<TE>   "Our investigators are currently reviewing the phone records and
are trying to determine who he called, and when he called them," Ken
Johnson, a committee spokesman said Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Stewart, chief executive of Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia Inc.,
is a personal friend of Samuel D. Waksal, the former ImClone chief
executive who was arrested June 12. Waksal was charged with insider
trading for allegedly trying to sell his stock and for allegedly
tipping off family members after learning of the FDA's decision.</TE>
<TE>   Waksal has denied wrongdoing. Stewart also has repeatedly denied
that she did anything improper.</TE>
<TE>   Bacanovic is the broker for Waksal and his daughter Aliza, as well
as Stewart.</TE>
<TE>   Bacanovic was on vacation in Florida on Dec. 27, but Stewart's
trade was executed by his assistant, Douglas Faneuil.</TE>
<TE>   Bacanovic, along with Faneuil, was placed on paid leave by Merrill
Lynch late last month, after an investigation that revealed
discrepancies in their statements.</TE>
<TE>   Stewart has maintained that she had a prearranged agreement with
Bacanovic to sell ImClone stock when it fell below $60.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson also confirmed Monday that several key ImClone officials,
including the company's top lawyer, John Landes, sold shares weeks
before even Stewart bailed out.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson confirmed that Landes sold 2.5 million shares Dec. 6,
while Ronald Martell, the vice president of marketing, sold 2.1
million shares five days later.</TE>
<TE>   From Dec. 12 to Dec. 21, four other unnamed executives dumped
ImClone stock, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson said that after Samuel Waksal returned from his vacation
in the Caribbean on Dec. 26, he made a number of calls, including one
to Landes, with whom he had the longest conversation.</TE>

<HD>Options Activity in Pharmacia Reviewed</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DORIS FRANKEL</AU>
<BD>REUTERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Chicago Board Options Exchange said it was looking into unusual
activity in Pharmacia Corp.'s options trading, which swelled late
last week before Monday's surprise announcement of a planned merger
with Pfizer Inc.</LD>
<LD>   It was the second time in one day that the world's largest options
exchange said it had opened a routine probe into unusual activity in
options on a drug company's shares.</LD>
<LD>   Earlier Monday, the exchange said it was reviewing unusual trading
in options on shares of drug maker Wyeth, which picked up early last
week just before a study showed that a popular hormone therapy could
raise women's health risks. Wyeth's shares subsequently plummeted.</LD>
<TE>   A Pharmacia spokesman Monday declined to comment on the options
activity.</TE>
<TE>   An exchange spokeswoman declined to say when the probe was
launched or whether it was linked to the unusual Pharmacia option
turnover Friday, when an interexchange total of 10,471 calls and
2,671 puts changed hands, according to Options Clearing Corp. data.</TE>
<TE>   The Pharmacia call activity that day was more than four times the
average daily volume of 2,358 contracts, OCC data showed.</TE>
<TE>   A call gives its buyer the right to buy 100 shares of the stock at
a predetermined strike price by a set date.</TE>
<TE>   Friday's turnover in puts, which allow the buyer to sell the stock
at a set price, was more than 2 1/2 times the average daily volume of
1,039 puts, said the OCC, which guarantees all trades on U.S. options
exchanges.</TE>

<LD>The California Public Employees Retirement System, the largest U.S.
pension fund, and other pension funds have sued WorldCom Inc. over
$433 million in bond losses after the long-distance provider said it
hid $3.9 billion in costs.</LD>
<LD>   Lawyers for Sacramento-based CalPERS, the California State
Teachers Retirement System and the Los Angeles County Employees
Retirement Assn. filed suit in state court in Los Angeles accusing
WorldCom of misleading investors about its financial health in a May
2001 bond offering.</LD>
<LD>   The suit joins a host of other suits filed by state pension funds
seeking to recoup billions in losses tied to WorldCom's bonds.</LD>
<TE>   In the suit, CalPERS said it lost $338 million on WorldCom's 8.25%
bonds due 2031, while the teachers' retirement fund lost $45 million
on the same bonds. The Los Angeles employees fund lost $25.9 million
on the 8.25% bonds and an additional $24.1 million on 7.5% bonds due
2011.</TE>
<TE>   The California pension funds also sued underwriters including J.P.
Morgan Chase &amp; Co. and Goldman Sachs Group Inc., as well as
WorldCom's former accountant, Arthur Andersen.</TE>
<TE>   WorldCom officials weren't immediately available to comment.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Dynegy Inc. will take a second-quarter pretax charge of $500 million,
more than expected, after the U.S. energy trader revised natural-gas
sales figures.</LD>
<LD>   The Houston-based company had forecast $450 million, mostly for
costs from its communications business and severance payments. The
increase follows a review of results in its gas-marketing business,
Dynegy said. The marketing charge alone will be about $125 million
and comes as Dynegy and other traders face probes of their business
practices.</LD>
<LD>   Shares of Dynegy fell 20 cents, or 3%, to $6.10 on the New York
Stock Exchange. They have lost 76% of their value this year.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Fannie Mae, the largest buyer of home mortgages, said second-quarter
earnings rose 4.4% as low interest rates fueled home buying and cut
the company's borrowing costs.</LD>
<LD>   Fannie Mae's net income increased to $1.46 billion, or $1.44 a
share. Operating earnings, which exclude changes in the market value
of derivatives holdings, rose 20% to $1.57 billion, or $1.55 a share,
beating estimates by 3 cents.</LD>
<LD>   The company had more loans to buy as consumers took advantage of
mortgage rates that have averaged below 7% since 2000 by refinancing
loans and buying homes. A wider spread between what Fannie Mae makes
from its investments and its borrowing costs also is boosting
earnings.</LD>

buy the planes and brings to 95 the total firm orders for A380s. With
the aircraft, FedEx, the only U.S. carrier to commit to the planes,
will be able to fly more freight greater distances.</LD>

billion was sold in six-month bills at 1.675%, down from 1.735%.</LD>

<LD>Mirant Corp., Williams Cos. and six other energy traders are being
sued by a public utility in Washington state that claims the firms
colluded to create artificially high electricity prices.</LD>
<LD>   The power generators already face similar suits from California
consumers, cities and the state attorney general. The Snohomish
County Public Utility District, north of Seattle, said it is the
first Washington public utility district to file such a claim.</LD>
<LD>   The suit, filed in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles, cites memos
released in May by Enron Corp. that indicate its traders and other
companies used techniques dubbed "Fat Boy" and "Death Star" to create
artificial energy shortages.</LD>

Icahn, who wasn't available to comment, isn't obligated to purchase

<LD>Citigroup Inc. was asked by federal regulators reviewing its proposed
$5.8-billion purchase of Cal Fed parent Golden State Bancorp Inc. to
provide information about how the New York-based bank makes loans to
low-income families.</LD>
<LD>   In a July 3 letter, a Federal Reserve senior counsel sought
answers to 34 questions ranging from the way Citigroup monitors
complaints about abusive loan practices to how it rewards loan
managers. Responses are due Wednesday.</LD>
<LD>   The questions stem from objections to the takeover raised by Inner
City Press/Community on the Move, a New York-based nonprofit group,
and the California Reinvestment Committee, which represents about 200
organizations and public agencies.</LD>
<TE>   Citigroup said the questions are part of a routine review process
and that it expects the inquiry to delay the transaction. Citigroup
also said its lending policies are appropriate.</TE>
<TE>   In Big Board trading, Citigroup rose 59 cents to $36.94 and San
Francisco-based Golden State rose 7 cents to $34.85.wl</TE>

<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>Sun Microsystems Inc. and other companies will begin rolling out
services today that allow Web surfers to sign on to one secure site
and then travel to other Internet locations without reentering their
information.</LD>
<LD>   The identity authentication services are based on public
specifications released Monday by the Liberty Alliance, a coalition
including Sun, AOL Time Warner Inc., MasterCard International Inc.,
General Motors Corp. and dozens of other firms.</LD>
<LD>   The group was formed last year in response to Microsoft Corp.'s
Passport service, which stores such user information as names and
credit card numbers to smooth electronic commerce.</LD>
<TE>   Use of Passport is required for Microsoft's free Hotmail e-mail
and is promoted heavily in the Windows XP operating system. Microsoft
plans to use Passport as a stepping stone to its developing system
for more advanced Web services.</TE>
<TE>   Many financial institutions and other companies have been less
than enthusiastic about Passport because Microsoft charges them,
holds on to all the information and might compete with merchants it
is connecting to consumers. And Microsoft's system is proprietary, so
that businesses don't know everything about how it works.</TE>
<TE>   Sun's new service launches with initial customers Wells Fargo &amp;
Co. and a Sony Corp. site for soap opera fans. The first programs
ease consumer surfing within those domains, instead of allowing a
visitor to take an established identity elsewhere without
re-registering.</TE>
<TE>   Wells Fargo already has a single sign-on for its Internet banking,
brokerage and other services, so consumers might not notice a
difference. But the Sun product "gives us increased efficiency
internally" and should reduce administrative costs, said Wells Fargo
Senior Vice President Eric Castain.</TE>
<TE>   Wells Fargo, which doesn't accept Passport's authentication
system, anticipates using future services with the Liberty Alliance
specifications to allow surfers to visit other secure sites, Castain
said.</TE>
<TE>   Novell Inc. said it would release a Liberty-based service this
year for large companies, so that employees can reach different
internal programs after signing in once. RSA Security Inc. said it
would ship a remote-access service using the same standards next
year.</TE>
<TE>   Liberty applications for consumers also are planned and will
compete more directly with Passport.</TE>
<TE>   At United Airlines, technology executive Rob Robless said that by
next year, Web visitors making plane reservations should be able to
make car and hotel reservations without reentering data. That step
could double the number of people buying more than just plane tickets
when they visit, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Under the guidelines issued Monday, consumers keep the right to
say how much of their personal information is shared with each site
and whether they want to share the information on each successive
visit or just once.</TE>
<TE>   Microsoft spokesman Adam Sohn said more pieces of Passport's
workings are getting published and that other parts soon would be
submitted to neutral standard-setting bodies.</TE>

<HD>Broadcom Sues Microtune Over Patent</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Broadcom Corp., the largest designer of semiconductor chips for cable
modems, filed a lawsuit accusing Microtune Inc. of infringing a
Broadcom patent for a modem frequency tuner.</LD>
<LD>   Cable modems receive numerous signals, and tuners are needed to
select the correct frequency to find requested data. Irvine-based
Broadcom said its patented tuner reduces the number of components
needed for the tuner so it's smaller and uses less power.</LD>
<LD>   Microtune is accused of using Broadcom's technology in its tuner
product line. In the federal lawsuit filed in Sherman, Texas,
Broadcom seeks damages and a court order blocking Microtune from
selling products that infringe the patent, issued in April from a
1999 application.</LD>
<TE>   Plano, Texas-based Microtune reported $63.1 million in sales last
year. Company executives couldn't immediately be reached for comment.
Broadcom reported sales of $961.8 million.</TE>
<TE>   On Nasdaq, Broadcom shares rose $1.90 to $22.29 and Microtune
shares fell 1 cent to $8.01.</TE>

<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Avnet Inc. cut 775 jobs, a 6.5% reduction, and the second-biggest
U.S. distributor of computer parts said fiscal fourth-quarter results
trailed estimates as sales fell.</LD>
<LD>   Excluding certain costs, Avnet said in a preliminary look at
results that it broke even on a per-share basis in the quarter ended
June 28. The company was projected to earn 3 cents.</LD>
<LD>   Sales were about $100 million less than the $2.54 billion in the
year-ago fourth quarter as demand for microprocessors and disk drives
declined, the Phoenix-based company said. Chip makers are grappling
with a demand slump that began in 2000. Orders are growing slowly,
forcing prices down and leaving the industry with idle capacity and
extra inventory, Avnet and analysts say.</LD>
<TE>   The cuts will leave Avnet with about 11,100 workers.</TE>
<TE>   Shares fell 64 cents to $19.48 on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>

<HD>Harris Gets FAA Telecom Contract</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Dow Jones/Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Federal Aviation Administration on Monday rejected WorldCom
Inc.'s bid to build a $3.5-billion next-generation telecommunications
network, dealing the troubled company a blow that could dash its
hopes of recovery.</LD>
<LD>   Instead, it chose Harris Corp. of Melbourne, Fla., for a contract
that could last as long as 15 years. The initial term of the contract
is for five years at $1.5 billion.</LD>
<LD>   The FAA's rejection of WorldCom came despite pleas by Federal
Communications Commission Chairman Michael K. Powell for federal
agencies not to cut their ties to WorldCom, which is reeling in the
face of a $3.9-billion accounting scandal.</LD>
<TE>   As customers flee the company, the federal government has become
an even more critical customer.</TE>
<TE>   WorldCom did $462 million in business with the federal government
last year, which included telecommunications services for the FAA.
But given WorldCom's problems, those agencies will be reviewing the
contracts when it comes time for renewal.</TE>
<TE>   The new FAA contract would have been anything but routine. The FAA
is trying to redesign its telecommunications system from the ground
up, integrating disparate systems into a unified, highly secure
network.</TE>
<TE>   WorldCom's loss is a gain for the nation's other major
telecommunications players. Harris' team included Raytheon Co.,
Sprint Corp. and the four Baby Bell telephone companies, BellSouth
Corp., Verizon Communications Inc., SBC Communications Inc. and Qwest
Communications International Inc.</TE>
<TE>   But the FAA also rejected a bid by Lockheed Martin Corp., which
planned to use AT&amp;T Corp. as its subcontractor.</TE>
<TE>   Under the so-called FAA Telecommunications Infrastructure, or FTI,
contract, Harris will modernize and operate a wide range of voice,
data and video telecommunications services in the air-traffic control
system used by air-traffic controllers to communicate with one
another and with pilots. Harris will phase out older systems and
replace them with a unified system.</TE>

<HD>Inquiry on WorldCom Extended Back a Year</HD>
<DH>Accounting: Rep. Tauzin releases documents that he says
indicate that the telecom firm might have started some improper
practices as early as 1999.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Just a few months after completing its late-1998 acquisition of
long-distance giant MCI, WorldCom Inc. may have begun boosting its
profit by improperly reclassifying operating expenses, a House
committee chairman said Monday.</LD>
<LD>   "We're actually interviewing several witnesses at the moment who
indicate to us that the problems may go back as far as 1999, not just
the year 2000," said W.J. "Billy" Tauzin (R-La.), chairman of the
House Energy and Commerce Committee, which is investigating
WorldCom's accounting practices.</LD>
<LD>   Tauzin released 14 pages of documents Monday that showed that
WorldCom managers told company executives that WorldCom was
improperly reporting operating costs as capital items at least two
years before the telecom giant disclosed last month that it
improperly accounted for $3.9 billion in expenses in 2001 and 2002.</LD>
<TE>   But the concerned managers were rebuffed by then-Chief Executive
Bernard J. Ebbers and then-Chief Financial Officer Scott D. Sullivan,
Tauzin said.</TE>
<TE>   "It was Scott Sullivan who, in fact, ordered the company to engage
in that kind of accounting treatment," Tauzin said during an hourlong
news conference held with other lawmakers looking into the financial
scandal. "This is the clearest and most definable violation of
accounting statutes we have seen; this is Fraud 101."</TE>
<TE>   Neither Ebbers nor Sullivan could be reached for comment.</TE>
<TE>   WorldCom spokesman Brad Burns said that as news of WorldCom's 2001
revenue overstatement broke late last month, the company learned
about possible problems with its books for 1999 and 2000. He said
Washington lawyer William McLucas, the former SEC enforcement chief
whom the company hired to conduct an independent investigation, was
asked to check into the previous two years as well.</TE>
<TE>   "We have told Mr. McLucas to look into whatever he needs to,"
Burns said, adding that the company is cooperating fully with the
government because "we, more than anyone, want to get to the bottom
of this."</TE>
<TE>   Using its highflying stock, WorldCom acquired MCI Communications
Inc.--the nation's No. 2 long-distance phone company--in a
$30-billion deal that catapulted WorldCom to the top ranks of the
world's communications companies.</TE>
<TE>   But the deal came at a time when long-distance growth was slowing,
complicating matters for WorldCom, which consistently had regaled
Wall Street with double-digit revenue growth through more than 40
acquisitions since 1992.</TE>
<TE>   As WorldCom's growth slowed, the company became desperate to
engineer a rosier financial picture, the documents released by Tauzin
suggest.</TE>
<TE>   In a March 5, 2001, e-mail, WorldCom Comptroller David Myers told
a co-worker that Sullivan told him to "do whatever is necessary to
get Telco/Margins back in line."</TE>
<TE>   The numbers to do so were supplied by Sullivan, who put them in a
spreadsheet e-mailed to Myers that same day.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to documents allegedly showing Sullivan ordering
accounting irregularities, Tauzin released minutes of a March 6,
2002, meeting of WorldCom's audit committee during which Ebbers
recommended that WorldCom slash its internal audit budget by 50%. The
recommendation came more than four months before internal company
auditors uncovered the accounting irregularities.</TE>
<TE>   WorldCom announced late last month that it hid $3.9 billion in
costs for five quarters by reclassifying operating expenses, which
are deducted from annual revenue, as long-term capital investments
that can be spread out over many years.</TE>
<TE>   The scandal has sparked the introduction of half a dozen bills in
Congress calling for new accounting standards, limits on corporate
executive loans and other measures. Lawmakers also have singled out
the government's lack of regulatory oversight. Several have called
for the ouster of Harvey L. Pitt, chairman of the Securities and
Exchange Commission, as well as stepped up enforcement of the telecom
industry by the Federal Communications Commission.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Ernest F. Hollings (D-S.C.) and two House members have
written FCC Chairman Michael K. Powell in recent days, asking what
the FCC is doing to protect consumers from financially troubled
telecommunications companies.</TE>
<TE>   In a letter sent Monday to Rep. Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.), Powell
responded that although the FCC is not "powerless to protect
consumers and prevent service disruptions," he invited Congress to
give the agency greater power to crack down on financially troubled
carriers to avoid any service disruptions.</TE>
<TE>   Also Monday, WorldCom moved to finalize a debtor-in-possession
funding agreement that would give it money to operate under a
possible bankruptcy reorganization, sources familiar with the
situation said. With the threat of a Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing
looming, WorldCom hopes to secure a financing pact from Citigroup
Inc., J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co. and General Electric Co.'s GE Capital
financing arm, sources said.</TE>
<TE>   That money would allow the company to maintain its networks, serve
customers and pay employees during the protracted bankruptcy process.
Representatives of WorldCom, Citigroup, J.P. Morgan and GE Capital
declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   A bankruptcy filing by WorldCom, which has $104 billion in assets,
would eclipse the Chapter 11 filing by collapsed energy trader Enron
Corp. as the nation's largest.</TE>
<TE>   WorldCom also opted on Monday not to make a $74-million interest
payment, a decision that allows it to save money it may need to
continue to operate.</TE>
<TE>   WorldCom did not make payments on two 7.375% notes, one maturing
in 2003 and the other maturing in 2006, according to Keri Branin, a
spokeswoman for J.P. Morgan, trustee for the bonds.</TE>

<HD>Publisher to Expense Stock Options</HD>
<DH>Accounting: Washington Post follows Coca-Cola in moving
toward financial reports intended to be clearer and more accurate.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Washington Post Co. will follow the advice of billionaire investor
Warren Buffett, its largest outside shareholder, by accounting for
stock options as an operating expense, the company said Monday.</LD>
<LD>   Coca-Cola Co., which like the Washington Post counts Buffett as
its top investor and a director, said Sunday that it will begin
expensing options.</LD>
<LD>   Buffett has advocated including options as a cost on corporate
income statements, to make financial reports clearer and more
accurate.</LD>
<TE>   "His arguments make complete sense to all of us," Washington Post
Chief Executive Donald Graham said. "As it happened, [Buffett] wasn't
in the meeting where it was discussed, but the members of the board
have heard Warren's views on this."</TE>
<TE>   Calls by investors for companies to expense options have been
spurred by accounting scandals involving companies including Enron
Corp. and WorldCom Inc.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. rules now require only an estimate of option costs in
footnotes to income statements.</TE>
<TE>   Washington Post, publisher of its namesake newspaper and Newsweek
magazine, made the accounting decision at a board meeting in May,
Graham said. The company is consulting with its accountant,
PricewaterhouseCoopers, on which option valuation method to use in
calculating the expense, he said.</TE>
<TE>   The Washington-based company's 2000 net income of $136.5 million
would have been reduced by $3.8 million, or 2.8%, had the company
recognized options as an expense, according to the company's annual
report.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Washington Post fell $1 to $525 on Monday. Coca-Cola's
shares rose 95 cents to $52.</TE>

<LD>Citigroup's Salomon Smith Barney unit, which New York Atty. Gen.
Eliot Spitzer is investigating for possible conflicts of interest in
its stock research, proposed industrywide rules separating analysts
from investment bankers.</LD>
<LD>   In a letter Friday to industry regulators, Citigroup Chairman
Sanford Weill suggested that analysts be prohibited from attending
meetings with bankers soliciting business from public companies.</LD>
<LD>   Analysts also shouldn't be allowed to attend "roadshows,"
presentations for potential investors in new stock offerings, Weill
said.</LD>
<TE>   The ideas go further than what other brokerages have proposed.</TE>
<TE>   Citigroup may be trying to head off more severe regulation from
Congress or Spitzer, said Alan Bromberg, a securities law professor
at Southern Methodist University in Dallas. "It's an effort to say
the industry can solve the problems by itself," he said. "They're
trying to say, 'We're good citizens.' "</TE>
<TE>   Spitzer's initial investigation into potential analyst conflicts
of interest resulted in a $100-million settlement by Merrill Lynch &amp;
Co. in the spring. Spitzer has since turned his attention to Salomon
and Morgan Stanley. His probe is based on allegations that analysts
have tailored their public opinions of companies to win lucrative
banking work for their firms.</TE>

<LD>Ahmad Omar Saeed Sheikh was sentenced in a Hyderabad court to hang
for his role in masterminding the kidnapping and heinous murder of
Wall Street Journal reporter Daniel Pearl. But silencing the fiery
London School of Economics dropout by public execution before
allowing U.S. authorities to decode his terrorist mind would be the
greatest betrayal of Pearl's legacy that Pakistan could impose.</LD>
<LD>   Sheikh's threat to spill the dark secrets of Pakistan's
pro-militancy policies in Kashmir and perhaps elsewhere prevented his
extradition to the U.S. in February, when he was first arrested. No
known contact has taken place between him and U.S. officials in the
region since. Bringing him to the U.S. now would be politically
impossible for Gen. Pervez Musharraf, who is dealing daily with
threats to his life from Muslim extremists.</LD>
<LD>   But interrogating Sheikh on Pakistani soil while his lawyers work
through the justice system's tortuous appeals process would allow
U.S. Special Forces and the FBI, already in Pakistan hunting for Al
Qaeda operatives with local troops, an important glimpse into the
world of Islamic terrorism. U.S. authorities should insist on having
that opportunity.</LD>
<TE>   Decoding Sheikh--known for his politeness in private school--may
prove invaluable. Determining what motivated the British-born son of
a Pakistani clothes merchant to become a world-class terrorist may
help U.S. authorities protect other American citizens in countries
where Al Qaeda cells are known to operate.</TE>
<TE>   Sheikh's modus operandi is particularly troubling because, like Al
Qaeda, it relies almost exclusively on highly specialized but
distinctly separate two- and three-member cells, each with plausible
deniability of the involvement of another cell's role in an operation
of the type that cost Pearl his life. Deciphering what drives these
cells, how they are organized and how they distribute responsibility
for the component acts that constitute a larger terrorist act are
vital to our security.</TE>
<TE>   Little if any of this information would be voluntarily provided to
us by Pakistani intelligence, which is bent on preserving its trade
secrets for nefarious operations in conflict regions like Kashmir.
Kidnapping unsuspecting Westerners with elaborately constructed traps
is at the heart of Sheikh's brand of terrorism. In 1994, he was
arrested by Indian authorities for alleged involvement in the
kidnapping of four tourists--three Britons and one American--in
India. India freed him and other militant leaders in December 1999 in
exchange for 155 hostages held on an Indian Airlines jet that had
been hijacked to the southern Afghan city of Kandahar just two weeks
before his case was to be heard.</TE>
<TE>   Sheikh, who disappeared into Pakistan's underworld after being
freed, was later linked to Sept. 11 hijacker Mohamed Atta through a
$100,000 transfer to Atta's accounts. Understanding that underworld
and how money was moved around in it during the period when Sheikh
was out of sight is a vital part of U.S. efforts to unveil the system
that supports terrorism on foreign soil, where hundreds of sleeper
cells with men like Sheikh could be activated.</TE>
<TE>   The risks to Musharraf, already severe from his oscillating
policies aimed at reining in terrorists in Kashmir to avoid a wider
war with India, will not measurably increase if he allows U.S.
officials access to Sheikh.</TE>
<TE>   Since it is a near certainty that some act of terrorism will occur
against foreign citizens on Pakistani soil while Sheikh's appeal is
under review, it is time for Musharraf to demonstrate the sincerity
of his commitment to the U.S. to help unravel the webs of terrorism
his intelligence agencies spent two decades spinning into a global
threat.</TE>
<TE>   To do so would be a final act honoring Pearl's memory.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Mansoor Ijaz, an American of Pakistani origin who worked with
moujahedeen leaders to bring about the 2000 cease-fire in Kashmir,

<LD>There is much to like in the Bush administration's sweeping plan to
provide more effective homeland security by reorganizing the federal
government. But the plan goes too far. And because studies suggest
that 70% of organizational mergers either fail or produce just
marginal benefit, Congress needs to think hard before acting.</LD>
<LD>   President Bush's plan for a Department of Homeland Security would
bring about 200,000 federal employees at 22 agencies under a single
roof, with a budget of more than $35 billion a year. Instead of
approving the administration's proposal, Congress should adopt a
simpler and less ambitious reorganization this year as a first step.
More complex and less urgent issues--such as how to reorganize the
government's scientific research and development activities to
provide more effective protection for our country--can be
contemplated next year.</LD>
<TE>   As a number of Democrats and Republicans in Congress have been
arguing for months, some type of reorganization and consolidation of
the federal government makes sense in response to terrorism. This is
especially true in situations where a number of existing agencies
perform closely related functions. Certainly it is a sound idea to
merge the Coast Guard, Customs Service and Border Patrol, as well as
parts of the Immigration and Naturalization Service, because they all
deal with the movement of people and goods across U.S. borders. It
also makes sense to reorganize the government in cases where federal
capabilities are very limited today. For example, we know that we
need much better fusion of intelligence data coming from the FBI and
CIA and other sources.</TE>
<TE>   We also must do a better job of protecting our national
infrastructure--not just airports and airplanes but trains and
subways, bridges and tunnels, power plants and power grids, large
buildings and stadiums and so on. This will require cooperation
between federal, state, local and private sectors.</TE>
<TE>   But there are other parts of the administration's plan that do not
make as much sense--such as putting under a new Department of
Homeland Security about $2.5 billion in health-related research, as
well as $1.2 billion in research in the physical sciences now done
primarily at California's Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories.
This proposal raises many more questions than it answers. For
example: Why is the research now done at Lawrence Livermore to be
under the department but the work done at the Department of Energy's
other main laboratories to stay put?</TE>
<TE>   Much research at places like Sandia and Los Alamos--the other two
big Department of Energy laboratories traditionally specializing in
nuclear issues--is relevant to homeland security as well. Scientists
at those facilities develop sensors for nuclear and biological
weapons, figure out how to clean up radiological or chemical
contamination, work with Russia to better secure its dangerous
weapons before they can be seized by terrorists, etc. Yet only
Livermore's budget would go to a Homeland Security Department.</TE>
<TE>   What is the case for reorganizing outstanding health research
institutes such as the Centers for Disease Control and the National
Institutes of Health? These organizations already do fine work
dealing with the bioterrorism threat. Are we sure the new plan, which
would take budgetary power out of the hands of health specialists and
give it to Homeland Security, would improve the situation? Moreover,
how can we divide up health research into civilian and military
units? Research on developing better antidotes to possible biological
attack is strongly related to investigations of various diseases.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, we have homeland security needs that do not involve
chemical, biological, radiological or nuclear weapons. How does the
Bush administration propose improving research for these priorities?
The Bush plan, which focuses only on weapons of mass destruction, is
silent on those matters. By contrast, a recent National Research
Council report talks about many other vulnerabilities--to the power
grid, to buildings, to our borders--where science may have a great
deal to offer. A better reorganization plan would address such
issues.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration is right to put scientific research
squarely on the homeland security agenda. But its first cut at how to
improve such research is unconvincing. Moreover, good research is
already being done to address the terrorist threat today, so it is
hard to see the case for urgent governmental reorganization.</TE>
<TE>   Congress should restructure the government for border security,
infrastructure protection and intelligence fusion as soon as
possible. But the science issue is one of several where patience is a
virtue. We should return to the issue next year once more urgent
matters are tended to, and after we have more time to consider our
options.</TE>

<HD>Why Not Clone Our Best and Brightest?</HD>
<DH>DNA with the right stuff could benefit our human heritage.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES P. PINKERTON</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Everybody but me seems to hate the idea of freezing Ted Williams with
an idea toward reviving him and his talents, maybe, some day.</LD>
<LD>   Bob Ryan, columnist for the Boston Globe, snarled that the late
baseball legend's son, John Henry Williams, was "reprehensible" and
"shameless" for arranging to have his father cryonically frozen in a
Scottsdale, Ariz., facility. Dean Juipe of the Las Vegas Sun sniped
that the younger Williams was "exploitative" for seeking,
potentially, to sell off his father's body--or perhaps just his
DNA--to fans and wannabes. Sally Jenkins of the Washington Post was
even more vehement, recalling that she had "learned in school that
there is a term for the idea that some people's DNA is more valuable
than others, and the term is fascism."</LD>
<LD>   Tough talk aside, most scientists don't believe it will ever be
feasible to thaw out and reanimate a body, as in one of the "Austin
Powers" movies. But most experts do forecast the possibility of
manipulating DNA--deoxyribonucleic acid, the source code of life
itself--so as to generate back-from-the-dead miracles from tiny
clumps of cells, as in "Jurassic Park." In May, a team of Australian
researchers announced that they were within a decade of reviving the
Tasmanian tiger, which went extinct in 1936. The last critters had
been preserved in ethanol, but even after seven decades of pickling,
their life code was still valid.</LD>
<TE>   "The supposedly dead DNA in fact reacts in the way live DNA does,"
one scientist told Reuters in May. "It makes molecule cloning
possible."</TE>
<TE>   If so, then it won't be hard to re-create another kind of
mammal--Homo sapiens. Speaking of fascism, wasn't that the plot of
the '70s novel and movie "The Boys From Brazil," in which a Nazi
scientist produces young Adolf Hitlers? Well, nobody wants a
neo-Nazi, let alone the real thing, but the technology to re-create
bad guys is already loose in the world. Indeed, clone tech is loose
in the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   Even allowing for the infinitesimal prospect of a junior Hitler
being hatched somewhere, most scientists are busy looking at the 100%
prospect of using new therapeutic cloning techniques to cure
here-and-now diseases. That logic is so strong that the President's
Council on Bioethics--handpicked by George W. Bush with an eye toward
banning all forms of human cloning, even for medical
research--couldn't agree on a common anti-cloning position when it
issued its report last week. So, most likely, progress toward cloning
will continue, albeit at different speeds, in the U.S. and other
countries.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Williams' last wishes should be respected. And if that
means cremation without the slightest DNA extraction, so be it. But
such a genetic annihilation would be an enormous loss to society
because Williams, famous for his 20:10 eyesight and natural swing,
would have much to offer medical researchers, kinesiologists and,
yes, possibly, future baseball players who might benefit from having
some of their DNA derived from the .344 lifetime hitter.</TE>
<TE>   Obviously this sort of bio-utilitarian approach will give some
folks pause. Yet the inescapable reality is that scientists are not
pausing at all but rather rocketing out even further, pushing DNA
manipulation far beyond such benign goals as making a better batter.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, researchers at the State University of New York at
Stony Brook announced they had synthesized a live polio virus from
chemicals, using a machine to tap out the virus' DNA code. In other
words, it's probably only a matter of time before science finds a way
to whomp up the perfect baseball player, or the perfect whatever,
from scratch materials.</TE>
<TE>   So the idea of using people as the basis for improving future
people suddenly seems rather congenial. The 19th century poet and
critic Matthew Arnold spoke of touchstones of excellence, arguing for
propagating "the best that is known and thought in the world."</TE>
<TE>   Why shouldn't we expand Arnold's concept to other sorts of
touchstones, to include the halest and heartiest of humans? Why not
strive for a cultural shift, in which the brightest and ablest among
us are encouraged to make one final, but also deeply enduring,
contribution to our common human heritage?</TE>

<HD>Cheney's Grimy Trail in Business</HD>
<DH>His career offers a textbook example of shady doings.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBERT SCHEER</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Vice President Dick Cheney has spent most of the past year in hiding,
ostensibly from terrorists, but increasingly it seems obvious that it
is Congress, the Securities and Exchange Commission, the media and
the public he fears. And for good reason: Cheney's business behavior
could serve as a textbook case of much of what's wrong with the way
corporate CEOs have come to play the game of business.</LD>
<LD>   The game involves more than playing loose with accounting rules,
as Halliburton Co. is accused of doing while Cheney was the
Texas-based energy company's chief executive.</LD>
<LD>   On Sunday, SEC Chairman Harvey Pitt, whom Cheney pushed for the
job, reluctantly turned on his sponsor and announced a vigorous
investigation of Halliburton's accounting violations.</LD>
<TE>   Recent business scandals, however, are also the product of legal
loopholes that allow firms to scoop up billions in unregulated
profits.</TE>
<TE>   It was just such loopholes that allowed the rise and subsequent
fall of Enron and telecom heavyweights like WorldCom--in the process
making CEOs like Dick Cheney very, very rich.</TE>
<TE>   Recall that Cheney was a political hack for most of his
professional life, first as a staffer in the Ford White House, then
as a congressman for a decade and after that as secretary of Defense
under the current president's father.</TE>
<TE>   During the Clinton years, however, Cheney took an extremely
lucrative five-year cruise into the private sector as chief executive
of Halliburton.</TE>
<TE>   After deciding, following an extensive search, that he would be
George W. Bush's best candidate for vice president, Cheney resigned
from the energy services company with a $36-million payoff for his
final year of corporate service.</TE>
<TE>   This journey from the public payroll to the corporate towers and
back left a slimy trail of conflict-of-interest questions. For
example, Defense Secretary Cheney conveniently changed the rules
restricting private contractors doing work on U.S. military bases,
allowing the Kellogg Brown &amp; Root subsidiary of his future employer,
Halliburton, to receive the first of $2.5 billion in contracts over
the next decade. When Cheney left to become CEO of the entire
company, he recruited his Pentagon military aide, Joe Lopez, to
become senior vice president in charge of Pentagon dealings, which
ultimately formed the most lucrative part of the otherwise ailing
company's business.</TE>
<TE>   Since returning to the public office, these disturbing patterns
have continued.</TE>
<TE>   In a scathing expose of Halliburton's military contracts, for
example, the New York Times revealed that the vice president's old
company had been the main beneficiary of the Pentagon's rush to build
anti-terrorism military bases around the world. This new work will
cost taxpayers many billions, and, according to Pentagon
investigators' estimates, without any cost controls the final bill
will be considerably higher than if the military's own construction
units do the work.</TE>
<TE>   Cheney denies having a role in securing those recent contracts, as
he does knowledge of Halliburton's alleged accounting improprieties.</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately for Halliburton's stockholders and employees,
parlaying his Pentagon contacts into profit has proved to be Cheney's
only major business success.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, CEO Cheney put Halliburton's future in doubt by
engineering the acquisition of rival Dresser Industries, a move
ballyhooed at the time as justification of his $2.2-million annual
salary and massive stock options.</TE>
<TE>   But the acquisition has proved to be a disaster because
Halliburton assumed Dresser's long-term liability under asbestos
lawsuits.</TE>
<TE>   Even without the Dresser acquisition, Cheney was running a failing
operation at Halliburton.</TE>
<TE>   The company, despite the government gravy garnered, had earnings
well below Wall Street's expectations--until it suddenly changed its
accounting rules. By assuming it would be able to collect on cost
overruns on myriad construction projects, Cheney's Halliburton was
able to inflate profits by $234 million over a four-year period.</TE>
<TE>   Halliburton failed to disclose its accounting shenanigans to the
SEC or the company's investors for more than a year afterward,
leading to more than a dozen lawsuits alleging fraud, including one
by Judicial Watch.</TE>
<TE>   And why are we not surprised that Halliburton's accounting firm
was Arthur Andersen, earlier this year convicted of obstruction of
justice for shredding documents in connection with Enron?</TE>
<TE>   Andersen's dubious methods have become the disgrace of American
accounting. Cheney, however, was sufficiently enamored with it that
in 1996 he glowingly endorsed the accounting firm in a video,
thanking it for going "over and above the just-sort-of-normal,
by-the-books audit arrangement."</TE>
<TE>   Of course, ordinary investors did not know they were getting less
than "by-the-books" auditing.</TE>
<TE>   It is especially ugly that the president and vice president, men
in a position to know just how sketchy the accounting practices of
public companies are, were so eager to make our Social Security
system a vehicle for pouring individuals' retirement money into a
stock market they knew to be a house of cards.</TE>

<LD>From the way Steve Cooley's G-men treated him, you might think that
Mitchell Crooks was a drug kingpin or Mafia don rather than an
unemployed party disc jockey with some lapses in his past. The
district attorney's decision last week to deploy a squad of
agents--which cuffed him with TV news cameras rolling and carted him
away on years-old warrants--looks too much like intimidation of
future witnesses in police brutality cases.</LD>
<LD>   Crooks was at a motel across from the gas station as police
officers were questioning Coby Chavis Jr. on July 6 about expired
tags on his car's license plate. When Crooks heard screams, he
grabbed his video camera. What he saw--and what the rest of the world
has now seen--was an Inglewood officer slamming a handcuffed Donovan
Jackson, Chavis' son, face-down against a police car.</LD>
<LD>   For his public service, Crooks has gotten 15 minutes of fame and
an armed escort to the Placer County jail. And what of Jeremy Morse,
the officer seen smashing 16-year-old Jackson on the car and then
punching him? He's home on paid suspension while a grand jury and a
slew of government agencies investigate the incident. Something's
askew here.</LD>
<TE>   Crooks had outstanding warrants for petty theft and a 5-year-old
hit-and-run accident in Northern California. After L.A. investigators
learned of those warrants, they swooped down on Crooks as he left a
CNN studio and stuffed him into a plane bound for Placer County,
where the warrants had been issued. They knew full well that news
cameras would tape the bust.</TE>
<TE>   The district attorney's office says it asked Crooks to testify
before the grand jury about what he saw and wanted him to turn over
his videotape so it could be authenticated. But according to Cooley's
office, the 27-year-old was evasive, spoke of warrants he needed to
"clear up" first and then hung up on investigators, raising their
suspicions. At that point, Cooley's office said, it ran his record.</TE>
<TE>   So far, no problem. But why orchestrate a four-alarm arrest?</TE>
<TE>   Cooley seems to be showing a taste for the footlights and the big
show. In May, his agents briefly shut down the tiny Metropolitan
News-Enterprise legal newspaper, throwing reporters and editors out
on the street while they looked for a document that the publisher
said he had already agreed to turn over. We'd bet Cooley would never
try this stunt at the Los Angeles Times or another large paper. As
with Crooks, he picked a vulnerable target and sought maximum
publicity.</TE>
<TE>   Cooley's intent in the Crooks case may not have been to intimidate
witnesses to police misconduct, many of whom may have
less-than-spotless records, but the chill from Crooks' arrest was
unmistakable.</TE>

<LD>President Bush spoke and the market swooned--again--when he declared
Monday that the economy was fundamentally sound and only suffering
from a "hangover" of the 1990s. Such cheerleading, it is obvious,
does nothing to end the market's crisis of confidence. Only by
embracing fundamental regulatory reforms can Bush reassure the public
and investors.</LD>
<LD>   With a vacuum at the White House, others are scrambling to lead.
Overwhelming Senate passage of Sen. Paul S. Sarbanes' accounting
reform bill and Coca-Cola Co.'s announcement that it will count stock
options as expenses are welcome--but not sufficient. The president
cannot remain AWOL, either from efforts to deal with his
administration's ethical taints or from crafting specific reforms.</LD>
<LD>   Unfortunately, Bush still does not seem to grasp the extent to
which his own administration has come under an ethical cloud. He
should authorize the Securities and Exchange Commission to release
any documents connected to his 1990 sale of stock in an energy
company of which he was a board member. The sale occurred shortly
before bad news about the company was made public.</LD>
<TE>   Bush also needs to clean house: He should dismiss both SEC
Chairman Harvey Pitt, whose close ties to the accounting industry
have forced him to recuse himself from dozens of cases, and Secretary
of the Army Thomas White, a former energy-trading executive at Enron.</TE>
<TE>   Now that the Senate has passed accounting reform, Bush can help
ensure that restive House Republicans support its chief aims: an
independent auditing board and a crackdown on accounting firms that
also do strategic consulting for the companies they audit. He could
at least endorse the idea that corporations should declare as an
expense the value of stock options they grant to employees. Coca-Cola
alone can't drag the rest of corporate America down the road of
honest bookkeeping.</TE>
<TE>   Top finance officials in California, New York and North Carolina,
who together control more than $200 billion in taxpayer funds and
public pension money, have joined to force investment banking firms
and brokerage houses doing business with them to eliminate the
conflict posed by touting stocks in which the brokerages have an
interest. However laudable that is, only federal regulations can
ensure uniform and reliable standards.</TE>
<TE>   The president who found a confident voice and claimed leadership
after 9/11 is floundering. The more that Bush hails the economy, the
more the public will see him as failing to take fundamental problems
seriously. The economy may be suffering from a hangover, but the
president isn't taking away the punch bowl.</TE>

<LD>The judicial systems of Pakistan and the United States both scored
successes Monday with the convictions of four men in the murder of
journalist Daniel Pearl and the guilty plea of "American jihadi" John
Walker Lindh. Both cases loom large because public victories in cases
related to the Sept. 11 terrorism have been scant.</LD>
<LD>   The trial of the four found guilty of kidnapping and murdering
Pearl in Pakistan was anything but ordinary. It was held at a closed
anti-terrorist court, about 100 miles from Karachi, the capital,
under extreme security.</LD>
<LD>   Inside the court too there was tension. Two judges had to be
replaced, one because he had heard the chief suspect, British-born
Ahmad Omar Saeed Sheikh, admitting his involvement, the other because
he couldn't control the unruly courtroom. In the end, the trial was
peaceful right through the sentencing: execution for Sheikh and life
terms for his co- defendants, which in Pakistan means a maximum of 25
years in prison.</LD>
<TE>   In February, when Sheikh was arrested, the United States asked for
his extradition. Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf denied the
request, asserting that Islamic extremists should witness a Pakistani
court trying and punishing those guilty of the crime. The message has
been sent, though as a statement from Pearl's family noted, other
likely accomplices in the murder are still to be caught. In addition,
the possible involvement of Pakistan's own intelligence services in
the case is yet to be investigated.</TE>
<TE>   The defendants said they would appeal, and one issued a naked
threat. "We shall see who shall die first, either I or the
authorities who have arranged the death sentence for me," Sheikh
declared in a statement read by his lawyer. Pakistani authorities
should act speedily on the expected appeals to narrow the window for
unrest. They should also allow U.S. authorities to question Sheikh,
which Pakistan has refused to do so far.</TE>
<TE>   In Virginia, where Lindh surprisingly pleaded guilty Monday to
aiding the Taliban, prosecutors emphasized his agreement to cooperate
"fully, truthfully and completely" in the investigation of terrorism.
Lindh, now facing a maximum of 20 years in prison, escaped a possible
life sentence. The government got to protect its sources and
evidence.</TE>
<TE>   Lindh, 21, who grew up in Marin County, was an instant pariah
after his capture in Afghanistan last year. Although his family has
done all it can to project an image of him as merely a misguided
youth, Lindh acknowledged in court: "I provided my services as a
soldier to the Taliban" last year, carried a rifle and hand grenades,
and "did so knowingly and willingly."</TE>
<TE>   Lindh's parents have their son alive. Pearl's family has only the
foundation they have established in his name. One of its projects
will be to translate into Urdu some of Pearl's stories for broadcast
on Pakistani radio, to show who Pearl was in his own words.</TE>

<HD>Mental Health Insurance Gets Some Analysis</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>In "Mental Health Insurance Parity Is an Empty Notion" (Commentary,
July 8), David Cohen and Keith Hoeller state that "no physical test
detects or confirms the presence of any mental illness." I find it
ironic that in the same edition there appears "The Body of
Knowledge," an article about an electroencephalogram developed by Dr.
Ian Cook at UCLA's Neuropsychiatric Institute, which proves just the
opposite.</LD>
<LD>   Cohen and Hoeller appear to be members of a small coterie that is
determined to thwart effective medical treatment of the mentally ill
by the medical profession. Of course, the HMO industry delights at
the possibility of their success, which would allow it to escape
another responsibility.</LD>

<TE>   Cohen and Hoeller's commentary is right on the money. Health
insurance normally will pay for anything from a broken leg to a
lingering disease, but in the case of mental health there is nothing
but the lingering disease. I've seen many people go into the mental
health system, but I've never seen anyone come out. If the subject
runs out of money, the treatment stops; otherwise the "disease" goes
on forever. I have my doubts whether these people are helped,
frankly. But I don't have any doubt about what "parity" would do to
the cost of health insurance.</TE>

<HD>Digital Cameras Don't Tell the Whole Story</HD>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Filming Without the Film" (July 11), describing industry reaction to
the emerging presence of digital and high-definition motion picture
cameras, painted an unnecessarily apocalyptic portrait of life with
this new technology. As a filmmaker who has worked in both mediums
(film and digital video), I can tell you that regardless of what box
is sitting on top of the tripod, a director must still arrive on set
and figure out where to put that box, what to point it at, what lens
to attach to it, how to light the scene and what to do with the
actors. Fundamental storytelling techniques have nothing to do with
the image-capture device being used.</LD>
<LD>   What the article does not investigate is whether the traditional
"shoot and pray" process doesn't actually require a more muscular,
more nimble and more disciplined imagination. Could it be that the
instant gratification proselytized for by digital and high-def
evangelists actually results in less accomplished storytelling?</LD>
<LD>   David Dodson</LD>
<TE>   La Canada</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The big issue your article does not address is the conversion of
movie theaters to digital projection. The studios would love to save
the millions of dollars spent on making and shipping thousands of
bulky film prints at the last minute to theaters across the country.
Making and shipping disks or sending a film via satellite
transmission to the theaters would be much cheaper and faster. But
who will pay for the theaters' digital conversion, which currently
runs about $100,000 per screen? Probably not the theater chains,
which are nearly bankrupt from the last decade's multiplex-building
mania. Will the studios be willing to foot the bill?</TE>
<TE>   The article also mentions that directors and camera operators are
worried about making the transition from film to digital. What about
the film editors, negative cutters, lab employees and other
below-the-line workers who actually work with film? While no studio
heads would dare to ask Oliver Stone or cinematographer Roger Deakins
if they are qualified to work in digital cinema, they are already
laying off post-production personnel whose experience is primarily in
film.</TE>

<TE>   The choice of acquisition formats for movies is not an either/or
situation. Film, high-definition and digital video are all part of a
palette of tools now available to filmmakers. They can be used
individually or combined to create the images that best tell the
story. One does not herald the death of another. Oil paints endured
as new paint media were developed. Paintings continue to be created
even though we have had photographs for quite a while now.</TE>
<TE>   What happens to movies acquired on HD as we know it today with the
emergence of tomorrow's digital technologies? Indeed, 35mm film
continues to have resolution superior to any digital format. A film
from 50 years ago can be restored and shown in all its beauty. I have
yet to see similar results from productions shot on video 10 years
ago.</TE>

<LD>Re "A School Flails in a Sea of Chaos," July 14: The plight of
15-year-old Ray Torres, who had to get away from Fremont High School
to find a place to learn, breaks my heart. As a substitute teacher
for the L.A. Unified School District, I have seen many youngsters
like Torres; they are the quiet ones with pleading eyes, beaten down
by chaos created by classmates. Torres' precious hours of learning
have been hijacked by these disrespectful punks, who are ubiquitous
and multiethnic--West Valley, South Central; doesn't matter where.</LD>
<LD>   Students who want to learn are hostages to other students'
self-centered antics. It baffles me why parents aren't mad as hell.
Test scores would improve dramatically if the troublemakers were
compelled to be quiet and listen. If they choose not to learn, at
least they should not be allowed to prevent others from learning.</LD>
<LD>   Although some of the schools' physical plants are tattered and
depressingly dark, there is no lack of excellent books, resources and
teachers. The LAUSD also has an effective system of tracking
attendance. The key to helping students like Torres is the school
principal, who is captain of the ship and imposes the overall
atmosphere.</LD>
<TE>   Cristina Forde</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The article only mentioned one parent, Dolores Torres, and she was
busy getting her son out of Fremont. There are at least 3,000
students attending Fremont. What about the parents of these students?
A 16-year-old reading at third-grade level was once an 8-year-old in
the third grade. One hundred and fifty parents showing up at a
meeting leaves a couple of thousand staying home, uninvolved with
their children's education.</TE>
<TE>   Where are these parents when their children are growing up to
become the illiterates and gang members (who else would mark up the
textbooks with graffiti?) who are the shame of Fremont and their
families?</TE>
<TE>   Abraham Hoffman</TE>
<TE>   Canoga Park</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I read with shock, but not much surprise, about a condition of
education so abysmal that the state must send auditors to Fremont to
assess the problem and to recommend solutions. Don't taxpayers
already pay a fair salary plus an undoubtedly hefty expense account
to a former governor of Colorado to take charge of this kind of
thing? And didn't a former superintendent, known for his
troubleshooting ability, establish several mini-superintendents whose
jobs, it would seem, include taking charge of this kind of thing?
What are they all doing? What about their lack of preparation and
training to do the job? Maybe the state should address this also.</TE>

<LD>The overwhelming congressional vote approving Yucca Mountain
apparently has had no effect on the fanatics looking to put an end to
nuclear power (July 10). Having failed to thwart the democratic
process, they now are attacking the shipment of spent nuclear fuel.
Transporting nuclear waste poses essentially no risk to the public.
There have been thousands of shipments of nuclear fuel over the last
few decades without a single incident that threatened the public. The
containers are designed to withstand tremendous impact and fire, and
these shipments will be carefully routed and monitored.</LD>
<LD>   This country needs to get on with dealing with nuclear waste
rather than leaving it to sit indefinitely at the reactors. If we are
concerned about risk, we need to take into account whether letting
the fuel simply sit in fuel pools or outdoor silos is a better
solution.</LD>

<LD>Re "Sect Hacked Into TV, China Says," July 9: I was born and raised
in Los Angeles, and I had the opportunity to live in China and teach
English there three years ago, when it was safe to practice Falun
Gong exercises in public. I asked one of my students to teach me, and
in a short time I was waking at sunrise to practice the tai chi-like
exercises and meditation in a nearby park, which was brimming every
morning with Falun Gong practitioners. What was notable about the
practitioners I met was their tranquillity; they were quiet, yet
friendly.</LD>
<LD>   I left China in July 1999. Since then, my former student and his
mother have been jailed because they practice Falun Gong, and another
Chinese friend has been tortured by police. The Chinese government's
persecution against the Falun Gong is well documented.</LD>
<LD>   Now, Falun Gong practitioners are allegedly disrupting China's
state-run broadcasts with images of the meditation practice. China's
leadership publicly vows to punish Falun Gong practitioners for this
"crime." Let's take a step back. This month marks three years that
Chinese police have slandered, tortured and murdered Falun Gong
practitioners. I think it is easy to see who has committed the crime.</LD>

pagodas and peasants with horse-drawn wagons alongside black Audis.</TE>

economically with China. Funny, I had always thought it was the other
way around.</TE>

<HD>Louise Elian, 96; Harpist With Studio, Broadway Orchestras</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Louise Klos Steiner Elian, 96, a harpist whose music was heard on the
original scores of such classic movies as "Gone With the Wind" and
"Casablanca," died July 7 in West Palm Beach, Fla. The cause of death
was not reported.</LD>
<LD>   Elian was a leading harpist during Hollywood's golden era of the
1930s and '40s. She was married for 10 years to Max Steiner, a
pioneer of original film music, who scored "Casablanca," "Gone With
the Wind," "The Informer," "Now, Voyager" and other memorable films.</LD>
<LD>   Elian performed on all those films, as well as "King Kong,"
"Modern Times," "Thief of Bagdad" and many musicals starring Fred
Astaire and Ginger Rogers.</LD>
<TE>   Born in St. Joseph, Mo., she began studying music as a young child
and fell in love with the harp after moving to Los Angeles and seeing
one in a store window when she was 12. By 17, she was playing at the
Hollywood Bowl, and by 22, she was working in studio orchestras.</TE>
<TE>   After her divorce from Steiner, she worked in Europe for several
years, where one of her jobs was to teach Peter Ustinov to play the
lyre for the movie "Quo Vadis." When she returned to the U.S., she
played in Broadway orchestras.</TE>
<TE>   In 1963, she married floral designer Frederick Elian, who died in
1983. She continued to perform with symphonies well into her 80s.</TE>

<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>David Asseo, 88, who as chief rabbi of Muslim-dominated Turkey for 41
years repeatedly called for interfaith tolerance, died Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   About 25,000 of Turkey's 67 million residents are Jews, most of
them descendants of Spanish Jews who fled to Turkey in the 1400s.</LD>
<LD>   Asseo was rabbi in 1986 when Istanbul's largest synagogue, Neve
Shalom, was attacked by gunmen who killed 22 worshippers during a
Sabbath service.</LD>
<TE>   His funeral was scheduled to take place at that synagogue, whose
name means "oasis of peace" in Hebrew.</TE>
<TE>   Born in Istanbul in 1914, Asseo studied at a Jewish school on the
Greek island of Rhodes, graduating in 1933 with a diploma permitting
him to teach Hebrew and Jewish subjects.</TE>
<TE>   He later served as a member of the Jewish court, the Beth Din.</TE>
<TE>   He spoke Hebrew, French, Italian, Greek and Ladino, a language
based on medieval Spanish that is spoken by Turkish Jews.</TE>
<TE>   Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit called Asseo "a fine clergyman who
always defended inter-religious understanding and served for the
peoples' happiness."</TE>

<HD>Maritta Wolff Stegman, 83; First Novel a Sensation</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DENNIS McLELLAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Maritta Wolff Stegman, who created a literary sensation with the 1941
publication of "Whistle Stop," a vivid tale depicting the underbelly
of small-town American family life that she wrote when she was 22 and
which Sinclair Lewis hailed as "the most important first novel of the
year," has died. She was 83.</LD>
<LD>   Stegman, who wrote six novels under the name Maritta M. Wolff and
then stopped writing in the 1960s, died of lung cancer July 1 at her
home in West Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   She was a senior at the University of Michigan when she wrote a
novel-length story for an English composition class. The story about
a poor, shiftless and vulgar family living in a small town near
Detroit earned her the university's Avery Hopwood Award for Fiction
in 1940.</LD>
<TE>   A year later, Random House published her novel, describing
"Whistle Stop" as "a fiercely honest, tough, bare-knuckled excursion
into the seamy side of American small-town life."</TE>
<TE>   That the novel, which includes raw language and unflattering
characters, including a subtly depicted portrayal of an incestuous
relationship between a brother and sister, was written by a college
student only added to reviewers' appreciation for Stegman's talent.</TE>
<TE>   "Miss Wolff knows too many things not discoverable around any
campus. She knows almost too much," wrote a reviewer for the New
Yorker. "Miss Wolff has no right to be so ruthless and so mature at
twenty-two. This is by way of saying that 'Whistle Stop' is a
stunning performance for a young girl."</TE>
<TE>   In the wake of Stegman's literary debut, a writer for the New York
Times referred to her as "the precocious Michigan prodigy" who
"writes of the seamy side of life with glittering skill and a brutal,
brawling, turbulent sense of character and human drama."</TE>
<TE>   Stegman, who graduated Phi Beta Kappa with a bachelor's degree in
English composition, was born Maritta Martin Wolff on Christmas Day,
1918, in Grass Lake, Mich. She grew up on her grandparents' nearby
farm and attended a one-room country school.</TE>
<TE>   "I apparently began to write as soon as I grasped the essentials
of penmanship--plays, poems, shorts stories," she said in a 1941
interview. "My one hobby, if you liked to call it that, was
developing, as far back as I can remember, even under the handicap of
my somewhat isolated life in the country, an inordinate interest in
people and anything and everything happening to them."</TE>
<TE>   Her daughter-in-law, Laura Stegman, said: "When she got old
enough, she told me, she loved to sit in bars and listen to stories
people would tell her."</TE>
<TE>   Her field work paid off in realistic dialogue, such as this
exchange from "Whistle Stop":</TE>
<TE>   "Clim Hawkins, you open that door and let her get outa this car.
Her nerves are all shot to hell. She didn't know what she was doin'."</TE>
<TE>   "Go on, scram!" Clim said. "I'm taking her home with me, see?
We're married, ain't we? There ain't a law in the land says I can't."</TE>
<TE>   In a 1942 review of her second best-selling novel, "Night Shift,"
a reviewer for the New York Times wrote of Stegman's flair for
dialogue:</TE>
<TE>   "One feels certain this is a scientifically exact record of the
speech of factory workers in an automobile bumper plant, of taxi
drivers, waitresses in cheap restaurants, beautiful dumb women and
beautiful smart ones who haunt small-time nightclubs."</TE>
<TE>   "Whistle Stop" was turned into a 1946 movie starring George Raft
and Ava Gardner, although it was toned down by Hollywood censors.
"Night Shift," retitled "The Man I Love," became a 1946 film starring
Ida Lupino.</TE>
<TE>   Stegman, who moved to Los Angeles in the late 1940s, wrote five
other novels published by Random House, including "About Lyddy
Thomas," "Back of Town," and "The Big Nickelodeon" (a 1956 Hollywood
novel that a reviewer for the Los Angeles Times called "the best in
its field since Budd Schulberg's 'What Makes Sammy Run?' ").</TE>
<TE>   Her final novel, "Buttonwood," was published in 1962, although she
wrote another that was never published.</TE>
<TE>   "They were going to publish it, but there were discussions with
her to make edits that she didn't want to make," said Laura Stegman.
"She was very stubborn about things."</TE>
<TE>   That extended to turning down her publisher's requests that she do
publicity for her novels.</TE>
<TE>   "She basically said, 'I write the books, and you do the
publicity,' " Stegman said. "If she couldn't do things the way she
wanted to, she just wouldn't do it."</TE>
<TE>   In the end, "She just said, 'Well, OK, I'm not going to write
anymore.' "</TE>
<TE>   Although Stegman never wrote another novel, her daughter-in-law
said, she maintained a voluminous correspondence with hundreds of
friends and fans.</TE>
<TE>   And she never got rid of the manuscript for her unpublished novel,
storing it in her refrigerator.</TE>
<TE>   "I guess she figured it was the safest place for it," Stegman
said.</TE>
<TE>   Stegman's first husband, novelist Hubert Skidmore, author of the
controversial 1941 social protest novel "Hawk's Nest," died in a
house fire in 1946.</TE>
<TE>   She is survived by her second husband, Leonard Stegman, whom she
married in 1947; and their son, Hugh, of Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   A memorial service will be held at 4 p.m. July 29 at Pierce
Brothers Westwood Village Memorial Park, 1218 Glendon Ave., Westwood.</TE>

<HD>Long Beach's Steel Magnolia</HD>
<DH>Politics: Mayor Beverly O'Neill adores her job, and for
voters the feeling is mutual. But don't let that grandmotherly charm
fool you.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NANCY WRIDE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's July 3 at Long Beach City Hall, and a piercing emergency alarm
sends jittery staffers scurrying to the stairs.</LD>
<LD>   Anchored in the stairwell is Mayor Beverly O'Neill. Like a regal
room mother in a burgundy suit, the 71-year-old O'Neill smiles
reassuringly, pats fleeing secretaries, shaken like the rest of the
country by warnings of possible Fourth of July terrorism.</LD>
<LD>   "It's probably nothing," she says to one as the alarm keeps
wailing. "I wouldn't worry," she tells another.</LD>
<TE>   This is not part of her job as the mayor of California's
fifth-largest city, but it is who O'Neill is. Such a gesture only
begins to explain her remarkable victory last month as a termed-out
mayor returned to office by 16,500 write-in votes.</TE>
<TE>   The stunning upset made her belle of the recent national mayors'
conference and further sealed her image as an accomplished and
stately municipal steward--although she's prone to quote Mae West at
civic functions.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever one feels about her civic progress--and she has her
critics--it's hard not to find inspiration in the copper-haired
O'Neill and her personal narrative: A devastating childhood with her
father, the town drunk who eventually sobered up, and a mother who
founded what became the family support group Al-Anon and ran it from
the family's living room.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neill married her high school beau, put herself through college
by working seven years at J.C. Penney, became a music teacher,
founded a women's center for returning older college students and
rose to become president of Long Beach City College.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neill's first and only spin in politics has been as mayor of a
city she adores. To those who courted her for higher office, she has
graciously made it clear that she won't leave her hometown.</TE>
<TE>   "She loves Long Beach," said daughter Theresa O'Neill, 43, a Los
Angeles television writer. "First I said she replaced me with a
schnauzer. Now I think she replaced me with a city."</TE>
<TE>   Even detractors acknowledge that O'Neill, who takes the oath of
office today, has played feel-good ambassador for a city whose morale
and finances tanked after the Navy shipped out and the aerospace
industry was downsized. The twin blows claimed 50,000 jobs from the
local economy even before the early 1990s recession rocked the city
harder than most.</TE>
<TE>   Understanding O'Neill requires knowing about her whole life, not
just the public years, the four decades in which she rose to lead a
college and a city.</TE>
<TE>   Before she was born, her parents moved from South Dakota to Long
Beach for a better life. But her childhood, she has said, was branded
by the shame of her father's drinking. She dreaded her own wedding
for fear of a scene. From under this cloud, she and her mother,
Flossie Lewis, eventually emerged into happier times.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neill grew up Baptist, singing in the church choir. She sang the
lead in musical productions, including Yum-Yum in "The Mikado," at
Polytechnic High School, where a classmate recalled her sunny humor
and empathy. Under all that good cheer, friends and family say, was
resilience; more than a few refer to her as a steel magnolia.</TE>
<TE>   Being the child of an alcoholic leaves certain imprints, according
to Al-Anon literature, which evolved long after O'Neill's mother
helped pioneer the concept after putting a 24-hour hotline in her
home. One characteristic is overachievement. Another is self-reliance
born of uncertainty. Both traits course through O'Neill's life.</TE>
<TE>   Take her college education. She earned not one, but five teaching
credentials. She was certified for kindergarten, elementary, middle
and high school and to act as a curriculum supervisor and general
administrator.</TE>
<TE>   A generation later, when her daughter graduated from USC and
announced that she would become a writer, the need for a safety net
echoed in O'Neill's first thought: "You'd better get a job waiting
tables. Just in case," O'Neill said.</TE>
<TE>   While growing up, her worldview was a small one. She had never
been to a Chinese or Mexican restaurant before falling for the fellow
high school senior who would become her husband, Bill O'Neill.</TE>
<TE>   "He's brilliant," she said simply. "He finished college in three
years and got his master's in one. He had bigger goals than I did. He
had visions of a great future, seeing the world. The world I was in,
we planned for Saturday night."</TE>
<TE>   Bill joined the Navy, and the couple married Dec. 21, 1942, on his
weekend leave from boot camp.</TE>
<TE>   "Beverly spent our 'honeymoon' in a San Diego motel room," Bill
O'Neill said, "writing thank-yous." Yes, he grinned, that is so
Beverly.</TE>
<TE>   Knowing the spouse behind the mayor reveals much about her. Now
slowed by flagging health, Bill O'Neill, a retired USC English
professor, is more of a bookworm homebody. He delights in his wife's
civic adventures, just as she enjoyed his academic capers.</TE>
<TE>   "Beverly thrives off of working with people, whereas my work
involved a lot of reading and writing, a more solitary existence,"
Bill O'Neill said. "People ask me, 'Doesn't it bother you to be first
man, walking down the beach with the first dog?' But," he added with
a chuckle, "no, it really doesn't bother me. What's not to like?"</TE>
<TE>   The couple, who have lived mostly in duplexes they rented or owned
on the quietly rich Long Beach peninsula, will soon move into their
first oceanfront home. The house was owned by a lifelong friend, the
late niece of author Willa Cather. And fitting for a reader like Bill
O'Neill, the property features a shack that was once home to
muckraker Upton Sinclair.</TE>
<TE>   This type of lore is what one acquires by living in one place. One
also acquire friends, in O'Neill's case principals, lawyers and
bankers, among others. Such bonds accelerate a politician's ability
to get things done, O'Neill's fans say. And she would add that it
works both ways.</TE>
<TE>   "I have people I went to high school with who call me up and tell
me what I should be doing with the city.... For a city of a half a
million people, it really is a very small-town feeling here, which is
what makes it so special," she said.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, if ever you want to "get Bev's ears back," said Ray
Grabinski, an outgoing councilman who lost the mayor's race to
O'Neill, "criticize this city or its people."</TE>
<TE>   Rarely does anyone see her temper flare, nor do they disrespect
her in public. But at a public hearing six years ago on the future of
the Long Beach Naval Station--preserve historic buildings that
generate no city income or pave it as a lucrative cargo container
dock?--you could see both.</TE>
<TE>   PBS television host Huell Howser who had portrayed the issue on
his show, came to side with historians who sued to block the dock
plan.</TE>
<TE>   "She was booed at. She's not used to anyone saying boo. There's
another side of Beverly O'Neill that most people don't see, and I saw
that side," said Howser, recalling that O'Neill was visibly rattled.
"That's not a condemnation of her, not a scathing rebuke. I want to
be quoted saying there's more there than what meets the eye. She's a
hard-nosed politician who's used to having her way."</TE>
<TE>   One day "she called me in to work her Beverly O'Neill magic on me,
to invite me into her inner sanctum to work her grandmother charming
magic," Howser said. "She basically felt the negative publicity was
hurting the city, but she ... quickly saw that I couldn't be charmed
out of my position. Behind that office door of hers, there's some
nut-cracking going on. She's a street fighter and a political
animal."</TE>
<TE>   Ultimately, the property will be used by the Port of Long Beach,
but O'Neill would probably dispute the last point, stating that she
feels like a politician in name only.</TE>
<TE>   But whatever its title, O'Neill has a gift for building
relationships with officials in a position to help her city. One
example: Andrew Cuomo, former Housing and Urban Development
secretary.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neill applied to HUD twice to win the city empowerment zone
status, which can infuse cities with millions of federal dollars for
renewal. She worked closely on the proposed zone, which encompass St.
Mary Medical Center, with Cuomo, a Roman Catholic.</TE>
<TE>   Long Beach was not chosen. The next time Cuomo saw O'Neill at a
mayors' conference he fell to his knees and said, "Forgive me father,
for I have sinned."</TE>
<TE>   O'Neill later got sisters at the hospital to pose with her for a
photo, wagging their fingers at the camera. She sent it to Cuomo.</TE>
<TE>   "Dear Mayor," Cuomo replied on HUD stationery. "Of all the agents,
lobbyists, devices, and advocates used against me in my six years at
HUD, never has anyone deployed the ultimate weapon: shame and guilt.
And the nuns as ambassadors? Brilliant! I will do whatever I can do,
so help me God! Best, Your Friend, Andrew."</TE>
<TE>   His vow to help O'Neill in the city's next attempt for the
empowerment zone was based on the hope that Al Gore would win the
White House and Cuomo would still be around.</TE>
<TE>   But the city never got the empowerment zone.</TE>
<TE>   Still, O'Neill's style of leadership and her reputation drew the
interest two years ago of a doctoral student in UCLA's school of
education, Edward Ogle, who was casting about for a model of what he
calls "transformational leadership."</TE>
<TE>   Ogle, associate vice president for academic affairs at Upper Iowa
University, wanted someone who is successful but, more important,
helps others succeed. He focused on O'Neill's effort to found the
Long Beach City College women's center, which helped hundreds of
housewives become community leaders.</TE>
<TE>   After months of research, Ogle was impressed. "There was no end to
the number of people whose lives had actually been changed by their
experience with her," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The professors reviewing his dissertation accused him of
canonizing O'Neill.</TE>
<TE>   "There must be some negative. Where is the dirt?" they asked. He
met again with O'Neill to ask about negative experiences en route to
success.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neill, he said, recounted one of the events that defined her

<HD>Police Arrest 15 in Ecstasy Sweep</HD>
<DH>Drugs: A ring allegedly led by Israeli nationals is
believed to have been the major supplier for the South Bay. Officers
seize 26,000 tablets.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANDREW BLANKSTEIN and CAITLIN LIU</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A law enforcement task force investigating an Ecstasy ring allegedly
run by Israeli nationals culminated a two-month probe with the
arrests of more than a dozen people--most from the San Fernando
Valley--and the seizure of more than $8 million worth of the
hallucinogenic drug, Torrance police said Monday.</LD>
<LD>   Investigators from the Torrance and Glendale police departments
and the U.S. Customs Service seized 26,000 tablets of Ecstasy, 17
pounds of marijuana, weapons and $44,000 in cash, said Officer David
Crespin, a Torrance police spokesman.</LD>
<LD>   "This is a monumental seizure given the quantity and the street
value," Crespin.</LD>
<TE>   The arrests were made July 3 in Encino, Sherman Oaks and Studio
City and on Sunday in Van Nuys and Reseda.</TE>
<TE>   Fifteen people were booked on charges ranging from possession of
narcotics, drug sales and transporting drugs for sale, to forgery,
armed robbery, carjacking, assault with a deadly weapon, possession
of a loaded firearm in a vehicle and drug trafficking within 1,000
feet of a school.</TE>
<TE>   Arrested were Sami Atias, 24; John Melkoun, 30; and Rafi Shotland,
34, all of Sherman Oaks; Louis Amorim, 28, and Maxim Gorin, 25, of
Encino; John Folinsky, 29, and David Kaylan, 32, of Los Angeles; Kobi
Amasum, 31, and Moshe Matsri, 35, of Reseda; Robert Ananian, 34, of
Montebello; Darren Wayne Lebrecht, 31, of Studio City; Jessica Alison
Altman, 20, of Calabasas; Roston Aliktsann, 39, of Hollywood; Tal
Brisman, 27, of Tarzana; and Nery Atias, 28, of Van Nuys.</TE>
<TE>   The investigation began in Torrance and Glendale and eventually
took narcotics detectives to Encino, Sherman Oaks and Van Nuys.</TE>
<TE>   After seizing the Ecstasy from Valley homes July 3, police were
conducting surveillance on drug suspects Sunday when they witnessed
an armed robbery and carjacking at a home in the 4900 block of Van
Nuys Boulevard, said Sgt. Tom Lorenz, supervisor of the Glendale
narcotics unit.</TE>
<TE>   "All of a sudden, the buyers started pulling out guns. They
attempted to rob the dealers," Lorenz said. Police then stepped in
and arrested the suspects.</TE>
<TE>   Ecstasy, also known as MDMA, is a synthetic stimulant and
hallucinogenic that induces a euphoric high and heightened sensory
sensations. Use of the drug can result in long-term brain damage,
organ failure and death.</TE>
<TE>   The drug began showing up in the 1990s at all-night dance parties
called raves and has been rapidly gaining popularity across the U.S.
the last five years, according to the federal Drug Enforcement
Administration. Authorities seized 7.2 million Ecstasy tablets in
2001, compared with 400,000 in 1997.</TE>
<TE>   Popular among drug dealers because of its large profit margin, an
Ecstasy pill costs about 50 cents to manufacture in illegal labs and
can sell for as much as $40 on the street, law enforcement
authorities said. In Los Angeles, considered a port of entry for the
drug, a tablet fetches about $20 on the street, according to police.</TE>
<TE>   The size of the bust "just verifies what everyone believes: L.A.
is a major distribution center for Ecstasy," said Steve Woody,
associate special agent in charge of the Los Angeles office of the
U.S. Customs Service.</TE>
<TE>   Many suspects arrested Sunday are Israeli nationals, police said.
Just as Colombians dominate the U.S. cocaine market, Israelis have a
large stake in the Ecstasy trade, Lorenz said.</TE>
<TE>   Those arrested are believed to be responsible for 90% of the
Ecstasy going into Torrance, Manhattan Beach, Hermosa Beach and
Redondo Beach, and police said the busts were a significant blow to
the operation, Crespin said.</TE>
<TE>   Several suspects are being held in lieu of $1-million bail, while
others are being held without bail, Crespin said.</TE>
<TE>   Police plan to present their case to the district attorney's
office today.</TE>

<HD>Cargo Theft Unit Falls Victim to Budget Cutbacks</HD>
<DH>Crime: The demise of the special team distresses some law
enforcement officials and shippers at the nation's busiest port
complex.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LOUIS SAHAGUN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department is eliminating a special
unit created to fight the growing problem of cargo theft, drawing
fire from law enforcement officials and shippers who say the action
is ill-advised in the nation's capital of truck hijackings.</LD>
<LD>   Cargo Cats, as the multi-agency unit is called, costs Sheriff Lee
Baca's department about $1.5 million a year and has recovered an
estimated $18 million worth of stolen freight, trucks and trailers in
the last year.</LD>
<LD>   Since its inception in 1990, authorities said, the unit has been
responsible for 1,150 felony arrests and the recovery of an estimated
$176 million in stolen items, including computers, clothing, frozen
pastries, car parts, lightbulbs and dog food.</LD>
<TE>   "I'm shocked that this is happening, because of the void it will
create," Sgt. Jim LeBlanc, who has been assigned to the unit for
eight years, said Monday. "I don't think you can find a more
productive law enforcement task force operation anywhere in the
country."</TE>
<TE>   But Baca, under pressure from the county Board of Supervisors to
cut $60 million in services from his $1.6-billion budget because of
new operating costs, decided that the unit, which has its
headquarters in Long Beach, could be eliminated.</TE>
<TE>   The sheriff was unavailable for comment Monday. But Chief of
Detectives Mike Soderberg said, "We made a decision to cut
non-life-saving units." In addition to Cargo Cats, the hate crime
unit and other services will be cut.</TE>
<TE>   "We hate that this is happening. Cargo Cats is one of our most
productive units. Our position is this: The sheriff didn't cut these
units; the Board of Supervisors cut them by a 3-2 vote," said
Soderberg. The cuts were recommended by Baca and then accepted by the
supervisors.</TE>
<TE>   Cargo Cats Lt. Joe Arteaga said, "We're out of business effective
Aug. 4." The unit quit accepting new cases July 5 and has started
reassigning working cases to the nearest sheriff's substation.</TE>
<TE>   Facing a sudden vacuum in security at the nation's busiest port
complex, cargo companies and freight security organizations across
the nation have been lobbying Baca and the Board of Supervisors to
reconsider.</TE>
<TE>   Many of those firms have donated thousands of dollars to Cargo
Cats over the years to help defray costs related to informants' fees
and storing information about criminal activity.</TE>
<TE>   "What they're doing is beyond comprehension," said Joe Baker,
executive director of the National Cargo Security Council. "To see
Cargo Cats closed up tears my heart apart."</TE>
<TE>   In a letter to Baca, John J. Tomancy, director of corporate
security for Warnaco Group, a $2-billion apparel conglomerate that
moves 3,000 containers and 1,500 full trailer loads through the Port
of Los Angeles each year, asked, "Why should I feel comfortable
operating in Los Angeles County if I have no qualified help to turn
to if we have a load stolen?"</TE>
<TE>   Warren Hoemann, vice president of the California Trucking Assn.,
which represents 2,500 companies, said, "Our members have been
writing, both to Sheriff Baca and the Board of Supervisors, urging a
continuance of the unit....</TE>
<TE>   "This is very sad news, and it sends the wrong message at a time
when cargo theft is rampant," Hoemann said. "Our members feel they
are losing the most effective measure available for combating those
who would hijack trucks and steal loads."</TE>
<TE>   Because of the severity of the problem in Southern California,
where the FBI estimates that nearly $1 billion worth of cargo is
stolen annually, Los Angeles Port Police Chief Noel Cunningham has
begun assembling a new unit to take the place of Cargo Cats.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the sheriff is making a big mistake. But we can't allow
this vacuum in security," Cunningham said. "So we are working with
other law enforcement agencies to come into the fold."</TE>
<TE>   Because of the regional nature of cargo theft, Cargo Cats was
formed by combining officers from the Sheriff's Department, the Los
Angeles and Vernon police departments, and the FBI. It is largely run
by the Sheriff's Department.</TE>
<TE>   The unit made 367 arrests and recovered nearly $52 million in
stolen property during its first two years.</TE>
<TE>   The unit's efforts have been directed not only at thieves--who
steal trucks at gunpoint or plunder them in storage yards--but also
at the so-called brokers. Like drug kingpins, brokers keep themselves
isolated and above the operations, setting up deals to store and sell
stolen goods to independent retailers or ship them to Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   Over the years, Cargo Cats has cultivated informants who have
helped the unit track down stolen cargo and conduct sting operations.
Though it focuses on cargo moving through the ports, the unit
operates countywide and has served as a model for similar operations
coast to coast.</TE>
<TE>   The unit has logged the region's latest hijacked trailers and
victimized warehouses on a large memo board in its headquarters. On a
recent day, the board's list included $650,000 worth of electronics
equipment stolen in Los Angeles, $296,000 worth of watches taken in
San Bernardino, $170,000 in men's shirts stolen in Rialto and
$175,000 in electric razors stolen in Carson.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles has become a hijackers' paradise, authorities say,
because the pickings are plentiful. More freight moves through the
adjacent Los Angeles and Long Beach harbors than anywhere else in the
nation, an estimated $200 billion worth each year.</TE>
<TE>   The volume of the mind-numbing variety of merchandise passing
through the ports is expected to triple within 20 years.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no doubt," said Baker, "that property crime--especially
in the field of stolen cargo--will drastically increase in Southern
California if Cargo Cats is allowed to close its doors."</TE>
<TE>   Soderberg would not argue with that.</TE>
<TE>   "We had to cut $60 million," he said. "We had some tough decisions
to make."</TE>

<HD>Owner of Dogs Sentenced in Mauling Death</HD>
<DH>Court: Judge who threw out verdict of murder gives woman
four years in prison.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN M. GLIONNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>Refusing to apologize to the victim's family and friends, a
stern-faced Marjorie Knoller was sentenced Monday to four years in
prison for her role in the gruesome dog mauling death of a neighbor
that shocked this pet-friendly city.</LD>
<LD>   The sentence issued by Superior Court Judge James Warren means the
47-year-old attorney will serve another 14 months behind bars,
considering time she has already spent in custody awaiting trial and
good behavior credits.</LD>
<LD>   Knoller and her attorney husband, Robert Noel, 61, had been
charged in the January 2001 death of Diane Whipple, a 33-year-old
lacrosse coach mauled by the couple's two Presa Canario dogs in the
hall of a luxury Pacific Heights apartment building.</LD>
<TE>   Noel, who was not present during the attack, was sentenced last
month to four years.</TE>
<TE>   At one point during Monday's hearing, Warren waited several long
moments for Knoller to respond to a prosecutor's challenge that she
apologize and provide the case a sense of closure.</TE>
<TE>   "The only thing that would bring some peace, I think, to everyone
who knew Diane is if this woman here, this lawyer, who lied at least
52 times, who mocked Diane Whipple and blamed her for her own death,
would stand up as a human being and say, 'I'm sorry. I wish I hadn't
done these things. I'm responsible and I'm ready to pay the price,' "
Deputy Dist. Atty. James Hammer told the court.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, Knoller kept her head down, scribbling in a note pad. Her
attorney, Dennis Riordan, then rose to say that the hole left in the
lives of Whipple's friends and family would be just as great whether
the result of negligent homicide or accident.</TE>
<TE>   Knoller's silence later brought an angry response outside court
from Whipple's partner, Sharon Smith.</TE>
<TE>   "She has been an attorney from day one--she hasn't acted as
human," said Smith, who has a wrongful-death civil suit pending
against the couple.</TE>
<TE>   "So we had an attorney to the end. She's not going to say she's
sorry. She probably doesn't even believe she's responsible for this."</TE>
<TE>   The sentencing comes one month after Warren drew criticism by
throwing out a second-degree murder conviction against Knoller handed
down by a Los Angeles jury in March, a ruling that has been appealed
by prosecutors.</TE>
<TE>   Had the judge let the verdict stand, Knoller would have faced 15
years to life in prison.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, despite arguments by Knoller's attorneys that Warren
could not legally impose any sentence until the state's appeal was
decided, he ordered prison time for her on two lesser convictions.</TE>
<TE>   He sentenced her to four years for involuntary manslaughter and
issued a deferred three-year sentence for keeping a dangerous animal.</TE>
<TE>   The latter sentence would be dropped if she did not break the law
for five years after her prison release.</TE>
<TE>   The judge said he gave the stiffest possible sentence allowed by
law because he believed Knoller lied in court and to a grand jury
about whether the two dogs, Bane and Hera, were vicious. Both animals
have been destroyed.</TE>
<TE>   He also denied Knoller probation, citing a lack of remorse and
that she "knowingly inserted into society two massive, dangerous,
unpredictable dogs with the knowledge that sometime, someplace,
someone was going to get hurt."</TE>
<TE>   He ordered her, along with Noel, to pay Smith $6,800 in
restitution. He allowed her 714 days of time served and good behavior
credit and directed that she be transferred to the Valley State
Prison for Women in Chowchilla.</TE>
<TE>   As Warren read the sentences, San Francisco Dist. Atty. Terence
Hallinan, who sat at the prosecutor's table, turned to offer a
playful punch in the arm to Hammer.</TE>
<TE>   An emotional Hammer then turned to make eye-contact with Smith,
who sat in the first row of spectators.</TE>
<TE>   Moments later, Hallinan called the sentence "half a loaf," saying
that Knoller would at least spend time in prison until an appeals
court decides whether Warren was justified in dismissing the murder
conviction.</TE>
<TE>   If the ruling is overturned, Hallinan explained, Knoller would be
brought back to face the more severe sentence.</TE>
<TE>   But if the appeals court decides Warren was right and that Knoller
is entitled to another trial, he said, prosecutors would probably not
pursue that avenue because it would constitute double jeopardy.</TE>
<TE>   Hallinan also took a swipe at Knoller and Noel, who last year
adopted as their son Paul "Cornfed" Schneider, a Pelican Bay prison
inmate they helped by raising the dogs that killed Whipple.</TE>
<TE>   "Meanwhile," Hallinan said, "both she and Robert are in state
prison along with their adopted son and are going to be there for a
decent period of time."</TE>
<TE>   Hallinan said he also saw no point in charging Knoller with the
perjury that prosecutors alleged, since she will already be heading
to prison.</TE>
<TE>   Knoller's lawyers left court without commenting to reporters.</TE>
<TE>   Whipple died Jan. 26, 2001, after being attacked by the two
dogs--which each weighed about 100 pounds--as she struggled to get
inside her upper-floor apartment.</TE>
<TE>   At her trial, Knoller testified that she had tried to save Whipple
by yanking at the leash of one dog, Bane, and by sprawling on top of
Whipple.</TE>
<TE>   But Warren on Monday repeated several statements Knoller made that
he believed to be false.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors also submitted briefs showing what they said were at
least 52 times Knoller perjured herself.</TE>
<TE>   Said Hammer: "We could have gone on. We stopped there."</TE>
<TE>   The case has provoked such vitriol that hundreds of residents had
written Warren, some demanding the death penalty, others calling for
total acquittal.</TE>
<TE>   The judge began Monday's hearing by responding to comments made
last month by both Hammer and several of Whipple's friends that by
throwing out the second-degree murder conviction against Knoller he
had destroyed "a sense of justice" held by many San Franciscans.</TE>
<TE>   "I certainly hope so," he said, clearly irritated. Repeating "a
sense of justice," he likened the idea to vigilante violence, the
work of the Ku Klux Klan and to "the people who flew airplanes into
buildings not so long ago."</TE>
<TE>   He said an emotion-fueled verdict was what he had tried to avoid.</TE>
<TE>   Later, Smith said she disagreed.</TE>
<TE>   "Part of what Judge Warren said was right, that justice has to
come from within. But he did steal justice from me by taking away
that murder conviction. Absolutely."</TE>

<HD>Attias Faces No Easy Future After His Committal to Mental
Hospital</HD>
<DH>Punishment: He was convicted of murdering four people with
his car, and a finding of insanity has set off fierce debate.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WILLIAM OVEREND</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>He plowed his high-powered Saab through a crowd of pedestrians near
UC Santa Barbara last year, then jumped from his car shouting: "I am
the angel of death!"</LD>
<LD>   Last month, a jury convicted David Attias of four counts of
second-degree murder--a verdict that would have sent the 20-year-old
college student to prison for at least half a century.</LD>
<LD>   But eight days later, the same Santa Barbara jury found Attias
legally insane. That vastly changed the young man's prospects;
technically, he could be set free in just half a year.</LD>
<TE>   When a judge committed Attias on Friday to Patton State Hospital
in San Bernardino, the outcome renewed the debate over the treatment
of the mentally fragile one-time college student, who looks more like
Harry Potter than a wild-eyed killer. Outraged relatives of those who
were killed as they strolled along an Isla Vista street see a
pampered young man.</TE>
<TE>   Some fear he will win release from the hospital in just a few
months or years, perhaps benefiting from the connections of his
television director father.</TE>
<TE>   Defense lawyers say their client's path won't be nearly that easy.
They predict that Attias will be locked away in a mental hospital for
much of his life.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe all of it. Connections don't count at Patton State Hospital,
they say, and it's no country club.</TE>
<TE>   There may be truth in both arguments.</TE>
<TE>   Attias would have been sentenced to 60 years to life in state
prison and, under the law, would have had to serve more than 50. In
the state's toughest prisons, his surroundings would have been
extremely unforgiving.</TE>
<TE>   In contrast, at a state mental hospital, he at least has the
opportunity for an earlier release. But Attias does not face an easy
future at Patton, where he will endure a world of regimentation,
medication and therapy that can be described as lenient only when
compared with a life in prison.</TE>
<TE>   Contrary to some popular belief, it historically has been tougher
to get out of mental hospitals in California than prisons. A 1985
study of confined murderers showed that those who went to mental
hospitals spent an average of more than seven years there, while
those sent to prisons remained an average of less than four years.</TE>
<TE>   That has changed as the result of almost two decades of
increasingly tough laws and policies. Murderers sent to prison now
spend at least twice as much time locked up as those placed in mental
hospitals, officials estimate.</TE>
<TE>   A life sentence for first-degree murder often means just that now.
And most convicted of second-degree murder are kept beyond the
15-year minimum, even though they are eligible for parole after 85%
of that time has been served, officials say. Attias would have been
sentenced to four consecutive terms of 15 years to life.</TE>
<TE>   To be freed from a state mental hospital, a patient must be
cleared by hospital psychiatrists, community mental health officials
and, finally, a judge. All must be convinced that the patient is
sane, able to function in society and no longer a danger to himself
or others.</TE>
<TE>   Those confined to the hospitals have found it increasingly
difficult to win their freedom.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a probability he will never get out," Dr. Kaushal
Sharma, a clinical psychiatrist in Newport Beach predicted of Attias.
Sharma is a frequent trial consultant on insanity issues and former
Patton State Hospital advisor.</TE>
<TE>   "At Patton there is a dual role--to treat, but also to protect
society," Sharma said. "The staff isn't going to be jumping up and
down to let him out tomorrow. Meanwhile, he will be profoundly better
off than in a prison."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Patton State Hospital may be a far cry from the grim lockdown life
in the state prison system, but it is far from cushy.</TE>
<TE>   There are trees and open space. But there is barbed wire, too, and
Department of Corrections guards patrol the perimeter.</TE>
<TE>   There are about 250 patients in the state's four mental hospitals
who have committed homicides, 156 of them at Patton. That compares
with a total of 22,000 in the state prison system, just one
indication of how infrequently insanity defenses have been attempted
and have succeeded.</TE>
<TE>   Ultimately, hospital officials said, Attias will probably end up
in one of the 1,300-patient facility's long-term care units. But in
the next few days, he can expect to be in Admissions Unit.</TE>
<TE>   Wake-up is at 6 a.m. Then patients make their beds, wash and eat
breakfast. Morning medications are at 8. Then there are "treatment
groups" that range from music appreciation to anger management and
weight training.</TE>
<TE>   A regime of head counts, multiple medication breaks and some
leisure time continues through the day. Lights out: 10 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   "This kid's going to be frightened when he comes here," said Brad
Smith, chief of the hospital's forensic office and the main liaison
between the hospital and the courts.</TE>
<TE>   "But our atmosphere is very different than prison," Smith said.
"There is a very different type of a mental reality here. We are
trying to get our patients to realize they are part of the human
race."</TE>
<TE>   On a recent morning, the mood was peaceful on the grounds and
inside the hospital wards. Outside, a small group of Native American
patients formed a circle in one area, chanting. Others sprawled on
the grass or sunned themselves on benches.</TE>
<TE>   In one of the long-term care units, Edward Charles Alloway sat
alone on a cot. Now 64, Alloway was found not guilty by reason of
insanity after a 1976 shooting spree at Cal State Fullerton that
killed seven people. A judge blocked his latest attempt for release
last December, saying Alloway remains a danger to the community.</TE>
<TE>   Eventually, Attias is also likely to end up in a long-term care
unit in a room with three others. The patients sleep on cots and the
walls are bare.</TE>
<TE>   The average homicide commitment at Patton is more than 10 years,
officials said. But many, like Alloway, are there much longer, and
some will never get out, hospital psychiatrists said.</TE>
<TE>   The exception is a patient like Alfred Polhmeier, a Ventura County
man who strangled his wife for snoring. Polhmeier spent a little more
than a year at Patton before his release to a community care program
and, finally, to his family in 1999. But he was 94 and nobody saw him
as a danger.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Along with the state hospitals, a key component in dealing with
legally insane criminal defendants is California's Conditional
Release Program, known as ConREP, which was established in 1986.
There are 21 locally run agencies treating 720 patients in facilities
that operate like half-way houses.</TE>
<TE>   If one of those agencies disagrees with the psychiatrists about a
patient's potential danger to society, it can block release. That
happened in a multiple murder case as recently as February, when
Ventura County ConREP officials blocked the movement of a
double-homicide patient Miguel Hugo Garcia, 48, from Patton into
community treatment.</TE>
<TE>   High-profile murder cases get particularly intense scrutiny, at
all levels, experts agreed.</TE>
<TE>   "One of the things we have to take into account is strong
community sentiment," said Dr. Stephen W. Mayberg, state mental
health director. "We might decide [the patients] aren't strong enough
yet to face that."</TE>
<TE>   John Vacca, a Los Angeles County public defender who now heads
central felony operations, formerly supervised his office's mental
health legal department.</TE>
<TE>   "The liberal psychiatrists, if there ever were some, have fled to
the hills long ago," Vacca said. "It's a complete myth to believe
that there are hordes of psychiatrists waiting to say, 'Let this
person go.' "</TE>
<TE>   There is widespread agreement with that view among psychiatrists.
And for good reason, they said.</TE>
<TE>   "The reality is that there is great concern on the part of mental
health professionals to be very conscious of the possibility of
repeated violence," said Dr. Ron A. Blanchette, a psychiatrist who
has worked in both public and private sectors in Los Angeles and
Ventura counties.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   While the average stay in mental hospitals has been slowly
increasing, any individual's time of commitment remains uncertain.
The length of Attias' term in state prison would have been more
definite.</TE>
<TE>   The average prison term for murder in California has skyrocketed,
with determinate sentencing rules and tougher penalties for violent
crimes.</TE>
<TE>   "Back in the '70s, you could try for parole after seven years in
first-degree murder convictions," said Ventura County Dist. Atty.
Michael D. Bradbury, twice head of the state District Attorneys Assn.
during 24 years in office. "I remember cases where people actually
got probation for second-degree murder." Parole for murderers is
virtually unheard of during the administration of Gov. Gray
Davis--who has paroled only two murderers since taking office.</TE>
<TE>   Those convicted of a single second-degree murder now probably
average more than 20 years behind bars, according to Marilyn
Kalvelage, chief of institutions operations for the state Department
of Corrections.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Volumes have been written on the question of legal sanity and how
juries decide who goes to prison and who goes to a state hospital.</TE>
<TE>   But mental health and law enforcement officials agree that
emotion, rather than logic, often is the determining factor. Juries
tend to imprison those they fear most, regardless of their level of
sanity.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the murderers doing time in state prison have more serious
mental problems than most of their counterparts at Patton, the
experts say.</TE>
<TE>   "If you are really scary, a Jeffrey Dahmer or somebody like that,
you're going to be found guilty" and sent to prison, said Bradbury,
the district attorney. "A jury isn't going to take a chance that you
will ever be able to get back out.... The really crazy people? A lot
of them are roaming the cell blocks."</TE>
<TE>   The state's top mental health official agreed.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't prove this, but I think that when crimes are really,
really bad, juries find these people guilty," Mayberg said. "They do
take the nature of the crime into consideration."</TE>
<TE>   Throughout his trial, Attias projected a nonthreatening image.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm sure the courtroom appearance didn't hurt," said public
defender Vacca. "But I thought there also was a strong showing of
prior mental illness on his part. Assuming you have a person who
clearly is mentally ill, they are much better off in a mental
hospital than state prison."</TE>

<HD>Memorial Honors the Last of the Hollywood Moguls</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID PIERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>One by one, they stood up to tell how Lew Wasserman had affected
their lives: the Arkansas governor he helped turn into a U.S.
president; the Oscar-winning director whose career almost was
short-circuited when he didn't hit it off with screen legend Joan
Crawford; the Roman Catholic cardinal who found a non-Catholic
willing to help out the church's poorer schools.</LD>
<LD>   Wasserman, viewed by many as the last of the Hollywood moguls, was
their great friend. So said former President Bill Clinton; so said
director Steven Spielberg; so said Los Angeles Cardinal Roger M.
Mahony.</LD>
<LD>   On Monday, they came and stood with 3,000 to 4,000 other mourners
at the Universal Amphitheatre in Los Angeles at a moving, yet upbeat,
memorial service for Wasserman, who died of complications from a
stroke on June 3.</LD>
<TE>   The legendary former talent agent, who built MCA Inc. into a
global entertainment powerhouse, was 89.</TE>
<TE>   For decades, Wasserman had been an influential force in the worlds
of entertainment and politics, and now many had come to pay their
last respects.</TE>
<TE>   Among the guests were former Vice President Al Gore; Gov. Gray
Davis; former First Lady Nancy Reagan; House Minority Leader Richard
A. Gephardt; Los Angeles Mayor James K. Hahn; AFL-CIO President John
Sweeney; actors Kirk Douglas, Warren Beatty, Jodie Foster, Sharon
Stone and Debbie Reynolds; MGM owner Kirk Kerkorian; DreamWorks
co-founder Jeffrey Katzenberg; director Ron Howard; and even John
Ratzenberger, the actor who played a mailman on the sitcom "Cheers."</TE>
<TE>   With the nation mired in business scandals, a number of speakers
used the opportunity to say that, unlike those responsible for the
accounting messes that have roiled such corporations as Enron and
WorldCom, Wasserman was one corporate leader who ran a good ship.</TE>
<TE>   At a time when business executives are under criminal scrutiny,
noted Barry Diller, chairman of Vivendi-Universal Entertainment, "Lew
was the gold standard."</TE>
<TE>   It was Wasserman, Diller recalled, who created profit sharing for
Universal employees.</TE>
<TE>   "When it came to people, he was only interested in long-term
commitment. I learned so many things from him," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Sidney Sheinberg, the former president of MCA Inc. and longtime
No. 2 executive under Wasserman, said, "Nobody ever wondered about
the corporate integrity of our finances, and you never had to worry
about Lew knowing what's on our balance sheets."</TE>
<TE>   That's not to say that Wasserman's company--dubbed "The Octopus"
in its heyday--escaped critical scrutiny.</TE>
<TE>   The Justice Department forced Wasserman to split off his talent
agency business from MCA's movie operations in 1962.</TE>
<TE>   And in the 1980s, the company was investigated for alleged ties
with organized crime, but no executives were charged.</TE>
<TE>   Wasserman's biographers also noted his friendship with the late
lawyer Sidney Korshak, identified in congressional testimony as the
liaison between Hollywood and the Chicago mob, but no one ever
accused Wasserman of the kinds of corporate misdeeds being levied
against some executives today.</TE>
<TE>   One former studio official who knew him well said Monday: "He
never skated on the edge; he never even came close."</TE>
<TE>   When discussing corporate earnings and potential bad news,
Wasserman reportedly said, "Let's get it out and put it in the
report, then we can always have good news later."</TE>
<TE>   Clinton, for his part, said he had intended to accompany his wife,
Sen. Hillary Rodham Clinton (D-N.Y.), to the service, "but since
Lew's money helped put her [in the Senate], I figured it would be
best if she stayed and do what she's supposed to do."</TE>
<TE>   The former president said he met Wasserman when he was governor of
Arkansas, eager to see more films made in his state.</TE>
<TE>   "Lew shot the whole idea down," Clinton said, with a glint of
humor.</TE>
<TE>   Then he added: "He helped me become president. He helped me stay
president. He helped me become a better president."</TE>
<TE>   Sweeney told the crowd that it might seem ironic that a labor
leader would fly across the country to honor a corporate executive,
"but this was not a corporate executive. He started off at the
bottom, and he never forgot where he started from.</TE>
<TE>   "Lew Wasserman left giant footprints for all of us to follow."</TE>
<TE>   "Grown men would quiver" when Wasserman was angry, said actress
Suzanne Pleshette.</TE>
<TE>   But, Pleshette noted, "they had no idea he lived in fear of a
5-foot, 2-inch woman"--his wife, Edie, who used to wag her finger at
him when she was upset.</TE>
<TE>   An emotional Jack Valenti, president of the Motion Picture Assn.
of America, called Wasserman's passing the end of an era.</TE>
<TE>   "The bridge to Hollywood's past and future is down and may never
be rebuilt because its largest giant among us is gone," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Spielberg related a famous Hollywood tale about how Crawford had
tried to get him fired from directing a television pilot when he was
just starting out. Wasserman told Crawford, "Don't be angry, because
they'll fire you before they fire him.' "</TE>
<TE>   Spielberg called Wasserman his "guardian angel ... a living time
machine to that golden era."</TE>
<TE>   Paramount studio chief Sherry Lansing said the heartfelt tone of
the speeches moved her to tears as well as laughter, and left her "in
awe of the accomplishments of his life." Although the memorial was
billed as a high-security, invitation-only event, it was not
difficult for passers-by to wander in.</TE>
<TE>   The amphitheater, which holds 6,000, appeared about two-thirds
full.</TE>
<TE>   Among the mourners were a number of ordinary people who crossed
paths with Wasserman, from waitresses who served him lunch to former
Universal telephone repairman Jack Rellaford, who just a few months
ago went to Wasserman's Beverly Hills home to fix one of his 20 phone
lines.</TE>
<TE>   "He's probably one of the last kingmakers from my generation,"
Rellaford said.</TE>
<TE>   "He was always a gentleman to me. I came here to show my respect."</TE>
<TE>   Kaye Coleman, a waitress at Nate 'n Al's deli in Beverly Hills,
where Wasserman ate breakfast at her table every weekend for 30
years, related how people often would approach him and try and strike
up a conversation as he sat with his grandson, Casey, spreading cream
cheese on a bagel. Wasserman, a famously private man, would politely
tell them to call him at work during the week because he did not want
business to intrude on his family time.</TE>

<HD>O.C. Faces Divisive Vote on Sewage</HD>
<DH>Oceans: Full treatment called 'business killer.' Other side
says clean water trumps low taxes.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEAN O. PASCO and DAVID REYES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Orange County is as famous for its miles of surfer-friendly beaches
as for its staunch anti-tax politics.</LD>
<LD>   This week, the county is going to have to choose between the two.</LD>
<LD>   Beset over the last three years by a series of beach closures
triggered by pollution, county officials will decide Wednesday
whether to continue dumping partly treated sewage into the Pacific
about four miles off Huntington Beach. The alternative is to boost
the level of treatment the sewage receives--a pricey proposition that
would increase the fees paid by many businesses and homeowners.</LD>
<TE>   Despite the cost, the plan has gained support from some unlikely
sources, including a conservative county supervisor, a GOP
assemblyman and 10 city councils.</TE>
<TE>   To many, the vote marks a critical test: whether Orange County is
willing to put taxpayer dollars behind the often-stated goal of
improving beach water quality.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a legacy vote," said Jan Vandersloot, one of many
environmentalists who have lobbied the county sanitation district to
boost sewage treatment. "It will show how [the county] wants to
approach water quality for the future."</TE>
<TE>   Environmentalists have tried to make the case that cleaner beaches
are crucial to the county's economy, pointing to the heavy losses
Huntington Beach merchants suffered in the summer of 1999 when the
city's beaches were off-limits because of high bacteria levels.</TE>
<TE>   But the business community has come out squarely against the plan,
saying it would hurt big companies and may devastate small ones.</TE>
<TE>   Disneyland now pays $430,000 a year in sewer fees. The total would
rise to $1 million by 2015 under a rate-increase plan tied to
increased water treatment.</TE>
<TE>   Cost to Business</TE>
<TE>   "Going to full ... treatment is a business killer," said Placentia
Councilman Norman Z. Eckenrode. His city is home to a jam and jelly
company run by Knott's Berry Farm with about 125 employees. Its
annual sewer bill, according to estimates provided by the sanitation
district, would rise from $180,000 to $466,000 by 2015.</TE>
<TE>   Eckenrode fears the bills will result in an exodus of small
companies. "They're likely to say, 'Goodbye, Orange County. We're
headed for Riverside County or Mexico.' "</TE>
<TE>   The Orange County Sanitation District holds a waiver from the
Environmental Protection Agency that allows it to treat sewage at a
less stringent level than what is required by most of the nation's
16,000 other sewage agencies.</TE>
<TE>   No definitive evidence shows that sewage dumped into the ocean
caused the beach closures in Huntington and elsewhere. A recent study
by the district could not determine a cause for the pollution, but
also could not rule out the sewage.</TE>
<TE>   Still, support for dropping the waiver has come from across the
political spectrum. Jim Silva, a conservative county supervisor with
strong anti-tax credentials, is asking the Board of Supervisors today
to adopt a resolution urging more treatment. Assemblyman Ken Maddox
(R-Garden Grove) has sponsored a bill in the Legislature that would
prohibit the county from seeking an extension of the waiver.</TE>
<TE>   To some, this broad coalition reflects the changing political
dynamics in Orange County, and how safe politicians feel advocating a
policy that might result in higher fees as long as the issue--notably
the environment--is close to the hearts of voters.</TE>
<TE>   'A Quality-of-Life Issue'</TE>
<TE>   Protecting the beaches "is a quality-of-life issue that goes to
the core of what it means to be living in Southern California," said
Fred Smoller, head of the political science department at Chapman
University in Orange. "This is a visceral issue for people. Clean
water trumps low taxes; it's just that simple."</TE>
<TE>   The sanitation district board has been debating for months whether
to renew the waiver. Although the issue is cutting across ideological
lines, a geographic split is emerging. Opposition to the waiver is
strongest in coastal areas, while many officials in inland cities
have yet to take a position.</TE>
<TE>   The sanitation district now treats sewage with what is called a
50-50 blend before it is dumped into the ocean. All of the sewage
gets primary treatment. Half of the sewage then gets a secondary
treatment, which removes suspended solids such as fecal debris,
bacteria and viruses.</TE>
<TE>   If the county doesn't get its waiver renewed, it would have to
perform secondary treatment on all sewage. Officials said they would
have to build a new facility at a cost of up to $430 million.</TE>
<TE>   Eckenrode and business leaders said the county should continue
with the waiver but explore less expensive ways to treat sewage, such
as microfiltration, ultraviolet radiation and reverse osmosis.</TE>
<TE>   Environmentalists said that's not enough and believe the public
agrees with them.</TE>
<TE>   "They're grossly misreading the public if they think the public
won't support this," said Chris Evans, head of the Surfrider
Foundation in San Clemente.</TE>
<TE>   Other environmentalists dispute the costs of secondary treatment
reported by the sanitation district, calling them scare tactics.</TE>
<TE>   They note the district has $500 million in its reserve fund but
has been slow in dealing with the issue.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the same old problem in Orange County. No one is willing to
step up and lead," said Frank Caterincchio, a longtime Republican
political consultant.</TE>

<HD>Lone Attacker Suspected in Slayings of 4</HD>
<DH>Crime: Investigators say arrested neighbor may have argued
recently with one of the victims.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD WINTON, JOSE CARDENAS and RICHARD MAROSI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The 23-year-old man arrested in the grisly quadruple slayings of a
South Whittier family probably acted alone, and may have quarreled
recently with one of the victims, authorities said Monday.</LD>
<LD>   Alfonso Ignacio Morales, a former security guard, is suspected of
raping and killing his niece's best friend and murdering the friend's
mother, father and great-grandmother.</LD>
<LD>   Described as a close friend of the slain family, Morales also
worked part time as a computer repairman for the father, Miguel Ruiz,
38, investigators said.</LD>
<TE>   Though a motive was still unclear, investigators were probing
whether a recent falling out between the men had triggered the
rampage, said Lt. Ray Peavy of the Los Angeles County Sheriff's
Department.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not clear on the motive ourselves," he said. "What could
cause an individual to do what he did?"</TE>
<TE>   Asked if Morales alone could have caused a crime scene he
described as one of the most grotesque he has ever seen, Peavy said
it was possible.</TE>
<TE>   When authorities arrived at the one-story house Saturday morning,
they found, in separate rooms, the bloodied bodies of Ruiz; his wife,
Maritza Trejo, 41; their 8-year-old daughter, Jasmin; and Ruiz's
grandmother, Ana Luisa Martinez, 79.</TE>
<TE>   Blood stains covered the walls and ceilings, and the house had
been ransacked, with drawers emptied and furniture overturned,
authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   Jasmin had been sexually assaulted and stabbed to death.
Investigators said the other family members also had suffered greatly
before being bludgeoned. They said the bodies had been dragged from
room to room. Investigators said they believe the slayings occurred
sometime Friday.</TE>
<TE>   The amount of blood in the home reflected "a struggle," Peavy
said. "It is like a movie murder scene. In the movies, they tend to
overdo the bloody scene. In this case, it looked like an overdone
movie scene."</TE>
<TE>   Investigators focused on Morales as a suspect after interviewing
neighbors and reviewing evidence at the scene. Bloodhounds led them
to search his car.</TE>
<TE>   Morales has been cooperative since his arrest Sunday,
investigators said. He was being held without bail, and was scheduled
to be arraigned this morning.</TE>
<TE>   Morales' arrest has been a double emotional blow to members of his
family, who were close friends of the Ruizes. They lived eight houses
away, and Morales' niece, Candace, was a constant presence at the
Ruiz home.</TE>
<TE>   "How do you think we feel? I cannot even bring myself to think
about what they say he did," said Yvonne Ybarra, Morales' sister.</TE>
<TE>   Ybarra, who lives in a cottage behind the home where her brother
lived with her mother and stepfather, said she had no idea why
authorities suspect that her brother killed the four neighbors.</TE>
<TE>   The slayings have shaken the quiet, working-class neighborhood.
Residents erected a makeshift memorial near the Ruiz home and filled
it with candles, teddy bears and handwritten notes.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the notes evoke the memory of Jasmin, a popular,
bright-eyed girl who was a top student at her elementary school. Some
of the crayon drawings by children picture Jasmin as an angel. "My
heart is sad, but heaven is more beautiful with you," reads one card
dedicated to her.</TE>
<TE>   Neighbors and investigators said Morales had a long and close
relationship with the Ruiz family. He often drove over to the house
in his Ford Mustang convertible and chatted outside with Ruiz. He
recently sold the family a boxer dog.</TE>
<TE>   Morales worked for Ruiz, who operated a computer repair business
at his home, investigators said. Ruiz, they said, had been teaching
Morales almost daily for much of the last year. But the visits had
fallen off recently.</TE>
<TE>   Though investigators suspected a feud might have prompted the
slayings, they were not ruling other possibilities. Peavy said
numerous possible murder weapons had been recovered from the home,
and that a "great deal" of property was missing.</TE>
<TE>   Brent Turvey, the author of a book on criminal profiling, said the
nature of the slayings suggests the killer perceived himself to be
part of the Ruiz family. "It can be similar to stalking behavior with
celebrities. He has a fantasy in his mind of his relationship with
the family," Turvey said. "This is pure rage."</TE>
<TE>   Morales obtained a security guard's license in 2000, which expired
earlier this year. According to the state Department of Consumer
Affairs, Morales obtained the license to work for Paragon Protective
Services in San Gabriel.</TE>
<TE>   Kevin Flanigan, a department spokesman, said Paragon had ceased
doing business in May. Under the law, Morales had 60 days after his
guard license expired Jan. 31 to seek another license, Flanigan said.</TE>
<TE>   Neighbor Art Arriaga said he knew Morales as a friendly,
soft-spoken man who has often worn a black security guard's jacket
and heavy Army-style boots around the neighborhood.</TE>
<TE>   Morales once warned him that someone had tried to break into his
car, Arriaga said. "He said not to worry about the neighborhood. He'd
take care of it," Arriaga said. "To me, that time he was a good
neighbor.</TE>
<TE>   "Even right now, I cannot fathom what he did in there. To see him
and what happened in there, they don't match."</TE>

<HD>Westin Supporter to Seek 3rd Term</HD>
<DH>Politics: Ventura County college district president
believes the chancellor should stay. Faculty union says Nagel won't
run unopposed.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>AMANDA COVARRUBIAS and MARGARET TALEV</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The president of the Ventura County Community College District Board
of Trustees said Monday that he will seek a third term in November,
despite threats from critics that his support of embattled Chancellor
Philip Westin will cost him his job.</LD>
<LD>   Trustee Norman Nagel, 59, and his board colleagues are expected to
decide Westin's fate during a special closed-door meeting tonight.</LD>
<LD>   He shrugged off mounting pressure from the public and the faculty
union to fire Westin for charging the district more than $119,000 for
business-related expenses from 1997 to 2001.</LD>
<TE>   Nagel, a Thousand Oaks orthodontist first elected to the board in
1994, said he does not feel any additional pressure, despite the
political drama unfolding around him.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think there's any more pressure this time than any other
time," Nagel said. "It's the same group of banner-waving, flag-waving
individuals as four years ago. It's the same people with the same
agenda."</TE>
<TE>   Specifically, Nagel said, the faculty union wants him and his
board colleagues to oust Westin for what they consider excessive
spending on meals, computer equipment, automobile repairs and other
items. An audit cleared Westin of violating district policy or of
criminal wrongdoing.</TE>
<TE>   "Does his action warrant discharge?" Nagel said. "No, I don't
think his actions warrant discharge at all."</TE>
<TE>   Although it knew of Westin's spending practices, the board voted 4
to 1 in May to award the chancellor a new four-year contract and a
$30,000 raise, bringing his annual salary to $203,000. After Westin's
spending was made public, critics demanded that he resign or be
fired.</TE>
<TE>   Trustees have since vowed to monitor Westin's spending and to
develop policies that will place limits on his expenses. But
opponents say that is not enough.</TE>
<TE>   "Norm Nagel is a very proud man and a very stubborn man," said
Larry Miller, president of the Ventura County Federation of College
Teachers, the local chapter of the American Federation of Teachers.</TE>
<TE>   "He doesn't see the big picture," Miller said. "I'm not sure the
union even has to mount a vigorous attack. I think the taxpayers are
going to outstrip us in terms of being vigorous. They're outraged.
He's not going to run unopposed."</TE>
<TE>   Trustee John Tallman, who voted against renewing Westin's
contract, and board Vice President Art Hernandez also face reelection
in the fall. Both have said publicly that they favor removing Westin
as chancellor.</TE>
<TE>   Trustee Allan Jacobs, whose term expires in 2004, is the subject
of a recall effort by a conservative Republican organization for his
continued support of Westin. Trustee Bob Gonzales has not said
whether he has changed his mind about his support of Westin. He has
not been not targeted for recall.</TE>
<TE>   Nagel said that if he does not take a stand now, a new board and a
new chancellor will face similar political pressure when a new
administration refuses to cater to the union's demands.</TE>
<TE>   "They'll have to relive this in four to six years again," Nagel
said. "As long as the [union] continues, this is going to occur."</TE>
<TE>   Nagel canceled a news conference Monday at the county elections
office to announce his candidacy because he had not completed the
paperwork. Monday marked the beginning of the three-week filing
period for county elections.</TE>

<HD>School Crossing Guards Endure Risks, Abuse</HD>
<DH>As traffic worsens, so does the danger for those who put
themselves in harm's way to protect children from speeding and
distracted drivers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HUGO MARTIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As a school crossing guard, Patrick Finan has endured harsh
obscenities, cold snubs and rude gestures from motorists.</LD>
<LD>   But the worst insult came four months ago, when the 82-year-old
retired construction worker was standing in the middle of Hazeltine
Avenue in Van Nuys, stopping traffic to help a woman and two children
cross the street.</LD>
<LD>   An elderly man in a speeding sedan ran Finan down from behind,
throwing him to the pavement. "The next thing I knew, I was on my
back," said Finan, who suffered a concussion and some painful
bruises, cuts and scrapes.</LD>
<TE>   After several weeks of recovery, he returned to don his bright
orange vest, still a bit sore but committed to the job.</TE>
<TE>   As Finan can attest, the job of crossing guard is dangerous work
that often goes unappreciated by motorists. Yet Finan and his
co-workers remain steadfast, putting themselves in harm's
way--literally--daily to protect schoolchildren from distracted and
speeding drivers.</TE>
<TE>   The risks are only expected to increase.</TE>
<TE>   As traffic worsens in Southern California, police say motorists
are more likely to speed and to ignore rules of the road to make up
for time lost in the congestion. That behavior is even common around
schools, where increased crowding only compounds the problem. A
recent national survey found that nearly two-thirds of all motorists
speed around school zones.</TE>
<TE>   Too often, crossing guards are the only line of defense between
schoolchildren and these speeding, frustrated motorists.</TE>
<TE>   In Los Angeles, two crossing guards have been killed in the last
two years, and several more throughout Southern California--like
Finan--have suffered serious injuries on duty.</TE>
<TE>   A tragic example of the dangers facing crossing guards was William
Hooper, 60, who died in November 2000. A 17-year-old driver who sped
through a crosswalk in North Hollywood hit the retired electrical
draftsman from behind.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier that year, crossing guard Margarita Garcia, 52, was
seriously injured when an unlicensed teenage driver rolled through a
crosswalk in Fullerton, hitting Garcia and knocking her onto the hood
of the car.</TE>
<TE>   And last year, co-workers and friends held a candlelight vigil
after longtime crossing guard Menelva Faye Tippie, 48, was struck and
killed by a stray bullet fired in an apparent gang confrontation near
116th Street Elementary School in South Los Angeles. Police have
since arrested a suspect who has been charged in Tippie's death.</TE>
<TE>   Southern California officials could not provide an exact tally of
the injuries and deaths suffered by local crossing guards, but the
U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics reported that 52 were injured on the
job in California in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   More often, crossing guards are narrowly missed by harried and
preoccupied motorists who roll through crosswalks before guards and
children can get to the curb.</TE>
<TE>   "I had one lady who almost hit me say she didn't see me," said
Dennis Phelps, a veteran crossing guard for the city of Los Angeles.
"I said, 'How can you miss me? I'm 6-foot-3 and I'm wearing a bright
orange outfit.' "</TE>
<TE>   The job has become so dangerous that the employees union that
represents crossing guards in Los Angeles included a requirement in
its latest contract that the city launch a television, radio and
newspaper campaign warning motorists to watch out for them. The
campaign should begin in about six months.</TE>
<TE>   Crossing guards are routinely subjected to insults and profanity
by drivers who blame the guards for lengthening to their already slow
commutes.</TE>
<TE>   "I've heard some pretty profane things," said Phelps, a retired
industrial photographer. "But what are you going to do, fight with
them?"</TE>
<TE>   Instead of giving him a wave or a salute, Finan said, motorists
often acknowledge him with a rude gesture. He said he has learned to
turn the other cheek.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the confrontations come from misunderstandings. Because of
liability concerns, crossing guards in Los Angeles are permitted to
help only schoolchildren in kindergarten through fifth grade. Also,
each guard is assigned to one street and prohibited from leaving that
post to help children cross nearby streets.</TE>
<TE>   Often parents get irate and abusive when they see crossing guards
who onlookers think are shirking because they don't help older
children or senior citizens.</TE>
<TE>   Such behavior toward crossing guards is not confined to Los
Angeles. "That's a constant problem with us," said Linda Flores, who
oversees Santa Ana's crossing guards. People are abusive and
confrontational, and the crossing guards cannot respond."</TE>
<TE>   Crossing guards are trained to ignore such abuse. "They kind of
learn to deal with it and say, 'Whatever,' " said Sgt. Don Taulli of
the Riverside Police Department.</TE>
<TE>   If motorists become too combative and pose a danger to students,
crossing guards often call police to cite or arrest the offending
drivers.</TE>
<TE>   Most recently, police in Santa Ana cracked down on motorists who
sped past crossing guards, issuing citations ranging from $77 to
$138.</TE>
<TE>   So why would anyone take a part-time job that exposes the worker
to serious--sometimes fatal--risks and almost daily insults?</TE>
<TE>   It's usually not for the money. Most crossing guards are retired
senior citizens who work only a few hours a week and earn about $10
an hour or less. Some are homemakers who need a job with short hours.</TE>
<TE>   Finan said he took the job because he got tired of sitting around
the house after he retired. After being hit, he returned to
it--despite his wife's concern for his safety--because he said he
felt obligated to protect the children in his neighborhood.</TE>
<TE>   Even after Hooper was killed two years ago, none of the San
Fernando Valley's 126 crossing guards quit or asked for shorter
hours, said Benjamin Scroggins, who supervises West Valley crossing
guards.</TE>
<TE>   Scroggins said Hooper's death is still a daily reminder of the
job's risks. Scroggins and Hooper were friends for 30 years.
Scroggins urged Hooper to become a crossing guard after Hooper
retired from the Burbank Department of Water and Power.</TE>
<TE>   A plaque memorializing Hooper is mounted at the North Hollywood
intersection where he died and at the city's crossing guard
headquarters in the Valley.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm very proud of these people because they do a great job,"
Scroggins said.</TE>

<HD>Cost of Ahmanson Ranch Study Triples</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CATHERINE SAILLANT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Mounting opposition to the 3,050-home Ahmanson Ranch subdivision near
Calabasas has tripled the cost of an environmental study that must be
approved before the project can break ground.</LD>
<LD>   Initial estimates put the study's cost at $100,000. But Ventura
County officials have received 6,000 pages of public comments, far
more than the 75 pages they anticipated.</LD>
<LD>   County officials say it will cost an additional $200,000 to
respond to concerns raised in those comments. Supervisors today will
decide whether to approve the increase to Rincon Consultants, the
Ventura company hired to do the environmental impact report.</LD>
<TE>   Developer Ahmanson Land Co. would be required to reimburse the
county for the additional expense and has agreed to do so, said
Thomas Berg, director of the county's Resource Management Agency.</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for Seattle-based Washington Mutual Bank, which owns
Ahmanson Land Co., declined comment.</TE>
<TE>   The flood of comments reflects intense controversy surrounding the
project. Approved by the Ventura County Board of Supervisors in 1992,
the project was stalled for years by a series of lawsuits.</TE>
<TE>   In 1999, Ahmanson biologists discovered rare frog and flower
species at the 2,800-acre site, prompting supervisors to order a
follow-up environmental study. That report, released in February,
concluded that the California red-legged frog and the San Fernando
Valley spineflower would be harmed by the development but that
protective measures could be taken to minimize the damage.</TE>
<TE>   In a series of public hearings, critics have challenged the study
as inadequate. Opponents say protections outlined for the endangered
species fall woefully short and contend that other environmental
factors, such as increased traffic, pollution and water runoff, need
more study.</TE>
<TE>   County staff, working with Rincon Consultants, must now respond to
the extensive comments, said Bruce Smith, chairman of the county's
Environmental Report Review Committee. The report will then return to
the committee for approval before working its way back to the Board
of Supervisors.</TE>
<TE>   Supporters say the project is sorely needed because housing is in
short supply in Ventura County. Its construction would pump $2
billion into the local economy.</TE>

<HD>Charter School Taking Shape in Inglewood</HD>
<DH>Education: Despite district resistance to the idea, final
arrangements are underway for the high school to open in August for
students in the class of 2006.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SANDRA MURILLO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It took a direct appeal to the state Board of Education, but classes
at Inglewood's first charter high school will soon be in session.</LD>
<LD>   Steve Barr, who founded the successful Animo Leadership Charter
High School in neighboring Lennox, is working hard to re-create that
success in Inglewood.</LD>
<LD>   In the next month, his staff will draft a curriculum and finish
interviewing prospective teachers. Last, but not least, a
construction crew will revamp the fifth floor of an old hospital on
Manchester Boulevard which, beginning Aug. 26, will house 143 members
of the Animo Inglewood class of 2006.</LD>
<TE>   It's a frenzy of preparation for a school that the Inglewood
School District would prefer did not exist.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, the district rejected Barr's proposal for the school,
saying it wanted time to implement its own reforms. Some school board
members voiced concern that Animo would skim off the best students
from the district's two under-performing high schools and that it
would not reflect the city's racial demographics.</TE>
<TE>   The proposal for Animo essentially said that a private group could
do a better job than public school officials and "that's something
they don't want to hear," Barr said. "It's like me knocking on
Staples' door and saying 'Hi, I'm from Office Smart. I want to put my
store next to yours, and I need your permission.' "</TE>
<TE>   But last December, the state board overruled the district and, on
the basis of the Lennox school's high test scores, granted Barr the
charter. Animo students scored about 35% higher on language arts and
math portions of the state's high school exit exam than their
counterparts in the Centinela Valley Union High School District,
where most of the Animo students would have been assigned.</TE>
<TE>   Of the approximately 432 charter schools that operate in
California, only Inglewood Animo and four others were granted
charters by the state. State officials, rather than the school
district, assume some oversight responsibilities, such as inspecting
facilities.</TE>
<TE>   Charter schools are public institutions funded with tax dollars
but freed from most state regulations and allowed to remain
independent of a school district. That autonomy, supporters say,
allows them to tailor programs to students' needs and to reduce
bureaucracy.</TE>
<TE>   The Animo, Spanish for "spirit" or "vigor," curriculum is designed
so that every student can fulfill the requirements for entrance to
the University of California. The students wear uniforms and are
assigned individual laptop computers to use in class and at home.
Parents must commit a certain number of service hours to the school.</TE>
<TE>   The Lennox school, which has a $2.2-million budget, was the first
of several charter schools that Barr plans to start in Los Angeles
County through his nonprofit Green Dot Public Schools. Animo
Inglewood has a budget of about $1.5 million. Both schools are
supported by state funding and numerous grants.</TE>
<TE>   In Lennox, where there are no high schools, Barr and his company
enjoyed support from school officials eager to provide eighth-graders
with an alternative to the low-scoring and crime-plagued Centinela
Valley district. When recruitment time came, the Animo staff was
given access to the schools and allowed to make its pitch directly to
the students.</TE>
<TE>   Applications poured in and soon a waiting list was necessary.
Animo Lennox has grown from 140 students to 420 since it opened in
August 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Every year, the Animo schools will add one more class, until they
include all high school grade levels, with 560 students.</TE>
<TE>   But Barr said he has received an icy welcome from the neighboring
Inglewood school district, and recruitment there has required a
little more creativity. Using some old contacts at the Inglewood
schools, Animo staff members were able to compile a list of the phone
numbers and addresses of most of the district's eighth-graders. The
staff mailed fliers, called parents and organized several open houses
at neighborhood churches.</TE>
<TE>   "It was very emotional," Barr said, describing the meetings with
Inglewood parents. "A mother of an eighth-grader, speaking in broken
English, said her son was halfway through the school year and still
had no math teacher. They couldn't believe what we were offering
their kids."</TE>
<TE>   The main concerns of parents are school safety and low academic
standards at the high schools, Barr said.</TE>
<TE>   For the last two years, Morningside and Inglewood high schools
have received the lowest possible ranking--one out of 10--on the
Academic Performance Index.</TE>
<TE>   Recently, the district has tried to implement some changes. It
started City Honors High School this year, in which some students
with high grade point averages took courses at a nearby community
college. Since 1999, the school has added several Advanced Placement
classes. Still, nearly 30% of Inglewood's students of high school age
go to private schools or other school districts.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm hopeful the community will focus on our focus to improve our
schools," said school board President Gloria Gray. "We've done great
with our elementary schools, but it takes a little longer to fix the
problems in the high schools."</TE>
<TE>   Earnestine Howard, a mother of two Inglewood ninth-graders, said
she can't afford to wait.</TE>
<TE>   "How are my kids supposed to get an education if they don't feel
safe?" Howard asked. She attended the Animo meetings and left
enthusiastic but skeptical.</TE>
<TE>   "I heard transportation, laptops, quality education,
board-certified teachers and I just kept waiting for the catch, but
there wasn't one," Howard said. "What more can I ask for?"</TE>
<TE>   Her daughter, Allison, 14, is looking forward to attending Animo.
Several months ago she overheard a conversation between some gang
members on her way home from school. The comments weren't directed at
her, but the gang members were saying that anyone who lived in a
particular neighborhood would belong to their gang.</TE>
<TE>   "It didn't scare me or anything, but if I went to Morningside,
it's the type of thing that would be all in my face all the time,"
Allison said.</TE>
<TE>   For Nicholas Hardy, 14, who has his heart set on Morehouse College
in Atlanta, the Animo school seems to be a way to guarantee academic
success while avoiding negative influences.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the outside problems that might interfere with school,"
Nicholas said. "I just don't want that distraction."</TE>
<TE>   Although the Inglewood school will be modeled on the Lennox
school, administrators are working to modify the curriculum so that
it meets the needs of Inglewood's more racially and economically
diverse student population.</TE>
<TE>   The Inglewood charter school is evenly split between African
American and Latino students; at Lennox, virtually all the students
are Latino. So the ninth-grade history elective at Inglewood will not
focus on Latin America, as it does in Lennox. Instead, students will
learn about their history by studying California's politics, teachers
said.</TE>
<TE>   And in Inglewood, the blue and khaki uniforms that Lennox students
wear are probably not a good idea, police have told Barr. "We're
located right in the middle of Bloods territory," said Barr of the
street gang. Their arch rivals, the Crips, wear blue. "We'll probably
go with neutral colors."</TE>
<TE>   School district officials said they view the Animo school as
merely another choice for parents in Inglewood.</TE>
<TE>   "I do not fear charter schools, but I just cannot abandon our
public schools," said one board member, Eveline Ross.</TE>
<TE>   "No way do I plan on sitting still. We'll put together an
instructional program that can rival any charter school."</TE>

<HD>Law Firm Fights for Disabled People</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN M. GLIONNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>OAKLAND</DL>
<LD>For former big-business lawyers Larry Paradis and Sid Wolinsky, the
move was a risky about-face: trading the security of corporate work
for the dice-roll of championing often-underdog disabled clients.</LD>
<LD>   Their goal was to get corporate institutions to see that people
with disabilities would no longer accept being treated as
second-class. They spread the word that, if companies refused to obey
the law and accommodate the blind, the deaf, the physically and
developmentally disabled, well, then they'd see them in court.</LD>
<LD>   Formed in 1993, their Disability Rights Advocates has emerged as
one of the nation's most effective plaintiff practices, bringing
hundreds of class-action lawsuits against the likes of United Parcel
Service, Hertz, Boston University, the California Bar and Bank of
America.</LD>
<TE>   Last year, they prompted medical giant Kaiser Permanente to change
the way it treated disabled patients. And on Monday, Disability
Rights Advocates celebrated another hard-won result.</TE>
<TE>   As part of the settlement of a lawsuit against the Educational
Testing Service, America's leading producer of college entrance
exams, a court-approved independent panel of experts announced
sweeping changes in the handling of test results for the disabled.</TE>
<TE>   Among them is eliminating the practice of "flagging," which refers
to the practice of placing asterisks on the scores of disabled
test-takers who have been given accommodations, such as extra exam
time.</TE>
<TE>   Paradis and Wolinsky are a contrast in styles. At 65, Wolinsky is
bearded and rail-thin. Paradis, 43, is quieter, more buttoned-down.</TE>
<TE>   For both, the testing lawsuit is part of the battle to uphold the
1990 Americans with Disabilities Act, the landmark legislation
designed to help 43 million disabled Americans gain greater access to
society.</TE>
<TE>   Low-Key Strategy</TE>
<TE>   The 10-lawyer firm tries to employ a consistent, low-key strategy.</TE>
<TE>   Instead of going for multimillion-dollar, headline-grabbing
judgments, it works behind the scenes for lasting change--helping to
appoint blue-ribbon panels that suggest improvements in the lives of
the disabled. Of 250 cases, only three have gone to trial.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to change the way Americans think about the disabled,"
said Paradis, a Harvard Law School graduate who uses a wheelchair
because of a genetic bone disorder. "For most people, they remain
something to be ashamed about."</TE>
<TE>   Twelve years after the disability act, many disabled people still
struggle. Three of four who want to work can't find jobs. One-third
live in poverty. The disabled are three times as likely to go without
needed health care as hospitals fail to provide them with basic
access, and insurance companies routinely exclude or limit their
coverage.</TE>
<TE>   Activists applaud the tactics of Disabled Rights Advocates.</TE>
<TE>   "Big business has had enough time to understand how to comply with
federal law regarding the disabled," said Marilyn Holle, an attorney
for Protection and Advocacy, a federally funded nonprofit
organization that works with the disabled. "And if they don't,
lawyers like Larry Paradis and Sid Wolinsky will certainly remind
them."</TE>
<TE>   Critics say there's more than altruism at stake with Paradis and
Wolinsky, whom they accuse of "over-lawyering" cases--filing
"surprise attack" lawsuits to reap sizable attorneys fees.</TE>
<TE>   "Their rates are excessive for their overhead," said Lawrence
Ashe, an Atlanta attorney who lost a lawsuit Wolinsky filed against
the California State Bar. "A small firm located over a discount shoe
store in downtown Oakland charges the same rates as San Francisco's
highest-priced firms?"</TE>
<TE>   Proceeds for a Cause</TE>
<TE>   Disability Rights Advocates supporters argue that the firm uses
such proceeds to keep its cause going. And if Paradis and Wolinsky
wanted to get rich, they would have stayed in corporate law, they
say.</TE>
<TE>   "People in social causes don't have to walk around barefoot with
tattered clothes, driving 1968 Volkswagens," said J. Thomas Viall,
executive director of the International Dyslexia Assn.</TE>
<TE>   The firm's lead lawyers live in upscale neighborhoods in San
Francisco's East Bay--Wolinsky in Berkeley and Paradis in nearby
Kensington. While Wolinsky charges $450 an hour and sometimes more,
neither lawyer would comment on their annual salaries.</TE>
<TE>   Clement Glynn, who represented the Bay Area Rapid Transit in a
Disability Rights Advocates suit, called Wolinsky one of the nation's
elite trial lawyers.</TE>
<TE>   "These guys aren't bounty hunters," he said. "Larry Paradis uses a
wheelchair. He knows what cases matter, and he goes after causes with
a social impact, not just those on which he knows he can collect."</TE>
<TE>   Others chafe what they regard as an intent to win at any cost.</TE>
<TE>   Attorney Greg Hurley helped defend a Disability Rights Advocates
suit that will force the city of Sacramento to maintain its sidewalks
so they can be used by people in wheelchairs. He said the decision
will cost California cities more than $1 billion for upgrades.</TE>
<TE>   "So we have thousands of miles of refurbished sidewalks that no
wheelchair will ever traverse. Where is the money coming from? School
budgets?" he said. "Not all so-called victories on behalf of the
disabled are in the public good."</TE>
<TE>   Wolinsky, a former Beverly Hills trial lawyer, started Disability
Rights Advocates in 1993, using space borrowed from a corporate firm
in Oakland.</TE>
<TE>   He knows how major law firms often send out small armies of
lawyers to intimidate smaller opponents.</TE>
<TE>   But Disability Rights Advocates has established itself as a
pragmatic legal-giant killer.</TE>
<TE>   Taking on Giants</TE>
<TE>   The firm sued Macy's stores claiming its aisles weren't wide
enough for wheelchairs. It sued United Parcel Service over its
failure to promote deaf employees or those with other disabilities.
It sued Hertz and other rental car companies because the auto hand
controls used by paraplegics were often available only in
higher-priced vehicles.</TE>
<TE>   In another case, it sued Boston University for refusing to
accommodate disabled students. Disability Rights Advocates lawyers
were inspired by a comment to the local press made by the school's
president, Jon Silber, who said that the learning-disabled "are what
we used to call stupid." And in 1999, the firm stepped into the
controversial Holocaust-related litigation against Swiss banks.</TE>
<TE>   Calling the disabled the "invisible" first victims of the Nazis,
Paradis said many Germans had been murdered or sterilized because of
conditions such as schizophrenia. "The first ovens were developed in
institutions for the disabled," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Expanding in Europe</TE>
<TE>   Through its new office in Budapest, Hungary, Disability Rights
Advocates is seeking a share for the disabled in the $1.25-billion
settlement, as well as a foundation to advance disability rights in
central and eastern Europe.</TE>
<TE>   Paradis has worked to change even the courtrooms where he
practices after finding that many were inaccessible to wheelchairs.
The charitable fund that Disability Rights Advocates helped establish
gives hundreds of thousands of dollars to disability nonprofit groups
statewide.</TE>
<TE>   In some cases, the firm finds unusual ways to aid the disabled.</TE>
<TE>   One recent settlement had Macy's give $2.8 million in gift cards
to disabled plaintiffs. After the firm sued the Squaw Valley ski
resort for not allowing the disabled to board lifts to reach its
mountaintop facilities, the settlement included $50,000 in lift
tickets.</TE>
<TE>   "The opposing lawyer wanted to know which of our disabled clients
could ski, and we pointed out that an instructional school for
disabled skiers was located only 10 miles away," Wolinsky recalled.
"That's how we want to open people's eyes when it comes to the
disabled and the things they can do."</TE>

<HD>Simon Won't Disclose Tax Shelter Savings</HD>
<DH>Politics: Shelter is under IRS scrutiny. Candidate is
expected to reshuffle staff again after White House prodding.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL FINNEGAN and MARK Z. BARABAK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>SANTA BARBARA</DL>
<LD>Republican gubernatorial nominee Bill Simon Jr. on Monday declined to
say how much he saved in state and federal income taxes by using a
tax shelter under legal challenge by the Internal Revenue Service.</LD>
<LD>   Simon, a wealthy Pacific Palisades businessman, described the tax
shelter as an "investment transaction" proposed by his accountants at
KPMG, but would not say how it worked.</LD>
<LD>   "We rely on our advisors in terms of the type of investment
transactions that they put forward, and that's the bottom line,"
Simon said at an oceanfront campaign stop.</LD>
<TE>   The questions about Simon's tax history came as his campaign again
faced pressure from the White House to retool its staff to more
assertively tackle incumbent Democrat Gray Davis. As a result, Simon
was expected to name a new day-to-day campaign manager--his fourth in
as many months--possibly as early as today.</TE>
<TE>   Rob Lapsley, the chief strategist for Secretary of State Bill
Jones' unsuccessful primary bid against Simon, was expected to take
over daily operations from John Peschong, who was installed at the
behest of the White House a month ago. Peschong, a veteran state
Republican Party operative, would remain a part-time advisor to the
Simon campaign, but also would be freed up to consult on other
campaigns, according to sources familiar with the plan.</TE>
<TE>   Since winning the primary in an upset in March, Simon has
struggled to raise money and stumbled through a series of missteps.
Privately, White House political operatives have expressed concerns
about Simon's prospects, echoing doubts among some of the party's
biggest donors. A contingent from the Republican National Committee,
which functions as the political arm of the White House, met in
Sacramento last week with officials from the Simon campaign. GOP
insiders said the national party agreed to raise $15 million for
Simon's campaign, but only if he downgraded the role of some members
of his primary campaign team. Members of that group--known inside the
campaign as "the 4 percenters" because they started when Simon was a
mere blip in the polls--have been feuding behind the scenes with a
more aggressive group led by Lapsley and others who joined Simon
afterward.</TE>
<TE>   "They clearly view it as a very winnable race, but feel the
campaign needs to be streamlined and more aggressive in attacking
Davis and reaching out beyond the core Republican base," said one
Republican operative familiar with last week's discussion. Simon did
not mention the pending changes earlier in the day, when he once
again rejected Davis' demand that he release his income tax returns.
Candidates are not required by law to release their returns, but
Davis and his two Republican predecessors, Pete Wilson and George
Deukmejian, did so voluntarily.</TE>
<TE>   "We have provided more than the necessary information for
Californians to know all about Bill Simon's financial interests," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Simon has filed a report that lists his assets and income sources,
but it does not reveal how much he paid in taxes, and it lists the
amount of his earnings only in broad ranges.</TE>
<TE>   For months, Davis has questioned whether Simon has paid his "fair
share" of taxes and, as well, whether Simon has paid California taxes
every year since he moved to the state in 1990.</TE>
<TE>   At his campaign stop Monday morning, Simon declined several times
to say whether he had paid California income taxes every year since
1990. But he called The Times an hour later, and stated: "I have paid
California income taxes every single year since I've been here."</TE>
<TE>   The subject of Simon's tax returns moved to the top of the
campaign agenda last week when the IRS filed court papers that name
him and others as beneficiaries of a tax shelter that the government
says could be illegal.</TE>
<TE>   Simon was not accused of wrongdoing. He describes the matter as a
dispute between the IRS and KPMG. The IRS has demanded documents from
KPMG and another accounting firm, BDO Seidman, for an investigation
of what federal officials call abusive tax shelters.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, Simon tried to deflect questions about his tax shelter
by shifting the focus to Davis: "I think that this purely and simply
is a distraction that's designed by Gov. Davis to try to distract
attention from his failed track record."</TE>
<TE>   Davis campaign spokesman Roger Salazar ridiculed the idea that the
governor played any role in getting "the Bush administration's IRS"
to name Simon publicly in the tax shelter case. On Monday, the tax
issue diverted attention from the focus of Simon's campaign event at
the Four Seasons Biltmore Hotel in Santa Barbara. With the ocean as
his backdrop, Simon warned that offshore oil platforms were
vulnerable to terrorist attack, but offered no specific proposal to
protect oil rigs.</TE>

<HD>Holocaust Aid Statute Is Upheld</HD>
<DH>Courts: Reversing a trial judge's ruling, 9th Circuit says
state law aiding victims in seeking redress from insurers is
constitutional.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HENRY WEINSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A federal appeals court ruled Monday that a California law designed
to aid Holocaust victims seeking compensation from insurance
companies is constitutional, paving the way for potentially thousands
of claims.</LD>
<LD>   The decision by the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals marked the
first time a higher federal court has upheld such a state statute,
according to Century City attorney Frank Kaplan, who is special
counsel to the California Insurance Commission on Holocaust issues.</LD>
<LD>   "This decision is a huge development for Holocaust survivors in
California and all over the country," said David Lash, executive
director of Bet Tzedek Legal Services in Los Angeles. "The ruling
allows survivors to get at the truth," he said.</LD>
<TE>   Injunction Issued</TE>
<TE>   The appellate court reversed a trial judge's ruling that the
Holocaust Victim Insurance Relief Act of 1999 violated due process
rights of insurers. The judge had issued an injunction two years ago
barring the state Insurance Commission from enforcing the statute.</TE>
<TE>   The law, written by former Assemblyman Wally Knox (D-Los Angeles),
requires any insurer doing business in California to disclose
information about any policies sold in Europe from 1920 to 1945.</TE>
<TE>   European insurers, many with California affiliates, have been
accused in recent years of failing to honor valid policies issued
during the Holocaust. Most lack records to substantiate their claims
because the paperwork was confiscated or lost when the Nazis uprooted
millions of people and forced them into concentration camps during
World War II.</TE>
<TE>   Knox pushed for disclosure of information that could be critical
in determining the validity of claims.</TE>
<TE>   If the insurer fails to provide information, the state can revoke
the insurer's license.</TE>
<TE>   The law also extended the statute of limitations for filing claims
on such policies until the end of 2010.</TE>
<TE>   Several insurers challenged the statute, contending that the law
interfered with the federal government's control of foreign affairs,
violated due process of law, the Constitution's equal protection
clause and European data privacy statutes.</TE>
<TE>   Among the companies contesting the law are Gerling Global
Reinsurance Corp. and several of its affiliates--Assicurazioni
Generali, Winterthur International America Insurance Co., America
Underwriters Insurance Co. and several others--as well as the
American Insurance Assn.</TE>
<TE>   The companies recruited William H. Webster, a former federal
appeals court judge and former head of the Central Intelligence
Agency, as well as Kenneth S. Geller, one of the nation's top
appellate lawyers, to present their case. The U.S. Justice
Department, which has expressed concern that new state laws seeking
to help Holocaust victims could worsen U.S. relations with other
countries, weighed in on behalf of the insurers.</TE>
<TE>   But in its 3-0 ruling, a 9th Circuit panel rejected all the
companies' major contentions.</TE>
<TE>   The court held that California can require the companies to make
disclosures about the policies at issue "even though the required
information may be in the hands of a related entity that is in a
foreign country," such as the California company's parent firm or
subsidiary.</TE>
<TE>   In her opinion, Judge Susan P. Graber said that state statutes and
regulations "routinely require multinational insurance companies,
banks and the like to disclose foreign activities and transactions
engaged in by them and their parent and affiliate companies."</TE>
<TE>   Graber's opinion, which was joined by Judges Alfred T. Goodwin and
Richard A. Paez, also noted that the law did not seek to regulate the
foreign affiliates of the California licensed companies. Nor does the
statute seek to compel compensation--only to require information,
Graber wrote.</TE>
<TE>   "Both the demands and the sanctions of the statute fall solely on
California insurers," Graber wrote.</TE>
<TE>   The 9th Circuit panel also emphasized that the California law is
different in significant respects from a Florida law on the same
issue that was struck down last year by a federal appeals court in
Atlanta.</TE>
<TE>   Kaplan, special counsel to California Insurance Commissioner Harry
Low, said that he was "very pleased with the ruling."</TE>
<TE>   "We hope and expect that the insurance companies will now comply
with the statute and promptly provide the information that survivors
have been seeking for 55 years," Kaplan said.</TE>
<TE>   Assessing Claims</TE>
<TE>   Once insurers provide the information, 20,000 Holocaust survivors
in the state and thousands of heirs will be able to assess whether
they have a legitimate claim, Kaplan said.</TE>
<TE>   Nicole Mahrt, a representative for the American Insurance Assn.,
said: "We're reviewing the ruling and considering our options."</TE>
<TE>   The companies also contended that the California law was preempted
when the U.S. and German governments opened negotiations to resolve
the claims of Holocaust victims.</TE>
<TE>   The negotiations led to a $5-billion fund that would compensate
victims of slave and forced labor and other claims, including
insurance.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, the companies noted that an International Commission
on Holocaust Era Insurance Claims, headed by former U.S. Secretary of
State Lawrence Eagleburger, had been created to settle these cases.</TE>
<TE>   But Holocaust victims and their advocates say the commission has
been ineffective in resolving claims and has spent millions more on
administrative costs than it has generated in claims payments to
victims.</TE>

<HD>Man's Train Death a Suicide, Officials Say</HD>
<DH>Inquiry: It is unclear when the Mission Viejo resident was
struck.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Mission Viejo man struck by a train on a remote stretch of track in
San Juan Capistrano took his own life, the Orange County coroner's
office said Monday.</LD>
<LD>   The body of Michael Warde Remley, 37, was spotted near the tracks
about half a mile north of Junipero Serra Road at 12:55 p.m. Sunday
by the conductor of a northbound Amtrak train.</LD>
<LD>   The body was found in an area near a horse stable and orange
groves.</LD>
<TE>   Remley, wearing blue shorts and a white T-shirt, was originally
thought to have been struck accidentally while jogging. But Cullen
Ellenburgh of the Orange County coroner's office said an
investigation determined that the death was a suicide.</TE>
<TE>   It is still unclear what time Remley was struck or which train hit
him.</TE>
<TE>   The Orange County Sheriff's Department found no evidence to
suggest that the northbound Amtrak was involved.</TE>
<TE>   The Sheriff's Department stopped Amtrak and Santa Fe freight
trains in the area Sunday afternoon for about four hours to
investigate.</TE>

<LD>   The project, including new on-ramps and off-ramps and a bridge

according to the lawsuit.</LD>
<LD>   The $12-million project is intended to ease traffic congestion

<LD>A 6-year-old girl was kidnapped Monday in Stanton by a man who asked
her to help him find his dog, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   The girl was abducted about 6:45 p.m. when the man approached her
in the 8100 block of Laguna Court, said Jim Amormino of the Orange
County Sheriff's Department.</LD>
<LD>   The suspect was seen driving away with the girl in a green Honda,
Amormino said.</LD>
<TE>   "She was last seen screaming and kicking as he forced her into the
vehicle," the Sheriff's Department said in a statement issued Monday
night.</TE>
<TE>   The girl, who has long, curly, brown hair, was wearing a white
blouse and red checkered pants. She was playing with a 5-year-old
girl when she was abducted, Amormino said.</TE>

<LD>A 72-year-old Mission Viejo man apparently drowned Monday after
bumping his head on the bottom of relative's pool while swimming with
his 6-year-old granddaughter, officials said. The man was identified
as William Morgan.</LD>
<LD>   The incident occurred about 3:30 p.m. at a home in the 25300 block
of Bentley Lane in Laguna Hills.</LD>
<LD>   "Apparently he dove into the pool and hit his head," said Lt. Greg
Russell of the Orange County Sheriff's Department.</LD>
<TE>   "The little girl did a great thing--ran to the phone and called
911," he said.</TE>
<TE>   A deputy dove into the pool to rescue Morgan, Russell said.
Despite receiving CPR in the ambulance, he said, Morgan was
pronounced dead at Saddleback Memorial Medical Center.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't know if [the death resulted] from the diving accident or
was medically related," said Capt. Stephen Miller of the Orange
County Fire Authority.</TE>
<TE>   An autopsy would be needed to determine the exact cause of death,
he said.</TE>

<HD>Send Those Valley Secession Donations to ... West L.A.?
That's Right</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Harvey</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A shocked Encino resident alerted me that the Web site for the San
Fernando Valley Independence Committee says that donations can be
sent to an office on Santa Monica Boulevard. Yes, in dreaded West
L.A.</LD>
<LD>   "Considering the size of the Valley," the resident wrote, "it's
pretty sad that the group couldn't find an address somewhere,
anywhere, in the Valley." I was surprised about the West L.A. address
for another reason. I thought the borders had been sealed.</LD>
<LD>   Attention amateur dentists! Prowling the sidewalks of Manhattan,
this column's national correspondent, Phil Proctor, came upon a
display of do-it-yourself products (see photo).</LD>
<TE>   Too gory for me: Elizabeth and Don Kiel of San Diego spotted a
bestseller about some couples whose internal organs flip-flop (see
accompanying). Too many cocktails, perhaps.</TE>
<TE>   They didn't stop to smell the roses: I mentioned that the FBI had
given its field office in L.A. an uncorroborated report that
terrorists might be targeting oil refineries in Pasadena. Turned out
the threat involved Pasadena, Texas. Anyway, Mary Maher writes that
the FBI folks would have been a lot quicker to identify the Pasadena
in Texas "if they were familiar with its old booster slogan: 'The
grass is greener in Pasadena,' which was inevitably expanded to, 'And
so is the air,' due to its large number of oil refineries and paper
mills."</TE>
<TE>   Speaking of bad directions: Bert Corson noticed that a Web site
listing the driving times to a San Diego County casino assumes
motorists in L.A. and Riverside are race-car drivers while those in
Escondido are in golf carts (see accompanying).</TE>
<TE>   Questionable plugs: A discussion here about negative product
placement in the movies moved Rick Mitchell to contribute a couple of
refreshing moments:</TE>
<TE>   * In "Dr. Strangelove" (1964), Keenan Wynn machine-guns a Coke
machine to get the change that British liaison officer Peter Sellers
needs to put through what he hopes will be a world-saving phone call
to American President Peter Sellers." (Sellers had several roles in
the movie.)</TE>
<TE>   * In "Head," (1968), Mickey Dolenz, lost in the desert, "comes
across a Coke machine which refuses to dispense until he blows it up
with a tank borrowed from some Italian soldiers lost since World War
II."</TE>
<TE>   Come out with your paws up: The Laguna News-Post's police log
reported that "a resident heard sounds and saw shadows in his living
room. He told police he thought that some wild animal was in his
house. A small opossum was found and escorted to the front door." How
does one escort a possum? Not by the tail, I bet.</TE>
<TE>   MiscelLAny: Singer Weird Al Yankovic, one of the stars appearing
at the Orange County Fair, counts among his successes "My Bologna"
(1979, a parody of the Knack's "My Sharona.") Yankovic recorded "My
Bologna" across the hall from the radio station at his alma mater,
Cal Poly San Luis Obispo--in a bathroom stall.</TE>

<HD>Ban on Gathering Racial Data on 2004 Ballot</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIGUEL BUSTILLO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An initiative to bar California's state and local governments from
collecting most types of race-based data officially qualified for the
ballot Monday, but it came too late to go before voters in November
and will appear instead on the March 2004 ballot.</LD>
<LD>   Known as the Racial Privacy Initiative, the effort to outlaw
government collection of all but a few types of race-based
information has become a divisive political issue. It is being led by
University of California Regent Ward Connerly, who spearheaded the
state's passage of Proposition 209, the 1996 measure that outlawed
affirmative action in state hiring and school admissions.</LD>
<LD>   Connerly and other supporters say stopping the government from
collecting race data about its citizens is an important step in
establishing a colorblind society.</LD>
<TE>   But opponents, which include the American Civil Liberties Union
and some public health advocates, say the Connerly measure represents
a dangerous effort to whitewash reality by preventing government from
collecting information that sometimes highlights injustice and helps
combat disease.</TE>
<TE>   The measure would still allow collection of some racial data for
medical and law enforcement purposes, such as the descriptions of
suspected criminals, so supporters consider those claims unfounded.</TE>
<TE>   Proponents first submitted signatures in April. But the results of
the full count came too late for the issue to appear before voters
this fall, which would have made it a factor in the gubernatorial
election. Because it missed the June 27 deadline, it will appear on
the next scheduled statewide election, the March 2004 presidential
primary.</TE>

<HD>Probe of July 4 Arrest Is Promised</HD>
<DH>City Hall: Activist did nothing to prompt action by Costa
Mesa police, friend claims.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID HALDANE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The mayor and police chief of Costa Mesa promised Monday to
investigate allegations that police acted wrongfully in arresting a
protester whom hecklers said splattered them with paint during a
Fourth of July demonstration.</LD>
<LD>   "It will be thoroughly investigated and, if we did something
wrong, it will be corrected," Chief Dave Snowden said after a City
Council meeting at which more than 20 people voiced complaints.</LD>
<LD>   The demonstration occurred in front of Nike Town, a store in
Triangle Square at 19th Street and Harbor Boulevard. The company's
alleged use of sweatshop and child labor in foreign countries was
being protested. The company has previously denied overseas worker
abuses.</LD>
<TE>   Demonstrators say they were physically and verbally assaulted by
at least three hecklers.</TE>
<TE>   During the altercation, they said, someone threw red paint on the
hecklers, resulting in the arrest of Naui Huitzilopochtli, 24, a
Costa Mesa activist.</TE>
<TE>   "Naui was falsely arrested," Tom Lash, a Huntington Beach resident
who was at the demonstration, told the City Council. "It happened
while we were celebrating our independence from tyranny," he said,
"but sometimes it seems like we haven't come that far."</TE>
<TE>   According to Snowden, the action was a citizen's arrest. Police,
he said, are legally obligated to arrest someone accused by a
citizen--in this case a victim of the paint-splattering--of
committing a crime.</TE>
<TE>   Huitzilopochtli said he spent about an hour in jail. The district
attorney's office declined to file charges against him, and police
halted the demonstration after the altercation.</TE>
<TE>   "We realized that the situation had escalated," said Capt. Jim
Watson, who has dealt with some of the estimated 20 formal complaints
that stemmed from the incident.</TE>
<TE>   Watson said he hoped to complete the investigation within 30 days.</TE>
<TE>   "The council will receive a report," Mayor Linda Dixon told the
crowd at the meeting.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A Santa Barbara man who was in Oxnard for a meeting with his parole
officer Monday was arrested on suspicion of bank robbery.</LD>
<LD>   Curtis Ransom, 46, allegedly walked into a Washington Mutual
branch on the 100 block of West 1st Street about 1:30 p.m. and handed
a teller a note demanding money, said Cmdr. Tom Chronister of the
Oxnard Police Department.</LD>
<LD>   The robber fled on foot with the cash but was quickly caught by
officers who had been patrolling the area, Chronister said.</LD>
<TE>   The robber was unarmed. Ransom was booked into Ventura County Jail
and will be held without bail, Chronister said.</TE>
<TE>   Ransom is one of about 350 parolees from Santa Barbara who have
been meeting with agents in Oxnard since the closure of the Santa
Barbara office in February, said Christine Moorey, deputy regional
administrator in the parole division of the state Department of
Corrections. That office was closed for fiscal reasons after many
parolees were reassigned to the new Santa Maria office, Moorey said.</TE>

<HD>Trail Leads East for Roy Rogers Museum</HD>
<DH>Memorabilia: Victorville attraction will move to a country
music mecca in Missouri because of sagging attendance.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICIA WARD BIEDERMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's happy trails for the Roy Rogers-Dale Evans Museum, which will
leave Victorville next year and relocate to Branson, Mo., curator Roy
"Dusty" Rogers Jr. announced Monday.</LD>
<LD>   The move was prompted, Rogers said, by the drop in attendance
since the deaths of his father and stepmother, legendary stars of
movie and television westerns in the mid-20th century.</LD>
<LD>   Attendance at the museum on the edge of the Mojave Desert has
fallen below 50,000 visitors a year, said Rogers. At its peak in the
1990s, when his dad still gave personal tours, the museum drew 75,000
visitors annually, he said.</LD>
<TE>   Known as "King of the Cowboys," Roy Rogers died in 1998 at age 86,
and Evans, "Queen of the West," died last year at age 88.</TE>
<TE>   A memorabilia-packed museum was a lifelong dream of his father,
who had visited cowboy philosopher Will Rogers' Oklahoma home and had
been disappointed by the paucity of artifacts, Dusty Rogers said.</TE>
<TE>   The Victorville museum features thousands of items associated with
the couple, including their fancy costumes, family photos and Roy's
cars, guns and watches. The biggest draw is the mounted remains of
Roy's palomino, Trigger, rearing up on its hind legs. Dale's horse
Buttercup, and their "wonder dog," Scout, are also on display. All
will be moved to Branson.</TE>
<TE>   In a news release issued Monday, Rogers said he and other family
members "owe it to our parents to continue their legacy. I'm not
going to ride a pony down until there are no legs on it."</TE>
<TE>   The fort-like museum has been the major attraction in Victorville
since it moved there from nearby Apple Valley in 1976 to take
advantage of traffic on Interstate 15.</TE>
<TE>   Rogers said Las Vegas, Palm Springs, Orlando, Fla., Nashville and
other tourist destinations had expressed interest in the museum.
Branson, a country music mecca, was his first choice because of its
8.2-million annual visitors and its appeal to "folksy people" like
his family, Rogers said.</TE>
<TE>   "We took my mother there about four years ago, and she just loved
the area," he said of Dale Evans, who wrote the couple's theme song,
"Happy Trails."</TE>
<TE>   "Branson just feels like a good, ol' pair of boots. It feels like
comin' home."</TE>
<TE>   Rogers said the Victorville museum would stay open until a month
before it moves in the spring.</TE>
<TE>   The Victorville property, which includes the building and
9.94-acre site, is for sale for $3.4 million.</TE>
<TE>   "The continuation of Roy and Dale's legacy in Branson makes very
good sense," said Mike Rankin, economic development director for the
southern Missouri city, adding that he expected attendance to exceed
150,000 a year.</TE>
<TE>   The only promise the community has made to Rogers is a good fit
between the institution and Branson's clientele, many of them old
enough to have been fans of Roy and Dale in their heyday, Rankin
said.</TE>
<TE>   The $3-million museum will include a theater where Dusty Rogers
and his band, the High Riders, will perform and an "old-town, western
theme to the front," Huffman said.</TE>
<TE>   Local western buffs were saddened by news of the move.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a tremendous loss for Southern California, because Roy was
so much a part of the area, not just as a motion picture star but as
a resident," said writer and western historian Richard Carleton
Hacker of Sherman Oaks, who knew Roy Rogers for about 20 years.</TE>

<HD>Homicide Case Back in Court</HD>
<DH>Ruling: Appellate panel rejects dismissal of charges in
1993 slaying of a Port Hueneme woman.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENIFER RAGLAND</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A state appellate court Monday overturned a judge's dismissal of an
9-year-old homicide case, potentially reinstating charges against
former Ventura resident Michael Schultz.</LD>
<LD>   The ruling by the 2nd District Court of Appeal is significant
because the dismissal could have prevented Ventura County prosecutors
from pursuing the case. The court decision takes effect in 30 days,
if no rehearing is requested.</LD>
<LD>   Schultz, 33, is accused of raping and strangling Cynthia Burger,
44, during a burglary in her Port Hueneme home in August 1993.
Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty.</LD>
<TE>   "These dismissals are important to us because the law says if
there's two dismissals, we're done," said Senior Deputy Dist. Atty.
Michael Schwartz. "It's a very serious case, and it should go to
trial. It should not be dismissed on some technicality."</TE>
<TE>   In February, Ventura County Superior Court Judge Art Gutierrez
threw out a new set of charges against Schultz, saying prosecutors
made a procedural error.</TE>
<TE>   That decision came weeks after a Santa Barbara judge set aside an
October 2000 murder indictment against Schultz. In that ruling,
Superior Court Judge Frank J. Ochoa said the county grand jury had
included too few women and didn't reflect a fair cross-section of the
community as required by law.</TE>
<TE>   Schultz's attorney, Chief Assistant Public Defender Michael
McMahon, said he was disappointed by the appellate court ruling. He
plans to petition the California Supreme Court to hear the case.</TE>
<TE>   Schultz has been in Ventura County Jail for two years without
bail, McMahon said, and has yet to have a preliminary hearing.</TE>

<HD>Councilmen Map Attacks on Secession</HD>
<DH>Election: Alex Padilla, Eric Garcetti and Tom LaBonge say
decision to form their own committees isn't a sign of dissatisfaction
with Mayor Hahn.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PATRICK McGREEVY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>With Mayor James K. Hahn's anti-secession media campaign yet to get
into gear, three Los Angeles City Council members said Monday that
they are forming their own election committees to fight the breakup
movement in their San Fernando Valley and Hollywood districts.</LD>
<LD>   Council President Alex Padilla said his committee--One Family, One
L.A.--will target the heavily Latino northeast Valley, considered a
key area in the Nov. 5 secession election. It will focus on
grass-roots campaigning, he said.</LD>
<LD>   Councilmen Eric Garcetti and Tom LaBonge said they plan to raise
$1 million to mobilize voters against the Hollywood secession
measure.</LD>
<TE>   The three council members said their decision to launch the
committees does not reflect any dissatisfaction with Hahn's campaign.
The mayor has said he intends to raise $5 million for a citywide
media blitz against secession.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been working very closely with the mayor, and he is aware of
this campaign," Padilla said.</TE>
<TE>   Garcetti said Hahn has laid the right groundwork for the broader
media campaign, but more must be done to address the "block-to-block
issues" in Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   "This is in response to people who feel their particular area is
being lost in the larger message," he said.</TE>
<TE>   However, sources said there is unhappiness on the council with the
negative tone of Hahn's campaign, which is expected to begin buying
television and radio spots next month.</TE>
<TE>   Hahn has attacked secession as a "hare-brained" idea and a
potential "disaster of biblical proportions." He has said that if the
Valley and Hollywood break away, they and the remainder of Los
Angeles will go broke.</TE>
<TE>   Kam Kuwata, a political aide to the mayor, said Hahn's remarks
about "the very grave risks" of secession have been on target. He
also said the mayor is pleased about the council members' committees.</TE>
<TE>   "We encouraged them," Kuwata said. "We will share information with
them and try not to bump into each other."</TE>
<TE>   Secession leaders said they look forward to battling the council
members neighborhood to neighborhood. They said the committees are
likely to function as self-serving vehicles to bolster the lawmakers'
reelection prospects.</TE>
<TE>   "It probably gives each of the council members some chance for
personal campaigning, for themselves as well as campaigning against
secession," said Richard Katz, chairman of the San Fernando Valley
Independence Committee.</TE>
<TE>   Later Monday, Valley secession leaders found themselves on the
defensive at their regular monthly board meeting. David Fleming, a
key financial backer of the movement, explained why he had met with a
group of secession opponents, including billionaire Eli Broad, to
discuss postponing a vote on secession in exchange for a commitment
by the city for a borough system.</TE>
<TE>   Mark Volper, an advertising executive, demanded to know why the
Valley secession campaign hasn't been launched.</TE>
<TE>   Gerry Gunster, who introduced himself to the group as its campaign
manager, said he had a plan for a campaign, but wouldn't reveal it
with the media present.</TE>
<TE>   Also Monday, Hollywood secessionists said they reject any proposal
for a borough system of city government as an alternative to
secession. They said putting a borough plan on the ballot alongside
the secession measures would be "a cynical and subversive attempt to
confuse voters."</TE>

<HD>Richness of Life Allays Fears as Scientists Study 1987
Wreck</HD>
<DH>Fisheries: Researchers find no toxic wasteland where a
freighter laden with copper ore sank. But questions remain and study
continues.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KENNETH R. WEISS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The ship's bow struck the sea floor so hard it buckled like an
accordion. The stern sticks up at an odd 45-degree angle. The belly
of the twisted wreckage lies in broken parts, 1,480 feet down, half
buried under silt in the black stillness of the deep sea.</LD>
<LD>   Federal scientists just wrapped up their first visit to the Pac
Baroness in 14 years, scrutinizing the remains of the 562-foot
freighter that collided with another ship in 1987 north of Santa
Barbara and sank with its cargo of toxic copper ore.</LD>
<LD>   Environmentalists have worried that the finely powdered copper
concentrate might be poisoning sea life. Some fishermen, testifying
against proposed marine reserves nearby, blame leaching
metals--rather than overfishing--for the Santa Barbara Channel's
steep declines in fish, shellfish and kelp forests.</LD>
<TE>   So a team of scientists set off last week on a Navy research ship
for a three-day tour of the site near Point Conception. Using a video
camera and relying on the bright lights of an unmanned submarine, the
scientists managed to penetrate the darkness and crushing depths.
They announced their preliminary findings Monday.</TE>
<TE>   "Our worst fears were not proven to be true," said Sarah Fangman,
research coordinator at the Channel Islands National Marine
Sanctuary. "If it were a toxic wasteland, you wouldn't expect to see
the sea life we saw."</TE>
<TE>   Instead of a dead zone, the scientists saw sablefish, Dover sole,
blackgill and thorny-head rockfish swimming amid the wreckage. Sea
urchins, sea stars, crabs and sea anemone seem to thrive around and
even on the ship. Researchers spotted no evidence of leaking fuel
oil.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the initial scouting left the most serious questions
unresolved. "Is the wreck a source of major contaminants and trouble
for the ocean?" Fangman asked. "I cannot answer that. But some fish
and shellfish find it a perfectly acceptable place to live."</TE>
<TE>   Earlier research, however, pointed to serious contamination, and
so federal scientists plan to continue collecting samples of sea
water, sediment and sea life to see if there still are pollution
problems.</TE>
<TE>   In the months immediately after the shipwreck, Stanley V.
Margolis, a UC Davis geology professor, found that some of the 23,000
tons of copper ore and 278,943 gallons of fuel and lubricating oil
had found their way into surrounding sediment.</TE>
<TE>   Of greater concern, the toxic copper had entered the food chain,
he said. Sea urchins dwelling within 800 feet of the sunken freighter
had concentrations of the mineral 100 times higher than those living
five miles away.</TE>
<TE>   Last week's expedition replicated some of Margolis' survey,
scooping up sediment samples in eight areas around the wreck and
three separate areas about five miles away. It will take three to six
months to analyze these samples and compare them with those of the
first expeditions, scientists said.</TE>
<TE>   They hope the sediment will show whether the ore and fuel oil have
dissipated, whether they continue to leak slowly from the ship's
holds or whether they have become encapsuled in the sediment that
appears to be slowly burying the Pac Baroness. The researchers did
not collect urchins or other sea life last week. Nor did they take
water samples. That will come later.</TE>
<TE>   The team wanted to make maximum use of the unmanned submarine--a
deep sea Maxrover--to take still and video pictures and scoop up
sediment samples. The Maxrover and a 200-foot research vessel, the
Independence, had been made available by the U.S. Naval Facilities
Engineering Service Center at Port Hueneme.</TE>
<TE>   Steering the Maxrover around the Pac Baroness was tricky, said Bob
Schwemmer, a shipwreck expert with the Channel Islands National
Marine Sanctuary.</TE>
<TE>   Visibility was poor and the slightest movement kicked up clouds of
fine-grain sediment that resembled smoke billowing up from the
bottom.</TE>
<TE>   "If we didn't have sonar, we would have been flying blind into
these cables," Schwemmer said. "There was a pretty good current. At
one point, it dragged the Maxrover into a cable and it took us awhile
to backtrack. That was a very tense moment."</TE>
<TE>   Besides circumnavigating the wreck, the Maxrover scouted the sea
floor about 10 miles away toward San Miguel Island. The idea was to
compare sea life at roughly the same depth a significant distance
away.</TE>
<TE>   Scientists spotted a slightly higher concentration of sea stars,
also called starfish, 10 miles from the wreck. But they found few
other differences.</TE>
<TE>   The expedition was funded by the National Marine Sanctuary
program, which has 13 sanctuaries, including one that encircles
Channel Islands National Park.</TE>
<TE>   The Pac Baroness came to rest about 12 miles southwest of Point
Conception, outside the boundaries of the Channel Islands sanctuary.
Federal researchers want to make sure the toxic copper ore is not
being transported by currents into the sanctuary, or harming the
sanctuary's marine life.</TE>
<TE>   The Pac Baroness, registered in Liberia, was carrying copper ore
to Japan when it collided with the 600-foot Atlantic Wing in dense
fog on Sept. 21, 1987.</TE>
<TE>   The Atlantic Wing, carrying 3,451 Honda cars, continued its trip
to the Port of Long Beach. The crippled Pac Baroness unleased a slick
of fuel oil that stretched for 10 miles and sank 11 hours after the
collision, disgorging enough fuel oil to create a crescent-shaped
slick 10 miles long.</TE>
<TE>   Scientists have no idea how much fuel or copper ore remains in the
ship's holds.</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>

<LD>Second-generation Vietnamese Americans who want to better know the
language of their parents are creating a surge in Vietnamese classes
in high school--and the need for new textbooks, educators say.</LD>
<LD>   Statewide enrollment in Vietnamese-language courses has more than
doubled in the last five years, school officials say. The demand
comes from children of Vietnamese immigrants who may understand their
parents' native tongue but cannot speak it.</LD>
<LD>   "It's sometimes hard to speak with my grandma because I may not
know the right words to finish my sentence, so I have to use English
words," said 12-year-old Mai Tran of Garden Grove, who is looking
ahead to high school with the language courses in mind. "It would be
pretty cool to learn more Vietnamese."</LD>
<TE>   Among high schools starting Vietnamese language courses this fall
are Bolsa Grande and La Quinta in Garden Grove. Westminster High
School's 3-year-old program has tripled to serve more than 100
students with the addition of intermediate and advanced courses.</TE>
<TE>   California schools teaching Vietnamese now use the four-book
series "Vietnamese for Vietnamese Speakers," which was commissioned
in 1993 by Nguyet Dinh, a language programs administrator at San
Jose's East Side Union High School District.</TE>
<TE>   But the series is badly out of date.</TE>
<TE>   The state last adopted language texts in 1991 but "a lot has
happened in that time," said Jean James, a state Department of
Education program consultant who leads the state's effort to adopt
foreign-language textbooks.</TE>
<TE>   To meet that need, Dinh has hired Vietnamese American scholars to
update the texts. The second edition will then be sold to school
districts nationwide.</TE>
<TE>   "We wanted to work with Vietnamese scholars who had experience in
teaching literature and language in Vietnam and who understand the
Vietnamese American experience," Dinh said. "These scholars are
rare.''</TE>
<TE>   The revision is intended to make the texts more accessible to
contemporary Vietnamese Americans who want to learn the language of
their parents but do not share the same cultural experiences.</TE>
<TE>   The older texts, for example, included references assuming that
youths would ask their parents' permission before eating dinner. The
updated texts will delete these items to reflect the more
Americanized customs of many Vietnamese American families.</TE>
<TE>   Quyen Di, 54, a former high school principal, Vietnamese
university instructor and youth magazine editor in Vietnam, is one of
the two scholars working on the project. Di owns and operates a small
printing shop in Garden Grove as a "practical" occupation to pay the
bills. Academic work has been hard to find since he came to the
United States in 1978, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "I started the printing shop because I needed to find a job with a
steady income," Di said. "But I savor any work that has to do with
the Vietnamese language," such as teaching.</TE>
<TE>   Di is rewriting lessons and tossing out entire sections from the
older materials to create more consistency among chapters and levels
of complexity in the new texts. He travels at least three times a
month to San Jose to test lessons and train teachers to use the
revised textbooks.</TE>
<TE>   "Every time I have an opportunity to work on this textbook, I do
it," Di said. "When I help San Jose, it will help other school
districts ... because these are the only textbooks available to teach
native speakers."</TE>
<TE>   Huynh Dinh Te, 73, of Downey was commissioned to edit the revised
texts and write the four-page curriculum guideline on which the
learning materials are based.</TE>
<TE>   "Having the proper textbooks to teach Vietnamese grammar and
language has not been a priority for many public schools," said Te,
who received his doctorate in language and communication from
Columbia University after immigrating to the United States. Now
retired, he was a college professor in Vietnam before teaching at Cal
State Long Beach, UC Irvine and Chapman University.</TE>
<TE>   Without the work of these men, Vietnamese American students would
be struggling to recover the language of their parents and
grandparents, said language specialist KimOanh Nguyen-Lam of the
Center for Language Minority Education and Research in Long Beach.</TE>
<TE>   "These scholars are willing to write these textbooks ... because
this is their passion and they know younger students can benefit,"
she said.</TE>

<HD>Doctor Testifies Virk Was Insane</HD>
<DH>Crime: As the trial's second phase begins, a psychiatrist
says she didn't know right from wrong when trying to drown her
children.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TRACY WILSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Suffering delusions and severe depression, Narinder Virk could not
tell right from wrong when she attempted to drown her children in
Channel Islands Harbor two years ago, a court-appointed psychiatrist
testified Monday.</LD>
<LD>   Dr. Ronald Shlensky told jurors that based on his evaluation, Virk
was insane at the time of the crime.</LD>
<LD>   "This patient clearly meets the test," said Shlensky, the first
witness to take the stand during the sanity phase of Virk's trial. "I
don't think she really knew what she was doing."</LD>
<TE>   Virk, 42, was convicted last week on two counts of attempted
murder after a jury found she deliberately tried to drown her
6-year-old daughter and 9-year-old son in the harbor on Jan. 12,
2000.</TE>
<TE>   The case now proceeds to a second phase in which the same jurors
must decide whether Virk, a former Port Hueneme resident, was sane at
the time.</TE>
<TE>   During a brief opening statement Monday, Deputy Public Defender
Cynthia Ellington told jurors they would hear testimony this week
from two court-appointed medical experts who evaluated Virk.</TE>
<TE>   Both doctors concluded that Virk, an Indian immigrant who alleges
she was beaten and abused by her spouse, was insane when she took her
children to the harbor and pushed them in, Ellington said.</TE>
<TE>   Other experts will testify about Indian culture. Doctors and
nurses from the Ventura County Jail may also be called by the defense
to testify about Virk's psychotic episodes while in jail, Ellington
said.</TE>
<TE>   During the sanity phase, the burden is on the defense to prove
that Virk was suffering from a mental defect that rendered her unable
to understand the nature of her actions or distinguish right from
wrong.</TE>
<TE>   Ellington told jurors that California law recognizes "there are
mental states in which crimes are committed."</TE>
<TE>   And she argued that at the end of the sanity phase, a
preponderance of the evidence will show that Virk was legally insane
as a result of depression, isolation and spousal abuse.</TE>
<TE>   Senior Deputy Dist. Atty. Richard Simon told jurors in his opening
remarks, however, that Virk knew what she was doing when she led her
children to the harbor in the middle of the night and pushed them off
a boat dock into the icy water.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no way the defense is going to show the defendant was
not legally sane at the time," Simon said. "She knew the difference
between right from wrong."</TE>
<TE>   Last week, Simon argued that Virk deliberately tried to kill her
two children to punish her husband. In their verdict, jurors
specifically found that Virk acted with premeditation and
deliberation.</TE>
<TE>   During Monday's testimony, Simon challenged Shlensky's conclusions
about whether or not Virk was sane.</TE>
<TE>   Referring to a jail doctor's notes, the prosecutors attempted to
show that Virk began to suffer psychotic episodes after her arrest
and incarceration.</TE>
<TE>   Shlensky disagreed, stating that Virk "clearly" exhibited signs of
mental illness prior to the Jan. 12 incident.</TE>
<TE>   Also Monday, Robert Goldman, professor of South and Southeast
Asian Studies at UC Berkeley, testified that water holds a spiritual
connection in Indian culture, mythology and religion.</TE>
<TE>   "People go there to die," he said.</TE>

<HD>Supporters Still Believe in Her</HD>
<DH>Courts: The backers, some of whom are Sikhs, attend Virk's
trial every day. They say she was abused and deserves another chance.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TRACY WILSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>They drive for miles to sit in a courtroom and silently support a
woman they barely know.</LD>
<LD>   None of Narinder Virk's supporters is related to her. Some cannot
hold a conversation with the 42-year-old woman, because she speaks
only Punjabi.</LD>
<LD>   Yet they rally around the diminutive defendant, a pencil-thin
Indian immigrant who can neither read nor write, because they believe
she was a battered wife incapable of carrying out the crime she was
convicted of last week.</LD>
<TE>   Now, supporters hope that jurors will spare Virk from a possible
prison sentence by finding she was legally insane when she tried to
drown her children two years ago.</TE>
<TE>   "Don't let her rot in the jail," said Nina Sloan, a 68-year-old La
Puente resident who accompanies Virk to the Ventura courthouse almost
daily.</TE>
<TE>   "I feel that she was really battered," Sloan said. "I feel that
she should be given another chance."</TE>
<TE>   Virk, 42, was found guilty of attempted murder Friday after jurors
concluded that she deliberately pushed her 9-year-old son and
6-year-old daughter off a boat dock at Channel Islands Harbor on the
night of Jan. 12, 2000. An Oxnard resident heard a child's cries and
rescued the family.</TE>
<TE>   Virk, who was living in Port Hueneme, was charged with two counts
of attempted murder. She pleaded not guilty by reason of insanity.</TE>
<TE>   During a three-week trial, prosecutors argued that Virk tried to
kill her children to punish her allegedly abusive husband.</TE>
<TE>   But Virk's attorney told jurors that her client was so mentally
deranged after enduring years of abuse that she was incapable of
forming the intent to kill.</TE>
<TE>   Virk's case has struck a chord with Indian organizations, members
of the Sikh community and advocates for battered women.</TE>
<TE>   Sympathizers, who raised $500,000 to release Virk on bail, say the
woman was trapped in a tortured marriage and rendered helpless by the
rigid values of her culture.</TE>
<TE>   Virk grew up the daughter of farm laborers in the village of
Kalsingha, in the northwest province of Punjab. Brought to this
country by the man her parents had chosen as her husband, she was
isolated, abused and paralyzed with fear, witnesses testified at her
trial.</TE>
<TE>   "In my opinion, the district attorney should never have put
charges on a woman who was obviously deeply abused and endured
horrific conditions," said Gitanjali Singh, a 24-year-old UCLA
graduate student in Asian American studies who has been attending
Virk's trial. "I think she should get rehabilitation and a job and
therapy."</TE>
<TE>   Singh is one of half a dozen sympathizers who have shown up
regularly during Virk's trial. They include college students,
retirees and a dentist and his wife who are active in the Sikh
community.</TE>
<TE>   Some, like the defendant herself, come to court dressed in
traditional Indian attire. Most sit in the front row of Superior
Court Judge Ken Riley's courtroom.</TE>
<TE>   Sloan has been a constant presence. A retired Los Angeles county
employee who, like Virk, was raised in India, she says Virk's case
echoes her own experiences as a battered woman.</TE>
<TE>   "I was in that same situation before," she said. "No human being
should be treated like that."</TE>
<TE>   A Punjabi speaker, Sloan began visiting Virk at the jail more than
a year ago and put up $250,000 in cash, property and investments to
help gain Virk's release on bail.</TE>
<TE>   She and other supporters later got Virk a job as a housekeeper and
caregiver for a woman with Parkinson's disease.</TE>
<TE>   Regardless of the jury's verdict, Sloan and others believe Virk is
a victim--not a criminal--and are standing by her throughout the
court proceedings.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no change in support," she said.</TE>

punished.</CP>

<HD>Judge Keeps D.A. on the Ryder Case</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A judge refused to disqualify the Los Angeles County district
attorney's office Monday from prosecuting actress Winona Ryder in her
shoplifting case, despite accusations by her attorney that
prosecutors are trying to taint prospective jurors.</LD>
<LD>   Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Elden S. Fox ruled after a
hearing in the Beverly Hills courthouse that the district attorney's
office was not involved in a conflict of interest and that the case
should not be turned over to the state attorney general's office.</LD>
<LD>   Deputy Atty. Gen. Sharlene Honnaka had opposed the motion, arguing
that prosecutors did not appear to have an ax to grind with Ryder or
to have a conflict in the case. "This is nothing more than
speculation," she said.</LD>
<TE>   Though defense attorney Mark Geragos had filed his motion under
seal, he said in court that the motion included 22 items that he
believed show that Ryder was "not getting fair treatment" and that
prosecutors were trying to publicly humiliate her and to taint
potential jurors.</TE>
<TE>   For example, Geragos said, the district attorney's spokeswoman,
Sandi Gibbons, inaccurately told reporters in February that a Saks
Fifth Avenue security tape showed Ryder cutting off sensor tags on
merchandise. He said Gibbons also told a reporter in June that she
shops at Target, not Saks, adding, "I don't know what kind of jury
she's going to have, but if they're people like me, then perhaps they
won't be laughing either."</TE>
<TE>   Geragos suggested in court that prosecutors would not allow Ryder
to plead unless she admitted guilt, which he said violated both state
and federal case law.</TE>
<TE>   Fox said he was concerned about what appeared to be inaccurate
statements made by the district attorney's office. But he said they
do not rise to the level necessary to disqualify the office from the
case.</TE>
<TE>   "The district attorney can proceed with the prosecution," Fox
said.</TE>
<TE>   Fox warned that he might impose a gag order on the attorneys to
ensure that Ryder receives a fair trial.</TE>
<TE>   Ryder, star of "The Age of Innocence," "Girl, Interrupted" and
other films, is free on $20,000 bail and was not in court. She faces
felony charges of second-degree burglary, grand theft, vandalism and
possession of a drug without a prescription.</TE>
<TE>   The 30-year-old actress is accused of shoplifting about $6,000
worth of merchandise from the Saks Fifth Avenue store in Beverly
Hills and could face three years and eight months in state prison if
convicted.</TE>
<TE>   Geragos said he would consult his client before deciding whether
to appeal Fox's ruling. Attorneys are to return to court for a
pretrial hearing in the case on Aug. 13.</TE>

<HD>San Diego Offers Assurances After 2 Beach Shootings</HD>
<DH>Safety: One victim is dead. Fearing ill effects on tourism,
officials vow to protect visitors.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TONY PERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>After two weekend shootings at the city's popular Mission Beach, city
officials branded the suspect Monday as a coward and assured tourists
that San Diego remains one of the safest big cities in the United
States.</LD>
<LD>   The shootings--which left a 22-year-old college student dead and a
Swedish tourist wounded--were particularly threatening in a city
whose economy depends on tourism and where many residents are
confirmed beach lovers.</LD>
<LD>   "I am both sickened and outraged by these atrocities," said
Councilman Byron Wear, who represents the area. "These were cowardly
acts committed by individuals who can only be described as hoodlums."</LD>
<TE>   Police Chief David Bejarano, at a beachfront news conference,
vowed that an arrest would be made.</TE>
<TE>   He added: "We do a good job protecting our tourists."</TE>
<TE>   Although other cities, notably Miami and New York, have had
high-profile crimes against tourists, San Diego has gained a
reputation for safety.</TE>
<TE>   The city's Convention and Visitors Bureau emphasizes San Diego as
a family-friendly vacation spot.</TE>
<TE>   "We have been fortunate and blessed that visitor safety has not
been an issue for those who travel here," said a convention official,
Sal Giametta, whose organization is seeking to help two Swedish
tourists who were robbed before one was shot.</TE>
<TE>   Bejarano said the suspect in both shootings is an African American
male in his 20s, 6 feet tall, with a thin jawline beard. The suspect
was in a group that may have included gang members, Bejarano said.</TE>
<TE>   "We know someone out there has some information," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Wear said the City Council may need to revisit two controversial
issues of the past: a curfew on beaches and an alcohol ban. City
voters rejected an alcohol ban last year.</TE>
<TE>   Although Mission Beach is known for rowdy late-night parties,
where bonfires and beer-drinking are common, violent crime is rare.</TE>
<TE>   Bejarano and Wear noted that Sunday morning's outburst was the
first violent crime in the beach area in a summer season nearing its
midpoint.</TE>
<TE>   The first incident occurred around 2:30 a.m. when 15 to 20 young
men approached a group of college students who had a bonfire at the
El Carmel Point section of Mission Beach.</TE>
<TE>   A scuffle broke out when the college students felt the newcomers
were attempting to steal their bicycles.</TE>
<TE>   One student suffered a broken jaw and another, Paul Mefford, 22, a
part-time bartender and graphic design student at San Diego State
University, was fatally shot.</TE>
<TE>   An hour later, the Swedish tourists were robbed at gunpoint a few
hundred yards away, near the bathroom at the Belmont Park section of
Mission Bay. The woman was shot in the ankle.</TE>
<TE>   Word of the shootings spread rapidly Monday morning as local
residents, tourists and others flocked to the beach.</TE>
<TE>   "Man, somebody got killed here," said Joe Klimko of Phoenix. "That
kind of thing happens in other places, but not in San Diego."</TE>

<HD>Wind-Driven Mono County Wildfire Forces Evacuations</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From a Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A stubborn wildfire driven by high winds Monday forced the evacuation
of more than 150 tourists and residents around Topaz Lake in Mono
County, and left two stretches of highway closed, authorities said.</LD>
<LD>   The 7,200-acre fire, a complex of three flare-ups sparked by
lightning just north of Walker, tore through stands of Jeffrey pine,
pinyon, juniper and sagebrush, crossing over California 89 and
scorching part of U.S. 395, which may be closed for up to a week
because of burned guardrails and power poles, said Tom Crawford, a
spokesman for the Bureau of Land Management's fire response team.</LD>
<LD>   Much of the fire was burning on the Nevada side of Toiyabe
National Forest, although one front was advancing up Monitor Pass, he
said. Some 614 firefighters battled two fronts heading northwest and
northeast, driven by winds from the south, Crawford said. "A good
portion of it is still burning on the California side," he said.</LD>
<TE>   Firefighters saved the Topaz Lodge and other structures, but a
barn belonging to the state Department of Fish and Game was
destroyed. Evacuations were ordered from the lake area, Holbrook
Junction and Double Springs Flat, Crawford said.</TE>
<TE>   The fire was only about 10% contained as of Monday night, and
expected to grow overnight. The blaze was one of dozens sparked by
lightning storms that passed over the Sierra over the weekend.</TE>

<DL>KABUL, Afghanistan</DL>
<LD>Deputy Defense Secretary Paul D. Wolfowitz came to Afghanistan on
Monday to try to discourage mounting factionalism among warlords and
foster the development of a national army, but instead found himself
responding to sharp criticism of a recent U.S. raid that killed
dozens of civilians.</LD>
<LD>   The June 30 raid on several remote villages in Oruzgan province
killed 48 people, mostly women and children, and injured 117,
according to figures compiled by Afghan officials. The raid has drawn
angry protests from the Afghan government and seems to have
precipitated a number of attacks on U.S. soldiers.</LD>
<LD>   While acknowledging that civilians were killed, Wolfowitz
oscillated between a defense of the raid, which he made when speaking
at a U.S. air base in the morning, and more nuanced comments, made
later in Kabul, the capital.</LD>
<TE>   "We are always concerned when we believe we may have killed
innocent people, and we think that happened and we regret that," he
said at Bagram air base. But, he added, "we have no regrets about
going in after bad guys, and there were some there."</TE>
<TE>   However, at a news conference at the presidential palace with
Afghan Foreign Minister Abdullah, Wolfowitz suggested that the
military would try to make some changes demanded by Afghan
authorities.</TE>
<TE>   "It is very important to us to work with Afghan authorities on
both a local and national level to make sure our operations are
coordinated and they proceed in a way that contributes to the
long-term stability of this country," he said. "When we have made a
mistake or think we may have made a mistake, as in Oruzgan, we will
try to track down as thoroughly as we can the causes of it to try and
prevent it."</TE>
<TE>   Wolfowitz offered no specifics on how the U.S. might alter its
approach to avoid such errors and said that even with added
vigilance, there are no guarantees that such a tragedy would never
happen again.</TE>
<TE>   At a news briefing Monday, Pentagon spokeswoman Victoria Clarke
said that the U.S. has been coordinating with local Afghans, noting
that there were some Afghan forces on the ground during the Oruzgan
raid operating with U.S. troops. However, she said she had no details
as to who they were or to whom they reported.</TE>
<TE>   Wolfowitz's visit comes at a critical moment in the new Afghan
government's effort to exert its influence over the unsteady nation.
Many areas of the country remain under the influence of regional
warlords, and because there is no national army, the government of
President Hamid Karzai has no way to enforce its policies.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials believe the answer is to create a multiethnic army
that would be loyal to the central government. But initial efforts to
train such a force have been fraught with difficulty. Members of
different ethnic groups are sometimes wary of working together and
taking orders from one another. Furthermore, unless regional warlords
disband their militias and support the national army, it will have
little clout in areas where warlords' forces remain active.</TE>
<TE>   "The goal is to stabilize the country, to bring security to the
country," Wolfowitz said. "That's going to require some kind of
balance between central government and local leaders; clearly the
central government is still very weak."</TE>
<TE>   In an effort to help Karzai's government in one of its biggest
trouble spots, Wolfowitz traveled Monday afternoon to the northern
city of Mazar-i-Sharif, where there have been repeated outbursts of
fighting between the militias of three warlords from different ethnic
groups. Wolfowitz met with two of the chiefs--Abdul Rashid Dostum, an
Uzbek, and Haji Mohammed Mukhaqiq, a Hazara--and reminded them that
if fighting does not stop, Western aid groups and nongovernmental
organizations will halt their efforts to supply the area with food,
shelter and other items.</TE>
<TE>   "Even these tough generals care about their people," Wolfowitz
said, adding that the key to lasting security is a national army and
money for rebuilding and development. "It is very important for the
security ... to make good on the promises the world has made."</TE>
<TE>   If people have shelter, food and employment, there will be less
desire to take up arms, he said.</TE>

<LD>An American journalist who was ordered to leave Zimbabwe within 24
hours after being found not guilty of publishing a false story will
challenge the expulsion order in court today.</LD>
<LD>   Andrew Meldrum, an Ohio native and the Zimbabwe correspondent of
Britain's Guardian newspaper, said the High Court would hear his
appeal that the order by President Robert Mugabe's government to
revoke his permanent residence permit was "unfair and illegal."</LD>
<LD>   The judge said that although Meldrum had reproduced a false story
from a local daily saying that Mugabe's supporters had beheaded a
woman while her two children watched, he had tried to verify the
story with the police, who had refused to cooperate.</LD>

<LD>The only Yangtze River dolphin in captivity has died of old age after
a life span that "was the equivalent of a 70-year-old man," a

<LD>   The 25-year-old male, named Qi Qi, died Sunday, said the official

ex-dictator Suharto, surprising many who expected him to face a death
sentence for allegedly ordering the assassination of a judge.</LD>
<LD>   Hutomo Mandala Putra, better known as Tommy, is accused of
masterminding the 2001 slaying of Syaifudin Kartasasmita, a Supreme
Court judge who sentenced him to 18 months in prison in 2000 for a

<LD>   Tommy has denied wrongdoing. If found guilty, he could still
receive the death penalty despite the prosecutors' more lenient
demand. The court is scheduled to decide later this month whether to
convict him.</LD>

<HD>Shiite Leader Says Iraqi Opposition Is Open to U.S. Help in
Toppling Hussein</HD>
<DH>Mideast: Air support--but not an invasion--is needed,
according to an ayatollah based in Iran, who says groups are
collaborating.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL SLACKMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>TEHRAN</DL>
<LD>Iraq's main opposition forces have begun coordinating their military
efforts and would welcome U.S. air support in their bid to topple
President Saddam Hussein, according to the leaders of one of the
groups.</LD>
<LD>   Speaking from a well-guarded compound in Tehran, where he has been
in exile for more than two decades, Shiite opposition leader
Ayatollah Mohammed Bakr Hakim said last week that his organization
opposes a full-blown U.S. invasion but supports the idea of a mission
in which massive bombing paves the way for local forces to fight on
the ground.</LD>
<LD>   "We don't need an invasion," Bakr Hakim told The Times, in
comments that may provide a glimpse into the mind-set of his
benefactors in the Iranian regime. "You must distinguish between an
American invasion and [an] attack--the Iraqi people can protect
themselves if there is no heavy artillery or weapons of mass
destruction in the hands of the regime."</LD>
<TE>   He said his group has been working with the military leaders of
the two main Kurdish factions in northern Iraq, which make up the
strongest opposition force inside the country. U.S. officials have
acknowledged that the Kurdish opposition would probably play a
substantial role in any effort to overthrow Hussein.</TE>
<TE>   Bakr Hakim, president of the Supreme Assembly of the Islamic
Revolution in Iraq, said his organization hadn't been contacted by
Washington--an assertion disputed by State Department
officials--because, he said, America is reluctant to approach a group
based in Iran. In his State of the Union address earlier this year,
President Bush grouped Iran, Iraq and North Korea into what he termed
an "axis of evil."</TE>
<TE>   Officials with SAIRI, as the group is widely known, said the
United States is overlooking a potentially valuable ally in the
battle for Baghdad. They dispute the apparent U.S. assessment that
Iraqi opposition forces lack a credible military capability and argue
that with appropriate backup, a united Kurdish and Shiite advance
would win the support of the Iraqi people and overthrow Hussein.</TE>
<TE>   "You see, we are sure, from inside Iraq, if the balance of power
is broken by bombing or whatever, you will see what happens," said
Sami Mahdi, director of international relations for SAIRI. "Even the
security forces will join us."</TE>
<TE>   For years, Washington had no contacts with the group, in part
because of concern over its close ties with and financial dependence
on the Iranian regime as well as its religious orientation, according
to U.S. officials. Republican as well as Democratic administrations
wanted to ensure that Iraq's secular dictatorship wasn't replaced by
a religious dictatorship--especially one with close ties to
theocratic Iran.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, top State Department officials meet regularly with
SAIRI representatives in London--and over the years have met with
representatives in Washington, State Department officials said. Both
the Clinton and Bush administrations also tried to meet with Bakr
Hakim when he traveled outside Iran, but he has refused the
overtures, department sources said.</TE>
<TE>   Strength Hard to Gauge</TE>
<TE>   It is difficult to know for sure what is happening inside Iraq,
especially as Baghdad and Washington engage in a war of wits that may
be a prologue to a military confrontation. For that reason, it can't
be said with any certainty how well armed Bakr Hakim's group really
is, though he says he has thousands of fighters on standby in the
north and south of Iraq, and in Iran.</TE>
<TE>   More important, it is difficult to gauge just how much public
support the group has in Iraq, where about 70% of the population is
Shiite--although the rulership is Sunni Muslim.</TE>
<TE>   One diplomatic source said the Iran-based group is well organized
but does not have widespread support in the south, where the majority
of the Shiite population lives, and may not represent the secular
Shiite community in Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials said it appears that other groups, both old and
new, have begun to emerge within the Shiite community and that SAIRI
may be panicking over its waning influence.</TE>
<TE>   "It's losing traction rapidly among its own people," said an
administration official, who requested anonymity. "Hakim is running
scared, and so is Iran, because its primary instrument is suddenly
having a popularity crisis. SAIRI is now on the defense within the
Shiite community."</TE>
<TE>   Yet even while Bakr Hakim's credentials within the Shiite
community are uncertain, his remarks serve as a valuable barometer
for what Iranian officials are thinking--or at least what they want
to project to the world.</TE>
<TE>   When tempers were hotter, in the days immediately after Bush made
his "axis of evil" remark, Tehran--and Bakr Hakim--flatly rejected
the U.S. playing any role in removing Hussein.</TE>
<TE>   But while Iran still officially opposes U.S. military action in
Iraq, the Interior Ministry announced this month that it wouldn't
block Bakr Hakim from talking with the United States. That was
broadly taken as a nod and a wink from a regime that could easily
shut down any communication between the two.</TE>
<TE>   Iran's plans could prove crucial to U.S. efforts at winning
support--or at least neutrality--from neighboring countries as well
as for maintaining regional stability if Hussein falls. America's
Sunni Muslim allies, such as Saudi Arabia, are in particular
concerned that Shiite-controlled Iran could try to annex the south of
Iraq, or indirectly control it through political and religious
influence.</TE>
<TE>   Other countries, such as Turkey and Syria, are opposed to any
fracturing of Iraq that would lead to an independent Kurdish state, a
prospect that could destabilize their own efforts to control Kurdish
populations within their borders.</TE>
<TE>   But Bakr Hakim's comments suggest that Iran is prepared to take a
hands-off approach--which it says is what it did with
Afghanistan--neither assisting Iraq in the event of an offensive
against Baghdad nor seeking to further its regional ambitions
afterward.</TE>
<TE>   Bakr Hakim said he wanted to assure the world community that his
group supports a united Iraq and that there is no intention to create
an Islamic republic on the model of Iran.</TE>
<TE>   "We have three major problems in Iraq that we would like the next
government to solve," Bakr Hakim said. "One is a dictatorship; we
want to get rid of this. The second is sectarian discrimination; we
want to get rid of discrimination. The third is to get rid of
discrimination based on race against Kurds."</TE>
<TE>   Bakr Hakim's openness about working with the U.S. against Hussein
comes at a time when Iranian society is deeply troubled over how to
handle the Iraqi situation.</TE>
<TE>   On the one hand, Iranians of all political stripes, from
hard-liners to communists, are offended that Bush would lump their
country with Iraq. Many people here feel it demonstrates a deep
misunderstanding of Iran. And there also is a lot of lingering anger
and bitterness over the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq war, which left hundreds of
thousands dead on both sides.</TE>
<TE>   The backlash over Bush's comments notwithstanding, it appears that
Iranians are prepared to at least look the other way should Iraq be
targeted, if for no other reason than many people here are worried
about being next on the U.S. hit list of military targets.</TE>
<TE>   And there is a broad sense here that each of Iran's political
factions--including the conservatives and reformists--would gain some
internal political clout from improved ties with America.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a lot we can do for America. We have a militia here. We
can help," one Iranian official said, referring to Bakr Hakim's
militia, known as the Badr Brigade, after a pivotal war in early
Muslim history. "But not unconditionally."</TE>
<TE>   Iranians Miffed at U.S.</TE>
<TE>   Iranians across the political spectrum say they feel they've been
cheated by Washington, which they say has shown no gratitude for
Tehran's support during the Afghan war or for its immediate
condemnation of the Sept. 11 attacks. That is another reason there is
some reluctance, as they see it, to help out with Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   Stepping carefully, Iran has insisted that the Iraqi opposition it
hosts can pursue its own agenda, suggesting a level of independence
that has not always existed. At one time, for example, an Iranian
official served as the president of the Shiite group.</TE>
<TE>   But now, Bakr Hakim said, the organization has a formal structure.
It has a 100-member general assembly made up of expatriates, who
elect a central committee charged with selecting the president.</TE>
<TE>   The group also has three military organizations, Bakr Hakim said,
including a classic-style army based in Iran, guerrilla forces in
northern Iraq and undercover forces in southern Iraq. The group said
it has training facilities in Iran but declined to say where it gets
its funding or how many troops it has.</TE>
<TE>   The group claims that its forces are trained well enough to be
able to hold post-Hussein Iraq together and to protect the people.
SAIRI has been one of four opposition groups, including the Kurds and
the Iraqi National Accord, that meet regularly in London and have
begun to challenge the U.S.-financed Iraqi National Congress for
leadership of the opposition.</TE>
<TE>   Still, when it comes to weapons, the group's leaders acknowledge
that although they are armed, they would have to rely on the Iraqi
military's joining them--a prospect analysts have said is far from
certain.</TE>
<TE>   Bakr Hakim and his followers arrived in Tehran 23 years ago, in
the waning days of the shah's regime. After the collapse of the
Pahlavi dynasty and the rise of the Islamic Republic, the Iraqi
opposition was allowed to settle in Tehran, much the way Baghdad has
played host to the Iranian opposition militia, which calls itself
Moujahedeen Khalq.</TE>
<TE>   Bakr Hakim says he and his supporters see a chance to fulfill
ambitions dashed after the 1991 Persian Gulf War and the U.S. refusal
to support their uprising.</TE>
<TE>   The ayatollah, who wears religious robes and the black turban
indicating he is a descendant of the prophet Muhammad, said he is
still bitter about the way the United States turned its back on the
Shiites in the south who risked their lives in an effort to overthrow
the regime immediately after the Gulf War.</TE>
<TE>   He said his followers liberated 14 provinces before Hussein
managed to regroup and crush the uprising. The U.S. and Britain have
since enforced "no-fly" zones over the Kurdish north and Shiite
south, ostensibly to protect the population from attack</TE>
<TE>   "George Bush the father, he made a big mistake against the Iraqi
people," Bakr Hakim said. "We hope George Bush the son does not make
the same mistake."</TE>
<TE>   Mahdi, the SAIRI international relations director, said his
group's troops are better disciplined and better trained this time
around but that there is even more at stake now for opponents of the
regime.</TE>
<TE>   He said that sources inside Iraq have reported that Hussein, in a
bid to stave off an uprising in the south, has ringed southern
communities with barrels of chemical weapons and charges that, if
detonated, would send deadly clouds of smoke into the air. Mahdi said
Hussein has also dug trenches between communities to isolate people.</TE>
<TE>   "The United States has time to coordinate this," Mahdi said. "They
should not hesitate to discuss any point with us for the future.
[But] they should respect our people, and our will."</TE>

<HD>Hostages Are Free in Mexico Airport Clash</HD>
<DH>Dispute: Farmers turn over 19 people after the government
releases a dozen of their protesters. Officials might reconsider the
project.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS KRAUL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MEXICO CITY</DL>
<LD>Ending an explosive four-day standoff, farmers opposed to a new
international airport released 19 hostages early Monday after the
government freed a dozen protesters and indicated it might be willing
to reconsider the project.</LD>
<LD>   Although the dispute is far from settled, citizens of San Salvador
Atenco, located at the heart of the planned airport site, scored a
victory by forcing the state to release its prisoners first and
getting the federal government to promise a dialogue with those
affected by the airport plans.</LD>
<LD>   Ever since the site for the $2.3-billion facility was announced in
October, landholders in the Texcoco area 18 miles northeast of the
capital have expressed outrage at the price the government offered
for the 13,300 acres of land needed for the project. Others vowed
they wouldn't leave at any price.</LD>
<TE>   On Thursday, the dispute turned violent as farmers occupied
municipal buildings, took hostages and destroyed or hijacked at least
30 vehicles, which they then used to block highways. Barricades were
thrown up around the town, and more than two dozen people were hurt
in skirmishes between farmers and police.</TE>
<TE>   With tensions mounting, the government appeared to blink first,
softening the position that the project would continue as planned.</TE>
<TE>   At a Sunday night news conference, Interior Minister Santiago
Creel said the government was considering raising its offer to
landholders, and he refused to answer a reporter's question as to
whether the airport site might be moved.</TE>
<TE>   "Give us the chance to [meet with farmers] and then when we are
done with this consulting effort and have explored all possibilities,
then I think it will be fair to definitively respond to that
question," Creel said. He added that the government was also
considering a land swap.</TE>
<TE>   Blockades of main roads into San Salvador Atenco were being lifted
Monday afternoon, but a meeting between farmers and government
officials had not materialized. Farmers were planning another rally
today before the presidential residence, Los Pinos.</TE>
<TE>   Although farmers at one point in the standoff threatened to kill
the hostages, those released Monday, including assistant state
prosecutor Jose Andres Mendiola, said they had been treated well.
Hostages were delivered early Monday to a nearby exchange point,
hours after state police released their prisoners.</TE>
<TE>   "They gave us three meals a day and covers to keep warm during the
night," security guard Horacio Santibanez told a local reporter after
his release. A defiant Ignacio del Valle, a protest leader who had
been jailed by Mexico state police and charged with inciting a riot,
said after he was released that his group would continue to "struggle
to conserve the patrimony of our children."</TE>
<TE>   Releasing the prisoners "was an act of good faith," state Gov.
Arturo Montiel said Monday.</TE>
<TE>   The new six-runway airport is to replace Mexico City's Benito
Juarez International Airport. The Texcoco site was selected over a
more distant location in Hidalgo state, largely because of lower
costs. But about 34,000 people live at the Texcoco site, whereas the
Hidalgo parcel is largely vacant. Moreover, environmentalists have
criticized the Texcoco location because it includes marshlands used
by migratory birds.</TE>
<TE>   Much of the Texcoco land is held in ejidos, a form of land grant
given to farmers and peasants as part of Mexico's land reform after
the 1910 revolution. Owners have been offered about 70 cents per
square meter of land.</TE>
<TE>   Ruben Lechuga, an anthropologist at Iberoamericana University in
Mexico City, said the ejido holders he has talked with have taken a
harder line toward the government since the violence broke out
Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   "Before you had some younger members who were willing to negotiate
a sale of land to the government," he said. "Now things have changed,
and the words you hear most are 'We won't sell.' "</TE>
<TE>   Rafael Aguirre in The Times' Mexico City Bureau contributed to

<HD>Two Perspectives to Life on Israel's Clock</HD>
<DH>Mideast: The military sees curfews as a big success.
Palestinians say the innocent are hurt.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TRACY WILKINSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NABLUS, West Bank</DL>
<LD>It's 3 p.m. and time for the Israeli army to reimpose the curfew that
confines Palestinians to their houses.</LD>
<LD>   A tank, turret spinning, followed by a military jeep and an
armored personnel carrier, roars up Rafidia Street. "Close your
shops! Return to your homes!" an Israeli officer shouts in Arabic
through a megaphone. Within seconds, the soldiers underscore their
order with rapid bursts of machine-gun fire.</LD>
<LD>   Businessman Fadi Touqan crouches and frantically tries to finish
shutting the metal doors to his small shop. In the street, other
Palestinians who had ventured out to buy food and see friends run for
cover and hurry home.</LD>
<TE>   Curfews--restrictions that in effect place about 800,000
Palestinians under house arrest--are one of the most salient features
of Israel's reoccupation of the West Bank. Since the army seized
control of seven of the eight major Palestinian cities in the West
Bank nearly four weeks ago, 24-hour curfews have been in place,
lifted every few days for a few hours to allow residents to restock.</TE>
<TE>   As far as Israel is concerned, the offensive--called Operation
Determined Path--is a major success. Launched after a wave of suicide
bombings, it has restored a measure of calm to Israeli life while
largely avoiding the international condemnation typical of earlier
incursions.</TE>
<TE>   As far as Palestinians and human rights organizations are
concerned, however, the military takeover and especially the curfews
constitute the collective punishment of innocents along with the
guilty, which is illegal under international law. Moreover, they say,
Palestinians who try to work, shop or play risk injury and even
death.</TE>
<TE>   In Kalkilya on Monday, a Palestinian worker died when Israeli
troops fired two stun grenades into the Al Manar factory, setting it
ablaze. The army said the incident began as a curfew violation.</TE>
<TE>   According to Palestinians, dozens of people were sleeping in the
factory, as many workers now routinely do because they fear that if
they go home when the curfew is lifted, they might be unable to
return to their jobs.</TE>
<TE>   Soldiers appeared at the factory early in the morning and ordered
those inside to come out. When the workers did not, the soldiers
fired a grenade inside, setting off a blaze, said Khaldon Ghashash,
owner of the factory, which makes car seat covers.</TE>
<TE>   Ghashash said workers told him that they tried to put out the fire
but that soldiers shot at them, then fired a second grenade that hit
combustible materials. The fire quickly spread, and the army brought
in a rescue squad and firetrucks from a nearby Jewish settlement to
battle it. After the blaze was extinguished, the body of Mahmoud
Samir Hilal, 22, was found inside; he apparently died of smoke
inhalation.</TE>
<TE>   Hassan Ghashash, 43, the foreman, said he, his wife and their four
children were sleeping above the factory when the fire broke out.</TE>
<TE>   "I gathered my wife and children and tried to leave the building,"
he said in a telephone interview. "The smoke and fire were heavy, and
we were not able to breathe. I soaked some towels with water, put
them on our heads and ran down the stairs and got outside.... About
18 among us had to be treated for inhaling smoke. We were lucky to
have come out alive."</TE>
<TE>   The army said it is investigating the soldiers' conduct and the
cause of the blaze. Capt. Jacob Dallal, an army spokesman, said
soldiers had seen a man fleeing into the building after violating the
curfew.</TE>
<TE>   They followed him, ordered him out and asked if anyone else was
inside. When he said no, Dallal said, the soldiers fired two stun
grenades inside, "and then some people came out." Dallal said that a
fire then started and that Palestinians and Israelis worked together
to put it out.</TE>
<TE>   Marouf Zahran, Kalkilya's mayor, accused the army of being
"barbaric." The soldiers, he said, "did not have to do what they did.
If they wanted to check the factory, they could have ordered the
workers out and searched it. But they did not do that.... There is a
curfew on Kalkilya and because of that, the workers stay at the
factory in order to work and earn a living. They have no other
choice."</TE>
<TE>   Only one Israeli--a soldier in the Gaza Strip--has been killed by
Palestinians since June 20, the day after tanks started to move back
into the West Bank. There have been no successful suicide bombings or
shooting attacks on Israeli civilians.</TE>
<TE>   In the same period, 37 Palestinians have been killed by the
Israeli army, including 21 unarmed civilians not involved in
confrontations, according to the Israeli human rights group B'Tselem.
Those figures do not include two people reportedly slain Sunday and
the worker who died Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Among the 37 dead tallied by B'Tselem were five women and 10
youths under 18. At least six unarmed people--four children and two
adults--were killed in incidents related to the curfews; either
soldiers shot at people they believed were violating the restriction,
or there was confusion over when a curfew had been lifted or
reimposed.</TE>
<TE>   Imad abu Zahra, a Palestinian journalist and freelance cameraman,
died last week after Israeli forces shot him and another journalist,
Saeed Dahleh, in the northern West Bank city of Jenin not long before
a curfew was scheduled to be reimposed.</TE>
<TE>   Tanks were in the area, and an armored personnel carrier had hit
an electrical pole, toppling it and causing sparks to fly. Dahleh,
who said he was wearing a vest with the word "Press" printed in large
letters, and Abu Zahra decided to stand in the middle of the road to
be conspicuous as they took pictures of the incident.</TE>
<TE>   "Suddenly, more tanks came and they started opening fire toward
us," Dahleh said. Intense shooting from the tanks prevented
Palestinians from getting aid for Abu Zahra for more than half an
hour, Dahleh said.</TE>
<TE>   Dallal, the army spokesman, said that a hostile crowd had gathered
around the tanks and that people were throwing Molotov cocktails when
the soldiers opened fire. They were also under fire from a sniper, he
said. "It was a bad situation," he added.</TE>
<TE>   But Dahleh said there were no clashes at the time he and Abu Zahra
were shot.</TE>
<TE>   Confusion over curfews stems from the fact that the army
deliberately does not want to give too much warning about when
restrictions are to be lifted and reinstated, lest militants take
advantage. The army also does not want to make the hours of
curfew-lifting uniform or predictable, Dallal said.</TE>
<TE>   Although some restriction of movement is generally considered
acceptable in specific instances--when, for example, a suspected
terrorist is en route to a target--Israel's use of blanket curfews
goes beyond that, human rights advocates say.</TE>
<TE>   "Given the fact that since the beginning [of the conflict that
erupted in September 2000], Israel has been using curfews in a way
that affects the entire population, we take it as collective
punishment," said Lior Yavne, spokesman for B'Tselem.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, a poll conducted by Tel Aviv University shortly
after the reoccupation began showed that 80% of Jewish Israelis
support the army's move back into Palestinian cities, even though a
majority of those polled said they believed that the operation would
deliver only short-term security gains.</TE>

Ramallah contributed to this report.</TE>

<LD>Osama bin Laden was wounded in a U.S. bombing raid on Afghanistan in
December but is in good health, the editor of a London-based pan-Arab
newspaper said Monday.</LD>
<LD>   Abdel Bari Atwan, editor of the London-based Al Quds al Arabi,
said sources close to the Al Qaeda leader "confirmed to me that the
man is in good health."</LD>
<LD>   There was no way to verify Atwan's information.</LD>
<TE>   U.S. officials say they have no evidence that Bin Laden was
wounded but acknowledge it is a possibility.</TE>
<TE>   Though the Bush administration has said publicly that it does not
know whether Bin Laden is alive or dead, U.S. counter-terrorism
officials privately concede that they believe he is alive.</TE>
<TE>   In Washington, Pentagon spokeswoman Victoria Clarke said she was
aware of the report, "but we don't have anything to add."</TE>
<TE>   Atwan described how Bin Laden was wounded.</TE>
<TE>   "It happened during the American carpet bombing of Tora Bora in
Afghanistan," the editor said by telephone. He said Bin Laden
underwent surgery to remove shrapnel from his left shoulder.</TE>

<HD>Mystery in Jungle of Papua</HD>
<DH>Slain independence leader Theys Eluay had a loyal
following--and a long list of potential enemies in the province.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD C. PADDOCK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>JAYAPURA, Indonesia</DL>
<LD>There are many reasons someone might have wanted to kill Theys Eluay.</LD>
<LD>   An imposing figure with his curly white beard and stout frame, the
charismatic tribal chief had a large following--and a dark past.</LD>
<LD>   He became the foremost independence leader of Indonesian Papua and
a hero to his people. But he also had once been a government
collaborator and military informant who may have played a part in
government-sponsored killing. He had ties to the powerful Indonesian
army and to organized crime. He had questionable dealings with timber
companies and cash to burn. He had nine wives and a huge ego. Most
recently, the government called him a traitor.</LD>
<TE>   He was last seen alive in November after leaving a lavish party at
an army base here. He was found dead the next morning in the back
seat of his deluxe Toyota van on a deserted jungle road.
Investigators concluded that he had been suffocated with a plastic
bag.</TE>
<TE>   It was a chillingly modern way to die here in Indonesian Papua, a
forbidding province of jungles and mountains where some tribes still
live a Stone Age existence.</TE>
<TE>   Eluay's death devastated the independence movement and caused an
outpouring of grief in Papua, which was known until recently as Irian
Jaya. The 64-year-old leader was beloved by many for his generosity,
his spontaneity, his habit of speaking his mind. Many called him
Bapak, an Indonesian word for sir or father.</TE>
<TE>   He was buried near his home in a field where children once played
soccer. Thousands of mourners came to the funeral, overflowing into
the street and climbing onto rooftops to watch. Many wept. His grave
is now a shrine, watched over day and night by loyal young followers.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   New Guinea, an island twice the size of California, lies just
south of the equator and north of Australia. Its dense, humid jungles
and snow-capped mountains are home to many tribes making the painful
leap to the modern world.</TE>
<TE>   The island is split between the country of Papua New Guinea, which
once was colonized by Britain and Australia, and the Indonesian
province of Papua, which once was ruled by the Dutch. The name Papua,
taken from the Malay word for curly-haired, was given to the people
of the island by explorers 500 years ago.</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't until 1938--a year after Eluay was born--that the
outside world discovered the Baliem Valley in the central highlands
of Papua, today a stronghold of the independence movement. There,
explorers found a primitive people whose way of life had survived
unchanged for thousands of years.</TE>
<TE>   Men wore nothing more than feathers in their hair and a koteka, a
long gourd to cover the penis. Women wore only grass skirts. Shells
were their money.</TE>
<TE>   Today, many still live in traditional thatched huts called honai,
sharing them with their pigs. They hunt with wooden spears and
arrows. They chew betel nut, staining the ground red where they spit
out the juice. Some men still wear kotekas and some women still
follow the tradition of cutting off a finger each time a loved one
dies.</TE>
<TE>   Even as many Papuans live in primitive conditions, they are
surrounded by riches. The territory, Indonesia's wealthiest province,
is home to an enormous gold and copper mine, U.S.-owned Freeport. In
the north, huge oil and gas reserves are under development by British
Petroleum. The island has the largest rain forest outside the Amazon,
and army officers have made fortunes shipping timber and sandalwood.</TE>
<TE>   "Why is the Papuan wealth being taken away to build Indonesia and
America?" Yefeth Yelemaken, chief of the Ngalik tribe, asked shortly
before he died last month at 45. "We are very angry because our
natural resources are taken out of Papua and then people ask why we
are so poor. We're like the mouse that died in a rice house."</TE>
<TE>   When Papua's chiefs declared independence from the Netherlands in
1961, Indonesia insisted it owned the territory. Fearing the rise of
communism in the region, Washington sided with Indonesia and pressed
the Dutch to pull out. The territory came under nominal U.N.
authority in 1963, but by then Indonesian troops had already moved in
and taken control on the ground.</TE>
<TE>   In 1965, when he was 27, Eluay became chief of the Sereh Sentani
tribe. In Jakarta, the Indonesian capital, Gen. Suharto seized power
and established a dictatorship that would last for years. But that
made little difference to West Papua--it was already under Indonesian
military rule.</TE>
<TE>   In 1969, the United Nations called a plebiscite to decide Papua's
fate but didn't grant each Papuan the right to vote.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, the Indonesian military chose 1,026 tribal leaders to
represent the populace. Soldiers held them under guard for weeks at
community halls and army barracks. Some were given gifts and
prostitutes. Some were threatened with death. In the end, they gave
their allegiance to Indonesia--many of them repeating a pledge of
loyalty in Indonesian, a language they didn't know.</TE>
<TE>   "The soldiers pointed a gun at them and told them to say they were
part of Indonesia," said Hubula chief Kayo Huby, whose father was one
of the 1,026. "People say they were forced to say the words, but
actually they didn't even understand what they were saying."</TE>
<TE>   The U.N. called the vote the "Act of Free Choice."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Eluay was 32 when he voted to join Indonesia. Unlike most chiefs,
he believed it was the best choice. He told friends he was "true red
and white," the colors of the Indonesian flag.</TE>
<TE>   He cooperated with the military and provided intelligence about
the resistance movement. Years later--when he was imprisoned on
charges of treason--he confessed to friends that he had given
authorities information that led to the death of independence
fighters.</TE>
<TE>   "I think he played quite a significant role as an informant," said
Thaha Alhamid, who became a close friend when the two were jailed
together. "He felt that he had played a role in state crime."</TE>
<TE>   In 1977, Eluay was rewarded with a seat in the provincial
parliament as a member of Suharto's ruling Golkar party. By then,
Indonesia had renamed the province Irian Jaya.</TE>
<TE>   While a new member of parliament, Eluay courted Yannieke Ohe. She
was 17 and he was 39.</TE>
<TE>   According to Papuan tradition, a chief can have as many wives as
he likes. In 1985, she became the ninth and most public of his wives.</TE>
<TE>   Eluay's transformation to Papuan hero began in the early 1990s.
Denied reappointment to parliament by his party after 15 years in
office, he became preoccupied with restoring his name. He saw that
his future lay in fighting for independence.</TE>
<TE>   Although he was closely tied to the government, he was one of the
few chiefs with the stature to unite Papua. His defection in the late
1990s gave the separatist movement a big boost.</TE>
<TE>   Under Indonesian rule, human rights activists say, the military
has killed at least 100,000 Papuans. Most feared of the army units is
Kopassus, short for Special Forces Command, widely believed to be
involved in the torture, killing and disappearance of civilians.</TE>
<TE>   The United States came under fire in the 1990s for training
Kopassus and publicly halted the program, but Pentagon documents show
that the U.S. secretly continued its training until 1999.</TE>
<TE>   The Asian economic crisis in 1997 and the resignation of Suharto
in May 1998 triggered new hope for democracy and self-determination
throughout Indonesia. From the Moluccas to Borneo to the northern tip
of Sumatra, separatist armies, religious militias and traditional
headhunters began waging war to assert control over their historic
lands, threatening the breakup of the country.</TE>
<TE>   Papuans' dream of freedom grew as they watched events unfold in
East Timor, 600 miles to the west. Indonesia forcibly annexed the
territory in 1975, but the new government agreed in 1999 to let East
Timor decide its future. When the province voted overwhelmingly for
independence, army-sponsored militia groups retaliated with a wave of
killing and destruction. Nevertheless, East Timor was free, and
Papuans saw the referendum as a precedent.</TE>
<TE>   In June 2000, Papuan leaders held a congress and reasserted their
independence. When it came time to select a leader, Eluay stood up
and proposed that he be named to the top post, chairman of the Papua
Presidium Council. The chiefs agreed.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The steep walls of the Baliem Valley narrow at the southern end,
and high above the valley floor is the village of Anjelma. As in
scores of other mountain villages nearby, the Dani tribespeople
subsist mainly on the sweet potatoes they grow in their terraced
gardens.</TE>
<TE>   "The Indonesian government has been here a long time, but as you
can see, our condition is just like dried fish," said chief Abner
Meage, sitting cross-legged on the floor of his hut as a pig grunted
in a corner.</TE>
<TE>   On Oct. 6, 2000, two Anjelma men were among the victims of a
shooting in Wamena, the valley's main town, one of the bloodiest
episodes the region has seen. Early that morning, police cut down a
flagpole flying the banned Morning Star flag, a revered symbol of
independence, then killed one man who tried to stop them and wounded
17 others.</TE>
<TE>   Word spread quickly and Dani men throughout the valley grabbed
their bows and spears and hurried to the town on foot. By midday,
1,000 warriors were arrayed against the police when gunmen opened
fire from nearby homes, killing six Papuans. Believing police had
ambushed them, angry tribesmen torched the houses and shot or speared
everyone who came out. They killed 46 people, mostly Muslim settlers
from other islands. No one was ever prosecuted for the killings, and
the conduct of the police was never investigated.</TE>
<TE>   Seven weeks later, Eluay was arrested on treason charges.
Indonesian authorities accused him of plotting Papua's violent
secession.</TE>
<TE>   In jail, he was diagnosed with a prostate ailment and sent to
Jakarta, where he had three operations and lost 65 pounds. He was
released in April 2001 but still faced trial. His attorney says the
government had a weak case and would never have won in court.</TE>
<TE>   Six months after he was freed, Kopassus soldiers began hanging
around Eluay's house in the town of Sentani. They arrived uninvited
and stayed for hours, playing with his children and eating the
family's food.</TE>
<TE>   Yannieke said she didn't like them there but that as a chief's
wife, she could not turn anyone away. Now she sees their presence as
part of the plot against her husband.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't know that behind their friendliness was cruelty," she
said. "Their job was to make friends, to see his habits and to
monitor him."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The provincial commander of Kopassus, Col. Hartomo, arrived at
Eluay's house on Nov. 10 with an early Christmas present.</TE>
<TE>   Hartomo, who, like many Indonesians, uses one name, also brought
an invitation to an Indonesian Heroes Day dinner that night at the
Hamadi army base in Jayapura, the Papuan capital. Eluay reluctantly
agreed to attend.</TE>
<TE>   Eluay arrived at the dinner in his van with tinted windows, a gift
from a local logging company. His regular driver, Aristoteles Masoka,
was behind the wheel.</TE>
<TE>   The party to honor Indonesian soldiers was still going on when
Eluay left a little before 10 p.m. The colonel walked him to his car.
As usual, Eluay rode in the front passenger seat.</TE>
<TE>   Within minutes, Eluay's van reached a winding, uphill stretch of
two-lane road. As the car rounded a curve, another Toyota van with
tinted windows overtook it, hit the front end and forced it to stop.</TE>
<TE>   Christian Maniagasi was riding his motorcycle to Jayapura when he
came across the two vans stopped in the road. At first it appeared
they'd had an accident. Then he saw three men, one with a gun, trying
to pull the driver from one of the vehicles.</TE>
<TE>   The driver tried to hang on to the vehicle but fell when he was
kicked from inside. It was Masoka.</TE>
<TE>   The road was busy that Saturday night, and other vehicles stopped.
Masoka got up, ran to one of the cars and jumped in. Isak, a
passenger in the car, knew Masoka, but the two didn't recognize each
other until the car was moving. "I saw a man with bruises and blood
on his mouth," Isak recalled. "He kept saying, 'Oh God, please help
my Bapak.' "</TE>
<TE>   Masoka asked to go immediately to the army base. Perhaps he
thought that Hartomo was unaware of the kidnapping and would save
Eluay. When Masoka arrived, he left the car without a word.</TE>
<TE>   Yeret Imowi, 27, was working at the party and remembers Masoka
walking in with two soldiers. Imowi heard him say that his car, with
his boss inside, had been taken.</TE>
<TE>   "If Bapak dies, what will I say to his family?" he asked. Masoka
took out his phone. One soldier knocked it to the ground and the
other kicked it away. No one has seen him since.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Within hours of Eluay's death, Hartomo called a news conference
and denied that Kopassus was involved. He promised to find the
killers, but as the facts emerged, his claim of innocence unraveled.
In April and May, military police arrested nine Kopassus officers and
soldiers in the slaying. Hartomo headed the list.</TE>
<TE>   A 10th Kopassus soldier was arrested after he allegedly tried to
shoot Imowi.</TE>
<TE>   Papua Police Chief Made M. Pastika said the evidence is strong.
"The indication is clear that the kidnapping and murder were done by
a group of people from the Kopassus headquarters in Hamadi," he said.</TE>
<TE>   What may never be known is who ordered Eluay's killing.</TE>
<TE>   The police examined whether Eluay might have been slain by
hard-line freedom fighters. They looked into his private life and
investigated two of his female friends. They tried to track his
money.</TE>
<TE>   Eluay always flew business class, the police chief said, and three
or four days a week checked into the prominent Matoa Hotel in
Jayapura, an hour from his home. He always paid cash. He often gave
the equivalent of $10 bills to boys and police officers around the
hotel, a big sum in Jayapura. "We think, 'What is his business?' "
Pastika said. "We don't know."</TE>
<TE>   Eluay received the van from the Djajanti Group, an Indonesian
timber company headed by Suharto's foster brother. Police suspect
that Eluay received cash from logging companies, but they have found
no evidence of illegal payoffs.</TE>
<TE>   Eluay's allies acknowledge that he had business ties to the army.
Companies connected to the military had to deal with him because he
was the top tribal chief. Sometimes the military called him in to
settle conflicts between loggers and local tribes.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, police found no indication that his killing was
triggered by a business deal gone bad.</TE>
<TE>   Many Eluay supporters believe he was assassinated by the
government under the orders of President Megawati Sukarnoputri to
crush Papua's growing separatist movement. Others suspect a military
plot that bypassed the normal chain of command, aiming to embarrass
the president and reassert army control over the province.</TE>
<TE>   Gen. Mahidin Simbolon, the army commander in Papua and Hartomo's
superior, said he didn't know who ordered Eluay's murder.</TE>
<TE>   "There was no order from the Indonesian military commander to me
to do that or from me to my soldiers to do the killing," he said. "I
also want to know who the mastermind is. The sooner the better."</TE>
<TE>   The suspects will be tried by a military tribunal. No date has
been set for a trial.</TE>
<TE>   Eluay's death left the independence movement in shock and
disarray. No strong leader has emerged to take his place.</TE>
<TE>   In January, Indonesia granted Papua autonomy, promising to give
the provincial government more authority and a greater share of
revenue. As further appeasement, Jakarta renamed the province Papua.</TE>
<TE>   But so far, the modest concessions have not weakened Papuans'
desire for independence, and many believe that autonomy is an empty
promise. Even if more money stays in the province, they say, it will
land in the pockets of Indonesian settlers, not indigenous Papuans.</TE>
<TE>   A few hundred separatist guerrillas fight on in the jungle, but
most chiefs recognize that Papuans have little chance of beating the
well-armed Indonesians. They advocate nonviolence and hope to
persuade the international community to reverse its decision granting
Papua to Indonesia.</TE>
<TE>   In Sentani, Yannieke Eluay often walks the short distance to her
husband's grave with its simple wooden cross.</TE>
<TE>   Now 42, she has curly black hair and a broad face. Her teeth are
discolored from chewing betel nut, and a lump of the stuff bulges in
her cheek. She wears a T-shirt with a picture of her dead husband and
the phrase in English: "Assassination of Theys Hiro Eluay, State
Crime in West Papua."</TE>
<TE>   She hopes his death will inspire the liberation movement and that
soon Papua will be free.</TE>
<TE>   "As the leader of Papua, he had the courage to speak about
independence, and that made people proud of him. Indonesia thought
that he would destroy the nation. What I saw was that he was trying
to build a nation. His death is like a great gift to the people to go
into the future, to be free of Indonesia."</TE>

<HD>Pearl's Killer Boasted of Bin Laden Ties</HD>
<DH>Pakistan: Details of the closed trial emerge as prosecutor
describes the words of Ahmad Omar Saeed Sheikh to interrogators.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL WATSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>KARACHI, Pakistan</DL>
<LD>Ahmad Omar Saeed Sheikh, the convicted mastermind in the murder of
journalist Daniel Pearl, boasted to Pakistani interrogators that he
had ties to Osama bin Laden and said the Al Qaeda leader hosted a
celebration for him and two other Islamic militants in the Afghan
capital in 2000.</LD>
<LD>   Sheikh told a team of five interrogators from different agencies
that Bin Laden hosted an iftar party to mark the end of the Muslim
holy month of Ramadan shortly after he was freed from an Indian jail
in December 1999, prosecutor Raja Qureshi said in an interview
Monday.</LD>
<LD>   The party also honored Sheikh, his then-leader Maulana Masood
Azhar, and Mushtaq Zargat, a Kashmiri militant, Sheikh said. All
three men had just been released from Indian prisons in a deal to
free hostages on a hijacked Indian jet.</LD>
<TE>   "When he was being interrogated, these were the utterances and
admissions made by him, as recorded by the police officers," the
prosecutor said. "He was proud of it."</TE>
<TE>   Qureshi said he did not know whether Sheikh was working with Bin
Laden's network after the Sept. 11 attacks. But Sheikh is a leader of
Azhar's Jaish-e-Mohammed, a militant group fighting Indian rule in
the Himalayan region of Kashmir. Authorities suspect the group is
linked to Al Qaeda.</TE>
<TE>   Sheikh, 28, a Briton of Pakistani descent who once studied at the
London School of Economics, showed only "a poker face" when he was
convicted and sentenced to death Monday in a closed courtroom in the
city of Hyderabad, Qureshi said. Three other men were also found
guilty and given life sentences.</TE>
<TE>   But after Sheikh was led away, his relatives shouted abuse at the
prosecutor, who said he receives frequent death threats and is under
police guard. And Sheikh issued a thinly veiled threat after the
verdict, apparently aimed at Pakistani President Pervez Musharraf.</TE>
<TE>   "Musharraf should know that the almighty Allah is there, and he
can get revenge," Sheikh said in a statement read to reporters in
English by his lawyer, Rai Bashir. "We shall see who shall die first,
either I or the authorities who have arranged the death sentence for
me."</TE>
<TE>   Sheikh added that "now the jihad between Islam and kafirs
[non-believers] is going on, and everybody is showing himself,
whether he is in favor of Islam or he is in favor of kafirs."</TE>
<TE>   Bashir called the guilty verdict "a judgment just to please
Americans--nothing else and nothing more," and said he will appeal.</TE>
<TE>   Judge Syed Ali Ashraf Shah sentenced Sheikh's three accomplices,
Salman Saquib, Fahad Naseem and Sheikh Mohammed Adeel, to life in
prison, which is a maximum of 25 years in Pakistan. They also plan to
appeal.</TE>
<TE>   The Pearl family, in a statement posted on its Web site, said it
was "grateful for the tireless efforts" by U.S. and Pakistani
authorities "to bring those guilty of Danny's kidnapping and murder
to justice."</TE>
<TE>   Pakistani police are still searching for seven other suspects in
Pearl's kidnapping-murder, and there are fears here that those still
at large may try to carry out more attacks on Westerners in revenge
for Monday's verdict.</TE>
<TE>   Defense lawyers have seven days to file an appeal in Sindh
province's High Court and later could challenge that court's ruling
in Pakistan's Supreme Court. Sheikh's father, a wealthy accountant
living in London, angrily claimed his son had been framed.</TE>
<TE>   But Qureshi said he is confident that Sheikh will eventually be
hanged. The prosecutor added that he believes higher courts won't
allow the appeals to drag on because Sheikh and his accomplices are
now convicted terrorists, whom the judge declared a domestic and
international threat.</TE>
<TE>   Because the trial was closed to the public and held inside a jail,
journalists have relied on briefings from the prosecutor and defense
lawyers for details.</TE>
<TE>   The interview with Qureshi, as well as the court's 54-page ruling,
provided more evidence of what the judge concluded was Sheikh's plot
to kidnap Pearl, who had been investigating alleged "shoe bomber"
Richard C. Reid. Reid was arrested in the U.S. in December and
charged with trying to set off explosives in his sneakers on a flight
from Paris to Miami.</TE>
<TE>   Pearl, who had been South Asia bureau chief for the Wall Street
Journal, wanted to interview Sheik Mubarak Ali Shah Gilani, a Muslim
cleric who once hosted Reid at his home in Lahore, Qureshi said.</TE>
<TE>   Asif Mahfooz Farooqi, a Pakistani journalist who had assisted
Pearl's predecessor from the Journal's South Asia bureau, agreed on
Dec. 22, 2001, to help Pearl meet Gilani, the judge wrote in his
ruling.</TE>
<TE>   Farooqi testified that he had asked 15 or 16 people and found only
one who said he could arrange a meeting with the cleric, the
prosecutor said.</TE>
<TE>   Farooqi accompanied Pearl to a meeting Jan. 11, in Room 411 of the
Akbar International Hotel in Rawalpindi, a suburb of Pakistan's
capital, Islamabad, and that is where the conspiracy to kidnap Pearl
was hatched, the judge concluded.</TE>
<TE>   Sheikh was one of two other men in the room, but he used an alias
and claimed he was one of Gilani's followers. A man identified as
Arif, alias Hashim, was with Sheikh at the meeting, but police are
still searching for him. Farooqi was not involved in the conspiracy,
investigators concluded.</TE>
<TE>   Hotel desk clerk Amir Afzal Qureshi identified Sheikh as the man
who rented the room--under a different name. He also picked Sheikh
out from a police lineup, the judge wrote. Investigators also found a
receipt for the room in Sheikh's possession, and it was entered as
evidence in the trial.</TE>
<TE>   Using the name Bashir, Sheikh told Pearl to go to Karachi for the
interview with Gilani. By tracing calls to Pearl's cell phone, police
established that Sheikh called Pearl half an hour before the two met
outside Karachi's Village Garden restaurant at 7 p.m. on Jan. 23, the
night Pearl disappeared.</TE>
<TE>   "Sheikh got out of a white Corolla in front of [Pearl's] taxi,
came and shook hands with Daniel Pearl, and made him sit in the back
seat of the car, and it drove away," the prosecutor said, citing
testimony from the taxi driver who brought Pearl to the rendezvous
point.</TE>
<TE>   Ronald Joseph, an agent with the FBI, testified that he examined
the hard drive of defendant Fahad Naseem's laptop computer and
concluded it was the source of two e-mails showing Pearl in
captivity.</TE>
<TE>   Police also found the originals of the e-mailed ransom notes,
handwritten in Urdu and English, in Naseem's home. An expert
testified that the handwriting matched Sheikh's and Adeel's, the
judge wrote.</TE>
<TE>   Qureshi, the prosecutor, said he still has not received the
results of DNA tests being performed on severed body parts discovered
in May just outside Karachi. If the tests fail to prove the remains
are Pearl's, that won't affect Monday's verdict, the prosecutor
insisted. Other evidence prove Sheikh's involvement in the murder,
Qureshi said.</TE>
<TE>   The day in February on which Pearl's murderers chose to send the
videotaped evidence of his death to the U.S. Consulate in Karachi

torturous," the prosecutor added.</TE>

sacrifice, which commemorates Abraham's willingness to sacrifice his
son, Ishmael, after receiving a command from God.</TE>
<TE>   "Muslims slaughter their goats and cows on Eid al-Adha," Qureshi
said. "The message being conveyed was that now Muslims were
slaughtering a Jew. This is a naked insult to humanity."</TE>

<DL>SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina</DL>
<LD>The presidents of Yugoslavia, Bosnia-Herzegovina and Croatia held a
landmark summit in Sarajevo on Monday and pledged to rebuild peace,
trust and trade among three states riven by the Balkan wars.</LD>
<LD>   But there was also a note of lingering discord as Yugoslav
President Vojislav Kostunica declined to apologize for Serb
atrocities, or to call on former Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic
to surrender to a U.N. war crimes tribunal.</LD>
<LD>   Monday's summit, the first of its kind since the wars of the
1990s, was held in the bullet-scarred Old Town of Sarajevo, whose
siege by Bosnian Serb forces encapsulated the mass bloodshed and
ethnic strife of that era.</LD>
<TE>   The leaders, none of whom were in office during the war, promised
to respect one another's borders, cooperate to boost trade and fight
crime, and to repatriate refugees.</TE>

<HD>U.S., Allies Disagree on How to Treat Arafat</HD>
<DH>Talks: In meetings this week, Washington will stress the
Palestinian's limitations as a leader.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBIN WRIGHT and MARY CURTIUS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The showdown between George W. Bush and Yasser Arafat over the future
of the Palestinian Authority faces its first test this week in talks
involving the United States and the Arab, European and U.N. players
in the Middle East peace process.</LD>
<LD>   So far, it's shaping up as the United States against everyone else
at the table.</LD>
<LD>   Most U.S. allies stand defiantly behind Arafat, even while
conceding the need for reforms to open up the Palestinian political
system, clean up finances and streamline security forces.</LD>
<TE>   In talks today in New York and Thursday in Washington, Secretary
of State Colin L. Powell will have a "very hard sell" generating
support for the risky new U.S. goal of replacing the Palestinian
Authority president, conceded a Bush administration official who
requested anonymity.</TE>
<TE>   "No one wants to attend dinner with Powell where the main course
served up is Arafat's head," the official said.</TE>
<TE>   The Arab world, represented by the Egyptian, Jordanian and Saudi
foreign ministers, plans to counter with its own two-year proposal to
establish a Palestinian state, according to Arab diplomats.</TE>
<TE>   And in what has become a common refrain among Europeans, the
Russian and French foreign ministers jointly endorsed Arafat after
talks in Moscow last week. "He was elected," said French Foreign
Minister Dominique de Villepin. "The Palestinian people should make
the decision" about who represents them.</TE>
<TE>   To get around the impasse, U.S. strategy now centers on persuading
allies to recognize Arafat's limitations, while temporarily ignoring
the specifics of his fate to focus on broader reforms.</TE>
<TE>   To the surprise of many both inside and outside the
region--including officials involved in crafting President Bush's
controversial June 24 speech, in which he called for new leadership
in the Palestinian Authority--some pieces have begun to fall into
place.</TE>
<TE>   "There are a few signs that we're beginning to see what we want to
see," said a senior State Department official who requested
anonymity.</TE>
<TE>   Palestinian Reforms</TE>
<TE>   Within the Palestinian Authority, a new 100-day plan addresses
some of the reforms pushed by the United States: A new finance
minister is pledging to deal with corruption. And Palestinians
outside the government are beginning to challenge the leadership and
its political practices.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody is talking about reform and change," said Ziad abu Amr,
a political scientist and member of the Palestinian Legislative
Council from the Gaza Strip.</TE>
<TE>   In Israel, Prime Minister Ariel Sharon has responded to pressure
from both the Bush administration and his own defense establishment
with steps to ease the impact of Israel's reoccupation of much of the
West Bank.</TE>
<TE>   The government established a committee to facilitate the
day-to-day existence for a population now largely confined to their
homes. Working under Foreign Minister Shimon Peres, the committee is
authorized to discuss economic and humanitarian issues with
Palestinians. In addition, the army reportedly soon intends to pull
out of some cities and reduce the number of troops in others.</TE>
<TE>   "To be blunt, instead of being in a coma because of the Bush
Middle East speech, and saying that it put all the responsibility on
the Palestinians, Israel has decided that we should initiate,'' said
Noam Katz, a deputy spokesman for the Foreign Ministry.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush strategy is based heavily on forcing each side to take
steps in its own interest. And at least in the opening weeks, that is
what has begun to happen, if tentatively.</TE>
<TE>   Within Israel, the military's concern about radicalizing wide
swaths of the Palestinian population was the motive for easing some
restrictions.</TE>
<TE>   The new chief of staff, Lt. Gen. Moshe Yaalon, said last week that
Israel must not turn Palestinian civilians into enemies and should
ensure that they can bring bread home to their families.</TE>
<TE>   Yaalon also opposed deporting Arafat, arguing that it would only
give the Palestinian leader a new lease on power. Yaalon's
predecessor had urged Sharon to expel Arafat.</TE>
<TE>   And Arafat, after long resisting calls for change, has shaken up
his Cabinet, fired two security chiefs and unveiled a plan to
restructure key ministries.</TE>
<TE>   In a move that surprised U.S. officials, he even wrote Powell a
long letter last week outlining his program and asking for U.S. help
with additional steps.</TE>
<TE>   Powell said Friday that his staff was reviewing the letter,
although he said he has no plans to personally reply.</TE>
<TE>   Yet U.S. allies, including officials Powell will meet this week,
still seriously question whether the Bush administration can create
enough momentum to change the realities on the ground--or overcome
hostilities so that the peace process has another shot.</TE>
<TE>   So far, steps by both sides are of limited consequence.</TE>
<TE>   Palestinians admit that reforms are flagging. Creation of a
Palestinian state is still hobbled by "the lack of a rule of law, the
lack of a separation of powers and the lack of legitimacy for the
ruling elites," said Abu Amr, the Palestinian legislator. "I haven't
seen real change--just more of the same in a modified way. What we
want are attributes of a real democratic system.''</TE>
<TE>   The government shake-up hasn't done much either. "Arafat is in an
extremely odd position," Abu Amr said. "He now presides over a
Cabinet which includes both proponents for change and those accused
of corruption and incompetence. I don't think he is going to lead a
revolution for reform."</TE>
<TE>   Israel is also moving slowly. Sharon rejected Peres' request to
let 30,000 Palestinian workers return to jobs inside Israel,
authorizing a more modest 5,000. And so far the prime minister has
not released tens of millions of dollars in taxes Israel collected
for the Palestinian Authority but impounded after fighting erupted in
September 2000.</TE>
<TE>   "Let's not be deceived by window dressing," said Sharon spokesman
Raanan Gissin. "The immediate, most important thing is fighting
terrorism, and there is no lack of motivation to attack us."</TE>
<TE>   Talks last week between Peres and the Palestinians--including the
new finance and interior ministers--also produced little.</TE>
<TE>   Palestinian Minister of Culture and Information Yasser Abed-Rabbo
ridiculed the meetings in an interview with Israeli television.
"Nothing serious was discussed," he said. "Peres came with empty
hands. He was not able to discuss in depth any of the issues that are
substantial to the Palestinian side," such as troop withdrawals.</TE>
<TE>   A second round of talks scheduled for Saturday was postponed at
the last minute.</TE>
<TE>   Power Quartet to Meet</TE>
<TE>   To spur the process, Powell will focus on how to promote reforms
when he meets today with envoys from the so-called quartet--the
United States, Russia, the European Union and the United
Nations--that began overseeing the peace process in April. The group
will later be joined by the Jordanian and Egyptian foreign ministers.</TE>
<TE>   As an initial step, Deputy Assistant Secretary of State Elizabeth
Cheney orchestrated the creation in London last week of an
international task force that includes the quartet plus the World
Bank, the International Monetary Fund, Japan and Norway--the last for
its role in the 1993 Oslo accords that launched the now-crippled
peace process.</TE>
<TE>   The task force will focus on getting resources to groups outside
the current Palestinian Authority leadership to create new
institutions and reform. Powell and the quartet will work on a
comprehensive action plan, including specific tasks, standards and
benchmarks for reform, administration officials say.</TE>
<TE>   "The work is moving apace. It's not yet a finished plan, but we
are getting respectably close to that point. It's this effort that
the quartet principals will bless as the way to support reform," said
a senior administration official who requested anonymity.</TE>
<TE>   The task force will then meet on a regular basis, with subgroups
focusing on specific areas such as elections, an independent
judiciary and financial accountability. Cheney, daughter of Vice
President Dick Cheney, will oversee this effort for the United
States.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike other nascent states before independence, the Palestinian
Authority is not the responsibility or mandate of any other nation or
international institution, so the task force would play part of that
role, U.S. officials say.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, Bush and Powell will meet with the Saudi, Egyptian
and Jordanian foreign ministers in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   "It is not a secret that the Bush speech had positive and negative
points, but we want to maximize the positive points and inquire about
the points that require clarification," said Egyptian Foreign
Minister Ahmed Maher. The Arabs also want to "explain our stance on
the negative points."</TE>
<TE>   Despite the hurdles in winning over allies and the sizable
political, economic and security challenges in the region, Bush
administration officials claim to be optimistic.</TE>
<TE>   The United States has "a lot of faith" in the Palestinian people's
ability to take control of their own lives and institute change,
National Security Advisor Condoleezza Rice told Israeli television
last week.</TE>
<TE>   "If all of this goes well, we could be talking about matters of
months and not too many years until we could see an end to the
conflict in the Middle East," she said.</TE>

Gaza Strip. Times staff writer Michael Slackman in Cairo contributed

<HD>Investors Not Easily Reassured</HD>
<DH>Wall Street: The day's wild swings cast doubt on U.S.
leaders' ability to influence markets.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PETER G. GOSSELIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>U.S. stocks gyrated wildly again Monday, extending a slide that
threatens to stall growth and exposing the limits of American
leaders' ability to affect the course of economic events.</LD>
<LD>   Edgy investors barely noticed President Bush's second attempt in
as many weeks to accent the economic positive as they drove down the
Dow Jones industrial average more than 400 points before erasing all
but 45 points of those losses in the final 90 minutes of trading.</LD>
<LD>   Bush told a Birmingham, Ala., audience that the nation is on the
economic rebound. "In spite of the fact that we've been in a slump
for a while ... the economy is coming back. That's a fact," he said.</LD>
<TE>   The president's outlook undoubtedly will be seconded today when
Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan gives Congress his semiannual
assessment of the economy.</TE>
<TE>   But a variety of analysts said neither man has much power to
convince investors, concerned consumers and stubbornly pessimistic
executives.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the story of a bubble; what went up in the late 1990s is
coming back down," said David M. Jones, a Denver economic consultant
and longtime Fed watcher. "Bush couldn't do much about it, and
Greenspan isn't going to be able to change the trajectory either."</TE>
<TE>   What in effect has happened, according to analysts, is that the
steady drumbeat of accounting scandals and revelations of executive
self-dealing has caused doubts that initially were confined to the
dot-com and telecom worlds to spread to virtually all of corporate
America.</TE>
<TE>   "People don't know what to believe about any company at this
point," said Jason Trennert, a managing director with ISI Group, a
New York investment strategy firm. "Until they know where all the
bodies are buried, it's going to be a very tough market."</TE>
<TE>   The spread of doubts has come at a particularly unfortunate
moment--just as the ability of policymakers such as Bush and
Greenspan to do much about them has been greatly diminished.</TE>
<TE>   In the president's case, the problems include the sudden
reemergence of multibillion-dollar budget deficits after years of
surplus, and what both Democratic and Republican critics charge is
the White House's use of accounting gimmicks to keep the numbers from
appearing even larger.</TE>
<TE>   "For the businesspeople running the administration, this has got
to be a nightmare," said University of Wisconsin political scientist
Charles O. Jones.</TE>
<TE>   In the Fed chairman's case, the problem is twofold. The Fed
already has cut short-term interest rates to a four-decade low in a
move that has thrilled home and car buyers but failed to rekindle
crucial business investment. Also, Greenspan has steadfastly said he
doesn't have the right or the power to influence the very thing that
most worries many people at the moment, the tumbling stock market.</TE>
<TE>   Dollar Continues to Fall</TE>
<TE>   Given these circumstances, analysts predicted, the central banker
will spend most of today arguing that the nation's real economy,
which produces goods and services, is growing again, and that the
effects of falling stock prices will remain confined to a small slice
of the public at the very top of the nation's income pile.</TE>
<TE>   "I wouldn't mind if he said something to cheer people up, but I
wouldn't bet on it," said Bennet T. McCallum, an economist at
Carnegie-Mellon University in Pittsburgh and a member of the Shadow
Open Market Committee, a group of private analysts who follow the Fed
closely. He certainly won't do it by promising more interest rate
cuts, McCallum added.</TE>
<TE>   Monday's bad news went well beyond bouncing stock indexes. The
value of the dollar continued its fall against other currencies,
signaling that foreign investors, who have been big buyers of U.S.
stocks in recent years, are taking their money elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   The dollar fell below the euro, the European currency, for the
first time in 2 1/2 years and slipped as well against the Japanese
yen. Its value has declined almost 15% since February after rising
steadily since the mid-1990s.</TE>
<TE>   "All these corporate scandals have hurt our reputation. [Foreign
investors] don't know where the next shoe is going to drop and
they're not waiting to find out," said Morris Goldstein, a senior
fellow with the Institute for International Economics, a Washington
think tank.</TE>
<TE>   The Dow, already down about 150 points when Bush began speaking,
dropped an additional 40-plus points but then bounced back. However,
hours after the president's speech, the index headed back down with a
vengeance, plummeting almost 440 points to within a hair's breadth of
its lows in the aftermath of the Sept. 11 attacks before snapping
back to close down 45.34 points, or 0.5%, at 8,639.19.</TE>
<TE>   The broader Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index traced a similar path,
plunging below the 900 mark for the first time since the fall of 1997
before coming back to close down 3.46 points, or 0.4%, at 917.93. The
tech-heavy Nasdaq composite index actually ended the day up 9.12
points, or 0.7%, at 1,382.62. Nasdaq last week fell to a five-year
low.</TE>
<TE>   Senate Passes Reforms</TE>
<TE>   Monday's wild swings followed six weeks of tumbling stock prices
that market players attributed almost entirely to corporate scandals
and that have produced loud calls for reform.</TE>
<TE>   Two of the proposed reforms--to establish an independent board to
regulate accountants and impose new criminal penalties on executives
who cheat investors and employees--zipped through the Senate late
Monday on a surprising unanimous vote.</TE>
<TE>   They now must be reconciled with less stringent House measures.</TE>
<TE>   But most analysts are not waiting for the panel to end the
market's fall. They think a Securities and Exchange Commission order
that top executives of the nation's 1,000 largest public companies
personally vouch for their firms' financial figures by Aug. 14 will
flush out any further problems.</TE>
<TE>   "Then investors will know what they're dealing with," investment
strategist Trennert said.</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, analysts said, business and government leaders
will seek to reassure the public with an argument that would have
seemed heresy only a few years ago, namely that whatever the stock
market does is of little consequence to the economy.</TE>
<TE>   Main Street Issues</TE>
<TE>   Greenspan in particular has pushed this point in recent public
appearances and is likely to do so again today before the Senate
Banking Committee.</TE>
<TE>   Greenspan will rely heavily on Fed research reports that appear to
contradict widespread claims during the 1990s that Wall Street and
Main Street were merging as even average Americans became stock
investors to provide for their retirements.</TE>
<TE>   The studies conclude that the share of stocks, bonds and mutual
funds held by the wealthiest fifth of American families barely budged
during the decade, but instead remained in the fantastically high
range of 70% to 80%.</TE>
<TE>   The implication Greenspan draws is that the only people hurt by
falling share prices are the rich who can afford it. The remaining
80% of Americans, most of whom have their wealth tied up in their
homes, whose values have continued to rise, can keep on buying and
propping up the economy in the process.</TE>
<TE>   But former Fed economist Dean M. Maki, the studies' coauthor,
suggested Monday that the conclusion may be unwarranted. Maki said
that although stock holdings of the vast majority of Americans pale
beside those of the wealthy minority, they play a crucial role in
their finances.</TE>
<TE>   "Less wealthy people appear to be a little more sensitive to
changes in the value of their securities holdings than wealthier
ones," said Maki, now an economist with Putnam Investments, a Boston
mutual fund firm.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not expecting [the recent stock market fall] to cause the
economy to slip back into recession," he said. "But it is a force of
weakness, and it could combine with other forces to put us back into
recession."</TE>
<TE>   Maki's conclusions square with those of political pollsters, who
find growing economic worries and outrage over corporate scandals at
all income levels.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of people may have more hope than money invested in the
stock market," said Democratic pollster Mark Mellman. "But hope
counts mightily in politics because, for many people, it's their hope
for a comfortable retirement that's at stake."</TE>

<HD>Navy Use of Sonar OKd Despite Risk to Whales</HD>
<DH>Military: Some scientists say safety features in the
submarine-detection system aren't enough.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Bush administration on Monday gave the Navy permission to
"harass" and potentially injure whales, if necessary, in conducting
exercises with a powerful new sonar to hunt for super-quiet
submarines.</LD>
<LD>   The Navy asserts that no whales will be killed by the intense
underwater noise because of elaborate safety precautions. But
scientists and environmentalists worry that marine mammals,
especially those that slip undetected into the safety zone around the
sonar equipment, could suffer life-threatening injuries.</LD>
<LD>   Navy officials say the sonar system is needed to protect U.S.
warships--particularly aircraft carriers--from a new breed of diesel
submarines. Advances in stealth technology by German, French, Swedish
and Russian manufacturers have led to submarines that can barely be
heard, officials said.</LD>
<TE>   In granting the go-ahead, the National Marine Fisheries Service of
the Commerce Department agreed to exempt the low-frequency sonar
system from the Marine Mammal Protection Act after determining that
it would have a "negligible impact" on any species.</TE>
<TE>   The decision came after years of internal debate and a startling
study that blamed another Navy sonar system for inner-ear bleeding,
other injuries and disorientation that drove 16 whales to beach
themselves in the Bahamas. Scientists are not sure whether most or
all of the whales died.</TE>
<TE>   To prevent injury to whales or dolphins, the Fisheries Service is
requiring the Navy to stay at least 12 miles offshore when operating
at full volume, and to take other precautions to make sure no
protected sea creatures come in harm's way.</TE>
<TE>   "The Navy has to shut down the system if any marine mammals or
turtles are detected within two kilometers," said Rebecca Lent,
deputy assistant administrator for national marine fisheries. The
goal, she said, "is to make sure the marine mammals are protected to
the greatest extent feasible."</TE>
<TE>   Other safety precautions include avoiding areas frequented by
scuba divers, who can also be hurt, restricting the sonar's frequency
to minimize potential damage to the ears and tissue of whales and
avoiding well-known whale feeding and breeding areas around
Antarctica, Hawaii and Costa Rica.</TE>
<TE>   Some scientists and environmentalists were troubled by Monday's
approval, contending that the science is too sketchy for predicting
whether the mitigation measures will actually work.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a case of painting the toenails of the elephant," said Joel
Reynolds, a senior attorney with the Natural Resources Defense
Council. "You still have the elephant: a very, very loud system
operating on a global scale with very little environmental
oversight."</TE>
<TE>   Reynolds, who has sued the Navy over related sonar issues, is
considering a lawsuit to stop the use of low-frequency sonar.</TE>
<TE>   The Navy issued a statement that it was "pleased" with the ruling.
For years, the Navy has sought the flexibility to move closer to
shore with its low-frequency sonar, initially conceived during the
Cold War to hunt for Soviet submarines in the deep ocean.</TE>
<TE>   "The technological advantage that we had in the Cold War has
diminished," said Jim Kadane, program director for intelligence,
surveillance and reconnaissance in the San Diego office of the Space
and Naval Warfare Systems Command.</TE>
<TE>   Third World countries, unable to afford aircraft carriers and
fighter-planes, have been buying submarines capable of sinking U.S.
ships. "The submarine, more and more, is the weapon of choice" for
the Third World, Kadane said.</TE>
<TE>   So far, the Navy has only one ship equipped with the low-frequency
array. It plans to resume exercises this fall in the Western Pacific
"thousands of miles from California," said Joe Johnson, program
manager for the Navy's environmental review. He declined to pinpoint
the location, saying it could compromise national security.</TE>
<TE>   For now, the Navy cannot operate the low-frequency sonar off
California because it has not yet passed muster with the California
Coastal Commission.</TE>
<TE>   The Navy has received clearance from 23 other coastal states, a
spokesman said, but has not yet sought approval from California's
commission, arguably the toughest environmental hurdle, until it
completes its operational plans.</TE>
<TE>   The sonar system, called the Surveillance Towed Array Sensor
System, consists of 18 speakers pulled behind a Navy ship on cables
hundreds feet long. The speakers can emit low-frequency waves up to
230 decibels. That would be roughly like standing next to a jumbo jet
at takeoff. Such active sonar can be compared to a floodlight,
sending a sound wave burst to "light up" enemy submarines with an
echo.</TE>
<TE>   Low-frequency waves travel great distances in the ocean before
stopping and are far more effective at spotting submarines than
passive listening devices.</TE>
<TE>   Their power and reach is precisely what concerns many whale and
acoustic experts, who have spent the last two years investigating the
whale deaths in the Bahamas in March 2000.</TE>
<TE>   The Navy, which took responsibility for the deaths after initially
denying it, attributes them to mid-frequency sonar, a different
system that officials say cannot be compared with the low-frequency
sonar approved Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson, the Navy's environmental review manager, said he is
"confident that there is minimal chance of physiological damage to
the whales. As far as harassment, we know we can minimize that, so
there is no impact on the [whale] population."</TE>
<TE>   But the experts are not so sure.</TE>
<TE>   Ken Balcom, director of the Center for Whale Research in
Washington state's Friday Harbor, predicts "more whales are going to
die."</TE>
<TE>   He points out that both kinds of sonar were being tested off the
coast of Greece in 1996 when a mass die-off of whales occurred. The
exact cause of the fatalities could not be confirmed because tissue
samples from the dead animals were not preserved.</TE>
<TE>   However, Balcom did preserve tissue samples when beaked whales
began washing ashore near his Bahamian research station two years
ago. After trying to save a few, he cut off the heads of dead whales
and persuaded a restaurant to put them in a freezer until they could
be airlifted to Harvard Medical School for CT scans.</TE>
<TE>   Research concluded that bursts of loud sound had caused a
"resonance phenomenon" in the air cavities of the whales' heads.
Scientists concluded that sound vibrations were, in effect, tearing
apart delicate tissues around the brain and ears, causing them to
hemorrhage.</TE>
<TE>   Balcom said the government's decision to allow the Navy to use the
sonar was not based on facts. He said the effects of sonar are not
yet well enough understood and that injury may not be tied to
frequency as much as loudness.</TE>
<TE>   "It's pressure," he said. "Sound is traveling as a pressure wave"
as it moves through water.</TE>
<TE>   Since the Navy proposed using the sonar, more than 10,000 letters
flooded the National Marine Fisheries Service raising concerns about
the welfare of whales.</TE>
<TE>   To comply with its permit, the Navy must do research on the
sonar's effects on whale behavior. It must also submit quarterly
reports to the Fisheries Service, but those reports will remain
classified.</TE>
<TE>   The approval granted by the Fisheries Service will be reviewed
annually and will expire after five years. It is specifically for
sonar testing and exercises during peacetime. No approval or
precautions are needed during wartime, or during "heightened threat."</TE>

<LD>A Michigan man who claimed that anger over the Sept. 11 attacks
helped prompt his killing of an Arab American man was sentenced to
life in prison for first-degree murder.</LD>
<LD>   Brent David Seever, 38, shot and killed Ali Almansoop, a
44-year-old native of Yemen, on Sept. 19 after chasing him out of his
former girlfriend's home in a Detroit suburb.</LD>
<LD>   Seever claimed at the time that he shot Almansoop in the back of
the head and the lower back partly because he was enraged by the
terrorist attacks.</LD>
<TE>   But a Wayne County jury found Seever guilty of first-degree felony
murder last month, after learning that he had been stalking his
ex-girlfriend and was angered by her relationship with Almansoop,
authorities said.</TE>

<HD>Economy is Bouncing Back, Bush Says</HD>
<DH>Speech: Despite a wild day on Wall Street, he says several
signs point to a rebound 'right around the corner.' Democratic
critics say otherwise.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EDWIN CHEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BIRMINGHAM, Ala.</DL>
<LD>President Bush declared Monday that the U.S. economy is
"fundamentally strong" and is poised for growth, his latest response
to public worries spawned by corporate scandals and slumping
financial markets.</LD>
<LD>   "There is a better day--right around the corner for all
Americans," Bush told several hundred people who filled the
Performing Arts Center at the University of Alabama's Birmingham
campus. "I'm very optimistic about our economy."</LD>
<LD>   He recited a list of indicators to justify his position, such as a
low inflation rate, reasonable interest rates, rising productivity,
relatively strong retail sales and what Bush termed his
administration's sound monetary policy.</LD>
<TE>   Wall Street, though, provided ample evidence of the jittery
economic mood, as the Dow Jones industrial average plunged by more
than 400 points Monday before rallying late in the session to post
only a modest decline.</TE>
<TE>   The market's erratic day also fueled the increasingly insistent
argument by Democrats that Bush is failing to adequately respond to
economic instability and insecurity.</TE>
<TE>   "He's never really demonstrated in these speeches a grasp of the
reality of the situation," said Sen. Jack Reed (D-R.I.), chairman of
Congress' Joint Economic Committee. "All you're getting is the
hortatory expressions that everything is fine."</TE>
<TE>   Bush referred to the market gyrations as a result of "the economic
binge we just went through" in the 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   "There was endless profit, there was no tomorrow when it came to
... the stock markets and corporate profits," Bush said. "And now
we're suffering a hangover for that binge."</TE>
<TE>   White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer, in comments to
reporters, also sought to cast the volatile markets as an aberration
rather than a sign of long-term problems.</TE>
<TE>   "After large periods of growth come corrections--that's part of
the private cycle of the market. People have seen that come and go
before," Fleischer said. "Markets take care of themselves."</TE>
<TE>   Last week, the Dow dropped by almost 700 points.</TE>
<TE>   And concern within the White House clearly is growing about the
potential political fallout of the shaky economic picture. Bush now
plans to devote much of his summer to the issue, focusing on it
during several events and trips even as he vacations in August at his
Texas ranch.</TE>
<TE>   In striking an upbeat note Monday, Bush broke no new policy
ground. Instead, he stressed what Fleischer called "the strength of
the economy" and the administration's efforts "to keep the economy
moving in the right direction."</TE>
<TE>   Said Bush: "This economy ... has got foundations for growth so the
people who want to find work can find work, so that the entrepreneurs
in America can flourish."</TE>
<TE>   Serving as a backdrop for the president's speech was a huge
red-white-and-blue collage bearing the phrase "Strengthening Our
Economy" 34 times.</TE>
<TE>   His speech followed by just six days his much-publicized address
on Wall Street concerning the series of bookkeeping scandals that
have rocked corporate America. Bush spoke out strongly against
corporate fraud, but the speech was widely panned because he proposed
few policy initiatives to crack down on such behavior.</TE>
<TE>   Democrats continued those attacks Monday. Said party national
Chairman Terry McAuliffe: "Let's face it, President Bush cannot solve
this crisis of confidence by giving the markets a pep talk. It's
going to take real economic leadership--leadership that has been
sorely lacking to date."</TE>
<TE>   Bush on Monday acknowledged that greater consumer and investor
confidence is a vital ingredient to economic recovery--and that it
could use a boost.</TE>
<TE>   He pledged "to continue to work in Washington to build confidence,
to build ... the strong foundations for economic vitality that exist,
to build on the good statistics we're beginning to see."</TE>
<TE>   Another part of this confidence-building effort, he said, is to
ensure "the highest ethical standards in corporate America."</TE>
<TE>   Striking much the tone that marked his Wall Street speech, Bush
said: "It is important for corporate America to hear this call ... in
order to be a responsible American, you must behave responsibly. We
expect there to be full disclosure of assets and liabilities. We
expect there to be fair accounting practices. We expect you to treat
your investors and employees with the respect they deserve. And if
not, we intend to do something about it at the federal level."</TE>
<TE>   After reciting the proposals he outlined last week, the president
called on Congress to deliver to him by its August recess the
accounting reform legislation that passed the Senate on Monday. That
bill must now be reconciled with a less stringent version the House
approved.</TE>
<TE>   Bush also reiterated his conviction that the vast majority of
business executives are morally upright citizens. "A few have damaged
the reputation of the many," Bush said.</TE>
<TE>   After his speech, Bush spoke at a $4-million fund-raising luncheon
for Rep. Bob Riley (R-Ala.), who is running for governor against
Democratic incumbent Donald Siegelman.</TE>
<TE>   With 36 governorships being contested in November--and 23 of them
held now by the GOP--Democrats are all but certain to narrow the
Republican advantage nationwide.</TE>
<TE>   Currently, the GOP holds 27 governorships, compared with 21
occupied by Democrats and two by independents.</TE>
<TE>   But Alabama offers the GOP perhaps its best chance of defeating a
sitting Democrat, according to political analyst Charles Cook.
Siegelman, a first-termer, has been dogged by charges of cronyism in
awarding state contracts and, like many governors, by a severe budget
crunch.</TE>
<TE>   Bush's trip to Alabama launched a busy travel week. He will host
the president of Poland for a state visit on Wednesday, and then
accompany him Thursday for two appearances near Detroit. On Friday,
Bush is scheduled to speak to U.S. troops at Ft. Drum, N.Y.</TE>
<TE>   Times staff writer Janet Hook in Washington contributed to this
report.</TE>

Market</HD>
<DH>Food: Vietnamese basa and tra look and taste like the fish
along the Mississippi Delta. Farmers contend they are sold below
cost.</DH>

<DL>ITTA BENA, Miss.</DL>
<LD>It's 100 degrees, the mosquitoes are descending in clouds and five
men with shirts stuck to their backs with sweat wade into the
slime-green pond and begin to scoop out catfish.</LD>
<LD>   Their nets are full. The fish are fat.</LD>
<LD>   But these days, that's almost a curse.</LD>
<TE>   The whiskered critters--a staple of the Southern diet, a symbol of
the region's culture--are barely worth the grain it costs to feed
them. That's because 8,000 miles away, in little houseboats bobbing
along a different delta, the Mekong, Vietnamese families are raising
fish that look like catfish and taste like catfish.</TE>
<TE>   The cheaper imports, which have surged by 800% in two years, are
bedeviling Mississippi's catfish economy and farmers here now worry
that the prized frozen fillet market could fall like Saigon.</TE>
<TE>   Congress tried to help, declaring that of the 2,500 species
scientists refer to as "catfish," only those raised on U.S. farms
could be sold under that label. But catfish or not, the Vietnamese
fish continue to arrive by the boatload. "They're killing us," said
Noel Barrett, president of America's Catch, a major catfish farm and
processor here. "They may not have lemon-pepper seasoning or Cajun
varieties. But they're selling tons of fillets."</TE>
<TE>   About two weeks ago, in an effort to rescue their
$500-million-a-year industry, American catfish farmers filed an
anti-dumping petition against Vietnam. On Friday, lawyers will appear
in front of the U.S. International Trade Commission to ask for a 190%
duty on the Vietnamese basa and tra fish. They will argue that the
communist government is pricing the catfish cousins artificially low,
making it impossible for American growers, concentrated in the
impoverished Mississippi Delta, to compete.</TE>
<TE>   A generation ago, these same farmers turned away from cotton and
rice and hitched their hopes to the flat-headed, scaleless
bottom-feeder once called a river rat.</TE>
<TE>   They worked hard to erase that image, spending millions of dollars
on ad slogans like "Catfish: the Cultured Fish," and training
fingerlings (catfish minnows) to eat from the surface. There's even a
catfish museum in Belzoni, Miss., with a grinning sculpture out
front.</TE>
<TE>   The thousands of neatly cut catfish ponds have now become as much
a part of the Delta landscape as the shimmering two-lane highways,
the peeling-paint churches and the endless rows of crops stretching
toward the horizon.</TE>
<TE>   The Vietnamese say Americans are trying to unfairly protect their
industry.</TE>
<TE>   "More than 20 years after their failure during the Vietnam War,
[American officials] opt to launch a new war [against] Vietnamese tra
and basa catfish," according to a statement on the embassy's Web
site.</TE>
<TE>   Fried catfish is like the hot dog of the South, an easy, popular
dish usually served with okra and rice. The first farms opened in the
1960s in Arkansas and Mississippi.</TE>
<TE>   "We were looking for an alternative to row crops," said Turner
Arant, who dug his first pond in 1962 near Itta Bena after someone
had given him a handful of fingerlings "to play with."</TE>
<TE>   Arant now has more than 50 ponds, and gone are the days when he
used to walk along the banks slinging handfuls of feed from a bucket.
Now there are fingerling companies, net companies and equipment
companies that build trucks to spray catfish feed across the water.</TE>
<TE>   Scientists have formulated the mixture to make a catfish fillet
nutritionally competitive with chicken and other fish (128 calories,
15 grams of protein, 7 grams of fat per 3.5-ounce serving).</TE>
<TE>   Starting five years ago, American seafood companies began buying
Vietnamese basa and tra. In 1999, 2 million pounds were imported; by
2001, that number jumped to 17 million. Vietnam now controls 20% of
the fillet market. Many scientists argue that Vietnamese varieties
are as much catfish as those swimming in the Mississippi.</TE>
<TE>   "Absolutely no one in the aquarium industry or the scientific
community has ever restricted the word 'catfish' to North America,"
said Carl Ferraris, a catfish expert at the California Academy of
Science.</TE>
<TE>   The Food and Drug Administration agreed with him. Congress, in a
measure passed in November, overruled them.</TE>
<TE>   The anti-dumping petition is the first major trade dispute with
Vietnam, which normalized relations with the U.S. in 1995. To win,
American catfish farmers must prove that low prices--50 cents per
pound of raw fish compared with 80 cents two years ago--are caused by
Vietnam selling fish below cost.</TE>
<TE>   Much of the basa and tra are raised in cages in the Mekong Delta
by families who live in houseboats and feed them through holes cut in
the floor. The Vietnamese say lower labor costs are why Vietnamese
fillets retail for $1.60 per pound, compared with $2.40 for U.S.
catfish.</TE>
<TE>   The Vietnamese also say the U.S. catfish industry is
overproducing. In 1970, 5.7 million pounds of catfish were processed.
Last year, it was 600 million. The fish "you don't need to fry to
love" is now fourth-most popular, after tuna, Alaskan pollock (used
for fish sticks) and salmon. It passed cod in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   Catfish sales are strongest in Arkansas, Mississippi and
Tennessee. Many southern politicians have taken up the cause,
including one Arkansas congressman who claimed there were traces of
Agent Orange in the Vietnamese fish. Importers denied this, saying
basa and tra are fed the same nutrients as their American relatives.</TE>
<TE>   In 1996, Louisiana crawfish farmers filed an anti-dumping petition
against Chinese imports, with mixed results. The trade commission
sided with the U.S. crawdad industry, imposing a hefty tax on Chinese
imports. But six years later, prices remain depressed.</TE>
<TE>   If the catfish economy sinks, it could be disastrous for the
Mississippi Delta. Most of the 13,000 workers in the industry are
based here, historically one of the poorest regions in the nation. In
some counties, half the families live below the poverty line and the
unemployment rate is 20%. The Rev. Jesse Jackson once called Tunica,
Miss., "America's little Ethiopia."</TE>
<TE>   "Around here, this is all we got," said Larry Brown, manager of a
catfish farm in Sunflower, as he stared across the ponds. "If we
don't do something, we gone," he said, snapping his thick fingers,
"like that."</TE>

<HD>A Chronology of the Case Against U.S. Talib John Walker
Lindh</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Events leading up to John Walker Lindh's guilty plea on two charges
in a surprise deal with prosecutors:</LD>
<LD>   Nov. 25: Lindh is interrogated by CIA agent Johnny Micheal Spann
at a prison in northern Afghanistan. Spann was killed shortly
afterward in a prison uprising.</LD>
<LD>   Dec. 1: Lindh is taken into custody by Northern Alliance forces in
Mazar-i-Sharif after the uprising by Taliban prisoners. He had been
shot in the thigh. He was turned over to the U.S. later that day.</LD>
<TE>   Dec. 2: In an interview with a freelance journalist working for
CNN, Lindh discusses how and why he joined the Taliban and says his
"heart became attached to the [Taliban] movement."</TE>
<TE>   Dec. 7: Lindh arrives at a U.S. Marine base outside Kandahar,
where he is questioned by FBI agents.</TE>
<TE>   Dec. 14: Lindh is transferred to the Peleliu, an amphibious
landing ship in the Arabian Sea off the coast of Pakistan. He
undergoes surgery to remove the bullet in his leg.</TE>
<TE>   Jan. 24: Lindh makes his first appearance in U.S. District Court
in Alexandria, Va., after being flown to the United States. A
criminal complaint lists four charges, including conspiracy to kill
his fellow Americans in Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   Feb. 5: A federal grand jury indicts Lindh on 10 counts, alleging
he was trained by Osama bin Laden's network and then conspired with
the Taliban to kill Americans.</TE>
<TE>   Feb. 13: Lindh pleads not guilty to a 10-count federal indictment
that charged him with conspiring to kill Americans and aiding Bin
Laden's network. His attorney serves notice that the defense team
will try to keep the statements he made in Afghanistan from being
used at his trial.</TE>
<TE>   March 22: Lindh's lawyers contend that he spoke with the FBI in
Afghanistan only to escape horrible prison conditions. They ask that
the potentially incriminating statements be barred from his trial.</TE>
<TE>   July 15: Lindh pleads guilty to two charges in a deal with
prosecutors in which he would serve two 10-year prison sentences and
cooperate fully with U.S. authorities in the investigation of Al
Qaeda and terrorism.</TE>

<HD>Defense Was Willing to Strike a Deal, and Did</HD>
<DH>Case: A late run to jail for Lindh's signature and a call
to President Bush cap weeks of negotiation.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSH MEYER and RICHARD A. SERRANO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The talks that led to John Walker Lindh's surprise plea agreement
Monday started weeks ago, slowly and secretly, but ended with a
dramatic flurry of activity that included a late-night run to a
county jail for his signature and a call to the White House to brief
President Bush.</LD>
<LD>   After Lindh's capture on a battlefield in Afghanistan in November,
it appeared that both sides would press for a highly visible trial
that would bring into a public courtroom both the nation's war on
terrorism and the bizarre odyssey of an affluent and youthful seeker
from Marin County.</LD>
<LD>   But as both legal teams prepared for battle, the notion of an
out-of-court settlement was floated in early June--not by the Justice
Department or Lindh's high-profile San Francisco lawyer, James J.
Brosnahan.</LD>
<TE>   A Benign Beginning</TE>
<TE>   It began, both sides recalled Monday, almost accidentally, with a
casual conversation between a top federal prosecutor who had nothing
to do with the Lindh case and an acquaintance of Brosnahan in San
Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   Word got back to the Justice Department that, despite his
combative stance with regard to his client, Brosnahan might be
willing to consider a deal. Brosnahan was told that federal
prosecutors also might be willing to talk.</TE>
<TE>   Brosnahan said he then telephoned David N. Kelley, a special
prosecutor on the Lindh case. In recent years, Kelley had won major
legal victories in high-profile terrorism cases as chief of the
Organized Crime and Terrorism Division of the U.S. attorney's office
in New York.</TE>
<TE>   But Brosnahan said he also knew Kelley to be a reasonable
prosecutor.</TE>
<TE>   "I like Dave," Brosnahan said. "He's a good guy, and he does his
job. And I called him and I said, 'Well, is there anything to talk
about?' "</TE>
<TE>   After that, Brosnahan said, "one thing led to another."</TE>
<TE>   Kelley could not be reached for comment, but one senior Justice
Department official involved in the negotiations said defense lawyers
always try to strike a deal for their client. He said Justice
Department officials were surprised to learn about Brosnahan's
interest, given his public criticism about the lack of evidence
against Lindh.</TE>
<TE>   "Word came to us and as a result, we did have a conversation with
Jim and found out what he had in mind and a reasonable way, in his
view, of settling this," recalled the Justice Department official,
who asked not to be identified.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know what's going to come of it," Brosnahan said he told
Lindh at the time. Lindh is being held in a local jail in Alexandria,
Va.--just a few miles from where one of four hijacked planes was
crashed into the Pentagon on Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   Lindh's handful of lawyers soon submitted an informal proposal,
and Kelley and Assistant U.S. Attys. Randy I. Bellows and John S.
Davis went to work on a response, with input from U.S. Atty. Paul J.
McNulty.</TE>
<TE>   The deliberations--even the fact that the two sides were
talking--were a closely held secret.</TE>
<TE>   Even so, many of the individual points of contention had to be
vetted not just by the Justice Department, but by the Pentagon, the
CIA, the White House and other agencies.</TE>
<TE>   Federal prosecutors refused to budge from a baseline penalty of at
least 20 years in federal prison, sources said. Some U.S. officials
insisted that Lindh drop claims that he had been mistreated and that
his civil rights had been violated during his interrogations. Lindh's
lawyers wanted removal of all claims that Lindh was a terrorist who
knowingly helped Osama bin Laden.</TE>
<TE>   For nearly a month, federal prosecutors worked to craft the
proposal. On Thursday, President Bush was briefed on the terms of the
agreement and gave his blessing, Justice Department officials said.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, the proposal was given to Lindh's legal team
immediately after a contentious hearing before the presiding judge in
the case, U.S. District Judge T.S. Ellis III.</TE>
<TE>   The defense appeared open to negotiations, sources said, since
Ellis had indicated he was going to limit their attempts to suppress
allegedly incriminating statements that Lindh had made after his
capture.</TE>
<TE>   A week of hearings had been set to start Monday. Defense lawyers
felt that, given Ellis' Friday ruling, they would most likely lose
several other motions as well.</TE>
<TE>   After the hearing Friday, the two sides went next door to the U.S.
attorney's offices and sat down to negotiate.</TE>
<TE>   "Once we started talking, we never had a period of time where we
were not talking," said the senior Justice Department official. "We
were back and forth continuously."</TE>
<TE>   McNulty and Assistant Atty. Gen. Michael Chertoff were personally
involved in the marathon sessions, which at times grew contentious.
The insistence that Lindh deny his claims of mistreatment was a
particularly thorny issue.</TE>
<TE>   "That certainly took some work to get in there," said the Justice
Department official.</TE>
<TE>   "Anything, even the slightest changes" had to be run up the
flagpole, the official said. Some details went all the way to the
White House.</TE>
<TE>   The Final Papers</TE>
<TE>   By Sunday evening, the Justice Department team was drawing up the
final papers, including an additional charge stipulating that Lindh
was carrying explosives in the commission of a felony--a charge that
carried a mandatory sentence of 10 years.</TE>
<TE>   As Justice officials summoned Lindh's lawyers, another call was
made to the White House to alert Bush to the final details before the
deal was struck.</TE>
<TE>   Defense lawyer George C. Harris scrambled to get the 12-page
agreement to the Alexandria jail shortly after 10 p.m., where Lindh
promptly signed it.</TE>
<TE>   "He was calm about it," Harris said. "Just as he's always been
throughout this case, he was very respectful and very helpful. He is
a young man and wants to get on with his life."</TE>
<TE>   After that, prosecutors spent much of the night tying up loose
ends so that the deal could be announced and approved in court Monday
morning.</TE>
<TE>   McNulty had no comment on the behind-the-scenes legal wrangling.
But he said the 60-plus hours of negotiations paid off.</TE>
<TE>   "It was worth the time and effort because it was worth the
resolution for the American people," McNulty said.</TE>

<HD>Heart Assn. Updates Its Guidelines</HD>
<DH>Health: Secondhand smoke is added to its list of cardiac
risk factors. A simpler way to measure obesity is offered.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>DALLAS</DL>
<LD>The American Heart Assn. has updated its guidelines for preventing
heart attacks and strokes, listing secondhand smoke as a risk factor
for the first time and recommending that people get screened for risk
factors beginning at age 20.</LD>
<LD>   Also, a daily dose of aspirin, previously recommended only for
those who have already had heart attacks and strokes, is now
suggested for people who have been found to have at least a 10% risk
of a heart attack in the next decade.</LD>
<LD>   And to address the nation's growing obesity problem, the heart
association adopted a simpler alternative to the body-mass index: a
waistline measurement. Simply put, men should have a waistline of 40
inches or less; for women, 35 inches or less.</LD>
<TE>   "It's turned out that waist circumference is as good a predictor
of risk as body-mass index," said Dr. Sidney C. Smith, the
association's chief science officer.</TE>
<TE>   The revised "Guide to the Primary Prevention of Cardiovascular
Diseases" was published in Tuesday's issue of the journal
Circulation. The guidelines have not been updated since they were
first published in 1997.</TE>
<TE>   "The emphasis is on prevention. We know a lot about cardiovascular
disease. We know what causes it, we know how to prevent it," said Dr.
Thomas A. Pearson, a professor at the University of Rochester School
of Medicine and chairman of a committee that revised the guidelines.</TE>
<TE>   For the first time, the new guidelines urge people 20 and older to
meet with a doctor every five years to assess risk factors such as
smoking, family medical history and blood pressure. Previously, the
heart association did not give an age at which patients should first
be screened for their risk of heart disease.</TE>
<TE>   People 40 and older should be screened for additional risk
factors, including high cholesterol levels, the heart association
said.</TE>
<TE>   For the first time, secondhand smoke was added to the list of risk
factors, which already included smoking.</TE>
<TE>   The guidelines combine the latest findings from an array of
studies.</TE>
<TE>   The new guidelines drop passages in the 1997 edition that said
hormone supplements and antioxidant vitamins might reduce the risk of
heart attacks and strokes. More recent research--some of it released
last week--has called those assertions into question.</TE>
<TE>   Doctors applauded the idea of screenings for heart disease, the
nation's leading health problem.</TE>
<TE>   "These new recommendations should benefit the entire nation.
Certainly prevention is the key," said Dr. Robert Frankel of
Maimonides Medical Center in New York City</TE>

<HD>Rumsfeld Says Leaks to Media Aid Al Qaeda</HD>
<DH>Security: According to a report, terrorists have used the
press to learn of Pentagon capabilities.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ESTHER SCHRADER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld warned senior military and
civilian officials at the Pentagon this week that classified
information obtained by the press is being used by Al Qaeda
operatives to plan attacks on the United States, according to a memo
obtained by The Times.</LD>
<LD>   In the July 12 memo, Rumsfeld wrote that leaking of information
from the Pentagon to the media "is damaging our country's ability to
stop terrorist acts and is putting American lives at risk."</LD>
<LD>   He attached the memo to an unclassified CIA report, prepared at
his request, saying that Al Qaeda planners "have learned much about
our counterterrorist intelligence capabilities from U.S. and foreign
media."</LD>
<TE>   Rumsfeld has been fierce about the need to keep the Pentagon's
secrets, and in the early days of the Afghanistan campaign he warned
publicly that officials who leak classified information about the
maneuvers of special operations forces violate federal criminal law
and put soldiers' lives at risk.</TE>
<TE>   But in this new memo, Rumsfeld acknowledged that the leaks have
persisted. He asked his top aides and the military heads to "meet
with your staff to discuss the seriousness of the damaging lack of
professionalism we continue to see on a daily basis."</TE>
<TE>   Rumsfeld's memo was prompted by a recent New York Times report on
the Pentagon's plans to invade Iraq, a senior Pentagon official who
requested anonymity told The Times. The article relied on a
classified planning document the paper said it had obtained from a
defense official. The report infuriated Rumsfeld, Pentagon officials
said.</TE>
<TE>   Another senior defense official, who asked not to be identified,
said that while no formal inquiry of that leak has been launched, "it
is being looked at who might have shared that information."</TE>
<TE>   Rumsfeld has not called for investigations into the origin of
information previously leaked to the press, the official said. Asked
at a news conference in October about his desire to find the sources
of leaks, Rumsfeld said he was "too busy ... to run around trying to
find who did that." But the fact that he has now asked his deputies
to meet with their staffs and report back to him reflects how
seriously he views the issue, the official said.</TE>
<TE>   The Pentagon is so vast and so diverse that news of its operations
and its internal debates are often released to the press by officials
with a stake in the outcome of policy decisions.</TE>
<TE>   By the standards of recent conflicts, the Pentagon places far
greater restrictions today on access to military operations and to
senior military commanders.</TE>
<TE>   During the 1991 Gulf War, dozens of journalists were permitted to
accompany Army units that swept through western Iraq or to join
Marines who punched through to Kuwait. They interviewed top generals
and received regular briefings from Gen. H. Norman Schwarzkopf, the
head of U.S. Central Command.</TE>
<TE>   Although friction arose over several issues, including delays in
the military's processing of journalistic dispatches, news
organizations and the Pentagon reached agreement in 1992 on a basic
outline for future war coverage. That led to closer interaction
between journalists and troops during the U.S. interventions in
Somalia and Haiti.</TE>
<TE>   But under Rumsfeld, the Pentagon has maintained an exceedingly
close hold on information, particularly regarding the conflict in
Afghanistan and other aspects of the war on terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   Rumsfeld first spoke out publicly on the subject in October, when
news of a raid by 100 Army Rangers and other Special Forces commandos
was reported while the troops were still inside Afghanistan. He
admitted that the leak did not endanger U.S. troops, and all returned
from the mission safely. But, he said, "it was something that
[showed] disregard for the lives of the people involved in that
operation."</TE>
<TE>   Intelligence officials were furious in September when Sen. Orrin
G. Hatch (R-Utah) said after the attacks on the World Trade Center
and the Pentagon that the United States had intercepted a call
between two associates of Osama bin Laden suggesting their
involvement. Intelligence officials said later that the release of
the highly classified information caused Al Qaeda operatives to stop
using telephones.</TE>
<TE>   According to the CIA report distributed by Rumsfeld, captured
fighters have stated that Al Qaeda operatives are extremely
security-conscious and have altered their practices in response to
what they have learned in the press about Pentagon capabilities.</TE>
<TE>   Public disclosures have "jeopardized highly fragile and very
sensitive intelligence capabilities that we require for the
successful prosecution of the war against terrorism," the report
says.</TE>
<TE>   It adds that the disclosures have made potential allies and
sources in foreign countries less willing to work with U.S. agents
out of fear their aid will be publicized.</TE>
<TE>   The Pentagon has no evidence that the leak to the New York Times
or any other has endangered U.S. military operations, a senior
defense official said.</TE>

<HD>Lindh Pleads Guilty, Agrees to Aid Inquiry</HD>
<DH>Courts: In a surprise deal, he faces 20 years in prison
after admitting fighting for the Taliban. U.S. drops most charges,
including conspiring to kill Americans.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD A. SERRANO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ALEXANDRIA, Va.</DL>
<LD>John Walker Lindh pleaded guilty Monday in federal court to taking up
arms as a soldier in the Taliban army and agreed to cooperate with
the U.S. government in its efforts to capture and prosecute
terrorists.</LD>
<LD>   In return, the government, which once flaunted the ragged-looking
captive as the face of terrorism in Afghanistan, dropped all charges
against the young man from Northern California for conspiring to kill
Americans and absolved him of any responsibility in the death of CIA
Agent Johnny Micheal Spann.</LD>
<LD>   The plea abruptly ended what had promised to be the first
significant terrorism-related trial since Sept. 11, with dramatic
testimony from witnesses now being held in Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, as
well as an unidentified CIA operative and other U.S. military and
intelligence officials.</LD>
<TE>   Lindh, 21, agreed to plead guilty to two felony charges: He
admitted serving as a soldier for the Taliban, and that he carried a
rifle and hand grenades while doing so. The latter charge was not
part of the original indictment.</TE>
<TE>   Lindh could have received a maximum of three life sentences had he
been convicted on all charges. Instead, he accepted a sentence of 20
years in prison and, with time already served and good behavior,
could be freed after 17 years.</TE>
<TE>   The arrangement, worked out in marathon sessions over the weekend,
was finalized early Monday morning after defense lawyers presented
prosecutors with Lindh's signature at the bottom of a 12-page plea
agreement.</TE>
<TE>   Ten hours later, the lanky, shorn defendant, wearing a green
prison jumpsuit, stood before U.S. District Judge T.S. Ellis III and
gave the government its first criminal conviction among hundreds of
captives taken during the war on terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   "I provided my services as a soldier to the Taliban last year from
about August to November. During the course of doing so I carried a
rifle and two grenades," he said. "And I did so knowingly, knowing it
was illegal."</TE>
<TE>   Outside the courthouse, both sides claimed a measure of
satisfaction in the plea agreement, which was announced just as a
hearing had been convened on whether half a dozen allegedly
self-incriminating statements by Lindh should be used in his trial.</TE>
<TE>   The government won a lengthy sentence for Lindh, as well as his
cooperation, which could prove useful in two areas: in corroborating
what investigators have learned since Lindh was last questioned, in
December, and in prosecuting other captives, such as those housed at
the U.S. Naval Base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Lindh could be called as
a witness against those detainees either in grand jury proceedings or
trials.</TE>
<TE>   'A Tough Sentence'</TE>
<TE>   Also, the government skirted the potentially embarrassing
situation of having to explain why Lindh was held for nearly two
months in conditions his attorneys described as inhumane. Defense
attorneys must drop their claims that Lindh was "tortured."</TE>
<TE>   They have complained that Lindh was stripped naked and tied for
days to a gurney inside a large metal container. Several times, U.S.
military members threatened to shoot him, while others took souvenir
photographs of him.</TE>
<TE>   Lindh, who also faces $500,000 in fines, must turn over to the
government any profits he makes selling his life story.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Atty. Paul J. McNulty called Lindh's conviction "an important
victory for the American people."</TE>
<TE>   "This is a tough sentence," he said. "This is an appropriate
punishment. And this case proves that the criminal justice system can
be an effective tool in combating terrorism."</TE>
<TE>   The defense saw its own benefits in the plea arrangement. Lindh
likely will still be in his 30s when he is released. And he and his
family will not have to bear the cost and uncertainty of a trial that
was to begin next month in a Washington suburb filled with potential
jurors who work for the military and other government agencies.</TE>
<TE>   Further, the deal means that the man who left home in search of
Islamic religious studies will not be legally branded a terrorist.</TE>
<TE>   "He has never had any animosity toward any American serving this
country," said lead defense attorney James J. Brosnahan of San
Francisco. "Never. He never wanted to kill anybody.... He never hurt
anybody. I think that's important."</TE>
<TE>   Studying Islam Abroad</TE>
<TE>   His father, Frank Lindh, a San Francisco-area attorney, said that
while he was pleased the case has ended, he still believes the
government went too far and "overreacted in an extreme way" in trying
to demonize his son as a terrorist and murderer.</TE>
<TE>   "Those were not proper charges in the first place," Frank Lindh
said.</TE>
<TE>   "I told John when he came back from Afghanistan, when I first met
him [in jail in January] that Nelson Mandela served 27 years in
prison. He's a good man, like John. And I told John he needed to be
prepared for something along those lines.</TE>
<TE>   "Someday I hope that the government will come around even further
and say that even 20 years is wrong for this boy. He's a good boy."</TE>
<TE>   Lindh, who was born in Washington and raised in Marin County, left
the U.S. in February 2000 in pursuit of the Muslim faith, traveling
to Yemen, Pakistan and Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   He immersed himself in his studies of Islam. But he also sometimes
sent angry e-mails home, distancing himself from his family. He
claimed the U.S. had instigated the Persian Gulf War and showed no
sympathy for the 17 lives lost in the terrorist bombing of the
destroyer Cole.</TE>
<TE>   Lindh found his way to a training camp that the government said
was run by Al Qaeda, an ally of the Taliban. He learned to fight for
the Taliban army and in November surrendered to the Northern
Alliance. He then was turned over to U.S. authorities.</TE>
<TE>   He was held for nearly two months, unable to reach his family or
attorney, and on six occasions apparently spoke at length to U.S.
military, intelligence and law enforcement officials about his
activities and work on behalf of the Taliban.</TE>
<TE>   Returned under heavy guard to the U.S., he was indicted by a
federal grand jury on 10 counts, including a charge that he conspired
to kill Americans and that he conspired with the Taliban and Osama
bin Laden's Al Qaeda network.</TE>
<TE>   He was also implicated indirectly in the death of Spann, who tried
to interrogate Lindh shortly before he was killed in a prison
uprising in Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   Most Counts Dismissed</TE>
<TE>   In the plea agreement, all but the ninth count of the indictment
was dismissed, and Lindh acknowledged his guilt in "providing
services" as a soldier for the Taliban. Such activity was outlawed
during the Clinton administration because of the Taliban's close
association with Al Qaeda.</TE>
<TE>   Lindh also pleaded guilty to an additional charge of carrying an
AKM rifle and two grenades in commission of the felony of supporting
the Taliban.</TE>
<TE>   Asked about helping the Taliban, Lindh told Ellis: "I plead
guilty, sir." Asked about carrying the arms, he again said: "I plead
guilty, sir."</TE>
<TE>   Lindh agreed to a prison term of 10 years on each charge, to run
consecutively, and Ellis set sentencing for Oct. 4.</TE>
<TE>   Randy I. Bellows, the assistant prosecutor handling the case, gave
the court a "Statement of Facts" in which he noted that Clinton in
1999 made it illegal under a "national emergency" for Americans to
assist the Taliban.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, Bellows told the judge, Lindh in the spring of 2001
"crossed from Pakistan into Afghanistan for the purpose of taking up
arms with the Taliban against the Northern Alliance."</TE>
<TE>   He said Lindh reported to a Taliban recruiting center and "told
personnel at that facility that he was an American and that he wanted
to go to the front lines to fight."</TE>
<TE>   Then, in June 2001, Lindh traveled to the al-Farooq training camp,
"a facility associated with Osama bin Laden," Bellows said, where he
"participated fully in its training activities," including courses in
weapons, explosives and battlefield combat.</TE>
<TE>   Last summer he swore allegiance to jihad, enlisted in the Taliban
army and was given the AKM rifle and grenades. As a soldier, he
joined a small fighting unit, rotating in one- to two-week shifts in
the trenches, opposing the Northern Alliance troops.</TE>
<TE>   But defense attorney Brosnahan said Lindh never fired his weapon.
"This is not Rambo we're talking about here," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Further, Brosnahan said, Lindh was horrified by the Sept. 11
terrorist attacks on New York and the Pentagon and does not consider
Bin Laden "an appropriate religious figure of any kind."</TE>
<TE>   "He identifies with the victims of 9/11, feels bad about it, never
supported it, never knew it was coming," Brosnahan said.</TE>
<TE>   Spann's widow, Shannon, said that while she disagreed with some
terms of the plea arrangement, it provides a measure of relief.</TE>
<TE>   "It helps me to have heard him say that he's guilty," she said.
"The hardest thing for me was to have him stand in front of the
American people in open court and say, I'm not guilty."</TE>
<TE>   She said she would have preferred to see Lindh face trial on the
entire indictment, adding that she felt he deserved a life sentence.</TE>
<TE>   "Mike believed, and I certainly believe, that people should take
responsibility for their behavior," she said. "I'm afraid we're not
sending a very strong message about the seriousness of his behavior."</TE>
<TE>   But Lindh's mother, Marilyn Walker, said that while she will be
losing her son for a long time, the extended sentence also will give
him time to be alone, to pray and to receive visits from his family
if their request is granted that he be held in a prison near San
Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   "We love John very much," she said, "and want what is best for
him."</TE>

<HD>Reform Bill Too Weak, Senators Say</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD SIMON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>In the end, the accounting reform bill approved by the Senate on
Monday still wasn't tough enough for some lawmakers.</LD>
<LD>   Sens. John McCain (R-Ariz.) and Carl Levin (D-Mich.) were angry
that votes were blocked on their efforts to strengthen the accounting
rules for stock options.</LD>
<LD>   "The fix is in," McCain groused.</LD>
<TE>   Levin said the Senate's failure to address the issue left a
"gaping hole" in the reform legislation. Both, however, voted for the
final bill.</TE>
<TE>   Stock options have become a popular form of executive
compensation, especially among high-technology companies in Silicon
Valley. The options give employees the right to buy company shares at
a set price in the future.</TE>
<TE>   But companies are not required to count options as an expense on
their books, a practice that critics say provides investors with a
less than full picture of a company's financial condition.</TE>
<TE>   Last week, Democrats blocked McCain's effort to get a vote on
requiring companies to expense options. On Monday, Republicans
blocked a Levin attempt to get a vote on directing the Financial
Accounting Standards Board, the rule-setting body for the accounting
industry, to study the issue and adopt an "appropriate" rule within a
year.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Phil Gramm (R-Texas) contended that Levin's proposal would
leave the board no choice but to order expensing of options. Levin,
he said, wanted "to have a fair trial and then a hanging."</TE>
<TE>   Gramm used a procedural maneuver to block a vote.</TE>
<TE>   "Stock options are pretty important to the American economy,"
Gramm said. "We need to take into account that 6 million people who
are not executives of companies get stock options every year, and we
want to be sure we're not endangering their ability to own a piece of
America."</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Mike Enzi (R-Wyo.), an accountant whose views on accounting
issues carry weight with fellow Republicans, expressed concern that
expensing options would force companies to restate their earnings.
"Restatements are part of what's making the market very upset right
now," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Even though Senate Democrats blocked the vote Thursday on McCain's
amendment, Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle (D-S.D.) pledged that
the issue would be back before lawmakers.</TE>
<TE>   "One way or another, we will have a vote," he said. "We might as
well get it over with."</TE>

<HD>Senate Passes Broad Corporate Reforms</HD>
<DH>Business: A measure to restore the public's faith after
scandals receives unanimous approval.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD SIMON and RONALD BROWNSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Senate on Monday unanimously approved a bill that would impose
sweeping reforms on the accounting industry and corporate management,
measures aimed at restoring faith in the beleaguered business
community.</LD>
<LD>   The bill gathered unstoppable momentum following a recent spate of
business scandals, and President Bush has said he is eager to sign
legislation cracking down on corporate corruption. But the bill's
final shape remains uncertain. Senate negotiators now will work on a
compromise with leaders of the House, which passed a less stringent
bill this year.</LD>
<LD>   The Senate bill would create an independent board to oversee the
accounting industry, limit the ability of accounting firms to consult
for companies they audit, ban corporate loans to company insiders,
and crack down on other business practices that contributed to the
scandals. It also would add new penalties for securities fraud and
make it easier to prosecute dishonest executives.</LD>
<TE>   Bush urged the House and Senate to get together "as quickly as
possible and get me a bill that I can sign" before Congress adjourns
for its August recess. "We owe it to America," he said.</TE>
<TE>   He and other White House officials have expressed reservations
about some key elements of the Senate bill. But the Senate's 97-0
vote approving the measure is likely to heighten pressure on him and
House Republicans to rapidly reach agreement with Democrats pushing
the tougher version.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle (D-S.D.) challenged
House Speaker J. Dennis Hastert (R-Ill.) to forgo negotiations and
take the Senate bill to the House floor immediately.</TE>
<TE>   "It would be a disservice to the American people to now allow some
to go behind closed doors to weaken it," Daschle said. "So I say to
our friends in the House: Do this the right way; pass our bill and
start putting confidence back in our markets."</TE>
<TE>   John Feehery, a spokesman for Hastert, rebuffed Daschle's
proposal. Noting that the Republican-controlled House approved its
bill in April and has been waiting for the Democratic-led Senate to
act, Feehery said, "We've got a good bill, and we're going to go to
[negotiations] and get a better bill."</TE>
<TE>   The Senate bill was drafted by Sen. Paul S. Sarbanes (D-Md.) in
response to the collapse of Enron Corp. late last year. It languished
for several months, then was revived late last month after reports of
WorldCom's nearly $4-billion accounting misstatement caused jittery
nerves from Wall Street to Washington.</TE>
<TE>   During debate that began last week, Democrats and Republicans vied
to strengthen the Sarbanes bill. The GOP position was particularly
striking, given that Republicans generally oppose more regulation of
business.</TE>
<TE>   Sarbanes said the bill is needed to "ensure that investors can
once again trust corporate executives and their financial reports,
and have confidence in the independence of accountants and analysts."</TE>
<TE>   But on one issue, lawmakers were willing to go only so far. On
Thursday and Monday, votes were blocked on measures that could have
led to new accounting rules for stock options.</TE>
<TE>   "It seems to me we are leaving a significant gap in the reforms
which we are struggling so hard to adopt," said Sen. Carl Levin
(D-Mich.), contending that current rules allow companies to overstate
their profits.</TE>
<TE>   The unanimous vote on the overall bill testified to the change in
the political environment powered by the cascade of corporate
accounting scandals. Bush, for instance, arrived in office pledging
to reduce, not increase, government oversight of business.</TE>
<TE>   Before the second wave of corporate scandals, conservatives such
as Sen. Phil Gramm (R-Texas) had hoped to dilute the bill on the
Senate floor. But he ended up voting for the bill, saying the final
measure emerging from negotiations should "fix what's broken in our
financial markets while imposing the minimum burden on those
businesses and workers who have not abused the system nor broken the
law."</TE>
<TE>   Pressure Is Increasing</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration had made clear its preference for the
House bill. But analysts say the troubles on Wall Street likely will
force Bush to bend further toward the Senate than he would like.</TE>
<TE>   "The lopsided Senate vote makes it likely that any accounting
reform bill that emerges from the upcoming House-Senate conference is
likely to be a strong one--and one that tilts toward the Senate
rather than the House bill," said Robert Litan, economic studies
director for the nonpartisan Brookings Institution in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   Senate Minority Leader Trent Lott (R-Miss.) said that he discussed
the Senate bill with Bush and Hastert last week and "both feel like
the Sarbanes bill is within the range that they can support."</TE>
<TE>   A particularly contentious issue in the negotiations likely will
be the structure and powers of a new accounting oversight board.</TE>
<TE>   Both versions of the bill would create a watchdog panel for
auditors. But critics of the House bill say it would create a weak
board.</TE>
<TE>   The Senate bill creates a board with full authority to set
auditing and ethics rules and investigate and discipline auditors.
The five-member board would be appointed by the Securities and
Exchange Commission, with two members, but no more, having accounting
backgrounds.</TE>
<TE>   The House bill delegates much of the details of the new board's
authority to the SEC, an agency that critics say has not acted
aggressively enough to root out corporate corruption. Democrats also
say the board created by the House bill would have no power to set
auditing standards and limited authority to punish violators. Under
the House bill, the five-member board would be made up of two
accountants and two other accountants who have not practiced
accounting for the last two years.</TE>
<TE>   The White House has expressed concern that the Senate bill could
create a turf war between the new accounting oversight board and the
SEC.</TE>
<TE>   The Senate bill also would:</TE>
<TE>   * Prohibit accounting firms from providing most consulting
services to companies they audit, but give the oversight board
authority to grant exemptions on a case-by-case basis. The House bill
would restrict only two types of consulting. The lucrative consulting
fees Enron's auditor, Arthur Andersen, received from the energy firm
were seen as a factor that prevented auditors from aggressively
challenging Enron's questionable accounting.</TE>
<TE>   * Require accounting firms to change the lead auditor after five
consecutive years of auditing a company. There is no similar
provision in the House bill.</TE>
<TE>   * Empower the SEC to bar dishonest corporate officials from
serving as officers and directors of public companies. Bush called
for this provision in his speech to Wall Street last week.</TE>
<TE>   * Increase penalties for white-collar crimes, including Bush's
proposed doubling, to 10 years, the maximum prison term for mail and
wire fraud.</TE>
<TE>   * Create a new felony statute for securities fraud and increase
penalties for document shredding.</TE>
<TE>   * Extend the time frame from three years to five for plaintiffs to
bring securities fraud lawsuits against companies, and prevent
corporate officers who lose securities fraud lawsuits from using
bankruptcy laws to avoid payments to victims. The House bill has no
similar provision, but House GOP leaders have endorsed the tougher
criminal penalties.</TE>
<TE>   * Require corporate executives to certify their companies'
financial reports. Chief executives and chief financial officers
could be forced to forfeit bonuses and other compensation if they
file false financial reports.</TE>
<TE>   The House and Senate bills have a number of common features. Both
would impose new financial disclosure requirements on public
companies. Company insiders would have to disclose loans and stock
trades in a more timely manner. Companies would have to disclose
off-balance-sheet partnerships, such as the ones used by Enron to
hide hundreds of millions of dollars in losses.</TE>
<TE>   Both measures would ban corporate executives from trading stock
when rank-and-file employees are locked out from making changes in
their company stock retirement portfolio. Both measures direct the
SEC to establish conflict-of-interest rules for stock analysts.</TE>
<TE>   And House and Senate legislation calls for substantially increased
funding for the Securities and Exchange Commission to investigate
corporate corruption, far more than Bush has proposed.</TE>
<TE>   Business lobby groups largely stepped aside as the Senate bill
steamrolled toward approval in recent days. But the lobbyists plan to
press their objections to the legislation during the Senate-House
negotiations.</TE>
<TE>   R. Bruce Josten, executive vice president of the U.S. Chamber of
Commerce, sent a letter to senators Monday supporting a number of
provisions but objecting that the accounting oversight board would
"at best duplicate--or at worst --conflict, with existing SEC
oversight, thus confusing business with respect to the body of rules
and regulations to observe and with which to comply."</TE>
<TE>   Elections on the Horizon</TE>
<TE>   The debate over corporate accountability has begun to migrate into
the midterm congressional elections. Operatives in both parties say
it is unclear whether voters will parse through the differences
between the two sides on some of the highly technical questions. But
with candidates such as Texas Democratic Senate hopeful Ron Kirk
attacking their rivals for links to Enron and WorldCom--and others
declaring their support for an "investor bill of rights"--legislators
have grown leery of appearing too soft on corporate malfeasance.</TE>
<TE>   "That issue is lightning in a bottle," said Bill Fletcher, the
communication director for Bob Clement, the Democratic Senate
candidate in Tennessee.</TE>
<TE>   Adding to the political fireworks, the Senate debate crystallized
just as Bush was facing renewed questioning over his sale of stock in
Harken Energy Corp., a company on whose board he sat, just before it
announced significant losses 12 years ago. After an investigation,
the SEC concluded in 1991 it had no basis to charge Bush, but he's
facing rising demands from Democrats to release the commission's
files on the case.</TE>

<HD>Extra Time Given for SAT Testing Will No Longer Be Noted in
the Results</HD>
<DH>Education: Advocates for the disabled alleged
discrimination and won a settlement. Educators raise fraud concerns.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>REBECCA TROUNSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The College Board announced Monday that it will stop notifying
universities and colleges when disabled students receive extra time
or other special accommodations on the SAT college entrance exam.</LD>
<LD>   Such flagging of disabled students' results had been decried as
discriminatory by advocates for the disabled who sought its end. But
with the notification now dropped, some educators and admissions
officers are concerned that more test-takers may fraudulently seek
designation as disabled.</LD>
<LD>   About 2% of the 2 million high school students who take the SAT
each year receive special accommodations--usually extra time on the
test--because of documented disabilities, the College Board said.
Their scores are marked with an asterisk to let college admissions
officers know that the test was taken under "nonstandard" conditions.</LD>
<TE>   The College Board will end the practice after September 2003 as
part of a legal settlement announced Monday with an Oakland-based
nonprofit law firm, Disability Rights Advocates.</TE>
<TE>   The decision to drop the flagging also will apply to the PSAT--the
practice version of the SAT--and the Advanced Placement exams. Those
tests, along with the SAT, are owned by the New York-based College
Board.</TE>
<TE>   Alison Aubrejuan, an attorney with Disability Rights Advocates,
praised Monday's agreement as "tremendously significant" for people
with disabilities.</TE>
<TE>   "The SAT is taken by millions of students every year," Aubrejuan
said. "This will end a discriminatory practice and make higher
education much more accessible to people with disabilities."</TE>
<TE>   But some educators and college admissions officials say they worry
that the change, given the nationwide frenzy over college admissions,
could induce many more students, including some without actual
physical or learning disabilities, to apply for more time on the
test.</TE>
<TE>   The growing use of accommodations--especially by white, affluent
students--has drawn criticism in recent years. Two years ago, a study
by the California state auditor--prompted by a Los Angeles Times
investigation--found that private school students were four times as
likely as public school students to receive the extra time. Most of
those received diagnoses of learning disabilities.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a major concern," said Bruce Poch, dean of admissions at
Pomona College in Claremont. "We're going to see a flood of people
who will exploit this even more than they do to this point. There are
a whole lot of kids who are able to go out and get a diagnosis for a
fee, including some who may not have done that before because of the
flag on their score."</TE>
<TE>   Poch said Monday's decision could hurt those with real
disabilities by making it harder for college admission officials to
identify students who legitimately need the accommodations.</TE>
<TE>   The agreement grew out of a 2001 settlement in a federal lawsuit
brought against the College Board's for-profit arm, the Educational
Testing Service, on behalf of Mark Breimhorst, a man with a physical
disability who was rejected by business schools after his GMAT scores
were flagged. In the settlement last year, the testing service said
it would eliminate flagging on the GMAT and other tests. The
agreement did not apply to the SAT or other tests owned by the
College Board, but the board agreed to appoint a panel to examine the
issue.</TE>
<TE>   In a recommendation made public Monday and adopted by the board,
the panel urged an end to the practice of flagging.</TE>
<TE>   "We wanted to do what was fair and right and professional, and the
majority of the panel said the right thing to do was to stop
flagging," Gaston Caperton, the president of the College Board, said
Monday.</TE>

<HD>Ridge Urges Congress to Preserve Homeland Plan</HD>
<DH>Politics: He says moving certain agencies to the new
department is critical to its success.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NICK ANDERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Even as powerful factions in Congress angle to carve up a Cabinet
department that does not yet exist, a top advisor to President Bush
pleaded Monday with senior lawmakers to preserve the core of the
administration's homeland security proposal, and the White House
moved to unveil a companion strategy to combat terrorism.</LD>
<LD>   Tom Ridge, Bush's homeland security director, told a special panel
of House leaders that the administration was ready to bargain over
some parts of its proposal to reorganize the executive branch but
would fight to win approval for others.</LD>
<LD>   For instance, Ridge said, the Coast Guard, the Secret Service and
the Federal Emergency Management Agency are all "critical" to the
success of the proposed Department of Homeland Security.</LD>
<TE>   Last week, in the opening skirmish of what is expected to be an
intense turf battle, some influential House committees voted not to
move those agencies to the proposed department.</TE>
<TE>   Meantime, Ridge disclosed that a long-awaited "National Strategy
for Homeland Security"--detailing in about 100 pages the threats the
nation faces and the rationale for the newly proposed
department--would be released today.</TE>
<TE>   A summary of the strategy, which the White House made public
Monday evening, laid out stark challenges.</TE>
<TE>   "We must defend ourselves against a wide range of means and
methods of attack," the summary said. "Our enemies are working to
obtain chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear weapons for the
purpose of wreaking unprecedented damage on America.... Our society
presents an almost infinite array of potential targets that can be
attacked through a variety of methods."</TE>
<TE>   The strategy, according to the summary, reflects many initiatives
already underway since the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks in six
"critical mission areas": intelligence; border and transportation
security; domestic counterterrorism; protection of critical
infrastructure; defense against catastrophic terrorism; and emergency
readiness and response.</TE>
<TE>   For example, the strategy calls for development of systems of
nuclear and chemical sensors to prevent terrorists from using weapons
of mass destruction. Bush will outline the strategy today in a
meeting with lawmakers.</TE>
<TE>   Monday's developments came as Congress intensified its search for
compromise legislation to enact what the administration calls the
broadest government reorganization in more than 50 years, since the
modern Defense Department and intelligence agencies were created.</TE>
<TE>   As announced by Bush in a June 6 address to the nation, the
Department of Homeland Security would embrace more than 169,000
employees from 22 agencies now dispersed throughout the government.</TE>
<TE>   Most lawmakers now agree that a new department, which would be the
15th in the cabinet, should be created. But there is so far no
consensus on its size or its responsibilities.</TE>
<TE>   This week, a special nine-member panel of House leaders will
attempt to craft a homeland security bill for floor debate and a vote
next week. To do that, the panel must meld competing, often
conflicting recommendations from 11 House committees.</TE>
<TE>   On the other side of the Capitol, the Senate plans to consider its
own version before it begins a summer recess next month.</TE>
<TE>   In his appearance before the House panel, Ridge did make some
concessions. For instance, he announced that the administration would
agree to keep in the Agriculture Department several thousand federal
employees in charge of protecting crops and livestock. Originally,
Bush had sought to move the entire 8,600-employee Animal and Plant
Health Inspection Service to Homeland Security.</TE>
<TE>   The concessions reflected the emerging reality conceded by GOP
leaders: Bush cannot get everything he wants on homeland security
through Congress.</TE>
<TE>   House Majority Leader Dick Armey (R-Texas), chairman of the
special leadership panel and one of the president's strongest allies
on Capitol Hill, said Bush had proposed "the basic template" for
legislation that could be enacted. "But there will be noticeable
differences from the president's plan," Armey added.</TE>
<TE>   House Democrats on the special panel warned that the congressional
GOP leadership and the administration would have to remain flexible
to win their party's support in a closely divided Congress.</TE>
<TE>   "To make this work, we must build a bipartisan coalition that is
as deep as it is broad," Rep. Martin Frost of Texas, chairman of the
House Democratic Caucus, told Ridge.</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Rosa L. DeLauro (D-Conn.), assistant to Minority Leader
Richard A. Gephardt (D-Mo.), said that the House should give "serious
consideration" to the committees that recommended major changes in
the Bush plan.</TE>
<TE>   The House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, for
example, voted to block transfer of the Coast Guard and FEMA. The
House Judiciary Committee voted to block the movement of a large
division of the Immigration and Naturalization Service. And the House
Energy and Commerce Committee voted to block the proposed shift of
health research units, focusing on bioterrorism, from the Department
of Health and Human Services.</TE>
<TE>   But many lawmakers remain loyal to Bush.</TE>
<TE>   The House Government Reform Committee endorsed much of the Bush
plan as drafted, though it narrowly voted to guarantee collective
bargaining rights in the proposed department for federal employees
now represented by unions, an amendment the administration opposes.</TE>
<TE>   To defend the Bush plan, Ridge faces the difficult task of
persuading lawmakers that many agencies whose functions are only
partly tied to homeland security should move, in whole, to the
proposed department. On the Coast Guard, which some defenders note
serves the maritime industry in many ways that have little to do with
port security, Ridge offered a practical political argument. If it is
in Homeland Security, he said, the Coast Guard is likely to get more
money--funding that can be used for non-security missions.</TE>
<TE>   On the Secret Service, which has jurisdiction over some types of
financial crimes, Ridge said that its training would be "a perfect
match for the new department." And on FEMA, he said, preparing to
respond to terrorist attacks would also help the agency respond to
fires and floods and other natural disasters.</TE>
<TE>   But Ridge did not use those arguments with the crop and livestock
units within the Agriculture Department, an instance when the
administration bowed to protests from powerful farm-state
legislators. Speaking with reporters, Ridge acknowledged that when
divvying up and reshuffling agencies, "some tear lines are easy to
identify," but for others, "it's difficult."</TE>

<HD>Traficant Tries to Stop His Expulsion</HD>
<DH>Congress: The Ohio lawmaker was convicted on federal
corruption charges. His House colleagues will now decide his
political fate.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MEGAN GARVEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Rep. James A. Traficant Jr. (D-Ohio) fought for his political life in
front of the House ethics committee Monday, arguing that his
conviction three months ago on federal corruption and bribery charges
was the culmination of a longtime government vendetta and that his
colleagues should not expel him because of it.</LD>
<LD>   Traficant, 61, defied calls to resign by leaders on Capitol Hill
after his April 11 conviction on all 10 counts of a federal
indictment. The jury found, among other charges, that he had taken
bribes in exchange for political favors and had his legislative staff
shoveling horse stalls at his barn near Youngstown, Ohio, on
government time.</LD>
<LD>   Members of the House Committee on Standards of Official Conduct
heard evidence of Traficant's alleged ethics violations during the
first day of what is expected to be a two-day hearing. Lawyers for
the committee laid out a case against Traficant that paralleled the
charges proven in his nine-week criminal trial.</LD>
<TE>   "The evidence we will show will support such findings," said
Kenneth Kellner, counsel for the ethics committee. "A continuing
pattern and practice of abuse of his office, a pattern that repeated
itself over and over and over again."</TE>
<TE>   The nine-term congressman from a working-class district could be
expelled from Congress by a vote of three-quarters of the 435-member
House--a motion members on both sides of the aisle say would easily
pass and could come as soon as next week.</TE>
<TE>   Traficant would become only the second member expelled by his
peers since the Civil War era. Rep. Michael Myers (D-Pa.) was removed
in 1980 after he was convicted of taking bribes as part of the FBI's
Abscam investigation of congressional corruption.</TE>
<TE>   Traficant was alternately combative and resigned about his future
during the daylong hearing. At one point, he compared the proceedings
to a lynching. At another, he warned he might yet be the first
American elected to Congress from a prison cell.</TE>
<TE>   Federal prosecutors last week asked U.S. District Judge Lesley
Wells to send Traficant to prison for at least seven years at his
sentencing hearing July 30. "Such a pattern of venal, unrepentant
misconduct should not be countenanced," they said. "Justice requires
that it be punished harshly."</TE>
<TE>   Traficant, known for denim suits and 30-year-old bell-bottom
pants, was dressed Monday in an ill-fitting dark suit, gray shirt and
narrow tie.</TE>
<TE>   His speaking style, however, lived up to reviews. As during his
criminal trial, Traficant represented himself during the committee
proceedings. He used his trademark "Beam me up!"--the line that
earned him a cult following among avid C-SPAN viewers--early in the
day in an attempt to portray the government's case against him as
unbelievable.</TE>
<TE>   Congress, he argued, had failed to control the power of the
executive branch, leaving people in fear of their government. He was
targeted, he said, because he wasn't afraid to stand up for his
beliefs.</TE>
<TE>   Traficant sprinkled his one-hour opening statement and later
testimony with vulgarities and bathroom humor and threats of physical
violence against adversaries that he variously whispered and shouted
at committee members who sat quietly watching.</TE>
<TE>   "What the hell?" he said to the crowd during a break. "They're
going to throw me out of here, I might as well take my shot."</TE>
<TE>   His rough language came after committee Chairman Joel Hefley
(R-Colo.) warned everyone present that he would close the hearings to
the public if they were not conducted with the "dignity and decorum
that fit any formal proceeding."</TE>
<TE>   Traficant asked for and received permission to present two
witnesses today. He told members of the committee--which he had once
served as the ranking Democrat--the case against him was "hearsay"
and questioned why there was no fingerprint evidence against him.</TE>
<TE>   He said his witnesses, who were not available Monday, would help
him make his argument. Traficant told committee members--as he did
jurors during his trial--he had been targeted by the FBI and Internal
Revenue Service for 20 years as retribution for successfully
defending himself in 1983 against charges that he took money from the
mob while an elected county sheriff.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm prepared to be expelled. I'm prepared to go to jail because I
didn't do this," Traficant said Monday.</TE>
<TE>   "You've allowed RICO [the federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt
Organizations Act] to be diluted to the point where mothers will be
arrested for colluding to buy Kellogg's breakfast cereal."</TE>

<KH>THE BRITISH OPEN/ THURSDAY-SUNDAY, MUIRFIELD COURSE, SCOTLAND</KH>
<HD>Tough One to Bear</HD>
<DH>Nicklaus' bid for third leg of Slam halted by Trevino at
Muirfield in '72</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>THOMAS BONK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>GULLANE, Scotland</DL>
<LD>The last time anyone had a chance to win golf's Grand Slam going into
the British Open, Jack Nicklaus had put himself in position with
three-shot victories at the Masters in April and at the U.S. Open at
Pebble Beach in June. It was 30 years ago, and Nicklaus was a picture
of steely resolve.</LD>
<LD>   Stockily built, with wavy blond hair, and at 32, at the height of
his powers, Nicklaus set foot on the storied links of Muirfield for
the 1972 British Open.</LD>
<LD>   The city of Edinburgh was 20-some miles away, but what Nicklaus
was trying to do was even further removed from the fabric of reality.
No professional had won all four of the major championships in a
calendar year, although Bobby Jones had won all four of golf's majors
42 years earlier, when two of them were amateur tournaments.</LD>
<TE>   Nicklaus knew history would not be on his side as he walked onto
the course for his practice round, but he was still the heavy
favorite among the British bookmakers. At nearly 2-1, he was the
biggest favorite in the 101-year history of the Open.</TE>
<TE>   Nicklaus was aware of different odds. Before him, others had won
the first two major titles, then faltered in the British Open: Craig
Wood in 1941 and Arnold Palmer in 1960. Ben Hogan had won the Masters
and U.S. Open in 1951, then skipped the British. Hogan also had won
three majors in 1953, but he couldn't compete in the PGA Championship
at Birmingham, Mich., because it overlapped his lone visit to the
British Open, which he won at Carnoustie.</TE>
<TE>   Muirfield's greens were hard and fast in 1972 and the weather was
out of character--warm and breezy instead of cold and rainy.</TE>
<TE>   And, as it turned out, something else was off kilter. Nicklaus
woke up on the Monday morning before the tournament with a sore neck
and didn't feel much better until Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   Even so, he made things interesting. Midway through the fourth
round, Nicklaus was six shots behind Lee Trevino and nearly caught
up, but wound up losing by a shot.</TE>
<TE>   Three decades later, though, Nicklaus blames himself for not
getting one step closer to a possible Grand Slam.</TE>
<TE>   "I think I prevented myself from winning the third," he said.
"There's only one person you can control and that's yourself. If you
don't win, and your game is capable of winning, then it's your fault.
It doesn't make a difference who's there. Lee Trevino beat me by a
shot there. But that didn't have anything to do with it.</TE>
<TE>   "And that's the whole point of the whole thing. Sure, I had my
opportunity coming down the stretch. I remember standing on the 16th
tee in 1966 at Muirfield when I won. I said 'Jack, finish 3-4-4 and
you'll win this golf tournament.' That's par-birdie-par. I finished
3-4-4 and won the golf tournament.</TE>
<TE>   "I stood on the 16th tee in 1972 and I said 'OK, Jack, you're in
the exact same position as you were in '66. You finish 3-4-4 and
you'll win this golf tournament.' I finished 4-5-4 and lost by one
shot.</TE>
<TE>   "It didn't make a difference what Lee Trevino did. It didn't make
any difference what Tony Jacklin did. It's what I did, and that's the
only person you can control."</TE>
<TE>   Nicklaus shot a 66 in the fourth round, which was played Saturday,
but Trevino followed his third-round 66 with a 71 that was just
enough.</TE>
<TE>   Trevino, the defending British Open champion, had shared the
36-hole lead with Jacklin at 141, a shot ahead of Nicklaus, and said
at the midway point that what he was doing wasn't about depriving
Nicklaus of anything.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't come to Scotland to help Nicklaus win any Grand Slam,"
Trevino said. "If I played golf with my wife, I'd try to beat the
daylights out of her."</TE>
<TE>   For the third round, Trevino and Jacklin were paired, Nicklaus and
Gary Player playing ahead of them. Trevino tied for the lead again
when he sank a 15-foot birdie putt at the 14th and followed it with a
30-footer for a birdie at the 15th. At the par-three 16th, Trevino's
nine-iron found a bunker, but he holed his sand shot from a difficult
lie and made another birdie.</TE>
<TE>   Trevino also birdied the 17th, but his second shot at the 18th
went through the green and down a slope. He somehow holed his third
shot, though, for five consecutive birdies and a one-shot lead over
Jacklin.</TE>
<TE>   And Nicklaus, after a 71, was six shots behind Trevino, five
behind Jacklin with 18 holes to go Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   "I remember going to the first hole and telling Jacklin, 'I think
he can catch one of us, but not both of us,' " Trevino said.</TE>
<TE>   He was wrong, Nicklaus having saved his best round for last. He
played the first nine holes in 32 and birdied the 10th and 11th to go
to six under and take the lead.</TE>
<TE>   Seven more holes and the third leg of the Grand Slam would belong
to Nicklaus.</TE>
<TE>   But Trevino got back in front in a flash. At the ninth, he knocked
an iron onto the green and rolled in a long putt for an eagle to move
back ahead. Jacklin also eagled, joining Trevino, one shot better
than Nicklaus.</TE>
<TE>   At the 15th, Nicklaus missed a six-foot birdie putt, then with the
wind in his face at the 16th, he pushed a four-iron and sent the ball
onto a bank left of the green. Nicklaus couldn't get it up and down
from there and took a bogey. He pulled his drive at the 17th and
settled for par.</TE>
<TE>   Trevino says he knew then that it was in his hands.</TE>
<TE>   "When I looked up on the board and Jack bogeyed 16 and didn't
birdie 17, that opened up the door for us."</TE>
<TE>   But it still was hard getting through. Trevino hooked his drive
into a fairway bunker on the 17th, splashed out weakly and sent his
third shot into the rough, more than 125 yards from the hole. His
fourth shot went through the green and stopped on a bank to the left
and the rear of the green.</TE>
<TE>   Jacklin's chip, his third shot, left him 18 feet short, which was
birdie range, so a three-shot turnaround seemed likely. Trevino
thought he was in no position to win, so he played quickly, without
expecting much. He was stunned after he swung his pitching wedge and
followed the ball as it rolled into the hole. Instead of a double
bogey, Trevino had rescued par. Clearly shaken, Jacklin three-putted.</TE>
<TE>   At the 18th, with Nicklaus waiting for a possible playoff, Trevino
drove it straight down the fairway, put his second shot onto the
green and two-putted safely from six feet to win. Jacklin bogeyed the
last and fell to third place, behind Nicklaus.</TE>
<TE>   Said Trevino: "I really believe that if Jack would have parred the
16th hole, [I] wouldn't have beaten him."</TE>
<TE>   Trevino says he's proud of derailing Nicklaus.</TE>
<TE>   "Yeah, naturally, my name is always mentioned. In 1972, Jack was
going for the Grand Slam and Lee Trevino was the guy that stopped
him," he said. "But then, I wished he could have beaten me so I could
have watched him to see what he would have done in [the PGA
Championship at Oakland Hills] in Michigan, playing for the fourth
leg. I guarantee you, if he had won the British, I wouldn't have
played in Michigan. I would have galleried that baby because there
would have been so many people there, they would have knocked the
fences down."</TE>
<TE>   There has been no change in Nicklaus' thinking about the 1972
British Open, either. In fact, in his memoirs, "My Story," with
writer Ken Bowden, published in 1997, Nicklaus wrote, "The
frustration and disappointment were more intense than I care to
remember, even now, a quarter of a century later."</TE>

<HD>No Sign of Relief for Angels Lately</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Bullpen blows another lead in 10-8 loss to Twins
as Anaheim drops into second-place tie with Oakland.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL SHAIKIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MINNEAPOLIS</DL>
<LD>The Angels' clubhouse was quiet, very quiet. In a pennant race, this
was a game that had to be won.</LD>
<LD>   With closer Troy Percival and set-up men Al Levine and Dennis Cook
on the disabled list, the Angel bullpen includes three pitchers who
started the season in the minor leagues and another who started the
season in the rotation. The Angels are trying to patch a relief corps
together for now, and help might be on the way, but the pennant race
might pass them by in the meantime.</LD>
<LD>   Scott Schoeneweis gave up a two-run homer in the seventh inning
and a three-run homer in the eighth, as the Angels blew a 7-1 lead
and lost their third consecutive game, this one 10-8 to the Minnesota
Twins. The Angels fell into a tie with the Oakland Athletics for
second place in the American League West, four games behind the
Seattle Mariners.</LD>
<TE>   The Angels play again today against the Twins, who lead the AL
Central by 10 games. After that are 11 consecutive games against
Seattle and Oakland, followed by seven against the New York Yankees
and Boston Red Sox.</TE>
<TE>   "We all know the next four weeks are going to make our season,"
outfielder Tim Salmon said. "We've got a tough schedule ahead. There
are going to be some tough losses ahead.</TE>
<TE>   "You're playing good teams. You can't always expect to go out and
win every game."</TE>
<TE>   This one was entirely winnable. The Angels took advantage of seven
walks by Minnesota starter Johan Santana, got their first three-hit
game from Troy Glaus since May 2, and John Lackey willed himself
beyond his shaky defense to pitch six innings, giving up five runs
(three earned).</TE>
<TE>   The Twins scored four times in the fifth inning, in part because
of an error by shortstop David Eckstein and because of one of three
wild pitches by Lackey.</TE>
<TE>   But Lackey, who threw five wild pitches in 102 innings at triple-A
Salt Lake, was not helped by Shawn Wooten, catching in place of the
injured Bengie Molina. Wooten failed to block each of the three wild
pitches on the short hop.</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, Schoeneweis inherited an 8-5 lead when he replaced
Lackey to begin the seventh inning. Schoeneweis, sent to the bullpen
last month so that Lackey could start, has pitched splendidly in
relief.</TE>
<TE>   Schoeneweis got the first two outs of the seventh, but Corey
Koskie singled and Torii Hunter hit a fastball for a homer, and the
Twins had cut the lead to 8-7.</TE>
<TE>   Schoeneweis got the first two outs of the eighth inning, but Luis
Rivas and Bobby Kielty singled, and Cristian Guzman hit another
fastball for the game-winning home run.</TE>
<TE>   "I threw the ball as well as I can throw," Schoeneweis said. "It's
just par for the course, pretty much.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll throw those pitches 100 more times, and they won't hit them
out. They're a good-hitting team, but I can't throw the ball much
better."</TE>
<TE>   First baseman Scott Spiezio cautioned that one loss, no matter how
disheartening, would not make or break the season. Look at the
Yankees, he said; closer Mariano Rivera gave up six runs in one
inning Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the Yankees are in first place.</TE>
<TE>   "If you lose too many of these, you're definitely in trouble,"
Spiezio said. "You definitely have to win these types of games."</TE>
<TE>   Manager Mike Scioscia, ever the steady hand, was in no way the
picture of despair. He spoke of the big picture, saying defeat could
turn into victory on another night just as victory turned into defeat
Monday night.</TE>
<TE>   Still, there is a weak spot on the club right now. Of the
relievers on the opening day roster, only two--Lou Pote and Ben
Weber--are on the active roster today.</TE>
<TE>   "All in all, the components on our club are fine," Scioscia said.
"In this little time frame, there's a void in our bullpen. We're
going to have to work around that."</TE>

<LD>   What: "Game, Set, Match: A Tennis Book for the Mind"</LD>
<TE>   Authors: Charlie Jones and Kim Doren</TE>
<TE>   Publisher: Andrews McMeel</TE>
<TE>   Price: $14.95</TE>
<TE>   Much of tennis is simply reflex, but there also is a mental aspect
to the game. That is what is dealt with in this 200-page book, which
is a compilation of advice from many of the biggest names in the
sport.</TE>
<TE>   Jones, a veteran sportscaster, and Doren, a motivational speech
writer, have collaborated on four other books, including "Be the
Ball: A Golf Instructional Book for the Mind."</TE>
<TE>   Golf may be more of a mental game than tennis because you have
more time to think between shots, but one's psyche plays a big role
in tennis as well.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not like golf, where you're playing the course," Tony
Trabert says.</TE>
<TE>   "You are mano a mano. That's part of why it is a mind game."</TE>
<TE>   Mark McCormack, chairman and CEO of International Management
Group, notes: "In tennis, when you're on the court in a match, you're
hitting the ball 5% of the time, and 95% of the time you're either in
changeovers or between points. The flaw players have is they spend
99% of their time practicing the 5% and none practicing the 95%."</TE>
<TE>   Pam Shriver offers: "Once you understand your fears, your
emotions, it's easier to conquer them."</TE>
<TE>   Charlie Pasarell, noting everybody gets nervous, passes along some
advice from Pancho Gonzalez: "To be able to use that nervousness and
channel that nervousness in a positive way, to make yourself stronger
and faster, to make yourself think clearer, is really something you
have to work at."</TE>
<TE>   Regis Philbin readily admits he doesn't handle the frustrations of
the game very well, that he is always throwing his racket.</TE>
<TE>   He talks about a game he had 30 years ago at a friend's house and
he threw his racket on a neighbor's roof. "To this day, you can still
see my racket sitting up there."</TE>

<LD>   The Dodgers, losers of three of four games against the Arizona
Diamondbacks to start the second half, remain a half-game ahead of
the Diamondbacks, who lost Monday to the San Francisco Giants. The
Giants are 1 1/2 games behind the Dodgers.</LD>
<TE>   Dodger Manager Jim Tracy said he wasn't worried about his team's
recent fortunes.</TE>
<TE>   "You see this happen to a lot of clubs that have played very good
baseball to this point," he said.</TE>
<TE>   St. Louis right-hander Travis Smith beat the Dodgers for the
second time in 12 days and Jim Edmonds and Eduardo Perez hit home
runs for the Cardinals, who lead the NL Central by 3 1/2 games.</TE>
<TE>   Edmonds also quelled a Dodger rally in the sixth inning by
throwing out Cesar Izturis at the plate.</TE>
<TE>   "We had some bad at-bats early in the game," Tracy said. "We
created three real good opportunities in the first few innings of the
game and came up empty-handed."</TE>
<TE>   But the Dodgers saved their biggest missed opportunity for their
final at-bat.</TE>
<TE>   Trailing, 4-2, the Dodgers entered the ninth against Cardinal
closer Jason Isringhausen, who replaced setup man Mike Timlin after
two scoreless innings.</TE>
<TE>   Pinch-hitter Alex Cora led off with a single to right, and the
Dodgers got a break when pinch-hitter Dave Hansen hit a ground ball
back to Isringhausen, who threw wildly to second for an error that
put two runners on.</TE>
<TE>   Dave Roberts, however, popped up a high 97-mph fastball to third
baseman Placido Polanco on a sacrifice bunt attempt, and Isringhausen
got Paul Lo Duca to hit a ground ball to Polanco who started a double
play that earned Isringhausen his 22nd save.</TE>
<TE>   "The bottom line is, I didn't get it done," said Roberts, whom
Tracy characterized as one of the best bunters in the majors. "I was
the right man for the right spot in that situation.... I didn't do a
job I was supposed to do."</TE>
<TE>   Dodger left-hander Omar Daal (7-5) gave up four runs in six
innings--a far better outing than his last start when he gave up
eight runs and eight hits in 3 2/3 innings in a 12-6 loss at St.
Louis on July 7.</TE>
<TE>   But it was not good enough against Smith (3-0), who began the
season with two innings of major league experience and was recalled
from triple-A Memphis on June 27 after the June 22 death of Darryl
Kile.</TE>
<TE>   Smith gave up one run and seven hits in six innings against the
Dodgers in a 3-2 victory July 4 at St. Louis, a game played in
96-degree heat. Monday, he gave up two runs and nine hits in 5 2/3
innings before giving way to Mike Matthews.</TE>
<TE>   "He knows how to pitch," Lo Duca said of Smith. "He has four
pitches he can throw for a strike at any time, and it's tough to hit
a guy like that. He's done it to us twice so he's doing something
right."</TE>
<TE>   The Cardinals took a 2-0 lead in the first when Edmonds followed
Polanco's one-out double into the left-field gap with a towering home
run into the right-field pavilion. It was Edmonds' 18th homer and
marked the 12th time in 13 games that the Cardinals have homered.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers wasted a chance to do some damage in the third after
Roberts and Lo Duca started the inning with singles and Lo Duca moved
to second on a wild pitch.</TE>
<TE>   Smith, however, struck out Shawn Green, then got Brian Jordan to
hit a ground ball back to the mound. Smith fielded the ball and threw
to catcher Mike DiFelice, who tagged out Roberts at the plate.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers loaded the bases when Smith hit Eric Karros with a
pitch, but Adrian Beltre hit a ground ball to shortstop Edgar
Renteria, who stepped on second base for an inning-ending out.</TE>
<TE>   The Cardinals increased their lead to 3-0 in the fourth when
Renteria led off with a walk, moved to second base on a passed ball,
advanced to third on a sacrifice by Eli Marrero and scored on a
double by DiFelice.</TE>
<TE>   Perez led off the sixth with his sixth homer to increase the lead
to 4-0.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers pulled to within two runs in the sixth when Beltre
followed Karros' leadoff single with a shot into the left-field
pavilion for his ninth homer.</TE>
<TE>   Mark Grudzielanek kept the rally going with his third single of
the game, but he was forced at second on a ground ball to first
baseman Tino Martinez. Izturis stole second, and looked as if he was
going to score on Roberts' two-out single to center.</TE>
<TE>   But Edmonds fielded the ball and fired a throw to the plate.
DiFelice blocked the plate with his left foot, preventing Izturis
from getting a clean shot at scoring, and tagged him on the back for
an out that ended the inning.</TE>

<HD>Course Keeps Stiff Upper Chip</HD>
<DH>Golf: Muirfield has no women members and no pro shop, but
it does have a lot of history.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>THOMAS BONK</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>GULLANE, Scotland</DL>
<LD>Muirfield, designed by Old Tom Morris, has been the site of the 1892
British Open and 13 others since, which makes it one of the most
famous golf courses in the world.</LD>
<LD>   It is also one of the stuffiest.</LD>
<LD>   In fact, over the years, Muirfield has built such a solid
reputation for snobbery that monocles are sold in the pro shop, silk
kerchiefs are flown on the flagsticks and they use butlers instead of
caddies. All right, those are wild exaggerations, but the truth is,
Muirfield is to golf clubs what starch is to dress shirts.</LD>
<TE>   To maintain the kind of atmosphere Muirfield desires, there is no
pro shop, because there is no pro. No souvenirs, either. Only balls,
tees and a guide to the course are available, so if you're looking
for that special Muirfield logo cashmere sweater, it just isn't
available.</TE>
<TE>   There are no female members at Muirfield, and no junior program
either.</TE>
<TE>   In the exclusionary department, Muirfield isn't much different
from Royal St. George's and Royal Troon, the next two British Open
sites that also are male-only clubs. The Royal and Ancient Golf Club
of St. Andrews, which runs the Open Championship, is a male-only
club, as well, but R&amp;A Secretary Peter Dawson sees no problem there.</TE>
<TE>   "I honestly don't think social engineering is part of our role,"
he said. "We're here to hold the Open Championship and will do it on
the best links possible."</TE>
<TE>   So there.</TE>
<TE>   That policy is only a small part of the story of this club,
located not far from Edinburgh and the Firth of Forth.</TE>
<TE>   It's an old story, but Muirfield is an old place, rich in
tradition and history, exhibiting all the snootiness and downright
quirkiness that you might expect from the jewel of the Honourable
Company of Edinburgh Golfers, the links at Muirfield.</TE>
<TE>   First of all, the Honourable Company of Edinburgh Golfers--the
members at Muirfield wear badges bearing the initials "HCEG"--is
actually the oldest golf club in the world, or so the HCEG says.
There is no doubt that the HCEG produced golf's first set of rules,
or that it is 10 years older than the Society of St. Andrews Golfers,
even though the Royal and Ancient gets most of the historical
attention, plaudits, clout and recognition.</TE>
<TE>   The two golf groups still feud. In 1992, the last time it staged
an Open Championship, Muirfield wouldn't allow the R&amp;A to build
bleachers at the 18th green because the structure might have
obstructed the view of the members in the clubhouse.</TE>
<TE>   The British Open began in 1860 and the event came to Muirfield for
the first time 32 years later, a year after Morris had designed the
"new" course. According to legend, the new course at Muirfield wasn't
that well received 110 years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Andrew Kirkaldy of St. Andrews is supposed to have snipped, "It's
naught but an auld water meddie. I'm glad I'm going home."</TE>
<TE>   In 1922, Harry Colt redesigned the course, using a new 50-acre
track north of the course, expanding it while still keeping Morris'
routing plan.</TE>
<TE>   The first nine holes circle clockwise, the back nine
counterclockwise, but in a circle inside the circle made by the first
nine holes. If that sounds confusing, it isn't, as long as you have a
clock.</TE>
<TE>   What's confusing is the wind, which usually blows from the west,
and can cause problems because there are never more than three holes
going in any one direction.</TE>
<TE>   In his book "Open Championship Golf Courses of Britain," Keith
Mackie described Muirfield's reputation:</TE>
<TE>   "More than any other golf club, Muirfield keeps the world at bay;
its feet are firmly planted in the past and there are guardians at
the gates to keep uninvited guests and, so far as possible, the 20th
century in general, at bay."</TE>
<TE>   Proof? Go back to 1980 at Muirfield, where Tom Watson had won his
third British Open title and later that night decided to get back on
the links with Ben Crenshaw, who had finished third.</TE>
<TE>   Crenshaw and Watson had played the 10th and 18th holes when a man
saw what was happening and ran up to them, waving a flashlight.</TE>
<TE>   "This is no playground!" said Captain P.W.T. "Paddy" Hanmer, Royal
Navy (Ret.), and most important, secretary of the Honorauble Company
of Edinburgh Golfers. "I'll see to it that you are banished from this
course forever!"</TE>
<TE>   The miscreants were scolded like children, then shooed away.</TE>
<TE>   Hanmer's reign lasted from 1968-83 and he ruled with an iron fist.
Jack Nicklaus once asked to play and Hanmer turned him down cold. The
same thing happened to Payne Stewart. Part of Paddy's job also called
for him to eject visiting players who were playing too slow.</TE>
<TE>   But then, Hanmer sprang from a long line of professional
party-poopers, a group that also included Col. Brian Evans-Lombe, a
retired cavalry officer who was appointed secretary in 1947.
According to Muirfield lore, Evans-Lombe noticed someone he didn't
know in the smoking room. The secretary asked the man's identity. The
man told him his name, saying that he had been a club member for 20
years.</TE>
<TE>   "In that event," Evans-Lombe said, "you should come more often.
Then I would recognize you."</TE>
<TE>   Before the first round of the 1948 Open at Muirfield, Masters
champion Claude Harmon's playing partner suddenly withdrew. A
substitute was located in the clubhouse, retired Maj. W. H.
Callender, who remarked, "I'd be delighted to give the old fellow a
game."</TE>
<TE>   When reporters learned that something unusual was happening, they
found Callender on the third fairway, giving Harmon advice on his
swing--"Gripped down the shave, a short swing controls the ball more
easily in the east wind."</TE>
<TE>   Some of the greatest players in the game have won at Muirfield.
Nicklaus thought so much of the place, he named his home course in
Ohio after it--Muirfield Village. Nicklaus, who saw the course for
the first time in 1959, when he was a 19-year-old amateur playing in
the Walker Cup matches, won the 1966 British Open at Muirfield.</TE>
<TE>   But Nicklaus isn't the only great to have stood transfixed on the
hallowed ground and have his name linked for all time with venerable
Muirfield. Harry Vardon won here. So did Ted Ray, Walter Hagen, Gary
Player, Watson and Lee Trevino. Along the way, Muirfield never grew
into anything other than what it is, what it was, what it always has
been--a strange and wonderful place where strange and wonderful
things happen.</TE>
<TE>   The famous British golf writer Bernard Darwin, whose "Golf Courses
of the British Isles" was published in 1910, found Muirfield
"thoroughly difficult," although quite wonderful.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a fine view of the sea and a delightful sea wood, with
the trees all bent and twisted by the wind; then, too, it is a
solitary and peaceful spot, and a great haunt of the curlews, whom
one may see hovering over a championship crowd and crying eerily amid
a religious silence."</TE>
<TE>   A curlew is a long-beaked, small-headed shorebird, so keep your
eyes open for them. You might want to stay alert for just about
anything at Muirfield, though.</TE>
<TE>   Muirfield might be the most politically incorrect of major
championship courses. Women can't be members and are not allowed in
the clubhouse. Women aren't really welcome to even enter the front
gate, although since 1904, they have been permitted to play the
course. There are no women's tees, though.</TE>
<TE>   When the club's kitchens underwent remodeling several years ago,
members took their meals at the nearby Greywalls hotel. Without being
prompted, Greywalls followed club rules and refused to seat women for
lunch.</TE>

<LD>I was thrilled the Dodgers were lucky enough to beat Arizona on
Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   During my vacation I spent a lot of time watching the Lifetime
channel, getting in touch with my more sensitive side, so I didn't
want to return to work on my first day and write about the choking
dogs in Chavez Ravine.</LD>
<LD>   I'll get to Phil Mickelson, of course, as the week goes on.</LD>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I SENT the wife and one of my daughters to Hawaii the last week,
so I could stay home and enjoy my vacation. I have two daughters, but
this is the one most likely to suggest I be cremated as quickly as
possible after I've taken my last breath.</TE>
<TE>   Obviously, she gets along very well with the wife.</TE>
<TE>   I began each afternoon when I awoke with my morning newspaper, and
noticed everyone seemed to be gushing about the Dodgers while I was
away. Columnist Diane Pucin even made the guys sound heroic, writing
"the Dodgers refused to give in Sunday."</TE>
<TE>   A day earlier columnist Bill Plaschke had written the Dodgers had
surrendered first place after three losses to Arizona, so I was a
little confused about who was and wasn't giving up. I'd hate to think
one of our columnists is that far off base.</TE>
<TE>   Anyway, I came back from vacation to find out for myself.
Coincidentally, the wife and daughter came home at the same time.</TE>
<TE>   On the drive to Dodger Stadium, I heard a taped radio interview
with Eric Karros, who was saying Sunday's victory was a mighty big
one because this will get the people, who are waiting for a Dodger
collapse, off the team's back.</TE>
<TE>   I gave that some thought because I'm now a thoughtful guy. Before
this little break, I had been thinking a "Choke Collar" night would
be a great giveaway later this month to mark the Dodgers' collapse. I
forget myself for a moment, asking Manager Jim Tracy before the game
what would happen first--Mickelson winning a major or the Dodgers
winning a playoff game?</TE>
<TE>   Maybe I was taking the wrong approach. I called several local
psychologists to seek their advice, and maybe replace Dodger ridicule
with Dodger support. The first guy, through a spokesman, told me the
doctor was busy. I offered to call after Oprah went off the air, but
she hung up on me. Do you think USC President Steven Sample's wife
works as a receptionist for a Fullerton psychologist?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   DR. MARC SHATZ, a Beverly Hills' sports psychologist, apparently
did not graduate from USC. He was very nice. "Listen, Karros' concern
ought not to be whom is getting on his back, but whether he's hearing
footsteps behind him.</TE>
<TE>   "I say keep at him; keep at all of them. Some are going to show
they are champions and others are going to feel the stress and
choke."</TE>
<TE>   I didn't mention Adrian Beltre's name.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. William Vollero did. "Anything new on that front? Is he still
here?"</TE>
<TE>   I told him Beltre is still here, and I hope for many years to come
and he sounded dejected. I asked if I could help, but he explained he
has been a lifelong Red Sox fan. At least that makes him an expert
when it comes to talking about chokers.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think a pro athlete is going to take the concept of
choking very well, never allowing that thought to happen, and for you
to suggest it, I'm pretty sure you're going to get the cold
shoulder," said Vollero, who works in Pasadena. "If you could get to
a couple of people and loosen them up, and in turn they loosen up the
team, that might be very productive."</TE>
<TE>   I vowed to give it a try when I got the chance to talk to the guys
after Monday night's game. But sitting here Monday night I watched
the Cardinals go up 2-0 over the Dodgers in the first, 3-0 by the
fourth and 4-0 before L.A. made it 4-2 in the sixth. The Dodgers put
the tying runs on base in the ninth, Dave Roberts popped up a bunt,
and what would he have done had Maury Wills not been working with
him? Paul Lo Duca hit into a double play, and the choking dogs had
lost another one.</TE>
<TE>   "Mickelson," said Shatz, and I'm not sure I can argue.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   FOR THE last few weeks, James Van Der Beek, better known to my
daughters as Dawson Leery from TV's "Dawson's Creek," has been
hanging around with the Dodgers as he prepares to write a baseball
movie.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers have given Van Der Beek a locker in their clubhouse
and he dresses in Dodger blue for batting practice, shagging balls in
the outfield. If the pint-sized actor is going to put himself in the
movie, he better start taking some steroids.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   AFTER PLAYERS' union boss Donald Fehr spoke to the Dodgers before
the game, he shared a good laugh with Kevin Brown. Those are two
funny guys, all right.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   THE SAN DIEGO Hall of Champions paid tribute to Ted Williams on
Monday, and Dick Enberg closed the ceremony with a plea to Williams'
son: "John Henry, please do the right thing and let the old fisherman
go back to the sea."</TE>
<TE>   Just in case you were wondering, I asked: Those in attendance said
there were no ice sculptures on display.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   THE NFL wanted 70,000 seats for January's Super Bowl, and San
Diego can't deliver, so the city will pay the NFL $1.6 million in
lost ticket revenue. Why not move the game here, since the Chargers
will be coming to L.A. soon?</TE>
<TE>   Coliseum General Manager Pat Lynch said he'd be willing to work
around a USC women's basketball game slated for that day in the
Sports Arena.</TE>
<TE>   Rose Bowl GM Daryl Dunn said, "we don't have any USC women's games
to conflict with the Super Bowl, but USC Athletic Director Mike
Garrett traditionally plays on the golf course here."</TE>
<TE>   That'd be putting 100,000 people in harm's way, ruling out the
Rose Bowl.</TE>

<HD>Stronach Acquires Pimlico</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The tentacles of Frank Stronach's far-reaching horse racing combine
have extended into Maryland, where Magna Entertainment's majority
purchase of Pimlico and another track gives the Canadian-based
company control of the Preakness, the middle jewel in the Triple
Crown.</LD>
<LD>   Stronach, one of a dwindling number of industry leaders still
bullish about live racing, has been rapidly buying tracks since his
first purchase, Santa Anita in December 1998. The addition of Pimlico
and the Preakness will give the Austrian-born industrialist more
leverage in a sport that he long has felt has been crippled by
misdirection.</LD>
<LD>   Stronach's purchase of Pimlico and its sister track, Laurel Park,
was announced Monday in Baltimore, where officials of Magna and the
De Francis family spelled out a $117.5-million deal that was months
in the making. For a 51% interest in Pimlico and 58% of Laurel, Magna
is paying $50.6 million in cash, plus $18.4 million to Joe De Francis
and his sister Karin for an option to buy them out in four years.
Should that happen, the De Francises would receive an additional
$18.3 million. Magna is also assuming the two tracks' $30.2 million
in debt. Included in the deal are three off-track betting parlors and
a training facility at a closed racetrack in Bowie, Md.</LD>
<TE>   The De Francises, who assumed control of Pimlico and Laurel after
their father, Frank De Francis, died in 1989, have shopped the tracks
before, coming close to accepting an R.D. Hubbard-led deal on behalf
of Hollywood Park several years ago and more recently resisting
overtures from Churchill Downs.</TE>
<TE>   Churchill Downs, which now owns Hollywood Park and four other
tracks, has been out-maneuvered by Stronach in bidding for Santa
Anita, Gulfstream Park and Pimlico. Instead of owning the first two
races in the Triple Crown--the Kentucky Derby and the
Preakness--Churchill, through its membership in Triple Crown
Productions, is now a partner of Stronach's, which could result in an
uneasy alliance.</TE>
<TE>   "This should make it fun," said Jim McAlpine, Magna's chief
executive officer. "There should be some interesting board meetings.
But we all have a common interest--the growth of racing--and if we
work together, we should all prosper."</TE>
<TE>   The last race in the Triple Crown, the Belmont Stakes, is run at
Belmont Park, which is operated by the New York Racing Assn. Tom
Meeker, chief executive officer of Churchill Downs, couldn't be
reached for comment, but Barry Schwartz, chairman of the NYRA, said:</TE>
<TE>   "The [television and sponsorship] contracts for the Triple Crown
are in place, and the ground rules have been set. I wouldn't think
[Stronach] would want to upset what we have. We have no fears."</TE>
<TE>   Schwartz said that the Triple Crown is happy with the multi-year
contracts it has with NBC and Visa USA, the sponsor of a $5-million
bonus that would be paid if a horse swept the races.</TE>
<TE>   Although the Preakness drew a crowd of 101,138 this year, second
highest in its history, and the TV ratings were the highest in 12
years, the race is considered the ugly duckling of the Triple Crown.
Pimlico, which opened in 1870 and, after Saratoga in upstate New
York, is the second oldest track in the country, has become an
eyesore, long overdue for renovations, and its neglected barn area is
shabby and ramshackle.</TE>
<TE>   McAlpine said that there were no plans to move the Preakness,
which had its 127th running this year, to another track. Stronach is
unpredictable and daring, but it would be unlikely that he could move
the Preakness even if he wanted to. The state legislature has the
right of first refusal to the race if it were to be sold and moved
out of Maryland.</TE>
<TE>   The addition of more than 200 racing dates in Maryland gives Magna
almost 1,800 racing dates at its 14 tracks. Already, Magna tracks
account for about one-third of the national betting on thoroughbreds.
But Stronach's off-track betting arm--and a promised racing TV
network which, McAlpine said, will be unveiled later this year--need
a quality year-round menu to succeed. Early in the year, Magna has
the high-profile programs at Santa Anita and Gulfstream, but when
they close off-track betting--including that by telephone and
Internet--drops off.</TE>
<TE>   Magna Entertainment's stock, which has a 52-week high of $10.25,
was off 6% Monday, closing at $6.05.</TE>
<TE>   The 69-year-old Stronach has first-hand knowledge of Pimlico. He
won the 2000 Preakness with Red Bullet.</TE>
<TE>   "This is an important milestone in our strategic program of
growing Magna Entertainment's racing operations throughout North
America," Stronach said in a statement Monday. "We are excited about
the future prospects of Maryland racing and look forward to working
closely with the De Francis family."</TE>
<TE>   Along the way, the De Francises had taken on several partners.
Frank De Francis led a group that bought Laurel for $16 million in
1984. Two years later, De Francis bought Pimlico for $30 million. In
recent years, minority partners sought to sell their interest, but
possible sales of the tracks were stymied because the De Francis
children wanted to retain their management roles. Monday's
announcement said that Joe De Francis would remain chief executive
officer and his sister would stay on as executive vice president.</TE>
<TE>   Competing with nearby states whose racetracks have prospered
because of revenues from legalized slot-machine gambling, De Francis
has been unsuccessful in getting slots approved in Maryland. Other
than the Preakness, Pimlico struggles, offering a second-rate stakes
program and little in the way of customer amenities. Without the
Preakness, it has been said, the track would not show a profit.
Average daily attendance, which includes the bettors who attend the
satellite facility at the track closed to live racing, is less than
8,000.</TE>
<TE>   "Regarding the possibility of slots in Maryland, I gave up
handicapping politicians a long time ago," Magna's McAlpine said.
"Whether there are slots or not was not a significant issue in our
going ahead with the deal. We liked the fact that the Preakness and
Maryland racing are important symbols of our industry."</TE>
<TE>   Stronach has been criticized by shareholders and industry leaders
for paying too much for racetrack properties, and there are those who
say that he overspent in Maryland.</TE>
<TE>   "They spent a lot of money for what they got," said Schwartz of
the NYRA. "Those properties have no value, other than the Preakness.
Maryland just doesn't have the greatest racing anymore."</TE>

<HD>It's About Time for Armstrong</HD>
<DH>Cycling: He finishes second to Botero in test against clock
and moves from eighth to second in overall standings.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KEITH B. RICHBURG</AU>
<BD>WASHINGTON POST</BD>
<DL>PARIS</DL>
<LD>If there was any thought that this year's Tour de France would be a
monotonous one-man show, it was dispelled Monday on the wind-swept
coast of Brittany, where Tour favorite Lance Armstrong found himself
in the unusual position of coming in second in a direct test of speed
and strength.</LD>
<LD>   And Monday it was a Colombian, Santiago Botero, a rider with
Kelme, who frustrated Armstrong in a pre-mountain time trial for the
first time since 1999.</LD>
<LD>   Racing only against the clock, relying on his own speed, Armstrong
finished the windy, 32.25-mile course from Lanester to Lorient in an
impressive 1 hour 2 minutes 29 seconds--impressive, but still 11
seconds behind first-place finisher Botero.</LD>
<TE>   The day's excitement was over whether Armstrong could beat
Botero's time. At the halfway point, with the two virtually tied,
French television announcers began treating Monday's race as if it
would itself decide the entire Tour or at least add a dose of
suspense.</TE>
<TE>   When Armstrong clocked in 11 seconds behind Botero, one announcer
shouted, "He's been beaten! He's been beaten!"</TE>
<TE>   The second-place finish was still enough to move Armstrong up to
second place in the overall standings, behind Igor Gonzalez de
Galdeano, who finished fourth Monday but kept the yellow leader's
jersey. And in two days, the race moves into the grueling mountain
stages, to the Pyrenees, where Armstrong in the past has dominated
his rivals by opening up huge leads that opponents found
insurmountable.</TE>
<TE>   But this year's race promises to be anything but an easy ride for
the three-time Tour winner looking to become the first American to
make it four in a row.</TE>
<TE>   Botero is a climber, and he has put Armstrong on notice that he
intends to continue his challenge in the mountains. In addition, the
Spanish team riders--also including climbers--had been saying even
before the Tour that Armstrong did not appear as strong as he did in
2001.</TE>
<TE>   "The Tour has changed," said Gonzalez de Galdeano. "Armstrong is
not so strong in the trials as he was last year, but he remains my
No. 1 opponent."</TE>
<TE>   Botero was savoring his victory--however limited it may be.</TE>
<TE>   "I was highly motivated for that time trial," Botero said. "I'm
going to see how I feel in the first stage of the Pyrenees, and then
anything can happen."</TE>
<TE>   Armstrong goes to the mountain stages still the favorite, but
without the psychological boost of an individual time trial victory
under his belt. Equally important, his rivals may now have a boost of
confidence in believing Armstrong may be human after all.</TE>
<TE>   In 1999, Armstrong beat Alex Zulle in a pre-mountain individual
time trial by 58 seconds.</TE>
<TE>   There was no pre-mountain individual trial in 2000, and last year,
Armstrong bested his closest opponent, Jan Ullrich, by one minute,
before going on to win his third consecutive Tour--leaving the second
spot for Ullrich.</TE>
<TE>   Ullrich is out of this year's race because of knee problems. But
in a pre-Tour interview, Armstrong predicted that new challengers
would emerge to take Ullrich's place.</TE>
<TE>   Monday, Armstrong was sanguine in conceding defeat. He praised his
rival, and he maintained the serene confidence he has shown since the
pre-Tour days.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought that if we were sure to lose the Tour, we would lose it
in the first week," Armstrong said. "To be basically at the same time
as them, I consider that to be limited damage.</TE>
<TE>   "At first, I was disappointed I did not win the stage and take the
yellow jersey. It was not a good day for me. But it's not a surprise
that Botero won."</TE>
<TE>   Armstrong's overall time was lowered because of a crash on
Saturday that knocked 27 seconds off his time. Without that tangle
with a teammate, he would be the overall leader.</TE>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ted Lilly made an outstanding first impression for the Oakland
Athletics.</LD>
<LD>   The left-hander did not give up a hit for 4 2/3 innings in his
Oakland debut as the A's beat the Tampa Bay Devil Rays, 4-0, Monday
night at St. Petersburg, Fla.</LD>
<LD>   Lilly, who was acquired from the New York Yankees on July 5 as
part of a three-team, seven-player trade, didn't allow a hit until
John Flaherty singled to left with two out in the fifth inning. He
left after the first two batters reached in the seventh.</LD>
<TE>   "Fantastic," Oakland Manager Art Howe said. "And for such a long
layoff, that was an outstanding performance." Lilly hadn't pitched
since June 29.</TE>
<TE>   In all, Lilly allowed three hits with four strikeouts and two
walks.</TE>
<TE>   "I felt pretty good throughout the game," Lilly said. "I wasn't
sure how long I was going to be out there, so I didn't try to
overthrow and I think that's one of the things that was effective for
me."</TE>
<TE>   Chad Bradford, Mike Venafro and Billy Koch finished the
four-hitter.</TE>
<TE>   Miguel Tejada had two RBIs for Oakland, which has won eight of 11.</TE>
<TE>   Toronto 8, New York 5--Chris Woodward homered at Toronto and the
Blue Jays held on for their fourth straight win.</TE>
<TE>   Yankee starter Orlando Hernandez (5-3) was ejected in the seventh
inning after hitting Carlos Delgado with a pitch. Three pitches
earlier, Hernandez threw behind Delgado. The Blue Jays slugger took a
step toward the mound and screamed at Hernandez. Yankee Manager Joe
Torre also was tossed.</TE>
<TE>   Toronto starter Steve Parris hit Jason Giambi and Chris Widger
early in the game.</TE>
<TE>   Detroit 4, Boston 3--Brandon Inge's infield single in the 11th
inning at Detroit gave the Red Sox their fourth straight loss.</TE>
<TE>   Inge had his first career four-RBI game. He broke an 0-for-15
slump by hitting a two-run homer in the seventh, and tied the score
at 3-3 with a sacrifice fly off Ugueth Urbina in the ninth.</TE>
<TE>   Cleveland 7, Chicago 1--Rookie Jason Phillips got his first major
league victory, taking a shutout into the eighth inning at Cleveland.</TE>
<TE>   Making just his second big league start and first at Jacobs Field,
Phillips, 28, gave up seven hits in 7 2/3 innings. He walked three,
struck out two and got 14 out on grounders.</TE>
<TE>   Baltimore 6, Seattle 5--Mike Bordick had three hits, including a
three-run homer, as the Orioles rallied from a four-run deficit at
Baltimore.</TE>
<TE>   Bordick doubled and scored in the third inning, homered in the
fourth and singled in the sixth. In addition to tying his season high
in hits and lifting his batting average nine points to .242, the
shortstop extended his run of errorless games to 73.</TE>
<TE>   Kansas City 8-6, Texas 6-4--A day after tying the team's
single-game record with seven RBIs, Raul Ibanez drove in six more as
the Royals swept a doubleheader at Kansas City, Mo.</TE>
<TE>   Ibanez hit a bases-loaded triple in the first inning of the
opener.</TE>
<TE>   In the second game, Ibanez snapped a 4-4 tie with a two-run single
in the seventh. He also doubled home a run in the first.</TE>
<TE>   Ibanez set a team record with 13 RBIs in three games.</TE>
<TE>   Roberto Hernandez picked up saves in both games, and has 16 in 20
opportunities.</TE>
<TE>   Luis Alicea, who had four singles, and Carlos Beltran, who had two
doubles and a single, each scored three runs for Kansas City in the
second game.</TE>

<KH>ANGEL REPORT</KH>
<HD>Stoneman Not in Rush to Deal</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bill Shaikin</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>MINNEAPOLIS</DL>
<LD>As bargaining positions go, Bill Stoneman could hardly be in a worse
one.</LD>
<LD>   The Angel general manager already was trying to trade for bullpen
help, half the team's relievers went on the disabled list within the
last 18 days and the Angels blew a 7-1 lead Monday.</LD>
<LD>   So, with the trading deadline 15 days away, you can't blame
opposing general managers for asking Stoneman to give up two or three
of his best prospects and pick up a veteran with a fat contract too.</LD>
<TE>   The Angels play 11 consecutive games against Seattle and Oakland,
starting Wednesday, and their pennant chances could diminish
considerably if they lose too many of those. Perhaps Stoneman ought
to pay a steeper price to get help now rather than wait to see if he
can drive a better bargain closer to the deadline.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know that that's the key to doing something," Stoneman
said. "If I wanted to pony up one of our big-time players, I could
hurry up and get something done."</TE>
<TE>   Translation: The Angels do not wish to trade their top
prospects--first baseman Casey Kotchman, catcher Jeff Mathis and
pitchers Chris Bootcheck, Bobby Jenks, John Lackey and Francisco
Rodriguez. They do not wish to pick up a fat contract. They might
eventually yield on one issue or the other, but not yet, and not
both.</TE>
<TE>   Stoneman said he is working with roughly 10 to 12 trade proposals,
some initiated by the Angels and some by other teams.</TE>
<TE>   He also said he might do nothing, with Al Levine expected to be
activated Saturday, closer Troy Percival expected to be activated in
two weeks and Rodriguez overmatching triple-A hitters and forcing the
Angels to consider promoting him.</TE>
<TE>   "It might be the better answers are within our own organization,"
Stoneman said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   An examination Monday revealed that reliever Dennis Cook has a
torn labrum and partially torn rotator cuff in his left shoulder.</TE>
<TE>   Cook, who is leaning toward retirement after the season, initially
told the Angels he would undergo surgery, which would have ended his
season. He reconsidered later Monday and said he would try to
rehabilitate the shoulder, which is his only chance to pitch again
this season.</TE>
<TE>   Percival visited the Grossman Burn Center in Sherman Oaks on
Monday, where a specialist examined his infected left foot.</TE>
<TE>   The infection appears to be gone, thanks to antibiotics, but the
Angels put Percival on the disabled list because doctors were
concerned an infection might recur before the abrasion could fully
heal.</TE>

<HD>Irabu Develops Clots in Lung</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Texas closer Hideki Irabu was hospitalized Monday at Kansas City,
Mo., with small blood clots in his lungs. Irabu was taken to St.
Luke's Hospital by assistant trainer Ray Ramirez after complaining of
chest pains and shortness of breath.</LD>
<LD>   He is expected to be hospitalized for two to three days before
returning to Texas.</LD>
<LD>   Irabu was given medication and blood thinners to dissolve the
clots and was scheduled for additional tests to determine where the
blood clots formed.</LD>
<TE>   "I saw him at 6 in the morning and he looked great and his spirits
were good," Ranger Manager Jerry Narron said. "I know he'll be on
some type of blood thinner for a while. I don't know when he'll be
able to pitch again.</TE>
<TE>   "It is serious. With the death of Darryl Kile, I don't think
anybody is going to do anything but be sure he is healthy. Baseball
is secondary."</TE>
<TE>   Irabu has 16 saves and a 3-8 record with a 5.74 earned-run average
in 38 games. He was put on the 15-day disabled list, retroactive to
Saturday. The Rangers also put outfielder Rusty Greer on the disabled
list because of a back injury. They recalled pitchers Rob Bell and
Joaquin Benoit from triple-A Oklahoma.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The former minority partners of the Montreal Expos intend to file
a lawsuit charging Commissioner Bud Selig and former team owner
Jeffrey Loria with fraud. The 14 owners called a news conference for
today to announce the lawsuit, to be filed in federal court in Miami
under the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, a
person close to the lawyers for the minority partners said on the
condition he not be identified.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Jim Warfield, a popular trainer for more than 30 years with the
Cleveland Indians, collapsed at Jacobs Field and was taken to a
hospital.... St. Louis pitcher Rick Ankiel, who has thrown only 24
innings in the major leagues since his record wildness in the 2000
playoffs, will not throw again for at least eight more weeks because
of tendinitis in his left elbow.</TE>

<LD>Mitch Albom of the Detroit Free Press, responding to a string of bad
publicity surrounding baseball, says it isn't the same game he grew
up watching.</LD>
<LD>   "As a kid, I worked in a baseball stadium. I arrived hours before
the game. I saw the sprinklers watering the field. I saw the first
players meander out for their stretches. I saw baskets of balls
carried to the pitcher's mound and the opening pops of batting
practice.</LD>
<LD>   "It never occurred to me, watching this gentle, orderly process,
that baseball could one day become a complete and holy mess.</LD>
<TE>   "But it has. Oscar Madison's laundry basket is neater than this."</TE>
<TE>   More Albom: "In the end, when all the culprits are lined against
the wall, baseball can only point to the face in the mirror.</TE>
<TE>   "Its name is Greed."</TE>
<TE>   Trivia time: Who was the youngest major league player to hit 100
home runs?</TE>
<TE>   Sister power: From Rick Reilly of Sports Illustrated: "You cannot
be serious, John McEnroe. You cannot mean what you say in your new
book. You cannot actually believe you can beat one of the Williams
sisters.</TE>
<TE>   "You were great. You were three exits past great. But you would
get fried, flambeed and fricasseed. They would stomp you, sweep you
up and send you home in an earring box."</TE>
<TE>   Sisters, Part II: From Steve Hummer of the Atlanta
Journal-Constitution: "How silly it is to get worked up about some
pitiful little man stalking Serena Williams.</TE>
<TE>   "If he actually tried to approach her, by the time Serena and the
rest of the family got through with the guy, there wouldn't be enough
left of him to mail to jail."</TE>
<TE>   Par for the course: Nick Faldo won the 1987 British Open, his
first major golf championship, with a final round of 18 pars at
Muirfield. Once hailed as a remarkable feat of consistency, Faldo
offers a different perspective 15 years later.</TE>
<TE>   "It wasn't planned," he said. "People said, 'That was Faldo--dead,
boring, look at him.' But I was choking on every putt. I couldn't get
the thing in the hole."</TE>
<TE>   Setting son: Bob Ryan of the Boston Globe, commenting on the body
of Ted Williams being sent to a cryonics facility by his son.</TE>
<TE>   "Anyone recall the old Patty McCormack movie 'The Bad Seed'? Oooh,
there was a wicked child. If that evil little girl had a twin
brother, it would have been John Henry Williams."</TE>
<TE>   Deep freeze: From David Letterman: "I get up in the morning and
I'm watching the Martha Stewart show, and she's showing you how to
properly thaw Ted Williams."</TE>
<TE>   Looking back: On this day in 1941, Joe DiMaggio extended his
hitting streak to 56 games by going three for four in the New York
Yankees' 10-3 victory over the Cleveland Indians.</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: Tony Conigliaro, at age 22 with the Boston Red Sox
in 1967. His career was derailed later that season when he was hit in
the eye by a pitch from the Angels' Jack Hamilton.</TE>
<TE>   And finally: From Tom Fitzgerald of the San Francisco Chronicle:
"A blind German psychic claims he can read people's futures by
feeling their naked buttocks. We hear he's offering to demonstrate
his technique to predict when Anna Kournikova will win her first
tournament."</TE>

<HD>Woods Hasn't Taken Their Freedom ... Yet</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE JAMES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>GULLANE, Scotland</DL>
<LD>Ernie Els didn't exactly sound a battle cry Monday that would have
rallied William Wallace's troops to fight to the last man.</LD>
<LD>   The two-time U.S. Open champion and world's No. 3 player almost
seemed to run up the white flag and concede the 131st British Open to
Tiger Woods three days before the first tee shot has been struck at
Muirfield in the game's oldest national golf championship.</LD>
<LD>   Woods, who has won seven of the last 11 majors, is trying to
become the first player since Ben Hogan in 1953 to win the Masters,
U.S. Open and British Open in the same year and the first player to
win the modern Grand Slam.</LD>
<TE>   "When I've played well, Tiger still has beaten me. What do you
do?" Els said. "You have to play better....</TE>
<TE>   "You know he's going to be in contention this week, so you can
beat the field by a couple of shots, but you might not beat Tiger at
the end of the day."</TE>
<TE>   Els said Woods' presence in a major field changes the dynamics of
the stroke-play competition, when players like to say they are
competing against the course, not other players.</TE>
<TE>   "It seems now when you play a major tournament, you really play
the golf course and you play Tiger," he said. "It seems like he's
there every time and he just knows ... that even if he's not playing
very well, he's still going to be there.... I think this guy is just
a totally different talent than the world has ever seen."</TE>
<TE>   In those last 11 majors, Woods has won each of the seven times he
has been in contention heading into the final round.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the lack of success Els, David Duval and Phil Mickelson,
still looking for his first major championship, have had derailing
Woods, Els still bristles at the notion--offered by Jack Nicklaus,
Arnold Palmer and Gary Player just after the U.S. Open--that today's
players have failed to provide the kind of intense challenge that
marked their heydays.</TE>
<TE>   "If it wasn't for one guy, I think Mickelson would have had two or
three by now, and I think David would have probably won the Masters a
couple of times, and who knows, maybe I could have won four or five,
so there you go," Els said.</TE>
<TE>   So, perhaps Nicklaus, Palmer and Player are lucky they played when
they did?</TE>
<TE>   "I think so," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Still, there are others who think Woods' biggest challenge might
have come from the past. Nick Faldo, who won the last two Opens held
at Muirfield, in 1992 and '87, said he thinks Seve Ballesteros and
Greg Norman, in their prime, might have been a stiffer test for Woods
than Els, Duval and Mickelson.</TE>
<TE>   "Seve's biggest attribute was he had a big heart," Faldo said. "He
was a great competitor, and same with Greg. They were just slightly
fiercer competitors. They really enjoyed the battle."</TE>
<TE>   So did Wallace in "Braveheart," and we know how that ended.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   How high is the rough at Muirfield? In a practice round Sunday
afternoon, playing with close friend Woods, Mark O'Meara didn't
bother trying to hit out of knee-high rough after hitting two errant
drives off the first tee.</TE>
<TE>   Later in the round, O'Meara, winner of the 1998 Open at Royal
Birkdale, dropped a couple of balls in the deep rough surrounding the
17th green, took several ineffective swipes at them and eventually
picked them up.</TE>
<TE>   "I think I'm going to need a weed-whacker out there this week," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Several players in their practice rounds aren't even bothering to
try to battle the tall grass, tossing their balls--when they can find
them--out to the fairway instead.</TE>
<TE>   Waist-high rough is nothing unusual for an Open course, though the
unusually wet summer even by Scotland's standards has helped make it
thicker and deeper than ever. The fairways are narrow, often little
more than 20 yards wide, with a few yards of playable rough before
the really deep stuff closes in.</TE>
<TE>   "It's excruciating," said Tom Lehman, who won the 1996 Open at
Royal Lytham. "I just hacked it back into the fairways with a sand
wedge.</TE>
<TE>   "It would have to be a miracle to hit it 150 yards out of this
stuff; mostly you'll just see people hitting it sideways."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Woods, who spent time relaxing in Ireland before making his first
trip to Muirfield to play Sunday, had an eagle and several birdies in
his first round over the narrow fairways of this storied links
layout.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a heck of a golf course, the rough's up and it's pretty
tight," he said after his inaugural round here. "It's going to be a
great challenge."</TE>
<TE>   Woods and O'Meara were the first to tee off, at 6:40 a.m. Monday,
and finished their round in three hours, after which they headed to
the range.</TE>
<TE>   There, Woods spent considerable time hitting low, fading long
irons that bore through the wind and dropped on his target about 250
yards out, the kind of shot he'll depend on if the weather worsens.
Sunday and Monday were mild with moderate wind.</TE>
<TE>   Woods appeared Sunday with a neatly trimmed goatee. The goatee
lasted one day at Muirfield before it disappeared, about as long as
the oddsmakers here figure the field will stay with Woods once the
tournament begins Thursday. The odds on Woods are an almost
unheard-of 7-4. Mickelson is second at 14-1.</TE>
<TE>   How did Woods play Monday? "I broke 100 out there," he said as he
quickly left the grounds.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Lehman, coming off a sixth-place finish in the Scottish Open on
Sunday, has been using a new long putter for three months. "I like
it. I'm putting much better," he said of a club with an unorthodox
head that looks like it might be better suited to plumbing than golf.
Lehman, who has made $627,000 this year, has his only two top-10
finishes in full-field events since going with the new club.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Paul Azinger pulled out of the tournament because of an
undisclosed minor injury.</TE>

<LD>Darren Dreifort took another step in his comeback from elbow surgery
when the right-hander threw a simulated game Monday.</LD>
<LD>   But this comeback was measured in minutes rather than months.</LD>
<LD>   Dreifort warmed up and threw 16 pitches to Dave Hansen, Jeff
Reboulet and Hiram Bocachica. He then retired to the Dodger dugout
for eight minutes before returning for another warmup and 18 more
pitches to the same hitters.</LD>
<TE>   It was the first time since he underwent surgery on July 9, 2001
that Dreifort pitched to hitters without a batting practice screen.
It was also the first time he rested and warmed up again for a
simulated second inning.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't have any problems," Dreifort said. "I took eight warmup
pitches like I would in a game and I was fine."</TE>
<TE>   Dreifort gave up a home run to Hansen in the second inning on a
slider.</TE>
<TE>   "My reactions are good," Dreifort joked. "I said [expletive] as
soon as he hit it."</TE>
<TE>   Bocachica said Dreifort's fastball was lively in the first inning
and better in the second.</TE>
<TE>   Manager Jim Tracy said he was impressed.</TE>
<TE>   "Are every one of his pitches going pin-point, exactly where he
wants them to go?" Tracy said. "We're not concerned with that. We're
more concerned with how did he warm up after he sat down for eight
minutes, because that's the next hurdle we're going over."</TE>
<TE>   Tracy said Dreifort would be evaluated today before scheduling
another bullpen workout or simulated game.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   General Manager Dan Evans returned Monday afternoon from Japan
where he had traveled to be part of ceremonies honoring the late
Akihiro "Ike" Ikuhara, a longtime club executive who was inducted
into the Japan Baseball Hall of Fame.</TE>
<TE>   Evans said he was on the phone throughout his trip discussing
possible trades.</TE>
<TE>   He would not discuss specific players.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not going to make a move based on what happened the last
couple of days," said Evans, who watched the Dodger broadcasts in
Japan. "If we do something, we'll make a move that makes sense for
the next couple of months.</TE>
<TE>   "We have got some things cooking. We have a lot of discussions out
there. If we're able to do something that makes sense for us in 2002
and future years, sure, we'll do it."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Kevin Brown will resume his rehabilitative throwing program today.</TE>
<TE>   Brown will continue throwing off flat ground for 11 more days
before pitching off a mound, Tracy said.</TE>
<TE>   "He's doing his thing and making progress," Tracy said. "He's
definitely making progress."</TE>

<HD>Fehr's Players Have No Fear</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Union chief claims solidarity and updates Dodgers
on negotiations. Grudzielanek says no one wants a strike.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JASON REID</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Don Fehr, executive director of the Major League Baseball Players
Assn., reaffirmed the players' solidarity amid the owners' doomsday
claims, saying Monday that "you can't scare these guys" after a
closed-door meeting with the Dodgers at Dodger Stadium.</LD>
<LD>   Recent comments from Commissioner Bud Selig about two teams facing
imminent cash-flow crises have not distracted players, whom Fehr is
updating on the progress of collective bargaining talks scheduled to
resume Thursday in New York. And the union chief, in Los Angeles this
week while continuing his tour of all 30 clubs, reiterated his hope
of reaching an agreement, although no progress has been made on the
key issues of revenue sharing and a luxury tax on teams with high
payrolls.</LD>
<LD>   The Dodgers discussed those issues and others during the 2-hour
15-minute session, emerging united after Fehr filled in the blanks.</LD>
<TE>   "There are a lot of things up in the air, and we're trying to go
about it the right way, the way we see fit as a group," second
baseman Mark Grudzielanek said. "Everybody hopes that things can be
worked out, and nobody wants a strike."</TE>
<TE>   Fehr, who also met with the St. Louis Cardinals before Monday's
game, would not comment specifically on Selig's claims, responding
only generally about the mood of the players.</TE>
<TE>   "You would think people would understand that [the players can't
be intimidated]," he said. "They are here, in large part, because
they want to compete. They want to get the right thing done, and they
don't ever give up.</TE>
<TE>   "They understand that we've got a lot of work to do, and this is
very serious business. Hopefully, we'll be able to find a way to get
it done. Nobody wants a strike; it's the last resort."</TE>
<TE>   The union's executive board did not set a strike date after a
five-hour meeting July 8 in Rosemont, Ill., but players are prepared
for the possibility of baseball's ninth work stoppage. It is doubtful
that a date would be set before Fehr, who plans to meet with the San
Diego Padres today, completes his tour at the end of the month, and
unclear whether the union would set an August date, or wait until
September.</TE>
<TE>   Progress has been made on the concept of one worldwide draft, but
negotiations have lagged on the core financial issues.</TE>
<TE>   The high-revenue clubs transferred $167 million to the
lower-revenue clubs last year, and the owners are now seeking to
transfer about $298 million from the high-revenue teams in their
proposal. The union is at $228 million.</TE>
<TE>   Fehr previously suggested a compromise would seem possible on that
issue, based on the sides' numbers, but he was noncommittal at Dodger
Stadium.</TE>
<TE>   "Collective bargaining is a difficult process," he said.
"Sometimes it's a lot slower than you think it should be, and
sometimes it moves very fast.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not something that you can grade day by day. It's not
something you can make judgments on day by day."</TE>

<LD>Looking to ride the wave of euphoria from South Korea's surprising
run to the World Cup semifinals, the Galaxy announced Monday that
Saturday's match against the Kansas City Wizards at the Rose Bowl
would be designated Korean Heritage Night.</LD>
<LD>   The Galaxy and its parent company, Anschutz Entertainment Group,
hope that the event sends a message to the Korean soccer federation
and Major League Soccer that the team intends to sign a Korean player
for next season.</LD>
<LD>   "In this world here and in our city today we cannot field a soccer
team that represents this community without a South Korean player,"
AEG President Tim Leiweke said.</LD>
<TE>   Besides bringing in Korean musicians, dancers and food, the Galaxy
will honor South Korean assistant Hae Sung Chung.</TE>
<TE>   Also, anyone wearing a T-shirt with "Be the Reds" on it will be
able to purchase an $18 ticket for $14.</TE>

<DH>Baseball: Leadoff hitter homers, scores three runs in 6-3
win over Diamondbacks.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>David Bell hit a three-run homer and the San Francisco Giants beat
the Arizona Diamondbacks, 6-3, Monday night to further narrow the NL
West race.</LD>
<LD>   The Giants moved within 1 1/2 games of the division-leading
Dodgers. The Diamondbacks are a half-game out in second place.</LD>
<LD>   Ryan Jensen (10-6) gave up two runs and eight hits over 5 2/3
innings. The rookie right-hander, who leads the Giants in victories,
won his fourth consecutive start.</LD>
<TE>   Robb Nen worked the ninth for the Giants, who have won six of
their last seven games. He gave up an RBI single to Luis Gonzalez.</TE>
<TE>   Rick Helling (7-8) has lost three consecutive starts and has given
up 23 home runs, most in the NL. He went three innings, giving up
five runs and five hits.</TE>
<TE>   The Giants took a 1-0 lead in the first. Bell drew a leadoff walk,
Jeff Kent doubled off the top of the left-field wall and Reggie
Sanders hit a sacrifice fly.</TE>
<TE>   Arizona tied the score in the second on Rod Barajas' RBI single.</TE>
<TE>   Bell hit his three-run homer into the left-field bleachers in the
second, giving the Giants a 4-1 lead.</TE>
<TE>   J.T. Snow had a solo homer to left in the third.</TE>
<TE>   Snow, who has four home runs, had not homered at Pacific Bell Park
since May 8 last season.</TE>
<TE>   Bonds was intentionally walked by Helling the first two times he
came up, giving the Giant slugger 41 such walks this season--four shy
of Willie McCovey's record of 45 in 1969.</TE>

<HD>Ducks Sign Chistov to Deal</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Chris Foster; Jerry Crowe</AU>
<BD>From Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Mighty Ducks beat the deadline and signed forward Stanislav
Chistov to a three-year contract at about $1.75 million per season on
Monday.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm extremely relieved that this got done, this is a dream come
true," Chistov said through a translator. "Now I can continue
training with a goal in mind."</LD>
<LD>   Chistov, 19, was the fifth player taken in the 2001 draft, but
became the center of an off-ice struggle. Officials from Avangard
Omsk, his Russian hockey team, claimed he was in the army and ordered
Chistov home or else he would be considered AWOL.</LD>
<TE>   The Ducks had to sign Chistov by Monday or could not negotiate
with him for another year.</TE>
<TE>   Chris Foster</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Again beating a deadline, the Kings signed Russian forward
Alexander Frolov to a three-year contract. If the Kings hadn't signed
him before the Monday deadline, Frolov would have been ineligible to
play next season.</TE>
<TE>   Identified by the Kings as their No. 1 prospect, the 6-foot-3,
200-pound Frolov, 20, was the 20th pick in the 2000 NHL draft.
Playing last season in the Russian Super League, he led the Soviet
Wings with 30 points, among them 18 goals, in 44 games.</TE>
<TE>   Also, King center Eric Belanger filed for salary arbitration.</TE>
<TE>   Jerry Crowe</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   All-Star left wing Patrik Elias signed a three-year contract with
the New Jersey Devils. As a restricted free agent, Elias, 26, could
have fielded offers from other teams, but the Devils had the right to
match any deal.... Toronto Coach/General Manager Pat Quinn was fined
$100,000 by NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman for his comments on recent
free-agent signings around the league. Last week, Quinn bashed teams
for shelling out big bucks and predicted a lockout in 2004.... Ottawa
signed captain Daniel Alfredsson to a two-year contract....
Konstantin Koltsov, Pittsburgh's first-round draft choice three years
ago, signed with the Penguins.... Chicago signed free-agent
defenseman Jason Strudwick.... Washington hired Randy Carlyle and
Glen Hanlon to be assistants under new head Coach Bruce Cassidy....
The Pittsburgh Penguins signed forward Vladimir Vujtek.</TE>

<KH>LAKER NOTES</KH>
<HD>Shaq Still Explores Toe Options</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TIM BROWN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A month has passed since Laker center Shaquille O'Neal danced in
puddles of champagne, on an arthritic big toe that made parts of his
third championship season nearly unbearable.</LD>
<LD>   Since then, O'Neal has accumulated opinions from foot specialists,
their recommendations ranging from aggressive surgery to simple
rehabilitation.</LD>
<LD>   O'Neal, who nonetheless averaged 36.3 points and 12.3 rebounds in
the Lakers' NBA Finals sweep of the New Jersey Nets, has not yet
chosen a course he hopes will allow him to recover his previous
mobility and end the pain and necessity for anti-inflammatory
medication.</LD>
<TE>   While Coach Phil Jackson and other ranking members of the
organization have urged O'Neal not to dawdle in the process, which
could threaten O'Neal's conditioning and the early part of the
regular season, surgery--if that is chosen--probably would not occur
until late in the summer.</TE>
<TE>   O'Neal, who last week became a second-class reserve officer for
the police department of the Port of Los Angeles, recently has tended
to some of his business interests in Los Angeles and, this week, in
Arkansas. He intends to continue his law-enforcement education next
summer, when he hopes to become a first-class reserve. Eventually,
he'd like to be a sheriff, either in Louisiana, where he attended
college, or Orlando, Fla., where he spends most of his off-season.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   NBA teams can sign free agents beginning Wednesday, when the
Lakers could get a better idea about small forward Devean George,
whose free agency has brought varying interest from about a dozen
teams, according to his agent.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers declined the fourth-year option on George's rookie
contract in October, and now find themselves bidding against
multi-year offers from a variety of clubs, the Washington Wizards and
Minnesota Timberwolves expected to be strongest among them.</TE>
<TE>   General Manager Mitch Kupchak hoped to spend this time locating a
more conventional backup to O'Neal, and, indeed, he has entertained
offers to free agents Arvydas Sabonis, Popeye Jones and Charles
Oakley. If George were to sign elsewhere, however, Kupchak might be
more inclined to sign a guard, even if he re-signs Brian Shaw, which
he hopes to do.</TE>
<TE>   Without George, Jackson's small forwards would be Rick Fox and
Tracy Murray, though Kobe Bryant then would get plenty of playing
time on the wing, which he prefers.</TE>
<TE>   If George and Shaw re-sign and the Lakers match offers for
restricted free agent Slava Medvedenko, their roster would stand at
12. It is unknown if owner Jerry Buss would allow a 13th player, even
at the relatively modest cost of $1 million for Oakley, or slightly
more for Jones, who made $1.5 million with the Wizards.</TE>
<TE>   Sabonis, 37, was out of the game last season after six seasons in
Portland, but seems committed to returning, having spoken to several
European teams and, perhaps, the Lakers as well.</TE>
<TE>   Jones had a decent season in Washington, where he averaged 7.0
points and 7.3 rebounds in 79 games.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers had early interest in San Antonio free-agent forward
Malik Rose, until the Spurs agreed to pay him $42 million over seven
seasons.</TE>
<TE>   Medvedenko expected to play for the Lakers' summer-league team but
remained at home in the Ukraine to tend to his father, who was ill.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Wednesday also is the first day the Lakers can offer Bryant a
three-year, $54.8 million contract extension. Bryant has three years
left on his deal with the Lakers, though he can opt out in two years.
He has said he would wait until the collective bargaining agreement
expires, also in three years, but that he expected to spend his
career in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   It is possible the economic climate in the league would make the
extension more attractive to Bryant.</TE>
<TE>   "He's indicated he's not unhappy here," Kupchak said. "We're not
going to pressure him. Personally, and I'm biased, I don't think
there's a better team or city for him.</TE>
<TE>   "They know there's a contract extension here for them."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Guard Kareem Rush, acquired in the draft-day deal with the Toronto
Raptors, has been bright, eager and a competent shooter in his first
weeks as a Laker, assistant coach Kurt Rambis said Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Whether that translates into regular-season playing time from
Jackson, famously distrustful of rookies, is hazy.</TE>
<TE>   "It depends on how well he picks things up," said Rambis, who
coaches the Lakers' summer-league team in Long Beach. "He's got to
show the head coach he doesn't have to worry about him executing the
offense and defending the [shooting guards]. That's a very tough
job."</TE>
<TE>   Rush has not played since Friday, when he fell and sprained his
left wrist. X-rays were negative and he is day to day, though the
team ends its schedule today.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Bryant will wear shoes made by someone other than adidas for the
first time in his NBA career.</TE>
<TE>   Together since 1996, Bryant and adidas ended their partnership
with an announcement Monday. The deal reportedly paid Bryant about $5
million a year.</TE>
<TE>   Bryant, who has endorsement deals with Sprite, Spalding and
McDonald's, will try different shoe brands in the coming season.</TE>

<HD>NBA Fires Kantner; One Female Ref Is Left</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dee Kantner, one of the NBA's two female referees, has been fired,
the NBA said Monday.</LD>
<LD>   "Dee has been terminated," NBA vice president of basketball
operations Stu Jackson said. "There are times in a referee's
development that we find that a referee is not making sufficient
progress in her own development and sometimes a change is needed. In
this case, we felt that her termination was warranted."</LD>
<LD>   Kantner and Violet Palmer joined the NBA's officiating staff in
1997. It was the first time in major U.S. professional sports that
women officiated regular-season games in an all-male league. Both
worked through the 2001-02 season.</LD>
<TE>   Before she was hired by the NBA, Kantner was the supervisor of
officials for the WNBA.</TE>
<TE>   NBA officials are evaluated by Jackson, the league's supervisor of
officials, staff observers and coaches and general managers.</TE>
<TE>   Jurisprudence</TE>
<TE>   While a friend disposed of his clothes, former NBA star Jayson
Williams jumped into the pool at his home after fatally shooting a
limousine driver, according to an article in GQ.</TE>
<TE>   The article, to be published in the magazine's August edition,
cites unnamed sources in recounting the night driver Costas Christofi
died.</TE>
<TE>   Williams, 34, is charged with first-degree manslaughter. He and
two other men also face a series of charges for allegedly trying to
conceal or destroy evidence, encouraging witnesses to lie and
replacing Williams' fingerprints on the shotgun with Christofi's.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Stains found in Allen Iverson's car, initially believed by
investigators to be smeared blood, turned out not to be bloodstains,
a Philadelphia police official said.</TE>
<TE>   "His kids ride in the car. We think that the stains probably came
from the kids," the official said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's definitely not blood."</TE>
<TE>   Iverson is supposed to turn himself in today to face charges of
trespassing, assault, making threats, unlawful restraint and carrying
a gun without a license.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Ted Williams' children are close to announcing an agreement over
whether the body of one of baseball's greatest hitters will remain
frozen, an attorney said.</TE>
<TE>   Bobby-Jo Williams Ferrell and her half siblings, John Henry
Williams and Claudia Williams, met for hours at a lawyer's office in
Inverness, Fla.</TE>
<TE>   Richard Fitzpatrick, one of Ferrell's attorneys, said he is
hopeful the feud can be resolved today.</TE>
<TE>   Football</TE>
<TE>   Bruce Matthews, the most durable offensive lineman in NFL history,
retired from the Tennessee Titans after 296 games over 19 years spent
entirely with the franchise, including the first 14 when it was the
Houston Oilers.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Oakland Raiders signed quarterback Rich Gannon to a six-year,
$54-million extension, a football source said.</TE>
<TE>   The source, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said the
36-year-old Gannon will get $8 million a year over next three
seasons.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Wide receiver Antwaun Smith, who signed a letter of intent in
February, will not be joining the UCLA football program in August
because he did not meet initial eligibility requirements.... Penn
State and Notre Dame will renew their football rivalry with games in
2006 and 2007.</TE>
<TE>   Miscellany</TE>
<TE>   Kentucky hired Oregon State's Mitch Barnhart as athletic director.
The position was vacant since March 5, when Larry Ivy resigned.</TE>

<TE>   Ricky Rudd's options for his NASCAR future were shortened when his
car owner indicated it was unlikely the veteran racer would be back

Robert Yates said chances were "slim" that Rudd would be back in the

<LD>Pete Sampras has ended his short partnership with coach Jose
Higueras, according to his representatives. They started working
together in February, not long after Sampras parted ways with Tom
Gullikson.</LD>
<LD>   Higueras, however, was unable to travel with Sampras outside of
the Grand Slam events because of his primary job as men's coach for
the USTA's touring program. Apparently, Sampras realized that he
needed a full-time coach.</LD>
<LD>   Since reaching the U.S. Open final in 2001, he has had three
coaches--Paul Annacone, Gullikson and Higueras.</LD>

<HD>Extra Spot Sought for CONCACAF</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>GRAHAME L. JONES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Jack Warner, the Trinidadian president of CONCACAF, said Monday that
soccer's North and Central American and Caribbean region deserves an
extra berth at the next World Cup in Germany four years from now.</LD>
<LD>   "I have let it be known, at all the levels that count, that we
shall make every possible effort to obtain a fourth place for
CONCACAF in the World Cup in 2006," said Warner, a FIFA vice
president.</LD>
<LD>   "It is only right and proper that we should be able to send our
best four [teams], because who in the world can argue that our best
three did not stand up to the best the other confederations had to
offer? And who can argue that our best four cannot do the same?"</LD>
<TE>   The region's three participants at Korea/Japan '02--Costa Rica,
Mexico and the United States--had a combined record of 5-4-3 and were
outscored, 17 goals to 16. They were a combined 2-2-2 against
European opposition, and it is Europe that probably would have to
give up one place for CONCACAF to get an additional spot.</TE>
<TE>   Complicating Warner's task is the fact that CONCACAF is not the
only region trying to get another World Cup place. Also trying are
Asia and Oceania, and Europe is not about to give up three of its
places.</TE>
<TE>   "Asia's spots will have to be increased, considering the
population and the number of television viewers on the continent,"
Malaysia's Peter Velappan, general secretary of the Asian Football
Confederation [AFC], told Japan's Kyodo News agency last month.</TE>
<TE>   Asia was represented by China, Japan, Saudi Arabia and South Korea
at the 2002 tournament and the four teams had a combined record of
5-8-4 and were outscored, 28 goals to 13.</TE>
<TE>   Oceania also has been clamoring for one full place at the World
Cup without having to go through an additional playoff.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Roster Shapes Up</TE>
<TE>   Tracey Leone, coach of the United States women's under-19 national
team, has brought 27 players into camp in Chula Vista for 13 days of
training, after which she will name the 18 players to take part in
the first FIFA Under-19 Women's World Championship in Canada next
month.</TE>
<TE>   The 27 include six Californians: goalkeeper Kim Bingham of San
Ramon; defender Rachel Buehler of Del Mar; midfielder Jill Oakes of
West Hills, and forwards Megan Kakadelas of Carlsbad, Natalie
Sanderson of Ventura and Angela Woznuk of El Cajon.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. will play England, Australia and Taiwan in the first
round of the Aug. 17-Sept. 1 world championship.</TE>
<TE>   MLS Gets Garcia</TE>
<TE>   Major League Soccer's Columbus Crew completed the acquisition of
Guatemalan national team midfielder Freddy Garcia from CSD
Comunicaciones for an undisclosed fee.</TE>
<TE>   Garcia, 25, scored five goals in 10 qualifying games as Guatemala
narrowly failed to reach the 2002 World Cup.</TE>

<HD>Cubs Continue to Win With Kimm</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Bruce Kimm's presence has pepped up the Chicago Cubs. And not even a
substitution gaffe by the interim manager could spoil the atmosphere
Monday night at Chicago.</LD>
<LD>   "He's always talking, he's a communicator, he's letting you know
and he's fun to play for," said Todd Hundley, who hit one of three
Chicago homers as the Cubs got strong pitching from Carlos Zambrano
and beat the Atlanta Braves, 3-2.</LD>
<LD>   Atlanta lost its third in a row. The Cubs improved to 5-1 under
Kimm, including 4-0 at home.</LD>
<TE>   Hundley hit a tying homer in the fifth and Alex Gonzalez followed
with another homer. Mark Bellhorn also connected for the Cubs.</TE>
<TE>   "The guys have a little bounce in their step. We just hope we can
keep this going," said Kimm, who replaced the fired Don Baylor just
before the All-Star break.</TE>
<TE>   In the ninth inning, Kimm sent Darren Lewis--who had pinch-run in
the eighth--to right field, meaning he had to pull Sosa off the
field.</TE>
<TE>   "I made a terrible mistake. It's unforgivable for a manager," Kimm
said. "We were fortunate we got out of it."</TE>
<TE>   Sosa came running off the field and Kimm met him at the top of the
dugout to explain his mistake.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a mistake. No big deal," Sosa said. "We are all human. The
last thing he wanted to do was take me out of the game and he knew
it."</TE>
<TE>   Philadelphia 11, Montreal 8--Ricky Ledee, Pat Burrell and Scott
Rolen homered in an eight-run ninth inning at Montreal.</TE>
<TE>   Trailing 8-3, the Phillies began their big comeback on Ledee's
three-run shot off Jim Brower with one out in the ninth.</TE>
<TE>   Reliever Scott Stewart then bobbled Jimmy Rollins' grounder back
to the mound before throwing wildly to first for an error and Bobby
Abreu walked.</TE>
<TE>   Expo Manager Frank Robinson summoned Matt Herges (2-4), who
yielded a three-run shot to Burrell that put the Phillies ahead, 9-8.</TE>
<TE>   Cincinnati 2, Milwaukee 0--Chris Reitsma pitched a five-hitter at
Milwaukee to win for the first time since May 21.</TE>
<TE>   Reitsma (4-7), who had been 0-7 in his last eight starts, struck
out four and drove in a run, throwing 89 pitches in his first
complete game in 47 major league starts.</TE>
<TE>   Reitsma ended a streak of 151 starts by Red pitchers without a
complete game.</TE>
<TE>   New York 8, Florida 3--Mike Bacsik pitched a seven-hitter in his
second major league start, and Mo Vaughn and Jeromy Burnitz homered
at New York.</TE>
<TE>   Bacsik (2-0) struck out seven and walked one to send the Marlins
to their season-high fifth consecutive loss.</TE>
<TE>   The Mets were without catcher Mike Piazza, who was scratched from
the starting lineup because of a sore lower back.</TE>
<TE>   Colorado 5, San Diego 0--Rookie Denny Stark gave up one hit over
six scoreless innings at San Diego in his first start since June 3.</TE>
<TE>   Stark, who replaced the struggling Denny Neagle in the rotation,
held the Padres hitless for 5 1/3 innings before giving up Ramon
Vazquez's double to left field.</TE>
<TE>   Pittsburgh 5, Houston 4--Aramis Ramirez hit a two-run homer with
two out in the top of the ninth off Billy Wagner to lift the Pirates
at Houston.</TE>

<HD>Four Candidates Going for USOC Presidency</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ALAN ABRAHAMSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a clear sign of the political fractiousness that has long animated
the U.S. Olympic Committee, two men and two women Monday formally
declared themselves candidates for the vacant USOC presidency, and
none could immediately be declared a front-runner.</LD>
<LD>   Two are longtime USOC inside players: Paul George, a USOC vice
president, and Marty Mankamyer, the USOC's secretary and its acting
president since late May, when Sandra Baldwin abruptly resigned after
acknowledging discrepancies in her USOC biography.</LD>
<LD>   George, 60, a Boston attorney long active in the management of
winter sports, narrowly lost the 2000 presidential election to
Baldwin. Mankamyer, 68, is a Colorado Springs, Colo., real estate
executive.</LD>
<TE>   Donna De Varona, 55, an activist for women in sports, also took
the plunge. As a swimmer, she won Olympic gold in the 1960s. Now a
broadcaster who lives in Connecticut, De Varona said she is running
on the grounds "they want somebody who brings a lot of the outside
in."</TE>
<TE>   The unexpected entry was that of Larry Hough, who from 1990-97
headed Sallie Mae, the Student Loan Marketing Assn., and for the last
three years has run Arlington, Va.,-based Sato Travel. Hough, 58, who
lives in suburban Washington, served as USOC treasurer from 1980-84
but has not been actively involved in USOC affairs for years--though
he has maintained close ties to Peter Ueberroth, who headed the 1984
Los Angeles Olympics.</TE>
<TE>   Hough won a silver medal in rowing at the 1968 Mexico City Games.
His nomination papers were signed by Anita DeFrantz, another
medal-winning rower who is the senior International Olympic Committee
member in the United States.</TE>
<TE>   "If there's some interest in speaking to an alternative for a term
that's 2 1/2 years long, they have in my candidacy, I think, a pretty
solid option," Hough said.</TE>
<TE>   Whoever is elected will serve until December 2004. The Executive
Committee is due to meet July 29 in Chicago with the aim of selecting
one name to forward by mail ballot to the 115-member Board of
Directors; a simple board majority would confirm the Executive
Committee's choice.</TE>
<TE>   George goes into the July 29 meeting hoping for--but hardly
guaranteed of--support from the national governing bodies (NGB),
which oversee sports in this country. He has failed in recent weeks
to secure unanimous NGB backing on key procedural issues.</TE>
<TE>   Mankamyer's base of support is the athletes, though she can also
reach out to the NGBs because she is, as she proudly says, a "soccer
mom" who was long active in the U.S. soccer federation.</TE>

<HD>Leslie Is the Star of Stars Again</HD>
<DH>WNBA: She becomes a three-time MVP and helps West stay
perfect with 81-76 victory.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Lisa Leslie isn't ready to relinquish the WNBA spotlight to a younger
generation.</LD>
<LD>   Leslie scored 13 of her 18 points in the second half and earned
her third All-Star most-valuable-player trophy, leading the Western
Conference to an 81-76 victory over the East on Monday night.</LD>
<LD>   The West has won all four All-Star games, and Leslie has been MVP
in all but one.</LD>
<TE>   She drew motivation Monday night from talk of a changing of the
guard in the league, with high-profile rookies such as Sue Bird and
Tamika Catchings challenging Leslie, Sheryl Swoopes and other
veterans for star status.</TE>
<TE>   "It's funny how all of the sudden this year everybody is calling
us old-school ... just because a new class of young players has come
in," Leslie said.</TE>
<TE>   "By no means are any of us done."</TE>
<TE>   Houston's Tina Thompson led all scorers with 20 points.</TE>
<TE>   West Coach Michael Cooper said he was impressed with the play of
his veterans, Leslie, Thompson and Swoopes.</TE>
<TE>   "The younger players coming in--the Sue Birds, the Lauren
Jacksons--can learn from those players," said Cooper, who coaches
Leslie with the Sparks. "Because the passing of the torch ... has to
be done so it's not dropped, that the caliber of play doesn't
diminish."</TE>
<TE>   This was the closest of the West's victories.</TE>
<TE>   "We're happy it was a competitive game because we've blown them
out so many times in the past," Leslie said. "I think it was great
for the fans."</TE>
<TE>   The West took the lead for good on two free throws by Tina
Thompson that made it 77-76 with 51 seconds left. Swoopes, her
teammate with the Houston Comets, had two free throws with 19 seconds
left to make it a three-point lead.</TE>
<TE>   The East had a chance to tie the score with seven seconds left,
but Catchings could not handle an inbounds pass, and turned the ball
over. Thompson then made two free throws for the final margin.</TE>
<TE>   Leslie, the league's MVP last season with the champion Sparks,
finished with an All-Star game-record 14 rebounds and blocked four
shots.</TE>
<TE>   Catchings, a rookie with the Indiana Fever who played with a mask
protecting her broken nose, led the East with 12 points.</TE>
<TE>   "It just goes to show you--the older players are smarter than the
younger players," Catchings said. "You see the older players, they
always seem to get open at the right moment."</TE>
