<HD>An 'Empire' on the edge</HD>
<DH>John Leguizamo is superb as a drug kingpin who realizes all
too well the precariousness of his existence.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Kevin Thomas</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In regard to Franc. Reyes' engrossing and utterly uncompromising
"Empire" let it be said right at the top that the protean John
Leguizamo, last seen as Toulouse-Lautrec in "Moulin Rouge," gives one
of the best performances of the year in a lead role in an American
movie. Unfortunately, "Empire," with its combination of ethnicity and
violence, too easily slips into the urban drama slot, which is not
the best category for attracting prestigious nominations and awards.</LD>
<LD>   While it is true that "Empire" can be described as a contemporary
gangster picture, Reyes has brought to it an uncommon aura of
authenticity; by no stretch of the imagination could it be described
as an action movie.</LD>
<LD>   "This country is all about making money," declares Leguizamo's
Victor Rosa, introducing himself via voice-over as narrator. To that
end Victor has established himself as one of the top drug dealers in
South Bronx, and Empire is the name of the territory he has carved
out for himself and his cronies.</LD>
<TE>   As reflective as he is ruthless, Victor is more intelligent and
more aware of the grim realities of his danger-filled way of life
than his rivals; he is also honest enough to admit to himself that
living on the edge is exciting, as addictive as the drugs his people
sell. He is deep into piling up cash for its own sake and accepts
that this is how his life is going to be.</TE>
<TE>   For the past year, however, he has been seeing a university
student from the neighborhood, Carmen (Delilah Cotto), who has struck
up an acquaintance with a classmate, Trish (Denise Richards), a
glamour girl with a taste for the fast lane and as worshipful of
money as Victor. In no time Trish has introduced Victor to her
boyfriend, Jack (Peter Sarsgaard), a smooth, young Wall Street
wheeler-dealer who promises Victor a terrific return on his
investment. Victor knows he's taking a leap of faith in trusting
Jack, but to him it seems a chance worth taking.</TE>
<TE>   As "Empire's" plot shifts into high gear it also starts revealing
in earnest how much more thoughtful and perceptive it is from the
usual genre movies about ambitious ghetto criminals.</TE>
<TE>   First of all, Victor is too smart to imagine that he can make that
one last big killing and get out. He knows the supplier to him and
his rivals, the striking-looking and super-tough La Colombiana
(Isabella Rossellini), will always demand a cut from whatever he
undertakes. Yet Victor sees a way of leaving South Bronx crime behind
in favor of Wall Street legitimacy.</TE>
<TE>   This is the heart of the film and the source of Reyes' sharpest
observations as Victor tries to leave the 'hood behind for the Soho
high life, exchanging black leather jackets for Armani suits. At the
same time Victor's bold attempt at a transition from one world to
another, geographically so near but light years away in many crucial
ways, allows Leguizamo to express Victor's wide-ranging reactions and
conflicts, the first of which being that while he wishes he would
never have to set foot again in the South Bronx, Carmen remains
rooted to its upside -- its warm, supportive, family-oriented Latino
culture exemplified by her strong, earthy mother (Sonia Braga).</TE>
<TE>   As a first film "Empire" is admirably confident and assured, and
it has that same great rich look cinematographer Kramer Morgenthau
brought to his collaborations with director George Hickenlooper. It
certainly shows that both Leguizamo and Reyes know the territory they
cover so perceptively first-hand, and they understand well how
tempting yet treacherous a life of crime can be for young men who see
little alternative in trying to get ahead. In turning to crime Victor
has accepted an invitation to a lifetime of paranoia and danger, yet
Leguizamo persuades us to hope that Victor, for all the wrongs he has
committed in the name of survival and dominance, makes good his
escape to a better life.</TE>

<HD>Angrier, noisier form of metal</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Appleford</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Not all metal fans can be satisfied by the usual hard-rock sources.
Van Halen? Too slow. Black Sabbath? Not dark enough. Queens of the
Stone Age? Weird.</LD>
<LD>   The extremely hard rock these fans seek has been the specialty of
Metal Blade Records, which launched the careers of the influential
speed-metal acts Slayer and Metallica, both of which have
demonstrated far more staying power than the pop-coated metal of many
of their '80s contemporaries.</LD>
<LD>   The L.A. label celebrated its 20th anniversary with a five-hour
concert Wednesday at the Palace, where heads were banging and devil's
horns were held high.</LD>
<TE>   The mosh pit fully erupted only with the appearance of Cannibal
Corpse, which earned its greatest mainstream fame when then-Sen. Bob
Dole denounced it a decade ago as a threat to society--the kind of
career boost any metal band would kill for.</TE>
<TE>   Cannibal Corpse had taken death-metal a few too many notches past
Slayer in speed and aggression, and little has changed since then.
George Fisher sang with a stormy voice as the band played jagged,
repetitive riffs.</TE>
<TE>   The crowd also perked up for Armored Saint, a twitchy, grinding
quintet that's been with the label since 1983. Earlier, Lizzy Borden
played riffs that were rudimentary and intense, as singer and band
namesake Borden vamped across the stage in shiny vinyl pants and a
long coat. "Hello suckers!" he shouted. "Lemme hear some noise!" The
band closed the set with a Munsters-style "Born to Be Wild."</TE>
<TE>   The fans' T-shirts pledged allegiance to nothing but the hardest
rock: Ozzy Osbourne, Hatebreed, Testament, Black Flag. The crowd, a
mix of graying listeners and younger fans, pressed excitedly against
the stage. It's an audience forever targeted by Metal Blade, which
recently released a 10-disc boxed set about the label's history.</TE>
<TE>   "The underground has always been really strong," said label
founder Brian Slagel. "There's always going to be young kids. And
they're probably going to be angry and into this sort of thing."</TE>

<HD>A family with a supporting role</HD>
<DH>As Brett Lockley, 12, travels with 'Radio City Christmas
Spectacular,' he is accompanied by a rotating cast of loving
guardians.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Patricia Meisol</AU>
<BD>Baltimore Sun</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>He's a skinny, smiling 12-year-old boy from Randallstown, Md., who
wants to be a choreographer: That's Brett Lockley.</LD>
<LD>   When he took a single dance class last year in New York, he didn't
know he was trying out for something big. Then he got it, a part in
the traveling version of the "Radio City Christmas Spectacular." Here
was his chance to learn from the professionals, to dance with the
Rockettes! It got better. He could open the world-famous show, all 4
feet, 8 inches of him, fitted into a white soldier suit, a plume atop
his hat. There in the 4,500-seat Grand Palace in Branson, Mo., the
curtain would rise on him, a toy soldier, dancing around a giant
Christmas tree. Brett, in the spotlight!</LD>
<LD>   There was a snag, though. He couldn't travel unless he had a
parent with him.</LD>
<TE>   The roadshow runs 11 weeks. The three other kids in the cast had
stay-at-home moms, but Brett's parents both work. "We have to do
this," his father said when Brett made the cut. "We'll work it out
somehow." And he picked up the phone.</TE>
<TE>   What he made happen last year was a smash hit, and this year,
there's an encore. Other kids have stage moms. Brett Lockley has a
supporting cast.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Stage grandpa, maternal</TE>
<TE>   Somebody has to make sure Brett doesn't leave his costumes on the
dressing room floor. Bossie Davis' stay in Branson is the longest; he
flew out for two weeks after stopping by Deer Park Middle School to
pick up the latest batch of schoolwork for his grandson. Retired now,
Bossie, 67, will head to Phoenix for another week when the show moves
there.</TE>
<TE>   At the handoff at the Springfield/Branson Airport, he gets a list
of instructions. It's the same as last year: Brett gets up at 6:30
a.m. and leaves the condominium at 7:15 a.m. for school. Bossie and
the parents of the other three children take turns driving the
children to school and picking them up at noon. A quick lunch and
Bossie must have his grandson back at 1 p.m. for the 2 p.m. show.
Then, he sits, sometimes until 11 p.m. The children alternate
performing in the two daily shows, and backstage, where they must
remain even when they aren't in the show, granddad and grandson play
on Brett's laptop. PlayStation 2. So many crazy games. Bossie is not
that good at any of them.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The stage mom</TE>
<TE>   If she didn't need a paying job, she could be a stage mom forever.
Sharon Lockley, 44, an accountant for the city of Baltimore, was the
first to travel to Branson, as she was last year, to get her son
settled and to organize things for those to follow; she stayed 17
days. "The point person," the company manager calls her. She set up
the schedule with other parents to take the children to school each
morning. Wherever there's a "Sharon" on the schedule, a Lockley fills
in. She bought groceries for the condo where Brett and relatives stay
and picked up keys, car and parking permit.</TE>
<TE>   She was as anxious as Brett to meet the two new girls who would be
paired with Brett and the other boy, Mark. She loves it out there,
the people, the backstage and the awe she feels each time she sees
her son perform. She was in the drama club and chorus in high school,
but she wouldn't dream of going as far as Brett. She's practical. She
wanted to earn a living, and she enjoyed numbers. Sharon speaks to
Brett every other day. He's not as homesick as he was last year, when
he left his new middle school classmates just as they began bonding.</TE>
<TE>   How a mom who audits Baltimore's budget and a dad who settles
insurance claims can produce a dancer -- two, actually; Brett's older
brother, Eric, 17, hopes to be an actor -- is a story of appreciating
gifts. She and her husband enjoy the arts, Sharon says, and their
sons have a God-given talent. "They were a gift to us, and we could
nurture that gift."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The stage dad</TE>
<TE>   When his son didn't seem interested in football or baseball, he
gave in and went along for the ride. Robert Lockley, 45, a senior
claims adjuster for Progressive Insurance, knew Eric had talent when
he danced an amazing beat to "Rock Steady" by the Whispers while in
diapers. But to have two sons who could dance, well, that was a
surprise.</TE>
<TE>   The surprise was greater, given how Brett's talent revealed
itself. He was allowed to sit on the stage at Eric's dance school and
watch from age 2. Offered the chance to dance himself at age 5, Brett
declined; he didn't want to join, only watch. The Lockleys took Brett
to shows but got no reaction, though when they saw Brett re-create
the dance steps at home they realized the whole thing was in his
head. One day when Brett was 8 and Eric was rehearsing for "The
Nutcracker," Robert went to pick up the boys at dance school and
Brett ran over to say he, too, was going to be in the show. "I said,
'How? You're not even in the school!' " Robert recalls.</TE>
<TE>   But once Brett put on the soldier costume the school owner handed
him, he knew every step. He excelled after that, winning competitions
to perform at Disney World, on cruise ships and, last summer, to
study at the Pennsylvania Ballet's Rock School in Philadelphia for
six weeks. Robert let him go for three.</TE>
<TE>   Robert's tour in Branson followed Sharon's, so one parent could
remain with Eric. "Both of our kids have taken us places," he says.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Stage grandma, maternal</TE>
<TE>   Loretta Davis, 65, is again taking vacation from her job as
accounting assistant in the Baltimore purchasing office to spend a
week with Brett. Being backstage at a big show for the first time
unearthed memories, memories of herself in third grade, when she
played the wife of the giant in "Jack and the Beanstalk." She
trembled all over, she recalls, but it was so much fun. "Maybe I
missed my calling."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   More stage grandparents</TE>
<TE>   Robert and Alease Lockley, 75 and 72 respectively, are retired,
and they drove the 921 miles to Branson again this year. They stayed
two weeks, including Thanksgiving, and, if needed, they'll happily
return to do Brett's laundry and get him to class on time.</TE>
<TE>   There was Brett's well-being to consider -- they are so proud of
him -- and their own curiosity. How does a theater work? "As the
audience, we see the glamour. When you're sitting backstage, you see
all the hard work," Alease says. Every day last year, they watched
the Rockettes get made up, elves run for a change of costume, and
mothers of the two girls put up their hair in rollers. Then they'd
watch the show.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The stage godmother</TE>
<TE>   When Brett needed friends, she waved her magic wand. Sherrin
Stokes-Fowlkes, 45, was between jobs last year when Brett won the
role, and his parents asked for her support. With no kids -- just
Sherrin and her husband -- she was an easy target. Of course she
would spend a week with her godson! It was a good thing, too, because
when she arrived in Branson, Brett was missing his mom real bad. She
relished the roles of chief comforter and stage mom, of being
introduced as the latest Lockley, and meeting the most amazing
people. "I got to meet farmers who take the day off once a year, come
to Branson and see four different shows, then run back and take care
of the cows," she recalls.</TE>
<TE>   A part-time travel agent, Sherrin hired a bus and put up fliers
advertising a trip to see him. In the end, 24 people, including
Brett's best friend, members of his church, New Psalmist Baptist,
family and co-workers of Sharon and Robert made the nine-hour
journey.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The stage uncle</TE>
<TE>   When Wayne Lockley, 47, a recently retired Navy pilot, heard from
his younger brother, Robert, last year that his nephew hoped to join
the traveling Christmas show, the first thing he asked about was the
date of the move. He was the best choice to stay with Brett during
the show's move from Branson to Cincinnati, Wayne figured, because in
23 years with the Navy, he had moved plenty.</TE>
<TE>   It helped that his daughter's high school soccer season was
finished, and his wife, a teacher, was accustomed to his being away.
With 30 days' annual leave from the military, he could spare five
days for Brett. He flew an F-18 part-way, to Dallas, where he had
Navy business, before boarding a commercial flight to Branson. After
that, it was boring. He hung out in the green room, where performers
relax, with movies or books and stretched his legs. Every day, he saw
one show and during the other, he read airplane operating manuals.</TE>
<TE>   But it hasn't stopped Wayne from volunteering to move Brett again.
He enjoys meeting people, and this year he's taking a camera so he
can shoot outdoor light displays at night. Besides, when the cast
moves to Phoenix, they're flying!</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The stage aunt</TE>
<TE>   A one-time ballerina, she introduced the boys to dance. Debbie
Lockley, Robert's other sibling, was an early influence on Brett's
development. She danced until she turned 18 at the Peabody
Conservatory, and she told her brother, Brett's father, about a tap
dancing school when her older nephew was 2.</TE>
<TE>   She's the mother of a toddler herself now and business manager of
a company that makes cast-iron brake shoes for freight trains. She's
also a newcomer to the Lockley rotation. Debbie will meet him in
Phoenix.</TE>
<TE>   She, too, might cozy up in the green room, meet the cast, and
master the drive to the airport, where the handoff includes a big hug
from Brett, who thinks he is the luckiest guy in the world. "I am
grateful for everybody who can come and do this," he said on the
October day he packed his bags. "It is a long period of time, and it
shows their support for what I want to do."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, the supporting cast appears critical. Rarely mentioned in
a review, this one gets some kind words from company manager Floyd
Williams: He wishes Brett's mom and dad could stay the whole time;
they are so wonderful, and Bossie, well, Bossie "is so much fun. We
all love Bossie."</TE>
<TE>   His greatest fear is that he will forget the current Lockley's
name. Keeping track of 55 cast members, the Rockettes and three
mothers, no problem. But the constant rotation of people from this
"wonderful family keeps it fresh," he says -- and leaves him jealous.
In Branson, Williams says, "the consensus is that Brett has the best
family you could ever hope for."</TE>

<HD>Protested film wins NAACP's approval</HD>
<DH>Despite its tirade against black icons, 'Barbershop' gets a
top movie nomination from the group, which calls it positive overall.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Greg Braxton</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a sharp rebuke to a September protest led by the Rev. Jesse
Jackson and the Rev. Al Sharpton, the NAACP on Thursday saluted
"Barbershop" -- vilified by those black leaders for making fun of
civil rights icons Rosa Parks and Martin Luther King Jr. -- with
several NAACP Image Awards nominations, including outstanding motion
picture.</LD>
<LD>   Among the film's nominees was Cedric the Entertainer, who
portrayed an outspoken older barber making less-than-reverent
comments about Parks, King and Jackson. The actor was nominated for
outstanding supporting actor in a motion picture.</LD>
<LD>   The announcement of the nominations came during a press conference
for the 34th NAACP Image Awards ceremony, which honors the best in
black film, television, literature and music. The awards will be held
March 8 at the Universal Amphitheatre and shown in a edited version
March 13 on Fox.</LD>
<TE>   "Barbershop" and the actor were both harshly criticized by Jackson
and Sharpton last September, a few weeks after the film became a hit
with movie audiences. It is the highest grossing black-themed film of
the year.</TE>
<TE>   They were offended by one scene in which Cedric the Entertainer's
character goes on a verbal tirade, saying "Rosa Parks ain't do
nothin' but sit ... down." When others in the shop protest, he
continues, describing King in less than flattering terms and using
profanity in a reference to Jackson.</TE>
<TE>   Saying they were supported by members of Parks' and King's
families, Jackson and Sharpton called for a public apology from the
filmmakers and demanded that MGM remove the scene from its eventual
home video release. Sharpton went so far as to threaten a boycott of
the film. The leaders said Parks and King were among historical
figures who should never be disrespected. The protest eventually died
down without any formal action.</TE>
<TE>   "There indeed was a long discussion about this, because we were
well aware of the furor," said Vicangelo Bulluck, executive director
of the NAACP Hollywood bureau and producer of the awards ceremony.
"But the feeling is that the film is overall a positive film. In
regards to the issue about the material in the film, the NAACP is a
supporter of the 1st Amendment."</TE>
<TE>   Jackson and Sharpton could not be reached for comment.</TE>

<HD>Pieced from the fabric of their lives</HD>
<DH>Four generations of African American quilters are
celebrated in a new show at the Whitney Museum.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>The Whitney Museum's "Quilts of Gee's Bend," a collection of 60-odd
quilts from a remote corner of Alabama, has everything going for it:
fantastic art, profound humanity and a spectacular installation.</LD>
<LD>   The quilts, created by four generations of African American women
in a rural community called Gee's Bend, overwhelm the eye with
startling color and bold, idiosyncratic design. Some are elaborate
constructions of floral patterns, as if the maker had disassembled a
garden into tiny scraps and then whimsically reshuffled them.</LD>
<LD>   The vast majority, however, are muscular arrangements of fabric in
big swaths: thick bars of midnight blue and cream, stripes of yellow
corduroy against an earth-brown background; all the warm, weathered
hues and worn textures disposed in luminous asymmetries.</LD>
<TE>   "I like big pieces and long strips," one of the women, Annie Mae
Young, says in an oral history compiled for the catalog. "However I
get them, that's how I used them. I work it out, study the way to
make it, get it right, kind of like working a puzzle."</TE>
<TE>   According to the canonical interpretations of Western art,
abstraction grew out of myth, psychology and historical imperative.
But these quilts, made by poor women in the isolation of their
southern Alabama enclave, rival the best of what modernist painting
has to offer -- without the pretentious theoretical superstructure.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the quilts will remind you of works by Mark Rothko,
Barnett Newman and Frank Stella, but in some ways they're better.
Created under adverse circumstances by women using whatever came to
hand -- faded, patched-up jeans, canvas work shirts, worn-out dresses
-- to keep their families warm, the quilts have a human overlay that
immeasurably enhances their power to move us.</TE>
<TE>   Gee's Bend, with a population of about 700, is 30 miles southwest
of Selma at a bend in the Alabama River. For most of the 20th
century, it was nearly inaccessible, and the link to the past is
consequently strong: The vast majority of the townspeople are
descended from slaves who worked at one plantation. The area has
always been poor: Photographs of the town from the 1930s, when the
earliest of the quilts in the exhibit were made, describe lives led
in two-room log cabins.</TE>
<TE>   Quilts were the one note of exuberance during the Depression in
Gee's Bend, decorative but necessary sources of both visual and
physical warmth. In the months when the tasks of farming slowed,
mothers would make them for their children, eking as many covers as
they could out of flour sacks, the ticking from busted mattresses and
clothes too worn to put on again.</TE>
<TE>   The show opens with a roomful of quilts made out of work garb,
including one from 1950 by Lutisha Pettway composed entirely of
patched, frayed, stained and faded jeans. A glance is enough to
understand how much time the people of Gee's Bend spent in the fields
on their knees. But hung on the Whitney's walls, this evidence of
manual labor acquires an aesthetic force: It is also a minimalist
study in shades of blue.</TE>
<TE>   Robert Rauschenberg understood the narrative power of bedding when
in 1955 he glued the quilt he slept beneath onto a plank, along with
his pillows and sheets, slathered the whole thing with paint and
called it simply, "Bed." The Gee's Bend quilts require no
professional artist's intervention to express autobiographical
content. They are stitched together out of fabric, time and memory.</TE>
<TE>   In 1942, another woman, Missouri Pettway (many of the families in
town are named Pettway, after the plantation where their ancestors
worked) lost her husband and used his old pants and shirts to fashion
an elegiac and useful memento.</TE>
<TE>   "I going to take his work clothes, shape them into a quilt to
remember him and cover up under it for love," Missouri's daughter
later recalled her saying. And what more poignant way to honor a man
than to let him keep giving warmth even after his death?</TE>
<TE>   What makes these pieces so personal, even in the absence of a back
story, is the dialogue of shape and texture. Most quilts are made on
a pattern; the women of Gee's Bend composed each image more or less
from scratch, the way a painter does, following internal clues. A
shirttail might suggest an adjacent patch of corduroy; a pretty scrap
of turquoise cotton might call for the sateen of a pale-green
negligee. Yet these are not just haphazard products of circumstance
and a tradition of making-do. They spring from a whole village's
worth of self-assured imaginations.</TE>

<LD>An accidental entertainment, "Equilibrium" is a science-fiction
pastiche so lacking in originality that if you stripped away its
inspirations there would be precious little left. Among the referent
titles that flipped up on my mental Rolodex as I watched this
dystopic vision struggle to take hold were "Fahrenheit 451," "Dark
City," "Blade Runner," "Children of the Damned," "Soylent Green,"
"1984," various Philip K. Dick freakouts and John Woo adventures and,
of course, "The Matrix." Not a bad list as far as influences go, save
for the fact that these are the sort of touchstones that tend to make
bad imitations only look worse.</LD>
<LD>   In the future world of Librium, elite military officer John
Preston (Christian Bale) enforces the government-mandated no-feel
policy, which has eradicated the disease of "human emotion." Those
citizens dubbed "sense offenders," who don't take their daily dosage
of Prozium while indulging in soul-stirring no-no's such as music and
chintz wallpaper, are summarily processed into nonexistence. True to
formula, once Preston, the most elite of military elites, skips his
meds, he begins the inexorable slide toward feeling -- first he
starts worrying about his kids, then a stray puppy and, increasingly
and most dangerously, a sense offender (Emily Watson) slated for
execution.</LD>
<TE>   Written and directed by Kurt Wimmer, who previously directed
something called "One Tough Bastard" and had a hand in the
screenplays for "Sphere" and "The Thomas Crown Affair," "Equilibrium"
unfolds in familiar if watchable fashion for its first hour. Bale,
looking a lot like his rampaging automaton in "American Psycho,"
moves through the smoke and mirrors, twirling his guns and snapping
his overcoat without once cracking a smile. Actor Taye Diggs enters
soon after Sean Bean exits, as does William Fichtner. Trouble brews,
but nothing much happens until a climactic fight scene so risible it
summoned up two final referents, Austin Powers and the Three Stooges,
twinned inspirations that threw off not just the equilibrium of the
film but that of this reviewer.</TE>
<TE>   -- Manohla Dargis</TE>
<TE>   "Equilibrium." MPAA rating: R for violence. 1 hour, 47 minutes. In
general release.</TE>

<HD>A WWII drama that tries hard</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Kevin Thomas</AU>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Involving the construction of a railroad by prisoners of war, "To End
All Wars" is inevitably reminiscent of "The Bridge Over the River
Kwai," and it has a present-coda in the manner of "Saving Private
Ryan." Taking an inspirational approach to the standard brutal World
War II Japanese POW drama, it is not remotely in the league of those
two classics. It is solidly crafted enough from inherently powerful
true-life material, however, that WWII buffs and religiously inclined
audiences won't be disappointed.</LD>
<LD>   There's potentially a much stronger film in the memoirs of Ernest
Gordon, a survivor of the Chungkai camp in the Burma-Siam jungle, but
his adapter, Brian Godawa, and director David L. Cunningham take a
relentlessly straight-on, by-the-book approach to a story rich in
possibilities for complexity and irony. The result is ultimately more
grueling than rewarding.</LD>
<LD>   Gordon (Cieran McMenamin), a young Scots captain, is among a small
group of Allied soldiers captured in 1942 after the Japanese invasion
of Singapore. In his group are defiant Maj. Ian Campbell (Robert
Carlyle) and Lt. Jim Reardon (Kiefer Sutherland), a cynical Yank. The
Japanese military officers in charge of the camp are fanatic emperor
worshipers who see their prisoners as inferiors to be treated
savagely for the slightest infraction.</LD>
<TE>   Those who resist merely make everything worse, especially with the
advent of the arduous construction of the "Railway of Death,"
intended as a supply line for the invasion of India. Supported by the
deeply spiritual Dusty Miller (Mark Strong), Gordon establishes an
informal Jungle University to raise the morale of his fellow POWs,
which in turn sparks an ever-expanding spiritual awakening throughout
the camp that Campbell regards as a threat to his dream of escape.</TE>
<TE>   The notion that a fellow prisoner could be a greater enemy than
one's casually sadistic captors is chilling and worthy of further
development than it gets here.</TE>
<TE>   "To End All Wars" is entirely professional but could have been a
lot more rewarding.</TE>
<TE>   -- Kevin Thomas</TE>
<TE>   "To End All Wars." MPAA rating: R, for strong war violence and for
some language. Running time: 1 hour, 57 minutes. Exclusively at

<HD>Spinning oldies that don't sound moldy</HD>
<DH>K-Earth marks its 30th anniversary by continuing to
fine-tune its formula for what constitutes a classic.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Carney</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Watergate and the Vietnam War were making the country feel nostalgic,
yearning for less weighty times and tunes from the '50s and '60s. The
social environment would make "American Graffiti" an unexpected box
office hit the following year, but in 1972 a new station debuted in
Los Angeles playing what it called "oldies" music: K-Earth 101.</LD>
<LD>   KRTH-FM (101.1) had been simulcasting its far more popular sister
station, KHJ-AM (980), which was spinning the latest hits, such as
"Lean on Me" by Bill Withers and "Let's Stay Together" by Al Green.</LD>
<LD>   Of course, now those are oldies too, getting heavy airplay on
K-Earth. But that doesn't mean songs of a certain age automatically
join the playlist, like a musical membership in AARP. As a current
station commercial says, "Obviously they're not making any new
oldies. Otherwise you might hear something like this," followed by
the cacophony of a punk song.</LD>
<TE>   KRTH program director Jay Coffey said the cutoff seems to be 1979.
Anything after that, listeners lump in the genre of '80s music --
they don't want to admit, he said, that the songs they listened to in
high school could be oldies. This even though -- let's face it -- U2
and the Police appeared more than 20 years ago and are now older acts
than the Supremes and Beach Boys were when K-Earth was launched.</TE>
<TE>   So could Men at Work and A Flock of Seagulls ever play alongside
the Temptations and the Four Tops?</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know if '80s music is going to have the same legs as '50s
or '60s music," Coffey said. He said the station did try playing the
Police and some other contemporary acts a few years ago. "No matter
how hard we tried to mix it and make it work," he said, "people said
they don't belong on an oldies station."</TE>
<TE>   But even some older bands, and certain songs by KRTH regulars,
can't get on its airwaves because of the format's parameters.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a big break between oldies and classic rock," KRTH
general manager Pat Duffy said. "Aerosmith is an oldies act now, but
we can't play them." They can play the Rolling Stones'
"Satisfaction," for example, but "Tumblin' Dice" "wouldn't fit us,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   Critics have griped about the station's repetitive playlist,
saying that it doesn't fully mine the reservoir of great songs
available from the '50s, '60s and '70s. But management makes no
apologies about using only a few of the best nuggets.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a hit format," Duffy said. "When people tune into an
oldies station, they don't want to hear the B-sides."</TE>
<TE>   In Los Angeles, where stations fight over tenths of a percentage
of audience share, and where listeners flip the dial without
hesitation, Coffey said K-Earth wants to make sure that listeners
hear their favorite songs when they land on 101, and stick around.
"Everybody has five different radio stations, and you have to be
really selective what you put on the air, or you're going to lose
people," Coffey said.</TE>
<TE>   "If I don't turn my hits around really fast, they're not going to
hear the songs they want to hear," he said. "I have to really pay
attention to mass appeal."</TE>
<TE>   That's why the station assiduously tests songs twice a year on
hundreds of listeners, to make sure the audience is getting exactly
what it wants.</TE>
<TE>   The station plays a 10-second hook and asks survey participants to
rate the record. An approval rating of even 55% is about as low as
the station can go, Coffey said. "That means you're losing 45% of
your audience."</TE>
<TE>   But the research has given the station its catalog of 700 songs
and highlighted which ones listeners never seem to tire of. "We've
found the records that are the classics -- 'Unchained Melody,' 'My
Girl.' "</TE>
<TE>   "You have to make old songs sound fun and refreshing. We look at
them as if they're brand-new records and play them that way," Coffey
said. "Don't make it sound as if it's an old person's station."</TE>
<TE>   Yet not every former hit stands the test of time. Bobby Sherman
was a teen idol; Coffey said his songs now rate about 22% approval.
Aretha Franklin's "Natural Woman" gets regular spins, while Helen
Reddy's "I Am Woman" does not. "Hound Dog" By Elvis Presley -- yes.
"Puppy Love" by Donny Osmond -- no.</TE>
<TE>   "If you played all the music from 1972 or 1967, you wouldn't have
a station people would listen to," Duffy said.</TE>
<TE>   But even an oldies station can evolve, and K-Earth has gone
through several changes in the past three decades. In the late '70s
and early '80s, the station mixed in some current music with the
oldies, Coffey said. It was automated and DJ-free for a time, until
1984. And in the early 1990s it tried to broaden its music mix, but
ratings fell with the arrival of the new selections, he said.
"Everything from the Carpenters to Foreigner. We pared it down, got
rid of the music that really didn't fit," he said -- including the
Carpenters and Foreigner.</TE>
<TE>   K-Earth debuted sometime in October 1972, although Coffey said no
one seems to have bothered marking the exact date.</TE>
<TE>   "It wasn't a momentous thing, because KHJ was so huge in '72," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   But Duffy said the station isn't that interested in making a fuss
about the anniversary, anyway. He said some listeners don't want to
be reminded that their favorite songs are 30 years old or older, and
the station's focus is on sounding current.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't dwell on the past," talking about "this date in
history," or draft dodging or Vietnam, Duffy said. "We don't go
there."</TE>
<TE>   He called the station a safe harbor, where parents can listen with
their children and know the morning show won't use bawdy humor, for
instance.</TE>
<TE>   Coffey described K-Earth as a "release valve." "We stay away from
Iraq and we stay away from terrorism. People come here to have a good
time. We're entertainers, not news people."</TE>
<TE>   Once again, the love songs and upbeat ditties of the 1950s and
'60s are distracting listeners from war and domestic strife.
K-Earth's playlist and presentation make it a cheerful spot on the
dial -- even people who don't care for the music don't dislike the
station, Duffy claims. And they all know the station, or at least one
tune from it: its insidious, memorable jingle -- the Johnny Mann
singers' improbably upbeat "K-Earth-1-0-1!"</TE>
<TE>   "If you tell people you work at K-Earth," Duffy said, "they'll
sing the jingle back to you."</TE>

<HD>Magic from Kantorow's baton</HD>

<LD>Visa problems derailed French conductor-violinist Jean-Jacques
Kantorow's scheduled Pacific Symphony debut last year.</LD>
<LD>   But officialdom was satisfied the second time around, and Kantorow
took the helm Wednesday at the Orange County Performing Arts Center
-- and the orchestra took amazing flight.</LD>
<LD>   Balance, transparency, unanimity, accuracy, vibrant musical
intelligence -- all the desirable qualities that make orchestral
ensemble a thrilling cooperative event emerged as Kantorow led music
by Mozart, Faure and Bizet.</LD>
<TE>   The Overture to Mozart's "Don Giovanni," which the Pacific
Symphony or the majority of its musicians have played time and again
both as a concert work and for Opera Pacific, has probably never been
such a passionate and electric experience. The momentum never
slackened.</TE>
<TE>   Similarly, the orchestra has rarely shown so much subtlety and
mastery in French repertory. Faure's Incidental Music to "Pelleas et
Melisande" set the precedent for diaphanous but substantial textures,
and a connoisseur's discernment and blending of pale colors.</TE>
<TE>   Bizet's buoyant Symphony in C, written when the composer was 17,
provided delight and opportunity for appreciation in every measure.</TE>
<TE>   In both works, Barbara Northcutt was the outstanding oboe soloist.</TE>
<TE>   Mozart's Violin Concerto No. 4, which opened the program, by no
means had augured that well.</TE>
<TE>   Conducting and serving as soloist, Kantorow led a hasty, driven
performance in which he pushed himself and the orchestra.</TE>
<TE>   Phrases fell one on top of another, and the music didn't breathe.
His tone was golden but wiry. Then he took the podium for Faure, and
the magic began.</TE>

<HD>From 'This' to 'That,' the plot got lost, not the patter</HD>

<AU>Manohla Dargis</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the slapdash comedy "Analyze That" Robert De Niro and Billy
Crystal reunite to toss around the sort of cheap jokes that Crosby
and Hope used to take on the road to wherever. As with "Analyze
This," the comedy that first brought the big-screen odd couple
together, the new film hinges on the high concept of Crystal's shrink
nervously dispensing psychiatric help to De Niro's mobster, a
gangster with a potentially lethal grasp on the therapeutic process.
The difference being that this time there isn't much of a story to
get in the way of the reluctant icon and the professional jester
going through their well-oiled paces.</LD>
<LD>   The new film finds De Niro's character, Paul Vitti, behind bars in
Sing Sing trying to dodge an assassin. He stages a phony psychotic
breakdown that delivers him out of the general inmate population, a
stratagem that hinges on, of all things, "West Side Story."
Subsequently (and unconvincingly) released into the care of Ben Sobel
(Crystal), the mob boss moves into the psychiatrist's house, where he
endures the indignities of curfew and the disdain of the doctor's
wife (Lisa Kudrow). In a purported effort at rehabilitation, he also
struggles in the everyday work world, bombing out as a car salesman,
a maitre d' and a jewelry salesman, before landing a gig as a
consultant on a TV series about suburban Mafiosi mischievously called
"Little Caesar."</LD>
<TE>   Naming the show after a moldering 1930s film is one of the slyer
digs, even if as with so many of the setups, it doesn't play out as
fully as it should. "Analyze This" opened in March 1999, almost one
month to the day before the "The Sopranos" wrapped its first
celebrated season. By the time the first film hit theaters, the
series had already drained the novelty from the conceit of a mob boss
enfeebled by panic attacks, as well as the perils of the
gangster-psychiatrist dynamic. Four years later, with the television
series now elevated into the annals of pop classics, the new movie
plays better than the original mostly because the filmmakers are no
longer trying so hard to impress with all that sincere couch talk,
which until recently "The Sopranos" always did better anyway.</TE>
<TE>   Having ditched the comic-drama of the modern mobster, director
Harold Ramis, aided and abetted by co-writers Peter Steinfeld and
Peter Tolan, instead eases along on sight gags and shtick, keeping
the film aloft by the sheer weightlessness of purpose. The jokes are
delivered with all the surprise you get with filmmaking on cruise
control, but Ramis and Co. seem to be having a good time and every so
often they do manage to slide in a bit that's so wily and understated
it nearly avoids detection. Indeed, one of the film's wittiest
touches verges on the conceptual: the casting of an uncredited
Anthony LaPaglia as the star of "Little Caesar." A native Australian
who's often cast as an Italian American, LaPaglia blows up just the
right amount of bluster as a counterfeit gangster, a reminder that
even fantasies like Tony Soprano are fantasies nonetheless.</TE>
<TE>   "Analyze That" is filled with such throwaway diversions. Kudrow
doesn't get enough to do other than to periodically pop in to show
off her impeccable timing, reminding you yet again that this
comedian, a screwball natural, was born seven decades too late. All
that Kyle Sabihy, the actor who plays Sobel's son, Michael, needs to
do to register as funny is lurk at the edge of the frame, principally
because he looks like the world's sweetest soccer thug (or a very
young Uncle Fester). Joe Viterelli, again playing Vitti's sidekick
and driver, achieves a similar effect simply with his refrigerator
bulk and well-worn mug. Both actors are confirmation that no matter
how precision-machined the jokes, comedy is always more about faces
and bodies than gags and punch lines, which is why what finally
matters most in "Analyze That" is De Niro.</TE>
<TE>   A veritable King Kong of a screen presence as compared to
Crystal's jabbering rhesus monkey, De Niro fared badly in the first
film in part because he was still in the midst of a startling
metamorphosis. The actor once acclaimed as the greatest of his
generation had, increasingly, been marking time in nugatory work and
the comedy only seemed like another low. He'd been funny before, in
Martin Brest's "Midnight Run," in which Charles Grodin's neurotic
accountant paved the way for Crystal's jittery shrink, as well as in
Martin Scorsese's "King of Comedy," a brilliant testing ground for De
Niro's comedy of menace. But never before had the joke seemed at his
expense, as it did with "Analyze This." The barbs didn't feel aimed
at De Niro's character as much as the crazies and heavies he had
inhabited: It was as if the actor were launching an assault on his
own legacy. In hindsight, that seems to be exactly what he was doing.
De Niro has been criticized for the poor quality of the roles he's
taken in recent years, even by the likes of "Taxi Driver" writer Paul
Schrader, but more and more it seems as if he hasn't had much of a
choice.</TE>
<TE>   After all, he'd reached the summit of his abilities in films such
as "Taxi Driver" and "Raging Bull" -- where else could he go? If his
descent into the quotidian hasn't always been smooth there is
something worthy about the very effort. De Niro may be lining his
pockets by taking on roles such as Paul Vitti, but he's also
dismantling a mystique.</TE>
<TE>   The comedy of the performance doesn't just hinge on our
familiarity with De Niro's lineup of thugs and villains; it feeds off
that very familiarity, as well as our fondness for one of the
virtuosos of modern screen monstrosity.</TE>
<TE>   With each Vitti scowl we catch a glimpse of Jake LaMotta, a flash
of the tattooed wacko from "Cape Fear." When De Niro stares into the
camera here, his rubbery features molded into a grimace of
resignation, you're not only laughing at the face in front of you but
all the faces that gave this one shape.</TE>
<TE>   Even when they don't always add up, these are movies in which he
can shrug off the burden of being Robert De Niro. Where the star who
was Travis Bickle can again freely assume the part of the great
character actor -- if only this time to ask, "You laughin' at me?"</TE>

<HD>'Planet' treasured for new techniques</HD>
<DH></DH>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Treasure Planet," the animated, futuristic version of Robert Louis
Stevenson's "Treasure Island," isn't breaking any box-office records.
But it is breaking new ground in a number of ways.</LD>
<LD>   The ship's captain (Emma Thompson) is female, a clipped,
hard-nosed sort who delivers lines like "Don't be daft" to her
predominantly male crew. But the cyborg-pirate John Silver (Brian
Murray) may be the most cutting-edge of all. Though movies such as
"Tarzan" mixed hand-drawing with computer graphics, this is the first
time both techniques have been used to create a single character.</LD>
<LD>   Eric Daniels ("Who Framed Roger Rabbit," "The Rescuers Down
Under") took on Long John's mechanical aspects, while Glen Keane
("Aladdin" and "The Little Mermaid's" Ariel) assumed responsibility
for fleshing out the rest of the character by hand. Taking on this
assignment, he says, was his way of preserving tradition in an
increasingly computerized age.</LD>
<TE>   "To me, an animator is an actor who acts with his pencil," he
explains. "I wanted to be at this juncture of computer and
hand-drawn, speaking for artists who want to draw."</TE>
<TE>   The two techniques are generally like oil and water, Daniels says,
one using the intuitive part of the brain and the other, the more
technical. But in this case, the marriage worked. Keane would sketch
out the robotic areas, which Daniels scanned into the computer. Using
one without the other, they agree, would have been virtually
impossible.</TE>
<TE>   "The computer is a master of symmetry," Daniels says. "Though it's
great at creating robotic arms, imperfection is inherent in humans.
Expression is best conveyed in drawing. As they say, the computer
makes easy stuff hard and hard stuff easy."</TE>
<TE>   The duo first tackled Silver three years ago, turning out 500
versions along the way. The mandate: to create a heavy, cast-iron,
robotic look rather than a high-tech feel -- as though Stevenson had
written a futuristic sci-fi tale using 19th century technology,
co-director Ron Clements suggested.</TE>
<TE>   A trip to Griffith Park's Travel Town gave animators the feel of
bulky old steam engines, and checking out junkyards provided
additional leads. In the end, Silver's skull plate was inspired by a
locomotive wheel and his knee by an ironing press. "The challenge was
to connect the mechanical to Silver's heart and soul, as though it
was attached to the nerves," Keane recalls. "We wanted the movement
to be naturalistic, revealing something of his character."</TE>
<TE>   In one particularly demanding sequence, Silver had to chop
space-shrimp at lightning-fast speed. At Benihana restaurant, Daniels
and Keane studied the moves of a Japanese chef and drew on mechanical
references as well. Brass lawn sprinklers go slowly in one direction
and speed up in reverse, Daniels observes. It took two weeks to
design a rotating blade with knives at right angles that put the chef
to shame.</TE>
<TE>   Putting the right face on Silver was an ongoing puzzle -- cracked
only by entering the animal world. If Captain Amelia was a descendant
of cats and Professor Doppler (David Hyde Pierce) a member of the dog
family, they reasoned, why not make the massive but accessible pirate
a warm, fuzzy bear? Another role model for Silver was Mickey Ryan,
Keane's high school football coach. A big-bellied, fun-loving
Irishman, he provided much-needed reassurance at a time of personal
defeat, just as Silver did for Jim Hawkins, the protagonist, (Joseph
Gordon-Levitt). Animators pictured a flame inside the hardened
pirate, one that ignites a bit when he meets the youth in whom he
sees himself.</TE>
<TE>   Characters already exist, Keane maintains. The challenge is to
unearth them. At a certain point, he insists, they virtually jump off
the paper.</TE>
<TE>   "Walking out of the studio one day, I realized that Silver was no
longer on the drawing board," he says.</TE>
<TE>   "He was as real as anybody. It was as though I could put my hand
on his shoulder. A character, if done right, takes on a life of his
own. Not until that happens will the audience believe in him."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   (BEGIN TEXT OF INFOBOX)</TE>
<TE>   The making of a cyborg pirate</TE>
<TE>   John Silver is the first character to be created by a mix of
hand-drawn and computer-generated animation. Below: a look at the
figure's features and inspirations.</TE>
<TE>   BODY: The bear-like Silver has a long torso, short legs, and huge,
paw-like hands. Brown, rather than the original purple, was used to
convey a "warm, more huggable" feel. Animators gave him weight, to be
in sync with Brian Murray's "rich, deep, butter-on-your-bread" voice.</TE>
<TE>   FACE: Wrinkled (like Robert Shaw), it had a more human feel until
co-director Ron Clements observed that Silver could be confused with
the long-lost father of the young protagonist -- one of only two
humans in the film. Instead, he's half-alien, half-robot.</TE>
<TE>   ROBOTIC ARM: Modeled after Popeye, it has a large forearm inspired
by a potbelly stove. Skinny biceps and holes (negative space) hit
home that there's nothing under the mechanical sleeve. A series of
cartridges rotates, accessing the tools Silver needs like old juke
boxes pulled out records.</TE>
<TE>   MECHANICAL LEG: Basically, a pogo stick -- a spring with a rubber
base. Also patterned after an asphalt compressor, a pneumatic drill
with a foot on the bottom of his calf.</TE>
<TE>   LEG: Conveys the fact that Silver is handicapped by the way he
moves -- walking with a limp and a hop, throwing his hip. He also
walks with his torso out, a la John Wayne.</TE>
<TE>   GOOD EYE: Most expression is in the eyes -- not only the key to
the emotions but a point of reference for the audience.</TE>
<TE>   CYBORG EYE: A super-telescopic nod to the patch of yesteryear, it
squints as Wallace Beery did in the film "Treasure Island." Mostly
shut, it's divided into upper and lower eyelids each with three
sections that open up like a flower. Color changes according to mood:
gold is normal, red is cool, hot red is angry -- helping the viewer
know what's happening in the</TE>
<TE>   artificial organ.</TE>
<TE>   MOUTH: Gap-toothed (like David Letterman), Silver also has dimples
to humanize him and convey his friendly side. Like Beery, he talks
out of the side of his mouth to suggest duplicity.</TE>
<TE>   BELLY: Putting the belt below the belly button conveys a
swashbuckling, beer-drinking type. (Above it would have connoted a
"respectable professor.") Probably a pretty handsome guy when he was
young but a lifetime of drinking and carousing has taken its toll.</TE>

<HD>Stern needs a lesson in 'less is more'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Don Heckman</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ever wonder how many notes can be jammed into a single jazz guitar
solo?</LD>
<LD>   Mike Stern seemed in search of the answer Tuesday in his opening
set at Catalina Bar &amp; Grill. The multiple-Grammy nominee, whose
resume includes gigs with Miles Davis as well as Blood, Sweat &amp;
Tears, devoted virtually every improvisation in his lengthy program
to finger-busting excursions across the strings of his guitar.</LD>
<LD>   There's nothing wrong with technical virtuosity, of course, even
for its own sake. And it's no surprise that Stern's appearances at
the club usually draw crowds of young musicians, taking advantage of
the student discounts for the late shows.</LD>
<TE>   But his most recent album, "Voices," released in late 2001,
revealed a musical perspective reaching well beyond his unquestioned
ability to generate fabulous flurries of notes. Although he played
selections from the album in his set -- selections in which his
melodic interaction with tenor saxophonist Bob Sheppard attractively
recalled the musically multilayered qualities of the record -- far
more of the program was dedicated to high-intensity rhythmic burners.</TE>
<TE>   Stern was aided in that respect by bassist Victor Wooten and
drummer Lionel Cordew, two experts in propulsive excitement. By the
close of the set, however, the rhythmic drive and the nonstop torrent
of notes had largely lost their power to excite. And one wished for
fewer notes and a much more insightful view of the Stern art that
lies beyond his technical proficiency.</TE>

<LD>Call it the gap in the Gulf.</LD>
<LD>   On Jan. 16, 1991, CNN earned a stunning scoop by broadcasting from
Baghdad in the early hours of the U.S.-led air strike on the Iraqi
capital that began that year's brief Persian Gulf War.</LD>
<LD>   The messengers -- anchor Bernard Shaw and reporters Peter Arnett
and John Holliman -- were hunkered down perilously in their suite in
the Al Rashid Hotel, at one point hiding under furniture to escape
detection from Iraqi security officials. Even under duress, they
delivered vivid first-person telephone accounts of the bombardment
after ABC, CBS and NBC had lost contact with their own reporters at
this hotel quartering Western media in Baghdad.</LD>
<TE>   From their vantage point overlooking the city they saw red tracers
from anti-aircraft guns streak the night sky. They heard the booms,
and a microphone Holliman placed in a window beamed sounds of war to
an eavesdropping U.S. much as Edward R. Murrow used his CBS radio
microphone as an electronic megaphone during the London blitz at the
onset of World War II.</TE>
<TE>   As Allied bombers continued to clobber Baghdad, CNN's journalistic
victory was no less decisive. At one point in the evening, NBC anchor
Tom Brokaw was on the phone quizzing the CNN trio about the pounding
the Iraqis were taking. And Secretary of Defense Dick Cheney noted in
a press briefing that he, too, was getting his information about the
attack's accuracy from CNN in Baghdad.</TE>
<TE>   How were these CNN scrappers able to score such a beat against
more established, higher-profile competitors?</TE>
<TE>   The answer rolls out pulsatingly in "Live From Baghdad," an HBO
movie spun from a book by Robert Wiener, the former CNN senior
executive producer who was in that city coordinating the cable news
network's coverage in the months leading to the first air
bombardment.</TE>
<TE>   Morocco's Casablanca stands in for Baghdad as director Mick
Jackson mingles fresh reenactments with 1991 news footage in a story
as snappy as a CNN sound bite. Meanwhile, Michael Keaton has Wiener
launching wisecracks like Patriot missiles, Helena Bonham Carter is
fashionably disarrayed as veteran CNN producer Ingrid Formanek, and
David Suchet is a stony obstructionist as Ministry of Information
official Naji Al-Hadithi (now Iraq's foreign minister; he's also
called Naji Sabri). The performances work when the actors aren't
filling dramatic pauses by searching each other's eyes to
distraction.</TE>
<TE>   Is this how things really evolved behind the scenes, with Wiener
the swaggering, tenacious impresario, and CNN and Saddam Hussein
locked in a classic news media-newsmaker symbiosis that had each
trying to manipulate the other as a drum roll for war grew louder?</TE>
<TE>   HBO asks you to trust this TV account credited to Wiener, Richard
Chapman, John Patrick Shanley and Timothy J. Sexton. And much of it
is well documented.</TE>
<TE>   As the movie recalls, Wiener and his crew were continuously
censored, shadowed and spied on by the Iraqis. CNN clearly got jobbed
at times, most notably when unwittingly used by Iraq to rebut
unsubstantiated reports that its troops were plucking babies from
incubators in Kuwait City. But just as clearly, CNN was hardly the
Iraqi dupe alleged by such fatuous demagogues as Charlton Heston and
former Sen. Alan K. Simpson, who publicly questioned the patriotism
of Arnett when Iraq let him report from Baghdad through much of the
40-day war.</TE>
<TE>   Given today's headlines, and the looming prospect of another U.S.
invasion of Iraq, the timeliness of "Live From Baghdad" speaks for
itself, as media everywhere gear up for new war with the old one
still resonating in their minds.</TE>
<TE>   Would things be different for the media in a new war? The Pentagon
is now running boot camps for reporters while promising to have them
"embedded" in combat units, compared with the limited access granted
them in the earlier Iraq conflict, and more recently Afghanistan.
What's more, today's TV reporters can use video phones to deliver
sound and pictures from anywhere, a big upgrade from the four-way
phone lines used by CNN and others in 1991. And with the Arab network
Al Jazeera up and running, Iraq may no longer need a U.S. media
pipeline.</TE>
<TE>   Yet none of that addresses war reporting tainted by speed-induced
miscalls arising from pressure to be on the air first with the most.</TE>
<TE>   Although it tells its narrow story well, in a sense "Live From
Baghdad" buries the lead. HBO's movie about the heady 1991 success of
its AOL Time Warner sister company ends at a point -- just after the
initial bombing -- when the war's bigger media story was just
beginning.</TE>
<TE>   It was true, as Brokaw generously noted on the air that night,
that CNN no longer would be known as "the little network that could."
But coming days affirmed that a more significant threshold had been
crossed.</TE>
<TE>   With its skittish coverage of this air war, television became its
own Scud, wildly hurtling through space after bursting through all
journalistic restraints into some hazardous, uncharted technological
realm from which there would be no return.</TE>
<TE>   This was the gate that Bob Wiener and his CNN commandos flung open
that evening in Baghdad after arriving six months prior to a United
Nations deadline for Iraqi forces to withdraw from Kuwait.</TE>
<TE>   If Vietnam was the first living-room war, this was the first to
play out as a fly-by-the-seat-of-the-pants media spectacular, a
regular, honest-to-goodness show on TV starring TV.</TE>
<TE>   Along with incredible benefits, the medium's hair-trigger live
reporting on the war soon also yielded incredible confusion and
misinformation. Everything learned -- whether information or rumor --
was automatically sped on to viewers, as if bypassing the brain when
moving from ear to mouth. At any point, you could have heard
something that conflicted with something reported a half-hour
earlier.</TE>
<TE>   It meant that war coverage, like other epic stories, no longer
would evolve in the traditional way, for the process of reporting the
story had become the story. If correspondents of yesteryear were
measured by how well they shaped their stories, TV's Gulf War
correspondents got famous fast for being their stories. In fact,
never before had a war produced less real news than news stars, with
Baghdad boys Shaw and Holliman, for example, coming home to a
tickertape tribute on CNN prior to taking questions from the nation's
press in a conference call.</TE>
<TE>   Would a looser Pentagon war-reporting policy alter that mind-set?</TE>
<TE>   When returning to Baghdad after their incubator-babies adventure
long before the bombing began, CNN's crew was met by media swarms
wanting to hear the latest from Kuwait. Formanek is prophetic in the
movie regarding this blurry relationship of messenger to message.</TE>
<TE>   "You know what has happened?" she tells her colleagues. "We've
just become the story."</TE>

<LD>New York</LD>
<LD>   HBO's "Live From Baghdad" re-creates an almost quaint world, one
where the Iraqi government and CNN used each other during the Gulf
War in 1991 to the mutual benefit of both. Iraq largely got its story
out and CNN stayed on the air, exclusively, as the bombing of Baghdad
began.</LD>
<LD>   It was an unambiguous triumph that put the little network on the
map, to the envy of CBS, ABC and NBC -- at the time the other major
players covering the conflict. As the world girds for a rerun of the
Iraq-U.S. showdown, however, the largely laudatory and well-timed TV
movie from a CNN sister network may give the all-news network a
boost, but CNN faces much greater obstacles as it tries for a similar
decisive victory in Round Two of the war of the media coverage.</LD>
<TE>   In the intervening decade, the media landscape has been radically
rearranged, and not just by the 1996 launch of Fox News Channel and
MSNBC (which itself has a report Sunday night from Peter Arnett, one
of the three CNN reporters who earned acclaim in Baghdad.)</TE>
<TE>   Abroad, two British channels have come on strong. Rupert Murdoch's
Sky News was widely acknowledged for its reporting from Kosovo in the
late 1990s. Last year, the BBC, which has invested heavily since 1995
to expand its worldwide TV operations, arrived in Kabul, Afghanistan,
just before the ruling Taliban was ousted. An exuberant John Simpson,
the intrepid BBC world affairs editor on the scene, claimed to have
liberated the city ahead of Northern Alliance troops, which drew him
ribbing in the British press; nonetheless, he won an International
Emmy award last week for the reporting.</TE>
<TE>   But Western media may be trumped completely, this time, by the
Arab world, which has not one but two regional networks: the
Saudi-based Middle East Broadcasting Center, which has recently been
trying to upgrade its reporting, and the Qatar-based Al Jazeera.</TE>
<TE>   The latter is fast earning a mixed reputation for its renegade
reporting, which has alienated many Arab leaders, and at times
infuriated Washington, even as it has earned respect from viewers. It
was the only network transmitting live from Kabul when Western
bombing started in October 2001, and it has served, controversially,
since then as a conduit for pronouncements from terror network Al
Qaeda and Osama bin Laden.</TE>
<TE>   The 6-year-old network, started by Qatar ruler Sheik Hamad ibn
Khalifa al Thani, has been kicked out of Jordan and the Kuwaitis have
shut down its local offices, citing a lack of reporting objectivity.
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, meanwhile, was recently shown on
Iraqi television embracing Mohamed Jasim al-Ali, Al Jazeera's
managing director.</TE>
<TE>   A recent Gallup poll, which the polling organization says it
commissioned on its own, shows Al Jazeera gaining respect among its
viewers, at the expense of local state-owned broadcasters. Some 54%
of Kuwaiti residents said the channel is objective, as did 51% in
Jordan, topping the objectivity rankings for channels available in
the region; Middle East Broadcasting also earned relatively high
objectivity rankings. By contrast, CNN earned high marks for
objectivity from just 11% of Kuwaitis, 7% of Saudis and 5% of
Jordanians. Nonetheless, 40% of Kuwaitis said they had tuned in to
CNN at least once in the last week; tune-in was much lower in the
other two countries. CNN says it is available in 6 million Middle
East households.</TE>
<TE>   If things had developed differently, CNN and Al Jazeera could have
been colleagues, not rivals. Last year, according to several people
familiar with the situation, Al Jazeera tried -- and failed -- to
entice CNN to become a minority stakeholder. Since then, relations
between the two have cooled, after CNN aired an Osama bin Laden video
that Al Jazeera had received but didn't run. The two still maintain a
video-sharing arrangement.</TE>
<TE>   For leaders looking to get their message across in the U.S., CNN
has competition as well. Al Jazeera and Middle East Broadcasting,
which is financed by Saudi business leader Sheik Waleed bin Ibrahim
Al Ibrahim, are seen in the U.S. via satellite. Al Jazeera is
exploring becoming even more accessible by adding an English-language
voice-over audio option, with hopes for a full-blown English language
channel later next year.</TE>
<TE>   The BBC, too, has made U.S. inroads. In the space of a year, it
has ramped up its distribution and today its nightly newscasts air
commercial-free on public stations reaching 90% of U.S. viewers, as
well as on the BBC America cable channel. Abroad, building on the
back of its venerable BBC Radio presence, BBC World is gaining on CNN
in news coverage and distribution, says Richard Sambrook, BBC news
chief executive. The channel "is meant to be a global service for a
global audience," he says, and tries to avoid a particularly British
point of view. Still, he says, it is "an open question how many
channels the [world ad] market can sustain."</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, the easier access to distribution has other
governments contemplating whether they, too, need to be players on
the world scene. French President Jacques Chirac proposed a
government-financed "French CNN" during his spring reelection
campaign, but the idea was dropped because of its high cost. Instead,
the French are concentrating on news offerings on the internationally
distributed French-language TV5 channel, which is gaining modest U.S.
traction as a premium option on Echostar and digital cable systems
and on basic cable in parts of French-speaking Louisiana and Maine.</TE>
<TE>   CNN says it doesn't feel threatened by the new competition. The
CNN International channel reached a mere 10 million households
outside the U.S. in 1991; today, CNN International is in 170 million
homes, says Eason Jordan, CNN's chief news-gathering executive. "Yes,
there's more competition," he says, but the network has "grown
17-fold. And decision makers are still watching CNN." In recent
interviews, however, CNN executives said they see the future of their
international efforts more in foreign-language channels they are
mounting in partnership with local broadcasters in places such as
Turkey and Germany.</TE>
<TE>   In real life, unlike in the HBO movie, Jordan played a key role in
CNN's Baghdad triumph; more recently Iraqi officials have accused him
of being with the CIA. Like many media executives, one of Jordan's
key worries is that the new media landscape will mean a more hostile
environment for his reporters.</TE>
<TE>   CNN, which has had the most extensive ongoing Iraq presence of
U.S. networks in recent years, has been beefing up its staff in the
country and the region, as have its rivals. But staffing is subject
to the whims of the Iraqis, who periodically take issue with Western
reporters, prohibiting some from renewing their short-term visas and
threatening to expel others, even as they have recently welcomed
NBC's Tom Brokaw and ABC's Ted Koppel.</TE>
<TE>   "Certainly, the Iraqis view Western media differently," Jordan
says. Hostage-taking and chemical and biological weapons are a
concern; moreover, Western reporters in Baghdad must work from the
Ministry of Information building, which also includes two cabinet
ministers' offices, potential targets for U.S. bombs.</TE>
<TE>   At a recent HBO panel discussion after a screening of the CNN
movie, ABC News correspondent Deborah Amos said Al Jazeera in
particular is "changing the stakes" for Western reporters. "Saddam
doesn't need CNN this time. I don't think any of us knows what that
means for the reaction to American television reporters on the
ground," she said, but added, "I think we've seen our last safe war."</TE>

<HD>'Kingdom' is a fitting Richard Harris finale</HD>
<DH>He brings cunning and wit to the reworking of 'King Lear.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Kevin Thomas</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>That roguish charmer Richard Harris, who died Oct. 25 at age 72, had
a life and career full of dramatic ups and downs but fortunately
bowed out on a high note in "My Kingdom," Don Boyd's corrosive
reworking of "King Lear" as a gangster picture set in contemporary
Liverpool.</LD>
<LD>   Gaunt, silver-haired and leonine, he brings a tragic dimension and
savage full-bodied wit and cunning to the aging Sandeman, whose
underworld kingdom starts unraveling as a result of a flash of
paranoid bravado on his part.</LD>
<LD>   His life is shattered, so Sandeman acts on his long-cherished
desire to retire from a brutally successful life of crime.</LD>
<TE>   When his youngest and favorite daughter Jo (Emma Catherwood), an
ex-crack addict and current university student, turns her back on him
in disgust, he abruptly divides his kingdom between his two other
daughters, Kath (Louise Lombard), who has the looks of beauty queen
but is a hard-as-nails bordello keeper, and pony-tailed Tracy
(Lorraine Pilkington), whose father gave her ownership of a soccer
club, apparently a money-laundering operation for Sandeman.</TE>
<TE>   Both women have husbands as unsavory and scheming as they are and
both are determined to get the lion's share of a shipment of
narcotics their father has ordered from Amsterdam. Sandeman is
shocked to discover that both daughters have turned on him in revenge
for a lifetime of terror, humiliation and indifference. He suddenly
has only a little grandson for companionship as he watches all that
he has built up start tumbling down.</TE>
<TE>   "My Kingdom" has a highly intricate plot that seems to have been
trimmed here and there, creating occasional but passing haziness. .
The film does allow for a Shakespearean grandeur in its contemplation
of human destiny -- there are a few moments when the film assumes a
stately pace that verges on the static -- but Boyd fortunately never
quite forgets that "My Kingdom" functions first and foremost as a
no-holds-barred gangster picture, one enriched by the visual grandeur
of Liverpool's wintry beauty.</TE>
<TE>   It is further enriched by an array of pungent performances, which
include that of Lynn Redgrave as Sandeman's devoted but clear-eyed
wife. It is gratifying that in what proved to be his farewell
performance, Harris is teamed with an actress of Redgrave's subtlety
and stature.</TE>
<TE>   With his roles in the current hit "Harry Potter and the Chamber of
Secrets" and this film, Harris gave audiences something wonderful to
remember him by.</TE>

<HD>Placid landscapes? Not in this world</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Christopher Knight</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A landscape painting by Stephen Hannock seems to be less a record of
the place represented in the picture than it is the creation of a
place on the canvas. Hannock starts with what the mind already knows
of the world -- a famous tip from Jasper Johns -- and his work builds
on those abstractions. At Michael Kohn Gallery, 10 recent paintings
and an idiosyncratic installation by the New York artist meld realist
style with conceptual ideas.</LD>
<LD>   The watery loop in "Morning Field With Winding River" recalls the
famous Oxbow in the Connecticut River in western Massachusetts, but
it doesn't look like the actual site or the 19th century paintings of
it by such Hudson River landscapists as Thomas Cole. Rather than
suggesting the difficult but optimistic promise of a new day, the
sunrise mists over the water look toxic -- an irradiated violet-blue
haze rising toward an inferno of red and orange sky. A peculiar
symmetry to Hannock's wide, brushy view lends a sense of Rorschach
blot to the scene, as if it were both an accidental image and an
emotionally and intellectually evocative one.</LD>
<LD>   J.M.W. Turner lurks behind "Emerald Nocturne With River Rockets,"
with its Thames-ian view of explosions on a bridge seen across dark
water. Yet Turner's swirling spontaneity is undercut by Hannock's
rockets and their watery reflections.</LD>
<TE>   At the top of the darkly dramatic picture, sparks fall in a
necklace-like pattern, as if from carefully wrought fireworks at a
celebration. Meanwhile the bridge is a billowing conflagration, more
disaster area than saturnalia. A matching pair of white rocket trails
frames the scene, but they frame it in the mind as well: Their
suggestive patterns recall the inkblot drawings of Bay Area artist
Bruce Conner.</TE>
<TE>   The surfaces of Hannock's paintings are also strange. Described as
being made from "polished oil," they are built up through a process
of painting and sanding in sequential layers. The result is a hard,
shiny plane that provides sleek visual depth and reflectiveness,
while "unpolished" accents daubed in oil create a tactile relief on
the surface. The paintings appear tooled, a mix of hand craft and
machine.</TE>
<TE>   A clue to Hannock's method is found in one of the smallest
pictures: a smoky, atmospheric, golden glow that spreads across a
little horizontal field. Emerging from the center of the colored mist
is the artist's machine-printed name and address, while a postal mark
floats into view at the upper right. Painting a landscape on a
business envelope sends a message about personal correspondence,
while a subtle diarist element is revealed.</TE>
<TE>   That subtlety goes out the window in the wall-size installation of
scribbled notes, snapshots, clippings and assorted collages, which
offer a lament for the loss of two deceased friends (fellow artists
Fran and Gregory Gillespie). Heartfelt but grandiloquent, it's the
one false note in an otherwise engaging show.</TE>

<TE>   The mundane turns strange</TE>
<TE>   Catherine Murphy is ready for her close-up, and a daunting
prospect it is. In six oil paintings and two drawings at her solo
debut in Los Angeles, the Poughkeepsie, N.Y.-based artist, 56, zooms
in on worldly details that grow wondrously strange when intimately
examined.</TE>
<TE>   A painter's palette on a piece of cardboard, a scrap of notebook
paper, the pockets on a smock -- each mundane fragment becomes a
landscape of worried-over experience when scrutinized so closely. The
notebook page records anxieties about starting a new painting, and
the distress becomes monumental when writ so large. (The canvas is 4
feet tall.) Yet it's also resolved by the simple fact of the
painting's finished existence, where the ruled lines and the cursive
script reenact art's battle between conscious thought and intuition.</TE>
<TE>   The lush bodice of a green dress, ornamented with a brooch of
golden ribbon, begins to look like an alien planet on which a landing
craft has just set down. Feet shrouded in black stockings, standing
on a tiled bathroom floor, seem mournful and forlorn. A hand held up
before a garden view, as if to block a camera's lens, becomes
translucent in the summer sun, a web of veins beneath skin that's
tangled with surface wrinkles.</TE>
<TE>   These paintings are unthinkable without the cropping and
enlargements familiar from photography. But Photo-Realist they are
not. Murphy seems uninterested in camera vision per se, employing it
instead as a useful tool that is little different from her cardboard
palette. Self-scrutiny is her gambit, and her exceptional painterly
skill pulls us along for the eye-opening ride.</TE>
<TE>   In "Cathy," her name is written on a steamed-up window, through
which the barren limbs of wintry woods can be seen. So much of the
landscape has been painted out to create the fog where her name is
written that the canvas becomes a dizzying perceptual essay in the
dialogue between being and nothingness.</TE>
<TE>   The one direct self-portrait in this exceptional body of work
shows the artist staring grimly ahead, as if seen through a sheet of
glass on which an oval, a rectangle and a triangle have been painted.
(They're the color of dried blood.) Her face is framed by the
rectangle, which vertically mimics the horizontal rectangle of the
canvas that also frames the portrait. The oval, rectangle and
triangle suggest the common descriptions of possible shapes for a
human face. Here, the determined face of this artist virtually defies
a viewer to identify her as being the least bit common.</TE>

<TE>   Piecing together a green 'Manifesto'</TE>
<TE>   Earlier explorations of grids and cyber-maps are largely gone from
five of the six new paintings by Tam Van Tran at Suzanne Veilmetter
Los Angeles Projects. What remains is the prior sense of uncharted
depths of information lying just below the surface. These works lodge
themselves between a universe too big to see and a microcosm too
small to perceive. Those conflicting realms are drawn together into
uneasy alliance.</TE>
<TE>   Collectively titled "Beetle Manifesto," most of the paintings are
made on strips of paper that have been run through a crimping device
and then sutured together with thousands of staples. The strips are
randomly painted with brushy, emerald green pigment, which has been
mixed with chlorophyll and spirulina, a protein-rich micro-algae that
is sometimes called a super-food.</TE>
<TE>   The agglomeration of colored paper strips yields the look of an
evergreen forest seen up close. Meanwhile, the green brush marks on
crimped, corrugated paper offer a visual echo of the coiled shape of
the microscopic algae. Punched holes animate the lumpy surface with
tracks and trails, as if unseen insects had been munching on the
paper.</TE>
<TE>   The stapled sutures lend an aura of urgent, wounded distress to
the otherwise nourishing qualities of photosynthesis and sustenance.
Tran's highly original vision is grimly confident -- an agonizing
tone that seems exactly right for today.</TE>

<TE>   Triptychs capture urban panorama</TE>
<TE>   The three big photographic triptychs in the main room of Karin
Apollonia Muller's show at Karyn Lovegrove Gallery are savvy
portraits of L.A. Muller identifies something elusive yet distinct
about Los Angeles as a place, and her camera cleverly records it.</TE>
<TE>   Her photographs were taken in and around downtown, putative center
of this center-less city -- one to the west near Beverly Boulevard,
one to the north near Chinatown, one along Broadway looking toward
Bunker Hill. With filters, color has been washed out into a
silvery-white light that flattens the Southern California sky and
makes details something to be squinted at.</TE>
<TE>   Each triptych is an urban panorama. The central panels show a void
-- an empty lot or field surrounded by the jumble of urban density.
The flanking pictures show what lies to the right and to the left of
the central void, ordinary stuff that ranges from storefronts and
office buildings to residential neighborhoods and a used car lot.
Each picture is packed with visual incident, the prosaic poetry of
daily life.</TE>
<TE>   Tellingly, Muller's triptych portraits of L.A. can be acquired
whole or in parts. You have your choice of selecting the void, the
margins or any combination thereof. A more apposite public portrait
of this city would be hard to imagine.</TE>

<HD>Will 'Lizzie McGuire' get a chance to grow up?</HD>
<DH>Disney mulls what to do next with its hit show for
'tweens.' A prime-time series is pondered. But for now, production
halts.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Brian Lowry</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Lizzie McGuire," which chronicles the travails of a teenage girl,
has become a clear success for the Disney Channel. So why has the
show ceased production, with its sets put into storage?</LD>
<LD>   Because children's shows are repeated so frequently, the
Disney-owned cable network normally caps production of live-action
series at 65 episodes. In the case of "Lizzie," the channel
recognized it had a hit on its hands early and accelerated the pace
to complete that order while the program's 15-year-old namesake,
Hilary Duff, remained in her early teens.</LD>
<LD>   The question now is how next to exploit the property--a subject of
discussion within the Walt Disney Co., which, among other things, is
considering a prime-time series for the studio's broadcast network,
ABC.</LD>
<TE>   Currently, the existing TV show--which also runs on ABC's
Saturday-morning lineup--is only a part of the "Lizzie" empire. In
addition to having spawned a licensing bonanza, Duff recorded a pop
single, "I Can't Wait," through Disney's Buena Vista Records, and the
song has received heavy airplay on Radio Disney, a radio network
aimed at kids.</TE>
<TE>   A "Lizzie McGuire" film is in production as well, which Disney
will release theatrically in the spring.</TE>
<TE>   The Disney Channel also drew strong ratings earlier this year with
a movie, "Cadet Kelly," starring Duff.</TE>
<TE>   Even though the series is no longer in production, fans needn't
fear missing it any time soon. Original episodes will keep showing up
through 2003, with the latest, featuring Aerosmith's Steven Tyler
playing Santa Claus, premiering tonight.</TE>
<TE>   Rich Ross, the Disney Channel's president of entertainment, noted
that the shelf life tends to be shorter on children's programs. The
channel's niche involves targeting those in the 9-to-14 age
bracket--known in marketing circles as "tweens," meaning between
children and teenagers--who quickly outgrow even their favorite
shows.</TE>
<TE>   Disney also faces pressure to ensure its content is appropriate to
that age group, which would make continuing a show like "Lizzie
McGuire" a challenging proposition, Ross noted. Unlike
animation--where characters generally don't age--the stars of
live-action projects cannot be frozen in time.</TE>
<TE>   "The wheelhouse for us is in junior high and elementary school,"
he said. "High school is a whole different set of issues."</TE>
<TE>   Although talk of a network show is still in a nascent stage, there
is considerable precedent for graduating youthful stars from
children's programs to broadcast networks. Melissa Joan Hart went
from Nickelodeon's "Clarissa Explains It All" to "Sabrina, the
Teenage Witch," while Amanda Bynes--formerly of "All That"--stars in
the new WB network sitcom "What I Like About You."</TE>
<TE>   Those examples, however, teamed various studios, unlike the
cradle-to-high school synergy Disney hopes to achieve with
Duff--taking her from its cable platform to music, feature films and
possibly broadcast television, without ever leaving the Disney
family.</TE>

<HD>Cameron goes from 'Titanic' to the Bismarck</HD>
<DH>The filmmaker journeys 16,000 feet below the Atlantic to
find what sunk the Nazi warship.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Lynn Elber</AU>
<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The story of the ill-fated German warship Bismarck took hold of
filmmaker James Cameron as a youngster, when he watched the 1960
British movie "Sink the Bismarck."</LD>
<LD>   He saw it again recently and was unimpressed. "Not that great a
film. The special effects were terrible," said Cameron, who proved in
"Titanic" and "The Abyss" that he knows a thing or two about the
subject.</LD>
<LD>   But his fascination with the Bismarck was unabated and he
responded to it in grand manner: with a deep-sea excursion detailed
in a new Discovery Channel documentary.</LD>
<TE>   "James Cameron's Expedition: Bismarck," airing at 9 p.m. Sunday,
is a triumph of technology, offering crystal-clear pictures of the
ship that tumbled 16,000 feet below the Atlantic's surface.</TE>
<TE>   Through interviews with experts and survivors, documentary footage
and animation, the film re-creates the Bismarck's role in Nazi
Germany, the massive threat it represented to Britain and its final
battle.</TE>
<TE>   "Bismarck emerged from the whole madness of World War II as a ship
of legend," Cameron said in an interview, comparing its place in
history -- and in storytelling -- to that of the doomed passenger
ship Titanic.</TE>
<TE>   Preserved in their dark and distant ocean cradles, the ships
provide the opportunity to visit a "dimension that's almost outside
of time, where nothing changes, or changes very slowly," Cameron
said.</TE>
<TE>   The documentary is as much detective story as adventure, piecing
together evidence to determine how the Bismarck went down. Was it
pounded into oblivion as the British contend, or scuttled by a German
crew under relentless attack?</TE>
<TE>   The 42,000-ton Bismarck, the mightiest warship in the world when
commissioned for Adolf Hitler's navy in 1940, was both a menace and a
malevolent symbol to the British.</TE>
<TE>   Its attacks on convoys of food and equipment from North America
intended to sustain Britain were devastating. Then the Bismarck sank
Britain's great battle cruiser, the Hood, on May 24, 1941. All but
three of the Hood's crew of 1,400 were killed.</TE>
<TE>   "That simultaneously terrified the British and put them in a mode
which they probably do better than anybody, which is to knuckle down
and do what it takes," said Cameron, a quick study who consumed
history books for the expedition.</TE>
<TE>   On May 27, 1941, a British armada extracted its revenge,
bombarding the German warship with shells and torpedoes. Of its more
than 2,200-member crew, about 100 survived the attack.</TE>
<TE>   The Bismarck was found in 1989 on the ocean floor off the coast of
France by Robert Ballard, who had led the expedition that found the
Titanic four years earlier.</TE>
<TE>   "So I'm making a career following Robert Ballard around," Cameron
said with a laugh.</TE>
<TE>   Cameron found the Bismarck remarkable, even in defeat.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a fantasy shipwreck in that here it's sitting upright,
complete on the bottom, with guns still pointed in the positions they
were in during battle. Frozen in the steel is the record of that
battle, down to every shell fall," Cameron said.</TE>
<TE>   A detailed re-creation of the battle and an analysis by forensics
experts convinced Cameron that the British can take credit for the
kill but that the ship's crew sent it to the bottom.</TE>
<TE>   If Cameron has any qualms about provoking debate, it doesn't show.
He's relishing the adventures he creates for himself.</TE>
<TE>   "One big thing in my life is trying new things ... and now I'm
getting to combine filmmaking with exploration, so I'm happy as a
clam. This to me is the perfect crossing point of two big driving
vectors in my life."</TE>

<HD>Pianist Bronfman displays his dazzling technique</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Chris Pasles</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Pianist Yefim Bronfman is a poet of virtuosity and urbane, even
unctuous, surface. To his fans at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion on
Tuesday, that was enough. He could do no wrong in the finger-twisting
challenges of a four-part Celebrity Recital program. For others,
there was something missing. Call it depth.</LD>
<LD>   Certainly, Esa-Pekka Salonen's witty "Dichotomie" and Prokofiev's
thorny Sonata No. 7 revealed Bronfman's powerhouse technique at its
peak. Both have passages of relentless rhythmic drive, executed with
fearsome speed and security.</LD>
<LD>   Salonen's work, according to notes by the composer, depicts a
machine that acquires human feeling, then, in its second movement,
shifts to describe metaphorically the behavior of a natural organism.
Without losing any of its momentum, Bronfman made its woozy,
inebriated stirrings of life into graceful Chaplin-esque balletic
jokes.</LD>
<TE>   In Prokofiev's first of three wartime sonatas -- No. 7 was
composed in 1943 -- Bronfman was strong in its aggressive passages
and rather cool in its lyrical reflections, although this could be a
matter of taste.</TE>
<TE>   Similarly, he seemed most engaged in the exploratory second
movement of Beethoven's Sonata No. 7, with its abrupt contrasts in
dynamic and impromptu feel, than in its more traditional and here
rather perfunctory outer movements.</TE>
<TE>   The most satisfying conjunction of Bronfman's technique and poetry
was in the series of the first seven of 10 preludes that constitute
Rachmaninoff's Opus 23. There was nothing overwrought or lacking in
the velvety evenness of touch throughout the keyboard's dynamic
range. Even the "Military" prelude sounded fresh.</TE>

<HD>Life as an 'eco-stylist'</HD>
<DH>Danny Seo is riding the latest celebrity fad as a lifestyle
consultant to the stars. Recycled cashmere, anyone?</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Gina Piccalo</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Danny Seo, the 25-year-old Martha Stewart of the organic set, speaks
softly, but in that rapid-fire tongue so characteristically New York.
He rattles off the eco-friendly elements of his ensemble, which he
has worn to an important eco-friendly gala in Los Angeles populated
by newly eco-friendly celebrities. "This," he says, pointing to his
delicate wrist, "is a solar-powered watch. I'm wearing vegetarian
shoes from England -- Paul McCartney loves these." His tie, he says,
was picked from a clothing designer's trash bin. But the outfit is
just the beginning: "It's all about eco lifestyling."</LD>
<LD>   Seo, the erstwhile teenage environmental activist who won a place
in Oprah Winfrey's heart after writing several books on organic and
altruistic living (including one with Deepak Chopra), is leaving the
East Coast, repositioning himself as an "environmental lifestyle
consultant" and moving to Los Angeles. Here, he's working every
angle, pitching himself as TV-show host, starlet fashion stylist and
celebrity companion. Where better to establish oneself as the last
word in the latest fad?</LD>
<LD>   "A lot of trends start at the upper-income levels," says Seo.
"What I don't want to do is start mainstream and work my way up. It
goes the other way around."</LD>
<TE>   Although ripe for ridicule, Seo's new job title is sure to give
pause to a certain group of Angelenos, those animal lovers who refuse
to eat "anything with a face" but live in that black leather coat, or
those who drive gas-guzzling SUVs while nobly purchasing
biodegradable detergents. Seo believes he can dissolve that guilt and
confusion. "I find resources," he says.</TE>
<TE>   This slight-framed, bespectacled young man with the fresh face of
an adolescent will realign your complicated world, from fashion
(non-animal leather and recycled cashmere) to home design (freshwater
swimming pools and recycled hardwood floors) to altruism,
entertaining, kids, cooking and (pesticide-free) gardening -- all in
an ecologically conscious way. Of course, this kind of expertise
isn't cheap. Seo's styling fee starts at $2,000.</TE>
<TE>   At the Environmental Media Awards on Nov. 20 -- an event that
honored actress Blythe Danner for recycling, living in a
solar-powered home and driving an electric SUV, among other things --
Seo works the room of activists, organic chefs and actresses.</TE>
<TE>   Sometime-actress Anna Getty (stepdaughter to J. Paul III) wears
one of Seo's hand-picked pieces, a recycled black cowl-neck dress
shot with fine silver Lurex stripes. Her dark hair is slicked back in
a tight ponytail, revealing a tan and flawless face. Peripherally,
she resembles one of Andy Warhol's wealthy satellites, circa Studio
54.</TE>
<TE>   In the last two years, Getty and her friend actress Amy Smart have
started recycling and using biodegradable detergents. Smart has a
freshwater pool. They eat "mostly vegetarian and do yoga," Getty
says. "There's a whole way of life."</TE>
<TE>   Seo's approach is important, Getty believes, because "if we don't
start taking care of the world, we're going to be in trouble."
Besides, she adds, fashion needs a fresh look. She pulls at the
delicate fabric of her dress. "My friends looked at this and said,
'Oh my God! That's so "Dynasty"!' And I'm like, 'That's the point!' "</TE>
<TE>   Seo became image-savvy during adolescence. Born on Earth Day 1977,
by age 17 he was a media darling, featured in Newsweek for his youth
activism group Earth 2000, a national network that spearheaded
worldwide-environmental awareness campaigns. At age 19, he wrote
"Generation React: Activism for Beginners" (Ballantine Books, 1997),
an autobiographical take on his approach to altruism that landed him
on "The Oprah Winfrey Show." At age 21, People magazine named Seo one
of the "50 Most Beautiful People in the World."</TE>
<TE>   During time off from a day job writing for Vegetarian Times, Seo
wrote two additional books, including "Be the Difference" (New
Society Pub, 2001) with would-be business partner Deepak Chopra.
(Their plans for a "personal growth" Web site crumbled with the
dot-com downfall.)</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Renovated parents' home</TE>
<TE>   But the real catalyst for his West Coast debut was his renovation
of the Reading, Pa., home of his anesthesiologist father and
stay-at-home mother, using organic and recycled materials. Based on
that experience, he wrote "Conscious Style Home: Eco-Friendly Living
for the 21st Century" (St. Martin's, 2001). The book made the rounds
in Hollywood when Kevin Spacey's publicist sent it to all her clients
for Christmas.</TE>
<TE>   Today, Seo earns $15,000 per appearance on the lecture circuit. He
also appears in South Korean TV ads as an official spokesman for
Samsung, a deal he justifies with: "It allowed me to make a sizable
donation to a campaign in South Korea to ban dog meat."</TE>
<TE>   Now, Seo is carefully planning his transformation from activist
author to eco-stylist to the stars. He's interviewing talent agencies
here, and seriously considering signing with Cloutier, which reps
celebrity stylist Phillip Bloch. He's also in negotiations with
Hearst Entertainment, which is part owner of the A&amp;E and Lifetime
Television cable channels. When the ink dries, he'll develop a "
'Mister Rogers' for grown-ups" that targets the active and under-30
demographic. His ideal audience, he says, spends Friday nights out
and Saturday mornings on its couches, watching Seo's friendly face,
chatting brightly about a "Tajmopolitan," a cocktail made with spices
and vodka distilled from organic potatoes. Or perhaps he'll offer a
lesson on how to transform an empty Altoids tin into "an aromatherapy
energy candle perfect for traveling."</TE>
<TE>   To ensure that he meets the right types of people, Seo has spent a
third of the last year living in the W Hotel in Westwood, courting
publicists, dressing celebrities for public appearances and calling
up old friends like Amy Smart and Santa Monica local Tracey Ullman.
He's also on the lookout for celebrities to profile in Organic Style.
The year-old New York magazine hired him recently as an editor at
large to "add glitz" to its pages, he says. One such feature details
model Shalom Harlow's use of loose pebbles on her bathroom floor "as
an homage to reflexology," Seo says.</TE>
<TE>   "He really exemplifies the new definition of organic," Editor in
Chief Peggy Northrop says, "that it's about being seductive and
incorporating organics into your life in a stylish way .... He lives
that life."</TE>
<TE>   Seo started styling clients last year when the magazine's founder,
Maria Rodale, asked him to find an environmentally aware celebrity
for the September 2001 debut issue. He called friend Debbie Levin,
executive director of the Environmental Media Assn., who referred him
to Smart. Two months later, Smart asked him to dress her for the
association's gala in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "At first, I thought it was a joke.... It's glorified shopping,"
Seo says. "All I do is say, 'Try this on. It looks great!' "</TE>
<TE>   Smart introduced him to her friend actress Ali Larter. During
Thanksgiving week, Seo was busy searching Manhattan for "nonconflict"
diamonds -- stones that have not been mined to fund wars -- to drape
on her for a party.</TE>
<TE>   Other celebrities came to know Seo through their managers,
publicists or chance encounters at charity events. Eventually, he was
dressing and consulting with actress Rashida Jones (daughter of
Quincy), as well as Alicia Silverstone and the Backstreet Boys' Kevin
Richardson. At a recent Chicago charity dinner hosted by Richardson,
Seo persuaded the performer to serve all-organic wine and "make an
issue out of it."</TE>
<TE>   Here in L.A., Seo has been reconsidering the ubiquitous gift bag.
"It's counterproductive," he says. A charity event is "all about
selflessness, and people are complaining about not getting a bag." He
hopes someday to encourage a few celebrity friends to "save
everything they get for free for a year, and then I want to do a
Hollywood yard sale," he says. "I've just been thinking about this
for a week."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   'Very cool'</TE>
<TE>   Back at the Environmental Media Assn. awards, indie filmmaker
Asher Levin walks in with a small entourage of willowy young women.
The bushy-haired blond carries himself with the immodesty of a
22-year-old singer in a rock band -- which he is, for Whitestarr.</TE>
<TE>   "Look!" says Seo, "he's wearing one of my jackets!"</TE>
<TE>   "Does it look OK?" asks Levin, touching the deconstructed piece.</TE>
<TE>   "Very cool," nods Seo, looking it over. "Very cool."</TE>
<TE>   Levin, whose mother is the environmental group's executive
director, seems relieved. Later, he explains his affinity for Seo's
taste: "It's really cool."</TE>
<TE>   And for the lifestyle guru of the moment, maybe that's enough.</TE>

<LD>The planned 125-seat second theater at the Geffen Playhouse will be
named the Audrey Skirball-Kenis Theater in honor of a $5-million
grant from the Skirball Foundation, Geffen producing director Gilbert
Cates announced Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Skirball-Kenis, a philanthropist who died in June, "loved the idea
of developing a theater for developing theater," said her husband,
Charles Kenis, referring to the Geffen's plans to use the small
theater as a developmental laboratory.</LD>
<LD>   The grant is part of a $15-million Geffen Playhouse capital
campaign for the second theater and an endowment. The campaign was
launched last spring with the announcement of a $5-million gift by
the playhouse's naming donor, David Geffen.</LD>

<LD>Continuing ABC News' string of high-rated celebrity interviews,
Whitney Houston's appearance on a special "Primetime" drew an
estimated 21.3 million viewers Wednesday -- the biggest audience for
a prime-time newsmagazine since Connie Chung grilled embattled
congressman Gary Condit on the same program more than a year ago.</LD>
<LD>   Tune-in for the interview, in which Diane Sawyer spoke to the
singer about erratic behavior and drug use, eclipsed ratings for
recent discussions with the Osbournes and Jennifer Lopez, which both
drew roughly 15 million viewers -- albeit against original episodes
of "Law &amp; Order" -- during November. ABC also beat the combined
rating for a "West Wing" rerun and "The Amazing Race" in that hour.</LD>
<LD>   Among the young-adult viewers advertisers crave, it was the most
watched newsmagazine program since Monica Lewinsky spoke to Barbara
Walters in 1999, according to Nielsen Media Research data.</LD>

<LD>El Portal Theatre in North Hollywood will become the home of
Playhouse Pictures Studios, a company that plans to produce scripts
as plays on the 360-seat El Portal main stage and then develop them
into modestly budgeted feature films, company officials have
announced.</LD>
<LD>   The company will be run by a trio consisting of former Pasadena
Playhouse owner David Houk, former Landmark Entertainment chief
financial officer Ronny Angel and agent and entertainment attorney
Lee Muhl. Visionbox Pictures, led by former Samuel Goldwyn Films
executive John Bard Manulis, will become a partner in the films.</LD>
<LD>   The group's plan is for the stage productions to be open only to
"subscriber/investors," who will receive four tickets each to five El
Portal premieres -- four plays and one musical -- each year. They'll
also receive profit participation in the properties if they go to
other theaters, on tour or become films.</LD>
<TE>   State approval of the subscriber/investor plan is still pending.</TE>
<TE>   The Playhouse Pictures lease on El Portal will begin Jan. 1. The
first production is not planned until next summer.</TE>

co-presentation, not a presentation," said Luckman executive director
Cliff Harper. That is, the ballet wasn't renting the Luckman; the
venue and the company were sharing the risk and investment of putting
on the show. "During the negotiations," Harper said, "an appropriate
marketing plan was not mutually agreed upon."</LD>
<LD>   The familiar production will be presented Thursday to Dec. 15 at
the California Center for the Arts in Escondido.</LD>

<HD>Unearthing a one-night-only classic</HD>
<DH>Long thought lost, the score to a controversial 1940 blues
opera that was performed just once is rediscovered and given glorious
new voice.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Howard Reich</AU>
<BD>Chicago Tribune</BD>
<DL>DETROIT</DL>
<LD>More than 60 years ago, two pivotal figures of the Harlem Renaissance
-- poet Langston Hughes and jazz composer James P. Johnson --
collaborated on a blues opera that received one performance in
Carnegie Hall, then vanished.</LD>
<LD>   Since that premiere, on May 31, 1940, scholars have assumed that
although Hughes' text to "De Organizer" survived, Johnson's score was
irretrievably lost.</LD>
<LD>   That assumption was shattered Tuesday night, when eight vocal
soloists, a 45-piece orchestra and a 40-voice choir performed a
groundbreaking reconstruction of "De Organizer" in this city's
Orchestra Hall. The work proved so powerful in its melodic content
and so poetic in its choral writing that it's easy to imagine that it
might have attained broad popularity had it survived beyond its
one-night-only engagement.</LD>
<TE>   An overflow crowd turned out for the reemergence of "De
Organizer," not surprising considering the stature of its creators.</TE>
<TE>   Although not as famous today as he should be, Johnson stands as
one of the most influential jazz pianists of the 1920s and '30s, his
lightning-quick "stride" piano style inspiring Fats Waller and
generations to come. But Johnson was more than just a keyboard wizard
who penned such three-minute classics as "Harlem Strut" and
"Steeplechase Rag." He also blossomed as a composer of large works,
his rhapsody "Yamekraw" (1927) and "Harlem Symphony" (1932) reminding
listeners that black jazz and blues could be applied eloquently to
vast forms once reserved for classical music.</TE>
<TE>   In Hughes, Johnson found a collaborator of comparable genius whose
lyric poems, such as "The Negro Speaks of Rivers" (1921) and "The
Weary Blues" (1926), tapped the mysticism, tragedy and hope of black
life in America.</TE>
<TE>   What little background information on "De Organizer" survives
suggests that Hughes and Johnson were proud of the work and
championed it after the Carnegie Hall performance, which had been
organized by the International Ladies Garment Workers Union.</TE>
<TE>   "Both Hughes and Johnson tried to have the piece performed,"
University of Michigan music professor James Dapogny -- who unearthed
the vocal score for the 35-minute work in 1997 -- told the Detroit
crowd in his introductory remarks. "But they were told by CBS Radio,
for example, that this was just too controversial a piece."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, as its title suggests, "De Organizer" addresses the
American labor movement in heroic terms, often equating it with black
liberation.</TE>
<TE>   At one point, the choir thunders: "If you want to be free,
organize." At another, the title character snarls that when "we got a
big strong union, folks, a union of black and white, there'll be more
difference in this old South than there is 'twixt day and night."</TE>
<TE>   In 1940, these themes of racial oppression and labor exploitation
-- built into a simple story about a union man organizing
sharecroppers -- were deemed too hot to handle by mainstream concert
presenters, and "De Organizer" disappeared.</TE>
<TE>   Had it not been for Dapogny, an esteemed jazz musicologist who has
published an indispensable volume of Jelly Roll Morton's "Collected
Piano Music," "De Organizer" still would be silent, its text
preserved in Hughes anthologies but never brought to life on stage.
Dapogny found the music almost by serendipity, having noticed the
51-page vocal score among papers donated by choral director Eva
Jessye to the University of Michigan, where Dapogny has taught since
1966.</TE>
<TE>   Jessye had rehearsed the chorus for George Gershwin's "Porgy and
Bess" and Johnson's "De Organizer," but her working score contained
only the vocal lines, not the instrumental support that goes with it.</TE>
<TE>   Using Jessye's score as his starting point, Dapogny launched a
hunt for every scrap of paper related to "De Organizer," eventually
locating piano-vocal sketches and Johnson's instructions on
instrumentation among the composer's papers.</TE>
<TE>   Armed with all of this material, Dapogny began his attempt at
reconstructing the score, deciding that the project was feasible
because the most important portions of the music -- the vocal solo
and choral passages -- had survived. They were the heart and soul of
the piece, and Dapogny needed only to provide the instrumental
support.</TE>
<TE>   "If the vocal score indicated that one song was followed by six
bars of instrumental music linking to the next song, I would write
those six bars," said Dapogny in an interview last week.</TE>
<TE>   "I had to write in Johnson's style. But because you already know
the material in the two songs that you're linking, it's not
necessarily so difficult to determine the melodic themes that Johnson
might have used to make the transition."</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, in a score stretching 1,004 measures, only 80 measures
of instrumental music were missing. The concert performance affirmed
that Dapogny's handiwork blended seamlessly with Johnson's. Like any
top-notch restorer of musical theater, Dapogny subsumed his own voice
to the style of the composer at hand, ensuring that one piece flowed
elegantly into the next.</TE>
<TE>   Although Johnson and Hughes subtitled their work "a blues opera,"
in fact the piece also embraces jazz, swing and Broadway idioms,
switching easily among these styles. Listen to the resuscitated "De
Organizer," and it's not difficult to detect the influence of
Gershwin's "Porgy and Bess" and "Blue Monday," Jerome Kern's "Show
Boat," Eubie Blake's "Shuffle Along" and, possibly, Scott Joplin's
"Treemonisha."</TE>
<TE>   Any one of these tunes surely held the potential to become a hit.
Together, they represent a work of sustained melodic inspiration
that, on further hearing, may persuade some listeners to reassess
Johnson's position in the jazz pantheon. This first performance of
Dapogny's restoration -- by the University of Michigan's Symphony
Orchestra and Chorus -- had its ups and downs. Most distracting was
the tendency of the orchestral forces to obscure the vocal soloists,
while listeners surely would have benefited from a program that
included all of the lyrics and song titles.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, "De Organizer" emerged as an instantly attractive
work steeped in the black vernacular of the first half of the 20th
century.</TE>
<TE>   It deserves to be heard across the country and to be documented on
a recording.</TE>
<TE>   "All I can say is that it's really nice music that people will be
interested in hearing," said Dapogny, whose assessment may be too
modest.</TE>
<TE>   "De Organizer" is so beautifully crafted by Johnson and so
adroitly restored by Dapogny that it may yet earn a place among key
dramatic works in the jazz-blues repertory.</TE>
<TE>   At least it should.</TE>

<LD>An outrageous opera based on Jerry Springer's syndicated talk show is
to have its world premiere at Britain's National Theater.</LD>
<LD>   "It is exactly the kind of work the National should be doing:
bold, scabrous, funny and beautiful," said the National Theater's new
director, Nicholas Hytner.</LD>
<LD>   In concert form, "Jerry Springer: The Opera," by composer Richard
Thomas and comic writer Stewart Lee, was one of the biggest hits at

<LD>Despite a few rough edges, "Dick and Don's Fabulous 60's Rock &amp; Soul
Spectacular!" at the American Renegade Theatre is a high-voltage
entertainment that carries a hefty charge of pure pizazz.</LD>
<LD>   The pretext for the show is slim but functional. As 1969 ends,
good-natured rivals Dick Clark (Mike Dolan) and Don Cornelius (John
Moody) get together to host a musical retrospective of the previous
decade. Hipster DJ Murray the K (Joe Komarinski) is also on hand to
help introduce the acts -- '60s icons spanning the spectrum from
Motown stars to vintage crooners to acid rockers.</LD>
<LD>   Celebrity impersonations range from dead-on to approximate. Terrah
Bennett Smith, the show's director, does double duty as Tina Turner,
romping through a scorching rendition of "Proud Mary" that almost
ignites her stiletto heels. As Dionne Warwick, the dulcet-voiced
Marla Douglas does a lovely job with the wistful "Message to
Michael." Perhaps the strongest singer of the evening, Alicia Cox
brings down the house belting Dusty Springfield's "You Don't Have to
Say You Love Me," a '60s hit that redefined the notion of the torch
song. Other "guests" include Elvis (Kevin Wixted), Fontella Bass
(Nikea Gamby-Turner), Tom Jones (Rick Dano) and a comically
inarticulate James Brown (Eric Henderson).</LD>
<TE>   Early on in the show, Tony Novell sets the pace for the evening
with a supercharged version of Jackie Wilson's "Workout." La Trice
Harper is an amusingly diva-esque Diana Ross, while Komarinski and
Christina Wickers are perfectly paired as Sonny and Cher. Rounding
things out with a flourish, Jerry Giles performs Neil Diamond's
"Brother Love's Traveling Salvation Show," a rousing number that
leads into an ensemble finale from "Hair." Some annoying faked guitar
playing aside, the rich blend of synthetic, live and taped music is
ably presided over by Dion Smith, the show's sound designer and
primary musician. An ebullient presence throughout, Smith is an able
craftsman whose contribution is essential.</TE>

<TE>   A turkey with tasty trimmings</TE>
<TE>   "Becoming Eleanor," at the Long Beach Playhouse's Studio Theatre,
is billed as a "comedy-drama." The question is, how did playwright
Marsha Lee Sheiness interject comedic elements into a historical
drama about the life and times of Eleanor of Aquitaine? The answer
is, she didn't. The "comedy," such as it is, has been laboriously
layered onto the play by director Diane Benedict, whose antic staging
of Sheiness' dry lecture is an unfortunate hybrid that bears little
interest. About the best that can be said for this West Coast
premiere is that it features a wonderful set by Vincent Roca,
evocative lighting by Dan Weingarten and beautiful costumes by Donna
Fritsche -- elegant period gowns that drape just so. Apart from those
consummately professional elements, the play is a misfire from the
start.</TE>
<TE>   Eleanor of Aquitaine, she of "A Lion in Winter" fame, was born in
1122 and lived to the ripe old age of 82. Initially married to Louis
Capet VII, king of France, Eleanor later divorced her royal husband
and married Henry Plantagenet, soon to rule England. Certainly,
Eleanor was a vibrant figure, but this woefully expositional
recapitulation, set primarily during Eleanor's reign as queen of
France, reduces Eleanor and her contemporaries to dull caricatures.
Eleanor (Jenn Robbins), an educated and independent young woman, weds
Louis (Laurent Monteskior) -- a desirable union on the face of it.
However, Eleanor is hot to trot, if not gallop, and Louis, a
repressed religious fanatic, would rather pray than play.</TE>
<TE>   That, apart from Eleanor and Louis' crusade to the Holy Land and a
few clashes with the pope (Roberto Branco, doing a Don Corleone
impersonation that is particularly meretricious), is about the extent
of the plot. A game Robbins strives to inject life into lines like
"My parents educate my sister Petronilla and I far beyond the norm
for the lesser sex." Unfortunately, she is undone by the phony French
accent that Benedict has imposed upon the majority of the performers,
who wind up sounding like Maurice Chevalier as channeled by Monty
Python. Eleanor finally achieves connubial bliss with the virile
Henry (Kent M. Lewis) -- a coupling underscored (and undermined) by
Ann Reid's cheesy original music. As for the audience, satisfaction
is more elusive.</TE>

<TE>   Look who's acting up now</TE>
<TE>   If the characters in "Waiting for Guffman" -- small-town would-be
actors -- ever make it to Hollywood, they would be prime candidates
for Beverly Winwood's acting classes.</TE>
<TE>   She's the fictional impresario who's the host of the rollicking
"Beverly Winwood Presents the Actors Showcase," which has moved from
its original home at the Groundlings Theatre to expanded quarters at
the Canon Theatre on Monday evenings.</TE>
<TE>   A broad lampoon of atrocious acting, conceived and directed by
Tony Sepulveda, "Beverly Winwood" is a series of scenes from famous
scripts, enacted by thespians who appear unaware of how pathetically
inappropriate they are for these roles.</TE>
<TE>   The program has changed since the move, and one of the new scenes
is one of the best. It's from the Captain (Tim Bagley), a retired
shoe salesman from Ohio who moved to La Habra to pursue his Hollywood
dreams. He appeared in the previous version of the show but not by
himself, as he is here.</TE>
<TE>   The Captain performs an excerpt from an anthology called "Scenes
for Student Actors," which he apparently believes is an actual play
title. In fact, his excerpt is the ending of "The Glass Menagerie."
He recites it from his wheelchair, gamely attempting to add a little
atmosphere by lighting candles, never shedding his sea captain's hat.</TE>
<TE>   The laughter he evokes is irrepressible. But the Captain is so
deluded that a twinge of guilt over that laughter also arises -- an
emotion that deepens the experience beyond the easy gag.</TE>
<TE>   Also new at the Canon: Lorelie Bailey (Cheryl Hines, though Wendi
McLendon-Covey filled in last Monday) and her baby's painfully shy
nanny (Mary Jo Smith). Lorelie, a blond society dame, has drafted her
equally white nanny as her partner in a scene from "The Color
Purple," in which they play two black women. And Mindy Sterling and
Michael Hitchcock show up as the red-sequined Sanchez siblings, doing
a "Hair" medley.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the biggest laughs of the evening belong to Jennifer
Coolidge, continuing her role as the toughest Laura (also from "The
Glass Menagerie") ever.</TE>
<TE>   Arrive early enough to thoroughly relish the promotional photos
and hilarious resumes of the characters that are distributed at the
door.</TE>

<HD>He used trust and a keen eye</HD>
<DH>Murray Garrett helped change the nature of Hollywood
photography with his seemingly off-the-cuff portraits of the stars at
work and play.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Susan King</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The key to Murray Garrett's success as a Hollywood photographer was
trust. Stars, producers, directors and agents knew that Garrett would
always keep his promises, and that opened many doors for the
photographer during the '40s, '50s, '60s and early '70s.</LD>
<LD>   In addition to working as a photojournalist, Garrett, now 76, was
also a commercial photographer shooting stars' weddings, galas and
birthday parties for actors' children. Garrett recalls being asked by
Elizabeth Taylor's agent, for example, to accompany the actress and
her then-husband, Richard Burton, and their children to Disneyland.
"The only deal was that they wanted pictures for their family. They
said, 'You have a choice: We can pay you or you can keep the pictures
for publication.' I had been around long enough to know this is a
home run with the bases loaded."</LD>
<LD>   Two years ago, the Hollywood Entertainment Museum exhibited
photographs from Garrett's first book, "Hollywood Candid." On
Thursday, the museum began exhibiting 40 more of Garrett's
"fly-on-the-wall" pictures of the likes of Lucille Ball, Bing Crosby,
Bob Hope, Ava Gardner and Frank Sinatra in conjunction with the
publication of Garrett's latest book, "Hollywood Moments."</LD>
<TE>   "The interesting thing about Murray's photos is that he really
represents change in terms of Hollywood star publicity," says
Jan-Christopher Horak, curator of the museum. "In the '30s and '40s,
you had people like George Hurrell and other photographers creating
star portraits that were very mannered and used light to really
construct the image. By the 1950s, that really falls out of fashion.
In its stead is a more 'natural' look. It is more casual; in a sense
they are photographed seemingly off the cuff in natural environments
and events."</TE>
<TE>   Garrett, he says, was one of the first paparazzi. "He had the
Hollywood beat, and for a decade or more he was photographing all
sorts of things. Even when he did portraits, they were portraits in
the home or office. They were more action-type portraits than facing
the camera and using a lot of light in a studio setting."</TE>
<TE>   When Garrett starting shooting photographs of celebrities in the
early '40s as a teenager, "my grand plan was to have a cover of
Life." He was just 17 when he first photographed Frank Sinatra in his
dressing room at the Paramount Theater in New York City.</TE>
<TE>   "He had just started his own new career leaving behind the band
business," Garrett recalls. "I was really curious to see what this
guy looked like, because he was becoming so famous. He was very nice.
He said to me, 'Will you send me an 8-by-10 of this photograph?' I
said, 'Yes, sir.' The next day I fought through the police lines to
get backstage to leave a package [with the photographs] with 'Mr.
Sinatra' on the envelope.</TE>
<TE>   "You never know how that is going to work out, but he retained us
to do Nancy's wedding years later. I would do some of his shows and
his personal stuff. He retained me to do a surprise party for Natalie
Wood when she was 21. He took over Romanoff's. When you have that
sponsorship, you can do anything."</TE>
<TE>   One of his biggest assignments as a young photographer was
shooting Bob Hope for four days for the New York Daily News. "I had
to catch him during his radio show or camp shows," Garrett says. "I
was so young, I didn't know who the people were I was shooting. They
were very big names. They had lunch with Hope's press agent at NBC,
and he gave me a funny look with a smile and said, 'Bob wanted me to
ask you a question. What do you do on Tuesdays? How would you like to
work for him every Tuesday? He loves these pictures so much he would
love for you to cover all of his shows.' This is at 22. I did that
from 1948 until 1973."</TE>
<TE>   Though he recounts in his book the problems he had with Milton
Berle ("a dreadful man"), Danny Kaye and Desi Arnaz, Garrett says,
"retrospectively I liked most of the actors. I admit I was a fan."</TE>

<HD>An 'Adaptation' like no other</HD>
<DH>A screenwriter's travails result in an imaginative romp
from the 'Being John Malkovich' team.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Kenneth Turan</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's typical of the nerve, the bravado, the sheer giddy playfulness
and sense of fun that characterize what has to be the boldest and
most imaginative studio film of the year that "Adaptation," written
by Charlie Kaufman, starts with a character plaintively asking, "Do I
have an original thought in my head?"</LD>
<LD>   It's not just any character who's worried, it's a woefully
insecure writer named Charlie Kaufman who is agonizing over turning
Susan Orlean's bestselling "The Orchid Thief" into a film. Which is
exactly the problem the real-life Kaufman faced after he and his
directing partner, Spike Jonze, took on the Orlean book after
triumphing with the boundary-expanding "Being John Malkovich."</LD>
<TE>   Wait, there's more. In writing "Adaptation," Kaufman has given
himself an imaginary identical twin brother named Donald (a hangdog
Nicolas Cage plays them both), who actually gets screen credit.
Kaufman has taken real people like his agent, the studio executive
who hired him, author Orlean (Meryl Streep) and her subject John
Laroche (Chris Cooper in a career-changing performance), even
screenwriting guru Robert McKee (Brian Cox) and turned them into
half-fictional creatures of his imagination. And he's written a
script about how he couldn't write a script that is not only
dazzlingly funny but also a wonderful essay on the creative process,
on why and how writers write and the outlandish places where passion
and inspiration make their home.</TE>
<TE>   Even more impressive is how intrinsically cinematic "Adaptation's"
through-the-looking-glass narrative style is. The multiple ways the
film self-referentially doubles back on itself are difficult to
describe on the page but immediately accessible and easy to enjoy on
screen. Kaufman and director Jonze, in effect the writer's psychic
twin, count on our movie-savvy minds to understand cinema's potential
for subterfuge and effortlessly make the illusion/reality/illusion
leaps that are the heart of the film's appeal.</TE>
<TE>   In a typical bit of business, the film's title turns out to have
two parallel meanings. While in Hollywood adaptation is the process
of turning a book into a film, in the plant world it refers to what
"Orchid Thief" protagonist Laroche calls "a profound process" whereby
mutable orchids "figure out how to thrive in the world."</TE>
<TE>   Thriving in the world is one scenario screenwriter Kaufman has
never mastered. As played by Cage (always at his best -- witness
"Valley Girl" -- as some kind of goofball), the woebegone Kaufman
starts the film with a stream-of-consciousness monologue that is
self-flagellation raised to an art form. Awash in insecurity and
self-doubt, ill at ease even on the "Being John Malkovich" set (a
seemingly cinema verite sequence that is actually scripted), Kaufman
is virtually scared of his own shadow. Though the writer has an
active (and very funny) fantasy life, real-world connections with
women are always elusive.</TE>
<TE>   Kaufman is also, no surprise, worried about doing justice to "The
Orchid Thief" in his adaptation. "I just don't want to ruin it by
making it a Hollywood thing," he tells studio executive Valerie
(Tilda Swinton). "I don't want to cram in sex or guns or car chases.
You know? Or characters learning profound life lessons.... I mean,
the book isn't like that, and life isn't like that. It just isn't."</TE>
<TE>   Things get, if possible, worse for Charlie when he goes home to
talk to his twin, Donald, a cheerful, optimistic, not very bright guy
who calls Charlie "bro" and is his opposite in all ways, including
his ease with women. ("Secretary's" Maggie Gyllenhaal has a deft
cameo as his girlfriend.)</TE>
<TE>   Not only is Donald freeloading in Charlie's house, he's decided to
become a screenwriter of the most cravenly commercial sort. He has an
idea for a multiple-personality serial killer film, and he wants to
borrow money from Charlie to take a three-day seminar from McKee in
order to maximize his gift.</TE>
<TE>   Entertaining as this is, watching Charlie being overwhelmed by his
problems with the script, his brother and his romantic life is only
half the film. Alternating with it are scenes from an actual
adaptation of "The Orchid Thief," an involving scenario that, among
other things, illustrates why the real Kaufman was interested in the
project in the first place.</TE>
<TE>   In this part of the film we watch New Yorker writer Orlean (a
deliciously amusing Streep in the rare part that makes use of her
sense of humor) becoming intrigued by Laroche after reading about him
being arrested for poaching a rare ghost orchid in the Fakahatchee
Strand Preserve State Park in the Florida Everglades.</TE>
<TE>   Chris Cooper, best known for playing buttoned-up individuals in
films like "Lone Star," "American Beauty," "October Sky" and "The
Bourne Identity," makes the most of his opportunity to let it rip
with Laroche, whose lack of front teeth only enhances his charisma.</TE>
<TE>   A fast-talking autodidact who throws himself into his interests
with a wild enthusiasm that rubs up against madness, Laroche
fascinates Orlean because his life is so diametrically opposite from
her experience in the enervated Manhattan literary world she inhabits
with her husband (an amusing cameo by director Curtis Hanson). "I
wanted," she comes to feel, "to want something as much as people
wanted these plants."</TE>
<TE>   What the film's Kaufman wants is to make this story fit into a
screenplay. At a certain point, aided and abetted by his brother and
McKee, he ends up doing all kinds of things to the narrative that
allow "Adaptation," as if it weren't doing enough already, to
devastatingly spoof all the debilitating conventions that
characterize the Hollywood system.</TE>
<TE>   Novelists putting themselves into novels a la Philip Roth is not
new, and the idea of a film about a screenwriter making things up as
he goes along is not unprecedented either. "Paris When It Sizzles,"
written by George Axelrod and starring William Holden and Audrey
Hepburn, did it in 1963,1964, and that was based on an even earlier
French film.</TE>
<TE>   None of that takes away from the liberating feeling of madcap
originality that is "Adaptation's" strength. Though Kaufman's script
gently mocks the notion that writing should have something different
as its goal, that is what's been accomplished here.</TE>
<TE>   There may be, as Orlean's book informs us, 30,000 varieties of
orchids in the world, but in the universe of film there's never been
an adaptation quite like the one we have here.</TE>

<HD>Sound problems spoil 'Pianist' premiere screening</HD>
<DH>North American gala opener for Polanski's drama is marred
by a sound system failure at Loews theater.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Robert W. Welkos</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A glittering night for Hollywood and the elite of Los Angeles' Jewish
cultural community came to an abrupt halt Wednesday evening when the
North American premiere screening of Roman Polanski's Holocaust drama
"The Pianist" had to be canceled because of technical problems with
the theater sound system at Loews Cineplex Century City.</LD>
<LD>   The cancellation proved an embarrassment for Focus Features, the
tony new art house label of Universal Pictures, which had invited
hundreds of guests to attend the screening as a benefit for the Los
Angeles Jewish Symphony and the National Foundation for Jewish
Culture.</LD>
<LD>   About 650 moviegoers who gathered in the main theater did not get
to see the film, although another 150 guests seated in a nearby
theater did watch the movie as the sound system in there worked
perfectly.</LD>
<TE>   Afterward, all the guests gathered at the Century Plaza Hotel
across the street to hear a free performance by the symphony of a
work called Piano Concertino by Wladyslaw Szpilman, who was the
subject of the movie and who wrote the book on which Polanski adapted
the film. "The Pianist" this year won the Palme d'Or, the top prize
at the Cannes Film Festival.</TE>
<TE>   Thursday, the studio and the charities scrambled to contact each
guest who did not see the film and invite them to attend private
screenings before the film's Dec. 27 U.S. release.</TE>
<TE>   "We are grateful that Loews has proffered a substantive and
genuine apology and is working closely with Focus Features to make
sure that everyone who attended [Wednesday] night's event will be
able to see the film in the best possible circumstances," David
Linde, the co-president of Focus Features, said in a prepared
statement. Loews officials were unavailable for comment.</TE>
<TE>   The gala evening got off in typical Hollywood fashion as a gaggle
of celebrities such as Jack Nicholson, Lara Flynn Boyle, Fran
Drescher, Martin Landau, and the movie's Adrien Brody and Thomas
Kretschmann turned out for the event. But inside the theater, things
went haywire.</TE>
<TE>   After it took nearly an hour for guests to take their seats,
representatives of the studio, the symphony and the foundation walked
to the microphone only to find that their speeches were garbled by a
faulty sound system. One of those addressing the audience was Andre
Szpilman, the son of Wladyslaw Szpilman.</TE>
<TE>   By 8:15, a studio official announced that the film would not be
shown that night but everyone was invited to the reception and
concert.</TE>
<TE>   Wayne Hinton, executive director of the Los Angeles Jewish
Symphony, said this was his group's first film premiere and they
wanted it to be a memorable event.</TE>
<TE>   '"I really feel badly for Andre Szpilman," Hinton said. "I know
how much he was looking forward to the premiere." Hinton said that
anyone who left without seeing the movie will be offered
complimentary tickets to the symphony's season opening concert Sunday
at 7 p.m. at Valley Beth Shalom on Ventura Boulevard in Encino.</TE>

<HD>The kinetic Keaton returns</HD>
<DH>Off doing his own thing for a while, the news junkie is
happy to be playing a journalist in a timely story that showcases his
comedy and drama chops.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Susan King</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Michael Keaton comes bounding into his office in Santa Monica with
the same frenetic energy and intensity that he has brought to his
movie roles for the last 20 years. "I've got to roll," he tells
everyone as he briskly walks into his personal office and starts
opening the mail piled up on his desk.</LD>
<LD>   "You can start any time you want," Keaton tells a reporter as he
opens an envelope containing a script.</LD>
<LD>   The 51-year-old actor, who was the best of the three "Batmans" and
who has enthralled critics and audiences alike with his ability to
effortlessly move from comedic roles in such films as "Night Shift"
to dramatic turns in "Clean and Sober" and "Pacific Heights," has
been off the radar for a while.</LD>
<TE>   But now he's back in a new HBO movie, "Live From Baghdad,"
premiering Saturday on the cable outlet. The film is based on the
memoir of the same name by Robert Wiener, a former CNN senior
executive producer, and revolves around the cable news network
reporters who attempted to broadcast live from behind enemy lines
during the Persian Gulf War in 1991. Keaton plays the kinetic Wiener
in the drama, which also stars Helena Bonham Carter and David Suchet.</TE>
<TE>   Director Mick Jackson thought Keaton was a wonderful choice to
play Wiener because the role gives the actor the opportunity to be
both comedic and dramatic, energetic and compassionate.</TE>
<TE>   "It showcases all of his strengths as an actor," Jackson says. "He
is a movie star. Movie stars are movie stars, and they are a special
kind of human being. What I loved about Michael is he dedicated all
the intensity and passion to the role. The thing I admired and found
most useful was his physical energy. Sometimes, he looks like a
hyperkinetic kid. And the comedy timing was great. It was a great
resource to draw on."</TE>
<TE>   Keaton, who is friendly and chatty in an intense,
stream-of-consciousness way, says there are several reasons why he
hasn't done a lot of projects in the last few years.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think with anything it is usually one thing," he
explains, staring at the ocean view from the window of his office.</TE>
<TE>   "I just made certain decisions that I only wanted to do something
I hadn't done before. I am not saying that is the end of that story,
because it isn't, because inevitably, you will do something you have
done before. Also, I didn't want to do what I didn't want to do
anymore. I wanted to like it. I wanted to enjoy it. I wanted to live
life. I wanted to do things I wanted to do. That said, had I been
offered something I had absolutely loved, and it was a really good
role, and I was up to work again ...."</TE>
<TE>   He also wanted to make sure his son, Sean, got into a good
college. "I didn't want to bail on him," Keaton says. "There was some
tough stuff in my family this year and I wanted to ride herd on that
and be attentive to that and do things I wanted to do -- you know, go
to Europe and build houses."</TE>
<TE>   "Live From Baghdad" was just the type of project to bring him back
to a film set. He had loved Wiener's book when he read it several
years ago.</TE>
<TE>   "I am a news junkie anyway," says Keaton, who also played a
journalist in Ron Howard's movie "The Paper." "I find [journalists]
endlessly interesting, and I thought this was so timely."</TE>
<TE>   Not only did Keaton talk with Wiener about his experiences, but
the two also have become friends.</TE>
<TE>   "He is a lot of things," Keaton says. "In his heart, he's a
pacifist. But he is also realistic."</TE>
<TE>   Wiener is also blessed with patience, something Keaton says he
himself lacks: "That is something I have to constantly remind myself
to continually get better at. Hopefully, I am."</TE>
<TE>   With "Live From Baghdad" under his belt, Keaton is eager to get
back to work. He's sold an idea to a film company and is weighing two

with age. "I am not sure why it is," he says. "The only reason I feel
any comfort is that two really good actors, Sean Penn and [Tom]

<HD>The poetry of all that is unknowable</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Al Martinez</AU>

<LD>She calls herself FrancEyE, writes poetry and lives alone in a small
apartment in Venice. Well, not totally alone, because there are
Charles Bukowski posters on the wall and enough memories of him to
fill anyone's room. Even in death, he's somehow as strong and present
today as he was back then, when he was drinking, brawling and whoring
his way up and down L.A.'s seedier streets.</LD>
<LD>   FrancEyE, whose last name is Smith, lived with Buk, as he called
himself, for almost three years, and bore his child, Marina. They
separated, she says, because "two crazy people just can't live
together." At 80, she doesn't seem crazy, sitting in a rocking chair
and peering out through oversized glasses, as pert and snappy as an
early spring. Well, yes, there are those fairly long chin hairs she's
let grow, but that's just her stamp of individuality, a declaration
of self. She's a poet, after all, and you know how they are.</LD>
<LD>   I came across her name in a Bukowski biography by Howard Sounes.
There aren't too many FrancEyEs in the world, and when you see the
name, it just kind of jumps out at you. I realized that someone named
FrancEyE had been sending me poetry over the years. I discovered it
was her, Buk's woman, which is why I went to see her.</LD>
<TE>   I'm a Bukowski fan, and was even before he died of leukemia in
1994. When I read of his death, I felt like throwing myself from a
high window or something. Not in grief, because he drank enough to
have died long before he did, but because I had always wanted to meet
the man and just never got around to it. My life is composed of
things I've intended to do but haven't, and people I've wanted to
meet but haven't. Damn me.</TE>
<TE>   Bukowski was a poet of the street and of the people who still
inhabit that world. He wrote poems so powerful, one admirer said,
that they constituted "the spoken voice nailed to paper." Some poets
whisper, but he roared and growled his verse, daring anyone who read
it not to remember its potency. It was filled with black-and-white
imagery and visions of sadness that seemed to regard the world not
with scorn but with the frustration of a man whose questions were
never answered.</TE>
<TE>   FrancEyE remembers him as a guy who could be, as she puts it, "a
decent citizen who dressed up to go to work at the post office every
day" when he was sober, but became a confrontational drunk on
weekends when he'd hit the booze. Then, she says, he got stupid and
verbally abusive, insulting even those he liked or admired and
sometimes getting into bar fights. "He used to say that he needed me
to explain things to him, about how to get along in life."</TE>
<TE>   She met Bukowski through an exchange of letters and began living
with him in 1963 in a place on Mariposa Street that someone said
smelled like cabbage and rats. "He wrote every day after dinner and
before going to work at night at the post office," she says,
remembering him. "He always wrote one poem. He had a huge head. I'd
look at him and wonder what it would be like to have so much in my
head."</TE>
<TE>   FrancEyE was drawn to Bukowski by his poetry. Her real name was
Frances, but she changed it when a friend said that Frances sounded
plural. She was writing her own verse, but didn't know whether she
was really a poet. "I didn't have a role model for my work," she
says. "Then I read Buk and he just put it out there." They stayed
together until their differences split them apart. "He wanted a happy
woman singing in the kitchen," she says. "That wasn't me." And yet
... and yet ....</TE>
<TE>   Afterward she wrote: " ... and all I want to do is kiss you and
stay with you forever. / Forget I have tiny pig eyes and like to go
to workshops / and never sweep the floor. / Forget you called me a
whore, / puked in the bushes, / always passed out and had to be
dragged to bed...."</TE>
<TE>   Bukowski used to say that his poetry came easy. "The wine does
most of my writing," he told an interviewer. "I just open a bottle
and turn on the radio, and it comes pouring out." But it's the place
it comes pouring from, words and imagery on fire, that makes the
difference. It's that place in the soul where life and talent merge
that produces greatness.</TE>
<TE>   Well, there. I never got to meet Bukowski or drink with him or
share stories and lies with him. But I got to meet someone who knew
him and loved him and could never really figure him out, even though
she slept with him and had his baby. I got around to meeting
FrancEyE, anyhow. That's something.</TE>

<HD>A vision in tiny pieces</HD>
<DH>Reinterpreting a traditional craft, a Tijuana artisan turns
everything from trees to dinnerware into vivid, sought-after mosaics.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Anne-Marie O'Connor</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Guadalupe Prieto, the flamboyant young chef of a trendy new Tijuana
restaurant, was trapped in bumper-to-bumper taxi traffic not long
ago, so she darted down a quiet, leafy side street. And suddenly she
saw it.</LD>
<LD>   An enormous mosaic of a tree of life reared up from the sidewalk,
its sinuous branches embracing a storefront. Prieto stopped her car
and stared in amazement.</LD>
<LD>   The life-size mosaic tree, with its warm green and orange tiles,
could have sprung from the imagination of Colombian novelist Gabriel
Garcia Marquez. It might have been a fragment of one of the surreal
Barcelona tile mosaics by the great Catalan modernist, Antoni Gaudi.
For Prieto, it was exactly the kind of arresting visual style she was
seeking for the interior of a nouvelle cuisine restaurant she was
about to open with her sister.</LD>
<TE>   "I knew I wanted this artist," Prieto said.</TE>
<TE>   The designer turned out to be Tijuana mosaic artist Aida Valencia.
She is the creative force behind Casa Valencia, one of a new wave of
Tijuana artisan workshops reinterpreting Mexico's traditional crafts
with a more contemporary visual language. Like a growing number of
the city's artisans, Valencia, 45, works both sides of the border,
tiling murals in kitchens, gardens and bars from San Diego to
Ensenada and filling commissions for clients as far north as L.A.</TE>
<TE>   One of Valencia's designs, a lapis lazuli-hued mosaic fireplace
laced with traces of gold, graces a house in tony Rancho Penasquitos
in San Diego County. Another, a garden installation in Solano Beach,
is a ceramic mural of a soaring sun and sky that spills from a
burbling fountain to the patio floor and onto the wooden garden door.
A swirling pattern of swordfish, starfish and seahorses is being
painstakingly pieced together in the Casa Valencia workshop for a
client's wet bar in Rosarito. The design is emerging in the vibrant
aquas and subtle pastels of the sea, with clam shells in shades of
sand and salmon and sinuous sea grasses in wet-hued greens.</TE>
<TE>   Valencia has often been compared to Gaudi, even before she was
familiar with his famous outdoor mosaics in Barcelona. "A friend of
mine brought me a book of Gaudi's work from Barcelona, to show me,"
Valencia said. "He said I was copying everything. I began to buy
books myself, to open my mind to other people's artistic styles and
see the possibilities."</TE>
<TE>   One of Casa Valencia's most mind-blowing designs is a table
covered with what looks like the flattened remnants of a Victorian
tea party. The mosaic is "set" with old floral plates and teacups
provided by friends. To create the illusion, Valencia carefully cuts
away the porcelain backing of the plates, leaving a surface thin
enough to be laid, like flat tile, into an imaginary place setting.
Flat teacup silhouettes, decorated with roses and other flowery
motifs, are also cut out from recycled chinaware. Imaginary
silverware is created by cutting knives, forks and spoons from old
mirrors. A complete set includes painted vintage chairs reupholstered
with peacock blue velvet and ornamented with glass tile insets. The
result -- a visually hypnotic Mad Hatter's tea party with hints of
Julian Schnabel and Judy Chicago -- is something Casa Valencia can't
keep in stock.</TE>
<TE>   Valencia did her first tea-party table for a San Diego woman who
brought in the few plates that remained from a beloved antique family
set and asked if they could dream up a tabletop design incorporating
them. Valencia, a San Diego-born U.S. citizen who has lived in
Tijuana most of her life, began her business in 1996. In those days,
she was making decorative painted furniture, and she asked a Tijuana
construction worker to show her how to set tile. She experimented by
making several tile tabletops with designs copied from the art of
Miro. Soon, an old friend, Brenda Parra, offered to be her business
administrator and found she couldn't resist pitching in on mosaics.
Valencia and Parra became partners, and began getting commissions
from local tourist hotels and restaurants.</TE>
<TE>   "Aida is very creative, and I have a lot of faith in her big
ideas," Parra, 39, said. "I had money, and she didn't. But she had
tremendous creativity."</TE>
<TE>   Since Valencia is bilingual and bicultural, it was easy to expand
into a cross-border enterprise. She and Parra built a showroom in a
front wing of her parents' Tijuana home, and clients from California
began to stop in and order commissions. Soon, they were in demand on
both sides of the border.</TE>
<TE>   A visit to the Casa Valencia studio is a kaleidoscopic experience:
mosaics of suns and moons stretch across the walls, and visitors can
watch assistants piece together their commissions in the workroom in
back. Valencia's German shepherd, Mailo, suns himself in the
courtyard, and a playful German shepherd puppy, Dylan, follows
visitors around the showroom.</TE>
<TE>   Valencia has traveled to Ravenna, Italy, to learn classical mosaic
techniques. She has become an artful mimic of the floor mosaics of
ancient Rome and Greece, and enjoys borrowing from pop culture design
fads. And some of her designs are pure whim. The tree of life is a
traditional Mexican design for rustic terra cotta candelabras. To
give the mosaic tree its naturalistic feel, Valencia dug up an old
tree trunk and its roots from the yard and secured it to the
storefront, tiling over it. It took her four months to create the
tree, but it was worth it. The tree mosaic has become the studio's
calling card, pulling in a steady stream of visitors who happen upon
the showroom, just south of Tijuana's central Aguascalientes
Boulevard. The work Casa Valencia ended up creating for Prieto's
restaurant, the Casa Magnolia, is as lovely and unconventional as
Guadalupe Prieto herself. Using tiles, hammered metal and even beads,
the studio created a series of pillars throughout the restaurant that
could be read as tree trunks, tentacles, or vaguely erotic forms.
Tiles adorn the walls, the entrance, even a separate wooden side door
that is the exclusive Casa Magnolia entrance for small children. The
encrusted decorative columns are fittingly innovative for a
restaurant that is pioneering such platos nuevos as the Crepa
Moctezuma, a truly imperial repast consisting of a crepe stuffed with
sirloin tenders and smothered with Mexico's indigenous huitlacoche
sauce.</TE>
<TE>   "We wanted to create something that would make the restaurant
distinctive, intriguing," Valencia said. "How people see the pillars
depends on their sensibility. Everyone says the first one is like a
rumba or a samba, somebody dancing and inviting you to enter. The
pillar by the bar is shiny glass tile, festive, inviting you to get a
drink and have a good time."</TE>

<HD>'David Dreidel's Hanukkah Adventure'</HD>
<DH>The story so far: David Dreidel has been carried away to
the house of a poor little boy named Josh and his mother. He is
listening to the story about the miracle of the light. They don't
know he's there.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>E.G. Walker</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"In those days, the lamps burned oil. But the soldiers had desecrated
the holy oil -- that means they made it impure. They only had enough
pure oil to keep the lamp going for one night.</LD>
<LD>   "The Hebrews sent a messenger to get more, but it would take him
eight days to get back with the clean oil. That meant the everlasting
light would go out. But it never went out. That was a miracle. So
that's why we light candles for eight days."</LD>
<LD>   Josh asked, "Is that why they call it the festival of the lights?"
I really like this boy and his mother. I'm trying to roll near him so
I can attract his attention. How can I get him to look at me?</LD>
<TE>   The mom says, "It's getting pretty breezy. We'd better go inside."</TE>
<TE>   At that very moment, the breeze catches me again and I start
turning, all by myself. I roll right over to the steps.</TE>
<TE>   "Mama, look!" the boy cries, "a dreidel! It's like a Hanukkah
present!"</TE>
<TE>   The mom has tears in her eyes as she hugs Josh again and says,
"Maybe this is your Hanukkah miracle."</TE>
<TE>   I, David Dreidel, am resting on my gimel side!</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Author's note: A dreidel is a top used in a Hanukkah game. Each
side has a different Hebrew letter. Together, the letters stand for a
Hebrew phrase, Nes gadol hayah sham: "A great miracle happened
there."</TE>

<LD>Meet the kids from U.N.C.L.E. (Utterly Nutty Cartoon Lampooning
Elders).</LD>
<LD>   That's how you might describe the latest original series on
Cartoon Network, "Codename: Kids Next Door," premiering tonight at 7.
For in this animated cross between "Our Gang" and spy thrillers, the
adults are the enemy. As the show's tagline says, in a parody of
"Ocean's Eleven": "Either you're in or you're old."</LD>
<LD>   Rather than knocking off casinos, these 10-year-olds put a hit on
the local soft-serve ice-cream factory. Instead of facing Dr. No,
they unite against such villains as Gramma Stuffum, who wants to
fatten up the young'uns with liverwurst-headcheese casserole, and
Count Spankula, a vampire-like creature that punishes them for
overdue library books. And then there are those insidiously
strait-laced Delightful Children From Down the Lane.</LD>
<TE>   The "KND" brat pack is led by the British-accented Numbah One,
a.k.a. Nigel Uno, who fearlessly faces such trials as going to an
amusement park with his mum. The other members are Numbah Two, Hoagie
P. Gilligan Jr., an American nerd with a knack for engineering;
Numbah Three, Kuki Sanban, an Asian girl short on attention span but
long on charm; Numbah Four, Wallabee Beatles, an Aussie suffering
from short-man's syndrome; and Numbah Five, Abigail "Abby" Lincoln, a
cool, common-sense African American.</TE>
<TE>   They wage war against adults with such elaborately assembled and
acronymed devices as M.O.S.Q.U.I.T.T.O.H. (Massively Oversized Super
Quick Undercover Icy Treat Transport on Helio-jets).</TE>
<TE>   Interestingly enough, "KND" resulted from a Cartoon Network
contest last year, in which 10 animated shorts vied to become a
full-fledged series, based on viewers' votes. The winner was the
creation of a man listed simply as Mr. Warburton, whose credits
include being a designer on the first season of "Beavis and
Butt-head" and an animator-director on "Schoolhouse Rock."</TE>
<TE>   The show's humor lies much closer to the latter's wholesomeness
than the former's depravity, attempting to play on both child and
adult levels. But judging from tonight's adventures, it's mainly
kid-oriented, in a Saturday-morning style, and the cartoon violence
is comparable.</TE>
<TE>   As for the stereotypes presented here, and the kinds of messages
they might send to kids, you can draw your own conclusions.</TE>

<DH>Other airlines are looking to pick up some of United's
gates at LAX, San Francisco</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jerry Hirsch</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The vultures are circling over the airports in Los Angeles and San
Francisco.</LD>
<LD>   Although United Airlines hasn't yet filed for bankruptcy court
protection, competitors are wasting no time talking to California's
largest airports about moving into terminal space the airline might
vacate in a restructuring.</LD>
<LD>   The specter of a bankruptcy filing by United parent UAL Corp. also
has prompted the major credit-rating services to review the debt
carried by Los Angeles International and San Francisco International
airports.</LD>
<TE>   United, the nation's second-largest airline, behind American, is
the biggest operator at LAX and San Francisco. It accounts for about
one out of every six air transportation jobs in the Golden State, and
more than a quarter of its 1,800 daily departures originate from a
California airport.</TE>
<TE>   Money-losing United has said failure to win a $1.8-billion federal
loan guarantee Wednesday probably will push it into Bankruptcy Court,
where it would seek protection from its creditors.</TE>
<TE>   United has nearly 23,000 employees in California, more than a
quarter of its 82,700 workers worldwide. The airline already has said
it plans to trim flights by 6% next year and slash employment by
9,000 workers by 2004, which could mean 3,000 California jobs lost. A
bankruptcy filing probably would precipitate greater cuts in staff
and service, according to analysts and people within the airline.</TE>
<TE>   No filing has been made. Yet rival airlines already are inquiring
about picking up airport gates and routes at San Francisco. Michael
McCarron, an airport spokesman, said the discussions were preliminary
and confidential. San Francisco, where United controls 25 of the 90
gates, is an important domestic and international hub for the
airline.</TE>
<TE>   LAX spokesman Paul Haney said the airport has had what he
characterized as "informal inquiries" from airlines looking to pick
up some of United's 27 gates and terminal space. United controls 17%
of LAX's gates.</TE>
<TE>   None of the major airlines would confirm holding talks with either
airport. Terminal space at major airports is a coveted asset, and if
United winds up reducing operations in a Chapter 11 reorganization,
as expected, it probably would have to give up some of its gates.</TE>
<TE>   As long as the airports were able to replace United's business
with other airlines' passengers, the facilities would not see much of
a reduction in their revenues. And analysts say a United bankruptcy
filing would not put the two airports in any immediate financial
danger because the carrier is current in its lease payments and
landing fees.</TE>
<TE>   United pays LAX about $39 million annually, which represents 8.3%
of the airport's $470.9-million budget. The airline pays San
Francisco International much more: $9.4 million a month in rent and
landing fees. That's 28% of the airport's revenue.</TE>
<TE>   Both airports, however, still have investment-grade credit ratings
and could withstand a modest downgrade, analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   It's important for airports to maintain positive ratings because
they rely on borrowing to fund capital improvements.</TE>
<TE>   Right now, LAX has the highest credit rating of any airport,
according to Fitch Ratings and Standard &amp; Poor's. But Fitch issued a
negative outlook for the facility Thursday because of uncertainty
over United's fate in particular and the poor operations of the
airline industry in general.</TE>
<TE>   The agency put San Francisco's airport on a negative ratings watch
-- a more severe warning of a potential downgrade -- because of its
greater exposure to United's troubles.</TE>
<TE>   United accounts for about 50% of the traffic in San Francisco but
just under 18% at Los Angeles International.</TE>
<TE>   San Francisco International "has limited flexibility to handle
further service level disruptions by United," S&amp;P said when it issued
a negative outlook on the airport's debt this week.</TE>
<TE>   Not only is United the dominant airline at San Francisco
International, offering 160 domestic and international departures
daily, but the airport also is home to the carrier's West Coast
maintenance facility, a sprawling bay-side complex that employs about
5,000 workers.</TE>
<TE>   Additionally, San Francisco International has seen its fixed costs
rise sharply and passenger traffic plunge 20% since last year's
terrorist attacks upended the airline industry, Fitch Ratings said.</TE>
<TE>   The decline in traffic has cut into parking fees, duty-free sales
and concession revenue, a trend that could worsen if United sheds
flights at the airport.</TE>
<TE>   Fitch projects that San Francisco's operating cost per passenger
will reach $19.99 in the 2003 fiscal year, higher than at most
comparable U.S. airports.</TE>
<TE>   By comparison, an analysis of LAX's operations for the rating
services placed its current cost per passenger at $5.70.</TE>
<TE>   In a worst-case scenario -- in which United goes out of business
and its traffic is not replaced -- LAX's cost per passenger would
rise to only $7.46, still at the low end for most major airports.
United has 113 daily departures from LAX.</TE>

<HD>Intel, AMD Report Surge in Demand</HD>
<DH>Chip makers say PC and cell phone orders are pushing
results past earlier estimates for the fourth quarter.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The two leading chip companies said Thursday that the fourth quarter
was shaping up stronger than they had expected as demand rose for
personal computers and cellular phones.</LD>
<LD>   Santa Clara, Calif.-based Intel Corp., the world's biggest chip
maker, said fourth-quarter sales would come in between $6.8 billion
and $7 billion, up from an October estimate of $6.5 billion to $6.9
billion. The company attributed the increase to growing demand for
processors in Asia.</LD>
<LD>   Gross margin, the percentage of sales left after paying production
costs, will be at the high end of the Intel's prior forecast of 49%,
"plus or minus a couple of points," the company said.</LD>
<TE>   No. 2 chip maker Advanced Micro Devices Inc. also said it expects
fourth-quarter sales of close to $700 million, a 35% jump over the
third quarter. Previously, AMD predicted a 20% increase. Analysts
surveyed by Multex had forecast revenue of $599.6 million for the
three months ending Dec. 31.</TE>
<TE>   The Sunnyvale, Calif., company said the improvement is the result
of greater-than-expected demand for PC processors as well as flash
memory, which is used in cell phones. The maker of Athlon and Duron
processors did not say how the revenue increase would affect its
expected fourth-quarter loss.</TE>
<TE>   The rosier outlooks boosted shares of both companies Thursday.
Intel stock, which fell 78 cents to $18.96 in regular Nasdaq trading,
jumped to $19.43 in after-hours trading. AMD rose 40 cents to $8.25
on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   The reports show that conditions are better in the current quarter
than companies expected even a few months ago, although the end of
the year is typically strong due to holiday sales, said Mark
Grossman, an analyst at SG Cowen Securities.</TE>
<TE>   "If you add up the total for the second half [of the year], it's
still down 20% from the first half," Grossman said. "At this point
the real question is do we get a corporate upgrade cycle next year in
PCs? All we've seen is a seasonal pickup."</TE>

<HD>Irvine Office Park Chosen for Residential Towers Project</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jesus Sanchez</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Canadian developer on Thursday announced plans to begin
construction early next year on twin, 18-story condominium towers in
Irvine in what will be Orange County's first major high-rise
residential project.</LD>
<LD>   An affiliate of Vancouver-based Bosa Development Corp. will build
the towers on a 2.3-acre parcel it recently purchased at Park Place,
a sprawling office complex that features the former Fluor Corp.
headquarters at Jamboree Road and the San Diego Freeway.</LD>
<LD>   The project, which will be called Marquee at Park Place, includes
120 units in each tower. Construction plans have been submitted to
city officials for review.</LD>
<TE>   Prices for the development's two- and three-bedroom units have not
been established, but Bosa's high-rise condominiums in San Diego sell
for between $300,000 and $1 million, said company spokeswoman Gale
Tobin.</TE>
<TE>   Sales and construction are scheduled to begin in the spring.</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles and San Diego areas are home to numerous high-rise
residential projects, but such buildings are rare in Orange County,
where most luxury complexes have remained low-rise structures, said
real estate consultant John Burns. "There is nothing like this in
Orange County," he said.</TE>
<TE>   In downtown San Diego, Bosa has completed or is nearing completion
on three high-rise condominiums and has begun construction on the
first of two 39-story towers near the historic Santa Fe Depot.</TE>

<HD>El Paso Electric to Refund $14 Million</HD>
<DH>The utility also will stop trading power through 2004 to
settle allegations that it helped Enron manipulate the market.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Chris Baltimore</AU>
<BD>Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>El Paso Electric Co. on Thursday agreed to refund $14 million and
forfeit power trading privileges for two years to settle charges that
it schemed with Enron Corp. to manipulate California's electricity
market during its power crisis.</LD>
<LD>   In August, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission launched a
formal investigation into whether Enron used El Paso Electric and
Avista Corp. to circumvent trading rules as California reeled from
blackouts and soaring wholesale power prices from late 2000 through
mid-2001.</LD>
<LD>   Enron used power generated by El Paso Electric to launch a scheme
known as "Fat Boy," FERC lawyers alleged in documents filed with the
agency Thursday. The trading strategy involved collecting payments
for creating fictitious congestion on California's power grid.</LD>
<TE>   FERC attorneys accused El Paso Electric of giving control of some
of its power plants to Enron without FERC approval and failing to
notify the agency of an arrangement in which Enron sold power on its
behalf.</TE>
<TE>   The agency is separately investigating Enron for its aggressive
wholesale electricity trading strategies, which helped the company
boost its profit during the California power crisis.</TE>
<TE>   El Paso Electric, a Texas utility, is not related to El Paso
Corp., the natural gas pipeline company involved in other
California-related cases before FERC.</TE>
<TE>   El Paso Electric agreed to refund $14 million in revenue from
wholesale power deals and to refrain from making market-based
electricity sales through the end of 2004, the firm said.</TE>
<TE>   FERC lawyers did not identify how much El Paso Electric allegedly
profited from its participation in Enron trades.</TE>
<TE>   However, El Paso Electric reaped $7.3 million in revenue in June
2000 alone through its arrangement with Enron, according to documents
filed at FERC this year.</TE>
<TE>   As part of the settlement, El Paso Electric traders also will
cooperate with FERC lawyers who are trying to determine to what
extent Enron was using improper trading schemes, according to the
FERC documents.</TE>

<HD>Cash-Out Mortgage Refinancings Hit Record 12.2%</HD>
<DH>U.S. household debt rises at a rate of 9.6%. An economist
worries about a drop in prices.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Peter G. Gosselin</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>American families used mortgage refinancing to pull cash from their
homes at a record 12.2% annual pace in the third quarter, helping to
fuel a continued spending spree, but raising the risk of a nasty fall
if housing prices falter.</LD>
<LD>   The Federal Reserve's flow of funds report issued Thursday showed
that so-called cash-out refinancings grew at a $320 billion annual
rate during the quarter, and that household debt overall climbed at a
9.6% pace, substantially faster than in the hottest years of the
1990s boom.</LD>
<LD>   Analysts said that although some of the funds appear to have gone
into improving the homes from which the money was drawn, much more of
it went to pay for routine purchases, a dangerous trend.</LD>
<TE>   "It's setting people up for a big down-drop," said Goldman Sachs
economist Jan Hatzius.</TE>
<TE>   Hatzius said the cash-out refinancing helps explain why consumer
spending rose at a 4.1% annual pace in the quarter, helping buoy an
otherwise sagging economy. But he said the trend is unsustainable.
"Going forward, it has got to come down.</TE>
<TE>   "The only questions are when and how quickly," he added.</TE>
<TE>   The quarterly Fed report showed that household net worth fell
almost a half point to $6.38 trillion between the second and third
quarters, largely because of stock-market losses.</TE>
<TE>   Hatzius said that the decline brings the ratio of net worth to
income back in line with historical averages. The bulging of net
worth relative to income was one of the most striking trends of the
'90s boom.</TE>
<TE>   "In a sense, the entire explosion of wealth relative to income
that occurred in the 1990s has disappeared," Hatzius said.</TE>

<HD>FTC Sues Maker of Body Solutions</HD>
<DH>Mark Nutritionals is accused of using false claims in the
marketing of its weight-loss formula.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Ronald D. White and Robert Patrick</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Government regulators Thursday sought to slim down the amazing claims
for a popular weight-loss formula called Body Solutions by suing the
marketer of the product for deceptive advertising.</LD>
<LD>   The Federal Trade Commission and two states, Texas and Illinois,
sued Mark Nutritionals Inc. and its officers for the company's "false
and unsubstantiated" claims that its products would produce weight
loss without diet or exercise.</LD>
<LD>   Mark Nutritionals blanketed the nation's radio waves -- including
KFWB-AM (980) and KNX-AM (1070) in Los Angeles -- with weight-loss
ads using the familiar and persuasive voices of local radio
personalities.</LD>
<TE>   The company booked more than $190 million in sales since 1999, the
FTC said, by claiming that its Body Solutions Evening Weight Loss
Formula bedtime drink would burn away fat while people slept, and
that consumers could keep eating pizza, tacos, nachos and doughnuts.</TE>
<TE>   "They are claims that from a scientific perspective are not
possible," said the chief of the FTC's Bureau of Consumer Protection,
J. Howard Beales.</TE>
<TE>   In one ad cited by the FTC, a voice intones: "It helped me lose 36
pounds and it helps me maintain through the holidays. I mean, I ate
so much over Thanksgiving, I still have turkey burps. But thanks to
Body Solutions, I keep the weight off and now I'm ready for
Christmas."</TE>
<TE>   Beales said he expects a federal judge to sign an order requiring
Mark Nutritionals to remove the words "weight loss" from the name of
its product.</TE>
<TE>   Mark Nutritionals filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in
September.</TE>
<TE>   The company said Thursday that it agreed to change its ads to
address the FTC's concerns. "We are moving forward with a new way to
promote and advertise our product," said Mark Nutritionals' acting
chief executive, Larry Cochran. The FTC suit was filed in U.S.
District Court in San Antonio. The company denied that it broke any
laws.</TE>
<TE>   At KFWB, newscaster Ron Kilgore was the voice of the
advertisements until the station stopped airing them in the spring,
said general manager Roger Nadel. Kilgore left the station in August
for another job.</TE>
<TE>   At KNX, traffic reporter Pat Haslam used to pitch Body Solutions
until about four months ago, said General Manager George Nicholaw. He
noted that he didn't think it was inappropriate for a traffic
reporter to have recorded the ads.</TE>
<TE>   Infinity Broadcasting, the parent of both KNX and KFWB, filed a
$9-million lawsuit against Mark Nutritionals in September, claiming
that some of its stations hadn't been paid for ads dating back to
December 2001. Infinity is owned by Viacom Inc.</TE>
<TE>   The FTC said in the last decade many ads have become more
misleading in their claims, and the agency implored media outlets to
do more to protect the public by policing pitches.</TE>
<TE>   David Heber, director of the UCLA Center for Human Nutrition, said
advertising standards are too lenient -- particularly for radio and
TV infomercials.</TE>
<TE>   Nutrition experts say between 50 million and 70 million Americans
are trying to lose weight. Obesity has become the second leading
cause of preventable death in the U.S., behind smoking. In turn, a
$30-billion-a-year weight-loss industry has emerged.</TE>
<TE>   Most experts agree that losing a pound or a pound and a half of
weight a week is a reasonable goal that can be reached by moderately
reducing food intake and regularly doing light exercise.</TE>
<TE>   Bonnie Jortberg, program director of the University of Colorado's
weight-loss program, said the Body Solutions ads were so convincing
in part because they used familiar radio voices that consumers had
come to trust.</TE>
<TE>   In all, Mark Nutritionals peddled its products through testimonial
endorsements from disc jockeys on more than 650 radio stations in 110
cities across the country. "With radio, there's also no visible
evidence," Jortberg said. "No one really sees these people."</TE>
<TE>   The Body Solutions ads, added Jortberg, "really play off the
American passion for a quick fix. It just sounds great. Poof, there
go the pounds."</TE>

<HD>Video Game Sales on Track for Record Year</HD>
<DH>The industry may hit $12 billion in revenue for 2002,
countering predictions of weak consumer spending.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Alex Pham</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Blasting its way into the mainstream, the video game industry is
defying predictions of slack consumer spending and appears on track
to hit record sales this year of $12 billion.</LD>
<LD>   Supported by a growing base of consoles in U.S. homes, game
software sales grew by more than 20% over the Thanksgiving weekend
compared with the same period last year, according to the Interactive
Entertainment Merchants Assn.</LD>
<LD>   Hal Halpin, president of IEMA, said he expects to report a 23%
increase in software sales for the year. His Wilton, Conn., trade
group represents Wal-Mart Stores Inc. and other retailers that
account for 90% of the industry's business.</LD>
<TE>   The IEMA projection of $12 billion in total sales, which includes
software and console revenue, compares with less than $10 billion
last year. By comparison, Hollywood box-office receipts last year
totaled $8.4 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Driving sales of games are the popularity of Sony Corp.'s
PlayStation 2 and Nintendo Co.'s Game Boy Advance. Sony sold nearly
533,000 consoles during the Thanksgiving week, or 60% more than in
the same period last year. That brought the total number of
PlayStation 2s in North America to 14.5 million, according to Sony
spokeswoman Molly Smith. Sony estimated that it would see sales of 20
million PlayStation 2s by March 31.</TE>
<TE>   "We're well on track with our projections," Smith said.</TE>
<TE>   Also moving briskly was the Game Boy Advance, which sold 1 million
units in the 10 days ending Sunday. Year-to-date sales of the
hand-held system are up 140%, according to Nintendo spokeswoman
Perrin Kaplan.</TE>
<TE>   Microsoft Corp. did not release sales of its Xbox console.</TE>
<TE>   Although the results are early, and sales could peter out over the
next three weeks, analysts remain confident about the industry's
momentum.</TE>
<TE>   "We're going to have a phenomenal Christmas, and last week just
bears that out," said Michael Pachter, a research director at Wedbush
Morgan Securities who visited 37 video game retailers across the
country last weekend. "The stores were just jammed, and everybody was
buying."</TE>
<TE>   Consumers snapped up copies of "Grand Theft Auto: Vice City" for
PlayStation 2 and "Splinter Cell" for Xbox, said Peter Roithmayr,
vice president of merchandising for Electronics Boutique, a West
Chester, Pa., chain that specializes in computer and video games.</TE>
<TE>   Also popular were "Tony Hawk 4," published by Activision Inc. in
Santa Monica; "Mortal Kombat: Deadly Alliance," from Midway Games
Inc. in Chicago; "WWE Smackdown: Shut Your Mouth," from THQ Inc. in
Calabasas; and "Bond 007: Nightfire," from Electronic Arts Inc. in
Redwood City, Calif.</TE>
<TE>   With more than 1,000 games introduced this year, competition for
retail shelf space has been fierce, leading some analysts to predict
that software publishers may begin discounting titles before the
holidays end, according to a UBS Warburg report released this week.</TE>
<TE>   Console companies also are spurring sales by offering systems
bundled with software at discount prices. Nintendo, for example, has
been selling a bundle that includes its GameCube console, "Super
Mario Sunshine" game and a memory card for $189, about $30 less than
if the items were bought separately. Microsoft is selling its Xbox
with two free games from Sega Corp.</TE>
<TE>   "What we're seeing more of are bundles and promotions, a lot more
than last year," said Mike Wallace, an analyst with UBS Warburg.
"From an industry standpoint, things are going well. But from a
competitive standpoint, it's a lot tougher because there are so many
more games out this year."</TE>

<HD>Honda in No Hurry to Expand Its Hybrid Car Product Line</HD>
<DH>The automaker says it won't sacrifice profit to expand use
of the fuel-efficient system to vehicles beyond the current two
models.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Honda Motor Co. won't be hasty in adding more gasoline-electric
hybrid autos to its product line because the company won't sacrifice
profit as it expands use of the fuel-efficient system, the company's
chief executive said.</LD>
<LD>   Honda and Toyota Motor Corp. have sold hybrid cars in the U.S. for
more than two years. Toyota has said it will announce new models in
early 2003 beyond its Prius small car. Honda officials have said they
have no short-term plans to expand beyond the two-seat Insight
subcompact and the Civic Hybrid.</LD>
<LD>   "We have some plans for the future, but we're not so hasty in
bringing our technology into the market even though we can do it
anytime," said Hiroyuki Yoshino, Honda's president and chief
executive. Any vehicle could get a hybrid powertrain, Yoshino said,
without specifying when a decision would be made.</LD>
<TE>   Hybrids were developed to meet stricter environmental rules in the
U.S., Japan and Europe. They have improved fuel efficiency and low
tailpipe pollution. Toyota and Honda, the only companies that sell
such models, have struggled to overcome an added per-car expense of
at least $3,000 for the system, which combines a gas engine, electric
motors, batteries and regenerative brakes.</TE>
<TE>   Honda's Civic Hybrid, with a U.S. base price of $19,550, sells for
an amount that recovers the added component cost. It will be years
before Honda recoups its investment in developing the technology,
Yoshino said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not surprising Honda may want to take a more financially
conservative approach than Toyota. They're still a much smaller
company," said analyst Thad Malesh, who studies alternative-power
technologies at J.D. Power &amp; Associates. "Even if they don't add
anything next year, they'll benefit from a tailwind created by
Toyota's announcements."</TE>
<TE>   U.S. hybrid car sales this year should reach almost 35,000 units,
Malesh said. Honda estimates it will sell about 13,000 Insight and
Civic Hybrids in 2002. Toyota sold 18,329 Prius models this year
through November and expects full-year sales of 20,000.</TE>
<TE>   Honda's U.S. operations are based in Torrance. The company's
American depositary receipts, which each represent half of an
ordinary share, fell 10 cents to $18.45 in New York Stock Exchange
trading. The shares have fallen 9% this year.</TE>

<HD>Stocks Slip Again on Fears About United</HD>
<DH>The airline's expected bankruptcy filing and weak holiday
retail sales drag down the Dow, S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq indexes.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Stocks fell Thursday for the fifth straight session as fears about an
expected bankruptcy filing by United Airlines and tepid holiday
retail sales renewed doubts over whether the two-month rally can
survive.</LD>
<LD>   The Dow Jones industrials slid more than 110 points, although
trading was light as a snowstorm pelted the East Coast.</LD>
<LD>   "The United Airlines news has got the market a little spooked,"
Todd Clark, head of listed equity trading at Wells Fargo Securities,
told Associated Press. "We're seeing weakness in the financial
stocks, part of it due to their exposure to United Airlines bonds."</LD>
<TE>   The 30-stock Dow Jones industrial average dropped 114.57 points,
or 1.3%, to close at 8,623.28, and broader indexes also fell. The
Standard &amp; Poor's 500 declined 11.02 points, or 1.2%, to 906.55, and
the tech-heavy Nasdaq composite fell 19.60 points, or 1.4%, to
1,410.75.</TE>
<TE>   Losers topped winners by about 3 to 2 on the New York Stock
Exchange and Nasdaq.</TE>
<TE>   Treasury bond yields eased as traders reacted to reports of soft
November retail sales, which stoked concerns about the health of the
economic recovery. The yield on the benchmark 10-year T-note eased to
4.14%, from 4.15% on Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Investors were unmoved by a Labor Department report showing that
new claims for unemployment benefits fell last week by a seasonally
adjusted 13,000, to 355,000. It was the lowest level since February
2001, offering hope to workers as they move into the holiday shopping
season, but analysts noted that overall the economic data remained a
mixed bag.</TE>
<TE>   Among Thursday's stocks on the move, United parent UAL plunged
$2.12 to $1 after the federal government rejected the airline's
request for a $1.8-billion loan guarantee. The decision prompted Dow
Jones to yank UAL from its Dow transportation average, replacing it
with United Parcel Service.</TE>
<TE>   Boeing fell 97 cents to $32.96 as United's troubles sparked
concerns over product demand in the battered commercial aerospace
market. Among engine makers, United Technologies lost $1.59 to $61.16
and General Electric slid 72 cents to $25.80.</TE>
<TE>   Some rivals of United Airlines rallied, however, among them
American Airlines' parent, AMR, which gained 54 cents to $7.58.</TE>
<TE>   In other highlights:</TE>
<TE>   * Financial stocks fell after Merrill Lynch cut its rating on
banks and brokers and as investors fretted about the ripple effect of
a United bankruptcy filing. Morgan Stanley slipped $1.62 to $42.40,
Goldman Sachs lost $1.90 to $74.45, and Citigroup fell 71 cents to
$37.14.</TE>
<TE>   * Retailing stocks mostly fell as Wal-Mart Stores and others
posted monthly sales tallies at the low end of forecasts. Wal-Mart
lost $1.42 to $53.02, Abercrombie &amp; Fitch slid $1.50 to $22.31, and
Costco Wholesale dropped $1.15 to $31.10.</TE>
<TE>   Elsewhere in the sector, American Eagle Outfitters lost $3.12 to
$15.87 after falling shy of sales estimates, and mail-order house J.
Jill Group sank $6.49 to $16.52 after cutting its fourth-quarter
earnings estimates.</TE>
<TE>   * Among big tech names, chip maker Intel declined 78 cents to
$18.98 ahead of its mid-quarter update late Thursday, but the shares
rose modestly in after-hours trading after the company raised sales
guidance.</TE>
<TE>   Competitor Advanced Micro Devices gained 40 cents to $8.25 after
raising its fourth-quarter sales outlook.</TE>

<HD>Mattel Settles Shareholders Lawsuit for $122 Million</HD>
<DH>The El Segundo-based toy maker closes the books on its
ill-fated $3.5-billion purchase of Learning Co.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Abigail Goldman</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Mattel Inc. on Thursday closed the books on what has been called one
of the worst acquisitions in corporate history, announcing a
$122-million settlement with shareholders over its ill-fated purchase
of Learning Co.</LD>
<LD>   The El Segundo-based toy maker said it would take a $25.5-million
pretax charge in the fourth quarter to cover legal fees and an
uninsured portion of the settlement, with the balance to be paid by
insurers.</LD>
<LD>   Mattel's settlement ranks No. 12 on the list of largest monetary
agreements between a company and its shareholders, according to
Cornerstone Research, a litigation consulting company.</LD>
<TE>   That's still well behind the record setter, Cendant Corp.'s
$3.2-billion settlement in 2000 over allegations of improper
accounting.</TE>
<TE>   "The settlement of this litigation represents the final conclusion
to an unfortunate chapter in Mattel's history," said Bob Normile, the
company's general counsel. "We are pleased to have this distraction
behind us."</TE>
<TE>   Mattel bought the software company in 1999 for about $3.5 billion,
a price that many observers considered too steep. As the unit began
to bleed money, ultimately costing Mattel more than $1 million a day,
the company's stock began to crumble, eventually falling more than
65%.</TE>
<TE>   The acquisition cost Jill Barad her job as Mattel chief executive;
her $50-million severance package further enraged shareholders.</TE>
<TE>   Mattel since has pledged not to grant severance benefits that
"significantly exceed" those contained in employment contracts.</TE>
<TE>   Mattel essentially gave Learning Co. to Los Angeles- based Gores
Technology Group in late 2000 for future consideration, and last
quarter it received a one-time payment of $27.3 million for the unit.</TE>
<TE>   Although the settlement cost is steep, securities experts said,
the company's fate before a jury could have been far worse.</TE>
<TE>   "A couple of years ago, nobody really knew about securities
cases," said John Gould, Cornerstone's vice president, who said any
case that settles for more than $100 million qualifies as a
"mega-settlement."</TE>
<TE>   "Now with Enron and WorldCom, I think the public awareness of
securities cases is much higher," Gould said.</TE>
<TE>   "What that means is that there is more concern over going to trial
because the average person only knows about the cases where something
seriously wrong happened."</TE>
<TE>   Mattel shares fell 13 cents Thursday to $20.19 on the New York
Stock Exchange; the stock has gained 17% this year.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>McDonald's Corp. Chief Executive Jack Greenberg said Thursday that he
would retire at year's end.</LD>
<LD>   The restaurant chain named Jim Cantalupo, former vice chairman and
president of the firm, to succeed Greenberg, 60.</LD>
<LD>   The company eight months ago said Greenberg, once a Wall Street
favorite whose star faded, had agreed to stay at his post for three
more years.</LD>
<TE>   Analysts said they were not surprised by Greenberg's retirement,
citing McDonald's disappointing profit and the 55% drop in its stock
price since Greenberg became chairman in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   The announcement came as Greenberg, a former accountant who rose
through McDonald's financial ranks, struggled to revive sales in the
United States, the world's largest fast-food market.</TE>
<TE>   McDonald's expanded the number of its signature Golden Arches
restaurants by more than 30% during Greenberg's five years at the
helm.</TE>
<TE>   But after years of heady growth, McDonald's faced growing
competition in a saturated market. Its food and service suffered,
critics said, and they questioned whether it had grown too rapidly.</TE>
<TE>   A hamburger price war broke out with archrival Burger King Corp.,
and the discounting threatened to further erode profit.</TE>
<TE>   One of Greenberg's biggest problems was disappointment that a new
cooking system aimed at improving quality and service did not live up
to expectations.</TE>
<TE>   Overseas, sales have been hurt by outbreaks of "mad-cow" disease
in Europe and Japan, which weakened demand for beef, as well as
currency crises in Latin America.</TE>
<TE>   McDonald's posted earnings declines in seven out of the last eight
quarters. The company last month announced layoffs and signaled that
it would begin to slow the pace of expansion, exiting several
overseas markets. In October, it announced plans to drastically cut
back on restaurant openings in the United States and said it would
spend more money to refurbish its existing locations. But some
investors said the changes were too little too late.</TE>
<TE>   "They should drastically slow the pace of new store openings in
the United States, preferably to zero," said David Kolpak, an analyst
with Victory Capital Management.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the discontent [with Greenberg] has been with the pace of
that change, and investors should be able to read some hope into this
management change in that a new team may have more of a mandate to
move faster."</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Oak Brook, Ill.-based McDonald's rose 41 cents to $18.78
on the New York Stock Exchange after the news.</TE>

<HD>Judge Says Microsoft 'Kneecapped' Rival Sun</HD>
<DH>In antitrust case, the software giant's tactics are
compared to those of supporters of figure skater Tonya Harding.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>James Rowley</AU>
<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL>BALTIMORE</DL>
<LD>Microsoft Corp. hobbled Sun Microsystems Inc. the way supporters of
figure skater Tonya Harding "kneecapped" skating rival Nancy Kerrigan
before the 1994 Olympics, said the judge overseeing an antitrust case
here against the world's leading software company.</LD>
<LD>   U.S. District Judge J. Frederick Motz made the comparison Thursday
as he challenged Microsoft's argument that it shouldn't be forced to
include Sun's Java programming language in Windows, the operating
system software that runs more than 90% of the world's personal
computers. Sun is seeking that remedy as compensation for harm it
says Microsoft inflicted on Java.</LD>
<LD>   Motz is reviewing Sun's request for a preliminary injunction that
would prevent Microsoft from distributing Windows without Java. He is
overseeing more than 60 suits by consumers and competitors against
the company.</LD>
<TE>   The judge questioned testimony by University of Chicago economist
Kevin Murphy, who said Santa Clara, Calif.-based Sun should be
limited to seeking monetary damages. Sun, which wants at least $1
billion in damages, sued after a federal judge ruled that Redmond,
Wash.-based Microsoft broke the law.</TE>
<TE>   "There are a lot of people who would rather play for the
championship" than collect monetary damages, Motz said.</TE>
<TE>   The judge likened Java to Kerrigan, who was clubbed in the knee
while practicing for the U.S. Figure Skating Championships in 1994.
As a result, he said, "Nancy Kerrigan is deprived of the opportunity
to compete on two good knees."</TE>
<TE>   Murphy, who testified for Microsoft, said forcing Windows to
include Sun's version of Java would distort the market. Just because
the market "was tilted one way, tilting it the other way now doesn't
compensate, it doesn't correct" an imbalance, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Motz responded: "It's not for me to engineer the market but to
unengineer the market to take out the distortion that Microsoft put
in."</TE>
<TE>   The judge also said Java might be stronger if Microsoft had
honored a 1997 agreement with Sun to distribute the software instead
of giving computer users a version that is incompatible with Windows.
Microsoft denies breaking the agreement with Sun, and the companies
settled their dispute out of court.</TE>
<TE>   On Nasdaq, Microsoft shares fell $1.20 to $55.34 and Sun shares
slipped 15 cents to $3.61.</TE>

<HD>Perot: Cal-ISO Documents Leaked</HD>
<DH>An engineer sold confidential papers to a Taipower
consultant, e-mail messages show.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Nancy Rivera Brooks</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An engineer working for Perot Systems Corp. to set up the California
Independent System Operator's computers in 1997 gave confidential
Cal-ISO documents to a consultant working for a Taiwanese power
company, according to internal Perot Systems e-mail messages obtained
as part of a state investigation.</LD>
<LD>   The Perot Systems worker, Shangyou Hao, was paid $480 by the
Taipower consultant even though Hao was a full-time employee of the
Plano, Texas, computer company, the messages and a letter from a
Perot Systems lawyer indicate. Hao, who could not be reached for
comment, recently was fired because of the incident.</LD>
<LD>   "It was a clear violation of company policy," Perot spokesman
Eddie Reeves said.</LD>
<TE>   Perot Systems, which has been accused by state Sen. Joe Dunn
(D-Santa Ana) of peddling a detailed plan to electricity suppliers on
how to manipulate California electricity markets, said the documents
leaked by Hao were about computer systems and had nothing to do with
allegations of market manipulation.</TE>
<TE>   The e-mail messages indicate that Taipower, interested in setting
up a grid operator similar to Cal-ISO, wanted several items,
including documents describing the hardware and software used by the
Cal-ISO control center to balance supply and demand on the state's
transmission grid.</TE>
<TE>   A Cal-ISO lawyer expressed alarm at the breach of confidentiality
but said officials at the state's transmission grid operator say the
leaks pose no threat to its system.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't believe there is any risk to the system, but we're still
assessing," Cal-ISO general counsel Charles Robinson said. "We have
lots of firewalls."</TE>
<TE>   Perot Systems disclosed the incident in a news release Wednesday.
The company said it recently discovered the ethical breach as part of
an extensive five-month search for documents requested by several
governmental inquiries into manipulation of California energy
markets, including a probe by Dunn's special investigative committee.</TE>
<TE>   Company founder H. Ross Perot, a two-time U.S. presidential
candidate, appeared before Dunn's committee in July and said his
company did not sell confidential information to help others profit
from the market's weaknesses.</TE>
<TE>   Perot Systems on Wednesday said that after producing more than
70,000 pages of documents in response to the investigations, the
company "continues to believe that it was never engaged by any market
participant to provide market simulation or gaming software or
services for the deregulated California energy market."</TE>

<HD>Former CEO Files Lawsuit Against Casino Company</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Pinnacle Entertainment Inc. was sued for wrongful termination by its
former chief executive, who said the casino company blamed him for a
2001 "weekend of debauchery" that led to regulatory sanctions and
harassment suits.</LD>
<LD>   Paul Alanis, whose resignation was announced in April by
Glendale-based Pinnacle, claims that the June 2001 event at the
Belterra Casino in Indiana was organized by the former chairman of
Pinnacle's board, R.D. Hubbard. Pinnacle said in a statement that it
has "substantial defenses" to his allegations.</LD>
<LD>   Pinnacle said in August that it would pay a $2.26-million fine to
the Indiana Gaming Commission and close the Belterra Casino for three
days in connection with harassment lawsuits filed against the company
by two former employees.</LD>
<TE>   Alanis "was unjustifiably made to appear responsible" by Pinnacle
"for a weekend of debauchery" at a golf tournament that included
prostitutes, according to the suit filed Wednesday in Los Angeles
County Superior Court.</TE>
<TE>   The company's shares, which have risen 9% so far this year, rose
25 cents to $6.58 Thursday on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>

<HD>New PCs Have a Gateway to Digital Music</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jon Healey</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Like many of the computers already in homes, a new line of PCs
launching today from Gateway Inc. will be stocked with digital copies
of hit songs.</LD>
<LD>   The difference is that the songs won't come from online pirates.
Instead, they'll be loaded on the PCs with the blessings of the major
record labels and music publishers.</LD>
<LD>   The agreement between Gateway and online music distributor
Pressplay may be the first of many by the record labels and their
allies to bundle songs with digital devices, which are transforming
the way consumers collect, arrange and enjoy music.</LD>
<TE>   The goal is to steer consumers away from online file-sharing
services and other unauthorized sources of music, which let users
copy songs for free.</TE>
<TE>   Pressplay, which is owned by Vivendi Universal's Universal Music
Group and Sony Corp.'s Sony Music Entertainment, pays royalties when
songs on the computers are played. Gateway PC buyers will receive one
to three months of Pressplay's service for free, but they'll have to
pay at least $9.95 a month thereafter to keep playing the 150 to
2,000 songs preloaded on their computers.</TE>
<TE>   The theory is that if consumers have a convenient way to sample
and buy music, most of them won't go to the trouble of downloading it
from the Internet for free. The preloaded music would be wrapped in
electronic locks to deter piracy, trigger royalty payments and set
limits on playback.</TE>
<TE>   In Gateway's case, those locks prevent people from moving songs to
portable devices or copying them onto CDs unless they pay an
additional fee of about $1 a song.</TE>
<TE>   Yet in some eyes, that's just what keeps the offer from being
really compelling.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't say it's the be-all, end-all distribution model that's
going to make people flock to buy access to 2,000 songs," said
analyst P.J. McNealy of GartnerG2, a technology research firm. "This
is interesting, but the portability piece is more important."</TE>
<TE>   Although some independent labels and services have made a few
efforts to bundle songs with devices, Pressplay is the first to do so
in a significant way with major-label music. Several of the majors
have been reluctant to preload their tracks onto hard drives for fear
the electronic locks will be picked and the music taken for free, but
those concerns have dimmed as virtually every CD has become available
online for free.</TE>
<TE>   Gateway irked the record companies last spring with an advertising
campaign that promoted consumers' right to download songs and burn
homemade compilation discs. In recent weeks, however, the company has
struck deals to promote two of the leading authorized online music
companies, Pressplay and Listen.com Inc. of San Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   Under the Pressplay arrangement, consumers can buy a computer with
150 digital songs from one of seven musical genres, or 2,000 songs
from a variety of pop, country, rock and hip-hop artists. The
genre-based packages can be added to any consumer laptop or desktop
for $30. The larger package, which comes with a 40-gigabyte hard
drive, can be added to any consumer desktop for $150.</TE>

<HD>A Mixed Bag for Clothing Retailers</HD>
<DH>Sales are off for Target and Kohl's, but some California
specialty stores post gains during November.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Leslie Earnest</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The nation's big retailers reported mixed November sales results
Thursday despite a surge in Thanksgiving weekend shopping, while some
California firms told of solid gains.</LD>
<LD>   Sales at stores open at least a year -- a key measure of growth --
dipped 0.1% last month from a year earlier, the first such drop in
November since at least 1970, according to Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi.</LD>
<LD>   San Francisco-based Gap Inc., parent of Gap, Old Navy and Banana
Republic stores, said same-store sales rose 9% in November, compared
with a 25% decrease in the same period last year.</LD>
<TE>   Pacific Sunwear of California Inc., an Anaheim company that sells
casual clothes to teens, said same-store sales jumped 11.7% last
month, while Industry-based Hot Topic Inc., which sells music-themed
apparel and accessories to teens, said comparable-store sales rose
4.7%.</TE>
<TE>   Elsewhere, sales drooped in November, even among industry
darlings.</TE>
<TE>   Wisconsin-based Kohl's Corp., a discount apparel retailer that
plans to open 28 stores in Southern California next spring, said
same-store sales dropped 3.4% for the month. And discounter Target
Corp. of Minneapolis, which operates Target, Mervyn's and Marshall
Field's stores, said comparable-store sales decreased 6.7% from the
year before.</TE>
<TE>   The disconnect between the stronger-than-expected results over
Thanksgiving weekend--the official launch of the holiday shopping
season -- and the lackluster sales for the month highlight the key
role low prices are now playing in sparking sales, experts say.</TE>
<TE>   But they caution that it would be a mistake to put too much stock
in November comparisons because Thanksgiving fell later in the month
this year, pushing more holiday sales into December. To accurately
gauge holiday results, sales for the two months must be combined,
they say.</TE>
<TE>   With the days till Christmas rapidly dwindling, analysts say
retailers and bargain-driven consumers now are locked in a game of
"retail chicken," as one of them put it, waiting to see who will
flinch.</TE>
<TE>   "There will be high pressure on shoppers to do their shopping, and
to the extent that they refuse to do it without bargains, it puts
intense pressure on retailers to offer incentives," said Kurt
Barnard, president of Barnard's Retail Trend Report in New Jersey.
"It's a game of chicken. Who caves in first?"</TE>
<TE>   But even with limited promotions, Hot Topic said its sales hit
records on the weekend after Thanksgiving and the weekend before. For
the month, Hot Topic's sales jumped 29%. Analysts said the company
has excelled partly because its products are different from what
teens find elsewhere in the malls.</TE>
<TE>   Gap, the nation's largest specialty retailer, said November's
results "slightly exceeded" its projections at the start of the
month. The company said shoppers are responding positively to its
marketing and holiday products, including multicolored scarves,
sweaters and hats. The month also is being compared with a very weak
November last year.</TE>
<TE>   Certainly not all California retailers were cheering Thursday.
Foothill Ranch-based Wet Seal Inc., which sells trendy clothes to
girls and young women, said its comparable-store sales fell 9.7% in
November. And Brisbane-based Bebe Stores Inc., which also sells
apparel to trend-conscious young women, said its comparable-store
sales dropped 15.1% in November, after a 10.3% decrease in the same
period last year.</TE>
<TE>   PacSun's earnings were up 97% through the third quarter. PacSun
also said it now expects fourth-quarter earnings will exceed by 3
cents analysts' current expectations of 52 cents a share.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, the company declared a three-for-two stock split, the
fifth three-for-two split in the last seven years. Investors boosted
PacSun's share price 6% to 27.64, up $1.59, in Nasdaq trading.</TE>
<TE>   Hot Topic's shares gained 38 cents, to $24.38; Wet Seal closed at
$11.36, down 43 cents; Bebe was unchanged at $13. All trade on
Nasdaq.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Finance officials from California and nine other states asked
Standard &amp; Poor's to remove 10 offshore companies from the S&amp;P 500
index.</LD>
<LD>   The request is the latest in a series of attempts to pressure the
companies to reregister in the United States.</LD>
<LD>   National labor officials joined the state officials in arguing
that the companies aren't paying their fair share of taxes because
they're based in places such as Bermuda or the Cayman Islands.</LD>
<TE>   Standard &amp; Poor's rejected the request, saying its index is
designed to reflect the broad U.S. stock market.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Warner Music Group has been quietly proposing to combine distribution
operations with at least one other major record company, sources
said. Warner has pitched such a consolidation to other labels for
years.</LD>
<LD>   The latest informal talks are prompting speculation that Warner
may renew its bid to buy or merge with British music giant EMI Group.
The two companies had tried to merge in 2000, but the deal collapsed
in the face of resistance from European antitrust regulators.
Analysts said that to push through a new deal, AOL Time Warner Inc.,
Warner Music's parent, would have to overcome a cash crunch and sort
out the complicated management of a combined company.</LD>

<LD>Troubled media giant AOL Time Warner Inc. plans to cut at least $100
million in operating expenses in its Internet unit because of a sharp
drop in advertising revenue and a shift in strategy, the Washington

slash hundreds of jobs at the Internet unit's Northern Virginia
headquarters because it expects ad revenue to drop 50% next year.</LD>
<LD>   Vice Chairman Joseph A. Ripp said the America Online service,
which connects 35 million subscribers to the Internet, will face cuts
in all divisions, including reduced computer network expenses and
layoffs in New York, California and Ohio, sources said.</LD>

<LD>California's biggest HMOs are getting richer even as rising medical
costs strain the budgets of their customers, according to filings
with state regulators.</LD>
<LD>   The state's five largest health maintenance organizations had
stockpiled reserves totaling $3.15 billion as of Sept. 30. That was
$2.2 billion more than they needed to meet the minimum standards of
financial health mandated by the state Department of Managed Health
Care.</LD>
<LD>   The five HMOs are: Kaiser Foundation, Blue Cross, Health Net, Blue
Shield and PacificCare.</LD>
<TE>   HMO critics, however, view the industry's large reserves as a sign

<HD>Key Tax Credit Could End for Manufacturers</HD>
<DH>The state law, which saves firms as much as $450 million a
year, may be discontinued because job growth has stalled.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Dan Morain</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>California manufacturers, already in the doldrums because of weakness
in the nation's economy, face the prospect of losing a major tax
credit that saves them as much as $450 million a year and was aimed
at stimulating job growth.</LD>
<LD>   Manufacturers received the tax break as part of an effort to help
end the recession of the early 1990s. But in a sign of the times,
they could lose it starting in 2004. The reason: Job growth,
particularly in high tech, has stalled. And that, in turn, may
trigger an automatic end to the tax credit.</LD>
<LD>   "It is a real threat," said lobbyist Chris Micheli, who represents
an array of manufacturers, from aerospace giant Lockheed Martin Corp.
to Bronco Wine Co. If the break isn't extended, he added, the result
"would be catastrophic."</LD>
<TE>   Yet with the state facing a $21-billion-plus budget deficit,
others view the potential disappearance of the so-called
manufacturers' investment credit as one way to raise revenue to pay
for government operations.</TE>
<TE>   "This tax credit has been a massive failure," said Lenny Goldberg,
lobbyist for the labor-backed California Tax Reform Assn. "If you
spend billions and have nothing to show for it, you ought to do away
with it."</TE>
<TE>   Although continuing the tax break will have support from
Republicans and some Democrats, the fate of legislation to keep it
going is uncertain, given the depth of the state's budgetary black
hole. The Davis administration was noncommittal about whether the
governor would advocate extending the tax credit.</TE>
<TE>   "The governor recognizes the value of the credit," Gov. Gray
Davis' press secretary, Steve Maviglio, said Thursday. "But these are
difficult budget times, and everything is under review."</TE>
<TE>   Republican Gov. Pete Wilson first pushed for the tax break in 1993
as a central part of an effort to revive the economy during the
recession of the early 1990s. The tax credit also was part of
Wilson's attempt to improve relations with business groups after he
presided over tax increases during his first years in office.</TE>
<TE>   The statute took effect in 1994 and provides companies with a 6%
tax credit to offset the cost of installing new equipment.
Manufacturers have used the credit to shave $400 million or more a
year from their tax bills.</TE>
<TE>   Then-Speaker Willie Brown (D-San Francisco) carried the
legislation in 1993 to create the credit, despite opposition from
other Democratic legislators and organized labor.</TE>
<TE>   Foes of the measure had argued that manufacturers would use the
credit to automate factories, which would hasten layoffs in the
high-paying manufacturing sector.</TE>
<TE>   To quiet the critics, Wilson and Brown agreed to tie the tax
credit to job creation.</TE>
<TE>   The legislation included a provision that the tax credit would
remain in effect only if there were 100,000 more manufacturing jobs
in 2001 than there were in 1994 -- a low point for the sector.</TE>
<TE>   During the late 1990s and into 2000, manufacturing job growth
exceeded the 1994 level by 200,000 jobs.</TE>
<TE>   In this latest economic downturn, however, there has been "a
precipitous decline in manufacturing, particularly in electronics and
the high-tech sector," Goldberg said.</TE>
<TE>   In order for the credit to remain in place, the number of
manufacturing jobs would have to be 1.877 million.</TE>
<TE>   Citing state employment numbers and legislative analyst estimates,
Goldberg said the number of manufacturing jobs is 1.799 million,
barely above the 1994 level.</TE>
<TE>   Businesses, which are likely to be forced to swallow other state
tax hikes in the coming year, are preparing to mount a lobbying drive
to save the manufacturing credit.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm outraged that anyone would be thinking about eliminating this
now," said Jack Stewart, president of the California Manufacturers &amp;
Technology Assn. "We ought to be doubling the manufacturers
investment credit, rather than taking it away."</TE>
<TE>   Manufacturers place at least some blame for their woes on
decisions made by Davis and his administration that they say have led
to higher electricity rates and increased workers' compensation
costs.</TE>
<TE>   "The timing could not be worse" to have the credit come to an end,
said state Sen. Dick Ackerman (R-Irvine), a budget committee member.</TE>

<HD>Shock Waves Likely From United Chapter 11</HD>
<DH>Travelers can be expected to find substantial changes in
the number of flights and ticket prices.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>James F. Peltz</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>United Airlines' likely bankruptcy filing would be the most dramatic
step yet in a restructuring of the airline business that could affect
passengers no matter which carrier they fly.</LD>
<LD>   The changes won't be immediate. United vowed to keep flying its
current schedule and honor frequent-flier miles even if it seeks
Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in the coming days, as most industry
observers expect.</LD>
<LD>   But over the next several months, as United is reorganized and
rivals shift gears in response, travelers are likely to see
substantial changes in the number of available flights, ticket prices
and perhaps even the number of airlines from which they can choose.</LD>
<TE>   United, which already was scaling back, is expected to pare even
more service to rid itself of unprofitable flights. Other airlines
might take over those flights, but if they don't some travelers would
be left with less convenient service. Fares are likely to rise over
the long term, after United and the rest of the industry reduces its
size to match passenger demand, some observers said.</TE>
<TE>   "There aren't going to be any better deals than there are right
now" for fares, said Robert Mann, president of the consulting firm
R.W. Mann &amp; Co. "Prices are inevitably going to rise" because nearly
all the airlines are losing money.</TE>
<TE>   Air service nationwide also could be shuffled if parts of United's
route system -- or the whole airline -- is bought while the carrier
is under Bankruptcy Court protection. "Another carrier or investors
who have designs on some of the plums of United's operations may be
making offers," said Chester Salomon, a bankruptcy lawyer in New
York.</TE>
<TE>   "There will be profound consequences to the industry," Salomon
added. There have been past airline bankruptcies, but none "as big as
United, with its multiple routes and international connections."</TE>
<TE>   It is in the bankruptcy process in which the dynamics of the whole
airline industry will be altered, experts said.</TE>
<TE>   As United scales back and slashes costs as part of a likely
Chapter 11 reorganization, it will put pressure on the other
"hub-and-spoke" network carriers such American, Delta and Northwest
to do the same. It also will make United a stronger competitor to
discount carriers such as Southwest and JetBlue, which operate with
lower costs and whose cheap fares are grabbing an increasing number
of passengers from larger airlines.</TE>
<TE>   Simultaneously, all other carriers will be watching to see if they
can snatch up service that United abandons. "Airlines like American
and Continental are going to move in and try to take advantage of
this turmoil" at United, said Fred Allvine, a marketing professor at
the Georgia Institute of Technology.</TE>
<TE>   United, a unit of Elk Grove Village, Ill.-based UAL Corp., is the
second-largest U.S. airline behind American. It operates about 1,800
flights a day. It is the biggest carrier at Los Angeles and San
Francisco international airports, and has an enormous presence in
Chicago, Denver and Tokyo. It has valuable transpacific,
transatlantic and Latin American routes, and on a busy day its planes
carry a quarter of a million passengers.</TE>
<TE>   Only a few years ago, United was the most powerful U.S. airline
and perhaps the favorite choice for business travelers. Its "friendly
skies" advertising slogan was a household phrase.</TE>
<TE>   But with the airline now saddled with high operating costs, the
persistent travel slump and passengers refusing to pay the high fares
of the late 1990s, United is running out of cash to pay its bills. On
Wednesday, a United bankruptcy filing became nearly inevitable after
the carrier's bid for a $1.8-billion federal loan guarantee was
rejected by the Bush administration.</TE>
<TE>   "We believe a Chapter 11 filing by Sunday is almost certain,"
James Higgins, an analyst at the investment firm Credit Suisse First
Boston, said in a note to clients.</TE>
<TE>   In response, UAL's battered stock plunged $2.12, or 68%, to close
at $1 a share after a delayed opening on the New York Stock Exchange.
UAL is 55% controlled by its employees, but the stock probably would
become worthless if United files for bankruptcy protection, wiping
out the workers' investment.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. Air Transportation Stabilization Board said it rejected
United's request for a loan guarantee because the carrier's blueprint
for recovery, which includes labor concessions of $5.2 billion, still
was not a "sound business plan." The panel concluded that if it
guaranteed the loan, taxpayers would be at risk if United were to
default.</TE>
<TE>   Once in Bankruptcy Court, United and its creditors probably will
use the cost-cutting plan it had presented to the ATSB as a base from
which to seek even bigger reductions in its operating expenses. That
could set the stage for flying profitably again.</TE>
<TE>   If United survives mostly intact as a stronger, more efficient
airline, it should help rationalize the entire industry. "Any of us
who fly a lot know there are still lots of planes out there that are
half-empty," said Meg VanDeWeghe, an executive-in-residence at the
University of Maryland's business school.</TE>
<TE>   Once the supply of airline seats is reduced to match passengers'
demand for them, VanDeWeghe said, "it will probably make flying
somewhat more expensive" as carriers drop their fare sales. "But in
the long run, we'll have a much healthier airline industry."</TE>

<HD>Delay Seen in Univision Merger</HD>
<DH>A media analyst says antitrust concerns may push back
approval of the L.A. firm's deal for Hispanic Broadcasting.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Meg James</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Federal review of Univision Communication Inc.'s proposed $2-billion
acquisition of the nation's leading Spanish-language radio
broadcaster has become "protracted" because of antitrust concerns,
according to a Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. report released Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Los Angeles-based Univision had predicted that it would win
federal approval for its purchase of Hispanic Broadcasting Corp. of
Dallas by January. However, Merrill Lynch media analyst Jessica Reif
Cohen said the closing date could slip to March.</LD>
<LD>   Reif wrote that although Federal Communications Commission
Chairman Michael K. Powell is said to support the deal, a Justice
Department review is "more uncertain" because of concerns of "undue
concentration in not only local markets, but also the national
marketplace."</LD>
<TE>   If the merger is approved, Univision could be required to divest
some of its 31% interest in Entravision Communications Corp., a Santa
Monica-based Spanish-language television, radio and billboard company
that is Univision's largest affiliate-station group, with 38
stations. Entravision also controls 55 Spanish-language radio
stations and 11,400 billboards, primarily in Los Angeles and New
York.</TE>
<TE>   Separately, Entravision announced that John F. DeLorenzo, a media
investment banking consultant and former executive of Paxson
Communications Corp., would become the company's chief financial
officer in January. DeLorenzo will replace the retiring Jeanette
Tully.</TE>
<TE>   Univision shares rose 33 cents to $27.72, Hispanic Broadcasting
rose 33 cents to $23.18, and Entravision shares fell 30 cents to
$10.25. All trade on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>

<HD>European Central Bank Cuts Interest Rate</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The European Central Bank tried to give the continent's flagging
economy a lift Thursday with a half-percentage-point cut in interest
rates.</LD>
<LD>   Faced with gloomy economic forecasts, ECB President Wim Duisenberg
said the bank's governing council had weighed "not even the 'if' of a
cut, but how much." The bank cut its key refinancing rate to 2.75%
from 3.25% -- where it had stood for 13 months to the growing dismay
of governments, investors and many economists.</LD>
<LD>   Duisenberg said economic growth in the 12 nations that share the
euro -- already sluggish at 0.3% in the third quarter -- is
threatened by "the persistently high degree of uncertainty."</LD>
<TE>   "Geopolitical tensions with potential consequences for oil prices,
developments in financial markets, the sluggish growth of the world
economy and the persistence of global imbalances are all factors that
weigh adversely on confidence," he said.</TE>
<TE>   There was no immediate lift for European stock markets, however,
as key indexes fell 2.9% in Germany, 1.3% in France and 0.4% in
Britain.</TE>

<HD>Bush Shouldn't Rush SEC Pick, Senator Says</HD>

<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>President Bush should take his time selecting a Securities and
Exchange Commission chairman who is respected and "feared a little,"
incoming Senate Banking Committee Chairman Richard C. Shelby said
Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   The Alabama Republican, who in January will take over the
committee that oversees the SEC and must confirm the next chairman,
said the agency needs a leader who is "not viewed as an industry
insider," a criticism many leveled at outgoing chief Harvey L. Pitt.
Shelby said he will not suggest any names.</LD>
<LD>   "I believe that while it is important to select a new chairman, it
is just as important to find the right person for the job and not
allow haste to drive the process," Shelby said, speaking at a
conference sponsored by the Consumer Federation of America.</LD>
<TE>   Shelby's speech was his first public address on financial issues
since last month's elections put him in line to become Banking
Committee chairman.</TE>

<HD>Be a Straight Shooter When One's Needed</HD>
<DH>Sometimes, principles call for a 'High Noon.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>James R. Holmes</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>U.S. popularity around the world has suffered in the last two years
because of our policies, according to a study released this week by
the Pew Research Center for the People &amp; the Press. Though that's not
good news, we should remember that our friends across the Atlantic
have long castigated rightward-tilting American presidents for
pursuing "cowboy diplomacy." This put-down doesn't seem to bother
everyday Americans much. Nor should it: It's a backhanded compliment.</LD>
<LD>   After all, who was the Hollywood cowboy but the individual who --
preferably in concert with a posse, but standing alone if need be --
vanquished the bad guys and imposed the rule of law where anarchy had
reigned?</LD>
<LD>   There's no shame in being lumped with John Wayne or Gary Cooper.
Indeed, Cooper's "High Noon" is probably the most eloquent statement
of the virtues that endeared Hollywood's version of the cowboy to
Americans. If there's a western that can serve as a parable for world
affairs, "High Noon" is it.</LD>
<TE>   The film starts out auspiciously enough. Cooper's character,
Marshal Will Kane, turns in his badge after marrying Amy, a Quaker.
They plan to leave Hadleyville to open a store.</TE>
<TE>   But they get word that the brutish Frank Miller, whom Will had
sent up the river, has been pardoned and is returning on the noon
train in search of vengeance. His cronies are already in town
carousing. And Kane's replacement as marshal isn't due until the
following day -- leaving the town defenseless.</TE>
<TE>   Over the objections of his pacifist wife, Kane insists on staying
to face Miller. The movie recounts his fruitless effort to assemble a
posse able to outgun Miller and his sidekicks.</TE>
<TE>   What do Kane's travails tell us about the cowboy ideal? First,
"peace," if defined simply as the absence of violence, can't be the
paramount goal of society. Knuckling under to the Frank Millers of
the world may constitute a kind of peace, but not one that's worth
having.</TE>
<TE>   This isn't just some simplistic Hollywood view of the world. Its
pedigree goes back at least to St. Augustine, who observed that "even
they who intentionally interrupt the peace in which they are living
have no hatred of peace, but only wish it changed into a peace which
suits them better." The bad guys are delighted with nonviolence when
it means they can run amok.</TE>
<TE>   Given their history, Europeans ought to understand that. Napoleon
and Hitler wanted a peaceful status quo. All their enemies had to do
to achieve peace was to submit to tyranny.</TE>
<TE>   Amy tacitly concedes the bankruptcy of this brand of pacifism
during the gunfight, when, forced to decide between nonviolence and
her husband's life, she shoots one of Miller's henchmen.</TE>
<TE>   Second, although finding allies is desirable, don't bet on outside
help during a confrontation with thugs. Some people will put their
own interests above the greater good, as Kane finds when he bursts
into an assembly to beseech his fellow citizens to join the posse.
Other than a modest gesture of support from one woman, he comes up
empty.</TE>
<TE>   The cowardly townspeople concoct a variety of excuses not to put
themselves in harm's way. One individual claims the unpleasantness
stems entirely from a personal grudge between Kane and Miller.
Another asserts that ordinary citizens have no direct responsibility
for public safety; that's what they pay taxes for. Still another
argues that appeasing Miller is their best option. Kane stands -- and
prevails -- alone.</TE>
<TE>   Any of this sound familiar? These are the kinds of arguments used
to discourage the use of American power in the world. The showdown
with Iraq is only the latest controversy to earn the moniker of
cowboy diplomacy. But the Europeans should think twice before using
the western as a metaphor for world politics; they might not like the
role they're cast in.</TE>
<TE>   In any event, we shouldn't take these transatlantic catcalls too
seriously. The hard work for the American people is to ensure that
their nation is living up to its principles. For a fictional
character, Will Kane isn't half bad at representing those principles.</TE>

<HD>The GOP Revives Social Security Privatization Ploy</HD>
<DH>The Democrats' challenge is to save a system validated by
history.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Robert Kuttner</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The newly elected Republican Congress has not yet been seated, but
one key GOP objective that most Republican candidates ducked during
the campaign is already back in play: Social Security. The White
House has let it be known that privatization could be on the agenda
as early as next year.</LD>
<LD>   Historically, tampering with the popular universal retirement
system has been seen as a political "third rail." So unpopular is the
idea that some Democrats, in a move against the GOP, this year tried
to force a vote on privatization. Republicans blocked it because the
timing was wrong.</LD>
<LD>   Many GOP candidates succeeded in obscuring differences and cast
themselves as stewards of the current system. So you would have to
conclude that in the 2002 election, Republicans got elected not to
privatize Social Security but because they succeeded in persuading
voters that they would do no such thing.</LD>
<TE>   But that was then. The effort for privatization is back; the only
question is when.</TE>
<TE>   Though details have not been formalized, Bush strategists lean
toward a plan that would divert a portion of the 12.4% payroll tax
into optional private accounts. The theory is that younger investors
could put some of that money into the stock market.</TE>
<TE>   Leaving aside the politics, the idea has three big problems.
First, Social Security is in play because it faces a potential
financial shortfall about 40 years from now. Privatization supposedly
is a remedy. The need to fix Social Security's finances is real. But
diverting payroll taxes to pay for private accounts is the opposite
of a solution because it would worsen that shortfall by trillions.</TE>
<TE>   Second, as a consequence of problem No. 1, privatization would
leave less money for Social Security checks, unless the national debt
rose by several trillion dollars. (With the looming deficits
resulting from the Bush tax cuts, there no longer is a big surplus to
apply to Social Security.)</TE>
<TE>   To cover the shortfall caused by the diversion of payroll tax
receipts, privatization plans reduce the conventional Social Security
checks. The private accounts supposedly would make up for the loss.</TE>
<TE>   Some versions would add a "means test," which would require
pensioners to demonstrate poverty before they could draw Social
Security checks. As with welfare, retirees would have to deplete
assets to make themselves poor enough to qualify.</TE>
<TE>   (The genius of the current system is that Social Security is
earned, and rich, middle class and poor alike are entitled to checks
based on their lifetime income and taxes paid.)</TE>
<TE>   The third problem is that Social Security and private accounts are
simply not comparable. By design, Social Security is social
insurance. No matter how long you live, you cannot outlive it, and
the checks are guaranteed. With private accounts, once the money is
used up, it's gone. And bad investment luck or bad timing relative to
stock market performance can leave a retiree with much reduced
income. (Ask an Enron retiree.)</TE>
<TE>   President Bush, in carefully chosen language, has promised that no
retiree would lose any benefits because of changes in the Social
Security system. But many younger Americans, far from retirement,
would find themselves shortchanged by privatization.</TE>
<TE>   The retirement system, such as it is, combines several elements:
personal savings, private pension or 401(k) plans, assets from the
sale of a house and Social Security. Social Security remains the one
part that is reliable. Without it, half of the nation's seniors would
be living in poverty.</TE>
<TE>   In the 2002 election, Republicans largely succeeded in blurring
differences on Social Security. But the matter will eventually come
before Congress. And then the blurring ends.</TE>
<TE>   Bush will try hard to get some Democrats to defect. Polling data
suggest that some younger voters want those payroll tax receipts, to

<TE>   The challenge for Democrats is to not abandon Social Security but
to instead strengthen the system's finances and extend social
insurance, including health insurance, to younger families.</TE>
<TE>   Despite a lot of nonsense about outmoded Depression-era programs,
looming financial disaster and charges of demagoguery, social
insurance is the Democrats' winning card.</TE>

<HD>Reform Crashes Against Church's Structure</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CRISPIN SARTWELL</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Priestly abuses are entailed by the very idea of the Roman Catholic
Church and will continue as long as it does.</LD>
<LD>   When Martin Luther broke with the church in the 16th century, he
did it for many reasons, but one above all: He didn't want anything
coming between him and God. He was disgusted by the idea that he
could know God -- and that God could know him -- only through a
bureaucracy. And so he objected especially to every aspect of
Catholicism that tended toward a separation of the worshiper from
God.</LD>
<LD>   He translated the Bible into German, so that his parishioners
could understand it. He criticized much of the mumbo-jumbo
surrounding the sacraments and tried to make them simple and
meaningful to the people who performed them.</LD>
<TE>   The deepest objection of Luther and the reformers who followed was
to "priestcraft": the notion, which is fundamental to Catholicism,
that one's access to God comes through his representatives on Earth
in the form of Roman Catholic priests. Luther argued for "the
priesthood of all believers," in an attempt to make people see that
everyone was revealed directly to God, and God to everyone.</TE>
<TE>   Many Catholics think that the problem of abuse can be solved by
internal reform of the church. But the idea that the institutions of
the church could be made transparent and accountable is incompatible
with the basic structure of Catholicism, which is a hierarchy -- a
pantheon of intercessors, from priests to saints -- empowered by God
to interpret his will to the world.</TE>
<TE>   As we peep ever further into the private lives of priests, the
scene gets ever more lurid. In the latest parting of the curtain --
via thousands of personnel records released by the Boston Archdiocese
-- we find, for example, that Father Robert Meffan allegedly
convinced teenage aspiring nuns to have sex with him by claiming to
be God's representative and that he was the path of their access to
the deity.</TE>
<TE>   But in fact, the recent abuses of power in the Catholic Church are
less shocking than they are typical. Compared with the extent of the
corruption and concupiscence displayed by the church in history, the
current transgressions are mild.</TE>
<TE>   Much of the incredible wealth of the church, for example, was
derived from the sale of indulgences -- forgiveness in exchange for
cash, a kind of pimping for God. The intrigues -- sexual and
otherwise -- of the papacy have filled volumes.</TE>
<TE>   The authority of the Catholic Church, on its own account, is
mystical, God-given and total. Such an institution cannot be made
democratic or responsive.</TE>
<TE>   If we know anything, it is that human beings abuse power. Power
doesn't corrupt, but corrupt people wield power corruptly.</TE>
<TE>   The civil bureaucracy may claim jurisdiction over your money and
your behavior but the religious bureaucracy claims jurisdiction over
your conscience. Thus the abuse to which it gives rise is of the most
intimate and destructive variety: It is a destruction of inner
autonomy, an attempt to control or destroy not what one does but what
one is.</TE>
<TE>   Let me issue a sincere disclaimer: The Catholic Church has done
and is doing much good in the world.</TE>
<TE>   However, if you authorize a group of people to supervise your
conscience and your relationship to God, you are likely to find that
you have created a brotherhood of monsters.</TE>

<HD>Facing Race, Rape and Outrage</HD>
<DH>Central Park assault was only one of the cases caught by
the whirlwind.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jim Sleeper</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Since the international outcry against false charges that the black
"Scottsboro Boys" had raped a white woman in the South in 1931,
liberals, at least, have been reluctant to acknowledge the ugly
entanglement of race and rape in our national experience.</LD>
<LD>   America's original racial sin was a long trail of rapes of black
women by white men, especially slave masters. Many African Americans'
"white blood" and lighter skins marked these violations and other
illicit intimacies, some of them gentler, perhaps, but most of them
palpably coerced in the shadow of white omnipotence.</LD>
<LD>   The Central Park jogger trial of 1989, in which five black and
Latino teenagers were convicted of assaulting and raping a young,
white investment banker, seemed to turn the tables on Scottsboro:
This time, the "black" boys were indeed guilty, everyone agreed, with
liberals and feminists at the head of that consensus.</LD>
<TE>   Now comes Manhattan Dist. Atty. Robert Morgenthau's recommendation
that the teens' convictions be vacated. Morgenthau had to respond
after Matias Reyes, an imprisoned serial rapist who had never been
charged or convicted in the jogger case, came forward this year and
established that it was he who raped her that night in 1989.</TE>
<TE>   Jailhouse confessions are rightly suspect, and Reyes' claim that
he has seen Jesus rather than death threats or dollar signs is far
from being confirmed. But his declaration that he was the only rapist
-- confirmed by DNA testing -- does invalidate two juries' findings
that the five teens caught "wilding" in Central Park were guilty
beyond a reasonable doubt of raping the jogger.</TE>
<TE>   But in 1989, the teens' case seemed a watershed, a shift toward
candor long missing in racial discourse. It was Richard Wright in the
1930s who first dared to confront the issue with his vivid fictional
depiction of Bigger Thomas' rape of a white woman in "Native Son," a
portrait that plumbed a deep black impulse to revenge.</TE>
<TE>   In the 1960s, Eldridge Cleaver's "Soul on Ice" brandished his
claim to have raped a white woman as a kind of poetic justice against
whites' continuing economic and psychological as well as physical
violation of blacks. He excited a frisson of white-radical approval
-- this at a time when a prominent New Leftist had declared that "the
best position of women in the movement is prone."</TE>
<TE>   Twenty years later, the Tawana Brawley psychodrama in the late
1980s again reversed and recalled the old Scottsboro tactics by
falsely accusing whites of raping blacks, even reinforcing the "slave
master" archetype by singling out a white law enforcement official.</TE>
<TE>   Then, new facts and an aroused feminism entered the turmoil. Not
only did the falsity of Brawley's charges chill the sympathetic
outrage she'd first aroused against sexism and racism, it drew
attention to data from the federal Bureau of Criminal Justice
Statistics that showed the number of reported rapes of black women by
white men to be only one-fifth that of reported rapes of white women
by blacks. Even invidious racial stereotyping by white victims who
"misremember" their assailants' color -- or who invent a black
assailant, as Boston's Charles Stuart infamously did when he falsely
charged that a black had murdered his wife -- couldn't explain so
wide a discrepancy.</TE>
<TE>   No wonder, then, that two years later the Central Park jogger case
unleashed a torrent of feminist rage that had been building after the
Brawley hoax. It got even more torrential when the Rev. Al Sharpton
brought Brawley to the steps of the jogger trial courthouse to shake
hands with the defendants as fellow minority members who had been
abused by the system, as she claimed to have been. That only deepened
anger against the defendants themselves, given their confessions of
guilt, videotaped in the presence of their parents or other
relatives, without evidence of police coercion.</TE>
<TE>   For the first time, moreover, the prosecutor heading the Manhattan
district attorney's sex-crimes unit was a woman, Linda Fairstein, who
still staunchly defends the convictions. No longer, it seemed, could
the nightmare of white rape of blacks be used in liberal public
discourse to excuse the nightmare of black-on-white rape and racial
revenge. Nor did justice in the first sense need to preclude justice
in the second.</TE>
<TE>   If New Yorkers learned this positively in the jogger-trial
convictions, the nation would learn it negatively in the O.J. Simpson
criminal acquittal, whose outcome eerily paralleled the Scottsboro
days, when white juries acquitted white killers of blacks.</TE>
<TE>   The glory of the American criminal justice system is supposed to
be that it pursues and establishes legal, constitutional truth
precisely in the face of, and often despite, torrential public rages
and cultural or ideological mood swings. We can only hope that the
pursuit will now be somewhat chastened and less hobbled by both
racist and "anti-racist" taboos.</TE>

<HD>At Play With Prison Guards</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the final days before state lawmakers confront the state's
staggering debt, three of the Legislature's four top leaders are
among several elected officials being wined and dined by the
well-heeled union representing California's prison guards at a Maui
beach resort where the cobalt Pacific washes onto Kaanapali Beach.</LD>
<LD>   Assembly Speaker Herb Wesson (D-Culver City), Assembly Republican
leader Dave Cox of Fair Oaks and Senate Republican leader Jim Brulte
of Rancho Cucamonga insist that their attendance at the California
Correctional Peace Officers Assn. event will not influence their
decisions at next week's special legislative session on slashing the
state's multibillion-dollar deficit. Surely, fond memories of mai
tais at the hotel's 142-yard freshwater swimming pool will not lead
them to ignore fiscal discipline.</LD>
<LD>   Everyone should share in the pain of draconian budget cuts. That
includes not only public school teachers, uninsured children and
nurses but prison guards, who won an astonishing 37% raise last year
after the union, in the 2001-02 campaign finance cycle, gave $15,000
to Wesson, $6,000 to Brulte and $2,000 to Cox. The legislators say
they are footing their own air fare and hotel bills -- most likely
out of their campaign funds, which is legal in California.</LD>
<TE>   Cox's spokesman, Peter DeMarco, says his boss wasn't going for the
island flavors at the Keka'a Terrace or the white and gold beaches
but rather to "have discussions with his constituencies .... If they
had held it in Sacramento, he'd have gone to Sacramento," DeMarco
said.</TE>
<TE>   That's reassuring. After all, no amount of Hawaiian mahalo, or
gratitude, should deter legislators from rethinking the state's
disastrously inefficient, $900-million-a-year parole system, which
returns about 90,000 parolees to prison each year, only to see most
of them re-offend, usually for technical violations like flunking a
drug test or blowing off an interview with their parole officer.</TE>
<TE>   The parole system is the engine of the state's prison industry,
generating jobs for guards. Nationally, only 35% of people coming
into state prisons are parole violators. In California, 70% of all
admissions to state prison are for parole violations.</TE>
<TE>   The grim realities of parole might seem a world away from the
lava-rock waterways, lilting slack-key guitars and garden paths at
the Sheraton Maui resort. Even so, Wesson, Cox and Brulte should down
a cup of souvenir Kona coffee Monday morning and confront those
realities responsibly. As for the guards union, why not hold next
year's conference in Bakersfield?</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>When Los Angeles Unified School District Supt. Roy Romer announced
Wednesday that the already problem-plagued Belmont Learning Complex
sits atop an earthquake fault of unknown danger, reaction split
predictably. One side jeered, "I told you so." The other cried
"betrayal." It will be hard to make a sensible decision amid the din.</LD>
<LD>   The school board voted to mothball the project two years ago after
discovering that the site lay on part of an old oil field that leaked
toxic hydrogen sulfide gas and explosive methane gas. The
$175-million structure became a symbol of LAUSD incompetence: The
district had not done adequate environmental tests when the site was
purchased.</LD>
<LD>   But what is a white elephant to some is a symbol of bad faith to
residents of the inner-city neighborhoods that the school was
intended to serve. The old Belmont High School, built to accommodate
3,300 students, today overflows with more than 5,000, and an
additional 2,400 are bused to schools outside the neighborhood. Many
parents reject the distinction that although much of downtown is
built over the same oil field and quake zone, California sets higher
safety standards for schools than for other buildings. After all,
they put their children on buses -- and at risk of traffic accidents
-- for hours a day.</LD>
<TE>   Romer, who once promised to make the school safe, now acknowledges
that he cannot, as it is presently configured. Mitigating the buildup
of gases was challenge enough without the earthquake fault. At least
two buildings must not be used for a school for reasons of state law
and because no one should have to shoulder that kind of risk for a
school full of children.</TE>
<TE>   Romer should also rule out the first of three options he has
suggested, which is to tear down the buildings directly straddling
the fault but use the rest of the complex. It doesn't make sense to
spend so much money seismically retrofitting and extensively
reconfiguring those buildings when it would be less expensive to
start from scratch on another part of the site.</TE>
<TE>   The second option calls for just that, building a smaller school
on a 12-acre portion of the site that geologists deemed free of
earthquake faults.</TE>
<TE>   The third option is to search for another site.</TE>
<TE>   Romer promised the school board a quick report on the options. It
also should be thorough. No one wants more surprises after
construction gets underway.</TE>
<TE>   The district needs to put behind it the tattered, half-finished
buildings that squat on the site, signaling failure. They may find
another use. They might be sold; they might even be torn down.</TE>
<TE>   By building anew, either on the 12 acres at the Belmont site or
elsewhere, the district would get rid of its personal albatross. By
focusing its considerable resources on this job before others, it
would finally keep its promise to a neglected community.</TE>

<HD>An Industry in Turbulence</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Frank Borman, who presided over Eastern Airlines just before its
turbulent descent into bankruptcy during the early 1990s, declared
that "capitalism without bankruptcy is like Christianity without
hell."</LD>
<LD>   United Airlines seems poised to learn whether an imminent stop in
Bankruptcy Court will lead to redemption or simply more pain.
Considering the decade of crippling mutual distrust between airline
management and employees, the bets can hardly be more than even.</LD>
<LD>   United's financial woes won't immediately disrupt travel, but they
will add to the uncertainties facing travelers dependent on an
airline industry awash in red ink, a long-troubled passenger rail
system and a relatively small interstate bus system that's struggling
for consistent profits.</LD>
<TE>   At least Bankruptcy Court is where United belongs, joining US
Airways, which has been operating under bankruptcy protections since
August. Chicago-based United's financial problems existed well before
the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks buffeted an already shaky airline
industry.</TE>
<TE>   United's management and powerful unions, whose members control 55%
of the parent company's stock, must use the court's shelter to bridge
their differences or risk slipping into a war of attrition like that
which led to Eastern's demise.</TE>
<TE>   Competitors might benefit from snapping up potentially lucrative
routes that United could be forced to abandon. But the industry lost
a cumulative $7 billion in 2001 and will have lost another $7 billion
this year. It can't afford to take comfort in United's plight.
American Airlines continues to lay off employees, and Delta Air Lines
is scrambling to create a low-cost alternative to combat such
fast-growing carriers as Southwest Airlines and JetBlue Airways.</TE>
<TE>   The bankruptcy of two major airlines, the industry's increased
security costs after Sept. 11 and the stalled economy are only the
latest twists in the industry's struggle since being deregulated in
1978.</TE>
<TE>   By rejecting United's application for a $1.8-billion federally
backed loan, the Bush administration signaled that it intends to
continue letting the market sort out the airline industry's
considerable troubles. The government can't, however, let the market
ensure that cash-strapped operators don't cut corners and put
passengers in danger.</TE>
<TE>   United (if it survives) and US Airways will continue to shed
unprofitable routes and leave more small cities without air service.
Congress is threatening to drop Amtrak's money-losing interstate
lines, and long-distance bus service remains weak.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration's hands-off transportation policy could
have repercussions on an economy that depends on a reliable
nationwide transportation system. Those ramifications need serious
study -- free market or not.</TE>

<LD>Re "Rattling 'Doors of Hell' in Mideast," Commentary, Dec. 3:
Bouthaina Shaaban is yet another commentator bewailing Arab
victimization and blaming the West for the ills of the region. From
this crabbed perspective, Arabs are never at fault.</LD>
<LD>   Perhaps Shaaban should clean Syria's house first by telling
President Bashar Assad to abdicate his dictatorship, i.e., rule by
"military might." And maybe getting rid of Saddam Hussein won't open
the "doors of hell" but the "doors of freedom" in Syria and Saudi
Arabia as well as Iraq.</LD>

<TE>   I take issue with Shaaban's assertion that only the U.S. can
broker peace in the Mideast. Far from it; the U.S. is too biased in
favor of Israel to be able to act as a peace broker. The internal
politics of the U.S. and the strong influence of the Israeli and
Christian right lobbies on Congress make it impossible for any U.S.
administration to take any position unfavorable to Israel, something
that is essential for peace.</TE>
<TE>   One has only to look to President Bush's call for Israeli
withdrawal from the occupied territories a few months back to realize
the clout of the Israeli lobby in the U.S. Not only did Bush have to
recant his demand but he was soon forced to adopt Prime Minister
Ariel Sharon's demand for change in Palestinian leadership.
Palestinians have to stop hoping that the U.S. will act as an
impartial party and impose a solution on Israel. They should look for
an alternative.</TE>

<LD>In "Iraq Falling Short, Bush Says" (Dec. 3), Vice President Dick
Cheney states: "The president knows that wars are never won on the
defensive. In the fight against global terror, we must take the
battle to the enemy and, where necessary, preempt serious threats
before they materialize against our country."</LD>
<LD>   What in heaven's name is that supposed to mean? That the two world
wars of the 20th century were won because we struck first? This
administration depends upon a lack of historical memory when it makes
statements like this, hoping that simply saying them will make them
true. These statements are false and are served up to justify an
already-decided course of action against Iraq.</LD>

<LD>Re "More Tax Cuts on Bush Agenda," Dec. 1: It seems that President
Bush can't get his stories straight. From one side of his mouth he
says there's enough money to give more tax breaks to the richest in
the nation. Yet, speaking from the other side, he's cutting the pay
raises of federal employees because there's not enough money. Well,
Mr. Bush, you had better take care of your wealthy friends while you
can because, I guarantee you, federal employees and retirees will
remember this slight in 2004, and you'll end up just like your old
man, a one-term president.</LD>

<HD>Law Dean's Resignation a Great Loss for Boalt</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As a recent Boalt alum, I am saddened to learn of John Dwyer's
resignation, but also angered at his portrayal in the media ("Law
Dean Quits Over Accusation," Nov. 28). As I received a joint degree,
I was at Boalt for four years and thus knew Dwyer very well. Though
some students were concerned that he would not show a commitment to
diversity, Dwyer absolutely put those fears to rest. He doubled the
number of nonwhite students at Boalt, through expanded recruitment
programs and fund-raising efforts. He also met regularly with the
student coalition for diversity. He greatly increased funding to the
clinical programs -- a crucial resource for public-interest students.</LD>
<LD>   Dwyer's overall commitment to Boalt was astounding. His office
lights could be seen burning from early in the morning to 10 or 11 at
night many days of the week. On a more personal note, Dwyer was a
wonderful teacher and mentor to me as I pursued a nontraditional,
public-interest legal career. By his own example as well as his
encouragement, he has pushed many young lawyers to be honest,
hard-working professionals with integrity. It will be a tragedy if
Dwyer's commitment to Boalt is eclipsed by his resignation.</LD>

<TE>   What a world! Regarding these charges of sexual harassment: They
both were drunk as skunks, and it's all his fault. Would the female
professors -- so horrified by the story -- support this 27-year-old
claimant so vociferously if the dean had been a woman? Not likely!
That's the real discrimination.</TE>

<LD>Less than a month after the lowest voter turnout in history, John
Balzar sees an energized electorate committing itself to one of the
two major parties (Commentary, Dec. 4). Is he blind? In California,
over 751,000 voted for third parties in the recent election, even
though they knew their candidate wouldn't win. As long as differences
between the two parties remain imperceptible, as long as electoral
reforms such as proportional representation and instant runoff voting
remain distant, voter turnout will remain low.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Many thanks for your Dec. 1 editorial on Samuel Clemens, "Like His
River, He Rolls On." Having been born in Hannibal, Mo., and having
had the enjoyable experience of attending school with Clemens'
great-grandnieces in St. Louis, I was immersed in Clemens lore long
before I became an early American literature major at Cal. He has
always been a favorite of mine and is one that I have been asked to
explain in countless English classes for young freshmen and
sophomores trying to find relevancy in "Huck Finn" for the youth of
today. (As our first "flower child," Huck is also a favorite of
mine.) The tremendous insight, albeit through wry humor, that Mark
Twain has left for all generations to read, and with which to relate,
can never be understated.</LD>

<TE>   I am a student at Cal State Northridge. As I high school student,
I read Twain's books about Huck Finn, Tom Sawyer and Becky Thatcher.
Many students did not want to read them because of certain language
used in the books. I thought his books were great. They were real. In
some schools across the nation they have been banned. It is sad that
great works of art have been, and will be, lost to political
correctness. We should read his works within the context in which
they were written. Twain did say everything like it was.</TE>
<TE>   People have a hard time reading things that bluntly state the
facts. They tend to like euphemisms. I found this editorial
interesting, and I think more people should read Twain's works
because he truly revolutionized American literature.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Retired Schoolteachers Enjoy Generous Benefits," letter, Dec. 4:
I retired from full-time teaching in 1996 with over 30 years of
teaching experience. My retirement check each month is considerably
less than 70% of my highest year's earnings. In fact, it is less than
50% of my final year's salary. I supplement that by working as a
substitute at substantially less per day than I made as a full-time
teacher.</LD>
<LD>   My "attractive" health benefits (paid for by the district from
which I retired) do not include either dental or vision coverage. And
that monthly payment for insurance stops the day I turn 65. I wonder
if elected officials would be happy with that kind of retirement
package if they had put in 30-plus years on the job. In addition, if
my husband dies before I do, will I get any Social Security benefits
from all the years that he worked and earned credits? Sorry, but this
letter's generalizations about retired teachers were too sweeping. I
know they don't apply to me.</LD>

<HD>Search for the Truth About Sept. 11 Gets Kiss of Death</HD>

<LD>In "Want a Cover-Up Expert? Kissinger's Your Man" (Commentary, Dec.
3), Robert Scheer states, "The truth about Sept. 11 might dampen
[President] Bush's exploitation of tragedy to draw attention from a
sagging economy, a down stock market and stunning financial scandals
that began with the downfall of Bush's close buddies at Enron."</LD>
<LD>   The Dow Jones industrials last week posted their eighth straight
weekly gain, the biggest two-month advance in more than 15 years. An
economy that began its decline in the Clinton administration is now
rebounding strongly under the Bush administration, including a
booming home real estate market. And lest Scheer forget, the
"stunning financial scandals" were being orchestrated during the
Clinton years.</LD>
<LD>   Had Scheer's idol, former President Clinton, really been doing the
work of the American people instead of playing with Monica, Sept. 11
might never have happened, and Henry Kissinger would never have been
a footnote in this tragic history.</LD>
<TE>   Robert L. Rosebrock</TE>
<TE>   Brentwood</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Of course, Scheer is right on target. Like so much of what has
been going on with our present administration, if it wasn't so
serious it would be comical. Kissinger to head a commission looking
into the intelligence failures that led to 9/11? If Bush had been
around at the time, would he have appointed Jesse James to look into
train robberies? How about Al Capone investigating the mob? So now we
have the unwholesome spectacle of Kissinger, with a long and
documented record of lying to the Congress, the media and the public
-- a man sought by various countries around the globe for his
participation in crimes against humanity -- being appointed by our
president to head a commission into the overwhelming "failures of
intelligence" that led to the catastrophe of 9/11. Bush, who has been
resisting any real investigation into these events, can rest assured
with the appointment of Kissinger that he will get his wish.</TE>
<TE>   But shouldn't we all be outraged by the haughty slap in the face
Bush has inflicted on the American public, and even worse, the total
lack of elemental decency toward the families of the victims of 9/11?</TE>

<LD>Re "A Deficit of Experience," editorial, Dec. 2: The Legislature has
had its first meeting and has sworn in 39 new members. Of the 40
state senators and 80 Assembly members, the 39 amount to about
one-third of the Legislature. In view of the many serious problems
facing the state, it should be a matter of some concern that so many
of our legislators are rookies. Term limits may sound like a good
idea, but perhaps it's time to rethink that measure. After all, if a
legislator isn't doing a good job, we should be able to vote him or
her out of office instead of forcing capable people out because of a
term limit.</LD>

<HD>Myron Kahn, 85; His Polarizing Light Panels Cut Glare in
Offices</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Myrna Oliver</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Myron Kahn, inventor of polarizing ceiling light panels that greatly
reduce glare in offices, schools and libraries, and which eventually
became the darling of economists, ergonomists and conservationists,
has died. He was 85.</LD>
<LD>   Kahn, founder of what became Polarized Corp. of America, died Nov.
19 in St. John's Hospital in Santa Monica of heart failure, said his
son, attorney Robert A. Kahn.</LD>
<LD>   A native New Yorker who went to work in his teens, earned a high
school diploma at night school and enlisted in the Army Air Forces
during World War II, Kahn came to Southern California after the war
with an idea.</LD>
<TE>   Inspired by a relative who had created an early version of the
polarized lenses used in sunglasses, Kahn developed (and in the 1960s
patented) light-polarizing plastic ceiling panels to cut glare from
fluorescent light tubes.</TE>
<TE>   In 1947 he established Polarized Illumination Inc., which later
used the names Polarized Lighting International and Polarized Corp.
of America, based in Tarzana.</TE>
<TE>   White light, he said, is created by horizontal and vertical waves.
Kahn's desk-sized laminated ceiling panels convert the horizontal
light vibrations -- the ones that ricochet off computer screens and
other surfaces to create glare -- into vertical rays, more easily
absorbed by objects and reflected back to the eye.</TE>
<TE>   With glare reduced, the eye is able to see richer colors, greater
depth and texture and other details, sharpening overall vision.</TE>
<TE>   Kahn's ceiling panels were used widely in commercial buildings
constructed in the 1950s and 1960s and showcased prominently when
Disneyland opened in 1955 at the now-removed Monsanto House of the
Future in Tomorrowland.</TE>
<TE>   But Kahn's invention came into its own in the 1970s when officials
and consumers became increasingly concerned about dwindling oil and
natural gas supplies. Kahn demonstrated that his panels could reduce
electricity costs -- by cutting the number of fluorescent bulbs
needed to provide the same or better visibility -- by up to one-third
or even one-half and lower air-conditioning bills by a fourth.
Ergonomists found that because of improved visual acuity when the
panels were placed between lightbulbs and workers, computer users'
headaches and eye fatigue also decreased markedly.</TE>
<TE>   About 1976, the Los Angeles Department of Water and Power
retrofitted its headquarters atop Bunker Hill downtown with 17,000 of
Kahn's panels and immediately was able to remove 40% of its
lightbulbs and reduce its energy costs by 22%.</TE>
<TE>   Southern California Edison began offering rebates up to $50,000
per facility to businesses and government agencies that used the
panels. As computers became ubiquitous in offices around the world,
Suffolk County, N.Y., passed the first law requiring the panels to be
placed in ceilings above all its video display terminals.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, builders elsewhere -- Europe, South Africa,
Australia -- were quicker to order Kahn's panels than any contractors
in the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   Kahn blamed American energy companies and manufacturers of
air-conditioning and lighting equipment for protecting their profits
over consumer efficiency, testifying before the California Energy
Commission in 1986: "Hundreds of millions of dollars are still being
wasted on inefficient lighting techniques, and the resulting higher
energy costs serve only the interests of the utility, lamp and
air-conditioning industries."</TE>
<TE>   The inventor and sole manufacturer of the polarizing panels even
sued to force recognition of his invention by the Illuminating
Engineering Society, which for decades set lighting standards
according to foot-candles or the amount of light created, rather than
visual acuity provided. Kahn finally won that recognition for his
panels' money- and energy-saving potential, his son said, only five
years ago.</TE>
<TE>   The more than 4,000 buildings around the world employing the
polarizing ceiling panels include the United Nations Plaza Building
in New York City and sections of the Library of Congress in
Washington.</TE>
<TE>   Kahn was invited to lecture about his invention in Australia,
Japan, Israel, Canada and several countries in South America, South
Africa and Europe.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to his son of Hidden Hills, Kahn is survived by his
wife, Bea of Tarzana; his daughter, Fran Rice of Tarzana; and four
grandchildren.</TE>
<TE>   The family has asked that any memorial donations be made to one of
these research and treatment charities: the Greater Los Angeles
Chapter of the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society, the American Cancer
Society or the American Heart Assn.</TE>

<HD>Philip Meggs, 60; Graphic Design Guru</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Myrna Oliver</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Philip B. Meggs, who wrote the first definitive history of graphic
and advertising design from the beginning of the written language
through the printing press and on to the computer, has died. He was
60.</LD>
<LD>   Meggs died of leukemia Nov. 24 in Richmond, Va.</LD>
<LD>   A graphic designer for commercial industry and then a college
instructor and dean, Meggs said he wrote because of his need to give
his students a foundation for all that had gone before. The result
was "A History of Graphic Design," published in 1983 and still the
definitive book on the subject.</LD>
<TE>   Meggs wrote about a dozen other books and about 150 articles and
papers on design and typography.</TE>
<TE>   Since 1993, he had served on the U.S. Postal Service's Citizen
Stamp Advisory Committee. In 1996, he was credited with bringing
about the selection of the Christmas stamp featuring Madonna and
Child from a 1712 oil painting "The Adoration of the Shepherds" in
the Virginia Museum of Fine Arts. To make the selection work, Meggs
countered committee opposition by projecting the painting on a wall
and cropping it carefully to emphasize the two small figures.</TE>
<TE>   Meggs also attracted public attention for his criticism of the
recent redesign of U.S. currency. "The new bills are atrocious: 1928
designs based on 19th century models," he said in 1998 as the bills
emerged with enlarged portraits of presidents and denomination
numbers. "They've shown a timid slavery to tradition.... They missed
an opportunity to take a 120-year leap forward."</TE>
<TE>   After the first redesigned bill -- the $100 with Benjamin Franklin
-- appeared in 1996, Meggs was so incensed that he assigned his
Virginia Commonwealth University design students to come up with
their own versions of a $1 bill. Heeding Meggs' warning that "we will
enter the 21st century with 19th century money in our pockets," they
submitted designs incorporating elements ranging from colorful
abstract art to bald eagles, from Native Americans to cartoon figures
such as Captain America.</TE>
<TE>   The winner, chosen by student vote, was a five-color bill with
peace doves sketched in flight and computer-generated text. Several
of the student designs were presented to -- and ignored by -- the
Treasury Department.</TE>
<TE>   Meggs, a native of Newberry, S.C., attended the University of
South Carolina and then earned his bachelor's and master's of fine
arts degrees at what is now Virginia Commonwealth University in
Richmond.</TE>
<TE>   After working for Reynolds Aluminum and A.H. Robins
Pharmaceuticals as a graphic designer and art director, he began
teaching at his alma mater in 1968. He was dean of its department of
communication arts and design from 1974 to 1987. He was awarded a
National Endowment of the Arts grant, which allowed him to lecture at
several universities.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this year, Meggs selected the graphics for a well-received
exhibition, "U.S. Design 1975-2000," organized by the Denver Art
Museum and also shown in Miami, New York and Memphis. Last month, he
was inducted into the Art Directors Hall of Fame at ceremonies in New
York.</TE>
<TE>   Meggs' own graphic design, teaching and writing were inextricably
intertwined.</TE>
<TE>   "My involvement in writing is an extension of my activity as a
graphic designer and design educator," he told the anthology
Contemporary Authors. "My study of design history led to the
development of a university course in the history of visual
communications and graphic design. My research was compiled into the
book 'A History of Graphic Design.' "</TE>
<TE>   The book, he explained, "traces man's visual communications from
early writing to contemporary graphic design. The invention of the
alphabet, the origin of printing, Renaissance book design, Victorian
and Art Nouveau graphics of the industrial revolution, and the
explosion of graphic communications on the 20th century --
propaganda, advertising, Art Deco and the impact of modern art."</TE>
<TE>   He is survived by his wife of 38 years, Libby; a son, Andrew of
Tustin; a daughter, Elizabeth of Richmond; his parents; two brothers;
and a sister.</TE>

<HD>Law Upheld on Police Complaints</HD>
<DH>Constitution doesn't protect knowingly false statements or
those made with reckless disregard for the truth, state high court
rules.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Eric Malnic and Tracy Wilson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The California Supreme Court on Thursday unanimously upheld a state
law making it a misdemeanor to knowingly file a false allegation of
misconduct against a police officer.</LD>
<LD>   The court said that although criticism of government officials "is
among the quintessential rights Americans enjoy under the 1st
Amendment ... a knowingly false statement and a statement made with
reckless disregard for truth do not enjoy constitutional protection."</LD>
<LD>   The court noted that the 1995 law was written in the aftermath of
the March 1991 beating of motorist Rodney G. King by Los Angeles
police officers.</LD>
<TE>   "Law enforcement agencies throughout the state revised their
citizen complaint procedures to promote greater accountability on the
part of their line officers," the court said, quoting testimony
before an Assembly committee.</TE>
<TE>   "A glaringly negative side effect [was] the willingness of many of
our less ethical citizens to maliciously file false allegations of
misconduct against officers," the court continued. "Against this
backdrop, the Legislature enacted section 148.6."</TE>
<TE>   Thursday's Supreme Court ruling stemmed from the 1998 convictions
of Oxnard residents Shaun Stainstreet and Barbara Atkinson for filing
a false accusation that an Oxnard police officer exposed himself to
about 50 teenagers at a Police Athletics League awards banquet.</TE>
<TE>   When the Police Department was unable to corroborate the
allegations, Ventura County prosecutors charged the couple.
Stainstreet and Atkinson were convicted and sentenced to 90 days in
jail and three years' probation.</TE>
<TE>   They were released after serving 50 days.</TE>
<TE>   Stainstreet and Atkinson filed an appeal, saying that their
accusations had been true. In October 2001, the 2nd District Court of
Appeal overturned their misdemeanor convictions.</TE>
<TE>   The appellate court accepted the evidence that the couple had
filed a false accusation, but ruled that the law violated the 1st
Amendment.</TE>
<TE>   Two months ago, the state Supreme Court began reviewing the
appellate ruling.</TE>
<TE>   The American Civil Liberties Union, arguing on behalf of the
couple, contended that criminalizing speech against police, but not
against other public officials, was unconstitutional because it
singled out officers.</TE>
<TE>   The law could deter legitimate complaints out of fears of
prosecution, the ACLU said.</TE>
<TE>   The Ventura County district attorney's office countered that
without the law, police officers would have no protection against
false allegations of misconduct.</TE>
<TE>   In the ruling handed down Thursday, the Supreme Court concluded
that the law is constitutional on its face.</TE>
<TE>   "Section 148.6 proscribes only constitutionally unprotected speech
-- knowingly false statements of fact," the court said. "Moreover, it
does not apply to all accusations of misconduct against police
officers but only to complaints filed with a law enforcement agency
in a way that legally obligates the agency to investigate the
complaint.</TE>
<TE>   "The circumstance that it covers only those persons -- peace
officers -- who will be the subject of mandatory investigation does
not render it unconstitutional," the court said.</TE>
<TE>   Deputy Dist. Atty. Michael D. Schwartz, who prosecuted Stainstreet
and Atkinson, said he was pleased with the court's decision.</TE>
<TE>   "It was the right ruling," he said. "On the common-sense level,
the Constitution should not protect people who are lying."</TE>
<TE>   ACLU attorney Peter Eliasberg expressed disappointment.</TE>
<TE>   "There are lots of federal court rulings that disagree with this
state court ruling on this critical 1st Amendment issue," Eliasberg
said.</TE>
<TE>   Atkinson stood behind her allegations Thursday, contending that
police covered up evidence that would have supported them.</TE>
<TE>   She said she will try to take the case before the U.S. Supreme
Court.</TE>
<TE>   The ruling was the second this week by a San Francisco-based
appellate court giving protection to police officers from false
statements by citizens.</TE>
<TE>   On Tuesday, the U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that a
Beverly Hills police officer's $10-million slander suit against
singer George Michael can move ahead, saying that statements made by
Michael about the circumstances of his 1998 arrest on charges of
exposing himself should be heard by a jury.</TE>
<TE>   In a sharp dissent, Judge Stephen Reinhardt said the decision
gives police the opportunity to file a suit almost any time they are
accused of wrongdoing.</TE>

<HD>Killing of Teen Yields 4 Arrests</HD>
<DH>Three men and a woman are charged in a shooting last month.
It was one of 16 South L.A. homicides in a week.</DH>

<LD>Three men and a woman have been charged with murdering 17-year-old
Ernest Williams last month, one of a spate of 16 killings within a
week in South Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   Police said they aren't certain whether the suspects are gang
members, but the killing was the 111th this year in the Los Angeles
Police Department's 77th Street Division, more than a sixth of the
total citywide.</LD>
<LD>   The suspects -- Theresa Madlock, 24; Leonard Hampton, 31; Donell
Dwayne Smith, 20; and Raymond Morgan, 26; all of the Los Angeles area
-- are also accused of attempting to murder a 21-year-old friend of
Williams.</LD>
<TE>   Police say that on Nov. 19, Williams had just gotten off a bus
from school and was talking with the friend near 83rd Street and
Western Avenue when the killers shot him and fired at, but missed,
the friend.</TE>
<TE>   Madlock, Hampton and Smith, all accused of firing handguns, are
being held in lieu of $3.2-million bail. Bail for Morgan, who was not
armed, is $2 million.</TE>
<TE>   Madlock and Hampton are also accused of possessing marijuana for
sale.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles Police Det. Teddy Hammond said commercial quantities
of the drug were seized when the two were arrested, shortly after the
Williams shooting, at the site of another shooting eight blocks away.
Police said the suspects may have been the intended victims of that
second shooting.</TE>
<TE>   Williams' father, Robert, an insurance agent, has said he believes
that whoever killed his son was targeting the friend, and that his
son was shot only because he happened to be there.</TE>
<TE>   Hammond said Thursday that the police investigation continues.</TE>

<HD>School District Studying Geology Lesson</HD>
<DH>L.A. Unified vows more scrutiny of potential campus sites
after fault is found under Belmont.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Duke Helfand and Joe Mathews</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles school officials pledged Thursday to step up their
geological reviews of more than 100 proposed campuses to avoid the
mistakes that now threaten the Belmont Learning Complex.</LD>
<LD>   Supt. Roy Romer said the measures used to uncover a small
earthquake fault beneath two buildings at the Belmont campus will
serve as a model for investigating potential school sites included in
the district's ambitious construction program over the next decade.</LD>
<LD>   "Having had this experience, we obviously will be sensitive and
strengthen this process," Romer said. "We will have a higher degree
of focus on any site we are dealing with in terms of its relationship
to any fault."</LD>
<TE>   Construction will not proceed at potential district sites found to
sit atop active faults or, as in the case beneath Belmont, faults
that cannot be proved to be inactive, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   State law is somewhat more lenient, forbidding construction of
schools only on faults known to be active.</TE>
<TE>   District leaders could not say how much the new investigations
will cost. The recent seismic tests at Belmont cost $1 million to $2
million.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no question that fatal seismic flaws should be
identified before acquiring a property," said Angelo Bellomo,
director of the district's environmental health and safety branch.</TE>
<TE>   He and other officials said school sites will be evaluated on an
individual basis, but they would not speculate on whether the efforts
will delay the opening of new schools or cause building plans to
change.</TE>
<TE>   The district's massive building plans to ease overcrowding
received a major boost with last month's passage of local and state
bond issues expected to provide more than $5 billion to Los Angeles
Unified.</TE>
<TE>   Romer said the district, following state law, will continue to
examine geologic literature and historic photos of potential school
sites, and review state seismic maps for faults.</TE>
<TE>   But he and other district officials said the state requirements
may not be rigorous enough for troublesome sites, and they committed
themselves to going further.</TE>
<TE>   They said they will identify zones of Los Angeles where the
topography suggests hidden hazards even if there may be few if any
known major faults in these areas.</TE>
<TE>   In areas where faults are likely to be deep, scientists will
probably drill small holes and release sound waves to detect faults.</TE>
<TE>   In shallower areas, where bedrock is close to the surface,
seismologists will probably dig trenches to determine the potential
for faults rupturing at ground level -- the very technique that
uncovered the fault beneath the Belmont complex.</TE>
<TE>   Romer and his top lieutenants outlined their approach a day after
disclosing three options being studied for the half-finished Belmont
campus near downtown, where construction stopped three years ago amid
fears about underground toxic gases from old oil wells on the
property.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this year, the Los Angeles Board of Education revived the
project and was investigating ways to deal with those environmental
problems.</TE>
<TE>   Now, the board faces the unpalatable choices of razing two of the
six Belmont buildings, rebuilding a smaller version of what was
planned to be a 3,600-student school elsewhere on the 35-acre
property or abandoning the site and looking for a new location.</TE>
<TE>   Romer said he will make a recommendation on Belmont to the Board
of Education within 60 days. A majority of the seven board members
said this week that they favor abandoning the site.</TE>
<TE>   The complex, whose price tag has reached $175 million, is already
the most expensive high school in California history. If it is not
abandoned, some of the rebuilding plans could cost as much as an
additional $70 million, Romer said.</TE>
<TE>   A preliminary seismic report on the Belmont property could not
conclusively say whether the fault beneath the school is active.</TE>
<TE>   Kerry Sieh, the Caltech professor who found the fault, said that
he used "very, very conservative assumptions" in estimating its
length and age. Those measurements were used to show that the ground
around the fault could shift by one foot in the event of a major
quake.</TE>
<TE>   Romer said it was wrong to call such assumptions conservative,
given that the safety of children is at issue.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't see it as overreacting," he said. "That's the best
science could do. My responsibility is to build safe schools."</TE>
<TE>   The fault is not on the surface but has the potential to trigger a
ground rupture, according to the district's seismic consultants.</TE>
<TE>   Several geologists consider the district's efforts overly
cautious. They point out that the entire Los Angeles Basin is
crisscrossed by faults, yet few sites are actually at risk of
ground-level ruptures that can cause extensive damage.</TE>
<TE>   "Most of the L.A. Basin does not have the significant potential
for surface faulting," said Chris Wills, supervising geologist with
the California Geological Survey.</TE>
<TE>   Pinpointing earthquake hazards is often a guessing game, with
discoveries coming only as new earthquakes reveal previously unknown
faults.</TE>
<TE>   "We probably won't be able to determine the activity level of
faults we find on many of these sites," said Thomas Henyey, deputy
director of the Southern California Earthquake Center and a professor
of earth sciences at USC. "It's almost impossible to know which fault
is going to go next in Southern California."</TE>
<TE>   School board President Caprice Young on Thursday echoed that
uncertainty, even as she sounded a reassuring tone about the
district's plans.</TE>
<TE>   "We live in California. The more we learn, the scarier it is," she
said. "But we have a responsibility to take all reasonable steps
necessary to make sure our students are safe. The standards that were
acceptable in the past are not acceptable now."</TE>
<TE>   Parents in the area and Latino leaders are extremely upset about
the seismic revelation and are demanding to know why the fault was
not discovered sooner. They expected the school to open in three
years, removing thousands of students from overcrowded campuses and
long bus commutes.</TE>
<TE>   Romer has promised that some new Belmont campus will be built, but
said Thursday that the original plan and a proposed development
contract are "obviously history."</TE>
<TE>   "We can't continue to build that design," he said. "Whatever we do
will be a new project."</TE>

<HD>Cantors to Pay Tribute to Mentor</HD>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Six cantors who got their musical start at a Valley Village temple
will return there Sunday evening to pay tribute in song to the man
who inspired them to join the Jewish clergy.</LD>
<LD>   Temple Adat Ari El has turned out nine professional cantors due in
large part to the late Cantor Allan Michelson, a master teacher who
was friend, mentor and disciplinarian to hundreds who sang in the
children's choir.</LD>
<LD>   "It's quite unusual. One student or two students in a generation
might come out of a synagogue [and become rabbis or cantors], but to
have nine -- it's extraordinary," said Ron Wolfson, a vice president
at the University of Judaism in Bel-Air.</LD>
<TE>   In addition to developing many lay cantors, Michelson is credited
with creating a singing, participatory worship environment during
more than three decades at the 900-family Conservative congregation.</TE>
<TE>   "He produced an inordinate number of people that became Jewish
professionals. He did it through his love of music and prayer," said
Nathan Lam, Adat Ari El's associate cantor from 1969 to 1973 and now
cantor at Stephen S. Wise Temple in Bel-Air. "It's an incredible
legacy."</TE>
<TE>   Lam will be among those performing in Sunday's concert that will
include not only Jewish music but Broadway tunes.</TE>
<TE>   Other cantors singing are Mindy J. Harris of Temple Aliyah in
Woodland Hills, Joseph D. Gole of Sinai Temple in Los Angeles, Daniel
Friedman of Temple Beth Sholom in Las Vegas, Jaime Shpall of
Congregation Beth Israel in Austin, Texas, and Robert Scherr of
Temple Israel in Natick, Mass.</TE>
<TE>   Former students say Michelson, who died in 1991, was steeped in
ancient Jewish tradition in which cantors conveyed the liturgy by
singing or chanting prayers and songs.</TE>
<TE>   Shpall isn't alone when she says that without Michelson's
tutelage, she wouldn't have become a cantor.</TE>
<TE>   "When we sang, he would stand back and beam with pride. He would
let us shine. We never got the feeling that he was trying to grab the
limelight," said Shpall, 33, who grew up in Sherman Oaks and joined
the children's choir in kindergarten. "At my synagogue, I use so many
of the melodies I learned at Adat Ari El."</TE>
<TE>   A native of Latvia, Michelson loved children, said Ira S.
Bigeleisen, the temple's cantor since 1993. "He spent a lot of time
with the kids, sometimes even taking them to the beach. There were
stories in the '50s and '60s, before seat belts were required, about
him driving around with 10 kids hanging out the windows. He loved
them," said Bigeleisen.</TE>
<TE>   Harris said she's excited about returning to her childhood
synagogue, a place of many happy memories. "I have so many
sentimental feelings about that shul. I was at that temple more than
anywhere else when I was a kid," she said.</TE>
<TE>   A Time for Singing: The Legacy of Cantor Allan Michelson begins at
7 p.m. Sunday at Adat Ari El, 12020 Burbank Blvd., Valley Village.</TE>

<HD>Critics Protest Mahony Plan to Fight Law</HD>
<DH>The state has suspended the statute of limitations in
claims of priestly abuse. A spokesman for the L.A. Archdiocese says
the change is unfair.</DH>

<LD>California's Roman Catholic bishops are wrongly attempting to blame
victims of sexual abuse for the church's financial problems,
advocates for the victims said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   At a news conference outside the Cathedral of Our Lady of the
Angels, the victims advocates also called on Cardinal Roger M. Mahony
of Los Angeles to scrap his plans to challenge a new state law that
will allow potentially hundreds of new lawsuits to be filed against
the church next year.</LD>
<LD>   The law temporarily suspends the statute of limitations on many
old claims involving sexual molestation by priests. The church made
little effort to oppose the measure as it moved through the
Legislature, but the Los Angeles Archdiocese, backed by other bishops
in the state, said this week it now intends to challenge the law.</LD>
<TE>   "Rather than continue to hurt victims by saying they're going to
fight the law, we ask them to submit to the law like every other
American citizen has and support the victims in this process of
healing," said Mary Grant, Southern California regional director of
the Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests.</TE>
<TE>   Tod Tamberg, spokesman for the archdiocese, denied that the church
was harming victims. The plan to fight the law is solely a matter of
fairness, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "If you have allegations that come forward that are 40 or 50 or 30
years old, who was around? What witnesses are available to ascertain
the truth of those allegations? We're appealing to fundamental
fairness. This isn't re-victimization," Tamberg said.</TE>
<TE>   Sunday, the state's bishops plan to have a letter read to
parishioners across California that warns of potentially dire
financial implications to the church from the new lawsuits.</TE>
<TE>   In the letter, the bishops reaffirm their commitment to respond to
the "legitimate claims" of sexual abuse victims. But, they say, "the
Catholic church has been falsely portrayed as a large corporation
with deep pockets."</TE>
<TE>   Most church assets belong to the people of individual parishes,
schools and church charities, the letter says. "They are not devoted
to the accumulation of wealth but to education, worship and
sacraments: to the poor and other works of charity."</TE>
<TE>   Advocates for the victims said the tone of the letter angered
them. They promised to distribute an alternative letter Sunday in
some parishes in Los Angeles and Orange counties.</TE>
<TE>   They also asked Catholics to download the alternative letter at
the Web site www.survivorsnetwork.org, and to distribute it at their
own parishes.</TE>
<TE>   Lee Bashforth of Lake Forrest, leader of Survivors Network of
those Abused by Priests, said the tone of the bishops' letter is "a
clear signal to everyone that they still don't get it. This is not
about lawsuits and fighting statutes of limitations and other legal
hardball tactics they've used before. This is about protecting
children and seeking justice."</TE>
<TE>   Instead of fighting the one-year waiver in the statute of
limitations, Bashforth said, California bishops should work to
persuade bishops across the U. S. to work for similar legislation.</TE>
<TE>   Tamberg said that when the lawsuits are filed beginning next
month, the church anticipates "an awful lot of lawyers' rhetoric
saying the church has done nothing -- and that's not true. The point
of the letter was to let people know the very real accomplishments
and concrete actions that have taken place in our church to protect
children and young people and not let that be obscured by the filings
in January."</TE>

<HD>Violent Crime Drops 1% Countywide</HD>
<DH>That contrasts with a 3.3% increase statewide in the first
half of 2002. O.C. property offenses rise at a lower rate.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>David Haldane</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Major crimes increased significantly statewide during the first six
months of the year, but the increases were smaller or nonexistent in
Orange County, according to a state attorney general's report
released Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   "We're all very happy to hear that the trend is going in the right
direction," said Lt. Hayward Miller, a spokesman for the Orange
County Sheriff's Department.</LD>
<LD>   Property crimes increased 9.8% statewide and violent crimes by
3.3% from January to June of this year compared with the same period
last year, according to the report released by Atty. Gen. Bill
Lockyer. At the same time, however, property crimes in Orange County
rose only 3% and violent crimes decreased 1%.</LD>
<TE>   "It's got to be [due to] a cumulative effort by all of the
county's law enforcement agencies working to together to combat
crime," Miller said. "We always work the areas we are responsible for
very aggressively, and I think that it's certainly had an impact on
the statistics reported."</TE>
<TE>   The report included numbers from law enforcement agencies in the
county's largest cities -- Anaheim, Costa Mesa, Fullerton, Garden
Grove, Huntington Beach, Irvine, Orange and Santa Ana -- and from
areas patrolled by the Sheriff's Department.</TE>
<TE>   One notable exception to the O.C. trend was Anaheim, where
homicides increased 83.3%, from 6 to 11, in the first six months of
2002 compared with the same period last year.</TE>
<TE>   An Anaheim police spokesman attributed the increase to a rise in
gang and drug activities, and to the growing number of 14- to
23-year-olds, the age group that commits most crimes. Law enforcement
officials are not surprised by the surge, Sgt. Rick Martinez said,
because crime has been at an all-time low for the last 12 years.</TE>
<TE>   "We've been working to keep it as low as we can but with economic
conditions, social conditions, the emphasis on terrorism -- with so
many things going on in today's world, you have to stretch your
resources to meet all of the safety needs," he said.</TE>

<HD>O.C. Planning Unit to Cut Staff 20%</HD>
<DH>The department has seen a drop in revenue from
building-permit fees. An emergency plan will aim to keep inspections
going.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Janet Wilson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Orange County's Planning Department staff will be cut 20% because of
an unexpected loss of millions of dollars in revenue from
building-permit fees. An estimated 35 to 40 people will lose their
jobs, but no final decisions have been made on which positions will
be eliminated, department spokesman Brian Murphy said.</LD>
<LD>   An emergency plan is being crafted to try to keep in place all
core Planning Department services, such as building and construction
site inspections.</LD>
<LD>   Planning and Development Services Director Thomas Mathews informed
his stunned staff of the upcoming layoffs in a letter e-mailed to
them late Thursday afternoon.</LD>
<TE>   "In my 28 years of service to the county of Orange, this is by far
the most difficult task that I have ever undertaken," wrote Mathews,
according to a copy of the e-mail read to The Times. "Those directly
affected will receive their notices within the next few days."</TE>
<TE>   Said Murphy: "As you can imagine, the level of stress is very
high."</TE>
<TE>   The Board of Supervisors will vote Tuesday on whether to enact an
emergency increase of nearly 60% in permit fees to help staunch the
red ink. The fees had been cut by more than a third since 1999, in
the wake of a lawsuit by a national homebuilder arguing that the
Planning Department had improperly stockpiled a high reserve in its
inspection fund, which at one point reached $18 million. Refunds were
also made to several developers after the department determined that
it had overcharged them.</TE>
<TE>   Just three years later, the fund is empty, and inspection services
are being performed on an $8-million line of credit issued by
supervisors in August.</TE>
<TE>   "Basically there is a shortfall in revenue because last year
permit activity was significantly down, more than expected," Murphy
said, referring to builder fees. Projected appropriations for the
fiscal year ended June 30 were about $30.5 million, most of it
anticipated permit fees.</TE>
<TE>   In August, a $2-million-plus shortfall was discovered in the
department's fund used to pay for building inspections, which are
funded by permit fees. Two employees remain on paid administrative
leave as part of an investigation into the shortfall, but there are
no allegations of theft or fraud, Murphy said.</TE>
<TE>   County Executive Michael Schumacher's office is overseeing an
investigation into the department's finances, Murphy said.</TE>
<TE>   Supervisors were warned by county staff last month in a
closed-door meeting that layoffs were possible, Supervisor Tom Wilson
said late Thursday. He said the department has an $8-million
shortfall.</TE>
<TE>   "We were told that ... they were [also] working to get some people
reassigned," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Budget forecasters predicted a spike in building permit
applications in the second and fourth quarters of last year. Instead,
Murphy said, all four quarters saw less activity than any quarter in
the previous five years.</TE>
<TE>   There is no sign that the picture will improve anytime soon.</TE>
<TE>   In his e-mail, Mathews noted that with so little unincorporated
land left in the county, there is just not that much work remaining
for planning staff.</TE>
<TE>   "Even though a few major landholdings such as Rancho Mission Viejo
still have years of work ahead, none of these will provide enough
work in the short term to justify the current size and expense of our
department."</TE>
<TE>   He also noted that it may be years before zoning is approved for
Bolsa Chica, Saddleback Meadows and Tonner Hills -- three fiercely
contested projects stalled by lawsuits and other challenges.</TE>
<TE>   Without such approvals, construction cannot begin, and permit fees
-- the lifeblood of the department's budget -- won't be paid.</TE>

<HD>Chapman Students 'Rough It' Off Campus</HD>
<DH>Sixty are living in hotels after being forced to evacuate
their dorm because of faulty wiring. But does maid service make up
for the hassles?</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Vivian LeTran</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dorm life has taken an unexpected turn for dozens of Chapman
University students who suddenly find themselves living at hotels
miles from campus.</LD>
<LD>   Though the move has brought unaccustomed perks, including kitchens
and maid service, "it's been a major inconvenience not being able to
live close to campus," said senior Wynne Caburian, 22. "It's the last
thing I need to add to the stress of finals next week and just before
I graduate."</LD>
<LD>   Sixty students living in 32-unit Harris Hall were forced to
evacuate a week before Thanksgiving when maintenance crews discovered
faulty electrical wiring that made the building too dangerous to
occupy.</LD>
<TE>   "It was a severe-enough problem that we'd rather have them
inconvenienced than injured," university spokeswoman Ruth Wardwell
said. The electrical system overhaul could cost the university
$300,000 and is expected to be completed by January when the semester
ends, she said.</TE>
<TE>   The students, mostly juniors and seniors, found notices posted
Nov. 15 and were moved to two hotels several miles from the campus in
Orange. They had to quickly clear out their most valuable belongings.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a bit surprising, and I was upset at first when they told
us we had to move out because there was some risk of us getting
electrocuted. So we had such short notice to move out," Caburian
said.</TE>
<TE>   Students were moved to extended-stay hotel accommodations in
Orange. The hotel rooms are costing the university $1,000 a day.</TE>
<TE>   The hotels also provide some students with shuttle services to get
to class.</TE>
<TE>   But students complain that the shuttle often makes them late, and
that the hotels have poor access to the Internet, through which they
communicate with professors.</TE>
<TE>   "We're sorry we even had to relocate the students from campus
where things are most convenient for them, particularly at this time
toward the end of the semester with finals," said Joseph Kertes,
Chapman vice president and dean of students. "But with our
overcrowded housing situation on campus, we had no choice but to go
off campus."</TE>
<TE>   The students still have access to their belongings in the Harris
dorm, but with the power off, they often have to use flashlights to
find their books and extra clothing.</TE>
<TE>   But provided with room service, free meals, swimming pool, Jacuzzi
and complimentary happy hour and other hotel amenities, some students
are willing to adjust to the new arrangements.</TE>
<TE>   "The hotels are nice. We get fresh towels every morning, and the
bed gets made when I get back. I guess I can't complain too much,"
said senior Mark Doti, 21, a cousin of the university's president,
James L. Doti.</TE>

<HD>Police Fee Hikes Anger Businesses</HD>
<DH>City says the increases are necessary to ensure certain
establishments are 'on the up and up.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Patrick McGreevy</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles city officials said Thursday that they have received
hundreds of calls and letters from businesses protesting substantial
increases in fees for permits issued by the LAPD.</LD>
<LD>   Some of those critics charge that city politicians are attempting
to tax controversial businesses out of Los Angeles.</LD>
<LD>   "They want us gone," said Paul Cole, a licensed gun dealer who
owns the Target Range business in Van Nuys. "They don't want gun
dealers in Los Angeles. This is how they are doing it."</LD>
<TE>   Cole said he is considering ending gun sales at his business after
being notified that his annual firearms vendor license is increasing
1,242% from $149 to $2,000, while each salesman permit goes from $149
to $400.</TE>
<TE>   Increases are being imposed on 15 kinds of police permits,
affecting 2,595 businesses and individuals. The permits include those
for game arcades, auto parks, cafes with live entertainment, dance
halls, firearms vendors, massage technicians, towing companies and
pawnbrokers.</TE>
<TE>   "It's unbelievably outrageous," pawnshop owner Igor Shekhtman said
of the increase in the annual pawnbroker permit from $124 to $2,000.</TE>
<TE>   He said his Loma Pawn Shop in downtown Los Angeles already pays a
$3,000 fee for a state license.</TE>
<TE>   Pawnbrokers received a letter from the Police Commission that said
the higher fee, which was due Dec. 31, was meant to cover the "city
cost of regulating this type of business activity."</TE>
<TE>   Police conduct extensive background checks on all pawnbrokers and
routinely review lists of items pawned in stores to look for stolen
goods.</TE>
<TE>   At the Great Greek Restaurant in Sherman Oaks, manager Dionisi
Araklisianos said the 130% increase in the permit fee for cafes with
live entertainment is excessive.</TE>
<TE>   In total, the fee increases are expected to generate $1.7 million
annually in additional revenue for the city.</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles Police Commission, which issues the permits, has
received hundreds of complaints about the fees, said Lt. Debra Kirk,
commanding officer of the Commission Investigation Division.</TE>
<TE>   The city administrative office recommended the fee hikes last
year. Kirk said the commission supported only three increases -- for
the massage industry, carnivals, and solicitors for police and
firefighter organizations.</TE>
<TE>   She said that some firms soliciting for police organizations are
fraudulent, while vice officers must constantly watch for illegal
activity in the massage industry.</TE>
<TE>   But the commission was overruled by the City Council, which
unanimously approved the package on Sept. 25, 2001.</TE>
<TE>   "We thought it would have a negative impact on business in the
city," Kirk said.</TE>
<TE>   City Councilwoman Cindy Miscikowski defended the increases, saying
that many of the permit fees had not been changed for a decade.</TE>
<TE>   "Although people are seeing a significant leap in the fees, it's
been a long time since they were looked at," Miscikowski said.</TE>
<TE>   As chairwoman of the council's Public Safety Committee,
Miscikowski said she was satisfied that the higher fees were
necessary to recover the city's cost of ensuring that businesses
operate "on the up and up."</TE>
<TE>   "These are activities where if they weren't properly permitted and
controlled, sometimes things could go awry and lead to criminal
activity," Miscikowski said.</TE>
<TE>   The Police Department only charges fees for businesses that
require police responses or oversight, such as massage parlors and
arcades.</TE>
<TE>   Officers do extensive background checks on all permit applicants,
and keep track of items pawned and guns sold. The city also incurs
costs when a disciplinary hearing is held for a permit-holder.</TE>
<TE>   "We would be putting the city in an awkward position if we did not
recover our costs," Councilman Nick Pacheco said.</TE>
<TE>   Raisa Trakhtenberg said she was upset that her pawnshop was not
notified until last month of the fee increase, more than a year after
the fact.</TE>
<TE>   "They should have let us know a year ago so we would have time to
respond," she said,</TE>
<TE>   Some of those who received the letter, dated Nov. 13, are
suspicious that it was timed to arrive just after the vote for San
Fernando Valley and Hollywood secession. Secession leaders said it
appeared that the city did not want to create controversy before the
secession vote.</TE>
<TE>   They said the same appears true of a letter sent to 151,000 people
that said they may owe business taxes to the city.</TE>
<TE>   That letter also has caused City Hall to be inundated with
complaining calls, many from people who operate small-business
ventures from their homes and resent being asked to pay taxes on
meager earnings.</TE>

<TE>   Steep city fee increases</TE>
<TE>   The fees for many permits issued by the Los Angeles Police
Department have been increased by the City Council to cover the
city's cost of overseeing the permitted activities, but the steep

<HD>Board Gets Warning on Water Deal</HD>
<DH>Top Bush official reminds Imperial Valley farm community
that agreement is crucial to prevent huge cutback of Colorado River
supplies.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tony Perry</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>EL CENTRO</DL>
<LD>With a deadline just days away, a top Bush administration official
warned Thursday that coastal Southern California will suffer a
sizable reduction in its water supply next year unless the water-rich
farming community here agrees to a deal with arid San Diego County.</LD>
<LD>   Asst. Interior Secretary Bennett Raley said his boss, Interior
Secretary Gale Norton, is determined to reduce California's overuse
of the Colorado River so that other Western states can get their full
entitlement.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm not here to tell you what to do," Raley told a meeting of the
Imperial Irrigation District. " ... But doing nothing is not an
option. The secretary is going to enforce the law of the river."</LD>
<TE>   The board of the Imperial Irrigation District is set next week to
discuss whether to sign a 75-year water deal with San Diego, the
Metropolitan Water District of Southern California and the Coachella
Valley Water District. The plan would help cut the state's usage of
the river by shifting water now used by farms to urban customers.</TE>
<TE>   Raley's unusual appearance before the board of the Imperial
district may partly dispel any notion that the Bush administration
will back down from a Dec. 31 deadline for California to cut its use
of the Colorado.</TE>
<TE>   Raley made clear the deadline was unequivocal, leaving vague only
the precise date on which California's river water might be cut back.</TE>
<TE>   The water transfer is highly controversial here in the sprawling
farm country north of the Mexican border, particularly among farmers
and business leaders who feel that the price they will be paid for
the water is too low and that Imperial County's $1-billion-a-year
agricultural industry will be crippled by a requirement that some
fields be left unplanted.</TE>
<TE>   The outcome of next week's expected vote by the district board is
very much in doubt. Two board members favor the deal. Two oppose it.
The fifth, though undecided, does nothing to hide his disdain for the
plan.</TE>
<TE>   Bruce Kuhn, the holder of the apparent tie-breaking vote, said
angrily that some San Diego officials are unfairly depicting the
water transfer as providing windfall profits to farmers.</TE>
<TE>   More accurately, Kuhn said, the deal amounts to the farm
community's bailout of urban and suburban Southern California, which
have been unable to curb growth and foolishly counted on the surplus
Colorado River water.</TE>
<TE>   "They look at us and say, 'Let's go after those dumb ... farmers,'
" Kuhn said. "We didn't cause this problem [California's water
shortage]. We're willing to do our part, but not at the expense of
our economy or our way of life."</TE>
<TE>   Raley said the Imperial Valley and California have two choices:
Consummate the water deal by Dec. 31 or lose up to 800,000 acre-feet
of "surplus" water next year, enough to satisfy the needs of about 6
million people.</TE>
<TE>   "We're having a gun put to our head and we're being encouraged to
hold the gun while the trigger is being pulled," said Heidi Kuhn, a
cousin of Bruce Kuhn, whose own family grows alfalfa and runs a
dairy.</TE>
<TE>   In Los Angeles, officials of the Metropolitan Water District,
which supplies water to 17 million people in six counties, said that
even the cutback threatened by Raley would not lead to immediate
shortages.</TE>
<TE>   The district's increased storage and water deals with other
farming districts in the state would offset the cut for about 18
months, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Ron Gastelum, chief executive officer of MWD, said that even in
the longer term, the agency would be able to compensate for the loss
of the surplus water by "appropriate investments" in additional
conservation, recycling, desalination projects and other water
transfers.</TE>
<TE>   Gastelum also rejected Kuhn's assertion about growth in Southern
California. "He's way off base," Gastelum said. "We have managed our
growth through investments in recycling and conservation and other
programs so the amount of water today is the same as in the
mid-1970s. All the growth that has occurred is not the reason we're
asking for water" from the Imperial Valley.</TE>
<TE>   Raley also warned that if the Imperial board decides not to sign
the deal, it will only postpone the inevitable sale of water to the
densely populated coastal region. Raley told the board, in effect,
that Imperial's legal entitlement to the lion's share of Colorado
River water will not withstand the growing needs and political power
of the communities that sweep from Los Angeles to San Diego.</TE>
<TE>   "The economic pressures associated with urban growth in the West
are extremely strong," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The Imperial district could undercut its own authority if it won't
sign the deal, the Bush administration's Western water czar added,
predicting that individual Imperial Valley farmers will cut side
deals to sell water to San Diego and the giant Metropolitan district.</TE>
<TE>   Signing the water deal, he said, will mean the district "can
continue to control its own destiny."</TE>
<TE>   While many farmers abhor the idea of selling water, others have
already written to Raley about individual deals if the Imperial
Irrigation District declines to sign. One farmer has hired a Northern
California lawyer to inquire about the legal issues of private sales.</TE>
<TE>   Raley's warning is just the latest attempt to convince the
Imperial Irrigation District that it will suffer dire consequences if
it does not sign the deal.</TE>
<TE>   During negotiations that led to a preliminary agreement Oct. 15
between the four water agencies, state officials suggested that if
the Imperial district balks, the Legislature could assume control of
the district and sign the deal on its behalf.</TE>
<TE>   Another strategy would be to declare that the Imperial Valley's
enormous use of Colorado River water does not constitute a legally
permissible "beneficial use" and thus should be reduced. Both state
and federal regulations say that water rights are valid only if the
water is being used beneficially.</TE>
<TE>   The pressure from state and federal officials is beginning to wear
on Imperial Valley leaders. Board member Lloyd Allen said he favors
the agreement because he feels the Legislature, with heavy
representation from Los Angeles and San Diego, has the power to
enforce the deal even if Imperial Valley resists.</TE>
<TE>   The Dec. 31 deadline was set two years ago in an agreement between
California and the six other states that depend on the Colorado
River.</TE>
<TE>   For years California has been receiving annual "surplus"
allocations from the river -- water that, in effect, belongs to other
states.</TE>
<TE>   The Imperial Irrigation District, which provides water to 140,000
people and 500,000 acres of farmland, receives more than 3 million
acre-feet of water a year from the Colorado.</TE>
<TE>   The Metropolitan Water District of Southern California is entitled
to 550,000 acre-feet and a portion of river water declared by the
Interior Department as surplus. It is that surplus allocation for
MWD, which has amounted to 600,000 to 800,000 acre-feet a year, that
Raley is threatening to terminate.</TE>
<TE>   Arizona, Nevada and other Western states have pressured the
Interior Department to end surplus allocations to California. But
after years of negotiations, the six other states agreed in 2000 to
give California another 15 years of surplus allocations, as long as
it met interim goals for reducing its Colorado River use.</TE>
<TE>   Already impatient with California's failure to finalize the water
transfer, Arizona recently petitioned the Interior Department to
begin reducing California's take in January. Arizona said its
neighbor's surplus allocations should be cut off altogether within a
year.</TE>
<TE>   Although Imperial Valley is geographically obscure in southeast
California, it is center stage to discussions of water allocations
throughout the West because of its behemoth share of the Colorado
River.</TE>
<TE>   That huge claim is based on the fact that Imperial Valley farmers
staked their claim to the river's water before almost everyone else,
more than a century ago.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been thinking about you all intensely," Raley said, "for the
16 months I've been in this job."</TE>

<HD>Pressure Triggers Latest Rise in Proposed O.C. Airport Load</HD>
<DH>Industry and federal roles, plus death of the El Toro
airfield plan, are factors in negotiations to boost annual passenger
limits at John Wayne.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Dan Weikel</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Industry pressure, federal authority and the failed El Toro airfield
proposal have combined to push Newport Beach and Orange County
supervisors to agree on an eventual passenger load at John Wayne
Airport of 10.8 million -- far more than people living under the
flight path had ever anticipated.</LD>
<LD>   As part of a proposed revision of airport controls, that ceiling
-- to allow 1 million more passengers annually than proposed by the
county earlier this year -- comes at a time of mounting opposition
from the airline industry to local controls that conflict with a 1990
federal law banning city and county governments from limiting airport
activity.</LD>
<LD>   Aircraft noise restrictions and passenger volumes at John Wayne
now are controlled by the county under a landmark 1985 court
settlement that is set to expire in 2005. The original agreement,
which ended a lawsuit by Newport Beach and others, had capped
passenger volumes at 8.4 million a year. The airport now handles
about 7.8 million air travelers a year.</LD>
<TE>   The proposal, which would revise and extend the 1985 settlement,
would increase airport capacity to 10.3 million a year in 2003, and
to a maximum of 10.8 million by the end of 2011. The number of
noisiest flights would be raised from 73 to 85 a day, and the number
of gates would increase from 14 to 20. The entire agreement would
expire in 2015.</TE>
<TE>   The Newport Beach City Council and the county Board of Supervisors
are scheduled to vote on the proposal next week.</TE>
<TE>   "This is far more than Newport Beach ever wanted at John Wayne,"
conceded Mayor Tod W. Ridgeway. "But the quid pro quo for us is that
the airlines will not file a lawsuit against us and the Federal
Aviation Administration will take no further action."</TE>
<TE>   Neither the FAA nor the airline industry has taken an official
position on the proposed agreement.</TE>
<TE>   The latest plan builds on one reached by Newport Beach and the
Board of Supervisors in June that would allow the airport, starting
Jan. 1, to expand operations beyond the limits in the 1985
settlement.</TE>
<TE>   Under the changes proposed in June, airport capacity would rise to
a maximum of 9.8 million passengers year, 1.4 million above the 1985
cap. Adding four future gates also was approved, bringing the total
to 18.</TE>
<TE>   In an attempt to avoid litigation and maintain some local control,
the city and county will ask the FAA to review the newer plan once it
is approved to make sure it conforms to the federal Airport Noise and
Capacity Act of 1990.</TE>
<TE>   The FAA, which enforces the measure, has the power to sue over the
proposed restrictions. If the agency signs off on the changes, local
officials believe, airlines would be unlikely to raise a legal
challenge as well.</TE>
<TE>   Paul Turk, an FAA spokesman, said Thursday that the agency will
review the proposal and comments from government officials and the
airlines based at John Wayne Airport. The FAA could issue an opinion
by the end of the year.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone wants to make sure this is locked down and that we are
in compliance with federal law," said Alan Murphy, director of John
Wayne Airport. "The FAA interpretation is critical."</TE>
<TE>   The proposal, Murphy said, provides noise protections for
communities near the airport while allowing more capacity after the
public rejected a plan to turn the closed El Toro Marine Corps Air
Station into a major commercial airport. An airport serving up to 30
million passengers a year at El Toro had been heavily favored by
Newport Beach officials in hopes of lessening demand at John Wayne,
which is just north of that city.</TE>
<TE>   Murphy said those supporting the plan include the 10 commercial
airlines now based at John Wayne, citizens groups, members of the
Newport Beach City Council and members of the Board of Supervisors.</TE>
<TE>   If approved by Newport Beach, the county and the FAA, an amended
settlement agreement will be submitted in federal court. Newport
Beach City Atty. Robert Burnham said it probably would go before U.S.
District Judge Terry Hatter, who has signed off on smaller changes to
the 1985 settlement.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to make sure we get the benefit of our bargain and head
off possible lawsuits over the restrictions," Burnham said. "An
outside carrier could sue over this, but our biggest concern is the
FAA."</TE>
<TE>   Another obstacle has been the Air Transport Assn., which
represents the largest airlines. The organization has insisted that
all constraints on John Wayne's hours of operation -- aircraft now
can fly only from 7 a.m. to 11 p.m. -- as well as those affecting jet
noise and passenger capacity there, be allowed to expire at the end
of 2005.</TE>
<TE>   Association officials say any regulations at John Wayne must
conform to the Airport Noise and Capacity Act. A year ago, attorneys
for the organization warned the county that they would fight any
attempts to extend local regulations.</TE>
<TE>   "The key point is that whatever resolution takes place, it must
meet federal law," ATA spokesman Roger Cohen said. "I believe the
parties have been trying hard to do that. It's a difficult needle to
thread."</TE>
<TE>   John Wayne presents a unique situation because of its locally
imposed restrictions and proximity to homes, Cohen said, adding that
his group will take into consideration the views of air carriers now
serving Orange County. But, he said, the association is waiting to
see what the FAA does before deciding on legal action.</TE>

<HD>Leadership Vacuum Consigns Bratton to Waging War Alone</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Lopez</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A beast is on the loose in Los Angeles, and the new chief of police
is chasing it with one hand on his six-shooter and the other on his
megaphone.</LD>
<LD>   One day Bill Bratton compared local gangs to the New York Mafia,
fishing for federal help in rounding up the bad guys. The next day
Broadway Bill took us to Dodge City, saying "hang 'em high" in
reference to a car chase that left a child with a severed arm.</LD>
<LD>   It's too soon to know if these daily scoldings -- part
psychological warfare and part ego -- can lead to results. But
Bratton is no dummy, and at the very least, he seems to have brought
hope to thousands of folks who are afraid to let their children out
of the house.</LD>
<TE>   Here's the problem: Bratton needs loads of help from public
officials who don't wear badges. And when it comes to leadership and
imagination, we are in the drought of the century.</TE>
<TE>   I could be wrong, but I don't think L.A.'s surge in gang crime is
a blip. I think it's the shake before the quake, and no matter which
side of the fault line we might live on in the city of riches -- the
have side or the have-not side -- we may all get rattled.</TE>
<TE>   In the 10 years ending in 1999, South Los Angeles lost more than
50,000 jobs. It now has roughly seven residents per available job, as
opposed to fewer than three residents per job citywide, according to
Dan Flaming of the Economic Roundtable.</TE>
<TE>   "It's kind of a Rust Belt along the Alameda Corridor now," says
Flaming, referring to the good-paying industrial jobs that used to
feed families and nourish neighborhoods.</TE>
<TE>   When American corporations chased cheap labor and higher profits
overseas, we were all supposed to celebrate the new economy at
Target, where foreign-made goods would cost peanuts and we'd all find
work rounding up the shopping carts in the parking lot.</TE>
<TE>   Well, guess what. The second-rate jobs of the new economy don't
pay the bills, and you don't have to take my word for it.</TE>
<TE>   This year's "Tale of Two Cities" report from the United Way said
23% of L.A. County's households earn less than $20,000 a year, 18%
live in poverty, and 30% of adults over 25 didn't make it through
high school. All this is happening within a few miles of the hillside
moguls who reap fortunes on entertainment that make us dumber and
cruder by the minute.</TE>
<TE>   Are you beginning to get the picture?</TE>
<TE>   Of course there's blood in the streets. We've got schools that
don't work, jobs that don't pay, dads in jail, drugs on the corner,
guns on the street, and a pop culture that glorifies the whole mess.</TE>
<TE>   And the problem goes beyond the baggy-pantsed thug on a corner in
South or East L.A., acting the fool. We're in the midst of a national
breakdown that's economic and social, north and south, black and
white and everything in between.</TE>
<TE>   When the city of Oakland hit the 100-homicide mark for the year,
Mayor and former Gov. Jerry Brown was asked whom to blame.</TE>
<TE>   "Bad schools, bad parents, the bad economy, a bad media, gangsta
rap and bad values," he said, adding that it would take "almost a
moral revolution" to solve the problem.</TE>
<TE>   I never thought I'd see the day when Jerry Brown sounded so much
like Dan Quayle, let alone Bill Bratton. Then again, he's the mayor
who started his own military academy to drill discipline into Oakland
youth.</TE>
<TE>   Has the culture gotten worse, I asked Brown? Or are we just
getting older?</TE>
<TE>   It's gotten worse, he said. The 5% of students who are bad apples
now control the schools, negative cultural influences make it harder
to build character and the new economy is destructive to families.</TE>
<TE>   "The government has to ensure a living wage for everyone who works
full time, and that would bolster families and create
counter-incentives to the druggies on the corner," Brown said. "But
that's not politically acceptable in today's world. It's more
acceptable to reduce taxes on billionaires and multimillionaires."</TE>
<TE>   Speaking of mayors, where's ours? Is he still shopping for pandas
in China, or was that him standing in Bratton's shadow when the chief
declared war on gangs?</TE>
<TE>   If Slim Jim Hahn had half as much to say about boosting the
economy in South L.A. as Bratton does about crime, we might get
something going.</TE>
<TE>   And where's L.A. schools boss Roy Romer? Guess what, Roy. Belmont
ain't the problem, so give it a rest. Washington Prep in South L.A.'s
got robbery, drugs and sex in the halls, and nobody's been fired?</TE>
<TE>   At least shake a fist. Blow a gasket. Come up with a fresh idea.</TE>
<TE>   That wasn't a Santa Ana condition that hit Los Angeles a couple of
weeks ago. It was a gale force created by a leadership vacuum that
has never been more obvious. Bill "Hang 'Em High" Bratton might turn
out to be all bluster, but at least he's got everyone's attention.</TE>
<TE>   I'm telling you he can't do it alone. Would somebody please help
him?</TE>

<HD>A Place for Shoplifters to Grab Some Help</HD>
<DH>A Newport Beach therapy program treats compulsive store
thieves using methods that have worked with alcoholics and drug
addicts.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Stuart Pfeifer</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Her father was gravely ill. Mother's Day was approaching, bringing
with it memories of an unhappy childhood. Linda wanted an escape.</LD>
<LD>   So she drove to Bloomingdale's, palmed an $80 glass figurine and
slipped it into a shopping bag. It took only a split second, but
store security saw it all. And soon, Linda was in handcuffs, headed
to jail, a harsh contrast from her lifestyle in Newport Beach.</LD>
<LD>   More than a year has passed since that episode, giving Linda
plenty of time to reflect. As a two-time offender, Linda spent eight
days in Orange County Jail. She also was sentenced to a Newport Beach
therapy program that treats compulsive shoplifting in much the same
way alcoholism or drug addiction is treated.</LD>
<TE>   Judges in Los Angeles and Orange counties send dozens of
shoplifters each year to the office of the Alternative Sentencing
Programs, hoping its 12-step-style group counseling will discourage
recidivism. The $400 cost is paid by the shoplifter.</TE>
<TE>   Alternative Sentencing focuses on people who shoplift even though
they don't need the items they steal. It's a category made up largely
of professionals -- doctors, attorneys, real estate agents. A police
officer is also among the group's alumni.</TE>
<TE>   Shoplifting has received much media attention since film star
Winona Ryder was arrested last year on charges of stealing designer
merchandise from Saks Fifth Avenue in Beverly Hills. Ryder, found
guilty last month, is scheduled to be sentenced today. Los Angeles
County prosecutors say they will recommend the Oscar-nominated
actress receive 60 days of community service and undergo drug and
psychiatric counseling "so her actions on Dec. 12, 2001, will not be
repeated."</TE>
<TE>   Therapists at Alternative Sentencing say financially secure people
steal for two reasons: a quick thrill or to give themselves a treat.</TE>
<TE>   Linda said stealing made her heart race, almost as though she were
on a drug. She said she'd even black out at times, as some alcoholics
do.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd get home, I'd see this thing in my trunk or in a sack and I'd
say, 'What is this?' It's like [I was in] a zone," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Linda and other shoplifters meet weekly for three months, trying
to identify the triggers that lead them to steal. They share
telephone numbers and call one another for support when they're
feeling vulnerable.</TE>
<TE>   Near the end of the treatment program, they write to the retailers
they victimized to apologize and share what they've learned. Some
store managers write back to congratulate them for getting help.</TE>
<TE>   "The times it happened I was in a very stressed out emotional
state.... Almost to get a high, I'd steal something," said Linda, who
asked that her real name not be used.</TE>
<TE>   Though clients at Alternative Sentencing have been convicted of a
crime, therapists for the program look on the behavior as a
psychological disorder that can be treated. One advantage of a group
meeting is that it makes shoplifters feel less isolated, therapists
say.</TE>
<TE>   "They hear other people saying the same things. They feel so less
alone," said Kathy Escher, a therapist who moderates some group
treatment programs. "It's an opportunity for them to talk about
secrets they haven't been able to talk about for years."</TE>
<TE>   Linda said she and others in her group have discussed the Ryder
case regularly. When the case is covered on the television news, she
watches with interest.</TE>
<TE>   "Every time the TV was on, I was in front of it. It reinforces
that this is a sickness," she said. "See, even celebrities could do
it. She could afford it. What was she doing it for?"</TE>
<TE>   While most placements are court-ordered, one recent client came on
her own, saying she'd been stealing nearly every day for several
months and wanted to stop before she got caught, Escher said.</TE>
<TE>   Some shoplifting suspects agree to enter counseling even before
they're sentenced, a move that one Orange County judge said impacts
her sentencing decisions.</TE>
<TE>   Superior Court Judge Margaret Anderson said she has seen 20 to 30
defendants enter counseling and believes the group-treatment program
works.</TE>
<TE>   "The upper-class women I see have all the money in the world, but
there's something wrong in their lives," Anderson said. "Once they
understand why they're doing it, they can channel that into something
positive."</TE>
<TE>   Nancy Clark, the director of Alternative Sentencing, said the goal
is to teach clients to recognize the triggers that cause them to
steal and how to respond.</TE>
<TE>   "They all have other emotional issues in their lives. If they were
not treated specifically for this, they would continue doing the same
thing, even if it meant going to jail," Clark said.</TE>
<TE>   Though she has completed the court-ordered treatment, Linda
returns twice a month to meet with other program graduates for
follow-up. Linda, a recovering alcoholic with 12 years of sobriety,
said dealing with her craving to steal has been more difficult than
her curbing her desire to drink, which often leads her to Alcoholics
Anonymous meetings.</TE>
<TE>   "There are AA meetings around the clock," she said. "I can't go
and talk to people about [shoplifting].... If it weren't for this
program, I'd be in big trouble. I just think I'd have gone nuts. I
would just think I'm a bad person, just like when I drank."</TE>
<TE>   She said she hopes anyone who compulsively steals considers
Clark's program, which treats both women and men.</TE>
<TE>   "AA is not such a stigma anymore. I really believe that's what's
going to happen with shoplifting in 10 or 15 years."</TE>

<HD>Trustees Violated Brown Act</HD>
<DH>Ventura County D.A. asks college board to take an
open-meetings pledge in the wake of closed sessions on ex-Chancellor
Westin.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Amanda Covarrubias</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ventura County's top prosecutor has found that community college
trustees unintentionally violated the state's open-meeting law, and
the board will be asked to take a pledge next week never to do so
again.</LD>
<LD>   In a recent letter to the Ventura County Community College board,
Dist. Atty. Greg Totten said trustees violated the law, known as the
Brown Act, in contract negotiations with former Chancellor Philip
Westin.</LD>
<LD>   As remediation, Acting Chancellor James Walker agreed the incoming
board, including two trustees elected last month, will take a public
oath reaffirming its commitment to the Brown Act.</LD>
<TE>   "It was an unintentional violation, but they suggested the
trustees do a reaffirmation, which any new board should do anyway,"
Walker said Thursday. "It is kind of a tricky law and can be open to
interpretation."</TE>
<TE>   Totten found the board had violated the law several times since
last spring, when Westin was awarded a 16% salary increase to
$203,000 a year by trustees for doing a good job.</TE>
<TE>   The most recent violation occurred in October, when trustees
failed to notify the public in a timely manner that they had bought
out Westin's contract after he came under fire for allegedly abusing
his expense account.</TE>
<TE>   The settlement -- which will pay Westin more than $200,000 in
salary, lifetime benefits and the title of chancellor emeritus for
one year -- became legal Oct. 4, but the public was not told about it
until Oct. 22.</TE>
<TE>   "The subsequent failure of the district to reveal upon inquiry
after Oct. 4 that a final agreement had been reached did not comply
with Brown Act requirements," Totten wrote in the Nov. 29 letter. He
noted that the board went into closed session again on Oct. 22 to
discuss Westin.</TE>
<TE>   "The California attorney general's office has often emphasized
that closed-session discussion of matters of public concern are
supposed to be the exception rather than the rule."</TE>
<TE>   The prosecutor also criticized the board for discussing Westin's
salary and those of other top district administrators during a
private meeting on May 28, when they initially decided to extend
Westin's contract and give him a raise.</TE>
<TE>   "The salary levels for these employees should not have been
discussed in closed session in the first place," Totten wrote.</TE>
<TE>   Special Assistant Dist. Atty. Tom Harris will attend the board
meeting Tuesday to witness the pledge.</TE>
<TE>   "If the newly constituted board elects that evening to make a
fresh commitment to observance of the Brown Act, we will accept that
affirmation and forgo initiation at this time of any court
proceedings," Totten wrote.</TE>
<TE>   The college board bought out Westin's contract after allegations
surfaced that the chancellor had spent $119,000 over four years on
meals, cars and computers.</TE>
<TE>   Westin was placed on administrative leave in July while an
internal investigation was conducted. He was later cleared of any
wrongdoing.</TE>
<TE>   But trustees said he had to go anyway, because the public's trust
had been violated by his spending practices.</TE>
<TE>   The Brown Act allegations first arose in July, when a lawsuit was
filed against the district on behalf of county taxpayers.</TE>
<TE>   The lawsuit alleged Westin's contract signed May 28 was invalid
because it was agreed upon in closed session.</TE>

<HD>3 Factors in Flawed Bridge Are Probed</HD>
<DH>Thin concrete, poorly spaced rebar and over-tightened
cables are suspect in the ramp linking the 405 and 55 in O.C.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Dan Weikel</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Engineers are investigating whether thin concrete, irregularly spaced
steel bars and over-tightened reinforcing cables caused extensive
damage to a new $12-million carpool bridge connecting the San Diego
and Costa Mesa freeways, newly obtained Caltrans records show.</LD>
<LD>   According to the documents obtained by The Times under the
California Public Records Act, engineers studying the flawed span
suspect that builders put too much tension on supporting cables,
causing concrete girders to crack and spall, a condition in which
concrete breaks off in layers.</LD>
<LD>   The damage has been found in two of three sections of the
half-mile-long span, delaying the April 2003 opening perhaps eight to
10 months.</LD>
<TE>   To keep such large bridges and elevated roads from sagging, long
steel tendons are installed inside them. These cables, which run
through metal pipes in concrete girders, are pulled tight by
hydraulic jacks to tension levels set by designers.</TE>
<TE>   Even if the proper amount of tension was used on the bridge's
cables, the Caltrans records suggest, the damage might have occurred
anyway because of thin concrete and uneven spacing of steel
reinforcement bars. In some of the damaged spots, the amount of
concrete that covered the rebar was found to be only two-thirds of
what the design required.</TE>
<TE>   "It appears that there are locations where the concrete cover of
the [rebar] is less than planned," a Caltrans engineer wrote in an
Oct. 28 report on the bridge. As built, he said, the sections where
damage was found might have been "inadequate to resist" the proper
amount of tension, let alone any excessive force.</TE>
<TE>   Based on field data, the engineer wrote that the tension applied
to cables in the two girders appears to exceed the maximum force
prescribed.</TE>
<TE>   The Caltrans reports, fact sheets and technical analysis provide a
glimpse into the effort to assess the damage, determine what happened
and repair the 60-foot-high ramp. At stake, too, is determining who
is at fault and who will pay for repairs that could cost more than $8
million if -- in a worst-case scenario -- sections of the elevated
roadway must be torn down and rebuilt.</TE>
<TE>   The towering span is part of a $125-million effort to improve the
junction of the San Diego and Costa Mesa freeways, one of the
nation's 10 busiest interchanges.</TE>
<TE>   Though Caltrans oversees the project, it was designed by CH2M
Hill, built by C.C. Myers Inc. and paid for by the Orange County
Transportation Authority. About 20% of state highway projects are
contracted to private firms.</TE>
<TE>   Jon Rohrer, an area construction manager for Caltrans whose duties
include working on bridges, said the thin concrete, the spacing of
rebar and the possibility that too much force was applied to the
bridge's cables are all being investigated as possible causes of the
structural failures.</TE>
<TE>   "We have not ruled out anything yet," Rohrer said.</TE>
<TE>   Work was stopped Aug. 20, when construction crews found that
concrete had cracked and fallen off girders that support two of the
road's three sections. The girders are contained in large bays that
run the length of the curving bridge.</TE>
<TE>   For the last two months, teams of engineers and consultants have
been assessing the damage and developing a repair plan.</TE>
<TE>   No conclusions have been reached yet.</TE>
<TE>   "This is very complicated; a lot of issues are in play," said Rick
Grebner, an OCTA project manager. "It's too early to definitively say
what caused this. Our focus has been on fixing the road and getting
it into service."</TE>
<TE>   Caltrans contends that the designer and the builder are
responsible for the damage and must make repairs.</TE>
<TE>   The transportation department has given both firms until the end
of the month to find a solution.</TE>
<TE>   The builder and design firm have agreed to do the repair work but
under protest. Both have given notice that they intend to file claims
against Caltrans. At issue is whether the agency's design guidelines
for the bridge were adequate.</TE>
<TE>   Representatives for C.C. Myers of Rancho Cordova declined to
comment and referred all inquiries to Caltrans.</TE>
<TE>   Tom Peters, a spokesman for CH2M Hill, defended the international
engineering firm's track record, saying it has planned many
successful bridge projects in California.</TE>
<TE>   "We designed the bridge to every professional standard," Peters
said. "We are still exploring all the options for repair. I'm
confident we are making good progress. Something should be
forthcoming in the next few weeks."</TE>
<TE>   If two of the three spans must be torn down and completely
rebuilt, C.C. Myers has estimated, it would cost $8.3 million and
take about 10 months.</TE>
<TE>   Caltrans records show, however, that other options are under
discussion. They include replacing the damaged girders.</TE>
<TE>   Freider Seible, a highly regarded bridge expert and dean of UC San
Diego's engineering department who is a consultant to OCTA, proposed
the girder replacement during a meeting with project engineers Oct.
22.</TE>
<TE>   According to the report, Seible thought the work could be done in
segments, one girder at a time. If such repairs were made, Caltrans
officials noted, it would be a first in their experience. Seible
declined to comment on the report or his recommendations.</TE>
<TE>   Also under consideration is the builder's repair plan. C.C. Myers
project manager Bob Schneider said the concrete could be fixed using
heavy-duty bolts, short beams and giant washers. Those methods, he
said, could be combined with reinforced concrete, more steel cables
and epoxy.</TE>

<HD>Trash Talk on Trial in South Gate</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>South Gate Treasurer Albert Robles packs emotional wallops with his
words. His verbal jabs -- he called one opponent a hallucinating dog
with rabies -- are insulting, colorful, profane.</LD>
<LD>   But criminal?</LD>
<LD>   In a trial that will spotlight the rough and tumble, trash-talking
world of southeast Los Angeles County politics, prosecutors will try
to prove that Robles crossed the line from politician to thug by
threatening to kill two state legislators, a political consultant and
a police lieutenant.</LD>
<TE>   The trial, scheduled to start today, in Norwalk, will feature a
who's who of region politics: the legislators who claim they feared
for their lives; political allies of Robles, who say his bark is
worse than his bite; and possibly Robles himself.</TE>
<TE>   The volatile, 37-year-old politician makes no secret of his
contempt for the man prosecuting him: Dist. Atty. Steve Cooley.</TE>
<TE>   At a recent conference of public officials, Robles, according to
Cooley, formed his hand into a gun-like gesture and pointed it at
him. Cooley said it was a "macho, in-your-face" challenge.</TE>
<TE>   Robles denies making the gesture. He accuses Cooley of being the
real bully by abusing his office in an effort to destroy him.</TE>
<TE>   "He is using the power of government to teach me a lesson on who
is more macho," said Robles in a recent interview.</TE>
<TE>   Robles' legal team dismisses the threats case as a politically
motivated plot by Cooley and the legislators: Sen. Martha Escutia
(D-Whittier) and Assemblyman Marco Antonio Firebaugh (D-Los Angeles).</TE>
<TE>   His attorneys have also argued that the threats, even if they were
uttered, are a form of constitutionally protected political speech,
albeit "discourteous" and "rude."</TE>
<TE>   "I guess that's exactly, unfortunately, what we expect from
politicians of this country from time to time," said George B.
Newhouse, a city attorney at a recent court hearing. "It wasn't like
... Robles was making this statement about some person who happened
to be a citizen."</TE>
<TE>   Such arguments are preposterous, prosecutors contend. They have
portrayed Robles as a streetwise criminal whose threats pollute the
region's political discourse. Free speech protections, they say, do
not extend to death threats.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a very simple case about statements made by one person
threatening violence against other individuals," said Deputy Dist.
Atty. Jennifer Snyder.</TE>
<TE>   Since his arrest, Robles has stepped up his public profile. Even
with the court case looming, he has extended his considerable
influence in South Gate and continues to stir passions inside and
outside the city.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors contend that Robles has engaged in a pattern of
intimidation against several police witnesses. In August, a judge
took the unusual step of barring Robles from entering the city's
police department.</TE>
<TE>   The trial could change the course of the city, as it comes one
month before the date of a voter recall election targeting Robles.</TE>
<TE>   The trial will likely hinge on the testimony of several witnesses
who heard Robles make the alleged threats.</TE>
<TE>   None were made directly to the victims. Prosecutors say Robles
told the statements to people he knew would relay them.</TE>
<TE>   Robles allegedly told two witnesses that he would rape Escutia and
kill her husband, Leo Briones, a political consultant, if he could
get away with it.</TE>
<TE>   Robles also allegedly told another witness that he wanted to take
Firebaugh to Tijuana where he would put him in the trunk of a car and
"blow his ... brains out," according to a witness interview by
investigators.</TE>
<TE>   Under state law, a person is guilty of making a threat if the
target takes it as a threat, even if there is no intent of carrying
it out. Prosecutors said the victims took the threats seriously,
especially since they believed Robles was behind other unsolved
crimes in the city, including the 1999 shooting of Councilman Henry
Gonzalez. Gonzalez recovered from his wound, and Robles has never
been charged in the attack.</TE>
<TE>   Escutia hired bodyguards; the police lieutenant, Vincent Avila,
said he started carrying his gun at all hours. Firebaugh said he
avoided conflict with Robles for fear of physical retaliation.</TE>
<TE>   Among the witnesses who allegedly heard threats: Francisco Leal,
an attorney for some neighboring municipalities; businessman Mark
Kudler; Fernando Pedroza, a Lynwood councilman; and Martha Hernandez,
Robles' former girlfriend.</TE>
<TE>   Their testimony will be challenged on several fronts. Leal,
according to court documents, told investigators that he didn't
believe Robles' statements about Firebaugh were significant, and that
Robles appeared to be "blowing off steam."</TE>
<TE>   Kudler and Pedroza, according to court documents, have refused to
cooperate with investigators since their initial interviews: Pedroza,
because he thinks it would cause a "feud" between Lynwood and South
Gate; and Kudler, because he fears it could negatively impact his
billboard display business. They are expected to be hostile witnesses
for the prosecution.</TE>
<TE>   Witnesses who may testify on Robles' behalf include Assemblyman
Mervyn M. Dymally (D-Compton) and South Gate Mayor Xochilt Ruvalcaba.</TE>
<TE>   Robles' attorneys contend the case stems from Robles' heated
opposition to a power plant that was slated to be built in the city.
Robles successfully opposed the legislators, who are now trying to
retaliate against Robles, say his attorneys.</TE>
<TE>   Robles was arrested in April, three months after investigators
raided his home and found numerous weapons, including a semiautomatic
assault rifle. He faces seven felony counts relating to the alleged
threats. He also faces two illegal weapons charges that are scheduled
to be heard in a separate trial.</TE>

<HD>Portrait of the Con Artist as a Young Man</HD>
<DH>Frank Abagnale's teen crimes landed him in prison. Now a
successful security expert, he's wary of attention from a film about
his youth.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bob Baker</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Frank Abagnale, who is about to become America's most popular con
man, is standing in a darkened auditorium in downtown L.A., scaring
the bejesus out of a couple hundred business people. He has been
talking in a calm, quick, flawless cadence for more than two hours,
flashing his 140 slide projections on a big screen, listing every
manner of fraud that could befall these men and women: forgery,
embezzlement, bogus checks, identity theft.</LD>
<LD>   As the litany of scam rises, Abagnale's pace accelerates even
more. He recites the con man's inner monologues. He acts out
dialogues between criminal and victim. He tells the audience which
brands of tape, nail polish, laser printer and paper stock crooks
employ to forge or alter checks, what Web sites they use to steal
someone's identity, how they look over a shopper's shoulder to grab
critical data, how they take advantage of human naivete.</LD>
<LD>   This is powerful stuff not merely because of who Abagnale is -- a
54-year-old consultant who pulls in $15,000 per lecture -- but
because of who he was: a notoriously creative teenage check forger
and impersonator in the 1960s.</LD>
<TE>   Soured by his parents' divorce, Abagnale ran away from home in New
York at 16 and turned his considerable intellect to passing, by his
estimate, $2.5 million worth of bad checks over the next five years.
He was motivated at first by the raw craving for money to spend on
girls. As he improved the craft of creating counterfeit checks, he
assumed a series of trustworthy identities in order to cash them and
evade capture: airline pilot, doctor, lawyer, professor. By the time
he was 21, the FBI had him. He spent four years behind bars, then
began lending his expertise to vulnerable businesses. He wrote one
book in 1980 about his cons and another last year about how to avoid
being conned.</TE>
<TE>   Abagnale enjoys a high profile within business and law enforcement
communities, including the FBI Academy, where he frequently lectures
on white-collar crime. But beginning Christmas Day, the young Frank
will overtake middle-aged Frank as Leonardo DiCaprio becomes Abagnale
in "Catch Me If You Can," director Steven Spielberg's comedic
dramatization of Abagnale's teen spree.</TE>
<TE>   The young Frank would have relished the attention -- the thrill of
being the latest non-celebrity lionized by a Hollywood biopic,
joining folks like Erin Brockovich, David Helfgott ("Shine"), John
Nash ("A Beautiful Mind") and Jim Morris ("The Rookie").</TE>
<TE>   The middle-aged Frank -- the one who tells his audiences that
fraud has skyrocketed because of society's ethical deterioration --
has been wary of the buzz. In September, before he saw a cut of the
film, he was so worried studio promotion would glorify his crimes
James Bond-style that he disavowed young Frank on his business Web
site. ("I consider my past immoral, unethical and illegal. It is
something I am not proud of.")</TE>
<TE>   He now praises Spielberg and DiCaprio for capturing the sadness
and moral quandaries of his youth as well as the manic excitement.
Yet he's still bothered by the idea that he'll soon be recognized any
time he hands his credit card to a hotel reservation clerk. He
settled long ago in Tulsa, Okla., where he's been married for 26
years and is the father of three sons in college. "I like to wash my
cars in front of my home on weekends," he says in a restrained tone
that has little trace of New York. "I like to garden. I like doing
what I do for a living."</TE>
<TE>   With no financial stake in the picture, he's told Spielberg's
DreamWorks to limit his media exposure, but it figures to be a losing
battle. There's an irresistible conflict between the boy and man, and
on this day, in Abagnale's speech inside L.A.'s exclusive Jonathan
Club, that tension resonates with each of his pronouncements.</TE>
<TE>   " Today, 60% of all transactions are still paid by check. The
check is king....What many Americans don't understand is that many of
those checks are no good."</TE>
<TE>   He was 14 when Mom moved out in 1964. He stayed with Dad, an
affluent Manhattan stationery store owner, figuring his father needed
his help. Around the same age he became girl crazy and began putting
thousands of dollars on his unsuspecting father's credit card. Three
thousand dollars later, he wound up for a time in a school for
wayward boys. At 16 he moved out on his own, found that minimum-wage
work was insufficient for his social life, and figured he could get
paid more if he lied about his age.</TE>
<TE>   He was prematurely gray, so when he added 10 years to his resume,
it worked. But money was still too tight, and he was routinely
cashing checks without money in his account, figuring it didn't
matter because he was a kid. Then one day he noticed a group of
airline pilots and thought how easy it would be to cash bad checks in
pilot's garb.</TE>
<TE>   It was a more innocent time, a time when people were far less
inclined to ask for your ID, when an airline asked fewer questions of
a young man who called to say he'd lost his pilot's uniform and
needed another one. Or a kid who called with questions for his high
school newspaper story on pilot procedures and documents. Soon,
Abagnale had obtained a Pan Am uniform, forged an airline ID badge
and FAA pilot's license, and was hitching free jump-seat rides across
the country and staying in hotels where the crews stayed, cashing
bogus checks at banks or airline counters. He started printing his
own checks. He compiled a detailed journal of pilot terminology to
improve his bluffing, and begged off whenever another pilot offered
him a chance to leave the jump seat and take a turn at the controls.</TE>
<TE>   The same mental agility and charm that make him a riveting public
speaker today helped him to quickly adopt new personas and produce
new credentials. "What also helped me a lot was being an adolescent
and having no fear," he said in an interview, "where an adult in the
same situation would have analyzed the hell out of it, worrying about
the consequences." Tall, handsome and friendly, he was, by his
account, a magnet for attractive stewardesses and always on the
lookout for a female bank teller he could innocently chat up for
intelligence.</TE>
<TE>   He had no permanent home. He stayed in motion. Slowing down meant
confronting an inevitable ache. "It was a very lonely life," he says.
"Even though I met all those girls, they all thought I was someone I
wasn't." The pilot's uniform made him special, universally liked and
respected; he used it, he wrote in his 1980 book on conning, the same
way a junkie uses heroin.</TE>
<TE>   "If you believe you have a foolproof system, you have failed to
take into consideration the creativity of fools....There are no
criminals looking for a challenge. They're only looking for
opportunities."</TE>
<TE>   His refinements in his later teens included buying an $8,000
camera that let him duplicate Pan Am expense checks. He improved on
that when he met an Air France stewardess whose father, the owner of
a printing shop in France, unwittingly helped Abagnale print bogus
Pan Am payroll checks. Sometimes he enriched himself through
elemental creativity, like the time he walked into a bank, grabbed a
handful of deposit slips, used press-type lettering to insert his own
account number in the empty space and returned the slips -- meaning
that the people who used them (without noticing the change) were
depositing their money in his account. That netted $40,000 in four
days, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "If I'm going to forge Transamerica checks, I'm going to make two
phone calls -- one to accounts payable, where they'll give me the
account number for wiring instructions and, second, to public
affairs, where I can ask for an annual report, which will contain the
signature of the CEO."</TE>
<TE>   After a couple of years of the pilot scam, Abagnale said, he spent
almost a full year impersonating a pediatrician in Georgia. It
started innocently -- he was trying to lie low, and called himself a
doctor on an apartment rental application. Neighbors introduced him
to a hospital administrator, who asked him to supervise a ward and,
unwilling to give himself away, he complied, never having to make a
crucial medical decision. Forging credentials subsequently enabled
him to pass, for shorter times, as a college professor (he taught
sociology) and a Harvard-trained lawyer.</TE>
<TE>   Abagnale said that after passing counterfeit checks in every U.S.
state and two dozen other countries, he was arrested in France,
served half a year, was extradited to Sweden, served several months
there, and was returned to the U.S. He escaped off the plane in New
York, returned to Georgia, was arrested by the FBI in an Atlanta
suburb, escaped again and was arrested for good in New York a month
later. He was sentenced to 12 years in federal prison and served
three -- earning his GED and taking some college-level courses --
before being paroled to Houston.</TE>
<TE>   Once free, he chafed in a series of dead-end jobs. Then, thanks to
the suggestion of his parole officer, and with help from the FBI
agent who had arrested him in Georgia, Abagnale was steered into
consulting jobs with law enforcement. That led to his first
private-sector client, Target, and a new career. He got married and,
looking for a quieter place to raise children, moved to Oklahoma. His
clients have ranged from banks to title insurance companies to
high-security printing companies to Australian businesses worried
about fraud during the 2000 Olympics.</TE>
<TE>   Abagnale's gift is "his uncanny ability to look at a [fraud]
situation and say, 'Well, this is how a person did it and this is
what I'd do to make sure nothing like it happens again,' " said
Phillip Desing, supervisory special agent at the FBI Academy's
Investigative Training Division. "He's about as close to brilliant as
you can get." Desing said Abagnale has never accepted compensation
for his lectures to new and veteran FBI agents.</TE>
<TE>   Abagnale sold his movie rights to a screenwriter in the late '70s,
but the project traded hands without taking shape. Four years ago it
began to jell in a screenplay by Jeff Nathanson ("Rush Hour 2") that
eventually attracted DiCaprio.</TE>
<TE>   That, in turn, attracted DreamWorks film chief and co-producer
Walter Parkes. When a late draft of the script made its way to
DreamWorks co-owner Spielberg, he told Parkes he'd like to direct.
With Spielberg came Tom Hanks to play an FBI agent who pursues
Abagnale throughout the film. Hanks' character is a composite of
Abagnale's parole officer and the agent who arrested him in Georgia,
Joe Shea. (Shea, 83, who worked the case only briefly, was reunited
with Abagnale at a convention of former FBI agents two decades ago,
and the two remain friends.)</TE>
<TE>   Abagnale said that at DiCaprio's invitation, he spent two days at
the actor's house before shooting began this spring, and soon had a
meeting with Spielberg. He said his confidence in the director's
ability to capture the emotional truth grew when Spielberg
volunteered that he too had been a teenager when his parents
divorced.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a devastating thing," said Abagnale, whose father died in
1974 after trying unsuccessfully for years to win back his wife. He
is convinced that the departure of his mother, now 75 and living in
New York, was the central cause of his teenage rootlessness, a theme
the movie hits far harder than his book. The two speak weekly, but
"she knows I'll go to my grave thinking that....Every child needs its
mother, and every child needs its father. I don't care what people
say."</TE>
<TE>   Suppose young Frank had never veered from the straight and narrow?
"I think I would have gone to college. I think I would have been a
very successful entrepreneur....Luckily, I was creative and did these
things to support myself. But it was always on the run, doing it just
to stay ahead."</TE>
<TE>   He saw the movie, which claims merely to have been "inspired" by
actual events, two weeks ago in Spielberg's office. "It was hard for
me to take it all in at once. It was so surreal."</TE>
<TE>   What does middle-aged Frank want people to take away from young
Frank's story? "Man, this guy did some incredible things -- but I
wouldn't want it to happen to me."</TE>

<LD>Sri Lanka and the Tamil Tigers agreed to develop a government that
would give the rebel group regional autonomy, a breakthrough capping
months of efforts to end 19 years of fighting.</LD>
<LD>   The Tamil Tigers have been waging a battle for independence since
1983, but they gave up the demand just ahead of the third round of
peace talks in Oslo.</LD>
<LD>   Now both sides have agreed to pursue peace by allowing the
Tamil-dominated regions in the north and east of the country to
govern themselves autonomously, according to a draft of a joint
statement.</LD>

<LD>   About 50 of the 66 inmates at the Mariestad prison initially
refused to return to their cells at bedtime Monday when the prison
lost the signal to Kanal 5, a Swedish channel carried on cable or

technician adjusted the prison's receiver.</LD>

<HD>Bush Praises Virtues of Islamic Faith</HD>
<DH>During a visit to a Washington mosque, the president
continues his drive to counteract animosity in the Muslim world
toward the U.S.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>James Gerstenzang</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Faced with a negative perception of the United States in the Islamic
world, President Bush visited a mosque Thursday as his administration
sought to deepen support for the international campaign against
terrorism.</LD>
<LD>   His trip through snowy streets to the Islamic Center of Washington
reflected what the White House has presented as a constant theme
since the Sept. 11 attacks -- the importance of reaching out to
Muslims, made all the more meaningful as the confrontation with Iraq
grows more tense.</LD>
<LD>   A poll released Wednesday by the Pew Research Center said that the
United States is held in disfavor in the Islamic world and, in
particular, that it faces severe opposition within two important
Islamic allies, Pakistan and Turkey.</LD>
<TE>   Marking the confluence of Hanukkah, the end of the holy month of
Ramadan that is celebrated with the feast of Eid al-Fitr and the
arrival of the Christmas season, Bush paid homage to Judaism, Islam
and Christianity over a 24-hour period, using each ceremonial stop to
promote his anti-terrorism agenda.</TE>
<TE>   And in a meeting with two African leaders, President Daniel Arap
Moi of Kenya and Prime Minister Meles Zenawi of Ethiopia, he related
the theme to the tinderbox Horn of Africa.</TE>
<TE>   "The war on terror is global in nature," he said, noting that "if
the terrorists could strike in Kenya, they could strike in Ethiopia,
they could strike in Europe."</TE>
<TE>   Although his remarks throughout the day echoed what has become a
central focus of his presidency -- the refusal of the United States
and its allies to knuckle under to the threat of terrorism -- his
efforts Thursday suggested the extent to which he needs to reach out
to the Islamic world.</TE>
<TE>   The poll found, for example, that 83% of the Turks surveyed oppose
the use of their country's military bases to strike Iraq. Turkey,
sitting on Iraq's northern border, is expected to have an important
role in the event of war, helping the United States engage Iraqi
forces on a second front.</TE>
<TE>   In Pakistan, the percentage of those holding a favorable view of
the United States slipped from 23% to 10% over barely two years, as
the United States has taken on a dramatically increased presence in
the region after last year's terrorist attacks and the subsequent
military operation that deposed the Taliban rulers in neighboring
Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   At a news briefing Thursday, White House Press Secretary Ari
Fleischer said Bush has acknowledged that in "some areas in the
Muslim world ... the United States has a job to do, and we have to
bring people together between the United States and the Muslim
world." But in some other areas, he said, the poll showed favorable
impressions of the United States.</TE>
<TE>   Fleischer also pointed out that the United States had won Syria's
assent to U.N. Security Council Resolution 1441, authorizing the
dispatch of weapons inspectors to Iraq. But he said he would not
predict whether Syria would go beyond that vote, a reference to the
question mark hanging over the Arab world's support for a U.S.-led
war with Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   The president visited what he called "this beautiful mosque" at
the Islamic Center at midday, taking yet another step in the
administration's campaign to counteract animosity in the Islamic
world toward the United States.</TE>
<TE>   Bush also visited the mosque six days after the attacks on New
York and the Pentagon in the initial effort to reach out to Muslims
when they were the target of attacks and threats across the country.</TE>
<TE>   As night fell, Bush, in a topcoat and tan cowboy hat, threw the
switch to light a Christmas tree on the Ellipse, between the White
House and the Washington Monument. And on Wednesday evening, on the
ground floor of the White House, he stood by as two young girls
lighted a menorah on the sixth night of Hanukkah, also known as the
Festival of Lights.</TE>
<TE>   The president's message at the mosque served to reinforce his
effort to reach out to Muslims here and abroad, drawing attention to
what he presented as the generosity and morality of Islam.</TE>
<TE>   "Millions of our fellow Americans practice the Muslim faith; they
lead lives of honesty and justice and compassion," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "The spirit behind this holiday is a reminder that Islam brings
hope and comfort to more than a billion people worldwide. Islam
affirms God's justice and insists on man's moral responsibility."</TE>
<TE>   The meeting with the leaders of Kenya and Ethiopia followed a week
after the attacks in Mombasa, the Kenyan port where 16 people were
killed in a car bombing at a hotel that caters to Israelis and an
attempt was made to bring down an Israeli airliner.</TE>
<TE>   The president said Wednesday that the attack was the work of the
Al Qaeda terrorist network, but he presented no specific evidence.</TE>
<TE>   With the two leaders joining him in the Cabinet room, Bush said
Moi and Meles were "two steadfast allies ... when it comes to winning
the first war of the 21st century."</TE>
<TE>   He said the United States was "pleased with the
information-sharing we're getting from our allies here."</TE>

<HD>Dozens of Bush Fires Menace Sydney Area</HD>
<DH>Winds and drought combine to aid spread of the blazes.
Hundreds are forced to flee homes.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SYDNEY, Australia</DL>
<LD>Bush fires raged out of control today around Sydney, forcing hundreds
of people to flee their homes as firefighters struggled to contain
the flames.</LD>
<LD>   Overnight, strong, hot winds fanned more than 60 fires around
Australia's largest city, including one in a park just six miles from
downtown. Rain in some areas and a change in wind direction failed to
extinguish the flames. The area is in the midst of a severe drought.</LD>
<LD>   An intense blaze sprang up in the Blue Mountains, 55 miles west of
Sydney, late Thursday, destroying one home and forcing hundreds of
evacuations. Another spread into a national park that leads through
rugged and inaccessible bush toward some of Sydney's most affluent
northern beachside suburbs.</LD>
<TE>   "That has caused some significant problems because now we are
going to have to [go] down into the bush areas to try and contain
that fire," fire service spokesman John Winter told Australian
Broadcasting Corp. radio.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the infernos, only three homes were destroyed Thursday, as
3,000 firefighters beat back flames with the help of aircraft
dropping water and the aid of homeowners armed with hoses, buckets
and wet towels.</TE>
<TE>   Winter said 18 homes had been razed since the latest round of
fires erupted Wednesday afternoon. That estimate was down from the
more than 30 that had been reported previously.</TE>
<TE>   "The immediate environs of Sydney have probably not faced a threat
like this for 20 to 30 years," said New South Wales state Rural Fire
Service Commissioner Phil Koperberg. "We're going to be in trouble in
New South Wales until it rains."</TE>
<TE>   The fires closed major highways into Sydney, stranding hundreds of
evening commuters.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the blazes were caused by arson. Police said they arrested
an 18-year-old student and charged him with starting one of the fires
Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Others are believed to have been started by people tossing
cigarette butts out of car windows -- an offense officials said could
draw a 14-year prison sentence.</TE>
<TE>   Bob Crowley, who has lived in Dural, northwest Sydney, for 15
years, watched in horror and amazement as flames swept over his home
but left it virtually unscathed.</TE>
<TE>   "All of a sudden the wind blew a big firestorm over the top.
Everyone was running for their lives. We are just lucky the wind
changed and saved us," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "My skin was burning as I was running. I have never been scared in
my life like that."</TE>

<HD>Inspectors Can Refute U.S. Claims, Hussein Says</HD>
<DH>Iraqi leader contends that U.N. teams are being given the
'proper chance to disprove' allegations.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>BAGHDAD</DL>
<LD>Iraqi President Saddam Hussein said in his first public comments
since U.N. inspectors returned that he would give them a chance to
disprove U.S. accusations that Baghdad had weapons of mass
destruction.</LD>
<LD>   "Some might claim we didn't give [the inspectors] the proper
chance to disprove the American allegations that Iraq produced
weapons of mass destruction during the period of the inspectors'
absence," Hussein said in remarks broadcast Thursday on Iraqi
television.</LD>
<LD>   "For that reason we shall provide them with such a chance, after
which, if the weaklings remain weak and the cowardly remain cowards,
then we shall take the stand that befits our people, principles and
mission," he told Iraqi officials as he congratulated them on Eid
al-Fitr, one of the most festive days of the Muslim year.</LD>
<TE>   In Washington, the White House said it had intelligence, not all
of which had been turned over to the U.N. inspectors, that Iraq
maintained chemical, biological and nuclear arms programs.</TE>
<TE>   Washington has urged the United Nations inspectors, who returned
to Iraq on Nov. 27, to be more aggressive in their hunt for weapons.</TE>
<TE>   The inspectors have reported cooperation from Iraq in their visits
to 20 sites so far.</TE>
<TE>   No inspections were taking place Thursday or today because of the
Eid al-Fitr holiday, but all eyes were on this weekend's U.N.
deadline for Iraq to officially report on its arms programs. Under a
U.N. Security Council resolution that its signatories hoped would
avert war, Iraq must produce a full list of its weapons programs.
Iraq says that, since it has no arms of mass destruction, it will
merely be listing "dual-use technology" that has peaceful as well as
military applications.</TE>

provincial capital of Ujungpandang, about 900 miles east of Jakarta,
the Indonesian capital, said police Sgt. Hidayat, who uses only one
name.</LD>
<LD>   Bomb blasts have occurred as part of the running conflict between
Muslims and Christians on Sulawesi island. Since 1999, hundreds have
died in the fighting.</LD>
<TE>   No one took responsibility for the blasts, Hidayat said, adding
that authorities had not ruled out an accidental explosion. Hidayat
also refused to say what caused the blast at the car dealership,
owned by Indonesian Welfare Minister Yusuf Kalla.</TE>
<TE>   All the victims were at the McDonald's restaurant in a shopping
mall.</TE>

<HD>Focus Shifts to Iraq's Arms List</HD>
<DH>U.S. and U.N. analysts are set to assess how Baghdad
accounts for its alleged illicit weapons.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bob Drogin and Doyle McManus</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>U.S. and U.N. experts are poised this weekend to quickly assess
Baghdad's first formal accounting in four years of any weapons of
mass destruction in its arsenal, a potential tripwire for an American
invasion of Iraq.</LD>
<LD>   Although Iraq continues to insist it has no such weapons, it has
promised to meet a Sunday deadline to give the U.N. Security Council
a "full and complete declaration" of efforts to develop nuclear
bombs, produce deadly biological microbes or chemical warfare agents,
or build ballistic missiles.</LD>
<LD>   A team of analysts assembled by a highly skeptical Bush
administration will be looking for what the Iraqis say about how they
disposed of hundreds of tons of raw materials for blister and nerve
gases, details of Iraq's program to develop the deadly VX nerve agent
and proof that Iraq has destroyed stocks of deadly biological agents,
among other things.</LD>
<TE>   "A lot will depend on how long the list is and what's on it -- or
not on it," a senior U.S. official said. Another U.S. official said
the CIA had helped prepare a closely held checklist "of what we think
we should be hearing."</TE>
<TE>   The team of experts is poised to scour the expected deluge of
Arabic and English documents. It may take several weeks to fully
translate and analyze the material, but U.S. officials hope to
identify any glaring inconsistencies and omissions much faster.</TE>
<TE>   "There are men and women who have lived and breathed this stuff
for years," another U.S. official said. "They can breeze through this
thing and put Post-it notes on inaccuracies."</TE>
<TE>   U.S. and U.N. officials view the Iraqi declaration as a crucial
test of Iraq's stated intention to cooperate with the U.N. resolution
calling for Baghdad to disarm. Most expect Iraq to comply enough to
avoid imminent attack but to inject as much ambiguity into the
process as possible.</TE>
<TE>   Thus, officials said, Baghdad is likely to admit details of some
new weapons but insist that it has destroyed the materials since U.N.
inspectors left the country in 1998. It may try to hide other
programs, however, or disguise them in a flood of peripheral or
misleading documents.</TE>
<TE>   "It will probably be semi-false or semi-true," the senior official
said.</TE>
<TE>   Among the key concerns:</TE>
<TE>   * The disposition of about 700 tons of raw materials for blister
and nerve gases, or enough to fill about 6,000 bombs. A document
found at an Iraqi air force base in July 1998 indicated that Baghdad
had produced far more chemical weapons -- listed as khass, Arabic for
"special" -- than it has admitted.</TE>
<TE>   * Details about Iraq's program to produce, put into a weapon and
deploy VX, a highly toxic nerve agent. Iraq repeatedly changed its
declarations on VX before 1998 but never admitted producing it in
weapon form. U.S. officials are convinced, based on Defense
Department laboratory tests of residue found in a missile warhead,
that it did.</TE>
<TE>   * Proof of Iraq's claims that it unilaterally destroyed stocks of
such deadly biological agents as anthrax and botulinum toxin. Baghdad
has made this claim, but it never provided evidence to U.N.
inspectors, who believe Iraq imported far more bacterial growth
nutrients than it needed for the programs it declared.</TE>
<TE>   * An explanation for Iraq's repeated attempts since 1998 to
secretly buy and import uranium and specialized equipment --
including aluminum tubes, vacuum pumps and ring magnets -- that may
be for nuclear weapons development. Iraq has denied seeking nuclear
weapons.</TE>
<TE>   The final analysis of how much Baghdad is actually disclosing will
be a pivotal part of deliberations in Washington, London and other
capitals as leaders consider whether military action will be needed
to disarm Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   If the weekend declaration is viewed as utterly false or
inadequate, U.S. officials are likely to seek Security Council
support for the use of force. President Bush, asked Thursday if the
United States is headed toward war, replied, "That's a question you
should ask to Saddam Hussein."</TE>
<TE>   Speaking during a Cabinet Room meeting with visiting leaders of
Kenya and Ethiopia, Bush said the Iraqi president must disarm "for
the sake of peace."</TE>
<TE>   Iraqi officials have indicated that they will hand over the
declaration -- expected to be a narrative and supporting material
totaling at least 1,000 pages -- to U.N. weapons inspectors in
Baghdad late Saturday. The material then would be flown to U.N.
headquarters in New York by Sunday night.</TE>
<TE>   The U.N. Monitoring, Verification and Inspection Commission, known
as UNMOVIC, has assigned a 15-member team in New York to study the
material, according to spokesman Ewen Buchanan. "Our division of
analysis and assessment will be very busy next week," he said.</TE>
<TE>   In Washington, analysts and experts from the White House National
Security Council, the CIA, the State Department, the Pentagon and
other key U.S. agencies will compare the new material to previous
U.N. inspection reports and recent U.S. intelligence, including
satellite photos, electronic intercepts, smuggling records and
defectors' reports.</TE>
<TE>   "Someone who is very familiar with the subject could get to the
essentials pretty quickly," said Terrence Taylor, a former U.N.
inspector who heads the Washington branch of the International
Institute of Strategic Studies.</TE>
<TE>   "My guess is the Iraqis will give enough new information to stave
off any excuse for immediate military action," Taylor added. "They've
done this before. They'll give up some and try to hide the rest."</TE>
<TE>   Iraq's record on weapons declarations is not promising.</TE>
<TE>   In August 1991, it was ordered to provide a "full, final and
complete" accounting of its weapons programs. Over the next seven
years, it submitted five supposedly final declarations for biological
weapons, three for chemical weapons, three for missile programs and
several more for nuclear weapons.</TE>
<TE>   "After you get one final declaration after another, you begin to
wonder what's really final," said Ron Cleminson, a retired Canadian
military officer who has worked on Iraqi inspections since 1991 and
is a member of a U.N. oversight panel for the current effort.</TE>
<TE>   "We began calling them full, final and complete fairy tales," said
Tim Trevan, a former special advisor to the chief U.N. weapons
inspector. "We lost count after a while."</TE>
<TE>   A 1999 U.N. report ultimately listed more than 100 major questions
that were not answered by the assorted declarations or by
on-the-ground inspections. U.N. officials will examine the new
documents to see if those outstanding issues are resolved.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. officials flatly assert that Iraq has illegal weapons but
have not publicly disclosed clear evidence.</TE>
<TE>   "The president of the United States and the secretary of Defense
would not assert as plainly and as bluntly as they have that Iraq has
weapons of mass destruction if it was not true, and if they did not
have a solid basis for saying it," White House spokesman Ari
Fleischer said Thursday. "The Iraqi government has proved time and
time again to deceive, to mislead and to lie."</TE>
<TE>   The U.N. resolution requires Iraq to disclose all aspects of its
weapons programs, including stockpiles, components, production
facilities, locations, purchasing and procurement networks and
command-and- control systems.</TE>
<TE>   For the first time, the U.N. requires Iraq to provide details
about its civilian chemical, biological and nuclear programs, not
just those related to military weapons. Such "dual-use" programs and
materials conceivably could include Iraq's vast petrochemical
industry, its hospitals, pesticide plants and hundreds of other
facilities.</TE>
<TE>   Previous declarations were only given to the U.N. weapons
inspection commission and the International Atomic Energy Agency,
which is responsible for nuclear weapons.</TE>
<TE>   The new Iraqi declaration also will be given to Security Council
members, which means details are likely to become public -- and thus
politicized -- much more quickly.</TE>
<TE>   Inspectors have spent the last week searching suspect weapons
sites in and around Baghdad, including a top-secret missile
development plant, several breweries and a heavily guarded palace
that previously was off limits to inspectors. Although some equipment
was missing, no major violations were reported.</TE>
<TE>   The pace of the inspections is expected to pick up in coming weeks
as the Iraqi declaration is examined. More U.N. inspectors are due to
arrive in Baghdad this weekend, with plans for 100 by Christmas.</TE>
<TE>   Hans Blix, head of the U.N. inspection team, must report to the
Security Council on Iraq's compliance by Jan. 26. U.S. officials,
however, have urged the U.N. to speed up the inspections.</TE>

<HD>After Much Hope, Israel and Egypt Are Distant Neighbors</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>David Lamb</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>CAIRO</DL>
<LD>CAIRO -- The loneliest diplomatic job in Egypt these days belongs to
Gideon Benami, the Israeli ambassador, who has been isolated by the
deterioration of relations between two countries that signed a peace
treaty 23 years ago.</LD>
<LD>   With President Hosni Mubarak having recalled his ambassador to
Jerusalem and frozen contacts with Israel, Benami finds himself cut
off at his heavily guarded downtown embassy and his residence in
suburban Maadi. Egyptian officials are largely inaccessible to him,
and even friendly countries sometimes drop him from the guest list
because mixing Israeli and Arab diplomats could make for an
uncomfortable gathering.</LD>
<LD>   Demonstrators call for Benami's expulsion, and drivers honk as
they pass his residence to annoy him. A song titled "I Hate Israel"
rose to the top of Egypt's pop charts, and a brand of potato chips
became a bestseller after putting a picture of Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat on the package, even though Egyptians have no
particular fondness for Arafat. Political cartoons depict Israeli
Prime Minister Ariel Sharon as a Nazi storm trooper.</LD>
<TE>   The Israeli Embassy has reduced its number of accredited envoys
from six to four. Without access to Egyptian officials, intellectuals
and journalists, they have few normal functions of diplomacy to carry
out. No Egyptian reporters call the Israeli press attache because,
given the current climate, Egyptians have no interest in the Israeli
view.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think there is any point in continuing with the peace
treaty," said travel agent Osama Mohamed Ahmad, 24, who, like many
Arabs, speaks of Israel and the U.S. in the same breath. "What did
the treaty give us? Nothing. Innocent Palestinians are still be
killed, settlements are still being built, and now they want to bomb
Iraq."</TE>
<TE>   Ahmad may be too young to have much recollection, but the treaty
did get Egypt back its land -- the Sinai Peninsula -- and perhaps
spared him and his friends from having to go off to fight another
war. Despite all the regional tensions today, no Arab armies are
massing on Israel's borders and no Egyptian officials entertain the
thought of abrogating the treaty or severing relations with Israel,
whose existence is accepted, at least publicly, by every Arab state,
except Libya and perhaps Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   "Peace between Egypt and Israel remains the bedrock of U.S.
security policy in the Middle East and the Gulf," said Nicholas A.
Veliotes, a former U.S. ambassador to Egypt and Jordan. "The treaty
has withstood the shock of Sharon's invasion of Lebanon in 1982 and
the continuous TV reports of bloodshed and suffering in Palestine....
It will also withstand whatever differences we may have with Egypt
over Iraq, including war."</TE>
<TE>   The crisis in Arab-Israeli relations today stands in stark
contrast to the mood a decade ago when the psychological barriers of
fear and mistrust were slowly being dismantled after half a century
of warfare. The Oslo peace accords had been signed, in 1993, clearing
the way for Palestinian sovereignty over parts of the West Bank and
the Gaza Strip. There was widespread belief in the Arab world that
peace with Israel was inevitable.</TE>
<TE>   Israel had opened diplomatic interest sections in Morocco and
Oman. Israeli officials participated in regional conferences in a few
Arab countries. More than 150,000 Israeli tourists a year were
filling Egypt's Red Sea resorts. The Arab boycott of companies that
did business with Israel had crumbled. The term "Zionist entity" in
Arab newspapers had been replaced by the word "Israel." Hardly an
echo remained of the vow Gamal Abdel Nasser, the Egyptian leader, had
made in the 1950s "to drive the Jews in the sea."</TE>
<TE>   "The momentum toward peace is irreversible," Andre Azoulay, the
senior advisor to the Moroccan leader at the time, King Hassan II,
said then. In Cairo, a foreign ministry official, Nabil Fahmy, who is
now Egypt's ambassador to the United States, was asked if he foresaw
any scenario in which the region might step backward into the
hate-filled days of the Nasser era. He replied: "Returning to the
traditional Arab-Israeli conflict is virtually impossible. So many
mistakes would have to be made on both sides for that to happen that
the question is really hypothetical."</TE>
<TE>   The ongoing violence has slowed whatever relations had begun. The
Israeli-interest sections in Oman and Morocco are now closed.
Jordan's and Egypt's embassies in Israel are without ambassadors. The
intellectual exchange between Arab and Israeli scholars has ended,
the flow of Israeli tourists to the Red Sea resorts has slowed to a
trickle. Trade has dissipated, except for some agricultural products.
What was meant to be the big payoff of the Egyptian-Israeli peace
treaty -- an economic surge that would benefit both sides -- never
materialized.</TE>
<TE>   "Anwar would be very, very sad if he saw where we were today,"
said Sakina Sadat, sister of the late Egyptian president who signed
the Camp David accords with Israel in 1978 and the resulting historic
treaty the next year. "We're in the worst situation you could ever
imagine. Both sides are killing each other every day, the
Palestinians' land is still occupied, and our economy is in a
tailspin because people from all over the world are afraid to visit
the Middle East.</TE>
<TE>   "The opportunities that have been lost are a very big loss. I
remember Anwar meeting with Arafat at the Mena House near the
pyramids after Camp David. He said, 'This time the Israelis are ready
to make peace, ready to talk about ending the Palestinian problem.'
What happened? Arafat insulted Anwar and the Arab League boycotted
Egypt after the peace treaty. If they had only seized the
opportunity, the Palestinians would have had a homeland about 17
years ago and we'd be enjoying an era of peace."</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SIRWAN, Iraq</DL>
<LD>Villagers marked a Muslim holiday Thursday by burying their dead
after dozens were killed in battles for two hilltop positions seized
by an Islamic militant group with suspected ties to Al Qaeda.</LD>
<LD>   In an overnight assault, fighters of the Patriotic Union of
Kurdistan recaptured the hilltops taken by Ansar al-Islam guerrillas
a day earlier, Kurdish commander Sheik Jaffer Mustafa said. One
Kurdish fighter was killed and two others were wounded in the
counterattack, he said.</LD>
<LD>   Kurdish groups say that some Ansar al-Islam militants were trained
by Al Qaeda and have ties to the terrorist group led by Osama bin
Laden.</LD>
<TE>   The battle was the latest in a series of skirmishes between Ansar,
whose fighters include Kurds and Arabs, and the Patriotic Union of
Kurdistan, or PUK, which has sought to drive the extremist militia
from its mountain stronghold on the eastern edge of the Kurdish
autonomous zone in northern Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   Ansar seized the PUK positions near the city of Halabja as the
Kurdish fighters slept Wednesday night, killing nearly 20 and
capturing an equal number, Mustafa said.</TE>
<TE>   The PUK, the de facto authority in northeastern Iraq, shares
control of the Kurdish autonomous zone with its rival, the Kurdistan
Democratic Party. The zone is beyond the authority of the Baghdad
government and is protected by U.S. and British air patrols.</TE>
<TE>   In a village Thursday, funeral processions for PUK fighters
mingled with the festivities of Eid al-Fitr, the Muslim feast that
marks the end of Ramadan.</TE>

<HD>Sharon Moves to Extend West Bank Fence</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM</DL>
<LD>Prime Minister Ariel Sharon has approved plans that would seal off
northern Israel from the West Bank by extending a security fence to
defend against Palestinian attacks, government officials said
Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Construction of the fence began in northern Israel earlier this
year to try to prevent attacks by Palestinian militants spearheading
an uprising for independence.</LD>
<LD>   News that work is to press ahead is likely to further anger
Palestinians.</LD>
<TE>   The fence is expected to cut into West Bank territory in some
areas, shielding Jewish settlements built on land Israel has occupied
since the 1967 Middle East War.</TE>
<TE>   A Defense Ministry official, Netzah Mashiah, said the new, 27-mile
barrier would be built from Megiddo Junction eastward, past the
Gilboa Mountains, to the town of Beit Shean, where Palestinian gunmen
killed six Israelis last week.</TE>
<TE>   "There was a decision in principle to continue the northern
section of the fence. Now they must find the budget resources for it.
The track [for the fence] has been agreed on," said Raanan Gissin, a
spokesman for Sharon.</TE>
<TE>   The fence has drawn the ire both of right-wing Israelis, who say
it is a de facto border shutting out Jewish settlements in the West
Bank from Israel proper, and Palestinians, who say it is an excuse
for Israel to expropriate more of their lands.</TE>
<TE>   The entire $220-million fence project is expected to cover 210
miles, roughly along the lines of the West Bank border before Israel
captured the territory in 1967. Work on the first, 70-mile section
began in June.</TE>
<TE>   Making clear that the fence could in places take over private
Palestinian and Israeli-owned property, Mashiah said: "We are trying
to build it on state lands to shorten the process, but we can't do so
in every place."</TE>

<HD>3 Killed in Consulate in Pakistan</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>KARACHI, Pakistan</DL>
<LD>An explosion at Macedonia's consular offices Thursday and the slaying
of three people whose bodies were found inside may have been the work
of Al Qaeda taking revenge for the killing of seven militant suspects
in the Macedonian capital, police said.</LD>
<LD>   Investigators found messages scrawled on a wall referring to Al
Qaeda and warning against "infidels." The victims -- two men and a
woman -- had their hands and feet bound and their throats slit.</LD>
<LD>   The Macedonian Foreign Ministry called the assault "a
professionally prepared terrorist attack" and instructed its
embassies and consular offices worldwide to boost security. In a
statement, the ministry also expressed "strong bitterness and deep
condolences for the victims," all believed to be Pakistani.</LD>
<TE>   No one claimed responsibility for the killings or the explosion.</TE>
<TE>   The scrawled messages, written in Pakistan's Urdu language, could
signal Al Qaeda's involvement, but they also could have been written
by someone who was trying to divert investigators' attention, said
Tariq Jamil, Karachi's deputy police chief.</TE>
<TE>   Counter-terrorism police were investigating the possibility the
slayings and subsequent explosion may have been in retaliation for
the killing of seven Pakistanis in Macedonia on March 2.</TE>
<TE>   Macedonian police opened fire on a van that tried to drive through
a roadblock in the capital, Skopje, killing seven Pakistanis inside.
Police said they found seven Kalashnikov assault rifles, hand
grenades and ammunition in the van. Officials said the seven had
planned attacks on Western embassies.</TE>

<LD>Former Israeli envoys to peace talks with the Palestinians were
involved in the illegal transfer of $300 million in Palestinian funds
to Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat through a secret
Swiss account, one of the envoys said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon said an investigation was

report dismissed it as "full of baseless information."</LD>
<LD>   The money was transferred from an official Palestinian Authority
account in the West Bank by Arafat and one of his top aides, said
Ozrad Lev, a former assistant to onetime top Israeli envoy Yossi
Ginossar.</LD>
<TE>   Lev said he and Ginossar helped open and manage the Swiss account.
As part of the business dealings, Ginossar made $10 million, Lev

<HD>Turmoil Worsens in Paraguay</HD>
<DH>Lawmakers vote to start impeachment hearings against
president, who vows to defend himself.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>ASUNCION, Paraguay</DL>
<LD>Lawmakers voted Thursday to begin impeachment hearings against
President Luis Gonzalez Macchi, deepening political and economic
turmoil in this troubled South American country.</LD>
<LD>   In a packed session of Paraguay's lower house, opponents of
Gonzalez Macchi accused him of possessing a luxury automobile
reported to be stolen and mishandling millions of dollars in state
funds.</LD>
<LD>   The lower house approved the opening of hearings Thursday by a
vote of 60 to 0, with 11 abstentions and nine lawmakers absent.</LD>
<TE>   The issue now rests with Paraguay's Senate.</TE>
<TE>   No timetable was set for senators to examine the charges lodged by
several congressmen.</TE>
<TE>   A two-thirds majority vote would be needed to remove Gonzalez
Macchi from office.</TE>
<TE>   The president denied the accusations and said he would submit to
the hearings, which are to begin in about two weeks.</TE>
<TE>   "Of course I'll comply, and if necessary I will go before the
Senate to defend myself in person," he said, speaking to Paraguay's
Radio Uno from Brasilia, Brazil, where he is attending a South
American trade group meeting.</TE>
<TE>   The congressional investigation is the latest blow for Gonzalez
Macchi, who is struggling to tame a burgeoning economic crisis in one
of South America's poorest countries. His popularity ratings have
plummeted in recent months.</TE>
<TE>   Paraguay is also home to one of the continent's biggest black
markets, especially for automobiles.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this year, lawmakers opened an investigation into the
luxury BMW driven by the president after a Brazilian insurance
company reported that it belonged to a pharmaceutical company.</TE>
<TE>   Under pressure, Gonzalez Macchi returned the $80,000 vehicle, but
said that he bought it legally.</TE>

<HD>In Japan, Cell Phone-Cameras Click With the Public</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mark Magnier</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>TOKYO</DL>
<LD>TOKYO -- Mayumi Kato uses hers to send photos of herself to her
boyfriend -- several times a day. Masato Kozu keeps his handy in case
he spots a celebrity. And feline-lover Itari Obata enjoys snapping
cats on the street.</LD>
<LD>   Mobile phones with built-in digital cameras are taking Japan by
storm and, amid a proliferation of new uses, bolstering Japan's
reputation as the most advanced and creative cell-phone market in the
world. It is a phenomenon likely to be repeated in the United States,
where picture phones are just starting to appear in advertisements.</LD>
<LD>   "This year's boom in Japan will spread next year to Korea, China
and beyond," said Masahiko Ishino, an analyst at Mitsubishi
Securities. "This is no passing fad. It's something that will be
around for a long time."</LD>
<TE>   Among the attractions of the phones are their simplicity of use
and sleek, compact size. A couple of clicks allow you to take a
photo, store it or send it as a standard e-mail attachment. You can
personalize the photos with written messages, which can be received
by virtually any mobile phone in Japan, with or without a camera, or
any ordinary e-mail anywhere in the world.</TE>
<TE>   "It makes taking pictures easy since you've always got your mobile
phone with you," says Kiyonori Agake, a 36-year-old unemployed
salesman. "I never seem to have a camera on me when I need it."</TE>
<TE>   Finding new uses for the pictures has become something of a
treasure hunt here. Buyers at Tokyo's world famous Tsukiji fish
market's auction beam shots of $15,000 frozen tuna to sushi chefs
across Japan before placing their bids. The Osaka police now get
dozens of cell-phone photos a month from concerned citizens of crime
scenes, stolen cars and suspects. And video microscope firm Scalar
Corp. offers free attachments so customers can send skin and scalp
photographs to beauty centers for an automated analysis.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps inevitably, the new technology has been tapped for matters
of the heart.</TE>
<TE>   People are using the pictures as digital alibis, sending
previously taken shots of themselves at work to a husband or wife
back home, when in reality they're off having an affair.</TE>
<TE>   "One problem is making sure you're wearing the same clothes when
you get home that you wore in the picture," says Atsushi Baba, a
systems engineer.</TE>
<TE>   Matchmakers have embraced the technology as "singles wanted" Web
sites proliferate, allowing people to study cell-phone photos online
before deciding to take the next step. Magazine articles help the
self-conscious with tips on how to look your best in a thumbnail
frame.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't use matchmaking sites these days without Sha-mail,"
said Takenori Kobayashi, a 20-year-old university student, referring
to J-Phone Inc.'s service, the market leader. "If you're a girl
looking for a boy, or vice versa, you've got to have it."</TE>
<TE>   Then there is the seamier side. Japan's active voyeur world is
also using them to take pictures of people without their knowledge,
given how small and easy to hide the handsets are.</TE>
<TE>   Hundreds of Web sites with names like "Sneaky Shot Mania" and
"Erotic Kingdom" have sprung up, plastered with hazy, out-of-focus
shots of lovers in parks, women's legs, schoolgirls on subways.</TE>
<TE>   "Many people steal shots in the trains or under the stairs, which
is why I've held off buying one," Agake says. "If you're a guy, you
could take a shot, there's a misunderstanding and suddenly you find
yourself arrested."</TE>
<TE>   Aware of the potential for abuse, carriers have equipped all
models with a loud ring -- and no "off" switch -- that blares
whenever a photo is taken.</TE>
<TE>   J-Phone's Sha-mail service has been something of a godsend for
this perennial also-ran in Japan's mobile-phone wars. "To be honest,
I never dreamed it would be so successful," said Keiji Takao, the
company's deputy general manager of technology. Two years ago,
J-Phone was lagging behind competitors NTT Corp. and KDDI and badly
in need of an edge. Takao, sometimes called Mr. Sha-mail, remembered
seeing a survey on what teenage girls kept in their purses, namely a
mobile phone, a music player and, frequently, a disposable camera.</TE>
<TE>   With rivals already going after the mobile-tunes market, he
proposed they meld cell phones and cameras. This wasn't brain
surgery, but earlier attempts using bulky attachments and oversized
phones had failed, and J-Phone's timing was fortuitous. Digital
cameras were dropping in price and size, and electronics manufacturer
Sharp was eager to get into the market. After an internal debate, the
company pushed ahead.</TE>
<TE>   After a modest launch in late 2000, J-Phone's volume built
steadily until, by the end of last year, 10,000 users a day were
signing up. "That's when we realized we had a big hit," said Makoto
Iwabayashi, J-Phone's advertising manager.</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't until March 2002 that rivals started piling in. Two KDDI
subsidiaries have joined the fight -- AU offers "Photo Mail" and
"Movie Mail," and Tuka has "Picture Mail" -- and NTT DoCoMo has
"i-shot" and "Foma." Competition has intensified sharply and
J-Phone's lead is slipping, but it still has the most camera-phone
users, with more than 7 million.</TE>
<TE>   NTT DoCoMo, however, which is betting on full-motion videophones,
questions J-Phone's long-term strategy.</TE>
<TE>   Many users now store dozens of shots in their phones, including
train schedule shots for future reference or pictures of CDs to buy
on the next visit to a music store.</TE>
<TE>   "The problem for carriers is that they only make their money when
you send the photos," said Masaki Nakamura, a researcher at the
Multimedia Research Institute. Companies agree, but say they hope
some archived shots will be sent eventually.</TE>
<TE>   Camera-equipped cell phones cost roughly $50 to $225, and the
pictures cost between 6 cents and 16 cents to transmit.</TE>
<TE>   Men and women tend to use phone-equipped cameras differently, some
say. Men take more shots of scenery, their cars, their girlfriends,
with a particular emphasis on external objects, says Naoki Nakayama,
editor of "J-Phone Sha-mail Hearts" magazine. Women, meanwhile, tend
to take more pictures of themselves, their hairstyles, how they look
in new clothes, with emphasis on the internal and the psychological,
he adds.</TE>
<TE>   "When I'm alone, I take photos of myself and study how I can look
prettier in camera-phone shots," says Eriko Mukai, an 18-year-old
high school student. "Of course, I don't send practice shots to
anyone."</TE>

<HD>Venezuela Strike Pushes Nation Toward Crisis</HD>
<DH>Protest could affect oil supplies to U.S. in days,
observers say. Troops guard facilities.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>T. Christian Miller</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>CARACAS, Venezuela</DL>
<LD>This nation was at the brink of its most serious political crisis
since an April coup Thursday as a nationwide strike caused a sharp
decline in oil production and President Hugo Chavez sent army and
national guard troops to protect all of Venezuela's petroleum
facilities.</LD>
<LD>   As strike leaders announced that they would continue the strike
for a fifth day to force Chavez to agree to a February vote on his
rule, a growing number of employees with the state oil company,
PDVSA, joined the protest.</LD>
<LD>   Slowdowns were reported all along the production chain, from
wellheads to oil tankers. The resulting cascade effect was expected
to result in defaults on international oil contracts in "five or six
days," according to a high-ranking PDVSA member.</LD>
<TE>   Venezuela is the fourth-largest supplier of oil to the United
States, providing on average about 13%, or 1.2 million barrels, of
U.S. daily petroleum needs.</TE>
<TE>   "The situation is extremely grave," said Jose Toro, an oil analyst
in Caracas, the capital.</TE>
<TE>   Venezuela reeled dangerously as Chavez and his opponents faced off
in a high-stakes confrontation with no endgame in sight. Chavez's
opposition, a large but disorganized group that includes businesses,
unions, dissident military officers and opposition politicians,
accuses the president of leading the country into ruin. It cites the
shrinking economy, rising joblessness and internal strife.</TE>
<TE>   They are seeking to hold a referendum in February on Chavez's
rule, but he has said the constitution does not permit a vote until
August.</TE>
<TE>   The standoff and the growing pressure from the oil crisis led to
fears of new violence and possibly a new coup attempt. More than 60
people died in street clashes during a short-lived coup in April.</TE>
<TE>   The strike seemed to have morphed Thursday into a new alliance
between the opposition and the oil workers, who have remained mostly
above the fray since their participation in strikes in April led to
the coup.</TE>
<TE>   Their joint participation complicated a possible solution because
the two groups have different complaints. While the opposition has
demanded a referendum, oil workers have a series of internal
concerns. They say Chavez has installed incompetent sycophants in key
company positions.</TE>
<TE>   An angry Chavez said the opposition was trying again to overthrow
him. He was returned to power two days after the April 11 coup by
loyal military officers and supporters.</TE>
<TE>   "I am making a call so we are ready to confront any situation
caused by these violent, subversive, destabilizing instigators," the
fiery leftist said. "This is the moment to distance ourselves from
subversive, coup-plotting, fascist currents."</TE>
<TE>   Chavez said he would send navy commandos to take over one of the
rebellious ships, the Pilin Leon, loaded with 280,000 barrels of
gasoline. Late Thursday, the standoff was resolved when the captain,
Daniel Alfaro, said he would voluntarily turn over the ship and crew
to a replacement crew to deliver the cargo.</TE>
<TE>   Chavez also guaranteed that oil production would continue. Oil
revenues account for more than half the government's budget.</TE>
<TE>   "All Venezuelans must be alert to defend our democracy," he said,
holding up a small blue book containing the country's constitution.
"They are trying to affect the heart of the economy to generate a
state of chaos."</TE>
<TE>   At least six ship captains in the state-owned oil fleet joined the
strike, stranding their ships in Lake Maracaibo, the heart of the
nation's oil industry. Striking dockworkers slowed the loading of
ships that continued working. Daily operations suffered, with 90% of
white-collar employees out.</TE>
<TE>   More oil workers at the Paraguana Refinery Center, the largest in
the Western Hemisphere, announced that they would join the protest,
bringing production to a halt and resulting in a potential loss of
about 1 million barrels of oil a day, equal to about a third of the
country's average daily output, according to PDVSA officials.</TE>
<TE>   Oil prices jumped sharply Thursday. International benchmark Brent
crude oil prices rose 62 cents, or 2.5%, to close at a six-week high
of $25.80 per barrel.</TE>
<TE>   Ed Morse, an oil expert at Hess Energy Trading Co. in New York,
said a short-term strike didn't pose any serious long-term risk to
U.S. energy security.</TE>
<TE>   "We still don't know how long the situation will last," said
Morse, a former U.S. State Department official. "But it looks like
it's deteriorating rapidly and that control over both oil production
and refining and shipping has fallen out of the hands of the
government."</TE>
<TE>   Opposition figures had planned to hold a march through Caracas but
canceled it, claiming that Chavez allies had planted snipers on
rooftops.</TE>
<TE>   "What they are playing is a game of poker to see who will first
break the rules of the constitution," said Antonio Herrera, general
director of the Venezuelan-American Chamber of Commerce.</TE>
<TE>   Further complicating a negotiated solution were new demands from
the opposition. Emboldened by the participation of the PDVSA, the
opposition said it was now demanding that presidential elections,
scheduled for 2006, be moved up.</TE>
<TE>   Negotiations between the opposing sides, mediated by Cesar
Gaviria, secretary-general of the Organization of American States,
were suspended Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   But new hope emerged late Thursday that the two sides would return
to the negotiating table. Government negotiators, who previously had
refused to talk while the strike continued, said they would heed a
call from fellow nations and Pope John Paul II to return to the
table.</TE>
<TE>   They asked Gaviria to seek ways to immediately begin a dialogue
with the opposition. A source close to the talks called it a "step
forward."</TE>
<TE>   Government officials acknowledged that oil production was
suffering but said they have contingency plans in place to satisfy
local and international petroleum needs.</TE>
<TE>   "Operations are flowing normally," said Bernardo Alvarez, vice
minister of energy and mines. "There have been some minor delays, but
that's all."</TE>
<TE>   That account was sharply disputed by three high-ranking PDVSA
officials interviewed by The Times. They portrayed an industry that
was barely functioning and on the verge of shutdown.</TE>
<TE>   At Paraguana, another union announced that it would join striking
workers, crippling the facility. The group announced that the
refinery would work only to supply basic electrical services to local
communities.</TE>
<TE>   The refinery "is shut down," said Juan Fernandez, PDVSA's planning
director and a key player in the strike. "They are joining the strike
for the same reasons as the rest of the country's citizens: to demand
a call for elections."</TE>
<TE>   Production was also slowed at two large refineries, Puerto La Cruz
and El Palito, which supplies much of the country's internal gas
needs, a high-ranking PDVSA source said.</TE>
<TE>   The six tankers amount to about half of PDVSA's state-owned fleet,
which accounts for 30% of its transportation capacity. The other 70%
of oil transportation is performed by private contractors. Those
ships were moving freely in and out of Lake Maracaibo, despite a
threat by tugboat pilots to block them, the source said.</TE>
<TE>   The slowdowns had already left 30% of gas stations in the eastern
section of the country dry, the source said. Gas supplies in central
and western Venezuela were expected to begin being affected in two to
three days.</TE>
<TE>   International contracts will begin to be affected in the upcoming
week, the source said. It takes four days for an oil-laden tanker to
make the trip from Venezuela to the United States, the country's
largest customer.</TE>
<TE>   "There are still no defaults, but we are close," the source said.
"If the strike continues, I'd estimate in five or six days."</TE>
<TE>   PDVSA executives portrayed a growing divide among the company's
employees, who have long prided themselves on holding themselves
aloof from politics despite being a state-owned company.</TE>
<TE>   That assessment, at least, was backed up by Chavez allies in the
oil company.</TE>
<TE>   "It's very tense," said Enny Pulgar, a pro-Chavez administrator
participating in a pro-government protest outside the company's
mostly abandoned headquarters Thursday. "Sometimes, when we're
drinking coffee, they come up and do a cacerolazo"--in which Chavez
foes bang together pots and pans in protest.</TE>

<HD>Vatican Aide Calls for Not Letting Gays Be Priests</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>VATICAN CITY</DL>
<LD>A top Vatican official has advised against bringing gays into the
priesthood, saying their ordination would be imprudent and risky.</LD>
<LD>   Cardinal Jorge Arturo Medina Estevez's letter, reproduced in a
church publication, comes as the Vatican is drafting guidelines for
accepting candidates for the priesthood. The guidelines are expected
to address whether gays should be barred.</LD>
<LD>   Medina Estevez's position reflects what appears to be the
Vatican's emerging public stance on the issue. He was the prefect for
the Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the
Sacraments when the letter was written, although he retired in
October.</LD>
<TE>   Ordination "of homosexual men or men with homosexual tendencies is
absolutely inadvisable and imprudent, and from the pastoral point of
view, very risky," Medina Estevez wrote.</TE>
<TE>   News reports in Italy and the United States in recent weeks have
said that according to initial drafts of the new guidelines under
consideration, the Vatican has decided that seminaries should bar men
with homosexual tendencies.</TE>
<TE>   That document is being prepared by another Vatican office, the
Congregation for Catholic Education, and isn't expected to be
released until next year.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday, the Italian gay rights group Arcigay condemned Medina
Estevez's position, saying the Vatican was using gay priests as a
scapegoat in the church's pedophilia scandal.</TE>

<HD>Disney's 'Treasure Planet' an Adventure in Losing Money</HD>
<DH>Two men persevered for years to make what may be the
biggest flop in studio's recent history.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Richard Verrier and Claudia Eller</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writers</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>This is no Cinderella story.</LD>
<LD>   For nearly two decades, Walt Disney Co. filmmakers Ron Clements
and John Musker dreamed of making an animated movie based on Robert
Louis Stevenson's classic coming-of-age novel "Treasure Island." In
their version, the action would unfold in outer space.</LD>
<LD>   Even though the pair would emerge over time as two of the studio's
hottest director-producers, with such hits as "The Little Mermaid,"
"Aladdin" and "Hercules," the studio kept rejecting the pitch and
shelving the project, saying it lacked fairy-tale magic.</LD>
<TE>   But the two men persevered, refusing to let their dream die at the
hands of disbelievers. They even outlasted the biggest naysayer of
them all, studio Chairman Jeffrey Katzenberg, who was fired in 1994.
So with the backing of Vice Chairman Roy Disney himself -- and a
special contract provision -- the duo finally co-wrote, directed and
produced "Treasure Planet."</TE>
<TE>   Last weekend it landed -- with a thud.</TE>
<TE>   Far from being one of the "cinematic treasures" of the holiday
season Disney promised in its promotional materials, the movie
recorded a weak five-day gross of $16.6 million. The early financial
results were so bad that Disney this week took the extraordinary step
of lowering its annual earnings by tens of millions of dollars.</TE>
<TE>   "Treasure Planet" -- which cost an estimated $180 million to make
and market -- is expected to be the biggest money loser in the
history of Disney animation. If that's not bad enough, the flop has
fueled continuing concerns among some investors and analysts that
Disney's storied animation division has lost its once-infallible
touch.</TE>
<TE>   Publicly, Disney executives are putting up a brave front amid the
fallout. They say the movie was received well by test audiences and
was hurt by stiff box-office competition from such family-oriented
fare as "Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets" and Disney's own
"The Santa Clause 2."</TE>
<TE>   Even so, studio Chairman Richard Cook said the film's failure had
forced the studio to look inward.</TE>
<TE>   "In our own self-criticism," he said, "maybe we didn't do a good
enough job to entice an audience to want to come. Maybe we were too
serious and earnest in the marketing -- that's what we're
questioning."</TE>
<TE>   Clements and Musker, who are said to be devastated by the public's
rejection of their quixotic vision, declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike the usual stuff of Hollywood legends, in which labors of
love blossom into multimillion-dollar hits -- think "My Big Fat Greek
Wedding" -- the failure of "Treasure Planet" shows the perils of
pursuing pet projects at all costs.</TE>
<TE>   The movie business is, of course, always hit-and-miss. But in this
case, there was trouble in the stars nearly from the start. The
project was repeatedly pushed aside by other films and sidelined by
concerns that the script was not compelling. At the company's highest
levels, clashes broke out over whether the movie should be made.</TE>
<TE>   Even after millions had been spent on the production, Disney Chief
Executive Michael Eisner reportedly expressed concerns when he viewed
an early cut a year ago. But by then it was too late to change
course.</TE>
<TE>   The idea for "Treasure Planet" dates back 17 years. At the time,
Disney's feature animation division held a "gong show" of sorts to
scout for new ideas. One of the first pitched by Clements was
"Treasure Island in Space," according to the movie's press notes. He
brought aboard collaborator Musker, with whom he wrote and directed
the 1986 animated movie "The Great Mouse Detective."</TE>
<TE>   Although the Treasure Island project was enthusiastically
embraced, Disney had something else in mind for the duo, "The Little
Mermaid," which Clements had also pitched. The film, released in
1989, was a huge success, ushering in a revival of animation at
Disney.</TE>
<TE>   But amid all the hoopla, Clements and Musker kept their focus and
began sketching out their other idea, now called "Treasure Planet."
Once again, they were drafted to write and direct another Disney
priority, "Aladdin," which would become an even bigger draw in 1992.</TE>
<TE>   With each successive hit, the pair's stature grew, giving them
what they hoped would be the opening to push through "Treasure
Planet." Now they had a script in hand and appeared to be gaining
momentum when history repeated itself.</TE>
<TE>   This time the movie was "Hercules." Although the partners were
gaining power for the renowned wit and style they brought to their
undertakings, the idea closest to their heart did not capture the
imagination of the man at the top of the studio, Katzenberg.</TE>
<TE>   "He hated the idea," said a former Disney executive familiar with
the project's history.</TE>
<TE>   To begin with, the executive said, Katzenberg did not like the
film's concept. He thought it was simply a bad idea to take a classic
adventure tale of a young boy's coming of age and place it in space.</TE>
<TE>   When Katzenberg halted the project, Clements and Musker were
infuriated. Sources said they went to Roy Disney. He backed the
filmmakers and made his wishes known to Eisner, who in turn agreed
that the studio should make the movie.</TE>
<TE>   Now it was Katzenberg who was livid, only complicating the bad
feelings that had been developing between him and Eisner on a number
of fronts, sources inside and outside the company say. Before long,
Katzenberg was fired and began forming rival studio DreamWorks SKG.</TE>
<TE>   Katzenberg, Eisner and Roy Disney declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   With Katzenberg out of the way, the project accelerated with a
script Clements and Musker wrote with Rob Edwards.</TE>
<TE>   Clements and Musker remained so passionate about and protective of
their project that it became part of their 1995 negotiations to
extend their contract with the studio for seven years. The contract
stipulated that after fulfilling their "Hercules" commitment, the two
were guaranteed the right to make "Treasure Planet" or another
project mutually agreed upon.</TE>
<TE>   But the journey to the screen would face new obstacles and
concerns.</TE>
<TE>   Long before its release, questions were being raised inside the
studio about whether the film would take off with audiences. One of
the biggest concerns centered on lead character Jim Hawkins. The
troubled teenager seemed too harsh and brooding. Meanwhile, the
second and third acts of the movie were thought to be flat and
emotionless. Even Eisner, who had green-lighted the project, was said
to be concerned about the characters and plot.</TE>
<TE>   Fixes were suggested and made, including making the lead character
more likable and sympathetic.</TE>
<TE>   As the debut neared, Disney launched a marketing campaign that
even by the studio's own admission was surprisingly unmemorable,
failing to entice moviegoers.</TE>
<TE>   "In our marketing maybe we should have stressed other elements to
make it fun and exciting," studio chief Cook said.</TE>
<TE>   Questions also are being raised about the timing of the movie's
release -- and why it would be pitted against films vying for the
same family audience. Despite the competition, Cook said, "there was
plenty of business out there -- we just didn't get it."</TE>
<TE>   In reality, the studio had no choice. Under a promotional
deal with its longtime partner McDonald's Corp., the studio was locked
into the Nov. 27 release date a year ago.</TE>
<TE>   When the movie hit the theaters, executives throughout the Disney
could only cringe. It could not have come at a worse time.</TE>
<TE>   The company's ailing ABC television network has begun to show
signs of life after steep ratings slides. The studio's last animated
release, "Lilo &amp; Stitch," was a success this summer with children and
grown-ups alike, proving that Disney still had some magic, even if
people weren't flocking to its theme parks.</TE>
<TE>   For his part, Roy Conli, who served as a producer on the movie, is
holding out hope that audiences will discover it: "This has always
been a movie driven by the passion of the artists, the directors and
myself, and the team is hoping it has legs."</TE>

<KH>ROONE ARLEDGE: 1931-2002</KH>
<HD>TV Executive Revolutionized the Coverage of News, Sports</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Roone Arledge, who transformed American television by infusing
dramatic story lines, star personalities and vivid graphic
presentations into the disparate realms of news and sports, died
Thursday in New York City of complications from cancer. He was 71.</LD>
<LD>   In his four decades as an ABC executive, first as ABC Sports
president and then as president of ABC News, Arledge had a singular
impact on the look of television, tapping into nascent technologies,
using his keen eye to find the drama in any situation and nurturing
on-air stars from Howard Cosell to Barbara Walters.</LD>
<LD>   At ABC Sports, where he served as president from 1968 to 1986,
Arledge created two of television's most durable sports franchises,
"Monday Night Football" and "Wide World of Sports," and personally
produced all 10 ABC Olympics broadcasts. In each case, the programs
looked and felt different from other sports shows that had preceded
them. He introduced the instant replay and slow motion, and made
viewers care about athletes for their personal dramas, not just their
statistics.</LD>
<TE>   Improbably, he then went on to transform the sober and clubby
world of television news, as ABC News president from 1977 to 1997,
where his innovations included the late-night interview program
"Nightline," the evening newscast "World News Tonight" and the prime
time newsmagazine "20/20." He revived Sunday morning political talk
shows, bringing David Brinkley to ABC and installing him on "This
Week."</TE>
<TE>   Arledge used multimillion-dollar salaries to turn serious
newscasters into high-powered celebrities and sent correspondents and
anchors out of the studio to exotic locations around the world. He
was named ABC News chairman in 1997, a move widely seen as a
demotion, as a new generation of news executives took over.</TE>
<TE>   NBC Sports Chairman Dick Ebersol, who worked for Arledge from 1967
to 1974, on Thursday called him "the most creative force in the
history of American television." Arledge, he said, "invented
television sports and then reinvented television news. He alone moved
American sports from daytime to prime time, from small time to big
time."</TE>
<TE>   Arledge could be a difficult boss, famous for not returning phone
calls and for hogging credit when he didn't have to, several proteges
have said, but he had an instinctual eye for talent, making household
names of sportscasters Frank Gifford, Jim McKay, Al Michaels and
Cosell, as well as news anchors Walters, Peter Jennings, Ted Koppel
and Sam Donaldson, among others.</TE>
<TE>   Behind the cameras, he groomed executives including Walt Disney
Co. President Robert Iger, who along with Ebersol, worked for Arledge
at ABC Sports.</TE>
<TE>   In a statement, Iger said: "Roone Arledge was a great friend and
mentor to me, and when I think of him, the word perfection comes to
mind. He was a visionary for those who were privileged enough to work
with him, as well as for the millions of viewers who were fortunate
enough to be enriched by his programming innovations, which
transformed the way television is watched to this day ...."</TE>
<TE>   "He was a brilliant man who saw the big picture," Michaels said.
"He emphasized telling stories and telling stories about people. He
could take events such as barrel racing, demolition derby and
toboggan racing and make them interesting."</TE>
<TE>   Shunning concerns about the bottom line, Michaels said, "He gave
the impression that all he was concerned about was putting on a great
show, and he knew how to do it."</TE>
<TE>   Twice, when he didn't have one obvious star to put in the sports
booth or the nightly news anchor chair, he improvised with three,
making the move seem revolutionary, instead of possibly desperate.</TE>
<TE>   "This guy was a leader," Donaldson said. "Sure, he didn't return
phone calls, but those of us who worked for him would have marched
off a cliff behind him, and if he wanted to play golf first, we would
have waited for him. He knew what worked; he knew it when he saw it."</TE>
<TE>   Roone Pinckney Arledge was born July 8, 1931, in Forest Hills,
N.Y., and raised on Long Island. After receiving a bachelor's degree
from what was then Columbia College in 1952 -- a class that included
Richard Wald, who would become president of NBC News and later a key
Arledge deputy -- he joined the DuMont Television Network as a
production assistant.</TE>
<TE>   After a stint at NBC, where he won his first Emmy Award for his
producing work with Shari Lewis and her puppet Lambchop, he joined
ABC Sports in 1960 as a producer, drawing on the burgeoning
television technology of the time to bring viewers at home closer
than ever to the action, with hand-held cameras and on-field
microphones. His first assignment at ABC Sports was producing college
football, where he penned a now-famous memo of his planned approach,
promising, "We are going to add show business to sports!"</TE>
<TE>   Arledge, who once referred to sports as a "microcosm of life,"
quickly made a mark with the creation in 1961 of the globe-spanning
"ABC's Wide World of Sports," coining its tag line "The thrill of
victory and the agony of defeat." In "Beating the Odds," ABC founder
Leonard Goldenson's history of the network, Arledge recalled that his
proudest sports accomplishment was adding journalism to sports
coverage, with the use of commentators such as the abrasive Cosell.
In 1970, he created the prime time "Monday Night Football," still on
the air.</TE>
<TE>   Arledge, who had studied journalism at Columbia with an eye to
being a writer for Time or Newsweek, was thrust into the unaccustomed
role of news producer at the 1972 Munich Olympics. Overnight, the
games turned from a typical sporting event into a dark news story,
when Palestinian Black September terrorists killed 11 Israeli
athletes.</TE>
<TE>   It was the first hostage drama to air live. The world was
transfixed as ABC's cameras focused on the dormitories where the
terrorists held the athletes hostage, and McKay went from hosting
sports coverage to anchoring breaking news.</TE>
<TE>   Five years later, Goldenson made the controversial move of handing
Arledge the third-place ABC News, which he would run along with ABC
Sports. In "Beating the Odds," Goldenson equated that decision to
"throwing the deed to the family farm on the casino table. I couldn't
be sure we'd win -- but if we did, I thought we would win big."</TE>
<TE>   Walters recalled Thursday that Arledge was "ridiculed and
vilified" at the time, which meant "we had a lot in common." Walters
had left NBC News to become co-anchor with Harry Reasoner of ABC's
nightly newscast and, she said, "I was a failure here. Roone made the
decision to send Harry back to CBS' '60 Minutes' and bet on me, and
nourish me and resurrect my career." Walters went on to conduct
groundbreaking interviews with Middle East foes Anwar Sadat of Egypt
and Menachem Begin of Israel.</TE>
<TE>   Money was key to Arledge's reinvention of ABC News. Donaldson was
ABC's White House correspondent when Arledge took over, and he soon
read that Arledge was trying to lure a top NBC correspondent to ABC
for the then-unheard-of annual salary of $100,000, far more than the
$55,000 Donaldson was earning as ABC's top-paid reporter. Donaldson
sent Arledge a cheeky note, and the next day, his salary was raised
to the same level.</TE>
<TE>   "If Roone thought you were the guy or gal he wanted in a
particular spot and as long as you were producing, he would pay,"
Donaldson said.</TE>
<TE>   Even rivals benefited. Arledge went after NBC News' Tom Brokaw,
and dangled big money at CBS' Dan Rather in the early 1980s. To keep
him, CBS agreed to make Rather anchor of the "CBS Evening News,"
replacing Walter Cronkite. Arledge was gracious when Rather declined
the offer, Rather recalled, "where a lesser person would not have
been." The CBS anchor added that one of the things that attracted him
to working for Arledge was that "not only did he have an eye for
quality on the air, but he had a great eye for quality people around
him."</TE>
<TE>   The high salaries would make multimillionaires of the likes of
Walters, Jennings and Diane Sawyer, and turn them into celebrities,
putting ABC News on the map at the same time. Though programs such as
Walters' "20/20" and Sawyer's "Primetime" would earn millions for the
network in return, the mega-salaries ultimately proved to be a costly
and perhaps unsustainable trend, as the television news business has
become more competitive.</TE>
<TE>   Even with two major jobs, Arledge was at the top of his creative
game. In one year, 1980, he mined the drama of the underdog U.S.
hockey team's upset of the Russians at the Winter Olympics from Lake
Placid, N.Y., and transformed the late-night Iranian hostage crisis
special reports into "Nightline," one of television news' most
honored programs. His Olympic coverage, filled with "up close and
personal" profiles of the athletes, turned the quadrennial events
into advertising bonanzas, one that NBC has benefited from with
recent games.</TE>
<TE>   Arledge's work habits were quirky; for years his usual uniform was
a safari jacket; he would refuse to return phone calls and then, when
finally reached, "you'd have him for five hours," Walters said.
Goldenson, in his book, cited a joke that made the rounds when
Arledge added news to his portfolio: "Roone will now have two offices
where he can't be reached."</TE>
<TE>   Arledge may not have been easily found, but sports and news
producers and correspondents soon learned that he had his own way of
ensuring his constant presence, through the so-called "Roone phone."
The control room phones were wired directly to his home, so he could
weigh in on what his staff was doing at any minute, and he often
would.</TE>
<TE>   "The biggest compliment and biggest fear was when you were on the
air, and Roone called," Walters said. Even when Arledge didn't call,
the trick worked.</TE>
<TE>   "Nightline" executive producer Tom Bettag recalled an editor who
didn't want to finesse a minor glitch in a report for fear that the
"Roone phone" would ring, evidence that "that man shaped an
organization absolutely top to bottom, whose power and influence was
something beyond what most mortal men achieve."</TE>
<TE>   Arledge won the loyalty of employees because "if he trusted you,
he would let you go out there and try something," said Jeff Gralnick,
one of Arledge's top executive producers for many years.</TE>
<TE>   Gralnick said he took the job after Arledge poked him in the chest
and said, " 'I'm going to make you work harder than you've ever
worked, and make you better than you ever thought you'd be.' There
was a mystique that he fostered."</TE>
<TE>   When he was attentive, he was hands-on. Gralnick recalled a 1980s
election set that simply wasn't looking right on camera. "None of us
could figure it out and then we heard Roone grumbling in the
background, and he cried out, 'It's the stairs,' " Gralnick said.
They were removed and "suddenly it became a magical, huge place. He
just saw it."</TE>
<TE>   "Roone believed in being involved in every aspect -- but he could
be unbelievably difficult and there were times when we wanted to
wring his neck," Jennings said.</TE>
<TE>   "Especially for people like Koppel and me -- he had been a
godfather, our patron, almost like a father in some ways. He made our
careers possible."</TE>
<TE>   The 37-time Emmy Award-winner was cited by Life magazine in 1990
as one of the 100 most important Americans of the 20th century, and
he was the first television executive to receive the International
Olympic Committee's Medal of the Olympic Order.</TE>
<TE>   In 1989, he was inducted into the Olympic Hall of Fame, and in
1990 into the Television Academy Hall of Fame. He received four
George Foster Peabody Awards, including a personal award for his work
at ABC News.</TE>
<TE>   "Roone Arledge revolutionized television and with it the way
people see and understand the world," said ABC News President David
L. Westin on Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Arledge died at New York's Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center.
Thrice married, he is survived by his wife, Gigi Shaw Arledge, and
his children from a previous marriage, Roone Arledge Jr., Susan
Weston, Betsey Arledge and Patricia Looney.</TE>

<HD>Court Upholds State Assault Weapons Ban</HD>
<DH>In a rebuff to the White House, U.S. appellate panel rules
that the 2nd Amendment does not give individuals the right to keep
and bear arms.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A federal appeals court upheld California's assault weapons control
act Thursday, ruling that there is no constitutional right for
individuals to keep and bear arms.</LD>
<LD>   The 3-0 decision, declaring that the 2nd Amendment protects only
the right of states to organize and maintain militias, is flatly at
odds with the position of the Bush administration and a decision last
year by a federal appeals court in New Orleans.</LD>
<LD>   California adopted the nation's most sweeping assault weapons ban
in 1999. It prohibits the manufacture, sale or import of weapons
including grenade launchers, semiautomatic pistols with a capacity of
more than 10 rounds, semiautomatic rifles that use detachable
magazines and guns with barrels that can be fitted with silencers.</LD>
<TE>   In February 2000, a month after the law took effect, a group of
individuals who either own assault weapons or want to buy them
challenged the law in U.S. District Court in Sacramento, contending
that it violated the 2nd Amendment, the equal protection clause and
other constitutional provisions.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. District Judge William B. Shubb dismissed all of the
plaintiffs' claims last year. Thursday's decision by the San
Francisco-based U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals upheld Shubb's
ruling on the 2nd Amendment and one granting an exemption to the law
for off-duty police officers. The appellate court overruled Shubb on
another point, declaring that there was no rational basis for retired
police officers to be exempt from the law.</TE>
<TE>   California Atty. Gen. Bill Lockyer, whose office defended the
state law in court, applauded the decision, which was also praised by
attorneys for gun control organizations and denounced by leading gun
owner associations.</TE>
<TE>   Several plaintiffs declined to return calls, and their attorney
could not be reached for comment. The plaintiffs could ask the full
9th Circuit to rehear the case or could directly appeal to the U.S.
Supreme Court, which has not ruled on the issue for more than 60
years.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. Justice Department, which under Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft
has taken the position that individuals have a constitutional right
to bear arms, had no immediate comment.</TE>
<TE>   At issue is the meaning of the 2nd Amendment, which states: "A
well-regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free
state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be
infringed."</TE>
<TE>   Although the 9th Circuit ruling was unanimous, one judge on the
panel, Frank J. Magill, said it was unnecessary for the court to have
written a detailed opinion on the 2nd Amendment because of a similar
ruling by the court six years ago.</TE>
<TE>   In 1996, the 9th Circuit said there was no individual right to
bear arms in a case in which a Los Angeles resident had challenged a
decision by local authorities denying him a concealed-weapons permit.</TE>
<TE>   Consequently, the appeals court could have simply cited that
decision and affirmed Shubb's ruling in this case.</TE>
<TE>   However, Judge Stephen Reinhardt said that because there is
considerable debate over the 2nd Amendment, it was advisable for the
9th Circuit to revisit the issue in detail.</TE>
<TE>   Among the recent developments he cited were a 2001 decision by the
U.S. 5th Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans holding that the 2nd
Amendment gives individuals a constitutional right "to privately
possess and bear their own firearms." That was the first such
decision taking that position, in contrast to previous federal court
rulings on the issue.</TE>
<TE>   Ashcroft sent a letter to U.S. attorneys, saying that he
agreed with the New Orleans court's interpretation. And in May, in two
briefs filed in the U.S. Supreme Court, one of them in the New Orleans
case, Solicitor Gen. Theodore B. Olson took the same position.</TE>
<TE>   "The current position of the United States ... is that the 2nd
Amendment more broadly protects the rights of individuals, including
persons who are not members of any militia or engaged in active
military service or training, to possess their own firearms, subject
to reasonable restrictions designed to prevent possession by unfit
persons or to restrict the possession of types of firearms that are
particularly suited to criminal misuse," Olson wrote.</TE>
<TE>   The Supreme Court later declined to hear the New Orleans case, in
which the appellate court upheld the federal Violence Against Women
Act while also saying individuals do have a right to bear arms.</TE>
<TE>   Besides citing the legal developments, Reinhardt noted that the
Supreme Court has issued very few decisions on the 2nd Amendment.</TE>
<TE>   The Supreme Court's most detailed ruling on the issue came in U.S.
vs. Miller in 1939.</TE>
<TE>   In that case, a criminal defendant challenged a federal
gun-control law that prohibited the transport of sawed-off shotguns
in interstate commerce by contending that it violated the 2nd
Amendment.</TE>
<TE>   The high court rejected the challenge, saying there was no
evidence that such weapons have a "reasonable relationship to the
preservation or efficiency of a well-regulated militia."</TE>
<TE>   Thursday's ruling quotes at length from the debates on
the adoption of the 2nd Amendment, including statements from James
Madison and other founding fathers.</TE>
<TE>   The right to "keep and bear arms," concluded Reinhardt, is
different from owning or possessing them.</TE>
<TE>   He also said the 2nd Amendment was adopted at the urging of people
who were concerned about the federal government having too much power
under the new nation's Constitution.</TE>
<TE>   "We believe that the most plausible construction of the 2nd
Amendment is that it seeks to ensure the existence of effective state
militias in which the people may exercise their right to bear arms,
and forbids the federal government to interfere with such exercise,"
Reinhardt wrote.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, he emphasized that the 2nd Amendment referred to a
well-regulated militia and that the amendment was enacted soon after
the uprising of farmers in western Massachusetts known as Shay's
rebellion, which lasted from August 1786 to February 1787.</TE>
<TE>   "What the drafters of the amendment thought 'necessary to the
security of a free state' was not an 'unregulated' mob of armed
individuals such as Shay's band of farmers, the modern-day privately
organized Michigan Militia, the type of extremist 'militia'
associated with Timothy McVeigh and other militants with similar
anti-government views, groups of white supremacists or other racial
or religious bigots, or indeed any other private collection of
individuals," Reinhardt wrote. "To the contrary, 'well-regulated'
confirms that 'militia' can only reasonably be construed as referring
to a military force established and controlled by a governmental
entity."</TE>
<TE>   The judge acknowledged that it might be difficult for some people
to understand this given that states no longer have militias like
those in the 18th century that fought in the Revolutionary War --
before the federal government created a standing army.</TE>
<TE>   Reinhardt also emphasized that New Hampshire was the only one of
the original 13 states that proposed an amendment to the U.S.
Constitution explicitly establishing a personal right to possess
arms.</TE>
<TE>   "The historical record makes it plain that the [2nd] Amendment was
not adopted in order to afford rights to individuals with respect to
private gun ownership or possession," he wrote.</TE>
<TE>   Judge Raymond Fisher joined the opinion. Magill said he agreed
with the conclusion but that it was unnecessary to go into so much
detail.</TE>
<TE>   USC law professor Erwin Chemerinsky and Columbia law professor
Michael Dorf, each of whom applauded the ruling, said they thought
Reinhardt would not have written such an extensive opinion but for
last year's 5th Circuit ruling and the Justice Department's recent
change of stance.</TE>
<TE>   "Judge Reinhardt saw that if he" simply affirmed Shubb's ruling by
merely citing the 9th Circuit's 1996 decision, the 5th Circuit
decision going the other way "would have gone unanswered," said Dorf,
who has written about the 2nd Amendment.</TE>
<TE>   Chemerinsky said Reinhardt's argument "was the most
thorough opinion rejecting the review that the 2nd Amendment protects the
rights of individuals to possess guns."</TE>
<TE>   Atty. Gen. Lockyer said that although he respects "the rights of
Californians to pursue hunting and sports shooting, and of
law-abiding citizens to protect their homes and businesses, there is
no need for these military-style weapons to be on the streets of our
state."</TE>
<TE>   He expressed disappointment only about the portion of the decision
overturning the exception for retired officers. An aide to Lockyer
said there are no available statistics on the number of weapons
confiscated under the 1999 law.</TE>
<TE>   Matthew Nosanchuk, senior litigation counsel for the
Violence Policy Center in Washington, said Reinhardt's 86-page ruling "is
a very important contribution that should drive a stake through the
heart of the individual-rights position."</TE>
<TE>   John Loewi, an attorney with the Brady Center to Prevent Gun
Violence, said the timing of the decision was particularly important
because of speculation that last year's decision in New Orleans might
be a sign that federal courts were about to change the prevailing
view on the issue.</TE>
<TE>   "It is a confirmation that that decision was an aberration and [it
is] a rebuke to the Ashcroft position," Loewi said.</TE>
<TE>   Two of the nation's major gun owner associations criticized the
ruling.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think the court gets it at all," said Larry Pratt,
executive director of Gun Owners of America. "The court neglected to
mention self-defense when discussing legitimate uses of guns."</TE>
<TE>   Andrew Arulanandam, a spokesman for the National Rifle Assn., said
the group has taken the position since its founding in 1871 that the
2nd Amendment gives individuals a right to possess guns.</TE>
<TE>   "We will continue to maintain that position as long as we are
around," he added.</TE>

<HD>2 Hospitals Plan Major Expansions</HD>
<DH>The Simi Valley and Los Robles medical facilities seek to
add private rooms and ensure compliance with state earthquake
guidelines.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Gregory W. Griggs</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>At a time when many hospitals are struggling to survive, eastern
Ventura County's two medical centers are embarking on major
expansions.</LD>
<LD>   Simi Valley Hospital broke ground Thursday on a $35-million
renovation project, and planners next week will review a proposed
$120-million modernization of Los Robles Regional Medical Center in
Thousand Oaks.</LD>
<LD>   Both projects will create private rooms where there are none,
expand services and ensure that overnight patient facilities meet
state earthquake standards.</LD>
<TE>   Los Robles' rebuilding effort would add 90 beds in a four-story
extension to the existing hospital. Because the new building would be
erected in what is now a parking lot, the hospital also wants to
build a 520-space parking structure.</TE>
<TE>   The 850-employee Simi Valley Hospital, run by Adventist Health,
expects to start construction this month on the project to create a
four-story, 170-bed wing, along with new parking.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday morning, about 300 employees and others gathered in a
visitor parking lot at the 37-year-old hospital for two hours of
prayers and speeches during a groundbreaking event.</TE>
<TE>   Simi Valley Mayor Bill Davis and other local officials came to
congratulate the hospital on its first major expansion since 1985,
when it enhanced its emergency and radiology departments and added a
new surgery floor. The current modernization will double the
intensive care unit from 11 to 24 beds, expand the labor and delivery
portion of the hospital and add cardiovascular services and an
intensive care unit for newborns.</TE>
<TE>   Hospital President Margaret R. Peterson earlier stressed the
importance of demolishing parts of the main building to develop a
facility that meets state seismic standards.</TE>
<TE>   "As a hospital, we're long overdue for an expansion," she said.
"Certainly the state seismic mandate also is driving our plans."</TE>
<TE>   Industry officials have reported that more than half the state's
hospitals are losing money on their operations, even without costly
seismic retrofits required by the state by 2008.</TE>
<TE>   Adventist Health has committed $10 million to the project, an
ongoing fund-raising campaign will generate $9 million and $16
million comes from the Federal Emergency Management Agency to
compensate for more than $20 million in damage sustained in the
Northridge earthquake.</TE>
<TE>   The 1994 quake prompted a toughening of state law to require all
California hospitals to reinforce buildings that serve overnight
patients to withstand an 8-magnitude earthquake or to build new ones.</TE>
<TE>   Earthquake compliance also is part of the reason for renovation of
Los Robles' main campus on West Janss Road, which will be paid for by
its parent company, Hospital Corp. of America.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, the Thousand Oaks Planning Commission is set to vote on
whether an environmental study of the Los Robles proposal is
complete. Neighbors of the 34-year-old medical center insist that the
study is inadequate and are expected to turn out to criticize the
expansion.</TE>
<TE>   "I like having a world-class health facility in my city.... Our
concerns are really trying to understand what is the long-term plan
for the hospital," said Sidlee Street resident Paul Aguilar, whose
backyard runs parallel to Los Robles, which has 1,450 employees. "If
it is going to be this grandiose hospital, is that the right location
-- given the infrastructure and all the issues that will pop up, like
traffic?"</TE>
<TE>   Mike Marvin, an accountant who lives on nearby Tarkio Street,
questions the city's traffic analysis of the project, which concludes
that the expanded hospital won't significantly increase traffic in
the surrounding neighborhood.</TE>
<TE>   Marvin and his neighbors also are concerned about noise and
pollution during construction, about not knowing just how large Los
Robles eventually hopes to become and about the proposed height of
the new building -- in excess of 70 feet, which is more than twice a
35-foot city height limit.</TE>
<TE>   "One of the things to ask is: If you were building a hospital from
scratch today, would you want to put it on the corner of Lynn and
Janss roads?" he said.</TE>
<TE>   But Los Robles spokeswoman Kris Carraway-Bowman said the hospital
will adhere to all environmental requirements to reduce dirt and dust
during construction and that the hospital addition would not be built
any higher than the existing center.</TE>
<TE>   Regarding traffic, Carraway-Bowman points to an environmental
analysis that says potential problems could be handled by installing
extra turn lanes at two nearby intersections and devising a parking
management plan, including valet and off-site parking.</TE>
<TE>   Despite adding 41% more patient beds, Carraway-Bowman said there
will not be a corresponding hike in vehicles.</TE>
<TE>   "We are finding that we are consistently short of beds," she said.
"It's not so much that we'll be getting that many more patients in.
We just have to accommodate the patients we already have."</TE>

<HD>Federal Probe of Mattel, 2 Former Officials Yields Fines of
$477,000</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A day after state and city ethics investigators fined Mattel Inc. and
two former representatives for campaign finance violations, the
Federal Election Commission said Thursday that it has wrapped up a
related probe by imposing fines of $477,000 against the firm and the
two individuals.</LD>
<LD>   The combined fines from the city, state and federal government
total $931,000. The federal levy represents the third-highest
cumulative civil penalties in the FEC's history, the agency said.</LD>
<LD>   Former Mattel Senior Vice President Fermin Cuza and political
consultant Alan M. Schwartz admitted in settlement agreements with
the FEC that, combined, they laundered $120,714 in political
contributions by attributing donations from Mattel to other sources.
Mattel admitted making prohibited contributions and contributions in
the name of others.</LD>
<TE>   The money in question from the El Segundo-based toy maker went to
23 candidate committees, two party committees and five political
action committees.</TE>
<TE>   Committees that received the laundered contributions included
those for the presidential campaign of Al Gore, as well as campaigns
for such other Democrats as U.S. Sens. Barbara Boxer and Dianne
Feinstein of California and Hillary Rodham Clinton of New York; and
Reps. Jane Harman of Venice, Adam Schiff of Burbank, Brad Sherman of
Sherman Oaks, Loretta Sanchez of Garden Grove and Richard Gephardt of
Missouri.</TE>
<TE>   "The commission found no evidence that any of the recipient
political committees were aware that Mattel was the true source of
the contributions," the federal agency said in a written statement.</TE>
<TE>   Cuza and Schwartz used spouses, family members and others to make
many of the contributions, the federal filing says.</TE>
<TE>   Corey Rubin, an attorney for Schwartz, said his client cooperated
with authorities and is pleased that the case has been resolved, even
with the steep fines imposed.</TE>
<TE>   "He knows that this was a big mistake, and he absolutely regrets
it," Rubin said.</TE>
<TE>   Federal law prohibits corporations from making contributions from
general treasury funds to candidates for federal office. The law also
prohibits making contributions in the name of another person who is
not the true source of the funds.</TE>
<TE>   Mattel disclosed to federal, state and city ethics agencies last
year that its own internal investigation had found that some of its
money had been used by Cuza to reimburse campaign contributions made
by others from 1996 to 2000.</TE>
<TE>   A former U.S. Customs Department official, Cuza was hired to head
Mattel's customs department, and the company listed his "primary
function" as "improving and streamlining [Mattel's] customs clearance
procedures and ... improving Mattel's relationships with regulatory
bodies." He also developed and headed the firm's government relations
program. Cuza resigned in March 2001, after Mattel completed its
internal investigation.</TE>
<TE>   One subcontractor used for laundering contributions was employed
by Mattel for "customs processing," records show.</TE>
<TE>   Heavily edited documents released Thursday as part of the FEC
probe did not identify a specific issue that Cuza may have been
trying to affect with the campaign contributions.</TE>
<TE>   Mark E. Beck, an attorney for Cuza, said his client was generally
trying to help Mattel by raising the political profile of the
company's representatives.</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for Harman said neither Cuza nor Schwartz requested
legislation or help on any matter.</TE>
<TE>   The agreements released Thursday show that Schwartz has agreed to
pay $195,000 in civil penalties to the FEC; Cuza will pay $188,000
and Mattel will pay $94,000.</TE>
<TE>   On Wednesday the state Fair Political Practices Commission and Los
Angeles Ethics Commission released agreements signed by Cuza,
Schwartz and Mattel representatives admitting the two men laundered
$52,000 in political contributions from the company and that the firm
did not properly disclose contributions. That money went to
candidates for state and local offices.</TE>
<TE>   The two men and the firm agreed to pay a combined $454,000 in
fines to the state and city panels, although the agreements must be
approved by each commission.</TE>

<HD>Goodwin Case: D.A. Has a Lot to Lose</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>As if Orange County Dist. Atty. Tony Rackauckas needed any more bad
news.</LD>
<LD>   Fresh from battle on fronts both inside and outside his office,
the D.A. now must convince a skeptical state appeals court that one
of his most high-profile murder cases shouldn't be moved out of the
county.</LD>
<LD>   If he fails, it's not crazy to ask if the entire case would
topple.</LD>
<TE>   The murder case against Michael Goodwin, charged with arranging
the March 1988 killings in Los Angeles County of former business
partner Mickey Thompson and his wife, Trudy, is set for trial early
next year, but the Santa Ana appeals court wants to know why the case
was even filed in Orange County.</TE>
<TE>   Goodwin and his supporters have been asking that since his arrest
and incarceration 11 months ago but claim to know the answer.</TE>
<TE>   They contend that Rackauckas' long friendship with Collene
Campbell, a notable South County political figure and Thompson's
sister, influenced the decision to prosecute Goodwin.</TE>
<TE>   Rackauckas denies that, but the accusation plays into a recurring
theme plaguing Rackauckas: that personal relationships have driven
some of his decisions in office.</TE>
<TE>   Goodwin contends that Los Angeles County sheriff's detective Mark
Lillienfeld has spearheaded a corrupt -- if dogged -- investigation
and then went shopping for a prosecutor after the Los Angeles D.A.'s
office refused to charge Goodwin.</TE>
<TE>   Thompson, a prominent auto racing promoter, and his wife were
gunned down in the driveway of their Bradbury home in the San Gabriel
Valley as they were leaving for work. Authorities believe two gunmen
did the shooting and then fled on bicycles.</TE>
<TE>   Orange County claims jurisdiction because Goodwin and Thompson had
rancorous business dealings in the county that, investigators allege,
are at the heart of Goodwin's motive to kill the Thompsons. They also
allege that Goodwin partly hatched the murders while living in Laguna
Beach.</TE>
<TE>   Apparently not yet persuaded by either argument, the appeals court
has given Orange County a few weeks to explain why the case shouldn't
be transferred to Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   The court also set a Feb. 21 hearing if the matter remains
unresolved.</TE>
<TE>   "The venue is the issue," says Goodwin attorney Jeffrey Friedman,
"but the implications are far broader, in the sense that I believe
that the failure of the D.A. to establish venue is a direct result of
the D.A. failing to have a case."</TE>
<TE>   Assistant Orange County Dist. Atty. Bryan Brown says the office
has devoted more than two years to the case and will press on.</TE>
<TE>   "We feel very strongly the case should be tried down here," he
says.</TE>
<TE>   "We feel at this point it wouldn't be beneficial for the people of
California to have to transfer it to some other agency or
jurisdiction where all the institutional memory we've accumulated
with our lawyers would be wasted."</TE>
<TE>   Could Orange County prosecutors, denied of local jurisdiction,
simply set up shop in an L.A. courtroom? Or, would L.A., which more
than once declined to file charges against Goodwin, enter the fray?</TE>
<TE>   The answers aren't yet clear, Brown says. But Friedman says he
can't picture the Orange County D.A.'s office trying the case in Los
Angeles. If the transfer order stands and Orange County loses
jurisdiction, Friedman says, the case should be dismissed.</TE>
<TE>   It's too early to pronounce the Goodwin prosecution in trouble.
But with Goodwin already in jail for nearly a year, and with the
appeals court asking, in effect, why the case was filed here in the
first place, his protestations ring a bit louder and truer.</TE>

<LD>Wanted: Jolly people willing to wear red costumes, white wigs and
pillows to increase their girth while visiting children.</LD>
<LD>   Apply to Jim Engle, acting community services director in
Huntington Beach -- next year.</LD>
<LD>   He's already looking ahead because this holiday season, there were
not enough workers to continue the city's Community Santa Program,
which he helped found 16 years ago.</LD>
<TE>   Under the program, a resident could call Engle's department and
ask for a Santa Claus to visit his or her home for 15 minutes during
the holidays.</TE>
<TE>   But since last Christmas, several Santas have retired and there is
no one left to oversee the program, nor enough time to hire and train
new Santas.</TE>
<TE>   Even a last-ditch offer of $5,000 from the Huntington Beach
Municipal Employees Assn. couldn't help.</TE>
<TE>   "We appreciate the gesture, but it was not a budget issue," Engle
said. "We need someone to oversee the program. You cannot just go to
any street corner and get good Santas."</TE>

<HD>Ex-Nun's Priest Sex Lawsuit Dismissed</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jean Guccione</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Los Angeles County judge dismissed an ex-nun's sexual-abuse lawsuit
against the Archdiocese of Los Angeles on Thursday and sanctioned her
attorney, accusing both of using the court system to seek publicity.</LD>
<LD>   In her lawsuit, Sylvia Abano Martinez Arambulo accused Roman
Catholic priest Ernesto Corral Villaroya of raping and impregnating
her in the Philippines 19 years ago. She and her son, Jonathan Tomas
Martinez Arambulo, now 18, sued the archdiocese in August, alleging a
conspiracy to cover up Villaroya's conduct.</LD>
<LD>   But Superior Court Judge L. Jeffrey Wiatt ruled Thursday that
Arambulo lacked evidence that the archdiocese had taken part in any
conspiracy and ordered her attorney, George S. Goldberg of Encino, to
pay $14,405 in sanctions.</LD>
<TE>   "It appears that this lawsuit was filed to obtain publicity and
not for any proper purpose," Wiatt wrote in his four-page ruling.</TE>
<TE>   Goldberg, Arambulo and her son made public their allegations
against the archdiocese at a news conference in late August in the
shadow of Our Lady of the Angels Cathedral in downtown Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   An archdiocese spokesman said at the time that Villaroya was not a
priest in the Los Angeles Archdiocese but during the 1990s lived in
Los Angeles and performed priestly functions. He was ordered by the
archdiocese to stop.</TE>
<TE>   The judge also ruled that all of the allegations, ranging from
fraud to intentional infliction of emotional distress, were barred by
the one-year statute of limitations.</TE>
<TE>   Attorney J. Michael Hennigan, who represents the archdiocese,
called the courtroom victory "minor." The alleged rape took place in
the Philippines and involved a priest who never worked for the
Archdiocese of Los Angeles, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a frivolous case," Hennigan said.</TE>
<TE>   Goldberg said Thursday that he planned to appeal the court's
ruling.</TE>

<HD>D.A. Urges Convictions in Jogger Rape Be Overturned</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Josh Getlin</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Manhattan's district attorney, reversing course in a racially
incendiary crime, recommended Thursday that a judge overturn the
convictions of five black and Latino youths in the notorious 1989
beating and rape of a white jogger in Central Park.</LD>
<LD>   Citing new evidence -- and the probability that it could have
changed the outcome of the defendants' 1990 trials -- Robert J.
Morgenthau ignored pleas from members of his own staff who prosecuted
the original case and endorsed the account of a serial rapist who
claimed that he alone had attacked the 28-year-old woman after dark.</LD>
<LD>   Morgenthau, who issued a statement, said the decision "was the
result of an exhaustive investigation" triggered by the confession
earlier this year of Matias Reyes, 31, who is serving a life sentence
for rape and murder in another case. After investigating Reyes'
confession and conducting extensive DNA tests, there is "a
probability that if that evidence had been available at trial, the
verdicts would have been more favorable to the defendants," the
veteran prosecutor said.</LD>
<TE>   The highly unusual recommendation came in response to a motion by
lawyers for the five defendants, who had requested that all of the
convictions be vacated. Supreme Court Judge Charles Tejada will issue
a final decision in the matter by Feb. 6, but it is considered highly
unlikely that he will overrule Morgenthau's conclusions.</TE>
<TE>   The five youths, who were 14 to 16 at the time of the crime, were
convicted of rape and assault and have since completed prison
sentences ranging from seven to 13 years. Although they admitted to
the crime in videotaped confessions, their attorneys have long argued
that police coerced the statements. Due to the traumatic nature of
her injuries, the jogger -- who has since recovered and lives in
Connecticut -- could not remember any details of the attack and was
never able to identify those who assaulted her. She is writing a book
about her recovery, and has said through a spokeswoman that her only
wish is that the truth comes out.</TE>
<TE>   Despite his recent confession, Reyes cannot be prosecuted for the
Central Park rape because the statute of limitations has run out,
according to prosecutors.</TE>
<TE>   "I thank God for this day, for this victory," said an emotional
Angela Cuffee, sister of Kevin Richardson, one of the five
defendants, after the release of Morgenthau's 58-page report. "The
real story has finally come out, and my little brother has his name
back. But, you know, he was just a boy at the time, and he had to
grow up in prison."</TE>
<TE>   Deloris Wise, mother of defendant Kharey Wise, said: "I was always
a tough and strong mom, so I never cried through all of this. I just
wanted to fight back. My boy was innocent, he wanted to be a cop, and
look at what all of you did to him. I mean you -- the police, the
media. You all tried to destroy us, but I always knew that he was not
a rapist. He was my little boy. And today, the whole world knows."</TE>
<TE>   Attorneys representing the family were equally blunt, accusing the
police and district attorney's office of coercing false confessions.
While none has spoken publicly about filing civil lawsuits against
the city, the threat of potential litigation -- based on allegations
of official misconduct -- was an unspoken subtext.</TE>
<TE>   However, Morgenthau's report would not appear to give these
attorneys much ammunition because it pointedly avoids any criticism
of the police investigation and the way prosecutors handled the
trials. The prosecutor, a legendary New York figure who has run the
Manhattan district attorney's office since 1975, based his entire
decision in the case on Matias' confession and other new evidence.</TE>
<TE>   "There is clearly wrongdoing on the part of the police officers in
this case," defense attorney Michael Warren said after the decision
was released, suggesting that an investigation be launched into the
interrogations.</TE>
<TE>   As family members and attorneys were jubilant, some police
officials and prosecutors were infuriated. Since the controversy
surfaced this year, they had insisted that Reyes' confession about
raping the jogger -- however accurate it might be -- did not
exonerate the other defendants.</TE>
<TE>   Linda Fairstein, who headed the sex crimes unit of Morgenthau's
office, has said the severity of the jogger's injuries -- she had
lost nearly 80% of her blood when discovered in a ravine -- could not
have been caused by just one person.</TE>
<TE>   Looking back at the night of April 19, 1989, an evening when packs
of violent teenagers roamed through Central Park, many police
officials continue to believe that the basic credibility of the five
defendants' confessions has not been seriously undermined.</TE>
<TE>   "This new evidence, all it does is implicate an additional
perpetrator," said Michael Palladino, vice president of the
Detectives' Endowment Assn. "None of the evidence exonerates or
eliminates the additional five; it doesn't change that."</TE>
<TE>   Yet Morgenthau's report may alter the way New York remembers the
jogger case. For years, the conventional wisdom was that the
athletic, Salomon Bros. banker was set upon by a gang of teenagers
who lived in a cluster of nearby Harlem housing projects. The term
"wilding" grew out of the appalling attack on her and at least 10
others in the park who were beaten and robbed that night.</TE>
<TE>   During the 1990 trials, prosecutors produced scant physical
evidence linking the defendants to the attack. A drop of semen found
on one of the jogger's socks did not match the DNA of any of those
accused, nor did hair fibers found on several of the defendants'
clothing conclusively match the victim. The videotaped confessions --
which followed hours of police interrogations -- were considered
pivotal to the five rape convictions.</TE>
<TE>   The case was considered closed, but that changed in late 2001,
when Reyes had a chance encounter with Wise in the Auburn
Correctional Facility, an upstate prison, according to Morgenthau's
report. After Reyes learned that Wise was still serving time for
raping the jogger, he allegedly was overcome with feelings of guilt
and sought out prison officials, telling them he had committed the
rape alone.</TE>
<TE>   When DNA test results in May linked him positively to the attack,
Morgenthau's office commenced an intensive reexamination of more than
15,000 pages of evidence and testimony.</TE>
<TE>   New tests cast light on the case: Hair fibers that had been linked
by prosecutors to the jogger and introduced as evidence during the
trials, for example, could not be identified with any scientific
precision. A rock from the crime scene that allegedly contained her
blood was also suspect, based on new testing.</TE>
<TE>   Anticipating criticism that Reyes was a psychopath who could not
be trusted, Morgenthau's report noted that he had given investigators
a precise description of the crime scene and the nature of the
jogger's injuries.</TE>
<TE>   The five defendants, by contrast, had volunteered significantly
differing versions of the attack and where it occurred.</TE>
<TE>   Just as important, the district attorney noted, Reyes had credibly
confessed to a series of other rapes for which he had never been
prosecuted. He described a wave of violent attacks on white women in
their 20s, including an assault on a woman in Central Park two days
before the attack on the jogger.</TE>
<TE>   All were corroborated by investigators.</TE>
<TE>   Morgenthau told Judge Tejada that, if the five convictions are
overturned, his office would not move to retry any of the defendants.
Roger Wareham, an attorney for three of those accused, praised that
recommendation, and said history will show that the case against the
five boys was more about racism than evidence.</TE>
<TE>   "Their only crime," he said, "was being black and Latino in
Central Park."</TE>

<HD>The Crude Politics of Trading Oil</HD>
<DH>Despite an abysmal record on human rights, Equatorial
Guinea is a major U.S. supplier.</DH>

<AU>Ken Silverstein</AU>
<BD>Special to The Times</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Strange things happen around here when a country discovers oil.</LD>
<LD>   For most of its 34 years of independence, Equatorial Guinea was
best known for the outlandish brutality of its rulers, which left the
tiny West African country isolated on the international stage.</LD>
<LD>   Then in the mid-1990s, American oil companies found vast oil
reserves there and Washington quickly took notice. Two years ago,
Rep. William J. Jefferson (D-La.) led the first congressional
delegation there. The Bush administration, faced with heavy lobbying
from the oil industry and eager to reduce U.S. dependence on Middle
East oil, reopened the U.S. Embassy in Equatorial Guinea, which was
shuttered in 1995.</LD>
<TE>   Now, the U.S. is Equatorial Guinea's major trading partner and the
country will soon become sub-Saharan Africa's third-largest oil
producer behind Nigeria and Angola. African countries already provide
the United States with about 15% of its oil, nearly as much as Saudi
Arabia, and that figure could grow to 25% by 2015, according to the
National Intelligence Council, a panel of intelligence officials and
outside experts that studies global trends and reports to the
director of the CIA..</TE>
<TE>   It all sounds like a successful case study of how Washington and
U.S. corporations, faced with turmoil in the Mideast and a potential
war in Iraq, have been aggressively seeking out new suppliers of oil.</TE>
<TE>   There's just one problem: Equatorial Guinea is headed by an
embarrassingly corrupt government with a notorious human rights
record.</TE>
<TE>   That's made it difficult for the Bush administration to openly
embrace its president, Brig. Gen. Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo, so
he and his oil industry supporters have lined up Beltway lobbyists
and assorted hangers-on to press Washington for improved ties.
Equatorial Guinea doesn't need foreign aid -- thanks to oil, the
long-impoverished nation could become the world's richest country in
per capita terms within the decade -- but it does want to be treated
with respect by the U.S. and shed its pariah status.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the regime's opponents, some with political handlers of
their own, have been parading through town to offer themselves to the
State Department and other agencies as more palatable alternatives to
Obiang. "There's a recognition on the part of opposition leaders that
Washington is now paying much closer attention to Equatorial Guinea
and it will serve them well if they keep people here informed," said
Christopher Fomunyoh of the National Democratic Institute, the
foreign policy arm of the Democratic Party.</TE>
<TE>   The backdrop for all this maneuvering is Equatorial Guinea's Dec.
15 presidential election. It's pretty much a foregone conclusion that
Obiang, who took power in a 1979 coup against his uncle, will rack up
an overwhelming if questionable victory at the polls. In 1996, the
only time he faced voters, Obiang won with 99.2% of the vote in this
country of 500,000 people.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. relations with Equatorial Guinea have long ranged from cool
to outright chilly. In 1993, U.S. Ambassador John Bennett received a
death threat in an anonymous note sent, he believed, by a
high-ranking official in Obiang's government. Two years later the
Clinton administration closed the U.S. Embassy in Malabo, the
capital.</TE>
<TE>   There has been little ground for improved ties since then. The
country's human rights record is still considered abysmal and much of
Equatorial Guinea's new oil wealth appears to be finding its way into
the pockets of the president and his cronies. In 2000, Obiang bought
two mansions in the Maryland suburbs outside of Washington. The
bigger estate cost $2.6 million and has 10 bathrooms, seven
fireplaces and a 3,500-square-foot club room.</TE>
<TE>   But by last year U.S. firms -- led by Exxon Mobil Corp.,
ChevronTexaco Corp. and Triton Energy -- had a substantial stake in
Equatorial Guinea. They have invested a collective $5 billion in the
country and have been lobbying for strengthened relations with the
United States.</TE>
<TE>   That effort was coordinated by Dallas-based Triton, a firm with
close ties to the Bush administration. When Triton's chairman, Tom
Hicks, bought the Texas Rangers from George W. Bush in 1998 when the
latter was Texas governor, Bush made a substantial profit. Federal
Election Commission records show that Hicks has personally
contributed more than $125,000 to Bush and the Republican Party's
national committees during the last three years.</TE>
<TE>   In mid-2001, a Triton lobbyist sent a memo to President Bush
urging the administration to take a new look at Equatorial Guinea.
"It is important to underscore that most of the oil and gas
concessions awarded in Equatorial Guinea to date, have been awarded
to U.S. firms," the memo said. "This is in stark contrast to
neighboring countries in the region, where the United States has
consistently lost out to French and other European and Asian
competitors."</TE>
<TE>   A few months later, the administration quietly decided to reopen
the American Embassy. A U.S. official, speaking on the condition of
anonymity, said it had been closed in 1995 because of human rights
and budget concerns. But since the discovery of oil, U.S. investment
and the number of U.S. citizens living and working there have
increased steadily.</TE>
<TE>   "There are over 1,500 Americans there and that number is expected
to increase as the oil companies increase their involvement," the
official said. The U.S. government continues to have human rights
concerns, and given the growing American presence it was deemed
prudent to reopen the embassy, the official said.</TE>
<TE>   Even as Triton was heading the lobbying campaign, company
officials were negotiating the firm's sale to Amerada Hess for $2.7
billion. The new owner's bottom line is closely tied to its
operations in Equatorial Guinea.</TE>
<TE>   Amerada Hess produces 39,000 barrels a day there, more than it
does anywhere else except for the U.S. and Britain. Chief Executive
John Hess recently said that a majority of the company's production
growth over the next three years will come from Equatorial Guinea.</TE>
<TE>   Not surprisingly, Amerada Hess continues to be at the forefront of
the corporate lobbying for Obiang. To handle that task, the company
retains Washington lobbyist Riva Levinson of BKSH &amp; Associates, whose
clients have ranged from an Angolan rebel group and Iraqi opponents
of Saddam Hussein to an association of medical colleges and PBS.</TE>
<TE>   Obiang's regime has its own hired help as well. For several years,
it has paid for the services of Bruce McColm, head of a nonprofit
group called the Institute for Democratic Strategies. According to
its nonprofit tax filings, the Institute received $212,442 from the
Obiang government in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   McColm, a former director of Freedom House, denied being an
advocate for the Obiang government, saying he is simply helping the
country build its democratic institutions. But two years ago, McColm
sent a team of observers to monitor Equatorial Guinea's municipal
elections, reporting them to be basically free and fair. A United
Nations report, on the other hand, found that the campaign "was
characterized by the omnipresence of the [ruling] party, voting in
public and the intimidating presence of the armed forces."</TE>
<TE>   Charles Lewis, director of the Center for Public Integrity, a
Washington watchdog group, said oil is driving U.S. policy. "That's
the only reason that this obscure country has come on the
administration's radar screen," he said. "The U.S. gets a new source
of oil and some of the president's friends get rich."</TE>
<TE>   Still, the administration has been reluctant to become too cozy
with Obiang. Because of his government's poor record on political
rights, Equatorial Guinea remains barred from receiving special trade
benefits offered to most African states under a bill passed by
Congress in 2000. So are 12 of the 48 other sub-Saharan African
nations that would be theoretically eligible for the trade benefits</TE>
<TE>   The State Department's most recent report on worldwide human
rights said the country's security forces "committed numerous,
serious human rights abuses," including torture and beatings, and
that citizens "do not have the ability to change their government
peacefully" in fair elections. "We are concerned about the human
rights situation in Equatorial Guinea," said Pamela Bellamy, the
State Department's desk officer for the country. "It is a real issue
for us."</TE>
<TE>   Despite requests from Obiang, he has never met with Bush or
Secretary of State Colin L. Powell. "Any foreign leader wants to be
able to see the president when he comes to Washington," said one
former State Department official, who asked not to be identified.
"We're managing the relationship with Equatorial Guinea at the
assistant secretary level, which is a real insult."</TE>
<TE>   That distance has encouraged four would-be Guinean presidents to
come to Washington to press their respective cases with the Bush
administration. Among them is Gustavo Envela, whose family fled into
exile in 1970 and settled in Oregon.</TE>
<TE>   Envela now lives in Los Angeles and doesn't have much of a
political history. His resume boasts cameo roles in movies such as
"Sgt. Bilko" and an appearance on the TV game show "Wheel of
Fortune." Envela has only been back to Equatorial Guinea twice, for a
total of less than two weeks, most recently in 1990.</TE>
<TE>   Envela got help scheduling his Washington agenda from Robert
Kelley, a lobbyist and onetime deputy Senate legal counsel. He has
also been seeking advice from ex-Clinton advisor James Carville and
has been working with Warren Weinstein, formerly of the U.S. Agency
for International Development and now at AfricaGlobal, a Washington
organization whose past clients include Obiang.</TE>
<TE>   Adolfo Obiang Biko, who lives part-time in Virginia has also been
in to see the State Department. A leader of the national movement
that won independence from Spain, Biko quickly ran afoul of the new
government and has lived abroad for more than three decades.</TE>
<TE>   Biko was accompanied in the capital by his friend Frank Ruddy, who
served as U.S. ambassador to Equatorial Guinea under President
Reagan. "Obiang is an absolute thief and he heads a government of
thieves," said Ruddy, who said he was not paid for his help. "I'd
like to see something good happen over there and Adolfo is someone
who is worth listening to."</TE>
<TE>   In early November, a third man was making the rounds, Celestino
Bacale of the Convergence for Social Democracy (CPDS), the country's
only genuine opposition party (and the only one of the four who lives
in Equatorial Guinea). Its leader, Placido Miko, was one of dozens of
people sentenced to prison earlier this year on charges of coup
plotting.</TE>
<TE>   Amnesty International described the court proceedings against Miko
and others as "an unfair trial where no evidence was presented
against any defendant, many of whom have been tortured to extract
confessions."</TE>
<TE>   Bacale, his party's presidential candidate, said he had productive
meetings here, but suspects that the Bush administration cares more
about Equatorial Guinea's oil than it does about human rights. "None
of the oil money is getting to the people," he said. "It just allows
the government to live well and to repress the people."</TE>
<TE>   The latest would-be Guinean president to come to town, arriving in
late November, was Severo Moto, a Madrid-based exile. He retained
Victoria Butler, an independent consultant, to help him navigate the
capital.</TE>
<TE>   In 1996, Moto tried to organize a coup against Obiang from Angola.
Authorities there learned of the plan and detained Moto and a small
group of Guineans, Spaniards and Russians. They also seized a ship
donated to the group, Moto said, by an Italian businessman who had a
business deal with Obiang turn sour.</TE>
<TE>   Moto spent a month in jail in Angola and then was allowed to
return to Spain. "I went to Angola to seek liberty for my people,"
said Moto. "I came to believe that the only way that Obiang would
leave office was by force."</TE>
<TE>   Now, Moto is pushing for free and fair elections in Equatorial
Guinea, although he is dubious about that possibility.</TE>
<TE>   The State Department's Bellamy said there is nothing unusual about
all the meetings with Guinean oppositionists. "It's a country where
there is a considerable amount of U.S. investment and where many U.S.
citizens work, so it's logical that we would be seeing them
[opposition figures]," she said. "They're talking to us about what
they think about the situation there and what they have to offer."</TE>
<TE>   J. Stephen Morrison, who formerly was responsible for African
affairs on the State Department's Policy Planning Staff, said talking
with the opposition also serves to put Obiang on notice. "It's a
pretty unsavory regime and no one has any illusions about that," he
said. "That sort of rule tends to be unstable and you spread your
risks around by talking to different types of people."</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>BOGOUINE, Ivory Coast</DL>
<LD>Thousands of fearful civilians fled Ivory Coast's hilly west
Thursday, some crammed into rickety minibuses, others singing songs,
as the army battled the latest group of rebels to emerge in the
fractured West African nation.</LD>
<LD>   Hundreds of people walked down the road south of Man, a key cocoa
city that has seen some of the heaviest fighting in a two-month war
between the government and two independent rebel groups.</LD>
<LD>   "There are too many dead. You can't even count them," said
Germaine Gahie, carrying a cloth bundle on her head.</LD>
<TE>   Rebels have seized several towns in the west, including Danane,
southwest of Man. Farther south, authorities said, "large-scale
operations" were underway to dislodge rebels holding Toulepleu, near
the Liberian border.</TE>
<TE>   Rebels seized Man last week and government soldiers ousted them
Sunday in a fierce assault with helicopter gunships and tanks.
Fleeing residents said the streets were strewn with corpses.</TE>
<TE>   "Most of them were rebels," said a woman who would only give her
first name, Laure. Eight months pregnant, she stood by a thatch hut
in Bogouine waiting for a place on a bus.</TE>
<TE>   The rebel uprising began Sept. 19 in Ivory Coast, the world's
leading cocoa producer. The government holds the south, including the
key port and economic hub of Abidjan; the insurgents behind the
September uprising hold the north; and the new rebel force is
battling the army in the west.</TE>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Word of Roone Arledge's death came Thursday as the news division he
built was basking in its latest ratings coup -- Diane Sawyer's
exclusive interview the night before, filled with talk of drug use
and marital discord, with singer Whitney Houston.</LD>
<LD>   Arledge, the pioneering president of ABC News and ABC Sports, as
much as anyone helped define and shape modern broadcast news and
sports coverage for both better and worse -- championing stylistic
innovations that fundamentally changed how such programs are
presented, sometimes at the expense of content.</LD>
<LD>   "If you think about news in our time, it's just synonymous with
Roone Arledge," Barbara Walters said in a statement posted on ABC's
Web site.</LD>
<TE>   This is undoubtedly the case. Yet his passing also comes at a time
when the generation that first dared blur news and entertainment,
which led television from black and white into color, has been
marginalized by a consolidated media industry that leaves less room
for maverick executives and firebrand producers.</TE>
<TE>   Recent developments betray this corporate influence, and the
diminution of the old guard. Don Hewitt -- the producer patriarch
behind "60 Minutes," a week shy of his 80th birthday -- has been
making noise about being elbowed out by CBS (a contention the network
has denied).</TE>
<TE>   ABC News, under the stewardship of the Walt Disney Co., has been
in ongoing talks with AOL Time Warner about merging its news
operations with cable network CNN as a cost-cutting maneuver.</TE>
<TE>   Disney also flirted with David Letterman, seeking to woo the CBS
late-night host away last spring. That move would have probably
spelled the end for "Nightline," the prestigious late-night broadcast
established under Arledge. ABC News President David Westin was said
to have been ambushed when news of Letterman's courtship surfaced,
something people couldn't imagine happening on Arledge's watch.</TE>
<TE>   Each of these episodes underlines the fact that broadcast news, as
a small part of companies like Disney, CBS owner Viacom, General
Electric's NBC and Fox parent News Corp., has become just another
consumer product. News divisions can serve a higher purpose -- as the
networks admirably demonstrated on Sept. 11 -- but cannot ignore the
bottom line.</TE>
<TE>   In this context, referring to legendary CBS newsmen Edward R.
Murrow and Walter Cronkite in a discussion of broadcast news -- as
Hewitt did during a recent "Larry King Live" interview -- is
tantamount to citing a Shakespeare play in connection with one of
"The Matrix" sequels. Yes, both are dramas, but given the altered
storytelling approach and business model, most similarities basically
end there.</TE>
<TE>   Arledge, Hewitt and their contemporaries recognized the
relationship between news and entertainment, finding a way to turn TV
newsmagazines -- driven by star anchors and spiced by marketable
subject matter -- into profit centers.</TE>
<TE>   Still, it's doubtful when "20/20" premiered almost a
quarter-century ago how many excesses foreshadowed by the 1976 movie
"Network" would eventually come true, from wholesale use of news as a
promotional vehicle to the transformation of news personnel into
entertainers.</TE>
<TE>   Consider Anderson Cooper, who went from news correspondent to
ABC's unscripted program "The Mole," then back to news at CNN. CBS
News' Julie Chen hosts the network's prime-time show "Big Brother."
Meredith Vieira left "60 Minutes" for daytime's "The View," and this
fall added quiz-show host to her resume, on "Who Wants to Be a
Millionaire."</TE>
<TE>   Arledge was, by any measure, a visionary, someone who inspired
loyalty among his troops and knew how to rile competitors. Foremost,
he was a showman, able to impress various constituencies, from the
network's affiliated stations to advertisers. Tellingly, Westin, who
succeeded him as president of ABC News, was ABC's former legal
counsel. He's considered an intelligent but low-key executive, the
sort who doesn't cast the same larger-than-life shadow -- or provoke
the kind of apprehension -- that might have caused his employers to
think twice before risking their financially driven pursuit of
Letterman.</TE>
<TE>   Then again, in the modern world of television, it's generally wise
to fit inside the box.</TE>

<HD>Boston Priest Fathered 2 Children, Files Show</HD>
<DH>He also was present when woman had fatal drug overdose,
records reveal. Cleric abruptly leaves parish but denies involvement.</DH>

<DL>BOSTON</DL>
<LD>A Roman Catholic priest here fathered at least two children in the
1960s and was present when their mother suffered a fatal drug
overdose, according to documents made public Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   The personnel files of Father James D. Foley, who abruptly left
his parish Thursday in Salem, Mass., were contained in more than
11,000 pages of church records released by the archdiocese under
court order in connection with a series of civil lawsuits.</LD>
<LD>   The previously confidential files include handwritten notes from a
1993 meeting initialed "B.C.L.," the initials of Bernard Cardinal
Law, the archbishop of Boston. According to the notes, the meeting
focused on the 1965 incident in which a woman "overdosed" while Foley
was present. She fainted, Foley left the room, got dressed and called
for medical assistance, and "she died," the notes said. The files
contain no indication that church officials contacted police after
learning of the incident. However, the record of the meeting takes
note of "the scandal issue" and includes an item reading "criminal
issue?"</LD>
<TE>   Attorney Roderick MacLeish Jr. said he ran across the case
Wednesday night while reading some of the thousands of pages of
material on sexually abusive priests in the Boston Archdiocese over
the last 40 years. He represents scores of victims seeking redress
from church officials here.</TE>
<TE>   "This woman died. Father Foley got dressed and left the scene,"
MacLeish said. The lawyer said he was distressed to learn that Foley
was still in the ministry when "the Archdiocese of Boston has gone on
record to say that the people of Boston are safe from sexually
abusive priests. I always thought that included adult women as well."</TE>
<TE>   MacLeish notified the attorney general's office here of his
finding early Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   A man who answered the telephone at St. Joseph's parish in Salem,
north of Boston, said that as of late Thursday, Foley was no longer
associated with the parish. The man, who would not identify himself,
said he was uncertain of Foley's whereabouts.</TE>
<TE>   Archdiocesan spokeswoman Donna M. Morrissey was unavailable for
comment.</TE>
<TE>   But a Boston television station found Foley, 73, at the parish
house early Thursday. The priest denied any involvement in the
incident in question.</TE>
<TE>   "I have an outstanding record in the archdiocese," Foley told New
England Cable News. "There has never been any hint of impropriety."</TE>
<TE>   Foley did confirm to a Boston Globe reporter, however, that he
wrote a 1994 letter to Father John B. McCormack, now bishop of New
Hampshire, after the cardinal's review board recommended that he
resign his pastoral duties. The board also urged Foley to "meet with
the archdiocesan legal counsel in order to develop a resolve around
his civil and moral responsibility toward his children," and
suggested the priest go on "a lengthy retreat."</TE>
<TE>   The priest's letter goes on to note that "the woman's death"
occurred "over 25 years ago, and it is in the interest of no one to
open that tragic story." He continues: "I will regret to my dying day
the circumstances, but I cannot turn back the clock nor bring back
the dead. How can the church suffer scandal from an episode that will
never possibly be revealed?"</TE>
<TE>   Foley nevertheless stepped down as pastor at Our Lady of Fatima in
suburban Sudbury. His file contains several letters from parishioners
expressing regret at his departure. Also among the records is a 1994
letter from Foley to Law.</TE>
<TE>   "I did leak out ... the real reason for resigning the parish,"
Foley wrote. "Obviously I did so in the most self-serving manner,
disclosing only those parts of the story guaranteed to win me
sympathy and withholding the damaging parts.... Only you knew the
full story, and you were talented enough to see that despite my
apparently successful ministry, underneath was a badly wounded man."</TE>

<LD>A small plane crashed into the Federal Reserve Bank Building during a
holiday party Thursday night, killing the pilot, officials said. No
one inside the building was injured.</LD>
<LD>   "It appears to be an accident," said Federal Aviation
Administration spokeswoman Laura Brown in Washington.</LD>
<LD>   More than 100 people including the bank's current and former
directors were in the one-story building when the aircraft slammed
into the northeast side, exploded and burst into flames.</LD>
<TE>   Based on communications between the pilot and air traffic
controllers, Brown said the plane likely was coming from Marathon in
the Florida Keys and was bound for New Smyrna Beach on the central
east coast.</TE>

<HD>Pharmacist Gets 30 Years for Diluting Drugs</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>KANSAS CITY, Mo.</DL>
<LD>A pharmacist who diluted chemotherapy drugs for thousands of cancer
patients was sentenced to the maximum of 30 years in prison Thursday
after the victims' families tearfully told how the scheme had cost
them precious days with their loved ones.</LD>
<LD>   "Your crimes are a shock to the civilized conscience," U.S.
District Judge Ortrie Smith told Robert R. Courtney. "They are beyond
understanding."</LD>
<LD>   Courtney, 50, was also ordered to pay $10.4 million in restitution
and a $25,000 fine. He showed no emotion as the judge announced his
sentence.</LD>
<TE>   His lawyers said he was remorseful, and they urged the judge to
impose the lightest possible sentence under the plea agreement, 17
1/2 years without parole.</TE>
<TE>   "I have committed a terrible crime that I deeply and severely
regret," Courtney told the court in a soft, shaky voice before being
sentenced. "I wish I could change everything."</TE>
<TE>   But federal prosecutors requested the maximum for a "cold-blooded"
crime they said hastened at least one patient's death and was
motivated by greed.</TE>
<TE>   "What did these women lose? What did he take from them to satisfy
his avarice? He took their hope and quality of life," prosecutor Gene
Porter said.</TE>
<TE>   Courtney pleaded guilty in February to 20 counts of altering the
cancer drugs Taxol and Gemzar. Those counts stem from his dilution of
158 chemotherapy doses prepared for 34 patients of a Kansas City
doctor.</TE>
<TE>   But Courtney admitted in his plea agreement he had been diluting
drugs since 1992, affecting as many as 4,200 patients, 400 doctors
and 98,000 prescriptions.</TE>
<TE>   Muffled sobs could be heard in the courtroom Thursday as witnesses
testified. So many people -- cancer patients and their relatives,
reporters, lawyers and Courtney's family and friends -- attended that
officials provided a closed-circuit TV feed to another room in the
courthouse.</TE>
<TE>   "I leave Robert Courtney in your hands for his lifetime, and in
the Lord's hands for eternity," said patient Georgia Hayes, who
earlier won a $2.2-billion verdict in her lawsuit against him. "May
God have mercy on his soul."</TE>
<TE>   Steven Coates showed a picture of his wife, Evelyn "Johnnie"
Coates, who died of cancer last year at 53, shortly before the
investigation became public.</TE>
<TE>   Coates said his wife was not able to fulfill her dream of watching
her infant grandson grow up. In the weeks before her death, she was
in so much pain that she was unable to hold the boy.</TE>
<TE>   "She still thought she would beat this dreaded disease, not
knowing she was playing against a stacked deck," Coates said.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors said while the diluting of the drugs probably hastened
some deaths, proving it in court would be difficult.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>MIAMI</DL>
<LD>Nearly 120 people have been sickened with symptoms consistent with a
Norwalk-like virus on the fourth cruise ship to report an outbreak of
a stomach ailment in recent weeks, the federal Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention in Atlanta said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   The Oceana, operated by P&amp;O Cruises of Great Britain, reported 114
passengers and three crew members have been treated for some sort of
virus on the cruise.</LD>
<LD>   More than 1,000 people have recently gotten sick on cruise ships,
but operators and travel agents said the problems have not
significantly affected business.</LD>
<TE>   The Oceana, carrying 1,859 passengers on a 15-night trip, is on
its third cruise since its Nov. 1 inaugural voyage from Fort
Lauderdale's Port Everglades.</TE>

<HD>Significant Drop Is Reported in Drunken Driving-Related
Deaths</HD>
<DH>The largest decreases were with motorists under age 21, CDC
says. Stricter laws a factor.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>ATLANTA</DL>
<LD>Alcohol-related crashes in the U.S. that resulted in death have
fallen significantly in the last 20 years, with the largest decreases
involving drivers under age 21, federal health officials said
Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   The national Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said fatal
crashes in which drivers had blood alcohol levels of 0.01% or greater
fell 46% among all ages from 1982 to 2001. The agency credited
stricter drunken driving laws and driver licensing programs, among
other factors.</LD>
<LD>   The agency said fatal drinking-related crash rates fell 60% among
drivers ages 16 to 17, the biggest decrease for all age groups. Crash
rates fell 55% for drivers ages 18 to 20, and 41% for motorists ages
21 to 24. Among drivers age 25 and older, the crash rates fell 39%.</LD>
<TE>   Car crashes are the leading cause of death among people ages 16 to
24, and a substantial number involve alcohol, the CDC said. There
were 17,448 U.S. alcohol-related deaths in 2001, down from 26,173 in
1982, it said.</TE>
<TE>   "These are particularly tragic deaths because they are completely
preventable," said Randy Elder, a research fellow at the CDC's
National Center for Injury Prevention and Control.</TE>
<TE>   The CDC said the 1984 Uniform Drinking Age Act, which required
states to set the minimum legal drinking age at 21 by 1988, had
helped to reduce drunken driving. The agency also cited
"zero-tolerance" blood-alcohol standards for drivers under the legal
drinking age as a factor contributing to the lower rates of fatal
crashes.</TE>

<HD>Industries Plan Terror Recovery</HD>
<DH>Key economic infrastructures are resilient, business
representatives say.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tom Gorman</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>LAS VEGAS</DL>
<LD>Big utilities and the transportation, communication and oil
industries are resigned that they will not be able to fully protect
themselves from terrorist attack, but are confident they could
recover sufficiently to function in the wake of one, homeland
security officials were told Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   The same factor that makes them most vulnerable -- a network of
widely dispersed assets -- also allows them to circumvent
interruptions, whether the target is railroad lines, fiber optics
cables or oil pipelines, industry representatives told a conference
sponsored by the Western Governors' Assn. and the federal Critical
Infrastructure Assurance Office.</LD>
<LD>   The nation's financially strapped towns and cities face their own
problems in responding to terrorism because the federal government
has not provided funding to bolster local emergency services, one
speaker complained.</LD>
<TE>   "We still face enormous needs," said Mary Poss, a Dallas city
councilwoman and co-chair of the homeland security task force of the
National League of Cities. Last month's passage of the Homeland
Security Act provided no funding for local emergency crews, she
noted, "and cities were very disappointed."</TE>
<TE>   If local governments make homeland security a priority, without
federal aid they will have to eliminate other public services, Poss
said.</TE>
<TE>   Other speakers warned of continuing shortfalls in communications
that will handicap public agencies and private industry in the event
of a catastrophic attack.</TE>
<TE>   Challenges as basic as gaining quick approval to move machines and
equipment past police and fire lines -- or allowing Canadian utility
workers to reinforce local crews in the Northwest -- still confront
emergency planners, said Washington state legislator Jeff Morris.</TE>
<TE>   Frank Ianna, president of AT&amp;T Network Services, said the company
has four fleets of tractor-trailers around the country filled with
switching equipment and other hardware needed to repair and replace
stricken facilities.</TE>
<TE>   The company is planning a similar strategy for overseas because
there are no assurances, he said, that the company will be able to
fly equipment anywhere after an attack.</TE>
<TE>   Utilities debate how much equipment should be placed in reserve,
said Terry Winter, president of the California Independent Systems
Operator, which oversees the transmission of electricity through much
of the state.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no way we have enough people or money to protect the
entire system," he said. But because the state's grid is already
designed to withstand earthquakes, electricity would similarly be
rerouted in the event of an attack, he said to the audience of 250.</TE>
<TE>   Western governors will hold another session today to identify
which issues -- including health care, forest management and energy
development -- they want Washington to address in 2003.</TE>

<HD>Bush Visit Turns La. Race Into a Dead Heat</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>BATON ROUGE, La.</DL>
<LD>Boosted by the popularity of President Bush, Republican Suzanne Haik
Terrell has climbed into a dead heat in her bid to oust Democratic
Sen. Mary Landrieu, and she could give the GOP a final triumph in the
midterm elections.</LD>
<LD>   A Terrell victory Saturday would give Republicans a 52-48 edge in
the Senate and make her the first GOP senator from the state since
Reconstruction.</LD>
<LD>   The dominant issue in the race has been Bush. The two candidates
have told voters that they back the president as long as doing so
doesn't harm Louisianans -- Landrieu even makes it a point to say she
votes with Bush about 75% of the time.</LD>
<TE>   But it has been Terrell who has cashed in. Bush raised more than
$1 million for her this week, and analysts say a visit from a popular
president could be worth 2 or 3 percentage points at the polls.</TE>
<TE>   "Terrell clearly has the momentum now with the president's visit,"
said Wayne Parent, a political scientist at Louisiana State
University.</TE>
<TE>   A poll released this week by the University of New Orleans showed
the race in a dead heat, and pollsters predicted the outcome would
depend on the number of blacks who vote overall and how many whites
back Landrieu. The poll of 700 registered voters showed a split along
racial lines. Terrell had 56% of the white vote to 31% for Landrieu,
while Landrieu had 75% of the black vote to 10% for Terrell.</TE>
<TE>   However, white independents backed Terrell, 52% to 31%, and
analysts said that was because of Bush's popularity. The poll had a
margin of error of plus or minus 4 percentage points.</TE>
<TE>   Elliott Stonecipher, an independent political consultant in
Shreveport, said Terrell will win if she siphons off enough of
Landrieu's white base or energizes conservatives who might not have
voted.</TE>
<TE>   Landrieu, who is seeking a second term, landed in Saturday's
runoff by failing to win a majority of the vote Nov. 5 in the state's
unique open primary. Criticized for running a lackluster primary
campaign that some said depicted her as a "me too" Republican, she
launched a more aggressive attack on her opponent in a bid to appear
more independent.</TE>
<TE>   Landrieu, 46, has performed a balancing act since Bush has been in
office, trying not to offend conservative voters. For example, she
voted against so-called partial-birth abortions at the risk of losing
national abortion-rights support.</TE>
<TE>   Terrell, 48, meanwhile, has said that she would be more effective
in the Senate because she would have more access to GOP leaders --
drawing criticism from Landrieu that she would be a potential "rubber
stamp" for Bush.</TE>

<HD>McCain Blasts Bush Over FEC Nominee</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Sen. John McCain on Thursday accused President Bush of breaking a
written promise to speedily appoint a Democrat to the Federal
Election Commission, reigniting their roiling feud just as McCain is
about to regain the post of chairman of the Senate Commerce
Committee.</LD>
<LD>   McCain, an Arizona Republican, said he will "assume all future
assurances and promises by this administration to be quite possibly
insincere." He told the Washington Post that the White House delayed
the appointment as part of an "orchestrated and systematic
undermining" of campaign finance reform legislation he championed and
Bush only grudgingly supported.</LD>
<LD>   The FEC is writing regulations to implement the McCain-Feingold
campaign finance law and the current commissioners have approved
several loopholes. Supporters of McCain's proposed appointee, ethics
lawyer Ellen Weintraub, say she would vote for stricter rules.</LD>
<TE>   A White House official said Thursday that Bush plans to appoint
Weintraub this morning -- less than 24 hours after the FEC finished
the bulk of its work on the law. McCain called the timing cynical.</TE>
<TE>   "The Bush administration has broken their word on an issue that
has been of transcendent importance to me, and that's hard to get
over," said McCain, who ran against Bush in the 2000 presidential
primaries. "It will be harder for them to do business with the
Senate, since a lot of it is done by handshake."</TE>
<TE>   McCain -- who was not invited to the ceremony when Bush signed the
measure into law -- could launch investigations of the administration
when the GOP takes over the Senate in January and he regains the
chairmanship of the Committee on Commerce, Science and
Transportation.</TE>
<TE>   The White House made a deal with McCain in July to appoint
Weintraub to the FEC. Weintraub, a former Democratic counsel to the
House Ethics Committee, was the choice of Senate Majority Leader Tom
Daschle (D-S.D.). Until the deal was struck, nearly 100 of Bush's
judicial and administrative nominations had been held up.</TE>
<TE>   Even as the senator was voicing his anger Thursday, the FEC
adopted a disputed regulation that McCain and his allies say
epitomizes the kind of loophole Weintraub might have prevented.</TE>
<TE>   McCain and groups such as Common Cause and the Center for
Responsive Politics say the new regulation will let federal
candidates control the spending of unlimited amounts of corporate,
union and special interest "soft money" in the early stages of
federal campaigns. A key goal of the McCain-Feingold law is to bar
the national parties and federal candidates from raising and spending
soft money.</TE>

<HD>Panel Hears Final Thoughts on Campaign Finance Law</HD>
<DH>Plaintiff lawyers argue that the statute is too harsh on
parties and wealthy donors. It's also described as a raw deal for the
little guy.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Nick Anderson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Two days of arguments aimed at overturning a far-reaching campaign
finance law wrapped up in federal court Thursday with lawyers
continuing to assert that it cracks down too hard on political
parties, interest groups and wealthy donors.</LD>
<LD>   But one stood up to charge that the law is a raw deal for the
little guy.</LD>
<LD>   John Bonifaz, an attorney representing a group of individuals he
said are ordinary Americans, urged a special three-judge panel to
strike down certain provisions in the law that increase the amounts
of money presidential and congressional candidates can raise
directly.</LD>
<TE>   The judges, Bonifaz said, would have to decide whether federal
elections will be "open only to the wealthy and well-connected, or
whether our elections will be open to all."</TE>
<TE>   The law enacted this year prohibits national parties from raising
so-called soft money -- largely unregulated donations often given in
six- and seven-figure checks. That is a central point of dispute in
the court case, McConnell vs. Federal Election Commission, that
challenges the law as unconstitutional.</TE>
<TE>   But the law also expands the ability of candidates for federal
office to raise campaign contributions by doubling a decades-old
limit on individual donations, to $2,000 per election from $1,000.
Such donations are known as hard money.</TE>
<TE>   "These hard-money increases serve to entrench incumbents in
power," Bonifaz said.</TE>
<TE>   A government attorney, in defending the law, called the $2,000
limit per donor constitutional.</TE>
<TE>   As arguments ended in U.S. District Court, plaintiffs continued to
probe for weaknesses in the most significant campaign finance law of
the last quarter of a century.</TE>
<TE>   Some attacked a provision banning donations by minors. Government
attorneys countered that it was meant to stop parents from
circumventing donation limits.</TE>
<TE>   Others questioned a section that restricts communication between
interest groups and candidates or parties. Government lawyers said
that without this restriction, candidates and parties could benefit
from large sums of money spent by interest groups on political
activity.</TE>
<TE>   The panel is expected to issue its ruling by early next year. The
case is then expected to move directly to the Supreme Court for final
review.</TE>
<TE>   The arguments in a U.S. courthouse on Constitution Avenue at the
foot of Capitol Hill have been closely followed by many of those who
have been prominent in the debate over campaign finance regulations.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), who led opposition to the law in
Congress and is the lead plaintiff in the case against it, sat in the
front row Thursday and occasionally leaned forward to consult with
one of his attorneys, Kenneth W. Starr, the former independent
counsel who investigated President Clinton.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Russell D. Feingold (D-Wis.), a leading proponent of the law,
came to watch Wednesday. So did Marc Racicot, chairman of the
Republican National Committee, and Wayne LaPierre, executive vice
president of the National Rifle Assn.</TE>
<TE>   The RNC and NRA are among other plaintiffs seeking to have the law
overturned.</TE>
<TE>   In a related development Thursday, the FEC approved the latest in
a series of rules that it has issued this year to implement the law.</TE>
<TE>   The new rule attempts to spell out standards for judging when a
political advertisement has been coordinated with a candidate and
when it has not.</TE>
<TE>   The issue is important because independent advertising is not
subject to federal contribution limits. Coordinated ads, on the other
hand, are considered donations to a campaign and must be disclosed
and regulated like any other gift.</TE>
<TE>   In the new law, Congress directed the FEC to establish a tough new
rule, but gave the commission broad discretion on the wording.</TE>
<TE>   Under the rule approved Thursday, federal regulators will review
ads paid for by interest groups at any point in a campaign if the
commercials expressly call for a candidate's election or defeat. The
regulators will also review ads by interest groups that run within
120 days of an election and refer to a candidate or political party.</TE>
<TE>   Some reform advocates criticized the rule as inadequate.</TE>
<TE>   Larry Noble, executive director of the Center for Responsive
Politics, a group that tracks campaign donations, said the new rule
"blows a major hole" into the new law.</TE>
<TE>   He said the rule would invite interest groups to run ads that are
thinly disguised efforts to help or hinder candidates -- so long as
they are run before the 120-day period of heightened scrutiny.</TE>

<HD>Air Force Pilots Will Take a Day Off</HD>
<DH>Special training for U.S.-based fleet is meant to accent
safety after recent accidents.</DH>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>In response to a series of recent mishaps, U.S.-based Air Force
pilots will not fly today.</LD>
<LD>   Gen. Hal M. Hornburg, commander of Air Combat Command, said all
air crews will conduct mandatory training to focus on "flight
discipline, task prioritization and flight and maintenance
procedures."</LD>
<LD>   "While getting the job done is essential, we need to focus on
getting the job done safely," he said.</LD>
<TE>   Having the entire U.S.-based Air Force combat fleet take a day off
to focus on safety is unusual but not unprecedented.</TE>
<TE>   "It's understood that our people are stretched thin conducting the
global war on terrorism, other contingency operations and homeland
security missions over the United States, while preparing for
possible future conflicts," Hornburg said. "However, focusing on the
basics is every bit as vital in preparation for potential
contingencies as it is for maintaining safe flying operations at
home."</TE>
<TE>   Among the recent accidents involving Air Force planes:</TE>
<TE>   * On Wednesday, two A-10 Thunderbolt II jets collided over the
Nevada Test and Training Range near Las Vegas, killing one pilot. The
other ejected and was not hurt.</TE>
<TE>   * In mid-November, an Air Force Reserve F-16 crashed in Utah,
killing the pilot.</TE>
<TE>   * In July, an F-117 stealth fighter-bomber pilot accidentally
dropped three dummy bombs in New Mexico and Texas. One smashed
through the roof of a house. The Air Force later blamed pilot
inattention and breakdowns in safety procedures.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SALEM, Ore.</DL>
<LD>Two child welfare agency workers were fired Thursday for how the
agency handled reports that a girl was being sexually abused by a man
who now is charged with killing her and a friend.</LD>
<LD>   The two met with department officials Tuesday to present their
side of the story and received notices of dismissal Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   The agency received five calls in summer of 2001 to report that
Ashley Pond, 12, had accused neighbor Ward Weaver of sexually abusing
her. Police didn't learn of her accusation until after she
disappeared in January.</LD>
<TE>   The girl's body was found in August, buried beneath a concrete
slab that Weaver had installed at his home. The body of her friend,
13-year-old Miranda Gaddis, was found in a shed on Weaver's property.</TE>
<TE>   Weaver has pleaded not guilty to killing the two girls, who lived
in an apartment complex down the road. Prosecutors are seeking the
death penalty.</TE>
<TE>   The dismissed employees were identified as Darlene Walsh, a
supervisor who has worked for the department since 1990, and Colin
Fitzpatrick, a caseworker since 1998.</TE>

<DL>HICKAM AIR FORCE BASE, Hawaii</DL>
<LD>Remains believed to be those of U.S. servicemen killed in Laos and
Vietnam were returned to U.S. soil in a ceremony Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   One of the five sets of remains may be those of James B. McGovern
-- better known as "Earthquake McGoon," who became a household name
for his daring exploits in China and Southeast Asia 50 years ago --
or his co-pilot Wallace A. Buford.</LD>
<LD>   The two were shot down in Southern Laos in the last days of the
French Indochina war.</LD>
<TE>   McGovern, 31, a former World War II fighter ace, and 28-year-old
Buford were flying under secret contract to the CIA when they were
killed on May 6, 1954. A French flight engineer also died in the
crash.</TE>
<TE>   Their C-119 Flying Boxcar was about to drop an artillery gun to
beleaguered French colonial troops at Dien Bien Phu when the plane
was riddled by ground fire, staggered 75 miles south into Laos and
crashed near a river.</TE>
<TE>   A team from the Army's Central Identification Laboratory-Hawaii
recovered the five sets of remains, which include anything from a
tooth or bone fragment to nearly complete skeletal remains, officials
said. The five sets may include as many as 11 missing servicemen,
they said.</TE>
<TE>   Five flag-draped caskets were carried off a C-17 Air Force jet and
met by a joint-service honor guard before being taken to the Army
laboratory for identification. More than 100 people attended
Thursday's ceremony.</TE>
<TE>   "We do this to support those who never made it through the war,"
said Korean War veteran Bob Hamakama, 71, who comes to every
repatriation ceremony as a tribute to his fallen brothers.</TE>
<TE>   The remains were recovered from three crash sites in Laos -- in
1954, 1971 and 1972 -- and one in Vietnam in 1969.</TE>
<TE>   There are 1,902 Americans servicemen still unaccounted for in
Southeast Asia.</TE>

<HD>Air Force Working to Get Reservists Home</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Pentagon is trying to figure out how to send home thousands of
air reservists called to active duty more than a year ago in the
counter-terrorism war.</LD>
<LD>   The Defense Department is working with the Air Force to find ways
to reduce the number of mobilized Air National Guard and Air Force
Reservists who are doing security duty at installations in the states
and overseas, Pentagon spokesman Lt. Col. Dan Stoneking said
Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   "We have many dedicated, patriotic reservists who would like to
serve the nation, and yet we have many in the Air Force who have
served and would like to return to their employers and their
families," he said.</LD>
<TE>   Under a mobilization order signed by President Bush last year, the
Pentagon began calling up reserves Sept. 14, 2001, three days after
the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon.
About 130,000 from all services have served.</TE>
<TE>   Though the military can legally hold a reservist in service for
two years, it is uncommon to do so. And officials would like to give
those who have served for more than a year some relief.</TE>
<TE>   As of August, an estimated 14,000 air guard and air reservists
were entering their second year of service, Stoneking said. Though
the number has been brought down some, there were no exact figures
available concerning how many are in their second year of active
duty.</TE>
<TE>   The problem arises partly because the Air Force has so many
installations -- more than 160 -- that were put on heightened
security last year.</TE>
<TE>   The problem isn't as acute in the Army and Navy, Stoneking said.
The Navy doesn't have as many installations and the Army has more
people routinely trained in security duties.</TE>
<TE>   Currently, 50,755 reservists are on active duty, most assigned to
positions in the United States. That number peaked in late July above
85,000. If the United States goes to war in Iraq, Pentagon officials
expect to need at least 100,000 more and possibly twice that.</TE>

<HD>Many Future Retirees to Lose Health Benefit</HD>
<DH>With medical costs rising rapidly, many large employers are
ending the coverage with employment, a survey shows.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Vicki Kemper</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>WASHINGTON -- More than one-third of the nation's large employers
that offer health care to retired workers have recently stopped the
benefit for future retirees or expect to do so within the next three
years, a comprehensive survey released Thursday has found.</LD>
<LD>   The report highlights yet another unwelcome consequence of
spiraling health-care costs, which are rising at double-digit rates
even though overall inflation is well under control. It foreshadows
troubling ripple effects and even tougher policy decisions ahead as
elected officials confront growing numbers of Americans without
health insurance.</LD>
<LD>   And with fewer employers subsidizing health coverage for their
retirees, the cost pressure on the already strapped Medicare program
will only increase.</LD>
<TE>   There was a ray of good news in the survey, conducted by the Henry
J. Kaiser Family Foundation and Hewitt Associates, a human resources
consulting firm. All but 5% of the companies surveyed said they would
continue to subsidize health insurance for current retirees and their
spouses.</TE>
<TE>   Yet 85% of them said they would continue to pass on more of the
coverage costs to retirees. Over the last year alone, retiree
contributions increased an average of 20%.</TE>
<TE>   The study of 435 companies that employ more than 1,000 people and
currently offer health benefits for retired workers was conducted
online between July 2 and Sept. 9.</TE>
<TE>   Drew Altman, president of the Menlo Park-based Kaiser Family
Foundation, an independent health-care philanthropy, said: "Employer
subsidized health-care coverage for retirees is not collapsing, but
it is eroding."</TE>
<TE>   Even employers who are committed to doing right by their workers
are struggling.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a balancing act," said Randy Johnson, head of human
resources strategic initiatives for Motorola Inc. "If we're going to
be able to provide benefits to future retirees" in an environment of
rising costs and global competition, "we're going to have to manage
costs now."</TE>
<TE>   For current retirees, that is likely to mean reduced benefits and
higher insurance premiums, deductibles and co-payments. But for older
workers -- the very age group that has the hardest time buying
individual policies -- it may mean no employer-provided coverage at
all.</TE>
<TE>   Twenty-two percent of employers surveyed said they were very
likely or somewhat likely to terminate health benefits for future
retirees within the next three years. An additional 13% said they had
stopped offering health benefits to future retirees over the last two
years.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a trend we have been watching for some time," Kate
Sullivan, director of health policy for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce,
said in an interview. "It means we have to look beyond employer
groups to help people pay for health coverage."</TE>
<TE>   Given the extremely high cost of health insurance for individuals
at or near retirement age, Sullivan said, retirees deserve a tax code
"that gives them the same kind of tax benefits they had when they
were working."</TE>
<TE>   Current fiscal policy encourages employers, in the form of a tax
deduction, to provide health benefits to their employees, while also
giving insured employees a tax break. They do not have to pay income
taxes on the value of their benefits.</TE>
<TE>   Some combination of tax deductions and tax-free medical savings
accounts or IRA withdrawals should be offered to retirees as well,
Sullivan said, at least until they qualify for Medicare.</TE>
<TE>   The retiree health benefits currently offered by employers are
significant, in both coverage and cost.</TE>
<TE>   The typical package includes continuing coverage for surviving
spouses of deceased workers; an annual limit of out-of-pocket
expenses of $1,500 per retiree or $3,000 for a retiree and spouse;
and generous -- usually unlimited -- prescription drug coverage.</TE>
<TE>   The benefits give retirees who are younger than 65 sustained
coverage that is far less expensive than an individual policy. For
retirees 65 or older, the benefits provide valuable supplements --
primarily in the form of drug coverage -- to traditional Medicare.</TE>
<TE>   The benefits provided by the surveyed companies, which cover a
total of 5.4 million retirees and their family members, cost $12.5
billion in 2001, the employers reported. Estimated costs for this
year are $14.5 billion, a 16% increase.</TE>
<TE>   On average, employers paid 60% of the costs and retirees
contributed the remaining 40%.</TE>
<TE>   Motorola's Johnson, whose company subsidizes health benefits for
its 15,000 retirees, recommended several specific reforms to make
coverage more affordable for both employers and employees before
concluding, "It's our system that we need to give attention to
changing."</TE>
<TE>   As for changes to Medicare, Motorola and most other surveyed
companies support a prescription drug benefit similar to other
retiree health services covered by the government. This differs from
the position of the Bush administration and congressional
Republicans, who favor a drug benefit that would be administered by
private insurance companies.</TE>
<TE>   Thursday's report is the latest sign that baby boomers could
encounter financial difficulties in retirement. Current demographic
trends, which show the current ratio of three workers to every
retiree narrowing to 2 to 1 by 2030, already bode ill for both Social
Security and Medicare financing.</TE>
<TE>   For now, however, retiree health benefits continue to be one of
the most valuable perks for American workers.</TE>
<TE>   "Most of our people know one date for sure -- the date they're
eligible for retiree medical coverage," said Johnson.</TE>
<TE>   "They're doing everything they can to stay employed until that
date."</TE>

<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla.</DL>
<LD>For the second day, bad weather prevented space shuttle Endeavour
from returning from its space station visit.</LD>
<LD>   Thursday's delay added a 184th day in orbit for the three former
residents of the international space station, whose families
anxiously awaited their return at a cloudy Cape Canaveral.</LD>
<LD>   Today's forecast was far from perfect, but NASA was hoping it
would be good enough for Endeavour to land. If the weather still does
not cooperate, the shuttle will be guided to a Saturday touchdown on
one coast or the other, flight director Wayne Hale said.</LD>
<TE>   NASA is reluctant to divert its space shuttles to Edwards Air
Force Base in California because of the expense and time involved in
ferrying the spaceships back to their home port in Florida.</TE>
<TE>   Endeavour and its crew have enough fuel and supplies to remain in
orbit until Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   The seven astronauts and cosmonauts got a hint of what was to come
when they woke up: Mission Control piped in a recording of the
Eagles' 1976 hit "Hotel California."</TE>
<TE>   The space station's returning crew, astronaut Peggy Whitson and
cosmonauts Valery Korzun and Sergei Treschev, rocketed off the planet
June 5. They spent an extra 1 1/2 months in orbit because of a
variety of problems that delayed Endeavour's flight to retrieve them.</TE>
<TE>   Endeavour blasted off Nov. 23 with the replacement crew and
another new space station girder.</TE>
<TE>   The space station crew members face weeks of intensive physical
therapy after the return.</TE>
<TE>   They will not only have to regain muscle strength and coordination
as they readjust to life in Earth gravity, they will also become
guinea pigs for the study of how long-duration spaceflight has
affected such things as bone mass, muscle loss and nerve conduction.</TE>
<TE>   The debilitating effect of long-term spaceflight is an impediment
to deep space missions, such as one to Mars, NASA says.</TE>
<TE>   The shuttle's launch was delayed by a series of mishaps, including
tiny cracks discovered in its engine compartment.</TE>

<HD>Northeast Takes Its Turn With Deadly Storm</HD>
<DH>After leaving Carolinas without power, the ice and snow
move up the coast. Death toll is at 18.</DH>

<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>The first major snow and ice storm of the season moved up the East
Coast on Thursday, forcing schools and airports to close, sending
cars and trucks skidding on slick roads and snapping power lines.</LD>
<LD>   Fog in some places added to the hazards of driving as the National
Weather Service warned of reduced visibility and possible whiteouts
caused by heavy snowfall.</LD>
<LD>   So far the storm, which crossed the southern Plains earlier in the
week, then moved from the Texas Panhandle to Virginia on Wednesday
before continuing to the Northeast on Thursday, has killed at least
18 people -- mostly in motor vehicle accidents.</LD>
<TE>   At least 76 accidents were reported Thursday on the New Jersey
Turnpike alone, and more than 1.6 million homes and businesses from
the Carolinas to Oklahoma were without electricity.</TE>
<TE>   In Durham, N.C., faculty members and their families carrying
sleeping bags took refuge at Duke University's Law School, which has
its own generator, said Erwin Chemerinsky, a visiting constitutional
law professor from USC.</TE>
<TE>   Chemerinsky said the only food available was at a nearby Kentucky
Fried Chicken franchise, where people waited 90 minutes in line to be
served. He said his family planned to spend Thursday night in
sleeping bags at the school.</TE>
<TE>   Typical of the problems facing many commuters was Lisa Rafanelli's
tense journey to her job as an art history teacher at Manhattanville
College in Westchester County, N.Y. It is usually less than an hour's
drive from New York City.</TE>
<TE>   "It took me two hours to get there and 2 1/2 hours to get home,"
she said after parking her snow-covered car in an East Side Manhattan
garage. "There were a lot of people stranded on the side of the
road."</TE>
<TE>   The storm sharply curtailed air traffic and caused concern for
passengers aboard an early-morning Delta Air Lines shuttle bound for
Washington.</TE>
<TE>   It took off on time from New York's La Guardia Airport and reached
the nation's capital, only to find that snow had closed Reagan
National Airport. The plane returned to LaGuardia, but that field had
also been shut down. Finally, the aircraft touched down at Hartford,
Conn.</TE>
<TE>   The force of the storm, which coated windshields within minutes,
caught the New York Sanitation Department by surprise. Officials
doubled the number of snowplows on the streets to 800, but some main
thoroughfares were not cleaned until early evening.</TE>
<TE>   Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg estimated that the storm would cost the
city -- which is already facing serious financial difficulties -- $1
million for each inch of snow. The weather service said New York
would have 6 to 8 inches.</TE>
<TE>   "Clearing snow is expensive," Bloomberg said. "Having said that,
the first thing, the most important thing is to make sure people can
get around and get around safely. Every mayor would like to have very
few snow days."</TE>
<TE>   The storm's effects were felt most harshly in the Carolinas. The
weight of ice snapped tree limbs like twigs and easily toppled power
lines. Duke Power reported about 1.2 million homes and businesses
were without electricity in North and South Carolina, and told
customers it could be days before full service was restored.</TE>
<TE>   Other utilities said there were blackouts in portions of Arkansas,
Kentucky, Oklahoma, Virginia and West Virginia.</TE>
<TE>   Flights were delayed and canceled along the East Coast. In New
Jersey, arrivals and departures were at least two hours late at
Newark Liberty International Airport. Atlantic City's airport was
forced to shut for 35 minutes because of ice on its only run- way.</TE>
<TE>   In Washington, government offices were open but in some cases with
reduced staffs. Many offices allowed employees to take the day off or
leave early. And most area schools were closed by the first snowfall
to blanket the capital in almost two years.</TE>
<TE>   Parents and children built snowmen at the foot of the Lincoln
Memorial, college students played football as flakes fell near the
Washington Monument, and a few people were seen cross-country skiing
past the White House.</TE>
<TE>   As darkness approached, families made their way through heavy
security to the Ellipse, where President Bush lit the national
Christmas tree. Earlier in the day, the president's dogs romped in
the snow in the White House Rose Garden.</TE>
<TE>   In the storm's path, many businesses closed early. Stores, already
facing a shortened Christmas shopping season because of the late
Thanksgiving, shut their doors and sent employees home.</TE>
<TE>   But at Rainbow Pharmacy in Manhattan, Assaad Lattouf said he
planned to remain dispensing medicines until 9 p.m., when his day
usually ends.</TE>
<TE>   He said that he worried the buses home to Clifton, N.J., would not
be running and he would be forced to take a cab.</TE>
<TE>   "Normally, the fare runs $45," he said, "but because of the snow,
the driver might ask for double."</TE>

<HD>Thurmond Honored on His 100th</HD>
<DH>Officials, family extend birthday greetings to the nation's
oldest and longest-serving senator.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Strom Thurmond, the nation's oldest and longest-serving senator,
reached his 100th birthday Thursday surrounded by family, friends,
Supreme Court justices and leaders of the Senate he helped to
reshape.</LD>
<LD>   The Senate is a family, said former Sen. Bob Dole (R-Kan.) at a
Capitol Hill birthday celebration, "and today the family assembles to
honor its patriarch."</LD>
<LD>   Hundreds of friends and supporters, many of whom had driven
through a snowstorm from Thurmond's home state of South Carolina to
attend, cheered as his two sons and daughter blew out candles on a
red-white-and-blue cake. Daughter Julie announced she was pregnant,
which will make Thurmond, who first became a father at age 68, a
grandfather for the first time.</LD>
<TE>   Thurmond is retiring with the end of this session of Congress,
having served for 48 years.</TE>
<TE>   Frail and in a wheelchair, Thurmond appeared moved by his
daughter's announcement and the event in his honor.</TE>
<TE>   "Live a long time and enjoy the time," he told the gathering.</TE>
<TE>   Organizers said seven of the nine Supreme Court justices -- minus
Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Clarence Thomas -- attended
the event, as did incoming Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott
(R-Miss.) and several members of the Bush Cabinet.</TE>
<TE>   Referring to Thurmond's reputation as a lady's man, a Marilyn
Monroe impersonator sang "Happy Birthday to You" to the senator, much
as Monroe did at a party in 1962 for President Kennedy. Thurmond
looked up and smiled when Lott said that his 89-year-old mother had a
crush on him.</TE>
<TE>   Thurmond served as chairman of the Judiciary and Armed Services
Committee, but his career was marked more by his hard work in
fulfilling the needs of his constituents.</TE>
<TE>   "My dad was a Democrat," said Republican Rep. Lindsey O. Graham,
who next month will move into Thurmond's Senate seat. "But if there
was anything we needed there was no hesitation who we would call --
Strom Thurmond."</TE>
<TE>   In Edgefield, a town of 2,500 in the western part of South
Carolina, low temperatures forced celebrations into a gym instead of
the town square with its life-sized monument to Thurmond.</TE>
<TE>   Schoolchildren sported the number 100 painted on their cheeks or
hands and 100 red, white and blue cupcakes were baked for the
youngsters.</TE>

<HD>Bushes Offer Greetings for the Season</HD>

<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Lighting the national Christmas tree Thursday, President Bush offered
comfort to families grieving for loved ones lost in the terrorist
attacks and those separated during the holidays by military
assignments.</LD>
<LD>   "In this season we celebrate with our families, and deeply miss
family members no longer with us," said Bush, bundled against the
cold in an overcoat and Stetson. "Thousands of families in our nation
are still grieving over the terrible losses that came to them last
year on September the 11th."</LD>
<LD>   Many in the military are on duty far from home now, the president
said. "They stand between Americans and grave danger. They serve in
the cause of peace and freedom."</LD>
<TE>   The president and First Lady Laura Bush, assisted by two
Washington-area 7-year-olds, then flicked a switch and a blaze of
light illuminated the Colorado blue spruce that stands permanently on
the Ellipse just south of the White House.</TE>
<TE>   Earlier, Mrs. Bush showed off a White House dressed for the
holidays in an elegant red-and-gold decor made whimsical by
papier-mache likenesses of pets of presidents past.</TE>
<TE>   Two dogs accompanied her Thursday as she showed off the holiday
decorations.</TE>
<TE>   For the Christmas season, Barney, the Bushes' black Scottish
terrier, has a tiny video camera affixed to his collar that will
transmit pictures to the White House Web site as he pads around 1600
Pennsylvania Ave.</TE>
<TE>   "I brought my two animals out to talk to you about the Christmas
decorations this year," Mrs. Bush said as Barney and springer spaniel
Spot snuffled around the trees. "Kitty [the first cat] wouldn't come
down, she's a little too shy."</TE>
<TE>   For the 9,000 people who will visit for parties or tours, Mrs.
Bush has transformed the East Room, Blue Room and State Dining Room
into a red, gold and green wonderland with hundreds of poinsettia
plants shaped into Christmas trees, topiaries of pomegranates, pears
and magnolia leaves and garlands of large pine cones and crimson
berries.</TE>
<TE>   Towering firs drip with fragile gold globes, red glass icicles and
specially commissioned ornaments representing birds from each of the
50 states.</TE>
<TE>   Scores of tiny marzipan creatures -- including an alligator owned
by John Quincy Adams and a flock of sheep that Woodrow Wilson kept to
mow the executive mansion's lawn -- grace the grounds of an edible
White House made from 80 pounds of gingerbread, 50 pounds of
chocolate and 20 pounds of marzipan.</TE>
<TE>   Pastry chef Roland Mesnier usually takes about a month to put the
annual centerpiece together.</TE>

<HD>Earliest Writing in Mesoamerica Takes a Leap Further Back
in Time</HD>
<DH>Mexican seal is dated to 650 BC. Find suggests Olmec may
have been area's 'mother' culture.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Thomas H. Maugh II</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Archeologists digging near Mexico's Gulf Coast have discovered the
earliest-known example of writing in Mesoamerica, pushing the date
for the appearance of this cultural breakthrough back by at least 450
years, to about 650 BC.</LD>
<LD>   More important, the discovery of an inscribed seal and fragments
from a plaque suggests that writing was developed by the Olmec
civilization and not by the Zapotec -- source of the earliest
previously known Mesoamerican writing -- or the Maya, who brought it
to its greatest level of sophistication.</LD>
<LD>   The discovery, which is being published today in the journal
Science, is triggering a sharp debate among Mesoamerican researchers
about the origins of civilization in the region. The most commonly
accepted idea now is that writing, kingship, the development of a
calendar and other marks of civilization arose independently among
various cultures in the area, a concept variously known as "equal
partners" or "sister" cultures.</LD>
<TE>   The new find provides support for the controversial idea of a
"mother" culture -- that the Olmec developed most of the concepts and
passed them on to succeeding civilizations in much the same way that
the Greeks formed the foundations of European culture.</TE>
<TE>   "The Olmec were the first to have large urban centers," according
to archeologist Mary E.D. Pohl of Florida State University, who led
the team making the new discovery. "There is tangible evidence of the
emergence of kings [in their culture], people who had much more
centralized control.... Since the Olmec were the first to put
together a political state, and writing is closely connected with
rulers in terms of publicizing their power, it makes sense that they
would be the first to use a system of writing."</TE>
<TE>   Experts praised the new find because of the precise dating of the
objects, but many seemed less inclined to accept Pohl's
interpretation of their significance.</TE>
<TE>   Archeologist Michael Love of Cal State Northridge noted that
researchers have discovered many other artifacts containing writing
that, stylistically, seem to be as old as or older than the new
finds. Many of these were found on the Pacific coast of Mexico and
Guatemala. But because most were obtained from looters or were
inscribed on the walls of caves, "they can't be dated as accurately,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   "I would agree that the Olmec and related people developed
writing," he added, "but I would disagree that it was developed [on
the Gulf Coast], as Pohl and her colleagues claim in the paper."</TE>
<TE>   Love and others also argue that it is not clear that the symbols
found on the objects are definitely writing. "All we have are a few
symbols," said linguist Martha Macri of UC Davis, "but it is not
obvious what they represent. This suggests that the significance has
yet to be learned."</TE>
<TE>   However, the fact that they are abstract symbols rather than
drawings of animal faces or hands makes them clearly more interesting
than they otherwise would be, she added.</TE>
<TE>   The symbols fit "a loose definition of writing," said Yale
archeologist Michael D. Coe, but a stricter definition would require
that they be linked to specific words in a spoken language. That is
not yet possible because almost nothing is known about the Olmec
language.</TE>
<TE>   The Olmec people -- who called themselves Xi (pronounced shee ) --
were the largest group in Mesoamerica from about 1200 BC to about 600
BC, but they had largely disappeared by 400 BC, when the Maya emerged
into prominence. The Olmec civilization was centered on the Gulf
Coast in what is now the Mexican state of Tabasco.</TE>
<TE>   The largest city was La Venta, which sits on a salt dome that
rises from the coastal plain. The Olmec built a large pyramid atop
the dome that can be seen for long distances. "It's a very imposing
site," Pohl said.</TE>
<TE>   Pohl and her colleagues, Kevin O. Pope of Geo Eco Arc Research in
Aquasco, Md., and Christopher L. von Nagy of Tulane University, were
working at the residential suburb of San Andres about three miles
northeast of La Venta. The site was originally located on the banks
of a river, which has since disappeared. The area is very swampy and
presents difficult working conditions, which is one reason the Olmec
have not been heavily studied, Pohl said.</TE>
<TE>   The new items were found in what appears to be the refuse dump
from a large celebration of some sort, Pohl said. The pit contained
human and animal bones, oversize serving dishes and beverage
containers, hollow figurines and pottery shards.</TE>
<TE>   The prize object was a small seal, a 3-inch-high cylindrical
object with images inscribed on its surface in bas-relief. When
inked, the seal could be used to transfer the images to cloth or even
to the skin of its owners.</TE>
<TE>   The seal depicts two speech scrolls emanating from the beak of a
bird, indicating that the signs they point to are meant to be spoken,
like a cartoon speech balloon. Pohl, Pope and von Nagy interpret the
symbols to say "King 3 Ajaw" (pronounced "ah-how"). The words "3
Ajaw" represent the name of a day in the 260-day Mesoamerican
calendar. People in that region often used the name of the day they
were born as their own personal name.</TE>
<TE>   Pohl said the sign provides evidence for the early appearance of
the sacred calendar and points to "its association with the
institution of rulership."</TE>
<TE>   The same symbols are found on a greenstone statuette, called the
Young Lord, that is thought to have come from La Blanca, on the
Pacific coast of Guatemala. That figurine has not been accurately
dated, however.</TE>
<TE>   The team also found fragments of a greenstone plaque with what
appear to be symbols on them, but the researchers have not
interpreted their meaning. They believe the items may have been parts
of jewelry of the elite.</TE>
<TE>   What makes the find important, Macri said, is that the team was
able to perform radiocarbon dating on layers above and below the
objects, allowing the researchers to date the objects accurately. "We
have Mesoamerican monuments with secure dates on them from AD 156 and
some other dated monuments from 200 BC, but nothing that even comes
close to this [650 BC]," she said.</TE>
<TE>   This find "basically says that the Olmec invented writing along
with everything else," said archeologist John Clark of Brigham Young
University. "I expect it to cause some heartburn here and there"
among researchers who support the sister cultures idea.</TE>

<LD>To commemorate Moorpark's 20th birthday, the City Council this week
approved spending $11,000 more for its 2003 Independence Day
fireworks show and celebration.</LD>
<LD>   The event's $38,000 budget will pay for additional fireworks at
Arroyo Vista Park, a skydiving team and a performance by Starship,
the current incarnation of 1960s rock group Jefferson Airplane. As
usual, Moorpark will celebrate Independence Day the evening of July
3.</LD>
<LD>   "It seems to work for us -- we avoid the competition, and it frees
people up to celebrate the Fourth," said John Hartnett, the city's
recreation supervisor.</LD>
<TE>   At its meeting Wednesday, the council said goodbye to retiring
Councilman John Wozniak and welcomed Janice Parvin.</TE>

<HD>Water Board Backs Off Runoff Curbs</HD>
<DH>Central Valley panel moves toward delaying tough state
pollution controls for two years for the 25,000 farmers in the
region.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Eric Bailey</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Water regulators backed away Thursday from tough restrictions that
would require Central Valley farmers to cut tainted runoff considered
a key pollutant in the region's streams and rivers.</LD>
<LD>   For the last 20 years, farmers in the state's agricultural
heartland -- 7 million acres of fields and orchards that provide 25%
of America's food and fiber -- have been allowed to skirt clean-water
rules that apply to industries such as factories and refineries.</LD>
<LD>   State lawmakers ordered that exemption slashed by Jan. 1, but the
Central Valley Regional Water Quality Control Board voted after a
five-hour meeting here to move toward rules that allow the valley's
25,000 farmers to avoid strict pollution controls for another two
years.</LD>
<TE>   The board also agreed to revisit the matter in March as part of a
10-year plan to clean up the Central Valley's water.</TE>
<TE>   Under the new plan, growers must take steps to voluntarily begin
monitoring and reducing the mix of pollutants -- pesticides,
fertilizers and concentrations of toxins leached from the soil --
that flow off their fields and end up in the Sacramento-San Joaquin
Delta, a drinking-water source for much of the state.</TE>
<TE>   Environmentalists said the new voluntary approach falls far short
of the mandatory limits needed to force farmers to clean up runoff
into Central Valley rivers. Of the 25 million acre-feet of irrigation
water used by Central Valley farmers, 20% flows back into waterways.</TE>
<TE>   "This is really leaving the fox to guard the henhouse," said Bill
Jennings, head of DeltaKeeper, an environmental group that shepherds
the broad nexus at the eastern edge of San Francisco Bay. "This isn't
going to make them do much more than they do now. It doesn't come a
quarter of the way."</TE>
<TE>   Jennings said environmentalists will appeal the regional decision
to the state water board and almost certainly will sue over the new
rules. He said it is unfair to treat agriculture differently from
other businesses in the state. "What we're asking," he said, "is that
agriculture be subject to the same regulations that thousands and
thousands of businesses, including mom and pop operations, have to
comply with."</TE>
<TE>   Farmers long have said that tougher rules would pose a government
intrusion into their businesses that could prove costly.</TE>
<TE>   The California Farm Bureau Federation supports the conditional
waivers, but officials with the group suggested that some new rules
could be onerous for small farmers.</TE>
<TE>   Tess Dunham, California Farm Bureau director of water resources,
described the new waiver system as "a whole new ballgame .... The
devil's going to be in the details." But the new rules undoubtedly
will be better than mandatory limits for runoff, she said.</TE>
<TE>   More than 500 miles of rivers and streams and nearly 500,000 acres
of waterways in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta are considered
impaired because of pollution.</TE>
<TE>   Tainted water can suffocate aquatic life and kill tiny insects
that are the first link in the river food chain.</TE>
<TE>   The pollution also balloons the cost of water treatment for
Sacramento, Contra Costa County and other regions that depend on the
rivers or delta for their drinking water.</TE>
<TE>   State water regulators announced plans last March to adopt rules
requiring growers to begin monitoring drainage and institute better
erosion and pesticide controls.</TE>
<TE>   But the State Water Resources Control Board later backed away from
statewide requirements for agriculture, leaving it to California's
nine regional water boards. Environmentalists contend that the state
board yielded to pressure from the state's powerful farm lobby.</TE>
<TE>   Under the plans now envisioned, farmers in a particular watershed
would join together in voluntary efforts to monitor and slash
pollutants. But they would face no mandatory goals.</TE>
<TE>   Some farmers are already taking steps to clean up their runoff,
impounding irrigation water on their land and reducing pesticide use.</TE>
<TE>   One option left to the board would be to revoke the waivers if
farmers did not make a satisfactory cleanup effort. But
environmentalists remain unconvinced that the board would take such a
step given the political power of farmers in California.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, conservationists worry that the state's growing
budget deficit will end up killing many of the monitoring programs
that might call attention to ongoing problems.</TE>
<TE>   They contend that the water board should adopt a program that
requires farmers to pay fees to ensure that monitoring and
enforcement can take place. Other industries are required to
participate in such fee-based programs.</TE>

<LD>A 26-year-old Pacoima man was charged Thursday with assault with a
deadly weapon, evading police and drunk driving in connection with a
police chase and car crash that resulted in a 3-week-old boy losing
his left arm.</LD>
<LD>   The infant, Harley Medellin of Arleta, remained in serious
condition at Childrens Hospital Los Angeles after surgery Wednesday
on the remaining portion of his arm, Dr. James Stein said at a
hospital news conference.</LD>
<LD>   Harley's arm was shredded above the elbow when his parents' sport
utility vehicle was sideswiped during a high-speed pursuit Tuesday
afternoon in Sylmar. Los Angeles police were chasing a car that
matched the description of a vehicle driven by men sought in a
stabbing.</LD>
<TE>   Police arrested Alejandro Martinez on Tuesday at the scene of
crash. He pleaded not guilty Thursday to the five felony counts in
Superior Court in San Fernando and is being held on $180,000 bail. He
faces 11 years in state prison.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles attorney Stephen C. Mancini, who was retained by
Harley's parents, said he is exploring whether to file a civil
lawsuit against the Los Angeles police or others.</TE>
<TE>   Mancini said Harley's parents, newlyweds Victoria and Henry
Medellin, have been at their newborn's bedside since they were
treated for minor crash-related injuries.</TE>

<HD>Ex-Coach Seeks to Alter Plea in Sex Case</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Holly J. Wolcott</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A former volunteer wrestling coach at Moorpark High School, who
pleaded guilty to having sex with a 14-year-old student before
marrying her, said Thursday that he wants to withdraw his plea
because prosecutors withheld key information from him.</LD>
<LD>   Before 23-year-old Andrew Fonseca of Moorpark entered pleas to
three felonies in July, the girl told prosecutors in writing that she
would not testify, according to defense lawyer Jay Johnson.</LD>
<LD>   But the girl's declaration was never handed over to Fonseca's
former attorney -- but should have been, Johnson said.</LD>
<TE>   "My client was denied effective assistance of counsel and due
process because this information was not passed on," Johnson said.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson said Deputy Dist. Atty. Tamara Bogosian erred and acted in
bad faith when she accepted Fonseca's guilty plea without turning
over the letter.</TE>
<TE>   Bogosian could not be reached for comment. But her supervisor,
Senior Deputy Dist. Attorney Lisa Lyytikainen, said prosecutors were
not legally required to reveal the letter because state law allows
sexual assault victims to abstain from testifying.</TE>
<TE>   "She's not required to cooperate," Lyytikainen said. "And these
types of cases ... can be prosecuted without that cooperation."</TE>
<TE>   Lyytikainen also said it seemed odd that the defense was unaware
of the girl's stance, since she has been in a relationship with the
defendant most of this year and was in court with him when he pleaded
guilty five months ago.</TE>
<TE>   The girl, now 15, wed Fonseca recently in Las Vegas, attorneys
said. Fonseca, who is free on $50,000 bail, appeared in court with
the girl by his side Thursday. Fonseca was scheduled to be sentenced
Thursday, but Superior Court Judge Kevin J. McGee said he must first
consider the defendant's request to withdraw his guilty pleas. A
ruling is expected Dec. 13. Fonseca could be sentenced to fours years
in prison. But probation officials recommend that he receive credit
for several months served in Ventura County Jail and be placed on
probation.</TE>
<TE>   If the judge vacates the pleas, Fonseca plans to go to trial,
Johnson said. He has previously admitted having unlawful intercourse
with a minor, penetration with a foreign object and oral copulation.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson said his client would consider a plea bargain that keeps
him from having to register as a sex offender.</TE>

<LD>The police force that patrols Los Angeles' 15 housing developments
could be eliminated beginning next month unless the City Council
bails it out with a federal grant, a housing official said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   City officials said they were dismayed by the possibility of such
a loss, particularly when the number of gang homicides is climbing in
much of the city.</LD>
<LD>   "The worst thing in the world right now would be to disband the
Housing Authority Police," said Councilwoman Janice Hahn, whose
southeast Los Angeles district encompasses six housing developments.
Three of those, Jordan Downs, Nickerson Gardens and Imperial Courts,
have some of the worst gang violence.</LD>
<TE>   "I have asked people in the Police Department, point-blank, if the
Housing Authority Police were not there, could you pick up the
slack," Hahn said. "And they've looked me straight in the eye and
said, 'No way.' "</TE>
<TE>   The councilwoman said now "is the wrong time to do this, to be
dismantling a law enforcement agency. Gang members will look at this
and think there's new territory they can go into and control."</TE>
<TE>   The housing police are armed, sworn officers who are employees of
the housing agency. There are 35 housing officers; last year there
were 63.</TE>
<TE>   At issue is whether the City Council next spring will award the
Housing Authority a Community Development Block Grant. Those grants
are provided by the federal government to cities and urban counties
to revitalize neighborhoods and expand housing and economic
opportunities. However, the demand by competing agencies throughout
the city far exceeds the money available.</TE>
<TE>   The Housing Authority's executive director, Donald J. Smith, said
the agency faces a deficit of nearly $6 million for the coming
calendar year and is asking the city to award it a $4.7-million block
grant to keep the police force afloat.</TE>
<TE>   But Smith said the force already is so small that eliminating it
"probably won't have any kind of material effect on law enforcement."
For several years, he said, "the LAPD has done 95% of the patrolling
in the public housing."</TE>
<TE>   However, Councilman Dennis Zine, a former officer, said the city's
Police Department is stretched too thin to lose even the few officers
who help protect the housing developments.</TE>
<TE>   "The LAPD is given a tremendous responsibility to solve all the
problems in the city of Los Angeles.... You can only stretch a rubber
band so far," Zine said</TE>
<TE>   Representatives for Mayor James K. Hahn said he also opposes
eliminating the housing police force and will urge the agency to find
other funding.</TE>
<TE>   "We are not going to let security in these areas diminish," said
Deputy Mayor Matt Middlebrook. "We're going to be looking for
creative solutions to this issue." Middlebrook said the agency should
not pin all its hopes on a block grant.</TE>
<TE>   But Smith said one of the problems is that the Housing Authority
was ordered to make massive repairs in some of the developments,
which caused money to be redirected away from law enforcement.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not optimistic [about getting the block grant] because
there's such a demand on that block grant money," he said. Smith said
he would need a commitment from the city this month that the money
will be awarded. Without it, he said, he probably will recommend to
the agency's board Dec. 27 that the police force be phased out.</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, Smith said, he would try to persuade city
officials to award the funding: "We'll hope right up until the end,
and try to get as much, with as much gusto, as we can."</TE>

<HD>Pressures May Lift O.C. Flight Limits</HD>
<DH>Industry and federal roles, plus death of El Toro airfield
plan, are factors in the latest proposed increase for John Wayne
Airport.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Dan Weikel</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Facing industry pressure on John Wayne Airport in the wake of a
failed El Toro airport plan, Newport Beach and Orange County
supervisors are nearing agreement on lifting the cap at John Wayne to
10.8 million passengers a year eventually -- far more than people
living in the flight path had ever anticipated.</LD>
<LD>   That ceiling -- which would allow 1 million more passengers
annually than proposed by the county earlier this year -- comes at a
time of mounting opposition from the airline industry to local
controls that conflict with a 1990 federal law banning city and
county governments from limiting airport activity.</LD>
<LD>   Aircraft noise restrictions and passenger volumes at John Wayne
are now controlled by the county under a landmark 1985 court
settlement that is set to expire in 2005. The original agreement,
which ended a lawsuit by Newport Beach and others, had capped
passenger volumes at 8.4 million a year. The airport now handles
about 7.8 million air travelers a year.</LD>
<TE>   The proposal, which would revise and extend the 1985 settlement,
would increase airport capacity to 10.3 million a year in 2003, and
to a maximum of 10.8 million by the end of 2011. The number of
noisiest flights would be raised from 73 to 85 a day, and the number
of gates would increase from 14 to 20. The entire agreement would
expire in 2015.</TE>
<TE>   The Newport Beach City Council and the county Board of Supervisors
are scheduled to consider the proposal next week.</TE>
<TE>   "This is far more than Newport Beach ever wanted at John Wayne,"
conceded Mayor Tod W. Ridgeway. "But the quid pro quo for us is that
the airlines will not file a lawsuit against us and the Federal
Aviation Administration will take no further action."</TE>
<TE>   Neither the FAA nor the airline industry has taken an official
position on the proposed agreement.</TE>
<TE>   The latest plan builds on one reached by Newport Beach and the
Board of Supervisors in June that would allow the airport, starting
Jan. 1, to expand operations beyond the limits in the 1985
settlement.</TE>
<TE>   Under the changes proposed in June, airport capacity would rise to
a maximum of 9.8 million passengers year, 1.4 million above the 1985
cap. Adding four future gates also was approved, bringing the total
to 18.</TE>
<TE>   In an attempt to avoid litigation and maintain some local control,
the city and county will ask the FAA to review the newer plan once it
is approved to make sure it conforms to the federal Airport Noise and
Capacity Act of 1990.</TE>
<TE>   The FAA, which enforces the measure, has the power to sue over the
proposed restrictions. If the agency signs off on the changes, local
officials believe, airlines would be unlikely to raise a legal
challenge as well.</TE>
<TE>   Paul Turk, an FAA spokesman, said Thursday that the agency will
review the proposal and comments from government officials and the
airlines based at John Wayne Airport. The FAA could issue an opinion
by the end of the year.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone wants to make sure this is locked down and that we are
in compliance with federal law," said Alan Murphy, director of John
Wayne Airport. "The FAA interpretation is critical."</TE>
<TE>   The proposal, Murphy said, provides noise protections for
communities near the airport while allowing more capacity after the
public rejected a plan to turn the closed El Toro Marine Corps Air
Station into a major commercial airport. An airport serving up to 30
million passengers a year at El Toro had been heavily favored by
Newport Beach officials in hopes of lessening demand at John Wayne,
which is just north of that city.</TE>
<TE>   Murphy said those supporting the plan include the 10 commercial
airlines now based at John Wayne, citizens groups, the Newport Beach
City Council and members of the Board of Supervisors.</TE>
<TE>   If approved by Newport Beach, the county and the FAA, an amended
settlement agreement will be submitted in federal court. Newport
Beach City Atty. Robert Burnham said it probably would go before U.S.
District Judge Terry Hatter, who has signed off on smaller changes to
the 1985 settlement.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to make sure we get the benefit of our bargain and head
off possible lawsuits over the restrictions," Burnham said.</TE>

<HD>7 More Women Accuse Date-Rape Suspect of Drugging Them</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tracy Wilson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Seven more women have joined three alleged rape victims in accusing
millionaire date-rape suspect Andrew Luster of drugging them at bars
and parties, and, in one case, at a Las Vegas strip club.</LD>
<LD>   Ventura County prosecutors want to call the additional women as
witnesses when testimony in Luster's trial begins next week to show
the 38-year-old bachelor's "penchant for preying upon incapacitated
women."</LD>
<LD>   But defense attorneys contend the women's statements are
unreliable and should be excluded.</LD>
<TE>   "It is a smear campaign," Santa Monica defense attorney Roger Jon
Diamond argued Thursday in Superior Court. "These women do not claim
to have had sex with Mr. Luster, or claim to have been raped by him."</TE>
<TE>   The proposed testimony is speculative, overly broad and would
lengthen the trial for months, if not years, Diamond argued.</TE>
<TE>   However, prosecutors urged Judge Ken Riley to allow the women to
testify, arguing that their accounts corroborate statements by the
three alleged rape victims.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors contend the testimony is highly relevant because it
shows a pattern of conduct and establishes Luster's alleged motive.
"The people intend to prove this defendant is a serial rapist, and he
has a common design to incapacitate women," Deputy Dist. Atty.
Anthony Wold argued.</TE>
<TE>   The judge is expected to rule on the prosecution's request Monday.</TE>
<TE>   According to court papers Wold filed in November, one woman told
authorities she met Luster in 1998 at a downtown Santa Barbara bar,
went back to his Mussel Shoals beach house, blacked out and awoke the
next morning with no memory of what had occurred.</TE>
<TE>   A UC Santa Barbara student reported a nearly identical story, Wold
wrote.</TE>
<TE>   Investigators also said they talked to a Las Vegas exotic dancer,
who reported feeling dizzy and blacking out after Luster allegedly
bought her a gin and tonic at a Nevada strip club in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   "Simply put, the number of women who spend time with this
defendant and wake up with the question 'What happened?' is nothing
less than astonishing," Wold wrote.</TE>
<TE>   "Many women aside from the ... victims have also had similar
experiences of increased incapacitation, memory loss, blackouts and
sexual conduct under highly questionable circumstances," the
prosecutor stated in the court papers.</TE>
<TE>   Luster, the great-grandson of cosmetics magnate Max Factor, is
charged with raping three women after rendering them unconscious with
the date-rape drug gamma hydroxybutyrate, or GHB.</TE>
<TE>   Luster was arrested in July 2000 after one of the women, a UC
Santa Barbara student, reported being drugged at a Santa Barbara bar
and raped at Luster's beach house.</TE>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An off-duty Los Angeles Police Department officer suffered severe
burns Thursday when his motorcycle burst into flames after a
collision with a van in Van Nuys.</LD>
<LD>   Officer Creighton Dawson, 28, was taken to Northridge Hospital
Medical Center and later transferred to the Grossman Burn Center at
Sherman Oaks Hospital, said LAPD spokesman Jack Richter.</LD>
<LD>   Dawson, an LAPD officer for three years assigned to the Valley
Traffic Division, was listed in serious condition and treated for
second- and third-degree burns on 30% of his body.</LD>
<TE>   A Van Nuys resident, Dawson was on his motorcycle traveling south
on Balboa Boulevard about 10:30 a.m. when the van's driver made a
left turn in front of him at the entrance of Balboa Park, Richter
said.</TE>
<TE>   LAPD Lt. Steve Allen said the impact of the collision ruptured the
motorcycle's fuel line, causing gasoline to ignite, severely burning
Dawson.</TE>
<TE>   Allen said witnesses stopped their cars and threw blankets over
Dawson to extinguish the flames.</TE>
<TE>   He sustained burns to his face, neck and extremities, according to
a burn center spokesman.</TE>
<TE>   Dawson is scheduled to undergo surgery to treat his wounds today.</TE>
<TE>   Police did not identify the driver of the van and said the
accident still is being investigated.</TE>

This School</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>I don't know why Easterners poke fun at Southern California when this
area clearly has such a vibrant culture -- well, a vibrant car
culture anyway.</LD>
<LD>   Judy Lynes of Woodland Hills came upon a Pierce College brochure
listing reasons to attend the school. No. 4 was: "Huge parking lots."</LD>
<LD>   Lost in time: Daniel J.B. Mitchell of Santa Monica says that when
he dined in a Westside restaurant the other day, "this note appeared
on each table" (see accompanying).</LD>
<TE>   Observed Mitchell: "An interesting question is whether they are
celebrating 11 months too early or one month too late."</TE>
<TE>   Unclear on the concept? Donna Athens of Ventura passed along a
shot that her daughter Karin took of a driveway that evidently
couldn't keep a secret (see photo).</TE>
<TE>   Such a deal: Referring to one holiday ad, Helen Playfair of Santa
Clarita said:</TE>
<TE>   "Just what I want for Christmas -- pre-lit hair."</TE>
<TE>   Today's shocker: "Seems like wine-tasting clubs are attracting
younger segments of the population," concluded R.D. Sisemore of Los
Alamitos after seeing one headline (see accompanying).</TE>
<TE>   Attacking L.A.: One plot of the TV show "24" involved an effort to
stop a terrorist's nuclear bomb from exploding in L.A. So what else
is new? When it comes to disaster epics, scriptwriters are serial
stalkers of L.A. Look at what they've put the City of Angels through:</TE>
<TE>   * "War of the Worlds" (1953): Martians wipe out City Hall and much
of the city before the air kills them.</TE>
<TE>   * "Earthquake" (1974): The Big One brings down Capitol Records et
al.</TE>
<TE>   * "Miracle Mile" (1989): Only the tar pits survive a nuclear
attack.</TE>
<TE>   * "The Big One: The Great Los Angeles Earthquake" (1990): A TV
movie becomes a real disaster (I'm referring to the script).</TE>
<TE>   * "Independence Day" (1996): Space aliens level L.A. again, but
not before one TV anchor tells the populace: "The LAPD is asking Los
Angelenos not to fire their guns at the spacecraft."</TE>
<TE>   * "Escape from L.A." (1996): A 21st century quake (Hey, that's
this century!) allows L.A. to secede from the San Fernando Valley,
which goes under water.</TE>
<TE>   * "Volcano" (1997): Lava sweeps across L.A., prompting one
character to utter the memorable line: "Better take the freeway;
Wilshire looks pretty bad."</TE>
<TE>   MiscelLAny: The police log of Laguna Beach's Coastline Pilot
reported a complaint about a man who had fallen asleep at the beach
-- on a chess board. Guess you could classify that as a sort of
knightmare situation.</TE>

<HD>On Maui, a Prelude to Budget-Slashing</HD>
<DH>Legislators are in Hawaii with leaders of prison guards
union, a frequent donor to lawmakers.</DH>

<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>As they gird to slash billions of dollars from California's budget,
at least a dozen members of the Legislature ensconced themselves this
week at the Maui Sheraton hotel with leaders of the correctional
officers union.</LD>
<LD>   The Hawaii meeting comes three days before the Monday opening of a
special session to close a budget gap projected at between $21
billion and $30 billion -- more than one-quarter of the state's
general fund.</LD>
<LD>   Leaders of the California Correctional Peace Officers Assn. say
that by sponsoring a "California conference" in which lawmakers talk
politics in the morning and enjoy Hawaii in the afternoon, they hope
to build rapport among lawmakers who will soon square off.</LD>
<TE>   "I think it's their way of getting away from the Capitol and
dialoguing among themselves," said Don Novey, a retired executive
director of the correctional officers group who now works as a
consultant for the powerful union, one of the biggest donors to
Sacramento politicians. "I think they enjoy the give and take in this
convivial setting."</TE>
<TE>   The correctional officers union may pick up the tab for a dinner
for the California lawmakers this week but nothing more, Novey said.</TE>
<TE>   He and lawmakers say legislators pay the airplane and hotel bills
for the Maui trip, either from personal or campaign funds. Money
raised for election campaigns can be spent on travel and conferences
that involve a legislative, political or governmental purpose.</TE>
<TE>   But what's legal doesn't necessarily make good government, said
Paul Ryan, a campaign finance reform expert with the nonprofit,
nonpartisan Center for Governmental Studies in Los Angeles. He called
the two-day gathering a "perfect textbook example" of well-financed
special interests winning greater access to politicians than ordinary
Californians.</TE>
<TE>   The 26,000-member prison guard union has donated more than $1
million to Gov. Gray Davis since his election in 1998. The Davis
administration gave the guards a pay hike of as much as 37% earlier
this year. The union also donates heavily to lawmakers, who gave
Novey a framed resolution and warm retirement farewell last summer.</TE>
<TE>   Novey said the lawmakers who arrived Wednesday and Thursday
included Assembly Speaker Herb Wesson (D-Culver City), Republican
leader Dave Cox of Fair Oaks, Senate Republican leader Jim Brulte of
Rancho Cucamonga, Sen. Liz Figueroa (D-Fremont), Assemblyman Russ
Bogh (R-Cherry Valley), Assemblyman Tony Strickland (R-Thousand Oaks)
and Sen. Roy Ashburn (R-Bakersfield).</TE>
<TE>   "It's kind of neat to see Dave [Cox] and Herb [Wesson] sitting up
there in their Hawaiian shirts and discussing why they did what they
did," Novey said Thursday morning of a panel discussion on last
month's elections.</TE>
<TE>   Cox spokesman Peter DeMarco defended the Maui visit, saying it did
not interfere with any Capitol business. "There's not been a
cavalcade in here this week to talk about budget matters," said
DeMarco, who stayed behind in Sacramento.</TE>

<HD>Three Possible Causes of Ramp Flaws Investigated</HD>
<DH>Thin concrete, poorly spaced rebar and over-tightened
cables are suspected in damage to new bridge between 405, 55 freeways
in O.C.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Dan Weikel</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Engineers are investigating whether thin concrete, irregularly spaced
steel bars and over-tightened reinforcing cables caused extensive
damage to a new $12-million carpool bridge connecting the San Diego
and Costa Mesa freeways, newly obtained Caltrans records show.</LD>
<LD>   According to the documents obtained by The Times under the
California Public Records Act, some engineers studying the flawed
span suspect that builders put too much tension on supporting cables,
causing concrete girders to crack and spall, a condition in which
concrete breaks off in layers.</LD>
<LD>   The damage has been found in two of three sections of the
half-mile-long span, delaying the April 2003 opening perhaps eight to
10 months.</LD>
<TE>   To keep such large bridges and elevated roads from sagging, long
steel tendons are installed inside them. These cables, which run
through metal pipes in concrete girders, are pulled tight by
hydraulic jacks to tension levels set by designers.</TE>
<TE>   Even if the proper amount of tension was used on the cables, the
Caltrans records suggest, the damage might have occurred anyway
because of thin concrete and uneven spacing of steel reinforcement
bars. In some of the damaged spots, the amount of concrete that
covered the rebar was found to be only two-thirds of what the design
required.</TE>
<TE>   "It appears that there are locations where the concrete cover of
the [rebar] is less than planned," a Caltrans engineer wrote in an
Oct. 28 report. As built, he said, the sections where damage was
found might have been "inadequate to resist" the proper amount of
tension, let alone any excessive force.</TE>
<TE>   Based on field data, the engineer wrote that the tension applied
to cables in the two girders appears to exceed the maximum force
needed.</TE>
<TE>   The Caltrans reports, fact sheets and technical analysis provide a
glimpse into the effort to assess the damage, pinpoint the cause and
repair the 60-foot-high ramp. At stake, too, is determining who is at
fault and who will pay for repairs that could cost more than $8
million if -- in a worst-case scenario -- sections of the elevated
roadway must be torn down and rebuilt.</TE>
<TE>   The towering span is part of a $125-million effort to improve the
junction of the San Diego and Costa Mesa freeways, one of the
nation's 10 busiest interchanges. Though Caltrans oversees the
project, it was designed by CH2M Hill, built by C.C. Myers Inc. and
paid for by the Orange County Transportation Authority. About 20% of
state highway projects are contracted to private firms.</TE>
<TE>   Jon Rohrer, an area construction manager for Caltrans whose duties
include working on bridges, said the thin concrete, the spacing of
rebar and the possibility that too much force was applied to the
bridge's cables are all being investigated as possible causes of the
structural failures.</TE>
<TE>   "We have not ruled out anything yet," Rohrer said.</TE>
<TE>   Work was stopped Aug. 20, when construction crews found that
concrete had cracked and fallen off girders that support two of the
road's three sections. The girders are contained in large bays that
run the length of the curving bridge.</TE>
<TE>   For the last two months, teams of engineers and consultants have
been assessing the damage and developing a repair plan. No
conclusions have been reached yet.</TE>
<TE>   "This is very complicated; a lot of issues are in play," said Rick
Grebner, an OCTA project manager. "It's too early to definitively say
what caused this. Our focus has been on fixing the road and getting
it into service."</TE>
<TE>   Caltrans contends that the designer and the builder are
responsible for the damage and must make repairs. The transportation
department has given both firms until the end of the month to find a
solution.</TE>
<TE>   The builder and design firm have agreed to do the repair work but
under protest. Both have given notice that they intend to file claims
against Caltrans. At issue is whether the agency's design guidelines
for the bridge were adequate.</TE>
<TE>   Representatives for C.C. Myers of Rancho Cordova declined to
comment and referred all inquiries to Caltrans.</TE>
<TE>   Tom Peters, a spokesman for CH2M Hill, defended the international
engineering firm's track record, saying it has planned many
successful bridge projects in California. "We designed the bridge to
every professional standard," Peters said. "We are still exploring
all the options for repair. I'm confident we are making good
progress. Something should be forthcoming in the next few weeks."</TE>
<TE>   If two of the three spans must be rebuilt, C.C. Myers has
estimated, it would cost $8.3 million and take about 10 months.</TE>
<TE>   Caltrans records show, however, that other options are under
discussion. They include replacing the damaged girders.</TE>

<HD>Tourists Ask Darnedest Things</HD>
<DH>Hollywood visitors center gets questions such as the locale
of an RV park for nudists.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bob Pool</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Are tourists who are looking for the Hollywood lowdown in for a
letdown when they hit Los Angeles?</LD>
<LD>   There were no easy answers to that question Thursday as city and
business leaders opened a new $150,000 visitors information center
near Hollywood's Grauman's Chinese Theatre.</LD>
<LD>   The center has actually been quietly operated in donated space at
the Hollywood and Highland shopping center for several months. It
replaced a smaller, more out-of-the-way tourist office that served
Hollywood for about 20 years.</LD>
<TE>   The new high-tech site is so far attracting four times more people
a day than the old place. But judging by questions logged through
Thursday by the center's 11-member staff, some may be looking for
more than the traditional Hollywood experience.</TE>
<TE>   "Where can I buy hormone-free hamburgers?" asked one visitor.
"Where can I find a clothing-optional RV park?" wondered another. "If
I go to Rodeo Drive today, will I see George Clooney?" demanded a
third.</TE>
<TE>   Worker Mike Sametz was asked to give directions to "where they
filmed that one movie, with that long-haired girl who shopped." Asked
another tourist: "Did you actually like the 'Lion King'?"</TE>
<TE>   "Why is it cold? It shouldn't be cold. This is California," a
woman told Sametz. "Is prostitution legal in Los Angeles?" a man
inquired.</TE>
<TE>   "Why don't you have information regarding Las Vegas?" a visitor
asked Teresa Gilliard.</TE>
<TE>   Another asked employee Ash Grijalva: "Do you know where there are
any good strip clubs?"</TE>
<TE>   Worker Summer Davis used one of the center's computers in an
unsuccessful attempt to answer the question, "Where can I buy palm
trees?" Queried another visitor: "Are there any auto clubs around
here? You know, places where people who like cars get together and
hang out?"</TE>
<TE>   "Another man asked me, 'Who lives on Mulholland Drive?' I told him
lots of people do and he would enjoy driving its entire length,"
Davis laughed Thursday. "Another one asked for the name of a good
French restaurant in San Francisco. I recommended Chez Panisse. I've
heard of that one because I'm into cooking."</TE>
<TE>   Visitors center manager Nicolas Niboucha said the most bizarre
inquiry so far has come from a man who identified himself as a Saudi.
"Where can I go to buy the Hollywood sign?" he asked.</TE>
<TE>   "He wanted us to make phone calls to the mayor of Hollywood. He
said he had a big income and could afford to buy it," Niboucha said.</TE>
<TE>   Information center workers will make phone inquiries and print
maps and travel routes from the computer for visitors. They have a
special two-handset telephone that they use to call translators for
visitors who do not speak English. That service handles Hmong, Thai,
Mandarin, Laotian, Arabic and 15 other languages.</TE>
<TE>   About 400 tourist brochures and transportation-service schedules
are stocked at the center, which operates from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m.
Mondays through Saturdays and until 7 p.m. Sundays.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the first step in having information centers all over Los
Angeles County," said George Kirkland, president of L.A. Inc., the
Convention and Visitors Bureau.</TE>
<TE>   Question is, can they possibly attract visitors as colorful -- and
as curious -- as those in Hollywood?</TE>

<HD>Davis Choice Defies Senate</HD>
<DH>Governor names former Veterans Affairs chief, whom
lawmakers never confirmed, to the agency's No. 3 post.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Carl Ingram</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Bruce Thiesen, whose appointment by Gov. Gray Davis as chief of the
state Department of Veterans Affairs was rejected by the California
Senate, will return to the department as a top executive,
administration officials said Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Thiesen, a member of Davis' first-term administration, served as
the secretary of veterans affairs without Senate confirmation for a
year. He was forced to leave the post, which pays $131,412 a year,
Nov. 20.</LD>
<LD>   But administration officials confirmed Thursday that Davis, who
was angered by the Senate's refusal to approve Thiesen, has now named
him to the No. 3 job at the agency. In that post, deputy director of
operations, Thiesen will make $101,472 a year and will supervise the
home loan program as well as other veterans services.</LD>
<TE>   As a farm labor contractor in the San Joaquin Valley, Thiesen was
active in Davis' first gubernatorial campaign, helping to recruit
members of the American Legion to support the governor.</TE>
<TE>   Once elected, Davis promoted him to acting secretary in 2000 after
the forced resignation of Secretary Tomas Alvarado. In 2001, Davis
nominated Thiesen as permanent secretary.</TE>
<TE>   But Senate President Pro Tem John L. Burton (D-San Francisco) and
several other lawmakers urged Davis to withdraw the nomination only a
few weeks after Thiesen was appointed to the cabinet-level post. They
charged that during Thiesen's time as acting secretary, the
department's problems persisted and in some cases worsened.</TE>
<TE>   The department in recent years has weathered a string of problems.
Among them, the nursing home license at the agency's Barstow facility
was temporarily revoked after a patient there choked to death. The
department also lost millions of dollars in federal funds and has
been accused of mismanaging its multibillion-dollar home loan program
for veterans.</TE>
<TE>   Many of those were problems before Thiesen took over, and Davis
resisted calls to withdraw the nomination. But the Senate stood fast
and adjourned last summer without acting on Thiesen's confirmation.</TE>
<TE>   His term as an unconfirmed appointee expired last month.</TE>
<TE>   Thiesen's defenders argued that because the agency was already
facing troubles before he took over, it was unfair to hold him
responsible. They blamed the Senate for not giving him a full hearing
to present his case.</TE>
<TE>   Thiesen's appointment to his current post is not subject to Senate
confirmation. But Burton said he was dismayed by Davis' choice of
Thiesen as the chief manager of the mortgage program and county
services for veterans.</TE>
<TE>   "He certainly had problems being No. 1, and he'd have problems
being No. 3," Burton said. The Senate leader added that although
Thiesen is beyond the upper house's confirmation at his new post,
"maybe we'll take a look at the department's budget."</TE>
<TE>   Thiesen could not be reached for comment.</TE>
<TE>   In a statement, Davis said he was disappointed that Thiesen was
not confirmed. But he noted that during Thiesen's tenure as
department head the Barstow home regained its license and plans were
adopted with the Legislature for the construction of five veterans
homes.</TE>

<HD>Education Groups Join Forces Against Cuts</HD>
<DH>Although the state budget hasn't been presented, unions and
districts warn of dire consequences if spending is slashed.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Evan Halper</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>Fearful that Gov. Gray Davis will push to cut nearly $2 billion from
public schools, California teachers unions, urban school districts
and other education groups launched a preemptive strike in the
looming budget battle Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   The day before Davis was scheduled to release his plan to cut $10
billion from the state budget, education leaders held news
conferences during which they signaled that they are prepared for a
major battle with the governor if he includes steep reductions in
education funding.</LD>
<LD>   Some lobbyists for the groups say the Davis administration told
them it intends to cut $1.9 billion of education funding this year.
Education leaders said such cuts would be devastating and would have
a "ripple effect" of billions more in reductions in subsequent years
because of the way California's education funding formula works.</LD>
<TE>   "We're looking at what would be an education disaster in the state
of California if these cuts are made," said Wayne Johnson, president
of the California Teachers Assn. He said $1.9 billion in cuts could
theoretically force 35,000 teacher layoffs or require every school in
the state to shut down for more than two weeks.</TE>
<TE>   The public school lobby, with strong allies in the Legislature,
will be a formidable opponent for lawmakers favoring such a cut. The
teachers union has considerable resources -- it spent $1.2 million to
help elect Davis in 1998 -- and is mobilizing its membership to
resist the reductions.</TE>
<TE>   As the unions held a news conference in Sacramento with the state
Parents and Teachers Assn., the Assn. of California School
Administrators and other groups, leaders from the state's urban
school districts gathered in San Francisco to blast lawmakers for
considering such a cut.</TE>
<TE>   Caprice Young, president of the Los Angeles Unified School board,
said the reductions being talked about would strip up to $250 million
from the district in the middle of the year. "We would have to start
taking desperate and dire actions," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Officials from the governor's office said the education groups are
jumping the gun, as the Davis proposal would not even be released
until this afternoon.</TE>
<TE>   "It's tough when a press conference is held devoid of any facts
and presented as a fait accompli," said Hilary McLean, spokeswoman
for the governor. "This is a time when a lot of organizations hold
press conferences and say, 'Hey, don't look at us.' "</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, school groups weren't alone in firing early shots as the
battle to close a budget gap of more than $21 billion begins. The
League of California Cities and the State Assn. of Counties joined
with police and fire groups at a news conference to urge lawmakers
not to raid local coffers. Their leaders warned that balancing the
budget by slashing funds sent to local governments will probably lead
to layoffs of police and firefighters and put various social services
in jeopardy.</TE>
<TE>   Though Davis has declined to publicly detail his plan, he is
widely expected to announce significant rollbacks in spending on
health care for the poor.</TE>
<TE>   But attention turned to education spending last month when the
nonpartisan Legislative Analyst's Office reported that schools are
receiving $1.9 billion more than the state must spend under the
complex financing system established by the voter-approved
Proposition 98 of 1988.</TE>
<TE>   Any cut must be approved by legislators, and lawmakers from both
parties have said there would be support for such a cut in the
Legislature if Davis proposes it.</TE>
<TE>   Taking back $1.9 billion, education lobbyists warn, will have the
net effect of cutting school spending by $4.6 billion over the next
18 months because of the way the funding formulas work.</TE>
<TE>   Though the governor declined to say whether his plan includes
taking back the funds, he signaled Tuesday that education may have to
bear some of the burden of dealing with California's fiscal crisis,
as it accounts for 48% of the state budget.</TE>
<TE>   Officials from the education groups did not offer their own plan
for balancing the budget, saying it is not their job. They declined
to name other programs the state should cut to spare them the ax, and
they also said they did not necessarily favor a tax hike.</TE>
<TE>   They instead called on the governor to present a comprehensive
plan to deal with the fiscal crisis that puts everyone on a level
playing field, instead of proposing cuts piecemeal, starting with
them.</TE>
<TE>   "It's outrageous to us that cuts of this magnitude are being
discussed absent a complete plan," said Bob Wells, executive director
of the Assn. of California School Administrators.</TE>
<TE>   Legislators will begin debating the $10-billion budget reduction
Davis will present in special session Monday. The proposal will only
begin to address the state's fiscal problems. The balance of the
budget shortfall will be dealt with beginning early next month.</TE>

<LD>Minority voting rates statewide are so low that by 2040, when
nonwhites will be two-thirds of the population, whites could still
represent a majority of voters, an analysis shows.</LD>
<LD>   The analysis reinforces past findings that black and Latino voter
rates are stunted by lower socioeconomic status and citizenship rates
-- but voting by Asians, who tend to be relatively well off, is
surprisingly low.</LD>
<LD>   If the trend holds, white voters will wield disproportionate
control over the political process, according to the Public Policy
Institute of California.</LD>

<HD>State Acts to Meet Federal Teacher Credential Rules</HD>
<DH>The plan includes intensified training of some and
reclassifying others.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Doug Smith</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The California Commission on Teacher Credentialing adopted a plan
Thursday to bring the state into compliance with tough new federal
rules calling for all teachers in schools that receive federal aid to
be adequately trained.</LD>
<LD>   The strategy involves a combination of intensified training for
teacher candidates and interns and a reclassification of thousands of
teachers who have emergency permits but actually meet the new federal
standard even if they lack a state credential.</LD>
<LD>   Linda Bond, director of government relations for the commission,
said the state can implement the federal standard without the turmoil
that union and school district officials have predicted. More than
40,000 teachers in California are working on emergency permits.</LD>
<TE>   "We don't think it will be chaos at all," Bond said.</TE>
<TE>   In informal talks with the commission, federal officials have
acknowledged that some schools will not be able to comply
immediately, Bond said.</TE>
<TE>   "There was some fear the federal government would immediately
remove money," Bond said. "We are being assured that will not be the
case."</TE>
<TE>   The government is prepared to provide assistance to help those
schools get into compliance, she said.</TE>
<TE>   A spokesman for the U.S. Department of Education declined to
comment on the state's proposal Thursday, saying the agency had not
yet reviewed it.</TE>
<TE>   The new federal law goes into effect in two stages. Starting this
school year, all new teachers being placed in classrooms that receive
federal funding under the Title I program for low-income students
must be "highly qualified," meeting states' credentialing
requirements or other narrow standards. By the 2005-06 school year,
every teacher in a California classroom must meet those standards.</TE>
<TE>   The deadlines have been met with skepticism by many educators.</TE>
<TE>   Wayne Johnson, president of the 330,000-member California Teachers
Assn., said he foresees disarray if districts try to force veteran
teachers into low-performing schools.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a noble attempt to try to repair the lowest-performing
schools," Johnson said. "But if you're running 50,000 to 75,000
teachers short of fully credentialed, I don't see how this kind of
requirement solves anything. And it may make it worse."</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles Unified Supt. Roy Romer said the rules will detract
from the district's other efforts to improve low-performing schools.</TE>
<TE>   New commission guidelines, expected to be sent to school districts
within two months, should allay those concerns, Bond said.</TE>
<TE>   The vote Thursday authorizes the commission staff to establish a
new teacher intern certificate that would meet the federal standard
of "highly qualified."</TE>
<TE>   It would require a bachelor's degree and subject-matter competence
either through courses or a passing grade on a state test.</TE>
<TE>   To satisfy the required classroom experience, the intern would
have to be enrolled in a program providing intensive support and
supervision but still headed for full credentialing.</TE>
<TE>   The guidelines will urge school districts and universities to
create fast-paced programs to prepare those teachers for competency
testing. State and federal funds are available for those programs,
Bond said.</TE>
<TE>   A still-unknown number of the state's emergency permit teachers
may soon be reclassified after the commission reviews their status.</TE>
<TE>   Bond said thousands of emergency permits have been issued to
teachers who already hold credentials but are teaching in specialized
areas such as special education. Those emergency permits should not
count against federal compliance, she said.</TE>
<TE>   Margaret Gaston, co-director for the Center for the Future of
Teaching and Learning, a Santa Cruz think tank, said the state's
strategy is reasonable but does not address the disproportionate
concentration of young or inexperienced teachers in low-performing
schools.</TE>
<TE>   The center's research suggests that schools with 20% or more
beginning teachers cannot improve, Gaston said.</TE>
<TE>   "There are just too many new teachers to usher into the
profession," she said.</TE>
<TE>   "It just changes the way the school operates."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>William Parson, 89, a doctor and teacher who revamped Uganda's
medical school and served briefly as the personal physician to
strongman Idi Amin, died Nov. 25 in Seattle from internal bleeding
after a heart attack.</LD>
<LD>   Raised in the Bronx, N.Y., Parson attended Columbia College and
Columbia University's medical school.</LD>
<LD>   At 35, he was named chairman of the University of Virginia's
department of internal medicine, a position he held until he and his
wife moved to Uganda's capital, Kampala, in 1966.</LD>
<TE>   He chaired the department of medicine at Makerere University, and
established the area's first residency program.</TE>
<TE>   Shortly after the 1971 coup that brought Amin to power, Parson was
named his personal physician. Parson left Uganda the next year after
Amin started expelling the Asian community.</TE>
<TE>   Parson went on to hold teaching posts at UC Berkeley, Johns
Hopkins and Stanford. He spent several years as a professor or
advisor to universities in Indonesia, Zaire, China and Taiwan.</TE>

<HD>Ray Wallace, 84; Took Bigfoot Secret to Grave -- Now His
Kids Spill It</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Scott Martelle</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>TOLEDO, Wash.</DL>
<LD>There wasn't enough room in Ray Wallace's grave for him and his hoax,
so now the truth is out: Bigfoot didn't exist.</LD>
<LD>   Or at least not the Bigfoot that Wallace helped make famous.</LD>
<LD>   Wallace, a former logger, converted the imaginary into celebrity
in 1958 when news reports surfaced about large, mysterious footprints
found in a logging camp where Wallace worked in Bluff Creek, part of
Humboldt County in Northern California.</LD>
<TE>   Then Wallace began milking it. He reported Bigfoot sightings. He
recorded Bigfoot sounds. He played the faithful like a violin and
giggled behind his hand the whole time, said his son Michael.</TE>
<TE>   "He was a prankster, but never malicious," the son said Thursday.
"He just liked playing jokes."</TE>
<TE>   Wallace, 84, died Nov. 26 of heart failure, said the son, one of
four boys Wallace and his wife adopted and raised as they worked a
series of lumber camps across the Pacific Northwest.</TE>
<TE>   In later years, Michael Wallace said, his father ran a menagerie
of wild animals -- from cougars to skunks -- that reflected his
penchant for the unusual.</TE>
<TE>   "He made a lot of people laugh," Wallace said. "It was a fun
family to grow up in."</TE>
<TE>   The problem with a hoaxer admitting the truth is that there is a
certain inherent lack of credibility. And because serious students of
Bigfoot long suspected Wallace was faking it, the family's admission
wasn't much of a surprise and does not discredit what they see as
other evidence that Bigfoot exists.</TE>
<TE>   Jeff Meldrum, an Idaho State University anthropologist, has
studied Bigfoot sightings and had his doubts about Wallace. Knowing
that Wallace's reports were made up does little to explain away what
Meldrum sees as a wide range of Bigfoot evidence, from other
footprints -- some as early as 1941 -- to traces of hair to fecal
remains.</TE>
<TE>   Though it's possible the whole phenomenon is a series of
overlapping, independent jokes, he said, it's also likely that behind
all the noise is a real creature.</TE>
<TE>   "Bluff Creek brought the idea into the public psyche and into the
morning newspaper, but this thing has roots that go deeper than any
isolated incident," Meldrum said. "If I had come to the conclusion it
was all a hoax, I would have washed my hands of it years ago."</TE>
<TE>   Wallace's version of Bigfoot arose Aug. 5, 1958, when he used a
16-inch model of a human foot a friend carved from alder wood to
leave tracks around logging gear as a prank on a fellow logger.</TE>
<TE>   "It just freaked the guy out," Michael Wallace said.</TE>
<TE>   A story on the footprints in the Humboldt Times was picked up by
other newspapers, and word of Bigfoot spread. Over the years, Wallace
played other pranks, tweaking those who would believe.</TE>
<TE>   "It wasn't his fault that people latched onto it," the son said.
"But right from the beginning, he was Bigfoot."</TE>
<TE>   The joke was part of an arsenal of pranks Wallace developed over
the years. One favorite was to wrap an M-80 firecracker in a wet
newspaper, sneak onto the roof of a logging bunkhouse and drop it
down the chimney to the woodstove. Then he'd enter the bunkhouse in
time to have an alibi for when the firecracker exploded.</TE>
<TE>   "He'd say it must be the firewood," the son said. "The guy could
act."</TE>
<TE>   Wallace said the family decided to come clean about Bigfoot after
a reporter for the Seattle Times approached them following Wallace's
death and asked about the persistent rumors that Wallace had made it
all up. Wallace said he polled family members -- all of whom knew of
the fraud -- and they decided the time was right.</TE>
<TE>   And the last laugh, he said, is his father's.</TE>
<TE>   "He's up in heaven laughing," the son said. "He was living proof
that God has a sense of humor."</TE>

<HD>Israeli Army Kills 9 in Gaza</HD>
<DH>Incursion into a refugee camp touches off firefight. Six
Palestinians are injured.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Laura King</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM</DL>
<LD>Israeli troops and tanks, backed by helicopter gunships, raided a
crowded refugee camp in the Gaza Strip before dawn today in a hunt
for wanted militants, setting off a fierce firefight that killed nine
Palestinians and injured about six others, according to hospital
officials and witnesses.</LD>
<LD>   The Israeli army said in a statement that it was acting "against
terrorist targets" in its incursion into the Bureij refugee camp in
central Gaza. Troops demolished the home of a fugitive from the same
militant group as a Palestinian who was killed by Israeli missiles a
day earlier, but the man was not captured.</LD>
<LD>   In recent months, Israeli troops have made frequent overnight
incursions into towns and refugee camps in the West Bank and Gaza,
either to arrest or kill wanted militants or to demolish the family
homes of Palestinians who carried out or were suspected of planning
suicide bombings and other attacks against Israelis.</LD>
<TE>   Witnesses said most of the casualties in today's fighting occurred
when a tank shell was fired in the direction of a home. The army said
its troops came under "massive" fire from Palestinian gunmen, and
soldiers responded with tank shells, helicopter-fired missiles and
separate close-range gun battles.</TE>
<TE>   The fighting came as Palestinians were observing the Eid al-Fitr
holiday, which marks the end of the fasting and prayer month of
Ramadan.</TE>
<TE>   Hospital officials in the Palestinian town of Deir al Balah, close
to the camp, said the casualties were mainly from gunshot wounds and
shrapnel, but did not yet know how many of the dead and injured were
gunmen and how many were civilians.</TE>
<TE>   The army said the target of the raid was Ayman Shasniyeh, a local
leader of the Popular Resistance Committee, whose members are mainly
drawn from the ranks of Yasser Arafat's Fatah faction. Shasniyeh's
home was destroyed and one of his brothers was arrested, along with a
second wanted man, but troops did not find Shasniyeh.</TE>
<TE>   The army described the camp as a stronghold of several militant
groups, including Hamas and Islamic Jihad. Israeli Brig. Gen. Israel
Viv told Associated Press that at least four of the dead were Hamas
activists.</TE>
<TE>   Hours before the Israeli incursion, Israeli Prime Minister Ariel
Sharon told reporters that Osama bin Laden's Al Qaeda network had
operatives who were active in the Gaza Strip -- an assertion
Palestinian security officials categorically denied.</TE>
<TE>   Sharon did not provide any details, and it was not known whether
today's operation was in any way related to the Israeli claim.</TE>
<TE>   Israeli troops withdrew after the firefight, in line with what has
become the common practice of incursions into militant strongholds
lasting only a matter of hours.</TE>
<TE>   On Thursday in Gaza City, Israeli helicopters fired missiles at a
building in a Palestinian government compound, killing a Palestinian
militant who Israel blamed for engineering a string of deadly
roadside bombings of Merkava tanks during the past 10 months.
Shasniyeh was also wanted in connection with attacks against
Merkavas, the army said.</TE>
<TE>   During the past 26 months of fighting, dozens of militants have
been slain in what Israel calls targeted killings. Palestinians and
human rights groups consider them extrajudicial executions.</TE>

<HD>Glavine Agrees to Join Mets</HD>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Tom Glavine, the most sought-after pitcher on the open market,
reached agreement with the New York Mets on a three-year contract
Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Glavine's deal is believed to be worth $35 million, with an option
for a fourth year that could make the deal worth $42.5 million.</LD>
<LD>   Glavine, 36, had spent his whole career with the Atlanta Braves,
winning two Cy Young Awards and posting five 20-win seasons.</LD>
<TE>   But their NL East rivals, the Mets and Phillies, showed much more
interest in the left-hander than his old team. So it came down to a
choice between New York and Philadelphia.</TE>
<TE>   "It was one of the toughest decisions he's ever had to make," said
his agent, Gregg Clifton. "There wasn't really one thing that decided
it. He just made a decision."</TE>
<TE>   The Mets said the deal was subject to Glavine passing a physical.
That shouldn't be a problem -- he hasn't been on the disabled list
since making his major league debut with Atlanta in 1987.</TE>
<TE>   Glavine did not return a telephone message left at his home.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Cincinnati Reds and San Diego Padres agreed to trade Ken
Griffey Jr. for Phil Nevin, but the deal died when Nevin wouldn't
waive his no-trade clause.</TE>
<TE>   Nevin said Thursday that he told Padre General Manager Kevin
Towers that he wants to stay in San Diego.</TE>
<TE>   A baseball source confirmed that the teams agreed to the swap over
the Thanksgiving weekend.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   St. Louis Cardinal pitcher Andy Benes made his retirement
official, telling General Manager Walt Jocketty during an hour-long
meeting.</TE>

<LD>   UCLA (4-1) at No. 14 Georgia (2-2), Stegeman Coliseum, 4, KBET
(850) -- The Bruins are riding a four-game winning streak after
defeating St. Mary's on Tuesday behind 24 points by freshman guard
Nikki Blue. The Lady Bulldogs, whose roster has seven freshmen and
sophomores, were a top-10 team before losing last week to Arizona and
Arizona State. Freshman guard Alexis Kendrick, a former Inglewood
High standout, is starting and averaging 7.8 points.</LD>

<LD>Long Beach Wilson (36-3) will try to win its first girls' volleyball
state championship Saturday at Cypress College, although the
opponent, Mountain View St. Francis (30-1), has been close to
unstoppable.</LD>
<LD>   Wilson, with standout sophomore Cynthia Barboza -- 33 kills
Tuesday against Clovis Buchanan in the Southern California final --
will only win if it can control junior outside hitter Jessica Gysin,
who had 37 kills in last season's Division II championship victory
over Manhattan Beach Mira Costa.</LD>
<LD>   St. Francis won four of the last five Division II championships
before moving up to Division I. The match is scheduled for 7 p.m.</LD>
<TE>   Torrance Bishop Montgomery (28-8), trying for its third Division
III title in seven seasons, plays San Jose Presentation (29-7) at
1:30 p.m. The Knights won Division III championships in 1998 and
1996, and lost in the 1999 final.</TE>
<TE>   Middle blocker Noelle Quinn, who had 18 kills and 14 blocks in a
four-game victory Tuesday over North Hollywood Harvard-Westlake, and
opposite hitter Nicole Read were freshmen on the team that lost in
1999.</TE>
<TE>   L.A. Marymount (35-4) is trying for a third consecutive state
Division IV championship against a familiar opponent, Atherton Menlo
(24-6), in an 11 a.m. match.</TE>
<TE>   The Sailors swept Menlo in last year's title match, 15-5, 15-6,
15-7, as well as two years ago, 15-4, 15-10, 15-4.</TE>
<TE>   Championship play begins at 9 a.m. with Solona Beach Santa Fe
Christian (25-7) playing San Franciso University in Division V. In
Division II, Bakersfield Liberty (31-4) plays Los Gatos (27-6) at 5
p.m.</TE>
<TE>   -- Mike Bresnahan</TE>
<TE>   Costa Mesa Estancia girls' basketball Coach Tami Rappa has accused
a former player's parent of assault.</TE>
<TE>   Rappa filed a police report that said Linn Brady shoved her
shoulder into Rappa's chest because Brady was upset that her daughter
hadn't played Tuesday night in a 71-16 victory over Westminster La
Quinta.</TE>
<TE>   Brady's daughter, who Rappa said missed four practices and a game
with unexcused absences, has since been removed from the team for
violating the team's code of conduct, which includes dismissal for
missing three or more practices without a justifiable excuse.</TE>
<TE>   Rappa said she couldn't play Brady's daughter Tuesday because "she
didn't know any of the plays."</TE>
<TE>   Costa Mesa Police Officer Dale Birney said the investigation into
Rappa's accusations will be concluded within a week or two and that a
determination of whether to forward the case to the Orange County
district attorney for possible prosecution will be made at that time.</TE>
<TE>   -- Dan Loumena</TE>
<TE>   Seniors Michael Poe of Etiwanda and Phillip Reid of Oxnard Rio
Mesa and junior Mohamed Trafeh of Duarte have each won Southern
Section and state cross-country championships the last two weeks. But
finishing among the top eight --not winning -- will be their main
goal Saturday in the West region championships at Mt. San Antonio
College.</TE>
<TE>   The top eight finishers in the boys' and girls' seeded races
qualify for the national championships at Morley Field in San Diego
on Dec. 14.</TE>
<TE>   Reid posted the fastest time in the state meet when he won the
Division II race with a 15-minute 1-second clocking over the
5,000-meter course at Woodward Park in Fresno.</TE>
<TE>   Poe, who ran 15:06 in the Division I race, and Trafeh, who timed
15:13 in the Division IV final, appeared to be well within themselves
in winning their races by large margins.</TE>
<TE>   Junior Michael Haddan of Irvine Woodbridge, who placed second to
Reid in the section and state championships, is another runner from
the Southland who appears to have a solid shot at a top-eight finish.</TE>
<TE>   Junior Liza Pasciuto of Murrieta Valley, runner-up in the state
Division I final, appears to be the runner from the Southland with
the best chance at finishing among the top eight in the girls' race.</TE>
<TE>   The meet will start at 7:25 a.m with a race for seventh- and
eight-grade boys. The seeded girls' race will start at 10 a.m. and
the seeded boys' will begin at 10:40.</TE>
<TE>   The Division II boys' race of the state meet lived up to its
billing and then some.</TE>
<TE>   The race was regarded as the most talent-laden of the meet and the
results proved that as a record-high 11 runners broke 15 minutes 30
seconds and 31 broke 16.</TE>
<TE>   Reid set a Division II meet record with his winning time of 15:01
and the times for the fifth- through 13th-place finishers and for the
21st through 29th-place runners were the fastest ever recorded for
those places at any level in the state championships.</TE>
<TE>   The times for the runners in 14th, 18th, 19th, 20th and 30th place
tied the fastest ever for those positions in the meet that began in
1987.</TE>
<TE>   Runners from the Southern Section won 12 of a possible 20 titles
in the state championships, but nowhere was the section's dominance
more pronounced than at the Division I level.</TE>
<TE>   Murrieta Valley led Southern Section teams to a sweep of the first
seven places in the Division I girls' race and Los Angeles Loyola
paced a section sweep of the first six places in the boys' race.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, runners from the section took 16 of the top 20 places
in the boys' race and 26 of the top 40 in the girls'.</TE>

<LD>   Venice (10-2) vs. Woodland Hills Taft (12-0) at Woodland Hills El
Camino Real High, 7 p.m.</LD>
<LD>   Skill players abound in this matchup between two prolific
offenses. Venice, which has only lost to Santa Monica and La Verne
Damien, is averaging 37 points while Taft is averaging 41. The
top-seeded Toreadors, ranked No. 6 in the Southland by The Times,
have not been held under 30 points in a game this season, while
Venice has surpassed 40 points against Fremont and Roosevelt in the
playoffs. Gerold Rodriguez has become a big-play slot receiver for
the Gondoliers in their wide-open offense, hurting defenses that
solely focus on wideouts B.J. Vickers and Antwuan Giddens. In
addition to its usual weapons, Taft added its own wrinkle by using
Lance Broadus as a tight end. Broadus caught a touchdown in a 30-6
quarterfinal win over Dorsey. The difference might be Taft's
underrated defense, which has given up an average of 8.2 points a
game. Broadus (6-3, 225) is a Division I talent at linebacker, but
defensive end Eddie Miller (6-3, 220) and linebacker Chris Boyd (6-2,
220) have helped give the Toreadors an additional physical presence.</LD>
<TE>   -- Eric Stephens</TE>
<TE>   Gardena (9-3) vs. Lake Balboa Birmingham (9-3) at Pierce College,
7 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   The winner of this semifinal will accomplish something for the
first time in more than two decades. Gardena won its last
upper-division championship game appearance in 1973. Birmingham
hasn't been to a final since 1961. The Panthers have advanced in the
playoffs on the strength of their option running game and
opportunistic play on defense. They intercepted four passes and
forced six Jefferson turnovers in a 38-14 victory last week. Running
back DeAndre Hughes, who had 138 yards and three touchdowns against
Jefferson, and fullback Jason Franklin make it difficult for defenses
trying to contain elusive quarterback LaFerrell Payne. Birmingham has
coasted with easy victories over Van Nuys Grant and Fairfax. The
Patriots, whose three losses have come to undefeated teams (Newhall
Hart, Sherman Oaks Notre Dame and Taft), can run or pass with equal
efficiency with dangerous running back Dennis Keyes and the big-play
combination of quarterback Ryan Lombardo and wide receiver Chad
Green.</TE>

<TE>   SOUTHERN SECTION SEMIFINALS</TE>
<TE>   San Clemente (9-3) vs. Newhall Hart (11-0-1) at College of the
Canyons, 7:30 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   This is a Division II matchup between a team seeking to advance to
its first championship game since 1979 and an opponent that has been
there, won that. While San Clemente lost in its only title-game
appearance more than 20 years ago, Hart has won four consecutive
Division III titles and is riding a 34-game unbeaten streak. San
Clemente Coach Eric Patton does know what it's like to win it all,
having guided Mission Viejo Capistrano Valley to a title in 1990. The
marquee matchup will be at quarterback, where second-seeded Hart's
Sean Norton will try to outduel San Clemente's Beau Budde. Norton
rarely throws a bad pass, having thrown 218 this season before one
was intercepted. Budde completed the touchdown pass that clinched a
victory over third-seeded Chino last week. San Clemente's
multipurpose star Chris Miller could make the difference with a key
reception or field goal.</TE>
<TE>   -- Ben Bolch</TE>
<TE>   Palmdale (11-1) at Sherman Oaks Notre Dame (12-0), 7:30 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   This is a rematch of last year's Division III quarterfinal game
won by Palmdale, 14-7. The Knights didn't score an offensive
touchdown because they struggled with Palmdale's defensive speed.
Notre Dame quarterback Marcel Marquez must be able to run and pass
for the Knights to win. Second-seeded Notre Dame will also rely
heavily on defensive lineman Alex Puccinelli, who has 18 1/2 sacks.
Palmdale has been underestimated all season. Quarterback Jacob
McCravey has passed for 2,005 yards and 19 touchdowns.</TE>
<TE>   -- Eric Sondheimer</TE>
<TE>   Westlake Village Westlake (10-2) at Oxnard (11-1), 7:30 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   The recent playoff experience differs between these teams almost
as greatly as their offenses. Westlake has been to the semifinals in
two of the last three years and won the Division IV title in 1999.
Oxnard is playing in its first semifinal since 1982. Oxnard uses a
one-dimensional, yet effective, rushing attack led by Aaron Brown,
the career rushing leader for Oxnard with 3,930 yards. Westlake
counters with a balanced offense that includes bruising runner
Merrill Mullaly, who has more than 1,200 yards this season, and
quarterback Erik Vose, who passed for 360 yards last week in a 36-29
victory over Paso Robles. Oxnard has nine consecutive victories and
if Westlake wants to stop the streak, defensive linemen Jimmy Miller
and Mike Stuart must contain Brown.</TE>
<TE>   -- Peter Yoon</TE>
<TE>   Riverside North (9-3) at Murrieta Valley (11-0-1), 7 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   Riverside North showed off its big-play offense last week against
Temecula Chaparral, scoring four third-quarter touchdowns to pull
away for a 49-28 Division V victory. North will face a stiff
challenge from Murrieta Valley's defense, which has allowed only 6.5
points a game and has held five offensive units scoreless this
season. The Nighthawks also have a plus-22 turnover differential and
have not allowed an opponent to rush for more than 100 yards.
Murrieta Valley running backs Adrian Allen and Kevin Slaughter, who
combined for one carry in the quarterfinals because each had ankle
sprains, are expected to be healthy for Friday's game.</TE>
<TE>   -- Dan Arritt</TE>
<TE>   Orange El Modena (9-3) vs. Santa Ana Foothill (10-2) at Tustin
High, 7 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   El Modena blew a 21-0 halftime lead in a 28-24 loss in Week 4 to
Foothill, but the defense has been outstanding in the Division VI
playoffs, with wins over league champions Covina Charter Oak, 20-3,
and second-seeded Orange Lutheran, 24-0. Running back Daniel Dixon
has scored 35 touchdowns, and his offensive line must have a good
performance. Foothill's balanced offense presents a real challenge:
Mike Liti has rushed for 1,961 yards and Don Poole has passed for
2,503.</TE>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>While the NBA contemplates the stricken Lakers, and the Lakers ponder
the wisdom of altering the cast around Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe
Bryant, Coach Phil Jackson said Thursday that his players no longer
had the benefit of his patience.</LD>
<LD>   Even as they had one of their better days in a while -- Slava
Medvedenko did not chip a bone in his finger and therefore will try
to play with a splint on his right pinkie, and Samaki Walker should
be activated from the injured list today -- the Lakers continued to
deal with the fallout of 13 losses in 20 games. They will play the
21st tonight against the 17-1 Dallas Mavericks.</LD>
<LD>   "They were on a long, long leash this year because of past
successes," Jackson said after practice. "I told them today the
responsibility fell back on my shoulders."</LD>
<TE>   What that means, exactly, remains to be seen. After all, they're
still waiting on O'Neal's conditioning, their power forwards have
taken turns huddling under ice bags, and Devean George apparently
needs more time to recover fully from an ankle injury.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, first Bryant and now O'Neal have unloaded on the less
capable among them, questioning the desire and ability of the men who
fill out the roster.</TE>
<TE>   After another expressionless loss, this one Wednesday night in
Utah, Bryant had not the enthusiasm for another berating of
teammates. O'Neal took that baton and beat a few of them over the
head with it, leaving the impression he could use fresh talent around
him.</TE>
<TE>   "This is kind of new for this group," Brian Shaw said. "We haven't
experienced losing at this rate before. But I don't think, in the
long run, anybody doesn't respect the ability of anyone in this
locker room."</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers talked in private Thursday, and perhaps got out what
they needed to get out.</TE>
<TE>   "It's easy to cast blame," Jackson said. "It's easy to point
fingers. What we really have to have are leaders that lead and
players that follow.... We're getting to that point in the season."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Here is what the Lakers are up against: Last season, 44 wins (by
Utah) were the minimum for Western Conference playoff qualification.
If that holds this season, the Lakers will need a record of 37-25 in
their final 62 games just to get in.</TE>
<TE>   Hosting a first-round playoff series required 57 wins last spring.
If that's their goal, the Lakers must post a record of, ahem, 50-12.</TE>
<TE>   After starting last season 17-3, the Lakers finished 41-21, hosted
the first two rounds, then played a touchy Game 7 in Sacramento in
the conference finals before walking through the NBA Finals against
New Jersey.</TE>

<TE>   Records -- Lakers 7-13, Mavericks 17-1.</TE>
<TE>   Record vs. Mavericks -- 0-1.</TE>
<TE>   Update -- The Lakers have won 23 consecutive home games against
the Mavericks over 12 years. Dirk Nowitzki (21.9) and Michael Finley
(20.6) lead the Mavericks in scoring, but it was Steve Nash (21
points) who hurt the Lakers on Nov. 19 in Dallas. The Mavericks lead
the league in scoring, field-goal percentage, free-throw percentage
and fewest turnovers.</TE>

<LD>Kevin Garnett had 21 points, 15 rebounds and nine assists as the
Minnesota Timberwolves ended the Golden State Warriors' three-game
winning streak with a 114-98 victory on Thursday night at Oakland.</LD>
<LD>   Garnett has reached double figures in both points and rebounds in
18 of Minnesota's 20 games this season, including nine in a row.</LD>
<LD>   Antawn Jamison had 32 points and 10 rebounds to lead five starters
in double figures for Golden State, but the Warriors weren't able to
earn their first four-game winning streak since February 2000.</LD>
<TE>   Atlanta 98, Milwaukee 80 -- Glenn Robinson scored 23 points in his
first game against his old team, and Jason Terry added 19 for the
Hawks at Atlanta.</TE>
<TE>   Robinson was traded to Atlanta in the off-season after eight
seasons in Milwaukee, where he was part of the "big three" with Ray
Allen and Sam Cassell.</TE>
<TE>   But after the Bucks reached the Eastern Conference finals two
years ago, they fell to 41-41 last season and missed the playoffs.</TE>

for his most recent legal troubles. Patterson was arrested Nov. 25 on
a felony domestic assault charge. Prosecutors dropped the case this

<LD>Verbal attacks at boxing news conferences are nothing new. But a
promoter blasting his own fighter?</LD>
<LD>   In a scene truly bizarre, even for boxing, promoter Bob Arum
ripped Floyd Mayweather, Jr. for failing to show up Thursday at a
news conference in Las Vegas to discuss the defense of his World
Boxing Council lightweight title Saturday against Jose Luis Castillo.</LD>
<LD>   Castillo was on hand at Mandalay Bay Hotel, as were the two
heavyweights -- Wladimir Klitschko and Jameel McCline -- who will
fight in the main event at the Mandalay Bay Events Center.</LD>
<TE>   "He's getting paid $2.4 million," said Arum, pointing to
Mayweather's empty seat on the dais. "Both of the heavyweights
together [McCline $1 million, Klitschko $950,000] are not getting
that much. Does that make any sense, particularly when Floyd
Mayweather doesn't have the decency to show up? I feel sorry about
this. I really do, I want to apologize for him."</TE>

<LD>Vern Marshall, whose love of officiating took him from high school
fields to the NFL and back during his career of almost 50 years, died
Thursday of pancreatic cancer at his home in Portland, Ore. He was
67.</LD>
<LD>   After Marshall was diagnosed with the disease in October, several
of his colleagues from his 13 years in the NFL flew to Portland to
work his final high school game with him. About 100 of his fellow
Oregon high school officials showed up as well, to pay tribute to
Marshall at the game between Madison and Marshall's alma mater,
Roosevelt. (The event was chronicled in a Times story published Nov.
4).</LD>
<LD>   Marshall is survived by his wife, Tina Henderson, his sons Joe and
Vern Jr. and eight grandchildren.</LD>

<LD>Jim Furyk's eight-under-par 64 gave him a one-shot lead over Nick
Price and Padraig Harrington after the first round of the
$3.8-million Target World Challenge at Sherwood Country Club on
Thursday. Davis Love III shot a 66.</LD>
<LD>   Furyk played the five par-five holes in only three under and had
an eagle at the 531-yard No. 2, which has an island green.</LD>
<LD>   Price was five under on the par fives and so was Harrington.</LD>
<TE>   Tournament host Tiger Woods is four shots back after a 68.</TE>
<TE>   "The course was in absolute perfect condition to score," he said.
"Look at the scores. Five par-fives and all of them are reachable.
You knew you had to go low. At least I didn't shoot myself out of the
tournament."</TE>

<HD>That's a Road Hole New Story</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Thomas Bonk</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>J.H. Taylor needed 13 shots to get out of it in 1921. Tommy Nakajima
took five shots to get out of it in the 1978 British Open. David
Duval needed four shots to get out in the 2000 Open, proving the Road
Hole Bunker still had teeth.</LD>
<LD>   Two months ago, at the Dunhill Links Championship, Ernie Els took
an eight on the same hole, the infamous 17th on the Old Course at St.
Andrews, the hole that boasts what is probably the biggest, baddest,
deepest bunker in the history of golf.</LD>
<LD>   What has happened since Els finally got the sand out of his shoes
is a controversy worthy of Agatha Christie or P.D. James, involving
the most famous hole, the most famous bunker and the most famous
course in golf.</LD>
<TE>   A past captain of the New Club in St. Andrews swore the bunker had
been moved four feet away from the green. A minister of the Links
Trust, which oversees all the courses in St. Andrews, swore it
hadn't.</TE>
<TE>   The bunker is two feet shorter. No, it is only eight inches
shorter.</TE>
<TE>   The 461-yard par-four will play easier. No, it will play harder.</TE>
<TE>   Changing the Road Hole bunker? What's next? A full smile on the
Mona Lisa? Paving the canals in Venice?</TE>
<TE>   "You can't leave something forever," Colin Montgomerie said
Thursday at Sherwood Country Club at the Target World Challenge.
"Every course has been tweaked. Augusta has made changes.</TE>
<TE>   "On the other hand, I'm sure you won't see them doing anything
with first and 18th ... or the clubhouse," he said. "Whatever changes
they've made, they'll do a good job, I'm sure."</TE>
<TE>   Mark O'Meara, who won the 1998 British Open at Royal Birkdale,
says the thing to do is to check it out in person.</TE>
<TE>   "No one thought the bunker was so bad when it got deeper," he
said. "The hole is still really hard. Don't make too big an issue out
of it until we see it."</TE>
<TE>   The problem is, when you're talking about the Road Hole, you're
talking about history and tradition and golf, sort of a holy trinity.
Many considered the Road Hole sacrosanct.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm surprised," architect Rees Jones said. "I don't know if
'shocked' is the right word.</TE>
<TE>   "But with the ball going farther, it's a strange time in our
golfing evolution to be making the green easier."</TE>
<TE>   In Jones' opinion, technology already has made the hole easier and
cutting back on the steepness of the bunker will make it even
simpler.</TE>
<TE>   Caroline Nurse, communications manager of the Links Trust, pointed
to Els' plight, said the hole had become too difficult for the
average golfer and pointed out that constructing an expanded
gathering area had compensated for a shorter bunker. The theory is
that putts will be more likely to roll off the green into the bunker.</TE>
<TE>   "Like they don't do that already," Tiger Woods said.</TE>

<DL>Mexico</DL>
<LD>Mexico, which was knocked out of the 2002 World Cup when it was
beaten, 2-0, by the United States in South Korea in June, will have
the chance to atone for that defeat -- at least in part -- in two
months' time.</LD>
<LD>   Coach Ricardo Lavolpe announced in Mexico City on Thursday that
his team will play Argentina, Spain and the U.S. in February as it
prepares for the CONCACAF Gold Cup, to be held most likely in
Foxboro, Mass., Miami and Washington, July 12-23.</LD>
<LD>   The locations and dates of Mexico's games against Spain and the
U.S. have not been finalized but will take place in the latter half
of February. Lavolpe debuts as national coach against Argentina on
Feb. 5 at the Coliseum.</LD>
<TE>   Galaxy to Spain?</TE>
<TE>   The Galaxy and the San Jose Earthquakes, Major League Soccer's
2002 and 2001 champions, respectively, are negotiating to take part
in the La Manga Cup in Spain as part of their preparation for the
2003 season, according to Soccer America magazine.</TE>
<TE>   Brazilian Semifinals</TE>
<TE>   Santos and Corinthians advanced to the Brazilian league's
championship final Thursday as they disposed of Gremio and
Fluminense, respectively, in the second match of the two-game
semifinal series.</TE>
<TE>   Gremio managed a 1-0 victory over Santos in Porto Alegre on a
Rodrigo Fabri goal, but it was not enough to overcome a 3-0
first-game defeat. Santos, seeking its first championship since 1984,
went through, 3-1, on aggregate.</TE>
<TE>   Fluminense had won its first semifinal game, 1-0, on a Romario
goal, but when the 1994 World Cup winner left the second game because
of groin strain, Corinthians took full advantage and won, 3-2, with
Guilherme scoring twice.</TE>
<TE>   That evened the aggregate score at 3-3, but Corinthians, led by
Brazil's 1994 World Cup-winning coach Carlos Alberto Parreira,
advanced to the final because of their better regular-season record.</TE>
<TE>   Cheesesteak United</TE>
<TE>   The Philadelphia Eagles will not be the first football team to
play at their new home, Lincoln Financial Field. Manchester United
will be, although the English Premier League club's opponent for the
Aug. 3 match, part of a four-game tour of the U.S., has not been
announced.</TE>
<TE>   Manchester United will play Juventus of Italy on July 30 or 31 at
Giants Stadium in East Rutherford, N.J., and two other games before
that are being arranged for the Coliseum and Foxboro, but can't
conflict with the Gold Cup, which ends July 23.</TE>
<TE>   Mexican Quarterfinals</TE>
<TE>   Defending champion Club America had to come from behind twice to
earn a 3-3 tie on the road against Santos Laguna as the quarterfinals
of the Mexican league playoffs continued to produce surprises.</TE>
<TE>   Santos Laguna got two goals from its Chilean striker, Rodrigo
Ruiz, in the 30th and 65th minutes, to go along with one in the 61st
minute by Eduardo Lillingston, but Club America countered with a pair
of goals by Argentine forward Hugo Norberto Castillo in the 38th and
70th minutes after a 33rd-minute strike by Cuauhtemoc Blanco.</TE>
<TE>   In another quarterfinal match Wednesday night, Guadalajara scored
twice in the final six minutes to the delight of 60,000 at Jalisco
Stadium in Guadalajara as Chivas upset Toluca, 2-1.</TE>
<TE>   Paraguayan striker Jose Cardozo had given Toluca the lead in the
56th minute, extending his scoring streak to 12 consecutive games,
but Guadalajara tied it on a Jair Garcia goal in the 84th minute and
won when Emilio Mora scored three minutes later.</TE>
<TE>   Also, Morelia all but secured its place in the semifinals with a
3-1 road victory over UAG, while Cruz Azul and UNAM played to a 0-0
tie.</TE>
<TE>   The games were the first in a two-game series which continues over
the weekend.</TE>
<TE>   Russian Riot</TE>
<TE>   One man was sentenced to four years in prison and three-dozen
other people are being charged in connection with the riot in Moscow
that followed Russia's 1-0 loss to Japan at the 2002 World Cup,
ITAR-Tass reported.</TE>
<TE>   The fans had been watching the game on a large-screen near the
Kremlin and overturned vehicles and set them afire after Russia was
ousted from the tournament.</TE>

<KH>Q &amp; A WITH MITCH KUPCHAK</KH>
<HD>Is the Lakers' Age Still Golden, or Just Olden?</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Tim Brown</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There are miniature championship trophies to Mitch Kupchak's left,
the rosters of 29 NBA teams to his right in the second-floor office
of the gray building on Nash Street, El Segundo.</LD>
<LD>   Behind and below him, the Lakers -- then 6-12, now 7-13 --
scrimmaged loudly, sneaker squeaks muffled by shouts for open
jumpers, or missed ones.</LD>
<LD>   Ultimately, Kupchak, the general manager, along with owner Jerry
Buss and Coach Phil Jackson, will decide if the Lakers have become an
aging, vulnerable team, or simply have started that way and remain
capable of winning a fourth consecutive NBA title.</LD>
<TE>   Question: What most concerns you about the season's first five
weeks?</TE>
<TE>   Answer: Probably the record itself. There may be an illusion that
you can rattle off eight or 10 wins in a row, but the fact remains,
you have to win the first one. And then you have to win a second.
When you lose, it normally brings out the worst in people, and we've
lost more than we lost since this group has been together. It's been
a test and I can't say we've passed the test with flying colors.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Kobe Bryant's contract extension, three years for nearly $55
million, is still out there. Why should he take that today?</TE>
<TE>   A: It's the most you can pay a player. As the home team, we have
the ability to pay more than other teams, the difference between
12.5% and 10% [raises]. And we can do an additional year, seven
years. If he played it out and chose to do something else, he could
only get a six-year deal. As soon as we were able to do it, we did
it. And it's there for him. Just let us know.</TE>
<TE>   We have a great relationship with his representative [Arn Tellem].
We have a great relationship with Kobe. This is where he's indicated
he wants to be. We have no reason to believe there's anything else
there, whether it's anything we hear through the grapevine or, more
importantly, what he or his agent tell us.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Did this team pass its prime this summer?</TE>
<TE>   A: It's possible that that may have happened and that we may not
be able to win a fourth championship. We'll have to play the season
to find out. However, our record -- 6-12 -- and I say this because
Denver is in a rebuilding mode, they've got some nice, young players.
But [four] days ago, Denver had a better record than we did. So, this
team did not age so much over the summer that we're not as good as a
team that's rebuilding. That much is clear. We are underachieving,
and I think the group knows that.</TE>
<TE>   Q: How seriously did you consider adding a veteran power forward
to this team over the summer?</TE>
<TE>   A: The power forwards that you're talking about, a Charles Oakley
type, we talked about him. But we also felt that with the group we
have, while we don't have one guy who jumps out at you, that's where
we have the most depth. Charles Oakley is not a backup center. He's a
power forward. I'm not so sure we had the ability to go out there and
get whoever might be a premier power forward. The guys that you're
talking about, we talked to them all.</TE>
<TE>   Q: When was your last conversation with Jerry West and what did
you talk about?</TE>
<TE>   A: I spoke to him from the Maui Classic on the day of the game [in
Memphis]. I asked him to cut us some slack tonight. He laughed a
little bit about it. I spoke to him about a week before that. I asked
him how he was doing. He said he was struggling, because he was
getting beat up twice a day. He said he'd watch their game, and at
that point in time they had not won a game yet, and then he'd go home
and watch our game, and we didn't play well either. We joked about
that. We talk more now than we did in the last two years.</TE>
<TE>   Q: What do you miss the most about Chick Hearn?</TE>
<TE>   A: This year, it's been an adjustment-type year, with Jerry really
being gone and now Chick is gone. And then at one point Earvin
[Johnson] contemplated going to Seattle. I found myself sitting at my
desk thinking something I never thought I'd be around to witness
might be happening here. That was something I talked to Earvin about.
You know, 'Don't do this to me. I'm not sure we can handle it, with
you being gone also.' A comment my wife made drove the whole thing
home. A lot of times, she'd be in the house, games on the East Coast
would come on at 4, 5 o'clock, a couple hours later on the West
Coast. She'd put the TV on. A house with kids, what she does, that
time of the night, with dinners, I'm running around trying to calm
the kids down, but she'd have the TV on. She made the comment that
just having Chick's voice was comforting to know that, hey, there's a
Laker game on, there's Chick again. She said to me how odd it was
that that voice is not there anymore.</TE>
<TE>   Q: Jerry Buss and Phil Jackson have said they have agreed to talk
after the season regarding a contract extension for Jackson. How
critical is Jackson's long-term involvement here?</TE>
<TE>   A: Phil and I have talked as well, in general. Without a doubt, I
can't tell you, No. 1, how easy it's been to work with him. I think
we have a great working relationship. No. 2, how happy I am, and the
organization is, to have him here with this group. This is not an
easy group to manage. I'm not sure how many other coaches could do
it, although I'm sure a bunch would like to try. If he chose to
leave, we'd have to find somebody. But that's something I hope would
not happen for some time to come. Although everybody doesn't always
get along down there, whether it's a snap in the paper or a snap at
practice, they have tremendous respect for each other. I would not
like to take the chance that that might not be the same with another
coach.</TE>

<HD>Rose Bowl Needs Escape to the Past</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>J.A. Adande</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>USC Coach Pete Carroll stood with a group of reporters, discussing
potential bowl scenarios. When a Washington State-Florida State Rose
Bowl spun by on the merry-go-round, Carroll paused to ask, "Whatever
happened to Pac-10, Big Ten?"</LD>
<LD>   It's a modern-day version of "Where have you gone, Joe DiMaggio?"</LD>
<LD>   This isn't easy to say, kids, but the Granddaddy has been sent to
the nursing home. The oldest, purest and best bowl game has moved
over for this fraudulent excuse for a national championship known as
the BCS.</LD>
<TE>   The only way for the Rose Bowl, as we knew it, to come back is to
escape -- and pull the Pacific 10 and Big Ten conferences along with
it.</TE>
<TE>   If we're stuck with bowls (because the playoff fairy won't be
appearing any time soon), we might as well do them properly.</TE>
<TE>   The Rose Bowl used to have the cleanest format. The winners of the
Pac-10 and the Big Ten played in Pasadena on New Year's Day (unless
Jan. 1 fell on a Sunday). Money and politics didn't enter the
discussion.</TE>
<TE>   Now there's far too much discussion. Before USC beat Notre Dame
last Saturday, the focus was on whether the Trojans could get shut
out of a BCS game even with a victory. This week there's still talk
about possible trips to the Orange or Sugar bowls.</TE>
<TE>   The focus for any Pac-10 team should always be Pasadena. But it's
clear the Trojans have South Beach and the French Quarter on their
minds as well.</TE>
<TE>   When Troy Polamalu was asked if the Rose Bowl were still the
team's primary goal he replied, "Uh, well ... yeah, definitely. USC
is always synonymous with the Rose Bowl. But we'll see what happens."</TE>
<TE>   There should be no, uhs, wells, buts or ellipses about it.</TE>
<TE>   A Rose Bowl bid for USC -- or Washington State, for that matter --
would be hassle-free. If UCLA beats Washington State on Saturday, the
Trojans get to go because they had the fewest conference losses in
the Pac-10. If Washington State beats UCLA on Saturday, the Cougars
deserve to go because they beat USC head-to-head.</TE>
<TE>   But if USC goes to the Orange Bowl ahead of Kansas State, there
will be legitimate complaints coming from the plains that the 10-2
Wildcats, who beat USC, didn't get a fair shot.</TE>
<TE>   Being BCS-free means never having to apologize.</TE>
<TE>   And it doesn't necessarily mean going broke.</TE>
<TE>   Currently, a conference gets to split $13.5 million for putting
one team in a BCS game and gains $4.5 million more if a second team
is selected.</TE>
<TE>   The Rose Bowl traditionally has a large payout, with or without
the BCS. It would have no problem keeping pace with BCS bucks.</TE>
<TE>   "Your finances come from two main sources: ticket sales and
television revenues," Pac-10 assistant commissioner Jim Muldoon said.
"Would the television networks be willing to pay what they're paying
for a BCS bowl? I think you could probably approach it."</TE>
<TE>   Right now, ABC has locked up the rights to all of the BCS bowls.
Perhaps a sports-starved NBC would be interested in showcasing the
Rose Bowl by itself on New Year's Day.</TE>
<TE>   What about that second-team payout?</TE>
<TE>   For the Big Ten, the tie-in to the Capital One (formerly Citrus)
Bowl in Orlando, Fla., for its second-place team brings in $4.25
million, which is more money than any other non-BCS bowl pays.
Bolting the BCS would help keep the Capital One Bowl an attractive
game instead of contributing to the ripple effect that weakens all of
the non-championship bowls. For example, the Big Ten could have sent
co-champion Iowa this year and those Hawkeye fans would have flocked
to Florida. Instead, with Iowa BCS-bound, the Capital One Bowl picked
fourth-place Penn State (9-3 overall, 5-3 in the Big Ten) rather than
invite third-place Michigan (9-3, 6-2), which had played in the game
the previous two years.</TE>
<TE>   The destination for the Pac-10's second team, the Holiday Bowl in
San Diego, pays only $1.9 million. But at least the conference
wouldn't have to spend money to make money. The conference has been
willing to give up to $500,000 in travel packages to entice the
less-motivated Southern California fans to leave their sunny climate
and fly all the way to New Orleans or Miami just to ensure enough
hotel room bookings to satisfy the bowls. With USC, UCLA, Arizona,
Arizona State, California and Stanford all within a day's drive of
San Diego, that wouldn't be necessary. And fans in the chilly, rainy
Pacific Northwest would be eager to come down to the perfect weather
at the Holiday Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   What about the other major issue, the fear of exclusion from the
national championship picture?</TE>
<TE>   Well, BCS membership hasn't made a difference for the Pac-10,
which was shut out of the first four BCS title games and probably
won't get a crack at this one.</TE>
<TE>   And Ohio State's Fiesta Bowl trip will mark the Big Ten's first
invite to the "championship" game. But they'll lose to Miami anyway.</TE>
<TE>   Michigan won a share of the national championship with a victory
over Washington State in the 1998 Rose Bowl. And under the current
scenario, the media could still deem a worthy team champion, even if
it didn't play in the BCS championship game.</TE>
<TE>   The indications from Pasadena are that the Rose Bowl folks are
having second thoughts. They knew going in that they'd have almost
guaranteed irrelevance in the three years they didn't play host to
the title game. When the Rose Bowl finally did get a crack at No. 1
vs. No. 2, it was that Miami-Nebraska dud.</TE>
<TE>   Now they're missing out on Ohio State -- and possibly Iowa.</TE>
<TE>   "I know the Tournament [of Roses] is looking at all their
potential matchups and not happy with some of them," Muldoon said.</TE>
<TE>   But he sounded skeptical that the other participants -- especially
the Big Ten -- could be persuaded to return to the old setup.</TE>
<TE>   None of the talk coming from the Big Ten office indicates a
willingness to change.</TE>
<TE>   "We are committed to the BCS system," Big Ten associate
commissioner Sue Lister said.</TE>
<TE>   Remember when the commitment belonged to the Rose Bowl?</TE>
<TE>   There's always hope for a reconciliation with that old
relationship, that faithful one that worked for 55 years.</TE>

<HD>Angels Get Big Raise in Allowance</HD>
<DH>Disney approves an increase in payroll to $84 million for
2003, which will enable champions to keep roster intact.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bill Shaikin</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Angels' quest to repeat as World Series champions will be fully
funded by the Walt Disney Co. Even as Disney tries to sell the
Angels, the company has approved a steep increase in player payroll
that will allow the team to keep most of its championship roster
intact.</LD>
<LD>   The $84-million budget represents more than all but seven clubs
spent last season. And, at a time when most clubs are freezing or
slashing budgets, Disney has approved a 43% jump in player payroll
over the past two seasons. The Angels' payroll last season was $62
million.</LD>
<LD>   "We're one of a few clubs where the budget is increasing, and I
would call that increase substantial," General Manager Bill Stoneman
said Thursday. "It is generous, and it keeps a good team together."</LD>
<TE>   In the weird world of baseball economics, the payroll increase all
but ensures Disney's reported financial losses will worsen, even with
the increase in ticket prices the Angels are expected to announce
shortly. The increase also does not allow Stoneman to pursue
expensive free agents but permits him to pay the raises necessary to
retain players.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels must pay raises totaling $12 million to nine players
under long-term contracts -- pitchers Kevin Appier, Ramon Ortiz, Troy
Percival and Aaron Sele, outfielders Garret Anderson, Darin Erstad
and Tim Salmon, third baseman Troy Glaus and catcher Bengie Molina.
Raises for five players eligible for salary arbitration -- pitchers
Jarrod Washburn and Scott Schoeneweis, infielders Adam Kennedy and
Scott Spiezio and designated hitter Brad Fullmer -- could cost
another $10 million.</TE>
<TE>   Several key players -- including shortstop David Eckstein,
utilityman Shawn Wooten and relievers Brendan Donnelly, Francisco
Rodriguez and Ben Weber -- are not eligible for arbitration, so the
Angels can pay whatever they like above the $300,000 minimum wage.</TE>
<TE>   "The big issue for us is to try to keep as much of this club
together as we can, so we can keep the depth that was a big part of
our success," Manager Mike Scioscia said.</TE>
<TE>   For instance, the Angels plan to retain Schoeneweis as a
left-handed reliever rather than replace him with a cheaper rookie.
Scott Boras, the agent for Schoeneweis, has asked the Angels to
consider trading the displaced starter to a team that would allow him
to start again, Stoneman said. Boras did not return calls Wednesday,
but Stoneman said he did not plan to honor the request.</TE>
<TE>   "He pitched very well out of the bullpen, and he's the only
left-hander we've got coming back there," Stoneman said. "So I don't
have an inclination to do anything along those lines."</TE>
<TE>   The forthcoming increase in ticket prices is expected to generate
a small fraction of the revenue that would be necessary to offset the
payroll hike. For the first time, the Angels plan to implement a
variable pricing system in which higher prices are charged for games
in higher demand -- for example, weekend games against the Dodgers
and New York Mets.</TE>
<TE>   Kevin Uhlich, senior vice president of business operations,
declined to discuss details of the pricing structure but said the
Angels plan to keep their average ticket price below the major league
average. According to Team Marketing Report, the Angels' average
ticket price last season was $11.79, the next-to-lowest figure among
American League teams.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Angels' already legendary comeback in Game 6 of the World
Series became even more legendary with the revelation that Erstad hit
a home run despite a broken bone in his right hand, an injury that
made every swing an uncomfortable one.</TE>
<TE>   "How about that?" Scioscia said. "And he had a diving catch in
Game 7 too. That's Ersty. He's going to leave body parts all over the
field."</TE>
<TE>   The Angels trailed, 5-0, in Game 6, with the San Francisco Giants
eight outs away from the World Series championship. They responded
with the greatest comeback of any team facing elimination in the
history of the Series.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   ESPN has asked major league officials to shift the Angels' season
opener from Monday, March 30 to Sunday, March 29, so the game against
the Texas Rangers can be televised nationally. The Angels have
endorsed the move; they would raise their championship pennant in
prime time but defer World Series ring ceremonies to the second home
game.</TE>
<TE>   The Oakland Athletics and Seattle Mariners are scheduled to open
the 2003 season with two games in Japan earlier that week.</TE>
<TE>   "We'll be the first game in North America," Uhlich said.</TE>

<HD>Arledge's Creativity, Calm Captivated Young Ebersol</HD>
<DH>Chairman of NBC Sports recalls former boss' clear thinking
while covering the Munich massacre.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Alan Abrahamson</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When Roone Arledge and his young assistant, Dick Ebersol, finally
left the ABC studios in Munich, West Germany, on the morning of Sept.
5, 1972, the only people still left inside were janitors, sweeping
floors. It was just before dawn.</LD>
<LD>   Just a few hours before, Mark Spitz had won his seventh gold medal
at the Olympic swimming pool. Arledge and Ebersol went outside and,
under a dark night sky, lingered for perhaps 20 minutes, reveling in
the Olympic action and ABC's coverage. They stood in a driveway, near
some dumpsters, the fence to the Olympic village just a few yards
away.</LD>
<LD>   Finally, Arledge's driver pointed to his Mercedes and said, "Come
on. The kid at least needs some sleep. Let me take you home." So they
left -- and as they turned the corner, the Palestinian terrorists who
would forever change the Olympic movement climbed out of the
dumpsters, scaled the fence and headed for 31 Connollystrasse, where
much of the Israeli team was sleeping.</LD>
<TE>   In a remarkable career that forever changed sports, as well as
television, Arledge -- just as he was that day in 1972 -- always, it
seemed, had a knack for being ahead of the story. Arledge, 71, died
Thursday in New York of complications from cancer.</TE>
<TE>   Much of what seems commonplace today in the American broadcast
landscape is attributable in large measure to Arledge:</TE>
<TE>   * Sports broadcast in prime-time hours.</TE>
<TE>   * Innovations such as hand-held cameras, sideline microphones,
instant replay, slow-motion replay and, in the booth, three
announcers.</TE>
<TE>   * And, perhaps most important, a commitment to storytelling -- to
the "Up Close and Personal"-style of broadcasting that has come to
dominate the Olympics in particular.</TE>
<TE>   "Before Roone, sports wasn't on Broadway in American life," said
Ebersol, for the last several years chairman of NBC Sports. "But the
explosion followed. It has never stopped since."</TE>
<TE>   From 1967 until 1974, Ebersol worked closely with Arledge,
initially as ABC's first Olympic researcher, then, beginning in 1970,
as Arledge's assistant.</TE>
<TE>   No one could have been a better, and more influential, mentor,
Ebersol said.</TE>
<TE>   No one could have been so imaginative, searching always for a new
idea.</TE>
<TE>   Ebersol said Arledge was responsible for making sports a
prime-time event, first by showing network executives that there was
a prime-time audience for the Olympics, in Mexico City in 1968, then
a few years later with "Monday Night Football," which ABC and CBS
turned down before Arledge -- at great personal risk -- got ABC to
sign off on.</TE>
<TE>   "Roone laid his career on the line," Ebersol said. "He said, 'This
will work. I guarantee this will work.' "</TE>
<TE>   In the early 1970s, Ebersol said, "Sports as we know it in the
United States was a good business, but it wasn't a gigantic business.
By Roone bringing it to prime time, he encouraged so many other
people to see the unscripted drama in sports. And the money followed.</TE>
<TE>   "Without Roone, there wouldn't be an ESPN today. Who would care?</TE>
<TE>   "There wouldn't be countless 24-hour sports stations on radio.
Because who would care?"</TE>
<TE>   For all the hard work and dedication to craft, Ebersol said, no
one could have been more fun than Arledge.</TE>
<TE>   Arledge was a teller of stories rooted in all he had done and seen
and read. He loved to nurse a glass of wine, preferably red,
preferably French. He delighted in a cigar, preferably Cuban.</TE>
<TE>   When he became Arledge's personal assistant, Ebersol said, he
would get a phone call in his apartment every morning at 7:30. It was
Howard Cosell, the in-your-face ABC announcer. "He'd say, 'You were
the last one with Roone last night, at some restaurant. What did he
say about x and y?' " Later, Arledge would call.</TE>
<TE>   "After two weeks, my girlfriend at the time said, 'Something's got
to give.' The next day, I told Cosell to stop calling me in the
morning."</TE>
<TE>   Arledge was notoriously horrible at returning phone calls. It
wasn't that he was being intentionally rude, Ebersol said. Rather, he
was too busy reading books or newspapers or watching movies to bother
with the daily grind.</TE>
<TE>   "This was the best-read news and sports executive who ever lived,"
Ebersol said. "He just wouldn't give into having the minutiae of
corporate life interfere with him. He would miss countless board
meetings and stuff."</TE>
<TE>   Arledge went to ABC to produce college football -- prepping at a
show on NBC that featured Shari Lewis and her Lamb Chop puppet,
Ebersol said. He arrived at ABC with what was then a revolutionary
idea -- to put show biz in sports, as Ebersol put it, to "take the
fan to the game, to take the viewer to the game."</TE>
<TE>   In 1961, Arledge created "Wide World of Sports," which would prove
to be one of the most popular TV sports shows ever, along with its
notable tag line -- the promise to bring viewers "the thrill of
victory and the agony of defeat."</TE>
<TE>   That sense of unscripted drama is ultimately what led Arledge to
create the "Up Close and Personal" segments -- on the theory that TV
ought to personalize the athlete, especially in Olympic sports that
typically aren't closely followed in non-Olympic years because, as
Ebersol said, "once you personalized the athlete, you get a sense of
drama."</TE>
<TE>   That idea also underpinned Ebersol's first ABC job, as Olympic
researcher. "Basically," he said, "I was going to spend a year and a
half roaming the world, getting to know the athletes ... so that the
announcers could talk about these people on the air like characters
in a drama. All Roone's idea.</TE>
<TE>   "This curiosity pervaded everything with Roone. If I was to think
of two qualities other than the fun he was, it was his curiosity and
his calm."</TE>
<TE>   Never was that sense of calm more evident than on Sept. 5, 1972,
in the hours that followed the Palestinian terrorists' takeover of
the Israeli compound at the athletes' village in Munich.</TE>
<TE>   Shortly after the terrorists announced themselves, Arledge was
back in the control room. "He was in a business with people who
scream and yell," Ebersol said. "He was the calmest producer in the
world."</TE>
<TE>   At one point, Ebersol said, German authorities pulled the plug on
cameras that had afforded a view looking down into the village. "It
took Roone two seconds to take some cameras that had been in the
studio, open the doors, move them outside and focus them 100-150
yards down," on the same scene.</TE>
<TE>   Arledge "had to get up once and calm down Howard," meaning Cosell,
who wanted air time, Ebersol said. "He got Howard out of the control
room. Howard was probably angry about it for years afterward. But
Roone defused it. He knew Howard was not right to put on the air; he
was overwrought."</TE>
<TE>   As the ordeal progressed, Ebersol said, Arledge "was the calmest
source, vetting every piece of information before it was passed on to
Jim," meaning anchor Jim McKay. Late in the day, for instance, some
other news outlets went with a story -- which turned out to be untrue
-- that the hostages had been freed; ABC did not.</TE>
<TE>   ABC's coverage of the Munich massacre subsequently earned a
variety of sports and news journalism awards.</TE>
<TE>   In 1977, Arledge was tabbed to take over ABC's news operations.</TE>
<TE>   Ebersol recalled that critics said at the time, referring to ABC
News, "They'll make it 'Wide World of News,' with Howard Cosell.</TE>
<TE>   "Yet the evidence was there -- on Sept. 5, 1972 -- that he could
do it better than anyone ever had."</TE>

<LD>Would you pay more to see the Angels play the New York Yankees than,
say, the Detroit Tigers? Is it worth $5 or $10 more to see the Kings
play the Colorado Avalanche, as opposed to the Atlanta Thrashers?</LD>
<LD>   So-called "variable ticket pricing," teams raising ticket prices
on weekends or for games against traditional rivals, hasn't hit
Southern California yet. But it's a hot trend in baseball and hockey.</LD>
<LD>   The New York Mets announced this week that their ticket prices
will vary, according to the opponent, day or month, joining the
Yankees, Indians, Braves, Rockies, Giants and Devil Rays in going to
tiered prices. The NHL's Senators, Canucks, Penguins and Lightning
already have adopted the system.</LD>
<TE>   "Fans understand now that if they want to see the Yankees in the
middle of June, when the weather's great, they'll probably have to
pay more for it," Rockies' spokesman Jay Alves said.</TE>
<TE>   The best seat to see the Mets play the Giants will cost $53. To
see the Brewers, the same seat will cost $38.</TE>
<TE>   Trivia time: Elton Brand recently tied a Clipper record with his
third 20-point, 20-rebound game. Who are the three other Clippers
with three 20-20 games?</TE>
<TE>   Oh, those crazy kids: Swimmers and divers at Dartmouth College,
told their program would be cut to save money, put their team up for
sale on EBay.</TE>
<TE>   The starting price was $212,000, the amount school officials said
would be saved if swimming and diving were eliminated from the
athletic budget.</TE>
<TE>   Obvious issues about selling human beings aside, it's not likely
to work. Not that anyone really expected it to.</TE>
<TE>   "We do need money, but it's mainly for publicity," sophomore
swimmer Alex Bochicchio said. "It came about as a joke."</TE>
<TE>   Scared straight: Linebacker Pisa Tinoisamoa, who plans to give up
his final year of eligibility at Hawaii to make himself eligible for
the NFL draft, said he had turned his life around since he spent four
months in prison during his senior year at Vista (Calif.) High for
felony assault convictions.</TE>
<TE>   Tinoisamoa said he gets inspiration from San Diego Charger
linebacker Junior Seau, who lived in the same Samoan community in
Oceanside.</TE>
<TE>   "He keeps me pushing, knowing he came from the same place I did,"
Tinoisamoa said. "He's doing the same thing I could do. That pushes
me every day."</TE>
<TE>   Tiger balm: Tiger Woods' mother, Kultida, kept a tradition going
by giving her son a new Tiger head cover for next season.</TE>
<TE>   It's customized, because she stitches the words "Love From Mom" in
her native Thai onto the cover.</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: Swen Nater, Michael Cage and Benoit Benjamin.</TE>
<TE>   And finally: Red Sox shortstop Nomar Garciaparra told the Boston
Herald he has no problem working for a general manager who's younger
than he is. The Red Sox last week hired 28-year-old Theo Epstein as
their GM, and at 29, Garciaparra is about six months older than his
boss.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, Garciaparra joked, going young might be the way to
finally end the team's misery.</TE>
<TE>   "The older guys haven't worked out since 1918," he said, "so maybe
we're trying the younger guys."</TE>

<HD>Coliseum May Be Charging Ahead</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The San Diego Chargers have yet to trigger the escape clause in their
Qualcomm Stadium lease, but potential Los Angeles suitors already
appear to be forming a line.</LD>
<LD>   Mark Fabiani, the team's point man on new stadium issues, said the
Chargers were approached this week by a Coliseum representative
offering to apprise Charger officials on the potential NFL future of
that stadium. "We declined to engage in any discussion with the
Coliseum's representative, and we emphasized that we are now
completely focused on finding a solution in San Diego," Fabiani said
Thursday via e-mail.</LD>
<LD>   Coliseum General Manager Pat Lynch said he was unaware of any such
contact, adding it would be legally "inappropriate" to have
conversations with the Chargers before they notified San Diego of
their intentions.</LD>
<TE>   "We all are advised by our attorneys not to talk to anybody until
they're legally able to talk without any legal encumbrances," Lynch
said. But he added: "I can't control everyone associated with the
Coliseum. So whether anybody else had any contact, that's unknown to
me right now."</TE>

<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>The San Diego Chargers thought they'd found a way to keep hordes of
rowdy Oakland Raider fans from invading Qualcomm Stadium.</LD>
<LD>   But Raider Nation apparently won't be fully denied its biggest
trip of the year when Oakland plays the Chargers on Sunday in an AFC
West showdown. Both teams are 8-4 and lead the division.</LD>
<LD>   Recent Raider games in San Diego have been marred by violence,
attributed to heavy drinking and the large number of Raiders fans.</LD>
<TE>   In July, the Chargers begged season-ticket holders to keep their
tickets to this game. Also, people buying fewer than 25 tickets to
the game had to buy an equal number of tickets to two other games --
likely a ploy to win back home-field advantage from Raider fans.</TE>
<TE>   But if Raider fans want tickets, plenty are available. Ticket
brokers have them. So do scores of sellers on EBay and in the
newspaper classifieds.</TE>
<TE>   Season-ticket holders are bailing, either because of fear or free
enterprise. "The season ticket holders are the sellers and the Raider
fans are the buyers," said Vince Campise, owner of Atlas Tickets
Services in San Diego.</TE>

<LD>CINCINNATI AT CAROLINA</LD>
<LD>   Kickoff: Sunday, 10 a.m.</LD>
<LD>   The line: Carolina by 3 1/2</LD>
<TE>   Quick slant: Panthers, streaking again.</TE>
<TE>   Plot: The Panthers were never as good as their record suggested
back when they were 3-0. Were they as bad as their record suggested
when they then went 0-8? The argument could be made. Now, after
having won again, in hard-to-watch fashion over Cleveland last
Sunday, Carolina is primed for a 2-0 run with this home game against
the 1-11 Bengals. Why play this one? The league apparently has its
reasons. Carolina rookie defensive end Julius Peppers has decided to
bail out now, giving up on the appeal of his four-game suspension.
The pressing question is: Can he bear to watch?</TE>

<TE>   SAN FRANCISCO AT DALLAS</TE>
<TE>   Kickoff: Sunday, 10 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   The line: San Francisco by 4 1/2</TE>
<TE>   Quick slant: Teams of the '90s: Where are they now?</TE>
<TE>   Plot: They said it would never happen, but last week the Cowboys
finally ended the drought and managed to win consecutive games for
the first time since December 2001. Sunday, the 49ers try to end
another drought, one that has vexed them since 1997. The last time
San Francisco won the NFC West title, Jeff Garcia was still rolling
out across Canada with the Calgary Stampeders. Since then, the 49ers
have watched Atlanta, New Orleans and St. Louis twice win the West --
but Sunday, the title will be theirs with a win in Dallas coupled
with a St. Louis loss or tie. Realignment's been a huge hit in the
Bay Area.</TE>

<TE>   CLEVELAND AT JACKSONVILLE</TE>
<TE>   Kickoff: Sunday, 10 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   The line: Off</TE>
<TE>   Quick slant: When in doubt, punt the kicker.</TE>
<TE>   Plot: All things considered, Jacksonville kicker Richie Cunningham
thought he'd had a pretty good day Sunday. He made the only
field-goal attempt he tried and went two for two on extra points. But
the Jaguars lost to Pittsburgh, 25-23, and Coach Tom Coughlin
couldn't fire his defense -- though he probably thought about it --
so he decided to cut Cunningham and sign free agent Danny Boyd, the
fourth kicker through Coughlin's revolving door since September.
Coughlin said he didn't like how Cunningham handled kickoffs, both
on-side and regular. See, the Jaguars do a lot of kicking off.</TE>

<TE>   ST. LOUIS AT KANSAS CITY</TE>
<TE>   Kickoff: Sunday, 10 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   The line: Kansas City by 5</TE>
<TE>   Quick slant: Chiefs in a show-them state of mind.</TE>
<TE>   Plot: Remember when Dick Vermeil coached the Rams? Back then, Kurt
Warner passed like Trent Green, Marshall Faulk ran like Priest Holmes
and the Rams won the Super Bowl. Vermeil hasn't been back to the
Super Bowl since, and he won't be going this season, but at 6-6, his
Chiefs remain playoff-hopeful and upbeat, unlike the 5-7 Rams, who
spent the week getting an earful from Warner's wife Brenda, who beat
the Rams to this brainstorm: Maybe someone ought to X-ray Kurt's
right hand. So the Rams did. Hairline fracture. That explains
Warner's wobblers. But what about Mike Martz's?</TE>
<TE>   Monday's headline: "Vermeil Shows Rams 'The Way We Were' "</TE>

<TE>   BUFFALO AT NEW ENGLAND</TE>
<TE>   Kickoff: Sunday, 10 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   TV: Channel 2</TE>
<TE>   The line: New England by 4 1/2</TE>
<TE>   Quick slant: Waiting for Bledsoe.</TE>
<TE>   Plot: There's a "Countdown to Bledsoe Bowl II" clock on the Boston
Globe Web site, ticking off the days, hours, minutes and seconds
until ex-Patriot Drew Bledsoe returns to Foxboro. (For those less
obsessed, kickoff is Sunday, 1 p.m. EST.) The tone in the Boston-area
newspapers has changed a bit since the countdown to Bledsoe Bowl I,
which is to say the panic about the Patriots getting rid of the wrong
quarterback has subsided some. The Patriots won Bledsoe Bowl I, 38-7,
on Nov. 3 -- in Buffalo. Now the Patriots are 7-5 and tied for first
and their fans are firmly behind Tom Brady until ... what's that
clock say?</TE>
<TE>   Monday's headline: "Bledsoe, Bills Down for Count"</TE>

<TE>   HOUSTON AT PITTSBURGH</TE>
<TE>   Kickoff: Sunday, 10 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   The line: Pittsburgh by 13 1/2</TE>
<TE>   Quick slant: Thanks for the help, Kordell. Now take a seat.</TE>
<TE>   Plot: If Kordell Stewart really thought he had a chance to reclaim
the Steelers' starting quarterback job when Tommy Maddox was injured,
he has the correct answer now. Despite winning both of his relief
starts and netting almost 300 combined pass-rush yards last week
against Jacksonville, Stewart returns to the bench Sunday as Maddox
returns to the lineup. That's life as a backup quarterback -- and if
Stewart needed any clarification, there it is: Maddox No. 1, Stewart
No. 2. It could be worse. Stewart could be quarterbacking the Texans.
Poor David Carr needs his own collision air bag.</TE>

<TE>   ATLANTA AT TAMPA BAY</TE>
<TE>   Kickoff: Sunday, 10 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   TV: Channel 11</TE>
<TE>   The line: Tampa Bay by 4</TE>
<TE>   Quick slant: Michael Vick revisits the last speed bump.</TE>
<TE>   Plot: The world was much different on Oct. 6, the day Tampa Bay
defeated the Falcons in Atlanta, 20-6. Those were Vick's
pre-sainthood days, back when the scouting reports read: Injury
Waiting to Happen. Those seemed to be the same old Falcons as well --
off to yet one more 1-3 start. So much has changed since then,
including the NFL, which has yet to figure out how to stop Vick or
the Falcons, who haven't lost since Oct. 6. Now the Falcons are the
hottest team in pro football, Vick is an established superstar and
Tampa Bay is 9-3 and relying almost entirely on its defense. Some
things never change.</TE>
<TE>   Monday's headline: "Brief Setback for the Vick Revolution"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   INDIANAPOLIS AT TENNESSEE</TE>
<TE>   Kickoff: Sunday, 10 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   The line: Tennessee by 2</TE>
<TE>   Quick slant: Guess who's top seeded in the AFC.</TE>
<TE>   Plot: The Colts began November in the throes of a three-game
losing streak, with fans beginning to question the wisdom of the Tony
Dungy hire and the crunch-time ability of Peyton Manning. Four weeks
later, the Colts are 8-4 and seeded No. 1 in the AFC, which goes to
show what one good month in today's NFL can do for a team.
Indianapolis hasn't lost since Nov. 3, the last time the Colts played
the Titans. Tennessee won that game, 23-15, after opening a 20-0
lead. The Titans have won six of seven and are one game behind the
Colts in the AFC South. Finally, realignment produces its first new
rivalry.</TE>

<TE>   N.Y. GIANTS AT WASHINGTON</TE>
<TE>   Kickoff: Sunday, 10 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   The line: Washington by 2 1/2</TE>
<TE>   Quick slant: Opportunity squandered.</TE>
<TE>   Plot: Three weeks ago, the Giants beat the Redskins, 19-17, on the
same day Philadelphia lost Donovan McNabb to a broken ankle. At the
time, the Giants were 6-4, on a three-game winning streak, one game
behind the Eagles in the NFC East standings. Despite a rash of
injuries and their perpetually stop-start offense, the Giants sensed
the season opening up for them, the division title theirs for the
taking. And then, they bobbled it, losing consecutive games to
Houston and Tennessee to fall to 6-6, three games behind the Eagles.
In the NFC East, when the going gets tough, the tough play for Andy
Reid.</TE>

<TE>   DETROIT AT ARIZONA</TE>
<TE>   Kickoff: Sunday, 1 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   The line: Arizona by 1 1/2</TE>
<TE>   Quick slant: Lots of good reasons to stay away.</TE>
<TE>   Plot: If hockey is ever going to make it in Arizona, Arizona needs
more football games like this one. The Lions are 5-23 since September
2001. The Cardinals are 0-6 since teasing local fans with a 4-2 start
-- the latest loss a 49-0 shutout against Kansas City, the worst
defeat in Cardinal history, which includes many bad defeats in
Chicago and many more in St. Louis. Things are so bad, an Arizona
Republic sports columnist has advised fans to boycott Sunday's game.
That shouldn't be difficult. Without editorial assistance, football
fans in Arizona have been boycotting the Cardinals for years.</TE>
<TE>   Monday's headline: "Cardinals Continue To Boycott Victory Column"</TE>

<TE>   NEW ORLEANS AT BALTIMORE</TE>
<TE>   Kickoff: Sunday, 1 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   The line: New Orleans by 2 1/2</TE>
<TE>   Quick slant: Jeff Blake Reunion Tour continues.</TE>
<TE>   Plot: Baltimore Coach Brian Billick has named Blake his starting
quarterback for the rest of the season, which is not especially
surprising when you consider that, A) Chris Redman is not Brett
Favre; B) the Ravens are 6-6 and still have an outside shot at the
playoffs; and C) the Ravens' next opponent is New Orleans, where
Blake spent the previous two seasons. Billick is smart enough not to
underplay the Blake revenge factor. Last month, Blake played against
another former team, Cincinnati, and won, 38-27. The Saints, coming
off an emotionally and physically taxing win over Tampa Bay, had best
be wary.</TE>

<TE>   PHILADELPHIA AT SEATTLE</TE>
<TE>   Kickoff: Sunday, 1 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   The line: Philadelphia by 3</TE>
<TE>   Quick slant: Making the quarterback position irrelevant.</TE>
<TE>   Plot: So, what was that we were saying about Donovan McNabb being
the most valuable player in pro football? Since McNabb broke his
ankle, the Eagles have started their second- and third-string
quarterbacks -- and are 2-0. First, Koy Detmer beat the 49ers in San
Francisco. Then, A.J. Feeley stepped in after Detmer dislocated an
elbow and defeated the Rams. Three games, three quarterbacks, three
victories. How deep does the Eagle depth chart run? Fourth string
belongs to Tim Hasselbeck, younger brother of Matt, also known as the
losing quarterback of Sunday's game in Seattle.</TE>

<TE>   DENVER AT N.Y. JETS</TE>
<TE>   Kickoff: Sunday, 1:15 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   The line: Denver by 1</TE>
<TE>   Quick slant: Masters of no one's destiny.</TE>
<TE>   Plot: Never let facts get in the way of a rousing good pep talk,
Herman Edwards always says. Trying to rally his Jets for a December
stretch drive, Edwards told his players that they will make the
playoffs if they win their last four games. Nice try, Herm, but no.
The best the Jets can finish is 10-6. AFC East rivals Miami and New
England and wild-card hopefuls Tennessee and Denver all have chances
to finish 11-5. If three of them do, the 10-6 Jets will be spending
January at home. Denver knows this too, and is bringing in
quarterback Brian Griese on Sunday to see if he can do something
about it.</TE>

<TE>   OAKLAND AT SAN DIEGO</TE>
<TE>   Kickoff: Sunday, 1:15 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   TV: Channel 2</TE>
<TE>   The line: Oakland by 3</TE>
<TE>   Quick slant: L.A. Past versus L.A. Future.</TE>
<TE>   Plot: An AFC West first-place showdown between the Raiders and the
Chargers on the second Sunday in December? Who'd have thought it? Not
the Broncos, but that was before three losses on game-ending field
goals left them 7-5, one game behind the good-month, bad-month
Raiders and the suddenly charmed Chargers, who would be 6-6 today if
Jose Cortez and Jason Elam had converted overtime field-goal
attempts. Yes, the Chargers have been lucky. Yes, the Raiders seem
just the team to put the Chargers in their place. Intriguing stat:
Marty Schottenheimer is 20-5 in his last 25 games against the
Raiders.</TE>

<TE>   MINNESOTA AT GREEN BAY</TE>
<TE>   Kickoff: Sunday, 5:30 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   TV: ESPN</TE>
<TE>   The line: Green Bay by 9 1/2</TE>
<TE>   Quick slant: Chad Clifton, Vikings done for the season.</TE>
<TE>   Plot: Green Bay wrapped up the NFC North championship with four
weeks to spare, thanks to Brett Favre (he keeps winning, no matter
who's playing wide receiver) and Mike Sherman (in his previous life,
he plugged the holes in wheels of Swiss cheese) and the
across-the-board collapse of the Bears, Lions and Vikings -- each
3-9. Sherman lost another offensive lineman this week when Clifton
went on injured reserve. Sherman could use this month to rest some
injured starters, but the Packers are seeded third in the NFC. The
drive for home-field advantage begins here.</TE>

<TE>   CHICAGO AT MIAMI</TE>
<TE>   Kickoff: Monday, 6 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   TV: Channel 7</TE>
<TE>   The line: Miami by 9</TE>
<TE>   Quick slant: Dave Wannstedt feeling better about things now.</TE>
<TE>   Plot: Wannstedt coached the Bears for six uneventful seasons,
never fashioning more than a 9-7 record and signing off with 4-12
seasons in '97 and '98. After a year off, he moved to Miami and has
gone 11-5, 11-5 and 7-5 heading into Monday night's reunion. The
Bears, meanwhile, still have a chance to turn the very rare trick of
following a 13-3 season with a 3-13 reversal. They should lose to the
Dolphins, who need to win to maintain a share of first place in the
AFC East. Then Chicago gets the Jets, Panthers and Buccaneers. It
could come down to Carolina.</TE>

<KH>CLIPPER REPORT</KH>
<HD>Gentry Longs for Continuity</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Elliott Teaford</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There were unfamiliar sights and sounds inside the Clipper locker
room after their victory Wednesday over the Miami Heat. Were those
smiles on the faces of the Clipper players? And was that laughter?</LD>
<LD>   "It's been a tough year," Coach Alvin Gentry said Thursday. "We
all understand that. Everybody's been working hard, but it's been a
disappointment from our standpoint. Forget about what everybody else
thinks. We have not executed the way we can, especially down the
stretch. We needed something positive to happen for us."</LD>
<LD>   Despite reports to the contrary, the Clippers are not a team on
the verge of an emotional breakdown. Tensions have built among the
coaches as the team has struggled to win in the face of a string of
injuries, but the players remain a jovial group, particularly after a
rare victory.</LD>
<TE>   "We've lost a lot of games we shouldn't have lost," Gentry said,
referring to recent fourth-quarter breakdowns that led to losses to
the Indiana Pacers and Denver Nuggets. "We have to stay in the race,
then when we do get healthy, we need to make a run and do something
special. I still think this can be a very good team. We need
continuity. We need the same guys playing night in and night out. For
the most part, we've played good basketball.</TE>
<TE>   "When we played Orlando at home and Portland up there, those were
the only two games we were never in. We've been up in the fourth
quarter at some stage in the game and played well enough to win all
the others.</TE>
<TE>   "The only thing I've been a little frustrated with is, as a coach,
you expect to win no matter who's hurt. You've got to execute and
you've got to get the ball in the basket. You've got to find a way to
get the ball in the basket and rebound. Those are the two things.
That's what Indiana did to us. Reggie Miller put the ball in the
basket."</TE>
<TE>   And the Pacers rallied from a seven-point deficit Sunday to defeat
the Clippers.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Point guard Andre Miller sat out practice because of soreness in
his sprained left ankle, a day after playing 32 minutes and scoring
13 points and adding seven assists against the Heat.</TE>
<TE>   Forward Lamar Odom (ankle) and center Michael Olowokandi (knee)
practiced, although the team mostly worked in a half-court setting at
less than full speed. Odom is on target to play by Christmas and
Olowokandi is expected to come off the injured list when he is
eligible Wednesday.</TE>
<TE>   Forward Corey Maggette has been undergoing daily rehabilitation
exercises on his right knee. He had arthroscopic surgery to remove
damaged cartilage last Friday. Maggette is expected to sit out at
least another three weeks.</TE>

<HD>UCLA Sweeps Away 49ers</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mike Bresnahan</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The struggles this season were many for UCLA, a program not used to
finishing in the middle of the Pacific 10 Conference, much less
fidgeting nervously while the NCAA selection committee announced its
women's volleyball pairings Sunday.</LD>
<LD>   But there the Bruins were Thursday, upsetting Long Beach State in
the first round of the NCAA tournament, 30-25, 30-27, 30-21, at
Pepperdine, and becoming the first team to sweep the 49ers since
their loss to Stanford in last year's NCAA championship.</LD>
<LD>   Winners of six national titles, the Bruins had a rough regular
season, losing four consecutive Pac-10 matches for the first time
since 1997 and stumbling to a fifth-place tie with Washington.</LD>
<TE>   Not to mention the horror of getting swept by USC ... twice.</TE>
<TE>   "Losing does create doubts," said outside hitter Lauren Fendrick,
one of three UCLA players with nine kills Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   "But when we played high-ranked teams, we'd back off a little bit
and pull inside of our shell, and make errors on our own side of the
net. It was nice tonight to see us overcome that and finish our
games."</TE>
<TE>   Long Beach State's problems started with the selection committee's
decision to send the 49ers (28-4) on the road for at least the first
two rounds, an unpopular decision among Long Beach coaches and
players.</TE>
<TE>   Things didn't get any better against UCLA (20-13). Long Beach
swept the Bruins last year in the quarterfinals, but was outplayed in
almost every category this time.</TE>
<TE>   Traditionally strong defensively and in serving, the 49ers had
fewer digs than UCLA, 42-39, and fewer aces, 8-2.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps most surprising: Long Beach State was third in the nation
in blocks, but lost in that category as well, 11-6.</TE>
<TE>   "I saw players on their team play like I've never seen them play
before," Long Beach State Coach Brian Gimmallaro said.</TE>
<TE>   Elisha Thomas had 15 kills and Lindsay Phillips had 10 kills and
nine hitting errors for Long Beach State. Heather Cullen had 10 kills
for UCLA.</TE>
<TE>   Pepperdine plays host to UCLA tonight in the second round. The
Waves swept the Bruins, 37-35, 30-25, 30-25, in a nonconference match
Nov. 12 at UCLA.</TE>
<TE>   Pepperdine def. Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, 30-19, 30-16, 30-19 --
Katie Wilkins had 13 kills and the Waves tied a school record with
their 15th consecutive victory, matching a streak from the 1991
season.</TE>
<TE>   Stacy Rouwenhorst had 11 kills and four blocks for the Waves
(24-6), who continued to ride the momentum of a 14-0 record in West
Coast Conference play.</TE>
<TE>   "We said we have six steps to go [coming into the tournament].
We're at one," Pepperdine Coach Nina Matthies said.</TE>
<TE>   Cal Poly (15-13) had 32 kills and 22 hitting errors.</TE>

<BD>Special to the Times</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Major news organizations, including The Times, offered an expanded
obituary on Manfred Ewald, the former East German minister of sport
who died last month. Even though the Berlin Wall fell in 1989 and his
country no longer exists, his death was considered worldwide news
primarily because of his former role as an architect of East
Germany's nefarious drug program for athletes.</LD>
<LD>   Almost a month later, the death of Prince Alexandre de Merode, a
prominent figure with the International Olympic Committee for four
decades and a well-known anti-doping advocate, received similar
coverage.</LD>
<LD>   Merode, a Belgian who died at 68 of lung cancer, was among
founders of the IOC medical commission in 1967. He, at least early in
the campaign, fought arduously to clean up the rampant use of
steroids and other performance-enhancement drugs in sports.</LD>
<TE>   One might assume they were opposing generals in the still-raging
drug war. In reality, both contributed to the scarring, physical and
psychological, of many athletes -- one because of his actions, the
other by his inaction.</TE>
<TE>   Ewald was no ordinary, run-of-the-mill sports figure, but rather
the minister of sport and the president of his nation's Olympic
committee for nearly 30 years. He oversaw a sports machine that
produced about 500 Olympic medals from a country with only 17 million
people.</TE>
<TE>   He wore many hats during his tenure. In addition to being the
"sportsfuhrer" of the former GDR, he also had strong ties to the
Jenapharm Pharmaceutical Co. and to the IOC in Lausanne, Switzerland.
His credentials might have been perceived in some circles as
impeccable.</TE>
<TE>   But he also commanded a task force of doctors, trainers and
coaches who masterminded the biggest doping scam in the history of
sports. In addition to recruiting youngsters identified as potential
talent for the state, he and his team of experts systematically
injected more than 10,000 East German athletes (some as young as 11)
with illegal and dangerous performance-enhancing drugs.</TE>
<TE>   Anabolic steroids and their synthetic derivatives were forced upon
youngsters with the intent of winning medals and elevating the
political prestige of East Germany.</TE>
<TE>   Ewald and his colleagues had great success. But the cost to the
nation and its citizens was devastating. The pills and the injections
have led to severe health problems for thousands of former East
German competitors. Many athletes suffer from heart disease,
pancreatic cancer, liver tumors and severe depression.</TE>
<TE>   Women were most severely affected. Many have ovarian cysts,
deepened voices, facial hair (which requires heavy makeup to
disguise) and miscarriages. Many women have given birth to deformed
children; some are now blind, many born with club feet. The list goes
on.</TE>
<TE>   While meeting with scholars in Germany researching my book:
"Faust's Gold, Inside the East German Doping Machine," I studied
carefully how Ewald and colleagues pulled off what was a
three-decade-long scam. Fortunately, all of the doctors and their
subordinates kept meticulous notes and log books of every pill,
injection and steroid cocktail given to each athlete.</TE>
<TE>   These notes were subsequently found in Stasi (East German secret
police) records, leading Berlin prosecutors to file 412 indictments
and prosecute GDR officials for "intentionally committing bodily
harm" to minors and other athletes. Found in the Stasi files and
other documents was shocking evidence of a state-sponsored doping
regime that led right to the top of President Erich Honecker's
government.</TE>
<TE>   And one must ask: How did this go unnoticed, undetected and
unpunished by Merode and friends at the IOC?</TE>
<TE>   Ewald, in fact, was honored by the IOC in 1985 when then-President
Juan Antonio Samaranch awarded him "the Olympic Order," which is the
Olympic movement's equivalent of the Nobel Peace Prize.</TE>
<TE>   By then, it had become increasingly difficult to tell the good
guys from the bad guys, fact from fiction. In 1994, Merode told
Associated Press that documents confirming six positive drug tests
were "apparently shredded" during the cleanup of his room in the
Biltmore Hotel after the 1984 Olympics in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Ewald might have had a happier end had he bought himself a
shredder. He, along with many other officials, was prosecuted and
given a small fine and 22 months of jail time, which became a
probated sentence because of his poor health.</TE>
<TE>   Ewald was born in 1926, the son of a tailor. During the trials --
which I attended and wrote about -- it was disclosed that he joined
the Hitler Youth movement in 1938 and in 1944 became a full-fledged
member of the Nazi party. At 27, in 1953, he worked his way up to a
significant position in East Germany's Central Committee. His Nazi
past reared its ugly head during the Berlin doping trials, and
reached a painful moment of despair when chief counsel Michael Lehner
yelled at one of Ewald's colleagues, Dr. Lothar Kikpe, and said: "You
are the Joseph Mengele of the GDR."</TE>
<TE>   Unlike his indicted co-conspirators and other GDR coaches and
doctors who acknowledged use of illegal steroids and administration
of the injections, Ewald denied involvement in the state-sponsored
system of performance-enhancement drugs. "Communists do not murder
people!" he said before his testimony.</TE>
<TE>   While most of the athletes I interviewed who testified against
Ewald and other officials at the criminal trials felt some relief and
vindication, nearly all were furious because he refused to accept
responsibility for his crimes against humanity. Some women brought
forth their deformed children and, with the permission of the
presiding judge, asked Ewald to look at the children and see what
harm he had caused other human beings, another generation.</TE>
<TE>   The German government recently established a victims' compensation
fund to assist more than 1,000 athletes who have applied for support.
But the bitterness and suspicion remain. Many German athletes
returned their medals to the IOC and asked that officials restore
proper acknowledgment upon the "true winners" of Olympic contests.
This includes many of our preeminent U.S. female swimmers from the
Munich, Montreal and Seoul Olympics. Their requests have fallen on
deaf ears.</TE>
<TE>   Merode, who in later years was equally passive in dealing with the
rampant drug use among Chinese athletes, and his colleagues were
approached in January 1998 with a formal request to review the GDR
doping situation. He was asked to apologize to the American swimmers,
not to restore medals, just to offer a simple apology. He refused and
reminded those in attendance that the "IOC is not in the business of
rewriting history."</TE>
<TE>   The story does not end with the obituaries of Ewald and Merode.</TE>
<TE>   Documents have emerged from the Berlin prosecution files
indicating that one drug from the Ewald era, androstenedione (a.k.a.
andro -- made notorious by baseball's Mark McGwire) was designed and
produced as part of the East German program. Although this drug is
banned in some sports, it is widely available in health food stores
and sold pervasively on the Internet.</TE>
<TE>   According to one U.S. government study, nearly 4% of high school
seniors have used steroids, and some 500,000 adolescents have
"cycled" through steroid use at some point. A study of Massachusetts
middle schools found that 2.7% of kids admitted to trying steroids
for sports performance. The Drug Enforcement Administration and
Justice Department have also become quite alarmed as new patent
applications have surfaced, filed by former GDR doctors, who now want
to bring their pharmacological brilliance to the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   And finally, we must not always point fingers across the ocean but
face some very unpleasant skeletons in our own closet. A lawsuit
filed by former U.S. athletes is pending in U.S. District Court in
Denver. The complaint alleges doping practices by American coaches
and trainers on some of our former elite athletes. One athlete has
come forward and noted that his trainer was previously employed in
the former German Democratic Republic. The case is scheduled for
trial in April.</TE>

<HD>Oates' Game Is on the Mend</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>CHICAGO -- Last season, Adam Oates led the NHL with 64 assists but he
has only five this season with the Mighty Ducks, heading into
tonight's game at Chicago.</LD>
<LD>   But Oates, who ranks third in assists among active NHL players,
knows it's going to take time for him to get his total game back
after sitting out 15 games following hand surgery Oct. 26.</LD>
<LD>   "It feels good to be back," said Oates, who has two points in five
games since returning to the Mighty Duck lineup Nov. 27 against
Phoenix. "My game is slowly coming back."</LD>
<TE>   Because Oates shoots right-handed and his injury was to his left
hand, making plays with his backhand has given him some problems.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm still a little hesitant," said Oates. "But it's coming
around."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   After scoring 11 power-play goals in 2001-02, captain Paul Kariya
already has eight in 27 games this season.</TE>
<TE>   Coach Mike Babcock believes that Kariya's strong start is a result
of being more aggressive in five-on-five situations.</TE>
<TE>   "When Paul pushes the pace and is on people forechecking, he's so
effective," Babcock said. "When he's being involved in the play and
guys are hacking him because he's that involved, that's good."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   TONIGHT</TE>
<TE>   at Chicago, 5:30 PST</TE>
<TE>   TV -- Fox Sports Net 2</TE>
<TE>   Site -- United Center.</TE>
<TE>   Radio -- KPLS (830).</TE>
<TE>   Records -- Ducks 9-9-6-3, Blackhawks 11-11-3-0.</TE>
<TE>   Record vs. Blackhawks -- 1-0-0-0.</TE>
<TE>   Update -- Goaltender Jean-Sebastien Giguere, who made 27 saves in
a 3-2 victory over Chicago last week at Arrowhead Pond, is expected
to start tonight for the Ducks. He did not play Wednesday at Buffalo.
Defenseman Ruslan Salei is questionable after sitting out three of
the last four games because of an injury to his back and abdomen.
Chicago may be without defenseman Boris Mironov, who left the team
early this week because he wants to be traded.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>From birth until death, everyone is taught to never quit. It's a
four-letter word not to be uttered. That might make the decision of a
teenager to leave a sports team a family crisis.</LD>
<LD>   It happened to the Kase family three years ago. Cody Kase quit the
football team at Newhall Hart High midway through his freshman
season.</LD>
<LD>   It was a stunning decision, considering Kase's oldest brother,
George, had been a starting defensive tackle at UCLA.</LD>
<TE>   Except Cody was having a miserable experience. He was 14 and
playing tackle football for the first time. The coaches made him play
offensive line, and he hated it.</TE>
<TE>   "It was like being tortured, having no fun, going through it every
day," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, he decided to quit so he could concentrate on his
favorite sport, basketball. But first, he had to face his family.</TE>
<TE>   "That was the hardest part, having to tell my family I didn't want
to play," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Kase's father, George Sr., and mother, Judy, let him quit under
one condition: He'd try football again as a sophomore.</TE>
<TE>   Friends didn't understand his decision.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of people didn't take it the right way," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Kase continued going to games as a spectator and immediately had
second thoughts.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't regret my decision, but I wished I could be out there,"
he said.</TE>
<TE>   Come sophomore year, Kase was back on the football field. He was
bigger, faster, more mature and playing new positions, receiver and
defensive end.</TE>
<TE>   "I already had my mind set I was going to prove I could do a lot
better," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Today, he's a 6-foot-3, 195-pound senior who might be the best
two-way player in the Southern Section Division II playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   As a receiver this season, he has 47 receptions for 887 yards and
13 touchdowns. As a linebacker, he has six interceptions, five sacks
and 74 tackles.</TE>
<TE>   "He's all over the field," defensive coordinator Rick Herrington
said. "Sometimes you have to throttle him down. He wants to be in on
every tackle. He's a great athlete."</TE>
<TE>   In basketball, Kase was the Foothill League player of the year as
a junior. He might be the Foothill player of the year in football.</TE>
<TE>   It has worked out for the best because Kase's family made the
right choices in deciding how to deal with a sports crisis.</TE>
<TE>   There's no correct answer whether a parent should let a young
athlete leave a team or force them to keep playing. Every situation
is different.</TE>
<TE>   If Kase had been told to keep playing, he said, "I probably would
have quit anyway but with a lot more anger."</TE>
<TE>   The compromise requiring Kase to return the following year was
parenting at its best. It kept Kase's options open and gave him time
to figure out if he had made a mistake.</TE>
<TE>   "I grew up since kindergarten going to my brother's games, and
they knew I'd come back," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Kase was a terrific athlete who needed to gain the confidence and
maturity to play tackle football. He remembers how he felt as a
sophomore stepping onto the football field.</TE>
<TE>   "We got pads on, and that's when everyone is a step ahead of me,
but I was with everyone," he said. "I kept getting better and better.
I think every time I step on the field, I'm a better player than the
last time."</TE>
<TE>   Kase started at linebacker last season when Hart won its fourth
consecutive Division III championship. This season, he made the tying
48-yard touchdown reception on the final play against Los Alamitos in
the season opener. He'll be trying to help Hart (11-0-1) defeat San
Clemente in tonight's Division II semifinal game at College of the
Canyons.</TE>
<TE>   He has become a college prospect with a 3.5 grade-point average
and 1200 score on the SAT. He even knows how to deal with the
uncomfortable topic of quitting.</TE>
<TE>   "I think you probably shouldn't quit in most cases, but if it's a
situation not for you and is a last resort, you should, but you
shouldn't just quit because it's not going your way," he said.</TE>
<TE>   In two weeks, when football season is over, Kase plans to join the
basketball team. But make no mistake where Kase's heart and
allegiance lies -- football.</TE>
<TE>   "It's definitely my favorite sport now," he said.</TE>

<HD>Baker Rallies to Defeat Fink</HD>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>On the brink of elimination after dropping the first set without
winning a game and squandering a three-game lead in the second set,
Palm Desert senior Robyn Baker looked toward the darkening sky and
yelled: "This is so ugly. C'mon, pick it up."</LD>
<LD>   Baker then fought her way into and through a tiebreaker to a 0-6,
7-6 (1), 7-5 victory over Calabasas sophomore Amanda Fink in the
quarterfinals of the Southern Section girls' tennis singles
tournament Thursday at SeaCliff Country Club in Huntington Beach.</LD>
<LD>   "I have a lot of fight in me," Baker said. "I didn't want to lose,
and a lot of times, I play my best when I'm down. I love the fight, I
love the competition."</LD>
<TE>   The 2 1/2-hour match between Baker and Fink was the last of
several marathons to be completed on a long, exhausting day as
players competed through two rounds to advance to today's 10:30 a.m.
semifinals.</TE>
<TE>   Thanks to her victory over the third-seeded Fink, unseeded Baker
will be there to face Villa Park junior Lindsey Nelson, the No. 2
seed who lost in the final last season. Nelson advanced Thursday with
a 6-3, 6-1 victory over Marlborough's Yelena Olshanskaya in the
morning and a 6-1, 6-2 victory over Lauren Jones of Mission Viejo
Capistrano Valley in the quarterfinals.</TE>
<TE>   Top-seeded Elizabeth Exon, a Michigan-bound senior who had
advanced to the semifinals for the third consecutive season, picked
up a 6-1, 6-0, fourth-round victory over Palm Desert's Hillary
Collins and a 6-2, 6-0 quarterfinal victory over Mykala Hedberg of
Oxnard. The sophomore had the upset of the day with a 6-2, 6-1 win

<HD>Ile De France Settling Into Role of Favorite</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Even though she really has never won a race, Ile De France probably
will be favored in what serves as Hollywood Park's feature this
afternoon.</LD>
<LD>   A gray daughter of Storm Cat out of the stakes-winning mare Cara
Rafaela, Ile De France isn't a maiden, but she scored her only
"victory'' after a disqualification June 10, 2001.</LD>
<LD>   Making her debut for owner-breeder Stud TNT and trainer Richard
Mandella, Ile De France was second under the wire, three lengths
behind longshot Bully's Del Mar. However, Bully's Del Mar was
disqualified for interference and placed last after the stewards
ruled she'd caused Gold Scammer, the 2-5 favorite, to fall.</LD>
<TE>   Since then, Ile De France has managed two seconds and a third in
six starts while tackling some of the top runners in her class. One
of her runner-up tries was a head loss to Farda Amiga, the probable
3-year-old filly champion, in an optional claimer on the Santa Anita
turf Feb. 9.</TE>
<TE>   Making her first appearance in Inglewood since finishing sixth in
the Hollywood Breeders' Cup Oaks this summer, Ile De France will
break from the outside in the field of seven and be ridden by Alex
Solis. Other contenders include Smart Lacy, Golden Band and Premiere
Event.</TE>
<TE>   Race of the day: A well matched group of eight older claimers will
get together at 5 1/2 furlongs on the turf in Hollywood Park's third,
the first leg of the pick six.</TE>
<TE>   Who's hot: A.C. Avila. The trainer has won with six of his first
16 starters at Hollywood Park. He won a race on Wednesday with 2-1
favorite Fatal Caper in the eighth and with 7-2 Passionate Caper in
Thursday's second. Both horses were sired by Town Caper.</TE>
<TE>   Who's not: Omar Camejo. The jockey has won with three of his first
76 mounts at Calder.</TE>
<TE>   Exotically speaking: A pick four singling Himalayan in the fifth,
using Rainbow Acorn and Adina Duca in the sixth, Ile De France and
Smart Lacy in the seventh and Brigade, Valiant Vision,
Thisone'sforernie and Bully's North in the eighth.</TE>
<TE>   Winners: Previous day/meet total: 0/53. Money: Previous day/meet
total: $0/301.20. Total money bet: $374.</TE>

<HD>Deadmarsh's Injuries Are Healing</HD>

<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Sitting out nine games because of a concussion hasn't been all that
bad for Adam Deadmarsh.</LD>
<LD>   The pain in his right wrist has dissipated and the tendinitis in
his left knee has disappeared since he last played Nov. 12.</LD>
<LD>   "I don't ever want to say an injury's a blessing in disguise, but
other things have been able to heal," said Deadmarsh, who returned to
practice this week.</LD>
<TE>   "But I'd rather take those injuries back and get rid of this
concussion."</TE>
<TE>   He hopes to play Saturday night against the Columbus Blue Jackets,
as does Ian Laperriere, who has been sidelined since Nov. 23 because
of a concussion.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, defenseman Lubomir Visnovsky, who has sat out four
consecutive games and five of seven because of back spasms, suffered
a major setback when his back seized after Tuesday's practice, which
he left early.</TE>
<TE>   "I think Lubo could be out for a while," possibly as long as
several weeks, Coach Andy Murray said before Thursday night's game
against Nashville.</TE>
<TE>   Enforcer Ken Belanger, sidelined since Nov. 5 because of a
concussion, has made little progress and has not resumed skating.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Barring further injuries, the Kings will have to clear a roster
spot when Deadmarsh is activated from injured reserve. Asked what he
told veteran Steve Heinze, who was recalled last week after starting
the season in the minors, Murray said: "I haven't told him anything
about that. I just told him to work hard." Tough guy Kip Brennan
probably will be sent down before Heinze.... Craig Johnson, suffering
from stomach flu, sat out Thursday's game.</TE>

<HD>Sluggish Start Dooms Kings</HD>
<DH>Allison returns early from knee injury, but Nashville gets
two first-period goals and holds on for a 3-2 victory.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Jerry Crowe</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Kings said it was a coincidence that Jason Allison returned to
the lineup Thursday night against the Nashville Predators, the worst
team in the Western Conference during the season's first two months.</LD>
<LD>   They said they weren't looking for a patsy for their top center to
line up against in his first game since injuring his right knee Oct.
29 at Atlanta.</LD>
<LD>   And they didn't find one in the heretofore underachieving
Predators, who spoiled a spirited effort by Allison, scoring two
goals in the first 18 minutes en route to a 3-2 victory in front of
15,877 at Staples Center.</LD>
<TE>   It didn't help that Ziggy Palffy was ejected for spearing Martin
Erat late in the first period, but by then the Predators already held
a 2-0 lead.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we could have played a lot better," said Allison, who
played nearly 22 1/2 minutes, almost 10 in the third period. "They
were hungrier at the start of the game, which shouldn't have
happened, especially in our rink.</TE>
<TE>   "That was not an acceptable first period for us."</TE>
<TE>   A midday examination by team physician Ronald Kvitne cleared
Allison to play, but that doesn't mean Allison is in the lineup to
stay.</TE>
<TE>   "What we're saying right now is, he's playing tonight," Coach Andy
Murray said before the game. "We don't know if he'll play Saturday."</TE>
<TE>   For the time being, Allison's status will be reviewed daily,
depending on how his knee responds. "Obviously, nothing is 100%," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Sidelined after a knee-on-knee hit by Andy Sutton of the
Thrashers, Allison pushed to get back as soon as possible, believing
that a speedy return could be the difference in the Kings' making the
playoffs.</TE>
<TE>   The Kings didn't seem surprised. General Manager Dave Taylor said
former King defenseman Charlie Huddy suffered the same injury in the
1993 playoffs, and played three days later. Murray said Allison
wanted to play last week.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's great that he's back," Murray said of Allison, who
originally was expected to be sidelined another three to seven weeks.
"Remarkable? I don't know if I could use that term."</TE>
<TE>   The Predators, meanwhile, were without their top goaltender, Mike
Dunham, sidelined because of a groin strain. They started the game
with only four victories, fewest in the league, and only 16 points,
fewest in the West. They had lost 11 of 12 one-goal games. But they
had shown signs of improvement during a recent 2-2 home stand,
highlighted by a 5-2 victory over the Dallas Stars.</TE>
<TE>   And it took them only 2 minutes 33 seconds to score against the
Kings, Adam Hall netting a power-play goal on a shot from the right
point with Mikko Eloranta in the penalty box for hooking.</TE>
<TE>   At 17:38, Scott Walker scored into an open net after a shot from
the left point by Andy Delmore caromed off the stick of King
defenseman Mathieu Schneider. With goaltender Felix Potvin out of
position, Walker tapped the puck into the net.</TE>
<TE>   It only got worse for the Kings before the first intermission.
Palffy was ejected at 19:09, spearing Erat in retaliation for an Erat
elbow.</TE>
<TE>   But after a scoreless second period, rookie Michael Cammalleri cut
the King deficit to 2-1 early in the third on a shot from the right
circle.</TE>
<TE>   Delmore, however, scored a power-play goal on a blast from the
blue line, making the score 3-1 with Steve Heinze in the penalty box
for high-sticking.</TE>
<TE>   Allison later assisted on a power-play goal by Schneider.</TE>

<LD>Coupers First Dash, winner of the California Matron at nearly 8-1
odds this year, will try to end a four-race losing skid tonight in
the $15,000 Dashing Folly Handicap at 350 yards.</LD>
<LD>   Named for the 1996 Champion of Champions winner, the Dashing Folly
attracted eight fillies and mares and is the ninth of 10 races on the
program.</LD>
<LD>   Owned by E G High Desert Farms and trained by Concepcion
Balderrama, Coupers First Dash won the Matron by nearly two lengths
on June 22 but has not finished better than fifth in her last four
starts. She'll try a jockey change to Dennis Means in hopes of
turning things around.</LD>
<TE>   Others in the lineup include Sammies White Chick, who comes off a
one-length victory for trainer Adan Farias, Cypress Handicap winner
Rustys Quickid, First Down N Surfin and Pure Flattery.</TE>
<TE>   A Texas-bred daughter of Royal Quick Dash, Rustys Quickid has won
six of 19 and will break from the rail under leading jockey Ramon
Sanchez.</TE>
<TE>   The picks: 1. Splash For Glory. 2. My Cuz Al. 3. Corona Lil. 4. Cs
Crimson Tide. 5. Stel Corona. 6. Winner Season. 7. Amender. 8. Sheza
Ramblin Too. 9. Pure Flattery. 10. Buzzin On By.</TE>
<TE>   Four! Use Splash For Glory and He Moves in the first, Synner Or
Saint, My Cuz Al and Solongretsina in the second, Ride On Time and
Corona Lil in the third and Toute De Suite and Cs Crimson Tide in the
fourth.</TE>
<TE>   Shots in the dark: Twotimesthefly cuts back to the distance of his
last win in the fifth. Fred Too has some class and could improve on
the big drop in the seventh.</TE>

<KH>LAKERS vs. DALLAS7:30 P.M., FOX SPORTS NET, ESPN</KH>
<HD>1-Loss Wonders</HD>
<DH>Mavericks come to town with league's best record, and
struggling Lakers can't even make fun of them</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mark Heisler</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>What, us three-time defending champions, worry?</LD>
<LD>   No, of course not, there's no reason for anyone in Lakerdom to
really be concerned about the Dallas Mavericks keeping up this 17-1
stuff. Sooner or later, perhaps starting tonight, they'll go back to
something closer to last season's level (.695), in which case, to
catch them, the Lakers will have to go only ... uh ... 54-8.</LD>
<LD>   OK, maybe it's OK to worry a little, if not about the Mavericks'
start, then about the Mavericks, themselves.</LD>
<TE>   Once, no one took a Laker challenger seriously if it didn't have
two seven-foot future Hall of Famers (San Antonio) or a seven-foot
center and a 6-10 power forward (Sacramento). But now it's a wacky
new NBA world, with the launch-ready Mavericks sitting on top of it.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers, prohibitive preseason favorites, have a rotund and
mortal look, already so far back -- 11 games behind Dallas in the
West, 8 1/2 behind Sacramento in the Pacific -- that Phil Jackson
poohs-poohs the need to overhaul them.</TE>
<TE>   Not that the Mavericks have any illusions about having done
anything yet, but they can count it as a mark of respect that the
Lakers didn't dump all over them before this game, as the Lakers
would have, if they had felt like their old selves.</TE>
<TE>   New seasons mean new realities and this is the newest season we've
seen since the Lakers' three-year run started.</TE>
<TE>   "We're watching the Lakers with interest as they move through this
year," Maverick Coach Don Nelson said Thursday in his hotel suite
overlooking Marina del Rey.</TE>
<TE>   "As much as they poke fun at Sacramento, we thought Sacramento
probably should have beaten them last year in the playoffs. Probably
deserved to beat 'em and probably had 'em beat, had 'em on the ropes.
But still the Lakers won and all you can say is, 'Well, the Lakers
still won.'</TE>
<TE>   "But clearly, Sacramento was the best team in the regular season
and is the best team this year. And I don't think you'd better call
them the Queens anymore. I think you'd better pay them a little more
respect. If I were the Lakers, I would and I sure do....</TE>
<TE>   "The Lakers have a really great blend of veteran players who have
played together for a long period of time and Phil has done a
marvelous job of nursing that, making that work. But for that to
work, you've got to have Shaq in the best of shape and playing and
working together and that just takes time.</TE>
<TE>   "I would still say the Lakers are probably a better team than we
are, that it will prove itself out to be that, come playoff time or
come midseason, that they'll have all this behind them and be kicking
butt, like we would all expect them to.</TE>
<TE>   "But right now, they struggle for a bunch of reasons and mainly
because Shaq isn't in a good rhythm. Even though he's getting good
numbers, he's not in good rhythm like he was last year and there's
reasons for that ... the operation, the time off without playing, the
conditioning aspects, being sharp with his shots and quickness and
the rest of it. It's pretty obvious."</TE>
<TE>   The problems for the Lakers now are twofold: themselves and their
rivals.</TE>
<TE>   No one, even the Lakers, thinks they're better than they were.
They aspire only to be as good as they were, which used to be plenty
good enough.</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, the Mavericks and the Kings, to name two
rivals, might be a lot better.</TE>
<TE>   Sacramento's rotation players have actually lost more games to
injury or suspension -- 46 for Mike Bibby, Peja Stojakovic, Hedo
Turkoglu, Doug Christie, Vlade Divac and Keon Clark, to 36 for
Shaquille O'Neal, Rick Fox, Devean George, Robert Horry and Samaki
Walker -- but the Kings are first in the Pacific, and the Lakers are
last.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the Mavericks have learned to play an effective zone
defense, which is better than last season's, when they might as well
not have even gone back down the floor.</TE>
<TE>   They ranked 29th in defense. Then in the playoffs, according to
their own charts, they gave up an astounding 115 dunks and layups to
Sacramento in a five-game series, of which the Kings won four.</TE>
<TE>   In the pivotal Game 4, the Mavericks let Bibby, who stands only
6-1, dribble down the lane and lay the ball up for the tying basket
at the end of regulation. Then they let him drive the baseline and
lay the ball up for the winning basket in overtime.</TE>
<TE>   Had Bobby Knight been coaching them, none of the Mavericks might
have made it out of the arena alive.</TE>
<TE>   Nelson, the thinker, went to Plan B.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not stoppers individually and we need team help, whether
we're playing man-to-man or zone," he says. "I think Del Harris [his
assistant, who runs the defense] said it best: It's like a pitcher
with an 85-mph fastball, you need to throw some junk out there if
that's all you've got....</TE>
<TE>   "Right now the zone defense is ahead of the zone offense. I think
it's clear, coaches will catch up with it, find out how to attack it
better. And then we'll probably have to play more man-to-man or
combinations, but we're well aware of that."</TE>
<TE>   The Mavericks aren't usually thought of as big -- the word "soft"
comes up more frequently, as Portland's Bonzi Wells informed Nick Van
Exel -- but with 7-6 Shawn Bradley, 7-0 Dirk Nowitzki and 6-10 Raef
LaFrentz, that's a lot of hands a long way up in the air in a zone.</TE>
<TE>   The Mavericks are now 10th in scoring defense, and third in the
number the coaches look at, opponents' shooting percentage. With
their No. 1 offense, they have the No. 1 point differential, 13.3 a
game, almost doubling the 7.1 total for No. 2 Indiana.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, sterner tests await, such as tonight, when the revived,
or awakened, Bradley encounters O'Neal, who will try his famous
bulldozer-meets-stork technique.</TE>
<TE>   These have been trying times for the Lakers, which was undoubtedly
why O'Neal was moved to note they were playing with so little fire,
it was as if Harris were still coaching them.</TE>
<TE>   Actually, the Lakers owe Harris a lot for taking a 33-49 team and
improving it by 20 wins in two seasons, so Shaq would even consider
signing with them.</TE>
<TE>   It's true that Harris came up short in the title department. On
the other hand, when he was here, O'Neal cared enough to come to camp
weighing less than 350.</TE>
<TE>   Times have changed. The Lakers just hope they haven't changed too
radically, too recently.</TE>

<HD>Herndon Fined for Illegal Block</HD>

<LD>Denver Bronco guard Steve Herndon was fined one game's pay, $17,647,
by the NFL on Thursday for an illegal block on San Diego Charger
defensive tackle Jamal Williams.</LD>
<LD>   Herndon's clip came in Sunday's loss to the Chargers and ended
Williams' season.</LD>
<LD>   Herndon, a first-year guard, makes $300,000 this season.</LD>
<TE>   Herndon and Bronco Coach Mike Shanahan apologized to Williams and
the Chargers on Wednesday, the same day Williams was put on injured
reserve because of a dislocated left ankle. Williams had surgery
Monday.</TE>
<TE>   In the third quarter of San Diego's 30-27 overtime win, Williams
was hit from behind by Herndon as Williams chased Denver running back
Clinton Portis on a screen pass.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Tennessee defensive end Jevon Kearse is as close to playing as he
has been since breaking his left foot in the season opener.</TE>
<TE>   He did not practice Thursday, but Coach Jeff Fisher said Kearse
was better after running outside the last two days, which was
encouraging. The Titans (7-5) play the Indianapolis Colts (8-4)
Sunday for control of the AFC South.</TE>
<TE>   "We're going to pick it up tomorrow and see how he is," Fisher
said. "Let him work with the defense a bit, shut him down Saturday,
and he'll probably be a realistic game-time decision."</TE>
<TE>   Quarterback Steve McNair watched practice for a second straight
day. He has not practiced in nearly two weeks, and Fisher said he
hopes McNair can practice some today.</TE>
<TE>   McNair had the second-best performance of his career last week in
a 32-29 overtime victory over the New York Giants despite sore ribs,
a sore shin and turf toe. McNair completed 30 of 43 passes for 334
yards and three touchdowns.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Tampa Bay wide receiver Keyshawn Johnson filed for a divorce from
his wife, Shikiri, citing irreconcilable differences.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson, 30, and his wife separated Sept. 2, according to the
filing Tuesday in Los Angeles Superior Court.</TE>
<TE>   The former USC star and his wife were married on Feb. 14, 1998.
They have a daughter, Maia, 6, and a son, Keyshawn, 4.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Miami quarterback Ray Lucas and defensive end Rob Burnett were
held out of practice because of injuries but are expected to be
available against the Chicago Bears.</TE>
<TE>   Lucas, who has a strained shoulder after suffering a stinger in
Sunday's loss to the Buffalo Bills, sat out practice for the second
straight day.</TE>
<TE>   Coach Dave Wannstedt said Lucas will practice today and is
expected to be the No. 2 quarterback behind starter Jay Fiedler on
Monday night.</TE>
<TE>   As a precaution, the Dolphins signed quarterback Dave Dickenson to
the practice squad.</TE>

<HD>Penalty Shot in OT Gives Flyers a Win</HD>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Michal Handzus became the second player in NHL history to score an
overtime goal on a penalty shot when he beat New York's Dan Blackburn
with 36.7 seconds left in overtime Thursday night in the Philadelphia
Flyers' 3-2 victory over the Rangers at Philadelphia.</LD>
<LD>   "Back home we don't play overtime, so it was a first," said
Handzus, who grew up in Slovakia and came to the Flyers last summer
as part of the deal that sent goaltender Brian Boucher to Phoenix.</LD>
<LD>   Handzus, who was taken down from behind by defenseman Tom Poti,
faked a forehand shot, then went to his backhand before lifting a
shot over Blackburn's left pad.</LD>
<TE>   Handzus joined Nashville's David Legwand as the only players to
score with an overtime penalty shot. Legwand also beat the Rangers on
Dec. 23, 2000, in New York. That goal was scored against backup
goalie Kirk McLean.</TE>
<TE>   Detroit 5, Phoenix 3 -- Darren McCarty and Brendan Shanahan scored
in the game's first 97 seconds at Phoenix as the Red Wings continued
their dominance of the Coyotes.</TE>
<TE>   The Red Wings are unbeaten in their last 10 games against Phoenix
(6-0-4).</TE>
<TE>   Calgary 1, Minnesota 1 -- Roman Turek stopped 34 shots for the
Flames at Calgary, Canada.</TE>
<TE>   Turek's biggest save came in overtime when he stopped Sergei
Zholtok on a breakaway with about two minutes remaining.</TE>
<TE>   St. Louis 2, Ottawa 2 -- Marian Hossa scored on his own rebound
with 1:06 left in regulation as the Senators capitalized on a late
power play at St. Louis.</TE>
<TE>   Hossa scored his 16th of the season after Fred Brathwaite stopped
his shot from the point. The left side of the net was wide open for
Hossa's backhand rebound.</TE>
<TE>   Boston 4, Atlanta 3 -- Glen Murray scored his 16th goal of the
season at 1:53 of overtime at Boston to spoil the return of goalie
Byron Dafoe.</TE>
<TE>   Dafoe (2-2-0) made 36 saves in his first start against the Bruins
since signing with Atlanta on Nov. 20.</TE>
<TE>   Tampa Bay 3, Edmonton 2 -- Ruslan Fedotenko scored the tiebreaking
goal with three minutes left in the third period at Tampa, Fla.</TE>
<TE>   Before the game, the Lightning learned Dave Andreychuk will be out
four weeks because of a hairline fracture of the big toe on his right
foot.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Chicago's Theo Fleury was cleared to return to the NHL after the
completion of his suspension for violating the league's substance
abuse aftercare program. The 34-year-old Fleury was suspended
indefinitely, just two days before the start of the regular season,
but now is set to make his debut with the Blackhawks tonight against
the Mighty Ducks.... Joe Sakic, Rob Blake and Patrick Roy of the
Colorado Avalanche are in line to start for the Western Conference
All-Star team in early voting announced Thursday. San Jose's Teemu
Selanne and Dallas' Brett Hull lead the wingers. Nicklas Lidstrom of
Detroit is the top defenseman and leading vote-getter in the Western
Conference. Voting ends Dec. 31.</TE>

<LD>No. 7 WASHINGTON STATE (9-2)</LD>
<LD>   at UCLA (7-4)</LD>
<LD>   Kickoff: 1:30 p.m.</LD>
<TE>   TV: Channel 7.</TE>
<TE>   Line: Washington State by 2 1/2.</TE>
<TE>   Washington State update: A Washington State win puts the Cougars
in the Rose Bowl game. Despite a high ankle sprain, quarterback Jason
Gesser is taking snaps in practice. Coach Mike Price contends he
won't name a starter until game day, but Gesser says he'll play.</TE>
<TE>   UCLA update: Fan uprising over the 52-21 loss to USC hasn't
quieted even though USC demolished Notre Dame in similar fashion.</TE>
<TE>   Story line: USC is looking for a UCLA victory to put the Trojans
in the Rose Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   The pick: Washington State. If Gesser's history is any indication,
he'll not only play hurt, he'll put the Cougars in the Granddaddy of
Them All.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   No. 18 VIRGINIA TECH (9-3)</TE>
<TE>   at No. 1 MIAMI (11-0)</TE>
<TE>   Kickoff: 10 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   TV: Channel 7.</TE>
<TE>   Line: Miami by 18.</TE>
<TE>   Virginia Tech update: The Hokies -- once thought to be national
championship contenders -- fell by the wayside with three consecutive
losses, but managed to beat Virginia last week.</TE>
<TE>   Miami update: The Hurricanes won't be napping for this one. Last
season, Miami held on for a 26-24 victory to reach the national
championship game only after Virginia Tech failed on a two-point
conversion.</TE>
<TE>   Story line: Miami could lose to Virginia Tech and still play for
the national championship in the Fiesta Bowl if it managed not to
fall below No. 2 in the BCS standings.</TE>
<TE>   The pick: Miami. Virginia Tech lost its credibility with losses to
Pittsburgh, Syracuse and West Virginia.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   No. 4 GEORGIA (11-1)</TE>
<TE>   vs. No. 22 ARKANSAS (9-3)</TE>
<TE>   What: SEC championship at Atlanta.</TE>
<TE>   Kickoff: 3 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   TV: Channel 2.</TE>
<TE>   Line: Georgia by 8.</TE>
<TE>   Georgia update: The Miami game earlier in the day will determine
whether Georgia has any hope of moving into the top two in the BCS
standings.</TE>
<TE>   Arkansas update: Alabama's NCAA probation helped propel Arkansas
into the SEC title game as the West division winner by default.</TE>
<TE>   Story line: At stake, the SEC's automatic bid to one of the BCS
bowls.</TE>
<TE>   The pick: Georgia. Matt Jones, the Arkansas quarterback, was money
on a game-winning drive against Louisiana State, but before the final
drive he completed two of 13 passes for 46 yards.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   No. 12 COLORADO (9-3)</TE>
<TE>   vs. No. 8 OKLAHOMA (10-2)</TE>
<TE>   What: Big 12 championship at Houston.</TE>
<TE>   Kickoff: 5 p.m.</TE>
<TE>   TV: Channel 7.</TE>
<TE>   Line: Oklahoma by 7.</TE>
<TE>   Colorado update: Running back Chris Brown has been ruled out of
the game because of a severely bruised sternum, and Bobby Purify is
doubtful because of a high ankle sprain. Still, reserve Brian Calhoun
did fine with 137 yards against Nebraska.</TE>
<TE>   Oklahoma update: A loss to rival Oklahoma State cost the Sooners
dearly, ending any chance of playing for the national championship.</TE>
<TE>   Story line: A rematch of Oklahoma's 27-11 victory over Colorado
Nov. 2 for the Big 12's automatic BCS bowl bid.</TE>
<TE>   The pick: Oklahoma. With Brown and Purify injured, Oklahoma
figures to win again.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   ARMY (1-10)</TE>
<TE>   vs. NAVY (1-10)</TE>
<TE>   Where: at East Rutherford, N.J.</TE>
<TE>   Kickoff: 9 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   TV: Channel 2.</TE>
<TE>   Line: Navy by 3.</TE>
<TE>   Army update: The Black Knights' only victory was a 14-10 win over
Tulane, which defeated Navy, 51-30. Army ranks 104th nationally in
turnover margin and Navy is 115th.</TE>
<TE>   Navy update: The 30-23 loss to Notre Dame was the highlight of
another dreadful season. Navy won its opener against Southern
Methodist, 38-7, but hasn't won since.</TE>
<TE>   Story line: The records are awful, but the classic pageantry of
the 103rd Army-Navy game begins with the march-on of the Corps of
Cadets followed by the Brigade of Midshipmen.</TE>
<TE>   The pick: Army. Pull for a good finish. Seven of the last 10
Army-Navy games have been decided in the final minute, with Army
winning six.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   TOLEDO (9-3)</TE>
<TE>   at MARSHALL (9-2)</TE>
<TE>   What: MAC championship.</TE>
<TE>   Kickoff: 11:30 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   TV: ESPN2.</TE>
<TE>   Line: Marshall by 4 1/2.</TE>
<TE>   Toledo update: Brian Jones threw for three touchdowns and Trinity
Dawson ran for three in a 42-24 victory over Bowling Green last week
that clinched the West division title.</TE>
<TE>   Marshall update: Byron Leftwich is worth watching for drama alone.
Besides his Willis Reed moment earlier this season when teammates
carried the injured quarterback downfield for the next play, he
passed for 401 yards last week despite limping on a sore left shin.</TE>
<TE>   Story line: Marshall already accepted an invitation to play in the
GMAC Bowl Dec. 18 in Mobile, Ala.</TE>
<TE>   The pick: Marshall. Because the Thundering Herd has the lumbering
Leftwich.</TE>

<HD>Surfers Find Beauty and Beast in Jaws</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PETE THOMAS</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Early on the morning of Nov. 26, the monster called Jaws rose from
its slumber and snarled and hissed as it rarely has before. It was a
display of nature both ominous and magnificent, amid which was a
display of courage and athleticism to rival that in any other
sporting arena.</LD>
<LD>   "The day was off the charts," said Laird Hamilton, a Kauai
resident and the preeminent tamer of Maui's wildest and most
notorious beast. "I would say I rode maybe 100 waves, but for sure 50
or 60. That's enough to last most people a winter."</LD>
<LD>   Jaws, for those unaware, is a remote surf break off northern Maui,
which produces some of the largest and most powerful waves on earth,
waves so big and fast that the only way to catch them is to get towed
onto them, by a jet-powered personal watercraft, before they start
breaking.</LD>
<TE>   Those who ride Jaws -- who actually carve hard turns on its sheer
and towering faces and bravely pull into its cavernous, grinding
tubes -- are an elite group of tow-surfing veterans who have mastered
their art, and the fickle nuances of the wickedly hollow break,
through countless hours of trial and error.</TE>
<TE>   The elite among this daredevil crowd -- Hamilton, Darrick Doerner
and Dave Kalama, to name a few -- are the ones who stood out on "Big
Tuesday," when wave faces exceeded 50 feet. They were the ones who
always seemed to be in the prime position, whether on boards
specially fitted with foot straps, or on jet-skis, which serve as
both tow and rescue vessels.</TE>
<TE>   They were the ones who made surfing Jaws look easy, which of
course it isn't. As some found out the hard way.</TE>
<TE>   Jaws chewed up and spat out three or four jet-skis, leaving them
in splinters on the rocky beach. One surfer suffered a broken leg,
another ruptured an eardrum. More than a few "touched bottom," as
Hamilton said, receiving various cuts and bruises.</TE>
<TE>   "There was more carnage than I've seen on any other day out
there," Hamilton added.</TE>
<TE>   In the middle to upper echelon were Mike Parsons and Brad Gerlach,
of San Clemente and Cardiff by the Sea, respectively. Though
experienced on big waves, and proven tow-surfing stars elsewhere,
they were relatively new to Jaws and it showed.</TE>
<TE>   "It was really challenging because we both had wipeouts and spent
a lot of time looking for our boards on the rocks," Gerlach said,
adding that they struggled in part because their boards were too long
and not quite maneuverable enough.</TE>
<TE>   Gerlach had never experienced a water bomb quite like the one that
exploded at his heels, burying him beneath a mountain of whitewater,
ripping his feet from his straps and sending him shoreward in a
horizontal avalanche that seemed to have no end.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't get out of it until it's basically done with you," he
said. "My first thought was that I'm not going to worry about it
until I feel I can't breathe anymore. So I kept my eyes shut and kept
twirling around underwater ... and twirling and twirling. I don't
know how long it was but time stood still for a while."</TE>
<TE>   He eventually surfaced, only to have another wall of water sweep
over him. Then another. Finally, he was picked up and whisked away by
"some guy" on a jet-ski.</TE>
<TE>   Australian pro Cheyne Horan took a horrific tumble during which,
"I was hit so many times I thought to myself, 'I'm going to die
here,' " he said during an interview in the Gold Coast Bulletin. "My
body went numb and limp. I was seeing stars and felt as though I was
on the other side, like I had died."</TE>
<TE>   That nobody died is perhaps the most surprising thing. Jaws,
fronted by a sheer and towering cliff, is not a public beach and has
no lifeguard presence. The nearest launching point is three miles
away and it's up to the surfers and their jet-ski partners to take
care of themselves.</TE>
<TE>   With so many newcomers this year -- there were about 20 teams in
all on Big Tuesday -- veterans such as Hamilton fear there will be
deaths sooner or later, and that the government will respond by
trying to restrict or even ban the activity.</TE>
<TE>   "If somebody gets killed, I suppose they could make it illegal and
start arresting people," Hamilton said. "But to arrest people, they'd
need enforcement officers who are willing to go out there and
actually arrest people. I'd hate to see it come to that."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Bill Sharp, director of the Billabong Odyssey and Billabong XXL
Big-Wave Awards -- the former an ongoing adventure and the latter a
seasonal contest rewarding the surfer who negotiates the biggest wave
anywhere -- said Jaws had produced the early front-runners.</TE>
<TE>   The problem for the judges, however, will be determining who at
Jaws rode the biggest wave.</TE>
<TE>   "During most great surf sessions, there are one or two giant waves
that everyone remembers," Sharp said. "At Jaws, there were probably
150 waves at 50 feet-plus. It'll be like a Miss America pageant where
we have 50 beautiful contenders. The debate will go on all winter."</TE>

<TE>   The DVD "Strapped: The Origins of Tow-in Surfing" has reached
mainstream markets. It chronicles the growth and development of the
sport through the exploits of pioneers Hamilton, Kalama, Doerner,
Rush Randle, Pete Cabrinha, Brett Lickle, Mark Angulo and Buzzy
Kerbox. Cost is $24.95 for the DVD and $19.95 for the VHS.</TE>

<TE>   The poaching case involving Jon Michael Hand of Downey, arrested
last spring for the illegal sale of 1,194 sport-caught lobsters, was
settled this week. Hand, who sold the crustaceans in the parking lot
of a Southland hospital, pleaded guilty to one count of unlawful take
and possession and one count of unlawful sale of sport-caught fish.</TE>
<TE>   He was fined $5,435 and ordered to pay $18,000 as restitution to
the state to cover costs of a lengthy Department of Fish and Game
surveillance effort leading to the arrest.</TE>
<TE>   Hand also was put on probation for three years, meaning he cannot
fish or be in the presence of anyone fishing during that period. The
DFG is hoping such substantial penalties will serve as a deterrent to
others.</TE>
<TE>   Counting Whales</TE>
<TE>   A few California gray whales have already been seen off the
Southland coast, traveling south to Baja California's lagoons, and
the annual migration will begin seriously in the coming weeks.</TE>
<TE>   An associated rite of winter is the Los Angeles Chapter of the
American Cetacean Society's long-term Gray Whale Census and Behavior
Project at Point Fermin on the Palos Verdes Peninsula.</TE>
<TE>   When the volunteer monitoring program began another season on
Sunday, volunteers saw no grays but two fin whales, second only to
blue whales in size, measuring to about 75 feet. Later in the day
they saw two humpback whales.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday they saw no whales but logged sightings of several
dolphins.</TE>
<TE>   Program Director Alisa Schulman-Janiger said the season was off to
a lively start. Unofficial sightings over the last few weeks have
included gray whales, humpbacks, blues, fin whales and dolphins.</TE>
<TE>   More volunteers are needed and anyone interested may call
Schulman-Janiger at (310) 519-8963, or e-mail her at
janiger@bcf.usc.edu.</TE>

<TE>   * Cabo San Lucas: Nick Zebrowsky, 15, La Canada, caught a
500-pound blue marlin after an hourlong fight aboard the Andrea. At
the scale, the crew noticed a tail in the mouth of the billfish,
tugged and out came a 33-pound wahoo.</TE>
<TE>   * Long Lake (Arizona): Branislav Djuric, Mesa, Ariz., reeled in a
northern pike weighing 29.86 pounds. If approved by the Arizona Game
and Fish Department, it'll become a state record. Djuric's secret: a
special pike lure resembling a small fish brought from his home
country, Bosnia-Herzegovina.</TE>
<TE>   * Paulina Lake (Oregon): Ronald L. Lane, Olancha, Calif., has had
his catch of a 28-pound 5-ounce brown trout certified as an Oregon
record. Lane claims to have bagged 13 brown trout topping 10 pounds
and two topping 20.</TE>
<TE>   Miller Time</TE>
<TE>   It wouldn't be another ski season without a new Warren Miller
film. His latest, "Storm," is making the Southern California rounds
with 8 p.m. showings. The schedule: Tonight at Pasadena Civic Center;
Saturday at Wadsworth Theater in Brentwood; Sunday at Artists Theater
in Laguna Beach (at 5 and 8); Tuesday at Orange County Performing
Arts Center in Costa Mesa, and Thursday at Redondo Beach High.</TE>

<LD>The best basketball teacher in Los Angeles is smiling.</LD>
<LD>   This is so unusual, you listen closely as he strolls past three of
his players outside a winning postgame news conference.</LD>
<LD>   "Did you hear all those nice things I said about you in there?" he
asks them.</LD>
<TE>   They look at each other, kick the floor, shrug.</TE>
<TE>   "Hope you enjoyed it," he says, walking away. "You never know when
you're going to hear it again."</TE>
<TE>   The best basketball teacher in Los Angeles coaches a struggling
team, for a shadowed program, in a dowdy gym, in front of fans
sometimes outnumbered by the band.</TE>
<TE>   Yet Henry Bibby concedes nothing.</TE>
<TE>   "This is my kind of place," says USC's coach. "It's about
building. It's about teaching. It's about growing."</TE>
<TE>   This winter, once again, it's about Henry Bibby against the world,
and what an interesting fight.</TE>
<TE>   After consecutive 20-win seasons, it was supposed to be easier.
But it has gotten harder. And Bibby has gotten tougher.</TE>
<TE>   Coaching a team whose best players are precocious underclassmen,
he has already sent a passel of them to the woodshed.</TE>
<TE>   "You'd think these players would understand me by now," he says, a
twinkle in his eye.</TE>
<TE>   His team playing a schedule that includes three difficult
nonconference road games, he has already claimed that one road loss
was fixed.</TE>
<TE>   "How can I get in trouble for speaking the truth?" he asks.</TE>
<TE>   Coaching at a school where the spotlight is on football, in a gym
where lights sometimes flicker, in a town where he's forever the
other guy, he makes no excuses.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't talk about any of that stuff," Bibby says. "We are who
we are."</TE>
<TE>   What they are is a throwback program surviving in a town that
doesn't look or feel anything like them.</TE>
<TE>   You've heard of Showtime? This year at USC, it's Old-time.</TE>
<TE>   Like many other coaches, Bibby had a Midnight Madness workout this
fall to mark the official start of practice, an event traditionally
highlighted by a Trojan streetball scrimmage.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike others, though, Bibby suddenly stopped the running and
gunning by calling a timeout.</TE>
<TE>   Around 12:30 a.m.</TE>
<TE>   The latest timeout in school history.</TE>
<TE>   "These kids are crying out for discipline, can't you see that?"
says Bibby. "I try to give it to them. I don't want them to make the
same mistakes I made."</TE>
<TE>   Like many, Bibby has a team that could be marked, "Handle With
Care." But unlike others, Bibby refuses to coddle, instead using
playing time as parents once used the switch.</TE>
<TE>   Brandon Brooks, Jerry Dupree, Errick Craven, Derrick Craven and
Rory O'Neil have all missed time with punitive benchings or
suspensions.</TE>
<TE>   And the team has played only four games.</TE>
<TE>   "It's love, the way I look at it. Tough love."</TE>
<TE>   That quote isn't from Bibby. It's from Don Matlock.</TE>
<TE>   He is the stepfather of the Craven twins. He had just driven to
the Sports Arena through Notre Dame traffic last Saturday to watch
his sons and their teammates play Morris Brown.</TE>
<TE>   Yet one of them, Errick, the team's leading returning scorer, sat
on the bench the entire game because he'd violated a team rule.</TE>
<TE>   And it wasn't the first time.</TE>
<TE>   In the season opener against UC Riverside, both Errick and Derrick
missed much of the first half because they had arrived five minutes
late for the pregame meeting.</TE>
<TE>   Matlock and wife Sonya Craven couldn't be happier.</TE>
<TE>   "Coach Bibby is tough, but he's fair, and he's teaching them to be
young men," says Sonya. "This is why we are here."</TE>
<TE>   And after seven years' worth of benchings and scoldings and sweat,
this is why the Bibby way still works.</TE>
<TE>   The kids may not like it, but the parents love it.</TE>
<TE>   "Because once [the players] arrive here, I feel it is my duty to
act as their parents," says Bibby. "It's about more than wins or
losses. We're trying to teach them to grow up here."</TE>
<TE>   With every suspension or benching, Bibby asks the player to call
his parents and tell them.</TE>
<TE>   "I want them to soften the blow," he says.</TE>
<TE>   Then, Bibby calls the parents and invites them to his office to
deliver the news personally.</TE>
<TE>   "We all sit around my desk, the parents and the student, and we
talk about how we can fix the problem," Bibby says. "The student
knows that I'm not acting on my own, but on behalf of everyone."</TE>
<TE>   When there's no time for a meeting, such as the middle of last
year's stunning loss to UNC-Wilmington in the first round of the NCAA
tournament, Bibby goes with his NBA instincts.</TE>
<TE>   In this case, it was to bench star David Bluthenthal for a long
stretch, even though the move might have cost him the game.</TE>
<TE>   You know, Henry, those of us who projected your team to reach the
Final Four, we're still wondering ... why?</TE>
<TE>   "He was playing terrible, that's why," Bibby says. "He wasn't
playing defense. We even had one of our leaders come up to me,
Brandon Granville, and beg me to take David out of the game until he
got his head together."</TE>
<TE>   But did you have to put in football player Gregg Guenther?</TE>
<TE>   "Gregg was playing harder at the time, more physical, and deserved
the opportunity," Bibby says. "That's what my program is all about.
If you work hard, you will get a chance. And if you don't, you
won't."</TE>
<TE>   When USC plays 15th-ranked Missouri on Saturday at the Pond in the
Wooden Classic, it could get ugly. But the Trojans will play defense,
and they will play hard, or they will not play.</TE>
<TE>   Bibby's teams never make you regret the cost of your seat.</TE>
<TE>   Or, as local beat reporters learned, he is always worth the price
of a plane ticket.</TE>
<TE>   None of them made the flight to Rhode Island for the team's first
road game, another sign that USC basketball still isn't taken quite
seriously.</TE>
<TE>   They missed what will surely be one of college basketball's
craziest finishes of the year, with USC losing in overtime, despite
having taken its final shot while cheerleaders and fans and bench
players danced around them on the floor.</TE>
<TE>   Bibby tried to protest the game, and later argued that the result
shouldn't count.</TE>
<TE>   "It was wrong, everyone knows it was wrong, and I'm going to keep
saying it was wrong," Bibby says. "It was all set up for Rhode Island
to win, and that's what happened."</TE>
<TE>   But nobody east of the Harbor Freeway was listening. With
home-conference referees working the first game in Rhode Island's new
home arena, he never had a chance.</TE>
<TE>   "I know," Bibby says. "So? Does that mean I shouldn't speak up?"</TE>
<TE>   Of course he should. Leave it to his colleagues to scheme and
preen and stay politically correct. The best basketball teacher in
Los Angeles teaches.</TE>

<HD>Arledge in 'Another League'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LARRY STEWART</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>One of Roone Arledge's closest friends was Ed Hookstratten, the
powerful Beverly Hills broadcast agent whose clientele includes Tom
Brokaw, Vin Scully, Dick Enberg and many more of their ilk.</LD>
<LD>   Arledge, the former ABC Sports and ABC News president, died
Thursday at 71 of complications from cancer. Hookstratten knew him as
well as anyone.</LD>
<LD>   "There are certain people who play in another league,"
Hookstratten said. "Sandy Koufax played baseball in another league.
Vin Scully has always been in another league as a baseball announcer.</LD>
<TE>   "Roone Arledge was one of those people who was in another league.
He was the finest TV executive I ever dealt with. He had an eye for
talent second to none."</TE>
<TE>   Hookstratten represented Don Meredith during the heyday of "Monday
Night Football." Hookstratten said Arledge, as a negotiator, was a
good listener. He could be firm, Hookstratten said, but he did not
describe Arledge as tough.</TE>
<TE>   "We never had a serious problem," he said.</TE>
<TE>   He described Arledge as a loyal friend who in turn had many loyal
friends. Frank Gifford might have been his closest.</TE>
<TE>   "Roone and I were playing golf one day and he asked me if I'd seen
Frank lately," Hookstratten said. "He then told me what a good friend
Frank was.</TE>
<TE>   "I remember him saying, 'If I were ever down and out and in real
trouble and could only call one person, I'd make that call to Frank
Gifford.' "</TE>
<TE>   Another loyal friend was Don Ohlmeyer.</TE>
<TE>   "Roone changed two industries -- sports television and news
television -- and both for the better," Ohlmeyer said. "All of us who
worked for him owe him a debt of gratitude for what he taught us and
for his inspiration. He taught us to always have an inquisitive
mind."</TE>
<TE>   BCS Ideal for ABC</TE>
<TE>   The bowl championship series has created chaos, confusion and
controversy in college football.</TE>
<TE>   And ABC loves it.</TE>
<TE>   "Controversy isn't such a bad thing," said Loren Matthews, the
senior vice president of programming for ABC Sports. "If there was no
controversy, it would be a sign of lack of interest, and we don't
want that."</TE>
<TE>   There certainly won't be a lack of interest in ABC's national
tripleheader Saturday. College football fans everywhere, seeking
order in their world, will be watching.</TE>
<TE>   Things start off with No. 1 Miami playing host to Virginia Tech at
10 a.m., followed by No. 7 Washington State playing UCLA at the Rose
Bowl at 1:30 p.m. Then at 5 p.m. it's Oklahoma and Colorado in the
Big 12 championship game.</TE>
<TE>   "It's just terrific the way things worked out," Matthews said.</TE>
<TE>   BCS, Pro and Con</TE>
<TE>   Matthews actually likes the BCS.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the best system we've had to date," he said. "At the end of
the day, nobody has ever quibbled about the eventual national
champion."</TE>
<TE>   Matthews says what he likes best about the BCS is the importance
it puts on the regular season.</TE>
<TE>   "Every team is playing for its BCS life from the opening kickoff
of the opening weekend," he said. "With, say, a 16-team playoff,
you'd be rendering the regular season comparatively meaningless,
which is what happened in college basketball. In college football,
every week these kids aren't playing for a seeding, they're playing
for survival."</TE>
<TE>   Keith Jackson, however, is not a BCS proponent. What Jackson
advocates when ABC's contract with the BCS expires after the 2005
season is a return to the old bowl system, plus the addition of a
four-team playoff.</TE>
<TE>   "The bowls provide money for a lot of schools and festivals for a
lot of cities, so keep them in place," the longtime announcer said.
"Have your playoffs after the bowl games, but limit it to four
teams."</TE>
<TE>   Jackson today will receive the Chick Hearn Award for broadcasting
at the Pasadena Quarterback Club's year-end awards luncheon at
Brookside golf course. Marge Hearn will present the award. The
luncheon is open to the public. Admission is $20.</TE>
<TE>   A Wright Move</TE>
<TE>   Ben Wright, of all people, thinks he may have a solution to all
the fuss over Augusta National not having any female members.</TE>
<TE>   Wright, who in 1995 said lesbianism was hurting the LPGA Tour,
suggests that Augusta chairman Hootie Johnson announce that his club
would like to stage a women's Masters.</TE>
<TE>   "I think all this talk would go into the background," he said by
phone Thursday. "It seems to me, this has all gotten out of hand, all
this screaming and shouting at each other. It's absolutely
unbelievable."</TE>
<TE>   Wright, whose comments about lesbianism and the ensuing fallout
cost him his job with CBS, returns to television for the first time
Wednesday at 6 p.m. when the Golf Channel televises the first World
Club Championship, taped the first week in October at the Club of
Nine Bridges on Jeju Island, South Korea.</TE>
<TE>   Wright will serve as the host of the Terry Jastrow production.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll be forever indebted to Terry for giving me this
opportunity," Wright said.</TE>
<TE>   The amateur event brings together 18 teams consisting of a club
pro and a member from the top private clubs in the world, including a
team from the L.A. Country Club. Eddie Merrin, the famed pro from
Bel-Air, is the tournament chairman.</TE>
<TE>   Worthy Broadcaster</TE>
<TE>   Being a Laker superstar certainly opened some doors in
broadcasting for James Worthy. But give him credit, Worthy has proven
to be a worthy broadcaster. His work on Channel 9's "LTV" pregame
shows with Alan Massengale has been outstanding, and he continues to
improve .</TE>
<TE>   "It's always a learning experience," he said. "Each year, you look
at more tape and more ways to get better."</TE>
<TE>   Saturday, Worthy will be working as a commentator with
play-by-play announcer Bob Neal on Channel 9's coverage of the Wooden
Classic at the Arrowhead Pond. California and Georgia meet in the
first game, then USC and Missouri square off in the second game.</TE>
<TE>   Short Waves</TE>
<TE>   For the first time this season, a Laker telecast on Fox Sports Net
will go up against a Laker telecast on ESPN. Hoping to lure viewers,
Fox Sports Net will have a special one-hour pregame show at 6:30,
with Bill Macdonald and Reggie Theus.... It will be a busy weekend
for Macdonald, who will do play-by-play on Pepperdine and UCLA
basketball games Saturday and Sunday.... Macdonald's always
entertaining "Sports Roundtable," which has been on Fox Sports Net 2
since 1997, is being canceled. The last show will be Dec. 16,
although there will be replays after that.</TE>
<TE>   The Lakers' Samaki Walker showed up at the KSPN (1110) studios
unannounced Thursday at 5 p.m. and went on with Joe McDonnell and
Doug Krikorian to defend the Lakers.... TNT has today's second round
of the Target World Challenge, featuring Tiger Woods. NBC will cover
the final two rounds from Sherwood Country Club in Thousand Oaks....
The Golf Channel will provide coverage of the PGA Tour Qualifying
Tournament known as Q-school Saturday and Sunday at 1:30 p.m. The
final round at PGA West in La Quinta Monday will be televised at 4:30
p.m.</TE>
<TE>   In Closing</TE>
<TE>   The big news at NBC Sports this week was an announcement that the
network would televise the national curling championships in March
and the world curling championships in April. Maybe the XFL wasn't
such bad programming after all.</TE>

<HD>For Cougars, 'The Game' Will Decide Their Legacy</HD>

<LD>The Punch. The Call. The Ankle. The Game.</LD>
<LD>   They could be remembered as the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse
for Washington State.</LD>
<LD>   The Punch threatened team unity, but a swift and creative response
by Coach Mike Price averted a disaster.</LD>
<TE>   The Call became a convenient scapegoat for a meltdown against a
rival, and its effect lingers because Price's response was something
less than swift and creative.</TE>
<TE>   The Ankle belongs to quarterback Jason Gesser and is severely
sprained, jeopardizing the Cougar season. The indomitable senior has
gone to great lengths to play -- from Pullman, Wash., to Seattle on a
midnight drive for a special brace -- but it is unclear if he can be
effective.</TE>
<TE>   The Game will be played Saturday against UCLA, determining whether
the seventh-ranked Cougars gain a berth in the Rose Bowl or the
Holiday Bowl. The difference is worth about $1.5 million to each
Pacific 10 Conference team, since they share in the bowl championship
series bounty, and a tidy sum to Price, who because of incentives in
the contract he signed in September would net an extra $125,000.</TE>
<TE>   That's not all. The outcome affects the bowl destinations of more
than a dozen other teams.</TE>
<TE>   Even though the Cougars literally are practicing in a bubble this
week, having moved to their temperature-controlled indoor facility
with Pasadena on their minds, they are aware of the far-reaching
ramifications.</TE>
<TE>   But the Game is intensely personal to Washington State. A victory
would render meaningless the misery associated with the Punch, the
Call and the Ankle.</TE>
<TE>   The Punch</TE>
<TE>   Cougar linebacker Ira Davis believed cornerback Jason David was
moving in on his girlfriend, so in the locker room on Oct. 29, Davis
cold-cocked David with one punch, fracturing his cheek in three
places.</TE>
<TE>   David went from a vocal senior leader who ranked third in the
nation in interceptions to fuming in silence from the sidelines.
Davis apologized to the team, but the damage was done -- David was
expected to miss the rest of the season.</TE>
<TE>   "When [Davis] was talking, I was so mad, I couldn't even really
hear what he was saying," safety Erik Coleman told the Spokane
Spokesman-Review.</TE>
<TE>   No charges were filed, but Price came up with a punishment to fit
the crime, suspending Davis for as long as David was out.</TE>
<TE>   That turned out to be only three games, two of them victories. The
Cougars survived the prolific Arizona State and Oregon passing
attacks without the two starters, but lost to Washington.</TE>
<TE>   David, who has five interceptions, will return to the lineup
Saturday. Davis will play too, although he will come off the bench.</TE>
<TE>   "It just feels good to finally be back," David said. "Being with
the team again feels good. Having the pads on feels good. It's
probably the greatest thing ever."</TE>
<TE>   Credit Price with defusing the situation before it caused
dissension or a media circus, an easier task in the remote Pullman
Palouse than in, say, Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   It wasn't the first Washington State incident kept relatively
quiet, either.</TE>
<TE>   Defensive tackle Rien Long, an All-American and Outland Trophy
finalist, was one of two players suspended for one game after getting
caught drinking on the return flight from Ohio State in September.</TE>
<TE>   The Call</TE>
<TE>   In Price's view, there was nothing fair about the way the Apple
Cup ended Nov. 23.</TE>
<TE>   Officials ruled that a batted-down pass by Cougar reserve
quarterback Matt Kegel was a lateral, rather than a forward pass,
making it a game-ending fumble instead of a harmless incompletion.</TE>
<TE>   Washington escaped with a 29-26 triple-overtime victory and
enraged Cougar supporters rained plastic bottles on Washington fans
who stormed the field in Pullman. Police had to intervene.</TE>
<TE>   "We won't forget this game for a long time," Price said afterward.</TE>
<TE>   Not even on Thanksgiving.</TE>
<TE>   "A 12-inch pass takes us out of the Rose Bowl?" he said on the
holiday. "That's not going to happen. I'm not going to allow a man's
decision, an inaccurate call, to deter us from our goal of going to
the Rose Bowl."</TE>
<TE>   Another week has come and gone. Pac-10 officials reviewed the play
and determined the correct call was made. Still, Price can't let it
go.</TE>
<TE>   "I hate to see that happen, it wasn't right," he said. "I think
the kids are over the hangover from that play. I'll get past it, but
I'll never forget it."</TE>
<TE>   The Ankle</TE>
<TE>   Gesser has passed for 2,922 yards and 25 touchdowns this season.
He passed for 3,010 yards and 26 touchdowns last season.</TE>
<TE>   But the 290 miles he drove Sunday night might be the most
important number the senior has racked up.</TE>
<TE>   Fog canceled flights out of Pullman, so Gesser and trainer Bill
Drake drove to a prosthetic laboratory in Seattle to have a brace,
called an ankle-foot orthosis, cast from a mold of the quarterback's
foot.</TE>
<TE>   "There are a lot of devices out there and a lot of tape jobs that
we could do, but this is custom to his foot," Drake said. "We are
trying to prevent rotation, and this is the best one we can get that
fits the foot."</TE>
<TE>   Gesser returned to practice Tuesday and has done a fair imitation
of Joe Namath, circa 1977 with the Rams, showing little mobility but
making strong throws from the shotgun.</TE>
<TE>   "It hurts doing certain things, it's stiff doing certain things,"
he said. "You've got to adjust on how to throw and how to move and
stuff like that."</TE>
<TE>   Kegel, a 6-foot-5, 239-pound junior, is highly regarded, despite a
poor performance against Washington. He's also confident.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm going to take this team to the promised land," he said. "You
are going to see a prepared Matt Kegel if I get the start down at
UCLA."</TE>
<TE>   Gesser has the same plan.</TE>
<TE>   "I felt like I was going to play two weeks ago," he said, "and I
still feel like I'm going to play now."</TE>
<TE>   The Game</TE>
<TE>   Price and UCLA Coach Bob Toledo can be jovial jokesters who temper
their intensity with folksy perspective.</TE>
<TE>   Lately, the approach is playing better in Pullman than in
Westwood.</TE>
<TE>   Toledo acknowledges that UCLA (7-4) might have to upset Washington
State for him to return for an eighth season.</TE>
<TE>   Price is under no such pressure, but losing to UCLA would cement
this as a season of lost opportunity.</TE>
<TE>   The Cougars (9-2) had national title aspirations until a
nightmarish second half led to a 25-7 loss to Ohio State. A
seven-game winning streak that included an overtime victory over USC
buried that memory, but the disappointment of losing to Washington is
fresh.</TE>
<TE>   The Game will color the way the Punch, the Call and the Ankle are
remembered.</TE>
<TE>   Will they become hurdles overcome heroically en route to glory?</TE>
<TE>   Or will they become insurmountable barriers that kept Washington
State from fulfilling its dreams?</TE>
<TE>   A good portion of the college football universe is waiting to find
out.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>If UCLA loses to Washington State Saturday, it shouldn't be for the
money. There isn't much at stake.</LD>
<LD>   A Bruin loss opens the door to the Holiday Bowl, even though UCLA
would finish behind Arizona State in the Pacific 10 Conference
standings. The bowl has its choice of any Pac-10 team and indications
are that Oregon State or UCLA would be picked ahead of Arizona State,
which could be headed to the Sun Bowl.</LD>
<LD>   The Holiday Bowl has a $2-million payout to each participant,
higher than the $750,000 payout of the Insight Bowl -- where the
Bruins probably will end up if they beat Washington State.</LD>
<TE>   But $1.1 million of the Holiday payout is divided among all Pac-10
Conference teams. The other $900,000 goes to the participating team
as a budget for travel and game preparations, meaning that UCLA would
get a total of $1.01 million.</TE>
<TE>   The entire $750,000 Insight payout goes to the participating team,
making the financial difference in the two games only $260,000.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Redshirt freshmen Tyler Ebell and Wendell Mathis will return kicks
in the absence of Tab Perry (ankle) and Jason Harrison (concussion).</TE>
<TE>   Neither player has returned a kick this season. Ebell, the
starting tailback, had 23 punt returns before being replaced by Craig
Bragg two games ago.</TE>
<TE>   Mathis, a strong, sturdy tailback, has 50 yards in 18 carries.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A crowd of 55,000 is expected at the Rose Bowl on Saturday.
Reserved seats are $30 and general admission seats are $12 for adults
and $4 for children.</TE>

<HD>Bruins' Strength Is in Numbers</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Eric Stephens</AU>
<BD>Times Staff Writer</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There is strength in numbers and for the UCLA men's soccer team, it
is the number of goals that have powered the Bruins in the NCAA
playoffs.</LD>
<LD>   With seven goals in two playoff matches, UCLA has found the net
more often than any of the eight remaining teams in the tournament.
The offensive assault will be key when the Bruins face Penn State in
the quarterfinals Saturday night at Drake Stadium.</LD>
<LD>   Including a three-goal performance to end the regular season
against Fresno State, UCLA (15-3-3) has scored 10 goals in its last
three matches.</LD>
<TE>   "It seems like we're getting some momentum now," UCLA Coach Tom
Fitzgerald said. "It's nice to be playing a high level of soccer this
time of year."</TE>
<TE>   The Bruins have spread the wealth with five players totaling 12
points or more. Senior forward Tim Pierce (10 goals, seven assists)
and junior forward Matt Taylor (eight goals, six assists) lead the
team but Adolfo Gregorio, Cliff McKinley and Jimmy Frazelle have
combined for 17 goals and 12 assists.</TE>
<TE>   Playoff victories over Loyola Marymount and California have been
indicative of their balance and depth. Gregorio scored twice, Aaron
Lopez had one goal and McKinley scored in a 4-2 second-round win over
the Lions. Lopez, McKinley and Taylor scored in a 3-2 third-round
victory Saturday over the Golden Bears.</TE>
<TE>   "Many other teams have one guy do a lot of their scoring but we've
managed to spread it around a bit," Fitzgerald said. "If one or two
of our guys is in a slump or is struggling, we've got others that can
put it in."</TE>
<TE>   Unlike the Bruins, Penn State (16-7-0) has largely relied on
forward Chad Severs to do the bulk of its scoring. Severs has 17
goals on the season and has scored in each of the Nittany Lions' last
six matches.</TE>
<TE>   In the postseason, Severs has had game-winning overtime goals
against William &amp; Mary and defending national champion North
Carolina. Fitzgerald said he is leaning toward putting Lopez on him.</TE>
<TE>   "He's very opportunistic," Fitzgerald said of Severs. "He's a
typical goal scorer in where he'll be in the right place at the right
time."</TE>
<TE>   A victory will put UCLA in the College Cup for the 11th time and
first since losing to Indiana in the 1999 semifinals.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Loyola Marymount is hosting the NCAA men's water polo tournament
for the first time at its two-year-old Burns Recreation Center. On
Saturday, California plays Queens College (N.Y.) in one semifinal and
defending national champion Stanford faces UC San Diego in the other
with the winners playing in Sunday's championship match.</TE>
<TE>   Cal (19-6) won the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation title last
weekend with a dramatic 9-8 victory over Pepperdine. Stanford (22-5)
lost in the semifinals to the Golden Bears but got the at-large berth
over the Waves on the strength of its No. 1 ranking for the majority
of the season.</TE>
<TE>   UC San Diego (19-11) qualified by winning the Western Water Polo
Assn. title and Queens (24-3) comes in as the Collegiate Water Polo
Assn. champion.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>USC still has a bowl game to play, but the Trojans will turn their
attention to next season when they resume a light practice schedule
today.</LD>
<LD>   Young players and others who redshirted because they transferred
or were injured will receive the majority of repetitions in the next
few weeks. The competition is expected to set the stage for more
intense battles during spring practice.</LD>
<LD>   "The coaches kind of told us, 'This is your time. Your chance to
make an impression. It's up to you,' " freshman lineman Fred Matua
said Thursday.</LD>
<TE>   Tim Davis, an offensive line coach, said he learned the value of
bowl practices during his five years on the staff at Wisconsin.</TE>
<TE>   "It's like having another spring practice," Davis said. "Do you
know why all the best teams keep going to bowl games? It's because of
those practices."</TE>
<TE>   Redshirt sophomore Matt Cassel, redshirt freshmen Matt Leinart and
Billy Hart and junior transfer Brandon Hance all will take plenty of
snaps as senior quarterback Carson Palmer travels the banquet circuit
next week. Palmer is scheduled to attend award ceremonies in Orlando,
Fla., and Louisville, Ky., and is likely to conclude the trip in New
York for the Heisman Trophy announcement.</TE>
<TE>   "With Carson gone, it is even more important for those guys to
step up," offensive coordinator Norm Chow said.</TE>
<TE>   Nick Holt, who coaches linebackers, said transfers Frostee Rucker
and Lofa Tatupu, and freshmen Oscar Lua and Dallas Sartz are among
those that will practice with the first unit in place of starters
Matt Grootegoed, Mike Pollard and Melvin Simmons.</TE>
<TE>   "Those guys will be ready for the bowl game," Holt said of the
starters, "but we don't need overkill. This is a chance for the young
guys to learn the system even better."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Tight end Gregg Guenther was on crutches Thursday, two days after
having arthroscopic surgery for a torn ligament in his left knee. He
said he would sit out two weeks of practice but will play in the bowl
game.</TE>
<TE>   Guenther said he thought he suffered the injury against Arizona
State on Nov. 16. He caught his first career touchdown pass against
UCLA the next week but did not play against Notre Dame.</TE>
<TE>   "I waited to have anything done because I wanted to be able to
play a full season," said Guenther, sidelined almost all of the
previous two seasons because of a back injury that required surgery.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   USC Coach Pete Carroll reportedly spoke with Utah Athletic
Director Chris Hill about Chow, who is due to return in time for
practice today after a three-state recruiting trip that concluded in
Hawaii.... USC will practice today and Saturday before breaking until
next Thursday.</TE>
