<HD>Drug Use, Trafficking on the Rise in Russia</HD>
<DH>Crime: The nation's porous border with Afghanistan makes it
a way station for smuggled narcotics. Afghan heroin is the top choice
of users.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JUDITH INGRAM</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER</BD>
<DL>MOSCOW</DL>
<LD>Hidden inside cabbages, hollowed walnuts, even the bellies of
desperately poor pregnant women, Afghan heroin steadily flows into
Russia, joining a stream of illegal drugs that officials warn is a
growing threat to the nation's stability.</LD>
<LD>   Over the last five years, Russia has become a major way station on
the trafficking route from Afghanistan to European markets.</LD>
<LD>   After a monthlong lull at the start of the war in Afghanistan last
fall, the trade has picked up again, Russian police say. They report
seizing 1,100 pounds of heroin so far this year, along with more than
2,000 pounds stopped on the border between Afghanistan and the former
Soviet republic of Tajikistan.</LD>
<TE>   "We expect a flood of drugs, which are now growing in Afghanistan,
in the second half of the year," said Oleg Kharichkin, deputy
director of the Russian Interior Ministry's narcotics division.</TE>
<TE>   Afghanistan isn't the only culprit. Traffickers use organized
crime channels to ship cocaine from Latin America through Russian
seaports to Europe and the United States. Peddlers bring in the
stimulant ephedrine from China. Amphetamines and other synthetic
drugs come from Europe, especially Poland. Ukrainians, Lithuanians
and Belarussians smuggle in poppy straw.</TE>
<TE>   But it is Afghan heroin that has become the narcotic of choice for
addicts in Russia, where more than 3 million people are estimated to
be hooked on illegal drugs. That is nearly 2.1% of the population,
which compares to 1.6% in the U.S., according to the U.S. Office of
National Drug Control Policy.</TE>
<TE>   Prevention programs are nearly nonexistent, and the decade after
the collapse of the Soviet Union has seen the steady closure of
government-funded youth clubs and recreation centers that kept many
children and teenagers out of trouble.</TE>
<TE>   Seventy percent of Russia's 450,000 officially registered addicts
are 25 and younger, and most start using drugs at age 14 or 15.</TE>
<TE>   Another worry for Russia is that the heroin trade finances
numerous militant groups along the country's restive southern flank,
threatening security within Russia and its neighbors.</TE>
<TE>   "Extremists need a lot of cash. For them, drugs are fast, easy,
good money," said Lt. Gen. Konstantin Totsky, chief of Russia's
border guards.</TE>
<TE>   Carried by donkeys and human couriers across the Pyandzh River and
Pamir Mountains, which form Afghanistan's northern border with
Tajikistan, heroin is then smuggled over the mountains of Uzbekistan
or Kyrgyzstan into Kazakhstan, and from there across the sparsely
patrolled 4,435-mile frontier with Russia. The U.S.-Mexican border is
half as long and much less rugged.</TE>
<TE>   Russia has 10,700 border guards monitoring the Tajik-Afghan
border, along with 10,000 Russian soldiers. Hardly a day goes by
without a skirmish. Some drug couriers are killed; others escape back
into Afghanistan, abandoning their precious cargos for the troops to
burn.</TE>
<TE>   "At present, on the border of Afghanistan and Tajikistan, there
are about seven tons of opium and almost two tons of heroin already
warehoused and ready for transport to Russia and Europe," Kharichkin
said.</TE>
<TE>   Russia is seeking money from the United Nations and Western
nations to strengthen security on the drug routes. Negotiations are
also under way to provide satellite imaging information on poppy
cultivation to the Afghan government, said Lt. Gen. Alexander
Sergeyev, chief of the Interior Ministry's anti-trafficking
department.</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, smugglers are spreading drugs throughout Russia.
Besides Moscow and St. Petersburg, heroin gangs concentrate on cities
in the oil and gas regions of Siberia and the far north, where
salaries are higher and potential markets richer.</TE>
<TE>   One major crossroads in the trade is the Ural Mountains' city of
Yekaterinburg, about 135 miles north of the Kazakh border and a
gateway between Asia and the more densely populated European part of
Russia. The city attracts seasonal workers from Central Asia, who
police say run drug-smuggling businesses out of the city's wholesale
produce market. Men, women and children take part.</TE>
<TE>   "More and more we're seeing women in early stages of pregnancy
carrying drugs. For $500, they're prepared to carry heroin in their
abdominal cavities," said Fyodor Anikeyev, an officer in the
Yekaterinburg narcotics squad. "Seeing their pale, unhealthy look,
agents [at the airport] naturally pick them out, but doctors refuse
to X-ray them so the babies won't be harmed."</TE>
<TE>   Official corruption also plays a role. Nazir Salimov, head of the
Yekaterinburg squad, said two top Tajik police officials were
arrested in June for trying to sell a large consignment of heroin.</TE>
<TE>   The same month, in Tajikistan, a former deputy defense minister
was charged with drug trafficking after allegedly ordering use of a
military helicopter to drop off 175 pounds of opium and a pound of
heroin.</TE>
<TE>   Activists working with addicts allege that Russian officials are
deeply involved too.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a huge level of corruption in law enforcement agencies at
all levels in Russia," said Father Anatoly Berestov, a
neuropathologist and Russian Orthodox monk who runs a drug treatment
center at the 17th-century Krutitskoye church in central Moscow.</TE>
<TE>   Interior Ministry officials deny the charge.</TE>
<TE>   Berestov and others also complain that the main police effort
appears aimed at punishing addicts, not traffickers.</TE>
<TE>   Possessing even a small amount of marijuana means up to three
years in prison. Helping a friend get the drug counts as distribution
-- seven to 15 years.</TE>
<TE>   "Why is there enough money to maintain these prisoners but not
enough for real anti-drug campaigning?" said Anna, a 23-year-old
former heroin addict who works at the Krutitskoye center.</TE>
<TE>   Experts and addicts blame the spiritual crisis and particularly
the permissiveness that gripped the country after the Soviet
collapse, including an explosion of pornography, movie and TV
violence, and unfettered teenage drinking.</TE>
<TE>   "This atmosphere of 'everything is permitted' has overwhelmed
everyone," said Anna, who declined to give her last name. "Plus,
there's the situation at home, where parents are running around
trying to figure out how to make enough money to feed their
children."</TE>
<TE>   Of the few rehabilitation programs, almost all charge for
treatment, in contrast to the Soviet era, when alcohol and drug
treatment was both free and mandatory.</TE>
<TE>   Berestov appears often on television and radio, and travels
throughout Russia. The program at his 4-year-old center, which is
financed by donations, includes psychological and medical counseling,
work at the center or a nearby monastery, and a lot of prayer. He
claims an 80% cure rate for the 3,000 addicts treated.</TE>
<TE>   "They're all former criminals, even murderers," the monk said
matter-of-factly. "But I'm not a police officer. I'm a priest, and my
role is to repair."</TE>
<TE>   The police say their efforts are beginning to bear fruit. Heroin
is becoming harder to get, and its price is rising -- reaching about
$30 per gram in Moscow, three times the price in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   Doctors say that the number of newly registered drug users 18 and
under fell by about a third last year and that deaths by overdose,
arrests of suspects in a drug-induced state and drug-provoked
psychoses are also down.</TE>
<TE>   But Berestov, who gets new patients every day, says he has seen no
letup. If anything, he and other experts say, young people are just
turning to different substances, including strong over-the-counter
medicines as well as Russia's traditional addiction -- alcohol.</TE>

<HD>Canadian Police Find the Lair of 'Bushman'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL>VANCOUVER, British Columbia</DL>
<LD>Canadian police have finally found the hideout of the "Bushman of the
Shuswap" who repeatedly taunted them through the media as he eluded
capture for two years.</LD>
<LD>   Police captured John Bjornstrom in November, but it was not until
last week that they were able to locate his hideout in the rugged
mountains of south-central British Columbia near Shuswap Lake.</LD>
<LD>   Tips from boaters on the lake helped locate the hideout, which
included "an elaborate underground shelter carved into the rock
hillside," the Royal Canadian Mounted Police said in a statement
Friday.</LD>
<TE>   Bjornstrom survived by stealing from houses and camps in the area.
The Mounties said they recovered a "staggering amount" of stolen
property that will take them weeks to sort through to identify who it
belongs to.</TE>
<TE>   Bjornstrom, who fled into the wildness in 1999 from a low-security
prison near Kamloops, British Columbia, gained national publicity --
and his nickname -- by calling the news media to taunt the
investigators trying to find him.</TE>
<TE>   Police eventually used his interest in publicity against him,
luring him into a trap by posing as television reporters seeking an
interview -- a tactic that was roundly condemned by media
organizations.</TE>
<TE>   "The Bushman" told reporters he was eluding police as he attempted
to expose a variety of conspiracies, including those surrounding the
1990s collapse of fraudulent Canadian gold-mining firm Bre-X Minerals
Ltd.</TE>
<TE>   Bjornstrom is awaiting trial on charges that include escape,
assault and burglary. Police said new charges may be added based on
the evidence recovered from his hideout.</TE>

<HD>Kidnapped to Be a Camel Racer</HD>
<DH>Bangladesh: Boy was snatched off the street and sent to the
Mideast until he grew too big. After four years and a severe injury,
he was sent home penniless.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PARVEEN AHMED</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER</BD>
<DL>DHAKA, Bangladesh</DL>
<LD>Ali Islam has a nasty scar along his deformed right arm from the days
when he was a jockey racing camels.</LD>
<LD>   He's retired now -- at age 10.</LD>
<LD>   His sad eyes have seen a side of the world known to hundreds of
poor Bangladeshi children every year: Ali was abducted from home and
sold into illicit labor far away.</LD>
<TE>   Ali's journey started in 1998. He was playing at a river ferry
terminal in Dhaka, the Bangladeshi capital, where his poor family
ekes out a living as migrant workers. He dozed off for a nap.</TE>
<TE>   "The next thing I remember is waking up in a dark room," Ali
recalled in an interview. There, he met a man named Yunus and a woman
called Ashia who took him for a bus ride. At a border crossing, the
couple passed Ali off as their son.</TE>
<TE>   When the journey stopped, Ali remembers seeing mountains for the
first time. The bus had driven out of his home in South Asia and
crossed a portion of eastern India before arriving in Katmandu, the
capital of Nepal at the base of the Himalayas.</TE>
<TE>   After several months in Nepal, Ali was taken aside by a
Bangladeshi man and ordered to call the man "father." The two boarded
a plane and ended up in Dubai in the United Arab Emirates. The child
had no travel documents; Ali's name was entered in the man's passport
as his son.</TE>
<TE>   "After leaving Dubai airport, [he] handed me to an Arab man," Ali
said. He watched the two men exchange money.</TE>
<TE>   "The man took me to the desert and put me on a camel," said Ali,
who had never seen a camel before. "This man said something in Arabic
and the camel started running. I was terrified and screamed."</TE>
<TE>   The 6-year-old boy was now a jockey in a Persian Gulf desert.</TE>
<TE>   Ali had to race camels twice a week for the next two years,
competing against other young riders, most from Bangladesh and
Pakistan.</TE>
<TE>   Camel races are immensely popular in the Persian Gulf. Although
the United Arab Emirates banned the use of child jockeys in 1993, the
law is openly ignored, with even televised races showing small boys
riding the huge beasts.</TE>
<TE>   The boys, who are favored as jockeys because they are light, ride
bareback or are strapped to the camels' backs. Some trainers say they
attach Velcro to the saddles and to the boys' pants to keep them in
place.</TE>
<TE>   Ali was forced to continue racing -- until he grew too big. When
Ali tipped the scales at 33 pounds, he had to work as a groom.</TE>
<TE>   During one feeding session, a camel bit Ali's right arm near the
wrist. The bite was so deep it severed nerves and left his flesh
hanging from the bone. It took months for the wound to close, but it
never properly healed. Ali has not regained strength in his right
hand.</TE>
<TE>   In May, after a year and a half as a groom, Ali was deemed no
longer useful. He was given a plane ticket to Dhaka, some pocket
money and the promise that four years of back wages would be wired to
his parents, then was dropped off outside the Bangladesh Embassy in
Dubai.</TE>
<TE>   Back in Bangladesh, authorities placed the boy with the Bangladesh
National Women Lawyers Assn., a human rights and legal aid group. It
arranged a reunion with his emotional parents.</TE>
<TE>   "When he didn't come home that night, we looked everywhere. We
looked for two years, but then gave up," Abdul Latif said of his son,
the youngest of eight children.</TE>
<TE>   "I used to cry and pray," said his mother, Halima. "I thought he'd
fallen into the river and drowned."</TE>
<TE>   Ali's father hopes to send the boy to school so he can learn a
trade. The family never got any money from the boy's employers in
Dubai.</TE>
<TE>   "He has lost power in his right hand," Latif said. "He can't do
much, but he has to have a future."</TE>
<TE>   Despite tough laws against human trafficking, which carries the
death penalty, hundreds of Bangladeshi children are kidnapped every
year, humanitarian groups say. Abducted girls often end up in
brothels in India and Pakistan; the boys mostly are taken to the
Persian Gulf to race camels.</TE>
<TE>   Abdur Rahman Bichu, who was charged with trafficking children like
Ali, was arrested in January near a bus terminal in Dhaka for
possession of forged travel documents.</TE>
<TE>   The lawyers' association has filed complaints against two other
people based on Ali's accounts. Bichu's case is not one of them, but
it is similar.</TE>
<TE>   Bichu ran an employment agency in the town of Dhala, which
advertised jobs for Bangladeshis in the Middle East.</TE>
<TE>   Sohel Ahmed, a villager from Dhala, said he sold family land and
property to pay Bichu for finding him a job in Dubai. Ahmed said he
was told to travel to the Middle East via Nepal. His story was
similar to Ali's.</TE>
<TE>   Sohel said that when he arrived, he was given a child to take
along to Dubai. He was told to instruct the child to call him "Baba,"
Bengali for "father."</TE>
<TE>   "I realized I had gotten myself involved with a child-trafficking
gang," said Ahmed, one of several people scheduled to testify against
Bichu. "I got scared and said no."</TE>
<TE>   Not everyone does. This is a country where more than 40% of the
people live below the poverty line and 35% are unemployed, so a
payoff from trafficking can be alluring.</TE>
<TE>   The most popular child-trafficking route out of Bangladesh is the
one that Ali described: over the loosely policed frontier with
India's northeastern Assam or Tripura states, then overland to
Katmandu for a flight to the Middle East.</TE>
<TE>   "It's easy to get a visa to Nepal," said Salma Ali at the
Bangladesh National Women Lawyers Assn. "And nobody cares in Katmandu
how many Bangladeshis fly from there to the Middle East."</TE>

<HD>Coeducation Nears End at Kuwait University</HD>
<DH>Mideast: Ban on mixing of the sexes largely has been
ignored, but officials say segregation will begin by the end of the
next school year.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DIANA ELIAS</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER</BD>
<DL>KUWAIT</DL>
<LD>In the 1970s, women at Kuwait University wore miniskirts, mixed
easily with the male students and joined them for picnics in the
desert.</LD>
<LD>   No longer. These days, on the six campuses of Kuwait's only
university, hundreds of young women are covered in black head-to-toe
cloaks. Even those who wear Western dress tend to avoid speaking with
men unless necessary.</LD>
<LD>   In most faculties of the 18,000-student university, men and women
still attend the same classes, but that too is about to change.</LD>
<TE>   Six years ago, Muslim fundamentalist legislators pushed through a
law banning mixing of the sexes in classes, libraries, cafeterias,
labs and extracurricular activities at Kuwait University. Compliance
was lax until lawmakers grilled Education Minister Misaed Haroun
about it in April, and he committed to full segregation by the end of
the next school year.</TE>
<TE>   The action did not go unchallenged. According to Massouma Mubarak,
who teaches political science at the university, students collected
9,000 signatures on a petition opposing segregation by gender.</TE>
<TE>   "It is very sad to make students feel that mixing with the
opposite sex is immoral and that they cannot be trusted to be with
one another," she said in an interview.</TE>
<TE>   But Hakem Mutairi, a Kuwait University teacher of Islamic law and
a leading Muslim conservative, argues that coeducation robs many
women of university studies because their conservative families won't
send them to a mixed campus.</TE>
<TE>   When Kuwait University opened for men and women in 1966, classes
were separate. But as the number of students grew and more facilities
were needed, coeducation was allowed. Kuwaiti society was more open
then. "We used to sit beside men without thinking anything of it,"
said Awatef Madu, who met her husband while studying law at the
university in the 1970s. "Now, because of religious extremism,
everything is seen through sex."</TE>
<TE>   Although Kuwaiti women drive, work and hold senior government
positions, today's society remains conservative. Wedding parties are
held separately for men and women -- sometimes in different hotels.
There are separate waiting areas in clinics. Public schools have
always been segregated after kindergarten. Women can't vote or run
for office.</TE>
<TE>   Men and women still work together in government offices, banks and
hospitals. Fundamentalists have not yet tried to change that, but the
Kuwait Finance House, an Islamic bank, has special branches for
women.</TE>
<TE>   Classes are already separate at Kuwait University Faculty of
Islamic Law.</TE>
<TE>   In a campus cafeteria one recent afternoon, men and women sat
together at only one table. At the others, men sat with men, women
with women.</TE>
<TE>   "There is nothing we can do to change the situation," said Othman
Awadi, a 21-year-old marketing student.</TE>
<TE>   If the hard-liners aren't stopped, he said, "50 years from now,
society will be totally separated. We will have malls for men and
malls for women, and women will not be able to drive."</TE>
<TE>   Among Kuwait's neighbors, state universities are coed in Bahrain
and Oman, but segregated in Saudi Arabia -- where women are banned
from driving -- and in Qatar and the United Arab Emirates.</TE>
<TE>   There are no private universities in Kuwait. Any founded in the
future will fall under the segregation law.</TE>
<TE>   That's fine with medical student Nagham Saffi. "Our religion and
our people do not accept coeducation," she said. Saffi, wearing a
pink head scarf and white coat, said it embarrasses her to see men
and women students standing together or laughing loudly.</TE>
<TE>   But Louloua Massad, 20, who is studying accounting at Kuwait
University, said she had no problem with coeducation as long as
"everyone keeps to themselves."</TE>
<TE>   "I talk to my men classmates only during lectures, but not
outside," said Massad, dressed in jeans and head scarf. "People might
misunderstand if they pass and see me talking to a man."</TE>
<TE>   Jawaher Bader, a U.S.-educated teacher's assistant at the Kuwait
University School of Architecture, said her male and female students
work together in the design studio. She said she once invited them to
a restaurant, but she had to cancel because none of the girls
received parental permission to be out with men who were not
relatives.</TE>
<TE>   University is free in oil-rich Kuwait, and the cost of segregating
classes is estimated at more than $180 million. Preparations have
begun and some summer classes already are segregated. Professors are
worried about heavier workloads, while departments that haven't
already made the switch face extra difficulty.</TE>
<TE>   Mubarak said her political science department had held off in
hopes the no-coed law would "be forgotten or canceled." Now, she
says, "in the fall, we will have a real problem because we don't have
enough teachers or enough classrooms."</TE>
<TE>   Mutairi, the conservative, says the effort must be made. Extra
costs, he said, "are nothing compared to the problems that could
result from coeducation."</TE>

<HD>Wartime Donations to Croatia Come Under Scrutiny</HD>
<DH>Balkans: Expatriates sent home millions during the
secession war. But now donors are wondering where the money went.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SNJEZANA VUKIC</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER</BD>
<DL>ZAGREB, Croatia</DL>
<LD>When war raged during Croatia's secession from Yugoslavia a decade
ago, Croats begged their brethren abroad to help. Andjelko Vlajic
didn't hesitate: He donated a large chunk of his savings to defend
his homeland.</LD>
<LD>   Eleven years later, he can't help but wonder: Where did the money
go?</LD>
<LD>   "If it indeed was used for defense, I'm more than happy I have
helped," said Vlajic, a 59-year-old construction worker who lives in
Germany. "But if it ended up in someone's pocket, I'm really angry."</LD>
<TE>   Questions about the millions, or even billions, of dollars in
wartime donations by Croat expatriates began emerging in June, when
the state prosecutor blocked a bank account linked to the former
governing party led by the late Franjo Tudjman, Croatia's president
for nine years.</TE>
<TE>   The move was triggered by a newspaper's interview with a former
close aide to Tudjman, Hrvoje Sarinic. In it, Sarinic said that at
Tudjman's request, nearly $1.5 million worth of German marks was
transferred four years ago from a secret account in Austria to the
Croatian account of the Trust of the State Plight, which is an arm of
Tudjman's party, the Croatian Democratic Union.</TE>
<TE>   The accounts in Austria and elsewhere were opened in 1990-91, when
Croatian Serbs took up arms to try to keep the country part of
Yugoslavia. The Austria account was labeled "For Croatian Defense and
Economic Recovery," and expatriate money poured in.</TE>
<TE>   Jelena Lovric, a political analyst for the newspaper Novi List,
said the fact that at least some of the contributions ended up in the
party's coffers showed that Tudjman "took upon himself a right to use
donations at will."</TE>
<TE>   The chief prosecutor, Mladen Bajic, contends that the money
belongs to the state, not the party, and should be handed over. He
has launched an investigation and, until it is over, the trust cannot
use the account.</TE>
<TE>   Ivic Pasalic, another close Tudjman aide who headed the trust for
years, insists that the money merely sat in the account and is still
there. The trust spent only the interest, he said.</TE>
<TE>   Now many expatriates are asking how much of the money they gave
ended up in the hands of other parties or in private accounts.</TE>
<TE>   When the war began, the Croatian army was made up largely of
unarmed volunteers. A 1991 U.N. weapons embargo hit both the Croats
and the Serbs, but the Serbs had the powerful Yugoslav army on their
side.</TE>
<TE>   The government needed money to illegally buy weapons, so it turned
to expatriates, estimated to number 2 million -- a population half as
large as Croatia's own.</TE>
<TE>   Cash poured in. Some went straight to bank accounts; other money
was collected in briefcases, plastic bags and hats at expatriate
dinners. Few Croats abroad sought receipts or asked for detailed
explanations.</TE>
<TE>   Although it is believed that the vast majority of the money did,
in fact, go for arms and other legitimate needs of the war-torn
country, many people suspect that at least some was siphoned off.</TE>
<TE>   Marinka Orlic, head of the government's anti-corruption office,
which is involved in the investigation, said there are "suspicions
that some of the money paid as donations was transferred to private
bank accounts and that some individuals used it to buy themselves
companies."</TE>
<TE>   Tudjman's party has replaced Pasalic as head of the trust and has
revoked his membership.</TE>
<TE>   Pasalic contends that the investigation is a politically motivated
attack by the current government, which defeated Tudjman's party in
elections two years ago. The government has been criticized for
failing to prosecute the corruption that flourished during Tudjman's
rule.</TE>
<TE>   Anka Cenic, a 44-year-old worker unemployed since her Croatian
factory went out of business five years ago, said she hopes that the
investigation will mean "someone will end up behind bars this time."</TE>
<TE>   "For more than 10 years, we were watching some people getting
extremely rich, while most of us were steadily getting poorer," she
said. "We all know it was a dirty business -- it's just up to the
judiciary to confirm it."</TE>

<HD>A New Day for Afghan Children</HD>
<DH>Youth: Youngsters in Kandahar, the Taliban's heartland,
will be able to learn basic subjects and lift their voices in song.</DH>

<DL>KANDAHAR, Afghanistan</DL>
<LD>They walk arm and arm, barefoot down gravel roads, giggling at having
their picture taken.</LD>
<LD>   They frolic in canals to cool themselves in the midday sun. Their
playgrounds are abandoned Soviet military vehicles.</LD>
<LD>   They are the children of Kandahar.</LD>
<TE>   This southern Afghanistan city of 500,000 people was the heartland
of the fallen Taliban regime.</TE>
<TE>   It was shrouded in oppressive social rules until the hard-line
Islamic militia was driven from power in December.</TE>
<TE>   "I want my son, Samiullah, to grow up and be a nonreligious
teacher," says Khalilullah, who sells small household goods at the
bazaar.</TE>
<TE>   The boy reads the Koran, Islam's holy book, on the sidewalk
nearby.</TE>
<TE>   When the city's children return to school in the fall, they will
have a chance, many for the first time, to learn basic subjects and
lift their voices in song.</TE>
<TE>   "During the Taliban time, the children were only studying
religious books. They had no future. Now they will have the chance to
study subjects like physics and mathematics. They have a better
future," says Asadullah Hamfa, principal of Mir Wais Nekah High
School.</TE>
<TE>   Until school starts, some children are working in the fields
outside town. Others shape metal at workshops next to men four times
their age. Some beg in the streets.</TE>
<TE>   At a stadium once used as an execution ground by the Taliban,
youngsters stand reverently on the patchy turf as their heroes --
older brothers, uncles and fathers -- receive trophies or handmade
banners for play during a soccer tournament.</TE>
<TE>   Mothers in burkas bring their children to the Mir Wais Hospital
for medicine, sitting patiently on the lobby's dusty floor.</TE>
<TE>   A girl pushes her sandals across the floor with her hands, back
and forth, dodging the legs of passers-by.</TE>
<TE>   Outside, groups of children follow after foreigners, some wanting
their pictures taken, others offering small pastries for sale.</TE>

<HD>Vessels Offer Window Into Ancient Use of Drugs</HD>
<DH>Archeology: Ceramic pots found throughout the Middle East
help researchers understand how people treated illness and disease.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JASON KEYSER</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM</DL>
<LD>A thriving Bronze Age drug trade supplied narcotics to ancient
cultures throughout the eastern Mediterranean as balm for the pain of
childbirth and disease, proving a sophisticated knowledge of
medicines dating back thousands of years, researchers say.</LD>
<LD>   Ancient ceramic pots, most of them nearly identical in shape and
about 5 inches long, have been found in tombs and settlements
throughout the Middle East, dating as far back as 1400 B.C., said Joe
Zias, an anthropologist at Jerusalem's Hebrew University.</LD>
<LD>   The drugs were probably used as medicine, and the finds are
helping researchers better understand how ancient people treated
illness and disease.</LD>
<TE>   "It's a window to the past that many people are unaware of," Zias
told a recent conference held in Israel on DNA and archeology.
"Here's something used in prehistoric times and it's used until
today."</TE>
<TE>   When turned upside-down, the thin-necked vessels with round bases
resemble opium poppy pods. If there was any doubt about what was
inside, the round bases have white markings, designs that symbolized
knife cuts made on poppy bulbs so the white opium base can ooze and
be harvested, Zias said.</TE>
<TE>   The Mycenaean ceramics were analyzed with a procedure called gas
chromatography that turned up traces of opium.</TE>
<TE>   Hundreds of the pots have been found, and they commonly show up in
the hands of antiquities dealers in places like Jerusalem's Old City</TE>
<TE>   . "Give me an hour there and I could find you 10 of them," Zias
said.</TE>
<TE>   Based on ancient Egyptian medical writings from the 3rd millennium
B.C., researchers believe that opium and hashish -- a smokable drug
that comes from the concentrated resin from the flowers of hemp
plants -- were used during surgery and to treat aches and pains and
other ailments. Hashish was also used to ease menstrual cramps and
was even offered to women during childbirth.</TE>
<TE>   Based on Egyptian writings, archeologists believe that the opium
was eaten rather than smoked.</TE>
<TE>   The drugs are part of a medical record that shows that the
ancients were far more advanced than most people realize, Zias said,
noting evidence that European people did cranial surgery as long as
10,000 years ago, while the Romans left records of 120 surgical
procedures.</TE>
<TE>   Mark Spigelman, a Zias colleague at Hebrew University, found one
of the poppy-shaped ceramic pots from the middle Bronze Age in
Siqqura, a Giza cemetery near the pyramids outside Cairo during a dig
four years ago. The pot, found in an 18th Egyptian Dynasty grave, was
identical to other pots found throughout ancient Israel and the
Middle East.</TE>
<TE>   "These guys were selling opium all over the Middle East. This is
the original Medellin cartel, 3,500 years ago," Spigelman said in a
joking reference to the violent Colombian cocaine cartel.</TE>
<TE>   It seems more likely, however, that the ancient trade was run by
respected healers rather than violent drug lords.</TE>
<TE>   "We know for sure these things were used for medical purposes,"
Zias said. "The question is whether they were used for recreational
purposes."</TE>
<TE>   In an archeologically rich area of central Israel, Zias found
another clue. While excavating a tomb from the late Roman period in
the town of Beit Shemesh 10 years ago, he found the skeleton of a
14-year-old girl who died in childbirth around AD 390. On her stomach
was a fleck of a burnt brownish-black substance.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought it was incense," Zias said. But when he had it analyzed
by police and chemists at Hebrew University, it turned out to be a
seven-gram mixture of hashish, dried seeds, fruit and common reeds.</TE>
<TE>   Seven glass vessels containing traces of the drug were found near
the skeleton. She probably used them to inhale the smoky cocktail to
aid her delivery. Medical researchers have found that other than
relaxing the user, hashish increases the force and frequency of
contractions in women giving birth. It was used in deliveries until
the 19th century, after which new drugs were developed.</TE>
<TE>   But it didn't help this girl, who was only 4 feet 6 inches tall.
She bled to death.</TE>
<TE>   The drug was an extremely rare find. Organic compounds quickly
decay, but because this one had been burned, it was carbonized and
preserved.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the first time it's ever been found in terms of direct
evidence in an archeological dig," Zias said. "You rarely find direct
evidence of drugs in antiquity."</TE>

<HD>Mistake Jeopardizes an American Dream</HD>
<DH>Immigration: A Salvadoran man faced deportation because of
an old crime. Help came from an unlikely source.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>REBECCA COOK</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER</BD>
<DL>WENATCHEE, Wash.</DL>
<LD>He came to America seeking the chance to work hard and make something
of himself. He built a successful business and a loving family.</LD>
<LD>   But Jose Carlos Cruz Melendez made one mistake, and it threatened
to destroy everything.</LD>
<LD>   Just as he was poised to become a U.S. citizen, he was ordered
deported under a federal law that punishes immigrants with criminal
records -- even those who have served their sentences.</LD>
<TE>   As a noncitizen, no judge or jury could save him. His only hope
was a pardon from the governor, a measure of redemption granted to
only a few people each year.</TE>
<TE>   In the end, his fate would turn on the words of a most unlikely
champion.</TE>
<TE>   Carlos Cruz, as he's called by family and friends, was born Sept.
29, 1966, in a remote El Salvador village, without running water,
electricity, schools or doctors. His parents grew beans and corn to
feed their nine children, who one by one left to seek a better life
in the United States.</TE>
<TE>   Carlos first fell in love with the United States when he was 8,
reading letters from his siblings up north to his illiterate parents.</TE>
<TE>   "They said it was hard work, but a lot of chances," he said.</TE>
<TE>   At 15, he sneaked across the border and traveled with his sister
to Connell, Wash., to pick asparagus.</TE>
<TE>   His family reunited in the orchards during cherry season. A friend
remembers when the newly arrived teenager asked for a second
hamburger at lunch. Twenty years later, the men in the orchards still
laugh about Carlos Cruz: the boy who always wanted more.</TE>
<TE>   Soon Cruz got steadier work at a potato factory, each week putting
$30 into savings. After five years, he qualified for an amnesty
program and became a legal permanent resident.</TE>
<TE>   He bought a van with his savings and started his own business
serving Mexican food to field workers from his mobile restaurant.</TE>
<TE>   He made $7 the first day.</TE>
<TE>   Business grew, and he bought another van. His sisters and brothers
moved to the area and set up taco vans, each in a different city so
they wouldn't compete.</TE>
<TE>   "I have never seen anybody work so hard in my life as I've seen
these guys," said Phil Brown, a Wenatchee native that Cruz met when
he rented storefront space in Brown's coin laundry. "They are the
perfect type of person that I could see come to America."</TE>
<TE>   As Cruz established his business and family, he got interested in
Wenatchee politics. He wanted to vote.</TE>
<TE>   To do so, he needed to become a citizen. In 1997, he took classes
and aced the test on American government. Soon after he got a letter
from the Immigration and Naturalization Service inviting him to
Yakima for an interview.</TE>
<TE>   This was it, he thought.</TE>
<TE>   On a September morning, he drove his newly washed car to Yakima.
Once there, Cruz watched eagerly as an immigration officer
scrutinized his green card.</TE>
<TE>   "You're under arrest," the officer said flatly.</TE>
<TE>   "Why?" Cruz asked.</TE>
<TE>   "You're a criminal," the officer said. "You're going back to your
country."</TE>
<TE>   Cruz was handcuffed and put in an INS van, traveling the same road
he had driven so optimistically 10 minutes before. He watched as
Yakima faded in the distance.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Yakima meeting was a sting to catch criminal immigrants. A
1996 law requires automatic deportation of noncitizens who have
committed a variety of crimes, even after they have served their
time.</TE>
<TE>   Cruz' crime: statutory rape.</TE>
<TE>   Cruz was 24; Renee said she was 17, although she was really 14.
They met at a community dance. Cruz was looking for a girlfriend,
maybe a wife. Renee was looking for a boyfriend, maybe an escape from
her troubled home life.</TE>
<TE>   Cruz was a source of support as Renee was shuffled from her
mother's home to her grandmother, then to a group home. Their
friendship turned to romance when she was 15.</TE>
<TE>   "I was attracted to Carlos' goodness and strength," she recalled.
"He was very generous and open, the kind of person that would stop to
help someone change a flat tire on the side of the road."</TE>
<TE>   In 1993, Renee ran away from her group home and straight to Cruz's
door. Police found her after she left his house the next morning.</TE>
<TE>   An officer visited Cruz at work the next day.</TE>
<TE>   Cruz was shocked to learn that having sex with Renee was illegal.
In El Salvador, a 25-year-old man dating a 17-year-old girl would be
acceptable.</TE>
<TE>   He was arrested and charged with communicating with a minor for
immoral purposes, a misdemeanor, and third-degree rape of a child --
also known as statutory rape. He admitted everything.</TE>
<TE>   He was sentenced to and successfully completed 120 days of work
release, 36 months of community supervision and 24 months of
outpatient sex offender treatment. In therapy, he says, he came to
understand why it was wrong to date a teenager.</TE>
<TE>   He adhered to the no-contact order, even when Renee tried to call
him. By the time his probation ended and Renee turned 18, she had a
new boyfriend. Both moved on.</TE>
<TE>   Cruz married a few years later, to a Mexican immigrant his own
age. They met when she visited his taco van and teased him about
working all the time.</TE>
<TE>   They bought a house in Wenatchee and had three children: Bianca,
now 6; Nancy, 4, and Carlos Jr., 2.</TE>
<TE>   As the father of two girls, Cruz now says he'd go through the roof
if an older man dated one of his daughters as a teen.</TE>
<TE>   "I know how bad was my crime," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever his regrets, the law said he must be deported.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Cruz and Seattle attorney Robert Gibbs started searching for
loopholes in the deportation order. The courts rejected their
argument that Cruz didn't understand English at the time of his plea.</TE>
<TE>   Gibbs petitioned the Supreme Court twice, unsuccessfully. By late
2000, time was running out on him.</TE>
<TE>   Gibbs told his client that immigration officers could take him
away at any time. Cruz warned his wife Lucy not to answer the door.</TE>
<TE>   Lucy said she and the children would come with him to El Salvador,
a country she'd never seen. But he didn't want his children to grow
up in the poverty he'd worked so hard to escape.</TE>
<TE>   Cruz visited his friend Phil Brown at his coin laundry late one
night, after work.</TE>
<TE>   Brown recalls that Cruz had tears in his eyes as he said, "I can't
let this happen to me -- my family needs me."</TE>
<TE>   Presented with a seemingly hopeless case, Gibbs tried a longshot
-- seeking a pardon from the governor. Gov. Gary Locke grants only
half a dozen pardons and commutations a year.</TE>
<TE>   They gathered court documents and letters from people who knew
Cruz, from his therapist to his priest, family and business
associates.</TE>
<TE>   But the person who most impressed the state Clemency and Pardons
Board was a voice from Cruz's past:</TE>
<TE>   "My name is Renee Arceo," she wrote. "Although the state describes
me as the 'victim' of this crime, I do not and have never thought of
myself in this way."</TE>
<TE>   Now 23, working as a secretary and the mother of two children,
Renee Arceo told the pardons board about her relationship with Cruz
in an affidavit and in person at the hearing last year.</TE>
<TE>   "He had a very giving heart. He was also a hard worker, and had a
steady job and a vision of what he wanted his life to be like. These
were all things that I needed in my unstable life."</TE>
<TE>   The five members of the board listened carefully. Victims often
testify at pardon hearings, but rarely on the side of the criminal.</TE>
<TE>   They questioned Renee about her family, the police report and
Cruz.</TE>
<TE>   "I was in love with him," she said. "I don't think he's any threat
to society at all."</TE>
<TE>   The board had heard enough.</TE>
<TE>   That day, they voted unanimously to recommend that Cruz be
pardoned and thus allowed to stay in the country.</TE>
<TE>   Their recommendation went to the governor.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Cruz was working in his taco van in February when Gibbs called.</TE>
<TE>   "I have really good news," Gibbs said.</TE>
<TE>   The governor said yes.</TE>
<TE>   "You're not kidding me?" Cruz asked. He felt as if Gibbs had given
him his life back.</TE>
<TE>   To celebrate, he went shopping for a new taco van for his sister,
who'd just gotten her green card. That day, Cruz said he felt: "We
belong to this country."</TE>
<TE>   On July 4, he helped harvest cherries from an orchard he manages,
then hosted a barbecue and lit fireworks.</TE>
<TE>   During Cruz's five-year legal battle, he says he never stopped
believing that America would give him a second chance.</TE>
<TE>   He has resubmitted his citizenship application to the INS and
hopes for a reply soon.</TE>

<HD>1996 Deportation Law Has Some Drawbacks</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>REBECCA COOK</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER</BD>
<DL>SEATTLE</DL>
<LD>The 1996 Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act
passed with broad bipartisan support from lawmakers eager to protect
America's borders.</LD>
<LD>   But the law had unintended consequences.</LD>
<LD>   Congress in 1996 expanded the list of deportable offenses to
include such crimes as shoplifting and possession of small amounts of
drugs. At the same time, Congress took away the power of immigration
judges to review these deportations and grant relief in some cases.</LD>
<TE>   The law resulted in the deportation of dangerous criminals. But it
also mandated exile for law-abiding, longtime residents who committed
minor crimes years ago. In some cases, adopted foreign children have
been deported to "home" countries where they have no family and don't
speak the language.</TE>
<TE>   "The 1996 law went too far. Our position has always been the
judges should have greater discretion and authority," said Russ
Bergeron, Immigration and Naturalization Service spokesman.</TE>
<TE>   Every year, more than 60,000 people are deported as "criminal
aliens." Of those, about 4,000 are permanent residents, Bergeron
said.</TE>
<TE>   He said the deportation of criminal aliens has increased 20-fold
since 1993, driven by increased space and money for INS detention and
enforcement.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. Supreme Court dealt a blow to the 1996 law in a June
decision that said immigrants who pleaded guilty to crimes before
1996 have the right to get their cases reviewed in court.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Rep. Barney Frank (D-Mass.) has attracted bipartisan
support for a bill he is sponsoring that would return the power of
immigration judges to overturn deportation orders for some criminal
immigrants.</TE>

<HD>UC Animal Lab Takes a Bite Out of Crime</HD>
<DH>Science: The well-regarded animal DNA testing center at the
Davis campus occasionally helps put humans behind bars.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KIM CURTIS</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER</BD>
<DL>DAVIS, Calif.</DL>
<LD>Scotland Yard investigators were stumped. A bouncer had been stabbed
to death in the alley outside The Paradise Bar in South London. Pools
of blood were left behind by the victim, the suspect and someone--or
something--else.</LD>
<LD>   "They swabbed the blood up off the floor, they extracted DNA from
it," said Marcia Eggleston, a researcher at UC Davis. "When they
typed it, they couldn't get a result."</LD>
<LD>   Turned out it was animal blood, something few crime labs are
equipped to analyze. So Scotland Yard turned to the Internet and
tracked down the Veterinary Genetics Laboratory at Davis and its
extensive database of animal DNA.</LD>
<TE>   The lab's verdict: The blood matched a bull terrier that was found
to belong to a man who had been kicked out of the bar.</TE>
<TE>   The finding helped put the killer in prison for life.</TE>
<TE>   The lab's technicians, who work out of a small, nondescript
building and several trailers on the Davis campus, most often test
animal hair, which works best if it's pulled out at the root. But
they also extract DNA from urine, saliva, feces, dead skin, dander
and just about anything else.</TE>
<TE>   No two people or animals, except identical twins, have exactly the
same DNA sequence. Even though only limited segments of a person's
DNA are scrutinized in typing, those segments will be statistically
unique.</TE>
<TE>   "You do the science, you hand them the results and you let them do
what they do," UC Davis technician Glen Byrns said.</TE>
<TE>   Forensics isn't the lab's main job. About 98% of its work is DNA
typing to determine the bloodlines of horses. Since 1995, the lab has
typed 600,000 horses.</TE>
<TE>   "Horses are a multibillion-dollar industry," Eggleston said. "If
you buy a $40,000 horse for your kid, you want to know who it is. Are
these pedigrees correct?"</TE>
<TE>   The lab also has 25,000 samples for cattle, 32,000 for elk, 10,000
for dogs and 53,000 for members of the camel family, including
llamas, alpacas and dromedaries. It is believed to be the largest
animal DNA testing lab in the world, Eggleston said. It earned about
$4.7 million last year, nearly all of which went back into the lab.</TE>
<TE>   About six years ago, the lab branched out into criminal work when
a Simi Valley woman who owned three Great Danes called. One of her
dogs had bitten a neighborhood boy's arm. She wanted to euthanize
only the dog that had attacked.</TE>
<TE>   "They heard that UC Davis did animal testing, so they were hoping
we might be able to do something," Eggleston said.</TE>
<TE>   The dog had left a saliva trail on the boy's shirt sleeve, which
the lab matched to one of the swabs the woman had scraped on the
inside of all three dogs' cheeks.</TE>
<TE>   Jerry Ruth, senior forensic scientist at the National Fish and
Wildlife Forensic Laboratory, said his lab works on wildlife cases
while UC Davis is committed to domestic animals, so rarely do they
collaborate. However, the Davis lab has a good reputation, Ruth said,
and he often refers the FBI and state and local police departments to
the lab for domestic animal DNA typing.</TE>
<TE>   The UC Davis veterinary school is considered the top program in
the nation. "The work I've seen come out of the lab is consistent
with the school's top ranking," Ruth said.</TE>
<TE>   The Davis lab's criminal cases now fall into three categories:
animals that kill or hurt people or animals, animal abuse cases, and
animals that can tie a suspect to the crime scene.</TE>
<TE>   A few weeks ago, a bloody golf club arrived in the mail.
Authorities believed it had been used to kill a dog. Would there be a
match? The lab gets one or two such criminal cases a week, in
addition to requests for parentage testing.</TE>
<TE>   Tests start at $250 apiece, mostly to discourage frivolous civil
suits. It's the more serious cases that are most rewarding.</TE>
<TE>   A few years ago in rural Chickasaw County, Iowa, a Mennonite woman
was gardening with her toddler and the family dog when a man arrived
in a pickup truck. He got out, accosted the woman, dragged her to his
truck and tried to rape her, authorities said. Although a suspect was
arrested, the woman couldn't pick him out of photo lineup. But she
had seen the dog, a border collie named Rover, urinate on the tire of
the man's truck.</TE>
<TE>   The Davis lab was contacted and the suspect ended up pleading
guilty to attempted sexual assault.</TE>

<HD>Drought Hard on Pronghorn Antelope Herd</HD>
<DH>Arizona: Fewer fawns are surviving, but officials say
species is not in danger of extinction.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WALTER BERRY</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER</BD>
<DL>PHOENIX</DL>
<LD>Fewer fawns of pronghorn antelope are surviving this year throughout
Arizona, and the state's prolonged drought may be the main factor.</LD>
<LD>   However, wildlife experts insist that the species is not in danger
of disappearing from the grasslands of Arizona.</LD>
<LD>   "We're nowhere close to saying they're endangered or close to
going extinct," said Eric Gardner, a Prescott-based field supervisor
for the state Game and Fish Department. "But we are seeing some
declines in their population."</LD>
<TE>   The most recent surveys show that there are about 8,000 pronghorns
statewide, with about 2,000 of them in central Yavapai County.</TE>
<TE>   The antelope -- known for keen eyesight and running speed in
excess of 60 mph -- breed in August and September, with their
offspring usually born between late May and mid-June.</TE>
<TE>   "Most do have twins. For every 100 does, we would expect 175
fawns. That's quite a lot of babies," Gardner said. "In a normal
year, we'd like to see at least 30 of those fawns survive. This year,
we're seeing ratios of 4 or 5 per 100" in areas around Prescott,
Prescott Valley and Chino Valley.</TE>
<TE>   That's not enough to replace the adult mortality because wild
antelope usually only live six to eight years, according to experts.</TE>
<TE>   Some other pronghorn habitats also are hurting as Arizona copes
with its fourth year of drought.</TE>
<TE>   "The bottom line is rainfall influences the growth of forage and
the quality of forage," said Brian Wakeling, big game supervisor for
the Game and Fish Department. "The quality of milk the doe produces
for feeding her young is influenced by her diet. The lactating phase
takes a lot more energy than carrying the fetus. The drought
influences all of those factors."</TE>
<TE>   Gardner said drought conditions also amplify other problems for
the pronghorn -- predatory attacks from coyotes, loss of habitat and
lack of ground cover for hiding.</TE>
<TE>   Game and Fish crews calculate the pronghorn populations by doing
aerial surveys every June. This year's figures may not be finalized
until fall because the recent wildfire that scorched nearly 470,000
acres in eastern Arizona probably will delay surveys there.</TE>
<TE>   Gardner said the low survivor ratio in Yavapai County is offset by
last year's population boom, with a 70-fawn-per-100-doe ratio.</TE>
<TE>   "That goes a long way to counteracting this year's numbers," he
said. "The antelopes can quickly make up the loss in later years by
retaining more twins. And the drought situation readies us to do some
more management."</TE>
<TE>   Among the options is limiting hunting permits for the pronghorn,
altering fence lines so that the animals can move more freely for
food and forage, reverting juniper tree areas back to grasslands, and
transplanting some antelope to other locations.</TE>

<HD>Louisiana's Coastal Wetlands Sinking</HD>
<DH>Environment: Global warming and riverbed engineering put
New Orleans in peril.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MATT CRENSON</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER</BD>
<DL>ISLE DE JEAN CHARLES, La.</DL>
<LD>At the end of the road to Isle de Jean Charles, La., a patchwork of
dusty green salt grass and sparkling blue water extends untouched to
the horizon.</LD>
<LD>   Stilt-legged egrets wing the sky or stand frozen in the grass.
Occasionally, a fat mullet heaves itself out of the water and falls
back with a gentle plop.</LD>
<LD>   This beautiful vista is as sure a sign of ecological destruction
as the scraped, barren soil of a Superfund site.</LD>
<TE>   A few decades ago, Isle de Jean Charles was a patch of high ground
in a sea of grassy marsh teeming with catfish and crawdads. Today,
the small community is a true island, regularly flooded during storms
and sometimes even at high tide. In a few years, it will be submerged
completely.</TE>
<TE>   Deme Naquin, 75, remembers paddling a flat-bottomed pirogue to
school as a boy. Now he's getting ready to leave the only place he
has ever called home. The U.S. government has offered to resettle the
island's 270 residents because a new hurricane-protection plan leaves
them outside the ramparts.</TE>
<TE>   Some people want to stay. But Naquin and his family are ready to
take the government's offer.</TE>
<TE>   "Another hurricane and the road's going to be gone," says Chad
Naquin, Deme's 29-year-old grandson. "It would be hard to leave, but
in the long run, it would be the best thing."</TE>
<TE>   A widely publicized government report recently predicted that
sea-level rise caused by global warming could swallow sizable chunks
of the coastal United States in the coming century. In Louisiana,
that future is already here.</TE>
<TE>   Up to 35 square miles of Louisiana's wetlands sink into the Gulf
of Mexico each year. To date, an area the size of Rhode Island has
been lost. In some places, the coastline has retreated 30 miles.</TE>
<TE>   If scientists' global warming projections prove correct, virtually
every state along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts will have problems
similar to Louisiana's by the middle of the century. In a worst-case
scenario, sea level would be 44 inches higher 50 years from now. If
it is, 23,000 square miles of land along the Gulf and Atlantic coasts
will disappear.</TE>
<TE>   Low-lying cities such as Miami, Houston, Wilmington, N.C., and
Charleston, S.C., will face many of the same problems that New
Orleans grapples with today.</TE>
<TE>   Beyond the United States, low-lying coastal countries such as the
Netherlands, Bangladesh and the Bahamas stand to lose large swaths of
territory.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not going to be the only ones in the boat," says Al Naomi,
a project manager in the New Orleans District of the U.S. Army Corps
of Engineers. "We're just in the boat first."</TE>
<TE>   People have been messing with the landscape of southern Louisiana
for centuries, building ever-higher levees along the Mississippi and
its tributaries to protect themselves from floods. For the last 50
years, they have even redirected the flow of the river itself.</TE>
<TE>   The results have been catastrophic. South Louisiana requires a
constant supply of mud and freshwater to keep itself above sea level,
and channelizing the Mississippi River has deprived the landscape of
that vital resource.</TE>
<TE>   The Mississippi River literally built southern Louisiana, dropping
countless tons of mud at the edge of the continent to form a delta.
Over millenniums, the mud washed across the landscape during spring
floods, settling in swamps and marshes to nourish plant growth. Every
thousand years or so, the river changed course to fill in a nearby
low spot.</TE>
<TE>   Eventually the Mississippi built a broad swath of wetlands nearly
300 miles long. If you look at a map of the state, virtually
everything south of Interstate 10 was dropped there by the river.</TE>
<TE>   Now mud that would have settled into the swamps of the Atchafalaya
or Barataria Bay shoots out into the Gulf of Mexico, never to be seen
again. Meanwhile, the land is compacting, slowly turning to clay as
it sinks under its own weight and squishes itself dry.</TE>
<TE>   Sinking land due to mismanagement of the Mississippi River and
rising sea level caused by global warming work in tandem, erasing
Louisiana's coastal wetlands.</TE>
<TE>   The loss of coastal wetlands threatens to devastate the state's
fishing industry, worth $2.2 billion a year. Fish, crabs, shrimp and
other animals rely on wetlands as a nursery, where their young can
find plenty of food without exposing themselves to predators. By some
calculations, Louisiana's wetlands are involved in producing as much
as 40% of the seafood caught in the United States.</TE>
<TE>   "The biological productivity of the Barataria and Terrebone basins
alone dwarfs that of the Everglades, which our country is willing to
spend billions to restore," Ted Falgout says.</TE>
<TE>   Falgout is no rabid environmentalist, intent on saving every
square inch of marsh no matter what the cost. As executive director
of the Greater LaFourche Port Commission, he manages the country's
largest transportation hub for offshore oil and gas drilling. There
are 600 offshore drilling platforms within 40 miles of the port.</TE>
<TE>   The road connecting Port Fourchon to civilization, Louisiana Route
1, sits four feet above sea level for its final 18 miles. If a
hurricane were to wash it away, nearly 20% of the total U.S. oil
supply would be jeopardized. Gasoline prices might triple, Falgout
warns.</TE>
<TE>   More frightening to emergency planners is what a major hurricane
could do to New Orleans. High winds and low atmospheric pressure
actually raise sea level beneath and in front of a hurricane,
sometimes as much as 25 feet. In New Orleans, the only levees high
enough to stop a wall of water that big are along the Mississippi,
not around the city's perimeter.</TE>
<TE>   A direct hit to New Orleans by a hurricane with sustained winds
above 110 mph would overwhelm the city's ramparts, filling the city
with water as if it were a sinking canoe.</TE>
<TE>   This is far from an abstract threat. New Orleans residents who
were children in 1965 remember cowering in their homes during
Hurricane Betsy thinking they were going to die. Hurricane Camille,
one of the two strongest hurricanes ever to hit the United States,
struck Louisiana in 1969 but largely spared New Orleans.</TE>
<TE>   In 1992, Hurricane Andrew hit the sparsely inhabited Atchafalaya
basin but still caused significant damage. And in 1998, an evacuated
New Orleans was again spared when Hurricane Georges veered east.</TE>
<TE>   The Red Cross estimates that 25,000 to 100,000 people could die if
a major hurricane hit New Orleans. The relief agency is so
pessimistic about southern Louisiana's prospects in the face of a
major storm that it recently closed all of its relief centers south
of Interstate 10, which runs across the state from Lake Charles to
New Orleans. Why offer hurricane relief in an area that people are
better off abandoning in a hurricane?</TE>
<TE>   Ivor van Heerden, deputy director of the Louisiana State
University Hurricane Center, describes a horrific ordeal for anybody
unfortunate enough to be in the city when the hurricane hit.</TE>
<TE>   "If you survive the flying debris and your house collapsing," van
Heerden says, "then you're going to have to deal with a minimum of 13
feet of water."</TE>
<TE>   Because New Orleans essentially sits in a bowl ringed by its
protective levees, that water would stand around for weeks or months
until officials could find a way to breach a levee to drain it. The
stagnant pool would probably be contaminated with toxic waste from
the dozens of petrochemical plants that line the Mississippi, as well
as human waste and decomposing carcasses.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a $50-billion disaster," van Heerden says, surveying the
expensive new housing developments on the shores of Lake
Pontchartrain. "And in a month, we could have it."</TE>
<TE>   Experts agree that healthy coastal wetlands provide the best
defense against such a catastrophe. Marshes and swamps attenuate the
storm surge as it comes ashore, softening the blow to any cities
behind them. Experts differ on the exact figures, but a common rule
is that traversing 1.5 miles of wetlands diminishes a storm surge by
a foot.</TE>
<TE>   With 30 miles of wetlands lost in some parts of coastal Louisiana,
a storm like Hurricane Betsy would be far more destructive to New
Orleans today than it was nearly 40 years ago.</TE>
<TE>   "Without the wetlands," Naomi says ominously, "you're not going to
have the city."</TE>
<TE>   Some scientists believe that they can rebuild the wetlands by
further manipulating the Mississippi. A coalition of 11 state and
federal agencies has assembled a plan called Coast 2050 and is
lobbying the U.S. Congress to foot a major part of the $14-billion
price tag.</TE>
<TE>   Coast 2050 would divert Mississippi water into dying wetlands. It
would shore up barrier islands and plug canals that allow saltwater
to penetrate freshwater marshes. It proposes erosion control
projects, plantings to help establish new wetlands and breakwaters to
protect fragile coastlines.</TE>
<TE>   Its proponents say Coast 2050 will prevent another Rhode Island's
worth of wetlands from being washed away by the middle of this
century.</TE>
<TE>   But will it work?</TE>
<TE>   Van Heerden dismisses the plan as an unscientific "shopping list"
that doesn't sufficiently imitate the natural functions of the
Mississippi River system.</TE>
<TE>   "It was basically put together by bureaucrats," he says.</TE>
<TE>   And politics might prevent many of the Coast 2050 proposals from
ever being built. The Davis Pond diversion, a demonstration project
upstream of New Orleans, is still not operating almost 40 years after
it was first authorized. Fishermen who worried that freshwater
spilling into the marsh would ruin their catch filed lawsuits that
took years to settle, and local residents concerned about flooding
demanded design changes. Meanwhile, thousands of acres of wetlands
have been lost.</TE>
<TE>   In his SUV, cruising along Interstate 10 just inches above the
marsh, van Heerden surveys a landscape that is already below sea
level and envisions a bleak future.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a lesson for many other states that have coastal
wetlands," he says. "The problem, unfortunately, is only going to get
worse."</TE>

<HD>Inflammation Linked to Heart Attacks</HD>
<DH>Health: Doctors call discovery a departure from viewing top
killer as a plumbing problem blamed on cholesterol- clogged arteries.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DANIEL Q. HANEY</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER</BD>
<DL>BOSTON</DL>
<LD>Worse than cholesterol? Hard to believe, perhaps, but the top health
concern of millions of Americans is about to be trumped by what
doctors say is an even bigger trigger of heart attacks.</LD>
<LD>   The condition is low-grade inflammation, which may originate in a
variety of unlikely places throughout the body, including excess fat.
New federal recommendations are being written that will urge doctors
to test millions of middle-aged Americans for it.</LD>
<LD>   The discovery of its surprising ill effects is causing a
top-to-bottom rethinking of the origins and prevention of heart
trouble. Doctors call it a revolutionary departure from viewing the
world's top killer as largely a plumbing problem blamed on
cholesterol-clogged arteries, the standard theory through the modern
era of cardiology.</LD>
<TE>   "The implications of this are enormous," says Dr. Paul Ridker of
Boston's Brigham and Women's Hospital. "It means we have an entire
other way of treating, targeting and preventing heart disease that
was essentially missed because of our focus solely on cholesterol."</TE>
<TE>   In the last year or two, experts say, the evidence has become
overwhelming that inflammation hidden deep in the body is a common
trigger of heart attacks, even when clogging in the arteries is
minimal. Now the main question is: How aggressively should otherwise
healthy people be tested to find and treat it?</TE>
<TE>   The new recommendations are still being drawn up, but they will
offer the first formal blueprint to answer this, probably in the
fall. Doctors writing them say they will almost certainly recommend
broad testing.</TE>
<TE>   Inflammation can be measured with a generic $10 test that looks
for high levels of a chemical called C-reactive protein, one of many
that increase during inflammation. Experts expect it to quickly
become a standard part of physical exams. As a result, many people
ordinarily considered at low risk will probably be put on statin
drugs, which lower inflammation as well as cholesterol.</TE>
<TE>   No one disputes the importance of cholesterol, but half of all
heart attack victims have levels that are normal or even low.
Clearly, something big was missing from the equation and that appears
to be inflammation.</TE>
<TE>   Ridker estimates that between 25 million and 35 million healthy
middle-aged Americans have normal cholesterol but above-average
inflammation, putting them at unusual risk of heart attacks and
strokes.</TE>
<TE>   A series of landmark studies by his team, beginning in 1997,
suggest that inflammation is more important than cholesterol at
triggering heart attacks. They found those with high levels of
C-reactive protein have twice the risk of people with elevated
cholesterol.</TE>
<TE>   High amounts of the protein also predict increased risk of heart
attacks and strokes years before they occur, even when cholesterol
levels are low. Having both inflammation and high cholesterol
together is especially ominous, resulting in a ninefold increase in
risk.</TE>
<TE>   Everyone who reaches middle age has some degree of fatty buildup,
called plaque, in the heart arteries. The new evidence suggests that
it becomes threatening if weakened by inflammation, which makes it
squishy and fragile. Even a small lump of plaque can burst like an
overripe fruit, prompting formation of a clot that in turn chokes off
blood flow and causes a heart attack.</TE>
<TE>   Many people with no outward signs of anything wrong have high
levels of internal inflammation. It is exactly the same sort that
causes swelling, heat and redness during infections or allergic
rashes.</TE>
<TE>   Doctors believe that the internal inflammation has many possible
sources. Often, the plaque itself becomes inflamed as white blood
cells invade in a misguided defense attempt. But inflammation that
arises elsewhere apparently can be as bad, for it bombards the plaque
with damaging chemicals.</TE>
<TE>   For instance, fat cells churn out these inflammatory proteins,
which helps explain why being overweight is so bad for the heart.
Other possible triggers include high blood pressure, smoking and
lingering low-level infections, such as chronic gum disease.</TE>
<TE>   Although many chemicals increase during inflammation, C-reactive
protein is particularly easy to measure. Some already test for it,
including White House doctors, who checked President Bush's level
last summer. (His was extremely low.)</TE>
<TE>   In March, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the
American Heart Assn. held a meeting of 50 experts in Atlanta to
review the scientific evidence on inflammation and make
recommendations.</TE>
<TE>   These are still being discussed, but some doctors involved say
they will probably urge screening for people already considered at
mild to moderate risk of heart attacks. These include smokers and
those with a combination of other less ominous risks, such as being
middle-aged and having borderline high cholesterol or blood pressure.
For instance, they might recommend testing for a 45-year-old man with
cholesterol in the low 200s and blood pressure just below the cutoff
for treatment.</TE>
<TE>   However, others believe C-reactive protein should be measured in
everyone over age 40, just like cholesterol, regardless of other risk
factors.</TE>
<TE>   "It begins to look like a standard risk factor that one would
evaluate at least once in middle age in most people," says Dr. Wayne
Alexander of Emory University, a member of the recommendations
committee. "This is a very important concept for the general public
to be aware of and to think about for their own health."</TE>
<TE>   Doctors hope to have the recommendations ready for publication in
the journal Circulation in November, followed by a campaign to teach
doctors and ordinary people about it.</TE>
<TE>   "Our goal is to have a broad-based consensus and use all available
means to disseminate that information widely," says Dr. George
Mensah, the CDC's chief of cardiovascular health.</TE>
<TE>   Many hospitals can already do the test. However, until the
recommendations come out, most doctors are unlikely to know exactly
whom to test or what to make of the results. In fact, the White House
doctors who checked Bush had to call Ridker to figure out how to
interpret his numbers.</TE>
<TE>   C-reactive protein probably will not matter much for heart attack
survivors and others who already know that they have heart disease
since presumably doctors are already doing everything they can to
keep their condition from getting worse.</TE>
<TE>   "We believe the niche for C-reactive protein -- and it is a large
niche -- is the healthy population who want to do what they can to
lower their risk of cardiovascular disease," says Dr. Richard Cannon
of the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute.</TE>
<TE>   Screening is important because inflammation can be readily lowered
in several ways. One of the most powerful is losing weight. Exercise
also helps, as does moderate alcohol intake, giving up smoking and
lowering blood pressure.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, this amounts to the same healthy living advice that
doctors have long dispensed. But now they have a much better
understanding of why it works so well. Furthermore, they will
probably urge these habits on people with bad C-reactive protein
readings who until now would have seemed to be at no special risk of
heart problems.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the standard heart medicines also lower inflammation.
These include aspirin, Plavix, ACE inhibitors and the statin drugs,
such as Lipitor and Zocor.</TE>
<TE>   The statins are now prescribed to lower cholesterol, and they do
so dramatically. But studies have shown that they ward off heart
attacks much more powerfully than would be expected from their
effects on cholesterol alone. In fact, people with moderate
cholesterol seem to benefit just like those with readings off the
charts. Lowering inflammation probably explains why.</TE>
<TE>   Still, some important details remain to be settled. One is
population-wide data on C-reactive protein levels and their
connection to heart disease. Ridker is finishing a large study, to be
released later this year, that traces this relationship with readings
from tens of thousands of people.</TE>
<TE>   Another gap is rock-solid evidence that lowering inflammation
truly prevents heart attacks and saves lives. Ridker hopes to prove
this with a study to begin this fall that will compare statin drugs
and dummy pills in 15,000 middle-aged men and women with normal
cholesterol and above average C-reactive protein.</TE>
<TE>   The new thinking about inflammation "will change everything we do
in heart disease," says Dr. Eric Topol, cardiology chief at the
Cleveland Clinic.</TE>
<TE>   "In the last decade, people talked about their cholesterol levels.
In the next decade, the cocktail chatter will be, 'What's your
C-reactive protein?' Everyone will need to know that."</TE>

<HD>On Midway Atoll, Some 1 Million Gooney Birds Really Do Rule</HD>
<DH>Nature: About 1 million Laysan albatross call the islands
home.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>B.J. REYES</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER</BD>
<DL>MIDWAY ATOLL</DL>
<LD>No one seems to know exactly who came up with the name or when it
first was used, but they all seem to agree that it fits: gooney.</LD>
<LD>   As in gooney bird.</LD>
<LD>   More precisely, the Laysan albatross--about 1 million of which
call Midway Atoll home.</LD>
<TE>   "I suppose that [terminology] was during the military days," said
Tim Bodeen, the national wildlife refuge manager at Midway. "I
suppose they were kind of gooney."</TE>
<TE>   Like thousands of little statues, they dot every acre of the
landscape and transport visitors smack into what seems like a scene
from Alfred Hitchcock's "The Birds."</TE>
<TE>   These birds don't attack, but they don't seem to want to
budge--and they are quick to peck at a human's feet.</TE>
<TE>   Returning to Midway for the first time in almost two decades, Navy
Rear Adm. Anthony L. Winns made sure to give the birds their due:
"It's good to see that the gooney birds are still in charge here."</TE>
<TE>   Consider: One of the most prominent statues on the island doesn't
pay homage to the pivotal Battle of Midway, which was fought offshore
in June 1942 and proved to be the turning point in the Pacific during
World War II.</TE>
<TE>   It's a statue of a gooney bird--a 20-foot tall depiction of an
adult albatross situated in what once was one of the more
high-traffic areas at this former Navy outpost.</TE>
<TE>   Midway Atoll National Wildlife Refuge also is nesting ground for
14 other species of migratory seabirds and the endangered Hawaiian
monk seal.</TE>
<TE>   After more than two decades off the island, Richard Kelley
remembers the birds. He was a weather officer for the Navy and lived
on Midway's Sand Island with his wife and two young sons from
1976-78.</TE>
<TE>   Of his youngest son, who was about a year old: "He had really
blond hair--tiny birds used to try and attack him to try and get
nesting material."</TE>
<TE>   Kelley also remembers watching the gooneys learn to fly.
Albatrosses return to land only to breed, spending their whole life
flying over the ocean or on the water.</TE>
<TE>   "When the gooneys were learning how to fly, the youngsters, a lot
of them, would go out toward the beach and head into the wind and you
could watch them stumble," Kelley said. "They weren't too successful
the first couple times.</TE>
<TE>   "When the adults would come back landing on land for the first
time after a while, that would be interesting too."</TE>
<TE>   Adds Bodeen: "They're just kind of a funny bird to watch."</TE>

<HD>N.Y. Mayor Seeks Full Ban on Bar Smoking</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>The city said Friday that it will try to ban smoking in all bars and
restaurants by focusing on the potential health threat to hospitality
workers.</LD>
<LD>   Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg will ask the City Council next week to
outlaw smoking in the roughly 13,000 establishments not covered by
the current law, which permits smoking in bars and in restaurants
with fewer than 35 seats.</LD>
<LD>   It would be the second time in as many months that the Bloomberg
administration has targeted smokers; in July, it raised the cigarette
tax from 8 cents to $1.50 a pack.</LD>
<TE>   "If you are a bartender or a waiter or waitress and work in an
establishment where there is smoking, in an eight-hour day it's the
equivalent of you smoking half a pack of cigarettes yourself," said
Bloomberg, who quit smoking 18 years ago.</TE>
<TE>   "No employer would allow their employees to work in a place with
asbestos in the air," he said. "This is just as dangerous and that's
why we should stop it now."</TE>
<TE>   Elena Deutsch, director of tobacco control at the American Cancer
Society, said the mayor's proposal would protect workers.</TE>
<TE>   Not everyone shared their concern. "Being subjected to smoke is
part of my job," said bartender Tony Trincanello, leaning on an
ashtray-strewn counter at Milos' Greek restaurant in midtown
Manhattan.</TE>
<TE>   In July, the New York State Restaurant Assn. dropped its
long-standing opposition to the current smoking law after a survey
showed most members were in favor of it.</TE>
<TE>   The association will now poll members about whether they support a
full ban on smoking, said E. Charles Hunt, executive vice president
of an association chapter.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not going to happen," Trincanello said. "There is too much
politics from restaurant owners and the fear of losing customers."</TE>
<TE>   "You have the right to do what you want," chimed in lunchtime
patron Nicky Polak, a social smoker who believes smoking should be
allowed in the bar area.</TE>
<TE>   Brendan McCormick, a spokesman for Philip Morris, said the company
supports "reasonable restrictions" but thinks "business owners should
have the flexibility in how they deal with smoking in their
establishments."</TE>
<TE>   Bloomberg pointed to California as proof that there would be no
economic loss. "All of the evidence suggests that in California,
where they did this, that actually the patronage of restaurants and
bars--the amount of money spent in them--goes up, not down."</TE>
<TE>   Most states have some level of restrictions on public smoking. In
addition to California, Delaware and several municipalities,
including El Paso, Texas, enforce total bans in bars and restaurants.</TE>
<TE>   Maine, Utah and Vermont ban smoking in restaurants but not bars.</TE>

<HD>Bringing Back the Forest With the Trees</HD>
<DH>Wilderness: U.S. Fish &amp; Wildlife Service staff wants to
restore the Ohio River refuge, long harmed by development, and lure
back the birds that once thrived.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>VICKI SMITH</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER</BD>
<DL>MIDDLE ISLAND, W.Va.</DL>
<LD>From the shade of a 10-by-10 bird-watching shelter, Matt Connolly
studies a painter's palette of plant life: lavender thistle,
wheat-colored barnyard grass, rust-red smartweed and snow-white
chamomiles sway among various shades of green.</LD>
<LD>   "Yeah, it's pretty," he says with a shrug. "And yeah, people like
wide-open spaces. But it should be forests."</LD>
<LD>   Connolly, deputy manager of the Ohio River Islands National
Wildlife Refuge, is less interested in protecting what is than
restoring what was. Hundreds of years ago, this 235-acre island was
covered with trees, their branches heavy with birds.</LD>
<TE>   Today, trees ring only the outer edges of what has become a vast
meadow -- land stripped down by a century of farming and a factory
that made marbles. Birds still feed on tangles of blackberry and
grape vines, but their numbers are fewer and the species have
changed.</TE>
<TE>   Connolly and the rest of his U.S. Fish &amp; Wildlife Service staff
want to rebuild the forests and lure back the creatures that once
thrived. The cerulean warbler with its brilliant blue hues. The
prothonotary warbler, feathered in gold, orange and green.</TE>
<TE>   Here, history is the goal.</TE>
<TE>   Middle Island is among 22 islands that, in whole or in part, make
up the refuge. Created in 1990, the network encompasses more than
3,200 acres of fish and wildlife habitat in one of the nation's
busiest industrial waterways.</TE>
<TE>   Fish &amp; Wildlife plans to acquire 13 more islands along a 400-mile
stretch of the river between Shippingport, Pa., and Maysville, Ky.,
eventually linking some 12,000 acres of flood-plain forests, wetlands
and aquatic habitat.</TE>
<TE>   The latest addition is Fish Creek Island, a forested, 48-acre
great blue heron rookery that remains relatively undisturbed. Consol
Energy donated the island near Moundsville to the Nature Conservancy,
which will turn it over to the refuge.</TE>
<TE>   In the early 1900s, Fish Creek Island was tapped for oil and
natural gas. Later, power lines were erected there. Consol bought it
in 1956 with coal-mining plans that never materialized.</TE>
<TE>   'A Natural Fit'</TE>
<TE>   "We felt this was a wonderful thing that Fish &amp; Wildlife was
doing, trying to capture all those islands and restore them.... It
was a natural fit for us," says Consol spokesman Joseph Cerenzia.</TE>
<TE>   A total of 193 bird species have been found on the islands, 76 of
which breed there. The refuge is also home to 500 plant species, 101
kinds of fish and 42 varieties of mollusk, including the endangered
pink mucket and fanshell mussels.</TE>
<TE>   But on many islands, threats abound.</TE>
<TE>   Native plants are choked out by fast-growing invasive species that
were brought in to control erosion and then took over.</TE>
<TE>   As many as 40 plants trouble Middle Island, including Japanese
knotweed and multiflora rose. Japanese honeysuckle, which starts
photosynthesis months before native plants, wraps itself around trees
from top to bottom. That makes it hard to destroy one without
destroying the other.</TE>
<TE>   The same goes for mussels, which flourish in shallow water and now
face a double threat: Vanishing habitat and the prolific,
all-consuming zebra mussel, which immigrated to the Ohio by attaching
itself to barges and boats.</TE>
<TE>   Native mussels have long been in peril from over-harvesting.
Enterprising fishermen sold the meat first, then the shiny interior
shell for mother-of-pearl buttons. They crushed what was left to make
seed pearls for oysters.</TE>
<TE>   Then the river changed.</TE>
<TE>   Once shallow enough to wade across and navigable only during
certain seasons, it's now 30 feet deep in the channel. Instead of
riffles, it is a series of deep lakes controlled by locks and dams.</TE>
<TE>   Before private companies began dredging the Ohio River for sand
and gravel, erosion was natural. The foundation of an island
gradually washed from head to tail, wearing down at one end, building
up at the other and slowly migrating.</TE>
<TE>   Now, the eroded material drifts to a hole in the river. The
islands aren't moving. They are shrinking.</TE>
<TE>   "It's the case frequently that people's livelihoods overtake the
environment," Connolly says. "It's a losing battle unless we can do
some kind of protection."</TE>
<TE>   Short of a ban on dredging, little can be done. Refuge managers
could stabilize the islands with riprap, but the large rock would
destroy the shallow mussel habitat.</TE>
<TE>   "The islands are going the way of the dodo," Connolly says.
"They're disappearing."</TE>
<TE>   Middle is the only island among the 22 that is accessible by car,
just a short steel bridge away from the town of St. Marys.</TE>
<TE>   Although the refuge is open to runners, bow hunters, photographers
and cyclists, not everyone is a fan.</TE>
<TE>   Trappers and raccoon hunters with packs of dogs are banned. So are
all-terrain vehicles. Anglers who once spent their evenings reeling
in catfish can no longer come after dark.</TE>
<TE>   "Our refuge has its share of controversy," Connolly says. "They
all do."</TE>
<TE>   Next year is the centennial of the U.S. refuge system, and
Connolly is hoping to obtain extra funding for a special project. He
wants to restore a 7- to 10-acre section of wetlands ruined when a
farmer installed curved tiles to drain excess water from his crops.</TE>
<TE>   Connolly hopes to locate and pull those tiles, put down a layer of
clay, and allow the low-lying area to fill back in and remain flooded
year-round. That would allow wetland plants and native frogs to
reestablish themselves.</TE>
<TE>   To rebuild the forests, Connolly and his staff collect seeds every
fall and ship them to the National Tree Trust, which grows plants
over the winter. In the spring, volunteers help plant the seedlings.</TE>
<TE>   Upset by Industry</TE>
<TE>   When he thinks of most coal companies and other extraction-based
industries, Connolly grows irritated. Too often, he says, their idea
of reclaiming the land is to plant tall grass and argue that it's for
migratory songbirds.</TE>
<TE>   "They say, 'We're creating habitat for grassland birds,' and they
are. That's great, but this is traditionally a habitat for birds that
need forests," he says. "They're saying, 'We're creating
biodiversity,' but that's not the way the word was intended. If they
want to define it that way, well, the San Diego Zoo is the most
diverse place on earth.</TE>
<TE>   "This was core habitat for birds like the cerulean warbler. Where
is the habitat for them? Who's creating that?" Connolly asks. "The
prairie states need to create more grasslands. We need to create more
forests."</TE>

<HD>Preservationists Strive to Save Schools Built of Altruism</HD>
<DH>History: In the early 1900s, Julius Rosenwald funded more
than 5,000 institutions to educate Southern blacks. Former students
seek to restore his legacy.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAY REEVES</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER</BD>
<DL>PINE LEVEL, Ala.</DL>
<LD>The dusty floors and sagging walls of the old Mount Sinai Junior High
School are a rickety reminder of a time when blacks were castoffs in
the segregated South and one man tried to help.</LD>
<LD>   The building is a "Rosenwald school," named for Julius T.
Rosenwald, the Chicago philanthropist who helped build Mount Sinai
and more than 5,000 similar schools throughout the rural South with
millions of dollars in donations in the early 1900s.</LD>
<LD>   Located in 15 states, the schools--built at the suggestion of
Tuskegee University founder Booker T. Washington -- provided an
education for untold numbers of Southern blacks who might not have
had one otherwise.</LD>
<TE>   Nearly all the schools had closed by the 1960s as rural schools
were consolidated and integration spread.</TE>
<TE>   Many were razed, some were converted to homes, barns or community
centers, and others were left to fall apart.</TE>
<TE>   Today, former students and historic preservationists are working
to save the remaining pieces of Rosenwald's legacy after decades of
neglect.</TE>
<TE>   The nonprofit National Trust for Historic Preservation included
Rosenwald schools on its list in June of the most endangered historic
places in America, and state preservation agencies across the region
are trying to locate the buildings in hopes of refurbishing at least
some.</TE>
<TE>   The most intense interest is among one-time students of the
schools.</TE>
<TE>   Mack Houser belongs to a group raising money to refurbish Mount
Sinai, which operated from 1919 to 1967 about 20 miles north of
Montgomery.</TE>
<TE>   The school, which housed about 90 students in grades one through
nine, is the last of six Rosenwald schools that were once in Autauga
County.</TE>
<TE>   Houser remembers sweating through the stifling Alabama heat when
he attended Mount Sinai for about 10 years beginning in 1942. He
gathered sticks to feed the school's four potbellied stoves in the
winter.</TE>
<TE>   All but one of the stoves remain in the old four-classroom school,
along with dozens of hardwood desks, the original piano and shelves
full of books, including an English literature text dated 1926.</TE>
<TE>   "It would have been much different without Rosenwald," said
Houser, standing in a classroom with 12-foot ceilings, thick plank
paneling and a musty smell. Weeds snake inside through a hole in the
siding.</TE>
<TE>   "We had to memorize a lot of things: songs, history, pledges, some
Scripture," said Zenobia Faye Marshall, who graduated from the school
in 1961. "We've got doctors, lawyers and all kinds of professional
people who came from here."</TE>
<TE>   The early school had no electricity or plumbing, just big windows
and outhouses.</TE>
<TE>   Each school adjoined land for gardens, and all offered industrial
education and home economics. Standard plans and color schemes were
used.</TE>
<TE>   Although Rosenwald schools are considered endangered in general,
no one is sure how many still exist, said Hap Connors of the National
Trust.</TE>
<TE>   "The first step in the [restoration] process is to identify how
many there are," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Of 389 Rosenwald schools built in Alabama, the state knows of
fewer than 20 still standing. Of 25 built around Charlotte, N.C.,
only four remain. One is still used as a community center.</TE>
<TE>   "I would be amazed if it were much above that in any state
percentage-wise," said Tom Hanchett, staff historian at the Levine
Museum of the New South in Charlotte.</TE>
<TE>   The success of the schools' design is making it harder for
historians to identify true Rosenwald buildings--because about 11,000
schools for whites were constructed using the same blueprints.</TE>
<TE>   The son of Jewish German immigrants, Rosenwald was president of
Sears, Roebuck &amp; Co. and helped build the chain into a retailing
giant. He struck up a friendship with Washington and gave $25,000 in
1912 to help black colleges like Tuskegee, located in east Alabama.</TE>
<TE>   Washington persuaded Rosenwald to let some of the money be used as
grants for schools in rural black areas, many of which had no
schools.</TE>
<TE>   The donations continued and grew, and Rosenwald had given $4.2
million to help build about 5,300 schools by 1932. Rosenwald grants
had to be matched by communities where schools were to be built, and
blacks donated some $4.7 million.</TE>
<TE>   "It's important to note that black people gave more to build these
schools than he did," said Rosenwald's grandson, Peter Ascoli of
Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   Local governments also gave money for the buildings, which were
public schools. The problem was that white-controlled school boards
rarely gave the schools more money once they opened, leaving them
with old books and few resources.</TE>
<TE>   "Over time, they were seriously second-rate," said Hanchett, who
is working on the Rosenwald preservation project with the National
Trust.</TE>
<TE>   Although some philanthropies shied away from giving money to
educate Southern blacks for fear of offending whites, Ascoli said,
Rosenwald was undeterred.</TE>
<TE>   "He didn't really care about that. He just felt he should go
ahead," Ascoli said.</TE>
<TE>   There was other resistance, though. The Ku Klux Klan opposed
construction of Rosenwald schools in some areas, and a school in
Arkansas was burned down in a blaze allegedly set by klansmen, only
to be rebuilt using brick.</TE>
<TE>   "They didn't have much luck," said Peter Mansell, of the Historic
Beaufort Foundation in Beaufort, S.C.</TE>
<TE>   At Mount Sinai, organizers recently received a state grant of
$18,600 to do additional restoration work. The roof and some window
frames have already been replaced using earlier donations totaling
about $20,000.</TE>
<TE>   Houser would like to get a new coat of white paint on the old
school and repair more windows. The school is listed on the National
Register of Historic Places, so any work must be historically
accurate.</TE>

<HD>Odds Favor Controlling Smallpox Attack</HD>
<DH>Health: Computer models show that the proper combination
of vaccination, quarantine and other measures could halt the disease.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MATT CRENSON</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Imaginative minds can conjure horribly apocalyptic consequences from
a smallpox attack.</LD>
<LD>   Here is a disease that kills 30% of those it infects and leaves
survivors permanently scarred.</LD>
<LD>   After plaguing humanity for centuries, it was finally eradicated
three decades ago so that no one today has any built-up immunity to
it. The smallpox vaccinations some people had as children would no
longer be effective. Unchecked, smallpox has the potential to sweep
through the United States population like the plagues of medieval
Europe.</LD>
<TE>   But with the help of computers, many researchers are concluding
that a smallpox attack by terrorists need not produce an
uncontrollable public health crisis. Computer simulations show that
the proper combination of post-attack vaccination, quarantine and
other public health measures could stop smallpox in its tracks:</TE>
<TE>   * A model designed by researchers from the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention found that vaccination and quarantine could
stop an outbreak within a year and limit the number of smallpox cases
to 4,200--even if 1,000 people were directly infected by terrorists.</TE>
<TE>   * Researchers from Yale University and the Massachusetts Institute
of Technology found through another simulation that a massive
vaccination program launched as soon as the first smallpox cases were
detected could quickly stop the disease from spreading and limit
infections to fewer than two times the initial number.</TE>
<TE>   * By simulating the daily comings and goings of people in
Portland, Ore., researchers from Los Alamos National Laboratory found
that reasonable public health measures, combined with people's
natural tendency to stay home when they're feeling sick, would likely
limit the spread of smallpox after an attack.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's apparent that we can control an outbreak of smallpox
if we do the right thing," said Stephen Eubank, a researcher in the
Basic and Applied Simulation Science Group at Los Alamos.</TE>
<TE>   The simulations are much like those computer games where you play
the mayor of a growing city. The choices you make about zoning
regulations, tax rates and other issues determine whether your city
prospers or collapses into blight.</TE>
<TE>   With the smallpox models, you make decisions about whom to
vaccinate and quarantine. You decide what to tell the public and
when. Then the computer calculates how the disease will spread
through the population, illustrating how different strategies might
pan out.</TE>
<TE>   "No one can predict the future," said Tara O'Toole, director of
the Center for Civilian Biodefense at Johns Hopkins University.
"Models can help us imagine it and maybe help us respond."</TE>
<TE>   The Los Alamos model, for example, replicates the daily life of
every single person in Portland to see how trips to school, work,
malls and the like would spread smallpox through the community.</TE>
<TE>   Portland residents needn't fear that Big Brother is watching--Los
Alamos researchers use census data and anonymous questionnaires to
generalize people's daily comings and goings, not actual
surveillance.</TE>
<TE>   Eubank and his colleagues originally designed the program to help
planners envision how changes in Portland's transportation system
would affect residents' ability to move around the city. By adding a
smallpox transmission model, Eubank has created a simulation of how
the disease moves too.</TE>
<TE>   He starts the simulation by giving a specific group of people
smallpox. It could be a dozen shoppers at a particular mall or a
handful of infected terrorists who set about trying to pass their
illness to other people. Then he sees how the movements of those
initially infected people spread the disease in the population.</TE>
<TE>   Eubank can also change people's behaviors based on how they feel.
For example, he said, "when you contract smallpox, you get sick as a
dog. It happens about the time you become contagious."</TE>
<TE>   The Los Alamos model simulates that by keeping many of the most
contagious people home, not out infecting their friends and
co-workers. In a smallpox outbreak, if authorities could convince
those who felt sick to stay home--perhaps by promising a house call
from an infectious disease specialist, Eubank said--many fewer people
would be infected.</TE>
<TE>   The surest way to prevent a smallpox attack from killing more than
a handful of people would be to vaccinate the majority of the
population in advance. But the protection offered by widespread
vaccination would come at a serious cost.</TE>
<TE>   The smallpox vaccine is one of the most dangerous ever used. It
can cause life-threatening complications in people with eczema and
compromised immune systems, and it kills about one person in a
million. Given to the entire U.S. population, smallpox vaccine could
kill nearly 300 people and permanently injure thousands more.</TE>
<TE>   Models show that pre-vaccinating the public isn't necessary,
however. If there were a system in place to vaccinate everyone in a
city at the first appearance of smallpox, said Edward Kaplan of Yale
University, an outbreak could be stopped in a few weeks.</TE>
<TE>   In the hypothetical case of a smallpox attack that initially
infected 1,000 people, a model designed by Kaplan and colleagues from
MIT calculated that mass vaccination would limit the number of
casualties to 1,830 illnesses and 560 deaths in a city of 10 million.</TE>
<TE>   Some people would suffer serious complications from the
vaccinations, and about 10 would die. But in the face of a potential
smallpox epidemic, Kaplan believes that the odds would almost always
favor mass vaccination over a less aggressive approach.</TE>
<TE>   Other strategies, such as vaccinating only the close relatives and
contacts of infected people, would be superior only if the number of
people infected by the initial attack were fewer than a couple dozen
or if smallpox were significantly less infectious than his model
assumes.</TE>
<TE>   But it's exactly that assumption, and many others, that public
health officials should consider before using models to help
determine their policies, said Martin I. Meltzer, an epidemiological
modeler at the CDC.</TE>
<TE>   "I think there's a lot of innovative thought behind it," Meltzer
said of Kaplan's model. "I just think there are some assumptions that
we might question."</TE>

<HD>New Federal Parks a Monument to the Changing West</HD>
<DH>Environment: Creation of Grand Staircase-Escalante casts
shadow over land debate and affects way of life for region's
residents. It's just the tip of the iceberg.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN HEILPRIN</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER</BD>
<DL>ESCALANTE, Utah</DL>
<LD>Hardy critters like the Kanab ambersnail, the Southwestern willow
flycatcher and retired farmer Melvin Alvey are drawn to the red rock
desert by an austerity furrowed by wind and water and a stillness
blessed by what isn't here.</LD>
<LD>   Alvey, 94, however, bemoans the changes taking place -- the
biggest ones since Mormons began settling here in 1875 -- simply
because the vast acreage that is his backyard has a new name: Grand
Staircase-Escalante National Monument.</LD>
<LD>   "At one time, everybody had a little bunch of cattle and a farm,"
he explains with the help of an oxygen cylinder and occasional
interjections from Florence, his wife of nearly 50 years. "It was
just like a big family. Everybody cared for everybody and helped
them. Now, why, it's altogether different."</LD>
<TE>   As dominant as the 1.9-million-acre monument is in southern Utah,
Grand Staircase-Escalante casts an even larger shadow over the debate
on use of federal lands. It is a prototype for other vast land
monuments being planned and, to Western Republicans, a symbol of
federal intrusion.</TE>
<TE>   President Clinton six years ago invoked the 1906 Antiquities Act
to "maintain the unspoiled nature" of the desert swath nearly the
size of Delaware and Rhode Island combined. It took no action from
Congress or consultation with Utah officials.</TE>
<TE>   Before leaving office, Clinton designated another 3.7 million
acres as national monuments, making them off-limits to mining,
logging, grazing and other potentially damaging uses.</TE>
<TE>   Western Republicans do not want any more presidents to enjoy that
power. For weeks, they have searched for votes in the House to pass a
bill specifying that any presidential declaration of a monument would
expire in two years if Congress does not approve it.</TE>
<TE>   The Bush administration is sending mixed signals on what it wants
to do with such areas. On the one hand, it is moving to allow oil and
gas drilling on federal land near Arches and Canyonlands national
parks in Utah despite protests from some park rangers and government
scientists. But it also began studying in May whether to create
another national monument at Utah's San Rafael Swell, north of
Escalante.</TE>
<TE>   With a nod to Escalante, Interior Secretary Gale Norton kicked off
the process of writing land-management plans in April for half of the
22 monuments that Clinton created or expanded. She emphasizes
gathering local opinion, a step that critics of the Clinton
administration say was not emphasized enough before.</TE>
<TE>   "In some areas, there are existing uses that need to be taken into
account. In other areas, there may be a fairly quick shift to a
tourist type of economy," Norton said in an interview. "Some of the
areas are fairly receptive to that idea. Other areas view the
monument design as an intrusion on their traditional lifestyles."</TE>
<TE>   There is no doubt that the traditional way of life in Escalante is
giving way to tourist dollars. Former Grand Canyon guides Drew and
Julia Cozby opened Escalante Outback Adventures, lured by the
monument's newfound fame. Tom Mansell pulled up stakes in Ipswich,
Mass., to build Escalante's Grand Staircase Bed &amp; Breakfast Inn,
drawn by the chance to get in on what he calls "the ground floor" of
a new economy.</TE>
<TE>   Tensions between old and new surface sometimes at town meetings.</TE>
<TE>   "I can remember one woman saying that we need new jobs, but we
don't want our kids flipping burgers and serving ice cream," Mansell
said. "I said to that woman, 'Unless you get out and do something,
you're going to be working for me, flipping my burgers and serving my
ice cream, because you don't want to get out and take a chance.'
They've been entrenched so long in doing the same thing that they're
afraid."</TE>
<TE>   In nearby Boulder, the largest employer is now an upscale organic
restaurant, Hell's Backbone Grill, which targets affluent travelers
on the grounds of equally chic Boulder Mountain Lodge.</TE>
<TE>   Co-owners Jen Castle and Blake Campbell, both Buddhists and
transplants from Flagstaff, Ariz., emphasize locally produced food,
pay their staff of 27 higher wages than most other jobs in town and
try to impart new skills too.</TE>
<TE>   Their reception in the Mormon town was initially frosty, but their
style of business and tasty regional cuisine bridged cultural gaps.
Even Garfield County Commissioner Dell LeFevre, one of the few
remaining cattle ranchers in the area, is a regular.</TE>
<TE>   "For us, if the monument didn't exist, we couldn't do what we're
doing. We need a certain kind of people who come to Boulder for the
style of food we're doing," Campbell said.</TE>
<TE>   LeFevre, who has 14 adopted children to worry about, says he
considers himself a cowboy and an environmentalist. He agreed to swap
grazing rights with an environmental land trust to protect 18,000
acres of the upper Escalante River.</TE>
<TE>   Still, he says, he is $1 million in debt--a quarter of that from
adoptions--but he blames depressed beef prices and extended drought
more than the new grazing restrictions.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't blame the monument for everything. I'd like to," said
LeFevre, flashing a sly grin, "but you can't." Moments later, he
added more somberly: "I see my world going away."</TE>

<HD>School in an Orchard the Apple of Their Eyes</HD>
<DH>Education: Students home-taught in idyllic classroom go on
to elite universities. Tenets include, 'Shoes are not worn in the
classroom.'</DH>

<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER</BD>
<DL>PRINCETON, N.J.</DL>
<LD>Once-in-a-lifetime experiences come around a little more often for
Lillian B. Pierce.</LD>
<LD>   At 21, she delivered the valedictory address at Princeton
University flanked by baseball legend Cal Ripken Jr., renowned AIDS
researcher Anthony S. Fauci and talk show queen Oprah Winfrey.</LD>
<LD>   Her summer job? Manipulating codes for the National Security
Agency. She can't say whether she's making or breaking codes. It's
top secret.</LD>
<TE>   Then Pierce, a Rhodes Scholar, heads to England's Oxford
University.</TE>
<TE>   But when she reflects on her favorite experience, the one she
would most like to relive, her mind drifts past these honors and
famous names to the one-room schoolhouse her father built in their
Southern California orchard.</TE>
<TE>   The only teacher -- her mother -- started each school day singing,
encouraged note-passing and never assigned homework or grades.</TE>
<TE>   And Lillian "Lilly Bee" Pierce was hardly the exception from the
Alice Adams White School. All seven students who studied amid the
lush pomegranate, citrus and apricot trees went on to elite colleges,
including three Ivy League universities and, now, Oxford.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "Shoes are not worn in the classroom. It is pleasant to have
slippers of some sort, but socks are perfectly comfortable."</TE>
<TE>   -- Alice Adams White School prospectus.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A serpentine path winds through the Fallbrook, Calif., garden,
leading to a shingled building with tall windows and vaulted
ceilings. One wall is done in river rock; Japanese maples grow out
front.</TE>
<TE>   Oak desks and a rectangular seminar table furnish the single room.
A Vermeer print hangs over a stone fireplace, and black-and-white
tiles underfoot mimic the patterned floor in the painting.</TE>
<TE>   "It's an open, pleasant place for six people to be exposed to the
best things I can think to offer them," said Elizabeth "Libby"
Pierce, a certified teacher who opened the school in 1989.</TE>
<TE>   The Alice Adams White School -- or AAWS, pronounced "Oz" --
enrolled 10 students before it closed in 1994, a few only briefly;
it's reopening this fall.</TE>
<TE>   Named for her husband's teacher-grandmother, the school began as
Libby Pierce's answer for her two youngest children.</TE>
<TE>   Lilly Bee knew long division by age 4 and her younger brother,
Marshall, pored over a science reference manual at age 3. When a
kindergarten teacher asked him to draw a stick figure, he frowned
over its missing esophagus and spleen.</TE>
<TE>   "I just thought, 'Oh, I'd better do something different,' " Libby
recalls.</TE>
<TE>   She and her husband, Michael, considered starting a larger school
elsewhere, and even bought the land. But they realized that zoning
requirements would be easier to meet with a smaller school in their
yard.</TE>
<TE>   On drafting paper, Libby sketched a schoolhouse with everything
she wanted and Michael, a builder, made it happen. AAWS opened when
Lilly Bee was 9 and Marshall 6.</TE>
<TE>   School days were rigorous but idyllic. Traditional subjects such
as math and composition joined watercolors and five foreign
languages: Japanese, German, Spanish, French and Latin.</TE>
<TE>   On hot days, students sprawled on the floor as Libby read aloud.</TE>
<TE>   They published a weekly newspaper, "Wizard's Weekly Words." Every
sixth week, they staged a play--Shakespeare, Shaw or similar fare.</TE>
<TE>   "It doesn't seem possible now, all the things we fit into a day or
a week," said Alexandra Lyon, 20, who will be a junior at Smith
College.</TE>
<TE>   The absence of tests, homework and grades should not be mistaken
for a lack of structure, she said.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't exactly have homework, except that our entire lives
were part of the school," she said. "Which isn't to say that we
didn't have free time. It's just that we liked being there so much
that everything we did had some connection to AAWS."</TE>
<TE>   The school operated until Lilly Bee reached high school age and
Libby feared that she had reached her limit as a math and science
teacher.</TE>
<TE>   The Pierce children eventually landed at a community college.
Their classmates went to public schools.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "It is a school which reflects my views, aspirations and hopes
combined with concessions to the possible; its strengths and
limitations reflect only my own."</TE>
<TE>   -- Libby Pierce in the AAWS prospectus.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Libby learned educational theory while attending graduate school
at UCLA, where she also earned a bachelor's in English and her
teacher certification. Her research continued after her children were
born.</TE>
<TE>   The structure and curriculum of the school in her orchard do not
fit any category she studied but rather represent "my own best guess
as to what I ought to be doing," she said.</TE>
<TE>   She apparently guessed well. Several AAWS alumni consider the
school their most significant educational experience.</TE>
<TE>   Kent Cazimir Liske, 20, who will be a junior at Dartmouth, said
the number and breadth of topics undertaken showed him how big the
world was.</TE>
<TE>   He learned at his own pace, was able to ask questions without
fear, and stopped seeing grades or test scores as the ultimate
reward.</TE>
<TE>   "For someone else to evaluate your work, it can often give you
false impressions of your progress and the value of your work," he
said. "If you can't find value in your work by yourself, then what is
it worth at all?"</TE>
<TE>   Laura Derrick, president of the National Home Education Network,
said that is precisely the goal of home schools or very small
schools. She was not specifically acquainted with AAWS.</TE>
<TE>   "If you can help them find that, then you are going to have
someone who loves learning and goes for all the opportunities in
front of them," said Derrick, a mother of two home-schoolers in
Austin, Texas. "That can change the course of a whole education."</TE>
<TE>   AAWS students suppose their own abilities and their families'
commitment to education played a large role in their academic
success.</TE>
<TE>   But in the end, they said, the school was Libby Pierce.</TE>
<TE>   "It's just absolutely interconnected," said Nasreen Yazdani, 21,
who graduated from Smith. "Libby really revolutionized my idea of
what a teacher was."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "AAWS is reopening in the fall of 2002 after an eight-year hiatus.
The goal of providing an atypical education for six children from
unusual families remains intact."</TE>
<TE>   -- AAWS prospectus.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Maybe her cartwheels aren't as crisp as they once were, but Libby
Pierce still turns them at 56.</TE>
<TE>   And with her youngest leaving for college, she has decided to
channel her energy into a new class of the orchard school.</TE>
<TE>   She was partly motivated by a desire to help finance Marshall's
years at Harvey Mudd College. AAWS tuition is $7,000 a year, although
Libby said the Pierces are years from recouping the money invested in
the school.</TE>
<TE>   The more Libby thought about reopening AAWS, the more the idea
intrigued her. Could she rely on original sources more than
textbooks? What would it be like to finally teach only other people's
children?</TE>
<TE>   The new students are already getting to know their teacher. In
June, Libby held a workshop on folk-inspired and percussion
instruments.</TE>
<TE>   "The new set of AAWSians, they don't think they want to do
theater," Libby said. "But they will. I'm going to make sure they
do."</TE>
<TE>   This fall, children will again take their places in the
custom-made desks.</TE>
<TE>   Libby plans to affix a small brass plate to each desk inscribed
with the names of each student who ever sat there.</TE>
<TE>   For the new students, AAWS is just beginning.</TE>
<TE>   For their predecessors, it never really ended.</TE>

<HD>Land-Management Plans in the Works</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>During his two terms, President Clinton created 19 monuments and
expanded three others, putting more than 5.6 million acres under
protection. Congress also created one.</LD>
<LD>   Most of the new monuments are managed by the Interior Department's
Bureau of Land Management under its National Landscape Conservation
System, another Clinton brainchild created in June 2000.</LD>
<LD>   The little-known system rivals the National Park Service as
caretaker for many of the nation's most rugged landscapes: monuments,
conservation areas, wilderness areas, wilderness study areas, wild
and scenic rivers, and national scenic and historic trails.</LD>
<TE>   In April, Interior Secretary Gale Norton began the process of
creating land management plans for 11 monuments that Clinton created
or expanded: Arizona's Agua Fria, Grand Canyon-Parashant, Vermillion
Cliffs, Ironwood Forest and Sonoran Desert; California's California
Coastal and Carrizo Plain; Colorado's Canyon of the Ancients; Idaho's
Craters of the Moon; Montana's Upper Missouri River Breaks, and
Oregon's Cascade-Siskiyou.</TE>
<TE>   The Interior Department had begun planning how to manage Santa
Rosa and San Jacinto Mountains in California.</TE>
<TE>   Next year, it will start work on management plans for Pompey's
Pillar in Montana and Kasha-Katuwe Tent Rocks in New Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   Environmental groups say some of these new monuments face
immediate threats such as seismic "thumper" trucks scraping sandstone
and crushing fragile desert vegetation while searching for oil
deposits. They also bemoan efforts in Congress to reduce their
acreage.</TE>
<TE>   BLM officials say oil and gas development will be an issue at
Colorado's Canyon of the Ancients, which has significant reserves,
although 85% of the monument already is under lease for drilling.</TE>
<TE>   Other issues at some of the newly created monuments are threats of
vandalism at prehistoric sites and on- and off-road vehicles within
an easy day's drive of urban areas, such as Agua Fria near Phoenix
and Ironwood Forest near Tucson.</TE>

<HD>Locals Hope to Trim Timberland Sale</HD>
<DH>Montana: Company intends to sell homesites for $1.6 million
each. Environmentalists, sportsmen, even loggers object to area's
transformation.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MATT GOURAS</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER</BD>
<DL>CONDON, Mont.</DL>
<LD>A cool $1.6 million can buy you a nice piece of land here -- 160
acres bordering the Bob Marshall Wilderness, in the shadow of
towering Rocky Mountain peaks. But it might not buy many friends
among the locals.</LD>
<LD>   From loggers to environmentalists, it seems few of Swan River
Valley's 800 residents are happy with plans by Plum Creek Timber Co.
to sell about 20,000 of its 80,000 acres in the Swan River Valley of
northwestern Montana.</LD>
<LD>   It is part of a companywide plan to sell off expensive timberland
as residential property, then use the cash to buy less scenic but
cheaper timberland elsewhere.</LD>
<TE>   "We think it's a horrible precedent to take some of the most
highly productive timberland in Montana out of production, remove
that from the timber economy and put it into real estate
development," Melanie Parker said. "We're not talking about any
ordinary place or any ordinary forest land in western Montana."</TE>
<TE>   Parker and her husband, Tom, are among local residents who hope to
raise enough money to outbid wealthy out-of-staters for the prized
parcels as they come on the market.</TE>
<TE>   They want to see the property put in a community trust, which
would ensure that it remains open to wildlife, as well as hunters,
fishermen and other sportsmen, while also allowing some logging.
Maybe more important, it would prevent the building of dozens of new
homes for the wealthy.</TE>
<TE>   Plum Creek intends to sell about half the 20,000 acres in parcels
of 160 acres each. The parcels would be sold as high-end residential
property after the company harvested the most valuable trees. Plum
Creek hopes to sell the remaining 10,000 acres to the Forest Service,
although so far the agency has said it does not have the money.</TE>
<TE>   Jerry Sorensen, Plum Creek's land use manager for the Rocky
Mountains, said he doesn't understand why area residents oppose the
land sale. It would only increase private residential property in
Swan Valley from 7% to 9%, he said. In addition, if the Forest
Service buys the rest, it would increase the amount of publicly owned
land in the valley.</TE>
<TE>   "In my judgment, it's not that significant of a change," Sorensen
said, noting that the vast majority of the land in the valley remains
publicly owned.</TE>
<TE>   Choice land in pristine areas such as Swan Valley is worth more as
real estate than as timberland. Plum Creek recognizes that. The
company has ramped up real estate sales in recent years, selling
high-value home sites and using the cash to buy cheaper forest land
elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   It is seeking an average of $10,000 an acre for its Swan Valley
land.</TE>
<TE>   Opponents, however, point to potential problems if the Swan Valley
land becomes dotted with new homes.</TE>
<TE>   The valley is home to grizzly bears that crisscross the forest.
Visitors are just as likely to run into an elk as a lumberjack while
taking dirt roads to the grocery store.</TE>
<TE>   Conservationists assert that the 200,000-acre Swan Valley is among
the most important natural areas in Montana, featuring a diversity of
plant and animal life found nowhere else in the state.</TE>
<TE>   But that, and a number of beautiful rivers, streams and lakes with
majestic views, also make it a valuable place to build a
multimillion-dollar vacation home.</TE>
<TE>   Locals fear land that Plum Creek has kept open for public access
will be bought by people who will close it to hunters and sportsmen.
They also worry that Plum Creek will harvest all the best trees
first, leaving only small, stunted trees palatable only to buyers
unfamiliar with the forest.</TE>
<TE>   Logger Max Greenough said he believes that the current Plum Creek
sale won't be the last. He said the company, which is among the
largest landholders in the United States with about 8 million acres
in 19 states, has been cutting so many trees in recent years that
much of its land won't be ready to harvest again for about another
century.</TE>
<TE>   "They're in the rape-and-run mode," Greenough said. "They're just
getting these sections; they're just taking everything that'll make a
log off of them and then selling the land."</TE>
<TE>   Greenough may actually profit if the land is sold as residential
property: His wife is a real estate agent. In addition, new
landowners often need logging done on their land before they can
build a home.</TE>
<TE>   Still, Greenough opposes the land sale.</TE>
<TE>   "I live here because of the type of country it is. There's not
that many people," he said. The thought of a valley that could be
adding subdivisions and new neighbors, "that ain't the type of
country I want to live in."</TE>
<TE>   So far, the land has been selling nearly as fast as Plum Creek has
offered it for sale. Three of four 160-acre parcels that were put on
the market in May sold within a month, Sorensen said. But Sorensen
said the company isn't going to ditch all of its land in Swan Valley,
one of the state's better timber regions.</TE>
<TE>   "It remains a very important timber area for us. It grows timber
well," Sorensen said.</TE>
<TE>   But selling Swan Valley land for timber property elsewhere makes
economic sense.</TE>
<TE>   Plum Creek was able to buy 900,000 acres of Maine's forest land
for $180 million a few years ago. If it gets its asking price in Swan
Valley, 20,000 acres of land it has already logged could go for $200
million.</TE>
<TE>   Such land sales are not unique to Swan Valley or Montana. Land
sales in Maine have worried conservationists, and Plum Creek is
offering land for sale in Pennsylvania, Washington and West Virginia.
It says land in other states may be sold too.</TE>
<TE>   Bruce Farling, executive director of Montana Trout Unlimited, said
the company's actions disprove its attempts to promote itself as the
environmentally sensitive timber company. He noted that under a
disputed agreement with the government, Plum Creek is allowed some
dispensation from the Endangered Species Act in Swan Valley as long
as it follows a list of self-imposed environmental logging
restrictions.</TE>
<TE>   In return for that agreement, he said, if Plum Creek sells land,
it should sell at a discount to conservation groups or the Forest
Service.</TE>
<TE>   "If you're going to get this 30-year permit to harm these fish,
get out of these lawsuits, they ought to give something up," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Sorensen dismisses the argument.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a business decision," he said. "We have a responsibility to
manage our assets for profit."</TE>

<HD>Moorer's Comeback Continues</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HAL BOCK</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For a while, Michael Moorer talked clinically about his craft, about
his time as heavyweight champion, about beating Evander Holyfield for
the most coveted title in boxing, about losing it to a pillowy George
Foreman.</LD>
<LD>   And then emotion took over.</LD>
<LD>   "I never had a childhood," he said. "I was always fighting. I
never went to my prom. I never went to the Christmas dance."</LD>
<TE>   The words were coming fast now, tumbling over one another.</TE>
<TE>   "High school graduation, I was in Colorado Springs with an amateur
team,' he said. "I flew in for graduation and I flew right back
afterwards, right back to training."</TE>
<TE>   The grind led Moorer to the pinnacle of boxing, twice heavyweight
champion. And it also led him right out of the ring.</TE>
<TE>   One day in 1997, after being knocked down five times and losing
the title to Holyfield in a rematch, Moorer decided he'd had enough
speed bags and jump ropes, enough of road work and sparring.</TE>
<TE>   So he walked away from the game.</TE>
<TE>   "I was bored with the sport," he said. "I said, 'I'm done with
this.' I wanted to have some fun, and I did.</TE>
<TE>   "I lived my teen-age years in my late 20s. I made up for lost
time."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed.</TE>
<TE>   There was an arrest in 1999 on drunken-driving charges, part of a
troubling romance with alcohol. His weight ballooned to 270 pounds.
He barely resembled the fighter he had been when he ruled the
division.</TE>
<TE>   Moorer was good when he started. He turned pro in 1988 and won his
first 26 fights by knockouts. He was 34-0 by 1994 when he outpointed
Holyfield for the WBA and IBF titles.</TE>
<TE>   Seven months later, he fought Foreman, an old man embraced by
boxing fans for his folksy style. Moorer beat on the big man for 10
rounds and then walked into a right cross that put him down.</TE>
<TE>   "He caught me good," Moorer said. "I tried to get up but my body
wouldn't let me. He became the oldest heavyweight champion in
history."</TE>
<TE>   At 45, Foreman was beloved, the people's champion.</TE>
<TE>   Moorer rebounded from that setback by outpointing Axel Schulz in
Germany to win the IBF title, by then vacated by Foreman. Then in a
title unification bout, Holyfield stopped Moorer in eight rounds and
sent him spiraling into other adventures.</TE>
<TE>   The arrest became big news.</TE>
<TE>   "When you're an athlete and you do something bad, it's out of
proportion," Moorer said. "The average Joe Blow walking down the
street gets in trouble, you never hear about it. With athletes, they
drag it out. Bad news sells. People still talk about something that
happened six, seven years ago."</TE>
<TE>   Eventually, Moorer had enough of life on the wild side. He
remembered his roots, planted so long before in the ring.</TE>
<TE>   The fight game can be addictive, a roller-coaster ride of emotions
that accompanies and often defines the men who climb between the
ropes.</TE>
<TE>   Two years ago, Moorer made the climb again.</TE>
<TE>   "I had to get the hunger back in myself," he said. "It was tough
to go back. I had let my body go. There were no workouts, no
training."</TE>
<TE>   Slowly, he got back into boxing condition. There have been five
fights in the comeback, four wins and a draw. Next up is David Tua,
next Saturday night in Atlantic City as part of HBO's "Boxing After
Dark" series.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm proud of my rebound," Moorer said. "I've grown so much in the
last two years. I've gotten so much out of life."</TE>
<TE>   The fight against Tua matches two old pals who were training
partners in Houston during Moorer's first boxing incarnation, one
that seems a lifetime ago.</TE>
<TE>   "David is a very nice person, but business is business," Moorer
said. "He understands that."</TE>
<TE>   At 34, Moorer is not sure where this comeback will lead him.</TE>
<TE>   "I never thought I'd be boxing this long," he said. "I thought I
would only box in the amateurs through high school. But I had a good
knockout record when I started and I thought, 'Why not stick around?'</TE>
<TE>   "I'm just doing what I know how to do--fight. I want to be the
best at what I do. I don't know what's out there for me as far as my
future."</TE>
<TE>   Then he paused and remembered why all boxers get into this
business in the first place.</TE>
<TE>   "The championship is every fighter's goal," he said. "I can come
back and do it again. I'm blessed to have a second chance."</TE>

<HD>Dilfer Starting Season on High Note</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JANIE McCAULEY</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>CHENEY, Wash.</DL>
<LD>Trent Dilfer won the Super Bowl, then lost his job.</LD>
<LD>   He found his way to a new football team, only to be a backup.</LD>
<LD>   A year later, he's on top again, as the starter for the Seattle
Seahawks in a season already surrounded by hype.</LD>
<TE>   "Maybe the neatest thing I experienced in the process was I'd
always been the star, like most guys--high school, college," he said.
"You start in the NFL and you never had to be one of the guys that
was in the background and yet still had an impact.</TE>
<TE>   "I got to appreciate that and experience it, and I'm forever
thankful for that, because I think I'll have a better perspective on
my team because of it."</TE>
<TE>   The Seahawks are counting on Dilfer to get them into the playoffs
and show some of the postseason poise he had in Baltimore. Seattle
missed the playoffs last year with a 9-7 record, despite winning
three of its last four games. Dilfer is riding a 15-game winning
streak as a starter.</TE>
<TE>   There are plenty other reasons for the Seahawks to be excited this
season. The team will play in a new $430 million downtown stadium,
wear new uniforms and compete in a new division, the NFC West.</TE>
<TE>   "It feels good knowing you have somebody like Dilfer at the helm,"
said second-year receiver Koren Robinson, Seattle's top draft pick in
2001.</TE>
<TE>   "You want to go out there and work hard for him because you know
what type of person he is. You know he's going to get you the ball.
You know that he's going to do everything that he can to make you
better. So you do everything you can to help him out."</TE>
<TE>   Dilfer, considered one of the NFL's most promising young
quarterbacks when he was drafted seventh by Tampa Bay in 1994, never
made his mark with the Buccaneers. He lost his job to Shaun King, who
guided the Bucs to the 1999 NFC title game. Then Dilfer was released.</TE>
<TE>   The Ravens signed him as a backup to Tony Banks, who was
ineffective. Baltimore benched Banks for Dilfer, who went unbeaten
the rest of the season.</TE>
<TE>   But Dilfer lost his spot with Baltimore just over a month after
leading the Ravens to the championship, making him the only Super
Bowl-winning quarterback who headed into the following season without
a job.</TE>
<TE>   Then he signed a one-year contract with Seattle and vowed to be
the best backup in the NFL, because Seattle coach and general manager
Mike Holmgren already had decided Matt Hasselbeck would start.</TE>
<TE>   As Holmgren stuck by Hasselbeck, who had never started a
regular-season game, he faced criticism for not starting Dilfer. Fans
often chanted "Dilfer, Dilfer!" during games.</TE>
<TE>   But the man committed to being the best backup got another chance
as a starter. Dilfer went 4-0 when Hasselbeck was injured, improving
his string of victories to 15.</TE>
<TE>   He signed an $8 million, four-year contract in the offseason and
Holmgren promoted Dilfer to No. 1 this spring, demoting Hasselbeck.</TE>
<TE>   The route Dilfer took back to the top made him a better player and
person, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Some roller coasters are more public than others," Dilfer said.
"Obviously, my situation leaving Tampa to Baltimore and Baltimore
coming here, backing up, starting--yadda yadda yadda--was big news
and kind of a journey. But I kind of look at each year as a new
journey and whatever my circumstances are, I make the most of them."</TE>
<TE>   Dilfer, 30 and the father of four, insists he has grown up and is
ready for this role. He wants to forget some of the frustrating times
from early in his career.</TE>
<TE>   He even mentored David Carr, the overall No. 1 pick in the draft
by Houston. Both played at Fresno State.</TE>
<TE>   Seahawks quarterbacks coach Jim Zorn appreciates Dilfer's
attitude.</TE>
<TE>   "He's maintained his poise, and that's probably a great sign for a
quarterback that can take a team places," said Zorn, Seattle's first
starting quarterback.</TE>
<TE>   Linebacker Isaiah Kacyvenski says the Seahawks have faith in
Dilfer because they've seen what he can do.</TE>
<TE>   "We're all behind Trent," Kacyvenski said.</TE>
<TE>   "There is obviously a warm and fuzzy feeling to have the
attention, getting to be a part of all the excitement, but there's
also a great responsibility that goes with it," Dilfer said.</TE>

<KH>NFL TRAINING CAMP NOTES</KH>
<HD>Alexander a Question Mark for Vikings</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Odds and ends from this week at NFL training camps:</LD>
<LD>   MINNESOTA VIKINGS: Derrick Alexander, signed as a free agent, was
supposed to replace Cris Carter at wide receiver and complement Randy
Moss.</LD>
<LD>   But a quadriceps injury has hampered Alexander, who had 470 yards
and three touchdowns in an unspectacular 2001 with the Chiefs.</LD>
<TE>   Coach Mike Tice is disappointed that Alexander hasn't been able to
practice much. So D'Wayne Bates, signed from Chicago, is now the
starter.</TE>
<TE>   "He has worked hard to gain that spot," Tice said of Bates. "I
would wish that players, when they have a chance to compete for a
starting spot, would step up to the plate and go ahead and compete
for that spot, but that's not the case with all players."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   WASHINGTON REDSKINS: Coach Steve Spurrier, who has never had to
cut players before, faces a real numbers crunch now that he has four
quarterbacks in camp.</TE>
<TE>   With first-round draft Patrick Ramsey signed, Spurrier is toying
with keeping all four on the roster because he doesn't want to part
with Shane Matthews, Sage Rosenfels or Danny Wuerffel.</TE>
<TE>   Spurrier also wants to keep six receivers--also one more than
usual for a 53-man roster.</TE>
<TE>   As a result, the Redskins may keep just two tight ends--Walter
Rasby and rookie Robert Royal. Zeron Flemister is having a
disappointing camp.</TE>
<TE>   Spurrier also doesn't have a return specialist for kickoffs or
punts. He plans to use receivers or cornerbacks in those roles,
saving another roster spot or two.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   TENNESSEE TITANS: Cornerback Andre Dyson has been the most
impressive defensive player in camp. He took away a pass meant for
his older brother Kevin in one drill, and he intercepted two passes
and just missed a third during a short practice.</TE>
<TE>   Andre Dyson needed only four games to play his way into the
starting lineup as a rookie last season and led the team with three
interceptions. He has been improving almost daily since then, and
secondary coach Everett Withers said he is anticipating and
communicating better than last season.</TE>
<TE>   "Everything's slowed down," Dyson said. "It's a little easier.
Last year I was having to learn a lot of stuff and being thrown in
having to think so much. This year I really don't have to think as
much. Just go out and play."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   BUFFALO BILLS: Offensive coordinator Kevin Gilbride has the
confidence in Drew Bledsoe to allow Buffalo's new quarterback to call
some of his own plays.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm really excited about that part of it," Bledsoe said. "I think
I have enough experience and enough knowledge of the game that I can
attack some things when I have the opportunity."</TE>
<TE>   Bledsoe was not provided that freedom in New England. And the
Bills did not allow former starter Rob Johnson to call his own plays.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   CLEVELAND BROWNS: Frisman Jackson is making a name for himself.</TE>
<TE>   The undrafted rookie wide receiver from Western Illinois has
impressed the Browns with his catching ability. He also amazed his
teammates with his arm strength.</TE>
<TE>   A former college quarterback, Jackson bet teammate Kevin Johnson
$100 that he could throw a ball more than 80 yards.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson lost. Jackson unleashed an 83-yard bomb.</TE>
<TE>   "Have you ever seen that commercial with Michael Vick where he
throws it out of the stadium?" said Johnson, who got off a 72-yard
throw himself. "That's what it looks like when the ball leaves his
hand."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   NEW YORK JETS: The team's most significant offseason addition,
linebacker Sam Cowart, has yet to participate in a practice. Bothered
by a hamstring injury, the Jets are bringing him along slowly,
particularly with Cowart coming off a torn Achilles' tendon that
sidelined him last season.</TE>
<TE>   But the team isn't worried about rustiness.</TE>
<TE>   "It would be a lot more disappointing if we lost him for the
season," coach Herman Edwards said. "He had a serious injury and we
really didn't expect him to be this far in training camp. This was
the week we first expected him to start suiting up."</TE>
<TE>   A 2000 Pro Bowler, Cowart left Buffalo for the Jets as a free
agent, signing a six-year deal that could be worth as much as $31
million. He will combine with two other standout linebackers, Mo
Lewis and Marvin Jones.</TE>
<TE>   "We're looking forward to seeing the three of them together,"
linebackers coach Bob Sutton said. "It's a good group of linebackers,
all pretty good size guys. Hopefully we'll present some people with
problems out there."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   KANSAS CITY CHIEFS: The riskiest experiment in camp, putting Mike
Maslowski at weakside linebacker, looks good some days and bad
others. Maslowski, a backup in his three seasons with the team,
replaces Donnie Edwards.</TE>
<TE>   Edwards led the team in tackles the past four years but was not
offered a contract because the Chiefs used their available cap money
on cornerback Eric Warfield.</TE>
<TE>   What's worrisome is Mazlowski's lack of speed, especially compared
with the fleet Edwards. Coach Dick Vermeil insists it is not a worry.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   GREEN BAY PACKERS: Terry Glenn has given the Packers two scares
with minor knee injuries. Glenn has a long history of injuries and
had a reputation in New England for an inability to play through pain
-- Bill Parcells once referred to him as "she."</TE>
<TE>   He was hurt last Wednesday during a one-on-one passing drill when
he reached back for a pass and his left knee buckled. "It bent far
back at an awkward angle," Glenn said. "I really thought I did
something. Luckily, I didn't do anything. It feels pretty good right
now."</TE>
<TE>   Glenn hurt his right knee during the first week of camp.</TE>
<TE>   The Packers are counting on Glenn to be a major part of their
passing attack now that Antonio Freeman, Bill Schroeder and Corey
Bradford are gone.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   PITTSBURGH STEELERS: One of the keys to the Steelers' rushing
offense is progressing much faster than expected from a potentially
serious medical condition.</TE>
<TE>   Running back Amos Zereoue is beginning to regain his leg strength
after missing most of the team's offseason workouts and minicamps. He
lost 12 pounds during a hospital stay in March, when a benign cyst
was found on his liver.</TE>
<TE>   Zereoue has since regained the weight he lost -- he's at 208
pounds -- but the medical problem slowed his offseason conditioning.</TE>
<TE>   "Yeah it was scary, real scary," Zereoue said. "I didn't know what
it really was. When they told me it was the liver, I didn't know what
to think."</TE>
<TE>   The problem didn't prevent the Steelers from signing Zereoue to a
four-year, $8.8 million contract extension, a large deal for a
backup. He will make $2.839 million this season.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   PHILADELPHIA EAGLES: A.J. Feeley and Koy Detmer are battling for
the backup quarterback spot to Donovan McNabb. Detmer has been the
backup the last two seasons. Feeley, a fifth-round pick in 2001,
completed 10-of-14 passes for 143 yards, two touchdowns and one
interception in the meaningless regular-season final against Tampa
last year. ... WR Freddie Milons, a fifth-round pick, is having a
solid camp in his bid to earn a roster spot as the fourth or fifth
receiver and backup returner.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   MIAMI DOLPHINS: By staying away from the refrigerator at night,
Jamie Nails lost 50 pounds.</TE>
<TE>   The Dolphins' guard is down to 335 pounds and competing for a
starting job. A weight problem prompted the Dolphins to cut him 19
days into training camp a year ago, and he spent the season on the
sideline.</TE>
<TE>   Thus the diet.</TE>
<TE>   "Instead of eating all the time, I drink more water," said Nails,
who played in Buffalo from 1997 to 2000. "After a certain period of
time in the day I stopped eating, like after 7 o'clock no more food,
only water."</TE>
<TE>   He's also more devoted to weight room workouts.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm a lot quicker than I was previous years and I feel a lot
better," he said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   CHICAGO BEARS: The Bears didn't know what to expect when they
moved their training camp to Bourbonnais, Ill., just 50 miles south
of Chicago after an 18-year run at Platteville, Wis.</TE>
<TE>   Now they do.</TE>
<TE>   They've encountered huge, wild crowds. They had more than 12,000
turn out for one weekend practice at Olivet Nazarene University and
8,500 for a weekday practice at 8:30 a.m. Crowds have averaged
between 4,000 to 5,000.</TE>

<KH>FIGURE SKATING</KH>
<HD>Latest Scandal May Be Good for Business</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NANCY ARMOUR</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Dream up the wildest scandal possible, and odds are figure skating
has survived it--and thrived.</LD>
<LD>   Fans keep tuning in, and sponsors keep signing up.</LD>
<LD>   Tonya and Nancy and the whack heard 'round the world gave
rock-star status to a sport that already was the showcase of the
Winter Olympics. The Salt Lake City pairs controversy led to more
magazine covers and big TV ratings.</LD>
<TE>   So as stunning as the accusations that a reputed Russian mobster
rigged the Olympics might be, this latest scandal won't necessarily
be bad for business.</TE>
<TE>   "Absolutely, it will survive," said Michael Rosenberg, a former
agent who represented Tonya Harding and Dorothy Hamill. "Some sports
are bigger than any scandal, bigger than any personality. And figure
skating is one of those sports."</TE>
<TE>   Figure skating is more than just elegance and flashy costumes,
triple axels and quadruple jumps. It's big business.</TE>
<TE>   With a fan base that cuts across gender, age and economic lines,
skating's top events are a strong television draw.</TE>
<TE>   Companies across the world--Chevrolet and State Farm, Lalique and
Adidas, to name a few -- spend millions of dollars each year for a
tie-in to the sport and its athletes.</TE>
<TE>   Just how big is the business? Consider that Michelle Kwan is a
millionaire several times over, while Todd Eldredge owns a bevy of
luxury sports cars--and neither is an Olympic champion.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. Figure Skating Association has a yearly operating budget
of about $16 million, with sponsorship agreements and its TV deal
with ABC accounting for $11 million of that.</TE>
<TE>   ABC is paying roughly $100 million over 10 years for the rights to
broadcast five events a season. Yes, only five. And that doesn't
include the world championships or events outside the United States:
There's a separate deal with the International Skating Union to cover
those.</TE>
<TE>   "It's beautiful entertainment," said Neal Pilson, former president
of CBS Sports and now an independent consultant. "It's a very special
sport, and I think it will not lose the attention of viewers.</TE>
<TE>   "I think viewers understand the athletes have not been
compromised," Pilson added. "The athletes were really innocent
victims and I think, in a way, the public will continue to support
the sport because it will support the athletes."</TE>
<TE>   With so much money at stake, though, no one's taking any chances.
Lloyd Ward, chief executive officer of the U.S. Olympic Committee,
sent a letter to major sponsors last week, assuring them the USOC had
asked the International Olympic Committee for an investigation and
pledged its cooperation. He also urged sponsors to call him if they
had any questions or concerns.</TE>
<TE>   So far, there hasn't been any backlash, said USOC spokesman Mike
Moran.</TE>
<TE>   "I think the jury's out in terms of the public reaction until such
time as the IOC or the ISU or law-enforcement agencies get to the
bottom of it," Moran said. "I think the public wants to see how you
ultimately deal with it."</TE>
<TE>   The USFSA talked to its sponsors more informally, but didn't get
any negative response, either, spokesman Bob Dunlop said.</TE>
<TE>   Zoe Younker, a spokeswoman for State Farm Insurance, the title
sponsor of the national championships, said her company is still
committed to skating.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously it's a desire for us for the sport to reflect the
highest integrity," she said. "But State Farm will still continue to
be associated with the U.S. Figure Skating Association."</TE>
<TE>   Even when skating and integrity don't go together, it doesn't seem
to matter. When the crew of bumbling misfits connected to Harding
attacked Nancy Kerrigan at the U.S. championships in 1994, the public
couldn't get enough of it. It was the Ice Princess vs. the Ultimate
Bad Girl, the pinnacle of drama and camp.</TE>
<TE>   And it produced an explosion the likes of which sports has never
seen. The women's short program--the Tonya-Nancy showdown--and the
free skate at the Lillehammer Olympics drew the fourth- and
sixth-highest ratings of any TV shows up to that point.</TE>
<TE>   Not just for 1994. Ever.</TE>
<TE>   The touring ice shows were sellouts and TV networks clamored for
more skating. The USFSA's membership jumped from almost 110,000 in
1992-93 to more than 156,000 in 2000-01.</TE>
<TE>   "It's amazing. All the various things that have happened in the
ice skating world, and it seems to thrive and do well under
controversy," said Tom Collins, creator of the Champions on Ice tour
that features most of the Olympic medalists.</TE>
<TE>   "You can knock it, tear it to pieces and still people would go to
it."</TE>
<TE>   So just imagine the possibilities with this latest uproar.</TE>
<TE>   "This scandal will benefit the TV people and show organizers,
since it helps raise the public interest in figure skating and
increases attendance as people want to see these 'mobsters on ice,' "
Russian pairs skater Anton Sikharulidze said bitterly.</TE>
<TE>   He and partner Elena Berezhnaya, of course, had to share their
Salt Lake City Olympic title with Canadians Jamie Sale and David
Pelletier.</TE>
<TE>   As distasteful as it might be, controversy is an undeniable part
of skating's charm, said Rosenberg, the former agent.</TE>
<TE>   In a country that thrives on talk radio and conspiracy theories,
what's more entertaining than watching a sport where the next big
scandal might only be a sit spin away?</TE>
<TE>   "Whether you're talking about a woman working for Xerox or a guy
working as a security officer, they all know about the Canadians and
the Russians in Salt Lake City," Rosenberg said.</TE>
<TE>   "The soap opera aspect of the sport is appealing. The subjectivity
which lends itself to endless arguments is appealing," he added.
"Those two factors are pluses, not negatives, in the overall scheme
of things."</TE>

<DH>THE ART OF TRAVEL, By Alain de Botton, Pantheon: 258 pp.,
$23</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CARMELA CIURARU</AU>
<BD>Carmela Ciuraru is the editor of "Beat Poets" and the
forthcoming "Poems for America."</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In previous books, Alain de Botton has mined the life and work of
Proust to offer readers a quirky source of self-help ("How Proust Can
Change Your Life") and explored the writings of various philosophers
in a similarly user-friendly guide ("The Consolations of
Philosophy"). In his latest book of nonfiction, aptly titled "The Art
of Travel," De Botton meditates on the rewards and realities of
travel, seeking to understand its mysterious pull by way of art,
literature and his own decidedly mixed experiences. He relates even
the most disappointing experiences with delightful wit, graceful
prose and surprising insight.</LD>
<LD>   He starts with a basic question: For what reason do we desire
travel? "If our lives are dominated by a search for happiness," he
writes, "then perhaps few activities reveal as much about the
dynamics of this quest--in all its ardour and paradoxes--than our
travels. They express, however inarticulately, an understanding of
what life might be about, outside of the constraints of work and of
the struggle for survival."</LD>
<LD>   De Botton ruminates on the perplexing gap between the anticipation
of travel and what it delivers. Like John Berger's "Ways of Seeing,"
De Botton encourages us to consider how memory and expectation color
our perceptions.</LD>
<TE>   De Botton begins the book by recounting a trip to Barbados.
Despite his idyllic surroundings, which include island birds, coconut
trees and a stunning beach, De Botton finds himself fretting over
intrusive thoughts and bemoaning his failure to leave behind a dreary
life in London. He realizes that his awareness of the beautiful
landscape is marred by "a sore throat I had developed during the
flight, worry over not having informed a colleague that I would be
away, a pressure across both temples and a rising need to visit the
bathroom." Throughout the book, De Botton points out the discrepancy
between the selves we imagine we'll become on vacation and the selves
we never stop inhabiting. Although before a trip we may envision
ourselves suntanned, well-rested, well-read and sipping tropical
drinks on the beach, De Botton remarks upon the tendency of mind and
body to conspire in myriad ways to prevent that sublime image from
ever surfacing.</TE>
<TE>   While in Barbados, for example, he finds that "[t]he body found it
hard to sleep and complained of heat, flies and difficulties
digesting hotel meals. The mind meanwhile revealed a commitment to
anxiety, boredom, free-floating sadness and financial alarm."</TE>
<TE>   Of course, De Botton doesn't claim to hold all the answers; as in
previous books, he turns to old masters of art and literature for
wisdom and guidance: Baudelaire, Flaubert, Hopper and Van Gogh, among
others. He quotes Flaubert on his notorious (and hilarious) contempt
for France, and his intense, unremitting desire to escape his
homeland, thus illuminating travel as a means of erasing history,
family and identity. We might also view travel as a way of escaping
loneliness and boredom, but inevitably, as De Botton points out, when
we are on holiday, we often still feel lonely and bored and long to
return home.</TE>
<TE>   But De Botton isn't always let down by his travels. The author
writes of how the simple act of transporting oneself to a strange
place can take us out of ourselves, at least for a short time, thanks
in part to our natural curiosity. In fact, De Botton reveals that
when he feels melancholy at home, he occasionally boards a train or
bus and goes to Heathrow airport, "where, from an observation gallery
in Terminal 2 or from the top floor of the Renaissance Hotel along
the north runway, I have drawn comfort from the sight of the
ceaseless landings and takeoffs of aircraft."</TE>
<TE>   He also writes beautifully of the soothing effects of train travel
and its ability to stimulate the imagination and help us work through
problems ("Journeys are the midwives of thought," he writes); and of
the wonders of airplanes: "Few seconds in life are more releasing
than those in which a plane ascends to the sky." During takeoff, he
explains, "[t]he display of power can inspire us to imagine
analogous, decisive shifts in our own lives, to imagine that we, too,
might one day surge above much that now looms over us."</TE>
<TE>   Ultimately, though, De Botton seems to yearn for the road already
traveled, the one close to home. In the book's final section, he
writes of renewing his attentiveness and curiosity to the
neighborhood he knows so well and of discovering many things he had
thus far failed to notice. "If only we could apply a travelling
mind-set to our own locales," he writes, "we might find these places
becoming no less interesting than, say, the high mountain passes and
butterfly-filled jungles of [Alexander von] Humboldt's South
America."</TE>
<TE>   And certainly easier on the wallet.</TE>

<DH>IRIS ORIGO: Marchesa of Val d'Orcia, By Caroline Moorehead,
David R. Godine: 374 pp., $35</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BENITA EISLER</AU>
<BD>Benita Eisler is the author of a recent biography of
Byron and the forthcoming "Chopin's Funeral," the story of the
composer's last years.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"I hate 'abroad,' " Lord Redesdale once announced to his Mitford
daughters, voicing a sentiment shared by many of his fellow Britons.
Florence was the one exception to a primal English aversion to
foreignness. From the middle of the 19th century on, the city on the
banks of the Arno was expat paradise to an entire class of
Anglo-American wealth. Cheap labor and real estate allowed the rich
to live in feudal splendor, permitting even their followers, like art
historian Bernard Berenson, to assume the trappings of seigneurial
style.</LD>
<LD>   By 1911, Caroline Moorehead tells us in "Iris Origo: Marchesa of
Val d'Orcia," her richly satisfying life of the writer and
biographer, there were, incredibly, 35,000 English living in or
around Florence. Her hills were alive with the sound of clinking
teacups and the drone of upper-class Edwardian speech.</LD>
<LD>   Born in London in 1902 and raised in this culture of chosen exile,
Iris Cutting seems to have sprung fully formed from the pages of a
Henry James novel. An only child, she was heiress to new fortunes on
one side of the Atlantic and granddaughter of the Anglo-Irish
ascendancy on the other. Her American father, Bayard Cutting, scion
to vast wealth from real estate and railroads, had made the classic
Gilded Age match, wedding the daughter of Lord Desart.</LD>
<TE>   A promising young diplomat, Cutting died of tuberculosis when his
daughter was 7. To escape both families, his widow Sybil settled in
Florence and became one of its reigning deities.</TE>
<TE>   Clever and plain, Iris would never be a belle, and her mother
sensibly allowed her friend Berenson to provide the girl with a noted
classicist as a tutor. While Iris was learning Greek and Latin,
Sybil, with the help of her lover, landscape architect and writer
Geoffrey Scott, turned her property, the Villa Medici in Fiesole,
into a showplace of garden design and historic reconstruction.</TE>
<TE>   With few companions her own age, bookish and socially awkward,
Iris would inevitably fall for a fortune hunter; Marchese Antonio
Origo had little to recommend him but his title. Both Protestant
sides of the girl's family were horrified by Iris' choice: a Roman
Catholic, and the illegitimate son of a cavalryman. But the smitten
20-year-old prevailed and the couple were married in the Medici
chapel on the grounds of the villa. Sybil remained in bed with a
migraine.</TE>
<TE>   Predictably, the marriage was unhappy from the start. The pair had
nothing in common, and although Moorehead describes Origo as a
"sportsman," his athletics were confined to the usual pastime of men
of his class: philandering. Iris, too, soon found consolation
elsewhere. What kept them together more than nominally was their
purchase of an unpromising parcel of arid land in Val d'Orcia, a
remote corner of Tuscany. "La Foce" was a miserable collection of
hardscrabble farms where the peasantry eked out a subsistence living
from the thin-soiled steep cliffs--"like a lunar landscape" the new
owners said happily--virtual slaves to the ancient system of tenancy
called padronage.</TE>
<TE>   Settling in La Foce, the Origos reinvented themselves as model
landowners and agrarian reformers. With the wedding present of a
pipeline from a Cutting aunt, water from the valley turned the chalky
terraces into flourishing farms. (What God could do if He had money!)
Iris' investment in reclaiming Val d'Orcia provided an incompatible
couple with complementary roles. Antonio presided over the
agricultural innovations: new tractors, irrigation, livestock; Iris
applied her intelligence and energy to organizing a primary school,
decent housing and medical care for the workers and their families.
Then, in June 1924, as if to bless their collaboration, the Origos'
first child, a son, Giovanni "Gianni" Clemente, was born.</TE>
<TE>   Another benediction, this one, political, was soon bestowed. Early
in his climb to power, Mussolini recognized how much he needed the
support of Italy's aristocratic families with their vast land
holdings. The transformation of Val d'Orcia by a noble landowner and
his rich foreign wife was the model enterprise he sought.</TE>
<TE>   Touting the agrarian reforms at La Foce and the paternalistic
success of its owners, Il Duce diverted attention from his betrayal
of earlier promises to redistribute agricultural wealth. In the
course of several well-publicized visits, uniformed Fascist
dignitaries honored a smiling Black-Shirted Antonio, while Mussolini
himself exalted the work of the padrona as extending the
dictatorship's ideal of domesticity into the public sphere.</TE>
<TE>   Fascism was no moral stretch for the marchese, an
arch-conservative, monarchist and anti-Semite. Iris' views are
cloaked in silence. In her many letters from the late 1920s and early
'30s--years before censorship would have been an issue--she made not
a single allusion to the spreading evils of the regime: neither
adventurism abroad nor at home, the debasement of language,
suppression of dissent and constitutional rights, racial laws,
sanctioned thuggery, not even the flight or deportation of liberal
friends. As to Mussolini, her few comments are admiring: Fluttery
frissons greet Il Duce's striding macho progress through a roomful of
effete aristocrats: "My dear, he is a very great man," she advised a
doubting English friend.</TE>
<TE>   Amazingly, between her duties as padrona and socialite, the
hunting parties at home and extended trips to America and England,
the expeditions lasting months to remote climes whose planning of
camels and bearers would have stymied Lawrence of Arabia, Iris Origo
found time to become a writer.</TE>
<TE>   She had long meditated a biography of the poet Giacomo Leopardi, a
reclusive hunchback whose inner exile spoke to her own sense of being
an outsider in the country where she had lived since childhood.
Constantly interrupted, her work on the book had been lastly deferred
by her son's birth; it was Gianni's death in 1932 that forced its
completion.</TE>
<TE>   Guilt compounded the devastation of loss. The 8-year-old boy had
wasted away for 58 days before dying of undiagnosed meningitis. Local
doctors had been consulted--even a clairvoyant living in the English
town of Harrow--but it never seems to have occurred to his parents,
who buzzed off in private railway cars to Swiss clinics and Harley
Street specialists for a lingering cough, to seek more sophisticated
medical care for their child.</TE>
<TE>   Three years later, "Leopardi: A Study in Solitude," was published
in London to admiring notices on both sides of the Atlantic. Its
author's avoidance of the "too personal" was found to be especially
commendable. Today, Origo's life of the poet feels authoritative and
intelligent but cold--its author still frozen in the first shock of
grief.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the tragedy had further estranged an already distant
couple: There were quarrels and new affairs. But at least Iris'
writing ceased to be a furtive activity; she no longer cared that
Antonio loathed literary women. In contrast, Origo's next subject
unlocked in her a wellspring of imaginative sympathy. "Allegra" is a
brief "memoir" of Byron's "little illegitimate," his daughter with
Claire Clairmont. Dead at 5 years old, the beautiful "child of
fashion and sin" was a sacrifice to parental hostilities. An
instrument of her father's revenge on his importunate mistress, she
was left to sicken and die in an insalubrious convent, unvisited by
either parent. No book has stronger claims as an act of penance.</TE>
<TE>   Origo had found her voice and, in the process, forged her own
genre of biography. Like La Foce itself, her "lives" are
reclamations, a seamless join of historical research and the
storyteller's art. Only the endless, painfully revised drafts among
her papers confound our sense of an effortless style, our certainty
that she couldn't write an ugly sentence.</TE>
<TE>   Whether making human the most sentimentalized of saints, as in her
life of San Bernardino, or summoning a vital 14th century merchant of
Prato from a roomful of crumbling documents, Origo brought the
foreigner's curiosity to that other country, the past.</TE>
<TE>   In "The Last Attachment," the story of Byron and the Countess
Teresa Guiccioli, Origo's deep knowledge of the history and mores of
19th century Italy and her own roots elsewhere focus her double
perspective. Evoking Byron's isolation in provincial Ravenna, his
political education under a police state, his life as a series of
exiles with his mistress' family, Origo speaks from her own equivocal
experience.</TE>
<TE>   Two years earlier, in 1947, she had published the book that
vaulted her from scholarly obscurity. "War in Val d'Orcia" was the
story that a postwar culture wanted to hear: an inspiring memoir of
sacrifice and heroism shared by the entire La Foce community, led by
the Origos' risky work of hiding and feeding Allied troops and local
partisans. Some saw the book as a whitewash of Antonio's
Black-Shirted past and the author's own acquiencent silence. With
Mussolini's defeat, everyone was a partigiano.</TE>
<TE>   Moorehead's treatment of the political dimensions of Origo's life,
evenhanded and honest, is only one of the virtues of her exemplary
authorized biography. She captures the giddiness of pre-war
Florentine society, its musical beds and warring salonistas, along
with the deep sadness of Origo's last years, which neither two
daughters, her own last attachment of friendship with a great and
noble woman, reconciliation with Antonio nor conversion to
Catholicism could assuage. If there is an absence at the heart of
Moorehead's book, it is there within Origo--hers a restless and
incomplete life, fleetingly consoled by art.</TE>

<DH>A LONG STRANGE TRIP: The Inside History of the Grateful
Dead, By Dennis McNally, Broadway Books: 684 pp., $30</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HAL ESPEN</AU>
<BD>Hal Espen is the editor of Outside Magazine.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Has any band ever worn out its critical welcome so thoroughly and
grindingly as the Grateful Dead? By the time lead guitarist and
songwriter Jerry Garcia died at age 53 in August 1995, the Dead was
long past its creative prime but more popular and more beloved than
ever among the swirl-dancing true-believer fans who never seemed to
mind the endless variations on the same revolving set list of the
same old songs. Let other bands from the '60s fade to black; for 30
years, the Grateful Dead refused to die.</LD>
<LD>   For those of us who witnessed the sparkling genius of the Dead in
its first decade or so and then watched the scene flicker and dim
into a ritual of reenactment, the band's story is a tale of
exhilarating discovery and lost promise. But however dark the ending,
even a lapsed Deadhead can recall the heartbreaking incandescence of
long ago and forgive the impulse to revisit and re-create something
that's gone forever.</LD>
<TE>   The stark truth about the latter days of the Dead is this: For the
last two decades of his life, Garcia was a drug addict first and a
musician second; squandering his great gifts, he wrote only a handful
of first-rate songs after the mid-'70s and made inspired, focused
music only fitfully. Yet even as the Dead lost its edge and its
countercultural subversiveness, becoming as safe and cuddly as the
dancing teddy bear that was its latter-day marketing mascot, its
popularity soared, and the Grateful Dead was transformed into a
multimillion-dollar concert touring machine bankrolled by a huge fan
base of weekend hippies and '60s reenactors--the rapt, loyal,
obsessive, uncritical, pathetic Deadheads. Feeding the machine meant
keeping Garcia propped up and plugged in, no matter how terrible he
looked or played. When this cynical enterprise collapsed with
Garcia's demise, there was enormous sadness but also an odd glint of
relief. (The recent reunion of surviving members, who performed as
The Other Ones, was strictly an exercise in nostalgia staged for the
incurable fanatics.)</TE>
<TE>   Now, seven years into the band's afterlife, perhaps we're all
ready to look past the long decline and revisit the original splendor
of the Dead in the morning of its wild youth. And so this may be a
timely moment for "A Long Strange Trip" to arrive. Although
historian-turned-publicist Dennis McNally spent 20 years working on
this official biography of the band, the appearance at long last of
his 684-page tome may turn out to reflect a propitious delay rather
than mere procrastination.</TE>
<TE>   "A Long Strange Trip" is written from a seat inside the bus.
McNally earned a doctorate in American studies and wrote an excellent
biography of Jack Kerouac, "Desolate Angel" (1979). Garcia admired
the book; in the early 1980s he invited McNally to document the
Grateful Dead. The writer's fly-on-the-wall role soon morphed into a
paying gig as the band's press spokesman, a job he continues to
perform on behalf of the Dead's thriving posthumous enterprises.</TE>
<TE>   On its face, this might seem to be a fatal corruption of the
author's objectivity. On the other hand, no matter how dysfunctional
it became, the business culture of the Grateful Dead organization
always preserved a spirit of ornery iconoclasm and a keen aversion to
hype and mindless good cheer; thus, McNally writes with candor about
the unvarnished good, bad and ugly in the Grateful Dead saga.</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes, especially when almost all the details of a life have
already been told many times before, the best service a biographer
can perform is to put the profuse facts of a life story in a clear
chronological order. In "A Long Strange Trip," the effect of
McNally's conscientious work is two-fold: He rescues the Grateful
Dead from the spotlight-hogging effects of Garcia's aura and
reputation, thoughtfully rendering both the range of personalities in
and around the band and the larger social canvas the Dead were part
of; and he conjures afresh the pure, unaccountable, jolting weirdness
of the unrepeatable moment when manufactured psychedelics burst into
American popular culture and ran riot through literature, music,
fashion and lifestyles, with fateful consequences that we're still
fighting about and still trying to understand.</TE>
<TE>   The Grateful Dead were five Bay Area kids and one New Yorker,
drummer Mickey Hart. Jerry Garcia grew up in his mom's bar and on the
streets of San Francisco and became a fanatical bluegrass enthusiast
before LSD and amplifiers took over in the spring of 1965. (It was
bluegrass, even more than the blues, jazz and country styles he
mastered, that gave Garcia's guitar sound its singularity.) Rhythm
guitarist Bob Weir was a rich kid (he was only 16 when he hooked up
with Garcia in 1964) from the Peninsula; he was also adopted and
severely dyslexic. Ron McKernan, "Pigpen," the first Dead casualty
(cirrhosis got him at age 27 in 1973), was a blues-saturated
alcoholic white singer, harmonica player and keyboardist who grew up
in a black neighborhood of East Palo Alto. Bassist Phil Lesh was a
geeky Berkeley-trained composer of abstruse classical compositions
who became the Dead's mad subwoofer. Bill Kreutzmann, who played most
of the time in tandem with Hart, was a virtuoso R&amp;B drummer. In the
summer and fall of '65 they sharpened their chops as a tough bar
band, calling themselves the Warlocks.</TE>
<TE>   At a party in San Jose on Dec. 4 of that year, the band--by then
the Grateful Dead--performed at what became known as the first Acid
Test, where a group of attendees including Neal Cassady, Ken Kesey, a
UC Berkeley journalist named Jann Wenner and assorted members of the
Hells Angels motorcycle club shot into the stratosphere. This
historic evening begat the hippies, "Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Heart's
Club Band," the epic tomfoolery of Tom Wolfe's "Electric Kool-Aid
Acid Test" and much else that came to be known as "the Sixties."</TE>
<TE>   LSD and the Acid Tests put the Grateful Dead on the world culture
map and gave the band's rise its revolutionary force. The band's
equipment guru, a prodigy from Alexandria, Va., named Augustus Owsley
Stanley III, doubled as a one-man LSD conglomerate: In home
laboratories, this whiz-kid chemist produced 1.62 million doses of
the drug between 1965 and 1967 (LSD was legal in California until
Oct. 6, 1966), selling some to help keep the band afloat financially
and giving the rest away.</TE>
<TE>   With a great sense of humor, no sense of limits and plenty of
brain candy to sell, the Dead turned into the living fulfillment of
the most paranoid fantasies of the law-and-order types: They really
did come for your children, and they didn't just glamorize drugs,
they fronted a wholesale operation to distribute them. (My favorite
picture of the Dead, shot by Bob Seidemann in 1967, shows the band
dressed in black and looking gloriously Satanic on a barren street of
tract homes in Daly City.) Real revolution, the kind with non-groovy
politics and real violence, never tempted the Dead--after all, these
were mostly well-bred suburban boys--but the band did have an
indirect hand in enabling the ugly side of stoned anarchy, as when a
concertgoer was stabbed and beaten to death by the Dead's buddies,
the Hells Angels, during a Rolling Stones concert at Altamont in
1969.</TE>
<TE>   Yes, girls and boys, there was a time when the Dead were punks.
Still, however heedless and sardonic and delinquent, the band
remained, for most of its run, an endearingly benign project. (Much
of what is appealing and humane about the Grateful Dead worldview can
be credited to Robert Hunter's well-crafted and poetic lyrics.) Their
psychedelic utopianism is a more problematic matter. As avid
proponents of hallucinogens and purveyors of ecstatic marathon
concerts, the Dead helped blow open a sizable door of perception and
give thousands of fans a glimpse, through that door, of a
pearlescent, heroically gorgeous universe of color, cosmic humor and
unlimited freedom.</TE>
<TE>   But psychedelics, like all drugs, carry risks more subtle than
predictable downsides like psychosis and addiction. Sadly (or not),
you can't live on the far side of that door into eternity, no matter
how intelligent you or your drugs may be. Garcia, in particular,
chose to believe that you could jam that visionary door open and stay
high forever, and by the time he tried to get off the jet to the
Promised Land, it was too late.</TE>
<TE>   Amazingly, at least for a while, out of the chaos the Grateful
Dead created brilliant music, in songs and improvisational jams, in
concert and on records. Starting in 1969, a string of five great
albums--"Live Dead," "Workingman's Dead," "American Beauty,"
"Grateful Dead (Skull and Roses)," and "Europe '72"--formed an
aesthetic mother lode that ensured they would outlive the
counterculture. This winning streak gave them the artistic capital
they lived on for decades to come.</TE>
<TE>   By the late '70s, hard drugs--cocaine, a smokable opium called
Persian--settled in for the long haul, and the flow of new
masterpieces dwindled and dried up. The new fans didn't mind, and
some nights, the band still performed miracles of effortless
synchronicity. Yet the story was no longer about heroism but about
longevity; not about a new heaven and Earth but about every form of
petty tempest and bickering you can find on every episode of VH-1's
"Behind the Music." And then--with 20 years gone in a flash--Garcia's
dead.</TE>
<TE>   Even so, it's hard to read "A Long Strange Trip" as a tragedy.
Every sin you care to lay at the feet of the Grateful Dead has
already been anticipated, admitted, confessed to and guiltily
acknowledged in the dark threads that were always woven into the woof
of their lyrical tapestry. In songs populated by thieves, killers,
losers, victims, confidence men, fugitives, escape artists,
pranksters, tricksters, bootleggers, affectless dopers and phony
messiahs, the Dead declared its independence from responsibility,
clear purpose, sobriety and propriety. "I don't think of myself as an
adult," Garcia told a hostile punk-rock interviewer in London in
1981. "An adult is someone who's made up their mind .... I feel like
someone who is constantly on the verge of losing it, or blowing it."</TE>
<TE>   McNally's chronicle is a more coolheaded, sweeping and evenhanded
affair than the one previous insider's account of note, former band
manager Rock Scully's harrowing and frequently hilarious 1996 memoir,
"Living with the Dead." From the mid-'60s to the mid-'80s, Scully
shared the Dead's altered-consciousness fun-ride, eventually hitting
the wall and crashing out of the game. Looking back with justified
incredulousness, he throws a harsh, painful light on the greedhead
drugginess and infantile decadence of the Grateful Dead's story: It's
a junkie parable. McNally's discreet historicism tends to round off
the jagged, crazy highs and smooth out the horrific lows, and he is
more insistent about the band's lasting achievement.</TE>
<TE>   "The Grateful Dead isn't really a rock band," he declares. "The
band's body of work could lay serious claim to comparison with that
of Ives, Gershwin, Ellington, and (Miles) Davis, or any of the other
great American composer/performers. So long as there are people who
listen to music, there will be Dead Heads." The two books together
approximate a rough justice, both the gutter and the stars.</TE>

<HD>Breaking Away</HD>
<DH>THE RIDER: By Tim Krabbe, Translated from the Dutch by Sam
Garrett, Bloomsbury: 152 pp., $19.95</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN FREEMAN</AU>
<BD>John Freeman is a writer in New York.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Some men take up golf; others sky diving. As he neared 30, Dutch
novelist Tim Krabbe did something halfway between these extremes: He
began racing bicycles. In less than five years he logged more than
300 races. The Tour de Mont Aigoual, No. 309, is a grueling
137-kilometer, half-day event that he depicts in his nervy and
fascinating book "The Rider," first published in 1978 and now
translated into English for the first time.</LD>
<LD>   The story begins five minutes before race time, with Krabbe
stuffing figs and orange slices into his pockets. One can almost feel
the adrenaline rushing. Wheeling his bike to the starting line,
Krabbe introduces us to his friends and foes. There's Kleber, his
training partner; Barthelemy, his onetime nemesis; and Reilhan, a
19-year-old feared for his awesome sprint.</LD>
<LD>   Once the gun goes off, these men begin a battle that has new
developments on every page. After a few kilometers, several unknown
riders break away from the peloton, the rolling pack that hangs
together to cut down wind resistance. Krabbe stays put for the time
being, heeding the wisdom of the great cyclist, Henri Pelissier:
"Always attack as late as you can, but before the others do."</LD>
<TE>   As he describes the race, kilometer by kilometer (the course is
also a stage in the Tour de France), Krabbe draws on bits of cycling
lore. On a treacherous downhill, he remembers the story of a cyclist
who spun off a course, only to climb back on his bike and win. As it
starts to rain, he thinks back on race 177, when a rider slid over a
slick cobblestone surface into an oncoming car. Luckily the rider
escaped with a broken leg. (Others have been less fortunate.)</TE>
<TE>   As the race continues, these fears dissolve. Krabbe's mind begins
to resemble "a monolithic ball bearing, so smooth, so uniform, that
you can't even see it spin." His language, though, grows fractured
and intense; his focus is winning.</TE>
<TE>   "This is the crunch," he writes of the halfway point, as a group
of riders make a break: "anyone who's not in on this one isn't going
to win.... Kleber's legs are visibly spattering all over the place. I
think: butcher. All adjoining parts of my brain--the tactile part,
the olfactory, the computing center--are brought in to help think:
butcher, butcher. Lebusque is tearing the race apart."</TE>
<TE>   As the race nears its climax, Krabbe's narration grows even more
feverish, revealing how a simple road race can become the apotheosis
of a man's life. With 37 kilometers to go, Krabbe finds himself in
the lead pack. "We are five men hanging motionless by our fingertips
from a high windowsill, waiting until someone has to let go."</TE>
<TE>   Eventually, the race dribbles down to three, and readers should
check their pulse if their hands are not sweating. While this degree
of suspense is admirable, it's not this book's greatest feat. By so
effectively capturing the textures of his sport, Krabbe does what no
Tour de France broadcast has ever done: He transports the reader
inside the head of the rider.</TE>

<DH>THE FOURTH STAR: Dispatches From Inside Daniel Boulud's
Celebrated New York Restauran,t By Leslie Brenner, Clarkson Potter:
320 pp., $25</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BARRY GLASSNER</AU>
<BD>Barry Glassner is the author of "The Culture of Fear"
and is writing a book on American food culture.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A decade ago, American readers were enthralled by stories about
burgeoning Internet companies and the people who ran them. How
quickly things change. The wonder boys of that bygone era, and our
fascination with them, seem as outmoded now as a 60 MHz
microprocessor.</LD>
<LD>   So will it be, no doubt, with today's star chefs. Nearly all of
them, and their restaurant empires as well, eventually will go the
way of the fondue pot. The public's attention will shift to a
different genus of creative entrepreneurs. But ours is the age of the
Food Network and bestsellers about goings-on in the dry-goods area of
restaurant pantries. High-end eateries and their chefs have
incredible cachet.</LD>
<LD>   Now comes what may be the most thorough, behind-the-scenes
examination ever written about a restaurant. Leslie Brenner, an
accomplished food writer, spent much of the year 2000 at Daniel, a
New York restaurant regularly on lists of the nation's finest.</LD>
<TE>   Brenner interviewed the staff in the kitchens, dining rooms,
business offices and, yes, the storage and receiving areas. Her
exhaustive rendition of what she saw and heard will leave even the
most inquisitive foodie, well, stuffed.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, near the end of the book, describing an evening's dinner
service, Brenner interrupts her own narration. "And so it goes," she
writes, apparently worn out from hundreds of pages of painstaking
description. By this point, she has relayed, well-nigh verbatim,
numberless exchanges between cooks and detailed the fate of every
ingredient in dozens of dishes. ("A large, perfectly seared sea
scallop sits atop gratineed asparagus and a drizzle of aged balsamic
vinegar ... ") Brenner even inventories the sous-chefs' footwear
(French cooks prefer clogs, others wear running shoes).</TE>
<TE>   Blessed with an encyclopedic knowledge of ingredients and cooking
techniques, and able to record conversations in shorthand, Brenner
probably could have written an entire book about a single meal. Given
the depth of her knowledge, it might have been more compelling than
the book she wrote, which suffers from repetition and counterfeit
suspense.</TE>
<TE>   Nothing much changes at the restaurant between Jan. 4, the first
of her dispatches, and Dec. 18, the last. "Specials" are devised each
day by the chefs, the menu undergoes an overhaul every season, staff
quit and get replaced. Fundamentally, though, life inside Daniel
consists of one arduous lunch and dinner after another, much as it
does at any crowded restaurant.</TE>
<TE>   To be sure, Brenner tries valiantly to eke out a story line about
her hero, Daniel Boulud, the chef and owner, and his quest for a
four-star rating from the restaurant critic for the New York Times.
(Boulud had four stars at his previous restaurant, after all.) With
$10 million invested in the new place, and some of the world's most
talented sous-chefs on his payroll, it could only be a matter of time
before he triumphs again.</TE>
<TE>   Nor, contrary to the publicity copy, can Brenner dish out "the
kind of delectable, undercover details" that made a bestseller of
Anthony Bourdain's "Kitchen Confidential." Boulud is as genteel as
Bourdain is coarse, and Brenner admires Boulud and his lieutenants
too much to rag on them.</TE>
<TE>   Rather than an expose, "The Fourth Star" is an appreciation of a
chef whom the author describes as a brilliant manager and "a mature
artist working at the top of his game." There are revelations in
Brenner's book, plenty of them, but they are the kind that gratify
those of us who wonder what grade of wine is used for the wine
reduction sauce and what kind of knife the chef prefers.</TE>
<TE>   When Brenner ventures into Daniel's pantry, her shocking finding
is not a copulating couple, but Minute Rice. Who would have thought,
amid the Valrhona chocolate, Banyuls wine vinegar and Colavita Extra
Virgin olive oil, there would be Heinz ketchup and Minute Rice?</TE>

<DH>REVOLUTION IN ZANZIBAR: An American's Cold War Tale, By
Donald Petterson, Westview Press: 286 pp., $28</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL HARE</AU>
<BD>Paul Hare is the author of "Angola's Last Best Chance
for Peace." He was a career foreign service officer specializing in
Africa and the Middle East and was U.S. ambassador to Zambia and U.S.
special envoy for the Angolan peace process.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Donald Petterson's diplomatic tale takes us back to an earlier era
when the British colonial empire had expired and the local Arab
rulers of newly independent Zanzibar had a precarious hold over the
island's African majority. Located a little more than 20 miles off
the coast of eastern Africa, the fabled island of Zanzibar had long
served as a bridgehead for Arab penetration of Africa and a center of
trade and slaving operations.</LD>
<LD>   Petterson, a foreign service officer on his first tour overseas
and a speaker of Swahili, was an eyewitness to what followed. Fueled
by resentment and rage accumulated over the years, the Africans rose
up against the Arabs in January 1964. In the space of a few days,
5,000 people--or about one-tenth of Zanzibar's Arab population--were
estimated to have been killed. The sultan and his retinue fled the
island.</LD>
<TE>   In the large sweep of history, this incident would have been of
little consequence, but the revolution in Zanzibar rang alarms at the
highest levels in Washington and London. Like our concerns about
Castro's Cuba in this hemisphere, it was feared that the Communist
bloc would gain a foothold on the island that could then be used to
destabilize East Africa's newly independent states. These concerns
were well-founded. The Soviets, East Germans, Chinese and other
countries were soon providing advisors, military equipment and funds
to the new leaders of Zanzibar, many of whom had communist
sympathies.</TE>
<TE>   The British and the Americans had few tools in their arsenal to
counter this threat. Although the American ambassador in London,
David Bruce, suggested Zanzibar offered an opportunity to test the
mettle of America's covert operations, this option was never
seriously entertained. Nor was the use of military force unless
British and American lives were in danger, which was not the case.
The two Western powers did make a number of diplomatic approaches to
the leaders of Kenya, Tanganyika and Uganda in an effort to obtain
their intervention to stem the radical tide in Zanzibar, but their
efforts fell on fallow ground.</TE>
<TE>   In the end, the Africans found their own solution to this danger
without any outside help or even consultation. Sensing that radical
elements in Zanzibar were becoming stronger by the day, and taking
advantage of the travel out of the country of Zanzibar's leading
hardliner, President Julius Nyerere of Tanganyika took matters into
his own hands and secretly negotiated with the more moderate
president of Zanzibar a political union between the two countries.</TE>
<TE>   While warmly welcomed, this development took London and Washington
by surprise. The new political entity joining the mainland and the
island was called Tanzania and has lasted until today, though the
island of Zanzibar continues to retain its unique heritage and
identity.</TE>
<TE>   Petterson's account is peppered with crises and personal dramas
ranging from problems with his first boss, who drank too much, to
dangerous encounters with local authorities. In fact, one of his
bosses, Frank Carlucci, who much later became secretary of defense in
the Reagan administration, was declared persona non grata and ordered
to leave the country for an injudicious choice of words on a tapped
telephone line. Petterson speculates that one of the communist
intelligence agencies had edited the telephone conversation to make
it appear that the Americans were engaged in a plot with dissident
Zanzibaris to overthrow the government. Petterson was also ordered to
leave at another time on charges that he was a spy. Some of the more
fiery revolutionaries thought he should be shot, but fortunately more
moderate voices prevailed.</TE>
<TE>   "Revolution in Zanzibar" is a compelling narrative that provides a
glimpse of a moment in the Cold War that soon disappeared from view.
With a sharp eye, Petterson describes in unvarnished detail the array
of African politicians with whom he had to deal and the beauty of the
island's "azure sea, verdant landscape, and beaches of white sand."
Interspersed throughout are accounts of raising a family in what can
only be described as a highly volatile and often dangerous
environment. He recounts colorful vignettes including when his wife,
who was born in Mexico, met Che Guevara at a state ball. When asked
what she was doing in Zanzibar, she replied in Spanish that she was
the wife of the American consul. Che walked away.</TE>
<TE>   Petterson ends his book on a somber note. He recounts revisiting
Zanzibar more than 20 years later, when he was the ambassador to
Tanzania. He found the infrastructure and roads in greater disrepair
and poverty worse than before the revolution. The price of cloves,
one of Zanzibar's main crops, had plummeted and foreign aid had left
little in its wake. While Petterson sees rays of hope here and there,
he writes, reluctantly but honestly, I believe, that "for most of
Africa, the outlook for decades ahead, at least, is bleak."</TE>

<DH>AFTER THE DANCE: A Walk Through Carnival in Jacmel, Haiti,
By Edwidge Danticat, Crown Journeys: 160 pp., $16</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL HARRIS</AU>
<BD>Michael Harris is a regular contributor to Book Review.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Haiti is "a country where people are poor in money perhaps, but rich
in culture," a festival organizer in Jacmel, a southern coastal city,
tells Edwidge Danticat, who left Haiti at 12 (almost 30 years ago)
when her family moved to the United States.</LD>
<LD>   "Carnival is our chance to show our kind of wealth." Readers of
Danticat's fiction--the novels "Breath, Eyes, Memory" and "The
Farming of Bones" and the short-story collection "Krik? Krak!"--may
be initially disappointed that this book is a travel piece,
commissioned for the Crown Journeys series. (The publisher's idea: to
send great writers to places they know or would love to visit and
have them take a walk and write about it.)</LD>
<LD>   Yet Danticat makes Haiti, at least Jacmel at Carnival time, a
place we'd like to visit--a considerable feat, given that nation's
image. For generations, almost everything we have read about
Haiti--from Graham Greene's "The Comedians" to Madison Smartt Bell's
slave-revolt novels to news reports of atrocities and refugees--has
reinforced our idea of the place as a sink of violence, poverty and
hopelessness.</LD>
<TE>   Danticat had a personal reason for going to Jacmel, the site of
Haiti's most famous Carnival celebration, in the winter of 2001. As a
child, she was discouraged from attending Carnival. Well-meaning
relatives warned her of the dangers of crowds of drunken revelers, of
zombies and demons, of dirty old men who would squeeze young girls
"like sponges." She wanted to experience the festival without the
fear--and, in so doing, discovered that the exorcism of fear is
Carnival's very purpose.</TE>
<TE>   One of the sources of longtime dictator Francois "Papa Doc"
Duvalier's power, Danticat says, was his ability to twist this
usually benign magic in his favor. He would often dress in black like
the voodoo god Baron Samedi, lord of cemeteries, "reminding all
Haitians that he literally held the key to the cemeteries and could
decide at will who the next inhabitants would be."</TE>
<TE>   More commonly, Carnival costumes and masks are meant to reassure
as well as scare. A chaloska, a character "in military garb with a
protruding mouth and claw-like teeth," Danticat says, is "based on an
actual military officer, Charles Oscar Etienne, who terrorized Jacmel
in the early 1900s." Children are taught to say: "Chaloska, I'm not
afraid of you; you're a human being."</TE>
<TE>   Carnival "zombies" elicit the same response. Danticat recalls, as
a child, hearing a radio report that zombies had been seen wandering
in Haiti's northern mountains. Her aunt concluded that they were
"former political prisoners ... who were so mentally damaged by
dictatorship-sponsored torture that they had become either crazy or
slow." The aunt "doubted that any relatives would go and get them,
for fear of being locked up themselves."</TE>
<TE>   Political messages simmer on the surface of the celebration. Some
Carnival characters are slaves and masters from French colonial
times. The most popular float at the 2001 event portrayed a U.S.
Coast Guard cutter intercepting a raft of Haitian refugees, many of
whom "drowned." A song blared, "We are selling the country in U.S.
dollars," within earshot of the U.S. ambassador.</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, one of the heroic characters at the Jacmel
Carnival is based on a U.S. Army sergeant, Sam Makanani, who rode
into town in his Humvee during the 1994 invasion to reinstate
President Jean-Bertrand Aristide and collar the military government's
goons. "The Cowboy," like the chaloska, has been immortalized in
papier-mache masks and dance.</TE>
<TE>   Danticat tells us more than we need to know about the origins of
Carnival in antiquity. Haiti is interesting enough. She walks through
cemeteries, farms and one of the country's few remaining forests. She
talks to preachers, vendors, musicians, poets and the organizers for
whom Carnival has become a way of life. She quotes writers we should
know better, such as the Jacmel-born novelist Rene Depestre. Finally
she joins the dancers, sloughing off her childhood fears to
participate in "explosions of rapture and beauty in a country that is
not supposed to have any joy."</TE>

<HD>Why Gorbachev Is Russia's Unsung Hero</HD>
<DH>ARMAGEDDON AVERTED: The Soviet Collapse 1970-2000, By
Stephen Kotkin, Oxford University Press: 246 pp., $25</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NINA KHRUSHCHEVA</AU>
<BD>Nina Khrushcheva teaches international affairs at New
School University in New York. She is the granddaughter of former
Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For more than 10 years, the West has strutted about in celebration of
its triumph over communism. Although the political direction Russia
will take is still uncertain (will Russia ultimately return to
authoritarianism or did President Putin's post-Sept. 11 meeting with
President Bush in Crawford, Texas, signal Russia's permanent turn to
democracy?), no one has seriously considered the risks posed by the
Soviet empire's disintegration. Did it, indeed, open the door to a
possible Armageddon?</LD>
<LD>   In "Armageddon Averted," Stephen Kotkin suggests that the collapse
of communism could have created a catastrophe of the highest order.
What's more, he's surprised that it didn't. Kotkin expertly lays out
the chilling prospect that "with the horrid example of much smaller
Yugoslavia's catastrophic break-up right next door, one shudders to
think of the manipulative wars, indeed the nuclear, chemical, or
biological Armageddon that could have accompanied the Soviet
collapse."</LD>
<LD>   The necessity of the Soviet empire's implosion is rarely
questioned. The abundance of books devoted to it often deal with the
West's failure in shaping viable economic reforms for Russia. Other
books, such as "Kapitalizm" by Rose Brady, glorified the young
reformers in Boris Yeltsin's cabinet while Chrystia Freeland's "Sale
of the Century" accused those same reformers of corruption and
financial crimes.</LD>
<TE>   Most of these, however, lack a broad framework, a signature style
of "Armageddon Averted." Kotkin's previous book, "Magnetic Mountain:
Stalinism as a Civilization," dealt with Russia's massive industrial
production, examining its importance as a driving force for the
economy and national life. In "Armageddon Averted," he ties Soviet
industry to the revolution in world communication which began in the
1970s with computers (and which seemed to consign heavy industry and
military production to the dustbin of history).</TE>
<TE>   The Soviet Union's military-industrial "system had no mechanisms
of self-correction" in the face of this economic challenge. Indeed,
Moscow reacted to the changing world by falling into a recession in
the early 1980s, fortunately followed by the open-minded Mikhail
Gorbachev's ascendance to power in 1985.</TE>
<TE>   It is a commonly held belief that perestroika and post-communism
failed because, after 1985, economic prosperity assessments were made
not with the Russian past, when "the Soviet population was better
fed, better clothed and better educated ... but with the richest
nations in the world." Privatization, for example, as run by Anatoly
Chubais in the 1990s, was first seen as the only hope for Russian
capitalism and then as the worst disaster since Stalin's purges. "The
increasing public outcries over the need to guarantee property rights
testified not only to the distance Russia still had to go, but also
to how far it had come," Kotkin writes.</TE>
<TE>   Kotkin skillfully combines historical analysis with an examination
of the social psychology of leadership, following the fine example of
Robert Tucker in his monumental three-volume study of Joseph Stalin.
Kotkin explains how Gorbachev's commitment to improve his country
along the lines of widely accepted global norms, rather than maintain
the nation's closed nature, was a key factor in averting disaster.</TE>
<TE>   There have been many notable books on Gorbachev, but Gorbachev's
crucial role in the transition from socialism to capitalism was
overshadowed by Yeltsin's outbursts and his monarchical-anarchical
style of rule (one finds this in books by Lilia Shevtsova and Leon
Aron). Kotkin reexamines the Gorbachev factor, taking into
consideration all we have learned about the Soviet collapse over the
last decade of post-communist transition.</TE>
<TE>   The parade of independence among Soviet republics in the late
1980s and early '90s, as well as the liberation of Poland, the fall
of the Berlin Wall, Czechoslovakia's Velvet Revolution and,
ultimately, the end of the Cold War, were not the result of Ronald
Reagan's Star Wars budgets, which supposedly bankrupted the Soviet
system as it desperately tried to catch up.</TE>
<TE>   Kotkin asserts that, with a flair for "characteristically American
self-promotion," officials of the Reagan and (first) Bush
administrations were found to be "pirating credit for [the Soviet
collapse]" even as Gorbachev's romanticism fueled a Soviet commitment
to reform socialism. In fact, Gorbachev himself confirmed this notion
in a recent conversation that I had with him, telling me that
"Nicolae [Ceausescu, the communist Romanian dictator] said to me, 'We
have to save Poland from Solidarnost.' But I couldn't do it. We were
already withdrawing soldiers from Afghanistan. We did let the
Czechoslovakians go. And as for the Berlin Wall, I would never have
sent the troops there. We had to stop dictating to the world how to
live their lives."</TE>
<TE>   Kotkin echoes these sentiments: "For him [Gorbachev], amid the
turmoil of perestroika, to have returned to Stalinist methods to
preserve the system would have not only destroyed his international
reputation but would have made a lie out of his whole inner life."</TE>
<TE>   Gorbachev's personal affirmation of Kotkin's analysis is one of
those almost unprecedented in Russia: an occasion when a historical
figure unknowingly confirms the assessment of him by a historian.
Reforming Soviet socialism, Kotkin explains, "meant breaking with
anything that resembled Stalinism or Brezhnevism, including domestic
military crackdown; even the men who belatedly attempted in August
1991 to salvage the Union chose not to mobilize more than a tiny
fraction of their available might, which in any case they failed to
use. In this light, perestroika should be judged as stunning
success." (This is a useful reminder to those who complain that
Russia is not doing well enough quickly enough.)</TE>
<TE>   Kotkin tackles the question of institutional deficit, explaining
why Russia's post-communist system was not corrupt as the West sees
it, but " 'pre-corrupt,' a condition whereby everyone to varying
degrees was a violator, but only the weak were targeted."</TE>
<TE>   He compares the Russian situation with the United States
experience: "Imagine Wall Street--corrupt as it is already--if
regulations were nonexistent. Or American business if regulations
functioned as a pretext for the petty to extract 'fines' and the
powerful to crush competitors and those without connection." He
concludes that "capitalism without government regulations or with
random and manipulated government was not pretty: Russia,
paradoxically, needed both far, far deeper economic liberalization,
and much better government regulation."</TE>
<TE>   Explaining this situation in post-Soviet Russia in a section
wittily titled "Institutional kasha," Kotkin makes a compelling
distinction between liberalism and democracy as it has developed in
Russia: "Democratic but not liberal, it had a constitutionally
all-powerful president [Yeltsin] with limited effective power.
Indeed," he continues, "Russia had more than twenty presidents" in
the various regions and republics that comprised the new Russian
Federation. Russia's problem was that it tried to apply liberal
freedoms at a time when its legal structures remained authoritarian.
It was all too eager to become a capitalistic democracy, which
ignited the removal of all institutional constraints beginning in
1991.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile "liberalism," Kotkin reminds us, "entails not freedom
from government but constant, rigorous officiating of the private
sphere ... It means not just representative government but effective
government, a geopolitical imperative for prosperity in the
hierarchical world economy."</TE>
<TE>   In fact, this contradiction between Russia's social and
institutional landscape compelled Washington to shift " 'blame' for
Russia's 'failure' " to a less politically sensitive organization,
the International Monetary Fund. But, Kotkin explains, "Russia's was
not, and could not have been, an engineered transition to the market.
It was a chaotic, insider, mass plundering of the Soviet era, with
substantial roots prior to 1991, and ramifications stretching far
into the future."</TE>
<TE>   Kotkin thoughtfully opposes the argument that Putin has brutally
suppressed freedom of the press, pointing out that in fact "nowhere
were the paradoxes of post-Soviet Russia more evident than in its
media." In the last few years, leadership changes at NTV, a private
television station, one of Russia's foremost anti-government
champions, have been regarded as proof of Putin's dictatorial
influence. What's omitted from such accusations, however, is that NTV
took out loans for hundreds of millions of dollars from the Russian
government and simply refused to pay them back. When "Putin's Kremlin
forcibly pressed to have the loans paid," Kotkin writes, "they seemed
to be trying to eliminate one of their chief critics, rather than
upholding the sanctity of contracts, but in fact the two pursuits
could not be separated."</TE>
<TE>   Today with Russia's gross domestic product on the rise, a balanced
budget, progress in tax and land reforms and Putin's unconditional
support for the United States-led war against terrorism, old
perceptions and animosities toward Russia are crumbling: Russia's
growing role among the G-8 nations is a sign of this. In this light
Kotkin's book is particularly important; not just for its account of
Russia's averted Armageddon.</TE>
<TE>   Written a year before the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, Kotkin's
conclusion causes one to shiver as it focuses upon the United States:
"Capitalism is an extremely dynamic source of endless creation, but
also of destruction. Interconnections bring greater overall wealth
but also heightened risks. And the USA--bearing a titanic national
security establishment not demobilized after the Cold War, exhibiting
a combustible mixture of arrogance and paranoia in response to
perceived challenges to its global pretensions, and perversely
disparaging of the very government institutions that provide its
strength--makes for an additional wild card."</TE>

<LD>FIREBOAT</LD>
<LD>   The Heroic Adventures</LD>
<LD>   of the John J. Harvey</LD>
<TE>   By Maira Kalman</TE>
<TE>   Putnam: 48 pp., $16.99</TE>
<TE>   In relating the heroic role of the John J. Harvey on Sept. 11,
Maira Kalman intelligently conveys those unfathomable events in a way
that a picture book audience can comprehend. "Fireboat: The Heroic
Adventures of the John J. Harvey" begins with the year 1931, which
saw some of New York City's finest hours: "Amazing things were
happening big and small. / The Empire State Building went up up up."
She continues with the completion of the George Washington Bridge,
then zeroes in on the launching of the John J. Harvey, "the largest,
fastest and shiniest fireboat of them all."</TE>
<TE>   Spot illustrations show its equipment and introduce the crew
(including "a dog named Smokey, who did not put out the fires but had
many nice spots"), while views of the New York harbor stretch across
a spread. She then fast-forwards to 1995: "New York was changing. The
Twin Towers were now the tallest buildings in New York City." But the
piers are also closing, so the fireboat rests in retirement. One
night, a group of friends decide over dinner to restore the John J.
Harvey to its original glory.</TE>
<TE>   Next, the volume takes an abrupt turn. White type on a black page
announces: "But then on September 11, 2001 something so huge and
horrible happened that the whole world shook." A sequence of spreads
shows the towers literally exploding in dark, angry brushstrokes of
black and gray and orange, followed by the many heroes who "sprang
into action," including the John J. Harvey.</TE>
<TE>   With this inspiring book, Kalman ("Next Stop Grand Central")
sensitively handles a difficult subject in an age-appropriate manner.
(Ages 5 and up)</TE>

<TE>   STAND TALL</TE>
<TE>   By Joan Bauer</TE>
<TE>   Putnam: 192 pp., $16.99</TE>
<TE>   In her heartfelt and humorous novel "Stand Tall," Joan Bauer
leaves teenage girl protagonists in favor of a middle-grade boy--as
she did also in "Sticks" (1996). But her fans won't be disappointed.</TE>
<TE>   At first, 12-year-old Tree, "six feet, three and a half inches and
growing," only literally "stands tall." At school, Coach Glummer
expects him to lead the basketball team (though he's not very
athletic) and teachers expect him to act older than his age. On the
home front--which shifts weekly due to his parents' recent divorce
and joint custody arrangement--Tree is the glue of his family. He
helps care for his Vietnam vet grandfather (who recently had a leg
amputated) while worrying about his aging dog, Bradley, his two
college-student brothers and his parents.</TE>
<TE>   Bolstered by his budding friendship with the outspoken new girl at
school, Sophie, and by Grandpa, Tree finds an inner strength that
helps him deal with just about anything--including a natural
disaster. Bauer ("Hope Was Here") once again creates a clan of
believable characters scrambling to make the best of their particular
brand of dysfunction. Her swiftly paced story artfully blends
poignant and outright funny moments, resulting in a triumphant tale
that will resonate with many young readers. (Ages 10 and up)</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   FARFALLINA &amp; MARCEL</TE>
<TE>   By Holly Keller</TE>
<TE>   HarperCollins/Greenwillow:</TE>
<TE>   32 pp., $15.99</TE>
<TE>   Holly Keller introduces a caterpillar and gosling in "Farfallina &amp;
Marcel," a deceptively simple story of friendship and transformation.
They meet in a rain shower one day: " 'Hey,' said a little voice. /
'You're eating my umbrella,' " says feathered Marcel as Farfallina
(whose name means "little butterfly" in Italian) nibbles on a leaf
over his head. With a minimum of text, Keller ("Cecil's Garden")
describes the charming friendship's beginnings.</TE>
<TE>   When they play hide-and-seek, Farfallina hides under a low fern
"because she knew that Marcel couldn't climb." In turn, Marcel hides
behind a nearby tree "because he knew that Farfallina moved slowly."
A full-page full-bleed painting shows Farfallina riding on the
gosling's back across a lily-pad-dotted pond. One day, the
caterpillar announces that she needs to climb onto a tree branch and
rest for a while, and her patient pal settles in the grass to wait
for her. A series of paintings follows each friend's
metamorphosis--Marcel's change in plumage, Farfallina's emergence
from her cocoon. Finally reunited, neither creature recognizes the
other and again bond as friends nonetheless.</TE>
<TE>   When they realize each other's true identities, Keller conveys
their joy with the pair's fluttering of wings, and their quiet repose
in an eloquently serene spread as they fall asleep "smiling at the
stars." Keller's ending remains true to both nature and friendship
that lasts through the seasons in this perfectly paced book. (Ages 4
and up)</TE>

<TE>   GOSSIE</TE>
<TE>   By Olivier Dunrea</TE>
<TE>   Houghton Mifflin: 32 pp., $9.95</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   GOSSIE &amp; GERTIE</TE>
<TE>   By Olivier Dunrea</TE>
<TE>   Houghton Mifflin: 32 pp., $9.95</TE>
<TE>   "This is Gossie. Gossie is a gosling," opens "Gossie," the first
of Olivier Dunrea's hand-size square volumes starring two likable,
diminutive characters. From the start, the author strikes an
appealing, unorthodox note--Gossie is first seen only from the neck
up, hanging upside-down from the top of the opening page. This
playfulness continues throughout both books.</TE>
<TE>   In the first, Gossie loves her red boots and is distraught when
her fancy footwear goes missing. After searching the farm high and
low, she spots the boots: "They were walking. On someone else's
feet!" Enter Gertie. " 'Great boots!' said Gertie. Gossie smiled."
Gossie shares half of her prized possession with her new, slightly
smaller pal, and the two walk side-by-side, each wearing one red
boot.</TE>
<TE>   In the second story, "Gossie &amp; Gertie," Gertie has her own boots
(a bright blue pair) and asserts her independence. In a sequence of
perfectly timed illustrations, Dunrea depicts Gossie's mounting
frustration--until, finally, she follows Gertie to the supper bowl
they share. Adding ample wry humor to both his spare
ink-and-watercolor pictures and minimalist text, Dunrea imbues both
goslings with distinctive, endearing personalities and chronicles
experiences every preschooler can recognize. (Ages 2-5)</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   TROUT AND ME</TE>
<TE>   By Susan Shreve</TE>
<TE>   Alfred A. Knopf: 144 pp., $15.95</TE>
<TE>   In this moving novel, "Trout and Me," Susan Shreve ("Blister")
again demonstrates her insight into kids outside the mainstream of
school life. Eleven-year-old Ben has hated school since first grade,
when he responded to a classmate's taunts about his lisp by flushing
her teddy bear down the toilet. The well-meaning but dense principal
uses the occasion to test Ben for learning disabilities (he turns out
to have dyslexia and, later, attention deficit disorder), but in the
process makes Ben feel like a "problem child." As Ben, the narrator,
candidly puts it, "Since the teddy bear, everyone expected trouble
from me. So that's what they got."</TE>
<TE>   Now in fifth grade, Ben explains that despite his efforts, "My bad
reputation has followed me like a tail getting longer every year."
Then a new boy named Trout arrives at school, wearing what he claims
is a tattooed question mark on his chin ("If I didn't have a question
mark on my chin, I'd be invisible," he tells Ben). Trout, who also
has learning disabilities, attaches himself to Ben's side "like
Velcro" and the two boys live up to the school's expectations by
getting into trouble, big-time.</TE>
<TE>   The author's evenhandedness gives the story its punch: The adults
think they are doing all the right things, but fail to see how their
attitudes compound the boys' problems. Fusing humor and pathos,
Shreve introduces characters of uncommon dimension and
complexity--and leaves readers with subtle issues to ponder. (Ages
9-12)</TE>

<TE>   JOHN COLTRANE'S GIANT STEPS</TE>
<TE>   By Chris Raschka</TE>
<TE>   Atheneum/Jackson: 32 pp., $17</TE>
<TE>   This innovative visual deconstruction of one of jazz saxophonist
John Coltrane's most beloved compositions may be Chris Raschka's
("Mysterious Thelonious") most ambitious picture book yet. After a
playful introduction ("Good evening. And thank you for coming to our
book"), the unseen narrator-conductor of "John Coltrane's Giant
Steps" introduces the performers--a box, a snowflake, some raindrops
and a kitten--a tongue-in-cheek nod to Coltrane's version of "My
Favorite Things."</TE>
<TE>   The book does not require previous awareness of the jazz great's
work, however. Each performer (representing percussion, bass, piano
and sax) appears in a different color and shape (Raschka riffs on
primary red, yellow and blue, and the basic square, triangle and
circle). The performance begins, only to be interrupted when the
kitten ("the melody on top of everything") takes steps a little too
large ("People, people! What happened?"). Some coaching finally
produces what Coltrane called "sheets of sound."</TE>
<TE>   Raschka's transparent watercolors layer colors and shapes the way
a musician would notes and harmonies. Stunningly simple, the concept
provides a compelling introduction to Coltrane's musical genius.
Those who possess a little musical knowledge will delight in such
arch references as "remixed by Chris Raschka" on the title page and
the conductor's hilarious critique ("First of all, raindrops, you
were rushing on page 19"). Even the jacket repeats the book's central

black outline, overlays the other elements. A must for jazz
enthusiasts and, for first-timers, a clever introduction to this
wildly creative musical genre. (Ages 4-7)</TE>

<DH>TURN OFF YOUR MIND: The Mystic Sixties and the Dark Side
of the Age of Aquarius, By Gary Lachman, Macmillan: 430 pp., $19.95
paper</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL KRASSNER</AU>
<BD>Paul Krassner is the founder and editor of The Realist
and author of "Murder at the Conspiracy Convention and Other American
Absurdities." His most recent album of stand-up satire is "Irony
Lives!" (Artemis Records).</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Along with sex, drugs and rock 'n' roll, there was a spiritual
revolution at the core of the 1960s counterculture. In "Turn Off Your
Mind," however, Gary Lachman (who, as Gary Valentine, was a founding
member of the group Blondie) states, "There was a shadow side to all
the love and peace that supposedly characterized the decade.
Brotherhood and compassion were the face the Sixties showed the
world, but underneath was a different picture. The most obvious
emblem of this is Charles Manson and his Family, responsible for the
gruesome Tate-LaBianca killings that ended the naive optimism of the
flower generation."</LD>
<LD>   "Turn Off Your Mind" offers an alternative chronicle of what went
on in the '60s when, somewhere along the spectrum of expanding
consciousness, many hippies collided with a fascination with black
magic. But Lachman's book reads more like a list of references that
could conceivably serve as an aid in preparing for a stint on "Occult
Jeopardy!"</LD>
<LD>   Here's a sampling:</LD>
<TE>   This group had a professional I Ching consultant who was paid to
toss the coins at their office every morning. Who were The Beatles?</TE>
<TE>   While on LSD, he had paranoid visions of secret messages coming
from Jack Benny and Doris Day on television. Who was Timothy Leary?</TE>
<TE>   In 1970 he received a bachelor's degree in magic from the
University of California in Berkeley. Who is Isaac Bonewits?</TE>
<TE>   He was introduced to witchcraft in his teens by his 74-year-old
grandmother, who taught him by taking his virginity. Who was Alex
Sanders?</TE>
<TE>   His black Mass included crushing a sugar cube soaked in LSD,
urinating on marijuana and hanging a picture of Leary upside down.
Who was Anton LaVey?</TE>
<TE>   He wore a black armband to school, believing the rumor that Paul
McCartney was dead. Who is Gary Lachman?</TE>
<TE>   Lachman indulges in sodomic cosmology, giving readers a limited
sense of how some of the Beats were connected to their mystic
ancestors. Referring to Gavin Arthur, who wrote an astrology column
for the psychedelic weekly, the San Francisco Oracle:</TE>
<TE>   "But perhaps Arthur's biggest claim to sexual fame was the fact
that as a young man he had slept with the late 19th century mystic
and gay activist Edward Carpenter, who was by then in his 70s.
Carpenter himself had slept with the poet Walt Whitman, inspiration
of Beat writers like [Jack] Kerouac and [Allen] Ginsberg, and
Arthur's presence on the Haight provided a link with the original
Beat that was more than literary. Arthur slept with Zen lunatic Neal
Cassady, who had slept with Kerouac and Ginsberg, who had slept with
each other, thus forming an eroto-mystical chain spanning two
centuries."</TE>
<TE>   As for the '60s, "Turn Off Your Mind" focuses on the negative
aspects of a mass awakening that provided hope, inspiration,
joyfulness and a sense of community to countless young people. In the
process, Lachman resorts to the kind of mendacious
generalizations--"As in most ashrams and hippie households, the kids
were abandoned and pretty much left to themselves"--that will surely
appeal to the fundamentalist Christians and '60s-bashing markets.</TE>
<TE>   Though Lachman presents tidbits of truth, he fails to report
interesting details. He discloses that Michael Hollingshead (who
first turned Leary on) "dosed two undercover policemen" but omits the
rest of that story: A pair of Scotland Yard agents had arrested
Hollingshead and were extraditing him from Stockholm. During the
flight he managed to slip LSD into their coffee; they were still
disoriented and hallucinating when the plane landed, so he
disembarked alone, breezed past customs and called Scotland Yard,
advising that Thorazine be administered to ease the agents' return to
ordinary reality.</TE>
<TE>   And his selection of anecdotes isn't without errors. Although he
reports that Manson wrote a weekly column in the L.A. Free Press,
former Free Press publisher Art Kunkin told me that he "brought Ed
Sanders out here to cover the trial, but Manson himself never wrote a
column." Lachman asserts that after Leary escaped from prison, he
"smuggled twenty thousand hits of LSD into Algiers, but Eldridge
Cleaver wasn't interested." Actually, Leary told me, Cleaver did take
acid there, though he insisted on wearing his guns.</TE>
<TE>   There's also a fixation on fascism in the book that taints
Lachman's perceptions. He claims that, "With [Jerry] Rubin, [Abbie]
Hoffman epitomized the new irrationalism that burst upon the radical
scene in the late '60s....The association of late-'60s radicalism
with the Nazis isn't far-fetched. All of Hoffman's and Rubin's
pronouncements are soaked in the political theories of the French
syndicalist George Sorrel, whose 'Reflections on Violence' [1908] was
a powerful influence on Mussolini." And this: "The abyss isn't some
possibility in the future; it is 'here now,' whether it is the start
of Germany's trip to the absolute elsewhere, or the mud-splattered
abandon of Woodstock."</TE>
<TE>   Of course, we all have the capability of surrendering to the
forces of darkness within ourselves, but it's a matter of choice, and
the positive side of the '60s is still alive and celebrating. The
annual Rainbow Family Gathering, which attracts 20,000 people, took
place in the first week of July in Montana; the next weekend the
Oregon Country Fair had 18,000 attendees; and the Burning Man
festival begins Aug. 26 in the Black Rock Desert in Nevada.</TE>
<TE>   In "The Cultural Creatives," Paul Ray and Sherry Anderson estimate
that 50 million Americans are broadly sympathetic to hippie values.
It has been 35 years since the original Human Be-In at Golden Gate
Park; this September--indicating the role of technology in the
counterculture's evolution--there will be a worldwide Digital Be-In.</TE>
<TE>   I suspect that, unless you are a hard-core enthusiast of occult
esoterica, you will find reading this book a chore rather than a
pleasure. Lachman's scholarly approach is marred by his dependence on
secondary research. He takes metaphors literally: "A famous Zen
injunction advises that if we see the Buddha on the road, we should
kill him. Cassady and some of the other mentors of the Beats might
have done just that." And his perspective seems virtually devoid of
humor: He calls Adam Parfrey of Feral House publishers a member of "a
quartet of modern satanic masters, hosting an unholy celebration." In
reality, Parfrey participated in a 1988 show at San Francisco's
Strand Theater with an intentionally silly rendition of "Valley of
the Dolls" on the oboe.</TE>
<TE>   Lachman writes, "Many believed that [Hermann Hesse] received the
Nobel Prize less for his great novel 'The Glass Bead Game' than for
the fact that he hadn't been a Nazi. Hesse had become the focus of
every literate late adolescent with a bad case of Weltschmerz,"
admitting that, "Needless to say, I was one of these." Ah, if only he
had known that Oracle editor Allen Cohen was so enamored of Hesse's
"Siddhartha" that he changed his name to Siddhartha and moved to a
commune, where everybody thought his name was Sid Arthur, and they
all called him Sid. Maybe then Lachman would have lightened up.</TE>

<DH>SLANDER: Liberal Lies About the American Right, By Ann
Coulter, Crown: 258 pp., $25.95</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANDREW H. MALCOLM</AU>
<BD>Andrew H. Malcolm, a former foreign and national
correspondent, editor, government and campaign spokesman, is the
author of such books as "Final Harvest" and "The Canadians." He is a
member of The Times' Editorial Board.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Ann Coulter may be wrong at times. She may be right at others. Or
strident. Even inflammatory. But she is never in doubt. And that,
along with her bright writing, sense of irony and outrage, and her
relish at finally hitting back at political opponents (especially in
the media) is what makes "Slander" such refreshing and provocative
reading.</LD>
<LD>   There often seems an invisible virus afoot in America today. Based
at times on fact and at others on suspicions, it prompts profound and
automatic distrust of some basic institutions, such as government,
politics, the church and business, especially if they are big. Now,
it seems, it's the media's turn to be suspected--of collusion with
liberals in promoting their agenda, which includes demeaning and
dismissing opponents on the right.</LD>
<TE>   There was Bernard Goldberg's bestseller "Bias." Now comes
"Slander," a clever, documented diatribe detailing the media's
alleged liberal orientation with its, at worst, intentional
distortions about conservative opponents and, at best, naive
incantation of liberal views as gospel. In 205 pages of text and 36
more pages of footnotes citing chapter and verse, Coulter skewers
liberal after liberal, TV news division after TV news division and
numerous magazines and newspapers, most especially the New York
Times. Coulter is an attorney, former congressional press secretary
and author of "High Crimes and Misdemeanors: The Case Against Bill
Clinton" who's become a regular Republican on the cable TV political
chat circuit.</TE>
<TE>   To naive news consumers who still think media reporters are merely
objective collectors of facts, Coulter declares: "There is no
intellectual honesty whatsoever in media descriptions of politicians.
Journalism is war by other means."</TE>
<TE>   Her oft-repeated point is that liberals (and you know who you are)
have, in concert with at least compliant and quite likely complicit
media, conspired to poison political dialogue to their advantage by
avoiding substantive discussions and by demeaning conservatives
through stereotypes, name-calling, questioning their intelligence and
worse.</TE>
<TE>   A major Coulter point is the media's ready acceptance of
Democrats' questioning of Republicans' intelligence. Thus, Gerald
Ford, Ronald Reagan and George W. Bush have at least two things in
common: All were president and all were not too smart. Bush's failure
on a TV interviewer's pop quiz of world leaders was, according to
Coulter, endlessly cited as proof of his intellectual challenge. Bush
was asked about it frequently.</TE>
<TE>   In the interests of campaign fairness, Coulter notes
sarcastically, Vice President Al Gore also was asked about Bush's
intelligence. However, according to Coulter, Gore's recorded
inability to recognize, during a tour of Monticello, the busts of
someone named George Washington and Ben Franklin was noted only in
USA Today. Or when Bush's SAT scores were leaked during the 2000
election campaign and roundly bemoaned, few journalists found space
to note they were actually higher than Democratic Sen. Bill
Bradley's.</TE>
<TE>   "Slander" is packed with such examples from recent years, enough
to make Republicans cheer and Democrats groan. You need not like
Coulter, as many clearly don't in the ongoing whisper campaign
against her best-selling book, to admire the clear prose or be
bothered by both the convincing arguments she often presents and the
forceful style she uses, often much the same as the one she
denounces.</TE>
<TE>   Coulter's is a familiar face among the Washington blabocracy that
fills cable TV's insatiable need for talking or, rather, arguing
heads. In theory, democracy's debates enlighten citizens, who listen,
learn and vote better. That's the plan anyway. Too often nowadays,
given the pervasive media's structural need for conflict to attract
crowds of consumers so they can attract advertising and the political
parties' institutional need to keep their partisan crowds in line so
their candidates can win elections, such debates become more like
verbal gladiatorial contests.</TE>
<TE>   Everybody chooses favorites beforehand, cheers theirs and never
mind what either side says or does. The party's pre-printed talking
points on the day's hot issue, emailed to supporters around
Washington and beyond, are duly spouted in earnest efforts to win one
more oratorical skirmish in the never-ending news cycles of endless
election seasons. Some call others names. They throw rhetorical
chairs. The audience applauds. And now these commercial messages.</TE>
<TE>   Any enlightenment is accidental. The fact that most Americans
aren't really listening and many others turn away from such chatter
does not seem to have an effect on the combatants, who move on to the
next show, maybe even sharing a cab to get there.</TE>
<TE>   It's enough to elicit sighs from skeptical unaligned citizens.
Skepticism--careful questioning of any political premise--is always
healthy in a democracy; cynicism--automatic dismissal of others,
especially cynicism for entertainment's sake--is less so. To the
extent "Slander" nurtures more savvy news consumers in the
grandstands surrounding our never-ending political tournaments, it's
helpful. To the extent it adds to the mental scarring of cynicism,
it's not.</TE>

<LD>THE FRUIT OF STONE</LD>
<LD>   By Mark Spragg</LD>
<LD>   Riverhead: 304 pp., $23.95</LD>
<TE>   "And Bennett is his best friend, and Gretchen is Bennett's wife."
There you have it: the plot of this tumbleweed novel, which picks up
bits of story and stray characters as it wobbles down the road after
Gretchen has crawled into "his"--McEban's--bed to say goodbye.</TE>
<TE>   In the end, Gretchen is so much less important than the lifelong
friendship between the two men that she is reduced to a trail of
letters. McEban is likable in spite of the lie at the middle of his
life; he is a man who remembers and dreams, mostly about Gretchen.
Bennett gives the novel its punctuation: He is an unpredictable
picker of fights, a barroom brawler, a howlingly rejected man.
Gretchen leaves him, not for McEban but for a physicist. McEban and
Bennett, two bozos, go looking for her. McEban says goodbye to Ansel,
who has worked on the ranch all his life. He is the novel's home
base, the character who holds the Wyoming landscape in his smile. We
bump along in the pickup from Cody to Jackson to Bozeman as McEban
remembers his childhood, his mother and father and grandmother. All
this jostling on the tumbleweed trail between past and present is a
little jarring.</TE>
<TE>   Wyoming, it seems to me, is the great rodeo for western writers,
each struggling to describe its fabled sky in a different way: "There
are pads of cloud, their edges windtorn to scallop, a handful of them
thrown up before the sun." That same landscape can make a craggy,
gnarled mess of a neat plot: too much metaphor and the novel leaks;
too little poetry and the sky is just a lid on another western novel,
where explanations are scarce and distance sets the tone.</TE>

<TE>   OYSTER</TE>
<TE>   By John Biguenet</TE>
<TE>   Ecco: 288 pp., $23.95</TE>
<TE>   New Orleans is a region unto itself, neither north nor south, east
nor west, an exotic, esoteric land with its own religion and a firm,
if good-natured, adherence to class. The rule of law is always a bit
questionable, and murder is way too easy when a person feels
slighted, at least in fiction.</TE>
<TE>   Mathilde Petijean is a young girl from one of two prominent
oystering families in this Louisiana town. She has been promised,
though it is 1957, to the older head of the rival clan, Horse
Bruneau. Horse gets his nickname from his god-given equipment. He has
two no-account sons and one decent son. Mathilde, a regular Femme
Nikita, murders Horse rather than marry him. In retaliation, the
Bruneau boys murder her brother, who they believe killed their
father. The sheriff, who is always turning up on the scene but never
has any answers, doesn't have the evidence to lock them up. Mathilde
takes the law into her own hands.</TE>
<TE>   "Oyster" clips along, made fascinating by the ins and outs of
oystering and by John Biguenet's wonderful descriptions of Louisiana
bayou cuisine. Competition over oyster beds, and leases for those
beds, quickens as the oil companies drone on in the novel's
background, cutting up the bays and estuaries and making it harder
for the fishermen to earn a living. The desperation that lights up
the novel smolders in Mathilde. She is the character who brings the
satisfying vengeance, who alters history and grabs her own fate. She
is the stuff of fiction.</TE>

<TE>   LAND'S END</TE>
<TE>   A Walk in Provincetown</TE>
<TE>   By Michael Cunningham</TE>
<TE>   Crown Journeys: 176 pp., $16</TE>
<TE>   It's a small territory to cover, but Provincetown bursts at the
seams with gossip and lore and sex. "It is the only small town I know
of," writes Michael Cunningham, who has lived there on and off for 30
years, "where those who live unconventionally seem to outnumber those
who live within the proscribed boundaries of home and licensed
marriage, respectable job and biological children."</TE>
<TE>   Since 1620, when the Mayflower landed in Provincetown (but did not
stay), the town has been populated by outcasts, and this is what
Cunningham, who is from Southern California, loves. A haven for
artists, Provincetown counts as its citizens and visitors over the
last century luminaries such as Eugene O'Neill, Tennessee Williams,
Milton Avery, Edmund Wilson, Norman Mailer, Stanley Kunitz, Mary
Oliver and Mark Doty.</TE>
<TE>   Built on constantly shifting sand, it nonetheless feels like the
safest place in the world to Cunningham, a place where you will not
be judged for strange behavior or sexual habits. A regular night in
the summer will end around 3 a.m with hundreds of people out on the
sidewalk after the last bar and, finally, the last pizza and ice
cream place has closed. The town today "is something like an elderly
bohemian who once knew people of great influence, who still dresses
eccentrically, still lives in defiant poverty, still paints or
sculpts with heroic optimism, and flirts only on bad days with
bitterness about having been gifted and dedicated and having been
left behind."</TE>

<HD>Das Maus</HD>
<DH>HOLLYWOOD FLATLANDS: Animation, Critical Theory and the
Avant-Garde, By Esther Leslie, Verso: 344 pp., $30</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD SCHICKEL</AU>
<BD>Richard Schickel, who reviews movies for Time, is a
contributing writer to Book Review. His study, "The Disney Version,"
is available in paperback.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the beginning was the line: squiggling merrily, unpredictably
across the frame before arranging itself into an abstract geometric
form or perhaps a stick figure doing acrobatic tricks. In those
nearly prehistoric cinematic days, just after the start of the 20th
century , animation entranced the eye and opened the mind,
particularly the eyes and mind of a handful of largely Germanic,
largely Marxist, artists and intellectuals. While the wider
intellectual community debated whether the cinema--that vulgar and
hybrid form--could ever become an art in any customary sense, this
alert minority saw in these little drawn films unique expressive
possibilities, a logical (and often charming) extension of the
modernist revolution gathering force everywhere else in the visual
arts.</LD>
<LD>   Perhaps the most astonishing thing about Esther Leslie's
"Hollywood Flatlands," a dense, often fascinating, sometimes
frustrating history of the theoretical arguments surrounding the
development of animation, is the extent of this discussion. You will
be amazed at the sheer weight of the words that Walter Benjamin,
Theodor Adorno and Max Horkheimer--Marxists all--placed on the
quivering shoulders of Mickey Mouse. They found more to think and
write about in him and his pals than they did in the whole infinitely
larger history of live-action features, which they mostly despised.</LD>
<TE>   They argued persuasively that animation is "absolute" cinema,
owing nothing to any preexisting art and something that could only be
accomplished in movies. This set it definitively apart from dramatic
films, which drew their ruling conventions from 19th century novels
and the melodramatic stage.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, animation in its early days was strictly
two-dimensional, like much of modernist painting. There was no
attempt in movie cartoons to create the illusion of the third
dimension: depth. As Leslie says, the experimental artists of the
early 20th century "found that cartoons touched on many things they
wished to explore: abstraction, forceful outlines, geometric forms
and flatness, questioning of space, time and logic .... "</TE>
<TE>   It was also an art with an implicit political dimension, something
that was not lost on the Marxist theorists, which is why, for a time,
Mickey Mouse became their beau ideal. Mickey and his gang appeared to
them as rebel-victims of the capitalist system. The Mouse, in his
earliest incarnation, was a rubbery, infinitely malleable and not
entirely lovable critter. In an emergency (and there were plenty of
those), his little body could be twisted into machine-like shapes in
order to counter the malevolent, mechanized world that bedeviled him.
Paraphrasing Benjamin, Leslie writes that the cartoons show "that
even our bodies do not belong to us--we have alienated them in
exchange for money." And "[t]he cartoons expose the fact that what
parades as civilization is actually barbarism." And, most
significant: "[t]he cartoons are object lessons in the actuality of
alienation. Disney's cartoon world is a world of impoverished
experience, sadism and violence. That is to say, it is our world."</TE>
<TE>   This is not a totally false reading of early Disney shorts such as
"Steamboat Willie" or "Plane Crazy," though it is rather a humorless
one. You have to doubt that "the massive success of these films" was
based on the fact that "the public recognizes their own lives in
them."</TE>
<TE>   More likely what audiences responded to was a cheeky, cheery,
never-say-die spirit in which The Mouse confronted a world in which
things took on human traits (including malevolence), sorely testing
both his inventiveness and his insouciance.</TE>
<TE>   It would have been all right with the European intellectuals if
Walt Disney--and Leslie's book becomes, by and large, a history of
Disney's enterprise as seen through their eyes--had stayed in that
vein. But, of course, he could not. One doubts that he was even aware
of their attention, though he surely knew about the good--though far
less high-toned--words their American counterparts were saying about
him in the early '30s. What he had on his mind, which was of a
technocratic and entrepreneurial cast, was quite a different
aesthetic (if we dare use that word in this context).</TE>
<TE>   He thought his films' "flatness" was a defect, not a virtue. He
wanted to add the third-dimensional illusion to them and, once he had
the multi-plane camera, that fell within his capabilities. He also
wanted characters to be more "realistic," to more closely resemble
their natural models. At the same time he wanted them to be more
genially human, rounder, softer, cuddlier. Like the vast majority of
his audience, he preferred reality, or some version of it, to
abstraction. He thought it was just fine to introduce drawn
representations of real human beings into his imaginary gardens.
Indeed, he instinctively understood that if he was going to make
feature-length animated films, he was compelled to do so.</TE>
<TE>   It was a course that created consternation among the European
theorists, many of whom, exiled by Hitler, were then in the United
States. Adorno had already conceived an intense antipathy for Donald
Duck, whose splenetic temperament often caused him to be beaten up by
his enemies. He felt these sequences were teaching ordinary Americans
passivity in the face of their capitalist and bourgeois oppressors.</TE>
<TE>   Feature animation, like feature films of every kind, offered more
of the same. The films accurately represented reality's surface as
all of us perceive it but generally indulged the fantasy of
ordinary-seeming men and women heroically triumphing over its
inequities. Mein Gott: The movies even tamed, and then silenced,
Adorno's favorite cartoon character, Max Fleischer's sexually
challenging Betty Boop.</TE>
<TE>   OK--you there in back of the room, stop giggling. These are
serious men trying, however awkwardly, to defend the vulgar energy of
low culture and the austere aspirations of high culture against the
irresistible flood of comfortable, comforting middlebrow culture that
eventually dominated the movies.</TE>
<TE>   But I agree. They are sometimes laughably abstract, as they wheel
their big theoretical guns up and aim them at cartoon characters.
Certainly you wish Leslie, a neo-Marxist English academic, would at
least occasionally argue with them.</TE>
<TE>   For in truth, the movie business, particularly in the
catch-as-catch-can days that particularly concern her, resists
classical Marxist interpretation. Take the matter of length, for
instance. Charming as short cartoons often were, their anarchical
spirit could not sustain audience interest for spans longer than
their abbreviated running times. As did live-action films, they
needed to develop more complex narrative devices. The pressure for
feature length was, in fact, resisted by the capitalists who
controlled the business. It was artists and audiences who insisted on
longer films. It was the same with other innovations, notably sound,
color and, for that matter, "Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs." The
bankers at first saw only that these technologies would add cost to
the products without necessarily increasing profits.</TE>
<TE>   It may be true that in their formative years, the movies had an
unrealized potential to be more poetic or impressionistic. Certainly
there were films, ranging from "Man With a Movie Camera" to "The
Crowd" to "The Gold Rush," that hinted at these possibilities. But
populism spoke louder than poetics or Marxist theory. I think,
finally, that the people chose their own opiate.</TE>
<TE>   But still, it is good to be reminded, as we are by "Hollywood
Flatlands," that the two great alternatives to Hollywood, the Russian
and the German film industries, were crushed by dictatorships. Even
more important, this handsomely designed book reintroduces us to
quaint but not entirely invalid ways of analyzing movies, ways that
looked at commodity fetishism, the alienation of labor, idealized
naturalism. In an age when the Walt Disney Co.--a vast multinational,
heedlessly hawking imagery in venues undreamed of by its founder--is
completely lost to sober cultural debate, it is not insignificant to
remember that, quite recently, the opposite was the case.</TE>
<TE>   The way the old-fashioned intellectuals expressed themselves was
often risible, but we can still discern in their writings an
increasingly faint but quite authentic alarm that we should not
entirely dismiss or ignore.</TE>

<HD>Twist and Shout</HD>
<DH>Who is Norman Podhoretz and why is he (and his friends)
saying all these nasty things?</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LEE SIEGEL</AU>
<BD>Lee Siegel is a contributing writer to Book Review and
the recipient of the 2002 National Magazine Award for reviews and
criticism.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Norman Podhoretz was in Boston, and he was shouting. Norman Podhoretz
had come all the way from New York to Boston to attend a conference
sponsored by Partisan Review magazine titled "Our Country, Our
Culture," and, upon arriving at his panel--the very first panel,
"Intellectuals and Writers Then and Now"--Norman Podhoretz began
shouting. Norman Podhoretz was shouting at a retired high school
history teacher, who had risen from the audience to suggest to Mr.
Podhoretz, with the forced assertiveness of shy people, that some
aspects of American foreign policy had incited the attacks on Sept.
11. Norman Podhoretz responded by shouting, "You're insidious! You're
insidious!"</LD>
<LD>   Norman Podhoretz had come from New York, where he was born and has
lived all his life, to Boston, and Norman Podhoretz was shouting,
every bit as much as if he were back home in his kitchen in New York,
and he was looking around for approval at the audience of about 30
people, some of them homeless people who were dozing in their seats,
grateful for the panel's two hours--10 a.m. to noon--of security and
relative calm, except when Norman Podhoretz was shouting. Later, when
Norman Podhoretz had stopped shouting, he made a joke, and nobody in
the sleepy little audience laughed, and Norman Podhoretz raised his
voice again, and said, to no one in particular: "I made a joke. Isn't
that funny?"</LD>
<TE>   The conference, held some weeks ago at Boston University, was
organized by Partisan Review, still going after nearly 70 years, on
the anniversary of the magazine's original 1952 symposium, "Our
Country and Our Culture." Fifty years ago this month, a significant
debate over the relationship between American intellectuals and
American culture was raging in the pages of Partisan Review, the
legendary journal that the so-called New York Intellectuals had made
their stamping ground.</TE>
<TE>   Among the participants were William Barrett, Jacques Barzun,
Lionel Trilling, Norman Mailer, Reinhold Niebuhr, Leslie Fiedler,
David Riesman, C. Wright Mills, Sidney Hook, Irving Howe, Max Lerner,
Arthur Schlesinger Jr. and the two editors of PR, William Phillips
and Philip Rahv. Many of these distinguished minds had traveled from
Stalin to Trotsky to democratic socialism, and they had cut their
esthetic teeth on European high modernism. Now they stood poised on
the edge of American liberalism. They were ready to embrace the
capitalist system. They were prepared to submerge themselves in mass
culture but not before issuing their own doubts and misgivings,
sometimes with dramatic self-conscious gravitas.</TE>
<TE>   The conference's reach exceeded its grasp. Most of these stellar
figures belonged to a tiny coterie that inhabited a tiny grid of
tangled streets on the lower part of Manhattan. The "Our" in "Our
Country and Our Culture" referred less to the teeming multitudes
dwelling among the hills and valleys that rolled between sea and
shining sea than to the 50 or so New York City blocks bounded by
Katz's Deli in the south and the New York Public Library in the
north. Of the 24 discussants, only one was a woman, the poet Louise
Bogan. There were no black writers or thinkers. And the issues the
participants struggled so arduously with--e.g. should intellectuals
accept popular culture? should intellectuals at least try to embrace
mainstream social values?--might strike us today as perhaps trivial
and absurd.</TE>
<TE>   There was much brilliant and original writing, to be sure. But
inanity flowed inevitably from the idea that a caucus could be
assembled to dictate a collective transformation of attitudes. There
was a diversity of response: Mailer and Howe affirmed perpetual
adversarialism; Trilling defensively sniffed that intellectuals "can,
I believe, be taught to think. They can even be taught to write";
Hook rabbinically reminded everybody that in America intellectuals
are free to choose, whereas in the Soviet Union they are not free at
all. But no contributor could escape this absurdity: The general
proclamation of a new attitude toward American life recalled the
mechanical proclamations of the Soviet commissariats.</TE>
<TE>   And then there was the symposium's context. These former political
radicals had organized their public conversion at the height of
McCarthy's onslaught against political radicals. "Our Country and Our
Culture" was as much a placation as an avowal.</TE>
<TE>   The Boston University reprise replaced the "and" from the title of
the original symposium with a comma, which meant either that the
present organizers considered the country and the culture to be more
closely allied than ever before, or further apart. Such ambiguity,
incoherence even, presisted throughout the two-day event, which
consisted of three other panels besides the first one about
intellectuals. The most upbeat was "The Ascendancy of Science and
Technology," in which an inventor named Raymond Kurzweil
demonstrated, with chart after chart displaying lightning-like lines
soaring exuberantly upward, that advancing technologies were
propelling humanity, well, upward. Surprisingly, many of the
participants agreed that this presentation was the high point of the
conference, though what Kurzweil's final vision of the
future--something to do with a laptop computer surgically fitted
inside your head--had to do with the symposium's subject was as
obscure as its newly punctuated title. It was as if Marx's idea of
inevitable historical progress, which the first symposium had
forsworn, had now been reaffirmed in the guise of a fancy commodity.</TE>
<TE>   The subject--the state of the country, the state of the
culture--was taken up at great length in the three other panels: "The
Media and Our Country's Agenda"; "What Happened to the Arts"; and
"European/American Relations: Who Leads?" What was striking about the
participants was that, almost without exception, they were from the
far right of the ideological gamut. The original symposium embraced
nearly the entire political spectrum: from Norman Mailer to the
hard-line anti-communist Sidney Hook. At Boston University, one sat
and listened to Podhoretz; Hilton Kramer; Cynthia Ozick (in absentia;
her sour contribution was read with incongruous humanity and elegance
by Joanna Rose); and from the National Review, the very British David
Pryce-Jones. Hook's name was in fact admiringly dropped throughout
the two days. The collapse of communism seemed, peculiarly, to have
hardened the opposition to communism, and to ever shade of liberal
dissent.</TE>
<TE>   Kramer told a long story, the gist of which was that the New York
Times was a liberal paper when he worked there 40 years ago, was
still a liberal paper and will always be a liberal paper. Polite
applause. Ozick alternately condemned Americans for not reading
anymore and condemned terrorists for terrorizing Americans. The
octogenarian painter Jules Olitski stood up and mentioned the names
of certain contemporary artists, pausing after each name so that the
septuagenarian panelists could howl with laughter at the decline of
aesthetic standards. Pryce-Jones had this thought: that anti-American
Europe posed more of a threat to America than Iraq and that
totalitarianism was on the rise from Paris to Berlin. This had the
very visible effect of cheering the other participants by, one
assumed, pushing the murky new political situation back into a
familiar old framework.</TE>
<TE>   Whereas the original symposiasts had struggled with the question
of alienation from mainstream culture--and with the question of how
much adversarialism an artist or intellectual could bear--their
comfortable descendants luxuriated in the same questions. The anomie
that had once haunted the American intellectual, and destroyed some
writers and some artists, had now become an effective style of
self-presentation. The current panelists might have deplored the way
American popular culture had smoothly assimilated once-subversive
values, but they were beneficiaries of the same conversion. The
important thing was simply to keep shouting.</TE>

<HD>The Quest for Crusoe</HD>
<DH>IN SEARCH OF ROBINSON CRUSOE: By Tim Severin, Basic Books:
352 pp, $26</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOAN TAPPER</AU>
<BD>Joan Tapper is the former editor of Islands magazine.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Alone on a desert island. That's been a favorite subject of
fantasies, stories, vacation promotions and cartoons--not to mention
a Tom Hanks movie. And we owe it all to Daniel Defoe, whose "The Life
and Strange Surprizing Adventures of Robinson Crusoe" became an
instant bestseller when it was published in 1719.</LD>
<LD>   But to what or whom did Defoe owe it all? That's the question that
Tim Severin sets out to answer in his new book, "In Search of
Robinson Crusoe." An Ireland-based seafaring journalist and
filmmaker, Severin has made a career of re-creating ancient voyages
in period craft: sailing a leather boat across the Atlantic, a la St.
Brendan, and taking a dhow from Muscat to China in the wake of Sinbad
the Sailor, to name just two. Blending travel narrative, maritime
history and a literary mystery, he explores potential Crusoe isles,
pores over the exploits of 18th century pirates, deftly pieces
together clues in obscure book lists and has a few adventures of his
own.</LD>
<TE>   Conventional wisdom puts Crusoe's goatskin cap firmly on the head
of one Alexander Selkirk, a cantankerous Scottish sailing master who
was marooned on uninhabited Juan Fernandez Island, a well-known
stopping place for ships 400 miles off the west coast of South
America. Selkirk hardly expected to spend four years as a castaway,
but he did, making his home in a cave, subsisting on goats and wild
turnips and plugging his ears to the roars of the seals and sea lions
that crowded the beaches.</TE>
<TE>   The tale of Selkirk's rescue by privateers caused a public
sensation when he returned to London in 1711, and several accounts
were published, though none by Selkirk himself. Some 250 years later,
the island's association with the fictional castaway was "officially"
sealed when Chile renamed Selkirk's sanctuary, now the home of
lobster fishermen and the destination of occasional literary
tourists, Isla Robinson Crusoe. (Not everyone accepts this
designation: Residents of the Caribbean island of Tobago also claim
the honor, pointing to Defoe's siting his isle near the mouth of the
Orinoco River. And why did Severin's publishers use a cover photo of
Seychelles? Were they surreptitiously plumping for a spot in the
Indian Ocean?)</TE>
<TE>   Selkirk may have provided Defoe's inspiration, but as for the
actual prototype of a castaway and an accurate location for the
island, well, on those scores Severin is skeptical of the "genuine"
Selkirk sailor's chest and coconut drinking cup he saw in an
Edinburgh museum.</TE>
<TE>   A trip to Juan Fernandez Island allows Severin to weave together
his own experiences (including a night camped out uncomfortably close
to a colony of sea lions) with a comparison of the island to Defoe's
fictional one and with tales of pirate castaways who would betray
their comrades for a greater share of plunder. In fact, among the
surprises of "In Search of Robinson Crusoe" is the sheer number of
adventurers in the 1600s and 1700s who found themselves marooned and
who lived to tell their tale.</TE>
<TE>   There are several more ports of call on Severin's itinerary: In
the ramshackle villages of Nicaragua's mangrove-lined Mosquito Coast
(recently the haunt of drug smugglers and Contra operatives), he goes
looking for traditional sailors and turtle hunters who could easily
have stood in for Crusoe's Man Friday. Then, piecing together
histories Defoe might have known about (from a catalog of his private
library), Severin follows the trail to Panama, where the lifestyle of
today's Kuna Indians prompts more stories of double-dealing
buccaneers trudging through the rain forests of the isthmus and a
doomed 18th century utopian Scottish settlement.</TE>
<TE>   Finally Severin sets sail from Grenada aboard a 99-year-old
gaff-rigged fishing boat (no radio, no electric power), bound for
Salt Tortuga, a tiny desert island off the coast of Venezuela. It was
there in the late 1600s that one Henry Pitman, ship's surgeon and
escaped convict, was shipwrecked. Pitman eventually managed to
escape, return to London and chronicle his misadventures in an
obscure pamphlet. (More about that in a minute.) Severin's last
landfall, meanwhile, brings him to Grand Cayman and a visit with a
fisherman who still vividly remembers being marooned on a reef in a
hurricane in 1932. In that octogenarian we get a glimpse of the
relentless determination that must have kept all those historical
castaways alive.</TE>
<TE>   As for Pitman ... well, that's where Severin's penchant for
literary sleuthing emerges. Tracking down the surgeon's little
booklet, he discovers some intriguing parallels with Robinson
Crusoe's novelistic adventures and some tenuous--but
credible--connections to Defoe himself.</TE>
<TE>   But does it really matter where Defoe got his ideas for Crusoe?
From Selkirk or Pitman or one of the other unfortunate mariners of
that bygone era? I don't think so. Defoe turned the tales into art.
And Severin does the same with his own adventurous travels, proving
along the way the staying power behind the story of a castaway on a
desert isle. It's a fascinating read, and something to ponder the
next time you head for a beach.</TE>

<HD>She's a Lady (Whoa, Whoa, Whoa)</HD>
<DH>VERSAILLES: A Novel By Kathryn Davis, Houghton Mifflin: 206
pp., $21</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KATHARINE WEBER</AU>
<BD>Katharine Weber is the author of the novels "Objects in
Mirror Are Closer Than They Appear" and "The Music Lesson." She
teaches fiction writing at Yale.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Betrothed at 14 to the future king of France, the Viennese-born Marie
Antoinette looks forward with giddy excitement to her royal future
among the exotic French, who are said to "piss into chamber pots made
of lapis and dine on common garden slugs." As Kathryn Davis' elegant
little novel "Versailles" opens, young Antonia is traveling toward
her future. "My soul is going on a trip. I want to talk about her,"
she confides. Raised to believe that she is destined to be the queen
of France, she is curious to meet the 15-year-old Dauphin, "who also
has a soul, though more visible and worldly, its body already formed
(so I've been told) from layers of flesh and fat.</LD>
<LD>   "I was eager to please, though that meant something other than
acquiesce to another's desire," she reflects. "Pleasing meant my own
desire: the place where my body and soul met, like the musician's bow
bearing down on the string, teasing a sound out: ah ah ah ah ah!"</LD>
<TE>   And so begins this rich and strange meditation on the silly little
girl whose destiny was to be misunderstood by her people and by
history. The story is told in passages of first-person narrative,
dramatic dialogues, allegorical tales and descriptive, panoramic
tours of the gardens, halls and rooms at Versailles. Rather than
calling her novel after its subject, Davis chose "Versailles," and
that seems right, as this fractured yet ultimately persuasive and
sympathetic portrait of Antoinette seems to glide from room to room
as it hovers over the life of the most famous occupant of those halls
and chambers.</TE>
<TE>   Louis XVI ascended to the throne when he turned 20. He was by all
accounts a bizarre character, obsessed with locks and mechanical
devices and plagued by a problem with his foreskin called phimosis,
which necessitated circumcision at age 22 so he could produce heirs.
Davis is at her provocative best as she imagines his queen's
affectionate impatience:</TE>
<TE>   "Antoinette and Louis, as inept in bed as on the throne, though
goodness knows we tried. That mattress, those hands. The sound of his
breathing, the weight of his torso .... But did I feel stirred? Yes,
I admit, I did, a little. It was like the way I'd sometimes feel
while I was sitting for my portrait, an almost unendurable sense of
my self, of the surfaces of Antoinette, her eyes trying not to blink,
her lips growing more and more pursed and dry, her tongue dying to
lick them. And then just when I'd think I couldn't bear to sit there
like that one minute longer, I'd suddenly find myself on the outside
looking in, a traveler in a carriage passing an apparently deserted
house at nightfall. The windows dark, no hint of movement, yet
somewhere deep inside, in the deepest darkest corner of the cellar,
there would be a little sleeping animal who would prick up its ears."</TE>
<TE>   Davis, the author of several distinctive novels, among them "The
Girl Who Trod on a Loaf" and "The Walking Tour," has created for
Antoinette an extraordinary sensibility which carries the story.
Worldly yet naive, she has an uncanny ability to bear witness to her
own experience, from the early pleasures of court life to the final
elegiac inventory of Versailles:</TE>
<TE>   "Two hundred twenty steps. A million miles. From the Salon of
Peace to the Salon of War, from the root to the crown, from the rock
to the spring. From Versailles to Paris, from heaven to earth.</TE>
<TE>   "Seventeen arcades, each with eighteen mirrors. Three hundred six
mirrors, and in every one of them no Antoinette."</TE>

<AU>LAWRENCE WESCHLER</AU>
<BD>Lawrence Weschler is the author of "Mr. Wilson's
Cabinet of Wonder" and the forthcoming "Robert Irwin/Getty Garden."
His essay is adapted from the introduction to "Photobooth," to be
published by Princeton Architectural Press in October.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Is it just me or did you, too, have the sense back then, climbing
into the photo booth, that you were clambering aboard H.G. Wells'
time machine? In fact, I used to think that's where Wells had gotten
the idea for his contraption in the first place. Shows you what I
knew about history and chronology in those days.</LD>
<LD>   I'd been passing a pleasant hour amid the stacks at Arcana Books,
that marvelous little art-book emporium along the Third Street
Promenade in Santa Monica and, as I was getting set to cash out, I'd
gotten into a rambling conversation with a mildly daft clerk there by
the name of Babbette Hines. Turns out she was quite obsessed with the
things--both the booths and the strips--and had been haunting flea
markets and yard sales for years, scrounging  about in the bottoms of
boxes and filing cabinets, scaring up hundreds and hundreds of
anonymous snaps and carefully, reverentially reclaiming and
preserving them. Here, she said, look--did I have a minute? She'd
organized her stash into a sort of album; did I want to see? She
pulled the bulging volume from a shelf under the cash register and
invited me to dally a little longer.</LD>
<TE>   And it turns out I did know something about time: For here those
visages came hurtling back into the present, right this instant,
traces from another era, fresh and cocky, spry and shy, goofy and
glum, tender and tendentious, clueless and self-conscious as the day
they were first prized.</TE>
<TE>   Time machines, indeed. For as I turned the pages, it was as if the
strips were revving up and sending me hurtling back there, back to
that prior age: a sequence of little wormholes, coiled there,
unsuspecting, unsuspected, on the page.</TE>
<TE>   In a luminous little essay on "The Face," Jean-Paul Sartre once
evoked a marble bust in his exploration of the human face, in an
effort to heighten the contrast between the two. A marble bust, he
suggested, exists in "universal time," which is to say, the time "of
instants set end to end, of the metronome, of the hourglass, of fixed
immobility." Such a bust floats in "a perpetual present." But the
face "creates its own time within universal time .... Against [that]
stagnant background, the time of living bodies stands out because it
is oriented .... In the midst of these stalactites hanging in the
present, the face, alert and inquisitive, is always ahead of the look
I direct toward it .... A bit of the future has now entered the room:
a mist of futurity surrounds the face: its future." The face, Sartre
goes on to insist, "is not merely the upper part of the body .... It
is corporeal yet different from belly or thigh: what it has in
addition is its voracity; it is pierced with greedy holes."</TE>
<TE>   The greediest, the most ravenous of those holes, of course, being
the eyes. For "now the two spheres are turning in their orbits: now
the eyes are becoming a look," and in so doing changing the very
nature of the thing they are looking at--say, that chair over
there--a change which is in turn reciprocal. "If I watch his eyes, I
see that they are not fastened in his head, serene like agate
marbles. They are being created at each moment by what they look at."</TE>
<TE>   But look at what was going on here. For, yes, these sitters in
their long-ago photo booth, frozen though they had become, weren't
anything like marble busts; rather, in orienting themselves toward a
future, composing themselves (in fact, they were gauging their own
reflections in the pane of glass that intervened between themselves
and the camera), beholding themselves, they were looking at how they
would be seen. (And now do get seen!) They'd tried on this pose and
then that (funny the way that by the third or fourth pose, as if on
second thought, they'd often reverted to the first)--addressing first
themselves (there in the mirrored glass), and beyond that the
intended other (girlfriend, boyfriend, parent, sibling, pen pal,
bureaucrat), but beyond that, well, something like the
undifferentiated future--faceless posterity--us!</TE>
<TE>   Sartre goes on to conclude how "[I]f we call transcendence the
ability of the mind to pass beyond itself and all other things as
well, to escape from itself that it may lose itself elsewhere; then
to be a visible transcendence is the meaning of a face."</TE>
<TE>   In the months since, Babbette Hines found a publisher--the book
will be out in October from Princeton Architectural Press--and, the
other day, I received an advance galley. The experience of browsing
through the coming volume proved no less absorbing.</TE>
<TE>   For one found oneself holding a veritable album of such Sartrean
transcendings. Nameless, typified (the Flirt, the Dowager, the Hood,
the Accountant, the Kid, the Sailor and his Buddy, the Patriot, the
Lovers, Pals, the Tough, Pattycakes, the Virgin, the Cadet, Grandpa)
and yet each one tinctured with individuality (that hat, that
drooping cigarette, that brooch, those brows, that smirk, that muff,
that grin, that grief)--like no one so much as one's very own self,
here on the page: a nameless, typical, typified individual
momentarily struck dumb, pillow of air lodged in his mouth,
marveling, particulate, as the transcendent came hurtling forth and
struck home.</TE>

<HD>Hitting Their Groove</HD>
<DH>A team of British DJs and producers scores the club anthem
of the year in a spirited, experimental track</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE BALTIN</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Layo &amp; Bushwacka's quick two days of press in L.A. to promote their
upcoming album, "Night Works," have suddenly turned into a
high-volume whirlwind of activity. The British DJs and producers
Matthew "Bushwacka" Benjamin and Layo Paskin find themselves DJing
the exclusive Sunday-afternoon pool party at the downtown Standard
hotel, and then the Monday Night Social at the Las Palmas restaurant.</LD>
<LD>   In between, they appear on Jason Bentley's "Metropolis" show on
KCRW-FM (89.9), and receive guest-of-honor treatment at an L.A.
dance-scene power dinner with Bentley and other movers and shakers.
Sandwiched in between is a series of interviews and photo shoots,
including one on Venice Beach where they are buried in gravel up to
their necks.</LD>
<LD>   So much for a quick in and out of town. But the demands on their
time don't come as a surprise. After a decade as part of the U.K.
dance world, both on records and behind the scenes at the End, the
influential London nightspot where Fatboy Slim and Roni Size got
early breaks, Layo &amp; Bushwacka have scored the club anthem of the
year in "Love Story."</LD>
<TE>   In the wake of fellow dance-music group Dirty Vegas' recent debut
in the Top 10 of the U.S. album chart, and with DJ Paul Oakenfold
hitting KROQ with "Ready, Set, Go," the time may finally be right for
a true dance record--one that captures the spirit of community and
experimentation that marks the scene--to break through into the
mainstream.</TE>
<TE>   "Love Story" could very well be that record.</TE>
<TE>   "Every so often, a song comes along that no matter where you go,
in Europe, the States, wherever, that is just the song," Bentley
says. "This year, it's 'Love Story.' "</TE>
<TE>   L.A. clubgoers have been dancing to the track's sweet, jazzy riffs
and progressive keyboards for more than a year now--DJs Oakenfold, BT
and Sasha have all made "Love Story" part of their sets during recent
local appearances.</TE>
<TE>   "It's just a good groove," Layo says. "Anyone can play it, so
whether you're a techno DJ, a house DJ, a progressive DJ, a trance
DJ, a down-tempo DJ, everyone seems to latch on to it and people like
it. And that you don't know. You just make music and it happens
organically."</TE>
<TE>   Layo and Bushwacka both hail from London, but beyond that they
appear to have little in common.</TE>
<TE>   Layo is a genial sort who smiles a lot and looks like a taller,
leaner version of Rowan Atkinson, the comic actor who portrays Mr.
Bean.</TE>
<TE>   The shorter, stockier Bushwacka sits in the patio of a Thai
restaurant in Venice with his arms crossed for much of the interview,
exhibiting rock 'n' roll attitude on occasion in the form of sullen
looks and short answers.</TE>
<TE>   Their bond is their deep love for music and great respect for the
process of creating it. They have found a common language that runs
through their new album, "Night Works," which comes out Sept. 10 on
the XL/Beggars Group label.</TE>
<TE>   "We both like minor chords," Layo says. "Whereas we both like
uplifting moments, we like to get there, often, in minor chord
fashion. And dynamics are important to both of us. We like things
that are dynamic, energetic, that have a real life within the track."</TE>
<TE>   Those minor-chord progressions often result in the style of
electronic music known as down-tempo, a less beat-dependent, more
sophisticated form that stems from jazz. It's a prominent part of
"Night Works," which includes "Love Story."</TE>
<TE>   Bushwacka, who plays keyboards, took up piano at age 3 and has
been heavily influenced by jazz as well as the seminal dance
collective Massive Attack. Layo, who handles most of the samples,
especially the blues-based ones, comes from a hippie background and
counts the Beatles as heroes.</TE>
<TE>   Accordingly, "Night Works" follows an eclectic musical trajectory
that moves seamlessly up and down, incorporating jazz, techno,
progressive and acid house.</TE>
<TE>   Although "Love Story" has become what DJs call a "turning point
record"--one that you count on to lift the mood of the crowd if
things are not going well, or to take it even higher when the dancers
are into the set--the rest of the music doesn't always follow that
lead. Bushwacka wonders how fans will respond to the album beyond the
single.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not even sure that many people at home are going to get it,"
he says. "'Cause it's underground. Apart from 'Love Story,' it's not
commercial at all, and it's quite deep and very instrumental."</TE>
<TE>   In spite of his concerns, the record has received great advance
reviews at home, and "Love Story" was named single of the week in
virtually every major U.K. music publication that names one,
dance-oriented or not.</TE>
<TE>   That doesn't impress Bushwacka. "I'm not going to believe any
amount of magazines until the public has had it long enough to give
their opinion."</TE>
<TE>   But the public is giving its opinion every time the record is cued
up. As working DJs who travel frequently, the two have watched that
phenomenon time and again.</TE>
<TE>   "There have been many places throughout the world where either one
of us played it and they've gone bananas. It's a great feeling,"
Bushwacka says. "I was in Ibiza last weekend, drunk, sitting at the
bar on the beach, everyone was dancing and the second to last record
was 'Love Story.' Everyone just went crazy. My mates came over to me,
and I was just sitting there thinking, 'This is the life.' "</TE>

<HD>Solomon Burke on Record</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Robert Hilburn</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A selected guide to Solomon Burke's albums:</LD>
<LD>   "If You Need Me/Rock 'n Soul" (Collectables). This 23-song album
brings together Burke's first two Atlantic albums. They are both
seminal moments in contemporary pop, with young Burke singing his
heart out, backed by a small army of musicians (often a four-piece
horn section, three or more guitarists, organ, piano, bass and backup
singers). Ray Charles had done much in the '50s to combine gospel,
country and blues, but Burke is even more trailblazing in these
early-'60s tracks, which serve as a door between the graceful,
church-inspired singing of Sam Cooke and the rawer energy that would
influence such great rock singers as John Fogerty.</LD>
<LD>   "Home in Your Heart" (Rhino/Atlantic). This is generally
considered the definitive Burke package, a two-disc, 41-song bonanza
from the Atlantic years, complete with a booklet that gives detailed
information about session dates and personnel. The box includes all
but nine of the songs from "If You Need Me" and "Rock 'n Soul," plus
the best of Burke's later recordings. The latter include remakes of
some R&amp;B hits (including Brook Benton's "It's Just a Matter of Time"
and Charles' "What'd I Say") as well as some country excursions.</LD>
<TE>   "Homeland" (Bizarre/Planet). There's more to this 1991 recording
than Burke's version of "Try a Little Tenderness," but that alone is
reason enough for Burke fans to search out this CD. The easy thing
would have been to just retrace Otis Redding's version of the old pop
standard, but Burke reshapes the song into his own, wonderfully
personal statement.</TE>
<TE>   "King of Blues 'n' Soul" (Fuel 2000). In this package, originally
released by Black Top Records in 1993, he steps into a blues mode,
putting his stamp on songs such as Roy Brown's "Good Rockin'
Tonight," a tune Elvis Presley recorded on Sun Records, and Guitar
Slim's "Sufferin' Mind." It also has some tracks from a live 1994
Burke album on Black Top.</TE>
<TE>   "Don't Give Up on Me" (Fat Possum). Working with producer Joe
Henry, Burke sets aside the big band in favor of a small combo on
intimate versions of tunes written for him or contributed to the
album by Bob Dylan, Elvis Costello, Tom Waits and other top-line
artists. It's a daring step that reveals a new, winning side of
Burke's interpretive gifts.</TE>

<LD>George Clooney is in the midst of what he calls "a massive
depression." No, his latest movie hasn't flopped; "Entertainment
Tonight" is not planning an expose. It's just that he's editing
"Confessions of a Dangerous Mind," about the strange life and times
of "Gong Show" host Chuck Barris. It's his first film as a director,
and he has already had to cut one of his favorite scenes. Now he's
not sure if the story will hold together.</LD>
<LD>   "The storytelling that works in dailies you now have to look at
from a different point of view with a different eye," he says, then
adds: "I may blow the whole thing, but sometimes you just want to
say, 'OK, let me take one swing at this. If I was going to make it,
this is what it would be.' "</LD>
<LD>   That impulse, with all its inherent frustrations and
possibilities, is not unique to Clooney who's one of an illustrious
group of actors who have moved behind the camera. Among those who
have made or are about to make their first features: Nicolas Cage,
Don Cheadle, Denzel Washington, Jennifer Jason Leigh, Bill Paxton,
Ethan Hawke, Salma Hayek, Matt Dillon, Fisher Stevens, and John
Malkovich.</LD>
<TE>   For some, it is by design, the culmination of a long campaign; for
others, like Clooney, it is almost an accident, a case of using his
power to get a difficult project made. At a certain point, directing
is a logical progression for actors who want the opportunity to tell
a story their way. They look at the quality of films being made today
and think they can do better.</TE>
<TE>   "I think acting is a good background for a director," says Martha
Coolidge, the new president of the Directors Guild of America. "I
think more directors could use more actor training, but does that
mean you will automatically become a good director? No."</TE>
<TE>   It takes a particular kind of individual who wants to have a hand
in everything that's going on-not just the acting but the editing,
the camera work, the sound mix, and the color of the pillows.</TE>
<TE>   "The nice thing about it for me is that it works all sides of your
personality--the intellectual side and the emotional side," says
actress Jodie Foster, who has directed two films ("Little Man Tate"
and "Home for the Holidays"). "It's the final and complete voice of
the movie. In some ways, it's the difference between being a dancer
and a choreographer."</TE>
<TE>   From the time cowboy William S. Hart jumped from his horse to the
director's chair in silent westerns, actors have made the transition.
Charlie Chaplin and Buster Keaton did it. So did Orson Welles. But in
the studio years, it was mostly bit players, not stars, who became
directors.</TE>
<TE>   "If a studio had a star like Gable or Cagney or Bogart, the last
thing they wanted was for them to direct because they wanted to see
those performers on the screen," says Clint Eastwood, who has become
a role model for actors who aspire to direct. "Now if a character
actor like Elia Kazan wanted to direct, I guess they'd say, 'Oh, what
the heck.' "</TE>
<TE>   Eastwood talked MCA chief Lew Wasserman into letting him direct
his first film, "Play Misty for Me," in 1971. "I went to Wasserman
and said, 'You have this property I'd love to direct.' I thought
there would be this big pause, but he said, 'No, that's fine.' When I
left the office, he called my agent and said, 'Oh, by the way, we
don't want to pay him.' So I worked for scale and was happy to get
the opportunity."</TE>
<TE>   At the time, few actors were getting the chance to direct. "In the
early part of the game, I don't think anybody wanted me to direct,"
Eastwood says. "If I told them I was going to give up performing and
only direct, they might have said, 'Well, we can get John Huston,
what do we need him for?' "</TE>
<TE>   Over the years ambitious actors would occasionally take a turn as
director. Burt Lancaster, Paul Newman, Warren Beatty and even John
Wayne did it. Robert Redford won an Oscar for "Ordinary People" in
1980. But in the last decade it's become more commonplace.</TE>
<TE>   Mel Gibson (1995's "Braveheart"), Kevin Costner (1990's "Dances
With Wolves") and Eastwood (1992's "Unforgiven") have each won
Academy Awards for best director. "In the last 15 years, actors have
had more clout then they've ever had," Foster says. "So that put them
in a place where they became more involved in the business of making
movies, and then that made them want to direct."</TE>
<TE>   Studios who wanted to be in business with certain actors were now
offering them the chance to direct their own pictures. Producing
alone wasn't enough. "If Danny De Vito or Robert De Niro or Jodie
Foster calls up [Universal Pictures Chairman] Stacey Snider or
[Columbia Pictures President] Amy Pascal and says they want to come
in about directing a piece, you think they're not going to jump at
it?" says longtime Creative Artists Agency agent Fred Specktor.
"Let's not kid anybody, movie stars have an ability to be able to do
certain things that average human beings can't do."</TE>
<TE>   But it's not only top-line stars making big-budget films who are
using their leverage to direct personal projects. Jennifer Jason
Leigh and Alan Cumming were able to raise $3 million to make "The
Anniversary Party" last year because they could deliver a cast of
friends including Kevin Kline and Gwyneth Paltrow.</TE>
<TE>   "Jennifer and I never would have gotten to direct a film so easily
if we had not been famous," Cumming admits. "If we had been
first-time directors nobody had ever heard of, we wouldn't have
gotten the chance. We were definitely privileged."</TE>
<TE>   But there's a downside for actors, as well. In some quarters,
there is a lingering stigma that surrounds actors directing, as if
they were precocious children being indulged. When a story in the
trades announces another screenwriter making a debut as a director,
few eyebrows are raised. When actors get the job, the news is often
received with a knowing wink.</TE>
<TE>   "Some people think actors directing is the same thing as models
who want to act," says Todd Field, who made a well reviewed directing
debut with "In the Bedroom." "Sometimes people in the business wonder
how someone who gets so petted and fed can run the show?"</TE>
<TE>   The reality is actors know their way around a set better than
most, certainly better than screenwriters who spend much of their day
locked in a room.</TE>
<TE>   Field, who started out as a theater actor in New York and made
"hundreds and hundreds" of short films, had the good fortune to act
in "Eyes Wide Shut" (1999) and learn from Stanley Kubrick. On the
set, "Kubrick was so proficient, there wasn't a lot of fuss made
about the technical aspect of how things were going to be executed,"
recalls Field. "He worked in a very common sense way, without the
dogma that surrounds filmmaking most of the time. So it was
continually inspiring."</TE>
<TE>   Directing requires a commitment not all actors can or care to
make. "Some actors are happy to go to their trailers, read the racing
form, smoke cigarettes and have someone bring them cappuccinos,"
Field says.</TE>
<TE>   Other actors want to be in the center of the action. For
performers such as Cheadle, who is preparing to make his debut with
Elmore Leonard's "Tishomingo Blues," being on the set has been like
understudying for the director's role. "Whenever I'm on a set, I'm
sticking my nose in, probably more to some people's delight than
others. I'm always bugging them: 'Why wouldn't you do it this way?'
I've always been like that."</TE>
<TE>   Cheadle has directed theater in Minneapolis and L.A. and made a
few shorts, but when his turn to direct came, it took him by
surprise. The producers adapting Leonard's novel had the idea that
first-time directors often had the freshest take on material, and
perhaps they thought they could attract an actor by letting him
direct. When they called him in, Cheadle assumed it was just like one
of many meetings he goes to as an actor in which they want to "sniff"
him without having any intention of offering him a job. But having
witnessed too many directors who don't know what they want to say and
then end up with a fractured film, Cheadle did his homework. "I went
in with a clear take on the book, which is why they said, 'Oh, OK,
he's not just coming in here saying it'll be cool to shoot this.' "</TE>
<TE>   Even for someone with an actor's cachet, there is no clear path to
becoming a director. Jennifer Jason Leigh never wanted to direct.
Acting had always been "the be all and end all" for her. Then she
acted in a Dogma 95 film ("The King is Alive") in North Africa in
2000, and realized how inexpensively and quickly you could shoot a
movie on digital video.</TE>
<TE>   While she was mulling it over, she ran into her friend Joel Coen,
who had directed her in "The Hudsucker Proxy." "He said it's not
brain surgery, and it's not, you know, it's really a pleasure."
Directing turned out to be a merciful relief for a cerebral performer
like Leigh. "Just practically speaking, you can't be a diva," she
says. "It cuts through a lot of your insecurities because there's
something bigger to deal with. You're dealing with other people's
egos, not your own, and that's kind of sweet. It's a lovely way to
get away from yourself."</TE>
<TE>   In some cases, fame has to intervene before an actor can get a
chance to direct. Danny DeVito came to Los Angeles to be a director
in 1975 after appearing in the off-Broadway production of "One Flew
Over the Cuckoo's Nest." He made a short film called "Minestrone"
with a grant from the American Film Institute, but it wasn't until
"Taxi" had established him as an actor that he got an opportunity to
direct his first feature, "Throw Momma From the Train," in 1987.</TE>
<TE>   "That's the way it happened, I don't know if that's the only way
to do it," DeVito says. "I was trying to get work as an actor while I
was trying to get something going as a director, but in my heart I
always wanted to direct."</TE>
<TE>   Clooney didn't have a burning desire--or really any desire--to
direct; what he did have was an interest in getting a film made that
meant something to him. "Confessions of a Dangerous Mind," the story
of the iconoclastic Barris, who may or may not have been a hit man
for the CIA, was a project Clooney had been attached to as an actor.
He watched it fall apart in pre-production three times, the last time
five weeks before shooting.</TE>
<TE>   "It started looking like it was never going to get made, and there
are so few good scripts out there," Clooney says. "I've got more
money then I'll ever spend. I'd rather get 'Confessions' made than do
[a film like] 'Swordfish.' "</TE>
<TE>   So Clooney agreed to take a pay cut and play a supporting role as
a CIA agent, and brought in his friends Julia Roberts and Drew
Barrymore at a bargain price That convinced Miramax head Harvey
Weinstein to put up "well under $30 million," according to Clooney,
for the film, provided that Clooney's business partner, Steven
Soderbergh, would come on as executive producer and, in the event of
disaster, take over as director. Weinstein and Clooney will get their
final cuts, and Soderbergh will be the arbiter. The film is scheduled
to be released on Christmas Day.</TE>
<TE>   Clooney understands why actors increasingly feel compelled to
direct in order to protect their work. Performers as good as Denzel
Washington, he says, are winding up in movies as bad as "John Q." 'If
you're Denzel, I would bet he's feeling, 'I want to be involved in
stuff that I have more say on, so whether it's good or not, I'll take
the responsibility for it.' "</TE>
<TE>   Washington has in fact directed "The Antwone Fisher Story," an
autobiographical drama written by a former security guard at Sony
Pictures about a young black man in the Navy who, with the help of a
psychiatrist, traces the roots of his violent temper. Washington
plays the therapist.</TE>
<TE>   "What you don't want to do is some lighter fare," Clooney says.
"You want to do something that you think has more weight to it and is
a story you'd enjoy telling. You don't want to just say, 'OK, I'm
going to direct for the hell of it.' "</TE>
<TE>   Cage pretty much felt the same way. He was biding his time late
last year, waiting for the slowdown that resulted from the threatened
actors' and writers' strike to lift, when he thought, "Well, maybe I
ought to try directing." "Sonny," the story of a gigolo raised to
follow the family tradition in New Orleans, was a pet project he had
wanted to star in 15 years ago. The film had a few false starts, so
Cage figured this would be a chance to get it done. He pulled
together a crew restless to get back to work and nailed down
financing in just three weeks, agreeing to play a cameo role in order
to raise the film's $5.1-million budget.</TE>
<TE>   It all happened so fast that Cage was putting up his own money for
pre-production. The story is dark, but Cage was intent on doing
something different from the big-budget pictures he often appears in
as an actor. "I guess I was looking for a deeper artistic
satisfaction," he says. "As a director I want to stay with
challenging and confrontational subject matter that's more me than
even the acting. This is the most naked I've ever been and I guess
there's something thrilling about that."</TE>
<TE>   Cage knew he could talk to actors, but he admits the first day on
the set was e scary. The most intimidating thing for him was where to
put the camera. Four days of rehearsals trying out different lenses
with the cinematographer took care of that. Ironically, for someone
who has acted in a number of large-scale pictures, he found he worked
better with two or three people; more than that was a bit
overwhelming.</TE>
<TE>   "You just have to breathe and keep cool and not show your
frustration because that sends back signals to the whole team and
everyone starts to lose heart."</TE>
<TE>   Then there was the necessary shift in perspective. Like most
actors, Cage was used to focusing on his own part. "As the director,
you have to understand the mentality of all the characters," he says.
"With the women, I had to think about what they were feeling and try
to tap into that side of myself. It was a challenge."</TE>
<TE>   Because actor-directors will usually have a better understanding
of the craft, there is always the danger they may be too focused on
the performances. "Actors who direct have a tendency to indulge
actors," acknowledges Stanley Tucci, who co-directed "Big Night"
(1996) and directed "Joe Gould's Secret" (2000). "They'll just fall
in love with the acting, and fall in love with the dialogue, and fall
in love with the moment, and lose sight of the whole film. These are
the things you have to be careful about."</TE>
<TE>   After doing some 20 films and a lot of TV, Tucci started to feel
his performances were getting short-shrift from directors. He noticed
that film schools grads knew almost nothing about how to work with
actors. "First-time directors had no clue, I was astounded," Tucci
says. "They had no interest in learning how to talk to actors or how
to move them in a space."</TE>
<TE>   Actors complain that their performance often isn't something
directors want to have a lot of discussion about. "When you work with
directors who are not actors, they try to get a result as opposed to
giving you a set of conditions to get you there," Cheadle says. "They
say stuff like, 'You should be more angry in this scene.' Well,
that's not direction."</TE>
<TE>   From his own experience, Clooney knew he had to redirect his
focus. When he's playing a part, Clooney understands the director is
trying to manipulate him to get what he wants, and he in turn
manipulates the director to get what he wants. There's a give and
take. But, as a director, Clooney was uncomfortable doing this dance.</TE>
<TE>   "It's different when you're the director, because you have to
negotiate with each and every actor," he says. "If I need someone to
deliver a pizza in a scene, I don't need him to tell me he's doing it
because his parents were alcoholics and he has a drug problem. I just
need him to deliver the pizza. So you find that you're actually
asking actors to do much less than they're capable of because that's
what you need for the scene."</TE>
<TE>   Still, a director who has been an actor is likely to be more
indulgent. "Actors can be weird," admits Cheadle. "If I got to crawl
under a table and get under a blanket to get ready to do a scene,
certain directors who understand will say, 'Yeah, he needs to go
under the table and he'll come out and we'll get a great scene.' "</TE>
<TE>   Actors often get bored after 10 weeks on a set and are ready to
move on to the next high-paying job; directors don't have that
luxury. So having made it through filming in a brisk six weeks, Cage
now finds himself in a position actors are not used to--the prolonged
and painstaking process of post-production. He had some experience in
the editing room as an executive producer on "Shadow of the Vampire"
(2000), but he admits he didn't know what he was getting into.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it was Fellini who said you're ready to make the movie
when you're sick of it," Cage says. "It's like giving birth; you want
it out of your body, you hate it, and then you love it again."</TE>
<TE>   Although he speaks enthusiastically about his directing
experience, Clooney is too absorbed in the editing to know if he will
try it again. "I don't know if I'm any good at it," he says. "But I
do know if you're an actor who can get movies made, and there are a
few of us, you have to focus on trying to make better and better
films, and that's what I'm trying to do. I may fail but at least the
successes and failures will be my own."</TE>

<LD>By the end of September, people driving through Westwood will be
greeted by banners bearing the image of a mysterious gentleman
peering from behind a curtain, beckoning passersby to the Geffen
Playhouse. The man is Joseph Cotten, and no, he's not being brought
back from the dead for a stage adaptation of "The Third Man."</LD>
<LD>   A photo of Cotten, gleaned from a 1940s movie magazine, offered
Manhattan illustrator Paul Davis the perfect pose to inhabit the
frame of his sophisticated teaser promoting the Geffen's new season.

<LD>   Davis, known for his New York Shakespeare Festival posters, has
crafted an acrylic portrait for each play at the Geffen next season.
His graphic interpretations of David Eldridge's "Under the Blue Sky,"
Debbie Allen's "Pearl," Rebecca Gilman's "Boy Gets Girl," Richard
Nelson's "Franny's Way" and Neil Simon's "Rose &amp; Walsh" have found
their way into brochures, posters and newspaper ads.</LD>
<TE>   Ads for the Pasadena Playhouse's current season also benefit from
a unified "look," courtesy of Iconisus designers Stephan Lapp and
Erma Yucel. They were hired last summer to devise the promotional
campaign for "Biloxi Blues," "The Blue Room," "A Class Act," "The
Waverly Gallery," "Blue," "The Syringa Tree" and "Plaid Tidings."</TE>
<TE>   These designs are part of a new effort to create an overall
identity for the theaters and to capture the attention of potential
theatergoers.</TE>
<TE>   Yucel, a Turkish emigre who moved to Los Angeles four years ago,
and Lapp, who studied at Art Center College of Design in Pasadena and
spent five years in Disney's movie marketing division, had previously
specialized in ad campaigns for TV specials and films including "Spy
Kids" and "Time Machine."</TE>
<TE>   Their work on behalf of HBO's "Robin Williams: Live on Broadway"
special was recently splashed across the side of a nine-story
building at Sunset Boulevard and Doheny Drive in West Hollywood.</TE>
<TE>   Shifting from a movie marketing mind-set to a theater campaign
meant taking a more subtle approach--and not simply because the
budget was smaller.</TE>
<TE>   "With the Pasadena Playhouse, it was interesting," Lapp says,
"because they aren't usually dealing in stars." Except for Phylicia
Rashad in "Blue," the plays had yet to be cast when Iconisus began
its work. "So part of our challenge was to put a human element into
something without actually showing anyone's face," Lapp says. For
example, "The Waverly Gallery's" art, assembled from stock
photography sources on a computer, reveals only fragments of a
woman's face broken into rough shards arrayed within a picture frame.</TE>
<TE>   "We couldn't show an actual person because it may be someone who
doesn't appear in the play," Lapp says. "But we wanted to have the
eyes, because that's something that draws in the viewer."</TE>
<TE>   By contrast, Lapp says, creating movie posters is frequently a
matter of making the stars' faces as big as possible. Lapp remembers
generating more than 400 "comps" for the film "What Women Want" at
Seininger Advertising, where Lapp and Yucel both worked before
starting Iconisus two years ago in Beverly Hills. The studio went
with a poster emblazoned with the faces of Mel Gibson and Helen Hunt.</TE>
<TE>   In a star-driven marketplace, every last blemish commands
attention. "You'll get handwritten notes from actors saying, 'Take
this wrinkle out, it makes me look older, but leave that one in,
because it makes me look cute,' " Yucel says.</TE>
<TE>   Last spring, Iconisus started looking for clients who would allow
the designers to stretch their creative muscles. At the same time,
Pasadena Playhouse was contemplating an image make-over.</TE>
<TE>   "It was my desire to get a consistency of design from show to
show, so even before you took a careful look at the information on
the poster or postcard or whatever, you would know, 'Oh, that must be
a Pasadena Playhouse production,' " says Sheldon Epps, the theater's
artistic director.</TE>
<TE>   Epps and his colleagues also aimed to communicate the range of
work at the theater. "I really wanted to convey the idea that we have
tremendous theatrical diversity," he says. "We're sort of saying,
'The building you come into is always going to be the same. But when
the curtain goes up and the light goes down, everything that you see
on the stage is going to be quite different from one show to the
next.' I hope the design becomes like opening the back door of the
theater and peeking in." Beyond the specific productions, Epps and
company wanted to knit together a unified design for the season. "The
work that Iconisus has done has an elegance about it that I certainly
hope people would associate with the theater," Epps says.</TE>
<TE>   "A word that we were using a lot when Iconisus came along and
started talking about working with us was branding--branding the
Pasadena Playhouse. We were definitely conscious of creating a visual
brand that you would recognize immediately and hopefully identify as
connected to the theater."</TE>
<TE>   "Branding" had yet to become a buzzword in 1975 when Davis created
his first poster for the New York Shakespeare Festival. The play was
"Hamlet," the star was Sam Waterston and the producer was Joseph
Papp. During the next 16 years, Davis produced 51 posters for the
prestigious New York nonprofit theater, some of which were reprinted
in "Paul Davis Posters and Paintings" (E.P. Dutton, 1977).</TE>
<TE>   Drawing on his background as an illustrator of book jackets and
magazine articles, Davis introduced a soft-sell alternative to a
field previously dominated by a literal-minded style that spelled out
the credits but left little to the imagination. In Davis' hands, "ego
copy" listing directors, actors--even the name of the theater--was
banished, the better to focus the viewer's attention on a single
compelling image.</TE>
<TE>   Designer Paula Scher followed Davis at the Joseph Papp Public
Theater/New York Shakespeare Festival after Papp died in 1991. Her
typographically driven posters for contemporary plays such as "The
Diva Is Dismissed," now in the permanent collection of the
Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum in New York, featured aggressive
fonts within surrealistic photographs. Scher's hard-edged designs
served as an announcement that a new artistic regime under George C.
Wolfe had begun.</TE>
<TE>   In 1986, illustrator James McMullan began an equally fruitful
association--41 productions and counting--with the Lincoln Center
Theater. The contemplative characters populating his gouache
paintings for "Six Degrees of Separation," "Arcadia" and "The House
of Blue Leaves" are emblematic of the dark, dramatic tone associated
with much of the work produced at the Manhattan nonprofit theater.</TE>
<TE>   About the time Scher and McMullan were developing a visual
identity for New York clients, David Silverman was doing much the
same in L.A. for the Actors' Gang, albeit on a scruffier scale.</TE>
<TE>   Silverman had met Tim Robbins when they were classmates at UCLA.
In 1982, when Robbins and his Actors' Gang theater company needed to
promote their inaugural production, "Ubu the King," they turned to
Silverman, who used pen and ink for a stark black-and-white poster.
For 13 years, even while producing "The Simpsons," Silverman turned
out dozens of rough-edged street posters that translated the
company's anarchic spirit into punk-inspired imagery.</TE>
<TE>   "I was sort of getting in touch with my inner Ralph Steadman,"
says Silverman, referring to the illustrator famous for the
lacerating drawings that accompanied Hunter S. Thompson's Rolling
Stone articles in the '70s. "There was an aggressive nature to the
play, an aggressive nature to performances, therefore I guess there
was an aggressive nature to the way I did the drawings."</TE>
<TE>   Two years ago, Lisa Wagner, a New York freelance art director for
Entertainment Weekly, GQ and other magazines, moved west to join her
fiance in L.A. Hired by the Geffen in 2001, she urged the playhouse
to borrow a page from Manhattan's artist-theater tradition. "If you
look at New York, there were some historical moves artistically with
the theater community out there, which I thought would be interesting
to kind of bring out here.</TE>
<TE>   "Instead of using photography, which for me has been pretty much
the dregs because you're dealing with poorly lit images from theaters
or 8-by-10 promo shots of actors, we started thinking about another
kind of visual language. 'Give [the project] to somebody who can turn
it into a piece of art'--that's where we were all trying to go with
it. We started thinking in that direction at the Geffen last year,
for continuity, for vision, for a narrative structure."</TE>
<TE>   For the Geffen season winding down, Wagner worked with local
artist Justin Wood. For the new slate, Wagner says, "we decided to
get a little more traditional in the image-making, based on comments
we'd gotten, and I immediately thought of Paul Davis. We wanted to
create something quieter, something that would actually add a new
layer of story.</TE>
<TE>   "It was all kind of based in the tradition of Paul Davis and the
Shakespeare Festival."</TE>
<TE>   But there was a difference. When creating posters for Papp and
company, Davis would often attend rehearsals to get a first-hand
sense of the play's creative direction. That couldn't happen in his
long-distance collaboration with the Geffen, conducted entirely via
e-mail and phone.</TE>
<TE>   "It helps of course to talk to the director and the costume
designer and the actors so you can find out what they're going to do
with the piece," Davis says, "but that just wasn't possible in this
case."</TE>
<TE>   Instead, he had to find his muse with the pages of each play. "The
answer is almost always in the script"--he pauses--"or the questions.
Questions are better, of course. You don't want to tell the whole
story in the poster, although that's one of the tendencies--people
want more of what the play's about. But I think it's much better to
give them a desire for more.</TE>
<TE>   "Essentially it's the same problem whether it's going to be a
poster or a small ad: You want to get people's attention and intrigue
them."</TE>
<TE>   Wagner served as liaison between Davis and Geffen producing
director Gilbert Cates, managing director Stephen Eich and artistic
director Randall Arney.</TE>
<TE>   She says the creative process was seamless--until they got to the
fifth play of the season. Traditionally a "to be announced"
selection, the slot was filled with a world premiere of Neil Simon's
"Rose &amp; Walsh" just days before Wagner's production deadline.</TE>
<TE>   "There had been this talk of this new play that they were going to
get in at the last minute," Wagner says, "and sure enough, it was
this Neil Simon play they decided to put in that space. It got tricky
because but they didn't want to reveal anything about the play
through image or what was written about it. So it was a delicate
issue of not revealing too much."</TE>
<TE>   Davis' solution was simplicity itself: no faces, two hands. There
was one more hurdle. "All of a sudden there was this [situation] that
Neil had to approve the image, which we hadn't had to go through in
the other plays," Wagner says.</TE>
<TE>   "Paul had a week to pull it off and didn't have that much time to
renovate it either. When Neil saw the sketch, I think he was
uncertain, and then he saw the finish and he warmed up to it the
night before I had to get the materials to the printer. So it worked
out. I think that image is gorgeous."</TE>
<TE>   But does it glow?</TE>
<TE>   That's the criterion that resonated for Wagner when the season
brochure was discussed at a Geffen staff meeting. "Steve Eich said
something that stuck in my head. He said, 'I want the brochure to be
something where if somebody places it on a coffee table, it just
starts glowing,' " Wagner says.</TE>
<TE>   "So I just got back from the printer a couple of hours ago and
I've put the brochure on my coffee table to see if it was glowing."
She laughs appreciatively. "It's pretty lovely."</TE>

<HD>His Legacy on the Line</HD>
<DH>With an album of new songs written for him, Burke is trying
to reclaim his rightful place in the soul music pantheon. But can the
singer leave the safety of the oldies?</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBERT HILBURN</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The permit on the dressing room wall at the House of Blues in West
Hollywood lists the capacity as 20, but twice that many people are
shoehorned into the space--and most will be joining Solomon Burke on
stage.</LD>
<LD>   "We need your immediate attention," demands the bear-sized Burke
from the rear of the room. "We go on stage in 15 minutes. No drinking
water on stage. No chewing gum. No talking. A hundred-dollar fine if
anyone talks."</LD>
<LD>   The 62-year-old soul singer, who weighs nearly 400 pounds, has
sunk so deep in an oversized chair it looks as if he'll need a crane
to lift him out.</LD>
<TE>   Everyone makes a pilgrimage to him--old friends who remember him
as the "king of rock and soul" back in the '60s, when sweet soul
music briefly ruled the airwaves, an elderly woman who attends
Burke's monthly church sermons and "healings" at a converted movie
theater in Inglewood.</TE>
<TE>   Part showman, part patriarch, Burke gives each of the guests a big
thank-you, a how-you-feeling, some flattery and, always, a closing
joke.</TE>
<TE>   "You're so beautiful," he tells Andrea Leonard, the KCRW-FM radio
host who will introduce him on stage. "You doing OK? Thank you so
much for coming tonight to do this for me ... just don't call me
Barry White."</TE>
<TE>   Holding court is second nature to this man, who has had audiences
under his spell since his childhood days in Philadelphia. He was such
a charismatic preacher that he had his own weekly radio show at age
12.</TE>
<TE>   By the time he was 21, he was captivating R&amp;B audiences with his
exquisite voice and showmanship. He took the "king" title so
seriously (it was given by an admiring disc jockey) that he walked on
stage in the mid-'60s with a bejeweled crown and 15-foot-long cape.</TE>
<TE>   Like many artists from the early days of R&amp;B and rock, Burke
complains about shamefully low record royalties, about being forced
to give away some of his publishing rights and being cheated by
greedy business associates.</TE>
<TE>   Worst of all, however, Burke has been robbed of his legacy.</TE>
<TE>   At one time, Burke was considered one of the greats of soul music,
right alongside Otis Redding, Sam Cooke and Jackie Wilson. Some even
called him the greatest. Asked 30 years ago to name the best soul
singer, producer Jerry Wexler, who has been in the studio with Ray
Charles, Aretha Franklin and Redding, declared, "Solomon Burke with a
borrowed band."</TE>
<TE>   Yet Burke's name has largely faded from the pop consciousness. He
hasn't had a Top 40 pop hit in almost 40 years and he has had a scant
presence for years on the U.S. concert circuit.</TE>
<TE>   What happened?</TE>
<TE>   No one may even have raised that question if Burke hadn't been
inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame last year. That honor
led numerous critics and industry insiders to brush up on their pop
history by searching out some of Burke's classic recordings. There
they discovered the remarkable purity, passion and range of his
voice. (See story, Page 77.)</TE>
<TE>   There's a tendency to think of soul singers as raspy and
explosive, but the heart of soul music's mix of gospel and R&amp;B
strains is in the sweet, soft, caressing notes. Burke is a master of
that soft touch, as he showed on such records as his first Atlantic
single, "Just Out of Reach (Of My Two Open Arms)," in 1961.</TE>
<TE>   But he was equally at home with the howling and aggressive soul
sound on "Cry to Me," his follow-up hit the next year. It's amusing
now to listen to the Rolling Stones' early versions of "Cry to Me"
and another Burke hit, "Everybody Needs Somebody to Love," and hear
Mick Jagger trying to incorporate some of Burke's phrasing into his
vocals.</TE>
<TE>   The key to Burke's resurgence rests in connecting with a new
generation of fans. His first step is "Don't Give Up on Me," a
just-released album on the Fat Possum label. On it, Burke interprets
songs written for him or given to him by such longtime admirers as
Bob Dylan, Van Morrison, Tom Waits and Elvis Costello. Reviews have
been glowing.</TE>
<TE>   The next--and most crucial--step is demonstrating on stage that
he's still a vital artist. That's why there seems to be a bit of
urgency in the air backstage--a trace of nervousness in his eyes. For
the first time in almost 30 years, there's something at stake again.
Burke is fighting to reclaim his legacy.</TE>
<TE>   It's not a slam dunk by any means. Burke has been doing the old
tunes so long that they have become a security blanket, but his
record company, among others, feels he must move into the new
material to maximize his opportunity today.</TE>
<TE>   "It's all so exciting," Burke says, ignoring for the moment the
issue of old versus new material. "I feel like a man who is finally
coming out of exile. Now, they just need to give me all the money."</TE>
<TE>   Burke is a colorful storyteller, and it's hard not to get so
caught up in the humor and rich detail of his tales about the old
days that you lose track of your main concern: How was it possible
for this man to fade from pop consciousness for all those years?</TE>
<TE>   Sitting in the living room of his large but not lavish two-story
home on the western edge of the San Fernando Valley, Burke tells many
of the stories that he has honed over the years--tales as
irresistible as his best records. His Hall of Fame induction
statuette and a House of Blues plaque rest on a mantel, the only
signs of the music business in the room.</TE>
<TE>   There are so many chapters in his story that it's hard to believe
he crammed all the adventures into one lifetime. Did we mention he
has 21 children and 67 grandchildren?</TE>
<TE>   Burke's story began 12 years before he was born James Solomon
McDonald in Philadelphia. (He doesn't remember his real father; the
name Burke comes from his stepfather.) That, he says, is when he came
to his grandmother in a vision that led her to form a church,
Solomon's Temple: the House of God for All People, in anticipation of
his birth. Young Solomon gave his first sermon in that church at age
7 and was soon known by the faithful as the "Boy Wonder Preacher."</TE>
<TE>   Burke started drawing wider attention around town in his mid-teens
when he made some records for the Apollo label, but most of his tales
deal with the years in the '60s when he was on Atlantic, the R&amp;B
powerhouse whose roster included Ray Charles, Clyde McPhatter and
Ruth Brown.</TE>
<TE>   There's the night in the '60s in the segregated South when a white
promoter, who booked Burke after hearing the country-tinged single
"Just Out of Reach," was shocked to find that Burke was black. In a
panic, he talked the singer into going on stage with his face covered
with bandages.</TE>
<TE>   There are also countless tales of Burke's efforts to make an extra
buck. While on a bus tour of the South with other R&amp;B artists, Burke
brought along bags of extra sandwiches and soda bottles to sell to
the musicians, knowing he could increase the prices the further they
got into the South.</TE>
<TE>   Burke tells these stories easily--and, one senses, often. He's by
nature a positive person who likes to see his story told in upbeat
terms.</TE>
<TE>   From some of the recent articles, you get the impression that
Burke is a wealthy entrepreneur who has a network of churches and a
financial share in a string of mortuaries.</TE>
<TE>   He does frequently preach and his family has ties to some
mortuaries, but none of this gives him a huge stream of money, people
close to him say.</TE>
<TE>   On a recent Sunday afternoon at the theater in Inglewood, there
were only about 125 people present. The microphone wasn't even
working, but that didn't faze Burke, who preached for more than an
hour.</TE>
<TE>   "Someone said on the way in, 'Bishop, the microphones aren't
working.' I said, 'So what? I wasn't born with a microphone. I was
born with a voice,' " Burke, a bishop in the House of God for All
People church, told the congregation in a booming voice.</TE>
<TE>   There was a time in the '70s when Burke preached at a church at
54th and Broadway in Los Angeles, and people would line up for hours
for a seat.</TE>
<TE>   Given the small turnout these days, you wonder why he doesn't
promote the church dates more. He doesn't even put his name on the
fliers in the theater window. "I don't want people coming here to see
Solomon Burke," he says softly. "I want them to see the bishop."</TE>
<TE>   His son, Solomon Jr., says, "I think my father is excited about
what's happening to him, but it's not like he's been melancholy all
these years. He keeps busy every day. He's a happy man. He has put
his life in God's hands and God takes care of him."</TE>
<TE>   It's only after all the stories about the sunny times that Burke
acknowledges some of the darker moments in his life, including
periods of financial struggle.</TE>
<TE>   "The Lord did bless us with this house," he says. "The owner said,
'I want you to have it.' He moved out and I moved in. He's selling it
to me. He's like an angel. I wouldn't qualify financially to buy this
house. I have a lot of debt--bills and expenses and children to
raise."</TE>
<TE>   The talk of struggle reveals a resentment over the money he thinks
he is owed from the old days.</TE>
<TE>   His first bitter taste of the music business came while he was
still on Apollo Records in the '50s when, he says, a former manager
pocketed some of Burke's concert fees. When confronted, the manager
warned that he would blackball Burke in the industry--and the singer
did find it hard to get club dates.</TE>
<TE>   "My life was shattered," he recalls now, sitting at home on a
wooden throne similar to the one he uses on stage and built
especially for his large frame. "I was so disillusioned I didn't want
to sing anywhere except in church."</TE>
<TE>   Burke, who by this time was married to the first of his three
wives, went to mortuary school and worked in a Philadelphia funeral
home owned by his aunt.</TE>
<TE>   But Burke finally returned to music. Even after signing with
Atlantic Records in 1960, however, he remained wary of industry
practices.</TE>
<TE>   Realizing it was hard for individual singers to stand up to record
companies, publishers and booking agencies, Burke organized some
other singers into a group called the Soul Clan. Burke's idea was
that the group, which also consisted of Arthur Conley, Don Covay, Ben
E. King and Joe Tex--wouldn't just record together, but stand
together to demand its rights in business affairs.</TE>
<TE>   The move sent signals to the industry that he was difficult to
work with, Burke says.</TE>
<TE>   "Organizing the artists wasn't something that was popular," he
says. "But I didn't think we were being treated right. It's the same
thing some recording artists are doing today."</TE>
<TE>   Burke seems especially upset over the songwriting credit for
"Everybody Needs Somebody to Love," which he sang during the Rock and
Roll Hall of Fame induction ceremony last year, stealing the show
from Aerosmith, Steely Dan and other inductees.</TE>
<TE>   The recordings have always listed three names: Burke, Wexler and
writer-producer Bert Berns, whose credits include "Here Comes the
Night" for Van Morrison's group Them and "Piece of My Heart" for
Janis Joplin. Burke claims he was the sole writer on the song but was
talked into sharing credit by Wexler and Berns.</TE>
<TE>   "I wanted the Soul Clan to be independent enough to say when we
write a song, we get credit for it and paid for it," he says. "When
I'm gone, I want the money from that song to go to my children, not
to Jerry Wexler or to the estate of Bert Berns."</TE>
<TE>   Various business disputes left Burke so disillusioned that he has
found it difficult to trust people, those close to him say. That led
him to manage himself and book his shows at times--moves that may not
have always been the most productive for his career. He has recorded
for several labels since leaving Atlantic in the late '60s and had
some R&amp;B hits with MGM Records in the early '70s. But nothing's been
on the charts since.</TE>
<TE>   Although he toured regularly in the U.S. and Europe in the '70s
and '80s, bookings dwindled in the '90s and averaged less than a
dozen shows a year in recent years.</TE>
<TE>   There are nearly two dozen Burke albums in circulation, including
repackages, on a variety of labels. Their total sales last year
amounted to only 12,000, according to Nielsen SoundScan. Burke filed
Chapter 7 bankruptcy in 1998, the result, someone close to Burke
says, of some "bad business deals."</TE>
<TE>   James Fifield, former chief of British music giant EMI and a
leader in the campaign to encourage record labels to upgrade the
royalty rate on reissues by '50s and '60s artists, is a huge Burke
fan and has been offering him counsel in recent years.</TE>
<TE>   About Burke's complaints about industry practices, Fifield, whose
relationship with Burke is personal, not professional, said recently,
"Solomon's early hits were in a different era, when I think artists
were taken advantage of, and that did lead to a trust issue. I don't
know if he ever really got a big royalty check. But that's history.</TE>
<TE>   "To me, the important thing is there is a new record out that has
been critically acclaimed. All these great artists have contributed
songs to it. My goal with this album is to make sure he finally gets
a real royalty check."</TE>
<TE>   No one has had to tell Andy Kaulkin, the lanky, 6-foot-7 president
of Epitaph Records, about Burke's legacy. Kaulkin grew up in the
Washington, D.C., area listening to Burke and other soul music greats</TE>
<TE>   Kaulkin wanted to sign Burke to Fat Possum, which is half-owned by
Epitaph, after seeing the singer at a blues festival last year in
Oregon.</TE>
<TE>   "Solomon was probably suspicious of me at the start," Kaulkin says
in his office at Epitaph's headquarters on Sunset Boulevard in Silver
Lake. "I think he thought I might be just another guy blowing smoke.
I get the sense he's met a lot of those guys over the years. I'm sure
he also had reservations about the kind of record I wanted to make.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't want to do another traditional soul album. There's no
point in trying to re-create what Jerry Wexler did so well. I wanted
to make a raw, organic record--just him and a few musicians so that
there is an intimacy to the recording--so that you can just hear that
great voice right out in front."</TE>
<TE>   Kaulkin tapped singer-songwriter Joe Henry to produce the record,
and they lined up the material together.</TE>
<TE>   "The response among songwriters was amazing," Kaulkin says. "We're
just a small label and I don't know these people, but when we called
managers to say we were looking for songs for Solomon Burke, we got
calls back sometimes as fast as a half an hour saying their artist
would love to give us a song. They all have so much respect for
Solomon. Elvis Costello even came down to the studio to watch Solomon
record his song."</TE>
<TE>   Weeks before the album's July 23 release, an ambitious press and
promotion campaign was put together.</TE>
<TE>   Asked for a sales prediction, Kaulkin pauses.</TE>
<TE>   "Our advance orders are about 40,000 in the U.S. and about the
same in Europe. He'll get a royalty check, but I think the main thing
is the album put him back in the spotlight. That's when he could
really cash in. He could get endorsements. Maybe some bigger label
would want to sign him. Our contract is only for one record, so he
has the freedom to go. I could even see him do some acting or see his
music get picked up in films.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm hoping the first-week sales will be around 3,000. If it does
5,000 copies, I'm going to be thrilled."</TE>
<TE>   "It's amazing the way Solomon is in the air right now," Wexler
says by phone from his home in East Hampton, N.Y. "It's amazing how
this funky little company has him on David Letterman's show and on
CNN."</TE>
<TE>   Wexler, 85, is as engaging a storyteller as Burke, and he's soon
into remembering some of their good times together.</TE>
<TE>   "There was a blizzard the morning we were to do the first
recording session with Solomon and I didn't know if I would be able
to get into" New York, says Wexler, who has also produced albums for
Bob Dylan, Willie Nelson and Dusty Springfield. "The trains weren't
running, but I made it in that morning and there was Solomon, who had
come up from Philadelphia. We did four songs in three hours,
including 'Just Out of Reach.'</TE>
<TE>   "After we finished recording, I went into the control room to
listen to the playback. I looked around for Solomon, but he was
heading out the door. He said he had to get back to Philadelphia
while it was still light because he had a job shoveling snow. I think
he was getting paid $3.50 an hour. He already had something like
eight kids."</TE>
<TE>   Wexler still marvels at the records Burke made for Atlantic. "I
was listening to one of the compilations the other day, and I think
it is one of the best I've ever heard. There are no fillers in there.
His voice is just magnificent."</TE>
<TE>   So why did Burke fade from pop consciousness?</TE>
<TE>   "The same thing happened to him as happened to everybody else from
that era.... Soul music went away. Disco and rap and hip-hop came in.
Plus, Solomon didn't have any real crossover hits. He remained the
province of the rhythm &amp; blues market, the Southern black audience.
He never reached the level of recognition of an Otis Redding or Al
Green, whose records exploded in the pop market."</TE>
<TE>   Dick Alen, a William Morris agent whose clients include Chuck
Berry, Aretha Franklin and Juanes, underscores the void left in
Burke's career by the lack of a crossover hit.</TE>
<TE>   "Solomon is one of my favorite talents, but he had a strictly
black following in the '60s, and that worked against him because
record sales and the live drawing power of R&amp;B acts was limited,"
says Alen, who worked with Burke in the '60s and who sometimes still
books him for shows.</TE>
<TE>   "If he had some crossover hits, he would also be a bigger concert
name today. One thing that hurt him was that his timing was a little
off. He hit before the big soul explosion."</TE>
<TE>   Wexler says he still speaks to Burke from time to time by phone.
"He's even made me a minister in his church. I've got this document
on my wall from Solomon that empowers me to do weddings,
confirmations, laying on of hands--and circumcision," Wexler says
with a chuckle.</TE>
<TE>   He doesn't, however, know much about Burke's world outside the
studio--or specifics of Burke's life since. "We weren't like Motown,
where Berry Gordy was involved in every part of his acts' life and
business." Wexler adds. "We didn't agent anyone or manage anyone. We
just made the records."</TE>
<TE>   What about the songwriting credit on "Everybody Needs Somebody to
Love"?</TE>
<TE>   Wexler sighs.</TE>
<TE>   "I know Solomon is upset about that, and I wrote him a long letter
explaining how we wrote the song together and that he has always
gotten his share of the royalties. I know that because I get royalty
checks for the song.</TE>
<TE>   "The whole process of making a record is a collaborative affair
and the issue of who does just what on a song sometimes gets
confusing, but not on that song. We wrote it in Bert's apartment.
Bert had a guitar and we wrote it together."</TE>
<TE>   Maybe, Wexler admits, they'll just never agree on the point.</TE>
<TE>   It's nearly show time at the House of Blues, and the musicians
shuffle nervously in the dressing room as Burke gets to his feet and
leads everyone in prayer. The band heads to the stage and begins
playing. The crowd waits eagerly for Burke to step out and reclaim
his "king of rock and soul" crown.</TE>
<TE>   After a few warmup numbers by the band, he makes his way to the
center of the stage and takes his place on his trademark throne. With
horns ablaze, he goes into the first number, and the voice is
everything you hoped it would be.</TE>
<TE>   He opens with "Don't Give Up on Me," the title song of the new
album. Written by Dan Penn, Carson Whitsett and Hoy Lindsey, it's the
story of a man trying to hold onto a loved one. But in the context of
the show, it's easy to hear the song as a plea to the pop world not
to give up on him after all these years.</TE>
<TE>   For the rest of the set, Burke focuses on oldies, mixing his own
hits, including "Cry to Me" and "Just Out of Reach," with songs
associated with Redding, Cooke and other singers.</TE>
<TE>   In "Cry to Me" alone you can hear Burke's influence. John Fogerty
is widely regarded as one of the great rock vocalists ever, and you
hear Burke's howl in several of the records he made with Creedence
Clearwater Revival, including "Born on the Bayou" and "Tombstone
Shadow."</TE>
<TE>   You also hear in "Cry to Me" a touch of the vocal stutter that
Redding would later use to great effect. In "Just Out of Reach,"
Burke laid down a blueprint for Ray Charles' later mixture of soul
and country.</TE>
<TE>   After 40 minutes, the show begins losing its punch because Burke
seems stuck in the past. He only does two more songs from the new
album, and late in the set he turns to "My Way," the Sinatra anthem
that simply has been worn out over the years.</TE>
<TE>   The set may be nice enough for longtime admirers, but anyone drawn
to the show by the new album is likely to be disappointed by the
oldies tone.</TE>
<TE>   Can he ever step away from the safety of the oldies? Backstage,
Burke vowed to do more of the new songs on his U.S. tour this fall.
The impact of the tour may depend on whether he follows through on
that pledge.</TE>
<TE>   "Thank God my father never gave up and that he is given this
opportunity," Burke's son Selassie says backstage before the concert.
"The good thing is he's getting the recognition while he's still
alive."</TE>
<TE>   And what was that first-week sales figure? 8,940 copies, according
to Nielsen SoundScan. That was enough to enter the national sales
charts at No. 138, the highest album chart position he has ever had.</TE>
<TE>   Somewhere, someone must be saying, "Hallelujah."</TE>

<HD>A Repertory Company of One</HD>
<DH>Director Neil LaBute cast Aaron Eckhart in four films
because 'I like his work. So why not use him?'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HUGH HART</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Even if you'd never seen pictures of Aaron Eckhart and Neil LaBute,
it would be pretty easy to figure out which one acts and which
directs. Eckhart is the lean, blond guy with chiseled features who
leaps up from a hotel sofa to impersonate, in slo-mo, the
neighborhood coyote that lopes through his Coldwater Canyon
neighborhood at dusk. LaBute, burly and bespectacled, sits still and
does most of the talking.</LD>
<LD>   In "Possession," which opens Friday, directed and adapted by
LaBute from A.S. Byatt's 1990 novel, Gwyneth Paltrow and Eckhart play
scholars who fall in love while researching the letters of an 18th
century poet. It marks the fourth collaboration in five years for
Eckhart and LaBute, who worked previously on "In the Company of Men"
(1997), "Your Friends and Neighbors" (1998) and "Nurse Betty" (2000).</LD>
<LD>   Why do these two stick together? LaBute explains: "The obvious
answer is, there's respect, there's the convenience factor and
there's a shorthand. Basically, Aaron allows me to talk and doesn't
say anything." Eckhart laughs. But LaBute says he keeps casting
Eckhart "because I know I'm going to get good work from Aaron and
good work is hard to find. I like him, I like his work, so why not
use him?"</LD>
<TE>   For Eckhart, having a history with LaBute means he can experiment
with bold character choices instead of worrying about making a good
impression on an unfamiliar director. "I know how to speak to Neil
and I can go right to him without worrying about peripheral players.
There's a certain trust there."</TE>
<TE>   The bond forged during their previous projects came in handy on
"Possession." "That was a whole 'nother ballgame," LaBute says.
Paltrow's celebrity provoked a media frenzy wherever the production
touched down during its 12-week shoot in England two years ago. "It
was a circus," LaBute says.</TE>
<TE>   Furthermore, the filmmakers were subject to intense studio
scrutiny. Says LaBute: "We did 'In the Company of Men' in 11 days. We
had less technical support then, but we had autonomy. Nobody was
there telling us things, whereas in this production, we had two
studios and we were shooting in England, so we were constantly
sending stuff back to the States. That's not an easy environment to
be creative in."</TE>
<TE>   Eckhart elaborates: "We were in a country with an English crew,
all these different locations--we were fish out of water. I'd see all
these faces I didn't know staring at me, and Gwyneth's there, who I
was just getting to know. There'd be these great English actors in
the room, and me, and I'm saying, 'What's wrong with this picture?'
But in the middle of all that," if things got too weird, he
continues, "I knew I could go to Neil for a barometer reading and
say, 'Neil, am I crazy?' "</TE>
<TE>   LaBute jokes, "I'd tell him, 'Yes, but not in this particular
instance, no, you're not.' " For LaBute, having a ready-made rapport
with Eckhart streamlined the "getting-acquainted" process on set. "I
had great respect for Gwyneth, yet I didn't know her at all. You go
into that situation feeling everything from 'Gosh, will she like me?'
to 'How do I get the best work out of her?' I don't know what she
likes and what she doesn't like. "Whereas with Aaron, that honeymoon
is past, there's none of that 'I have to get to know you' thing. That
sort of dance is already done."</TE>
<TE>   LaBute, now 39, and Eckhart, 34, met at Brigham Young University
in the '80s when the actor took a film ethics class from professor
LaBute. Says Eckhart, "I'd never experienced anybody like Neil
before, somebody who had big ideas and a big vision."</TE>
<TE>   "We also had a darker sense of humor and a contempt for what that
university represented at the time," Eckhart continues. "They wanted
to do these mundane plays that don't challenge you. Neil always
challenges you. Spend the afternoon with him and you're going to come
out smarter."</TE>
<TE>   There's one more factor, Eckhart says. LaBute believed in the
actor's talent when nobody else cared. "In New York I was struggling
for years," Eckhart says. "I'd sit at home watching something on TV
and go, 'I could do that!'--but nobody's asking you to do it."</TE>
<TE>   About five years after they had parted ways at Brigham Young,
LaBute raised $30,000 to make a film version of his play "In the
Company of Men." When he tracked down Eckhart, the actor was happy to
reprise the smaller role.</TE>
<TE>   "Then Neil called me up and said, 'Well, what about doing the
[larger] part?' I said, 'I don't think I can do it.' Then I hung up
the phone, looked around at my little apartment and called Neil back.
I said, 'I'll do it.' ... I felt, if Neil trusts me enough to do the
part, well, that gave me the confidence I needed."</TE>
<TE>   "In the Company of Men" starred Eckhart as a misogynist who plays
a cruel trick on a deaf woman at work. The movie raised hackles, got
rave reviews and served as a calling card for both men. Eckhart
landed roles in a few independent films, "Thursday" and "Molly,"
while LaBute found backers for his next effort, the 1998 dyspeptic
ensemble drama "Your Friends &amp; Neighbors."</TE>
<TE>   When it came time to cast "Friends," LaBute let Eckhart pick among
the three male characters. Eckhart opted for a less showy role,
adding a mustache and 45 pounds to portray a narcissistic cheat.</TE>
<TE>   In "Nurse Betty," the LaBute-directed 2000 satire starring Renee
Zellweger, Eckhart again got to choose: handsome soap star
(ultimately played by Greg Kinnear) or Betty's worthless husband.</TE>
<TE>   Eckhart picked the smaller role.</TE>
<TE>   By this time, Steven Soderbergh and Sean Penn had become fans.
Soderbergh cast him as the title character's biker boyfriend in "Erin
Brockovich," and Penn chose the actor to play a detective in "The
Pledge."</TE>
<TE>   As with John Turturro and the Coen brothers, William H. Macy and
David Mamet, or Philip Baker Hall and Paul Thomas Anderson, Eckhart
serves LaBute as a kind of one-man repertory company. LaBute does not
write parts with Eckhart in mind; he produces a script, then lets
Eckhart decide.</TE>
<TE>   "Aaron's range allows me to say to him, 'This is what's available
in this script, so go for what interests you.' It's not about how
many lines or how much screen time you have. If you commit to a role,
the person you play is supposed to come alive," LaBute explains. "So
for 'Nurse Betty,' Aaron went to Barstow and tramped around car
dealerships hanging out with the kind of guy he imagined Del was.
It's the same level of commitment he showed in sculpting the person
in 'Possession.' "</TE>
<TE>   Neither LaBute, who lives in a Chicago suburb with his wife and
two children, nor Eckhart, single, who lives in Los Angeles, seems
particularly surprised that they're still making pictures together
and sharing laughs.</TE>
<TE>   "As friends, it's as strong as it ever was," LaBute says. "And
we're guys, so the relationship is virtually unchangeable. We're
incredibly close on a very surface level. That's the way men
operate."</TE>
<TE>   For LaBute and Eckhart, the ties that bind are wrapped around the
work, and their methods remain essentially unchanged from their
college years.</TE>
<TE>   Back then, LaBute recalls, the university allotted three hours for
finals. LaBute would structure his exams to last only one hour so he
could spend the extra time putting student actors through their paces
on stage.</TE>
<TE>   "We used to rehearse the hell out of those plays, if I remember,"
Eckhart says.</TE>
<TE>   "Yeah," LaBute adds, "like at 12 at night. Those were good days,
but they aren't the 'good old days' because we're the same way
now--the more rehearsal we can get, the happier we are."</TE>
<TE>   "Look," says LaBute, casting an unsentimental glance at their
tandem journey, "as a student your job is to question the way things
are done, and that's all we were doing. We were very good at
questioning authority. And it's still a matter of questioning
authority, because nobody really expected something like 'Possession'
from us. So why not do something that people don't see coming?"</TE>

<HD>A Chelsea Girl Still Bewitched by Warhol</HD>
<DH>Artist, actress and author Mary Woronov revisits memorable
days as a Factory worker</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HUNTER DROHOJOWSKA- PHILP</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The auditorium of the Museum of Contemporary Art was filled to
capacity a couple of weeks ago, when Mary Woronov added her two cents
to the Andy Warhol retrospective. Woronov, one of the stars of his
films, is still a beauty, with dark eyes and planar cheekbones. She
doesn't look all that different from when she appeared in "Chelsea
Girls" in 1965, although her hair is brown now and streaked with
gray.</LD>
<LD>   Woronov narrated a slide show of other Factory regulars and brief
clips of her film appearances, and then read from her most recent
book, "Eyewitness to Warhol." In two essays and a self-interview, she
examines the meaning of the artist's films, which she considers
"monumental."</LD>
<LD>   "What Warhol was doing is what any artist does: He tried to pin
down the thing he finds most alluring and elusive. For Andy, it was
intimacy," she told the audience. " 'Screen Tests' allows you to look
for as long as you like into someone's eyes, while they look back at
you."</LD>
<TE>   This is Woronov's second book devoted to Warhol; her first,
"Swimming Underground," a memoir of her life at the Factory, came out
in 1995. This slim, silver-paper-bound volume is a much more
objective view. Her publisher is art historian Victoria Dailey, who
became intrigued through informal conversations with Woronov. Dailey,
whose eponymous company occasionally published books on the arts,
found Woronov's accounts of working with Warhol to be refreshingly
irreverent: "acerbic, insightful and accurate" are her words.</TE>
<TE>   Although Woronov's first book was autobiographical, in these
essays she describes Warhol's filmmaking process and philosophy.
Woronov is a survivor, one of the few of the Factory denizens still
alive. She offers a unique firsthand account of her experience
observing Warhol socially and as one of his actors.</TE>
<TE>   Woronov, 60, lives with her dog, Tina, and cat, Ashley, in what
she calls a "witch's cottage" off Beverly Boulevard in Hollywood. She
has painted the walls of the tiny house in bright colors, and the
upstairs studio floor is lime green. The rooms are hung with dozens
of landscape and figure paintings by Woronov, who has never given up
making art despite almost failing the subject at school.</TE>
<TE>   Everywhere, however, there is evidence of her most recent
occupation: author. Walls are lined with books, and she writes at a
big table looking out onto a courtyard.</TE>
<TE>   She may have 72 film credits to her name (her favorite being
"Eating Raoul," in which she co-starred as one half of the murderous
couple), but since the success of "Swimming Underground," she has
turned to writing, mostly concentrating on fiction. "Snake: A Novel,"
and "Niagara," her most recent book, were both published in Britain
by Serpent's Tail.</TE>
<TE>   "Eyewitness to Warhol," however, is more analytical. In describing
"Chelsea Girls," she writes, "Warhol movies are not narrative, linear
or entertaining.... Andy was not into entertainment, which moves
along. He was into voyeurism, which moves in, close, as close as
possible, stopping on the subject until it's uncomfortable.... And
when you refuse to move on, when you stop for no reason, you open up
a void, which imagination is forced to fill."</TE>
<TE>   Woronov's book also details Warhol's working process. For example,
when the script ran out before the film was used up, Warhol would
tell scriptwriter Ronald Tavel to jump in front of the camera and
improvise.</TE>
<TE>   Before a life of sex, drugs and rock 'n' roll at the Factory,
Woronov lived a largely middle-class existence in the suburbs of
Brooklyn, N.Y. Her stepfather was a doctor and she was sent to
private school from age 6, which is, she says, "the only reason I am
as intelligent as I am."</TE>
<TE>   She was a 20-year-old art student at Cornell University when her
class visited Warhol's New York City studio in 1964. Poet Gerard
Malanga grabbed her and insisted she take a screen test. As the steel
doors of the elevator shut on her classmates' faces, she recalls, "I
forgot I ever knew them."</TE>
<TE>   "That was my most famous move, ever," she says of leaving school
for full-time Factory life.</TE>
<TE>   Warhol was painfully shy and surrounded himself with an entourage
so he wouldn't have to make conversation. Woronov says, "I don't
think I talked to Andy but five times." But she was close to other
Factory regulars. She traveled with Lou Reed to Los Angeles as a
dancer with the multimedia performances of the Velvet Underground's
Exploding Plastic Inevitable shows.</TE>
<TE>   It was under the tutelage of Paul Morrissey, who directed Warhol's
"Chelsea Girls," that she came to memorize her first lines and
seriously pursue acting. The documentary-style,
stream-of-consciousness film is, in Woronov's words, the Factory's
answer to Hollywood. For hours in the film, she reclines on a Chelsea
Hotel bed with two other women, but her scenes are not sexy, she
says. She explains the Warholian ethos: "You can't have a movie
without a female star, but it was the guys who were sexy." Morrissey
decided on the split-screen format of the film, explaining that if
the audience was bored with one view, "they can watch the other, they
can choose."</TE>
<TE>   Woronov appeared in half a dozen films but also acted with the
experimental Theater of the Ridiculous. Then came 1968, when Valerie
Solanas shot Warhol. "After that," Woronov says, "it was all
different. Andy got rid of all those freaks. It was a new crowd.
You'd have to go through four secretaries to see him. It was all
uptight and clean. He didn't do movies anymore, so he didn't need
us."</TE>
<TE>   Post-Factory, Woronov continued acting in New York (she was
praised for her work in "In the Boom Boom Room" at Lincoln Center)
and moved, in 1973, to Los Angeles. Starring roles in many of Roger
Corman's films followed. She married, moved to the Valley, divorced,
and got caught up in the punk scene of the '70s and '80s. "I was like
this old woman at the Starwood," she jokes, "but I loved the music."
An illness curbed her club activities, however, and it was during her
recovery that she began to write.</TE>
<TE>   Initially, she penned a series of short stories to accompany a
catalog of her paintings, "Wake for the Angels." Then she delved into
her memory for "Swimming Underground," which the London Observer
called "obscenely interesting: absurd, lurid, and grandiose," and
Reed called "the best book on Warhol."</TE>
<TE>   Woronov admits that the line between fiction and nonfiction might
get a little blurred in her books, as befits a product of the Factory
where life blended with art. "Snake: A Novel" is about a woman
trapped in a bad marriage, and  "Niagara" includes a character based
on her younger brother.</TE>
<TE>   "I have one story to tell and it's my life," she says.</TE>
<TE>   As for "Eyewitness to Warhol," it came about because "everyone
always asks me about Warhol." Her first book she sees as history;
this book is her explanation of what was behind it all. "It took me a
long time to figure out that he was looking for intimacy," she says.</TE>
<TE>   Woronov continues to act; she had the lead role last year in an
independent film by Todd Hughes, "The New Women," which concerns the
fate of the last women on Earth. The low-budget movie, shot in
black-and-white, excites her. "I love working this way," she says
with a laugh. "It reminds me of the old days." The film, which was
shown at the Toronto Film Festival, still hasn't been released.</TE>
<TE>   "I am not a brilliant actress but I'm entertaining. This is why
I've become a cult queen."</TE>
<TE>   Turning serious, Woronov adds, "The one thing that Andy taught me
was workaholism. You just have to keep working. I have a mind that
doesn't stop.</TE>
<TE>   "There is always a little further to go."</TE>

<HD>Late but Not Great Warhol</HD>
<DH>Conventional wisdom has it that his work in the 1970s and
'80s was subpar. So what? The artist's earlier work remains
groundbreaking.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRISTOPHER KNIGHT</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>At Barcelona's Picasso Museum, I once overheard an American couple
exclaim over the Spanish artist's extraordinary youthful facility
with a pencil. I wasn't eavesdropping. They were making a commotion.</LD>
<LD>   As the couple looked at a display case filled with drawings he
made at the age of 14, 15, 16, they were agog. Like most Americans,
they obviously knew Picasso as a Modernist--better yet, as the
Modernist--whose incisive abstractions changed the course of 20th
century art. They were unprepared for a teenage prodigy who drew
realist pictures like a whiz--acute charcoal renderings of classical
statuary, precise pencil portraits, careful landscape studies and
more.</LD>
<LD>   Born in Malaga, Spain, Picasso took most of his academic training
as an artist in Barcelona, the rough but cosmopolitan city on the
Mediterranean at the northeast corner of Spain. The museum's spotty
collection is strongest in work he did while a student there.</LD>
<TE>   "Look at this!" sputtered the husband to the wife, as he went from
one youthful drawing to the next. "It's amazing! Look how well he
could draw! And then somehow he ... he ... he just lost it!"</TE>
<TE>   Of course, most observers would say that when he made his wildly
inventive foray into Cubist abstraction in 1907, at the age of 26,
Picasso actually found it. Not only hadn't he "lost" anything, he had
gained such facility with the tools of art that he could make
unexpected visual magic happen. Had Picasso continued throughout his
long life (he died at 91) to make the kind of proficient academic
drawings that so excited the American couple, there would be no
Picasso Museum in Barcelona today. He'd be just another talented but
forgotten artist.</TE>
<TE>   I thought of that couple the other day when I was reading a review
in the New York Times of the retrospective of paintings by Andy
Warhol that winds up its run at the Museum of Contemporary Art next
Sunday. It certainly wasn't the Pop artist's youthful facility with a
pencil that brought the scene to mind. Warhol didn't have much of
that. A clumsy 1942 self-portrait, drawn when the Pittsburgh lad was
14, shows that draftsmanship was never his long suit.</TE>
<TE>   Warhol did go on to develop a compelling graphic style in the
1950s, which made him hugely successful as a commercial artist in New
York working in the field of product advertising. It's not
surprising, though, that this elegant graphic technique typically
involved tracing over photographs with pen and ink. Then, like a
Hollywood diva gazing into a makeup mirror, Warhol would blot the wet
line with tissue paper.</TE>
<TE>   The result was a line of dappled sensuousness. Maybe the guy
couldn't draw, but he sure had style.</TE>
<TE>   What reminded me of the Barcelona experience was the critic's
claim that Warhol's art from the 1970s and 1980s--that is, work from
the decades following his classic Pop paintings, prints and
underground films of the 1960s--is "ripe for serious reassessment."
Those are the years when Marilyn Monroe, Campbell's soup cans, car
crashes and electric chairs were all pretty much behind him. Warhol's
career can be (and usually is) divided into three parts: the early
advertising art, the classic 1960s Pop and the late work. (He died in
1987 at age 58, so "late" is relatively early in the normal scheme of
things.) The first two have been fully scrutinized in museum shows;
the third one hasn't.</TE>
<TE>   MOCA's painting retrospective is heavily weighted toward the
extraordinarily productive Pop years of 1962 to 1968. The late work
is given pretty short shrift. I think the discrepancy is appropriate.
Late Warhol isn't great Warhol. And for reasons I'll get to in a
moment, that doesn't diminish his significance.</TE>
<TE>   In the 1970s and 1980s, Warhol was making silk-screen paintings of
skulls, commissioned portraits of the rich and/or famous, military
camouflage patterns and more. He was also tinkering with
technique--adding sparkly diamond dust into his pigment, urinating
onto copper-laced pigment that would oxidize and turn green, even
returning to painting by hand, rather than with photographic
silk-screens, in mural-sized copies of Leonardo da Vinci's "Last
Supper." He also tried collaborating with such fashionable younger
artists as Francesco Clemente and Jean-Michel Basquiat. Examples are
on view at MOCA, but none is seen in depth.</TE>
<TE>   The critic didn't say why reassessment of late Warhol was pressing
or what exactly it has to offer that is so significant. But the
statement does reflect the degree to which Warhol's post-1960s work
has been held in rather low regard. Warhol's Pop art is widely
accepted as a watershed. And then somehow he ... he ... he just lost
it.</TE>
<TE>   At least, so goes the conventional wisdom. Warhol was a
quintessential new artist for the 1960s, and when the '60s were over,
so--inevitably--was he. But now, decades after the fact and 15 years
after the artist's death, rediscovery of the long-obscured brilliance
of the later work is what's expected, as surely as spring follows
winter.</TE>
<TE>   Well, not so fast. MOCA's Warhol retrospective is right to
emphasize the classic Pop paintings. One of the great things about
the show is that Warhol's art of the 1960s is ripe for reassessment,
never mind that of the 1970s and 1980s.</TE>
<TE>   Among its supporters and detractors, Warhol's Pop has long been
perceived--and I would say, misperceived--for its social rather than
artistic content. Love it or hate it, this interpretation goes,
Warhol brought mass-production techniques and mass-media images into
art's mainstream, thereby generating the mechanism for a critique of
popular culture. Pop culture--corporate, commercial and coercive--has
inundated contemporary experience. From inside the superior precincts
of art, this mistaken idea goes, Warhol was commenting on the
debasements of the larger society.</TE>
<TE>   Likewise, Warhol's late work has been held in low regard not so
much because of its artistic merits, but because it too has been
considered in social terms. Critics come close to castigating the
artist for moral lassitude. How vulgar of Warhol to have sold off his
talents to the highest bidder, taking commissions for portraits of
socialites and captains of industry. How cheesy to have sprinkled
diamond dust into his paint, like some medieval artisan weighing out
the lapis lazuli to be ground into pigment for the Virgin Mary's
robe. How awful to have tried to ride the coattails of a younger
generation of stylish 1980s superstars.</TE>
<TE>   A reconsideration of Warhol in the 1960s, however, shows that
Warhol's Pop icons don't critique popular culture at all. His
paintings don't exploit the stylish visual language of mass media to
deconstruct social ills. If they criticize anything, it's the foolish
pretensions of high culture. The flamboyant paintings creatively
manipulate seductive media glamour to signify haughty cliches about
established Modern art--from Picasso's lifelong Romantic obsession
with sex and death to Jackson Pollock's all-American machismo. In the
process, mass culture is redeemed.</TE>
<TE>   Warhol was an artist who deconstructed art, not society. Once the
1960s work is reassessed in this way, the late work falls into place.
He didn't "lose it" in the 1970s and 1980s--he kept it up. Mixing
diamond dust into acrylic was his Tiffany version of the old Cubist
trick of mixing sand into oil paint to give the surface visual grit.
Urinating onto copper pigment, so that oxidation would turn it green,
gave Pollock's famous drip paintings a venerable (and witty) patina
of age--while also varnishing the legendary story about Pollock's
peeing into Peggy Guggenheim's marble fireplace during a drunken
uptown cocktail party in 1944.</TE>
<TE>   Does that mean there's no difference between Warhol's paintings
from the 1960s and his later work? Of course not. The 1960s work is
more significant, if only because it was the leading edge that broke
a logjam in our perceptions of art. Whenever a new artist makes a
cataclysmic stir there follows a period in which everything he or she
does is perceived to be a letdown. The risible shock of the new,
which is among art's distinctive pleasures, cannot be maintained in
perpetuity.</TE>
<TE>   There is also genuine repetitiousness in late Warhol and the sense
that he's searching (in vain) for a new version of the kick that
animated the '60s. I also assume that, obsessed with his own
publicity, he sometimes painted just to fulfill expectations. A lot
of critics noted early on that death was a central theme in his
paintings of the 1960s--from post-suicide Marilyn Monroe to the great
series of electric chairs and car crashes. Given Warhol's reliance on
tabloid newspaper sources for his art, the theme of tragic mortality
is inescapable. But by 1976, when he began a large series of
paintings focused on a human skull, he must have known he was feeding
his own mythology while giving it the high-culture gloss of
Shakespearean tragedy.</TE>
<TE>   Alas, poor Andy. By 1976 we knew him too well.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, with late Warhol there is the big problem of his success.
Warhol's sense of visual style had certainly been triumphant. The
world at large had come to look very much the way his flashy
paintings looked in the 1960s. So, in the 1970s and 1980s, his own
art inevitably seemed less distinctive.</TE>
<TE>   And that's the key to the late work. Warhol didn't lose it. He
just kept making more.</TE>

<LD>Our Lady of the Angels fraught with angst and drama and ... owls?
("Sacred Creations," by Suzanne Muchnic, Aug. 4).</LD>
<LD>   I was delighted to see the article discussing the art and
sculpture for the new cathedral, and the difficulties and challenges
of creating the pieces. I read the closing line from Robert Graham:
"I'm very proud of it," he says. "But it doesn't have much to do with
me anymore. I'm happy to start letting it go."</LD>
<LD>   I then paged back to look at the photo of his doors. Examining it
carefully, I chuckled when I looked at the top right corner of the
entrance and there I noticed an addition, perhaps a liturgical
commentary. I understand how he feels.</LD>

<TE>   Did anyone else notice how the architecture and art chosen for the
new Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels downtown resembles the
aesthetic of Clive Barker "Hellraiser" horror films? At first glance,
I thought that's what the article was about--a new movie in the
series. The doors of the south ambulatory look like that sinister
cube from the films.</TE>
<TE>   Then I looked closer, at the doors, the tapestries, the altar
base, the bishop's chair and that hideous crucifix, and came to the
conclusion that most Catholics must be absolutely appalled by these
horrific creations.</TE>
<TE>   And at what cost? How many millions were spent for these '80s
postmodern deconstructivist leftovers, which seem more suitable to a
"Hellraiser" film than a place of worship?</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>I have to take issue with the story "Kids' Stories, Grown-Up
Business" (by Rachel Abramowitz, Aug. 4) referencing the much
discredited Bruno Bettelheim. To pillory Bettelheim today, one would
have to take a ticket and stand in line. Recently a PBS P.O.V.
documentary, "Refrigerator Mothers," brought out the psychological
harm his theories inflicted on mothers of autistic children, even
when neurological evidence countered his views.</LD>
<LD>   Abramowitz cites his work "The Uses of Enchantment" in her story.
However, the well-researched book by Richard Pollak, "The Creation of
Dr. B," reveals Bettelheim's direct plagiarism of Julius Heuscher's
"A Psychiatric Study of Fairy Tales" as the real source of the work.</LD>
<LD>   Pollak's work also showed that Bettelheim falsified his academic
credentials.</LD>
<TE>   Bettelheim deserves no rehabilitation from anyone.</TE>

<LD>You should publish an apology, or perhaps a severe smarm alert, for
the spiteful and nonsensical piece on Danny Gans ("Las Vegas Loves
Who?," by Paul Brownfield, July 28).</LD>
<LD>   He's sneered at for carrying water around and protecting his
throat? Every singer in Vegas does that--they're in the desert.</LD>
<LD>   He has pictures of himself with famous people on the wall? He
sells T-shirts? He works hard for his money and people love his show
enough to make their friends go see it? Horror of horrors! Who does
he think he is--a professional entertainer or something?</LD>
<TE>   He's a family man whose life actually reflects his Christian
beliefs? Unspeakable! How dare he succeed in his chosen field!</TE>
<TE>   I agree with the letter writer from last week--I haven't seen him,
but because of this hatchet job of an article, I will go as soon as I
can. Go get 'em, Danny.</TE>

<TE>   As a former Las Vegas entertainment journalist, I'm not surprised
in the least that Danny Gans would not only rebuff a reviewer who
didn't privately contact him before the performance to tell him what
not to perform, but also criticize an A-minus rating. Las Vegas
entertainers, generally speaking, are never satisfied with anything
less than glowing praise, and regard journalistic ethics as something
that should apply to everyone but themselves. Oh well, he's got
bigger things to cry over. If his ego is still stung by a
near-excellent critique in his hometown paper, can you imagine how
he'll react once he realizes that no one outside Nevada really cares
about his Rich Little-on-steroids shtick?</TE>

<TE>   On Aug. 1 Danny Gans perpetuated an appalling gay stereotype in
his impression of Johnny Mathis by batting his eyes, prancing,
swishing and mincing about the stage while hissing and lisping
sibilant S's. The bit ended with a pursed-lipped kiss blown from a
limp-wristed hand.</TE>
<TE>   This vile impression brought into horrifying perspective other
snide gay innuendoes involving Prince and Inspector Clouseau.</TE>
<TE>   This heinous behavior is especially unconscionable from a man who
purports to be a devout Christian and who uses the expression "what
the heck" instead of its alternative. It was not a family-oriented
show, but hate-mongering from a wolf in sheep's clothing. Gans is
reckless for fanning those flames. If he wants to be so savagely
satirical, he should bill himself as the new Andrew Dice Clay and not
mislead people.</TE>
<TE>   His take on Mathis was deliberately hateful and disgusting. And he
didn't even sound like him.</TE>

<TE>   What kind of burr does Geoff Nelson have under his saddle that he
had to use the article on Danny Gans to take a cheap shot at Johnny
Mathis (Letters, Aug. 4)? My friends and I went to Las Vegas every
time Johnny performed there. We also attended a concert every time he
appeared in the Los Angeles-Orange County area. I never heard him say
he had to give up a shot at the 1956 Olympics. In fact, he never said
much at all, he just did what he does best--sing. I have read
articles through the years that mentioned he was an athlete at
school. What's wrong with that?</TE>
<TE>   I'm glad Nelson finally got that off his chest. Forty-plus years
is a long time to brood about something so insignificant.</TE>
<TE>   Johnny Mathis never had to be a wannabe. He was, and is, the
greatest.</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   An Aug. 4 letter commenting on Danny Gans' claims of sports
achievements and comparing them to those of a singer and athlete from
another era had some misinformation.</TE>
<TE>   While Johnny Mathis and Bill Russell both attended colleges in San
Francisco in the 1950s, they were never teammates.</TE>
<TE>   Johnny Mathis attended San Francisco State and set a Gator and
conference high-jump record of 6 feet, 5 inches in 1955--two inches
short of the Olympic record at the time, according to school records.</TE>
<TE>   Bill Russell played in 55 games of a 60-game winning streak in
1955-56 for the University of San Francisco Dons. As a member of the
U.S. Olympic team in the 1956 Summer Games in Melbourne, Russell won
a gold medal.</TE>
<TE>   Instead of accepting an invitation to try out for the Olympics,
Mathis chose a recording career, signing with Columbia Records.</TE>

<HD>On a River of Memory</HD>
<DH>In 'The Danube Exodus,' an interactive installation adds
layers to a documentary on groups fleeing World War II</DH>
<SE></SE>

<LD>The Bessarabian Germans mourned the loss of their homeland and
possessions. The Jews danced and rejoiced; they lost everything but
their lives had been saved. Still, the uncanny parallelism is a
matter of record. These Jews and Germans were both transported to
safety and documented on film by the same river captain, who ferried
them into historical memory.</LD>
<LD>   That brief paragraph, printed in an exhibition brochure, sums up
the story line that wends its way through "The Danube Exodus: The
Rippling Currents of the River," an interactive documentary by
Hungarian filmmaker Peter Forgacs that opens Saturday at the Getty
Research Institute. Based on Forgacs' 1997 film, "The Danube
Exodus"--which grew out of 1939-40 footage shot by ship captain and
amateur photographer Nandor Andrasovits--the new work surrounds the
audience with sights and sounds of two groups of people fleeing World
War II in opposite directions on the Danube River.</LD>
<LD>   Navigating a small touch screen and scanning moving images that
wrap around three walls, viewers can follow the refugees' journeys
and the river itself--or venture into various tributaries. There are
no battle scenes or Holocaust images, but those horrors provide an
invisible background for the human warmth and natural beauty that
flicker across the screens.</LD>
<TE>   "It's an infinite pool of memory in the shadow of the war,"
Forgacs says of his new work, which was realized in collaboration
with the Getty and the Labyrinth Project at USC's Annenberg Center
for Communication. Unlike the 60-minute film he made five years ago,
which tells "a linear story," he says, the interactive piece--which
takes about four hours to view in its entirety--is like a grid.
"Everything is instantly there for your choice, so you can make a
journey within a journey. You travel on a river of memory."</TE>
<TE>   Poetically convoluted as that may sound, it's typical of Forgacs'
sensibility. A collector of home movies and found footage who calls
himself a "forensic coroner" rather than a documentary filmmaker, he
delights in building layers of meaning that reflect intertwining and
sometimes conflicting accounts of history.</TE>
<TE>   But he's quick to say that this new work is not a one-man
show--and that the tale of its conception and evolution is not a
short story.</TE>
<TE>   The saga begins in Budapest with a tip from a friend about the
Hungarian ship captain's footage of two voyages on the Danube. One
film, shot in 1939, tells of Eastern European Jews headed for the
Black Sea and a second ship that would transport them to a new home
in Palestine. The other, taken the following year, after the Soviet
re-annexation of Bessarabia, recounts the flight of German emigres
who left their adopted homeland and returned to Germany.</TE>
<TE>   Forgacs acquired the footage from Capt. Andrasovits' widow and
combined it with outtakes from the film of the Jewish voyage, donated
by historian-archivist Janos Varga, who had inherited the material
from a friend of the captain. After the film was aired on European
television, some of the refugees and their relatives contacted the
filmmaker and gave him additional information, in taped interviews
and diaries.</TE>
<TE>   Listening to divergent accounts of the two journeys, Forgacs was
confronted with "the problem of memory," he says. But he was also
inspired to make use of the new material. In 2000, when he came to
Los Angeles as a visiting scholar at the Getty Research Institute, he
hoped to make a CD-ROM that would expand the film.</TE>
<TE>   As he settled into Los Angeles and began to make contacts, Marsha
Kinder, who directs the Labyrinth Project and is chairwoman of the
division of critical studies at USC's School of Cinema-Television,
got wind of his aspirations.</TE>
<TE>   Kinder says she was impressed by Forgacs' ability to bring new
meanings to found footage. She was also struck by the emotional
impact of his work and the "mesmerizing music" of his longtime
collaborator, composer Tibor Szemzo.</TE>
<TE>   As for Forgacs, finding Labyrinth in Los Angeles was "like walking
on a seashore and suddenly finding a golden ring," he says. "It was a
miracle."</TE>
<TE>   The Labyrinth Project was born in 1997 with "an offer I couldn't
refuse," Kinder says. Elizabeth Daley, executive director of the
Annenberg Center, asked her to "develop a research initiative that
would somehow create a productive dialogue between cinema and new
media." She saw an exciting opportunity "to create a space where we
could produce experimental interactive narratives that were not
market-driven," she says. "I firmly believe in working at the
pressure point between theory and practice. People talk about that in
the abstract; I thought it would be exciting to really do it."</TE>
<TE>   One of Labyrinth's first ventures, staged in 1999, was
"Interactive Frictions," a conference and exhibition at USC's Fisher
Gallery. The program focused on hybrid forms of new and traditional
media, with an emphasis on experimental approaches. But it also made
the point that Labyrinth "was not going to be exaggerating the claims
for the newness of new media," Kinder says. "One of the key
interactive frictions was between prior, non-digital media and the
new. I thought that was a way of expanding the possibilities of
interactive narratives. Most of the games I had seen at that point
seemed pretty boring for people who are really engaged in narrative
experimentation and the whole history of cinema."</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, Kinder was looking for established artists who
might be enticed to produce new work at the laboratory. Her first
three choices were novelist John Rechy and filmmakers Nina Menkes and
Pat O'Neill.</TE>
<TE>   "All of them are wonderful artists, and yet none of them was
working with new media," Kinder says. "We provided access to this new
world with equipment, a budget, our core team of multimedia artists
and a group of talented students. It was a very good learning
experience for all of us. We collaborated on interface design and had
workshops with scholars and artists. Then we set about making their
projects."</TE>
<TE>   Rechy's CD-ROM, "Mysteries and Desire: Searching the Worlds of
John Rechy," sets a network of personal memories and family documents
against collective histories of Chicano culture and the gay world.
Building on his literary autobiography-in-process, the writer has
assembled images in three interrelated realms: Memories, Bodies and
Cruising. Menkes' CD-ROM, "The Crazy Bloody Female Center," draws on
five feature films she made with her sister Tinka Menkes, including
"Magdalena Viraga," "Queen of Diamonds" and "The Bloody Child."
O'Neill's DVD-ROM, "Tracing the Decay of Fiction: Encounters With a
Film by Pat O'Neill," explores the colorful, star-studded history of
the Ambassador Hotel.</TE>
<TE>   The Labyrinth Project was founded as a three-year initiative, but
it continues to receive funding from the Annenberg Center. In
addition to Kinder, there are three full-time staff members: Rosemary
Comella, interface designer and software developer; JoAnn Hanley,
program coordinator; and Kristy H.A. Kang, graphics designer and art
director.</TE>
<TE>   A $100,000 grant from the Rockefeller Foundation has provided
funding for Forgacs' project, and soon-to-be-released works by
filmmaker Carroll Parrott Blue and cultural theorist Norman Klein. In
addition, a Labyrinth-produced Web site, Dream Waves, is in the
works. Conceived as an exhibition space for dream-based art and a
place to explore dreams as a model for interactive narrative, it will
make its debut this fall at L.A. Freewaves' eighth festival of
experimental media arts.</TE>
<TE>   Forgacs' project, which began as an idea for a CD-ROM but evolved
into what Kinder calls "an immersive installation," was a big
challenge for the Labyrinth team. "But we are only interested in
taking pieces that expand our reach," she says. "We had never done a
museum installation of this scale, with five screens and surround
sound. That was very exciting. At the same time, this gave Peter a
chance to re-edit his material on a scale that he had never
experienced before. He became totally obsessed with it."</TE>
<TE>   Readily confessing his obsession, Forgacs says he immersed himself
in the process of creating "parallel narratives."</TE>
<TE>   As the exhibition shaped up, it called for the development of
three story lines in adjacent spaces. In a small room on one side of
the central screening room, visitors encounter the story of the
Jewish exodus in silent footage, interviews and other background
materials; on the opposite side of the screening room, a similar
display is devoted to the Bessarabian Germans. In the central space,
stories of the two groups, the captain and the river itself merge in
a panoramic flow of imagery. Here, Forgacs' task was to create five
interrelated streams of pictures, composed of three- to five-minute
segments.</TE>
<TE>   Visitors who enter the screening room when no one is directing the
action see a pre-programmed sampling of moving pictures. Those who
step up to the touch screen can choose from a menu that includes
specific segments of the voyages, life along the river and an
appreciative view of women who fled to safety on the Danube. As
Forgacs says, "The captain had an eye for women."</TE>
<TE>   To accommodate the show--organized by Kinder and Zaia Alexander of
the Getty--a lecture hall next to the research institute's small
galleries has been temporarily converted into a screening room. A
display in the galleries provides an introduction and historical
context. There are photographs, a timeline and filmmaking equipment.
An early 18th century encyclopedia of the Danube region, compiled by
an Italian nobleman, Count Luigi Ferdinando Marsili, provides
historic maps and drawings of flora and fauna.</TE>
<TE>   Working feverishly with technicians to finish the installation,
Forgacs calls his work "music of images," rather like thematic
variations in a musical score. Viewers create their own compositions
by selecting particular parts of the story and putting them in the
order they prefer. They also add personal meanings to the piece by
viewing it in terms of their own memories and experiences, he says.</TE>
<TE>   For Kinder, the project is one more indication that Labyrinth has
grown beyond her original vision. "When we started, we thought we
were making electronic fictions," she says. "But along the way we
discovered that we are making interactive documentaries." Some of
them are personal memoirs; others, like "The Danube Exodus," are
"archeological explorations of a particular place through layers of
time," she says. But just as Forgacs' work deals with far more than a
river, each genre inevitably incorporates aspects of the other.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Pearl Jam is finishing mixing and mastering its next album and will
be gearing up for the scheduled Nov. 19 release.</LD>
<LD>   At the same time, the band, or at least its management, has been
engaged in another kind of activity--looking for a new contract.</LD>
<LD>   The new album will be the last under the Seattle band's current
deal with Epic Records and the group has been exploring what kind of
deal might be available from other companies.</LD>
<TE>   So what are Eddie Vedder and company worth these days?</TE>
<TE>   That depends, say most label executives contacted by Pop Eye. Some
of them have met with band manager Kelly Curtis, who did not return a
call for comment, as well as others who plan to meet with him.</TE>
<TE>   The biggest questions have to do with the band's intent. Several
prominent A&amp;R executives, who asked that their names not be used
because it could affect their potential dealings with Pearl Jam,
pointed to the band's well-known aversion to the pop spotlight--no
videos, few interviews and so on.</TE>
<TE>   This, they say, is a band that could be as big as U2 but has
chosen not to be, as reflected in sales of its last few albums. The
most recent, 2000's "Binaural," sold about 700,000 in the
U.S.--healthy but shy of mega-star, or mega-contract, status.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the band has recorded solid sales from its unprecedented
2000 and 2001 release of more than 40 complete concert recordings,
each of which has sold between 25,000 and 30,000 copies for a total
topping more than a million worldwide.</TE>
<TE>   That bespeaks the kind of rabid fan base that cannot be
discounted.</TE>
<TE>   "They would have to demonstrate that they're willing to do the
work that Bruce Springsteen and U2 are willing to do," one executive
says. "It's hard to find groups that have the magic that they do, and
if they wanted that [stature], it would be like the MasterCard
commercials--they would be priceless."</TE>
<TE>   Numerous references were made to R.E.M.'s 1996 contract with
Warner Bros. that was worth an estimated $80 million, which many
believe did not pay off for the company. Especially with the shaky
state of the music business today, the consensus is that the same
kind of deal is not out there waiting for Pearl Jam.</TE>
<TE>   Three scenarios are deemed most likely:</TE>
<TE>   * The band stays with Epic. The fact that Epic retains Pearl Jam's
valuable catalog gives both the band and the company extra incentive
to continue working together.</TE>
<TE>   * Pearl Jam goes to DreamWorks Records to rejoin executive Michael
Goldstone, who originally signed the band at Epic and supervised its
biggest hits.</TE>
<TE>   * Pearl Jam goes independent. The most intriguing option is
supported by several A&amp;R executives, but although many have discussed
this route, no act at its level has ever done so.</TE>
<TE>   "This would be the perfect band to go indie," one executive says.
"They could do a direct deal where they could get $7 an album and
still sell half a million with even minimal promotion. If I were
them, that's what I'd do. I don't know that a major label adds value
for them."</TE>
<TE>   NONE THE SOONER: Nashville band Sixpence None the Richer has been
mighty quiet since its song "Kiss Me" was the most played on U.S.
radio in 1999. Rather than quickly follow up the 1997 album
containing that hit and build on its momentum, the group has waited
to release a new set, "Divine Discontent," due Oct. 29.</TE>
<TE>   Don't blame the band. It finished the album in 2000 and was ready
to release it that fall. But the small label it was on, Squint, was
sold and became tied up in legal questions. Only now is the band in
the clear, with Reprise Records as its new home.</TE>
<TE>   "It was nice to have a little break, but not 2 1/2 years," singer
Leigh Nash says.</TE>
<TE>   The group didn't just let the album sit during the forced layoff,
though.</TE>
<TE>   Once the legal issues were settled a couple of months ago, the
quintet returned to the studio and recorded four new songs to replace
others that, Leigh says, had "grown old to us." The new songs address
some of the emotions encountered while in limbo.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a new song called 'Tonight' which, when I sing it, it
reminds me of the feeling of throwing your hands up and saying, 'What
are we supposed to do?' " she says. "It's a feeling like you have no
control over your future or present."</TE>
<TE>   BE-JEWELED: Jewel will take a break from touring amphitheaters
with her band for a Sept. 27 acoustic show at the relatively intimate
Broward Center for the Performing Arts in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. The
show is sponsored by Acura, and tickets will be given away by radio
stations to their listeners in the Southeast and by the car company
to customers it has designated VIPs.</TE>
<TE>   Spun off from other Honda- and Acura-sponsored tours (with Brian
Wilson, Paul Simon, Santana, Blink-182 and Incubus among the
headliners), the event may be the start of a series of similar events
around the country.</TE>
<TE>   The concept is similar to the Miller Brewing Co.-sponsored Blind
Date shows, but this time the artist will be promoted and not kept a
mystery, says Rob Tonkin, president and CEO of Venice-based Marketing
Factory, which put the show together.</TE>
<TE>   "We've talked about doing different artists in different parts of
the country," he says. "This could be something that also works for
developing acts in residencies. MTV is doing something called the
$2Billseries of shows. There's no reason a corporation couldn't do
the same thing. And my view is there's no reason why artists won't
participate, as long as it's not too overt and not going to be
perceived as the artists selling themselves to the corporate devil,
so to speak."</TE>
<TE>   SMALL FACES: Trent Reznor and Zack de la Rocha have begun working
together on tracks intended for De la Rocha's first solo album since
leaving Rage Against the Machine. The sessions are taking place at
Reznor's New Orleans studio. Dan the Automator, DJ Shadow and the
Roots' ?uestlove are among the producers who have collaborated on
tracks. No release date has been set....</TE>
<TE>   Brian Setzer and his orchestra have recorded "Boogie Woogie
Christmas," due Oct. 8 on Surfdog Records. The album features Setzer
and Ann-Margret in a duet on "Baby, It's Cold Outside," and a version
of "Blue Christmas" with Setzer providing all five harmony background
voices under the guise of the Briannaires....</TE>
<TE>   A collection of 97 musicians, 74 singers and 68 songwriters all
connected to the famed Muscle Shoals, Ala., soul scene have teamed
for "One Voice," a two-CD set of new songs to benefit the New York
Police &amp; Fire Widows' &amp; Children's Benefit Fund and the Todd Beamer
Foundation, formed by the family of a passenger on Flight 93 last
Sept. 11. The project was produced by singer-songwriter Tonya Holly,
and organized by her and husband Kelvin, who was once Little
Richard's lead guitarist. One song, "The Day," also features a chorus
of more than 1,000 people, including many firefighters and police
officers. The album is due Sept. 3.</TE>

<LD>   Louis Faurer, who died last year at the age of 84, was considered
a seminal member of the New York School of postwar photography. His
gritty images of New York City often focused on ordinary people, and
combined documentary impulse with fine art. A traveling retrospective
opening today at the Museum of Photographic Arts in San Diego
highlights his work through 137 photographs taken between the 1930s
and 1960s.</LD>
<LD>   Dance</LD>
<TE>   Some of our most daring dance-makers collaborate with video
artists in "Caught Between: Dancing for Camera and Live Audience" on
Saturday and next Sunday at the Ivar Theatre in Hollywood.
Participating choreographers include Stephanie Gilliland, Rosanna
Gamson, Kitty McNamee, Jamie Nichols, Lauren Winslow-Kearns, Nina
Kaufman, Alex Magno, Nina Winthrop and Deborah Brockus, the producer
of this unusual multidisciplinary event.</TE>
<TE>   Jazz</TE>
<TE>   Ever since Diana Krall, below, scored two million-selling CDs,
record companies have been tripping over themselves promoting female
jazz singers--newcomers such as Jane Monheit, Norah Jones, Rene
Marie, Lizz Wright and Paula West, to name a few, in addition to
veterans Dianne Reeves, Cassandra Wilson, Karrin Allyson and Nnenna
Freelon. Southland jazz fans can appreciate what all the fuss is
about when Krall performs Saturday at the Santa Barbara Bowl.</TE>
<TE>   Music</TE>
<TE>   It's a big chamber music week at the John Anson Ford Amphitheatre
in Hollywood. On Monday night, Esa-Pekka Salonen brings an ensemble
from SummerFest La Jolla 2002 to repeat a Salonen-Stravinsky program.
On Wednesday, the New Hollywood String Quartet plays music by
Mendelssohn and Ravel, and two world premieres by film composers Don
Davis and Randy Kerber. And Friday, the Ahn Trio performs the U.S.
premiere of Maurice Jarre's "Engadiner Suite," recent works by
Michael Nyman and Kenji Bunch, as well as familiar pieces by Satie
and Haydn.</TE>
<TE>   Theater</TE>
<TE>   The Mark Taper Forum's Other Voices Project will present a free
day of panels and performances featuring artists, scholars and
activists from the disability and deaf theater communities at the El
Portal Center in North Hollywood on Saturday. "Chautauqua 2002--The
Theatrical Landscape of Disability and Deafness: Future, Past and
Present" will include excerpts from classic and contemporary plays
with disabled characters. There will also be a staged reading of
"Evolution Piques," a new play by Elena Minor.</TE>
<TE>   Pop Music</TE>
<TE>   Two of pop's high-profile bare-knuckle combatants find their
orbits bringing them into close proximity this week. Moby's Area2
tour, also featuring David Bowie, Busta Rhymes, Blue Man Group and a
pack of DJs, touches down Tuesday at Verizon Wireless Amphitheater in
Irvine. Meanwhile, Eminem, above, who recently took some criticism
from Moby and fired back with some disses on his new album, stomps
through with Papa Roach, Ludacris, Xzibit and X-ecutioners on the
Anger Management Tour, Thursday at Coors Amphitheatre in San Diego
and Friday at Glen Helen Blockbuster Pavilion in Devore.</TE>
<TE>   Video</TE>
<TE>   Actor Todd Field skillfully directed "In the Bedroom," an

<LD>**** BRIGHT EYES</LD>
<LD>   "Lifted"</LD>
<LD>   Saddle Creek</LD>
<TE>   The new album from indie-rock wunderkind Conor Oberst (due in
stores Tuesday) comes complete with a subtitle, "Or the Story Is in
the Soil, Keep Your Ear to the Ground." Normally, this kind of
thing--not to mention a 73-minute running time and interludes of
dialogue and ambient sound--would be a red flag signaling pretension
and self-indulgence.</TE>
<TE>   But Oberst pulls off everything in this sprawling, bravura work
with ease and command, avoiding the pitfalls that sometimes claimed
artists whom "Lifted" might bring to mind, including Billy Corgan and
Ryan Adams.</TE>
<TE>   Oberst is the star of the increasingly prominent Omaha rock scene,
and "Lifted" reflects a Great Plains mentality in the way it spreads
unimpeded, taking as much time and as many words as it needs to tell
its story. This picaresque journey of discovery through an internal
landscape includes existential contemplations, skeptical
confrontations with theological issues, and insistent testimony on
the ability of music to lead one from the wilderness.</TE>
<TE>   It's told in terms both abstract and down to earth, narrative and
confessional. Whether he's presenting himself as a solo troubadour
singing with face-to-face intimacy or an ambitious orchestrator
crafting environments reminiscent of "Pet Sounds" Beach Boys, early
Cure or Gram Parsons country-rock, Oberst refuses to be ignored.</TE>
<TE>   Oberst, just 20, has already put out one of the year's best
albums, February's "Read Music/Speak Spanish" by his side group,
Desaparecidos. This might be the strongest single-year double punch
since David Bowie released "Low" and "Heroes" in 1977.</TE>
<TE>   --Richard Cromelin</TE>
<TE>   ***  1/2 SLUM VILLAGE</TE>
<TE>   "Trinity: Past, Present and Future"</TE>
<TE>   Capitol/Priority</TE>
<TE>   With its critically lauded major-label debut, 2000's "Fantastic
Vol. 2," Detroit's Slum Village was widely decreed the torchbearer of
progressive hip-hop. This follow-up (in stores Tuesday) reaffirms
that position. Although erstwhile group member and acclaimed producer
Jay Dee contributes only three of the album's 23 tracks, Slum Village
still manages to create the type of pluralistic music that's notably
absent from mainstream hip-hop.</TE>
<TE>   "Trinity" contains mellifluous, R&amp;B-like grooves ("Tainted," "La
La"), mid-tempo ditties ("What Is This"), old-school hip-hop
exuberance ("All-Ta-Ment," "Unisex") and '80s dance music ("Disco"
and "80s Skit," featuring that decade's club staple RJ's Latest
Arrival), not to mention African drums on the hyperactive "Get Live."</TE>
<TE>   The three members' lyrics are just as diverse. T3 posits his
rhymes on hard-core gangsta posturing; Baatin, the thought-provoking
member with a carefree, nasal style, breaks into unintelligible
jabberwocky, and newcomer Elzhi emerges as a rhymer's rhymer
concerned with clever wordplay.</TE>
<TE>   The group manages to bring together these disparate musical and
vocal tendencies, without coming off as forced or contrived, through
the album's unifying theme: love in ethereal and carnal forms, and an
undying disdain for stagnancy in popular music.</TE>
<TE>   --Kris Ex</TE>
<TE>   *** JAMES TAYLOR</TE>
<TE>   "October Road"</TE>
<TE>   Columbia</TE>
<TE>   Had this album shown up a year ago, it would have been a
respectable if not especially scintillating addition to the veteran
singer-songwriter's folk-rock canon. But in this post-Sept. 11 age of
global uncertainty, his music offers a particularly reassuring
emotional salve, much as it did three decades back when he arrived at
the height of the Vietnam War.</TE>
<TE>   The key songs on "October Road" (in stores Tuesday) make a gentle
plea to put basic humanity above politics, a tack that can make a
musician seem naive about the world's grim realities. But Taylor lays
out his message in terms Gandhi himself might have endorsed in
"Belfast to Boston," another take on the kind of questions Bob Dylan
raised in "Blowin' in the Wind." And where his vignettes of family
life might have seemed trivial not so long ago, now they seem
relevant.</TE>
<TE>   Taylor will never be the funkmeister he once again tries to be in
"Raised Up Family," but his exquisitely comforting version of "Have
Yourself a Merry Little Christmas" might even put Scrooge in a
forgiving mood.</TE>
<TE>   --Randy Lewis</TE>
<TE>   In Brief</TE>
<TE>   *** Marianne Faithfull, "Kissin' Time," Virgin/Hut. The veteran
rock chanteuse stays contemporary by collaborating with such modern
popsters as Beck, Billy Corgan and Eurhythmics' Dave Stewart. All
imprint their sonic trademarks, but "Kissin' Time" (in stores
Tuesday) is unquestionably Faithfull's show. Her smoky voice shows
some fissures but proves surprisingly malleable, and the only real
sour note is the maudlin "Song for Nico." She bluntly dissects her
own image on the wry "Sliding Through Life on Charm," while such
tracks as the baroque love song "Like Being Born" and the
Corgan-penned "Wherever I Go" strike compelling notes of passion and
obsession.</TE>
<TE>   --Natalie Nichols</TE>
<TE>   *** Snoop Dogg Presents ... Doggy Style All Stars, "Welcome to Tha
House Vol. 1," Doggy Style/MCA. Snoop Dogg has been involved in more
projects than a municipal housing authority in the last several
years. The Long Beach rapper-actor-entrepreneur's latest endeavor
(due Tuesday), a crushing compilation highlighting the artists on his
fledgling vanity label, hits with an equal balance of gangster funk
and stirring soul. Longtime allies Soopafly, Mr. Kane and Daz display
veteran street-rap polish alongside Snoop, while promising singer
LaToiya Williams emerges as a sultry siren.</TE>
<TE>   --Soren Baker</TE>
<TE>   *** Victoria Williams, "Sings Some Ol' Songs," Dualtone. The
acclaimed songwriter dabbled with a few favorite standards on 2000's
"Water to Drink," and now the singer with the distinctively
high-pitched, whispery voice offers her first collection entirely
composed of material she didn't write. An acquired taste to some, her
vocals have always felt both old-fashioned and timeless, and here
that effect breathes quirky life into such hoary numbers as "Moon
River." Although the sentiments of such songs as "And Roses and
Roses" sound overly quaint, her band's varied, clever musical
treatments keep things from sounding mawkish or dated.</TE>
<TE>   --N.N.</TE>
<TE>   *** 1/2 Eliades Ochoa, "Estoy Como Nunca," Higher Octave. Ochoa's
third and best solo album finds him liberated from the shadow of his
Buena Vista Social Club past. As a result, we get to enjoy the
troubadour's own, indelible take on the earthy pleasures of
traditional son. Highlights include a wistful, instrumental version
of Lecuona's classic "Siboney," as well as an appropriately bitter
version of "Sus Ojos Se Cerraron," a vintage tango popularized by
Carlos Gardel.</TE>
<TE>   --Ernesto Lechner</TE>
<TE>   ** 1/2 Mary Lee's Corvette, "Blood on the Tracks," Bar/None. If
not on par with Liz Phair's "answer" to the Rolling Stones with her
"Exile in Guyville," New York singer-songwriter Mary Lee Kortes and
her band's complete, largely faithful, live take on Bob Dylan's 1975
album (due Tuesday) offers intriguing spins simply by featuring a
woman's voice. "You're a Big Girl Now," for example, substitutes
tenderness for Dylan's sneer. Only a brief, cartoonish Dylan
imitation by an audience member brought on stage mars an otherwise
worthy exercise.</TE>

<DH>They hope to save Santa Monica Playhouse by investing in
its building. Will they find the funds?</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DON SHIRLEY</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Chris DeCarlo winces at the idea of commercializing his art.</LD>
<LD>   "I don't want to commodify what we're doing," he said. "It's like
having a wonderful date with someone and then exploiting all the
great moments, putting them out there for everyone to see."</LD>
<LD>   Yet that's the position in which he finds himself lately, along
with his wife and professional partner, Evelyn Rudie. They're the pop
and the mom of the L.A. area's longest-running mom-and-pop theater
company, Santa Monica Playhouse, which is fighting for its life.
DeCarlo has to make a public case that his theater is worth rescuing.</LD>
<TE>   DeCarlo and Rudie have run the 40-year-old playhouse and its
educational workshops for 29 years. When they began, downtown Santa
Monica was relatively sleepy. Today, their two adjacent venues, of 88
and 70 seats, are a block east of Third Street Promenade--now a
high-rent commercial district.</TE>
<TE>   If the playhouse can't come up with enough money to buy a 49%
interest in its building by July 31, 2003, rising rent will make it
impossible for the company to stay there, say DeCarlo and Rudie. And
if they don't stay there, they predict that their chances of moving
elsewhere are slim.</TE>
<TE>   The goal of the campaign is $500,000--which includes some money
for restoration, in addition to an estimated down payment of $400,000
(the exact purchase price has yet to be negotiated, depending on
market conditions at sale time).</TE>
<TE>   The company has an agreement with landlord Jules Kievitz, who said
he is not offering part-ownership of the building to anyone else, and
that eventually the deal may expand to full ownership for the theater
company. However, he did require the playhouse to raise the first
$100,000 toward the sale by the end of last month--or else the deal
was off and higher rents would follow. That goal was reached two days
ahead of schedule.</TE>
<TE>   The Santa Monica City Council authorized a "double-matching" grant
of $75,000. But that money isn't available until the playhouse raises
$150,000 (double the grant amount)--and the $150,000 has to be an
additional sum beyond the $70,000 that had been raised when the
council voted June 18 to help.</TE>
<TE>   Even though the city money isn't available yet, DeCarlo and Rudie
hope it will serve as an official endorsement that will help them
obtain other funding.</TE>
<TE>   That city approval is primarily because of the playhouse's
educational programs, which include classes and workshops in acting
and backstage crafts for participants ranging from preschoolers to
adults, plus a touring Young Professionals' Company that visits
schools.</TE>
<TE>   City Councilman and Mayor Pro Tempore Kevin McKeown, who is the
council's arts specialist, said the playhouse's campaign for the city
money consisted mostly of e-mails from students, their parents and
alumni of the playhouse workshops.</TE>
<TE>   "The playhouse is one of our cultural centers and is particularly
important to the children of our community," said McKeown, who has
never attended a show at the playhouse. "The City Council has, for
the last three years, made education its top priority."</TE>
<TE>   Maria Luisa de Herrera, manager of the city's cultural affairs
division, noted that the playhouse had earlier received several small
grants for its educational programs and is in the third year of a
three-year organizational support grant, not related to education,
that has brought the playhouse $6,500 a year. She said she had
attended a couple of playhouse shows.</TE>
<TE>   The playhouse has produced a number of long-running hits over the
years, many of which focused on beloved Jewish cultural figures such
as Yiddish-language writer Sholom Aleichem ("Author! Author!") and
Yiddish theater actress Molly Picon ("Picon Pie"). The light domestic
comedies of Jerry Mayer also enjoyed long runs in recent years,
especially "Aspirin and Elephants" and "Almost Perfect." While hardly
the darlings of the critics, such productions have found loyal
audiences who come from all over L.A., DeCarlo said--only about 30%
of the playhouse mailing list consists of Westside addresses.</TE>
<TE>   They also tend to draw relatively old audiences, so the playhouse
often seems occupied by youngsters attending classes during weekend
days, late afternoons and school breaks, and seniors attending shows
on weekend evenings.</TE>
<TE>   Educational programs provided more of the playhouse's total
revenue (44%) than the box office (32%) in the 2000-01 fiscal year
(the last for which figures are available). Rentals to other
producers furnished another 20%. Donations accounted for 4% of the
budget--an extremely low portion, in comparison with the budgets of
most long-established nonprofits.</TE>
<TE>   DeCarlo hopes and expects the proportion of donated funds to rise
if the playhouse is successful at obtaining part-ownership of its
building; he said funders balk at donating money for high rents.</TE>
<TE>   It's not the most opportune time for a capital campaign, however.
After Sept. 11, the playhouse virtually shut down for a month. When a
previously popular show, "Funny, You Don't Look Like a Grandmother,"
finally reopened, it did poorly and soon closed.</TE>
<TE>   Workshop enrollments and rentals to other producers have also
fallen by about 30% from last year's levels. The playhouse's overall
operating budget has dropped from more than $500,000 in the previous
year to about $350,000. DeCarlo cites the economy and decreased
tourism in Santa Monica as factors.</TE>
<TE>   DeCarlo, 55, spent most of his formative years in Santa Monica,
and first produced a show at the playhouse in 1965, when he was 18,
transferring it there after an initial run in the Melrose district.
It was not a success. But DeCarlo began attending classes at the
playhouse, which was then run by Ted Roter, and appearing in
productions there--including one long-forgotten play ("Closet
Casanova") in which he appeared in the nude. His studies were
interrupted by the draft in 1967, and he was sent to Vietnam.</TE>
<TE>   Before Vietnam, DeCarlo had many of the usual Hollywood ambitions,
"but that trauma took me out of the idea that I wanted to be a
Hollywood star," he said. "It gave me the idea that I wanted to use
theater to help others discover their own humanity."</TE>
<TE>   After he returned, he met Rudie at a Monday-evening workshop at
the playhouse. The granddaughter of Rudolf Bernauer, who co-wrote the
librettos for the Viennese operettas that were turned into "The
Chocolate Soldier" and "Maytime," and the daughter of Emery Bernauer,
who wrote revues during World War II, Rudie--although two years
younger than DeCarlo--had already experienced her share of Hollywood.
She had been selected at age 6 to play the role of Eloise in a live
"Playhouse 90" special, for which she received an Emmy nomination.
She then spent much of her youth in TV guest appearances and movies.</TE>
<TE>   The couple married in 1970 and took over the playhouse three years
later, where they now estimate that they have each appeared on stage
for more than 6,000 performances. For the first 11 years, they worked
solely with members of their own company, and any new plays presented
at the playhouse were written by company members. In 1984, however,
they began opening the facilities to rentals and co-productions,
beginning with the successful U.S. premiere of the Australian play
"The Coming of Stork."</TE>
<TE>   Until 1996, the playhouse consisted only of one auditorium, which
in a 1980 renovation grew from 76 to 88 seats. As part of that
project, a second floor was added to the building, providing more
space for offices, storage and classes. In 1996, what is called the
Other Space was carved out of the building, designed with a more
steeply raked audience area and a higher ceiling, in contrast to the
almost living room-like ambience of the larger space.</TE>
<TE>   The only other theater company near Third Street Promenade, City
Garage, is very different in philosophy, usually presenting new and
thorny European dramas.  Asked to characterize Santa Monica
Playhouse's programming, City Garage managing director Charles
Duncombe called it "very mainstream." Andrew Barrett-Weiss of the
Powerhouse, another sub-100-seat company in Santa Monica, called the
playhouse "AM radio--they serve a need for good old-fashioned
entertainment."</TE>
<TE>   Both of the theater leaders applauded the playhouse's ability to
obtain city funds. City Garage received a $1,500 grant from the city,
but was rejected for further city funding twice and finally stopped
applying, Duncombe said. He said he wishes city funders "also thought
alternative work was interesting, but I recognize that from a
political point of view, government money is supposed to reflect the
broader taste of the citizenry."</TE>
<TE>   In response, DeCarlo acknowledged that the playhouse is more
mainstream than other Santa Monica theaters, "but compared to
commercial theaters, we're on the fringe"--especially in terms of
staging styles. In terms of content, he said, "We want to be
entertaining, because we want access to the people who need to hear
what we're saying." He's afraid that shock value often intrudes on
accessibility, but added, "What I think is accessible may seem tame
and square to somebody else."</TE>
<TE>   DeCarlo said the company has determined not "to run shows to
death, which sometimes meant that audiences burned out" in the
earlier years, and to look for more varied plays and perspectives.</TE>
<TE>   Don't count on the couple to look for a new space, however, if
they should lose their old one. "We'd be starting from zero," DeCarlo
said. He and Rudie are clearly enamored of the intimacy of the
playhouse, which DeCarlo called their "caldron."</TE>
<TE>   "If it's not on a human scale," he said, "I don't want to do it."</TE>

<LD>The current jazz view suggests that singing by male artists is in a
serious state of decline. Listening to the tepid work that is being
produced by some of the better-known performers, I think it's an
understandable opinion.</LD>
<LD>   But the real problem has more to do with visibility, marketing and
sales figures than it does with a paucity of talent. It takes a
certain amount of searching, and a willingness to check out
unfamiliar names, but a reasonable amount of effort produces some
fascinating music by male singers--most of it being made around the
obscure fringes of jazz. Let's start with a couple of names that will
probably not be familiar--at least not yet.</LD>
<LD>   Darius de Haas, "Day Dream: Variations on Strayhorn" (*** 1/2, PS
Classics). The name may not ring a bell, but De Haas is well-known in
musical theater circles, through performances on Broadway in "Marie
Christine" and the concert version of "Dreamgirls," and off-Broadway
in his Obie Award-winning performance in "Running Man." More than a
year ago, he put together a concert collection of Billy Strayhorn
tunes that was greeted with rave reviews. "Day Dream" is the
follow-up studio recording.</LD>
<TE>   There are a lot of things to like: first, the fundamental fact
that a collection of Strayhorn's marvelous songs has been put
together; second, that some of the tunes have never before been
recorded, including new lyrics by Elvis Costello for the classic
"Blood Count," here retitled "My Flame Burns Blue"; and third, that
De Haas digs into this material with enormous creativity and
imagination.</TE>
<TE>   De Haas' interpretations are driven by an astonishingly versatile
voice. Switching his intense vibrato on and off at will, soaring up
into piercing head tones, dropping into deeper chest sounds, De Haas
applies this rich vocabulary of sounds to the job of telling
Strayhorn's compelling musical stories. In the tune that is the
obvious touchstone for the Strayhorn catalog, "Lush Life," he
captures the dark angst of the lyrics, initially in a stunning rubato
duet with saxophonist Roy Nathanson, later in a kind of intimate,
passionate conversation with his accompanying ensemble. It's a
remarkable performance, and only one of many in this
not-to-be-overlooked album.</TE>
<TE>   Gino Sitson, "Song Zin'..." (*** 1/2, Piranha). Sitson comes from
West Cameroon, although he lived in Paris from the age of 17, moving
to New York in 2001. The name that immediately comes to mind when
hearing his opening song is Bobby McFerrin. Like McFerrin, Sitson is
a creator of vocal panoramas, overdubbing his voice, spinning out
crisply articulate melody lines over body-moving rhythms (frequently
using offbeat meters).</TE>
<TE>   All the pieces are original, mostly sung in Sitson's native
Medumba language, but his gift for melody and his persuasive powers
of interpretation establish an instant connection for listeners in
virtually every number. In his liner notes, Sitson refuses to define
his music, simply saying, "I don't feel I belong to any style." He's
right, but despite the great variety of sounds and rhythms present in
the album, his creative vision is clear enough to bring a sense of
solidarity to the tracks.</TE>
<TE>   The unifying element is Sitson's vocal arsenal of yodels,
falsetto, glissandos, growls and grunts, sometimes placed in an
African context, sometimes over pure jazz backing, always
fascinating. This is an album filled with surprises that rewards
repeated listening.</TE>
<TE>   Curtis Stigers, "Secret Heart" (***, Concord Records). Stigers
continues to distance himself from his pop career of the late '80s
and early '90s, when his "I Wonder Why" was a Top 10 hit, selling
nearly 2 million albums. Since then, he has become positioned as a
mainstream jazz artist who has worked hard to expand his repertoire
without departing from the solid groove of straight-ahead swing.</TE>
<TE>   The way he transforms Steve Earle's "Hometown Blues" is an
impressive example; so, too, in a far different fashion, are his
sensitive reading of "My Foolish Heart," his crisp phrasing on a
brightly swinging "You're Driving Me Crazy," and an up-tempo "You'd
Be So Nice to Come Home to" (in which his background as a sax player
is reflected in driving and imaginative scat singing). There are, in
addition, a pair of sweetly insightful versions of very different
ballads--Randy Newman's "It's So Hard Living Without You" and the
Johnny Green classic "Body and Soul"--all backed with great
understanding by the rhythm section of pianist Larry Goldings,
bassist John Clayton and drummer Jeff Hamilton.</TE>
<TE>   Kenny Rankin, "A Song for You" (***, Verve Records). Rankin is
hardly obscure, of course, but he has always been a perplexing artist
to categorize. Like Michael Franks in sound and style, he similarly
has had difficulty in convincing hard-core jazz enthusiasts of the
credibility of his gently rhythmic interpretations. But when Rankin
is heard within the perspective of his own vision--which primarily
has to do with melodic variation and alteration rather than scat
singing or in-the-pocket swinging--the impact of his performances
becomes clear.</TE>
<TE>   On this warm, engaging outing, his first for Verve, he has
concentrated largely on ballads with an eclectic program embracing
everything from Thelonious Monk's " 'Round Midnight" and Lennon &amp;
McCartney's "I've Just Seen a Face" to the Gershwins' "Love Walked
In" and Leon Russell's title track. Rankin's touching rendering of
the latter and his unusual version of " 'Round Midnight" are
especially potent examples of his ability to subtly transform a
melody, recasting it without losing touch with its original shape.
The album is further enhanced by the presence of saxophonist Chris
Potter and guitarist Russell Malone on several tracks.</TE>
<TE>   Al Jarreau, "All I Got" (***, Verve Records). Jarreau is an
authentic jazz talent, one whose legitimacy has never faltered,
regardless of his occasional forays into pop and R&amp;B.</TE>
<TE>   This time out (the album won't be released until mid-September),
Jarreau seems to be determinedly following in the path of his 2000
album (and debut on GRP/Verve), "Tomorrow Today." As with that CD,
most of the tracks stand a good chance of surfacing in the various
urban radio formats, but they don't offer Jarreau much opportunity to
display his envelope-stretching vocal abilities in a pure jazz
setting. Still, Jarreau has successfully accomplished what he
obviously set out to do--make a musically marketable album.</TE>
<TE>   That said, however, there is one fascinating, beyond-category
track, "Lost and Found," in which Jarreau duets intriguingly with Joe
Cocker. The closing two numbers--the original "Jacaranda
Bougainvillea" and, especially, the Bobby Troup standard "Route
66"--at least have the benefit of placing Jarreau in more felicitous
musical settings.</TE>
<TE>   The latter, featuring overdubbed vocal bass and finger snaps,
vividly portrays how easily Jarreau could top the male jazz vocal
category should he ever decide, once again, to do so.</TE>

<LD>At the premiere of John Adams' "Naive and Sentimental Music" in 1999,
it was clear to many in the cheering audience at the Dorothy Chandler
Pavilion that the Los Angeles Philharmonic had commissioned a
masterpiece and that Esa-Pekka Salonen and the orchestra had done it
justice. Adams' most ambitious symphonic work to date, this 45-minute
score begged to be heard again and again. Nonesuch quickly arranged
for studio time and made a recording, and I wish I had a dollar for
every time someone has asked me, or I've queried Nonesuch, about a
release date.</LD>
<LD>   In the age of Internet instant gratification, three years is a
very long time. It's even a bit long by the snail-mail gait of
classical record companies (Nonesuch bumped the release a couple of
times, issuing other Adams' discs--"Century Rolls" and "El Nino").
But it is heartening that a company can so believe in a work's
prospects that it feels no pressure to exploit its newness, that it
paces the release of a composer's major works to give us time to
fully absorb them.</LD>
<LD>   It is also heartening that important new pieces do get made and
recorded. Some of the most significant new music heard this season
and in recent seasons by the Philharmonic and the California EAR Unit
are now available. Happily for Angelenos, they heard it here first.</LD>
<TE>   **** JOHN ADAMS</TE>
<TE>   "Naive and Sentimental Music"</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles Philharmonic,</TE>
<TE>   Esa-Pekka Salonen, conductor</TE>
<TE>   Nonesuch</TE>
<TE>   The title has a highfalutin source--a 1795 essay by the Romantic
German poet Heinrich Schiller--and an excellent CD booklet note by
composer Ingram Marshall investigates why Adams didn't just call this
work a symphony and be done with it. But forget the title for a
moment, and what you have is no less than a great American symphony
in three movements.</TE>
<TE>   Grand in scope, inspiring in ambition, thrilling in execution, it
suggests momentous metaphors. Nonesuch chose photographs of the
Sierra and redwoods in its atmospheric packaging. Marshall writes
about an epic journey.</TE>
<TE>   "Naive and Sentimental Music" does not, in fact, follow the
traditional symphonic procedure of dramatically working through
contrasts and conflict to find resolution.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, an innocent tune takes a trip and gets a life, naive and
sentimental being, for Adams, preconditions of profundity and even
enlightenment.</TE>
<TE>   In the first movement, a pop-like song takes off and just keeps
going, the road twisting and turning, a new experience around every
corner. The gorgeous solo guitar melody (elegantly played by David
Tanenbaum) that haunts the central slow movement, "Mother of Man,"
has the potential to turn saccharine but chooses a more serious and
sustaining path. The last movement, "Chain to the Rhythm," is the
hair-raising symphonic ride of your life.</TE>
<TE>   The extraordinary command of this rich score that Salonen and the
L.A. Philharmonic demonstrated at the premiere is captured in all its
glory by Nonesuch.</TE>
<TE>   **** OSVALDO GOLIJOV</TE>
<TE>   "Yiddishbbuk"</TE>
<TE>   Todd Palmer, clarinet;</TE>
<TE>   St. Lawrence String Quartet</TE>
<TE>   EMI</TE>
<TE>   Everyone is talking about Osvaldo Golijov. He is unquestionably
the hottest new voice on the scene, and his "St. Mark" Passion, which
will find its way to the Eclectic Orange Festival in the fall,
positively sizzles. (A live recording of its premiere is available
from Hanssler, and a studio recording is in the works from Nonesuch.)
Golijov, who is from Argentina, is also featured on the Kronos'
exceptional recent CD, "Nuevo." But the most substantial overview of
Golijov thus far is this marvelous new disc by the St. Lawrence
String Quartet, which includes several pieces that were performed by
the Philharmonic or ensembles of its players last season when Golijov
was in residence here.</TE>
<TE>   The highlight is "The Dreams and Prayers of Isaac the Blind," for
klezmer clarinet and string quartet. There is an excellent recording
by the Kronos Quartet and David Krakauer, but this is music so
personal and of such personality as it moves from cabalistic mystery
to earthy ecstasy that it takes on new qualities with new performers.
The Kronos emphasized its beguiling strangeness; the St. Lawrence is
after sheer passion, enhanced by Todd Palmer's virtuosity.</TE>
<TE>   The St. Lawrence is joined by the Ying Quartet and bassist Mark
Dresser for "Last Round," a winning tribute to new tango (the
Philharmonic performed a string orchestra version). "Lullaby and
Doina" is haunting music adapted from Golijov's score to Sally
Potter's film "The Man Who Cried." The 10-year-old "Yiddishbbuk," the
earliest work on this disc, contains short, emotional, harder-edged
commemorations of children interned in the Terezin concentration
camp, Yiddish writer I.B.Singer and Leonard Bernstein. All
performances are gripping. If you want to know what all the fuss over
Golijov is about, here is an excellent one-stop place to find out.</TE>
<TE>   ***  1/2 MAGNUS LINDBERG</TE>
<TE>   "Cantigas," Cello Concerto,</TE>
<TE>   "Parada," "Fresco"</TE>
<TE>   Anssi Karttunen, cello;</TE>
<TE>   Philharmonia,</TE>
<TE>   Esa-Pekka Salonen, conductor</TE>
<TE>   Sony Classical</TE>
<TE>   As Esa-Pekka Salonen's countryman, school chum and closest musical
friend, Magnus Lindberg is a familiar figure in Los Angeles. Last
season, Salonen led a festival of Lindberg's works in London and
toured Europe with them. When Leon Kirchner did not finish his violin
concerto in time for its scheduled premiere by the Los Angeles
Philharmonic in March, Salonen substituted two recent Lindbergscores,
the Cello Concerto and "Parada."</TE>
<TE>   This new CD, which contains first recordings of both pieces, comes
from the London festival. It also includes the first recording of
"Fresco," which was a Los Angeles Philharmonic commission in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   Lindberg's music may not be quite so immediately accessible as
Adams' or Golijov's, but it is so sonically strong and so full of
gritty invention it manages to make a big first impression. The Cello
Concerto is the standout, in part for the unbelievably facile finger
work of Anssi Karttunen. But given a chance, all of Lindberg's music
grows on a listener. Its harmonic richness draws you deeper and
deeper into a sound world that might be likened to a cave that at
first seems dark and foreboding, but soon starts to sparkle with
unimagined colors and textures.</TE>
<TE>   I find a greater beauty in the Los Angeles Philharmonic's playing,
but Salonen gets the Philharmonia to sound very good here, and the
recording does an impressive job in capturing the sonic breadth of
this music.</TE>
<TE>   *** "Go"</TE>
<TE>   California EAR Unit</TE>
<TE>   Echograph</TE>
<TE>   ***KITTY BRAZELTON</TE>
<TE>   "Chamber Music</TE>
<TE>   for the Inner Ear"</TE>
<TE>   California EAR Unit and others</TE>
<TE>   CRI</TE>
<TE>   Indefatigable and unpredictable, the California EAR Unit surprises
season after season in its series at the Los Angeles County Museum of
Art, as well as at other appearances here and there. Little of this
is documented by recording engineers. Granted, many of its
performances have an admirably ephemeral nature--as music to be
experienced in the moment--but occasionally something is worth living
with. With this new disc, self-produced for a tiny, independent label
in Santa Monica, the EAR Unit has given posterity a helping hand with
five works that have proved to have lasting value.</TE>
<TE>   The biggest news about the release is that it contains the first
recording of John Adams' "Road Movies," which was given its world
premiere by EAR Unit violinist Robin Lorenz and pianist Vicki Ray
seven years ago. Although not a major work (Adams is a reluctant
composer of chamber music), the three-movement Minimalist violin
sonata has lately been catching on--Leila Josefowicz played it last
weekend at the opening concert of the SummerFest in La Jolla;
Nonesuch has a recording of it by Gidon Kremer and Grant Gershon in
the can--and this hard-edged, dynamic performance is a good
indication of why.</TE>
<TE>   But everything else on the disc is of interest as well. There are
two EAR Unit favorites. Frederic Rzewski's intense "Coming Together"
(1971), with its spoken text taken from a prisoner's account of the
Attica uprising, is still a striking and relevant musical polemic.
John Bergamo's "Foreign Objects" is happy-go-lucky percussion music
from 1984 that always brings the house down.</TE>
<TE>   Julia Wolfe's stunning, disturbing "Girlfriend," written for the
EAR Unit in 1998, is the largest work on the CD, with environmental
crunching and crashing sounds upsetting the balance of the
atmospheric, lyrical instrumental writing for the six-member
ensemble. James Sellars' "Go," for which the album is titled, is
quirky, jerky, sharp-witted music on the go.</TE>
<TE>   The EAR Unit also makes an appearance on the first CD devoted to
the brainy, boisterous and quintessentially downtown Kitty Brazelton,
with her  "Sonata for the Inner Ear," which received its first
performance at LACMA in 1999. A composer equally fond of punk,
plainchant and bebop, she has had one sort of pop band or another
(such as the art-rock Dadadah) for the past two decades, but she also
knows her compositional way around the music academy. "Sonata for the
Inner Ear" is an actual sonata with plenty of attitude. It starts
with an insinuating flute tune that bops around before exploding. A
central movement includes improvisation and samples from EAR Unit
outtakes over the years. You never know where this piece will go
next, yet it all feels organic.</TE>
<TE>   The other works on the disc--including looming and talkative jazz
brass, goofy song and menacing dark electronics--fill in a portrait
of an original, compelling voice.</TE>

<LD>Many experts' predictions about the U.S. economy are gloomier than
usual, some comparing the post-boom struggles of the economy and
stock market to Japan's in the 1990s, when that nation suffered
repeated recessions and a horrifying drop in prices for homes and
other assets.</LD>
<LD>   Although the pessimism is overblown, the uncomfortable comparison
should not be dismissed. Japan's stock market began a decline in 1989
that has erased almost 75% of its value. But the full horrors of
falling prices and economic stagnation emerged gradually over several
years and is felt today.</LD>
<LD>   In the U.S., stock markets have steadily declined since 2000,
prices for most commodities have fallen for the last year and the
economy seems unable to mount a strong recovery. Also, home prices
have risen so rapidly that many experts warn of a housing "bubble."</LD>
<TE>   Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan will be urged this
week to lower the federal funds rate from its current 40-year low of
1.75%. Some might recall that Japan's central bank lowered interest
rates in the '90s to near zero, but couldn't revive that once-mighty
economy.</TE>
<TE>   Yet the parallels, however interesting, are inexact and do not
give the full picture. The U.S. economy is far less vulnerable, more
flexible and inherently stronger than Japan's. And U.S. housing
markets are not in a bubble, although feverish home sales and the
rapid escalation in prices are due to slow down in many parts of the
country.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, a good way to understand the strengths, weaknesses and
true prospects for the U.S. economy is to examine in what ways it
operates differently from Japan and most other countries.</TE>
<TE>   At its best, the economy faces up to difficulties. This year--and
probably next--the economy is working off the excesses of the late
1990s boom in telecommunications and high tech. And it is doing so
with the same dispatch that the savings-and-loan crisis was dealt
with a dozen years ago--through bankruptcies, write-offs and sales of
assets. That's disruptive and painful for workers who lose jobs and
for investors who lose money, but the economy moves on.</TE>
<TE>   Japan, by contrast, was unwilling for years to endure the
hardships of bankruptcies and still has not been able to fully work
off the excesses of its late 1980s real estate and investment boom.</TE>
<TE>   Undeniably, there are risks in the U.S. economy right now.</TE>
<TE>   "A major concern is that business can't raise capital," says Mark
Kiesel, portfolio manager for high-grade corporate debt at Pacific
Investment Management Co., or Pimco, a Newport Beach-based investment
firm. Suspicious of companies' inability to increase sales and
earnings, and of corporate accounting, banks have cut back on
lending. Bond and commercial paper markets are discouraging to most
firms, and stock markets are not receptive to new financings. Of
course, in a slow economy, just about the only firms wanting to
borrow are the weak and desperate.</TE>
<TE>   Yet that spells opportunity for venturesome investors with
capital. Warren Buffett, through his holding company Berkshire
Hathaway Inc., since March has invested $2.5 billion in buying two
natural gas pipelines and backing a fiber-optics telecom firm.</TE>
<TE>   Analysts credit Buffett with shrewdly buying long-term value at
low prices.</TE>
<TE>   "There should be more private equity investments like that. They
get the economy moving," Kiesel says.</TE>
<TE>   Investors have to take a long-term view because a threat of
falling prices or deflation is hanging over the economy. The index of
wholesale, or producer, prices released Thursday showed that, food
and energy aside, prices for all goods produced by industry have
fallen each month since October. That is not good news. Deflation
discourages firms from investing in new products, hurts their ability
to make a profit and, by extension, hurts their stock prices.</TE>
<TE>   If deflation were to hold in the U.S. as it did in Japan in the
'90s, the U.S. economy would be in severe trouble. But that is where
U.S. policy contrasts most significantly with Japan's, says economist
John Vail, investment strategist for Mizuho Securities-- the
investment arm of giant Mizuho Financial Group, which resulted from
the combination of three major institutions: Fuji Bank, Dai-Ichi
Kangyo Bank and the Industrial Bank of Japan.</TE>
<TE>   "Greenspan has kept interest rates low to support housing, where
in Japan in the early 1990s, Bank of Japan Governor [Yasushi] Mieno
raised interest rates to pierce their real estate bubble," Vail says.</TE>
<TE>   The effects of curbing real estate speculation, and many other
factors, hobble Japan's economy to this day.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, low mortgage interest rates have made housing the
strongest sector of the U.S. economy and have launched a wave of
mortgage refinancings that have put money in consumers' pockets and
supported sales of home furnishings, appliances and other consumer
goods.</TE>
<TE>   The worry is that housing markets are too strong, with home prices
nationally rising more than 10% in June.</TE>
<TE>   "I find it curious that prices are going up even here in the Bay
Area, where there aren't any jobs being created," says economist
Cynthia Kroll of UC Berkeley's Fisher Center for Real Estate.</TE>
<TE>   Yet talk of a housing bubble is incorrect, says economist Raphael
Bostic of USC's Lusk Center for Real Estate Research.</TE>
<TE>   "Bubbles occur when supply of houses greatly exceeds demand, but
we have a housing shortage in Southern California and great demand
for homes," Bostic says. Across the country, too, there are few areas
of housing oversupply.</TE>
<TE>   Housing prices are likely to moderate soon in most areas of the
U.S. because of relatively slow economic growth and flagging consumer
confidence. But a crash of home prices would be impossible without a
severe new recession. And for all the gloom and uncertainty of
experts and financial markets, that is not the prospect today.</TE>
<TE>   The real outlook is for a U.S. economy working off excesses of the
boom and recovering strength, although how quickly it comes back is a
question.</TE>
<TE>   Economist Stephen Roach of Morgan Stanley looks at falling prices,
some caused by the aftermath of excessive investment in technology in
the late 1990s, and sees the U.S. economy recovering slowly, as it
did in the century before World War II. Back then, Roach points out,
periods of excess took longer to work off and recessions lasted 21
months on average, compared with an average of 11 months since 1945.
He doesn't see a fast "clearing of the decks for the coming recovery,
the next bull market."</TE>
<TE>   In contrast, economist Edward Yardeni of Prudential Securities,
notes that "after the 1990s, U.S. consumers are more prosperous than
they have ever been, and incomes are high." He sees U.S. economic
output expanding 3% in 2002, less rapid than most recovery periods,
but an economy doing much better than Japan's ever did in the 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   Government statistics Friday showed that industrial productivity,
the key to rising living standards, increased 1.1% in the second
quarter, a slower rate of gain than earlier this year or in recent
years.</TE>
<TE>   But productivity gains of 4.7% in the last 12 months--more output
achieved and wages earned without inflation--are greater than the
U.S. economy could muster in the 25 years prior to the late 1990s
boom.</TE>
<TE>   The message is that the boom has left us with new economic
strengths as well as a hangover.</TE>

<HD>401(k) Situation a Chance to Boost Savings for a Home</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LIZ PULLIAM WESTON</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Question: I want to buy a home in the $210,000 price range before the
end of the year. I've saved approximately $30,000 in a money market
account and designated half of it as my emergency fund, with the
other half for a down payment. I'm thinking that because the stock
market is not doing that well, it might make sense to decrease my
401(k) contributions to 1% for the next six months so I can save more
for a home. I should mention that my employer will continue to match
5% of my base salary regardless of whether I contribute the maximum.
The reduction would allow me to have an additional $10,000 or so to
put down on my home. What are the consequences of such an action? I'd
like to have my monthly mortgage payments as low as possible.</LD>
<LD>   Answer: Normally, it makes little sense to reduce a 401(k)
contribution to 1%, because you miss out on the company match. You
also shouldn't make your contribution decision based on current
market conditions. The only conditions that should concern you are
those 30 to 40 years in the future, when you're actually going to
need this money.</LD>
<LD>   You, however, have the rather unusual situation of being able to
eat your cake and have it too.</LD>
<TE>   Because your employer contributes 5% of your salary regardless of
what you contribute, you can scale back temporarily without giving up
what's essentially free money.</TE>
<TE>   Note that word "temporarily." Not taking full advantage of your
401(k) can cost you hundreds of thousands of dollars down the road,
because the money you don't contribute can't earn all those nice
tax-deferred returns over time. You're talking about a six-month
hiatus, however, so the damage you do from not contributing as much
can easily be made up by restoring your contributions to the maximum
once you purchase the house.</TE>
<TE>   Saving a bit more for a down payment also will help you land a
better deal on a mortgage. You can generally qualify for decent rates
once you have a payment equal to at least 10% of the purchase price.
If you can manage to put down 20%, you also can avoid private
mortgage insurance, a cost that can increase the cost of your monthly
payments.</TE>
<TE>   You're smart not to devote all your cash to a down payment, by the
way. Having an emergency fund is especially important when you're a
homeowner and facing sole responsibility for replacing a roof that
may spring leaks, a furnace that dies and plumbing that rebels in the
middle of the night.</TE>
<TE>   You'll also need some cash to cover closing costs once you've
found the home you wish to buy.</TE>
<TE>   Credit Card Deal</TE>
<TE>   May Have Some Traps</TE>
<TE>   Q: I'm considering transferring my $11,000 student loan debt,
which carries an 8.25% interest rate, to one of my credit cards
that's offering a 3.9% balance-transfer deal. The rate is supposed to
last until the transferred debt is paid off, with no other time
limits. I've examined the fine print and the deal seems to have no
strings attached. I can't see any reason I shouldn't exploit this
opportunity. Unless I'm missing something, it seems like more people
should investigate this kind of opportunity while rates are low.</TE>
<TE>   A: There are a few traps here.</TE>
<TE>   The first is that this must be a card you don't use for any other
purpose. As soon as you charge something else to this card, a higher
rate will apply to the purchase. Meanwhile, your payments will be
applied to the lower-rate portion of your balance, which means you
wind up carrying the high-rate balance longer. That's how credit card
companies make money on these deals.</TE>
<TE>   Another pitfall is that your rate will go up if you miss any
payments. Some companies jack up the rate if you're even a few days
late.</TE>
<TE>   You typically will pay a fee for this transaction, usually 2% to
3%. Although that won't offset all the benefits of the lower rate in
your case, such balance-transfer fees are an annoying cost that
should be factored into the equation.</TE>
<TE>   You're also giving up a lot of flexibility. You can generally get
a deferral or forbearance on paying your student loans if you lose
your job or have other financial difficulties. Credit card companies
aren't nearly so accommodating.</TE>
<TE>   You're losing a potential tax deduction as well. Credit card
interest generally is not deductible, but student loan interest of as
much as $2,500 a year can be.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, many people have the opportunity to lock in extremely low
student loan rates right now. If you haven't already consolidated
your federally guaranteed student loans, you can consolidate now and
may get rates of about 4%. People who just graduated and who are in
their six-month grace period can qualify for even lower rates. Most
student lenders have information, or you can check out what's posted

<HD>Firms Divided Over Calculating Cost</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU>Tom Petruno</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>One of the biggest issues companies face in deciding whether to
expense the cost of stock options is that there is no agreement on
how best to calculate that cost.</LD>
<LD>   The ultimate cost of an option, after all, is unknown--it will
depend on how the stock performs in the market and how many options
are exercised by executives and other employees.</LD>
<LD>   Under current accounting standards requiring companies to footnote
in financial statements the estimated cost of their options, the
rules say companies must estimate the fair value of options using the
so-called Black/Scholes method or another acceptable method.</LD>
<TE>   The Black/Scholes method is named for Fischer Black and Myron
Scholes, economists who in 1973 developed a formula for valuing
traded stock options.</TE>
<TE>   Their method incorporates such factors as the historic volatility
of the stock involved, the level of market interest rates and the
expected life of the option.</TE>
<TE>   But some companies don't believe the Black/Scholes method is
necessarily the right valuation method.</TE>
<TE>   General Motors Corp. last week said it would begin expensing
options in 2003, but it pointedly said that "current valuation
methods available for expensing options are not ideal." The company
urged regulators to come up with a standard plan that is "more
accurate."</TE>
<TE>   Billionaire Warren Buffett, who has been pressing corporate
America to expense options, likes Coca-Cola Co.'s approach: Coke
plans to ask Wall Street investment banks to say how much they'd pay
for the company's outstanding options, and use that value in
determining their cost.</TE>
<TE>   Others say that isn't fair. Because employee stock option
contracts aren't tradable, it's unrealistic to ascribe to them a
value (and therefore, a cost) as if they were tradable, some critics
say.</TE>
<TE>   Scholes, in a recent interview with Bloomberg News, said he has
grown tired of people attacking the Black/Scholes method of
estimating option values.</TE>
<TE>   "We never said that the model should be used only as it was
illustrated," he told Bloomberg. "The technology can be used and
modified to take account of changes in vesting or volatility. You
have to adjust things."</TE>

<HD>No Easy Fix for Stock Options Angst</HD>
<DH>Accounting: Some analysts say the push for changes in
expensing the incentives is based on a flawed premise.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES F. PELTZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Amid the controversy about whether companies should treat employee
stock options as a normal cost, only about 50 of the nation's 13,500
publicly traded companies--that's 0.4%--have announced plans to
voluntarily make the switch. And it's by no means certain that the
trickle will become a torrent any time soon.</LD>
<LD>   Standing in the way is the debate raging over the effect the
accounting change might have on the companies' financial results,
their stock prices and their employees. One side contends the effect
will be hugely negative--lowering corporate earnings and paring the
number of options granted to executives and non-management workers.
Others speculate that the effect will be minor.</LD>
<LD>   The whole premise behind expensing options is to further clarify a
company's accounting, make its numbers more transparent to the public
and thereby boost investors' confidence, which has been ravaged by
corporate scandals.</LD>
<TE>   Executives involved in those scandals were often lavished with
options that made them fabulously rich and allegedly prompted the
financial abuses that were aimed at keeping the companies'
profits--and stock prices--as high as possible. So options came under
assault, and now treating them as a cost to be deducted from earnings
is seen as one solution to curbing the abuses.</TE>
<TE>   But some analysts say many investors probably will ignore, or
"back out," the cost when they evaluate a company's stock on grounds
that a company doesn't immediately pay out cash when it grants
options.</TE>
<TE>   Others argue that there are eventual costs. Options increase the
potential number of shares a company has outstanding, which could
lower its earnings per share that Wall Street and other investors
follow so closely. In turn, companies often then spend heavily to buy
back their shares on the open market to offset that dilution.</TE>
<TE>   Expensing options will make companies more cautious about how many
options they issue, some observers say. But others disagree. "At the
end of the day it's going to be a non-event," said David Hilal,
technology research director at investment firm Friedman, Billings,
Ramsey &amp; Co. in Arlington, Va. "I don't think employees need to be
alarmed at the prospect of getting fewer options."</TE>
<TE>   Practices Unchanged</TE>
<TE>   And despite the turmoil surrounding the issue, companies so far
"have not scaled back their use of stock-based compensation" to
motivate employees and attract new talent, according to surveys by
WorldatWork, a trade group in Scottsdale, Ariz., that tracks worker
compensation and benefits.</TE>
<TE>   The debate has "yet to convince a majority of companies to
reconsider how they administer their options plans," the group said.</TE>
<TE>   Even so, the confusion is expected to increase as more companies
deliberate whether to expense their options and while the Financial
Accounting Standards Board--which sets the rules for corporate
accounting and favors expensing options--ponders whether to make the
change mandatory.</TE>
<TE>   Many analysts are hard-pressed to think of another issue in recent
years that has so divided the sharpest minds in corporate America and
on Wall Street.</TE>
<TE>   On one side there are the likes of General Electric Co. and
Coca-Cola Co., two multinational behemoths that plan to expense
options to boost investor confidence in their accounting. On the
other side are Intel Corp., Cisco Systems Inc. and other technology
titans that oppose the switch, claiming it would brutally hurt their
profits.</TE>
<TE>   Others also oppose the idea, including former American Express
Corp. Chairman Harvey Golub, who contends that because options don't
actually cost a company anything initially, there is no reason they
should they be deducted from earnings. Another reason: the confusion
over how the options should be valued.</TE>
<TE>   Methods Will Differ</TE>
<TE>   Analysts say these factors will limit the practice of expensing
options in the immediate future. Investors and employees will be
forced to grapple with different options-accounting methods at
different firms until the change becomes mandatory, or some trigger
prompts most firms to start treating options as a routine expense.</TE>
<TE>   Neither is expected to happen until next year, at the earliest.</TE>
<TE>   Options give holders the right to buy their company's stock in the
future at a set price. The idea is to give employees an incentive to
work harder so the stock's market price climbs higher than the option
price. Then the employee can exercise the option, acquire the shares
and resell them for a profit.</TE>
<TE>   Companies that issued these incentive options have done so without
having to put a precise value on those options and to subtract that
cost from their profits. However, under a 1995 ruling by FASB (known
as Ruling 123), companies were required to place a "fair value" on
the options and arrive at a pro forma, or "as if," calculation of how
that cost would have affected their earnings.</TE>
<TE>   The Numbers Are There</TE>
<TE>   But FASB also required companies to place that data in the
footnotes of their financial reports. Investors can see the
calculations, but only if they make the effort. Take Cisco, for
example. The San Jose-based networking giant last year reported a net
loss of $1 billion, but its pro forma loss--that is, after
subtracting the cost of its options--shot up to $2.7 billion.</TE>
<TE>   GE, Coke and the others that plan to switch will move the cost of
their options from those footnotes directly to their profit-and-loss
statements. General Motors Corp., the nation's largest auto maker,
said last week that it's planning to expense options too.</TE>
<TE>   But corporate America is hardly jumping on a bandwagon. Here's
why:</TE>
<TE>   * Large technology companies oppose expensing options, with
bellwethers Cisco and Intel reiterating their opposition last week. A
few tech companies, such as Amazon.com, are planning to switch, but
the biggest tech firms rely most heavily on handing out options as
incentives--and thus claim to have the most to lose if they must
subtract the options' cost from profits.</TE>
<TE>   If Cisco or another Silicon Valley power were to voluntarily make
the shift, "that would be a watershed event for the community" and
probably would prompt most others to follow, said Robert Willens, a
tax and accounting analyst at Lehman Bros. "But I don't see any of
them breaking ranks."</TE>
<TE>   * FASB acknowledges it wouldn't be able to force all companies to
expense options until next year at the earliest, after it has studied
public comment and otherwise deliberated on the matter. That's far
too slow a pace, some critics say, especially as the political
climate is ripe for quicker action.</TE>
<TE>   * The confusion over how to properly value options makes some
companies hesitant about taking the step. Although they'll all have
to adopt FASB's Ruling 123 that requires they put a "fair value" on
options, companies are doing so in different ways. Some are employing
mathematical models already used to value options traded in the
markets. Others aren't--Coke is soliciting bids from Wall Street
firms to calculate its cost.</TE>
<TE>   * FASB is weighing other changes that could muddle the picture.
For instance, companies that voluntarily switch to formal expensing
wouldn't just begin treating options as a cost, but also might have
to expense their options retroactive to 1995 and restate earnings for
years since then. For companies with lots of options, that would make
their past performance look much worse and jeopardize their stock
prices, even though the change wouldn't involve a cash drain on the
firms, analysts said.</TE>
<TE>   "I was shocked" by that proposal, Willens said. "Any form of
retroactivity will bring this voluntary adoption, I believe, to a
screeching halt." And as FASB is encouraging firms to expense
options, that move "seems counterproductive on their part."</TE>
<TE>   Long-Term Data</TE>
<TE>   The seven-member FASB board, at a hearing last week, considered
that formula and other ways that options could be expensed, but no
decision will be made before the board meets again Wednesday, said
Patrick Durbin, a FASB project manager.</TE>
<TE>   But he said the idea of requiring companies to expense options
retroactively is meant to help the public compare how options would
have affected a company's profit over time, and not just in the
current year, so they can make more educated decisions about its
financial health.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not interested in creating a penalty, if you will, for
companies who are voluntarily adopting" the treatment of options as a
cost, Durbin said.</TE>
<TE>   As the debate goes on, the list of companies deciding to expense
options probably will grow as another means of regaining investors'
trust, predicted David Blitzer, a managing director at Standard &amp;
Poor's Corp. "I'm not sure they'll do it within the next few months,
but most will migrate to it," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "More and more companies outside technology will start expensing
options, and that will put pressure on the tech companies" to follow
suit, largely because institutional investors--which are providing
the capital for all these companies to grow--will look more favorably
on companies that treat options as a cost, Blitzer said.</TE>
<TE>   And Blitzer sees all the confusion over options as overblown.
Investors already have myriad factors they use to calculate before
buying or selling a stock, and expensing options is one more
variable.</TE>
<TE>   "The different treatment of options is going to be another tool in
a long, long list of situations where there are two, four, 10 ways to
do things" in evaluating companies and their stocks, he said. "Yes,
there will be some arguments" about the options' cost and impact on
corporate profits, "but it can be done."</TE>

<HD>Bear Market Sends Many in Search of College Aid</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KATHY M. KRISTOF</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There's nothing like a bear market to derail a college savings plan.
Just ask Terry Hartle, who's wondering whether his portfolio can
survive long enough to pay his 17-year-old-daughter's way into school
next year.</LD>
<LD>   Hartle, who helps advise parents about college finance as senior
vice president of the American Education Council, says he's not even
sure how badly his daughter's college fund has been worn down by the
slide in stock prices.</LD>
<LD>   "I've stopped looking at the statements," he said, adding that
he's hoping for a market rally during his daughter's final year of
high school. "When you've put money aside for a long time, it's very
difficult to see it decline like this at the eleventh hour."</LD>
<TE>   He's not alone. Although no one has statistics on precisely how
much American parents have saved for education--or how much they may
have lost in the 2 1/2-year-old bear market--anecdotal evidence
indicates that Americans' college savings, like their retirement
portfolios, have been hit hard by the market's long slide.</TE>
<TE>   Like workers who are nearing retirement, parents with children in
their late teens don't have time to wait for stock prices to recover
before they're forced to tap into their savings. Many kids are
already packing to attend colleges and universities that accepted
them last spring.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of parents are seeking advice and help on ways to pay for
college this year without having to pull money out of already
devalued college funds," said Youlonda Copeland-Morgan, associate
vice president for admissions and financial aid at Harvey Mudd
College in Claremont.</TE>
<TE>   "Even full-pay parents, who normally wouldn't qualify for aid, are
coming in because their investments are so low."</TE>
<TE>   But all is not lost. There are several steps parents can take to
manage this year's college costs, no matter how their
education-related investments have fared.</TE>
<TE>   * Talk to a financial aid counselor. Most scholarships and grants
already have been awarded. But in some cases, colleges with their own
endowments are able to tap additional aid for students--even at this
late date, Copeland-Morgan said. The bulk of this aid is likely to be
in work-study and loans, however, rather than outright grants.</TE>
<TE>   About 10% of Harvey Mudd's students have asked for more aid this
year, double last year's number, she said.</TE>
<TE>   * Borrow. The one type of financial aid available to all college
students--and still readily available today--is federally backed
student loans, said Judy Miller, owner of financial planning firm
College Solutions in Alameda, Calif.</TE>
<TE>   But before any type of federal aid, including loans, is granted,
the student or parent must fill out what is known as the Free
Application for Federal Student Aid.</TE>
<TE>   The fastest way to complete this application is on the Internet.
The first step is getting a personal identification number at
www.pin.ed .gov. That allows applicants to electronically sign loan
forms, which eliminates about 10 days of back-and-forth mailing.</TE>
<TE>   After receiving a PIN, go to www.fafsa.ed.gov to complete and
transmit the application. Filling out the application requires tax
information for the parent and child, as well as a school code for
the college or university that the child will attend.</TE>
<TE>   The application will be processed in a few days and electronically
transmitted to the school's financial aid office, which will help you
start the process of applying for a loan.</TE>
<TE>   * Consider monthly tuition payment plans. Most colleges provide a
monthly payment option, which allows parents to spread the cost of
tuition over 10 months rather than pay in advance. There is usually
an enrollment fee of about $50, but no financing charges.</TE>
<TE>   * Claim college-cost tax breaks. Although these won't help until
parents file their 2002 income tax returns, many individuals can
recoup a portion of their college expenses by claiming one of several
new and improved tax deductions and credits for people who need to
pay college costs as they go, said Brenda Schafer, senior tax
research coordinator at H&amp;R Block in Kansas City, Mo.</TE>
<TE>   There are three relevant tax breaks. However, each is
income-tested and excludes those whose income exceeds certain levels
from claiming them.</TE>
<TE>   The most lucrative is the Hope Tax Credit. The credit, available
only to college freshmen and sophomores, gives parents a 100% credit
for the first $1,000 in tuition and fees paid and a 50% credit for
the next $1,000. The credit can't be applied to room and board or
book costs. It also phases out for single taxpayers earning more than
$41,000 or married taxpayers with a combined income of more than
$82,000.</TE>
<TE>   Those who can't claim the Hope credit this year can use the
Lifetime Learning Credit, available to all college students,
including adults who go back to school. It provides a tax credit
equal to 20% of the first $5,000 of eligible education
expenses--tuition and fees. Eligibility for this credit also phases
out for those earning more than $41,000 if single or $82,000 if
married filing jointly.</TE>
<TE>   Those whose income exceeds these limits may be able to claim a new
tax deduction. (A tax credit provides a dollar-for-dollar reduction
in the tax paid, while a deduction reduces the amount of a person's
income that can be taxed.) The deduction, available to singles
earning less than $65,000 and married couples earning less than
$130,000, can be claimed for as much as $3,000 in tuition and fee
expenses paid during the year.</TE>
<TE>   The deductions and credits can't be used in concert for a single
student--taxpayers who qualify for more than one must make a choice.
In addition, if a student uses money from a tax-favored savings plan,
such as a Coverdell Education Savings Account or a 529 plan, the
deductions or credits may be reduced.</TE>
<TE>   Parents and students should not give up on a college education
just because the bills seem daunting, Hartle said.</TE>
<TE>   "If you are in a situation where you simply can't put together the
resources at the present time, you need to talk to the college," he
said. "Ultimately, a college is a business. They want people to
purchase an education, and they are going to work with families to
make it possible for them to afford it."</TE>
<TE>   Hartle says he's praying for a rapid market rebound, but parents
who have a year to go before their kids are ready for college should
also make sure that a least the first year's worth of expenses is in
safe, short-term investments such as certificates of deposit or money
market accounts. It's never too late to diversify your holdings--the
long-running bear market has proved that. And even though
fixed-income investments aren't paying much, you at least know the
money will be there come September.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The U.S. stock market's turnaround in the last three weeks may have
happened just in the nick of time--not only for the typical mutual
fund investor, but for the global financial system overall.</LD>
<LD>   Some Wall Street veterans say the market's meltdown in June and
July was threatening to cause a major financial accident, or perhaps
a number of them, among big institutional investors. Some say that
risk still is there, if less severe for the moment.</LD>
<LD>   This kind of talk isn't unusual when markets are in disarray. But
as the near collapse of giant hedge fund Long Term Capital Management
in September 1998 demonstrated, it often isn't just talk:
Extraordinary losses in markets naturally increase the risk of
extraordinary failures.</LD>
<TE>   Investors' fear of a devastating financial explosion may have been
most apparent in the shares of the two largest U.S. banks, Citigroup
Inc. and J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co. The stocks were in a freefall July
22 and 23. Morgan's shares dropped 23% in those two days, bringing
their total decline from June 28 to 40%--wiping out $27.5 billion in
market value.</TE>
<TE>   Exactly what frightened investors into dumping the stocks with
such intensity can't be quantified, of course. Every investor has a
reason for selling. But James Bianco, head of market research firm
Bianco Research in Chicago, believes that one message in the bank
stocks' plunge, and in the dive in stocks in general last month, was
that the risk of financial accidents was mounting.</TE>
<TE>   "I think stocks were pricing in the risk of a financial crisis,"
Bianco said. "That doesn't mean there is one," he said. The problem,
however, is that "if the markets believe it enough, they can make it
happen."</TE>
<TE>   For the financial system, the trouble in June and July wasn't
simply the U.S. stock market's slump. It was that Wall Street's
decline was wreaking havoc with so many other markets.</TE>
<TE>   For many investors, that meant there was almost nowhere to hide.
Red ink was rising throughout their portfolios, in turn deepening the
crisis of confidence in markets and in the financial system itself.</TE>
<TE>   In the parlance of the money management business, the issue was
one of "correlation"--the degree to which markets move in the same
direction.</TE>
<TE>   Big investors create diversified portfolios specifically to avoid
the potential for gross correlation. They want some investments to be
zigging when others are zagging, thus reducing the threat of severe
losses to the portfolio overall.</TE>
<TE>   But from mid-May to late July, markets worldwide were moving in
stunning correlation with the U.S. blue-chip Standard &amp; Poor's 500
index, Bianco and other analysts say.</TE>
<TE>   "The correlations were huge," said Tom Sowanick, senior
fixed-income research chief at Merrill Lynch &amp; Co. in New York.</TE>
<TE>   That was more of a surprise because it was a sharp reversal of
what happened in the first four months of the year. In that period,
the S&amp;P 500 and the Nasdaq composite index were sinking, but many
other sectors of the U.S. market were rallying, as were many foreign
markets.</TE>
<TE>   By contrast, between mid-May and July 23, nearly every sector of
the U.S. market gave ground. So did most foreign markets.</TE>
<TE>   More troubling for diversified portfolio managers was how other
financial sectors were crumbling, including most lower-quality
corporate bonds and even some higher-quality issues.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the dollar's value was dropping, and the price of gold
was virtually flat, offering no significant offset to the global
disaster in equities.</TE>
<TE>   Besides short-term cash accounts, there was one safe haven between
May and July: U.S. Treasury securities. For those investors who owned
them, Treasuries worked beautifully to partially offset losses
elsewhere in a portfolio, as market yields fell and the value of the
bonds rose.</TE>
<TE>   But even that was a correlation, of sorts, with the S&amp;P 500--a
surprisingly strong inverse correlation.</TE>
<TE>   Few investors had bet that Treasuries would rally to the extent
they did, pushing yields on some of the securities to generational
lows. Hedge funds and others that had "shorted" Treasuries, believing
that yields couldn't go any lower, would have been hammered.</TE>
<TE>   The last time correlations were improbably high among financial
instruments was in August and September 1998, when the Russian debt
crisis triggered sell-offs in markets worldwide.</TE>
<TE>   The hedge fund Long Term Capital Management, which in 1998 made
massive bets on bonds using borrowed money, found itself dealing with
a portfolio plunge that none of its computer models had predicted.
Those models assumed that the level of correlation occurring in
markets was practically impossible. Yet it was happening.</TE>
<TE>   As one banking regulator put it at the time: "The LTCM risk model
told them that the loss they incurred on one day at the end of August
1998 should have occurred once every 80 trillion years. It happened
again the following week."</TE>
<TE>   The failure of Long Term Capital Management, which owed billions
of dollars to some of the world's biggest banks, could have set off a
chain reaction of failures within the global financial system. Facing
that prospect, the Federal Reserve quickly acted to cut short-term
interest rates in September 1998, and brokered a bailout of the hedge
fund by leading banks and investment firms.</TE>
<TE>   Fast forward to the present: On some levels, especially with
regard to stocks, the losses investors suffered in recent months have
been far worse than what they lost in late-summer 1998.</TE>
<TE>   As the losses in July deepened, they may have fed on themselves as
investors saw the downward spiral as threatening a financial accident
on the scale of Long Term Capital Management. As Bianco put it,
investors were in danger of making sure their worst nightmare would
be fulfilled, as fear of that nightmare fueled more selling.</TE>
<TE>   But since bottoming July 23, U.S. stocks have bounced. The S&amp;P 500
last week gained 5.1%, its third straight weekly advance. Other
markets worldwide also have stabilized, and the dollar's value has
rebounded somewhat.</TE>
<TE>   Did the global financial system dodge a bullet, or was there no
material threat of a crisis this time?</TE>
<TE>   Some Wall Street pros argue that big banks and investment banks
learned important lessons about risk from the Long Term Capital
Management affair. Those lessons may have lowered the threat to the
system this time around, even as market correlations became intense,
some say.</TE>
<TE>   "Professional investors learned to keep within more reasonable
risk limits," said Ethan Harris, co-chief economist at Lehman Bros.
in New York. In particular, use of leverage may be more restrained.</TE>
<TE>   Others say the pain of market losses this time has been spread
more broadly among investors, diffusing the risks rather than
concentrating them.</TE>
<TE>   Another argument is that the oft-maligned "derivatives"
market--over-the-counter financial contracts that big investors use
to hedge risks with one another--is working the way it should to
protect portfolios from volatility.</TE>
<TE>   Bill Fleckenstein, a Seattle money manager who routinely shorts
stocks, betting on lower prices, said he has been puzzled as to why
no large portfolio blow-ups have occurred in recent months, given the
markets' swings.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe the derivatives are well-structured," Fleckenstein said.
"Maybe it's all going to hang together better than we thought."</TE>
<TE>   But if the stock market's turnaround has lessened the chances of a
financial crisis developing, the question then becomes: What if
markets begin to unravel again?</TE>
<TE>   That possibility puts more pressure on the Federal Reserve. Many
investors expect the Fed to cut interest rates again, if not at this
week's meeting, then in the fall.</TE>
<TE>   With its key rate at a 40-year low of 1.75%, however, the Fed is
nearly out of ammo if a full-blown financial crisis were to occur.</TE>
<TE>   What troubles some experts is that bear markets of the current
one's severity have always had a nasty habit of taking down one or
more big players.</TE>
<TE>   "I've never seen one of these periods without a financial
accident--and I mean never," said Stephen Roach, economist at Morgan
Stanley in New York. "Just because it hasn't happened doesn't mean it
won't."</TE>

<LD>WorldCom Discloses More Flawed Numbers</LD>
<LD>   Battered telecom giant WorldCom Inc. disclosed that its auditors
have uncovered an additional $3.3 billion in faulty accounting dating
to 1999.</LD>
<LD>   The disclosure, two months after the company said it had
improperly accounted for nearly $4 billion in expenses, is expected
to turn up the heat under former Chief Executive Bernard J. Ebbers.</LD>
<TE>   The revelation could trigger additional regulatory action.
Congress passed corporate reform laws after WorldCom's initial
disclosure of improper accounting.</TE>
<TE>   Clinton, Miss.-based WorldCom, the parent company of MCI, is the
focus of several federal investigations of accounting irregularities
that covered up the telecom firm's mounting losses amid an
industrywide meltdown.</TE>

<TE>   Brazil, Uruguay to Get Billions in Bailouts</TE>
<TE>   Brazil obtained a $30-billion emergency loan package from the
International Monetary Fund, the largest bailout in IMF history,
easing concerns that Latin America's troubles will deteriorate
further.</TE>
<TE>   The aid was accompanied by the announcement of $1.5 billion in
bailout funding for Uruguay and a pledge by Treasury Secretary Paul
H. O'Neill to help Argentina. That signaled to investors that the
Bush administration, in a change of policy, will come to the aid of
troubled Latin American economies.</TE>
<TE>   The news helped ease concerns about defaults in Latin America and
boosted the stocks of big U.S. banks, including Citigroup Inc., J.P.
Morgan Chase &amp; Co. and FleetBoston Financial Corp.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   FCC Says New TVs  Must Be Digital by '07</TE>
<TE>   Federal regulators accelerated the nation's conversion to digital
television when it gave manufacturers a 2007 deadline to equip most
new sets with tuners that will offer viewers better pictures and
enhanced sound.</TE>
<TE>   The Federal Communication Commission's vote is expected to raise
the price of new TVs, possibly by as much as $200, even for those
consumers who don't want digital TV. Although the move was hailed as
a victory for television broadcasters and other Hollywood interests
who hope to captivate audiences with digitized images, it was
immediately denounced by consumer advocates and many in the
electronics industry who vowed to fight the order in court.</TE>
<TE>   Congress has set a 2006 target date to convert analog television,
the current standard, to digital, which will allow for
high-definition pictures, clearer sound, more channels and
interactivity.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Microsoft Settles  Net Privacy Claim</TE>
<TE>   Microsoft Corp. agreed to a landmark 20-year settlement with the
Federal Trade Commission, resolving a sweeping claim that the
software giant falsely promised 200 million consumers that their
personal information was secure and private when stored in its
Passport online identity service.</TE>
<TE>   Microsoft agreed to improve Passport's security, test the new
measures' effectiveness, fix any breaches and submit to regular
audits by an independent firm. Any misleading statements could bring
fines or other punishment to the Redmond, Wash.-based company.</TE>
<TE>   Passport stores information about the identity of computer users
and sometimes their credit card numbers and e-mail addresses, so
consumers don't have to reenter the data as they move from one site
to another.</TE>
<TE>   Eisner Under More Fire as Disney Stock Falls</TE>
<TE>   Questions about Michael Eisner's performance as Walt Disney Co.'s
chief executive grew sharper as the media giant's stock fell to an
eight-year low of $13.90.</TE>
<TE>   What makes the latest round of discontent different from numerous
occurrences over the last five years when Eisner has felt heat at
Disney is that key directors are increasingly impatient with its
lagging financial performance and stock price.</TE>
<TE>   Sources close to the company's board say two directors, Roy E.
Disney and Stanley P. Gold, are pressuring Eisner to lift the
company's plunging stock price, deal more aggressively with turning
around key divisions such as the ABC television network and even to
clarify his succession plans. Disney and Gold declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   But Disney director Ray Watson said the board as a whole supports
Eisner, who has headed the company for 18 years.</TE>
<TE>   At week's end, Disney stock closed at $14.65 on the New York Stock
Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   AOL Turns to Outsider to Revitalize Online Unit</TE>
<TE>   AOL Time Warner Inc. named Jon Miller head of its struggling
America Online division, turning to an outsider to stabilize and
reinvigorate its most troubled unit.</TE>
<TE>   Miller, formerly president of the information and services group
of USA Interactive Inc., will be appointed chairman and chief
executive of the division, which has been without a leader since the
abrupt resignation last month of Robert W. Pittman amid a plummeting
stock price.</TE>
<TE>   America Online's credibility battle on Wall Street and within the
AOL Time Warner family means Miller will be stepping into one of the
most challenging and high-profile jobs in the media. But people who
know the 45-year-old executive say his understated, collaborative
style and experience across both the entertainment and Internet
sectors will reshape the insular AOL.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the media company was sued in a California court by the
California State Teachers' Retirement System, which alleged that the
company participated in an accounting sham with troubled real estate
Web site Homestore Inc.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Cisco Earnings Beat Wall Street Expectations</TE>
<TE>   Computer networking giant Cisco Systems Inc. beat Wall Street
expectations with strong quarterly profit. But the results don't
necessarily mean the tech sector has glimpsed the light at the end of
the tunnel.</TE>
<TE>   San Jose-based Cisco said net income for its fiscal fourth quarter
ballooned to $772 million, or 10 cents a share, up dramatically from
$7 million, or less than a penny, in the same period last year. Net
sales for the three months ended July 27 reached $4.8 billion, a 12%
increase.</TE>
<TE>   Excluding charges related to payroll tax on stock options
exercised by employees, acquisitions and other nonrecurring items,
Cisco's earnings were $1 billion, or 14 cents a share, up from $163
million, or 2 cents, a year earlier. On that basis, the company beat
analysts' average estimate by 2 cents.</TE>
<TE>   Chief Executive John Chambers said Cisco's sales would pick up
after the economy as a whole rebounds, though he declined to make
predictions about how soon that might happen.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Former ImClone CEO Faces New Charges</TE>
<TE>   A federal grand jury in New York indicted the founder and former
chief executive of ImClone Systems Inc., Samuel Waksal, on charges of
bank fraud and obstruction of justice, the latest in a series of
crackdowns on suspected corporate wrongdoers.</TE>
<TE>   The 13-count indictment expands the case against Waksal, who in
June was charged with perjury and securities fraud, and brings more
unwanted attention to Waksal friend Martha Stewart, who also has been
caught up in the scandal.</TE>
<TE>   The additional charges also stiffen Waksal's potential penalty; if
convicted on the bank fraud charge alone, Waksal could face up to 30
years in prison.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors had sought to negotiate a plea deal with Waksal before
a Friday deadline to indict him. A deal probably would have required
him to reveal, in exchange for leniency, whether he provided insider
trading tips to family and friends, including Stewart.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Some Airlines Trim Business Fares</TE>
<TE>   Several major airlines--including AMR Corp.'s American, Northwest
Airlines Corp., Delta Air Lines Inc. and Continental Airlines
Inc.--have cut many of their most expensive, unrestricted business
fares 15% to 20%, a move Northwest said was the first reduction in
the fares in perhaps a decade.</TE>
<TE>   The cheaper prices are welcome news for business travelers, who
have been howling for years about the high cost of last-minute seats.
With the economy weak and companies slashing travel budgets, business
travelers are opting to buy cheaper fares with advance reservations,
or not fly at all.</TE>
<TE>   That's a huge reason the big airlines continue to suffer massive
losses; the industry lost more than $1.4 billion in this year's
second quarter. Because they typically pay more than leisure
travelers who book well in advance, business customers generate most
of an airline's revenue.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   FCC Proposes Record Fine in Junk-Fax Case</TE>
<TE>   The Federal Communications Commission proposed a record
$5.38-million fine against a California company that allegedly
inundated businesses and consumers with millions of pages of
unsolicited faxes.</TE>
<TE>   The action against Fax.com Inc. of Aliso Viejo was meant to send a
message to those who violate the federal Telephone Consumer
Protection Act and burden junk-fax recipients with the cost of paper,
ink and other items associated with receiving unsolicited faxes.</TE>
<TE>   The FCC also issued citations to more than 100 businesses that
used Fax.com services, saying they could be liable for financial
penalties if they continue to send unsolicited faxes.</TE>
<TE>   The company plans to appeal.</TE>

<HD>Tech Region Ponders How Deep the Valley</HD>
<DH>Silicon Valley rose to dizzying heights and has come down
hard. Many observers expect it to recover but some wonder whether it
will ever regain its dominance.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MENLO PARK, Calif.</DL>
<LD>No place was as emulated in the '90s as the gold-paved way between
San Francisco and San Jose, which gave birth to what venture
capitalist John Doerr called the greatest legal creation of wealth in
history.</LD>
<LD>   Small wonder: Silicon Valley was home to three of the world's 10
most valuable companies. Start-ups in the region took in nearly half
the record $69 billion invested by venture capital firms in 2000. And
the dot-com explosion was the most spectacular in a series of
innovations dominated by the valley's firms, following the booms in
integrated circuits and personal computers.</LD>
<LD>   Inventors, investors and public officials from around the world
studied the region's universities, venture firms, technology
companies and the supporting cast of bankers and lawyers. Then they
took what they learned about the fast-paced synergy and the
entrepreneurial spirit back to their home turf, building research
parks and encouraging professors to start businesses on the side.</LD>
<TE>   In a nutshell, that strategy worked.</TE>
<TE>   Now, Silicon Valley is crashing as it never has before. And its
fall is being hastened by the spawn of its success--imitative hot
spots of business growth in Boston; San Diego; Austin, Texas; and
elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   Some are wondering whether Silicon Valley will ever be what it
once was.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a healthy paranoia," said Carl Guardino, president of
the Silicon Valley Manufacturing Group, an association of 190 firms
employing 275,000. Every chief executive Guardino talks to says the
current recession is the worst in the valley's history.</TE>
<TE>   "It is the longest and the deepest, and I haven't heard one say
they can see an end in sight."</TE>
<TE>   Venture investments are down everywhere, with some places seeing
their share of new money fall by half. In Silicon Valley, however,
the drop-off recently reached 83%. Now, firms in the region take only
a third of new venture money.</TE>
<TE>   In employment, the numbers are brutal as well. The valley lost 8%
of its jobs--100,000--from December 2000 through May 2002, or 1 in 13
jobs. Massachusetts, by contrast, lost less than 2% of its
jobs--64,000 out of 3.4 million, or 1 in 53. In Texas, it was 1 job
in 136.</TE>
<TE>   "We just plain got creamed," said Richard Carlson, chairman of
Spectrum Economics Inc. in Palo Alto. Other areas are "clearly
turning around, and we're skipping along the bottom."</TE>
<TE>   Not surprisingly, Silicon Valley residents are more pessimistic
about the economy than those in other parts of the country, surveys
found. In June, only 40% of area residents thought the national
economy would be good in the next year, down from 58% three months
before.</TE>
<TE>   For two years, business and civic leaders have explained that the
area simply had further to fall than its geographic rivals. And
they've reminded each other that the region had been incorrectly
written off as a failure during three previous recessions.</TE>
<TE>   But the tenor of those conversations is changing.</TE>
<TE>   There are enough signs of lasting trouble here--and signs of new
life in other places--that "I'm convinced the next upturn won't help
us as much," Carlson said. "The next wave of start-ups, I'm expecting
a lot more to be happening elsewhere."</TE>
<TE>   Many observers agree. One reason is that the last boom was
unprecedented, and the fever might not return. Silicon Valley is at
its best when the intensity is greatest.</TE>
<TE>   "There was a need to be close to competitors and suppliers. It's
almost a network phenomenon--you need to be at the center of it or
you lose out," said Tom Lieser, senior economist for the UCLA
Anderson Forecast. "I expect it will not return to boom-time
economics. There will be some return to places that have lower
costs."</TE>
<TE>   Three years ago, "there were so many things going on here, there
was no need to go anywhere else," said longtime investor Barr Dolan,
a general partner in Charter Venture Capital in Palo Alto.</TE>
<TE>   Back then, nearly 90% of Charter's new investments were in the
valley. Of the three new companies Charter has funded in the last
year, only one is nearby, in Emeryville. The others are in New York
and Ohio.</TE>
<TE>   The boom in venture capital spread the money and expertise far and
wide. And because venture capitalists are being more judicious, they
make time to travel. A start-up firm in Cleveland no longer must come
West to get funded.</TE>
<TE>   From now on, "Silicon Valley won't be quite as unique," said
Robert Caret, president of San Jose State.</TE>
<TE>   Without venture capital, the start-ups were the first to get
crushed. But the pain has gone all the way up the food chain. Santa
Clara-based Intel Corp., which put the Silicon in Silicon Valley,
said recently that it would lay off 4,000 workers. Sun Microsystems
Inc. and Hewlett-Packard Co., both based in Palo Alto, are firing
employees as well, helping to push Santa Clara County's jobless rate
to 7.6% in July. The level has been at least 7% for seven straight
months, the longest stretch above that rate since 1983.</TE>
<TE>   San Jose-based Internet equipment maker Cisco Systems Inc., which
for a brief time was the world's biggest company by market value, no
longer ranks in the top 10. Also exiting the list are hometown
software champion Oracle Corp. and Intel.</TE>
<TE>   Vacancy Woes</TE>
<TE>   One of the most talked-about statistics among CEOs here is the
office vacancy rate. Formal surveys put the figure at more than 20%.
But even those estimates are too rosy, some say.</TE>
<TE>   Many firms, including Cisco and Sun, have empty space they can't
fill with workers or sublease to other tenants, said a team of
Merrill Lynch real estate analysts who recently drove through office
parks, counting cars and people. The actual vacancy rate in the
region may be 30% to 40%, "higher than what we've ever encountered in
any market for any property type in the past several years," they
wrote.</TE>
<TE>   Some lifelong residents are struck by more subtle changes.</TE>
<TE>   Because they could catch the eyes of so many billionaires, Valley
billboards on the 101 Freeway once fetched $100,000 a month. Prices
have since plummeted. Even at the reduced rates, many billboards are
without ads and others feature outdated content. Recently, one still
advertised a comedian's performance that had taken place five months
earlier.</TE>
<TE>   And organizers canceled this year's Sand Hill Challenge, a
soap-box derby-style race that had raised tens of thousands of
dollars for area charities from entrance fees paid by venture capital
firms clustered on Menlo Park's Sand Hill Road.</TE>
<TE>   In time, the business climate in the valley will improve, as it
must in a cyclical economy. Many observers say the valley will regain
some of its former glory.</TE>
<TE>   "The brainpower that's been generated in the last 30 years is all
here--the venture capitalists, the entrepreneurs, the experts, the
medical schools," said Jim Woody, president of Roche Bioscience, the
Palo Alto unit of Swiss pharmaceuticals giant Roche Holding.</TE>
<TE>   Wilf Corrigan, chief executive of chip maker LSI Logic Corp.,
said, "Silicon Valley has this enormous capability to regenerate
itself. That's not going to change."</TE>
<TE>   The executives aren't going to stand by and watch. The crisis has
stirred valley leaders to come together as they haven't for a decade.
Guardino's Silicon Valley Manufacturing Group and Joint Venture
Silicon Valley, a nonprofit coordinating panel, have convened
workshops to start trying to fix things.</TE>
<TE>   "We are smart enough to be glancing in the rear-view mirror behind
us," Guardino said. "The competition is close."</TE>
<TE>   The groups are lobbying for public help with education,
transportation and especially housing, because still-breathtaking
home prices have companies worried about recruiting mid-level
employees.</TE>
<TE>   Joint Venture is laying out a vision for how the valley could
return to power: when nanotechnology, the emerging field of
manipulating molecules, merges with information technology and
biotechnology.</TE>
<TE>   Many firms in the area already straddle those fields, and the
region's powers are pushing for more organized interdisciplinary
brainstorming.</TE>
<TE>   As improbable as it might seem, that sort of high-level guidance
worked a decade ago, when Joint Venture asked for help in funding
pilot Internet projects. One of those projects hired Marc Andreessen,
who soon after co-founded Netscape Communications Corp. Backed by
Doerr's venture capital firm, Netscape's initial public offering in
1995 ignited the Net boom.</TE>
<TE>   Need for Joint Effort</TE>
<TE>   Without coordination, the next period of innovation could skip the
valley, Joint Venture warned in a white paper last month.</TE>
<TE>   "History teaches us that economic leaders in one technology era
can lose their place in the wave of innovation that forms the next
era," the group wrote.</TE>
<TE>   The evangelists of convergence make some compelling arguments.
Advanced technology was needed to analyze the human genome, and the
approach is speeding the pursuit of holy grails such as medical
devices tailored to individuals.</TE>
<TE>   The harsh reality, however, is that nanotech is in its infancy and
Silicon Valley is nowhere near as dominant in biotech as it was in
info-tech.</TE>
<TE>   One predictor of economic vitality in science is funding from the
National Institutes of Health.</TE>
<TE>   Boston's share of the NIH pie has held steady for 10 years at
about 6%. The share in the Bay Area, still No. 1, has fallen to 6.2%
from 7.8%.</TE>
<TE>   Another measure is the IPOs of biotech firms. None of the five
most recent offerings was by a Northern California company. The
largest was by Third Wave Technologies Inc., which is based in
Madison, Wis., and makes software for analyzing genes.</TE>
<TE>   Third Wave Chief Executive Lance Fors said he has had little
problem recruiting employees from Silicon Valley, who are delighted
by the lower housing prices and good schools.</TE>
<TE>   "The most critical thing is the people," said Fors, who recommends
that young companies inspired by university work stay near those
institutions. These days, he said, "there are more success stories
outside of the original hubs."</TE>
<TE>   Raising Hopes</TE>
<TE>   At the annual Silicon Valley Manufacturing Group barbecue last
month around an executive's backyard swimming pool near San Jose,
CEOs hobnobbed with Gov. Gray Davis and state Senate and Assembly
leaders, pressing for tax breaks and infrastructure improvements.</TE>
<TE>   The executives were most excited about joint public and private
financing of four university-based science and innovation centers
around the state--including a $300-million institution being built on
San Francisco land donated by Catellus Urban Development Group.</TE>
<TE>   Under construction just south of the city's financial district,
the UC San Francisco-led center is exactly what Valley leaders are
looking for--a research park where businesses and academics can
influence each other.</TE>
<TE>   However, it remains a dream deferred. After institute plans were
announced in late 2000, "there was a hope people would move in in
droves," UCSF Vice Chancellor Regis Kelly said.</TE>
<TE>   But Catellus Senior Vice President Mike Monroe hasn't been able to
sign a single biotech tenant in 1 1/2 years.</TE>
<TE>   Discussing the hopes riding on biotech, Monroe shook his head.</TE>
<TE>   "It's certainly not going to be the main driver to the Bay Area.
It's not going to save the situation," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Carlson agreed. "We're going to get a recovery, but it's not going
to be a bed of roses," he said. "The degree of dominance we had was
really unsustainable."</TE>

<HD>Pregnant, With Unexpected Grief</HD>
<DH>Technological advances bring much knowledge but can make
unforeseen loss even harder</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANN MARSH</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A short generation ago, mothers weren't privy to the goings-on in
their own wombs. Pregnancies often arose and miscarried, undetected.
Women felt, but didn't see, the movement of their future progeny.
They guessed at their genders and talked to dreamed-of children
through the skin of their bellies. They drank and smoked. They prayed
for the best, and they got what they got. In a way, they were lucky.</LD>
<LD>   "I think people were much happier then," says Carol Archie, a
doctor of maternal fetal health at UCLA. When they lost an unborn
child--one they never had a chance to meet through sophisticated
probes and shadowy pictures--it was so much easier. But, she says,
advances in medical science "give women today a whole lot more to
grieve than their mothers had. That, in some ways, is not a good
thing."</LD>
<LD>   The same technology and testing that offer a new window into the
health of a fetus may also lead doctors to give mothers an array of
dire predictions about their future baby's health. And when test data
are ambiguous, doctors may or may not confess their own uncertainty
about what they've seen. This year, one defiant Los Angeles mother
gave birth to a healthy child although multiple doctors had advised
her to abort, based on early ultrasound information.</LD>
<TE>   The parental psyche reels with the information presented by
ultrasounds, MRIs, CT scans and over-the-counter pregnancy kits.
Couples who used to bond with their children when they were first
placed in their arms now carry fetal ultrasound images in their
wallets. They attach their imaginations and dreams to life at its
most tentative--the eggs in the petri dish, the just-confirmed
conception. And if prenatal testing suggests disorders, they're asked
to make decisions for which even an advanced course in medical ethics
could not prepare them.</TE>
<TE>   Medical science unquestionably has reduced rates of maternal
fatalities, increased survival rates for premature babies, given
infertile women the chance to reproduce, even corrected some fetal
abnormalities through in-utero surgeries. But just as often, the
knowledge it produces announces loss, and the choices it offers are
anguishing. When the technology that seemed to promise a blessing--a
healthy child--cannot, the emotional cost can be unexpectedly steep.</TE>
<TE>   It was New Year's Eve and Matt and Meghan Ruona had invited a
group of friends to their beach house to ring in 2001. With everyone
assembled, Matt looked over at his wife. Two months earlier,
over-the-counter pregnancy tests had confirmed her pregnancy. That
night she was just past the three-month mark, unperturbed by fatigue
or morning sickness. New Year's seemed like the perfect moment for an
announcement. "[Matt] was just about to stand up and tell everyone
when I pulled him back down," says Meghan, then 35. "Something told
me not to."</TE>
<TE>   Days later, on Jan. 3, a routine ultrasound failed to detect a
heartbeat. As a slightly older mom, Meghan knew she was at an
elevated risk for miscarriage and felt prepared. She wondered,
frankly, if she would even care. Instead she was taken aback by the
thunderclap of grief that came after an expressionless doctor looked
at the ultrasound and said, "This baby is dead."</TE>
<TE>   "I left [the office] and I fell apart," she recalls. She and her
husband sat in the living room and cried.</TE>
<TE>   Had Meghan Ruona conceived in her mother's era, she suspects she
would have celebrated the new year no wiser than her friends. "It
would have been confusing as to why I didn't have my period. But
because I had no symptoms, I would never have known," she says.</TE>
<TE>   Because many women are waiting until their late 20s, 30s and even
40s to have children, the number of miscarriages today is greater
than a generation ago, says Joshua Copel, director of high-risk
obstetrics at Yale University School of Medicine. In 1999, the
Centers for Disease Control reported 900,000 miscarriages in the
United States, a number that includes only reported miscarriages and
no vanishing twins.(Ultrasounds have revealed that a surprisingly
high number of single births begin as twin gestations before one of
the pair "vanishes," dying or being absorbed by the other.) Archie
suspects the true number of miscarriages could be 50% or higher than
the number of live births.</TE>
<TE>   Is this a cause for concern? Copel says it is not. The high
percentage is largely due to an increase not in occurrences, he says,
but in diagnoses.</TE>
<TE>   Even so, the frequency of miscarriages can sound alarming,
especially because women often keep quiet about them. It wasn't until
her own that Meghan Ruona learned that five of her 10 closest friends
had miscarried too--as had most of their mothers. At one apartment
complex in Santa Monica, female residents lost six pregnancies on
their way to giving birth to 13 healthy babies.</TE>
<TE>   The increase in pregnancy diagnoses and awareness of miscarriages
has given rise to support groups for parents. Copel, as a young
doctor, was dragged to one of them and "given an earful" from mothers
about the often cold treatment from doctors.</TE>
<TE>   "That made me sensitive to the need to have patience," he says,
and to let a woman who had miscarried know "that I knew she had
actually lost a baby." Miscarriage, he says, "can be as emotionally
devastating as losing a full-term child."</TE>
<TE>   Jane Borman has spent the last 20 years watching as advances in
reproductive technology have given parents new reasons to grieve.
Borman, 62, is a staff member at a St. Charles, Mo.-based national
support group for pregnancy and infant loss called SHARE. She lost
the first two of her six children to premature birth more than 30
years ago and has been working with grieving parents since.</TE>
<TE>   She finds her own experience didn't necessarily differ from that
of parents trying to come to term with very early-stage miscarriage.
Some parents, she says, begin to bond with embryos in petri dishes
during in-vitro fertilization. They then mourn those embryos that
don't survive.</TE>
<TE>   That may stretch an observer's credulity. But, Borman says, "It's
not the loss of the tissue, it's the loss of the picture of the
baby." Even in the extreme petri dish example, she says, "It shows
that a mother's love and attachment is the base for everything. For
so many, they are on the path to becoming a mother. To be a mother
means to take care of this developing baby." At every stage in the
process.</TE>
<TE>   Feelings become more complex when the use of new technology pulls
parents into delicate decision-making about the health and survival
of developing fetuses. Here, the language of distance is
used--there's less talk about babies, more talk of fetuses, and
"termination" or "reduction" replace "death" or the dreaded
"abortion." All in the name of increasing the chances of a healthy
child.</TE>
<TE>   Shannon Thyne, an assistant professor of pediatrics at UC San
Francisco, and two of her friends went through an ordeal late last
year that provides a microcosm of the confusing new world of
childbirth. One of the friends, Hilary, who is 35 and asked that her
last name be withheld, had been trying to become pregnant for two
years. To that end, she had begun taking fertility drugs that
increased her chance of carrying multiple fetuses. Knowing Hilary
could end up carrying triplets or even quadruplets, Thyne had a talk
with her friend.</TE>
<TE>   "I told her, 'Promise me, if you're having more than two, promise
you'll think about reduction,' " Thyne recalls. This refers to
selectively ending the life of one of the fetuses to promote the
health of the others.</TE>
<TE>   Thyne told Hilary that while twins stand a 95% chance of a healthy
birth, those odds drop to 75% for triplets who are more susceptible
to birth defects such as blindness and cerebral palsy.</TE>
<TE>   Eventually, Hilary opted to inseminate in a month when the odds of
a multiple pregnancy were high because drugs had prompted her to
produce five eggs; the chance to finally conceive was too powerful.
"I wanted to try because I was so desperate," Hilary said.</TE>
<TE>   The result: twins. Or so her first doctor said. On a trip home to
Los Angeles last Thanksgiving, an elated Hilary and her mother got
together in Beverly Hills with another friend from high school who is
now a Los Angeles obstetrician and gynecologist. "I said to her,
'Hil, let's go to my office and I can show you and your mom the
babies,' " recalls the obstetrician, who asked that her name be
withheld. The women watched as the ultrasound came into focus. Not
only two, but a third fetus emerged. The celebratory mood turned
dark, especially for Hilary's husband. "This was his worst
nightmare," Hilary said.</TE>
<TE>   The three girlfriends and Hilary's husband talked over the
options. He wasn't comfortable with selective reduction. Through much
soul-searching, the couple created a new vocabulary to describe their
different feelings. Hilary says, "His 'life instinct' was to try to
protect as much life as possible. My maternal instinct was to protect
these two babies."</TE>
<TE>   Hilary's girlfriends brought their own sets of expertise. The
obstetrician, who has two young children, , intimately knows the
risks of pregnancy. Thyne, who cares for babies once the umbilical
cord is cut, understands it from the perspective of a pediatrician
who hopes to have her own children.</TE>
<TE>   Eventually the couple decided to selectively terminate one fetus.
Before this is done, a preliminary test checks the fetuses for
chromosomal abnormalities. In this procedure, a long, thin needle is
inserted into the womb to remove a bit of tissue for testing from the
placentas of two of the fetuses. If both were fine, the third would
be terminated. A short while after this test was conducted, however,
and before the results had come back, one of the fetuses died. The
test could have caused it, or the miscarriage could have been caused
by something else.</TE>
<TE>   "It was almost like a blessing in disguise because we didn't have
to make the choice," Hilary says. "It had been taken out of our
hands."</TE>
<TE>   A boy and a girl survived. Their parents gave them names. Even on
the ultrasound images, they seemed to be developing personalities.</TE>
<TE>   When one fetus in a multiple pregnancy dies, however, the death
can threaten the others. A blood clot can travel from the deceased
fetus to the survivors. Or the test itself can cause an infection.</TE>
<TE>   No one knows for certain what happened. But, in December, the
doctor monitoring an ultrasound became "more and more silent and more
and more worried-looking," Hilary said. The two survivors had died
too. The last days before Christmas, Hilary went about her holiday
tasks, knowing she was carrying dead babies. When she finally
miscarried--on Christmas night--she lost a tremendous amount of blood
during an emergency surgery.</TE>
<TE>   "It was so hard because you bond with them," she says. "When it
was all finally over .... I think I went into this denial phase. And
then I just crashed. I still have terrible nightmares. It's a sense
of not being able to take care of anything. I think I'm grieving
really, really deeply. I guess it's going to come in waves and waves
and waves."</TE>
<TE>   Her two doctor friends grieved along with her. "It was hard. I
felt so, so bad," the obstetrician said. "I also felt guilty because
I have these two beautiful children at home." Thyne regrets she
insisted her friend consider reduction, despite the substantial
risks.</TE>
<TE>   The miscarriage demonstrates that even the best medical knowledge,
delivered from caring friends, can't guarantee a happy outcome in the
game of roulette that is childbearing. In the end, the experience
drew the three women more closely together. Hilary says she feels
fortunate her friends served as her "bioethics committee."</TE>
<TE>   Most women go through difficult pregnancies without this kind of
help.</TE>
<TE>   "The [prenatal] counseling is very inadequate in this country,"
says medical ethicist George J. Annas, a professor at the Boston
University School of Public Health. "Most parents have to slug
through this on their own."</TE>
<TE>   Genetic screening will increasingly present new choices for
mothers in search of The Flawless Child. News accounts earlier this
year told of a Chicago woman who is at risk for early-onset
Alzheimer's disease. She had her eggs screened to ensure her baby did
not carry the same gene mutation as she does. "Now with the genome,
we're all going to appear sick," Annas says.</TE>
<TE>   Barbara Katz Rothman, who wrote the book "The Tentative Pregnancy:
How Amniocentesis Changes the Experience of Pregnancy," (Viking
Penguin, 1986) argues that all these tests encourage women not to
fully commit to a pregnancy. She suggests that the new technologies
aren't always liberating.</TE>
<TE>   But in some cases, even when the news they offer isn't good, the
technologies allow for a different kind of liberation.</TE>
<TE>   Jane Lebak, from Nashua, N.H., says early testing allowed her to
prepare for the coming death of her baby girl. An ultrasound early in
her pregnancy revealed a fetus developing without a brain, a
condition known as anencephaly. Anencephalic babies typically live
only an hour or two after birth. Lebak, who is Catholic, named the
fetus Emily Rose and decided she would carry her to term.</TE>
<TE>   When doctors treated her choice with condescension, she switched
to supportive nurse midwives. Lebak gave birth in July 2000 with
three sets of grandparents present. The baby's small, bluish body was
wrapped in a comfortable white blanket. A soft hand-crocheted cap
covered her head, which had stopped developing immediately above her
eyes.</TE>
<TE>   The family snapped through rolls and rolls of film, and videotaped
Emily Rose's single day with them. In a photograph from that day,
Lebak is shown holding her daughter with a smile, slightly tinged
with something that looks like despair.</TE>
<TE>   "I got a chance to experience unconditional love on the giving
end," Lebak says by telephone. In the background, her new baby girl,
born 10 months ago, cries energetically. "If I live to be 80, those
extra months weren't much to give my baby. If I hadn't had the
routine ultrasound, I couldn't have planned everything I did."</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps optimism is a natural precondition of motherhood. Few
experiences are more deeply rooted in hope than a long-dreamed-of
pregnancy. Even Hilary can't bring herself to regret hers, despite
the outcome.</TE>
<TE>   "Even though you know exactly how many follicles you have and
exactly when you are ovulating, there is still a sense of the
miraculous," she says. "What you give up in total mystery, you get
back in this narrative process."</TE>
<TE>   She and her husband recently learned that Hilary is pregnant
again.</TE>

<HD>A Vanishing Point for Rape Victim Anonymity</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Sandy Banks</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The sight of the two teenage victims on TV--so bold and
self-possessed as they described their abduction, time in captivity
and rescue last week--was enough to make me wonder: What are we, the
media, trying to accomplish when we withhold the names of rape
victims like these? Are we protecting their reputations or our
sensibilities?</LD>
<LD>   Much has been made of the inconsistencies in media coverage of
their ordeal. Some outlets stuck to traditional policies against
divulging a rape victim's identity. Others ran the girls' pictures
and names as soon as they were identified as missing and didn't back
down once the rapes were revealed. And others, including this
newspaper, switched sides as the story evolved.</LD>
<LD>   For days, we refused to identify them, citing our long-standing
rule against using rape victims' names. But after they were
interviewed on national television, their names wound up on our front
page.</LD>
<TE>   Perhaps the policy is a work in progress, which makes this an
ideal time to question its very relevance. Whom does anonymity
protect, anyway? We ought to publicly shame the rapist, not force the
victim to cower behind her curtains, as if she's the one who's done
something wrong.</TE>
<TE>   The prohibition is a holdover from less enlightened times, when
rape was deemed to sully its victims. Then, social attitudes and laws
seemed to make the survivor a party to the crime. She had to prove
she tried to fight off her attacker, and her sexual past was fair
game at trial.</TE>
<TE>   Our response was to cloak victims in secrecy, to protect them from
societal shame. Some states even made it a crime for the media to
report a rape victim's name.</TE>
<TE>   These days we profess to understand that rape is not about sex,
but about violence and rage and that the victim is no more to blame
than someone held up for money at the point of a gun. Rape is no more
a result of sexual passion than domestic violence is an expression of
love.</TE>
<TE>   And yet we continue to shield rape victims, as if they've done
something shameful. Our complicity in the silence may actually
further the stigma, adding to the burden that rape victims face by
ratifying their sense of shame.</TE>
<TE>   There have been halfhearted efforts to move the media to change.
"Our society needs to see that [shame] and attend to it, not hide it
or hush it up," wrote editor Geneva Overholser, in a 1989 commentary
in the Des Moines Register. "We will not break down the stigma until
more and more women take public stands."</TE>
<TE>   Her column prompted a local rape victim to come forward and tell
her story. That led to a five-part series on the rape and its
aftermath that won the newspaper a Pulitzer Prize in 1991.</TE>
<TE>   But little has changed in most newsrooms around the country, and
the few that tried publishing rape victims' names were bombarded with
protests from readers. Their concerns were essentially the same: If
it were my daughter or wife or sister or mother, I wouldn't want
anyone to know they had been raped.</TE>
<TE>   Well, it is our daughters and sisters and mothers and wives who
are being victimized. And not knowing won't stop it from happening.</TE>
<TE>   It's a simple proposition, in the abstract. Stop relying on an
outmoded principle that only perpetuates rape's stigma of shame. Name
names and you ultimately liberate victims, by forcing us to respond
to their pain.</TE>
<TE>   I believe that, but how would it play out in real life, among the
women whose privacy would be on the line?</TE>
<TE>   It would hurt, says Gail Abarbanel, founder of Santa Monica's
nationally known Rape Treatment Center. Because for all our
high-minded talk, rape victims still need protection from prying
eyes. "Unfortunately, we're still at a point in terms of social
attitudes that victims' concerns about the public consequences are
well-founded," Abarbanel says.</TE>
<TE>   "I think because we know more now, the shame the victims feel
isn't the 'Scarlet Letter' type; it's not that somebody had sex with
you and you're damaged goods," she explains.</TE>
<TE>   "It's shame that your vulnerability has been exposed, that you
failed to defend yourself, to prevent it from happening. There's a
burden to the violation that doesn't exist for other crimes."</TE>
<TE>   In the 26 years since her center opened, there have been dramatic
advances in the treatment of rape as a crime. Legislative and legal
changes have afforded victims more rights in courts; police and
medical professionals have been sensitized; technology is making it
easier and less traumatic to gather and present evidence.</TE>
<TE>   "Still," she says, "there's a reason people are more likely to say
they were the victim of a robbery than to mention in conversation
that they were raped. That's because of the response and reaction
when they do tell. You don't get the immediate, unconditional
support. People raise their eyebrows, they wonder, 'What did she do?
What could she have done?'</TE>
<TE>   "It's the only crime where the victim still feels on trial."</TE>
<TE>   The families of those Antelope Valley teens have come in for a
fair amount of criticism for "parading" the girls before news
reporters and allowing them to appear on TV. But I think of those
girls as poster children who can sensitize us to the face of rape, in
the same way that little Samantha Runnion put the menace of child
abduction on our nation's center stage. She too was a victim of
sexual assault, but because she was killed, we allow ourselves to say
her name.</TE>
<TE>   We shortchange women when we presume that they can't muster the
strength of spirit to stand up to what recovery from rape requires.
And we deprive them of a chance for public support if we force
secrecy upon them.</TE>
<TE>   I applaud those young women for going public. They didn't talk
about rape--they didn't have to--but they told us about their plans
to escape, the risks they took, the fear they felt, the strength they
drew from one another.</TE>
<TE>   And the only time they broke down and cried was when they recalled
the death of their captor. "When you see a life taken right in front
of your eyes ... it's the worst feeling in the world." And as the
camera pulled back, I saw that they had linked arms and were holding
on to one another.</TE>
<TE>   Conventional thinking might dictate that the worst thing that
happened to them is the one thing we don't want to mention. But what
I hear them saying is this:</TE>
<TE>   We survived. Life goes on, and we are not about to hide. Secrecy
doesn't heal anybody.</TE>

<HD>CEOs Gorge, and Everyone Else Gets Sick</HD>
<DH>The 'Bankruptcy Barons' made off with billions.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN BALZAR</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Symptoms begin with gasps and a scalded windpipe. This is followed by
nausea, rising fury, perhaps a glimmer of hope and, finally, creeping
numbness. The syndrome, I think, is called UHB, the Unbearable
Heaviness of Being.</LD>
<LD>   After weeks or months, stray facts become blurs and the body's
circuit-breakers begin to shut down. We retreat into mystery novels,
the politics of baseball, "MASH" reruns on television or hard drink.
I've been slipping in that direction myself. It's one thing if the
scandal of corporate America is a case of a few bad apples, or even a
truckload. But overload occurs if there's something rotten in the
orchard itself.</LD>
<LD>   With the benefit of distance and a rousing enthusiasm for
corruption, the British helped bring matters back into perspective
last week. The Financial Times newspaper added up what happened to
top executives of the 25 recent biggest U.S. corporation failures:
They took home $3.3 billion in stock sales, bonuses and other perks
before stiffing shareholders and creditors and dumping their messes
in bankruptcy court.</LD>
<TE>   Oh yes, 94,182 people were thrown out of work and investors lost
$210 billion.</TE>
<TE>   Nine of these corporate "Barons of Bankruptcy," as the Financial
Times called them, pocketed more than $100 million apiece while
leading companies into insolvency.</TE>
<TE>   So much for good work and just deserts, eh?</TE>
<TE>   The trouble with these CEO atrocities, however, is that the
numbers are almost too big to digest. My pocket calculator doesn't
have enough zeros to compute $100 million. And when I work the
numbers out by hand, I'm not sure it really says enough to note that
a person earning $7 an hour would have to work 6,868 years and a
couple of weeks to make that much (you $100K employees could reach
the mark in just a millennium).</TE>
<TE>   By contrast, the Forbes 400 richest Americans accumulated wealth
at the rate of $240,000 per hour in recent years, according to Jeff
Gates, author of the book "Ownership Solution," which seeks greater
fairness in capitalism. CEOs, who earned 26 times the salary of an
average worker in 1965, took home 310 times what they paid their
workers in 2000, as calculated by the Economic Policy Institute.</TE>
<TE>   For all the hot air in Washington about calling a halt to greed,
however, the group Citizens for Tax Justice notes that George W.
Bush's 10-year income tax cut, still the law of the land, will mean a
savings of $342,000 per person for the wealthiest 1% of Americans,
leaving Social Security recipients to face the mess later.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, the good life at the top doesn't stop with stock
options and bonuses. To hang on to their talent, corporations must
make their executives comfortable, right?</TE>
<TE>   We recently learned that Tyco spent more than $11 million to
decorate an apartment for then-CEO L. Dennis Kozlowski. According to
the Wall Street Journal, this included a now-notorious $6,000
"gold-and-burgundy floral patterned shower curtain" and $1 million or
so for his wife's 40th birthday party in Sardinia. I should hope so.
After all, this chap was, again to quote the Journal, "a management
guru who cracked the secret of running a successful, lean
conglomerate."</TE>
<TE>   If you missed the story, let's also mention that Kozlowski put his
personal trainer, his doctor and favorite chef on the company
payroll. Total: $135 million in company perks went to fatten
Kozlowski so he could keep Tyco lean.</TE>
<TE>   If it's hard to digest what we've already learned without lapsing
into terminal UHB, more really bad news looms on the horizon.
Corporate executives have been fattening their earnings statements
for years now--along with their performance bonuses and stock
options--by projecting huge investment gains from their employee
pension plans.</TE>
<TE>   But now these plans are coming up short along with the rest of the
economy. And I don't know anybody with a calculator that has enough
zeros to account for this ocean of red ink.</TE>
<TE>   General Motors, for instance, faces $61 billion in uncovered
liabilities for employee pensions and retiree health coverage, the
New York Times wrote. Business Week reports that just three years
ago, 78% of companies were sitting on fat surpluses in their pension
funds. By the end of 2002, just about the same number will be in the
red.</TE>
<TE>   Experts have begun warning that the squeeze on these old-style
pensions, not to mention the staggering losses to the modern 401(k)s,
could be the defining financial crisis of this decade. It's hard to
imagine that worse is to come, isn't it?</TE>

<HD>Threats Against Saudis Make a Bad Situation Worse</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RACHEL BRONSON</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The rising vitriol against Saudi Arabia is reducing the likelihood
that Washington will be able to address the real problems we have
with that country.</LD>
<LD>   A recent briefing by a Rand Corp. analyst to the prestigious
Defense Policy Board is a perfect example. In the July 10
presentation, it was argued that the Saudi financing of militant
Islamic groups around the world should be Washington's chief foreign
policy concern. If Saudi Arabia does not tamp down on such
problematic behavior, the briefing recommended that Washington
consider seizing the nation's oil-rich eastern province.</LD>
<LD>   In the definition of the problem, the briefing was absolutely
correct. The solution--targeting eastern Saudi Arabia--is not only
far-fetched, it is seriously counterproductive. It reduces U.S.
ability to get Riyadh to even tacitly sign on to a campaign against
Iraq, fuels the anti-American belief that Washington is recklessly
planning to take over the entire Middle East, targets those who might
actually be willing to help us and overlooks other policy
alternatives that could get the job done.</LD>
<TE>   The Rand report could be dismissed if it were a one-off briefing
by a two-bit organization. But going after the Saudis is becoming the
issue du jour. Britain's New Statesman recently reported that the
dismemberment of Saudi Arabia is being bandied about "Whitehall [and]
Westminster."</TE>
<TE>   Make no mistake: Terrorist financing is indeed a very serious
problem, the costs of which Americans only began to feel on Sept. 11.
Evidence from East Africa, West Africa, Central Asia and East Asia
suggests that schools and mosques funded by Saudi money are
dramatically changing indigenous religious landscapes.</TE>
<TE>   Financing often comes from charitable donations, largely of Saudi
origin, both by those who know what they are financing and by those
unaware of the end point of their contribution.</TE>
<TE>   The focus of U.S. policy should be to make sure this is monitored
and controlled by the regimes responsible. Just as the Saudi
government carefully controls the opposition within Saudi Arabia, it
must now take responsibility internationally as well. Saudi royal
family members who serve on charitable boards must be held
responsible for what goes on abroad in the institutions that they
fund.</TE>
<TE>   But threatening the dismemberment of Saudi Arabia undermines a
number of key U.S. interests. First, it will embolden Iraq. If
Washington intends to move against Baghdad, it would be useful to
build as much support in the neighborhood as possible. It is
mind-boggling that as we gear up for a serious military operation
against Iraq, the Defense Policy Board is receiving briefings on
invading Saudi Arabia.</TE>
<TE>   Anti-Saudi rhetoric in Washington adds fuel to the anti-American
fire abroad. Washington has quite a full plate as it is. Iran is a
part of the "axis of evil," war plans are being drawn up against
Iraq, Pakistan's stability is precarious and a Pakistan-India war
threatens, efforts to rebuild Afghanistan are only beginning and the
president has called for "regime change" in the Palestinian
Authority. Now hardly seems the time to threaten the Saudis. Which of
these other goals are those calling for an aggressive Saudi policy
willing to give up to accomplish it?</TE>
<TE>   Finally, the Saudi royal family is the wrong target. After a fire
in a girls' school in March, Crown Prince Abdullah wrested control of
girls' education from the religious establishment. After Sept. 11, an
unprecedented debate was sanctioned between the House of Saud and the
religious establishment over the appropriate distribution of power in
Saudi society. Like it or not, the current regime is the friendliest
partner that we have in the kingdom.</TE>
<TE>   Asking the Saudis to take on terrorist financing would be
enormously costly to them. The crown prince would have to directly
challenge the religious establishment, as well as key members of his
own family.</TE>
<TE>   Washington should push anyway but be realistic about what it is
asking. Inflammatory rhetoric will only back the crown prince into a
corner. Targeting the eastern province would not produce the
cooperation we rightfully expect and desperately need.</TE>

<HD>There Was a Time of Chicano Protest and Heat: Let's Not
Forget</HD>
<DH>A look back on '70 moratorium is set.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>FRANK del OLMO</AU>

<DL></DL>
<LD>In the 1960s, Mexican Americans were often called "the forgotten
minority." That is outdated, the argument goes, because Latinos are a
majority in cities from Miami to San Antonio, and soon in Los
Angeles. The call now is for a new strategy based on Latinos'
emerging political, economic and cultural clout.</LD>
<LD>   I don't disagree with that view. But there are times when the
anger that marked the Chicano movimiento protests, especially against
the Vietnam War, still comes in handy. With so much talk of a new
war, this may be one of those times.</LD>
<LD>   So it is encouraging to note that several organizers of el
movimiento are getting together again. Later this month, on L.A.'s
Eastside, they will commemorate the Chicano Moratorium of Aug. 29,
1970.</LD>
<TE>   For those who have forgotten or simply don't know, the Chicano
Moratorium Committee was an activist group that organized Latino
protests, many against the Vietnam War when that conflict was at its
height and a disproportionately large number of Latinos was being
killed. It held a series of antiwar vigils and marches that
culminated on a smoggy and humid Saturday afternoon in East Los
Angeles when more than 20,000 people gathered for what was, up to
then, the largest Latino protest demonstration.</TE>
<TE>   Sadly, that historic protest march degenerated into the worst
rioting the city had seen since Watts exploded in 1965.</TE>
<TE>   That happened when Los Angeles police and sheriff's deputies,
trying to stop looting at a liquor store near the park where the
march had ended, used tear gas to disperse the crowd.</TE>
<TE>   In the chaos that ensued, businesses along Whittier Boulevard were
burned and looted and three people were killed, including Ruben
Salazar, a Times columnist and news director of Spanish-language
KMEX-TV.</TE>
<TE>   Much has been written about Salazar and his tragic and untimely
death. Less noted is what became of the Chicano Moratorium Committee
and the many activists who joined in its protests. This is a void
that the organizers of Chicano Moratorium 2002, which will run from
Aug. 23 to 30, are hoping to remedy. They are organizing photo
exhibits, lectures, film presentations and prayer services for the
commemoration.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not just a reunion of the old-timers," says Rosalio Munoz,
55, the former UCLA student body president who was chairman of the
original moratorium committee. "We want it to be much more than that.
It's for our kids. We want our children and grandchildren to know
what we were involved in, and why."</TE>
<TE>   All too often, he says, the current generation of Latinos--even
those who consider themselves community activists--is ignorant of
what happened earlier. Accustomed to statistics showing rapid growth
and progress for Latinos, they barely remember a time when Mexican
Americans were a minority that sent a large number of young draftees
to Vietnam.</TE>
<TE>   "I really fear that the next generation will be completely out of
touch" with this history, Munoz says. And the timing of Chicano
Moratorium 2002, he adds, could not be more appropriate, given the
talk about war in Iraq. "George W. has lots of us worried," Munoz
says in referring to the antiwar activists who were the heart of the
old Chicano Moratorium.</TE>
<TE>   I can anticipate the criticism, even the mockery, that will greet
Munoz and the other aging activists as they promote this event. Isn't
it a waste of time, some will ask, to complain about old injustices
when so many new problems need our attention? But that's beside the
point.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe the progress that Latino activists cite with confidence and
pride today would have been achieved without the protests Munoz and
other Chicano activists of his era led. All we know for sure is
history, as it happened. I applaud Munoz and his friends for not
letting us forget.</TE>

<LD>Fires are raging across the West. Grim-faced federal officials report
that more than 4.7 million acres have already burned, twice the
10-year average. President Bush declared most of Colorado a disaster
area after Gov. Bill Owens said the burned region suffered a "nuclear
winter." This news hits outdoors-loving Americans in the gut. We
assume all natural resources in the paths of the fires are lost:
old-growth stands, trout pools, prairies--all destroyed.</LD>
<LD>   Are they? We don't know. Worse yet, no one knows.</LD>
<LD>   Although federal agencies keep a tally of the acres within the
containment lines that firefighters build to halt the spread of each
blaze, what happens inside the fire lines is a bureaucratic void.
Beyond a handful of the most damaging fires, officials do not track
whether forest stands were devastated or improved by fire, whether
watersheds were hurt or helped, wildlife habitat destroyed or
enhanced.</LD>
<TE>   We need to know. Fire plays a crucial role in most Western
ecosystems. At a time when the public goal is to restore forests to a
more natural state, understanding where fires destroy and where they
revitalize ecosystems should be shaping management policies. It
should be used to help firefighters decide which wildfires to put out
and which to just monitor.</TE>
<TE>   Without sound scientific information about what happens inside the
fire lines, we have no way to evaluate the effects on ecosystems or
the threats to communities. That leaves us at the mercy of
politicians who cater to the immediate demands of their constituents,
not the long-term needs of natural resources.</TE>
<TE>   In our ignorance, we assume that everything within the fire
perimeter is ruined. It hardly ever is.</TE>
<TE>   The northeastern California Storrie fire started Aug. 17, 2000,
and burned 56,000 acres near the Feather River. Tearing up the steep
canyon slopes, it romped through stands that had been heavily logged
and through pristine areas where no roads had ever been built.
Loggers and environmentalists alike bemoaned the devastation.</TE>
<TE>   My on-the-ground exploration revealed far less catastrophe and far
more complexity. Some forest stands within the Storrie fire were
truly scorched--the heat so intense it cooked the soil, thwarting
most new growth for years. Entire hillsides were reduced to black
specters towering over charred ground.</TE>
<TE>   But other places were not only spared devastation; the fire
improved them. Above Yellow Creek, tiny oaks were pushing through the
soil beside still-smoking stumps. The following spring, a profusion
of lilies, paintbrush and penstemon graced glades along Soda Creek,
liberated by the fire from the young white firs that had been rapidly
taking them over. The fire killed several half-acre clusters of
cedar, pine and red fir, creating sun-filled openings for nature to
start afresh.</TE>
<TE>   Most veteran trees survived, needled canopies intact, still
shading an open forest floor. Flames licked at their bases, sometimes
marking ancient trunks with black streaks running as high as 15 feet.
The fire scoured out the ground litter, cleansing mountainsides and
creek canyons of decades of debris. Evening grosbeaks flashed golden
among pine branches, and fresh scratches in aspen bark marked the
recent presence of a bear. This was no nuclear winter.</TE>
<TE>   A U.S. Forest Service review of the Storrie fire estimated that
14% of the area burned intensely. Two-thirds of it enjoyed the
creeping ground fires that forest managers struggle to set in
imitation of natural fire regimes.</TE>
<TE>   That is the kind of data we need for fires nationwide.
Unfortunately, the Forest Service gathers it for fewer than 1% of its
wildfires. The information is collected to stave off the worst
erosion and the most costly siltation. It is not used for long-term
planning by forest ecosystem managers.</TE>
<TE>   Federal officials blame the dearth of data on the agency's
traditional preoccupation with fire suppression and timber harvest
volume, a decades-old double-whammy generating management policies
that ignore the role of natural fire in the evolution of ecosystems.
As public priorities for national forest lands shift from saw logs to
recreation, managing wildfire becomes essential. We can't manage what
we don't know.</TE>
<TE>   Understanding the effects of wildfire is part of understanding and
restoring Western ecosystems. Even armed with sound data about what
happens inside the fire lines, federal officials may never quell the
public controversy over fire. Without it, they have no chance.</TE>

<LD>"The Cat in the Hat" doesn't feel the same these days. Just a little
while ago, the children's classic book was a romp of pure mischievous
fun, all the wild and messy things we would have loved to do while
our parents' backs were turned, complete with imaginary playmates.</LD>
<LD>   But the recent spate of kidnappings has entered our collective
consciousness. Dark interpretation invades even Dr. Seuss.</LD>
<LD>   The book starts out with two very young children--you can tell
because as they "Sit! Sit! Sit! Sit!" their legs dangle in their
chairs far off the floor. They have been left home alone by their
mother who, with her trip "out of the house for the day," clearly is
due for a visit from child protective services.</LD>
<TE>   Suddenly, a huge and very weird stranger bursts through the door
(imprudently left unlocked) and proceeds to ransack the house on the
excuse that he's an expert in having fun. The children, though leery
of the cat, obviously have received no training in stranger safety
because, as the boy narrator explains, they "did not know what to
say." The children make no move to call 911, and the cat breezily
overcomes any objections by assuring them their mother won't mind at
all. Only the family goldfish proclaims that the cat belongs out of
the house while the mother is gone, but the killjoy is roundly
ignored.</TE>
<TE>   Ultimately, after introducing two even more destructive visitors
to the house, the cat picks up all the mess and leaves with a tip of
his hat. But every parent knows that this isn't the way such an
incident is likely to end. On the closing page, Dr. Seuss offers an
even scarier glimpse of how separate a child's life is from the adult
world as brother and sister wonder whether to tell their mother about
any of this, and ask the reader, "Well, what would you do if your
mother asked you?"</TE>
<TE>   The children keep the secret, because in the sequel, the cat
returns while their still-clueless mother is "down to the town for
the day."</TE>
<TE>   Parents can't help but wonder: Does this book subvert my efforts
to teach children not to give in to strangers' demands? Shouldn't
today's child be warned never to keep secrets at the behest of
potentially dangerous adults?</TE>
<TE>   Come on, it's one of the funniest books ever written in anapest.
Can't we just relax here?</TE>
<TE>   Life has changed in sad ways from the days when Dr. Seuss was
writing, but a dearth of silliness would be a great loss indeed.</TE>
<TE>   Psychologist Bruno Bettelheim said that even the grimmest of fairy
tales help children manage their fears. Maybe that works for adults
as well. In that case, we all could use more Seuss. A new copy of
"Hansel and Gretel" might help too.</TE>

<LD>The last thing frustrated investors want is evidence that corporate
fraud reforms are producing accounting disclosures that fulfill the
letter of the law but not the intent. Not while auditors keep
uncovering additional billions of dollars in accounting
irregularities at WorldCom.</LD>
<LD>   But there are troubling signs that corporate doublespeak and
intentionally vague language are seeping into newly required
disclosure statements. These statements should be giving investors a
clearer picture of what's going on inside corporations and Wall
Street investment firms.</LD>
<LD>   There have been improvements. Investment houses are providing a
better picture of their business dealings with publicly traded firms,
filling a glaring need that surfaced when New York Atty. Gen. Eliot
Spitzer used company e-mails to expose embarrassing contradictions
between what Merrill Lynch stock analysts were saying publicly and
privately about highflying dot-com firms.</LD>
<TE>   Investment firms are detailing potential conflicts of interest at
the end of stock analysts' reports. A Salomon Smith Barney report on
AOL Time Warner discloses that one of the media giant's executives is
on the board of the investment firm's parent company. The report also
tells investors that AOL Time Warner recently paid the firm banking
fees. But in addition it contains more than 50 lines of small type.
The danger is that truly important information will be accidentally
lost--or willfully hidden--in the verbiage.</TE>
<TE>   Also disconcerting are some of the initial filings generated by
new requirements that corporate executives attest to the accuracy of
financial statements. Attorneys are still grappling with complex
requirements. But there are signs that some executives are trying to
evade responsibility for their reports.</TE>
<TE>   Some statements on file at the Securities and Exchange
Commission's Web site (www.sec.gov) are refreshingly straightforward;
Office Depot's chairman states that "no covered report contains an
untrue statement of a material fact." Others are frustratingly dense.
An executive certified the veracity of MONY Group's accounting
"solely to the extent necessary to comply with the requirements, if
any, of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002." Clear as mud.</TE>
<TE>   That language will baffle even the savviest investor.
Unfortunately, that's probably the intent. The SEC must ensure that
executives take responsibility for actions occurring on their watch.
Otherwise, all of these disclosure statements won't tell investors
what they truly need to know.</TE>

<LD>In the blue luminescence of Los Angeles International Airport's
glowing columns, you steal a kiss. And, knowingly or not, you become
a bit player in the increasingly ubiquitous reality TV show that
might be called Life in America.</LD>
<LD>   The 1,200 new closed-circuit cameras that airport officials want
to mount throughout LAX to thwart terrorists would join cameras
already spying on Christian youth groups proselytizing on the stairs
of the Lincoln Monument and union organizers discussing strategy on
the sidewalks of Virginia Beach, Va. There the cameras come equipped
with face-recognition technology, allowing police to match the mugs
of strolling citizens against a database of mug shots.</LD>
<LD>   Comforting? Unsettling? Who decides?</LD>
<TE>   Since 9/11, the government has thrown its formidable weight onto
the security side of the tenuous balance between safety and liberty.
Now, a few legislators want to make sure authorities don't forget the
other side.</TE>
<TE>   Rep. Bob Barr (R-Ga.) wants to require government agencies to file
privacy impact reports similar to environmental impact statements.
Another idea, by Sens. John Edwards (D-N.C.) and Charles E. Schumer
(D-N.Y.), would create a national commission to recommend standards
for the use of surveillance technology.</TE>
<TE>   Both approaches need considerable scrutiny, but at least lawmakers
are finally showing concern about the rush to make the U.S. safe
by--among other intrusions--videotaping Americans' every waking
moment.</TE>
<TE>   In part because video is a relatively new technology, few of the
long-standing protections that keep the government from
indiscriminate eavesdropping apply to visual spying--although the
potential for abuse by a J. Edgar Hoover or local sheriff is similar.</TE>
<TE>   During these times of terrorism, we're willing to concede that the
discomfort that cameras cause innocent passengers at places such as
LAX is overshadowed by the chance that the cameras will deter someone
from strolling in with an AK-47--or help capture the next person to
shoot up an airline counter.</TE>
<TE>   Even then, cameras may not be economical. In a recent two-year
period, Britain spent an estimated 75% of its crime prevention budget
on surveillance employing almost 40,000 government cameras. A report
by one crime prevention group suggests that adding streetlights would
do more to reduce criminal violence. LAX will pay as much as $20
million to bolster its video surveillance. That's a lot of Alpo for
bomb-sniffing dogs.</TE>
<TE>   Grudging tolerance of surveillance at airports does not mean
people like being spied upon--although individualism and distrust of
authority will probably wither as Americans become increasingly
inured to being on camera each time they visit an abortion clinic,
attend a gun show or sit under a tree reading the Koran. And until
lawmakers come up with reasonable privacy safeguards, there will
always be jittery officials eager to plant video cams in the local
park's jacarandas.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Stanley Hulett's "Light at the Tunnel's End? No, Not Yet"
(Commentary, Aug. 6) blamed California's legislators, regulators,
environmentalists, politicians and energy companies for the
electricity crisis that tore our state apart the last two years. Fair
enough, but where is the leadership to get the problem fixed now,
once and for all? We still have no sensible plan for making sure that
necessary power plants are built or transmission lines constructed,
even as we watch our population grow from 35 million to 40 million by
2010.</LD>
<LD>   It appears that the only real strategy now in place is beating up
on the energy companies while closing our eyes and wishing real hard
that they will invest billions of their shareholders' dollars to keep
the lights on. No progress is being made on fixing our terrible
electric transmission problems either. All the effort is going into
demonizing the only entities with the resources to keep the lights
on. With so much at stake, where are the candidates for governor?</LD>
<LD>   Joel R. Price</LD>
<TE>   Thousand Oaks</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Hulett cites a statement by Rep. Doug Ose (R-Sacramento): "Certain
politicians in California have tried to convince the public that
there is no real shortage of [electricity] supply." Gov. Gray Davis
has repeatedly noted that we are not yet out of the woods regarding
the energy challenge. That is why he implemented the 20/20 energy
conservation program. The Davis administration has also expedited the
plant-siting process and added more than 5,000 megawatts to the
state's power grid since 2000.</TE>
<TE>   However, it is critical to differentiate between the need to add
more power to the grid and the primary cause for the energy crisis:
the gaming of the electricity market, which Hulett downplays.
Berkeley professor Severin Borenstein has shown that the energy
crisis was largely due to market manipulation by energy generators
that withheld power to drive prices up to astronomical levels.
Borenstein and other experts have also made clear that the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission failed to uphold the law during the
height of the crisis, imposing a huge cost burden on California
consumers. Davis continues to fight for the billions of dollars in
refunds our consumers deserve.</TE>

<LD>Frida Ghitis reveals that beleaguered Colombia's new president plans
to enlist "battalions of civilians" as the "eyes and ears" of the
military (Commentary, Aug. 6). Great plan, if you want a military
takeover.</LD>
<LD>   Given the U.S. support of Colombia's internal war, you have to
wonder if this system of domestic spying will serve as a trial horse
for our own proposed TIPS program. If so, let's save our taxpayers
some money. The Bush administration doesn't need another example of
this despicable idea. It has worked for every totalitarian regime ...
until the reign of terror tore the regime in two. Who needs
terrorists to destroy us?</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Facing a Real Emergency," Aug. 7: The outrage of some property
owners over the proposed property tax to fund our trauma network is
disingenuous. Mortgage interest and real estate taxes are deductible
against federal income tax. This is a very nice tax break that
homeowners enjoy. Renters do not have access to such a deduction, and
owning a house is becoming less possible for many hard-working
people. I think property owners who decry the "unfairness" of this
tax without acknowledging the preferential tax benefits they receive
are a bit hypocritical.</LD>
<LD>   Let's find a way to fund this important resource for our
community. I think $40 or $60 from even modest households already
receiving a tax break from Uncle Sam is not too much to ask. As one
privileged to be a homeowner, I would not mind paying this tax. My
greater fear is that our first-class trauma network will not be there
when needed by homeowners or anyone else.</LD>

<LD>As a longtime union member and strong supporter of the necessity for
organized labor in an equitable society, I am appalled at the scare
tactics of the Police Protective League ("Police Unions Launch
Anti-Secession Fight," Aug. 7). If my distaste for the
self-glorifying edifice builders and financiers of the L.A.
establishment were not enough to dispose me toward secession, Capt.
Jim Tatreau's veiled threat, "I'm very confident Hollywood and the
Valley will see it's in their best interest to stay with this great
city and this great Police Department," pushes me over the edge. In
our "best interest" indeed. Makes you think of Joe McCarthy or Tony
Soprano.</LD>

<LD>To be blunt, I am not emotionally moved or concerned about those
Palestinians who have to go through trials and tribulations to get to
school because of Israeli obstacles put there to assure the safety of
Israeli citizens ("Getting to Class Is a Test for West Bank
Students," Aug. 7). My heart goes out to those Jewish children of all
ages who will never go to school again because of the barbaric,
murderous acts of Palestinian terrorists.</LD>
<LD>   The Times is most consistent in its misplaced compassion, choosing
to highlight suicide bombers, their families and those whose lives
are made very uncomfortable because they choose evil over good and
hand out candy upon the deaths of innocents. Why not an article about
the children on buses heading for school whose lives were literally
blown away?</LD>

<TE>   I have no doubt that there is malnutrition among Palestinians
("Hunger Afflicts Palestinians, a New Report Says," Aug. 6). I do
have a doubt that "Israeli-imposed closures and curfews [are] the
main cause." The Israelis impose closures and curfews only after Jews
are blown up or shot by Palestinian terrorists who are given safe
harbor in the Palestinian neighborhoods. The entire Palestinian
population is complicit in, and therefore guilty of, harboring
terrorists.</TE>
<TE>   If the Palestinians want to have the opportunity to obtain the
proper nutrition for their people, they need to take an active role
in identifying terrorists, having them arrested and insisting that
the terrorists stay in jail. If they do not, they have only
themselves to blame for malnutrition and the deaths of children
during Israeli assassinations of the terrorist leaders.</TE>

<TE>   In "Israel Faces Court Test of Deportation Plans" (Aug. 6) I read:
"Human rights activists argue that imposing sanctions on relatives is
a form of collective punishment illegal under international law." I'm
curious as to why the killing of civilians, the maiming of passersby
and the destruction of property by a suicide bomber is not collective
punishment of innocent people. If the implication is that there are
no innocent Israelis then it must be true that there are no innocent
Palestinians.</TE>

<TE>   As a Jew in the diaspora (living and worshipping outside of
Israel), my whole being bleeds with each injury, dismemberment and
loss of life in the Middle East conflict. My heart is broken as I
find myself, a lifelong liberal, proponent of civil rights and
student of comparative religions and cultures, starting to have
knee-jerk negative reactions to people whom I deem by their
appearance to be Arab and thus my enemy.</TE>
<TE>   I don't want to feel this way. It shames me. I mourn my idealism
and pray that the time be not distant when I can more easily embrace
the Arab community once again, as I embrace my fellow Jews.</TE>

<LD>Re "Records Belie Simon on Fraud Case," Aug. 7:</LD>
<LD>   Perhaps [Republican gubernatorial nominee] Bill Simon merely has
convenient lapses of memory. Simon, who made his money the
old-fashioned way--Daddy gave it to him--has flubbed investments and
lost his family millions, enabling him to take tax deductions that
more than cover personal losses.</LD>
<LD>   Simon sings of his years as a hard-nosed law enforcement officer
but disparages the tune of a jury that found his firm guilty of
fraud. Simon played first violin while orchestrating the destruction
of a formerly viable company, taking huge upfront fees and leaving a
bank holding the bag.</LD>
<TE>   Simon is wasting his time running for governor of California. His
record makes it clear that he's presidential material.</TE>
<TE>   Marvin J. Wolf</TE>
<TE>   Mar Vista</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Regarding Simon and his firm's investment in Pacific Coin:</TE>
<TE>   When commenting about pushing for answers to his handwritten
questions on a memo, Simon is quoted as saying, "I'm a nice fellow. I
might go away at some point."</TE>
<TE>   Might I suggest, Mr. Simon, that "some point" has arrived, and it
is time for you to go away?</TE>
<TE>   Jerry Parsons</TE>

<TE>   What is Gov. Gray Davis' priority? Since Davis was elected, he has
been responsible for two treasuries. Three and a half years after he
was elected, his campaign bank account is full and the state is
broke.</TE>
<TE>   Given this anomaly, one would expect Davis to be working hard to
balance California's budget. Instead, Davis seems to care about
nothing but raising money to run campaign ads against Simon. Davis
should focus a little less on politics and a little more on running
the state.</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Maybe the unfinished story of balloonist Steve Fossett--routinely
described now as "American adventurer"--will turn out to be epic, the
kind that captivates through the ages. The suggestion was floated
recently by the oddly smitten world news media, after Fossett's
record-setting solo flight around the world. An Australian newspaper,
for instance, hailed the 58-year-old Chicago millionaire for
following "in the tradition of the great explorers from Marco Polo to
Ernest Shackleton."</LD>
<LD>   We'll let the Marco Polo reference go, but we wonder if
Shackleton, the storied polar explorer, isn't worth another look. He
is the subject of an exhibition billed as the most comprehensive of
its kind, "The Endurance: Shackleton's Legendary Antarctic
Expedition" at the Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County.
Peruse it and you get a sense of a classic modern adventurer who
expands the concept of human potential.</LD>
<TE>   If you read his press, it sounds as if Fossett has secured his
place in the same league. Last week in New Zealand, Fossett again was
being hailed as Mr. Adventure by journalists tracking his efforts to
break the world gliding altitude record by co-piloting a sailplane
above 49,007 feet. And you have to give him credit for landing the
Bud Light Spirit of Freedom balloon in the Australian outback July 4,
after a 13-day journey. Fossett had made five previous unsuccessful
attempts to circumnavigate the globe in a hot-air and helium-filled
balloon.</TE>
<TE>   So how does that kind of persistence stack up against
Shackleton's? Consider the story of Shackleton and his 27-member
crew, told through 150 striking black-and-white photographs and other
displays on exhibit in Los Angeles through Sept. 2.</TE>
<TE>   Their journey began in August 1914 aboard the Endurance, which set
sail from England, bound for Antarctica. When the wooden ship was
only a day's sail from the continent, a treacherous ice pack closed
in. Blocks of ice twisted the deck timbers, wrenched the sternpost,
rolled her on one side and then later splintered the 144-foot-long
ship into pieces.</TE>
<TE>   Ten months after the Endurance sank in November 1915,
Shackleton--with provisions long gone, with minimal gear and
equipment--managed to get the entire crew home alive.</TE>
<TE>   We turned to Ann Muscat, the cheerful curator of the Shackleton
exhibit in Los Angeles. Muscat also is a biologist who made two
research trips to the Antarctic in the 1980s, diving under 7 feet of
ice to study the underwater food chain. She was diplomatic on the
Fossett-Shackleton question. "At first I thought, oh no, they're very
different," she said, before reading up a bit on Fossett. "Then I
thought, they're not as different as we might think, probably. The
biggest difference is what we know about the world today and what
people knew about the world then."</TE>
<TE>   Both men appear to be driven by the same kind of fire, Muscat
surmised, "to seek the unknown. The sense of being part of something
that's bigger than yourself."</TE>
<TE>   The drama of Shackleton's story, of course, was heightened by the
catastrophic loss of his ship just off the world's coldest continent
in largely untouched territory. Shackleton, at age 40, had set out
with a team of scientists and others (including one stowaway) to
become the first to traverse the Antarctic by foot and claim the last
great polar prize for Britain. His tale has been immortalized through
movies, books, poetry and other means including a novel narrated by
the ship's cat. Eighty-four years after the Endurance expedition
began, entire management seminars are devoted to his leadership.</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, Fossett's journey on the adventure landscape is
simply different, his place in history unknown (Though his
round-the-world gondola is to be displayed at the Smithsonian's
National Air and Space Museum). So far, Fossett has set seven world
records in speed sailing, swum the English Channel and competed in
the Iditarod--an impressive check list, no doubt, for a pudgy
investments company president. His balloon expedition, though,
cinched his reputation as the adventurer of our day.</TE>
<TE>   At one point, Fossett had to climb out of his gondola, which was
about the size of a closet, and extinguish a small fire caused by a
loose hose. In the thin air, five to six miles above sea level,
Fossett had to breathe through an oxygen mask. Outside temperatures
plunged to 50 degrees below zero, though a pair of heaters inside the
gondola kept temperatures between 40 and 70 degrees.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, the Waikato Times newspaper in New Zealand proclaimed
that Fossett had pushed himself "to the very edge of human
endurance"--a place that apparently includes a Global Positioning
Satellite navigation tool, satellite telephone, high-frequency radio,
laptop computer, full-length bunk and sleeping bag, macadamia nuts,
backup chase plane and ground crew with two meteorologists.</TE>
<TE>   By comparison, Shackleton's navigator had only a few tools and a
sextant, the hand-held instrument that uses the position of the sun
to plot a ship's position. The crew had no communications equipment.
After the Endurance made its last stop at a whaling station in
December 1914, no one heard from the men for nearly two years.</TE>
<TE>   Their saga was documented through the work of ship photographer
Frank Hurley, who, as the Endurance crumpled, dived into freezing
waters to save his glass-plate negatives. The Los Angeles exhibition
includes the most extensive showing of his work ever, with
photographs that captured the crew's daily lives and spirits.</TE>
<TE>   There are pictures of the men romping with their huskies, which
later had to be shot and eaten when food stocks ran out. Pictures of
the cook in a white chef's hat, skinning a penguin for dinner.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps the most haunting portrait in the exhibition is a ghostly
image of the Endurance, sails down, stranded in a sea of white
against the black sky. Hurley, shooting from an ice floe, caught a
sense of how grand it once was, with its three masts, made of oak and
Norwegian mountain fir. "The ship caught at night--just the eerie
nature of it and thinking of what it's like to be somewhere that's
dark all the time. This brings to mind, what does it do to your
psyche?" Muscat said.</TE>
<TE>   Last winter, Muscat led a museum tour to the Antarctic peninsula
and South Georgia island in the South Atlantic Ocean. The tour
included a stop at Shackleton's grave on the island, where he died in
1922 of a heart attack on another expedition. Muscat also took the
group to a small island where Shackleton and his crew were forced to
make camp.</TE>
<TE>   From Elephant Island, Shackleton and five volunteers left to seek
help, riding a tiny lifeboat through an ice storm and eventually
making their way to a whaling village, 800 miles away.</TE>
<TE>   One of Hurley's pictures depicts a black spot on the gray
horizon--Shackleton on a borrowed trawler, plowing through the ice
pack, returning for the rescue of his men. The men are photographed
from behind, hats off, gloved hands up in triumphant waves or
salutes.</TE>
<TE>   Muscat pointed out another picture showing the glowing face of
five young crew members huddled around a stove, before the shipwreck.
She is intrigued by the crew, their dynamics, how they survived the
Antarctic winter, when temperatures dropped to minus-30 degrees
Fahrenheit, excluding the windchill.</TE>
<TE>   "I love this one against the fire," she said, "to look in their
faces and imagine what they might be thinking and feeling and to see
the camaraderie. It's just a wonderful glimpse into something that
you usually have to imagine in your mind, and then you don't really
get a true sense of it."</TE>
<TE>   Her eyes fell on a photograph of Shackleton's quarters, filled
with books and a typewriter. "I like looking at Shackleton's cabin
and seeing how neat and tidy it is and wondering how that's a
reflection of who he is .... "</TE>
<TE>   And what about Fossett's story? Will generations scrutinize the
photographs of his expeditions in the same way, peering into the eyes
of his crew? "Oh, it's hard to say," she demurred with a grin. "I
couldn't even begin to predict."</TE>

<TE>   "The Greedy Triangle"</TE>
<TE>   by Marilyn Burns</TE>
<TE>   This book is about a triangle who was happy to be who he was. He
could be a triangle in an orchestra, he could be the outline of a
roof, and what he liked best was when people put their hands on their
hips and he could be the outline. He did this every day, enjoying his
time.</TE>
<TE>   But one day the triangle got sick of who he was so he changed into
a square. Then he got sick of who he was again and changed again. The
triangle changed so much, after a while he turned into a circle. Then
at last he realized that he didn't get to do any of the stuff he did
when he was a triangle, so he decided to turn back into a triangle.
We liked this book because it shows that no matter who or what you
are, you are special in your own way.</TE>

<LD>Promised that a surprise would follow the opera recital, members of
the audience watched the curtain rise on tenor Placido Domingo
singing a plaintive aria from Puccini's "The Girl of the Golden
West."</LD>
<LD>   Never mind that it was a film clip. They burst into applause.</LD>
<LD>   Next month the action will be live when Domingo appears at the
Dorothy Chandler Pavilion--as a bandito--in the opera about the
California Gold Rush.</LD>
<TE>   Stimulating interest in the upcoming production was the point of
the recital and dinner presented by Hispanics for Los Angeles Opera
at the Autry Museum of Western Heritage in Los Angeles. Founded 11
years ago to encourage the Latino community's appreciation of the art
form, the nonprofit organization frequently stages social events that
educate and entertain. It also sponsors benefits such as the annual
Placido Domingo Award Dinner to raise funds for the L.A. Opera
Education Program, an outreach each year to more than 30,000
predominantly Latino schoolchildren.</TE>
<TE>   "When we began, only 2% to 3% of L.A. Opera tickets were being
purchased by Hispanics," said Orlando J. Ortega, chairman. "Now it's
close to 9%."</TE>
<TE>   When Domingo, honorary chairman of Hispanics for Los Angeles
Opera, was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom last month for
promoting opera around the world, the group's mission "gained even
greater importance," Ortega told about 200 guests at the Aug. 4 event
at the Autry.</TE>
<TE>   Group president Dolores E. Richardson said a speech by Domingo
inspired her passion to bring opera to Latinos: "I heard him promise
his mother that he would bring opera music to the Hispanic people,"
she said. "He has kept that promise."</TE>
<TE>   Sporting western finery, partygoers sampled appetizers--chili con
queso, chorizo strudel--at tables topped with bougainvillea at an
alfresco cocktail reception before watching opera singers James
Creswell, Cynthia Jansen and Jessica Rivera perform in the museum's
Wells Fargo Theatre.</TE>
<TE>   Guests who arrived an hour before the 5 p.m. reception received a
tour of the museum and viewed its historical exhibits. One crowd
pleaser: "Art of the Charreria: A Mexican Tradition," a display of
everything from leather saddles and holsters encrusted with silver to
sombreros embroidered with gold.</TE>
<TE>   Wending her way through the crowd, dinner chairwoman Ileana
Cataldo greeted guests and spoke of her love for opera. "It began
when I was a little girl and my father would always sing, 'Figaro!'
'Figaro!' " said Cataldo, who wore a flared black skirt embellished
with silver conches. "He did it for fun, but he loved it and so did
I."</TE>
<TE>   Ortega also cited an early exposure to opera. As a child he often
heard his aunt's opera records and learned to appreciate the genre as
"the only way the human voice could really reach its maximum. It was
like sports: 'As high as you could jump' was like 'as powerful as you
can sing.' That was it for me."</TE>

<LD>For the 700th time I asked Mom if we could have a dog.</LD>
<LD>   Mom was planting flowers in our big yard. "No, Stanley," she said
as she always did. "You know I'm allergic to dogs."</LD>
<LD>   "But Mom," I whined, "we'd keep him out here in the yard all the
time, wouldn't we, Janey?" I poked my little sister, who stood beside
me.</LD>
<TE>   "Mom, he poked me," Janey bawled. She whacked me with the stuffed
dog she was playing with.</TE>
<TE>   "Mom, she hit me," I yelled.</TE>
<TE>   Mom frowned at us. "You kids stop fighting," she said. It was
something she said every day.</TE>
<TE>   "If we had a dog, we wouldn't fight," I grumbled.</TE>
<TE>   Mom sighed and shook her head.</TE>
<TE>   On Saturday she and Dad told us to get into the car.</TE>
<TE>   "Where are we going?" I asked.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a secret," Dad said. He drove until we came to where there
were lots of farms.</TE>
<TE>   Then I saw a sign. It said, "Kids for Sale." Dad turned the car
down the lane where the sign was.</TE>
<TE>   Oh no! Dad and Mom were so tired of our fighting and whining that
they were going to sell Janey and me!</TE>
<TE>   My heart thudded. I reached over to take Janey's hand.</TE>
<TE>   Dad stopped the car by a barn. A smiling lady came toward us. "Are
these the children?" she asked, looking into the back seat.</TE>
<TE>   "Yes," Mom said.</TE>
<TE>   "Mom," I wailed. "Please don't sell us!"</TE>
<TE>   Janey started to whimper.</TE>
<TE>   Mom looked puzzled. "What are you talking about, Stanley?"</TE>
<TE>   I pointed back at the sign. Mom and Dad and the lady laughed.</TE>
<TE>   "Kids are baby goats," the lady said. "Your parents brought you
here to pick out a little goat for a pet."</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not allergic to goats," Mom said.</TE>
<TE>   I smiled at Janey. She smiled at me. "Let's go look," I said.</TE>
<TE>   So now Gideon, our little goat, lives in our big yard. Janey and I
have so much fun playing with him that we don't even think about
fighting.</TE>

<DH>Designer Michael Kreski creates a whimsical world using
trinkets and common items</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUSAN FREUDENHEIM</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>On a recent warm summer evening, a crowd of hip, mostly young
architects and designers poured out of a river of cars and through
the front door of a nondescript apartment building on Little Santa
Monica Boulevard, just west of Beverly Glen. They'd come for an open
house at the home of Michael Kreski, a graphic designer and urban
planner who works in the Santa Monica offices of Gensler, a large
international firm specializing in architecture, design and planning.
At a time when less-is-more has become far less doctrinaire than it
used to be, these young architects love Kreski because his interests
are wide-ranging--anything from cosmonauts to Japanese restaurants
might be his daily touch points--and his creativity takes in both the
incidental and the big picture. At Gensler, Kreski represents a
bridge between the expected and the extraordinary, a player who is
neither famous for his work nor seeking the limelight yet who often
provides the creative spark that enriches a corporate organization
day by day.</LD>
<TE>   "On projects where we have the baseline expectations met, he adds
the jewelry and the magic," says Rick Abelson, a fellow designer at
Gensler. But if that essence is hard to track in the final product of
an architectural process, the heart of Kreski's vision can be seen in
the artful world he's created in his tiny home, a place uniquely
reflective of his all-consuming appetite for new ideas.</TE>
<TE>   On this evening, the first sign of Kreski's presence comes in the
form of a toy train that races out the small apartment's front door
on a track suspended about 6 feet above ground. At regular intervals
of about five to 10 minutes, the train crashes into a barrier about 3
feet from the doorway, then reverses for a return trip back inside.
Occasionally, it falls off the track, but mostly it is purposeful in
its migrations--out into the real world, back into Kreski's.</TE>
<TE>   Inside, Kreski welcomes his guests into his wonderland. He lives
in a one-bedroom, with a kitchen and bath, that amounts to only about
600 square feet. But you would never know how big--or little--the
space is when you enter, because it has been transformed into a
series of narrow, tunnel-like hallways and tiny living-working
spaces, all lined with bookcases and filled with highly organized
clutter. An interweaving network of eight train lines runs overhead,
each one traveling past innumerable vignettes of tiny toys and found
and fabricated objects--artworks and throwaways that crowd the place
beyond imagination.</TE>
<TE>   The shelves that support the structure for this otherworldly web
are filled with books on everything from art, architecture, design
and urban planning to history, philosophy and you-name-it. It is a
sophisticated mix that underlines the intellectual underpinning of
Kreski's environment. No ordinary playground, Kreski's world is a
cross between a child's innocent toyland and the imaginings of a
futuristic visionary inventor. It's also very fun.</TE>
<TE>   On this night, a couple of dozen visitors step lightly through the
maze, pausing at every turn to examine a new discovery. Many bring
gifts to add to the collection. Serving refreshments while squeezing
past his guests to point out some new acquisition, Kreski happily
explains his treasures to anyone who has a question, intermittently
interrupting himself to restart on his TV a series of minute-long
videos about the space that are his latest contribution to his
project.  He explains that he made the fast-paced travelogue films by
placing a mini video camera on the front of a running toy train. As
the camera flies around corners, it records fleeting images of
looming plastic cats and miniature primitive tribes, windmills and
dancing skeletons. With each dizzying turn, his friends roar with
laughter and dismay.</TE>
<TE>   There are only a couple of places to sit down in Kreski's
apartment, among them two chairs in a nook of the tiny living room.
Some might find this environment claustrophobic, but as might be
guessed, Kreski, 51, lives alone here (no one else could really fit),
and the place has just enough to keep this man happy. Seemingly
without cynicism or guile, he points out that there's a fully
outfitted kitchen, a table to eat at, a reading chair, and sleeping
quarters in the back, although the mattress is so scrunched that in
order to lie down, Kreski has to fit his head into a hole in the
bookshelves.</TE>
<TE>   Just above his head (he's 5 feet 9), every inch is taken over by
the ... whatever-you-want-to-call-it--art installation, fantasy world
or, as Kreski has dubbed it, "Railroad Consortium, Blue Cat." Ask
about the name, and, of course, there's a story. It is an hommage to
all his collaborators: "The railroad part of the name is obvious," he
says in his wry, matter-of-fact way. "Consortium refers to the idea
that anyone can contribute--people who come to the open houses are
part of the consortium." And the blue cat refers not only to the
numerous plastic, stuffed and ceramic felines that pop up everywhere
alongside the train tracks, but also to a favorite Japanese comic
book about Mafia members who are also cat lovers. Trains are not the
point, however, Kreski is quick to point out. The tracks are just an
excuse for his "artificial landscapes."</TE>
<TE>   Kreski began the project about six years ago, as a way to animate
his living space and as a motivation for having friends over to enjoy
it. He now holds open houses a couple of times a year. "I'm not that
much of a social person," he says. "I wouldn't usually give parties
or even go to them, but what's nice about this is when people come
here, I have to spend so much time making sure the trains are running
that there's always something for me to do."</TE>
<TE>   He does not think of this as art: "It's not really disciplined
enough to be an artwork," he says. "It's more just an accumulation of
stuff." Although some would argue there's really nothing casual about
the presentation, it is a manifestation of Kreski's taste and
eclectic thought processes.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody wants to create a world of some kind," he says. "People
grow gardens out of the impulse to re-create paradise--a first step
toward making the world better. This is a little like gardening--you
put something in, take something else out. You discover a corner you
didn't know you had that you can fill. It's not like you just stare
at it, you're always changing things."</TE>
<TE>   Every object is filled with stories, many of them hard to
decipher, all of them filled with humor. Kreski still owns things his
mother saved from his grade-school art projects, and a few of these
have become part of the piece, although there's nothing precious
about any of it. Something beloved may well sit next to an object
bought yesterday from a Michaels art supply store, and objects come
and go all the time, he points out.</TE>
<TE>   The joy of it is all in the placement--and the sense of wonder.
Kreski has created a world where everyday objects turned upside-down
become other than what they were intended to be. It is a place where,
for the first time, you might notice the lovely star pattern piercing
a kitchen colander because the object, turned over, now serves the
role of lampshade.</TE>
<TE>   A cast-iron cat, probably once an incense burner, is flanked by a
pair of metal eggbeaters with a wire wok drain floating above like a
TV antenna. Kreski explains: "This is definitely a Santa Barbara
thrift shop special. They had a bin full of kitchenware, where there
was only half of what you needed. Things that once had a function
have become separated from that function, and they're looking around
for something better to do. The cat is a Renaissance Faire item. He's
supposed to stand up, but he's fit into a wire grill and so are the
eggbeaters. He's like the first cat in space."</TE>
<TE>   With every aspect of his home a display, it is not surprising to
learn that Kreski is a lover of World's Fairs and has been to nearly
every one of them he since he went as a child to the 1964 New York
World's Fair. Much as Olympic ceremonies unite the world today, the
vision of the future and of new architecture displayed at World's
Fairs once transfixed huge audiences, and indeed continue to, outside
the United States.</TE>
<TE>   Although the U.S. has long since stopped serious participation in
such events, Kreski never lost interest, and much of his personal
travel has been spent visiting these expositions, from Seoul to
Lisbon. He has also collected a whole wall of books on the fairs and
can talk for hours about them. "One of the fun things about World's
Fairs is they plan the thing overall, but nobody can be exactly sure
what's going to be on any given plot of land," Kreski says. "And
especially the one in New York. [Organizer] Robert Moses said, 'I'm
just going to lease the space to whoever wants it,' so whatever
showed up showed up. They had these things next to each other that
all just kind of made crazy sense."</TE>
<TE>   It's that kind of "crazy sense" that Kreski cultivates in his work
at home and at the office. Born and raised in New Jersey, he got
interested in design in high school and went to the prestigious and
highly innovative Rhode Island School of Design.</TE>
<TE>   After graduation, Kreski did a brief stint as a graphic designer
for the U.S. Bicentennial planning commission for the state of Rhode
Island, designing the logo and some publications. Not much later, he
moved to Atlanta to work on another Bicentennial project and stayed
until the late 1970s, when a childhood friend persuaded him to move
to Los Angeles. "We always thought we should write screenplays,"
Kreski laughs now. So in 1978, he moved to L.A.</TE>
<TE>   The screenplay idea didn't pan out, but Kreski quickly landed a
job at Gruen Associates, a large architecture firm, by answering an
ad in the newspaper. He stayed awhile, then decided he needed to go
to graduate school. Accepted at Harvard's Graduate School of Design,
Kreski moved back East but didn't stay long: "It was not a pleasant
experience," he says. "It was pretty severe; I lasted about a year."
The theoretical study of architecture did not agree with him, he
admits when pressed.</TE>
<TE>   After returning to L.A. in 1986, Kreski moved to Gensler and has
been there ever since. He has worked on a variety of projects, and,
as is often the case in architecture, many of them involved proposals
for big ideas that never came to fruition. He's currently involved,
among a variety of projects, in developing a monorail planned to
connect Las Vegas' casinos--Kreski's job is to help come up with
ideas for the stations and connecting areas between the hotels,
creating attractions that might amuse visitors along the way.</TE>
<TE>   Somehow it all fits perfectly with the "Railroad Consortium" in
his home, a seamless interlocking of real world and fantasy that
helps inspire his co-workers. "The reason I sit next to him is I try
to infuse what he does into the work we do," says Abelson, a fellow
senior associate at Gensler and a design director in the areas of
master planning and cultural attractions.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no such thing as obscure when you have Mike around," adds
Mike Niemann, an architectural designer at Gensler. "Any time you're
looking for something out of the ordinary, Kreski has a whole book on
it. You come up with an idea, and he may know someone in Antarctica
that may have done something related in the 1930s. There is a
sublime, whimsical genius there."</TE>

<LD>Michael Milken--In an article on white-collar crime ("Keating and
Me," Aug. 4), the amount that Michael Milken was fined after pleading
guilty to securities fraud was misstated due to an editing error. He
was fined $200 million in connection with that case. He paid
additional sums to a settlement fund administered by the Securities
and Exchange Commission and to settle civil lawsuits.</LD>

<HD>The Iraq Divide</HD>
<DH>Military action, carefully planned to further our political
goals, is necessary</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHARLES DUELFER</AU>
<BD>Charles Duelfer is a guest scholar at the Center for
Strategic and International Studies and former deputy chairman of the
U.N. Special Commission on Iraq.</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Saddam Hussein certainly understands now that it was a blunder to
invade Kuwait before his scientists had finished building a nuclear
weapon. As weapons inspectors later learned, the Iraqis were much
closer to that goal than had been suspected. Hussein surely also
realizes that there would be no talk of invasion now if he could
threaten American forces or Israel with nuclear incineration. So even
without the reports of ongoing nuclear development in Iraq, it would
be safe to assume Hussein continues to push hard to get a nuclear
weapon.</LD>
<LD>   If he succeeds, then everything will change. Already, countries in
the region are being more accommodating toward Iraq, and that trend
would rapidly accelerate. The U.S. ability to defend its interests
and those of its friends in the region would be severely hampered.
Which country in the region would be willing to have U.S. forces
stationed within its borders? Indeed, would the U.S. risk deploying
troops within range of an Iraqi nuclear weapon?</LD>
<LD>   The stakes have grown too large to bet on another round of modest
U.N. weapons inspections, which might delay but not permanently
divert Baghdad from achieving its objectives.</LD>
<TE>   Likewise, containment is failing. Hussein has successfully
whittled away at U.N. sanctions by, in essence, taking his own
population hostage and saying that unless the international community
loosens up, innocent Iraqi citizens will continue to suffer and die.
The will to coerce compliance from Baghdad has dissipated in the face
of such threats.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. can't stand by and let things further deteriorate. The
basic problem with Iraq is its regime, and all the weapons inspectors
on Earth can't fix that. Still, measures to end the regime must be
carefully considered for potential costs and outcomes.</TE>
<TE>   The nature of a post-Saddam Iraq will depend on how he leaves
power. Changing a government is fundamentally a political--not
military--action. So far the media have focused almost exclusively on
military action--reporting on this or that leaked war plan. But this
kind of focus misses the vital point that military action against
Iraq would be in support of a political objective: a change of
regime. Things were quite different in 1991, when our aim was the
clear military objective of driving forces out of Kuwait.</TE>
<TE>   Today, we need to first formulate solid political goals and then
design military actions aimed at furthering them. Our first objective
should be to distance Hussein and his clique from ordinary Iraqis,
which would of course cause him to try to wrap himself tightly in the
Iraqi flag. Washington needs to make clear that it does not seek to
impose a handpicked leadership on Iraq: only to create circumstances
where Iraqis can change their own leadership. We cannot allow Hussein
to argue that the United States is seeking to place a puppet in
Baghdad. But it must also be made clear that any new government will
be judged by international norms. Iraqis and Iraqi institutions,
including the army, should see their future as brighter under a
different leader. This is a message we should be getting out to
Iraqis at all levels now.</TE>
<TE>   Military planning then needs to be matched to these political
objectives. It may not make sense, for example, to strike the Iraqi
regular army--far better if the army can be convinced that fighting
for the current regime is not fighting for Iraq. Military targets
must be selected to encourage such realizations. Careful coordination
between political goals and military operations will significantly
limit both lives lost and infrastructure damage.</TE>
<TE>   My experience in dealing with Iraqis at all levels has been that
they would like nothing better than to be reconnected with the rest
of the world (including the U.S.), but they are also proud to be
Iraqis. Our political and military aim should be to create
circumstances in which Iraqis will see that the most patriotic
decision they can make is to join with the international community
and actively or passively oppose Hussein.</TE>
<TE>   Setting the stage for this, the United States must continue to
demonstrate that it is absolutely committed to a regime change.
Audiences around the world--but especially in Iraq--must begin to
realize that they will be dealing with a new government in Baghdad.</TE>
<TE>   Hussein will persist in trying to divide the United States from
the rest of the international community. Continuing to offer the hope
of renewed weapons inspections is one such ploy. The United States
can build international support around two simple notions. First,
Iraq under the present regime is uniquely dangerous. It has a long
track record of aggression and has demonstrated its willingness to
use weapons of mass destruction against both external enemies and
Iraqis. Second, given the unique nature of the regime, the Iraqi
people will be able to change their government only with outside
intervention. The Iraqis are an energetic and talented people, who
through the accident of birth, live under horrible leadership. They
will never achieve their enormous potential under Hussein.</TE>
<TE>   The United States and other countries can help the Iraqis shape a
new government by agreeing on specific standards by which to judge a
new government in Baghdad. Progress toward these standards would
serve as a basis for decisions on such things as removing sanctions,
establishing security relationships and providing debt relief.</TE>
<TE>   The United States has come under criticism internationally by
those who fault it for arrogance in seeking to overthrow a government
it doesn't like. But the United States has a unique leadership role.
We do not have the luxury of counting on someone else to fix the Iraq
problem if we get it wrong. Are the French willing to deploy whatever
force is needed to react to future Iraqi aggression--potentially
backed by nuclear bombs--if we don't act now?</TE>
<TE>   The United States must try to build international accord but also
be prepared to ultimately act alone. We must be ready to put whatever
military force is necessary on the ground--always keeping in mind
that the fundamental objective is to defeat a regime, not an army.
Judging by his ruthless 1991 strategy of placing hostages at military
targets and palaces, Hussein is likely to surround himself and his
security forces with civilians. But this tactic could backfire,
drawing the Iraqi people to our side.</TE>
<TE>   Our political objectives demand that we make a clear distinction
between Iraq and its despotic leader. Military planning should be
aimed at separating him from the Iraqi civilians who have effectively
become his hostages. It should be clear to the world and to the
Iraqis themselves that, without Hussein, a strong, vibrant Iraq could
take its place in the international community.</TE>

<BD>Barbara Ehrenreich is the author, most recently, of
"Nickel and Dimed: On (Not) Getting By in America."</BD>
<DL>KEY WEST, Fla.</DL>
<LD>It's not only the stock market that has the upper classes biting
their fingernails. In the last several weeks, the low-fat, high-carb
way of life that was central to the self-esteem of the affluent has
been all but discredited. If avarice was the principal vice of the
bourgeoisie, a commitment to low fat was its counterbalancing virtue.
You can bet, for example, that those CEOs who cooked the books and
ransacked their companies' assets did not start the day with two eggs
over easy, a rasher of bacon and a side of hash browns. No,
unbuttered low-fat muffins and delicate slices of melon fueled the
crimes of Wall Street: Grease was for proles.</LD>
<LD>   But that dogma is now in doubt. A growing number of
nutritionists--and the media, led by a July 7 New York Times magazine
story--now question whether the low-fat approach will really make you
slim and resistant to heart disease. In fact, the American epidemic
of obesity coincides precisely with the arrival of the anti-fat
campaign in the 1980s, accompanied by a cornucopia of low-fat
cookies, cakes, potato chips and frozen pot roast dinners. Millions
of Americans began to pig out on "guilt-free" feasts of ungarnished
carbs--with perverse and often debilitating results, especially among
those unable to afford health club memberships and long hours on the
elliptical trainer.</LD>
<TE>   I have confirmed these findings with my own scientific study,
which draws on a sample of exactly two: Jane Brody, the New York
Times health columnist and tireless opponent of all foodstuffs other
than veggies and starch, and me. It was Brody, more than anyone, who
promoted the low-fat way of life to the masses, from the '80s on,
with headlines like "Our Excessive Protein Intake Can Hurt Liver,
Kidneys, Bone," "Fill Up on Bread to Lose Weight" and "Chemicals in
Food Less Harmful Than Fat."</TE>
<TE>   As she revealed in a 1999 column, Brody was herself raised on a
high-carb, low-fat diet of "shredded wheat, oatmeal, challah, Jewish
rye and bagels," the last, presumably, unblemished by the customary
"shmear" of cream cheese. I, meanwhile, was raised on a diet that
might strain even an Inuit's gall bladder. We ate eggs every morning,
meat for lunch and meat again for dinner, invariably accompanied by
gravy or at least pan drippings. We buttered everything from broccoli
to brownies and would have buttered butter itself if it were not for
the problems of traction presented by the butter-butter interface.</TE>
<TE>   And how did Brody and I exit from our dietarily opposite
childhoods? She, by her own admission, was a veritable butterball by
her mid-20s--a size 14 at just under 5 feet tall. I, at 5 feet 7,
weighed in at a gaunt and geeky 110 pounds.</TE>
<TE>   Fast-forwarding to the present: We assume Brody is now admirably
trim, if only because of her exercise regimen, since otherwise she
wouldn't have dared to promote the low-fat dogma in person. For my
part, I no longer butter my brownies, perhaps in part because of
Brody's tireless preaching. But the amount of fat she recommends for
an entire day--one tablespoon--wouldn't dress a small salad for me or
lubricate a single Triscuit. I still regard bread as a vehicle for
butter and chicken as an excuse for gravy or, when served cold,
mayonnaise. The result? I'm a size 6 and have a cholesterol level
that an envious doctor once denounced as "too low." Case closed.</TE>
<TE>   But if that doesn't convince you, Dr. Barry Sears, inventor of
"The Zone" high protein diet, has been arguing for years that there's
a solid medical explanation for why the low-fat, high-carb approach
is actually fattening. A meal of carbs--especially those derived from
sugar and refined flour--is followed by a surge of blood sugar, then,
as insulin is released in response, a sudden collapse, leaving you
often lightheaded, cranky, headachy and certainly hungrier than
before you ate. Fats and protein can make you fat too, of course, if
ingested in sufficient quantity, but at least they fulfill the
conventional role of anything designated as a foodstuff, which is to
say that they leave you feeling like you've actually eaten something.</TE>
<TE>   As long as people want to lose weight, we'll probably have dueling
diet doctors. But now that it's apparent that the prevailing low-fat
wisdom may be bunk, why would anyone opt for Jane Brody over Barry
Sears?</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps because facts don't matter when a dogma so flattering to
the affluent is at stake. In the last couple of decades, the low-fat
way of life has become an important indicator of social rank, along
with whole-grain--as opposed to white--bread and natural fibers
versus polyester. If you doubt this, consider the multiple meanings
of "grease," as in "greaser" and "greasy spoon." Among the
nutritionally "correct" upper-middle-class people of my acquaintance,
a dinner of French bread and pasta has long been considered a
suitable offering for guests--followed by a plate of bone-dry
biscotti. And don't bother asking for the butter.</TE>
<TE>   What has made the low-fat dogma especially impervious to critique,
though, is the overclass identification of low-fat with virtue and
fat with the long-suspected underclass tendency to self-indulgence.
Low-fat is the flip side of avarice for a reason: Thanks to America's
deep streak of puritanism--perhaps mixed with a dollop of democratic
idealism--ours has been a culture in which everyone wants to be rich
but no one wants to be known as a "fat cat." We might be hogging the
Earth's resources, the affluent seem to be saying, but at least we're
not indulging the ancient human craving for fat. So the low-fat diet
has been the hair shirt under the fur coat--the daily deprivation
that offsets the endless greed.</TE>
<TE>   I wouldn't go so far as to blame the financial shenanigans of the
last few years on Brody, but clearly there is a connection. The
long-term effects of a low-fat, low-protein diet are easy to guess--a
perpetual feeling of insatiety, a relentless, gnawing, hunger for
more. No doubt, for many thousands of low-fat, high-earnings people,
money became a substitute, however unfulfilling, for dietary fat. The
effect was naturally strongest in Silicon Valley, where dot-com mania
collided with the Northern California, Berkeley-based carbo cult, to
disastrous effect. That "irrational exuberance" of the late '90s was
in fact the giddiness of hypoglycemia, induced by a diet of boutique
muffins and $5-a-loaf "artisan bread."</TE>
<TE>   My advice to the fat-deprived yuppies who are now watching their
fortunes melt away: Take a break from the markets and go out and get
yourself a bacon cheeseburger and fries or, if you still have a few
bucks to toss around, a nice pancetta-rich plate of spaghetti
carbonara. Eat every last drop. Then lean back, with the grease
dripping down your chin, smile at the people around you, and
appreciate, perhaps for the very first time, what it feels like to
have enough.</TE>

<AU>NEAL GABLER</AU>
<BD>Neal Gabler, a senior fellow at the Norman Lear Center
at USC Annenberg, is the author of "Life the Movie: How Entertainment
Conquered Reality."</BD>
<DL>AMAGANSETT, N.Y.</DL>
<LD>The recent sight of 77-year-old John J. Rigas, the former Adelphia
Communications CEO, being led away in handcuffs by federal
authorities was clearly intended by the Bush administration to
reinforce its view of the epidemic of corporate malfeasance. Rigas is
allegedly one of the "bad apples" spoiling the whole business barrel.
His greed undermined his company and U.S. capitalism itself. If he is
convicted and incarcerated, confidence will be restored.</LD>
<LD>   Greed certainly exists in the corporate world, and there have been
plenty of instances of it recently. But the emphasis on greed, which
serves the purposes of politicians and corporate America, raises one
big question: Why now? Presumably, people have always been greedy, so
why haven't executives always binged at their stockholders' and
employees' expense?</LD>
<TE>   Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, in his testimony before
Congress last month, answered that while greed is a human constant
and executives are no more greedy in the 21st century than before,
there are now more opportunities to indulge it. He is not altogether
wrong. Excessive stock options and corporate accounting practices
practically encourage executives to raid their companies' coffers,
though that too raises a big question. Why was the system re-rigged
to provide these opportunities for executive self-enrichment and why
hadn't anyone thought of it before?</TE>
<TE>   There is yet another problem with the greed analysis. It doesn't
really explain the scale of the financial diversions. Former Enron
CEO Kenneth L. Lay took $81.5 million in loan advances from the
company; former Tyco chief executive L. Dennis Kozlowski reportedly
received $135 million in forgiven loans and company payments for real
estate, charitable donations and personal expenses; former WorldCom
CEO Bernard J. Ebbers an estimated $408 million in loans from his
company; and Rigas and his three sons $2.3 billion in
off-balance-sheet loans from their company that they used, among
other things, to build themselves a $13-million, 18-hole golf course.
Even allowing for inflation, this would be robbery on a colossal and
unprecedented scale. No one needs 18 homes and properties owned by
Lay or a personal golf course or a $6,000 shower curtain that
Kozlowski had installed in his New York apartment. Greed may be
greed, but this kind of acquisitiveness seems to go beyond mere
greed.</TE>
<TE>   There is a far less-comforting explanation: All these shenanigans
have less to do with greed than with what the social theorist
Thorstein Veblen called "conspicuous consumption." In this analysis,
the alleged corporate plunderers were raking in their hundreds of
millions of dollars not primarily to provide themselves with security
or ease or even extravagance, but to support a grand display of
wealth that would impress investors, the media and other business
executives and demonstrate that they belonged. This wasn't greed.
This was showmanship. They wanted to be Masters of the Universe.</TE>
<TE>   In a sense, even though the "bad apples" were victimizers, they
were also victims of a new business mentality and a new set of
corporate priorities. Traditionally, America's CEOs were like the
Bushes: pallid, Ivy League-educated men in club ties, pinstriped
Brooks Brothers suits and wingtip shoes. Like their wardrobe, they
conveyed a conservative sense of decorum and propriety that dictated
they not be seen or heard and that they not court the media.</TE>
<TE>   These mandarins certainly had their wealth, and it was large. They
had their clubs, their mansions, their summer homes, their yachts and
their circle of similarly well-heeled and influential friends, but
these men knew their paramount place in the social cosmos, and so did
everyone else. Their possessions were the perquisites of success, not
an attempt to certify it.</TE>
<TE>   As far as their relationships to their companies were concerned,
these men served their businesses and were compensated accordingly.
And so it would continue until they retired to the status of
emeritus. To the extent they were symbols of their companies, they
signified stability and soundness. They were solid men who wouldn't
countenance corporate hanky-panky and didn't need to indulge in it
themselves because they had both the money and the status that were
automatically conferred by the governance of big business, not to
mention by birth.</TE>
<TE>   These sorts of chieftains are still found in U.S. business, but
there are fewer of them. The U.S. economy has shifted from being
largely industrial to one that is service-oriented and technological.
To survive, major companies must be light-footed and sensitive to
innovation, which puts a premium on fast-thinking, fast-moving
business buccaneers. At the same time, the economic emphasis has
shifted from stability, which favored old-fashioned plutocrats, to
growth, which favors young Turks eager to acquire, merge and
consolidate.</TE>
<TE>   As a result of these changes and of changes in U.S. demographics
generally, the new corporate world is not as insular as it once was,
when the baton of management was passed from one blueblood to the
next, from one generation to the next, and everyone was a member of
the same WASP club. Rigas, the son of Greek immigrants, served in the
infantry in World War II, then attended Rensselaer Polytechnic
Institute, not the Harvard Business School, before parlaying a small
investment in a movie theater into a cable television empire. Ebbers
was a two-time college dropout who worked as a milkman and a bouncer
before entering the business world. Kozlowski, the son of a police
detective, worked his way through Seton Hall University waiting
tables and playing guitar in a wedding band. Even Lay, the aristocrat
of this bunch, earned his degree at the University of Missouri and a
doctorate from the University of Houston before entering the Navy.</TE>
<TE>   These weren't nobles, secure in their positions and their caste.
These were ambitious young men from the ranks of the middle class who
had to prove their worth both within their companies and outside
them--companies that were themselves newcomers trying to muscle their
way into the corporate landscape.</TE>
<TE>   The most obvious way to do so was by engineering spectacular
growth, which was what investors demanded, and all these men did just
that. But by the 1980s, there was another, complementary option. They
could earn investor confidence by flaunting their personal fortunes
and then impute that display to the company. Virtually no one in the
1950s, '60s or '70s knew who the chiefs of industry were, much less
how well they lived or how much money they made. In truth, no one
cared to know, and the mandarins didn't need anyone to know. They
knew how much they had.</TE>
<TE>   But in the 1980s, a new virus of celebrity infected the country,
one feature of which was the "celebritization" of wealth. In a
society where celebrity was suddenly considered the most exalted
state one could achieve, the rich discovered that a large fortune and
an extravagant lifestyle would bring media attention--witness that TV
paragon of 1980s overindulgence, "Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous."
Now that celebrity had become a source of power, previously obscure
titans of industry, from Lee Iacocca to Donald Trump, began bidding
for stardom, too. In fact, the business world practically demanded
it.</TE>
<TE>   This chase for recognition was the personal equivalent to botox
economics--the idea that a corporate balance sheet must look good
rather than actually be good. In effect, CEOs needed that money,
however they got it, or they would be marginalized. Corporate
executives who displayed their wealth and lived grandly would get the
magazine covers (and not just of the business magazines), the
television profiles, the constant mentions on CNBC, the bestsellers
advising other executives how to do it, the invitations to the
corporate conclaves at which one rubbed shoulders with the other
superstars of business and a place high on the list of the movers and
shakers of America.</TE>
<TE>   Moreover, this sort of stardom had economic value for the
executives' companies. It made Rigas, Lay, Ebbers and the others
players at the big corporate table and gave Enron, WorldCom, Adelphia
et al. much greater visibility, though it also changed the
traditional relationship between CEOs and their companies. Not so
long ago executives served their companies. Now the companies served
the executives. Or as Kozlowski was fond of saying, "Money is the
only way to keep score."</TE>
<TE>   This matters because it locates corporate corruption not in the
rotten soul of some overzealous CEO but deep in the soul of modern
American culture. That makes it much more difficult to extirpate. You
can use the stick of criminal prosecution to bring offenders to
justice, but it is likely to be of limited effectiveness when the
business world itself, like the rest of society, continues to hold
out the carrot of stardom. As much as Americans want corporate
responsibility to reassert itself, to do so the country may need to
change its own set of priorities that just a few months before their
indictments had the media singing the praises of Kozlowski and Rigas.</TE>

<DH>Before debating strategy for the war, let's ask whether it
should be fought</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JACK W. GERMOND</AU>
<BD>Jack W. Germond is a political writer in Washington,
D.C.</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The folks in the White House seem to be having a dizzy spell these
days. They are trying to convince Americans that the country should
invest as many as 200,000 troops and some $20 billion a year to
unseat Saddam Hussein.</LD>
<LD>   If they succeed, the war they wage might both defeat Iraq and,
depending on how it plays out, substantially harm President Bush's
chance for reelection.</LD>
<LD>   The White House seems to be proceeding on the premise that
Americans generally share Bush's preoccupation--bordering on
obsession--with Iraq. Republicans cite opinion polls showing that
most voters agree the Hussein regime should be replaced and give Bush
high approval ratings. But poll-takers concede this is tricky ground.
"Supporting the president" is one thing; enduring a war with
significant casualties and huge costs is quite another--particularly
during a period of economic upheaval.</LD>
<TE>   There has been a flood of leaks recently in the debate over Iraq.
We've heard reports (conspicuously lacking in evidence) of a shadowy
installation near Baghdad that may be a site for manufacturing
biological weapons; other reports have suggested the imminence of
Iraq's nuclear threat.</TE>
<TE>   The leaks grabbing the biggest headlines, though, have been about
war plans. One report has it that the project could involve 250,000
troops, $200 billion and 10 years of occupation. Another says it
could be done with a relative handful of young Americans in a couple
of years--assuming, of course, allies join the effort. There are
reports it will be an air war. Or it will be a land war. An urban
war. A desert war. But the one message that comes through loud and
clear despite the conflicting leaks is this: There will be a war.</TE>
<TE>   Bush continues to insist that no plan to wage war against Iraq has
reached his desk, as if the idea of attacking Hussein were just
another option floating around in the foreign policy ether. But the
fact is that Bush has been championing the idea since he defined
Iraq, Iran and North Korea as "the axis of evil" and White House
briefers made it clear that an attack on Baghdad would be the first
priority in dealing with that axis.</TE>
<TE>   It is a bizarre--wacky might be more accurate--situation: a
president of the United States declaring his intention to conduct a
war, then trying to rally support from both his constituents at home
and his allies abroad.</TE>
<TE>   The latter, even including British Prime Minister Tony Blair, are
resisting. Nor have Americans been fully persuaded that there is a
clear and present danger from Hussein. Some are so uncharitable as to
suspect that Bush's determination to oust the Iraqi leader is driven
by a need to atone for his father's failure to drive on to Baghdad 11
years ago.</TE>
<TE>   That, of course, is the crux of the matter. Does Bush have the
credibility to portray an attack on Iraq as the logical next step in
"the war on terrorism"?</TE>
<TE>   At this point, unhappily for Bush, there is no evidence of an
Iraqi role in the operations of Osama bin Laden. Nor is there any
reason to believe that Hussein is any more threatening than he has
been for the last 10 years. Nonetheless, by depicting all the debate
within the government as centering on when and how--but not if--the
United States is going to attack Baghdad, the Bush administration has
created a climate here in which an attack seems inevitable.</TE>
<TE>   Bush himself keeps talking about how the Iraqi people are likely
to be so overjoyed at their new freedom that they would turn on
Saddam Hussein at the first red glare of a rocket. American
presidents always seem infused with such optimism, only to discover
that the locals are much less grateful than we had hoped for the
bombs that come raining down on them.</TE>
<TE>   In recent weeks, I've heard supporters of aggression point to the
operation against Grenada in 1983 as evidence that Americans will
applaud displays of the national muscle in a good cause. They recall,
correctly, that even many liberals were beating their breasts and
roaring their approval.</TE>
<TE>   But that military operation was the rough equivalent of conquering
Allentown, Pa. The casualties, after all, were largely hapless
patients in a mental hospital that was accidentally shelled. The
whole Grenada operation lasted less than a week and was carried out
in the name of anti-communism--farfetched as that may seem now. Its
stated purpose was to "rescue" some American medical students
putatively in trouble. It was done without serious risk to our
troops. And it was led by a president, Ronald Reagan, who had far
more credibility playing John Wayne than his successors. Moreover, as
it turned out, many of those who applauded at the time later had
second thoughts.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the talk of plans and counter-plans, of this or that
model, there is in fact no real debate at all. The Democrats,
trotting out their universal approach to all conundrums, have held
some Senate hearings. The talk on Capitol Hill centers on what if any
strings should be put on the president's authority to attack Iraq: No
one seems to be discussing whether Iraq should be attacked at all.</TE>
<TE>   The Democrats--and the country as a whole--should not be
intimidated by uncertain times into accepting Bush's insistence that
we are involved in a full-scale war on terrorism and that going after
Iraq is part of that battle. And the president should keep in mind
that most Americans go about their lives far more concerned about
their jobs than about the axis of evil.</TE>

<HD>Power Play: Big Energy vs. Solar</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID HOCHSCHILD and ARLIE HOCHSCHILD</AU>
<BD>David Hochschild is co-founder of the Vote Solar
Initiative, an organization dedicated to helping cities implement
solar energy programs. His mother, Arlie Hochschild, is a professor
of sociology at UC Berkeley and author of "The Time Bind."</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>Since we each installed solar panels on the roofs of our homes two
years ago, we, like a growing number of other Californians, have
witnessed a daily miracle. In the garage of each house is a small
meter. At night it spins forward (showing that we are drawing
electricity from the state power grid). Once the sun strikes the
roof, it spins in reverse (showing that we are supplying clean energy
to the grid). When those meters spin backward, they don't simply show
a reverse flow of electricity, they show a small revolution in our
relationship to the environment.</LD>
<LD>   Solar energy improves the quality of the air we breathe, reduces
our dependence on fossil fuels and feeds energy into the grid when we
need it most--when air conditioners are straining an already shaky,
blackout-prone system. But all this progress may be imperiled if the
California Assembly takes up AB 58 as scheduled Monday.</LD>
<LD>   That's because California's three big utilities--Southern
California Edison, Pacific Gas &amp; Electric and Sempra Energy
Resources--want to deal a blow to the state's "net metering," law,
which allows consumers with solar panels to connect to the grid.</LD>
<TE>   The current law allows homeowners, businesses and government
agencies with solar energy systems up to 1 megawatt in size to send
surplus electricity they generate back to the utility for credit at
retail value. In other words, the law allows customers to offset the
energy consumed from the grid with excess energy they produce but
don't need at that moment. For homeowners, excess power is produced
during the day while most of them are at work. For businesses and
government agencies, excess power is produced on holidays and
weekends. The law has proved a powerful method of promoting solar
energy, sparking a 1,000% increase in the number of large solar
energy systems in California in the last year alone.</TE>
<TE>   Net metering does not require the utilities to cut a check to
customers who produce electricity (although that would be a good
idea). Both solar energy and increased energy efficiency--a principle
the utilities accept--simply reduce the amount of electricity we need
from the grid. The difference is that with solar panels on their
roofs, Californians can become energy-independent.</TE>
<TE>   The Big Three utilities fought net metering when it was introduced
in 1995. In 2001, during the height of the energy crisis, they fought
expanding the program to include commercial, agricultural and
local-government-size systems, pushing through a last-minute change
that limited the time the program would be in place. Now, AB 58, by
Assemblyman Fred Keeley (D-Boulder Creek), would extend the law
allowing net metering of large solar systems past the end of this
year, when it is due to expire. Contrary to Keeley's intent, the
utilities have amended the bill in a way that would effectively
double the amount of time a solar energy system takes to pay for
itself by lowering the rate that utilities pay for the energy.</TE>
<TE>   In hijacking AB 58 the utilities are ignoring the wishes of
California voters. Like 90% of other Americans polled recently,
California voters overwhelmingly support solar energy. In fact, the
utilities are the only major force in California organizing to stunt
solar. They are not waging a public campaign against AB 58--which is
why you haven't heard about it. Instead, they've organized a
back-channel campaign among legislators.</TE>
<TE>   Why? The utilities know we're not yet out of the woods on the
energy crisis. Just last month, the state experienced a Stage 2
energy alert. Moreover, the fallout from Enron and the current
economic downturn have caused the cancellation of half of the new
natural gas power plants slated for construction.</TE>
<TE>   To be fair, the utilities claim that net metering is an
administrative headache because it requires a separate billing
system. They also claim that solar panels create a financial burden
on nonsolar customers, as their rates rise to cover the purchase of
solar at retail rates But they are misstating the facts. The version
of net metering they are advancing in amendments to AB 58--which
would require customers to install an additional meter and receive
lower, wholesale rates--is more difficult to administer, not less so.
As for a financial burden on nonsolar customers, according to figures
provided by the utilities themselves, the cost is less than a penny
per customer per month. And when we consider the avoided expense of
not having to build new transmission lines to meet increased peak
demand on the grid, it may actually turn out to save money.</TE>
<TE>   It's not that the utilities don't recognize the promise of solar
energy: It's that they do. The utilities are afraid that if we get
even a small degree of benefit from technologies like solar energy,
we will cut into their profit margins. And they spend money to get
their way. According to a recent study by the Center for Public
Integrity, the three big utilities spent "$69 million on political
spending and lobbying between 1994 and 2000." In the realm of energy,
the nation is at a crossroads. Nuclear energy poses risks, and
pollution from coal, oil and natural-gas-fired power plants is the
leading cause of global warming. Solar energy, wind power and
conservation offer another path.</TE>
<TE>   Solar energy, in particular, is at a critical stage of growth.
Until recently, solar was too expensive for mass use. But the more
solar panels consumers buy, the cheaper they become. Every time the
cumulative demand for solar energy doubles, the price of a solar
panel goes down by about 20%. Since California represents 60% of the
market for solar energy in the United States, if the demand collapses
here, it will be a colossal setback to the effort to cut costs
through improved economies of scale.</TE>
<TE>   In 2001, San Francisco voters approved a $100-million bond to pay
for solar panels on public buildings, the largest purchase of solar
energy in the country. But if the utilities get their way and reduce
incentives, what other city or large business will follow suit? Local
governments and businesses, which have recently developed plans to
implement solar energy based on their faith in net metering, may
abandon these efforts.</TE>
<TE>   California led the way to large-scale net metering, creating a
model for other states. Now that three big utilities want to weaken
AB 58, we must be a model to the country in something
else--protecting our initiatives by stopping stealthy moves to
undermine them.</TE>

<AU>ROBERT MALLEY and JOHN NORRIS</AU>
<BD>Robert Malley was special assistant to President
Clinton for Arab-Israeli affairs and is currently Middle East program
director at the International Crisis Group. John Norris is special
advisor to the president of the group.</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Iran's revolution is approaching its quarter-century anniversary, and
some in Washington seem to be yearning for an encore. Their reasons
are manifold: concern about Tehran's continued support for Hezbollah
in Lebanon, anxiety about its purported development of weapons of
mass destruction and dismay that Iran's reformers have either lost
the battle to the conservatives or never genuinely intended to wage
it.</LD>
<LD>   As a result, they believe that the best catalysts for change in
Iran are Iranians dissatisfied with their economic condition and
eager for democracy. In short, they seem to be counting on a second
Iranian popular upheaval--against the clerics the first one brought
to power.</LD>
<LD>   There is considerable reason for the international community, not
to mention Iranians themselves, to be frustrated with the situation
in Iran. The overwhelming election in 1997 of President Mohammad
Khatami, a liberal cleric, and his reelection in 2001, coupled with a
string of victories by pro-reform candidates in parliamentary and
local elections, seemed to herald a new chapter in the country's
history.</LD>
<TE>   Yet, powerful conservative clerics and security officials retain
control of key centers of power, including the military, intelligence
services and the judiciary. They use covert means to circumvent their
rivals' nominal management of foreign policy. Khatami has been unable
to undertake meaningful economic reform, significantly curb the power
of the security services or open up the system to allow genuine
freedom of speech and political participation. Iranians suffer from
political repression, censorship and the arbitrary dispensing of
justice.</TE>
<TE>   Real democratic advances, in other words, have yet to produce
fundamental policy shifts in Iran. The ties between conservatives and
reformers are complex; neither group is homogenous and both have been
forced to compromise to preserve the regime's stability. Ultimately,
the difference between them is probably not as great as originally
hoped.</TE>
<TE>   But the difference between the two camps is almost certainly not
as small as currently feared. Reformers continue to expand the space
within which civil society can operate, understanding that the
overall public momentum for reform is their greatest resource.</TE>
<TE>   Under Khatami, both the number of authorized newspapers and their
circulation have quadrupled. These advances have produced a limited,
but noteworthy, relaxation of social restrictions, more frequent
contacts with the outside world and the government's de facto
acceptance of ideological and religious dissent, despite repeated and
heavy-handed attempts to suppress its most potent expression. Forms
of democracy unknown to the rest of the Middle East have appeared,
and the once all-powerful conservative clerical elite must contend
with competing actors and institutions.</TE>
<TE>   How this clash will play out is difficult to predict, making it
tough to define how the international community should respond. The
policy of critical dialogue--coupling engagement with the Iranian
government with expressions of concern about human rights, support
for terrorism and weapons of mass destruction--has not yielded
conclusive results. Outright intervention in favor of the reformers
may seem logical, yet it risks exposing them to the accusation of
being agents of foreign design.</TE>
<TE>   But one thing appears evident: A policy that depicts Iran as part
of an "axis of evil," lumps reformers and conservatives together and
banks on a popular uprising by the Iranian people will at best be
ineffective and at worse will backfire. It is based on two faulty
assumptions: that conservatives have neutralized the reformers, and
that there is a clear divide between an entrenched and uniform
"regime," on the one hand, and a dissatisfied populace, on the other.
Yet, unlike the situation that existed in the 1970s under the shah,
the current regime enjoys genuine support from considerable segments
of the population, including some who strongly object to its
policies.</TE>
<TE>   A policy of wholesale denunciation of Iran underestimates the
important political battles occurring in the country's leadership. It
glosses over the significant differences between the conservatives
and the reformers. It constricts the political space in which the
reformers can operate and undercuts the democratic process that twice
led to Khatami's victory. Such an approach may have the unintended
effect of forcing reformers to close ranks with the conservatives in
the name of national unity, thereby facilitating the hard-liners'
efforts to perpetuate a domestic climate of crisis that allows them
to justify draconian security measures.</TE>
<TE>   The burden of bringing Iran fully back into the mainstream of the
community of nations must principally fall on the shoulders of
Iranians. But the U.S. and the West can greatly facilitate, or
hinder, this process. They should insist that Iran meet its
obligations to act as a responsible international player and remain
willing to engage the country more constructively on political,
economic and social policy fronts.</TE>
<TE>   The political struggle within the country, and the strong
expression of views to which it is giving rise, is unparalleled in
the Middle East. In that sense, the country's political evolution
concerns more than its own people. How Iranian and international
actors deal with this battle for the revolution's soul will be of
critical importance to the region as a whole.</TE>

<AU>TONY QUINN</AU>
<BD>Tony Quinn is co-editor of the California Target Book,
a nonpartisan analysis of California's legislative and congressional
elections.</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>James Michael Curley, running for reelection as mayor of Boston from
prison, once famously said, "If I'm willing to go to jail for my
friends, think of what I'll do for the good people of Boston."
California GOP gubernatorial candidate Bill Simon Jr. is practically
reduced to running on the theme, "If I'll defraud a drug dealer,
think of what I'll do for the good people of California."</LD>
<LD>   The Simon candidacy, which could turn out to be one of the great
fiascoes of recent political history, has all the characteristics of
the amateur who thinks he should be governor and runs a campaign to
prove why he shouldn't.</LD>
<LD>   Since his upset win in the March GOP primary, it has been mostly
downhill for Simon. During the primary campaign, we learned that he
rarely voted, had not even been a Republican until recently and gave
a huge campaign contribution to San Francisco Mayor Willie Brown, a
Democrat. Lately, we have learned that an offshore tax shelter used
by Simon's family may be illegal and that he refused to release his
tax returns, an obligatory act for any serious candidate. When Simon
relented and disclosed his returns, we learned, much to everyone's
shock, that the rich candidate wasn't nearly as rich as everyone
thought.</LD>
<TE>   Amateur candidates often have skeletons in their closets but
rarely a mortuary. Late last month, a jury levied $78 million in
damages for fraud and other misconduct against Simon's family
investment company. For a candidate who touts his business
credentials, the case is particularly embarrassing. Not only was the
company's investment in Pacific Coin ruinous, but Simon also
personally lost $1.2 million. Furthermore, the plaintiff in the case
and founder of Pacific Coin, Paul Edward Hindelang Jr., pleaded
guilty in 1981 to charges of smuggling 500,000 pounds of marijuana
into the United States.</TE>
<TE>   But drug dealers are bipartisan this season. In Texas, the great
Latino hope to restore that state's frayed Democratic Party,
multimillionaire businessman Tony Sanchez, has been accused of
running a bank in Laredo in the mid-1980s that was used by Mexican
dope dealers to launder millions in drug money.</TE>
<TE>   Both Sanchez and Simon have denied knowingly doing business with
drug dealers. That may be true. For example, Simon says he found out
about Hindelang's criminal past only after the deal with Pacific Coin
was struck. But both candidates knew of the charges when they chose
to run for governor. Apparently, Sanchez and Simon believed that the
issue would never come up or, if it did, the voters would just
overlook it.</TE>
<TE>   This is the scourge of the amateur in politics: a tone-deafness to
the intricacies of politics. For the Democrats in Texas, who today
hold no statewide office, and Republicans in California, who are
trying to avoid extinction as a major political party, this is bad
news. But you cannot say both parties were not forewarned, for the
amateurs who went before Sanchez and Simon left a well-marked trail.</TE>
<TE>   The record for self-destructing rookie candidates for governor has
to be held by an affable millionaire affectionately remembered as
"Claytie." Clayton W. Williams Jr. bought himself the Republican
nomination for governor of Texas in 1990 and began the race far ahead
of his competitor. Claytie then shot himself in the foot and, as a
commentator later put it, continued right up from there. Best
remembered was his comment about rape: "If it's inevitable, just
relax and enjoy it." After spending millions of his own money, he
lost to state Treasurer Ann Richards.</TE>
<TE>   California's version of Claytie was Al Checchi, a former Northwest
Airlines co-chairman who boasted a fortune of $550 million. He spent
$38.9 million trying to buy the Democratic gubernatorial nomination
in 1998 and is best remembered for a huge negative campaign that
trashed "my principal opponent," Rep. Jane Harman. The mudslinging
opened the door for then-Lt. Gov. Gray Davis to win the primary in a
landslide. Checchi's millions bought him about 13% of the vote.</TE>
<TE>   There's a difference, albeit subtle but important, between the
amateur and the experienced first-time candidate. Dwight D.
Eisenhower started his political career at the top when he ran for
president in 1952. But he had commanded the greatest military
operation in human history. Democrats sneered at Ronald Reagan when
he ran for governor of California in 1966, but they overlooked the
facts that he had had a long career as a political activist following
his stint in Hollywood and had made his political name when he gave a
famous speech endorsing Sen. Barry Goldwater for president in 1964.</TE>
<TE>   Claytie's failure in Texas opened the door for another newcomer
starting at the top, one also underestimated by his Democratic foes.
George W. Bush defeated Richards for governor in 1994. But again,
Bush had been intimately involved with his father's presidency and
had been around politics most of his life.</TE>
<TE>   The tough lesson that Republicans in California and Democrats in
Texas are learning this election year is that a candidate with no
ostensible political past cannot be vetted for skeletons. Simon
became the darling of ideological right-wing Republicans by simply
proclaiming himself a "proud conservative." Texas Democrats placed
their hopes in a candidate who was a big Bush supporter four years
ago.</TE>
<TE>   California Republicans are likely to rue the day they let an
amateur win their nomination. The early favorite, former Los Angeles
Mayor Richard Riordan, led Davis by six points in early polling.
Simon even led Davis for a while. But now Republicans seem destined
to find that voters are unforgiving about a candidate's involvement
with a drug smuggler, especially when the candidate's defense is that
he did not know anything about it.</TE>

<BD>Amy Wilentz is the author, most recently, of "Martyrs'
Crossing: A Novel."</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>At a recent U.N.-sponsored conference in Copenhagen on peace in the
Middle East, I was shaken at how old-fashioned and out of touch the
peaceniks seem now, isolated on a planet and in a time warp of their
own. Back in the old days, the peace camp had lofty goals and a
plausible agenda; now, it seems like any other special-interest
group, a bunch of sadly familiar figures pushing a recondite
objective, using an idiosyncratic and shopworn language that
corresponds to no other, a whole lexicon of terms, of tropes,
conventions, formulas, code words and shorthand that hardly any but
the expert can interpret.</LD>
<LD>   They measure history in an encrypted atlas: Madrid, Oslo (I and
II), Camp David (I and II), the White House lawn (famous to them for
"the handshake"), Wye Plantation, Taba (I and II). Violence too has
its nicknames, which get traded around at peace conferences like
Chance cards in Monopoly: Baruch Goldstein, the No. 18 bus (one and
two), Dizengoff Center, the central bus station (one, two, three and
four), Mohammed Dura, Shalhevet Pass, and now the Dolphinarium,
Passover, Jenin, Salah Shehada, Frank Sinatra cafeteria.</LD>
<LD>   The participants talk about resolution number this and resolution
number that, and about timetables, breakdowns, deadlines and cutoff
dates. They babble vainly on.</LD>
<TE>   And yet, I count myself among them, more so now than ever.</TE>
<TE>   Israel has reoccupied the West Bank. It has bombed the
headquarters of the Palestinian security forces in Gaza and on the
West Bank. It has raided supposed bomb-making facilities and arrested
or killed alleged bombers and potential bombers. It has demolished
the homes of the families of bombers and reputed bombers. It has
demolished the refugee camp at Jenin and bombed the neighborhood of
one Hamas mastermind, so far. It is planning to exile the families of
suicide bombers from the West Bank to Gaza (one wonders what it plans
to do to suicide bombers' families who live in Gaza--perhaps exile
them to Gaza also?). It has cracked down ruthlessly on movement
across the West Bank and has instituted harsh curfews in the big
towns. It has begun building a fence (only about 120 feet, so far,
out of more than 200 miles, but time is measured differently in
biblical lands) between what it calls Israel and what are called the
Occupied Territories.</TE>
<TE>   Still the suicide bombers come, more and more. This means, and
Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon and the Israelis must eventually
realize it, that a military/physical solution is not practicable. Or
perhaps, it is practicable (meaning you can do it), but it simply
won't work--if security for Israelis is your goal. If remaining in
power is your goal, if drumming up nationalist fervor is your goal,
then perhaps the military option is serviceable. But if protecting
your people is your goal, then Sharon's Palestinian policies have
obviously been a big failure.</TE>
<TE>   This is a tough one for the Israelis, who probably always imagined
that their evident military superiority would serve in any serious
test of wills to protect them more or less utterly. Even the
peaceniks on the Israeli side secretly harbored this belief. Perhaps
they were imagining their military power as it might have been
wielded by a leader of subtlety and nuance, a leader capable of to
and fro, a leader with a certain degree of moderation, which is not
what they voted into office, and not what they have. Sharon has taken
every opportunity to destroy the possibility for peace, has stomped
on every little shoot of dialogue. He is like a mad elephant
rampaging through a small, ancient village carefully built by elders
out of mud and sticks. Wherever he goes, everything is destroyed.</TE>
<TE>   He is trying to destroy hope and build a nationalist camp based on
statewide despair. His policies are making the Israelis hopeless
while, at the same time, enabling the worst elements in Palestinian
society, pushing them to new heights of cruelty and making that
cruelty more palatable to a broader range of the Palestinian
population. This is good for Sharon, who has caught the Israelis in a
circular bind of logic in which they accept more and more violent
means to quell the kind of violence that instead is pumped up under
attack.</TE>
<TE>   To blame Sharon for all this is not to blame the victim. Sorry. To
blame him is to blame one of the main perpetrators. But what's more
interesting is what his role might turn out to be, because all
leaders both create and are influenced by the stream of history in
which they find themselves. I like to think, when I'm fanning my weak
spark of optimism, that there is another fate for Israel than that of
an armed, walled fortress, oppressing its neighbors and being
attacked and sabotaged by them, forever. I like to imagine, as I blow
on the dying embers, that what Yossi Beilin (the much-maligned and
marginalized peace technocrat, and a perennial figure at peace talks,
conferences, secret meetings and negotiations) believes is true.
That, as the masters say in chess, because the endgame is already
preordained, worked out and on paper (from the days of "Oslo" and
"Taba"), all it takes to get there is to step gingerly and cleverly
through the soggy, swampy, ambushed middle of play. I even nourish a
sick hope that perhaps Sharon has boxed himself into a corner where
he will end up being the one to sign the peace. An indication that
that's the direction in which things are going: last week's
near-agreement between the Israelis and the Palestinian leadership
(whoever that is) concerning security and what I like to call
"de-reoccupation." True, it didn't happen. But they are talking.</TE>
<TE>   Except for President Bush, the international community supports a
peace initiative. (Bush says he does, too, on his better days, but he
has boxed himself into his own foreign-policy corner with his war on
terror.) The Quartet--the U.S., Russia, the European Union and the
United Nations--is working toward that goal, as is the Trio, composed
of Saudi Arabia, Jordan and Egypt. Quartet and Trio, more words from
the peaceniks' lexicon, but still, they exist.</TE>
<TE>   It's tragic that Sharon's ill-conceived "plan" for Israel's
security can only be shown to be unsuccessful because the suicide
bombers are still lining up inside Israel to kill more Israelis. All
the peaceniks said this would happen, from the beginning. That's
because the peaceniks know the Palestinians and have been talking to
the Palestinians for years. Sharon, apparently, doesn't, and has
misjudged the Palestinians every which way, although he certainly
knows how to push their buttons.</TE>
<TE>   Sometimes a situation has to reach a nadir before people realize
what they ought to have realized before, but did not choose to. The
Israeli right didn't want to make peace with the Palestinians because
it did not think it had to. Israel was stronger, remember? Today, a
small but important segment of the Palestinian population has
repudiated suicide bombing publicly. In Israel, too, there is a tiny
resurgence of debate. Strength, the Israelis have seen once again,
resides in many characteristics. Not just firepower, but also
tenacity. Not just ruthlessness, but also desperation. The
Hamas/Sharon combination--a melange of suicide bombing and bombing
tout court--has brought us to where we are now. We are at the end of
Israel's military option, as the destruction of Shehada's
neighborhood and neighbors has shown us. Perhaps Israel is willing to
go farther down the dangerous military path, but even its best
friends will agree for only so long (witness Bush's reaction to the
Shehada bomb), and then Israel will be on its own.</TE>
<TE>   That's not a safe place to be.</TE>

<HD>Take Steps to Seal Off Your House From Rodents</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GARY ABRAMS</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Because of this year's low rainfall, rats and mice are looking for
new food sources as their natural sources are drying up.</LD>
<LD>   Unfortunately, homes are a prime target for an easy meal.</LD>
<LD>   Don't let your house become a free ride for rodents during the
drought. Here are some prevention tips:</LD>
<TE>   * Inspect for cracks or openings around the home's perimeter on a
regular basis. Look for holes under and behind shrubbery or objects
stored against the building and around pipes or conduits.</TE>
<TE>   Rodents have been known to squeeze through holes the size of a
nickel.</TE>
<TE>   Seal any holes or cracks on the outside of a house with exterior
spackling or stucco patch compound.</TE>
<TE>   Pay close attention to foundation and attic vent screens and
crawl-space access doors. Repair holes in the screen mesh with steel
"hardware cloth."</TE>
<TE>   * Check the roof and eaves for cracks or openings (a common entry
point is the underside of areas where sloped roof sections join
together). Seal open sheet-metal roof vents with steel hardware cut
to match the width of the opening but 2 inches longer.</TE>
<TE>   Place it over the vent opening and fold the excess material over
the edges. Secure it with sheet-metal screws driven into the vent's
walls.</TE>
<TE>   * To keep rodents off the roof, trim trees and vines around the
perimeter of the house to create about a 3-foot space at the roof
line. Rats can jump onto the roof from adjacent trees; don't make it
easy for them.</TE>
<TE>   * Pick up fallen fruit from trees right away and keep pet food in
a sealed container inside. Also, store firewood in a sealed cabinet
to prevent rats and mice from nesting in it.</TE>
<TE>   * Look for holes or cracks inside the house. Open cabinet doors
and inspect for holes around pipes. Look in corners and under
"toe-kick" areas at the front of cabinets for openings. Seal with
wall-patching compound.</TE>
<TE>   * Check for spaces under exterior doors and the garage door. Add
an appropriate door shoe or weatherstripping to the door's bottoms or
sides to create a tight seal.</TE>
<TE>   Remember, mice can get under a door with a gap of less than half
an inch.</TE>
<TE>   * Keep doors shut when possible. Rats and mice can slip quickly
through an open door.</TE>

<HD>Getting a Handle on the Differences in Doorknobs</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES CAREY and MORRIS CAREY</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There's a lot to know about selecting a doorknob.</LD>
<LD>   Besides the old-fashioned deadbolt, there are four basic types of
doorknobs:</LD>
<LD>   * Passage: Passage hardware is primarily used where a lock is not
needed. This could be on a hall door, the door between the kitchen
and dining area, or a secondary bedroom where a child might get
locked in.</LD>
<TE>   * Privacy: Privacy hardware is the opposite of passage. It has a
lock built in. We commonly see privacy hardware on the master bedroom
door, on a bathroom door and on the side door of the garage.</TE>
<TE>   A privacy lock is designed to be unlocked from the inside of the
room it protects, but also can be unlocked from outside the room with
a small screwdriver.</TE>
<TE>   * Keyed: Keyed hardware is like privacy hardware except that it
can only be unlocked from the outside with a key.</TE>
<TE>   Although we commonly see keyed doorknobs on exterior doors, they
often are used on sheds and gates for added security, or on the
inside of the home, on a closet, for example.</TE>
<TE>   * Dummy: Dummy hardware is there for looks. It doesn't do
anything.</TE>
<TE>   When you have double doors, chances are good the "inactive" door
has a dummy on it to match the latch side. Dummy knobs also are used
on doors where a latch exists at some location other than at the
knob.</TE>
<TE>   All door hardware is bright and shiny when new. However, with less
expensive doorknobs the finish doesn't last.</TE>
<TE>   The key-lock system in cheaper locks can be opened by an
adolescent with a hairpin.</TE>
<TE>   Key-lock systems are available in 5- and 6-pin configurations. A
6-pin lock is harder to pick than a 5-pin. For exterior doors, the
building code requires deadbolts.</TE>

<HD>Don't Pay a Middleman Escrow Fees</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STEPHEN GLASSMAN and DONIE VANITZIAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Question: In December 2000, I sold a condominium and paid $885 in
"document transfer/preparation and HOA [homeowners association]
escrow fees by management company," $497 in "sub-association fees"
and $625 in "master association fees" to the management company.</LD>
<LD>   In May 2001, I bought another condo in the same development, and
the sellers paid exactly the same fee amounts to the same management
company for exactly the same documents.</LD>
<LD>   In June, I sold the second condo and was charged identical fees
for identical documents by the same management company.</LD>
<TE>   For all three sales, documents were delivered directly to the
buyer, and there were no changes in any of the documents. No
additional labor was involved by the management company for either
sale but the fees were the same. This cost me thousands of dollars.</TE>
<TE>   The management company owner said the fees were part of the
contract between his company and the association's board of
directors. He also said that when the board signed the contract, it
agreed to let the company charge whatever fees it wanted to. No one
supplied me with the actual costs to change any records.</TE>
<TE>   The management company said that when I signed the real estate
agent's purchase agreement I placed an X in the "yes" boxes next to
"pay HOA transfer fees" and "pay HOA document preparation fees." I
did not put an X in any boxes and I never received a notice of what
these fees were when I signed the agreement.</TE>
<TE>   The management company told me, "You agreed to it when you signed
the purchase agreement, and there were no limits placed on the fee
amounts," and referred me to the escrow company.</TE>
<TE>   Escrow referred me to the management company, and both referred me
back to the board. The board ignores me.</TE>
<TE>   I want a refund, and neither the companies nor the board want to
deal with this. Can I obtain an accounting of what the management
company charged me and a refund of these charges?</TE>
<TE>   Answer: Management companies are not escrow companies. There is no
law that says they must be the liaison between you, the homeowner
association and your escrow company. By injecting themselves between
you and the homeowners association, management companies create a
middleman position at your expense.</TE>
<TE>   These are fees homeowners don't have to pay. Sellers can obtain
and supply these documents on their own. Most homeowners
automatically assume they cannot supply these documents to the buyer
and to the escrow company, and that they need a management company to
do it for them. They don't.</TE>
<TE>   The covenants, conditions and restrictions of most homeowner
associations and Civil Code section 1368 require that copies of
documents be provided to the buyer of a unit in a deed-restricted
development, with the cost of providing them limited to the
association's "reasonable cost to prepare and reproduce the requested
items."</TE>
<TE>   Subdivision (c) states that an association "shall not impose or
collect any assessment, penalty, or fee in connection with a transfer
of title or any other interest except the association's actual costs
to change its records."</TE>
<TE>   The law says the owner of the property being sold shall provide
the buyer with the documents and that, upon request of the owner, the
association shall provide them--charging only for the cost to prepare
and reproduce them. It says nothing of a management company or other
third party.</TE>
<TE>   Write directly to the owner of the management company and ask for
an accounting. Give the company 10 days to respond. If you do not
receive a satisfactory answer, take your case to Small Claims Court
requesting a refund.</TE>
<TE>   Remember to demand as additional damages the $500 civil penalty
and your attorney's fees (the fees you would pay for a consultation
with an attorney because an attorney cannot represent you in Small
Claims Court). Costs are automatically awarded if you win.</TE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Here are some ways consumers can protect themselves from paying extra
fees when buying or selling in a common-interest development:</LD>
<LD>   * Purchase agreements, sales agreements and deposit receipts used
by real estate agents to convey offers to purchase, or for
counteroffers, are legally enforceable contracts. Do not sign them
until you have read the documents completely.</LD>
<LD>   * Fill in all the blanks and check off all the boxes before
signing. Be especially cautious about terms requiring the payment of
fees. If you do not understand those terms or the explanation is
unsatisfactory, cross those terms out before signing.</LD>
<TE>   * Whether it's well-meaning or unscrupulous, blank boxes are
sometimes mysteriously filled in after the agreement is signed.
Prevent that by ensuring that all boxes are either checked or crossed
out and that any requirement for payment of fees either includes the
exact amount to be paid (naming the entity responsible for paying),
are marked "N/A" or are also crossed out.</TE>
<TE>   * Write "N/A" on each blank line or insert a dollar-amount limit
of what you are willing to spend. Cross out any sections with blank
lines that are not used for your offer or counteroffer.</TE>
<TE>   * On the documents titled Residential Purchase Agreement and Joint
Escrow Instructions and Counter Offers, scrutinize everything listed
under Escrow, Title and Other Costs. Look for the phrase: "Buyer or
Seller shall pay HOA transfer fees and document preparation fees."
Refuse to pay these fees, or obtain and insert the exact fee amount
and agree to pay it by signing the contract.</TE>
<TE>   * Stop any fees being charged by writing a contingency clause into
the contract that requires your written consent before any escrow fee
can be charged to you. Later, when fees are discussed, decide at that
time whether or not to pay them.</TE>
<TE>   * Before you sign, ask what fees the escrow company will be
charging and whether there is any way you can avoid them, have
someone else pay them or write a less expensive method into your
contract. Look for and thoroughly question each and every fee charged
by the escrow company, including draw deed fees, processing fees,
wire fees, transfer fees, express mail fees and forwarding/demand
fees.</TE>
<TE>   * Do not accept instructions from a real estate agent to just
"look this over, then sign it" or that "this is just the typical
agreement that everybody signs." There is no "typical" agreement.
Buyers and sellers need to know what fees are being charged and what
those fees are for. The legal effect of leaving lines blank is the
same as signing a blank check.</TE>
<TE>   * Always insist on receiving a copy of every document you sign at
the time you sign it.</TE>

<LD>Question: I am going to paint my house, which is built of concrete. I
have scraped off all the loose paint and am ready to begin. Do I need
to prime the entire house or just where I scraped off the paint?</LD>
<LD>   Answer: The key to a good paint job is in the preparation.
Removing loose paint, patching, caulking and priming will lead to a
better-looking and longer-lasting paint job.</LD>
<LD>   Although you say you have "scraped off all the loose paint," we
suggest that you also use a power washer to remove any remaining
paint.</LD>
<TE>   This also will open the pores of the concrete to accept the fresh
layer of paint.</TE>
<TE>   If you don't own a power washer, you can buy or rent one.</TE>
<TE>   Because scraping and power washing can result in an irregular
surface, use a power sander to smooth the edges between the existing
paint and the raw surface.</TE>
<TE>   You can also use an exterior-grade patching compound (compatible
with concrete) that can be applied with a wide-blade putty knife to
disguise the rough areas.</TE>
<TE>   Apply it as smoothly as possible.</TE>
<TE>   Once the patching work is complete and has dried, spot-prime the
patched and bare areas using a latex masonry block sealer or concrete
paint.</TE>
<TE>   Finish the job by painting the entire building with a coat of
premium quality 100% acrylic exterior house paint.</TE>

<LD>This Beverly Hills-area home was built for a bank executive in 1923.
The main house and guest house originally were connected by a
breezeway but sometime in the 1950s the property was separated. Not
until recently, after the owner of the main house purchased the
adjacent parcel with the guest house, was the nearly 2-acre property
reunited.</LD>
<LD>   Now the estate has been restored and looks more like what
architect Gordon B. Kaufmann intended.</LD>
<LD>   Kaufmann, who died in 1949, designed public buildings as well as
residences. Among his clients were Scripps College in Claremont and
La Quinta, the resort. He also designed Greystone Park and Mansion,
the 1928 Doheny Mansion now owned by the city of Beverly Hills.</LD>
<TE>   Asking price: $10.2 million</TE>
<TE>   Size: The estate has seven bedrooms and nine bathrooms in 12,727
square feet. There is a 10,105-square-foot main house and a
2,622-square-foot guest house. The main house is on a
46,080-square-foot lot; the guest house is on a 28,157-square-foot
lot.</TE>
<TE>   Features: The gated Mediterranean-style home has a large motor
courtyard, breakfast and dining rooms, a patio, a library, and
central air-conditioning and heat. The landscaped yard has a pool.</TE>

<LD>Justin Timberlake of the pop group 'N Sync has purchased a Hollywood
Hills home in the low $8-million range.</LD>
<LD>   The 21-year-old singer-songwriter, who was raised in Tennessee,
also has a three-bedroom home in Orlando, Fla.</LD>
<LD>   Singer Britney Spears, Timberlake's girlfriend of the past several
years, bought a $3-million Westside home about 18 months ago, but the
couple parted ways in March.</LD>
<TE>   Timberlake's new home has five bedrooms and 8 1/2 bathrooms in
about 12,000 square feet. On several acres behind gates, the
Mediterranean-style house also has a theater, gym, guest house and
tennis court.</TE>
<TE>   The home has a cobblestone motor courtyard and covered parking for
three vehicles. Timberlake has at least nine cars, including a Dodge
Viper and a Porsche, plus five motorcycles. He has a game room with a
pinball machine in his Florida home.</TE>
<TE>   Timberlake, a member of 'N Sync for seven years, has been working
on his first solo album.</TE>
<TE>   He also has appeared as an actor, co-starring in the TV movie
"Model Behavior" (2000) and doing voice work in 2001 for an episode
of "The Simpsons," which featured cartoon likenesses of 'N Sync
members.</TE>
<TE>   He co-starred with Spears, now 20, on the Disney Channel's remake
of "The Mickey Mouse Club" from 1993 through 1994. In 1998, he and
Spears reunited when she appeared as an opening act for 'N Sync.</TE>
<TE>   Formed in 1995, the group was already popular in Europe when it
became a U.S. hit in 1998 with the singles "Tearing Up My Heart,"
"God Must Have Spent a Little More Time on You" and "I Want You
Back."</TE>
<TE>   Since 1999, 'N Sync has received more than a dozen awards. This
year, the band won the American Music Award for band, duo or group,
and the People's Choice Award for favorite musical group or band.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The newly built Newport Beach home of former Anaheim Angels
pitcher Chuck Finley and actress Tawny Kitaen has come on the market
at $14.5 million.</TE>
<TE>   Finley, 39, joined the St. Louis Cardinals as a pitcher in July
after being traded by the Cleveland Indians. He was with the Angels
from 1986 to 1999. In April, he filed for divorce from Kitaen. They
were married in 1997.</TE>
<TE>   The Newport Beach house was built and designed by Dugally
Oberfeld. The architectural firm is known for its work on Beverly
Hills-area homes of celebrities such as Sylvester Stallone and Denzel
Washington.</TE>
<TE>   The home has five bedrooms and more than eight bathrooms in 11,500
square feet. The Italian Tuscan-style villa sits on nearly an acre
and has an infinity pool and ocean, city and golf-course views.</TE>
<TE>   The home has a slate roof, a glass-and-iron entry door and
patterned hardwood floors of walnut, white oak and mahogany. The
library/office has built-in mahogany cabinets and the master suite
has heated bathroom floors made of limestone. An elevator runs from
the third floor to a 10-car subterranean garage.</TE>
<TE>   Paul Wright of Coast Newport Properties, Newport Beach, has the
listing.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Bel-Air home of the late singer Peggy Lee has been listed at
just under $2 million. Lee died in January at age 81. She had lived
in her Bel-Air home since 1980.</TE>
<TE>   Built in the late 1960s, the gated, French Regency-style house has
a two-bedroom master suite with two bathrooms and a hallway library;
an elevator; two guest suites, one with two bedrooms; and a rooftop
garden terrace with views from downtown L.A. to the ocean.</TE>
<TE>   The nearly 5,000-square-foot house on slightly more than a quarter
of an acre also has a motor courtyard, a circular staircase, a
hand-carved imported marble fireplace, a banquet-size dining room
with city views and French doors leading to a pool and a patio.</TE>
<TE>   Lee, also a songwriter and arranger, was popular with jazz and pop
audiences for 50 years. She was known for such songs as "Fever" and
"Is That All There Is?"</TE>
<TE>   Monty Iceman of Prudential-John Aaroe in Encino has the listing.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Eddie Cibrian, who stars as New York City firefighter Jimmy
Doherty on the NBC ensemble drama "Third Watch" and co-starred with
Heather Graham in the movie "Say It Isn't So" (2001), and his wife,
model Brandi Glanville, have purchased an Encino home for slightly
more than $2 million.</TE>
<TE>   The actor, 29, has been splitting his time between New York City,
where "Third Watch" is shot, and Toluca Lake. The former soap-opera
star ("The Bold and the Beautiful," "The Young and the Restless,"
"Sunset Beach") was raised in the San Fernando Valley and attended
UCLA.</TE>
<TE>   He and his wife, 28, were married last year in Laguna Niguel.</TE>
<TE>   Their new home on half an acre has six bedrooms in 8,700 square
feet. Contemporary and Mediterranean in style, the gated and walled
estate was built in 1992 and has a 30-foot entry with a glass domed
ceiling and marble floors.</TE>
<TE>   It also has a library/office, a home theater, a large kitchen with
granite counters, a master suite with a steam shower and a spa tub,
five fireplaces, a 70-foot-long pool, a spa and a five-car garage.</TE>
<TE>   Judy and Doug Ross of Prudential John Aaroe, Encino, had the
listing.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Richard T. Jones, who plays court services officer Bruce Van Exel
in the CBS drama "Judging Amy," and his wife, Nancy, have sold their
San Fernando Valley home for close to its $550,000 asking price.</TE>
<TE>   The couple bought a larger home in Santa Monica for their growing
family.</TE>
<TE>   Their three-bedroom, nearly 1,800-square-foot home, which was
built in 1950, was purchased by Nancy Allen, who played the female
lead in "Robocop" (1987) and portrayed Albert Brooks' housekeeper in
the movie "Out of Sight" (1998).</TE>
<TE>   The house also has two fireplaces, a family room and French doors
leading to a pool, deck, landscaped yard, dog run and office.</TE>
<TE>   Jones, now 31, made his feature debut as Ike Turner Jr. in "What's
Love Got to Do With It?" (1993). Since then, he has appeared in a
number of films and TV series.</TE>
<TE>   Diane Sydell of Prudential John Aaroe, Encino, had the listing on
the house that Jones sold.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Don Diamont, who stars as Brad Carlton on "The Young and the
Restless," has sold his gated Encino home for about $1.4 million.</TE>
<TE>   The seven-bedroom 5,300-square-foot home was built in 1950 and has
a pool and a tennis court.</TE>

<HD>Solid Ground for Shaky Times</HD>
<DH>A strong Southland housing market is fueling consumer
spending and stimulating business for agents, lenders and other
support services.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DIANE WEDNER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Southern California's resilient residential real estate market is the
silver lining amid the recent gloomy economic news, as consumer
spending from rising home equity and refinancings as well as
employment generated from real estate transactions continue to buoy
the local economy.</LD>
<LD>   Increasing home values, coupled with low interest rates, have
prompted consumers in near-record numbers to use home-equity funds
and extra cash from refinancing transactions for purchases that pump
money into local businesses, shielding the region from the economic
shakiness the rest of the nation is feeling more acutely, analysts
say.</LD>
<LD>   Skyrocketing home sales have generated employment for lenders and
real estate agents, and also have given a boost to related
businesses, such as home inspectors, insurance agents, and to cities
and counties through increased tax revenues.</LD>
<TE>   Since the 1970s, real estate has directly accounted for at least
40% of the upswings and downswings of the economic cycle, and it
services a large component of the nation's gross domestic product,
said Edward Leamer, director of the UCLA Anderson Forecast.</TE>
<TE>   In the last five years, the value of Southern California's housing
has increased 59% to $1.5 trillion, and is up 76% compared with 1988,
when the region experienced its previous real estate boom, according
to DataQuick Information Systems Inc., a La Jolla firm that tracks
real estate trends.</TE>
<TE>   On an individual basis, the average residential property in
California today is worth about $42,000 more than a year ago, earning
homeowners about $3,500 a month, tax-free, said John Karevoll, a
DataQuick analyst.</TE>
<TE>   "If that money is plugged into the economy," Karevoll said, "it's
spectacular."</TE>
<TE>   No data are available to quantify how much consumers are spending
from the cash they're pulling out of refinancings, but the surge in
that activity has, at the least, lifted homeowners' confidence and
spurred them to spend more freely on dinners out and entertainment,
economists say.</TE>
<TE>   "When we cut people's monthly mortgage payments by 20%, and
they're saving $500 a month, they feel like they can shop more, maybe
even invest in a new car," said David Soleymani, managing director of
First Capital Corp. in Santa Monica. "It has a ripple effect in the
economy."</TE>
<TE>   Seasonably adjusted U.S. auto sales, at 18.1 million nationwide in
July, were the highest since an all-time record of 21.3 million last
October. For Southern California, July auto sales were up 20.4% from
last July, according to JD Power &amp; Associates, an auto industry
market researcher.</TE>
<TE>   After recently refinancing his home loan, Randal Winter, a Newhall
contractor, is about to begin construction of a room and bath
addition on his Stevenson Ranch home in the Santa Clarita Valley.</TE>
<TE>   He and his wife Gail not only are saving $200 a month on their
mortgage, which they will use for home-improvement purchases and
savings, but the couple also pulled out $50,000 in the refinance for
the remodel, which will employ local plumbers, electricians and
construction workers. When the job is done, the Winstons will buy
furniture, drapes and carpet, giving a boost to local merchants as
well.</TE>
<TE>   The nearly unprecedented level of mortgage refinancing, the result
of low interest rates, has had the greatest impact on the local
economy, analysts say.</TE>
<TE>   During the week ending July 26, the Mortgage Bankers Assn. of
America posted its fourth-highest level of mortgage loan applications
on its market composite index, up about 95% compared with the same
period a year ago. Refinancing activity represented about 66% of the
total applications.</TE>
<TE>   In Southern California in June, lenders reported a near-record
$10.6 billion in refinancings, about double the number from the same
period a decade ago, according to DataQuick.</TE>
<TE>   Patsy Grant, a home mortgage consultant with Wells Fargo Home
Mortgage in Pasadena, said that her office posted its biggest month
ever last month. Refinancings, which usually account for about 60% of
the loans, made up about 85% of her office's applications.</TE>
<TE>   Mark and Jennifer Fedde, owners of a Pasadena furniture store,
recently refinanced their Sierra Madre home to put in a new kitchen
floor and add to their children's education funds.</TE>
<TE>   "We have three kids, with lots of cost," Mark Fedde said. "We saw
the rates coming down, and saw an opportunity to save on our monthly
mortgage and invest in home improvement."</TE>
<TE>   Real estate investment is looking even more attractive after the
stock market's recent plunge, analysts say. Last year, for example,
the average real estate investment trust stock was up 10% in value,
compared with the 20% decline of the Standard &amp; Poor's 500, according
to a Real Estate Research Corporation report.</TE>
<TE>   During the last decade, the average stockholder earned $23,000 in
the equity market, whereas the average homeowner earned $44,000 in
home equity, according to Wells Fargo Home Mortgage.</TE>
<TE>   Put another way, a $50,000 investment as a 20% down payment on a
Southern California home in June 1992 would be worth about $175,000
today, according to DataQuick's Karevoll.</TE>
<TE>   Falling mortgage rates and a tight supply of housing pushed the
June median cost of a Los Angeles County home up 18% from a year ago
to $269,000, marking the eighth consecutive month that the county set
a record price, according to DataQuick. Home sales jumped 9% in
Orange County, typical of the brisk pace regionwide.</TE>
<TE>   Buyers put an average of about $4,000 in costs into the pockets of
lenders, title insurance companies, inspectors, notaries and others
per transaction, according to agents and lenders. Realtors earn about
6% on each residential home sale, so a $269,000 sale can generate
$16,000 in commissions.</TE>
<TE>   Buying and selling homes and refinancing mortgages aren't the only
ways in which the economy benefits from real estate. Homeowners who
use their equity gains to purchase a certificate of deposit, for
example, pump money into the economy when the bank uses that money to
lend to developers, who pay laborers and buy lumber and other
construction materials.</TE>
<TE>   The financial cushion real estate provides regional economies is
limited, however. The widening gap between income and home values has
some economists worried about how long the current spike in prices
can last. They also caution that the recent stock market decline
could trigger a change in the spending habits of consumers, which in
turn could cause a slowdown in the housing market.</TE>
<TE>   But as long as the demand for housing continues to outstrip the
supply, housing will probably continue to have a positive impact on
the economy, they say.</TE>
<TE>   "The high-priced market is not without risk," said Stuart Gabriel,
director of the USC Lusk Center for Real Estate. "But there won't be
a house-price collapse."</TE>

<DH>Despite bankruptcy and foreclosure, Tujunga mom wants to
start over and buy again</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ALLISON B. COHEN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The temperature magnet on Cynthia Hocker's refrigerator door read 83
degrees at 7 p.m. on a midsummer evening.</LD>
<LD>   "It's even worse in the winter," she said of the extreme
temperatures. "We've only got one wall unit in the hallway to heat
the place, so we turn on the oven to try to get warm."</LD>
<LD>   The run-down Tujunga row house isn't this single mother's idea of
a great place to raise her children Wesley, 11 and Caitlyn, 9. But
having lost a home to foreclosure four years ago, Hocker was
desperately trying to re-create in a rental what she had lost.</LD>
<TE>   "I took this place," she said, "because it was the closest thing I
could find to a house."</TE>
<TE>   Besides having oppressive heat or freezing cold, depending on the
season, the house is small--just 800 square feet. Playing in the yard
or enjoying the small concrete patio is usually out of the question
for the children because Hocker, a Seventh-day Adventist, fears her
children will begin to pick up bad habits from the neighbors, who she
said swear, drink and smoke outside their units.</TE>
<TE>   "I look around me," Hocker said, "and I wonder how I got here."</TE>
<TE>   In 1994, Hocker--who has raised both of her children alone--had a
$43,000-a-year job and was living the good life in a new home on a
cul-de-sac on the west side of Palmdale. The 1,650-square-foot
house--with three bedrooms and two bathrooms--was loaded with
amenities: a roman bath, a kitchen with an island, a fireplace in the
living room.</TE>
<TE>   "It was my dream home," she recalled. "It was the perfect place
for raising kids. We were enjoying it, and life was good."</TE>
<TE>   But in 1998, Hocker was laid off from her job as an administrative
assistant at a Burbank hospital when the facility closed its doors.
About six months later, she found she could no longer make the
payments on the house, filed for bankruptcy and went into
foreclosure.</TE>
<TE>   "Leaving was the hardest thing I've ever had to do," she said. "I
was giving up security for my kids."</TE>
<TE>   But today Hocker, 49, has started to regain her footing with a
stable job grossing about $30,000 a year. She's even managed to put
$3,000 into a 401(k). Now she's hoping to move out of the
$825-a-month Tujunga rental and find a home again.</TE>
<TE>   Even with Hocker's troubled financial past, there is hope for her,
experts said.</TE>
<TE>   "Some people think that if they've had a foreclosure," said Alfred
King, a spokesman with Fannie Mae, the nation's largest source of
financing for home mortgages, "that they are forever barred [from
homeownership], and that's not true." Though there is no specific
guideline, King said, waiting two years to reestablish credit is a
good rule of thumb.</TE>
<TE>   Hocker's foreclosure and bankruptcy was discharged well within
that time frame, but before she can reclaim her status as a
homeowner, she will have to continue to do some work cleaning up her
credit.</TE>
<TE>   Even though Ann Carlton Bose, president of Estate Funding Inc. in
Woodland Hills could approve Hocker for a $0-down $125,000 loan for
the purchase of a single-family home, Hocker would have to show that
she has $7,500 in cash reserves--money she doesn't have. The reason
for the cash reserves, Bose said, is that unpaid items are still
showing as outstanding on Hocker's credit report when they should be
showing as discharged from the bankruptcy.</TE>
<TE>   Bose suggested Hocker send notices to the three credit bureaus
along with a copy of the discharge of her bankruptcy to improve her
credit score. Lenders, as a rule, take the middle of the three scores
reported by the credit bureaus measuring such factors as late
payments, credit used versus credit available and employment history.
For the $0-down loan, Bose said, the middle score would need to be
620. Hocker's is 606.</TE>
<TE>   "I cannot guarantee the scores will go up," Bose said, "but I am
sure willing to work with you on it."</TE>
<TE>   According to Bose, cleaning up Hocker's credit could take anywhere
from 60 to 90 days. Bose figured that with an improved credit score,
Hocker could get approved for a loan with less cash reserves, which
she would be able to afford.</TE>
<TE>   The loan that Bose had in mind for Hocker, offered by Fannie Mae,
is called the Timely Payment Rewards mortgage. With that
program--which has been available since 2000--the interest rate on
the loan is reduced up to 1% if mortgage payments are made on time
for 24 consecutive months. The downside is the loan requires the
payment of points--each point being equal to 1% of the loan amount
payable in advance to the lender. Additionally, the interest rate on
this type of loan is higher than the going market rate.</TE>
<TE>   In Hocker's case, the $125,000 loan would have a 7 5/8 interest
rate and would require she pay 2 3/4 points, or $3,437. Bose
estimated another $3,063 would be needed in closing costs, bringing
the full amount Hocker would need to close a deal to about $6,500.
Because Hocker would still need to show some cash in reserves, Bose
recommended Hocker negotiate with the seller to pay her nonrecurring
closing costs.</TE>
<TE>   "All the seller would have to do," Bose said, "is bump up the
price of the house in order to pay your closing costs."</TE>
<TE>   "You pay a bit more for the house," she said, "but the seller is
paying more of the cash at the closing.... It's a wash for them."</TE>
<TE>   The monthly payment on such a loan--including principal, interest,
tax and mortgage insurance of $135 a month--would run $1,187. After
24 months of payments, that monthly payment would drop to between
$960 to $1,000 a month. The exact drop in the interest rate--0.5% to
1%--would be decided by the lender based on the borrower's credit
history.</TE>
<TE>   Without a program such as Timely Payment Rewards, Bose said,
consumers such as Hocker would have to go to sub-prime lenders that
charge higher-risk borrowers additional fees and higher interest
rates.</TE>
<TE>   Even with the probable approval on her loan, finding a home in
today's seller's market in the $100,000 to $125,000 price range will
be difficult.</TE>
<TE>   Hocker said she had wanted to live in the areas of Altadena or
Tujunga--close to her work and her children's school. But real estate
experts were not able to find her anything in those neighborhoods.</TE>
<TE>   "The problem is we just don't know when the [housing price] bubble
is going to burst," said Julie Mahoney, an agent with Dilbeck
Realtors/GMAC in La Canada-Flintridge. "I hate to paint a picture of
gloom and doom for her."</TE>
<TE>   Mahoney, who specializes in real estate in La Canada, Glendale and
Tujunga, was only able to find one property--a 536-square-foot studio
condominium in Glendale for $99,950--too small for Hocker's growing
children.</TE>
<TE>   Altadena home prices, according to Mahoney, range from $180,000 to
$225,000 in today's market, and Tujunga's entry-level homes cost
about $230,000.</TE>
<TE>   Mahoney did find 10 properties in Hocker's price range in Palmdale
with at least two bedrooms.</TE>
<TE>   Though Hocker thought many of the homes would suit her family,
they didn't come close to the west end neighborhood she left behind.
"There was no comparison to my old place," she said. But most
important, Hocker said the homes were too far of a commute--some 60
miles--to her job in Glendale and her children's school.</TE>
<TE>   To try to get Hocker in the areas she wanted, Mahoney recommended
she consider pooling her money with a friend to purchase a home
together. "In this market, you've got to get creative," she said.
Another option, Mahoney said, was that Hocker wait to purchase.</TE>
<TE>   "I think she should just hold on," she said. "I don't think this
market can go on forever."</TE>

<TE>   This Month's Home Buyer Make-Over</TE>
<TE>   Home buyer: Cynthia Hocker, 49</TE>
<TE>   Occupation: Administrative assistant with a property management
company</TE>
<TE>   Gross annual income: $30,000</TE>
<TE>   Goal:  To reestablish herself as a homeowner after losing a home
to foreclosure--and filing for bankruptcy--in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   The problem:  Although Hocker is close to receiving approval for a
loan, she still needs to clean up some credit issues and accumulate
more cash reserves. Still, she may be unable to find a home she can
afford in today's seller's market.</TE>
<TE>   Recommendations:</TE>
<TE>   * Hocker needs to work with the three credit bureaus to have items
still on her credit report marked as discharged due to bankruptcy.
Doing so may raise her credit score enough to get her a loan that
does not require a large cash reserve.</TE>
<TE>   * Consider paying more points for a Fannie Mae-offered loan that
will reduce the interest up to 1% for 24 months of on-time payments.</TE>
<TE>   * Ask the seller to increase the purchase price of the home by the
amount of the closing costs. While Hocker would have to pay more for
the house, the seller is paying more of the cash at closing.</TE>
<TE>   * Consider pooling resources with another family or another single
mother to increase purchasing power.</TE>

<HD>Manager Says Fixing Patio Door Is Low Priority</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Project Sentinel</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Question: The sliding glass patio door in my apartment came off the frame and now it won't lock. I live on the second floor, and the door leads onto my balcony. The manager says that because I live on the second floor, fixing the door is not an
emergency and it won't be repaired right away. I don't feel safe having the door unlocked. What can I do?</LD>
<LD>Answer: A property owner must take reasonable precautions or basic security measures to protect tenants. California Civil Code 1941.3 states that all entry doors in a rental property must have an "operable security or locking device," also known as a
lock. This code applies to all entry doors and operable windows, regardless of their location.</LD>
<LD>You need to discuss the matter further with the property owner and explain your safety and security concerns. Perhaps he or she would be willing to have you proceed with the repair and subtract the cost from the rent. In this case, be sure to put this
agreement in writing and have it signed by both of you.</LD>
<TE>If the matter is not resolved to your satisfaction, you could contact the city housing inspector, who may be able to help get the door repaired quickly. If these efforts fail, contact your local housing mediation program for assistance.</TE>
<TE>If Lease Allows Dog, Owner Can't Alter Terms</TE>
<TE>Q: Last month I moved into a house after signing a one-year lease. My dog is listed on the lease, but the property owner now says she wants 10 days to decide whether the dog can stay. I don't want to move out if she decides I can't have the dog. What
can I do?</TE>
<TE>A: Well, there is good news. Once a lease is signed and the term begins, changes cannot be made during the lease term unless the ability to make changes is written into the lease.</TE>
<TE>A change in any of the lease terms requires the written consent of both parties. The only time a lease can be terminated without mutual consent is when there is a failure to correct a violation of a written condition in the lease, or of a house rule if
any are incorporated in the lease.</TE>
<TE>This means the rent amount can't be changed, the security deposit can't be increased, and you can't be asked to remove the dog during the lease period. If your lease prohibited pets, then you would be in violation of the lease, unless the pet is a
service animal required because of a disability. For more information and assistance, contact your local housing mediation program.</TE>
<TE>30-Day Notice Isn't the Same as an Eviction</TE>
<TE>Q: One of my new tenants asked if a 30-day notice to move would appear on her credit report. I know that a court eviction does, but I don't know about a 30-day notice. Is a 30-day notice the same as an eviction?</TE>
<TE>A: A 30-Day Notice of Termination of Tenancy is a standard rental form used by tenants and landlords to end tenancies. These notices do not appear on credit reports and therefore do not affect a tenant's credit.</TE>
<TE>An eviction occurs only when a tenant is not able or willing to move by the end of the 30-day notice period, and a legal action known as an unlawful detainer is filed in the local superior court. If the property owner prevails in court, the judgment
will probably be recorded on the tenant's credit report. This credit report entry could affect chances of being accepted for a future tenancy.</TE>
<TE>In some instances, even an unlawful detainer that has been dismissed can appear on an "eviction report" that can be ordered from certain housing and rental agencies.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The Los Angeles County Community Development Commission received a National Assn. of Counties 2002 Achievement Award last week for its role in creating the Westwood Transitional Village.</LD>
<LD>The 40-unit multifamily facility, which includes a child-care center, provides temporary housing and support services for primarily single women with children who were formerly homeless or emancipated from the county's foster care program.</LD>
<LD>The awards, started in 1970, seek to recognize innovative county government programs and increase services to citizens. Zev Yaroslavsky, chairman of the Board of Supervisors, presented the award to the commission.</LD>
<TE>"The Westwood Transitional Village is a creative and compassionate project," he said. "It provides the opportunity for families in need to make it onto the road of self-sufficiency."</TE>
<TE>The Westwood Transitional Village is at 1401 Sepulveda Blvd. and was created through a partnership that included the Salvation Army.</TE>

<LD>If you turn on the bedroom lamp and the air conditioner at the same time and fry a fuse or pop a breaker, your house is trying to tell you something.</LD>
<LD>Don't overload circuits. Doing so will slowly but surely fatigue the wire inside the wall. You might eventually end up with a dangerous condition.</LD>
<LD>Find out how many watts each of your circuits will hold, and don't exceed the limit. Following this simple rule will add longevity to your electrical system and maintain safety.</LD>

<LD>Style-conscious brides who cherish the elegance of eras past but don't want to slight the cutting edge might consider slipping into one of Camille DePedrini's dresses. Traipsing down the aisle in the designer's lustrous "Garbo" gown, a silk charmeuse
sheath anchored by a short train with ruche detailing around the bust, could make any woman feel like a '20s film star, while DePedrini's above-the-ankle dupioni "Dior" number looks right for afternoon tea at the White House with Jackie Kennedy.</LD>
<LD>"I use the best of what the past has to offer," DePedrini says, "and change it to what my customers like--something that's classic and contours the body, but is comfortable, too." When it comes to influences, she cites masters such as Chanel, Dior and
(for color) the American couturier Charles James. She also wanders local museums, taking cues from various eras and cultures.</LD>
<TE>DePedrini began preparing for her fashion career at the age of 9. That's when her grandmother started taking her to a small bridal shop in their hometown of Hackensack, N.J., to get dresses made for special occasions. "I loved getting fitted, picking
the fabric and all those little details." DePedrini's mother, another inspiration, sold couture clothing at Bloomingdale's and possessed a fabulous wardrobe filled with Missoni classics. DePedrini studied at the Louise Salinger Academy of Fashion in
San
Francisco and launched her wedding line during the early '90s. She designs in her Eagle Rock home studio, then contracts cutters and seamstresses to materialize her visions. The collection is housed in a quaint showroom at Sonnie's, an eclectic
boutique
in South Pasadena.</TE>
<TE>The retro-inspired gowns range from $600 to $3,500 and employ witty touches such as wispy organza for a kimono-style coat with delicate obi train over a simple slip dress. DePedrini's antique-colored "Maria" dress overlaid with lace around the bodice
evokes Victorian-era romance; the more playful scoop-necked "Amber" features an unexpected layer of bright chartreuse silk peeking out from beneath the hem. "The women that come to me are modern, but they also appreciate the past," she says. "They
understand that fashion can be timeless."</TE>

<DH>With Twice the Sugar of Raspberries, Delicate Persian Mulberries Are a Sweet Treat</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>AMELIA SALTSMAN</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If you've ever wondered why people line up at the farmers' markets to pay $10 for a small container of Persian mulberries, then you've probably never tasted one. Morus nigra, black or Persian mulberry varieties, are sweet, with twice the sugar of
raspberries but with enough acidity to make them irresistibly intriguing. The ancient Near Eastern fruit tastes somehow wilder than blackberries (which they only visually resemble), and the way they liquefy in one's mouth to a concentrated wine-red
nectar is unparalleled by other fruit. It's a mysterious attraction, for they don't lure us with perfume the way ripe raspberries or strawberries do. Persian mulberries reserve themselves for our sense of taste alone.</LD>
<LD>Early one morning in Lucerne Valley, as clouds tempered the high-desert heat, I stood with Alex Weiser, his father, Sid, and their assistant Antonio, and contemplated the row of a dozen dwarf mulberry trees at the Weiser Family Farms. ''We planted them
a few years ago to distract the birds,'' Alex says of the 10-foot-tall, lollipop-shaped trees. ''Then we tasted the fruit. Now we've got to find the birds another sanctuary.'' Sid adds, ''Mulberries do well here; our climate duplicates that of the
Persian plateau.''</LD>
<TE>This is the first year the Weisers, known for potatoes, melons and lilacs, have such plentiful mulberries, and Alex was eager to find the best way to harvest the fragile berries. One tree produces 10 bushels of fruit gradually through a season. This
means the dense broad-leafed foliage must be combed every couple of days for ripe, black berries. Picked red, they're too tart and not yet voluptuous with juice; harvested late, they're dry and cloyingly sweet. Ripe berries often dissolve in the
picker's fingers, reducing yield, but a definite job perk. We plucked, shook, kicked and jiggled trunks and branches to loosen the fruit. As ripe berries dropped into our hands or softly to the ground, we couldn't resist eating some. This, finally, is
why mulberries are costly. If 20% of your harvest is consumed in the field--which is Alex's personal method of culling his haul--you realize what a rare commodity Persian mulberries are.</TE>
<TE>Before my visit to the Weisers, I ate mulberries one of three ways: straight from the box at the market, standing in front of my open refrigerator or, on special occasions, from a bowl with a spoon. But I wondered what cooks around town did with the
berries. Preserve-maker Edon Waycott turns mulberries from her own tree into jam, ''reluctantly, because they lose something when cooked.''</TE>
<TE>Pastry chefs Kimberly Boyce of Campanile, Kim Sklar of Lucques and executive chef Brooke Williamson of Zax agree. When they can procure them, they serve mulberries simply, with fresh cream or vanilla ice cream and a not-too-sweet cookie. I suppose if I
can't eat them straight from the tree, that'll have to do.</TE>
<TE>*</TE>
<TE>Persian Mulberries with Fresh Cream and Shortbread Buttons (Adapted from Campanile) Serves 6</TE>
<TE>*--*
1      pound Plugra, or other extra creamy European-style butter
Pinch kosher salt
1/2    cup light brown sugar, lightly packed
1      cup powdered sugar
3 1/3  cups pastry flour
1 1/3  cups bread flour
3      cups Persian mulberries with their juices
1 1/2  cups heavy cream</TE>
<TE>*--*</TE>
<TE>For shortbread: In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with paddle attachment, cream butter and salt until very smooth, scraping down sides of bowl, until butter is light and fluffy, about 10 to 15 minutes. Meanwhile, place brown and powdered sugars
in
a food processor fitted with S-blade and pulverize for 5 minutes. Add sugars to creamed butter. Mix at medium speed until well-blended. Sift flours together and add all at once to butter-sugar mixture. After scraping down sides of bowl, mix just until
incorporated. The mixture will be very thick and soft. Turn dough out onto a lightly floured work surface and gather into a ball. Flatten into a disk, wrap in plastic and chill until firm, at least 2 hours or overnight.</TE>
<TE>Divide dough in half. On a lightly floured surface, roll dough out 1/4-inch thick. With a 3-inch round cookie cutter, cut out as many circles as you can. Save scraps for another use. With a smooth 1/4-inch-diameter pastry tip, punch out four holes in
the center of each cookie to resemble a button. Place cookies on a parchment-lined baking sheet. Repeat with remaining dough and bake cookies in middle of 250-degree oven until lightly browned, about 2 hours. Cool on rack. Makes about 2 dozen cookies.
Set out six dessert bowls. Spoon  1/2 cup mulberries and their juices into each bowl. Serve with a pitcher of cream and platter of shortbread.</TE>

<HD>The Moss Man Prophecy</HD>
<DH>It's Always Halloween in Bill Jenkins' Yard</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LESLEE KOMAIKO</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Some think it's a parasite," says Bill Jenkins. "I'm never out in the yard that someone doesn't stop by and say, 'What is it?' Not to mention the cars that screech to a halt in front of the Jenkins residence. "Some think it's something like straw I've
hung up. They don't realize it's a living thing. It belongs to the pineapple family. It's a bromeliad."</LD>
<LD>Jenkins is talking about moss--creepy, weepy Spanish moss--and his West L.A. yard is lousy with the stuff. Twenty-one years ago, Jenkins, then president of the Southern California chapter of the American Rhododendron Society, drove across the country
to
attend a rhododendron convention in Atlanta. Following the convention, he took a side trip to Savannah and found himself in Forsyth Park, Savannah's equivalent of Central Park, the day after a downpour. The ground was littered with tufts of the city's
fabled Spanish moss, which had fallen from the trees.</LD>
<LD>"On an impulse, which is the story of my life, I picked up a bunch of them and brought them home," says Jenkins, now 84 and retired from a career that included writing for the aerospace industry and working as a handyman. "I just loved them. The word
that comes to me is 'languid.' "</LD>
<TE>Back in West Los Angeles, Jenkins wired the moss to the branches of the orange tree in his frontyard. He wasn't sure if it would flourish or dry up and die. "But lo and behold," he says, "it was very happy here. But it won't grow in the Valley or any
place it freezes. I'm two miles from the ocean, so the air is moist."</TE>
<TE>Today, Jenkins' property looks like the set of a Tim Burton movie. You can barely see his house for the gauzy filaments of moss hanging from the fig trees, the persimmon tree and the Persian mulberry tree. "The beauty of it is it's completely
undemanding," he says. "Whereas the rest of the garden plants have their seasons and come and go, 365 days a year it's there. One boy said it's like perpetual Halloween."</TE>
<TE>Not everyone appreciates Jenkins' moss, though. "I have two sons who live with me and they think I'm a screwball. They think I should be spending my time on something more practical, but my garden is my sanctuary. I'm proud of it. There must be 7
million frontyards in Los Angeles." Jenkins has yet to see one like his.</TE>
<TE>"No one has the imagination to do much of anything," he laments. "It just takes a little pizazz to come up with something interesting."</TE>

<DH>An Urban Architect Builds an Unconventional Family Home on the Border of Hancock Park</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL WEBB</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The house that architect Scott Johnson built for his family breaks all the rules for Hancock Park, a tranquil enclave of huge trees and historic homes. Johnson's house is snugly inserted into a commercial street bordering the neighborhood. The pool is
located on a second-floor terrace, and there's no leafy yard. The facade is wrapped in corrugated steel and a glass curtain wall, with a semicircular translucent glass lantern lighting the third-floor study. And yet, nobody has complained, and the
house
is as comfortable a fit there as it would be in a tougher, more urban area.</LD>
<LD>''A lot of people wonder what this building is,'' says Johnson. ''It doesn't have the signs and symbols that say 'house.' I live in L.A., which is the storytelling capital of the world, but I don't believe in narrative architecture. It's a liberating
experience to explore abstraction and solve problems without worrying about questions of image.''</LD>
<TE>The challenge was to create a house that offers security and privacy, but opens up to views and the bustle of the street. Like the Japanese, who describe the view over a boundary wall as ''borrowed landscape,'' the Johnsons enjoy vistas of treetops and
the Hollywood Hills, which make up for the lack of a garden. Johnson describes his creation as a ''study in geometrical precision that is spacious enough for the four of us and allows for entertaining on any scale.'' He's constantly on the move,
teaching and visiting far-flung job sites. His wife, Dr. Margaret Bates, runs an OB-GYN practice that can keep her up nights, and their teenage son and daughter wanted a soundproofed room for making music.</TE>
<TE>From the street, the shimmering cube is enigmatic; its 6,000-square-foot interior feels transparent and the spaces flow together. An assertive steel staircase slices up through the center of the house, linking the ground-floor studio, service areas and
a spacious garage to the living areas on the second. The children's bedrooms are on the third floor and have expansive north-facing windows. In contrast, the master bedroom, separated from the living room by a pool terrace, is secluded and serene. The
master bedroom is a round room paneled with ebonized wood and sound-absorbing fabric. A sliding screen door blacks out a narrow window so that Dr. Bates can sleep during the day if necessary. A circle cut through the ceiling to reveal the joists
demonstrates how Johnson has juxtaposed raw and refined materials throughout the house.</TE>
<TE>For a successful large-scale architect like Johnson--a design partner of Johnson Fain Partners best-known for his sharply angled Fox Plaza Tower in Century City--building a house for yourself is an indulgence. As a collector of contemporary art and a
furniture designer, he wanted the house to serve as a work in progress, a place to try out fresh ideas and juggle the contents over a period of time. The living room's polished concrete floors and lofty ceiling, the steel stairs and colored-glass
screen
that divide it from the dining room and the translucent fiberglass in the kitchen all evoke an industrial loft. The living room, eclectically furnished with unusual pieces and a grand piano, doubles as a music room. The dining room, with its elliptical
tabletop of dark and creamy stone split down the middle and its tall, upholstered chairs, opens up through glass sliders to the pool terrace, turning the room into a shady porch on summer days. A rusted steel beam in the cutaway ceiling plays off the
elegance of the furnishings.</TE>
<TE>Having lived in New York's Greenwich Village and the Haight district of San Francisco, the Johnsons wanted to recapture an urban experience and share the fun of walking to neighborhood shops and restaurants, enjoying the spectacle but shielded from
noise. For Dr. Bates, who often has to catch up on her sleep after getting the kids off to school, it's ideal. ''We are high enough up that it's very quiet,'' she says. ''But the neighborhood is down-to-earth, and it gave us a lot more freedom to
express ourselves than if we had built on a typical residential street.''</TE>

<LD>As a resident of Marin County in the '70s ("Seeking the Soul of Marin," by Scott Harris, July 14), let me say: 1) It is never just "Marin." It is "Marvelous Marin," as in, "I don't live in San Francisco, I live in Marvelous Marin." 2) Hot tubbing has
always been a real phenomenon of Marin County. My best memory? Joining 20 naked folks from my Gestalt group for some wine and conversation one night in a hot tub with a killer view of San Francisco and the bay. 3) The "right feng shui" should be a
determining factor for anything in Marin. After all, Marin has always been known for being unique in its self-indulgent quirkiness.</LD>

<HD>Upholding the 'Faith and Good Works,' or Simply Out for Profit?</HD>

<LD>Your exceptional article describing the Christian outreach work of Pastor Matthew Barnett was well-written and an inspiration for our religious community ("On Faith Alone," by Bob Emmers, July 21). Barnett's efforts have followed Jesus Christ's
command:
You must love and help your neighbor just as much as you love and take care of yourself. The traditional church was one built on faith and good works. As the King James Bible says, faith that doesn't show itself by good works is no faith at all--it is
dead and useless.</LD>

<TE>Emmers' article brings up a disturbing trend: Most churches are now run as businesses--in many cases, as multimillion-dollar businesses. A few examples include the $200-million Catholic cathedral in downtown Los Angeles, the PTL (Praise the Lord)
network, the TV programs of the Rev. Robert H. Schuller's Crystal Cathedral and now the Dream Center. These ministries, which were supposedly started to glorify God, are now only used to glorify the almighty dollar and the egos of the pastors, bishops,
ministers, etc., who head these "churchorations."</TE>
<TE>Since they're being treated like CEOs, we should start treating them as such and tax their churches. Their tax-free status allows them to buy land and TV air time at lower cost, while paying tax-free salaries and making tax-free book and videotape
sales. The tiny neighborhood not-for-profit churches that are truly giving back to the community shouldn't pay taxes, but the for-profit mega-"churchorations" should.</TE>

<LD>Nita Lelyveld hit the nail on the head in "Secession's Seductive Undertow" (July 21). If she had hit a little harder, blood could have flowed. I don't think that secession is about taxes or services (though they are dismal). It is about the disdain and
condescension that Westsiders feel for Valleyites and the opportunism exhibited by downtowners who take advantage of the Valley.</LD>
<LD>No marriage can last amid such emotions. Nor, I'm sure, are the mayor's hysterical ravings conducive to a good relationship. Oddly enough, Valleyites do not really have any feelings about downtowners and Westsiders other than indifference. Of course,
it
is well-known to those on the receiving end that this is the most devastating of all emotions. If they despise us so much, why don't they set us free?</LD>

<LD>Many of the desserts made by the pastry chefs profiled in "Sweet Success" (by David Lansing, July 21) are analogous to the "new" rock bands flooding MTV. Grand marnier souffles and strawberry tarts have been around since the '60s. The only real
innovator in the article seems to be Kimberly Boyce, and even her ingredients and techniques were staples at Chez Panisse ages ago or are based on ancient French products.</LD>
<LD>Yeah, I know--everything old is new again, but Lansing shouldn't have made this stuff sound like the second coming. Los Angeles may not be the nation's foremost restaurant city, but our past includes some great pastry chefs who made great desserts.

<HD>BUILDING A BETTER POTATO</HD>
<DH>American Scientist Rebecca Nelson Has Been Leading the Charge to Use Genetically Modified Crops to Fight Famine in Peru. But Not Everyone Thinks It's God's Work.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JONATHAN KANDELL</AU>
<BD>Jonathan Kandell last wrote for the magazine about Singapore's street food stands.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Nestled some 13,000 feet up the Andes mountains of Peru, the village of Aymara is literally breathtaking. The chest heaves, the head throbs, the fingers tingle. The air is so thin and clear that distances deceive. Crags are etched in such detail that
mountains appear closer, and the grassy slopes and cultivated terraces are an intense green.</LD>
<LD>Carlos Hidalgo, the 30-year-old community leader, is explaining to a visitor how Aymara villagers plant their potatoes observing traditions rooted in the Inca past. Every spring, they survey the stars of the Pleiades low over the northeastern horizon.
If the constellation is bright, the villagers plant their crop early. If it's dim, they wait a few weeks. The furrows are shaped according to weather predictions based on stargazing, the behavior of birds and insects, and even earth tremors. Since this
was a wet year--as expected--the furrows were flattened. "That way the rainwater drains away and the potatoes won't rot," says Hidalgo. But neither astronomy nor naturalism prepared Hidalgo and his fellow farmers for the disaster of 1997.</LD>
<TE>That year, El Nino, the warm Pacific current that flows cyclically off the Peruvian coast, made its most devastating appearance in recent memory. In Aymara, it caused unusually high temperatures and heavy rainfall. Boulders that hadn't budged in a
geological era slid down mountains. Fields became steamy bogs, and cows sank to their hocks in mud. The villagers noticed that as their potatoes reached harvest time, the leaves were covered by a filmy, white mildew, and the tubers themselves turned
black and soggy. "I lost maybe 80% of my crop," recalls Hidalgo. "We barely ate that year." Several elderly Aymara villagers died of diseases linked to malnutrition. The massive crop failure was caused by late blight, the same killer fungus responsible
for the Irish potato famine of the 1840s that resulted in a million hunger-related deaths.</TE>
<TE>According to the Centro Internacional de la Papa (International Potato Center), a research institute headquartered in Lima, Peru, late blight losses in developing nations amount to about $3 billion a year. Nearly 15% of the Peruvian potato crop is
destroyed annually by the fungus--and several times that in isolated areas. While cases of outright starvation are rare in Peru, blight-induced malnutrition causes death rates to soar among infants and aged people already weakened by respiratory and
gastrointestinal ailments.</TE>
<TE>Rebecca Nelson, one of the potato center's leading pathologists, finds the blight alarming, and she has been an ardent crusader of using genetically modified or "biotech" crops to combat the epidemic. "Blight is back and it's bigger than ever," says
Nelson, an American who recently completed a research stint in Peru. "It has become the No. 1 potato disease worldwide." One of the primary methods to combat late blight and other pathogens is by engineering new varieties of plants that need less
fertilizer and pesticides. Potatoes have a potential yield per acre that is nearly twice that of cereals, making tubers a major weapon against global famine.</TE>
<TE>But plant geneticists are being denounced by environmentalists for creating biotech crops that purportedly could harm wildlife, morph into herbicide-resistant super-weeds and even pose dangers to human health. As the easiest of the major crops to
modify
genetically, potatoes have been at the heart of the controversy. "What right does some moralistic person from the United States or Europe have to deny biotech solutions to poor farmers in the Third World?" Nelson says.</TE>
<TE>A fine drizzle turns the air a misty gray and makes the dun-colored andean foothills on Lima's outskirts look like slag heaps. The Peruvian capital, not a particularly attractive city any time of the year, is saddest during the rainy season. But it is
a
bittersweet period anyway for Rebecca Nelson, a 41-year-old recipient of a MacArthur "genius" grant for her work on plant pathogens. Within days, Nelson will be returning to the United States to head a larger research project after five eventful years
at the potato center. Her house is in disarray, with her two boys, William and Benjamin, running wild through the rooms and garden, while her husband, Jonathan Miller, a freelance journalist, finishes packing boxes upstairs that will be picked up by
the
movers this same July afternoon. There are painful despedidas--goodbye parties--given in her honor by colleagues at the potato center, where she has been one of the most respected scientists in the center's three-decade history of improving potato
yields.</TE>
<TE>Nelson has supervised the release of some 40-odd disease-resistant potato varieties to poor farmers, but she's not happy to leave behind ongoing lab and field experiments for dozens of other promising varieties. Adding to Nelson's ambiguous frame of
mind is the fact that her stay in Peru has coincided with a dramatic decline in the reputation of food scientists.</TE>
<TE>"We were regarded as saviors of the world," says Nelson, a tall, thin woman with a halo of disheveled, curly hair around an almost adolescent face. "That's not the case anymore. Now hunger is viewed as a complex poverty problem upon which agrarian
research has relatively little impact. And then there's the biotech controversy."</TE>
<TE>When she addresses the issue, Nelson's voice quickens and amplifies, her left foot jiggling on the armrest of a rattan easy chair in her living room. She cites the case of a bacteria gene implanted by potato center scientists into one potato variety to
kill the deadly tuber moth. The new variety has almost eliminated the need for expensive and dangerous pesticides.</TE>
<TE>"Nobody talked about the huge mortality rate that pesticide spraying was causing among those poor farmers," says Nelson. "They were dying like flies, and that to me was thoroughly unacceptable." Nelson acknowledges that genetic modification is no
panacea and that research can provide only part of the solution to the jigsaw of global food shortages. Moving lab results into the field is no easy task. Impoverished farmers with tiny plots of land are averse to taking on the risks of an unproven
potato variety. There is also the fickleness of the marketplace. Consumers and wholesale distributors resist the tastes, textures, even the shapes and skin colors of new potato varieties. And there is no overseas market because most countries ban the
import of unprocessed potatoes on the grounds that they are too likely to carry pathogens that could infect local crops. So the poor campesinos who accept new potato varieties and technologies tend to remain subsistence farmers, at least grateful if
they can cut their costs.</TE>
<TE>The complex layers of farmer resistance to new potato varieties may be hard to peel away, but they can be easily glimpsed in Aymara, a village of less than 100 families about 200 miles southeast of Lima. On a bright, crisp morning, a trio of
middle-aged
men, wearing thick wool sweaters and caps and chewing wads of coca leaves to ward off the cold, are stomping on small piles of thawing potatoes. Jorge Romero, at 53 the oldest of the three, explains that the potatoes had been left on the field to
freeze
overnight. Now that the sun has softened them, the tubers are being crudely but efficiently crushed and peeled by bare, calloused feet. The mush will then be placed in a nearby well and left to ferment for 15 to 20 days. Finally, the potatoes will be
sun-dried into a mealy preserve, known as chuno (CHOON-yoh).</TE>
<TE>Five centuries ago, the Inca warriors who were Romero's ancestors survived on little else but chuno during their months-long battle marches. Romero and his fellow Aymara villagers prefer to eat it on special celebratory occasions, mixed in hearty stews
with egg, meat and cheese.</TE>
<TE>"But we set aside most of it for emergencies because chuno can last up to 10 years," says Romero, his unshaven, sunburned cheeks bulging with coca chaws. By emergencies, Romero means those years when crops are ravaged by pests. In the early 1990s, the
potato center introduced pest controls in Aymara to cope with the main local predator, the Andean weevil. Multiple defenses were created against the insect. New potato varieties, less appetizing for the weevils, were planted. Fields were circumscribed
by shallow ditches doused with small quantities of pesticide and bordered with plants whose leaves contained natural toxins against the weevils. Finally, the harvest was placed on plastic sheets, a simple barrier that prevented surviving weevil larvae
emerging from diseased potatoes from burrowing into the ground to mature and attack a future crop.</TE>
<TE>The main benefit to Aymara of the new varieties--some of them genetically modified--has been the sharply reduced investments in costly pesticides, allowing cash to be spent elsewhere. While the village is mired in poverty--it still has no electricity,
phones or running water--most men now wear factory-made shirts, pants and work boots. (Women, though, continue to dress in traditional billowing skirts, woolen stockings and leather slippers made at home.) Even these limited gains were threatened by
the
near famine of the late blight outbreak in 1997. "You go around the Andes and see so many destroyed fields and you want to do something about it," says Nelson. "So as far as I'm concerned, blight is the most obvious plant pathogen for me to get
involved
with."</TE>
<TE>Nelson was born into scientific research. Her parents were researchers at the National Institutes of Health in Washington, D.C. As a kid, Nelson dissected road kills in her bedroom while her schoolmates were playing field hockey and baseball. After
graduating from Swarthmore, she completed her PhD at the University of Washington in Seattle--though the degree was in zoology, not plant pathology, her chosen career. "I'm proud of the fact that I'm totally untrained for what I'm doing," she jokes.</TE>
<TE>Qualified or not, Nelson landed a job in 1988 with the International Rice Research Institute in the Philippines to study rice blast, a major crop disease. From there she moved to Peru in 1996 to head the late blight program at the potato center. An
internationally funded institute, the potato center was already in the midst of prolonged soul-searching--that continues to this day--about how to best approach its mission of improving potato yields and the livelihoods of farmers. Like every food
research program, the potato center was being forced to battle for public and foundation funds with other worthy, scientific causes, especially environmentalism. "Until recently, our entire focus was on increasing productivity and giving the world more
to eat," says Fernando Ezeta, the potato center's regional representative for Latin America. "But over the last decade, there has been a growing global concern over the environment. So we are competing with ecological researchers for the same financial
resources."</TE>
<TE>To woo potential donors, the potato center is being pressured to behave more like a private enterprise and demonstrate the "profitability" of its research projects. Potato center projects have been whittled down from more than 30 a decade ago to 13
today. Each project is ranked in terms of its probability of scientific success, dollars saved or gained per acre, and the poverty level of the farmers it benefits, among other factors. By these criteria, the late blight program, under Nelson's
direction, has been deemed the top research project, meriting the largest single portion of the potato center's $24-million budget in 2000. Economic returns are projected at more than $250 million between 1998 and 2015.</TE>
<TE>These returns will not be guaranteed by scientific research alone. Bureaucratic battles must be fought and won within the potato center before new potato strains can be distributed to farmers. Trusted intermediaries must be found to convince farmers to
experiment with new varieties. And the farmers must be seduced into becoming active partners with potato center scientists in their efforts to propagate more productive, pest-resistant tubers. These various tasks can force Nelson into wearing a lab
coat, a field poncho and sometimes, metaphorically at least, a helmet. While she views herself primarily as a scientist, her success is equally dependent on her managerial skills.</TE>
<TE>Past experience has demonstrated to Nelson that there is no silver bullet, no single gene that can be counted upon to permanently resist late blight. "What usually happens is that if we try to combat a disease by concentrating on a single, major gene,
we might get a potato variety that offers resistance for a few years and then fails," she says.</TE>
<TE>Instead, her lab tries to isolate several genes, each with small effects on late blight but acting together to offer a more complex, lasting resistance to the disease. The lab workers might fish these genes directly out of the potato center's huge
potato seed collection and plunk them into potato varieties marked for field experiments. "That's bioengineering using genes from the same species," says Nelson. "But I'm also in favor of genetic modification using genes from other plant or animal
species because they offer us additional options."</TE>
<TE>The next stage is getting the potato center's plant breeders on board. Breeders tend to represent the old-school approach to scientific research, displaying more caution than a molecular biologist like Nelson. They focus their efforts on gathering wild
potato species, crossing them with domestic varieties, and constantly building up the tuber seed stocks. They tend to withhold new potato strains out of fear they might fail in the field. With the breeders in charge, it was taking the potato center
about 20 years to move a new potato variety from lab to land. So, among old-timers, there has been a good deal of resentment ever since Nelson appeared on the scene with a commitment to drastically cut down this time lag.</TE>
<TE>"I just want to get as many potato varieties off the shelf as quickly as possible and let the farmers decide if they want them or not," says Nelson. But making the initial contacts with rural communities can be daunting. The Peruvian government has no
agricultural extension service. The potato center, with roughly 100 scientists in Peru, doesn't have the manpower to find and woo campesino leaders. In the end, CARE was used as an intermediary, taking advantage of that global group's contacts in the
Peruvian hinterlands.</TE>
<TE>CARE had been running community development programs for several years around Cajamarca in the northern Andes, where late blight was rampant. And in 1997, CARE introduced Nelson and her potato center colleagues to local farmers. Groups of up to 25
campesinos were invited to join potato center field schools that met once a week over the three-to-four-month period of a potato cycle from planting to harvest. "The idea was to get them to understand the life cycle of late blight in order to break
it,"
says Nelson. "Farmers know the connection between weather and late blight. But they aren't aware of the microbe world."</TE>
<TE>At the field schools, campesinos were given disposable plastic bags--mini-hothouses--to be used to quickly grow fungus-infected potato plant samples. Once the fluffy white film of late blight developed on the budding leaves, it was scraped off and
viewed under rudimentary $15 microscopes that participants shared. "They could see that it's not chaos down there, but actually beautifully symmetrical spores that look like tiny lemons," says Nelson. "For the first time, they were seeing the causal
agent, and they were excited."</TE>
<TE>Simultaneously with these laboratory classes, the farmers were asked to plant small patches with a dozen varieties of experimental potatoes developed by the potato center in the hope that at least some of them would prove resistant to late blight. "I
was praying it would be a wet, warm year, which would create ideal conditions for late blight," recalls Nelson. "We would have had a very dull outcome if it had been a dry year." She got more than she wished. El Nino brought record rain and heat. The
Cajamarca landscape was churned into mud. On mountain slopes, crops were washed away, and many of the surviving potatoes were attacked by late blight. But the disaster allowed the farmers to witness the power of the new, resistant varieties.</TE>
<TE>Two in particular--the yellow-skinned Amarilis and the red-skinned Chata Roja--were so successful against blight that the farmers decided to plant them on their own plots the next year, without awaiting further crop tests. A year later, the new potato
strains were cultivated throughout Cajamarca by farmers who had been skeptical about the potato center program. "Chata Roja was the real favorite because it had a very high yield besides being resistant to blight," says Nelson. Incredibly, the potato
center's overly cautious breeders had developed Chata Roja 17 years before, but kept it on the shelf all that time because they felt it needed more lab tests to prove its resistance. "Sometimes, you just have to take risks," says Nelson. "If you get
farmers involved from the beginning, you won't have to worry they'll walk away if a strain fails. Nothing is going to be permanently successful against blight, anyway." She cites as an example a genetically modified potato variety called Canchan, which
gained popularity throughout Peru because of its good taste, high yield and resistance to blight, but eventually became so vulnerable to the disease that it has been dubbed "Ranchan"--the colloquial name for late blight.</TE>
<TE>Ultimately, the success or failure of a new potato variety depends on its acceptance by consumers--or, in practice, the wholesale marketers who distribute the many potato strains to retail markets and food stands. The largest wholesale market in Peru
is
La Parada, located on the outskirts of Lima. Sprawling over 100 square blocks, La Parada sells 1,200 tons of potatoes every day from 3 a.m. to noon.</TE>
<TE>The potatoes pour into La Parada overnight from the wind-swept Andes, the baking coastal plains and the rain-lashed Amazon highlands. Traffic jams on the periphery of the wholesale market are stultifying. Trucks disgorge their loads several blocks away
from the main entrance, where an army of porters carries the produce to more than 300 wholesale stands. "There's a lot of wastage because so much produce rots or gets eaten by vermin," says Fernando Cilloniz, president of a management consultancy and a
leading expert on food distribution. "La Parada's vendors have little incentive to correct these problems because they know they have no real competition." A decade ago, Cilloniz was predicting that modern supermarkets would largely replace La Parada.
But years of economic stagnation have discouraged investment in supermarkets, which account for 20% of the food distributed in the country.</TE>
<TE>Rebecca Nelson visits La Parada one Friday at dawn, partly out of curiosity over which potato center-bred potato varieties, if any, are on sale, but mainly because her younger son, Benjamin, wants her to pick up as many different potatoes as possible
for his show-and-tell class later that day. La Parada is notorious for crime, and Nelson arrives without jewelry or a watch and is accompanied by a bodyguard. The real threat, though, is getting bowled over by porters rushing in every direction. Swarms
of these small, muscular men trot through the crowded alleys with almost unbearably heavy 80-kilo (176-pound) bags of potatoes. Their backs are bent to a parallel plane above the ground, their faces fixed in a sweaty grimace, and their downcast eyes
unable to search out more than a few feet ahead.</TE>
<TE>"Pasando! Pasando!" ("Coming through!") they groan. This is work for the desperate: recent rural migrants, ex-cons, youths with facial deformities that render them unemployable elsewhere. They last only a few years before hernias, slipped discs and
broken backs force them into other means of survival. Nelson's contact at La Parada is the biggest wholesaler, Ines Talavera, a woman known as La Reina de la Papa, or the Potato Queen, and portrayed in the local press as a mafiosa. According to
Cilloniz, the management consultant, Dona Ines' power is exaggerated and her notoriety undeserved.</TE>
<TE>"She controls maybe 3% of the $120-million annual turnover at La Parada," he says. "And she is a person of excellent character. But you know how people love to think that the world is run by evil conspirators." In fact, Dona Ines--as everybody calls
her--projects a mix of competence and fragility. A small woman close to 70 years of age and with a paralyzed right arm, she sits on a chair placed on a raised wooden platform to better view the squads of porters with their arriving booty. Her cell
phone
rings constantly with the latest wholesale market prices and with purchase orders from restaurants. Most of her clients, though, are small vendors who personally come for the potatoes, which they will peddle at street stands throughout the city.</TE>
<TE>Dona Ines sells some 20 different potato varieties. Nelson recognizes some potato center-bred strains, including Canchan, the formerly miraculous, bioengineered potato that has recently lost its resistance to late blight. But other varieties are a
total
mystery to Nelson. "What's that?" she asks Dona Ines, pointing to a 6-inch-long, curving oval tuber. "Lengua de buey" ("Ox tongue"), replies the Potato Queen, using its perfectly apt nickname. Nelson observes that for the most part, the potatoes on
sale
are traditional varieties, the same ones that have dominated the market for decades. "That can't be helped," says Dona Ines. "I offer what my clients want. I don't see any great demand for more varieties."</TE>
<TE>Certainly Dona Ines has little use for most of the dozen potato varieties being harvested that same week at Aymara, the village high up in the Andes. On a gently sloping two-acre plot, a score of men and women are helping Carlos Hidalgo, the community
leader, dig up his potatoes. Some varieties have nutty flavors, others are almost as sweet as yams, and a few are as rich as egg yolks.</TE>
<TE>"We eat potatoes three times a day," says Hidalgo. "They have so many different tastes." Hidalgo wants his two boys, 6 and 4 years old, to become farmers and stay in Aymara. But he thinks that will only happen if new, more disease-resistant varieties
can be introduced that will break the cycle of feast and famine. Though Hidalgo continues to believe in the power of stargazing and natural phenomena to foretell harvests, he hopes to enroll in a potato center field school on pest control.</TE>
<TE>"I want to learn about those microbes," he says, squinting an eye into hands curled into the shape of a microscope. Hidalgo's seemingly contradictory embrace of the traditional and the modern doesn't surprise Nelson. "These farmers are open to new
ideas
as long as they can be shown to work," she says. "I never came across farmers who acted out of irrational superstition. Still, there are things that we scientists just don't get." Last year, when an earthquake devastated the region around the southern
Andean city of Arequipa, farmers elsewhere in the mountains predicted--correctly--that there would be heavy rains even though the wet season hadn't yet started.</TE>
<TE>"I don't know any reason why there should be a connection," says Nelson. "My maid tells me the wind blows funny when there's about to be an earthquake--and she's right. I've heard of villages where dogs howl and cats meow when someone is about to die.
And I've seen enough strange things happen that I just say to myself: 'Here, this is true.' "</TE>

<LD>From the clubs and brothels of Buenos Aires to ballrooms the world over, to dance the Argentine tango means to move in mysterious ways. At Tango Fireworks Week 2002, some of the art form's foremost maestros and musicians gathered in Redondo Beach to
trip the light fantastic with more than 300 obsessed international tangoistas in a grande milonga, L.A.-style. The great tanguero Miguel Angel Zotto has said, "Tango is like writing a letter--it has a beginning, periods, commas, stops and an end." We
spoke with some passionate correspondents.</LD>

<DH>A Predictable Menu and Setting Make Maple Drive a Comforting Place</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>S. Irene Virbila</AU>

<DL></DL>
<LD>At his first fancy restaurant meal, my little nephew ordered chicken. As the waiter slid the plate in front of the 6-year-old, he burst into tears. It wasn't what he expected. It had sauce. When he finally stopped sobbing, he announced to my sister,
"You can always count on the Sizzler."</LD>
<LD>Isn't that the appeal of chain restaurants? Everything is predictable. You know what's on the menu. You can calculate down to the penny how much the bill will be. No surprises.</LD>
<LD>That must be what regulars are after at Maple Drive. Come last year, come tomorrow, you'll find the same fine "kick-ass chili" and definitive meatloaf that owner and chef Leonard Schwartz brought with him when he left the late, lamented 72 Market St.
to
open this now-classic Beverly Hills restaurant. The menu has changed just a bit in recent months to reflect the steakhouse trend. It now includes a short section called "Prime," which lists steaks and chops served a la carte, with a choice of sauces
and
sides. Other than that, the kitchen sails on, turning out the contemporary American fare that seemed fresh and new when the restaurant opened in 1989.</LD>
<TE>At the time, Maple Drive was part of a wave of design-conscious restaurants that swept into its orbit even those Angelenos who never cared much about food. Over the years, Maple Drive's design has worn better than most. Not as hard-edged as the old
City, say, the space has a languorous big-city loft aesthetic. Concrete walls tilt this way and that. The bar is sleek and delightfully roomy, with tables along a banquette and liquor bottles forming a cityscape along the top of the wall that divides
the bar from the dining room. Quirky-shaped booths in blond hardwood veneer fit into odd corners of the room, and along the back are VIP booths that have such tall backs they feel like rooms.</TE>
<TE>On a slow night recently, I got to sit in one of these coveted booths. The opening is bracketed in wood, too, enclosing you in your own private world. The view is circumspect--waiters flitting by in their black vests and long aprons, the occasional
guest crossing the room, the play of light from the windows on a long summer's night. I also can hear the clanging of pots, the normal work sounds from a restaurant kitchen, the murmur of Spanish, or snatches of conversation from a table hidden in the
corner. It's oddly comforting.</TE>
<TE>Service is exceptionally good. The teamwork is seamless. A waiter hovers as the host hands you the menus, ferrying a crusty roll hot from the oven onto your bread plate just as you unfurl your napkin. Who can resist warm bread and sweet butter? To
everyone's relief, waiters don't push the bottled water. When they ask if you'd like bottled or ordinary water, the question doesn't seem weighted to cause any embarrassment if you choose the latter. Either way, take a sip, and someone almost
immediately refills the glass. When you order wine, the good glasses are brought without anyone having to ask. Some of the waiters and runners have been with Maple Drive for years.</TE>
<TE>No doubt many of the customers have been coming here for the same amount of time. The quiet block set squarely in a mostly residential area is home to a music company and financial management companies. That's the lunch crowd. At night, it's a mix of
Beverly Hill residents who appreciate the quiet, the crisp service and widely spaced tables. Those qualities may be the draw even more than the food. Maple Drive's menu doesn't try for culinary excitement or innovation, at least not anymore. But the
cooking is reliable and well executed.</TE>
<TE>Fine-textured crab cakes are full of crab meat, with a sneaky note of heat. You might be better off, though, opting for the less expensive gold caviar over the sevruga. As a garnish, sevruga is too complex and metallic tasting to make a perfect foil
for
the crab cakes.</TE>
<TE>Schwartz has taken the tired idea of chopped salad and made it his own: His is a graceful mix of chopped sweet shrimp, prosciutto, Maui onion and cannellini beans with radicchio in a sprightly vinaigrette. The portion, thankfully, is truly
appetizer-sized. That house chili is worth a taste, too. All meat, with only a few beans, it's etched with the sharp, dry flavors of Schwartz's custom blend of chili powder, and served with all the fixings and a dense, sweet corn muffin. You can get a
cup at the bar, too, which makes a light summer supper with a beer.</TE>
<TE>Shrimp spring rolls have an integrity you don't often find in non-Asian restaurants. The wrapping is crisp and not a bit greasy, the stuffing a pleasant mix of chopped shrimp, vegetables and rice noodle. It's a bit bland, true, but easily remedied with
a dip in the sweet, salty sauce.</TE>
<TE>The seafood entrees are well-prepared. King salmon, for example, comes with a tart sorrel sauce and a little asparagus risotto, while grilled black cod, a wonderfully flavorful fish, comes with artichokes and capers. Halibut, a special one night, is
delicious with a lemon-caper beurre blanc. A cliche in the '80s, when it was made endlessly with Champagne, the classic sauce is now rare enough to be listed on the endangered list.</TE>
<TE>Some of the main courses, though, can be boring, unless you're excited by grilled turkey sausages or plain grilled chicken scented with oregano in a tomatillo salsa. Chicken in a pot with a single matzo ball won't remind anybody of mother, and she'd
blanch at the price: $22.</TE>
<TE>The surprise is the veal Milanese. Pounded on the bone, dipped in egg and then bread crumbs, it rides right on the edge of crunchy, yet it's juicy, without slipping over into dry. Schwartz perks up the color with a cascade of checca. For those who've
forgotten, that's chopped red tomatoes with basil and olive oil, the sauce of choice for angel hair pasta back in the '80s and '90s.</TE>
<TE>The Maple Drive meatloaf still holds its own. Made of beef and pork, it's fine-textured and meaty, standing tall and flanked by bookends of mashed potatoes and sauteed spinach.</TE>
<TE>The new "Prime" section of the menu corrals not only the usual filet mignon, New York cut and bone-in rib-eye, but also a double-cut pork chop and a juicy center-cut veal chop.</TE>
<TE>One night there's a special: the same prime pork chop in Calvados sauce with velvety caramelized apples and a dreamy celery root and potato puree. It's a wonderful plate of food, but a bit odd to serve in the middle of summer. Nobody ever called
Schwartz's food light. The other special that appeared every visit over three weeks was zinfandel-braised short ribs served with rapini and spaetzle, those squiggly noodles from Alsace and Austria. It left me wondering if the specials at Maple Drive
ever changed.</TE>
<TE>I had some minor quibbles, too. On a Saturday of a holiday weekend, salads were limp and drowned in dressing, as if they'd been sitting around marinating all afternoon. The smoked tomato ketchup tastes as if half a bottle of Liquid Smoke was tipped
into
the pot.</TE>
<TE>The wine list has been updated with more moderate, food-friendly wines, many of which are available by the glass. On Tuesday nights, the restaurant discounts 30 wines by 50% as an incentive to get people to try them.</TE>
<TE>Pastry chef Lisa Gardner-Hruby has been with Schwartz since the beginning. How many rice puddings, how many hot apple tarts has she made in that time? I couldn't begin to guess. I do know if profiteroles are available, the pastry is fresh and light,
the
coconut ice cream as smooth as gelato and the chocolate sauce dark and clingy. The other dessert that begs to be ordered is her chocolate cake in a wild coconut frosting, which looks like an Afghan coat from the '60s.</TE>
<TE>Even the music stays the same here, beautifully understated jazz and standards from the live duo of Phil Wright on piano and Louie Spears on bass. In a world today of so much uncertainty, I think there's a comfort and dignity in repetition. Maple Drive
has got that right. While I may wish the talented Schwartz would step out and do something different once in a while, he's giving his longtime customers what they seem to want: continuity.</TE>

<LD>Pamplona, Spain. September 20, 1998. The Paseo Ernest Hemingway runs past the towering Plaza de Toros, the bullring that stands at the end of the town walls, close to the Arga River. The festival of San Fermin, the ''Running of the Bulls,'' that Ernest
Hemingway popularized in ''The Sun Also Rises,'' concluded two months ago, and the festival's revelers are long gone. Now a new cultural event, a uniquely American phenomenon, is once again drawing young people into the stadium.</LD>
<LD>On the outer walls of the Plaza de Toros, posters for upcoming bullfights are flanked by posters for the ''Vans Warped Tour.'' Inside the walls, the show has already begun. Kevin Lyman peers into the bullring from behind the stadium's upper tier of
seats. The stage straddles the bullring and the tour's banner hangs behind it. Onstage, Bad Religion churns out its own brand of melodic hard-core music as Basque teens, wearing T-shirts emblazoned with the names of their favorite American punk bands
(Lagwagon, NOFX, No Use For A Name), thrash and mosh in the dirt of the arena.</LD>
<TE>At the half-pipe nearby, teens gaze up at the skateboarder performing a ''backside air,'' gaining enough speed rolling down one vertical side to climb the other, launching body and board straight up above the ramp, and seamlessly turning around in
flight to head back down the ramp. A roadie walks up to Lyman, taps him on the shoulder, and says into his ear so he can hear above the music, ''We're a long way from the Marina Skatepark.''</TE>
<TE>Lyman laughs. They are many miles and years away from the South Bay and Orange County, a region that is derided for its suburban strip-mall sterility but is, at the same time, the place where this cultural movement was born.</TE>
<TE>In the 1980s, a group of discontented teenagers and twentysomethings from Southern California hatched their own anti-conformist punk-rock lifestyle and ferried it across the country in a fleet of beat-up vans. They played in living rooms, in VFW Halls
and in abandoned warehouses with makeshift skate ramps, delivering their original in-your-face music. The corporate record labels turned a deaf ear. There was no place for punks in the soft-soap world of co-dependent pop love songs.</TE>
<TE>Spurned by the mainstream, the punkers defined themselves in opposition. A Do-It-Yourself attitude took hold as a point of pride and the term DIY became synonymous with the lifestyle. They formed their own record labels to release their own music. The
records were distributed to mom-and-pop record stores and low-wattage college-radio stations. They were taken on the road and sold for gas money at shows, along with their band's T-shirts, which were drawn or silk-screened in the back of their vans
between gigs.</TE>
<TE>The bands became entrenched in America's underground music scene and seemed destined to stay there.</TE>
<TE>Then they ventured to Europe, discovering a new landscape and a formative group of compatriots who welcomed them. At first glance, this may seem surprising--for years the defenders of European culture have been concerned about America's cultural wares
polluting their indigenous art forms. But Europeans also have a long-standing tradition of embracing artists who create works that are representative of American freedom, of the individual shaking off society's rules: a lone figure in a pork-pie hat
running down a street chased by hundreds of cops in a Buster Keaton film; the idiot spastically disrupting the System in Jerry Lewis films; the social misfits stalking the edge of society in the writings of Jim Thompson and Charles Bukowski; the
self-expression of jazz played at speeds and harmonies that blur conventional musical boundaries; the suppressed heartfelt emotion of blues music.</TE>
<TE>The DIY skate-punk movement fits perfectly into this framework of acceptance, and it continues to thrive in Europe, drawing tens of thousands to festivals featuring extreme sports and their brand of music and selling millions of albums. This is the
story of how a group of scrawny skateboarding punkers climbed to the top of the culture heap on a continent steeped in centuries-old traditions.</TE>
<TE>On a Tuesday night in 1980, 15-year-old Greg Graffin peered out over the audience as he sang. His band, Bad Religion, created a roaring wall of rhythm and melody with its electric guitars and the drummer frenetically hammering away. The band was on a
multiple-band bill that night at the Marina Skatepark in Marina del Rey and was set up near one of the bowls, out in the open, while the skateboarders worked tricks on the inclines. The crowd thrashed to the music. ''The scene was very bizarre at the
time,'' says Graffin. ''In fact, it got a lot of punkers into skating and a lot of skaters into punk.''</TE>
<TE>Music has always been part of the skateboarding lifestyle. ''We would always have a radio present or we'd be skating a backyard pool and the people at the house would say, 'Hey here's the stereo,' '' says professional skateboarder Steve Alba. They
listened to hard driving rock 'n' roll such as T. Rex and Alice Cooper.</TE>
<TE>Two years earlier, at the Winchester Pro Bowl contest in the Northern California town of Campbell, Duane Peters, a 17-year-old pro skateboarder (nicknamed the Master of Disaster for pushing the limits on his board), ran into a skateboarding crew called
A-lot-A-flex who had adopted the punk style. Peters had already been listening to the Ramones on his way to the contest, so he identified with the skateboarders, who had short black hair and wore Levi's and the crepe-soled shoes called creepers. ''They
were in the bleachers and they were on their own, very anti-social with all the norms [regular people],'' says Peters. ''They gave me a tape of the Ramones and we listened to it on the way home and it was like, 'Listen to this guitar!' '' From that
moment on, punk rock became as much a part of Peters' life as his passion for skateboarding. He began collecting records; Generation X, the Dead Boys, the Sex Pistols. When he skated at contests, he chose to play the Ramones or the Clash for his runs.
And he was one of thousands of young people discovering this music. As punk rock traveled south from the Sunset Strip clubs to the South Bay and Orange County, skateboarders found the music that fit their lifestyle as the surfers before them had
claimed
the sounds of the Beach Boys and Jan &amp; Dean.</TE>
<TE>As skateboarding was exploding in popularity, the urethane wheel was revolutionizing the sport, and skateparks were springing up in suburban enclaves with concrete constructions shaped like pools, bowls and pipes to challenge the riders. Punk bands
began playing at the skateparks, and the pro skaters started forming bands. Duane Peters formed the Sharks. Steve Olson, voted Skater of the Year by readers of Skateboarder in 1978, played in Butchies Hoods. Ron Emory and Todd Barnes of the band
T.S.O.L. hung out at Lakewood skatepark and practiced in Duane's garage. The Circle Jerks' ''Group Sex'' album cover was shot at Marina Skatepark.</TE>
<TE>''I think it was a lot of young juvenile delinquents who were middle class, really bored and skating pools, skating alleys and listening to music that reflected their distress of the mainstream,'' says Jim Lindberg of Pennywise.</TE>
<TE>By 1982, Bad Religion moved beyond the skatepark scene and played at the Sunset Strip clubs. The band released its first full-length--''How Could Hell Be Any Worse?''--on Epitaph Records, a label founded by their guitarist, Brett Gurewitz. Punk bands
had learned long ago to either find a like-minded indie label or simply put the music out on their own.</TE>
<TE>Seven years of touring regionally and one year of touring nationally passed before the band members considered a trip to Europe. They would be one of the first punk bands from the skateparks of the West to make the leap across the Atlantic. Their
European DIY-booking agency, Pied Piper, warned that they should lower their expectations--not every punk band that landed in Europe played to sold-out shows. Band members had some concern about the trip, but Epitaph had exported about 6,000 of their
albums to Semaphore, an independent distributor in the Netherlands, and they figured, at the very least, they'd get to see Europe.</TE>
<TE>Band members were shocked when they played their first show in 1989. ''To our great surprise, when we landed there and had our first show in Germany, we were huge,'' Brett Gurewitz says. ''They were spilling into the street . . . Everywhere we went . .
. Every single show in Germany had kids crawling the ceiling.''</TE>
<TE>The punk rock scene in Europe had been born in the late 1970s with the Sex Pistols and the Clash, among other groups, and there was a healthy punk scene of English and German bands. Many of these groups reflected the European political spectrum that
swung much further to the right and left than in the United States; punk rock was not foreign or shocking but an already established musical form. So what was so compelling about Bad Religion?</TE>
<TE>In attempting to gauge this moment in history, musicians and musicologists arrive at one common theme: authenticity. Here was a band that punk rock fans had read about or heard on import records, and now the band was in their midst. Something brand new
and fresh. American punk rock bands had the reputation of putting on an electric stage show filled with adrenalin and sweat: The lead singer was part preacher, part possessed madman, grabbing the microphone from the stand and roaming the stage from end
to end like a stalking animal, then walking to the edge of the stage and confronting the audience with his lyrics and leaping directly into their midst. The music, along with the kinetic stage show, where you never knew what would happen next, left the
audience wanting more.</TE>
<TE>Bad Religion's good start overseas got better. When the band shipped 100,000 copies of the 1990 album ''Against the Grain,'' 40,000 went to Europe. Their popularity grew as they toured an average of 20 shows a year in Europe for the next five years.
They also began bringing over other punk bands from California. NOFX had signed with Epitaph; they opened for Bad Religion in Europe and formed a sizable following of their own. Fat Mike of NOFX started a record label with his wife, Erin, called Fat
Wreck Chords and began bringing over label bands such as Lagwagon. This process of introducing new bands to European fans was repeated over and over, and soon many bands had a larger following in Europe than in the States.</TE>
<TE>Coincidentally, the system that the American punk bands had created and relied upon to survive in the United States was the key to success in Europe: touring in conjunction with magazine publicity, street postering and word of mouth. One of the major
factors in their success was that that European radio is not involved in marketing bands.</TE>
<TE>In the United States, radio drives the music scene. The stations are owned by a handful of corporations and pandered to by deep-pocketed radio promoters with connections to the major labels. The stations are formatted into specific categories with
similar strict playlists, and this streamlining over the entire country generates national hits. But the system shuts out low-budgeted indie labels and alternative idiosyncratic music that doesn't fit neatly into pre-molded market niches.</TE>
<TE>In Europe, the stations are owned by various companies and, sometimes, the government. Formats exist in which different styles of music are presented every day. There is no consistency in the playlists from station to station so there isn't the
frequency of play to generate hits. ''In Europe they don't have 50 different stations playing the same format and regurgitating the same 12 songs,'' says Stormy Shepherd of Leave Home Booking, which books punk bands such as NOFX, the Offspring,
Lagwagon
and T.S.O.L. in the United States. ''Over there, fans become personally invested. They get into that band and they go see their shows. I think that's why so many bands have longer careers there.''</TE>
<TE>Blues musicians could attest to the same experience. They had been ignored by American radio, major labels and the mainstream. But in 1962, the American Folk Blues Festival was started and became a tremendous hit overseas, playing 2,000-seat concert
halls throughout Europe. Jim Fricke, senior curator at the Experience Music Project, explains: ''It was wild because the musicians would leave their tenements on the South Side of Chicago and go to Europe and be stars, then come back and be destitute
again.''</TE>
<TE>American blues and jazz were lauded for their soulful nature and were easily integrated into the more linguistically complex European landscape because the listener didn't need to translate lyrics. Punk rock was appreciated in much the same way, and
the
language barrier became less of an issue for American punk rock bands as the '90s progressed and English became the second language of choice for much of the world. American punk rock bands found that audiences in Germany, Italy and Slovenia were
singing the lyrics along with them.</TE>
<TE>By 1993, Epitaph had a catalog consisting of the band L7, Bad Religion, NOFX, Pennywise, Rancid, Down by Law and the Offspring and was selling a million records a year; about 400,000 of those sales were in Europe. That year the Offspring traveled to
Europe with NOFX. By 1994 their third album, ''Smash,'' exploded onto the scene, selling 10 million units worldwide to date. This dwarfed anything Epitaph had ever done, paving the way for a full-blown office and warehouse in Europe. The underpinnings
for this brand of California punk rock had been firmly established in Europe, but the entire West coast lifestyle had yet to be unveiled.</TE>
<TE>In March of '95, at Big Bear's Snow Summit, Kevin Lyman was producing Board-Aid, an annual snowboarding event that raised money for the fight against AIDS. Each year at Snow Summit or Bear Mountain, there was a half-pipe snowboard competition, and
Lyman
would bring in a half-pipe for skateboarders and recruit bands--The Offspring, Porno for Pyros--to play the events.</TE>
<TE>That year, Lyman was sitting in the snow observing the event's success, the people in attendance throwing themselves exuberantly into the snowboarding, skateboarding and the music, and he was reminded of Steve Alba and Duane Peters skateboarding at the
Pipeline Skatepark in the '70s, of the Vision Skate Escape in 1988 at UC Irvine's Bren Events Center, where the Red Hot Chili Peppers played during the finals and 5,000 people went wild. ''I just thought, 'Wait a second, this lifestyle is starting to
really come together,' ''says Lyman.</TE>
<TE>He had worked as a stage manager for Lollapalooza, the first touring rock show of its kind in the States, a circus of Generation-X culture, and now he envisioned a touring road show featuring ska, punk and alternative music with Extreme Sports. He
would
call it ''Warped Tour.''</TE>
<TE>The first year was a learning experience. Skateboarders, BMXers, in-line skaters and half a dozen bands toured 24 cities. The set-up consisted of a main stage for the musicians and a half-pipe and street course for the athletes in each city. The
average
attendance was only 2,000. So in '96, Lyman convinced NOFX and Pennywise to do the tour. ''They added a credibility factor when they endorsed the tour,'' Lyman says. The decision was also made to keep the ticket price low, $15 at the time, to make it
accessible for any kid who wanted to experience the lifestyle.</TE>
<TE>Vans, a footwear and clothing manufacturer associated with the skate-punk world from the beginning, bought into the package, creating the Vans Warped Tour. Vans integrated the Amateur World Skateboarding Contest trials into the tour. These trials would
happen at each stop, making the tour an important fixture in the skateboarding world. Attendance doubled.</TE>
<TE>Over the years in the States, the tour grew to a dozen headlining bands and a side stage of local bands. Hip-hop and rap were added to the music, and mountain bikes, rollerskating, freestyle moto-cross joined the sports side. In 2001, its seventh year,
the Vans Warped tour attracted 467,000 people in 44 cities, becoming a focal point for the lifestyle. In 1996, the Tour went to Europe for the first time. By '98 and '99, the Vans Warped Tour was performing 12 to 14 shows in stadiums like the Plaza de
Toros in Pamplona, using much the same package as in the States with a few European bands thrown in to bolster the draw.</TE>
<TE>David Pollack of Destiny Tourbooking in Berlin, a transplanted American from the West Coast who specialized in punk bands from the United States, had watched the Vans Warped Tour operate in Europe. He saw the potential as a marketing tool, exposing new
bands to crowds of thousands and jump-starting their careers overseas. In '99, he unveiled his own spin on the Warped Tour called Deconstruction Tour, with NOFX leading a handful of bands throughout Europe. By 2000, Deconstruction was benefiting from a
resurgence of punk rock in England. At Stratford's Three Mills Island, in the east end of London, 11,000 attendees paid about $20 for the Deconstruction Tour. Before launching into the finale, Fat Mike of NOFX pronounced, ''This is the biggest punk
rock
show in London ever, and there's no major labels, no MTV and no radio.''</TE>
<TE>The California immigrants appear to have successfully grafted their skate-punk culture to the European punk scene from Pamplona to London to Milan. According to Columbia University sociologist Todd Gitlin, author of ''Media Unlimited,'' a book that
discusses the spread of American culture abroad, the phenomenon is not surprising. ''Going back to the 19th century, Europeans were fascinated by American wildness and vulgarity. I mean Buffalo Bill's Wild West show was a huge success. Played for
months,'' Gitlin says. ''There's a sense that Americans found freedom and broke loose of European refinement and constraint. Pieces of American culture are appreciated as being emblematic of innocence, childishness, and informality, and that has an
allure for Europeans.''</TE>
<TE>In 2001, the Deconstruction Tour saw an increase in attendance and other punk rock/extreme sports festivals have emerged. Epitaph sold about 4 million records worldwide, 35% to 40% of those sales in Europe. This year, Deconstruction bands toured Europe
in May and June, including dates in Prague, Lisbon, and Glasgow. The scene has been boosted by the World Wide Web, making the distance between the West Coast and Europe only a click away. ''The Internet is the best thing to happen to punk rock, it's
like a giant virtual fanzine with a portal to every punker that has a computer,'' Brett Gurewitz says. ''Punk rock has really always been about community, and now these communities exist in another paradigm, virtually and across the globe.''</TE>

<DH>No One Has Ever Seen a Gravitational Wave, but Caltech's Kip Thorne and Other Physicists Are Convinced They Exist and Are the Key to Understanding Time, Space and the Universe. Now They're Weeks Away From a $530-Million Experiment That Could
Prove Them Right--or Wrong.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PRESTON LERNER</AU>
<BD>Preston Lerner last wrote for the magazine about car designer Freeman Thomas.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Kip Thorne's got chalk skills. serious chalk skills.</LD>
<LD>At the moment, he's blanketing a blackboard with equations so densely packed with Greek letters, mathematical symbols and superscripts that they look more like abstract art than any recognizable form of human discourse. To the nonscientist, the scene
has the theatrical, you've-got-to-be-kidding-me feel of an outtake from "A Beautiful Mind"--the manic scientist cranking out arcane formulas while onlookers gaze in wonder.</LD>
<LD>But this isn't a Hollywood set. It's a lounge on the campus of Caltech, where Thorne is the Feynman Professor of Theoretical Physics and just about every room, restrooms excepted, is furnished with a blackboard. This particular Wednesday evening, the
lounge is packed with nearly two dozen graduate students, doctoral candidates and postdocs. Several are members of the research group Thorne runs with fellow professor Lee Lindblom. But most of them are sitting in on the group's weekly meeting simply
because they've heard that Thorne is going to be "posing some interesting problems." And they smile when he says, "I had some time on my hands so I thought I'd think about physics."</LD>
<TE>Thirty-two years ago, when Thorne became one of the youngest full professors in the history of the California Institute of Technology, he was a longhair partial to funky pendants and bell bottoms. Today, as an eminence grise in black-hole research and
gravitational-wave studies--fields he helped create--he looks like a cross between Santa Claus and a tortured El Greco saint, with a mane of flowing hair and a white beard framing attenuated features, a gaunt face and ruddy complexion. At 62, he's
slightly hunched, and he has a vocal tic similar to a hiccup. Yet his students regard him with the respect that martial arts students bestow upon their senseis.</TE>
<TE>They nod knowingly when he explains, "I'm not concerned about delta H over H. I'm interested in delta H over G, where G is a typical metric coefficient." They listen attentively as he delivers a characteristically gentle rebuke: "I think you might want
to look more closely at the problem. It's not just the spin-supplementary condition. It's also radiation-reaction averaging." They jot down notes when he asks them, "So how do we get past the standing-wave problem to the real problem? That's the
question I want to raise as LIGO comes online."</TE>
<TE>Thorne is a co-founder of the Laser Interferometer Gravitational-Wave Observatory. Big name, big mission: LIGO is designed to detect ripple-like disturbances in the theoretical "fabric" of space and time known as gravitational waves, whose existence
was
first posited by Albert Einstein in 1916 but which have yet to be observed despite decades of searching. Detecting this great white whale of black-hole physics would verify the underpinnings of Einstein's general theory of relativity. Also, the waves
are expected to contain information that would unlock the mysteries of black holes and give us a dramatic new window on the secrets of the universe.</TE>
<TE>Time out for a quick physics primer: Einstein's theories of relativity hold that space and time are--yep, you got it--relative rather than absolute. According to Einstein, the universe is best thought of in terms of a four-dimensional fabric known as
spacetime. Gravity can cause this fabric to warp, contort, oscillate and basically do anything short of the lambada. But nowhere does spacetime undergo stranger, stronger distortions than in and around the stellar phenomena known as black holes--dead
stars that have collapsed to form masses so dense their gravitational pull prevents even light from escaping, therefore rendering them invisible.</TE>
<TE>Black holes are ciphers by definition; we infer their existence from the powerful effect they have on the space around them. But while they emit no light, radio waves or X-rays, they do send out waves made of the same stuff as the holes
themselves--warped spacetime. These so-called gravitational waves are undulations in the fabric of space-time, like the ripples caused by dropping a stone in a pond. The biggest waves are produced by the most cataclysmic events--a supernova, say, or
the
collision of two black holes. These waves contain the story of their own creation, and we could play them back like high-fidelity tapes--if only we could detect them.</TE>
<TE>"I and many other relativity theorists have spent much of our lives working with the mathematics of general relativity, trying to understand what it predicts--for example, predictions it makes about black holes," Thorne says. "But we have almost no
experimental data to support these predictions. And when we get to the most interesting situations--where space and time are oscillating, twisting, vibrating, distorting--we don't know how to solve the equations. Gravitational waves will allow us to
watch space-time distort rapidly, in large magnitudes. Then we can go back and forth between theory and observation to finally figure out how everything hangs together."</TE>
<TE>Like a brainy, genial Ahab, Thorne has been chasing gravitational waves for nearly a quarter-century. Thanks largely to his tireless efforts, two enormous observatories have been built, one in Louisiana and another 2,000 miles away in Washington state.
Housed within these odd structures are devices called interferometers that are designed to detect gravitational waves by measuring movements of almost incomprehensible smallness.</TE>
<TE>Now, with the first scientific data runs just weeks away, Thorne is about to see his lifelong vision come into focus. Even so, he suspects that gravitational waves won't be detected until second-generation interferometers are built. "I wish we didn't
have to do it in two steps," he says. "I wish we hadn't had to build a $300-million facility to make it happen. I wish we could have done it on a tabletop. But nature just isn't made that way."</TE>
<TE>No matter what LIGO finds--or doesn't find--Thorne's reputation is secure. Oddly enough, it has less to do with his own scientific achievements than with creating an environment for others to make award-winning breakthroughs. He's been an evangelist
for
black-hole and gravitational-wave physics, not only luring nonbelievers but also drumming up donations (a.k.a. federal funding). He's been an effective mediator between traditional scientific adversaries--theorists and experimentalists, for instance,
and astronomers and physicists. But most important, he has inspired young scientists to follow his example and imprinted them with his own qualities. Equal parts Mr. Chips and Mr. Wizard, Thorne is the Pied Piper of theoretical physics.</TE>
<TE>"He's a fantastic mentor. There is a whole cabal of former students who still admire him very, very much," says Clifford Will, chairman of the physics department at Washington University in St. Louis. "Not only did he motivate us to become better
scientists, but he also inspired us to be better listeners and teachers." Adds another former student, Richard Price, now a professor of physics at the University of Utah: "Kip was one of the first scientists to take general relativity, which most
people saw as an intellectual curio, and apply it to astrophysics. But more than any single theoretical breakthrough, he will be remembered for populating this new field with students. He taught them how to behave--morally, ethically and
scientifically."</TE>
<TE>Thorne is the co-author of one of the only science textbooks long-lived enough to justify being called a classic. (Pirated editions of "Gravitation" are still being printed in Kurdistan 30 years after the book's initial publication.) At the other end
of
the spectrum, he also wrote the pop-science bestseller "Black Holes &amp; Time Warps: Einstein's Outrageous Legacy," which, along with more serious subjects, detailed his blueprint for a time machine and prompted Caltech President David Baltimore to dub
him
"Caltech's number-one strange scientist, the prince of counterintuitive science."</TE>
<TE>Some of Thorne's friends wonder if he might have achieved more personally if he had spent more time on his own research and less on mentoring his charges. But Thorne waves this notion aside. "I feel I've had a deep influence on science through my
students," he says. "If you take a look at what my students have done while they were students, forgetting about what they've done afterward, you'll find that they've collectively accomplished more than I could have done on my own."</TE>
<TE>LIGO is big science. Capital B, capital S. To date, $365 million has been spent on two separate facilities in Hanford, Wash., and Livingston, La. An additional $165 million has already been committed over the next five years to upgrade to
second-generation interferometers. This makes LIGO the most ambitious project ever funded by the National Science Foundation.</TE>
<TE>The LIGO facilities look every bit as strange as the gravitational waves they were built to detect. In aerial photographs, they look like giant crop circles left behind by inscrutable aliens. Splayed out at right angles to the angular central structure
are two spindly legs that resemble giant pipelines leading to nowhere. Encased within each one of these long half-cylinders--picture Quonset huts 2 1/2 miles long--is a 4-foot-diameter vacuum tube. A mirror dangles from a wire at the end of each leg.
When the interferometer is running, a steadily shining laser beam in the central structure is split in two. These beams shoot down the two tubes, bounce off the dangling mirrors and return to the center. There they merge and "interfere" with each
other.</TE>
<TE>Here's where things get tricky. Astrophysicists say gravitational waves are constantly wafting across the universe, causing space to stretch along one axis and squeeze along the other. This distortion is so minuscule that we don't ever notice it.
(Ditto, fortunately, for nearly all of the most dramatic effects of general relativity.) The problem, of course, is that it's also too small for scientists to detect.</TE>
<TE>Enter the interferometer. When an especially powerful gravitational wave from a distant universe passes over a LIGO site, the space around one leg ought to shrink while the space around the other stretches. This should cause the mirrors within to
quiver
ever so slightly. Less than slightly, actually. Infinitesimally hardly begins to describe it. LIGO director Barry Barish pegs the movement at 10 to the minus-18th meters, or ten billionth's the diameter of a hydrogen atom.</TE>
<TE>Still, this would be enough to nudge the two returning laser beams out of phase, causing their interference to change. This modified interference should reveal the shape, or form, of the passing gravitational wave in much the same way that sound can be
charted on an oscilloscope. (Besides mounting the interferometers on exotic shock absorbers, the scientists built two LIGO facilities in different parts of the country to rule out seismic vibration or other so-called noise as the cause of any observed
movement.)</TE>
<TE>"If and when LIGO detects gravitational waves, it'll be a big deal," Thorne says. "But our goal has never been detection alone. It's been to use these waves to explore aspects of the universe and fundamental physics that we can't explore any other way.
We want to be able to make maps of the warpage of space-time. We want to see how warped space-time behaves when two black holes collide. We should be able to see things unlike anything we've seen before."</TE>
<TE>For virtually all of human existence, our knowledge of the cosmos has been limited to what we could observe with our own eyes, either unaided or through optical telescopes. But the 1940s brought the development of radio telescopes and, soon after,
other
alternative observational devices that expanded the distances we could see and gave us our first glimpse of phenomena such as pulsars and quasars. Despite these advances, our vision is still limited to objects that emit electromagnetic waves--light
waves, gamma rays, X-rays and so on. This accounts for only a puny slice of the universe. Gravitational waves, on the other hand, should allow us to observe black holes and other matter that remains shrouded from our sight.</TE>
<TE>Astrophysicists have already produced reasonably firm evidence of gravitational waves. In 1993, the Nobel Prize for physics was awarded in part for this discovery. But the waves themselves remain elusive. And if it turns out that they don't exist, then
there's a serious problem with the concept of relativity.</TE>
<TE>In 1905 and 1916, Albert Einstein published his special and general theories of relativity. With these two papers, he demolished the foundations of Newtonian physics and reimagined our universe. By 1919, with the publication of proof that an extremely
large mass, in this case our sun, caused light to bend, general relativity was confirmed and Einstein was hailed as a genius. But for several decades, some of the more implausible implications of general relativity--the existence of gravitational
waves,
for example--were ignored or dismissed as mathematical oddities.</TE>
<TE>Before physicists could tackle gravitational waves, first they had to puzzle out black holes. But because astronomers couldn't see them, black holes were regarded with skepticism, if not outright derision, until the late 1950s.</TE>
<TE>By happy coincidence, this was when student Kip Thorne arrived at Caltech, a scientist both by nature and nurture. He is the eldest child of two academics: His father was a professor of soil chemistry at Utah State University, where his mother later
founded the women's studies program. (Two of his four siblings are professors.) His interest in science was fired at age 8, at a lecture about the solar system. "My mother and I worked out calculations for building our own model of the solar system,"
he
recalls. "The model consisted of drawing a 4-foot-diameter sun on the sidewalk near our house. Then we drew all the planets to scale [and] marched down the sidewalk to put them in the right place. The shock was finding that Pluto was in the next town!"</TE>
<TE>After earning an undergraduate degree from Caltech, he pursued his doctorate at Princeton University under relativist John Wheeler. Besides being a titan of mid-century physics, Wheeler was an inspirational mentor. Teacher and pupil were well matched,
and they became two of the architects of a heady period known as the golden age of black-hole research. During this remarkable period, between the early 1960s and the mid-1970s, Wheeler coined the term black hole and the first such object--Cygnus
X-1--was identified. Meanwhile, Thorne returned to Caltech to teach and put together his own ambitious, impassioned research group.</TE>
<TE>"I called it the Children's Crusade of general relativity," says William Press, a student of Thorne and Wheeler who's now deputy director of science and technology at the Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico. "Except for John Wheeler, almost
everybody in the field was very young, and it was a period of endless promise. At Caltech, if you were interested in general relativity, you studied with Kip. He couldn't take on enough graduate students."</TE>
<TE>But by 1975, after a decade of spectacular progress, theoretical physicists ran up against an experimental roadblock. As Thorne puts it: "We had pretty much done all we could do in terms of mathematical solutions or approximation techniques, and the
only way to make major progress was either through computer simulations or through observations, or both. Only now, in 2002, thanks to supercomputers and LIGO, are we on the verge of both approaches coming to fruition. But there's been a long period of
building the right tools."</TE>
<TE>One November night in 1976, Thorne wandered the streets of South Pasadena, seeking direction. "I was sure that if we were successful in detecting gravitational waves, it would have a profound impact on our understanding of black holes and the
universe,"
he says. "But the waves are so weak and the task of detecting them was so daunting that I wasn't sure the odds of success were high enough that I should urge Caltech to get involved in the business."</TE>
<TE>In the end, he decided that the potential reward outweighed the risk. He subsequently became part of a triumvirate with two experimentalists--Rainer Weiss of MIT, who invented the gravity-wave interferometer, and Ron Drever of Caltech, who refined
it--and set about trying to sell the program to the National Science Foundation, the federal agency created to support blue-sky research on the frontier of pure science. Twice they failed. In 1989, on their third try, with former Caltech provost Robbie
Vogt as LIGO director, they finally came up with a winning plan. Even then, they had to run a five-year gantlet of reviews before getting the foundation's ultimate go-ahead in 1994.</TE>
<TE>These days, Thorne and his students are designing second- and third-generation interferometers. He's also organizing a Caltech supercomputer effort to simulate colliding black holes and other cosmic cataclysms. He stresses--forcefully and
repeatedly--that he's not involved with the day-to-day operation of LIGO, and he insists that the bulk of the credit for the program belongs to the experimentalists who built and run the interferometers. "I'm just a theorist," he says, "and I'm quite
concerned that my role not be overplayed."</TE>
<TE>Thorne's colleagues chuckle when they hear this assessment. "That sounds just like Kip," says Sandor Kovacs, a former student-turned-physician who teaches at the Washington University School of Medicine. No less an authority than Thorne's longtime
friend Stephen Hawking has said, "I don't think [LIGO] would have happened if he hadn't pushed it so hard."</TE>
<TE>This thought is echoed by Vladimir Braginsky of Moscow State University, who's been working with Thorne since long before the end of the Cold War. "LIGO could not have gone forward without Kip Thorne. It will be his legacy. This project will live in
the
memory of mankind for centuries."</TE>
<TE>In his narrow, nondescript office at Caltech, Thorne grabs an old notebook from a bulging bookcase and opens it at random to a page filled with meticulously neat, handwritten formulas not unlike the ones he'd scrawled across the blackboard at the
weekly
meeting of his research group a few days earlier. These are his own notes, taken when he was a student struggling to keep up with the ferocious competition.</TE>
<TE>"When I arrived at Caltech, I took a bus to the freshman orientation camp," he recalls. "On the way, all the kids were quoting their IQs, and mine was 10 points below everybody else's. I had a pretty rough time keeping up that first year. So I started
identifying the important ideas that were being taught and writing my own analyses of where they came from and how they related to each other. So instead of having textbooks with some underlining as my major source of information, I had my own
summaries. I think this process enabled me to understand things more deeply than other people and allowed me to make connections that they didn't see."</TE>
<TE>These days, Thorne does most of his serious thinking at a getaway on the wild Oregon coast and in the north Pasadena home he shares with his second wife, Carolee Winstein, a professor of biokinesiolgy and physical therapy at USC. (Thorne has two grown
children from a previous marriage.) His office was designed by his son, an architect. It's filled with exquisite woodworking crafted by his brother, who builds artisanal furniture. In this airy room ringed with windows, he pores over calculations for
four or five hours at a stretch--a grinder, he insists, who succeeds by doggedness rather than genius.</TE>
<TE>Self-effacing to a fault, Thorne waffled mightily when he was offered the Feynman chair at Caltech.  "Feynman was a close friend, somebody I admired and idolized," he says. "But it was difficult because I'm obviously not in his class scientifically. Of
course, not many people are." Thorne laughs. "My genius, if you can call it that, has been picking areas where there was a lot of elbow room and something to be learned, and I've carefully avoided areas where there was a lot of activity by a lot of
good
theorists."</TE>
<TE>In one field, actually, Thorne has emerged--much to his amusement--as the world's most celebrated thinker. His friend Carl Sagan once asked him to vet the time-travel section of the manuscript that would eventually be published as "Contact" and then
filmed as a movie starring Jodie Foster. Thorne immediately dismissed Sagan's hypothesis. But while driving on the I-5, west of Fresno, he had an epiphany: It might be possible to use a wormhole--a shortcut through the fabric of space-time--as a time
machine.</TE>
<TE>Most scientists would have dismissed such speculation as pointless. Not only was the subject highly speculative, but it also carried the whiff of ridicule. Nevertheless, Thorne examined it with the same rigor he applies to any other subject, and he and
two students published a paper titled "Wormholes, Time Machines, and the Weak Energy Condition." To this day, Thorne remains a hero to science-fiction cultists because of that and other papers.</TE>
<TE>Thorne's own hero, of course, is Einstein, the patron saint of relativity. And so, this afternoon, before teaching his own class in gravitational waves, he is himself a student at a Caltech lecture being given by one of his former pupils. The subject
is
"Einstein and the Astronomers: Testing Relativity 1914--1933." Forty professors, researchers, administrators and students listen while Daniel Kennefick, dressed incongruously in shorts, traces the journey by which Einstein arrived at his general theory
of relativity.</TE>
<TE>In the middle of the presentation, a research scientist challenges the figure Kennefick has cited for an orbital anomaly of Mercury--an anomaly that baffled astronomers until Einstein explained it.</TE>
<TE>"Kip?" Kennefick asks hopefully of his one-time graduate advisor. Thorne digs into his briefcase and pulls out a pen. While the lecture continues, he scribbles calculations on a manila folder. Then he announces: "It's 43 seconds of arcs per century,
not
0.43."</TE>
<TE>After the lecture, Thorne deconstructs his parlor trick in a way that would make sense to precious few people on the planet: "Well, I knew in order of magnitude that the size of the sun divided by the size it would have if it were a black hole is about
100,000. So the typical magnitudes of relativistic effects near the surface of the sun are about a part in 100,000. Mercury's orbit is out maybe something like 30 solar radii from the sun. So relativistic effect on Mercury's orbit ought to be a factor
of 30 times smaller, or about 3 parts in 10 million. So the perihelion shift per orbit ought to be about 3 parts in million of a circuit. Then I just had to convert this into an angular shift per century." Thorne smiles sheepishly. "I should have known
the number off the top of my head, but my memory is lousy."</TE>
<TE>As he strides across the campus to his own lecture hall, Thorne pauses to chat briefly with an old man sitting on a bench. "That was Jerry Wasserburg," he explains later. "He showed that the solar system is 4.58 billion years old. He won the
[equivalent
of] the Nobel Prize for geology. He's a wonderful man, approaching 80 now but still doing wonderful research."</TE>
<TE>Twenty years from now, chances are somebody will be saying the same thing about Kip Thorne.</TE>

<AU>ERIC STONE</AU>
<BD>Eric Stone is a freelance writer based in Los Angeles.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>There is no nice way to say this. When i was growing up in the 1960s, I thought my Uncle Fred was sort of a loser. He was likable, with a great sense of humor. He was eccentric in ways that were amusing. But Uncle Fred's Horatio Alger-like older
brother--my dad--was his boss.</LD>
<LD>Today, at 72, Fred Stone is arguably the world's greatest painter of racehorses. Enormous murals of his work are displayed from Moscow to Hollywood Park. Queen Elizabeth keeps a set of dinnerware that he designed. A poster of one of his paintings is
being used in a nationwide fund-raising drive for the families of the firefighters who died at the World Trade Center. In his own peculiar, late-blooming way, he is one of the most successful people I know.</LD>
<LD>Painting wasn't the first love of my uncle's life. Family lore has it that he could have been a major league baseball player but he hurt his arm at age 16. His last game was against a team of adult professionals. Fred pitched a no-hitter through eight
and two-thirds innings, and then he either won or lost the game depending on whether you trust his or my father's memory.</LD>
<TE>So Uncle Fred turned to the other great love of his life: painting and drawing. My grandfather, who worked two jobs to keep the family poor but not destitute through the Depression, couldn't afford to buy good drawing paper, so he bought his son rolls
of butcher paper. (Fred has said he was happy to have anything to draw on.)</TE>
<TE>In the late 1940s, he went to the Art Center School, now the Art Center College of Design in Pasadena, and then tried to make it as a commercial artist. ''But I couldn't cut it,'' Fred says now. He was too slow, ''too meticulous.''</TE>
<TE>After that, he got a job painting sets for movies and TV shows, including ''Studio One,'' ''Playhouse 90'' and ''Rawhide.'' He loved it, but he suffered from the same ailment: He couldn't work quickly enough to satisfy the deadlines.</TE>
<TE>Fred then started a mural business with a partner named Harold Kramer. ''He was an irascible guy,'' my uncle says, ''but I considered him a great artist.'' Kramer would do sketches and paintings, and Fred would sell them to architects as murals. ''We
were doing pretty good,'' Fred recalls, ''but then Kramer got squirrelly. He was always fighting with the clients. If they wanted figurative, he wanted abstract. Then we got a job to do an outdoor mural for a savings and loan. It was supposed to be the
history of motion pictures. So Kramer paints it, and it was the most magnificent, totally pornographic mural. He insisted we give it to the client. We did and they threw us out.''</TE>
<TE>Fred quit the mural business.</TE>
<TE>By this time, the late '50s, my uncle was married with two kids, so when my father offered him a job, he accepted. ''I thought I was giving up art forever, and felt that now I was just going to be taken care of by my brother.''</TE>
<TE>It was a strange turn on the career path. Monogram Industries was a diversified conglomerate, but its core business was producing toilets for airplanes. The Culver City company started a division selling ''marine self-contained sanitation
systems''--boat toilets that didn't just dump the waste into the water--and Fred became its chief salesman.</TE>
<TE>The Clean Water Act was still a long way off and self-contained toilets for pleasure boats were a tough sell. No one was going to buy them unless forced to. So Fred spent years lobbying state governments and environmental departments for laws
restricting the dumping of waste into waterways. By the time he was finished, the marine division was one of the company's most successful.</TE>
<TE>My uncle the artist was a terrific toilet salesman.</TE>
<TE>Finally, in 1976 at the age of 46, with his self-confidence restored by his success in sales and his bank account full enough to provide a buffer for a year or two, Fred quit Monogram, grew a mustache and went back to art.</TE>
<TE>First he tried the galleries, but he couldn't paint fast enough to satisfy the commercial requirements of exhibition. (Gallery owners wanted at least 12 paintings ready within six months; Fred averages about one a month.)</TE>
<TE>Then his daughter, my cousin Laura, who had just started work at Santa Anita Park, said: ''Why don't you come out to the track and paint the racehorses?''</TE>
<TE>Fred was dubious. ''My first ever commercial job was to paint the Lone Ranger and Tonto riding across the desert for a coloring book. I had no problem with the Lone Ranger and Tonto, but the horses were so bad that I kept delaying the job. Finally I
had
to turn it in and my boss said, 'These guys look like they're riding rabbits.' ''</TE>
<TE>But this time Fred got the horses right. ''That's the way a horse looks,'' says Robert Bradley, a veterinarian for the Los Angeles Equestrian Center.</TE>
<TE>At first Fred painted horse portraits for their owners, but the work was slow-going and he wasn't making much money. Then he heard about the limited-edition print market--a way, he says, ''to create a painting with legs.'' So he painted in watercolor
and issued limited editions of prints. He traveled to print shows looking for a publisher and was told that no one buys horse prints. He became his own publisher. Then he went to shows to find dealers and they, too, said that no one wanted horse art.
That's how my Uncle Fred got into the mail-order business, taking out ads in horse magazines and releasing his work in the ''horse community.''</TE>
<TE>In 25 years Fred has produced 80 editions, each ranging from 400 prints in the early years to 1,500 prints in the last 15 years. All but two or three of those editions are sold out.</TE>
<TE>Caroline Burgeson, owner of the Paddock Room Galleries in Ocala, Fla., recalls hearing that Fred's print commemorating the jockey Bill Shoemaker's 8,000th win, issued in an edition of 400, sold on the secondary market for $10,000. She sold one for
$7,500. Fred's original paintings seldom come to market, although Burgeson once offered one for $12,000. She believes some of his other paintings, of more famous horses, would sell for a great deal more.</TE>
<TE>Fred also has produced a couple hundred thousand collector's plates, a couple hundred thousand posters and a limited-edition book. He got back into the mural business, making wall-sized digital reproductions of his work. The Paris Las Vegas hotel has
one--it's 120 feet long. Fred's murals hang on the walls of racetracks all over the U.S., in Canada, Austria, the Czech Republic and Russia. His work also hangs at Hollywood Park, Del Mar and Santa Anita.</TE>
<TE>When my uncle was growing up, the most important influence on his artistic life was Norman Rockwell, and Fred isn't happy about the way Rockwell was treated by the art world. ''He used to say he was just an illustrator. He wasn't a real artist. He was
never accepted. Now, how many years later, they are finally allowing him in a museum. A Rockwell retrospective opened at New York's Guggenheim last fall.''</TE>
<TE>Fred will never have a retrospective in a major art museum, and you can tell that bothers him a little. But he is not, and never was, a loser.</TE>

<HD>Anatolia, Where the Past Is the Present</HD>
<DH>Eastern Turkey, home of Mt. Ararat, is an open-air museum. Now it is also tourist-friendly.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUSAN E. JAMES</AU>

<DL>DIYARBAKIR, Turkey</DL>
<LD>My mother always wanted to see Mt. Ararat. Not so much for the Noah story, but because, like Timbuktu, it seemed impossibly remote. I always wanted to see the Silk Road town of Diyarbakir for much the same reason. Both are in eastern Turkey, and for
the
last several decades, both have been extraordinarily difficult to get to. Until recently, this area was so politically sensitive that the Turkish government actively discouraged tourists from going there. That has changed.</LD>
<LD>Turkey, eager to join the European Union, has made great strides toward turning its eastern provinces into a tourist destination. Peace agreements with Kurdish nationalists--longtime violent foes of the Turkish government--have helped ease tensions.</LD>
<LD>In June, Mother and I found a British tour group going to the places we had dreamed of seeing. We signed up at once.</LD>
<TE>The same fascination we felt is drawing more and more tourists to Turkey. Spanning two continents, thousands of years of history and dozens of ruling civilizations, Turkey is an open-air museum that intrigues many Westerners.</TE>
<TE>While the eastern part of the country, which we visited, offers tourists a share of hardships, it also offers adventurous travelers a look at some of the world's oldest archeological sites. It is a region astonishingly rich with the remains of scores
of
civilizations and empires, stretching from the Neolithic period to the early 20th century.</TE>
<TE>Our trip took us from L.A. by way of London to Istanbul, where we joined a group of 15. Istanbul straddles the border between Europe and Asia, the only city in the world built on two continents.</TE>
<TE>Anatolia, the Asiatic part of modern Turkey, is a peninsula between the Black Sea and the Mediterranean. It has always been the shortest land route between Europe and Asia, so people from both continents have swept across it since the end of the last
Ice Age in 12,000 BC. Greeks, Persians, Armenians, Mongols, Scythians, Georgians, Assyrians, Jews, Arabs and Celts all left their mark.</TE>
<TE>From Istanbul we flew to Trabzon, on the Black Sea, and boarded our tour bus. Three days later we were crossing a volcanic plain south of the town of Igdir when our guide, Fatih, half Kurdish and half Turkish, pointed to a cloud bank on the horizon and
announced "Mt. Ararat," believed to be the landing place of Noah's Ark.</TE>
<TE>The landscape was marked by eroded cinder cones and fields of ripening grain. Ararat, 16,945 feet high, was shy that afternoon, or maybe aristocratically aloof. Its snowcapped peak refused to come out from behind the cloud cover. As we got nearer, we
could make out the shape of Little Ararat, a companion cone, 12,877 feet high, which sits on the larger cone's flank.</TE>
<TE>Disappointed at being denied a better view, we drove into the frontier town of Dogubeyazit. Isolated and remote, the town has been nicknamed "Dog Biscuit" by those who pass through when it's too hot or too wet. We were lucky. The weather was beautiful,
and even Dogubeyazit's potholed streets looked picturesque.</TE>
<TE>Fatih led us into the tiny Krystal Cafe on a side street for lunch. Most eastern Turkish cafes have a glass-fronted counter right inside the main door, where the dishes sit cooking and the customer points to what he wants. At the end of the counter, a
cook threaded chunks of chicken and lamb on long skewers and popped them over an open fire. Standard fare in local cafes was chicken or lamb kebab with rice, yogurt and nan (flat bread), followed by a clay bowl of meshur sutlac, a delicious rice
custard
pudding. In two weeks, we never had a bad meal.</TE>
<TE>Fatih, a doctoral student in Turkish Neolithic history, was eager to show us as much as he could of his country. After lunch we headed three miles east of town and up a precipitously curved road to the late 17th century site of Isak Pasha Saray. An
acropolis of the Urartian empire (1200 BC) once stood on a promontory above the valley. Square-mouthed cave tombs with Persian-style friezes dotted the mountainside below it, but when we scrambled up to them, we found them flooded. The foundations of
later buildings also rest on the site, including a 16th century mosque built by Selim the Grim, father of Suleyman the Magnificent.</TE>
<TE>Holding pride of place on the promontory beneath the acropolis is the Isak Pasha Saray, a sprawling 366-room fortress-palace built by a Kurdish chieftain and his son.</TE>
<TE>We were fascinated by the rooms that once contained the harem. They were a series of identical, connecting rectangles with small hooded fireplaces that couldn't have given off much heat. Windows looked out on a sheer drop. From a hallway at the end of
the rooms, a long, dark staircase descended to a rocky patch of ground where wild poppies grew and the wind howled around the walls. It was labeled "The Harem Garden."</TE>
<TE>"The girls must have gone nuts up here day after day," Mother remarked.</TE>
<TE>I had no desire to move in, but when I saw our hotel a few hours later, I considered changing my mind. The Sim-Er Hotel back in Dogubeyazit was dusty, sprawling and strange. Towels were folded like white-winged butterflies on the ends of our beds, and
the bedcovers were draped over the floors almost to the walls. The plumbing had a tentative air about it, and when our sink fell off the wall the next morning, with a resounding crash that woke the entire floor, I can't say I was surprised.</TE>
<TE>But the saving grace of this dingy little domicile was the second-floor veranda that looked out on Mt. Ararat. By the time we had checked in and checked out the amenities, it was almost sunset, and Ararat had decided to put on a show. All the clouds
had
vanished, and the pristine beauty of its snow-covered peak shimmered in the pink light of the setting sun.</TE>
<TE>Mother and I sat on the veranda, drinks in hand, and admired its beauty.</TE>
<TE>The next day we continued south, arriving in the afternoon at the tip of Turkey's largest lake, the mineral-rich Lake Van. Ringed by snowcapped volcanoes, Van has a total surface larger than the country of Luxembourg. Once the heart of the Armenian
homeland, the area around Van now is home to many Kurds.</TE>
<TE>A Kurdish terrorist group, the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), is considered to have a presence in the eastern provinces of Turkey. Consequently, the U.S. State Department advises visitors to travel only during daylight hours and on major highways.</TE>
<TE>But we saw no indication of problems during our visit. We found the Kurds to be friendly and hospitable. At rest stops all along the road, picnicking Kurdish families offered us tea and smiles.</TE>
<TE>At the town of Van we checked into the Tusba Hotel on the lake. The view was great, but the brine flies weren't.</TE>
<TE>Lunch was under blue awnings on the beach. Despite the high alkalinity of the water, a sardine-like silver fish with great pale eyes lives in the lake. We tried this local delicacy but found it bony and very salty. "They taste like they're
pre-pickled,"
Mother said. The farm-raised local trout were better, and the local beer was the best of all.</TE>
<TE>Small boats run from the docks near the restaurant to the Akdamar, an islet where in 921 the Armenian king Gagik Artzuni built a palace, a monastery and the Church of the Holy Cross. The palace and monastery are long gone, but the church, with its
folkloric carvings and frescoes, still stands.</TE>
<TE>Hauling groups of tourists, the boatmen raced to the island. The strong breeze felt wonderful and blew away all the brine flies.</TE>
<TE>We landed and clambered up to the top of the small hill where the church was perched. Fatih pointed out carvings on its basalt facade: Adam and Eve smiling smugly by the Tree of Knowledge, and David looking less than happy at discovering the size of
Goliath. Good old King Gagik himself appeared among the carvings together with his brother. Both were larger than the figure of Jesus nearby. So much for false modesty.</TE>
<TE>Long before the Armenian kingdoms occupied this area, the kings of Urartu (or Ararat) covered the hilltops with forts and palaces. Fifteen miles southeast of the town of Van, at Cavustepe, King Sardur II built the castle of Sarduri-Hinili between 764
and 735 BC. It is on a high hill, and the hike is exhausting--especially in the heat of the afternoon--but the view from the top is spectacular.</TE>
<TE>The ruins of the Urartian city, dating to the 8th century BC, lie below. A 3,000-year-old irrigation canal skirts the hill. In Sardur's mountaintop temple, at one end of the ruins, cuneiform-inscribed black basalt blocks look as if they were carved
yesterday. Like Gagik's church carvings, they told us that Sardur was one heck of a guy.</TE>
<TE>Huffing and puffing down the hill, we were delighted to find a tea garden by a lake only a few minutes' walk away.</TE>
<TE>As usual, the place was crowded with picnicking Kurdish families. We ordered soft drinks, but a young Kurdish couple at the next table poured out small glasses of apple tea and brought them over to us. Pleased to discover we were Americans, they wanted
to know how we liked their country. Then, with a great deal of laughter, they showed us how to hold the sugar cubes in our teeth and drink the tea around them. The next day, driving out of Van, we passed the same couple on the street, and we shouted
and
waved at each other like old friends.</TE>
<TE>Next, we headed southwest for Mardin and Diyarbakir, dropping in altitude toward the great Syrian desert. When we stopped for tea at a waterfall, we studied the faces of the people around us. I had a camera, and everyone wanted their picture taken. I
left with a handful of torn pieces of paper scrawled with the addresses of my models. I promised to send copies to all of them, and I did.</TE>
<TE>Mardin, on the edge of the desert 60 miles south of Diyarbakir, has been inhabited for more than 5,000 years. Like the rest of eastern Anatolia, it has a mix of peoples. It also has a mix of religions--Syrian Orthodox, Chaldean Catholic, Armenian
Orthodox, Muslim, Jewish, Zoroastrian and Yezidi (whose religious mission is to persuade Lucifer to return to heaven).</TE>
<TE>We were invited into the Ulu Cami, an 11th century Seljuk mosque, and later met a Syrian Orthodox priest who showed us his church, part of which dates to the 6th century. At the altar, the priest read from the Bible in Aramaic, the language of Jesus.
Mardin, along with two towns across the nearby Syrian border, is one of the few places where Aramaic is still spoken.</TE>
<TE>It was late afternoon when we drove away from Mardin. An hour later we crossed the gleaming width of the Tigris River. From its banks, the black, crenelated battlements of the city of Diyarbakir rose to meet us.</TE>
<TE>Founded in 1500 BC by the kings of Mitanni, it's a place of teeming, narrow streets, labyrinthine alleyways and extensive bazaars. At one time the city--then called Amida--sat astride one of the principal branches of the legendary Silk Road, a network
of trade routes that ran from modern-day Xian in China to Rome. The city, renamed Diyar Bakr after its conquest by the Arabs in AD 639, was of such great strategic importance that it changed hands many times after that.</TE>
<TE>It had been a long road for us, as it was for the caravaners of the past, and I looked forward to exploring the city. For now, though, I was happy to check into the Otel Buyuk Kervansaray, a converted caravansary, or Silk Road hotel, originally built
in
the 16th century as a stopping place for camel trains. The hotel now offers such amenities as a swimming pool, and the camel stables have been turned into an upscale restaurant. A breeze blew through the courtyard as we relaxed with drinks.</TE>
<TE>Tomorrow the caravan would begin again, but for tonight we, and the camels, were at rest.</TE>

<DL>ASTORIA, Ore.</DL>
<LD>One of the first travel writers to see the area said, "Ocian in view! O! the joy."</LD>
<LD>Within a few weeks, however, he was complaining about the rain: "O! how disagreeable is our Situation dureing this dreadfull weather."</LD>
<LD>Of course, in 1805 William Clark (with his partner, Meriwether Lewis) didn't have the advantages available to modern travel writers in Astoria: no excellent seafood restaurants, no comfy B&amp;Bs and, apparently, no spell-checker.</LD>
<TE>But Clark's observations remain valid: There is great joy (and awe and fear) at seeing the Pacific Ocean where it confronts the Columbia River, and the weather is still miserable. But that "dreadfull" rain puts Astoria in the company of Ireland's
Dingle
Peninsula, the north coast of Kauai and the island of St. Lucia in the Lesser Antilles--places where rain is regarded as "liquid sunshine," where the locals respond to the inevitable visitor complaints with, "Of course it rains a lot. How else could it
stay so green and beautiful?"</TE>
<TE>My wife, Janice, and I visited Astoria during a long Memorial Day weekend at the suggestion of our son, Paul, who lives in Portland, Ore., and whose instincts for nifty, thrifty travel destinations we have come to respect.</TE>
<TE>How could we not like a place with history, scenery and smoked salmon cheeks? With him we made the two-hour drive west from Portland on U.S. 26 through the forests of Clatsop and Washington counties to Astoria, population 9,813, in the extreme
northwest
corner of the state.</TE>
<TE>Through unfortunate procrastination on my part (it hadn't occurred to me that Astoria hotels and B&amp;Bs might be booked full on a holiday weekend) we stayed in Seaside, 15 miles south of Astoria on U.S. 101. Thus we commuted 20 minutes each way between
our comfortable but characterless chain hotel and Astoria, through villages and woods, past "Elk Crossing" signs and over the scenic, if confusingly named, "Old Youngs Bay Bridge." Sometimes the weather would change two or three times during this short
trip.</TE>
<TE>Weather like that tends to keep people inside, raising the level of the art of conversation. At least that's my theory on why so many of our favorite moments in Astoria were spent listening to its citizens.</TE>
<TE>At the Columbian Cafe on Marine Drive, for example, as important as eating Uriah Hulsey's deft vegetarian and seafood creations is hearing him humorously catalog the world's shortcomings. The cafe's Nixon bathroom, with its collection of unflattering
photos and banner newspaper headlines, is sort of an anti-shrine to the Watergate scandal and Nixon's resignation. Uriah whips up a dandy breakfast too. We loved the apple crepes and the "Broad Street": blue cheese home fries with eggs.</TE>
<TE>At a restaurant called Someplace Else, owner Lauren Arena likes to come out of the kitchen and talk with her clientele about any one of the many countries she's visited. Although her basic menu emphasizes Italy, her daily specials and travel interests
are worldwide. Thus, under suspended Balinese boat kites, we listened to Italian opera, ate Greek spanakopita followed by a dessert of Thai black rice and bananas, and talked with her about Indonesian Komodo dragons while her vacation videos of
Malaysia
played on a TV at the side of the room.</TE>
<TE>But the winner of the Wet Afternoon Award is the Shallon Winery, where 77-year-old winemaker Paul van der Veldt talks about dirigibles (his passion), discourses on Astoria history and debunks what he considers the affectations of the wine industry. And
he pours samples of his specialty--dessert wines in unexpected flavors. Well, elderberry we might have expected, but I was unprepared for mango, lemon meringue and chocolate orange.</TE>
<TE>Unconventional as they sound, they all are delicious, particularly the chocolate orange, which Van der Veldt creates with six kinds of chocolate from four countries. It's a bonbon in a bottle. When he gets behind in his work, which is often, he pulls
visitors into the back room and continues his lecture while he affixes labels to his bottles, applies their foil tops and gives them a last polishing.</TE>
<TE>The skies were merely overcast when we began our Astoria sightseeing. On Coxcomb Hill, the highest point in town (elevation 600 feet), is the Astoria Column, a 125-foot tower affording visitors a grand, orienting view of the area. The viewpoint is
itself fun to view. The exterior of the column, dedicated in 1926 and paid for by the Great Northern Railroad, is decorated in a technique called "sgraffito," which involves applying, then scraping away, several layers of paint. Italian artist Attilio
Pusterla created a sepia-toned illustrated history of Astoria that begins at the bottom with American mariner Robert Gray's 1792 discovery of the mouth of the Columbia, spirals up through Lewis and Clark's explorations and the story of namesake John
Jacob Astor, and ends at the top with the arrival in Astoria of the railroad.</TE>
<TE>Inside the tower we were the ones doing the spiraling--up 164 steps to the platform at the top. To the east, deep green hills. Southeastward, Saddle Mountain (so named for the saddle-like notch in its ridge). In all the other directions there was
water;
Astoria sits on a peninsula. To the south was Youngs Bay and on the other side of it the site of Ft. Clatsop, where Lewis and Clark's company wintered before their return home.</TE>
<TE>To the west, the Pacific Ocean. And to the north was the broad Columbia River, the border between Oregon and Washington, spanned by a spectacular 4.1-mile-long bridge that rises 260 feet at the Oregon end to let the freighters and tankers and similar
engines of maritime commerce sail underneath.</TE>
<TE>Clark's joy at seeing the Pacific was premature, incidentally. It was really the mouth of the Columbia he saw--an understandable error, given its breadth and turbulence. The mouth of the Columbia is called the "Graveyard of the Pacific." The label
comes
not just from the rough water--where ocean swells collide with the longest river on the West Coast--but also the capricious weather, the shifting sandbars and the poor visibility in the drizzle and mist.</TE>
<TE>More than 200 ships weighing at least 50 gross tons have been wrecked in these waters, where on any given day a captain could encounter his personal "perfect storm." The conditions are so tricky that transiting vessels need two kinds of specialized
navigators: river pilots, who, to get their licenses, must know the Columbia so well that they can draw it in detail from memory; and bar pilots, who specialize in getting ships in and out of the dangerous doorway.</TE>
<TE>As the clouds broke slightly we drove down the hill and walked along Astoria's riverfront on the quiet Saturday morning.</TE>
<TE>A sightseers' trolley car trundled by on its 2 1/2-mile riverside route. When I looked closely, I saw that it differs from trolleys of old: Rather than taking its power from overhead lines, it tows its own trailer-mounted generator. (The trolley is an
accommodation to travelers who arrive by tour boat at the 17th Street pier and need a quick ride to the restaurants downtown.) Tiny pilot boats motored back and forth between the pier and a succession of behemoth cargo vessels making perilous exit into
the ocean.</TE>
<TE>In the early 1900s the riverfront was home to 55 fish canneries, where crews of immigrant laborers gutted, chopped and steamed the area's abundant salmon, tuna and sturgeon, squeezed them into little tins and shipped them to the world. In seasons when
the haul was great, the smell could knock you out of your spats.</TE>
<TE>Eventually the salmon harvests diminished, and the riverfront got quieter (but better smelling). Logging, then tourism supplanted fishing in the local economy. The wood pilings of the riverfront remain, but instead of canneries they now hold
coffeehouses and waterside restaurants.</TE>
<TE>The Columbia River Maritime Museum, on the east end of town, is a show-and-tell center with fascinating stories to share. Perhaps it's because I was raised in Minnesota that I could not get enough of the fishing boats, the nautical gear and the
full-scale exhibit of a Coast Guard motor lifeboat somehow defying gravity to rescue a man overboard in impossible seas.</TE>
<TE>I waited impatiently for my turn to operate the controls in a mock towboat wheelhouse. I took the helm of the Knapp, a World War II destroyer whose bridge now commands a wing of the museum.</TE>
<TE>Parked in the river behind the museum is the Lightship Columbia, taken out of service in 1979. For 28 years its 1,200-watt light marked the entrance to the river at a point where no lighthouse could be built. We went aboard, and I could imagine the
boredom and claustrophobia--and nausea--of its 18-man crew, confined for weeks at a time in this 128-foot-long steel box, being spun by the waves.</TE>
<TE>The Clatsop County Heritage Museum, a couple of blocks away in the former Astoria city hall, gave us more stories. Again we heard about Robert Gray, who not only was the first white man to sail into the Columbia (which he named after his ship), but
also
the first American to circumnavigate the world, trading furs as he went.</TE>
<TE>Fur was the area's first commodity. John Jacob Astor, at his death in 1848 the nation's wealthiest person, made his first big money selling animal skins. Prompted by Lewis and Clark's stories of animal abundance in the Pacific Northwest, he sent
explorers there. They built Ft. Astoria in 1811, making Astoria the "first permanent American settlement west of the Rockies." (The drafting of that sentence requires precision, because Astoria's founding certainly postdated Spanish settlements in
California, not to mention the centuries of residence west of the Mississippi by Native Americans. But it is the oldest town on the American West Coast to be settled by citizens of the then-infant United States.)</TE>
<TE>British capture of the new town during the War of 1812 quickly put Ft. Astoria's fledgling fur industry into Britain's hands, but Oregon subsequently became an American territory in 1848, and then a state in 1859.</TE>
<TE>The museum also tells a dark story of Finnish settlers in the early 1930s who, having heard that the Soviets were building a utopia in the Karelia region of eastern Finland, naively left Oregon to become part of the new experiment near their homeland.
At the end of the long trip, many of them found grim Russian labor camps, and far from being rewarded for their sacrifices, they were shunned as outsiders. Most were never heard from again.</TE>
<TE>On the second floor of the museum is the re-created interior of a typical frontier saloon, something between the Long Branch of "Gunsmoke" and the lounge on "Cheers." The long wood bar dates to 1895.</TE>
<TE>The Flavel House Museum gave us a view of upper-crust 19th century Astoria. George Flavel was the first man to be licensed as a river pilot in the Oregon Territory. He parlayed his earnings into real estate investments, becoming Astoria's first
millionaire. He spent years planning this Queen Anne-style Victorian house as his retirement home, creating verandas, parlors and a cupola and specifying exotic woods and tiles from around the world.</TE>
<TE>He died in 1893, having lived in his gingerbread dream house for only eight years, and never knowing that strangers like us would be clicking along his wood floors, admiring his nooks-and-crannies design and thinking how our own home really could use a
cupola.</TE>
<TE>The sun was shining when we finished our tour of the Flavel House. The sun does shine in Astoria, William Clark's lamentations notwithstanding. When it does, the Earth looks reborn. The greenery glistens, accented by school-bus-yellow splashes of
Scotch
broom, a pretty but pernicious plant that was ill-advisedly imported from Europe by early settlers.</TE>
<TE>But modern weather statistics still support Clark: Astoria's rainfall averages 67 inches per year. By comparison, Seattle, known for its cats-and-dogs climate, gets only 37 inches. In a typical year, Astoria will enjoy only 50 days of clear skies but
will receive measurable precipitation on 192 days.</TE>
<TE>We visited Lewis and Clark's Ft. Clatsop (named after the friendly but hard-bargaining local Indian tribe), where the captains and their discovery corps wintered in the woods about five miles south of present-day Astoria. It's not the original
fort--wood, even buckskin, rots quickly in this climate--but in 1955 the National Park Service re-created it from Clark's plans.</TE>
<TE>The accommodations were not luxurious, particularly for the 23 enlisted men who had to fit into three small, dark bunk rooms. Capts. Lewis and Clark shared a room, formally arranged so that even here in the wilderness, enlisted men could enter the
officers' quarters only if they first got permission from the posted orderly. Shoshone guide Sacagawea and her French-Canadian husband, Toussaint Charbonneau, and infant child, Jean Baptiste, had their own space.</TE>
<TE>During our visit volunteer rangers in early 19th century frontier costume reenacted a typical task for the soldiers: making candles. They chopped and melted tallow (the original crew likely would have used elk fat) and poured it into candle molds. Both
captains and some enlisted men were required to keep journals of their trip; thus, with little natural light available even during the daytime, candles were essential.</TE>
<TE>The early explorers ate a lot of elk--indeed, the availability of game was one of the reasons they chose this location--but they didn't like it. It wasn't greasy enough. They preferred beaver tail and particularly liked whale blubber, which they tasted
when their Indian colleagues told them of a whale carcass that had washed ashore.</TE>
<TE>They ate beaver tail and road-kill whale, but apparently not salmon. Maybe they were afraid of it; they had suffered dysentery from eating salmon earlier in the trip. What a pity, for along with Dungeness crab and razor clams (so big that I mistook a
fried clam for a fish fillet), the local salmon is reason enough to move to Oregon. We particularly relished the way Josephson's Smokehouse prepares it: tangy, a bit salty, but moist. We created our own breakfast there one morning, choosing among the
"salmon cheeks" (a delicacy) and "cod collars." (Do cod even have necks?) We bought morsels of smoked salmon, halibut and albacore tuna, which we put together with bagels and cream cheese.</TE>
<TE>Another, more conventional place to enjoy salmon is the Silver Salmon Grille, where you can have it baked, broiled, blackened or poached, stuffed, smoked or sprinkled with sesame. Salmon appears not only on the menu, but also in the artwork on its
walls
and in the crafted metal motifs on its stainless-steel light fixtures.</TE>
<TE>Clark was two centuries too early. All he needed was the right remoulade sauce. With a glass of chocolate orange wine for dessert, I am sure he would have said, "O! the joy"--and meant it.</TE>

<TE>When David Leavitt first visited Florence in 1982, he was a college student from Palo Alto, and the city's layers of art and history so overwhelmed him in four days that he cut short the rest of his European itinerary and went home, feeling "irritable,
impatient, inadequate."</TE>
<TE>Leavitt went on to make a name for himself as a novelist and writer of short stories and then, in 1993, returned to Florence for a sort of experimental residence with his partner, Mark Mitchell.</TE>
<TE>This book's 176 pages are distilled from the author's daily wanderings and from Leavitt's reading of earlier writings by foreigners on Florence; indeed, he gives us too little of the wanderings and too much of the reading. It's nothing new for a
slumming novelist to offer up a slender travel book, but this one seems to contain more research than most and less joy.</TE>
<TE>The book starts provocatively, with a discussion of suicides by foreigners in the city. Then it evolves into a meditation on the many English-speaking writers and intellectuals who, since the mid-19th century, have come to Florence, spent much energy
on
squabbles and intrigues within the English-speaking colony and only occasionally produced enduring work. E.M. Forster is here, and Mary McCarthy, Norman Douglas, Bernard Berenson and Harold Acton, among many others.</TE>
<TE>The literary focus is logical enough. Leavitt's volume is part of a series from Bloomsbury, "The Writer and the City," that also features works by Edmund White (on Paris) and Peter Carey (on Sydney, Australia). And amid the local literary history
(including a thorough look at the city's gay scene over generations past), Leavitt does wield his words memorably.</TE>
<TE>Consider these lines sketching a sculpture of Neptune near the Palazzo Vecchio: "Looking at him, you finally understand why sculptors fought over blocks of white Carrara marble. You want to take off your shoes, wade through the fountains, scrape at the
green algae on his flanks with your nails."</TE>
<TE>But in my reading, it wasn't until Chapter 4, 115 pages in, that the book hit its most agreeable stride. That's when Leavitt tells us tales of older and newer Florence. For instance, he reveals that the chunk of marble that Michelangelo cut into his
famous David was first quarried for use on the city's Opera del Duomo, then chiseled inexpertly by a lesser sculptor, and only then handed to Michelangelo. He outlines the strange steps taken to hide and protect the great museums' artworks when it
became clear that Italy would be caught up in the ground fighting of World War II. And he revisits the heroic efforts of students (and hippies) who waded in to rescue works from the city's ill-protected libraries in the flood of 1966. Never mind the
squabbling English-speakers. Behind the exhilaration and evocative nature of these tales lies the reason so many visitors and expats still find their way to Florence.</TE>

<TE>OUR PARIS: SKETCHES</TE>
<TE>FROM MEMORY</TE>
<TE>By Edmund White</TE>
<TE>Ecco, $19.95</TE>
<TE>Here, in this small and fine book, is the yin to Leavitt's yang.</TE>
<TE>White (a literary hero of Leavitt's, as it happens) moved to Paris with his partner, Hubert Sorin, just a year after Leavitt arrived in Florence. But all similarity ends there. White's writerly touch is feathery light; his research, if any, is
invisible; and his wry anecdotes of street characters, cocktail parties and odd moments in the market (who knew the grocer was a Cambodian poet?) conjure a living, breathing, amusing Paris.</TE>
<TE>White's basset hound, Fred, also features prominently. At one spot near the Pompidou Centre, White writes of Fred, "I encourage him to defecate on the grill above the underground center for experimental music, directed by Pierre Boulez, who once
refused
to give me an interview."</TE>
<TE>The wit is underlined by Sorin's elegant drawings. Yet none of this is really whimsy. White and Sorin came to Paris to take what enjoyment they could as Sorin's AIDS advanced. There's virtually no clue of this in the main text and drawings; it's only
White's introduction and afterword that frame the anecdotes with grim context. The partners finished their jaunty manuscript and playful drawings just weeks before Sorin's death in 1994 at age 32. (The book was first published that year under the title
"Sketches From Memory.")</TE>

<TE>KNOPF GUIDES: CALIFORNIA</TE>
<TE>Knopf, $25</TE>
<TE>It's hard to imagine a more profusely illustrated guidebook, and there's great utility in that. I would still sooner trust a couple of photographs than a couple of paragraphs when choosing an unfamiliar neighborhood in San Francisco to explore. But the
larger, half-hidden theme to this guide is globalism: Consult the fine print a few pages in, and you find that Knopf is basically recycling this book. This first American edition (edited in London and printed in Italy) is actually the translated
version
of a French guidebook published last year in Paris. Hence the odd ring of sentences such as this one on traffic: "Los Angeles will divert you, literally as well as metaphorically!"</TE>
<TE>It's also slim on hotel and restaurant recommendations (just five hotels listed in San Diego County, a couple of them in inland locations that are inconvenient for most visitors). On the upside, the authors take nothing for granted and give more
cultural context (from race relations to economic underpinnings) and historical detail than do most guidebooks.</TE>

<TE>STEPS TO WATER: THE ANCIENT STEPWELLS OF INDIA</TE>
<TE>By Morna Livingston</TE>
<TE>Princeton Architectural Press, $50</TE>
<TE>Think of Egypt's great pyramids, inverted and elegantly lodged in the earth to serve a subcontinent's thirst for water. That's the role of India's stepwells and stepped ponds, which, from the 5th through 19th centuries, served to catch water from the
monsoons and save it for drinking, washing and bathing. These stone buildings, some as deep as nine stories with elaborate carved walls, columns and towers, are largely unappreciated outside the country and neglected and underprotected inside the
country, circumstances this book hopes to change.</TE>
<TE>These photographs (color and black-and-white, all by the author) and architectural drawings can be staggering; think of an M.C. Escher pattern tugged into three dimensions and reflected in a pool. Author Morna Livingston, an image maker and a scholar,
has studied India's stepwells for 15 years and spent four extended trips visiting and photographing them.</TE>

<LD>In a corner of the lounge, a middle-aged pianist played Schubert while a teenage music lover turned the pages of her sheet music. At a chessboard nearby, two college students stared at their rooks and knights while a white-haired senior offered
occasional advice. And at an overstuffed couch under a notice-filled bulletin board, several eager young people sought travel advice from a couple in their 40s.</LD>
<LD>This jumbling of the generations--young with old, newly retired with newlywed--often occurs in youth hostels. They are no longer limited to youths and haven't been for some time, but many people don't know this and thus pass up lodging opportunities.
What are these structures that now accept "young people of all ages," to use a newly coined slogan?</LD>
<LD>They range from ancient castles to modern farmhouses, from Buddhist temples to converted water mills, from rambling Victorian mansions to four-masted sailing ships to glass-walled high-rises in the center of great cities--about 5,000 hostels in all (in
74 countries), of which 160 are in the United States.</LD>
<TE>Although the beds are often double-decker cots in dormitories (usually segregated by sex), their facilities are otherwise comfortable and clean, closely supervised by "hostel parents," social, cheery, priced for peanuts--and now multigener- ational in
clientele.</TE>
<TE>They're an exciting resource for America's mature travelers. Using a $12-per-person hostel instead of a $60-per-person hotel enables older citizens--even those on Social Security--to enjoy the same stays abroad that younger Americans experience.</TE>
<TE>What brought about this revolution in the hostels? Some hostelers point to the laws against age discrimination in numerous countries. Some mention the growing realization by youth hostel organizations of the need for income and patronage in non-summer
months, when young people are in school. Others suggest that the lowering of age bars came about when hostel-loving baby boomers approached their middle years and insisted on the right to continue using hostel accommodations.</TE>
<TE>"The reason we use hostels is because hosteling is an attitude, not simply a source of cheap accommodations for penniless young people," says Jane Holden, formerly a college lecturer. "That attitude never changes. To me, the finest moments of life are
in meeting people from different countries and backgrounds, and extending friendship to them, even if it means trading off a bit of comfort and privacy."</TE>
<TE>Mature hostelers, like Edwin and Jean Erlanger, say it's not difficult to mix with people who are much younger. Once people work together in the kitchen or begin discussing the day's news, the barriers fade, say the Erlangers, hostelers since the
mid-1950s.</TE>
<TE>The U.S. headquarters for Hostelling International is 733 15th St., N.W., Suite 840, Washington, DC 20005; (202) 783-6161, www.hiayh.org, but there are local branches in 35 cities throughout the country. Visit the Web site to look up locations; scan
the
phone book for "Hostelling International" or "American Youth Hostels"; or look in the Yellow Pages under "hostels." More than 200 youth hostels can be found in the United States and Canada, several thousand in Europe, several hundred scattered across
the rest of the globe.</TE>
<TE>Membership is free if you are 17 or younger, $25 annually if you are 18 to 55, $15 annually if you are 55 or older. You'll receive a membership card and a book listing youth hostel facilities in the United States and Canada.</TE>

<DL>SHORE ACRES STATE PARK, Ore.</DL>
<LD>Less than a century ago, a mansion rose above these chiseled cliffs like some San Simeon of the Oregon coast: 10 bedrooms and baths, not counting servants' quarters. Living room with arguably the best view in the state. And a 52-foot Roman bath that
could be filled with fresh water or seawater, heated or not, depending on the owner's whim.</LD>
<LD>The estate was named Shore Acres, a sunny moniker for a place with a cloudy past. This Shangri-La by the sea was lost not once but twice--first to fire, then to a bulldozer. Earlier this summer, as I stood on its cliffs, the only remnant of riches I
could see was an old tennis court built within serving distance of the shore.</LD>
<LD>Even so, Shore Acres impressed me more than the gaudy grandeur of San Simeon, William Randolph Hearst's castle on California's Central Coast. After all, this is how a beautiful seashore was meant to be, untamed and untainted: jagged, 95-foot sandstone
cliffs, a blanket of forest green draping toward wind-whipped waves, a mist drifting by over the landscape like a cool kiss.</LD>
<TE>This vision was a bit of serendipity. I had set out on a four-day weekend intending to try the popular yurts at Sunset Bay State Park, which neighbors Shore Acres, about 100 miles north of the California border. More than a tent and less than a cabin,
each yurt is furnished with bunk beds, halogen lamp, electric heater--for the most part, all the basics of a lazy man's camping trip, minus the sleeping bag.</TE>
<TE>Not having to pack a closet's worth of gear was a plus. So was the fact that the varied terrain--hilly woodlands, sandy beaches, rocky tide pools and wind-swept bluffs--would provide enough outdoor adventure to fill each day in one of the few parts of
the West Coast I had never seen. I flew into Eugene with my partner, Todd, and we drove Highway 126 as far west as it goes, then followed U.S. 101 south along Oregon Dunes National Recreation Area. Soon a sign announced our arrival: "Welcome to
Oregon's
Bay Area."</TE>
<TE>The Coos Bay Area--the towns of Coos Bay, North Bend and Charleston--is the most populous region of Oregon's coast, even though the head count barely tops 30,000. Renovated waterfront promenades and main streets peppered with trinket shops and cafes
are
clues that, with the logging and fishing industries fading, locals hope tourism might boost their economy.</TE>
<TE>And tourism seems like an easy sell considering that just 10 minutes south of Coos Bay lie three stunning state parks: Sunset Bay, where the yurts sit within earshot of the ocean; Shore Acres, whose once-resplendent gardens have been restored; and Cape
Arago, with teeming tide pools and a welcoming party of barking sea lions.</TE>
<TE>We arrived at Sunset Bay in the evening, and I was glad we didn't have a tangle of tent poles to mess with in the dark. Todd, a die-hard camper, stepped inside our yurt, dropped his bag and plopped down on the futon couch with a look that said, "This
is
too easy." Firewood purchased at the park entrance is delivered to the door, and when the ranger drove up with a bundle of logs in hand, I almost felt guilty.</TE>
<TE>Though hardly luxurious, the yurt was nicer than I expected: insulated white canvas walls held up by a wood-lattice frame; sturdy pine furniture; a skylight and roll-down window flaps; electric outlets; and a front door with a deadbolt (not that we
needed it).</TE>
<TE>The foam mattresses for the futon and bunk beds (twin on top, double on bottom) were thick and covered with new, immaculately clean, industrial-strength woodsy green vinyl that magically didn't bunch up or crinkle.</TE>
<TE>The floor had been vacuumed. The little deck outside had been swept. Our private picnic area, complete with table and fire ring, was freshly raked. All in all, the yurt was tidier than our apartment, and only $27 per night.</TE>
<TE>The winding, two-lane Cape Arago Highway links Sunset Bay with the neighboring parks, but I preferred a hiking trail that runs roughly parallel. The path zigzags under a canopy of spruce and fir, occasionally swinging out to land's end and some sunny
perch over the Pacific.</TE>
<TE>Each succeeding glimpse of the ocean proved more photogenic, and soon we measured time not by the minute but by the number of pictures we stopped to snap.</TE>
<TE>About two dozen frames from the campground, we arrived at the Shore Acres State Park visitor center. Volunteer docents pointed us toward an observation hut on a windy, wide-open plateau. Inside, historical displays recounted how Asa Meade Simpson, a
Maine ship's captain, joined the 1849 California Gold Rush. He soon realized that the real fortune was to be made selling lumber, food and other supplies to mining camps. His lumberyard and shipping holdings eventually stretched from Hoquiam, Wash., to
Stockton.</TE>
<TE>Simpson's oldest son, Louis, went on to manage the family business, including its first sawmill and shipyard, in Coos Bay. Enchanted by the rugged beauty of this land, Louis went on to buy more than 1,200 acres to the south at headlands he dubbed Shore
Acres.</TE>
<TE>Though there's no record of the exact dimensions of the first mansion here, old photos and floor-plan sketches suggest it was one of the largest in the state at the time. Construction began in 1906 and a massive addition, including the Roman bath, was
finished eight years later.</TE>
<TE>A fire of unknown origin destroyed everything in 1921. With an insurance policy covering less than half the loss, the family was forced to move into a modest cottage in the garden. Using timber salvaged from a wrecked lumber schooner, the mansion was
rebuilt about six years later.</TE>
<TE>The family struggled financially in the second Shore Acres estate, and eventually losses from the fire, the Depression and failed land speculation left the family too cash-strapped to maintain the home. Shore Acres crumbled.</TE>
<TE>Louis, wife Lela and daughters Geraldine and Barbara eventually packed up and in 1942 sold the land to the state, which established the Shore Acres and Sunset Bay parks next to Cape Arago State Park, 132 acres that Simpson had donated to the state in
1932.</TE>
<TE>Inside the Shore Acres observation building, constructed on the former mansion site, it was hard to grasp the scale of these headlands. Not until we skirted the cliffs' edge for a closer look did the rock formations look monumental, their sedimentary
layers, thrust from the earth at a 45-degree angle, ravaged by time and tide.</TE>
<TE>Around us, children posed for parents' cameras, their voices lost in the roar of waves. The landscape reminded me of Torrey Pines in La Jolla and Montana del Oro near Morro Bay, stretches of coast so instantly endearing I wondered why they haven't been
designated national seashores like California's Point Reyes or Massachusetts' Cape Cod.</TE>
<TE>The wild cliffs were a stark contrast to Shore Acres' sprawling formal gardens tucked inland. Freshly trimmed lawns, so green they seemed unnatural, were bordered by fastidiously groomed boxwood.</TE>
<TE>Our visit came too late in the season to see the 4,000 tulips that bloom in spring, and too early for the 600 rosebushes that flower in the summer (in bloom now until September). But Louis Simpson's prized rhododendrons and azaleas, in reds, pinks and
whites, were in full June bloom. Sitting by a 100-foot-long lily pond, I found it easy to imagine having the serene Japanese garden all to myself--because I did, at least for a few moments before others arrived to share it.</TE>
<TE>Simpson instructed captains of his timber schooners and clipper ships to bring back trees and shrubs from around the world, and he in turn opened this horticultural showcase to the public. He encouraged his gardeners to give away seedlings and cuttings
to visitors, thus spreading his bounty across the state.</TE>
<TE>These days, the park is maintained by a half-dozen groundskeepers who tend to beds of gazanias, penstemons, dusty millers, salvias and snapdragons. The volunteer force totals a whopping 1,200, most of whom put in a few hours at the Friends of Shore
Acres' small gift shop or lend a hand each December installing 250,000 twinkling lights for the holiday display.</TE>
<TE>Farther down the road at Cape Arago, winding paths lead from grassy bluffs down to a spectrum of tide-pool life: white gooseneck barnacles, black turban snails, purple shore crabs and red sea cucumbers. On a rock formation named Simpson's Reef,
hundreds
of sunning sea lions sang in a chorus louder than any I've ever heard.</TE>
<TE>One day we drove about 15 miles southeast of our campground to South Slough, the first member of what is now called the National Estuarine Research Reserve System. At South Slough, the Tijuana River near San Diego, the Chesapeake Bay in Maryland and
Virginia, and about two dozen other protected wetlands, water quality and wildlife are monitored for signs of urban and agricultural pollution.</TE>
<TE>Here, around the southern tip of Coos Bay, 60 million tons of ocean water flow in and out daily, sustaining surf perch, staghorn sculpin, Dungeness crab, beavers and other critters.</TE>
<TE>We ducked into the newly expanded visitor center just as sheets of rain began to fall. Interpretive displays explain researchers' work, but I was drawn to the back of the center, where a bank of windows overlooks a valley. The surrounding evergreen
hills roll like waves, and even on the sole dreary day of our trip, the terrain looked vibrant and full of life.</TE>
<TE>"Touristy, but not a tourist trap" is how Todd described Bandon, about 20 miles south of the slough. On the way into town we stopped for lunch at the Bandon Dunes Golf Resort, whose two courses Golf magazine ranks among the nation's top 50. Bandon's
boosters call their town the Cranberry Capital of Oregon, so it was no surprise that our organic salads at the resort's restaurant were sprinkled with dried cranberries, and the grilled chicken breasts were slathered with cranberry barbecue sauce. Both
were good, but not nearly as pleasing as the gleeful toddler who eased the stuffy setting by flinging pieces of grilled-cheese sandwich with power and precision around our tables: no slice, no hook--Tiger Woods would have been proud.</TE>
<TE>Bandon is quite a family place, as it turns out. While adults linger in art galleries and crafts emporiums, kids ogle candy counters piled with homemade fudge and taffy.</TE>
<TE>The Cranberry Sweets shop is a maze of cranberry truffles, blackberry chews and something called lemon meringue pie candy, yellow jellied candy in a white, creamy shell. If one piece represented one slice, I must have eaten two pies.</TE>
<TE>That didn't stop me from joining the sampling line at the Bandon Cheese Factory a few blocks away to graze on Colby, Monterey Jack and numerous Cheddars: full cream, cranberry walnut, jalapeno, smoked salmon among them--all made in an adjacent room
visible through picture windows.</TE>
<TE>Still more excess lay across town at Faber Farms, owned by Ann and Al Faber. Ann's 15-minute Cranberry 101 class included a walk around rectangular fields filled with spindly 5-inch plants, their pink flowers abuzz with bees. Come October the bogs will
be flooded and a contraption that looks like a dune buggy will shake ripe cranberries loose so they float to the surface. Giant booms will steer the fruit to a conveyor belt and on their way to a juice bottle near you.</TE>
<TE>Cranberries thrive here because of the acidic soil, and an estimated 35 million pounds are harvested in the Bandon area each year. Faber's harvest becomes Northland brand bottled juices, but about half the farms in town are part of an Ocean Spray
cooperative.</TE>
<TE>In Ann's gourmet gift shop, we picked up brandied cranberry compote, chocolate-covered cranberries and cranberry-and-green-chile salsa (surprisingly good).</TE>
<TE>Nothing, however, could compare with the sights that awaited at the beach at Bandon.</TE>
<TE>Along Beach Loop Road, tourists stream across bluffs overlooking massive rock formations that appear offshore like monoliths dropped from the heavens. Indian legend says an evil ocean spirit turned a princess and her pets into stone, their forms and
features supposedly evident in the rock facade. But in the glare of the 5 o'clock sun, I couldn't make out Face Rock, the Cat and the Kittens, or the princess' dog, Komax.</TE>
<TE>The biting wind shook the knee-high golden grasses and blue irises scattered across the bluffs.</TE>
<TE>We shivered a bit before assuming (incorrectly) that the beach below couldn't possibly be colder. Down to the shore we went.</TE>
<TE>Even with the day winding down and the gusts growing stronger, I was surprised to see so few footprints in the sand. Along the stunning mile-long strand spires of volcanic rock rise unexpectedly here and there, as if they were peaks of a great mountain
range buried deep beneath our feet.</TE>
<TE>Eventually the bluster sent us indoors, this time to the Wild Rose Bistro in Bandon for dinner. Our salads came with a huckleberry vinaigrette and edible flower blossoms. More Oregon berries arrived in the form of a honey-cranberry glaze on a pan-fried
chicken breast, and the fettuccine accompanying the chicken Parmesan was so redolent of garlic that the scent arrived at the table before the plate.</TE>
<TE>We arrived back at Sunset Bay at dusk. Children played tag with the waves, peeling off shirts and hoisting shorts above their knees despite the chill. Sunset came, but without an explosion of color--just an understated orange, a blush of pink, and then
it was over--a fittingly soft, simple ending to a blissfully uncomplicated day.</TE>
<TE>Back at our yurt's picnic table, I unpacked some aged smoked Cheddar and crackers from Bandon. Todd got the campfire crackling. We toasted marshmallows, listened to the low, steady strum of waves on the bay, and watched embers shoot up like stars into
a
bluish-black sky.</TE>

<HD>Deal of the Week: Savings at the Savoy</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The luxury Savoy Group is cutting room rates by nearly half at its four London hotels for stays through Sept. 8. The hotels are the Savoy, the Berkeley, Claridge's and the Connaught. Rooms start at about $280 per night, double, compared with published
rates starting at $542 this time of year. (Rooms are priced in British pounds; the rate in dollars varies with the exchange rate.) Through Dec. 31, connecting rooms at Claridge's and the Savoy, designed especially for families, start at about $470.
Both
deals are subject to availability. Business travel, especially, drops off in August, a spokeswoman said. (800) 637-2869.</LD>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The beloved "Peanuts" comic strip, drawn for decades by Charles M. Schulz, who died in February 2000, is getting a larger-than-life home in Santa Rosa, Calif.</LD>
<LD>The 27,384-square-foot Charles M. Schulz Museum and Research Center, opening Saturday, contains a re-creation of Schulz's studio, more than 100 original comic strips and several large-scale works. Among these are a 26-foot-long bas relief that displays
Snoopy's development as a cartoon character; a 51-by-57-foot garden labyrinth in the shape of Snoopy's head; a tile mural made of 3,588 Peanuts images; and a wall of Schulz's early drawings.</LD>
<LD>Entry to the museum for opening festivities Aug. 17 to 19 is by timed ticket only; after that, reservations are not necessary. Admission will be $8 for adults, $5 for ages 4 to 18, free to age 3 and younger. The museum is open daily except Tuesdays;
hours vary. (866) 766-6792 (for admission tickets through Sept. 2), (707) 636-0908, www.schulzmuseum.org.</LD>

<HD>Grand Canyon Reports Intestinal Illness Outbreak</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Grand Canyon National Park is urging visitors to the river and back country to be especially careful with sanitation after an outbreak of gastrointestinal illness.</LD>
<LD>As of Aug. 1, 68 river rafters had become ill with flu-like symptoms that included nausea, vomiting and diarrhea that appeared to be caused by a so-called Norwalk-like virus, park spokeswoman Maureen Oltrogge said. Such a virus can be spread from
person
to person by poor hygiene (such as failure to wash hands) or by drinking impure water, she said.</LD>
<LD>The park is working with health officials to determine the source of the outbreak, Oltrogge said last week.</LD>

<HD>Not All Tourists Wary of Traveling Sept. 11</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Although it looks as if many Americans will avoid traveling on the one-year anniversary of the Sept. 11 attacks, some upscale and adventure tourists don't appear to be deterred.</LD>
<LD>A poll of 801 leisure and business travelers taken the week of July 22 and released last week by Yesawich, Pepperdine &amp; Brown found a "high level of anxiety," with nearly one in five saying they would not travel on or near Sept. 11 because of concern
about possible terrorist activity, said Peter C. Yesawich, president of the Orlando, Fla.-based marketing firm. But, he noted, "Four out of five travelers say they will not alter their plans."</LD>
<LD>A South Africa tour, departing Sept. 11 from New York's JFK airport, had 12 participants as of Aug. 2, compared with 14 who departed Sept. 6 last year on the same trip, said Anne Bellamy, vice president of Glendale-based African Travel.</LD>
<TE>Luxury tour operator Abercrombie &amp; Kent International, based in Oak Brook, Ill., has "very strong bookings" for Asia and Europe in September, spokeswoman Pamela Lassers said. "We aren't seeing that date [Sept. 11] has any special significance," she
added.</TE>
<TE>As of July 31, total sign-ups at Backroads, a Berkeley-based company that runs hiking, biking and other active tours in the U.S. and abroad, were up 3% from last year for trips departing Sept. 6 to 16, said spokeswoman Julie Snyder. A hiking trip in
Italy's Dolomites, departing Sept. 11, had 15 sign-ups, compared with 16 who took a similar trip Sept. 3 last year, she said.</TE>
<TE>Some cruise lines, including Carnival and Holland America, also report fairly normal bookings around Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>The picture is different for some major bus tours and packages. September looks like a "fairly light travel month" for Pleasant Holidays' trips to Hawaii and Mexico, but October and November "have shown an unusual strength" in bookings, said Ken
Phillips, spokesman for the budget vacation packager. Littleton, Colo.-based Globus &amp; Cosmos said bookings for European tours that include Sept. 11 are down about 25% from last year.</TE>
<TE>The effect on leisure travel would be stronger if Sept. 11 fell on a weekend, when most such trips begin, rather than on a Wednesday as it does this year, firms said.</TE>
<TE>Reflecting lower demand, many airlines are reducing flights on or near the anniversary. Travelers on those dates should call the airline to make sure their flight hasn't been canceled, experts advise.</TE>

<HD>Passport Fees Scheduled to Rise Significantly</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Forgot to renew your passport or need to apply for the first time? Consider doing it soon because on Aug. 19 passport fees will increase as much as 75%, depending on the type of document.</LD>
<LD>The fee for first-time passport applicants will increase from $60 to $85 per adult. Adult renewals will go from $40 to $55. Children younger than 16 will pay $70, an increase from $40. Fees for expedited service, for those who need their passports in
less than 14 days, will rise from $35 to $60. The cutoff for the new fees is the date of application, based on the date you submit your application in person or the postmark of a mailed application, officials said.</LD>
<LD>Barbara Brophy, spokeswoman for the Los Angeles Passport Agency, noted that the bureau has been phasing in costly, high-tech changes in the last two years, such as digitizing photos, to make passports more secure. She added that passport fees pay not
just for passports but also for other services provided to Americans overseas.</LD>
<TE>For passport information, visit www.travel.state.gov, which has application forms you can download and lists post offices and other sites where you can apply; call the National Passport Information Center at (900) 225-5674 (35 cents per minute for
recorded information) or (888) 362-8668 ($4.95 charge; you must punch in your credit card number); or in the Los Angeles area, call (310) 575-5700.</TE>

<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>It's time to nuke Dodger Stadium.</LD>
<LD>That thought struck me like a Louisville Slugger on a festive, sunbaked afternoon last month at Pacific Bell Park. One of the latest in a line of sparkling new diamonds around the country, Pac Bell Park is a treasure on the shores of San Francisco Bay.</LD>
<LD>Since April 2000, when Pac Bell became the first new major-league ballpark in California in nearly four decades, I had been eager to check out the place. The hang-up was tickets; nearly every game in the 41,467-seat venue continued to sell out.</LD>
<TE>But I found a convenient, albeit pricey, online ticket service. All it took was a few clicks of the mouse to snag two field-level seats for a Saturday game against the Colorado Rockies. Although my wife, Willow, does not share my passion for America's
pastime (I'm a long-suffering Detroit Tigers fan), she was more than willing to join me.</TE>
<TE>We flew to Oakland on a Friday evening, hopped a 10-minute shuttle to BART and rode the train to within a couple of blocks of our hotel. (Air fare was high at the time, but prices have since dropped as low as $75 round trip.)</TE>
<TE>The city is still reeling from the dot-com collapse, and many hotels are struggling to fill rooms. We paid only $119 plus tax per night at the classy Argent Hotel, just south of Market Street and within walking distance of Pac Bell Park.</TE>
<TE>The Argent's 667 rooms have city views through floor-to-ceiling windows. Our 23rd-floor room looked toward the Bay. It was fitting that we could see the lights of the ballpark illuminate the evening sky.</TE>
<TE>We had dinner at Perry's on Union Street, a sports bar and grill with a lively mix of locals and out-of-towners. A light meal consisted of two glasses of Cabernet, a zesty calamari appetizer, bowls of tasty, piping-hot Manhattan clam chowder, and fruit
sorbet for dessert.</TE>
<TE>Early Saturday we caught a cab to the Golden Gate Bridge visitor center. The coffee shop had not opened, the gift shop was empty and hordes of tourists had yet to arrive. It was calm, cool and eerily overcast.</TE>
<TE>The Golden Gate, which attracts an estimated 9 million visitors annually, is an engineering marvel better appreciated on foot than by car. We spent an hour and 15 minutes walking leisurely to the Marin County side and back, stopping for sweeping views
of Alcatraz Island and Fisherman's Wharf. We never did see the top half of the bridge, hidden in the thick marine layer.</TE>
<TE>I felt like a kid outside Disneyland when we arrived for the ballgame 90 minutes early to tour Pac Bell inside and out. Thousands of people poured in by light rail, train, bus and ferry. There was even a storage room where fans could check their
bicycles. (Anyone trying these alternate modes of transportation to Dodger Stadium risks missing the first seven innings.)</TE>
<TE>Beyond the right-field wall, I struck up a conversation with a weathered fellow who carried a baseball glove and a fishing rod with a net at the end of the line. Joe Dirt, 40, a guitarist in the band Society Dog (he swore he wasn't making this up),
stood near McCovey Cove, a part of the Bay named after Giants Hall of Famer Willie McCovey. Dirt was ready to pounce on baseballs swatted out of the stadium during batting practice.</TE>
<TE>On a good day, he will net two. As we chatted, Dirt's eyes darted skyward as a ball soared over the bleachers and bounced off a nearby railing.</TE>
<TE>A few steps away are three large screens for passersby to watch the game without tickets. The free section, which proved popular throughout the afternoon, abuts the warning track in right field. Beyond the center-field wall is picturesque picnicking
territory: a grassy knoll overlooking a marina.</TE>
<TE>The pregame setting was far more enjoyable than the one at Dodger Stadium, where tailgating is prohibited and the only signs of life are cars stacked up at parking tollbooths and lines at the Taco Bell stand.</TE>
<TE>Willow and I entered Pac Bell about 30 minutes before the first pitch. Above the left-field seats are a gigantic green Coca-Cola bottle and baseball mitt--part of a playground that includes four slides and a miniature field where youngsters take turns
hitting a foam ball and running the bases, all while watching themselves on a Jumbotron.</TE>
<TE>At the Beaming Station, a steel-box computer transmits season statistics, rosters, team schedules and feature stories on the Giants via infrared beam. It took less than a minute for my personal digital assistant to receive all the data, which included
an electronic score sheet.</TE>
<TE>We settled into our seats, 23 rows behind the Giants' dugout. The first thing we noticed was the extraordinary legroom, width and comfort. I couldn't imagine a better location, high enough to get a full view of the field yet close enough to hear every
fastball pop in the catcher's mitt. In fact, every section of Pac Bell, including the bleacher seats, felt like an intimate outdoor concert hall compared with a certain cavernous stadium off the Pasadena Freeway.</TE>
<TE>I had obtained tickets through the Double Play Ticket Window on the Giants' Internet site, www.sfgiants.com. This is a form of legal scalping that enables season-ticket holders to unload seats to anyone willing to pay a premium. I coughed up $111.90
for
two seats with a face value of $32 apiece. The price included an extra $35 for the ticket holder and $12.90 in fees.</TE>
<TE>Although I chose expensive seats, tickets in all price ranges are available. About a week ago I found 203 offers for tickets to today's game against the Pittsburgh Pirates, ranging from $440 for four front-row seats to $28.60 for a pair of bleacher
seats.</TE>
<TE>To my surprise, Pac Bell was 90% full in the first inning when Jeff Kent slid face-first into third base with a triple, driving in the Giants' first run. The crowd was on its feet roaring. I got goose bumps.</TE>
<TE>We passed up lobster and crab rolls for traditional baseball fare: hot dogs, peanuts and beer. While we basked in our sun-drenched seats, an electronic billboard flashed a question: "Can you imagine anywhere else you would rather be right now?" I
couldn't. Willow could. "Aruba. Hawaii. Nordstrom," she cracked without hesitation.</TE>
<TE>As the game ended (Giants 6, Rockies 1), we swayed to a recording of Tony Bennett singing "I Left My Heart in San Francisco." Outside the park, I counted a dozen restaurants and bars in the South of Market district filling up with still-thirsty fans. I
wondered what this infusion of foot traffic could do for downtown L.A. 81 days a year.</TE>
<TE>We walked to Market Street and jumped on a cable car. The Powell-Hyde line took us past Union Square, Chinatown, Nob Hill and crooked Lombard Street before ending near Fisherman's Wharf.</TE>
<TE>For dinner I suggested Lefty O'Douls, a hofbrau named after the legendary manager of the minor-league San Francisco Seals. BayInsider.com rated O'Douls as "one of our 10 best places for dinner and a show."</TE>
<TE>The place looked inviting enough. A mannequin in a Yankee uniform was posed as the maitre d'. After a glance at the buffet--chicken, turkey and mashed potatoes--I got a queasy feeling, the same one that sets in when I see the food in the office
cafeteria beginning to crust over. I pulled Willow gently by the arm and walked out.</TE>
<TE>A few steps away on Geary Street, we stumbled upon the Daily Grill, a chain we've found reliable in the past. Unfortunately, the service here was lousy, and the chicken Caesar salad was like rubber soaked in mayonnaise.</TE>
<TE>"We should have eaten at O'Douls," Willow said afterward.</TE>
<TE>Breakfast the next morning at "world famous" Sears Fine Food off Union Square did not disappoint. Founded in 1938 by a retired clown and his Swedish wife, Sears is a greasy spoon that attracts long lines, particularly on weekends.</TE>
<TE>House specialties are fresh fruit in a chilled cup and 18 miniature Swedish pancakes with lingonberries. And that's precisely what I order every time. Anything else is consumed at your own risk. (Willow's French toast was drenched with too much egg
batter.)</TE>
<TE>At 9:55 a.m. sharp, it was time to meet a guide and other tourists in the lobby of the St. Francis Hotel on Union Square. For $25 per person (children are free), Peter Moylan offers a fascinating, fact-filled, 17-block historic walking tour
(www.sfhistorytour.com).</TE>
<TE>Moylan is a Giants season-ticket holder, so the daily tour ends in North Beach at precisely 12:40 p.m.--plenty of time to catch a bus to Pac Bell Park before the first pitch at 1:05.</TE>

<HD>In the Sun, Not All Clothing Is Equal</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>KATHLEEN DOHENY</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Most travelers headed to sunny climes know they should pack sunscreen. But fewer will evaluate which of their garments offer maximum protection against sunburn and skin cancer.</LD>
<LD>Experts say they should, because clothing's ultraviolet protection varies, depending on the weave and color of the fabric and whether it has been specially treated to shield the wearer from the sun's rays. Sometimes the protection is negligible, and
sometimes it rivals that of a maximum-SPF sunscreen.</LD>
<LD>About 53,600 new cases of melanoma, the deadliest form of skin cancer, are expected to be diagnosed this year in the United States, the American Cancer Society says, and 7,400 people will die of it. About 1.3 million others will develop non-melanoma
skin cancers, including basal cell and squamous cell carcinomas. While the non-melanoma cancers are highly curable, 2,200 people will die of them in the U.S. this year.</LD>
<TE>So who needs what level of protection from clothing?</TE>
<TE>Travelers with a history of skin cancer should consider UV-protective clothing, even though it can be expensive, says Dr. Warwick Morison, professor of dermatology at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine in Baltimore. Those at high risk for skin
cancer--fair-skinned persons who have skin that always burns, never tans--and those who develop rashes from exposure to the sun should also consider special clothing, he says.</TE>
<TE>Several manufacturers produce the sun-protective clothing, which includes pants, shirts, hats and other gear. For instance, Sun Precautions, (800) 882-7860, www.solumbra.com, offers a classic polo for $59.95, an athletic shirt for $79.95. SunGrubbies,
(888) 970-1600, www.sungrubbies.com, has a children's water shirt for $26.95 and a women's travel shirt for $54.95. Sun Protective Clothing, (800) 353-8778, www.sunprotectiveclothing.com, sells men's pants for $44.50 and a child/youth flip cap for
$16.90. The fabrics vary, but generally they promise to block 95% or more of harmful UV rays.</TE>
<TE>A fabric's degree of protectiveness is known as its UPF, or ultraviolet protection factor. The Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency has established UPF standards and correlated them with the percent of radiation blocked. It
stipulates that a UPF of 20 blocks 95% of UV radiation; a UPF of 50 blocks 98%.</TE>
<TE>The Skin Cancer Foundation rates a UPF of 15 to 29 as providing good protection, 30 to 49 as very good, and 50 and above as excellent, says Jasmine Melzer, a foundation spokeswoman.</TE>
<TE>A less expensive alternative to sun-protective clothing is laundry additives that wash in UV protection. Rit Sun Guard, manufactured by Unilever Bestfoods, has received the Skin Cancer Foundation Seal of Recommendation, which is given to products that
meet the foundation's safety and efficacy criteria and that help prevent sun-induced skin damage.</TE>
<TE>Sun Guard provides protection for up to 20 washings, the manufacturer says, and it works whether the clothing is wet or dry. It may be available at local chain stores (go to www.ritdye.com/sunguard to find out where to buy the product); it can also be
purchased online. Six 1-ounce packets cost about $18, and a packet treats one wash load.</TE>
<TE>In a study of UV-absorbing agents, published last year in the Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology, researchers found that one washing with Sun Guard increased the UPF of a white T-shirt from 4.94 to 10.9. Five Sun Guard treatments boosted
the
T-shirt's UPF to 23. Dyeing the shirt yellow increased its UPF to more than 18, and dyeing it blue raised that number to 38.</TE>
<TE>Choosing clothing carefully from an ordinary wardrobe can help too. If you can't see through the material, its UV protection factor probably is high, says Morison of Johns Hopkins. The closer the weave and the darker the color, the better; bluejeans,
for instance, are very protective.</TE>
<TE>Fabrics to avoid in the sun, according to the Skin Cancer Foundation, are polyester crepe, bleached cotton and viscose, which are transparent to UV. Unbleached cotton, high-luster polyesters and thin, satiny silk can all be highly sun protective
because
they reflect radiation.</TE>
<TE>Morison says that many people forget the need for sun-protective hats and for sunglasses to protect the eyes from UV rays.</TE>
<TE>For more information, see the Skin Cancer Foundation's site, www.skincancer.org, or call the foundation at (800) SKIN-490 (754-6490).</TE>

<HD>Lost Coast Emerges From the Fog</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>JOHN McKINNEY</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>California may have a mighty long coast and millions of acres of wilderness, but it has only one wilderness coast: the Lost Coast in Mendocino County.</LD>
<LD>The Lost Coast is so rough that it thwarted even the state's road engineers, forcing them to route the Redwood Highway (U.S. 101) more than 20 miles inland.</LD>
<LD>Towering shoreline cliffs rise abruptly like volcanoes. Black sand beaches are strewn with driftwood and small stones. The mouths of canyons fill with fog, which nourishes redwoods farther inland.</LD>
<TE>The south side of the Lost Coast, which we'll explore this week, is called Sinkyone Wilderness State Park. This year Sinkyone celebrates its 25th anniversary.</TE>
<TE>Here you'll find the Lost Coast Trail, one of my favorite hikes. Foxgloves, monkey flowers, ferns and blackberry bushes line the path, which is popular with a magnificent herd of Roosevelt elk. The sky fills with gulls and pelicans, and sea lions and
harbor seals gather at Little Jackass Cove. In winter and early spring, gray whales pass by.</TE>
<TE>The Lost Coast Trail is strenuous but rewarding. Give yourself at least two days and two nights to travel between Usal Beach and Bear Harbor. There are a couple of ways to go; either way, hikers will find themselves moving between deep forested canyons
and prominent ridges. On fog-free days, the views are spectacular.</TE>
<TE>The trail empties onto Briceland Road, which continues north toward the Needle Rock Visitor Center, an early 1900s ranch house where you can register for a campsite. You'll cross terraced terrain on the way to Whale Gulch.</TE>
<TE>Beyond Whale Gulch Creek, the path becomes a rugged track that climbs Chemise Mountain and intersects the trails of King Range National Conservation Area.</TE>
<TE>Hikers break up the nearly 22-mile journey by camping along the way. A dozen campsites lie along Lost Coast Trail in northern Sinkyone Wilderness State Park. Most of the camps are near creeks (remember to purify the water) and offer easy access to
secluded black sand beaches. They have picnic tables, fire pits and primitive toilets.</TE>
<TE>The campsites along the Lost Coast Trail are accessible solely by foot. Vehicles are allowed only at Usal Beach at the southern end.</TE>

<HD>Decoding the Mysteries of the Tour Brochure</HD>
<DH>Will you 'see' a sight or 'visit' it? Is the room 'oceanfront' or 'ocean view'? The differences can be significant indeed.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"As a member of an escorted tour, you don't even have to know the Matterhorn isn't a tuba," the late Temple Fielding, father of the Fielding guides, once wrote.</LD>
<LD>That still may be true, but today's traveler can ill afford to be ignorant. I'm referring, of course, to deciphering a tour brochure. Knowing what's offered--and what's not--can mean the difference between taking a grand European tour or a
disappointing
one.</LD>
<LD>A good travel agent should be adept at decoding the lingo. But if you are booking on the Web or directly with a tour operator, you may need help. The Internet is a good starting point, especially sites of the United States Tour Operators Assn.,
www.ustoa.com (click on "About Tours &amp; Packages"), and companies such as industry giant Trafalgar Tours, www.trafalgartours.com. (Click on "Helpful Hints.")</LD>
<TE>The final word, however, should come from the tour operator. Don't be shy about asking exactly what you'll get before you invest hundreds or thousands of dollars in a trip. You may be surprised.</TE>
<TE>Do you think "view" and "see" mean about the same thing? So did I, and so does my dictionary. But Trafalgar's Web site says that "see" means "the tour bus will drive by the site so that you can see it," and "view" means "a photo opportunity or brief
stop."</TE>
<TE>For a more thorough encounter with an attraction, you need to "visit" it, according to the company's glossary: "This means the tour bus will stop and the groups will visit a specific site."</TE>
<TE>Trafalgar doesn't seem to use these definitions consistently. In its description of its 10-day "Real Britain" tour on the Web, I zeroed in on this sentence: "Today we travel south to Coventry, home of Lady Godiva, where we see its two cathedrals, side
by side." I assumed the group would pass by the cathedrals. But no, we would actually go inside, a Trafalgar representative said.</TE>
<TE>Hence this caveat: Call the tour operator. With that in mind, here are some general definitions, gleaned from industry experts:</TE>
<TE>* "Tour" versus "package": Both combine two or more trip components, such as lodging and transportation. But a tour is a trip taken by a group that travels together and follows an itinerary, usually accompanied by a tour manager or escort, the USTOA
says. If you want to be sure of having a tour manager, look for the term "escorted tour." A "package" is designed for people who travel independently and set their own schedules.</TE>
<TE>* "Land-only" versus "all-inclusive" prices: Land-only prices include only land arrangements, such as hotels and sightseeing, not transportation to the tour's starting point. "All-inclusive" usually means the price covers land arrangements plus
round-trip air fare or other transportation. For tours to foreign destinations, there may be "add-on" fares between various domestic cities and the tour's U.S. departure point.</TE>
<TE>Regardless of the terminology, be sure to ask what's included in the price: all meals? tips? taxes? (Some resorts use "all-inclusive" to mean their prices cover more than lodging--usually food and entertainment too. What's actually covered varies
widely.)</TE>
<TE>* "Double occupancy" versus "single supplement": Most tours are priced per person, double occupancy, which assumes there are two people traveling together and staying in the same room. If you're traveling alone, you may be charged a single-room
supplement that can add hundreds of extra dollars. You may be able to avoid the charge by agreeing to room with another group member.</TE>
<TE>* Tour escort, director or manager: A professional who oversees details of the tour operation and accompanies the group. Tour participants are usually expected to tip the escort, but sometimes tips are included in the tour price.</TE>
<TE>* Guides: Separate from the tour escort, you may have a local guide, who points out places of interest and tours specific sites, or a driver-guide, who does the same thing but also drives the vehicle. As with escorts, tour members are usually expected
to tip guides.</TE>
<TE>* "Sightseeing" versus "orientation tour": A sightseeing tour is accompanied by a local city guide; you may make stops. An orientation tour points out places of interest so passengers can later explore them on their own. From a Trafalgar description:
"Embark on a half-day orientation tour of London. See famous monuments, including Buckingham Palace, Big Ben and the Houses of Parliament."</TE>
<TE>* "Time to explore and/or discover": This is free time to do as you please. The brochure may also say you'll be "at leisure."</TE>
<TE>* Transfers: Generally, transportation between the airport and your hotel when you arrive and depart.</TE>
<TE>* Continental breakfast: "Usually consists of bread, rolls, butter, jam and tea or coffee," the USTOA says. As veteran travelers know, such a meal may actually range from stale mini-pastries and instant coffee to a spread of fresh-baked breads, cereal,
milk, fresh fruit and juice. "Buffet breakfast" usually indicates a wider choice. It's worthwhile to ask.</TE>
<TE>* AP and MAP: These stand for "American plan" and "modified American plan." The first term is used by tours or hotels that include breakfast, lunch and dinner in the rate or price; it may also be called "full board." The second plan includes only
breakfast and dinner.</TE>
<TE>* "Table d'hote" versus "a la carte": Table d'hote is a fixed menu that usually consists of an appetizer, a main course (there may be two or three choices) and dessert; tea and coffee are extra. Many tour meals are of this type, so if you have dietary
restrictions, let the company know. A la carte allows unrestricted selection from the menu.</TE>
<TE>* "Oceanfront" versus "ocean-view" room: "Oceanfront" directly faces the ocean. "Ocean view" is "a room from which it is possible to secure a view of the ocean (usually located on the side of the hotel)," the USTOA says. The latter may embrace various
options; make sure you don't have to hang out the window as though you were kissing the Blarney Stone to get a glimpse of the water.</TE>
<TE>* "Why not see?" or "perhaps enjoy": These appear to be invitations, and they are, in a way: invitations to spend more money. From Trafalgar's glossary: "These phrases usually refer to optional excursions not included in the tour package but available
for an additional fee."</TE>
<TE>These terms turn up frequently in descriptions of budget or value tours, in which prices cover the bare essentials. Examples from Trafalgar's 12-day "European Value" tour: "Tonight, perhaps enjoy a Parisian cabaret" and "Why not go out to a West End
show?"</TE>
<TE>Why not indeed? If you can afford it, that is.</TE>

<HD>U.S.-Europe Comparison Is Off Track</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's inappropriate to compare Amtrak with Europe's subsidized train systems ("For Relaxation and Reverie, Sometimes a Train Trip Is the Only Way to Fly," July 28). Amtrak has to contend with two factors that don't exist in Europe and that make it
impossible for long-haul routes to succeed here.</LD>
<LD>The first is the long distances involved. Most train journeys in Europe take less than a day. But a trip across the United States requires four or five days. Amtrak's sleeper compartments are so expensive that most people face the unappealing prospect
of spending three or four nights in their seats.</LD>
<LD>The other factor is American workers' lack of vacation time. Europeans may enjoy a month or more of paid time off, but Americans are fortunate to get two weeks. How many people would want to spend a substantial part of that precious time on a train?</LD>
<TE>As it stands now, the only realistic audience for long-distance train routes is wealthy foreigners and wealthy American retirees: They have plenty of time, aren't keeping to any schedule and can afford overpriced sleeper compartments. For anyone else,
the only practical way to travel long distances in the United States is by airplane or perhaps by car.</TE>
<TE>Amtrak should focus its efforts on improving and promoting its shorter routes. Assuming it can make the trains run on time, Amtrak's short routes could be a practical and desirable alternative to the queues, delays, discomfort and security hassles of
air travel.</TE>
<TE>Long-distance routes may offer nostalgia and views, but they're useless for many travelers.</TE>
<TE>TED R. MARCUS</TE>
<TE>Torrance</TE>
<TE>*</TE>
<TE>Susan Spano's article about Amtrak comes closest to my own sense of the value of Amtrak's long-distance trains. My wife and I frequently travel on the Coast Starlight to San Luis Obispo and on the Southwest Chief to Santa Fe, N.M.</TE>
<TE>As Spano notes, there is a therapeutic state of mind on these trains. You cannot overstate the quiet relaxation and pleasure of these trips, especially when compared with the tension and exhaustion most frequently associated with long car trips.</TE>
<TE>It would be a loss too great to contemplate if we axed these trains under the misguided notion of "saving" Amtrak. We would be amputating not a diseased limb but the heart.</TE>

<LD>Don't be too quick to book passage to the Villa Vannini near Pistoia, Italy ("Unearthing a Hidden Jewel in Tuscany," July 28). I spent one of the worst nights of my life there. The article mentions the hotel's lack of air-conditioning, but of far
greater concern was the lack of heating when I stayed there in October about five years ago. After a night of shivering uncontrollably in my room, I could not wait to leave. Also, the chef was on vacation, and the food was inedible in his absence.</LD>

<LD>What a surprise to see my Uncle Bud's Sourdough Roadhouse on the cover of the Travel section ("Finding Gold Rush Tales and Roadhouse Comforts on the Richardson Highway," July 28). Elstun "Bud" Lauesen owned it in the 1970s and 1980s.</LD>
<LD>One of the lasting memories from my visit to the roadhouse was the "Caribou Clatters" radio message service, which was how they knew that I was arriving from Los Angeles and whether to meet me at the airport in Fairbanks or Valdez.</LD>

<CP>PHOTO: Where in the world is this door to nowhere? A few hints: It's a national historic landmark with worldwide name recognition. Tens of thousands of tourists flock here every year, but when this place opened in 1934, some residents were so
desperate to leave, they died trying. Accommodations included more than 300 rooms, not one worthy of a single Mobil star or AAA diamond. Think island. Think West Coast.  Here's the clincher: Al Capone was its most famous guest. You guessed it (we
hope):
Alcatraz. The door and its demolished walkway had been parts of the old staff living quarters and offices. Castaic reader Jenny Roney photographed them in June on her way to tour the cellblocks.</CP>

<LD>If you're a thrill seeker, you can soar aloft at dawn with hundreds of balloonists from around the world during the Albuquerque International Balloon Fiesta from Oct. 5 to 13. If you're happier with solid ground under your feet, you can watch the
colorful spectacle from the safety of Balloon Fiesta Park.</LD>
<LD>The options come with a New Mexico tour planned from Oct. 5 to 11, during the annual festival, which draws more than 1,000 balloons and nearly a million spectators.</LD>
<LD>From a small gathering of 13 balloons in 1972, the festival has grown to become the largest ballooning event in the world. The schedule includes early-morning mass ascensions of balloons--with 500 or more usually taking part--and daily flying events.</LD>
<TE>The local tour, organized by a Del Mar agency, spends three days at the festival before moving on to Santa Fe. Excursions to the Taos and Acoma pueblos, Kit Carson's home in Taos and Santa Fe, the capital, are included.</TE>
<TE>Cost: $1,500 per person, double occupancy, including transportation within New Mexico, accommodations, two meals daily, guides, entertainment, entrance fees to Balloon Fiesta Park, pueblos and museums. Transportation from Los Angeles to Albuquerque is
not included. Balloon flights are additional.</TE>

<TE>Myanmar: Pagodas</TE>
<TE>A Huntington Beach travel photographer will guide a 21-day tour to some of the most exotic locales and richest archeological sites in Cambodia and Myanmar, formerly called Burma.</TE>
<TE>Among the highlights of the trip, which will depart Jan. 10, will be the temple ruins at Angkor, Cambodia, and extensive touring in Myanmar, including the Shwedagon Pagoda in Yangon (Rangoon), the floating market at Inle Lake, historic Mandalay and the
plains of Bagan (Pagan), a region known for its many temples and pagodas.</TE>
<TE>The group will attend the full moon festival at the temple Ananda, which usually attracts hundreds of Buddhist monks.</TE>
<TE>Leading the tour will be travel and wildlife photographer Michele Burgess, whose credits include Travel &amp; Leisure, Outside, National Geographic Traveler and Travel Holiday magazines. This will be her third trip to the region.</TE>
<TE>Cost: $3,985, including round-trip air fare from Los Angeles, accommodations, many meals and extensive sightseeing.</TE>

<HD>Getting a Bead on Anxiety and Greek Culture</HD>
<DH>Worry beads, or komboloi, are small works of art and as diverse as the people who use them</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIJA RIEDEL</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"They're plastic," Aris Evangelinos said as he snatched the worry beads from my husband's hand and put a match to them. The orange and yellow beads were wrapped in flames. Evangelinos waited a moment, put his nose to the beads and sniffed. I scanned
their edges. Plastic would melt; amber would burn. Peter's komboloi did neither.</LD>
<LD>Evangelinos, founder and curator of the Komboloi Museum in Nafplion, Greece, was uncertain. Peter's mood improved immediately.</LD>
<LD>I had bought Peter the strand of Greek worry beads as a gift a week earlier in Crete, and since then we had been worrying whether it was the objet d'art we had been told it was.</LD>
<TE>Evangelinos lighted another match. The flames lingered.</TE>
<TE>"Well," I asked before he could light a third, "what are they?"</TE>
<TE>Peter's beads were not the standard olive wood or monochromatic plastic. They looked like geologic tie-dye--with layers of red and orange with sepia swirls and bursts of sunset. The beads, we had been told in the small shop where we bought them, were a
mixture of amber and stone from China.</TE>
<TE>"Plastic," declared the owner of our hotel in Crete when he saw them. He pulled from a pocket his own komboloi--deep red, as if cut from a glass of claret sitting in the sun. "Amber," he said, his fingertips passing lightly across a couple of beads,
"from the Komboloi Museum in Nafplion."</TE>
<TE>In the past few hundred years, the Greeks have transformed worrying from a pedestrian experiment to high art. Komboloi have all but cured anxiety. In many countries beads are associated with prayer, but on the streets of contemporary Greece,  komboloi
supply calm companionship and a certain chic. Worrying them is colorful, rhythmic, sensuous.</TE>
<TE>Peter wanted them. He wanted to grasp the whirling or slow, drip-dripping komboloi he heard everywhere in Greece. They ticked and twirled in the hands of restaurant patrons waiting for tables. They sighed in the hands of salesmen tending empty shops.
They wrapped around young and old fingers alike. Beads dropped slowly, one at a time, through the fingers, rapping softly but resoundingly on the bead below.</TE>
<TE>You could find rhythms for every mood, lengths for every hand, beads for every budget. All these rhythms combined sounded like the collective pulse of Greece.</TE>
<TE>Komboloi, traditionally a male distraction, caught my attention too. There was something appealing about this ancient, compact, aesthetic, low-tech antidote to Palm Pilots, cell phones and Internet access anywhere, any time in the split-second timing
of
the 21st century. Stroking beads sends a message to the brain that's different from jabbing at keyboards; its even rhythms unlock a portal to a place light-years from the office.</TE>
<TE>Our search to decipher Peter's beads led us to Nafplion and Aris Evangelinos.</TE>
<TE>The Komboloi Museum is a candy store for the anxious. One wall is covered to the ceiling in strands of cabernet red, amber orange and saffron yellow beads. Smooth to the touch, they feel like poetry to the fingertips. Some are translucent, others built
of so many layers that the eye loses its way before the center is discerned.</TE>
<TE>In this tree- and fortress-filled seaside town on the eastern edge of the Peloponnese, Evangelinos repairs older komboloi and sells contemporary versions of traditional designs. Hanging on the back wall are black-and-white photos of a komboloi workshop
in Egypt, and the first Greek workshop to make the beads. Upstairs is a museum of rosaries and prayer beads that Evangelinos has collected during his travels for more than 20 years.</TE>
<TE>Unfortunately, Peter and I did not make a good first impression. We arrived with komboloi of questionable quality, and we were obviously too ignorant to be buyers of consequence.</TE>
<TE>I retreated up a narrow, well-worn staircase to the museum, four small rooms of beads--Hindu, Buddhist, Muslim, Christian and Greek, most dated from 1750 to 1950. Made from red and black coral, cedar and sandalwood, glass, Bakelite, snake's bone or
mother-of-pearl, some strands held as few as 19 beads, others more than 100. Most surfaces were smooth, but a few had intricately carved or etched designs. A single, rare strand of Tibetan beads made from horn hung next to three strands of black coral
mixed with ivory, silver and amber, and a length of Chinese beads carved from elephant bone. Amber was clearly the material of choice: There were more than a dozen strands of beads, crimson and rust, gold and flaxen, cherry and brick.</TE>
<TE>By the display of Greek komboloi was a typed sign that read: "The only country in the world that never uses a komboloi for religious purposes. We have take this habit from the Turks (Moslems). We made it little bit different than originally was, and it
became like a toy in our hands helping us to calm and also to have something to concentrate and gather." Perplexed grammarians passing through had crossed out certain words and written in others. "The number of the beads is not specified. It depends on
the size and the length related to the size of the hand. The total number of the beads has to be an odd one."</TE>
<TE>I spent more than an hour studying the beads, the signs and the editing. I also flipped through the book Evangelinos had written and published about his lifetime with komboloi--his passion for these unassuming strands of beads passed down to him from
his grandfather and found on his trips through Egypt and Turkey searching for workshops that make high-quality beads.</TE>
<TE>"The eyes alone cannot decide which is the best and most beautiful," Evangelinos' grandfather had told him. "The fingers and the ears must agree as well."</TE>
<TE>The most desirable beads, made from solid amber, are all but impossible to find. If you do find a strand, they will be old and very expensive. Second best are beads made from faturan--amber filings combined with resin. Expertise is needed to evaluate
the color of the bead and its weight and shape, which account for the critically important, harmonious "click" of bead on bead. The edges must be considered: Are they rounded or squared off? Is the amber translucent or opaque? And then there is the
all-important final bead--the "priest"--and the tassel. Many of these choices are purely personal, but certain qualities are unarguably superior to others. It was clear that Evangelinos was a connoisseur of komboloi.</TE>
<TE>When I came back downstairs, Peter and Evangelinos might as well have been sitting on cushions sipping dark, sweet coffee, so thick was the mercantile camaraderie. Evangelinos had been a rug merchant before devoting himself to komboloi, and his history
and expertise showed. It was Peter, the shopaphobic, who surprised me. He truly wanted one of Evangelinos' amber komboloi. But one not too expensive.</TE>
<TE>"Do you have any contemporary komboloi as fine as the old ones upstairs?" I asked. "Or the komboloi that belonged to your grandfather?"</TE>
<TE>Evangelinos looked up. After a hard scan of my eyes, he opened a drawer under his desk and pulled out a strand of heavy, red, solid amber beads.</TE>
<TE>"This belonged to my grandfather," he said. Peter and I knew better than to reach for it. Komboloi etiquette is clear: Never touch unless you're invited to. Some believe that the komboloi take on the aura of their owner, and it can wreck your inner
rhythms if someone else clicks your beads.</TE>
<TE>"Is this the piece that launched your life's journey?" I asked. Evangelinos smiled.</TE>
<TE>He replaced his grandfather's komboloi. Then he reached down to a drawer hidden beneath the counter, withdrew a strand of tangerine-colored komboloi and passed it to Peter. Slowly, Peter ran the beads through his fingers. He held them to his ear and
listened as one bead clicked against the next. He rubbed the beads lightly between his fingers and sniffed the air above them. Evangelinos watched and waited, and then went back to work.</TE>
<TE>Eventually Peter cleared his throat and asked if there might not be one more set of komboloi he might see. Evangelinos scowled and sighed while Peter smiled and stroked the beads, and the whole process began all over again.</TE>
<TE>While Peter studied Evangelinos' wares, Evangelinos had another look at Peter's komboloi. He ran a fingernail over the surface, studied the inside holes. What combination of resin and amber, plastic and stone might this be? He was stumped by a student
and a potential client--which made the mystery less annoying. For Peter, the enigma only improved his feelings for his komboloi.</TE>
<TE>In the window was a deep red strand of 19 transparent beads to which my eye kept returning. I looked at various shades of orange and yellow, but none equaled its warm nuggets. For $6, worrying had never looked so appealing. I took it from the hook,
allowed my fingers and ears their input and, a few minutes later, decided these were the beads for me.</TE>
<TE>Twenty minutes later, Evangelinos was still pulling komboloi from drawers for Peter. He sighed loudly, opened another drawer and withdrew a strand of faturan. Twenty-one beads, transparent and opaque, it radiated a deep warmth and, when rubbed lightly
between the fingers, the faint warm-earth scent of amber. Peter smiled. Here were his amber komboloi--for $30.</TE>
<TE>On a flight a few weeks later, we hit bad turbulence. I watched a few rows ahead of me as 25B's breakfast burrito hovered 12 inches above her tray table. The flight attendant lunged for the dish; the captain illuminated the seat belt sign; I fished for
my komboloi.</TE>
<TE>In the seat next to me, an ophthalmologist stowed his Palm Pilot and glanced at the strand of symmetrical crimson beads in my hands. With flat edges, they were like burnished slices of a crystalline tube. I squeezed the glowing nuggets through my
fingers, moving them one at a time along the coiled red cord.</TE>
<TE>"Turbulence like this is enough to give me religion too," he said.</TE>
<TE>"Oh, I'm not religious. I'm nervous. These are Greek," I managed to get out.</TE>
<TE>The smooth beads eased through my fingertips, each edging toward the next bead, arriving with a calming click. The soothing rhythm caught his 2-year-old daughter's attention, and instinctively she reached for them.</TE>
<TE>His wife, arms clenched around the child, studied my technique. A tense minute passed, and another, but the air got no calmer.</TE>
<TE>"Whatever they are," she said, eyeing my claret nuggets, "could you work them a little faster?"</TE>

<LD>Switzerland has a reputation as an expensive place to visit, but there are bargains for young travelers, from free rental bikes in Zurich to low-cost temporary accommodations in a train at the Swiss National Exposition, Expo 02 (which runs until Oct.
20).</LD>
<LD>The Swiss National Youth Hostel Assn. has set up a youth hostel in a train beside the Neuchatel rail station. This is one of four towns where travelers will find an Expo 02 Arteplage, which is what the exhibition sites are called. The others are in
Biel, Murten and Yverdon. A fifth arteplage is mobile and sails on the lakes between the four cities.</LD>
<LD>The Auberge de Jeunesse "expo sleeper" can accommodate up to 240 people in four rail sleeper carriages with six beds each in its compartments. Rates are about $20 per person, breakfast buffet included, and there are discounts for families. For booking
and information, log on to www.youthhostel.ch/neuchatel.</LD>
<TE>A one-day Expo 02 pass is about $30; students get a 10% discount. They are sold at railway stations. By rail, Neuchatel is 45 minutes from Bern, 90 minutes from Geneva and two hours from Interlaken.</TE>
<TE>"Go to Interlaken," says Natalie Sacks, 17, a Canadian student who spent the last year at school in Switzerland. "There's lots to do--ice climbing, skydiving--and good hostels."</TE>
<TE>Packages from Swiss Youth Hostels Assn. can help you save money if you are visiting Basel, Bonigen-Interlaken, Grindelwald, Lucerne, Montreux, Saanen-Gstaad, St. Moritz, Schaan-Vaduz, Zermatt or Zurich. The three- and five-night packages include
lodging
in dormitory rooms at hostels, buffet breakfasts and the extra fee that nonmembers of an affiliated hosteling association (Hostelling International) must pay. The three-night package costs about $53, the five-night $86. Reservations at least one day
before arrival are required. Information is available from www.youthhostel.ch.</TE>
<TE>Another good source of information for backpackers is the English-language Backpacker News, a free tabloid distributed at rail stations. You can learn about Zurich's free bike rentals (available year-round at the main rail station) or how your Eurail
Pass can be used for a free ride on Zurich's lake steamers.</TE>
<TE>Backpacker News also has an online version (www.backpacker.ch) that gives region-by-region highlights and information on independent hostels throughout the country.</TE>
<TE>Rail Europe (www.raileurope.com) has introduced a Swiss Pass for youths younger than 26, which is valid for four, eight, 15 or 22 days or one month of first- or second-class travel. Four days of second-class travel costs $120. For details on youth rail
fares that you can purchase after your arrival in Switzerland, log onto www.rail.ch/sts.</TE>
<TE>There are thousands of deals for students who travel, but few allow you to go first class. Now you can, if you are traveling to New York City before Sept. 2.</TE>
<TE>The luxury Plaza Hotel is offering 2002 high school and college graduates a room rate of $269 for the first night and $20.02 for the second.</TE>
<TE>Maximum occupancy is four people per room. If you and three friends or family members stay two consecutive nights, the cost is about $36 per person, per night (about $8 more than youth hostel accommodation rates).</TE>
<TE>To be eligible you must be at least 18 years old, arrive on a Sunday or Monday, and present a copy of your degree or diploma and driver's license.</TE>
<TE>For reservations, call (800) 759-3000 or (800) 441-1414 and ask for the 2002 Graduate Package.</TE>
<TE>One way to stretch your travel budget is to stay on campuses during school holiday periods. Many are open to students and nonstudents.</TE>
<TE>Campus rooms, usually singles or twins, offer privacy at budget rates. Stay on Campus (www.stayoncampus.com) is an online source for many campus accommodations in North America. New are brief listings for New Zealand, Australia, England, Ireland and
Scotland.</TE>

<HD>In the Swim</HD>
<DH>Discovery Channel invites David James Elliott and other celebrities to dive into its annual 'Shark Week.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUSAN KING</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"JAG" star David James Elliott is an experienced diver who has had his fair share of shark encounters while exploring the Atlantic Ocean off his home in the Bahamas. So when the Discovery Channel approached him with the opportunity to swim with great
white sharks as part of its 15th annual "Shark Week" programming, he dove in--so to speak--headfirst.</LD>
<LD>"It was one of the most incredible experiences of my life," he says. "I still sit around and go 'wow.' It was so incredible."</LD>
<LD>Last winter, Elliott and zoologist Nigel Marven, the "Celebrity Shark Week" host, swam with great whites off the coast of South Africa. Their experience helps kick off the week of programming Sunday.</LD>
<TE>Elliott says he originally thought his close encounter of the shark kind would be in the relative safety of a cage. But then Marven asked the actor if he would mind swimming free. "I thought he was kidding, and then he said, 'I am not going to be in
the
cage.' " Elliott agreed rather nervously.</TE>
<TE>"The night before, I lay awake in bed saying, 'What have I done?' Because from the first day we were there, we spent the whole day observing them from the boat and feeding them. They were just mind-boggling--how large they are, and with a flick of the
tail they are at top speed. They can turn on a dime."</TE>
<TE>The water was crystal clear when the two made their dive. "Nigel said, 'You will be scared, but the moment you see them, you are struck by their beauty,' " says Elliott. "It was true. We got in the water and the first one showed up and I was just in
awe
of its majesty."</TE>
<TE>A shark expert who was with them on the dive gave both men a 3-inch pipe to hold and a lot of advice. "He said, 'Don't stab them. You'll get them angry and then they'll just kill you. Just hold it out and when they swim into it and it feels hard, it
will put him off and then gently push him away.' It is like pushing away a truck," Elliott says. "He told us, 'Don't let him touch you. If he feels you are soft, you're done for.' They smell fear. They see you long before you see them. They know what
your heart rate is. They can hear it."</TE>
<TE>Discovery Channel's popular "Shark Week" franchise features six new documentaries examining various species and characteristics of the misunderstood ocean creature. Among the highlights are "Great White Attack: A True Story," which chronicles the story
of a series of shark attacks off the East Coast over a 12-day period in 1916, and "Air Jaws II: Even Higher," a sequel to last year's "Air Jaws," which showcases the "flying" great white sharks off the coast of South Africa.</TE>
<TE>Gabrielle Reece, Estella Warren, Brian McKnight, Julie Bowen, Mark McGrath and Adrian Pasdar are the other celebrities participating in the festivities.</TE>
<TE>Dan Salerno, vice president of programming for Discovery, says the network decided to add celebrities to the mix because "after 15 years you are always looking for something new and fresh. It was a neat opportunity to have a little bit of fun and
incorporate them with what we are doing for 'Shark Week.' "</TE>
<TE>Marven had a fun time taking the celebrities to South Africa and the Bahamas and watching their reactions to the sharks. "They generally were scared before they went down," he says. "When you see [sharks] in the water, you can't help but hear the
signature tune from 'Jaws,' but once you are in the water with them, you realize they are not out to get us. They're interested in feeding on fish--not on people."</TE>
<TE>Like Elliott, Bowen ("Ed") went with Marven to South Africa, but she stayed in the cage to witness the great white sharks. In the Bahamas, Marven and the celebrities swam with Caribbean reef sharks and nurse sharks. Pasdar ("Mysterious Ways") helped
Marven with a shark taste test on an evening outing.</TE>
<TE>"Everyone thinks that sharks are the garbage cans of the sea," Marven says. "But we offered them fish and chicken, and it's remarkable: They take the chicken and then they spit it out--so they're not interested in feeding on bird flesh."</TE>
<TE>McGrath, the lead singer of Sugar Ray, wouldn't dive. "He doesn't even like going into elevators," says Marven. "So his adventure was a boat. We met some iguanas and waded in shallow waters with stingrays." And the two captured a baby nurse shark,
which
McGrath got up enough nerve to touch.</TE>
<TE>For Warren ("Planet of the Apes"), Marven hypnotized a shark.</TE>
<TE>"They have these electrical sensors around their mouth, and if you touch one with a metal glove, it sort of knocks out their sensor system and they flip over on their back," says Marven. "You can tickle them like a dog. They just lay there for
sometimes
three minutes as you tickle their tummies."</TE>
<TE>If sharks can ever be thought of as cute, he says, this is the behavior that would qualify.</TE>
<TE>"Celebrity Shark Week" kicks off Sunday at 9 p.m. on the Discovery Channel with "Great White Attack: A True Story" and the celebrity adventure with David James Elliott, followed at 10 p.m. by "Air Jaws II: Even Higher" and the celebrity adventure with
Gabrielle Reece. Shark Week continues Monday through Friday at 9 p.m., and concludes Sunday with an all-day marathon beginning at 11 a.m.</TE>

<HD>Moorer's Comeback Continues</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HAL BOCK</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For a while, Michael Moorer talked clinically about his craft, about
his time as heavyweight champion, about beating Evander Holyfield for
the most coveted title in boxing, about losing it to a pillowy George
Foreman.</LD>
<LD>   And then emotion took over.</LD>
<LD>   "I never had a childhood," he said. "I was always fighting. I
never went to my prom. I never went to the Christmas dance."</LD>
<TE>   The words were coming fast now, tumbling over one another.</TE>
<TE>   "High school graduation, I was in Colorado Springs with an amateur
team,' he said. "I flew in for graduation and I flew right back
afterwards, right back to training."</TE>
<TE>   The grind led Moorer to the pinnacle of boxing, twice heavyweight
champion. And it also led him right out of the ring.</TE>
<TE>   One day in 1997, after being knocked down five times and losing
the title to Holyfield in a rematch, Moorer decided he'd had enough
speed bags and jump ropes, enough of road work and sparring.</TE>
<TE>   So he walked away from the game.</TE>
<TE>   "I was bored with the sport," he said. "I said, 'I'm done with
this.' I wanted to have some fun, and I did.</TE>
<TE>   "I lived my teen-age years in my late 20s. I made up for lost
time."</TE>
<TE>   Indeed.</TE>
<TE>   There was an arrest in 1999 on drunken-driving charges, part of a
troubling romance with alcohol. His weight ballooned to 270 pounds.
He barely resembled the fighter he had been when he ruled the
division.</TE>
<TE>   Moorer was good when he started. He turned pro in 1988 and won his
first 26 fights by knockouts. He was 34-0 by 1994 when he outpointed
Holyfield for the WBA and IBF titles.</TE>
<TE>   Seven months later, he fought Foreman, an old man embraced by
boxing fans for his folksy style. Moorer beat on the big man for 10
rounds and then walked into a right cross that put him down.</TE>
<TE>   "He caught me good," Moorer said. "I tried to get up but my body
wouldn't let me. He became the oldest heavyweight champion in
history."</TE>
<TE>   At 45, Foreman was beloved, the people's champion.</TE>
<TE>   Moorer rebounded from that setback by outpointing Axel Schulz in
Germany to win the IBF title, by then vacated by Foreman. Then in a
title unification bout, Holyfield stopped Moorer in eight rounds and
sent him spiraling into other adventures.</TE>
<TE>   The arrest became big news.</TE>
<TE>   "When you're an athlete and you do something bad, it's out of
proportion," Moorer said. "The average Joe Blow walking down the
street gets in trouble, you never hear about it. With athletes, they
drag it out. Bad news sells. People still talk about something that
happened six, seven years ago."</TE>
<TE>   Eventually, Moorer had enough of life on the wild side. He
remembered his roots, planted so long before in the ring.</TE>
<TE>   The fight game can be addictive, a roller-coaster ride of emotions
that accompanies and often defines the men who climb between the
ropes.</TE>
<TE>   Two years ago, Moorer made the climb again.</TE>
<TE>   "I had to get the hunger back in myself," he said. "It was tough
to go back. I had let my body go. There were no workouts, no
training."</TE>
<TE>   Slowly, he got back into boxing condition. There have been five
fights in the comeback, four wins and a draw. Next up is David Tua,
next Saturday night in Atlantic City as part of HBO's "Boxing After
Dark" series.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm proud of my rebound," Moorer said. "I've grown so much in the
last two years. I've gotten so much out of life."</TE>
<TE>   The fight against Tua matches two old pals who were training
partners in Houston during Moorer's first boxing incarnation, one
that seems a lifetime ago.</TE>
<TE>   "David is a very nice person, but business is business," Moorer
said. "He understands that."</TE>
<TE>   At 34, Moorer is not sure where this comeback will lead him.</TE>
<TE>   "I never thought I'd be boxing this long," he said. "I thought I
would only box in the amateurs through high school. But I had a good
knockout record when I started and I thought, 'Why not stick around?'</TE>
<TE>   "I'm just doing what I know how to do--fight. I want to be the
best at what I do. I don't know what's out there for me as far as my
future."</TE>
<TE>   Then he paused and remembered why all boxers get into this
business in the first place.</TE>
<TE>   "The championship is every fighter's goal," he said. "I can come
back and do it again. I'm blessed to have a second chance."</TE>

<HD>Vote Is Sought to Get Shorter O.C. Light Rail</HD>
<DH>Commuting: Irvine councilmen want colleagues' OK to shrink
the route to 12 miles, perhaps saving the project politically.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAN WEIKEL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>CenterLine was once envisioned as a key transportation chute through
the heart of Orange County--a street-level commuter train that would
run 28 miles and speed riders to Disneyland, Edison Field, South
Coast Plaza, even UC Irvine.</LD>
<LD>   Now, light-rail advocates appear willing to settle for
less--almost 16 miles less--to get the project built.</LD>
<LD>   If Irvine Mayor Larry Agran and Councilman Mike Ward have their
way at Tuesday's City Council meeting, CenterLine will be reduced to
a 12-mile, three-city system that would go from downtown Santa Ana to
Irvine City Hall. It would be the second time in two years that the
project has been scaled back, and the surviving route would no longer
reach many of the high-demand destinations the original architects of
CenterLine had in mind.</LD>
<TE>   "Opposition can shape a project," said county Supervisor Todd
Spitzer, who is also chairman of the Orange County Transportation
Authority. "What we are going through is not any different than other
light-rail projects around the country."</TE>
<TE>   In early 2001, Arthur Leahy, OCTA's chief executive officer,
shelved the 28-mile version of CenterLine because of neighborhood and
political opposition to the suggested route. As originally planned,
the line would have run from downtown Fullerton to the Irvine
Transportation Center.</TE>
<TE>   Eighteen miles of the project were resurrected late last year
after OCTA forged a coalition with city councils in Irvine, Costa
Mesa and Santa Ana. Preliminary engineering studies are underway.</TE>
<TE>   The latest Irvine proposal would cut six miles from the 18-mile
route and remove stops at the Irvine Spectrum commercial complex and
the Irvine Transportation Center, a major transit hub. South Coast
Plaza, the Irvine Business Complex and the Santa Ana Civic Center
would remain destinations.</TE>
<TE>   Agran and Ward want to eliminate the route through or near several
Irvine neighborhoods, such as Woodbridge and Oak Creek, where
residents have been staunch CenterLine opponents.</TE>
<TE>   Woodbridge, for example, has about 9,000 dwellings and 30,000
residents. The seven-member board of its neighborhood association has
unanimously opposed the light-rail system.</TE>
<TE>   Supporters of the Irvine proposal say it is necessary to make
light rail more politically palatable for county residents and to
neutralize opponents who think the project is a $1.4-billion
boondoggle.</TE>
<TE>   If the scaled-back system is built, light-rail advocates predict
that CenterLine will work so well that many cities and neighborhoods,
even the stubbornly resistant, will clamor to become part of the
network.</TE>
<TE>   The latest proposal "will defuse some of the opposition and take
the alignment to where it is needed and wanted," Agran said. "Once
people see and touch CenterLine, the next fight will be a fight to be
included."</TE>
<TE>   County transportation officials say solid political support is
critical for the project and for OCTA's ability to secure hundreds of
millions of dollars in federal transportation funds.</TE>
<TE>   Critics contend that the scaled-back proposal is entirely
political, designed in part to improve support for Agran and
candidates he supports in the November city election. Agran denies
that the change is an election ploy.</TE>
<TE>   Opponents Adamant</TE>
<TE>   Eliminating some Irvine neighborhoods from the CenterLine route,
opponents say, will not thwart their efforts. If anything, they say,
they are emboldened in their drive to kill the project in Irvine with
a citywide ballot initiative. The measure, now undergoing a review by
city officials, might be ready for unveiling at the City Council
meeting Tuesday night.</TE>
<TE>   CenterLine opponents hope to gather enough signatures to qualify
the measure for a special election expected to be called in February
or March to fill Supervisor Spitzer's seat. Spitzer is likely to win
a state Assembly post.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think people believe they will be protected by this
change" to a 12-mile route, said John Kleinpeter, an anti-CenterLine
activist. "It's only a matter of time before they will expand the
line to the Spectrum. Eventually, it will have to go through
residential neighborhoods."</TE>
<TE>   Irvine city officials say they would like to build the line to the
Irvine Transportation Center at a later date along another route. It
would head north from the Civic Center to the Tustin train station,
then proceed along the Metrolink right of way to the transit complex.</TE>
<TE>   Agran said such an alignment would have trains passing through
residential neighborhoods already accustomed to such traffic. But
CenterLine opponents say those areas might not tolerate more rail
service.</TE>
<TE>   "This is an immensely unpopular project in Irvine," said
Councilman Greg Smith, who opposes CenterLine.</TE>
<TE>   "Doing it in bits and pieces is less painful politically. Once the
initial project is on the ground, they will want to spend more money
to expand it and protect their investment."</TE>
<TE>   Activists who oppose CenterLine have broader concerns that light
rail is one of the most expensive and least efficient forms of public
transportation in a sprawling, suburban setting such as Orange
County.</TE>
<TE>   Buses, they say, are a better option because they are much
cheaper, more flexible in scheduling and, in total, carry far more
passengers.</TE>
<TE>   Nationally, many light-rail systems have been fraught with cost
overruns and less-than-projected ridership. Studies show the systems
have contributed little to reducing air pollution and traffic
congestion.</TE>
<TE>   "Most of the same people who take buses end up taking rail. People
don't get to work any quicker, and existing bus service would serve
rail riders better," said professor Mike McNally of UCI's Institute
of Transportation Studies.</TE>
<TE>   "If you are going to spend $1 billion, there are better ways to
spend it than for light rail."</TE>
<TE>   CenterLine advocates say the nation needs to break its dependence
on motor vehicles.</TE>
<TE>   They say air pollution must be cut, land is limited for city
highways, rail is safer and rush-hour road congestion will worsen.</TE>
<TE>   "You need a diversified transportation system," Agran said.</TE>
<TE>   "We spend billions of dollars every year on freeways jammed with
traffic. There is only so much of the county we can pave over. If we
don't get serious and deal with our mobility problems, we will be
choking on our own exhaust fumes."</TE>
<TE>   Agency's Concerns</TE>
<TE>   Agran contends there is council support to approve the shortening
of CenterLine, but some on the OCTA Board of Directors say some
serious issues must be resolved before they will go along with the
idea.</TE>
<TE>   Four OCTA board members on the agency's planning committee have
signaled Irvine city officials about their concerns and proposed
sending a formal letter to the Irvine City Council.</TE>
<TE>   They say they worry about greater traffic around the Irvine Civic
Center, the inability to have a maintenance yard at the closed El
Toro Marine Corps Air Station, and the money OCTA would have to spend
for bus service and transit improvements at the City Hall stop.</TE>
<TE>   OCTA wants the project to reflect community input from advocates
and critics, said Leahy, who partly blames the failure of the 28-mile
plan on OCTA's unwillingness to compromise with critics.</TE>
<TE>   Although OCTA board members have concerns about the Irvine
proposal, Leahy praised the idea as a way to remove a bloc of
opposition to CenterLine and reduce the cost of the project's first
phase.</TE>
<TE>   "This will help with federal approval and we can retain the
three-city coalition," Leahy said.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, before it can be built, "the project has to make
good economic and transportation sense."</TE>

<HD>Farm Workers Urge Davis to Sign Binding Arbitration
Legislation</HD>
<DH>Labor: First-of-its-kind law could force growers into pacts
with pickers, who see justice issue. Farmers fear family operations
failing.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NANCY CLEELAND</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When a young mushroom picker named Jose Garcia defied his employer
and voted to join the United Farm Workers 27 years ago, he figured
he'd done the hard part. The wage hikes, health benefits and job
security promised by labor hero Cesar Chavez in a bruising campaign
were sure to be just around the corner.</LD>
<LD>   But Garcia, now 46, said he earns less in inflation-adjusted
dollars than he did as a teenager. His medical care is limited to
what he can get at the local emergency room. And the security he
longed for is still elusive.</LD>
<LD>   Like thousands of other agricultural workers in California, Garcia
is in labor limbo: technically represented by a union but not covered
by a contract. "We try to bargain," said Garcia, a member of the
union negotiating team at the Pictsweet Mushroom Farm in Oxnard.
"They take our proposals and laugh."</LD>
<TE>   A bill on Gov. Gray Davis' desk would put the impasse at Pictsweet
and several others like it in the hands of an arbitrator, who could
force the parties into a contract and dictate its terms. The measure
would be the first of its kind in the nation.</TE>
<TE>   Tennessee-based United Farms Inc., which owns Pictsweet, did not
return repeated phone calls last week. The firm has declined to
publicly comment on the arbitration bill or the company's labor
issues in the past months. About a year ago, officials said that
their workers receive wages and benefits comparable to those paid at
other mushroom farms.</TE>
<TE>   Growers adamantly oppose the bill, saying arbitration for an
initial contract is unconstitutional, unfair and economically
dangerous. "We have 80,000 farms in the state," said Thomas Nassif,
president of the Western Growers Assn. "Are we going to change our
laws because the union can't get a contract with a couple of
employers?"</TE>
<TE>   Davis, who is running for reelection, has not indicated whether he
will sign the bill into law. He must act within 12 days.</TE>
<TE>   The UFW plans to maintain a vigil outside the state Capitol until
Davis acts, and union co-founder Dolores Huerta has vowed to start a
public fast if the governor vetoes the bill.</TE>
<TE>   First contracts are notoriously tough for any union to negotiate,
but the UFW says it is at a particular disadvantage because so much
farm work is seasonal and transient.</TE>
<TE>   Union spokesman Marc Grossman said the numbers speak for
themselves: Of the 428 elections won by the union since the state's
Agricultural Labor Relations Act became law in 1975, only
158--37%--resulted in contracts.</TE>
<TE>   Grower organizations say those numbers are deceptive, because some
businesses went bankrupt before a contract could be reached, and
workers at others voted to decertify the union.</TE>
<TE>   They also note that state law already provides a "make whole"
remedy, which forces growers to compensate workers if contracts are
not negotiated in good faith.</TE>
<TE>   Since 1975, the Agricultural Labor Relations Board has ordered 58
employers to pay about $34 million under that provision. Only $4.4
million has been paid, according to a recent report from board
Chairwoman Genevieve A. Shiroma.</TE>
<TE>   In her report to state Sen. Mike Machado (D-Linden), Shiroma said
the language of the original law makes enforcement difficult and
susceptible to years of litigation.</TE>
<TE>   In agriculture, long-term employment is rare. But mushroom farms
provide year-round work and an opportunity to set down roots. That
was a draw for Garcia, who took the job at Pictsweet 30 years ago as
17-year-old immigrant from Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   He married, bought a small two-bedroom house, started a family. He
showed younger workers how to pick through the dark mushroom beds
stacked to the ceiling, lights strapped to their foreheads, suspended
on safety lines "like monkeys."</TE>
<TE>   Along with a majority of the farm's 150 workers, he voted for the
union in 1975, three months after the state agricultural labor law
was adopted in a wave of elections that followed a 1,000-mile march
through the state by Chavez.</TE>
<TE>   Several months later, the company and workers signed a contract
providing paid family medical insurance and incremental raises. "The
12 years we had with them were very good," he recalled.</TE>
<TE>   But after a series of ownership changes, the company was bought
out of bankruptcy in 1987 by Tennessee-based United Foods Inc.
Workers agreed to temporarily suspend the union contract and take a
pay cut to help the business survive.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, Garcia said, sporadic attempts to revive the contract
have ended in frustration. "If it weren't for my wife's job, forget
it, I wouldn't be able to survive," said Garcia, who earns about $350
in an average week. "We have no savings, nothing. We have enough to
eat, but we're always just getting by."</TE>
<TE>   In his view, company attorneys have merely gone through the
motions of negotiating while holding down wages to 1987 levels. He
said they had no intention of making a deal.</TE>
<TE>   Union officials said that relatively few employers practice
insincere "surface bargaining" but that those who do drain resources.
Until a contract is signed, workers pay no union dues.</TE>
<TE>   "At Pictsweet, we have to spend half a million a year to fight
this guy," said UFW President Arturo Rodriguez. "If you do this with
every single employer, you're going to run out of money fast."</TE>
<TE>   The difficulty of obtaining contracts, and with them gains in
wages and benefits, also dampens enthusiasm for organizing, Rodriguez
said. A binding arbitration law "at least gives us an opportunity to
get out there and get started," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Once more than 100,000 strong, UFW membership now hovers at about
27,000.</TE>
<TE>   Growers Feel Threatened</TE>
<TE>   While the UFW views arbitration as a boon, farm groups say it
could bankrupt already-struggling growers.</TE>
<TE>   "If approved, this legislation would apply even in cases where
farmers make a good-faith effort to create a contract with union
negotiators. It would throw the issue to a state arbitrator who is
unfamiliar with the complexities of agricultural production and the
economic realities that farm employers face when producing highly
perishable products," said California Farm Bureau Federation
President Bill Pauli.</TE>
<TE>   "It is not out of the realm of possibility that some family
farmers, already squeezed by high production costs and poor prices,
would be forced out of business by such an unfair process," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The law would come into play if a union and employer failed to
reach a contract within 90 days of a union election. A mediator would
then have 30 days to fashion a compromise. If no deal resulted,
either party could petition the state labor board to submit the
matter to binding arbitration.</TE>
<TE>   Growers say the potential for arbitration could encourage union
negotiators to make unreasonable demands in the hope that an
arbitrator would meet them halfway. Union officials say the threat of
arbitration would force both sides to be sober and practical.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not asking for something out of this world," said Garcia.
"All we want is a neutral person to say if we are right or the
company is right."</TE>

<HD>Dam Dispute Looses a Flood of Emotions</HD>

<DL>HETCH HETCHY VALLEY, Calif.</DL>
<LD>Ron Good surveys the high-walled splendor of this prehistoric corner
of Yosemite National Park and solemnly promises to renew the
long-dormant environmental battle that broke the spirit of famed
naturalist John Muir.</LD>
<LD>   "Look what humans have done here," he scowls. "Trust me; this will
not stand."</LD>
<LD>   Good and a cadre of conservationists have launched a campaign to
remove the dam that flooded the valley Muir considered sacred, its
waterfalls and towering rock faces rivaling the majesty of Yosemite
Valley itself.</LD>
<TE>   Completed in 1923 to supply water and power for a growing San
Francisco, the dam altered the course of the Tuolumne River and
inundated much of the natural beauty celebrated by Muir.</TE>
<TE>   The activists are threatening to oppose a $4-billion seismic
retrofit of the city's water delivery system unless officials agree
to explore alternatives to Hetch Hetchy that could lead to tearing
down O'Shaughnessy Dam. They say there are existing reservoirs
downstream on the Tuolumne--behind the Don Pedro and Calaveras
dams--that would provide adequate water storage.</TE>
<TE>   If its request is denied, Good's coalition of environmentalists
intends to oppose a $1.6-billion bond measure that officials want to
put on the November ballot. The money would help pay for repairs to
the 160-mile-long complex of aqueducts, running from Yosemite to the
Bay Area, that supplies water to 2.4 million homes in 31 communities.</TE>
<TE>   The improvement project would be among the largest in city history
but would matter little to Good and his allies if it didn't help
bring back Hetch Hetchy.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a place where nature should prevail," said Good,
executive director of Restore Hetch Hetchy and a former Sierra Club
lobbyist, shouting over the roar of water at the 312-foot dam.
"Instead, a once-wild river has been choked off. You might as well
flood the floor of the Sistine Chapel, because that's what they've
done."</TE>
<TE>   While mainstream environmentalists like the Sierra Club have yet
to endorse Good's effort to undam Hetch Hetchy, some San Francisco
supervisors have termed the proposal "intriguing." Said Supervisor
Aaron Peskin: "People say this dam is the sin of our ancestors. For
me, taking it down is definitely worth exploring."</TE>
<TE>   But Mayor Willie Brown isn't buying the idea. "These people are
not even a blip on the radar screen," said Brown spokesman P.J.
Johnston. "They have absolutely no cachet here. In a city with the
most knee-jerk, liberal, environmentally enthusiastic people in the
world, there is no talk whatsoever of funding a study for some pet
project to tear down that dam."</TE>
<TE>   Hetch Hetchy activists say such comments demonstrate San
Francisco's hypocrisy when it comes to environmental causes. Locals
are fond of displaying "Save Mono Lake" bumper stickers to protest
how Los Angeles has siphoned water from the Mono Basin and Owens
Valley.</TE>
<TE>   And although Bay Area environmentalists condemn the manipulation
of natural resources to move water from north to south, their
ideological forefathers erected the only major dam inside a national
park, activists say.</TE>
<TE>   "The Bay Area prides itself on its environmental ethic while
drawing its water from a national park, out of something the country
now regards as a major mistake," said Roderick Nash, professor
emeritus of history at UC Santa Barbara.</TE>
<TE>   Besides altering the geography of a national park, the activists
charge, San Francisco officials have treated Hetch Hetchy as their
own private preserve, maintaining a pricey chalet at the reservoir
for their exclusive use while restricting tourist visiting hours. As
a result, Good says only 2% of Yosemite's 3 million annual visitors
see Hetch Hetchy.</TE>
<TE>   Standing recently on the shore of the reservoir, Good read for
mystified tourists his "Hetchysburg Address." It begins "Four score
and seven years ago, our fathers brought forth upon this continent a
new dam and reservoir, conceived in the Bay Area, and dedicated to
the proposition that all national parks are not created equal."</TE>
<TE>   In 1987, Donald P. Hodel, secretary of the Interior under
President Reagan, challenged city officials to tear down the dam and
restore Hetch Hetchy Valley. Calling the request political
gamesmanship, Democrat Dianne Feinstein--the city's mayor at the
time--referred to Hetch Hetchy as "a San Francisco birthright,"
adding that to destroy the dam would be "dumb, dumb, dumb."</TE>
<TE>   The original battle over Hetch Hetchy--an Indian term for "Grass
Valley"-- became the first national controversy over Western water
rights. After the 1906 earthquake, when water was in short supply to
douse the resulting fires, San Francisco renewed its decades-old
efforts to tap Yosemite for water.</TE>
<TE>   Muir lobbied Congress and three presidents--including Theodore
Roosevelt--to prevent the city from building the dam. Referring to
San Francisco officials as "Satan and Co.," and the "grabbers of
water and power," he enlisted the voices of newspapers nationwide.</TE>
<TE>   A New York Times editorial referred to the big city "steam roller"
in questioning the wisdom of sacrificing "a large part of the
Yosemite National Park to the tender mercies of the San Francisco
Philistines who know how to 'improve' the handiwork of the Creator."</TE>
<TE>   In response, officials dismissed environmentalists opposing the
dam as "short-haired women and long-haired men."</TE>
<TE>   Congress soon approved the damming of the Tuolumne River in Hetch
Hetchy's narrow lower end, entombing the valley's meandering meadows
and streams under 300 feet of water. The year before his death in
1914, the decision prompted Muir to exclaim: "Dam the Hetch Hetchy!
As well dam for water tanks the people's cathedrals and churches, for
no holier temple has ever been consecrated by the heart of man."</TE>
<TE>   Feinstein, now a U.S. senator, still scoffs at dismantling the
dam. "Tearing down the dam at this time is one of the worst things
that could happen," she said in a statement. "It could jeopardize the
drinking water for 3 million people. The effort to take down this
crown jewel is not something new. We fought back in the past, and
similar efforts were not successful."</TE>
<TE>   The activist coalition--which includes Environmental Defense and
the Planning and Conservation League--wants San Francisco to spend
$600,000 to fund a feasibility study on relocating the city's
reservoir outside Yosemite.</TE>
<TE>   The activists have asked for an answer before Aug. 27, the
deadline for submitting arguments for the city's November ballot.</TE>
<TE>   The Sierra Club has yet to join the coalition, and its
conservation director, Bruce Hamilton, admits the effort is a
longshot. "But in the long haul," he said, "it's more valuable for
society to have back a second Yosemite Valley than a water storage
tank inside a national park."</TE>
<TE>   Yet historians say the water stakes are too high for San Francisco
to surrender its dam easily.</TE>
<TE>   "Hetch Hetchy is at the core of San Francisco's urban identity,"
said historian and State Librarian Kevin Starr. "This dam is a
sacrifice made to create a great city. Whether you can come back and
rewrite the story is an enterprise of heroic magnitude. I just don't
see the will to tear it down, which is the equivalent of dismantling
the city's civic identity."</TE>
<TE>   Supervisor Tom Ammiano agrees that San Francisco has a chip on its
shoulder when it comes to Hetch Hetchy: "There's pride involved here.
People feel very proprietary about this dam."</TE>
<TE>   Hodel says his challenge to San Francisco to do right by Hetch
Hetchy still stands.</TE>
<TE>   "The thought of watching that valley come back to life is
exciting," he said. "But I'd leave one piece of that dam intact as a
reminder of what we did to this valley. If you totally erase it, no
one would believe that anyone would ever have had the audacity to
flood something so beautiful."</TE>
<TE>   Even with its dam, national park officials say, Yosemite is still
a place that would make Muir proud.</TE>
<TE>   Said Yosemite Supt. Dave Mihalic: "I'd like to think that if John
Muir came back today and saw the changes to the Bay Area, if he had
to take those freeways and endure all that traffic, by the time he
arrived here in Yosemite, he'd actually be pretty pleased the way it
looks now, despite the dam."</TE>
<TE>   But that's not enough for Good. The activist, who insists that he
can see the image of Muir in one of Hetch Hetchy's rock faces, says
the bearded conservationist's soul still haunts the place.</TE>
<TE>   "We think we're so smart, managing every drop of water, every
snowflake," he said. "There's no other opportunity like this on Earth
to restore such beauty. Man built this dam. Man can take it down."</TE>

<HD>Dual Role Raises Lobby Questions</HD>
<DH>Ethics: Firm was paid by L.A. Unified to push a Nov. 5 bond
issue while it also was representing developers seeking contracts
with the district.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SOLOMON MOORE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For four months, the Rose &amp; Kindel lobbying firm had unusual access
to Los Angeles Unified School District policymakers: It worked for
the school system it also was being paid to lobby.</LD>
<LD>   District officials hired Rose &amp; Kindel in March to run a $100,000
campaign to educate voters about a $3.3-billion school construction
bond measure on the Nov. 5 ballot. Until last month, the powerful
firm also represented construction companies, developers and
consultants seeking contracts with the district.</LD>
<LD>   Though there was nothing illegal about the way Rose &amp; Kindel
lobbied for both sides, some school board members and ethics experts
say the arrangement is a strong argument for tougher rules on
lobbying and potential conflicts of interest in the nation's
second-largest school district.</LD>
<TE>   The district does not track or register lobbyists, and the rules
it has are not enforced consistently. In 1998, school officials
called for a filing system to be set up to track lobbyists, their
clients and their fees, but the proposal was delayed for lack of
funding.</TE>
<TE>   Few school boards have detailed lobbyist disclosure rules unless
they are affiliated with county or municipal governments. The
independent school districts of San Diego, Sacramento and San
Francisco, for example, do not have lobbyist registries. New York's,
as part of city government, does.</TE>
<TE>   But Jim Knox, California director of the political watchdog group
Common Cause, said L.A. Unified, which controls more than $9 billion
a year, is too large to have toothless disclosure rules.</TE>
<TE>   "Any agency that controls such a large amount of public funds is
going to be subject to tremendous lobbying pressures," said Knox.
"And it's important for the public to know where that pressure is
coming from and how interest groups may be using money to gain unfair
advantage."</TE>
<TE>   Several of the companies Rose &amp; Kindel represented stand to make
millions if voters approve the construction bonds, intended to
finance 120 new school buildings and 79 campus expansions in the next
five years.</TE>
<TE>   As a result of inquiries made by The Times, however, about its
simultaneous relationship with L.A. Unified and aspiring district
contractors, Rose &amp; Kindel issued a July 15 letter saying it was
"terminating our representation of clients before the district in
favor of working exclusively for the district."</TE>
<TE>   "We do not want even a perception of conflict to interfere in any
way with the objective we share with the district," wrote the firm's
president, Maureen A. Kindel, who, with co-founder Cristina Rose,
expanded the company's influence after she served in Mayor Tom
Bradley's administration.</TE>
<TE>   She insisted that her firm had never represented both sides on an
issue.</TE>
<TE>   But school officials acknowledged that Rose &amp; Kindel had
represented two firms seeking construction management contracts to be
funded partly by the bond issue while the lobbying firm also worked
on the bond campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Rose &amp; Kindel lobbied L.A. Unified personnel on behalf of Parsons
Infrastructure &amp; Technology Group Inc., which won a $29.9-million
contract, and a joint venture of 3D International Inc. and URS Corp,
which was awarded a $14-million job.</TE>
<TE>   District staff members then recommended the two joint-venture
firms for an additional $20.6-million contract. But that was put on
hold after The Times disclosed that the Baltimore County school
system had terminated a large contract with 3D International because
of alleged management problems.</TE>
<TE>   Supt. Roy Romer argued that, strictly speaking, he hadn't hired
Rose &amp; Kindel to be a district lobbyist on construction bonds because
the firm was providing information, not advocating before government
agencies.</TE>
<TE>   L.A. Unified used a $100,000 grant from the billionaire SunAmerica
chairman, Eli Broad, to hire Rose &amp; Kindel for the information
effort. Under state campaign laws, public agencies are entitled to
fund educational outreach efforts on ballot initiatives, as long as
they are not overtly political or persuasive in nature.</TE>
<TE>   "They're not lobbying for us," Romer said of Rose &amp; Kindel. "I
just hired them to help us build a network of opinion-makers."</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, while working on the information campaign, Maureen
Kindel in July arranged for a fund-raiser at the exclusive California
Club downtown to raise money for passage of the bonds. And Romer
acknowledged that he had made fund-raising calls from Rose &amp; Kindel's
offices.</TE>
<TE>   Kindel said she saw no problem with arranging for the fund-raiser.
"I did it as a nice gesture, as a member of the California Club," she
said.</TE>
<TE>   The firm's other activities included educating such public
officials as Sheriff Lee Baca and groups like the League of Women
Voters about the bond measure, Kindel said. She tried to convince
them that the district has changed for the better and is hiring
skilled professionals to buy property and to design and build
schools.</TE>
<TE>   "I know a lot of people, and people answer my phone calls," said
Kindel. "People know I'm credible, and the district needs that."</TE>
<TE>   Rose &amp; Kindel's contract with the district ended last month. Now
it is working for the nonprofit Alliance for Neighborhood Kids on an
avowedly political campaign in support of the bonds.</TE>
<TE>   To one school board member, Genethia Hudley-Hayes, all this
overlap adds up to a problem. "The bottom line is that it's a
conflict of interest for Rose &amp; Kindel to be working for the district
and have clients trying to lobby the district," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Board President Caprice Young, however, denied that lobbying
arrangements had led to undue influence or favoritism.</TE>
<TE>   The district's ethics officer, Peter Bowen, said he had not heard
of Rose &amp; Kindel or vetted its contract with L.A. Unified. In
general, though, "People who are acting as a lobbyist for us are not
supposed to be lobbying to us."</TE>
<TE>   He said he was drafting guidelines on what constitutes lobbying.</TE>
<TE>   Such ethics guidelines have grown in importance as the bond
campaign has gained steam. Although voters passed a similar
$2.4-billion ballot item in 1997, many were angered later by the
district's mismanagement of some school-repair funds. Both proponents
and opponents agree that the new bond measure will be a referendum on
the district's credibility.</TE>
<TE>   "We need to ensure voter confidence and trust in how the district
does business with corporations and lobbyists, in light of the
billions that will come to the district if the bond is approved,"
said one board member, Jose Huizar.</TE>
<TE>   Huizar, who recently proposed a study on the costs of a
computerized lobbyist registry and adding ethics office personnel,
estimated that he gets lobbied about four times a month by various
firms.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't have a problem with that," he said. "I just think it
should be transparent."</TE>
<TE>   In other branches of government, officials said, disclosure of
lobbying relationships is generally the best guard against
impropriety or the appearance of it.</TE>
<TE>   "Then everybody is always aware of what's happening and you can
never be accused of doing anything under the table," said Chief
Deputy City Atty. Terree Bowers of Los Angeles, which requires
lobbyists to register with the city.</TE>
<TE>   At the district, some ethicists and school officials also are
troubled by board members' private relationships with lobbyists. In
addition to representing private district contractors, Rose &amp; Kindel
also was hired by supporters of Young to help advocate for new
geographical boundaries that she favored for voting districts.</TE>
<TE>   City records show that the Coalition for Kids, a campaign panel
formed by former Mayor Richard Riordan and Eli Broad, hired Rose &amp;
Kindel for that purpose last winter. Young acknowledged that the
organization had paid Rose &amp; Kindel $30,000 to lobby the Los Angeles
City Council on behalf of the map she sought. The City Council vote
approved those boundaries in June, three months after Rose &amp; Kindel
started working for the district on the bond initiative.</TE>
<TE>   Young said the arrangement was separate from any issue before the
board and resulted in no favoritism toward Rose &amp; Kindel.</TE>
<TE>   Municipal records also show that United Teachers-Los Angeles had
paid the lobbying firm Cerrell Associates $12,500 to support a rival
bid for an electoral map preferred by board member Julie Korenstein.
The teachers union lost that battle. Cerrell also worked on the
district's bond information campaign last year, according to Fabian
Nunez, a former district lobbyist who is now working on behalf of the
bond measure.</TE>
<TE>   Bob Stern, president of the Center for Governmental Studies and an
author of California's political reform laws, said he was troubled by
these relationships.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously, the public perception would be that they would tend to
favor people or firms who are representing them privately," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Separately, both Young and Korenstein said the arrangements had
resulted in no favoritism toward the lobbyists. Young added that the
district boundary issue was separate from any matter before the
school board.</TE>
<TE>   Beyond formal arrangements, some school officials and auditors are
concerned about informal contact between district employees at
parties and political events. L.A. Unified's code of conduct does not
specify proper or improper contacts; it issues only a caution "to
prevent an actual or implied impression that such contacts will
result in preferential treatment."</TE>
<TE>   "I get lobbied several times a day," said Anne Fischer, L.A.
Unified's procurement chief. She said she often refers lobbyists to
other department heads.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, L.A. Unified facilities officials collected thousands
of dollars for a Christmas party from district contractors such as
Arthur Andersen, Pinnacle One, Gateway Science &amp; Engineering, and
Rodriguez &amp; Associates. A confidential report by L.A. Unified's
internal auditor in March called the solicitation of funds from
companies that had millions of dollars in district contracts, "a
serious violation of the Ethics Code."</TE>
<TE>   As a result of the auditor's investigation, the district fired
Edie Lopez, an outside consultant, who was Deputy Facilities
Executive Kathi Littmann's chief of staff and co-chairwoman of the
party planning committee. Chief Facilities Executive James A.
McConnell scolded Littmann in a letter and ordered her office to
contact the ethics office for a training seminar on the code of
conduct.</TE>
<TE>   Littmann could not be reached for comment on the Christmas party.</TE>
<TE>   Several L.A. Unified board members said they rarely had contact,
formal or informal, with lobbyists.</TE>
<TE>   Board members Lansing, Korenstein and Marlene Canter said they had
virtually no contact. Young said she has infrequent meetings with
lobbyists and with Kindel, who is a personal friend. Board member
David Tokofsky said he had lunched with Kindel on occasion, but that
she had never discussed her clients.</TE>

<HD>The Real Issue Is Revenue</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A no-nonsense legal opinion issued last week delivers a strong but
necessary message to bargain-hunting retailers and cash-strapped
cities intent on using eminent domain to clear land for
tax-generating storefronts. But the 36-page document written by a
U.S. District judge stopped short of addressing the underlying
pressure that forces municipalities to embrace a Gold Rush mentality
when it comes to generating sales tax revenue.</LD>
<LD>   The Aug. 7 opinion brought a temporary but welcome halt to the
city of Cypress in its controversial bid to use eminent domain to
take land owned by a church.</LD>
<LD>   Cypress wants to sell the disputed 18 acres to Costco and reap a
bonanza in sales tax revenue. Cottonwood Christian Center wants to
use the land it bought in 1999 for a huge church complex. The dispute
is heading toward a March trial date.</LD>
<TE>   This isn't the simple church versus state confrontation that some
are suggesting. Cypress infringed on the church's freedom of
religion, according to Judge David O. Carter.</TE>
<TE>   And Cottonwood's cause is being embraced by supporters nationwide
who are portraying Cypress as biased against churches. The Becket
Fund for Religious Liberty applauded the opinion for sending a strong
message that "it's not right to take a church's property."</TE>
<TE>   But it isn't fair to cast Cypress City Council members as uncaring
bigots. The city has gone as far as tabulating the number of churches
per capita to show that residents needn't travel far to find a place
to worship. It's clear that the eminent domain action was driven by
economics. Simply put, big retail stores generate sales tax revenue
and places of worship generally don't.</TE>
<TE>   That said, the judge rightfully chastised Cypress for abusing its
power. The Constitution's framers, Carter wrote, "might be surprised
to learn that the power of eminent domain was being used to turn the
property over to a private discount retail corporation." Cypress
clearly overstepped its authority and Costco shouldn't be asking
cities to do its bidding in the real estate market.</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately, the underlying issue that prompted the Cypress case
isn't unique.</TE>
<TE>   Sales-tax revenue tops the list when elected officials catalog the
strongest influences on land development. Whether it's the
controversial Costco in Cypress or the proposed Home Depot in San
Juan Capistrano, the same issue keeps surfacing: How do cities
balance revenue needs against the rights of landowners and nearby
residents?</TE>
<TE>   A bill wending its way through the state legislature won't help in
Orange County, but AB 680 would take a solid first step toward a
statewide solution.</TE>
<TE>   The bill would modify how local sales tax revenues are distributed
in the Sacramento area and start to chip away at the emphasis cities
now place on projects that will deliver sales tax revenue growth.</TE>
<TE>   So where does this leave Cypress and Cottonwood?</TE>
<TE>   In April we asked the city and church to continue negotiating
toward a possible land swap to give the city its prime corner lot and
shift Cottonwood to an adjacent property in the shadow of the Los
Alamitos Race Course. There is still time for the city and church to
go back to the table, and we encourage both sides to do so before the
case goes to trial.</TE>

<HD>Pumpkin Killing Is Sad Tale</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's a sad story, this tale of the pumpkin killing, without a single
redeeming quality or good guy.</LD>
<LD>   A group of teenagers somehow thinks it would be fun to drive
around otherwise peaceful suburban streets stealing Halloween
decorations from one neighbor after another. And an otherwise
peaceable suburbanite somehow thinks drawing a gun is a reasonable
response to thoughtless kids and their dumb mischief, grabbing a
plastic pumpkin off his lawn.</LD>
<LD>   Now two families' lives are in ruins. The family of Pete Tavita
Solomona has lost financial security, its home and for several years
its patriarch, who paid to defend himself against murder charges and
was sentenced to six years in prison for voluntary manslaughter.</LD>
<TE>   But at least the Solomona family will reunite one day. Brandon
Ketsdever's parents would probably give up money, house and a few
years to see their 17-year-old son again. That won't happen.</TE>
<TE>   After a hung jury and a tossed-out conviction, a third jury came
up with a verdict that fit the crime. The judge delivered an
appropriate sentence for a man who should have known that chasing
petty thieves with a gun was an outrageous and potentially fatal
decision, but who probably will never want to see a gun again in his
life.</TE>
<TE>   That would be a nice lesson for the rest of us too. For every
story of householders who have successfully defended themselves from
evil with a handgun, there's a matching story of the inadvertent or a
heat-of-the-moment shooting of a child, a neighbor, a spouse.</TE>
<TE>   Solomona deserved probation, not prison, his lawyer argued,
because he was using the gun only "to get attention, not in a
threatening manner." Once drawn, however, there is no nonthreatening
way to use a gun, no way to avoid the potential for deadly violence.</TE>
<TE>   If there are to be good guys for this story, they will have to be
the people who learn that a gun can be a terrifying item to have in a
home, especially a loaded gun easily accessible in times of outrage
or fear. They will be the parents who warn their kids that vandalism
and petty theft aren't just mean and dishonest, but deadly dangerous.
You never know when the person you enrage could have a far meaner and
more unlawful reaction.</TE>

<LD>As dubious as the information in campaign mailers might be, somebody
out there must be reading them. An awful lot of money and argument
goes into them each election season.</LD>
<LD>   The latest argument has been about slate mailers, which once were
just a list of recommended candidates and stands on ballot measures.
They most likely would purport to advise you how the
environmentalists or an anti-tax group wanted you to vote.</LD>
<LD>   Slate mailers, though, are evolving in a troubling way. A furor
erupted after a new subspecies of campaign literature reached
mailboxes during the race this year between incumbent Supervisor
Cynthia P. Coad and successful challenger Chris Norby. While sticking
to the state's rule that slate mailers must contain at least four
candidates or issues, the series of full-color foldouts--produced by
anti-airport consultants--devoted most of their space to criticizing
Coad and praising Norby, who won.</LD>
<TE>   Why should anyone care? Because Norby may have reaped the benefit
of an expensive mail campaign despite the county's strict limits on
contributions to candidates. He claims he paid his full share;
political observers doubt it. Also, the mailers didn't make it clear
who was paying for them--they don't have to.</TE>
<TE>   Donations to slate mailers are exempt from campaign-limit rules
because the money goes straight to the mailer organization, not to
the candidate's campaign. As an independent group, that organization
has a free-speech right to spend what it wants. But the mailer still
has to be counted as a gift if it was done with the candidate's
cooperation; certainly Norby's campaign was involved to some extent,
but the state is just now making its definitions of "cooperation"
clearer.</TE>
<TE>   Norby points out that slate mailers provide an affordable way for
cash-strapped candidates to get their names out by sharing costs.
Coad didn't worry about contribution limits because, as a wealthy
woman, she was able to loan about $500,000 to her own campaign.</TE>
<TE>   It may seem unfair, but campaign reform isn't about leveling the
playing field. It's about keeping special interests from having a
hold on our elected officials. Now that this use of slate mailers has
been pioneered, what's to keep it from being exploited by big
business to shift vast sums of money toward candidates in order to
skew decisions on major issues? It's easy to imagine city council
mailers put out by "Citizens for a Safe Beach," a group made up of
businesses worried that proposed rules to stem urban runoff will cost
them too much money.</TE>
<TE>   In response to the Norby foldouts, the county passed a policy
requiring candidates to pay their share of a slate mailer if more
than a fourth of the mailer is devoted to them.</TE>
<TE>   Well-intentioned as the county's move may be, its ultimate value
is debatable. It allows candidates to benefit from untold sums of
money through a blizzard of slate mailers that meet the "25% test,"
and voters still don't know who's behind them.</TE>
<TE>   The state can regulate this more effectively, and is already
working on proposed wording that makes slate mailers a gift if the
candidate is involved in any meaningful way. Meanwhile, the state's
efforts to make the mailers disclose their money sources upfront are
under legal attack. Until matters are resolved on both fronts, voters
can register their opinion of slate mailers by dropping them in the
recycling bin without so much as a glance.</TE>

<LD>Re "Mexican Supermarket Meets Obstacles in Anaheim," Aug. 5:</LD>
<LD>   There are six areas of redevelopment in Anaheim, one of which is
the Plaza area. This area thrives by a vehicle known as tax
increment--the payoff of bonds to revitalize and restore this once
blighted mall. City officials appropriately denied a company's
application for a market since most grocery items are tax exempt,
which would not allow redevelopment to pay off remaining debt before
the life of this project is complete.</LD>
<LD>   This agency has brought much good to our city. The owners should
submit an application that is more creative, providing the essential
ingredient, tax increment.</LD>

<HD>Controversy Is Airborne Once Again Over El Toro</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "2 Supervisors Propose a Fifth Ballot Measure on El Toro
Planning," Aug. 1:</LD>
<LD>   At this point, it comes as no surprise that supervisors Cynthia P.
Coad and Chuck Smith are still not convinced that the El Toro
International Airport idea is a bad idea and dead. After literally
having wasted millions of our tax dollars and displaying wanton
disrespect for the residents of Orange County, they supposedly wish
that we, the voters, should actually have a say in what goes on in
Orange County. We are not fooled.</LD>
<LD>   Their shameless arrogance and self-importance have no boundaries.
The Irvine plan, which substantially satisfies the mandate of Measure
W, is a wonderful solution for all of the residents of Orange County.
Further, the demonstrated planning genius of Irvine is widely
recognized. To Coad and Smith, we, the citizens of Orange County, say
let's move on and stop boring us with your meaningless, self-serving
and costly drivel.</LD>
<TE>   Hans J. Roehricht</TE>
<TE>   Lake Forest</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Many people are tired of the El Toro debate and just want it to go
away, including yours truly. But the underlying problem is that
airport demand will just not go away. It would sure be a fantastic
world if we could indefinitely keep the status quo of flights at Long
Beach and John Wayne airports. The catch is that the airline industry
and the Federal Aviation Administration will just not stand for it
and will sue.</TE>
<TE>   Look at what's happening. American Airlines has threatened to sue
for more slots at Long Beach if they are not granted by January 2003.
Last time there was a lawsuit (Alaska Airlines vs. city of Long
Beach), the flight caps increased from to 15 to 41 a day, or 173%. In
addition, there are two east-west runways that point at Cerritos and
Orange avenues. This would affect Cypress, Stanton, Anaheim and Buena
Park. As one can see, Long Beach is not just a Los Angeles County
issue.</TE>
<TE>   A little farther down the road is John Wayne Airport. Without a
reliever airport, doomsday will hit in 2006. No more caps, no more
curfews and no more noise-abatement procedures.</TE>
<TE>   Let's compare John Wayne to El Toro. For starters, John Wayne has
no fuel pipeline. Hundreds of fuel trucks will clog the freeways. The
San Diego, Costa Mesa and Corona del Mar freeways feed into John
Wayne. At El Toro, there are the San Diego and Laguna freeways,
Foothill toll road and Interstate 5, with more lanes and a train
station.</TE>
<TE>   At El Toro, there are no homes within two miles, and flights could
be routed over open spaces.</TE>
<TE>   Which brings me to my next point. Please consider the V Plan. The
current airport plan of approaches from the south and eastern
takeoffs only gives South County justification to spend millions and
fight back.</TE>
<TE>   I have to be totally honest. If I lived somewhere like Aliso
Viejo, I'd fight it too.</TE>
<TE>   When the jets are out of sight, out of mind, then people will be
happy. Also, the V-Plan has the blessing of the pilots unions.</TE>
<TE>   This can be a win-win for all. No more hassle with LAX, no trips
to Inland Empire airports. And best of all, nobody in the county has
to get hurt and lose a home. If our county chooses to hit the snooze
button now, we will have a rude wake-up call in 2006 or sooner. The
locals had better have a solution, or Washington, D.C., will have
one, and it won't be pretty.</TE>
<TE>   Rex Ricks</TE>
<TE>   Huntington Beach</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Yet another attempt by pro-airport county supervisors to test the
will of the people.</TE>
<TE>   After eight years of acrimony and more than $50 million of county
tax dollars wasted promoting an airport, the voters have been heard
loud and clear by the Navy. No airport at El Toro.</TE>
<TE>   Measure W comes along and Irvine comes up with a mutually
acceptable plan that satisfies the Navy and the voters. Yet, two
disgruntled supervisors, Smith and Coad, push to have another vote,
claiming Irvine has too much control over county property.</TE>
<TE>   Derek Quinn</TE>
<TE>   Laguna Niguel</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   After reading the Letters to the Editor in Sunday's Times, it
appears that the "Great Park" supporters continue to deal in innuendo
and half-truths.</TE>
<TE>   For example, M. Smith writes that airport supporters "want to
triple Orange County air travel," a curious statement since the
demand for air travel is coming from continued population expansion
in South County.</TE>
<TE>   I suppose that the increase in air travel from the thousands of
homes to be built where the Great Park was to have been will be due
to airport supporters.</TE>
<TE>   What happens when Rancho Mission Viejo builds thousands of homes
on its 12,000 acres? Guess what will happen when the developers start
in on the airport buffer zone and proceed to build high-density
housing as they have been doing in Irvine?</TE>
<TE>   D. Blodgett claims that 600,000 residents of Orange County (read
South County) would have their quality of life destroyed by an
airport at El Toro.</TE>
<TE>   He conveniently ignores the other 2.3 million residents of Orange
County who will be seriously affected if Orange County will not pick
up its fair share of air travel. Increased traffic will cause noise,
pollution and more time on the road.</TE>
<TE>   Like it or not, Orange County is part of Southern California,
including cities from San Diego to Santa Barbara, all of which
require air transportation. An air system is integral and vital to
compete with rest of the world.</TE>
<TE>   It would be lovely if we could shut out the rest of the world and
bask in the quiet serenity of this bucolic land. Unfortunately, we
are at the center of a rapidly growing population.</TE>
<TE>   The builders and developers have great plans for filling up South
County with as many profitable houses and commercial developments as
they can. Keeping the large open spaces of El Toro, even with an
airport, would be less disruptive of community living than the
planned development.</TE>
<TE>   It is about time citizens take control of the development activity
to manage growth rather than stop it.</TE>
<TE>   William Kearns</TE>
<TE>   Costa Mesa</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Supervisor Smith is truly a political dinosaur. In his latest
attack of "concern for the voters," Smith proposed yet another
election on El Toro, this time to see if county residents want to
approve the Navy-Irvine development plan. Mr. Smith, this sounds
exactly like the ballot-box planning imposed by Measure F and so
bitterly opposed by the pro-airport troika. Having completely ignored
the voters for the last eight years, why the sudden concern?</TE>
<TE>   I have one simple question for Smith and his cohorts: El Toro is
still unincorporated land and Measure W is county law.</TE>
<TE>   If Smith is so concerned about protecting the voters, where is the
county's plan for the Great Park? It's apparently as nonexistent as
the credibility of the Board of Supervisors.</TE>
<TE>   Richard Soden</TE>
<TE>   Lake Forest</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I applaud Supervisor Smith for proposing that another measure be
placed on the ballot so that the public can decide how to reuse El
Toro property. We do need another opportunity to vote on the issue,
considering the recent explosive developments.</TE>
<TE>   Measure W promised a grandiose park, but after all this time,
there is no plan on how to finance it without an excessive new tax
for Orange County citizens.</TE>
<TE>   The toxic-waste cleanup remains a major issue if the land is not
an airport.</TE>
<TE>   Most important, we now learn some of the land will not be park,
but homes and businesses. Instead of allowing projects that will
worsen our air and ground transportation problems, we need an airport
that will solve them. Part of that El Toro property must be set aside
for an airport, and the rest used for parks, museums and recreation
purposes. We now have more information to help us make a decision for
our future, so let's vote again.</TE>

<LD>Your Aug. 6 article "State, U.S. Feud Over Teachers" states that
"Gov. Gray Davis and lawmakers have made teacher recruitment and
retention a priority...."</LD>
<LD>   This is true in oratory and fanfare, but not in practice. One
example is the Governor's Teaching Fellowship Program.</LD>
<LD>   The program was announced nine months ago with much publicity and
press coverage. The governor hailed it as a solution to the teacher
shortage in California and a way to get qualified teachers directly
into the areas where the need was the greatest. Posters are still
evident at schools and universities throughout the state.</LD>
<TE>   However, very quietly, the program was removed from the governor's
final budget before it went to the Legislature.</TE>

<LD>Re "Mothers Push Fight Against Gun Violence," Aug. 5:</LD>
<LD>   I am responding to an article by Karima Haynes, "Three Years After
Valley Jewish Center Shooting, the Million Mom March Presses On." I
am outraged by Kelly Whitley's comment about the Million Mom March
not having credibility on gun safety.</LD>
<LD>   Any implication that the National Rifle Assn. stands for and
promotes gun safety is a sad joke and oxymoron. They spout off about
their silly cartoon eagle (Eddie Eagle) who says not to touch a gun
and go get a parent if a gun is found.</LD>
<TE>   This has absolutely no impact with children. By nature, children
are inquisitive. Prime Time with Diane Sawyer did a show proving that
these shallow words go in and out of a child's ear without
resonating. In a test group, immediately after watching a video of
Eddie Eagle, young children were shown playing with a gun (the gun
was empty, of course).</TE>
<TE>   Bottom line: Shallow words and cartoons don't work. Action and
prevention does. The NRA needs to wake up.</TE>
<TE>   Thom Balding</TE>
<TE>   Santa Ana</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The NRA spokesperson who tries to belittle Million Mom March's
efforts is simply missing the target.</TE>
<TE>   From Day One, our motto has been and continues to be Sensible Gun
Laws--Safe Kids. Last year, Million Mom March was a sponsor of Senate
Bill 52, for handgun safety licensing, which passed our Legislature
and was signed into law.</TE>
<TE>   Beginning in 2003, would-be handgun purchasers must demonstrate a
working knowledge of the handgun they are about to buy with a
hands-on demonstration before a certified safety instructor. There
will be a more comprehensive written test, plus a requirement of
thumb printing to verify the buyer's identity to eliminate illegal
sales and close a loophole regarding the residency requirement here
in California.</TE>
<TE>   This also will assist law enforcement in criminal apprehension and
in attacking illegal secondary gun sales.</TE>

<HD>Housing vs. Open Space in Rancho Mission Viejo</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Regarding your July 31 article "Planning Simmers in 'Hot Spot' for
Species," I want to add a couple of key points that seem to get
forgotten by those most eager to see this development proceed at any
cost.</LD>
<LD>   More than a decade ago, the landowners of Rancho Mission Viejo
agreed to participate in the Natural Communities Conservation
Planning process before they submitted plans to develop the ranch.
But in the mid-1990s, they obtained approval to build more than 8,000
homes on Ladera Ranch (part of Rancho Mission Viejo) without going
through the NCCP process as they had originally agreed to do.</LD>
<LD>   Once again, the owners of Rancho Mission Viejo are hoping to avoid
the NCCP process by submitting a 14,000-unit development plan for the
rest of the ranch to the county for processing, without going through
the NCCP process.</LD>
<TE>   Thanks to the watchful eyes of an alert public and particularly to
Supervisor Tom Wilson, this plan has been tabled while the
undeveloped portions of Rancho Mission Viejo go through the NCCP
process and Wilson's South County Outreach and Review Effort.</TE>
<TE>   The goal is to retain land for development while preserving the
most environmentally sensitive, "hot spot" areas, the very heart and
soul of Orange County. We all need to support these prudent
approaches to planning and encourage the government officials
responsible for the NCCP and Supervisor Wilson and his SCORE process
to stay the course.</TE>
<TE>   Everyone can win with this approach. Development can occur to
provide the landowner his due profit, while preserving sufficient
habitat area to make sure that our children and future generations
will still be able to see animals in the wild and not just at zoos.</TE>
<TE>   Shirley Grindle</TE>
<TE>   Orange</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Thank you for recognizing the unique opportunity we all have to
achieve a win-win solution for the future of the 23,000-acre Rancho
Mission Viejo. This is truly a test case for the planning process for
this special land and one we cannot afford to miss.</TE>
<TE>   Natural Communities Conservation Planning is a process recognized
by many experts as the best way to balance economic and environmental
needs. It's a process designed by former Gov. Pete Wilson and agreed
to by both the Rancho Mission Viejo landowners and Orange County a
decade ago.</TE>
<TE>   The very fate of the "heart and soul" of South County, Rancho
Mission Viejo, is at stake with this important planning process. Also
at stake is the quality of life we want to pass on to our children
and all future generations.</TE>
<TE>   We are committed to working together in a collaborative approach
with the community and the Rancho Mission Viejo landowners to achieve
a win-win solution that will retain land for development while
preserving the most environmentally sensitive areas that were
mentioned in your article and have been identified by experts.</TE>
<TE>   Furthermore, we are committed to working with the landowner on a
solution that will be a tip of the hat to the long-standing ranching
lifestyle and the land stewardship we understand are so important to
the landowner.</TE>
<TE>   We recognize the value of this special land and the contribution
the landowner has made to this land's history, scenic landscapes and
natural resources, clean air and clean water, and quality of life for
South County residents.</TE>
<TE>   And that's why we should settle for nothing less than an outcome
that would uphold these values for our region.</TE>
<TE>   We also applaud county Supervisor Wilson and his SCORE process for
ensuring that planning for this important land is based on community
and scientific input. We support Wilson's bold commitment as should
all South County residents and encourage the Rancho Mission Viejo
landowners to join with us to make preservation of the most important
portions of this special land a reality.</TE>
<TE>   Dan Silver</TE>
<TE>   Endangered Habitats League</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   While there is substantial evidence pointing to Rancho Mission
Viejo as an important component of a globally significant biological
"hot spot," one need not consider this as the sole reason to call for
maximum preservation.</TE>
<TE>   Simply drive the Ortega Highway or Antonio Parkway and look at the
magnificent open space that is still largely intact.</TE>
<TE>   Then make the connection between that open space and the quality
of life we enjoy in Orange County.</TE>
<TE>   If that land ever becomes the resting place for a sea of red-tiled
roofs or scattered ranchettes and "hidden" developments, make no
mistake, Orange County will no longer be a fine place to live.</TE>
<TE>   We already have serious traffic and air- and water-quality
problems to tackle due to previous development. Would another 14,000
homes peppering Orange County's "last frontier" help solve these
problems?</TE>
<TE>   Of course not. So what is there to do? At the moment, the NCCP
process offers an approach to planning that has potential for
success. It is a difficult process, but it is one that could help
identify the important areas to preserve first, then plan appropriate
development elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   And Supervisor Wilson should be congratulated for taking planning
to the next logical step: his SCORE process.</TE>
<TE>   As a veteran of more than a decade of Orange County land-use
planning (not the least of which involved other Rancho Mission Viejo
developments) and one very familiar with the disastrous results
caused by ill-advised, piecemeal development, I am encouraged by
Rancho Mission Viejo's desire to plan the remaining ranch and
participate in the NCCP process.</TE>
<TE>   As long as we all recognize that large areas of open space are
essential to preserving both unique biological resources and quality
of life and that development impacts are not contained by the
boundary of the developer's land, we will have the basis for a
successful outcome.</TE>

<TE>   It seems that NCCP provides assurances for developers but few for
endangered species. The current Rancho Mission Viejo proposal is
unacceptable and will not provide the protection that the sensitive
natural communities need. It's unfortunate that Rancho Mission Viejo
Vice President Richard Broming is dismissing scientific data as
environmental propaganda. Tell that to the many experts who endorse
the Conservation Biology Institute's study on Rancho Mission Viejo.
South County, indeed coastal Southern California, is a global
extinction "hot spot," and Rancho Mission Viejo is at the heart of
it.</TE>

<LD>Re "Ballad of the Poor Samaritan," Aug. 2:</LD>
<LD>   Thank you for printing this article on the front page. I was
planning to cancel my subscription to The Times because I was fed up
with all the bad news. It's nice to read a positive story of someone
with integrity for a change. What a contrast to the picture (also on
the front page) of the former CFO of WorldCom being taken into
custody in handcuffs.</LD>
<LD>   For a man who had everything material, Scott Sullivan could learn
a lesson from Ascension Franco Gonzales, a poor immigrant who works
10 hour days as a dishwasher and sends most of his money to his
mother in Mexico so that she can live in a modest home.</LD>
<TE>   It is a sad commentary on our society that so many people believed
that Ascension was dumb to return the money. He did what was right
and honest and should be praised. He represents the type of integrity
that there needs to be more of in the world today.</TE>
<TE>   Please print more stories of honesty, integrity and kindness.</TE>

<LD>Re "College District Seeks Bonds, Another Might," July 31:</LD>
<LD>   Please support the funding measures asked by Rancho Santiago and
Coast Community College districts. I have studied at four campuses to
meet state requirements to get a teaching credential. After 30 years
in the business world, all I remembered was a '60s expression, "High
school with ashtrays." What I found was far different.</LD>
<LD>   I found dedicated and inspiring educators. I found students of all
ages who are learning for the sake of knowledge and studying to
improve their futures. And the cost is almost nothing. The biggest
burden for community college students is books. Tuition (and parking)
are bargains in Southern California. Furthermore, our Cal State
system (I'm at Fullerton) accepts all accredited courses from the
two-year system.</LD>
<TE>   Go to the nearest community college and attend a class. You will
see how much these schools add to our lives and communities.</TE>

<HD>2 Sides of Rent Increases for Mobile Home Parks</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Bid to Increase Mobile Homes' Rent Threatens Retiree Havens,"
July 31:</LD>
<LD>   The Golden State Manufactured Home Owners League has been working
on mobile-home space rents for years and has made some progress on
this issue. We have a legislative representative in Sacramento to
keep track of mobile home laws and work with legislative committees
on them.</LD>
<LD>   The author of this article should write a follow-up article on
this important issue and get the views of key legislators plus the
residents of other parks.</LD>
<TE>   This problem is statewide, not just the central coast. California
has more than 5,000 mobile home parks, and the rising rents are a
problem from Oregon to the Mexican border, from the sea to the
Arizona-Nevada border.</TE>
<TE>   With the rising cost of housing and stock losses, increasing
health-care costs and so forth, mobile homes often are a last resort
for low-income housing. Seniors are being priced out of this market.</TE>
<TE>   Milt Burdick</TE>
<TE>   Vice President,</TE>
<TE>   Golden State Manufactured</TE>
<TE>   Home Owners League Zone C</TE>
<TE>   Brea</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Mobile home owners are tenants who rent land within a park that
provides them a lot for their home. Along with the lot come amenities
and services. The mobile home park, the landowner, provides and
maintains the streets, utilities, common-area landscaping and
recreation facilities, including clubhouses, pools, Jacuzzi and
on-site management. In other words, along with renting, mobile home
owners receive a tremendous amount of services.</TE>
<TE>   Mobile home owners own a depreciating asset--just like an
automobile, motor home or, for that matter, any structure.</TE>
<TE>   It is not the mobile home or the structure built on a lot that
appreciates. It is the land that appreciates. It is the owner of the
land who holds the valuable and appreciating asset.</TE>
<TE>   If mobile home owners went out to buy a single-family residential
lot for their manufactured home in San Juan Capistrano, they would
have to pay $200,000 or more for the lot alone.</TE>
<TE>   And, after they put their home on the lot, they would have to
provide and pay for all of the amenities and services they would need
to live on the lot.</TE>
<TE>   Shame on those who believe that the owner of the land is not
entitled to receive a fair-market rent based on the value of the
land. Those who live in mobile homes live on land that is valued far
in excess of what he or she is paying for it because of rent control.</TE>

<LD>Re "O.C. Leads Nation in Beach Closures, Up 81% Last Year," July 25:</LD>
<LD>   As the population in California grows, so does the waste, and it
has nowhere to go. When Orange County has the most beach closures,
what is a county to do?</LD>
<LD>   Some solutions are more funding to clean up the beaches. Pipes
that lead the sewage deep out into the ocean are leaking and letting
all the waste products out at the shore. I also agree that regional
legislation is a good idea, rather than regulating beaches and
setting rules according to each beach's needs.</LD>
<TE>   Regulations should require businesses to treat their waste with
more care.</TE>
<TE>   Another solution is to direct more funds to the Environmental
Protection Agency, which will fight excessive pollution and unwanted
waste.</TE>

<HD>John C. Argue, 70; Key Figure in 1984 Olympics</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ALAN ABRAHAMSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>John C. Argue, a leading civic figure who was instrumental in
bringing the 1984 Olympic Games to Los Angeles and in the nearly two
decades since played a key role in boosting the success of a wide
variety of business, community, educational and philanthropic
endeavors, died Saturday. He was 70.</LD>
<LD>   Argue, who had been diagnosed earlier this year with leukemia,
died at Huntington Memorial Hospital in Pasadena.</LD>
<LD>   In recent years, Argue had been chairman of the USC board of
trustees; of the Rose Hills Foundation, which contributes to worthy
causes in the San Gabriel Valley; and of the Amateur Athletic
Foundation, the organization created to grow and give away to youth
sports in Southern California and elsewhere the surplus from the 1984
Games.</LD>
<TE>   As but one measure of Argue's keen financial acumen, the Amateur
Athletic Foundation--which started with a principal fund of $93.5
million--has given away more than $130 million even as its principal
has grown to $140 million.</TE>
<TE>   "With his passing, we have lost a civic treasure," said Anita
DeFrantz, president of the athletic foundation and a longtime member
of the International Olympic Committee. "And I have lost a friend and
mentor."</TE>
<TE>   She added, "He constantly reminded us that we needed 'to put bats
and balls in the hands of kids.' That was his phrase."</TE>
<TE>   Trained as a lawyer, Argue was known and respected by many for his
leadership abilities, for nerves of steel and for being thoroughly
self-effacing about credit for good deeds done. He was a straight
talker. He could--and gladly would--tell stories about how good life
could be in Southern California, where he was born and raised, and
about the Olympics, which were a lifelong passion.</TE>
<TE>   Argue was deeply passionate as well about USC, and loved at any
turn to promote the university and talk up the football team.</TE>
<TE>   He was known to wear a suit and a short-sleeved business shirt to
work each and every weekday morning--never long sleeves. "He wasn't
much for casual Friday," said Connie Gray, his assistant for nearly
two decades.</TE>
<TE>   He also was in the habit of writing notes--sometimes critical,
more often full of praise--to friends, acquaintances, newspaper
reporters, anybody he darned well felt ought to hear from him.</TE>
<TE>   USC President Steven Sample on Saturday described Argue as
"extraordinary" and a "community builder."</TE>
<TE>   "He never took the credit publicly," Sample said. "It was
absolutely unimportant to him who got credit. I don't care whether
you're talking about the Olympics, the city, the university; John was
working tirelessly and very effectively to get the thing done, bring
people together and never wanted any credit.</TE>
<TE>   "It's that kind of leader, that kind of person, who makes a
difference in a city like L.A. You need hundreds and hundreds of John
Argues who are tough, right, tenacious and absolutely disdainful of
trying to make sure they themselves get the glory and the credit."</TE>
<TE>   Peter Ueberroth, who ran the 1984 Olympic Games, said of Argue:
"The overwhelming thing is, he's one of these rare individuals that
comes along once in a generation that has the ability to make every
person or institution that he touches better for knowing him.</TE>
<TE>   "From somebody he just had a casual friendship or acquaintanceship
with, to those at USC, anybody that spent any time with him walked
away from the experience a better person. He would give of his
knowledge. Like anybody who was a real leader, he will be missed. He
was very special."</TE>
<TE>   Gray, his assistant, added, "In my opinion John Argue was the
nicest person in town. I couldn't have had a nicer boss. He did so
much. And all we did was have fun."</TE>
<TE>   Argue was born on Jan. 25, 1932, in Glendale. He went to
Occidental College, graduating in 1953, and to USC law school,
earning his law degree in 1956.</TE>
<TE>   He practiced law for many years, first with his father, J.
Clifford Argue--a 1930 USC law graduate--and with other firms.</TE>
<TE>   J. Clifford Argue competed in the pentathlon in the 1924 Paris
Games, and his Olympic diploma hung in the house when his son was
growing up. John C. Argue was born just months before the Games were
held in Los Angeles for the first time, and so the Olympics were a
part of his life from birth; for much of his adult life, he sought to
bring the Games to L.A. again.</TE>
<TE>   He succeeded after years and years of trying, in 1978, when the
International Olympic Committee awarded the 1984 Games to L.A. Those
Games were a spectacular success, and in 1994 the IOC honored him
with the Olympic Order, its highest award.</TE>
<TE>   In recent years, John Argue had once again been trying to land the
Games for Los Angeles, chairing a campaign seeking the 2012 Olympics.
The U.S. Olympic Committee decided last year that other cities would
get a chance. Argue was undeterred, saying L.A. would simply have to
bid again for the Games in 2016.</TE>
<TE>   Argue had been chairman of the Amateur Athletic Foundation since
1995.</TE>
<TE>   A member of the USC board of trustees since 1984, Argue was
serving a five-year term as board chairman, the first alumnus to be
chairman in 20 years. His two children and a sister are also USC
alumni.</TE>
<TE>   "I believe, and you might quarrel with this," Sample said, "his
heart ultimately was as a Trojan. I think in some ways this
chairmanship of the USC board of trustees, in his mind, was the
epitome of his leadership career. He loved being a chairman. And,
boy, did he work hard. He was always available."</TE>
<TE>   Argue is survived by his wife of 39 years, Liz; two children,
Elizabeth "Betsy" Argue Pollon and John M. Argue; and four
grandchildren.</TE>
<TE>   Funeral arrangements were incomplete.</TE>

<HD>Ringing True at New Campus</HD>
<DH>Camarillo: Landmark bell tower at Cal State Channel Islands
will finally make music thanks to a Ventura County family.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>FRED ALVAREZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It is the symbol of Cal State Channel Islands, a Mission-style bell
tower standing at the heart of the Camarillo campus and crowned with
a turreted dome. Its likeness is stamped on everything important to
the new university, from its logo to its first course catalog.</LD>
<LD>   But the sun-bleached structure has never made a sound. It has been
a bell tower without a bell, rising five stories but shrouded in
silence for more than 70 years. Now that is about to change.</LD>
<LD>   With a $15,000 donation from a prominent Ventura County ranch
family, the muted campanile is finally getting a voice to match its
presence.</LD>
<TE>   Last week, engineers installed a high-tech carillon system in the
1930s-era tower, an electronically amplified network of hand-tuned
miniature bells that will be able to chime the hour, ring in the
start of classes or simply flood the sprawling campus with glorious
sound.</TE>
<TE>   The bell system will be unveiled Friday at the university's grand
opening and will provide a steady heartbeat for campus life when the
school opens to students in two weeks at the former Camarillo State
Hospital complex.</TE>
<TE>   "We thought that was exactly what was needed at Channel Islands to
give it that campus atmosphere," said Carolyn Leavens, a longtime
university supporter whose extended ranch family provided the melodic
gift.</TE>
<TE>   The names of the senior family members--Leavens' husband, Paul,
and his sisters, Mary Leavens Schwabauer, Dorothy Leavens Carlson and
Sarah Leavens Gilmour--will be emblazoned on a plaque at the foot of
the bell tower.</TE>
<TE>   "It's just such a great ambience builder," said Leslie
Leavens-Crowe, a partner in the ranch business and the daughter of
Paul and Carolyn Leavens. "It's such a unique opportunity and our
family is so pleased to be a part of it."</TE>
<TE>   Channel Islands is tapping a tradition that dates back hundreds of
years at some of America's oldest universities. In many places, the
bell tower is a focus of campus life. The Campanile at UC Berkeley
has been a landmark since 1914. The structure, nearly as tall as
London's Big Ben and visible from the Golden Gate Bridge, is a
gathering place for students lamenting the approach of final exams or
gearing up for the big game, Cal's annual football match-up with
rival Stanford.</TE>
<TE>   Several Cal State campuses also have bell-ringing traditions.
Sonoma State has a three-story clock tower, and at San Diego State
there is a 150-foot campanile, a former water tower converted nearly
60 years ago into the home of a 100-bell symphony.</TE>
<TE>   The idea to wire Cal State Channel Islands' tower for sound came
to university supporters a couple of months ago, during a planning
meeting for the opening event.</TE>
<TE>   The meeting was held on the quad in the shadow of the tower, built
in the 1930s along with the rest of the state hospital as part of the
New Deal's Works Progress Administration program.</TE>
<TE>   "We just thought here's this visual icon, the central hub of the
university, and up to now it hasn't been able to mark time, make
announcements or call the university family together," said Alma
Gonzalez, vice president for university advancement. "Basically what
we wanted to be able to do is bring life to this historic structure."</TE>
<TE>   After researching various systems and their costs, university
officials set out to look for money. They didn't have to look any
further than the Leavens family, which has been farming in Ventura
County for half a century.</TE>
<TE>   The family's donation covered the cost of purchasing and
installing the bell system and a $2,000 endowment for maintenance.</TE>
<TE>   "Without the help of people like the Leavenses, we wouldn't be
where we are today," said Pat Richards, chairwoman of the
university's fund-raising foundation.</TE>
<TE>   The sound system was manufactured by Maas-Rowe Carillons Inc., an
Escondido-based company that got its start in Los Angeles in 1922
building pipe organs and cathedral chimes.</TE>
<TE>   The company has installed its systems in thousands of churches,
city halls and colleges--including UCLA, USC and Pepperdine
University.</TE>
<TE>   The Channel Islands system uses 15 miniature bells, about 3 feet
long and the size of chimes in a grandfather clock. The bells are
struck by electronic impulses, and the tones they generate are
amplified millions of times to simulate the sound of larger bells.</TE>
<TE>   The system also comes with a 25-disc CD player, which will play
hymns or other music recorded from a 246-bell carillon at the
company's Escondido studio.</TE>
<TE>   One of the recorded songs will be Cal State Channel Islands' alma
mater, penned by Ted Lucas, executive assistant to the university
president. Lucas, who has a doctorate in music from the University of
Illinois, said he was honored to be asked to write the song and is
looking forward to hearing it ring out for the first time on Friday.</TE>
<TE>   "It makes it feel like a real university by having a carillon in
place," Lucas said.</TE>
<TE>   The Leavens family thinks so, too.</TE>
<TE>   Carolyn and Paul Leavens attended their 50th class reunion this
summer at Whitworth College in Spokane, Wash., and were moved as they
listened to the tones floating from the campus campanile. They talked
then about how nice it would be if the bell tower at Cal State
Channel Islands could set the same mood.</TE>
<TE>   Little did they know that plans were being laid at that time to
make it happen or that they would be asked to play a key part.</TE>
<TE>   "I am really thrilled that the family name will be at the campus
in perpetuity," Carolyn Leavens said. "It is a lovely opportunity to
be a permanent part of that wonderful university."</TE>

<LD>Four firefighters suffered minor injuries Saturday after being
exposed to toxic fumes while they were extinguishing a blaze outside
a commercial structure in Chatsworth, a fire spokesman said.</LD>
<LD>   "They were treated for dizziness and eye irritation, but they were
all released in good condition," said Jim Wells of the Los Angeles
Fire Department.</LD>
<LD>   About 125 firefighters fought the fire, which apparently began
when several barrels containing flammable liquid ignited, Wells said.</LD>
<TE>   The injured firefighters were treated at the scene at 9800 N.
Deering Ave. in Chatsworth. The fire was reported at 2:51 p.m. and
extinguished at 3:27 p.m., Wells said.</TE>

<HD>Voting Time on Shorter Light Rail?</HD>
<DH>Commuting: Irvine councilmen want colleagues' OK to shrink
the route to 12 miles, perhaps saving the project politically.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAN WEIKEL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>CenterLine was once envisioned as a key transportation chute through
the heart of Orange County--a street-level commuter train that would
run 28 miles and speed riders to Disneyland, Edison Field, South
Coast Plaza, even UC Irvine.</LD>
<LD>   Now, light-rail advocates appear willing to settle for
less--almost 16 miles less--to get the project built.</LD>
<LD>   If Irvine Mayor Larry Agran and Councilman Mike Ward have their
way at Tuesday's City Council meeting, CenterLine will be reduced to
a 12-mile, three-city system that would go from downtown Santa Ana to
Irvine City Hall. It would be the second time in two years that the
project has been scaled back, and the surviving route would no longer
reach many of the high-demand destinations the original architects of
CenterLine had in mind.</LD>
<TE>   "Opposition can shape a project," said county Supervisor Todd
Spitzer, who is also chairman of the Orange County Transportation
Authority. "What we are going through is not any different than other
light-rail projects around the country."</TE>
<TE>   In early 2001, Arthur Leahy, OCTA's chief executive officer,
shelved the 28-mile version of CenterLine because of neighborhood and
political opposition to the suggested route. As originally planned,
the line would have run from downtown Fullerton to the Irvine
Transportation Center.</TE>
<TE>   Eighteen miles of the project were resurrected late last year
after OCTA forged a coalition with city councils in Irvine, Costa
Mesa and Santa Ana. Preliminary engineering studies are underway.</TE>
<TE>   The latest Irvine proposal would cut six miles from the 18-mile
route and remove stops at the Irvine Spectrum commercial complex and
the Irvine Transportation Center, a major transit hub. South Coast
Plaza, the Irvine Business Complex and the Santa Ana Civic Center
would remain destinations.</TE>
<TE>   Agran and Ward want to eliminate the route through or near several
Irvine neighborhoods, such as Woodbridge and Oak Creek, where
residents have been staunch CenterLine opponents.</TE>
<TE>   Woodbridge, for example, has about 9,000 dwellings and 30,000
residents. The seven-member board of its neighborhood association has
unanimously opposed the light-rail system.</TE>
<TE>   Supporters of the Irvine proposal say it is necessary to make
light rail more politically palatable for county residents and to
neutralize opponents who think the project is a $1.4-billion
boondoggle.</TE>
<TE>   If the scaled-back system is built, light-rail advocates predict,
CenterLine will work so well that many cities and neighborhoods, even
the stubbornly resistant, will clamor to become part of the network.</TE>
<TE>   The latest proposal "will defuse some of the opposition and take
the alignment to where it is needed and wanted," Agran said. "Once
people see and touch CenterLine, the next fight will be a fight to be
included."</TE>
<TE>   County transportation officials say solid political support is
critical for the project and for OCTA's ability to secure hundreds of
millions of dollars in federal transportation funds.</TE>
<TE>   Critics contend that the scaled-back proposal is entirely
political, designed in part to improve support for Agran and
candidates he supports in the November city election. Agran denies
that the change is an election ploy.</TE>
<TE>   Eliminating some Irvine neighborhoods from the CenterLine route,
opponents say, will not thwart their efforts. If anything, they say,
they are emboldened in their drive to kill the project in Irvine with
a citywide ballot initiative. The measure, now undergoing a review by
city officials, might be ready for unveiling at the City Council
meeting Tuesday night.</TE>
<TE>   CenterLine opponents hope to gather enough signatures to qualify
the measure for a special election expected to be called in February
or March to fill Supervisor Spitzer's seat. Spitzer is likely to win
a state Assembly post.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think people believe they will be protected by this
change" to a 12-mile route, said John Kleinpeter, an anti-CenterLine
activist. "It's only a matter of time before they will expand the
line to the Spectrum. Eventually, it will have to go through
residential neighborhoods."</TE>
<TE>   Irvine city officials say they would like to build the line to the
Irvine Transportation Center at a later date along another route. It
would head north from the Civic Center to the Tustin train station,
then proceed along the Metrolink right of way to the transit complex.</TE>
<TE>   Agran said such an alignment would have trains passing through
residential neighborhoods already accustomed to such traffic. But
CenterLine opponents say those areas might not tolerate more rail
service.</TE>
<TE>   "This is an immensely unpopular project in Irvine," said
Councilman Greg Smith, who opposes CenterLine. "Doing it in bits and
pieces is less painful politically. Once the initial project is on
the ground, they will want to spend more money to expand it and
protect their investment."</TE>
<TE>   Activists who oppose CenterLine have broader concerns that light
rail is one of the most expensive and least efficient forms of public
transportation in a sprawling, suburban setting such as Orange
County. Buses, they say, are a better option because they are much
cheaper, more flexible in scheduling and, in total, carry far more
passengers.</TE>
<TE>   Nationally, many light-rail systems have been fraught with cost
overruns and less-than-projected ridership. Studies show the systems
have contributed little to reducing air pollution and traffic
congestion.</TE>
<TE>   "Most of the same people who take buses end up taking rail. People
don't get to work any quicker, and existing bus service would serve
rail riders better," said professor Mike McNally of UCI's Institute
of Transportation Studies. "If you are going to spend $1 billion,
there are better ways to spend it than for light rail."</TE>
<TE>   CenterLine advocates say the nation needs to break its dependence
on motor vehicles. They say air pollution must be cut, land is
limited for city highways, rail is safer, and rush-hour road
congestion will worsen.</TE>
<TE>   "You need a diversified transportation system," Agran said. "We
spend billions of dollars every year on freeways jammed with traffic.
There is only so much of the county we can pave over. If we don't get
serious and deal with our mobility problems, we will be choking on
our own exhaust fumes."</TE>
<TE>   Agran contends there is council support to approve the shortening
of CenterLine, but some on the OCTA Board of Directors say some
serious issues must be resolved before they will go along with the
idea.</TE>
<TE>   Four board members on the agency's planning committee have
signaled Irvine city officials about their concerns and proposed
sending a formal letter to the Irvine City Council.</TE>
<TE>   They say they worry about greater traffic around the Irvine Civic
Center, the inability to have a maintenance yard at the closed El
Toro Marine Corps Air Station, and the money OCTA would have to spend
for bus service and transit improvements at the City Hall stop.</TE>
<TE>   The agency wants the project to reflect community input from
advocates and critics, said Leahy, who partly blames the failure of
the 28-mile plan on OCTA's unwillingness to compromise with critics.</TE>
<TE>   Although the board members have concerns about the Irvine
proposal, Leahy praised the idea as a way to remove a bloc of
opposition to CenterLine and reduce the cost of the project's first
phase. He said, though, that before the project is built, it "has to
make good economic and transportation sense."</TE>

<HD>Landing on a Wing and Answered Prayer</HD>
<DH>Aviation: Experimental aircraft has a rough flight, but
pilot and passenger are unhurt.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Shayna Gove did not think she would end up praying for her life when
she agreed to accompany her uncle, Matthew Arns, in his two-seat
experimental airplane for a Saturday sightseeing flight over Orange
County.</LD>
<LD>   But that's all she could do when Arns, who lives in Irvine, said:
"We have a problem, I think."</LD>
<LD>   Gove, 20, of Westminster, remained quiet, allowing her uncle to
concentrate on the emergency landing, while she silently prayed:
"God, please land this plane!"</LD>
<TE>   Her prayers were answered.</TE>
<TE>   After bouncing across a dirt road by a motocross park and hitting
a small post near the shore of Irvine Lake, the single-engine plane
finally came to rest at water's edge.</TE>
<TE>   Both Gove and Arns walked away from the Space Walker II, a $25,000
kit plane Arns put together and has flown for five years.</TE>
<TE>   After taking off from the Chino airport, they had been aloft about
20 minutes when Gove heard the plane's engine sputtering. Arns was
piloting from the rear seat and struggled to gain altitude, but the
engine would not respond.</TE>
<TE>   "I figured we'd be OK. There just wasn't room to land it in that
place," Arns said afterward.</TE>
<TE>   The dirt road was not long enough to allow the plane to come to a
smooth stop, and they ended up with half the airplane, nose-first, in
the water, its left wing damaged.</TE>
<TE>   Arns helped his niece out of the plane.</TE>
<TE>   Aside from a bruised knee and the momentary shock of the forced
landing, she was unhurt.</TE>
<TE>   This was the first time Arns has made an emergency landing. He
said it wouldn't discourage him from experimental airplanes.</TE>
<TE>   Although still somewhat shaken by the accident some hours later,
Arns said he was confident he had made the right decision at a
critical time to land near the shore of Lake Irvine.</TE>
<TE>   "We were going to have to put it down someplace," said Arns, who
has been piloting airplanes for recreation for 25 years.</TE>

<HD>Farm Workers Urge Davis to Sign Binding Arbitration Bill</HD>
<DH>Labor: First-of-its-kind law could force growers into pacts
with pickers, angry at string of failed talks. Owners fear for family
operations.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NANCY CLEELAND</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When a young mushroom picker named Jose Garcia defied his employer
and voted to join the United Farm Workers 27 years ago, he figured
he'd done the hard part. The wage hikes, health benefits and job
security promised by labor hero Cesar Chavez in a bruising campaign
were sure to be just around the corner.</LD>
<LD>   But Garcia, now 46, said he earns less in inflation-adjusted
dollars than he did as a teenager. His medical care is limited to
what he can get at the local emergency room. And the security he
longed for is still elusive.</LD>
<LD>   Like thousands of other agricultural workers in California, Garcia
is in labor limbo: technically represented by a union but not covered
by a contract. "We try to bargain," said Garcia, a member of the
union negotiating team at the Pictsweet Mushroom Farm in Oxnard.
"They take our proposals and laugh."</LD>
<TE>   A bill on Gov. Gray Davis' desk would put the impasse at Pictsweet
and several others like it in the hands of an arbitrator, who could
force the parties into a contract and dictate its terms. The measure
would be the first of its kind in the nation.</TE>
<TE>   Tennessee-based United Foods Inc., which owns Pictsweet, did not
return repeated phone calls last week. The firm has declined to
publicly comment on the arbitration bill or the company's labor
issues in the past months. About a year ago, officials said that
their workers receive wages and benefits comparable to those paid at
other mushroom farms.</TE>
<TE>   Growers adamantly oppose the bill, saying arbitration for an
initial contract is unconstitutional, unfair and economically
dangerous. "We have 80,000 farms in the state," said Thomas Nassif,
president of the Western Growers Assn. "Are we going to change our
laws because the union can't get a contract with a couple of
employers?"</TE>
<TE>   Davis, who is running for reelection, has not indicated whether he
will sign the bill into law. He must act within 12 days.</TE>
<TE>   The UFW plans to maintain a vigil outside the state Capitol until
Davis acts, and union co-founder Dolores Huerta has vowed to start a
public fast if the governor vetoes the bill.</TE>
<TE>   First contracts are notoriously tough for any union to negotiate,
but the UFW says it is at a particular disadvantage because so much
farm work is seasonal and transient.</TE>
<TE>   Union spokesman Marc Grossman said the numbers speak for
themselves: Of the 428 elections won by the union since the state's
Agricultural Labor Relations Act became law in 1975, only
158--37%--resulted in contracts.</TE>
<TE>   Grower organizations say those numbers are deceptive, because some
businesses went bankrupt before a contract could be reached, and
workers at others voted to decertify the union.</TE>
<TE>   They also note that state law already provides a "make whole"
remedy, which forces growers to compensate workers if contracts are
not negotiated in good faith.</TE>
<TE>   Since 1975, the Agricultural Labor Relations Board has ordered 58
employers to pay about $34 million under that provision.</TE>
<TE>   Only $4.4 million has been paid, according to a recent report from
board Chairwoman Genevieve A. Shiroma.</TE>
<TE>   In her report to state Sen. Mike Machado (D-Linden), Shiroma said
the language of the original law makes enforcement difficult and
susceptible to years of litigation.</TE>
<TE>   In agriculture, long-term employment is rare. But mushroom farms
provide year-round work and an opportunity to set down roots. That
was a draw for Garcia, who took the job at Pictsweet 30 years ago as
a 17-year-old immigrant from Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   He married, bought a small two-bedroom house, started a family. He
showed younger workers how to pick through the dark mushroom beds
stacked to the ceiling, lights strapped to their foreheads, suspended
on safety lines "like monkeys."</TE>
<TE>   Along with a majority of the farm's 150 workers, he voted for the
union in 1975, three months after the state agricultural labor law
was adopted in a wave of elections that followed a 1,000-mile march
through the state by Chavez.</TE>
<TE>   Several months later, the company and workers signed a contract
providing paid family medical insurance and incremental raises. "The
12 years we had with them were very good," he recalled.</TE>
<TE>   But after a series of ownership changes, the company was bought
out of bankruptcy in 1987 by United Foods Inc. Workers agreed to
temporarily suspend the union contract and take a pay cut to help the
business survive.</TE>
<TE>   Since then, Garcia said, sporadic attempts to revive the contract
have ended in frustration. "If it weren't for my wife's job, forget
it, I wouldn't be able to survive," said Garcia, who earns about $350
in an average week. "We have no savings, nothing. We have enough to
eat, but we're always just getting by."</TE>
<TE>   In his view, company attorneys have merely gone through the
motions of negotiating while holding down wages to 1987 levels. He
said they had no intention of making a deal.</TE>
<TE>   Union officials said that relatively few employers practice
insincere "surface bargaining" but that those who do drain resources.
Until a contract is signed, workers pay no union dues.</TE>
<TE>   "At Pictsweet, we have to spend half a million a year to fight
this guy," said UFW President Arturo Rodriguez. "If you do this with
every single employer, you're going to run out of money fast."</TE>
<TE>   The difficulty of obtaining contracts, and with them gains in
wages and benefits, also dampens enthusiasm for organizing, Rodriguez
said. A binding arbitration law "at least gives us an opportunity to
get out there and get started," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Once more than 100,000 strong, UFW membership now hovers at about
27,000.</TE>
<TE>   While the UFW views arbitration as a boon, farm groups say it
could bankrupt already-struggling growers.</TE>
<TE>   "If approved, this legislation would apply even in cases where
farmers make a good-faith effort to create a contract with union
negotiators. It would throw the issue to a state arbitrator who is
unfamiliar with the complexities of agricultural production and the
economic realities that farm employers face when producing highly
perishable products," said California Farm Bureau Federation
President Bill Pauli.</TE>
<TE>   "It is not out of the realm of possibility that some family
farmers, already squeezed by high production costs and poor prices,
would be forced out of business by such an unfair process," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The law would come into play if a union and employer failed to
reach a contract within 90 days of a union election. A mediator would
then have 30 days to fashion a compromise.</TE>
<TE>   If no deal resulted, either party could petition the state labor
board to submit the matter to binding arbitration.</TE>
<TE>   Growers say the potential for arbitration could encourage union
negotiators to make unreasonable demands in the hope that an
arbitrator would meet them halfway. Union officials say the threat of
arbitration would force both sides to be sober and practical.</TE>
<TE>   "We're not asking for something out of this world," said Garcia.
"All we want is a neutral person to say if we are right or the
company is right."</TE>

<HD>Oral History Project Explores UFW Roots</HD>

<LD>For nearly 40 years, the nameless, faceless farmhands who labored in
fields, protested against growers and demonstrated for fair wages and
decent housing have remained in the shadow of Cesar Chavez, the
symbol of the farm workers' struggle.</LD>
<LD>   Now, these men and women are emerging through first-person
accounts of the formation and early days of a labor movement that
began in 1962 on rural farms in the San Joaquin Valley and spilled
over into other movements in urban corridors across America.</LD>
<LD>   In 1995, Jorge Garcia, Cal State Northridge dean of humanities,
and Kent Kirkton, chairman of the journalism department, began the
effort to gather laborers' oral histories. The stories will broaden
the available source material on the plight of the poor grape and
lettuce pickers who organized the United Farm Workers union, Garcia
said.</LD>
<TE>   The collection process will take a significant step forward on
Labor Day weekend, when the professors expect to interview a dozen
elderly activists at the UFW's national convention in Fresno.</TE>
<TE>   Eventually, the tape-recorded interviews will be transcribed and
placed in the special collections section of the Oviatt Library at
Cal State Northridge. The collection will include photographs,
memorabilia and videotaped interviews. So far, 30 workers have
recorded their recollections from the earliest days of the union. "I
think this kind of work is invaluable," said Carlos Munoz Jr.,
professor emeritus of ethnic studies at UC Berkeley. "Down the line,
this history will be lost unless the voices of those who made it are
documented.</TE>
<TE>   "Up until now, what is known about the United Farm Workers union
is Cesar Chavez and other leadership of the union, which is well and
good," he said. "But very seldom do you have the rank and file add
their voices to the historical record. This is extremely
significant."</TE>
<TE>   The collection includes interviews with workers like Julio
Hernandez, who took part in numerous strikes in the late 1950s before
the union was founded, Garcia said.</TE>
<TE>   "As a result of his participation in those earlier strikes,
Hernandez was blackballed in California, so he moved to the Pacific
Northwest, where he could find work," Garcia said.</TE>
<TE>   "When Chavez went looking for him to help organize pickers,
[Hernandez] ducked him," he added. "But it was his wife who told him
that Chavez needed his help and he needed to be there."</TE>
<TE>   Hernandez became the first president of the UFW's credit union,
Garcia said.</TE>
<TE>   Farm worker Antonia Saludado was a Delano teenager when she quit
school to work in the fields to support her younger siblings. She
talks about being among union workers whom Chavez inspired to fan out
across the United States and Canada in 1968, urging shoppers not to
buy California grapes.</TE>
<TE>   "Antonia jumped into the car to go organize in Chicago," Kirkton
said. "She only spoke Spanish. She had never been anywhere except her
native Mexico and Delano."</TE>
<TE>   She and other farm workers met with a union representative in
Chicago who helped them organize protests. They shared their plight
in union halls and church sanctuaries there and rallied sympathizers
to join picket lines in front of grocery stores, Kirkton said.</TE>
<TE>   In a taped interview, Saludado, now in her 50s, said Chavez's
faith in her had given her the confidence to overcome her fears and
limitations. "That's something the old man taught me: not to be
afraid."</TE>
<TE>   The professors said they are racing against time to collect the
oral histories. "Every month, we learn that someone we had hoped to
interview has passed," Garcia said. "A couple of people we already
have interviewed have died."</TE>
<TE>   Garcia and Kirkton focus the interviews more on workers' life
histories than on anecdotes about union activity.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to see where their activism comes from and who influenced
them," Kirkton said. "What brought them into the union? What effect
did it have on their lives? Why did they make these sacrifices?"</TE>
<TE>   The professors, who came up with the idea for the oral histories
on the ride back to Los Angeles from Delano after Cesar Chavez's
funeral in April 1993, said they hope the collection will put a face
on numerous anonymous laborers.</TE>
<TE>   "The workers have the greatest respect for Cesar Chavez because he
was a transforming agent in their lives," Kirkton said. "However, the
movement is still alive and it rests on the shoulders of thousands of
people."</TE>

<HD>Family That Owns Register Considers Options</HD>
<DH>Media: Members may sell or restructure parent firm Freedom,
long a libertarian bastion.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Squabbling members of the family that owns Freedom Communications
Inc. met Saturday to consider selling or restructuring the closely
held company that operates the Orange County Register and other media
properties.</LD>
<LD>   During a daylong session at a Costa Mesa hotel that will continue
today, about 50 adult descendants of Freedom founder R.C. Hoiles
reviewed a dozen options that would allow unhappy shareholders to
liquidate some or all of their holdings.</LD>
<LD>   The options include selling all or part of the company, taking the
company public, buying out disaffected shareholders and offering a
stock repurchase plan. The family intends to present a short list of
options to the company's board Monday night for a vote.</LD>
<TE>   The weekend meeting was organized after dissident family members,
including the founder's grandson and company board member Tim Hoiles,
complained about their inability to cash out their holdings.</TE>
<TE>   Hoiles owns 8.6% of the company and contends that mismanagement
has diluted his investment. He is urging that the company be sold and
has threatened to sue family members.</TE>
<TE>   Emerging from a hotel conference room Saturday evening, Hoiles
said that he considered the meeting "a sham" and that he planned to
review his options, including whether to proceed with a lawsuit,
after the meeting ends today.</TE>
<TE>   Another family member and shareholder, Pamela Hoiles, said she
considered the meeting constructive, "but there's still a lot of
hurt." She declined to say whether she supports Tim Hoiles' position
or some other option.</TE>
<TE>   Freedom owns 28 daily newspapers, 37 weeklies and eight television
stations. The Register, the 12th-largest paper in the country by
circulation and the standard-bearer of libertarianism, is considered
the crown jewel.</TE>
<TE>   Tim Hoiles has hired a team of high-profile legal and media
advisors, including San Francisco antitrust attorney Joseph M.
Alioto, to help drum up support for a sale of the company, which he
believes would provide the largest payout. Hoiles maintains that
Freedom could fetch $2.2 billion to $2.7 billion, far more than any
other option would yield. Independent analysts have pegged the
company's value at $1.5 billion to $2 billion.</TE>
<TE>   On Saturday, London-based investment banker Christopher Shaw, also
hired by Hoiles, told reporters assembled outside the closed meeting
room that 24 media companies have expressed interest in Freedom. He
declined to identify any of the potential suitors.</TE>
<TE>   But a source close to the family said Gannett Co., the McLean,
Va.-based parent of USA Today and other media holdings, is one, as is
Sacramento-based McClatchy Co., owner of the Sacramento Bee and Star
Tribune in Minneapolis. Neither Gannett nor McClatchy officials could
be reached for comment Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   Freedom had revenue of $760 million last year and lost about $94
million amid the nationwide advertising downturn and softening
economy, said sources familiar with the results. The business also
reportedly wrote off $103 million in magazine, Internet and other
losses.</TE>

<DH>Carl Terzian uses public relations contacts and networking
events to match nonprofit groups with potential donors and
volunteers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CARA MIA DiMASSA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>On a recent Wednesday morning, a long breakfast table at the Regency
Club in Westwood was crowded with orange juice and water glasses,
purple roses in blue vases, and enough muffins and coffee cake to
fuel 30 people.</LD>
<LD>   Each place at the white linen-covered table was elegantly set: two
forks, a spoon, a knife--and a half-inch-thick stack of business
cards.</LD>
<LD>   Although the most pressing question seemed to be about
breakfast--oatmeal or eggs benedict?--those cards were the most
important items on the table, because each represented a wealth of
human capital.</LD>
<TE>   But this was not your typical corporate meet-and-greet. As much as
the participants might have been inclined to swap pointers about the
ins and outs of capital gains taxes, they had arrived at the Regency
at 7:45 a.m. to talk charity.</TE>
<TE>   Before breakfast was over, they would share stories from their
work trying to improve the lives of children, fund Alzheimer's
research, beautify Hollywood and care for America's veterans. And, if
all went well, a few matches would be made between nonprofits hungry
for new blood and the businesspeople around the table.</TE>
<TE>   That's the point of the networking events hosted by Carl Terzian,
president of a West Los Angeles public relations firm that bears his
name. Terzian has been organizing these events for 30 years.</TE>
<TE>   His obsession with matching nonprofit groups and potential donors,
volunteers and board members, is a way, he admits, to help his own
business. But he thinks his events are also about serving the greater
community. They are a reminder that charity is, after a fashion, a
business, and that, as in any business, connections are a key to
success.</TE>
<TE>   The names and titles of those attending this particular morning
indicated an eclectic mix, including a graphic designer, a wealth
management consultant, a corporate headhunter, a major gifts officer
for the United Jewish Fund and four executives from the Southern
California chapter of Easter Seals. Some were Terzian clients. Others
were interesting people Terzian has met in many years as a
philanthropic salonista.</TE>
<TE>   Before each one stood for an introduction, Terzian recited that
person's resume from memory, ticking off important and insignificant
details at the same rapid-fire pace. He described how a corporate jet
company, whose senior vice president sat at one end of the table, had
doubled its size since Sept. 11. A female attorney with her own firm,
he said, was "a combination of Barbra Streisand and Bette Midler."</TE>
<TE>   Guests were encouraged to leave their professional titles behind
and talk about what Terzian calls the back of the business card: who
they are as human beings. One executive spoke about her niece, who is
severely handicapped and uses a computer to communicate; another
mentioned his recent honeymoon.</TE>
<TE>   It took nearly three hours to get around the table.</TE>
<TE>   But incorporating the personal with the professional, Terzian
said, is fundamental to making connections among those seated at the
table, as are his own introductions.</TE>
<TE>   "It's important for me to bring out in your background that you
went to college in Pittsburgh, because maybe I know that someone else
knows Pittsburgh. Or I will say, 'Sally doesn't realize that she and
Harry have something in common: a board that they served on together
years ago.' "</TE>
<TE>   William Browning Jr., an associate at Gilbert-Krupin, an insurance
and estate planning firm, moved to the Los Angeles area from
Arlington, Va., in late May.</TE>
<TE>   He met Terzian soon afterward and, in the last three months, has
attended six networking events: the Regency Club breakfast, as well
as lunches, dinners and cocktail receptions at local clubs and
hotels. The events, he said, have been crucial to his introduction to
corporate and philanthropic circles in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to be open and realize that you may not see something
right away" from the events, Browning said. "If you are in it to grow
as a person, meet people and grow your network base, you will find
commonalities there."</TE>
<TE>   Terzian estimates that he orchestrates 800 networking events a
year--an astonishing number, even if you consider that his Rolodex
holds more than 15,000 names. "And there's no one on there that I
don't know personally," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "He's the king of mixers," said Mike Flory, vice president of
Easter Seals of Southern California, which was the featured charity
that morning. At each networking event, a Terzian client who is
willing to pick up the tab acts as host. The size of the gatherings
varies, from a handful of people to dozens.</TE>
<TE>   At many events, representatives from nonprofits with personal
connections to the host make short pitches. Later, they cull the
guest list in search of people with whom they hit it off or who they
think might be helpful to them in one capacity or another.</TE>
<TE>   Browning said one event he attended generated eight additional
meet-and-greets. Through those events, he made personal contacts with
representatives for the American Parkinson Disease Assn. and the
Jewish Big Brothers Assn., both groups he would like to be able to
work with: the Parkinson organization because his grandfather has the
disease, the Big Brothers because he got on well with the group's
executive director, who had spent time in Virginia.</TE>
<TE>   Because of the personal connections, Browning said, "You get
welcomed in, get asked to roll up your shirt sleeves and get involved
right away."</TE>
<TE>   For the record, most people at the networking breakfast at the
Regency Club chose the eggs benedict. After all, when your heart is
in the right place, a little bit of caloric indulgence is acceptable.
Even encouraged.</TE>

<HD>Drought Disrupts a Tight-Knit Town</HD>
<DH>Resources: Residents chide local man for selling water
elsewhere amid curbs at home. He defends his business.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Among the towering trees and soft mountain-top breezes of Idyllwild,
a nasty battle over water is being waged.</LD>
<LD>   In the tight-knit town of 2,500 residents--most of whom embrace
mountain living because of the serenity it brings--threats have been
made, cars vandalized and people scared.</LD>
<LD>   A devastating drought--this is the driest year since 1883--has
forced residents into the highest-level water alert, Stage Three.
Watering lawns has been banned, laundry loads restricted and toilet
flushes rationed.</LD>
<TE>   The drought, however, has not affected the business of Paul Black,
the owner of Idyllwild Mountain Spring Waterworks.</TE>
<TE>   Every day, he loads tanker trucks with the sparkling liquid that
flows from a well on his property and sells it to companies off the
mountain. That has his neighbors furious.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a moral issue," said Marsha Bronson, an 18-year Idyllwild
resident. "We're in a drought. That water should stay on the
mountain."</TE>
<TE>   Bronson and her neighbors are part of a group organized to stop
Black's business. They argue that the systematic removal of water
from his property lowers the overall water table in Idyllwild,
decreasing already dangerously low levels.</TE>
<TE>   The Fern Valley, Idyllwild and Pine Cove water companies have
implemented strict water conservation guidelines. Overstepping them
will cause water bills to skyrocket. So residents have taken to
washing clothes at Laundromats down the mountain and to buying trash
cans full of water for their gardens.</TE>
<TE>   Local water companies argue that Black's sales actually have very
little impact on the area's water levels.</TE>
<TE>   "He's not really stripping our water source, as far as we know,"
said Suellen Bidwell, office manager for Fern Valley Water, which
retained a hydrologist earlier this year to study the issue.</TE>
<TE>   The area's water comes strictly from annual rain and snowfall. In
an average year, Idyllwild collects about 27 inches of rain, said Tom
Lovejoy, general manager for the Idyllwild Water District. But for
the past four years, the moisture level has plummeted, falling as low
as 10 inches last year.</TE>
<TE>   Black's spring runs down the mountain and through his property
because of simple gravity, Lovejoy said. In essence, he catches the
water runoff not collected by any of the water district wells.</TE>
<TE>   "Basically, he's using water that would probably just run off the
hill anyway," Bidwell said.</TE>
<TE>   But residents have a hard time accepting that explanation from
their local water purveyors.</TE>
<TE>   "People who live downstream from him have trees dying, trees at a
local Boy Scout camp," said middle school teacher Patty Carratello.
"What more evidence do you need?"</TE>
<TE>   Water resources have become so tight that local restaurants can
serve water only when customers ask for it, and half-empty glasses
are dumped into surrounding plants.</TE>
<TE>   Business owners are also told not to wash down their walkways or
storefronts. Neighbors are doing what they can to share water
conservation tips--such as putting a bucket under the showerhead
while the water warms and then using that to wash the car or water
the lawn.</TE>
<TE>   Black simply tells his water-envious neighbors that his operation
is like any other water business and doesn't understand why he should
bear the burden of the drought problem.</TE>
<TE>   "We're no different than Arrowhead, who has a spring; or
Sparkletts, who has a spring; or Culligan; or any of the others,"
Black said.</TE>
<TE>   But it appears unlikely that local residents will be appeased.
They have organized a petition drive and spent time picketing near
Black's property.</TE>
<TE>   Ill feelings came to a head a little more than a month ago at a
turnout along California 243 where, according to residents, Black's
trucks load water using a hose running from his property.</TE>
<TE>   A group of protesters decided to park their cars on the spot the
night of June 30 to block the trucks from loading water the next day.
The following morning, however, car owners say they discovered
slashed tires, smashed windows and heavily scratched paint.
Carratello said her 1986 pickup was so badly damaged that her
insurance company declared it a total loss.</TE>
<TE>   A report was filed, according to the Riverside County Sheriff's
Department, but there wasn't enough evidence to charge anyone.</TE>
<TE>   Two weeks ago, another picketer called the department after she
said a water truck driver confronted her at the turnout. "He was a
big burly guy," said Margaret, who asked that her last name not be
used because of safety concerns. "And he got in my face and said he'd
sue me for obstructing his business."</TE>
<TE>   Margaret said she had never seen the man before.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't even think he knew my name," she said. "But he started
listing my assets. 'I'll get your house, your Jeep, your Harley
Davidson.' He's just some truck driver. How'd he know all of that? It
really frightened me."</TE>
<TE>   Deputies took a report but did not arrest the driver because he
made no physical threat.</TE>
<TE>   Residents said Black and his drivers also typically photograph
their protests and take pictures of their license plates.</TE>
<TE>   "It's to the point where people feel frightened for their safety,"
said Jeff Smith, who leads the Mountain Resources Conservancy, a
citizens group created to study the water exportation issue.</TE>
<TE>   "We just didn't know what to expect anymore," Smith said. "I just
want this part to go away. I don't want this to escalate."</TE>
<TE>   County officials said there is little they can do to stop Black's
operation for now, even though some point out that he is running a
business in what is considered a residential area.</TE>
<TE>   Black declined to discuss that issue or most others involving his
business.</TE>
<TE>   He was denied a permit to operate a business from his home earlier
this year, but his operation continues mainly because county
officials can't agree on the definition of a business.</TE>
<TE>   Black has no customers that come in and out of his house, and that
clouds the issue, said Ken Graff, legislative assistant for county
Supervisor Jim Venable.</TE>
<TE>   The lack of objection from local water companies has also given
citizens less leverage in blocking Black's water sales, Graff said.</TE>
<TE>   "The water companies have no objection to it, but the residents
turn to the county and say, 'You are allowing him to take water off
the hill. Why?' " Graff said.</TE>
<TE>   Smith's group has hired an attorney to study the zoning issue and
other legal options.</TE>
<TE>   "The saddest part of all this is the divisiveness in our little
town now," Margaret said. "That's a shame."</TE>

<HD>N.Y.'s Bid for the Oscars Deserves Bronx Cheer</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Steve Lopez</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>So New York wants to steal the Oscars from L.A.</LD>
<LD>   All I have to say is:</LD>
<LD>   You tawkin' to us?</LD>
<TE>   Gov. George Pataki and Mayor Michael Bloomberg are in on the
heist, along with Miramax carpetbagger Harvey Weinstein. They'd like
to hijack the whole show, but out of the goodness of their hearts,
they might be willing to settle for just a segment of it.</TE>
<TE>   The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences claimed there's
been no discussion, although it did not rule out the possibility of
broadcasting part of next year's show from New York.</TE>
<TE>   I don't like the sound of this. That city never wants just a
little bit of anything, and this isn't the first time New Yorkers
have made a move on the Oscars. Back in the early 1990s, when L.A.
was down and out, New York thugs plotted a mugging.</TE>
<TE>   "This was around the time of the riots, and there was talk that if
it's not safe in L.A., maybe the show should move to New York," says
Cody Cluff, L.A.'s former film czar.</TE>
<TE>   Cluff, who heads the Entertainment Industry Development Corp. in
Los Angeles, notes that New York has repeatedly tried to pass itself
off as the new Hollywood, claiming the hottest film action is back
East. It's preposterous, Cluff says. L.A. remains the unrivaled film
capital of the world.</TE>
<TE>   This tells you something about the mentality of New Yorkers. They
routinely trash L.A. and everything it stands for, but they secretly
aspire to flip-flops and cool ocean breezes. They'd beat us over the
head in a New York minute to host the Academy Awards.</TE>
<TE>   What's worse, the conspirators are exploiting the tragedy of Sept.
11 to justify the swindle. New York needs the Oscars, they say, to
advance the city's recovery.</TE>
<TE>   I used to live in New York, and I don't know many people there who
are going to say, "You know, I lost a relative and two buddies in the
World Trade Center, but I just saw Julia Roberts walk the red carpet,
and I feel better already."</TE>
<TE>   And unless the stars donate their jewels, Oscar night is barely
going to generate enough money to mow the grass in Central Park.</TE>
<TE>   Under different circumstances, I'd tell New York to go ahead and
help itself to the Oscars. Usually the show is an over-hyped schlock
fest, so painful to watch it reminds you of a lot of the dreck on
Broadway.</TE>
<TE>   But on principle, L.A. shouldn't budge an inch.</TE>
<TE>   "What's annoying is this whole New York-as-victim thing," says
Cluff.</TE>
<TE>   "They aren't the only ones who suffered from Sept. 11. The tourist
industry has suffered here in L.A., as it has around the world. We're
supposed to compete against orphans and widows? I've got people who
can't make a living, or cover their house and car payments, because
the tourism industry was devastated by Sept. 11. And now New York is
trying to drive another nail into our coffin."</TE>
<TE>   If Cluff sounds like he's overreacting, maybe you didn't hear
about Mayor Bloomberg's press conference Friday.</TE>
<TE>   He didn't say he wanted a little piece of the Academy Awards. He
said he's going after the Oscars and every other major event he can
get his grubby hands on.</TE>
<TE>   "Well, the Academy Awards we hope to get here," he said. "We're
trying to get both [political] conventions, we're trying to get the
Olympics, we're trying to get a Super Bowl, we'd like to get the
Oscars."</TE>
<TE>   What, and let Indianapolis keep the Indy 500?</TE>
<TE>   "This is the place for big events," Bloomberg bragged. "This is a
showcase place, and I think we can make a good case here."</TE>
<TE>   You know what's going on here?</TE>
<TE>   I'll tell you what's going on.</TE>
<TE>   These New York punks look west to L.A., and who do they see
standing in their way?</TE>
<TE>   Mayor Slim Jim Hahn.</TE>
<TE>   Of course they're trying to swipe his candy. A year into the job,
Slim Jim's still using training wheels.</TE>
<TE>   I called the mayor's office Friday to see what he was going to do,
and he never rang me back.</TE>
<TE>   When I called again, press secretary Julie Wong assured me Hahn
was quite firm in telling her he'd be up for sharing a piece of next
year's broadcast with New York, "but Los Angeles will always be the
home of the Academy Awards."</TE>
<TE>   That's not the reaction I'm looking for.</TE>
<TE>   When New York heavies threaten to leave us with nothing but a few
palm trees, you meet them in the alley.</TE>
<TE>   Maybe I can help.</TE>
<TE>   Stand in front of the mirror, Jim, narrow your eyes, and repeat
after me:</TE>
<TE>   "You talkin' to me? Yeah, I mean you, tough guy. You want a piece
of Slim Jim?"</TE>
<TE>   (Now repeat.)</TE>
<TE>   You've got to stand your ground. And like Bloomberg, you've got to
think of your city as a showcase for big events.</TE>
<TE>   We shouldn't have to suffer through another embarrassment like the
millennium celebration, when local leaders didn't know what to do or
where to do it.</TE>
<TE>   Speaking of Oscar-winning performances, I asked Wong how Hahn
plans to commemorate Sept. 11, and I think you'll find her answer
remarkable.</TE>
<TE>   It's still being worked out, she said, but the heart and soul of
the memorial event is going to be "a procession of a few emergency
vehicles" across the city.</TE>
<TE>   But that's not all.</TE>
<TE>   There's also going to be a "mobile collage," made up of poems and
artwork done by Angelenos on 8 1/2-by-11-inch paper.</TE>
<TE>   Are you still with me, L.A., or is the excitement too much?</TE>
<TE>   These offerings, she said, will be mounted "on chicken wire and
placed on the back of a flatbed truck."</TE>
<TE>   The world changed forever on Sept. 11, and you're telling me L.A.
will remember with a chicken-wire collage on a flatbed truck?</TE>
<TE>   "Yes. Chicken wire."</TE>
<TE>   We don't have a fighting chance.</TE>
<TE>   I say we give New York the Oscars, and beg them not to hurt us.</TE>

<HD>Peter Matz, 73; Musician Won Emmys, Raised Funds for AIDS</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MYRNA OLIVER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Peter Matz, musical director, composer, arranger, orchestrator and
conductor for Broadway, Hollywood and--most prolifically--television,
who earned Emmys for programs featuring Barbra Streisand, Burt
Bacharach and Carol Burnett, has died. He was 73.</LD>
<LD>   Matz was also an accomplished pianist who in recent years
accompanied his wife, singer Marilynn Lovell, at fund-raising
concerts to benefit AIDS victims.</LD>
<LD>   He died Friday in Los Angeles of lung cancer, his publicist
announced.</LD>
<TE>   " 'Play' is the operative word for musicians," the witty Matz told
The Times last year in what might have been a one-word description of
his life and career. "They are playing."</TE>
<TE>   "I could be real obscure and say music is life," he mused then.
"Music is breathing. Music is about evolution. Music is about love.
Music is about sadness. Music is all the emotions, in the same room,
sometimes at the same time."</TE>
<TE>   Matz, known for inserting musical jokes into orchestrations that
could break up even professional comedians such as Burnett, made a
50-year career out of musical play. And at the same time he was
amusing and delighting the singers he worked with and the audiences
he entertained, he was earning their respect and accolades.</TE>
<TE>   In his long association with Streisand, Matz won a Grammy for his
arrangements on her 1964 album, "People"; an Emmy for her 1965
television special, "My Name Is Barbra"; and an Academy Award
nomination for best original score for her 1975 film, "Funny Lady."
Matz arranged and conducted most of the material on Streisand's first
five albums for Columbia, including his composition "Gotta Move."</TE>
<TE>   He teamed with her again in 1986, earning another Grammy
nomination for arranging, conducting and producing her platinum
recording "The Broadway Album."</TE>
<TE>   Matz's other two Emmys were for his work on the 1970 Kraft Music
Hall presentation of "The Sound of Burt Bacharach" and a 1973 segment
of "The Carol Burnett Show," for which he was musical director for
eight years.</TE>
<TE>   The multifaceted musician garnered at least 10 other Emmy
nominations for his contributions to more than 140 television movies
and specials.</TE>
<TE>   Born in Pittsburgh, Matz earned a degree in chemical engineering
at UCLA in what he jokingly called his "terrible, misguided youth."
But during his college years, he made money playing woodwinds with
area dance bands, and music rather than chemistry left the lasting
impression.</TE>
<TE>   After graduation, Matz went to Paris to immerse himself for two
years in that city's music scene.</TE>
<TE>   He moved to New York in 1954 to study piano and music theory and
soon got a job as rehearsal pianist for composer Harold Arlen's
Broadway musical "House of Flowers."</TE>
<TE>   The job expanded to writing orchestrations, vocal arrangements and
dance music for Arlen's next musical, "Jamaica," starring Lena Horne.</TE>
<TE>   Arlen became a mentor, and Matz worked with Horne for years. In
1965, Matz earned a Clio Award for a commercial she made.</TE>
<TE>   It was Arlen who introduced Matz to Marlene Dietrich, who not only
used his arrangements for her shows but introduced the composer to
Noel Coward.</TE>
<TE>   Matz was arranger and pianist for Coward's celebrated engagement
in the young Las Vegas of 1955 and then worked with Coward on
Coward's 1961 Broadway musical, "Sail Away."</TE>
<TE>   Among other well-known entertainers with whom Matz worked were
Peggy Lee, Bing Crosby, Liza Minnelli, Tony Bennett, Sarah Vaughan,
Dionne Warwick, Rosemary Clooney, Maureen McGovern, Bernadette Peters
and Melissa Manchester.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to his prodigious fund-raising concerts with his wife
in recent years, Matz also became the musical engine of Los Angeles'
"Reprise! Broadway's Best," which since 1997 has staged revivals of
historic Broadway musicals.</TE>
<TE>   Artistic director Marcia Seligson last year credited much of the
series' success to Matz and his attention to historical musical
detail--such as re-creating the original upbeat style of George and
Ira Gershwin's 1927 "The Man I Love."</TE>
<TE>   "Musical theater is really a native art form," Matz said during
those years, explaining why he devoted such efforts to the series,
including the Gershwin musical. "It should be preserved for the same
reason it's important to preserve a Frank Lloyd Wright building or
not let old movies decay in the can."</TE>
<TE>   Matz is survived by his wife; two sons from his first marriage,
Zachary and Jonas; and one grandson.</TE>
<TE>   Arrangements for services are pending. The family has asked that
any memorial donations be made to Aid for AIDS.</TE>

<LD>A 46-year-old Lemon Heights man was electrocuted Saturday as he
apparently tried to clear palm tree fronds from a power line, police
said.</LD>
<LD>   John Kincannon, who lived in the unincorporated area near Santa
Ana, was working in his backyard in the 1900 block of La Cuesta Drive
at 2:15 p.m. and was apparently using a swimming pool skimmer to
clear the fronds.</LD>
<LD>   When the pole touched the line, Kincannon received a shock and
stopped breathing. A neighbor started cardiopulmonary resuscitation,
then paramedics arrived and took him to Western Medical Center-Santa
Ana, where he was pronounced dead.</LD>

<LD>As a deputy public defender, Denise Gragg spends her professional
life behind the eight ball, trying to convince juries to acquit
people charged with crimes. Or, once they're convicted, to punish
them less severely than prosecutors want. It's a daunting task, if
only because even defense attorneys know that the vast majority of
people brought to trial are guilty.</LD>
<LD>   Gragg must be pulling out her hair these days. She's representing
Alejandro Avila, perhaps the most notorious murder suspect in the
country, and she must have the feeling that most people would rather
not bother with the man's trial. After all, the Orange County sheriff
and the district attorney both have said he's guilty, and that
apparently was enough for President Bush, who a week after Avila's
arrest publicly referred to him as "the killer" of 5-year-old
Samantha Runnion.</LD>
<LD>   Sheriff Michael S. Carona and Dist. Atty. Tony Rackauckas both
have discussed the case on national TV. They've alluded to evidence
that convinces them Avila is the man who abducted and killed
Samantha.</LD>
<TE>   Mind you, Gragg hasn't seen any of it. The other side isn't
required to turn it over yet, so, naturally, it hasn't. Like the rest
of us, however, she's certainly free to watch TV and learn that her
client is guilty. My experience with Gragg over the years tells me
she's not a media hound, but the cries of "guilty!" against her
client have her talking about a change of venue.</TE>
<TE>   Can you blame her?</TE>
<TE>   Play By the Rules</TE>
<TE>   Does anybody play by the rules anymore? I need not recite all the
violators from various walks of American life, but how many of you
remember a day when someone arrested and charged with a crime wasn't
considered guilty until after a jury heard a little evidence?</TE>
<TE>   Sounds almost quaint, doesn't it?</TE>
<TE>   I realize it's possible that the sheriff and district attorney are
sitting on a confession from Avila, who has pleaded not guilty. So
far, however, we haven't heard publicly that he confessed to anyone.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities say DNA and other evidence will prove Avila's guilt.
For all I know, that evidence is air-tight.</TE>
<TE>   If so, why am I going on so?</TE>
<TE>   The big deal is, this isn't how murder cases should be run. Yeah,
I do live in the real world and know that all the old rules don't
exist anymore, but they should.</TE>
<TE>   For argument's sake, what if someone had information that would
help in Avila's defense? Would that person be discouraged from coming
forward, having heard from the president on down that Avila is
guilty?</TE>
<TE>   Never a Mistake?</TE>
<TE>   To accept the current playbook is to say that prosecutors or
police never arrest the wrong guy. It's to accept they never misread
or misstate evidence.</TE>
<TE>   It's to give them credit for collaring the bad guy before they get
a conviction.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities said early on that Avila knew the Runnion neighborhood
from experience. They say his car matched a description given by
Samantha's playmate.</TE>
<TE>   I'll suppose, as Gragg no doubt does, that the authorities have
much more than that.</TE>
<TE>   Their DNA evidence may be unassailable.</TE>
<TE>   Or not.</TE>
<TE>   Not to be old-fashioned, but that's why we have trials. We have
them to find out if there's either a smoking gun or an unshakable
alibi.</TE>
<TE>   There's much comfort to a community to know that a child-killer is
in custody. I think that's what drove Carona to be so emphatic in the
first hours after Avila's arrest.</TE>
<TE>   But it has been three weeks since his arrest. Now should come the
silent period between arrest and trial.</TE>
<TE>   If only as a nod to our system of justice, we used to be patient
enough to wait for a trial.</TE>
<TE>   When did that go out of style?</TE>

<HD>Hearing on Pledge Asked of Full Court</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Trying to rescue the words "under God" from court assault, the
Justice Department is maintaining that a three-judge federal appeals
panel failed to heed Supreme Court rulings when it held that reciting
the Pledge of Allegiance in public schools is unconstitutional.</LD>
<LD>   In court documents the Bush administration filed Friday, attorneys
asked for a hearing before all 11 judges of the 9th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals in San Francisco. The administration wants the
entire appellate court to reconsider the panel's 2-1 ruling.</LD>
<LD>   The nation's highest court previously determined that the words
"under God" in the pledge are among "many ceremonial references to
our religious heritage and do not establish a religious faith," the
department said in legal briefs.</LD>
<TE>   It also asserted that Michael Newdow of suburban Sacramento, who
brought the case on behalf of his daughter, did not have the legal
standing to do so because he does not have custody of the child.</TE>
<TE>   Newdow sued the Elk Grove Unified School District, claiming that
his daughter was injured by being forced to listen to children
reciting the pledge. Children cannot be made to say the Pledge of
Allegiance in class.</TE>
<TE>   But the government noted that Newdow does not have custody of the
child and that the girl's mother, Sandra Banning, has filed a court
motion seeking to intervene in the case.</TE>
<TE>   Banning wants her daughter to be able to recite the pledge, as it
stands, as part of her education.</TE>
<TE>   The government stated in the documents that Banning has said
neither she nor her daughter believes there is anything wrong with
reciting the words "under God" in the pledge.</TE>
<TE>   The ruling by the three-judge appeals panel was roundly criticized
by President Bush and members of Congress.</TE>
<TE>   If the ruling is not overturned by the 9th Circuit, the Supreme
Court probably will review the case next year, constitutional
scholars said.</TE>

<HD>More Than 60 Arrested in Street Racing Sweep</HD>
<DH>Sun Valley: Police also cite 98 onlookers and impound 92
vehicles early Saturday morning at a longtime cruising strip near
Hansen Dam.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WENDY THERMOS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Law enforcement officials cracking down on illegal street racing in
the San Fernando Valley arrested more than 60 people early Saturday
and cited more than 90 onlookers. Six drivers were arrested on
suspicion of engaging in speed contests, 57 juveniles were arrested
for curfew violations and 98 people were cited on suspicion of being
illegal-race spectators at a longtime "cruising" and street racing
strip in Sun Valley just south of Hansen Dam, said Los Angeles police
Officer Eduardo Funes.</LD>
<LD>   Glenoaks Boulevard between Sheldon and Peoria streets has been an
illicit speed contest area and a sore spot with nearby residents for
years, officials said.</LD>
<LD>   The crackdown was conducted by an on-scene task force of more than
60 officers and representatives of the Los Angeles Police Department,
California Highway Patrol, city attorney's office, California Bureau
of Automotive Repair and other agencies. The sweep began shortly
before midnight Friday and ended several hours later, Funes said.</LD>
<TE>   Officers wrote 27 smog equipment tickets and at least 90
miscellaneous citations.</TE>
<TE>   They impounded 92 vehicles for illegal parking or because their
owners did not have licenses, authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   The arrests and citations all involved misdemeanors or
infractions, police said, and are usually punishable by fines. The
operation was "extraordinarily effective," said Matt Szabo, aide to
City Councilwoman Wendy Greuel, whose district includes the illegal
drag strip. "There are so many kids doing this so often that one or
two or three officers will never catch them."</TE>
<TE>   He said Greuel is expected to introduce a motion at Tuesday's
council meeting to help police enforce laws against street racing.</TE>
<TE>   It will ask the city street department to alter Glenoaks with
speed bumps, signs or other means to discourage speeding, and may
request the drafting of an ordinance or state legislation to impose
tough new penalties, Szabo said.</TE>
<TE>   Cruising and street racing on Glenoaks has become a hobby among
some San Fernando Valley youths and young adults, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a spectator sport. They spend a lot of time working on
their cars," said Szabo. "There's money involved. It's been something
that's been going on there for years."</TE>

<LD>Scorching temperatures across the San Fernando Valley and northern
Los Angeles County hovered near and above record highs Saturday,
prompting firefighters to stand by on high alert and beef up forces
in areas prone to brush fires.</LD>
<LD>   In Woodland Hills, the record high for the date of 105 degrees,
set in 1992, was shattered as the mercury rose to 106.</LD>
<LD>   Chatsworth roasted at 105 degrees, while Lancaster baked at 106
degrees--each temperature coming within one degree of record highs in
those communities, according to Alan Shoemaker, a Weather Central
Inc. meteorologist. Other cities breathed a tad easier, with Burbank
hitting 96 degrees and West Covina reaching 98 degrees.</LD>
<TE>   Residents in all those areas can expect temperatures to remain
high for the next two days, with a slight cooling the rest of the
week, said Bill Hoffer, a meteorologist for the National Weather
Service in Oxnard.</TE>
<TE>   Because of the hot, dry weather, the Los Angeles County Fire
Department scheduled 75 more firefighters, two additional
water-dropping helicopters and 10 extra engines to be available,
officials said.</TE>
<TE>   Five of those engines were sent to the Las Virgenes-Malibu area
and five to Santa Clarita.</TE>
<TE>   "Those areas are very difficult to get resources to when there's a
fire. Freeways get jammed," said Capt. Brian Jordan, spokesman for
the department.</TE>
<TE>   Extra personnel were also stationed in the foothills of the San
Gabriel Mountains.</TE>
<TE>   If temperatures increase through the weekend, more firefighters
may be called to duty, Jordan said.</TE>
<TE>   Other county residents enjoyed a cooler summer day.</TE>
<TE>   Downtown Los Angeles reached 83 degrees, well below its record
high of 99 degrees set in 1882.</TE>
<TE>   The high at Los Angeles International Airport was 70 degrees.</TE>
<TE>   Coastal cities can expect highs in the 60s and 70s through the
week, Hoffer said.</TE>

<HD>Thanking Teachers Who Cared</HD>
<DH>Reunion: Former students and staff of a Watts elementary
school look back fondly.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIKA HAYASAKI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Nearly 40 former students, teachers and staff members of 112th Street
Elementary School--some of whom attended the Watts campus nearly 40
years ago--gathered Saturday for a collective thank you, recognizing
the high points of their education.</LD>
<LD>   "There are a lot of accomplished teachers here that never got the
recognition they deserved," said Sean Hannah, 34, who graduated in
1978, when he was 12. "They didn't seek recognition. They did it
because they cared."</LD>
<LD>   The group chatted about teachers who have died or students who
graduated from college. They listened to classic Marvin Gaye hits
while studying black and white class photographs from the
1970s--students clad in butterfly collars and bell-bottoms.</LD>
<TE>   And, as they ate lunch at the Proud Bird Restaurant in Los
Angeles, they remembered how teachers and staff members had gone the
extra mile for students.</TE>
<TE>   In the 1970s, teachers from 112th Street School made regular
evening visits to families of students who were struggling in class.
Teachers often stopped by their students' apartments in the Nickerson
Gardens public housing project near the school, where many 112th
Street students lived, Hannah said.</TE>
<TE>   Those were also the days when it was not uncommon for a teacher to
swat a child with a ruler or a paddle if the student misbehaved,
Hannah said with a chuckle.</TE>
<TE>   "I've still got scars," he joked. "I was always acting up,
fighting, talking too much in class and talking back to the
teachers."</TE>
<TE>   But Hannah grew up and became a father, writer and production
manager. He also worked as a teacher in Los Angeles Unified School
District's Locke High School for a year. Hannah still sends former
teachers his unpublished poems and novels to edit or critique, he
said.</TE>
<TE>   "You guys were truly the start of my life," he told the retired
educators in an opening speech. "Without you being around for me
then, who knows where I would be today?"</TE>
<TE>   Joyce Lockridge, 63, who worked as a teacher at 112th Street
School from 1960 to 1978, organized the event along with Ann Bouie,
another former teacher.</TE>
<TE>   "I enjoyed teaching, but the years brought on more trials," she
said. "The world changed, and so did the children."</TE>
<TE>   Parents became less supportive, and drugs infiltrated the
neighborhood, she said.</TE>
<TE>   But it satisfied her Saturday to talk to students who had grown up
and become successful.</TE>
<TE>   Chris Jackson Sr., 36, a former student, graduated from 112th
Street and went on to junior high and high school in Los Angeles
Unified. He is now a vice president at a local branch of Primerica
Financial Services.</TE>
<TE>   The teachers "used to tell me, 'You can be whatever you want to
be,' " he said. "That was important to me."</TE>
<TE>   Mae Zentmyer, 87, was there on Saturday because the reunion
signified an unforgettable part of her past, she said. As one of a
handful of white staff members at 112th Street, which at the time had
mostly African American students and teachers, Zentmyer said the
school became her family. There were days when Zentmyer sang "We
Shall Overcome" during the civil rights era "harder than anybody,"
she said.</TE>
<TE>   "The teachers bonded so much, it didn't matter what race we were,"
she said. "We were all in this together, helping the children."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Prosecutors dropped all charges against a recent Palo Alto high
school graduate after DNA test results proved that he did not rape a
94-year-old woman.</LD>
<LD>   Jorge Hernandez, 18, was told he could go home Friday. He had been
held in Santa Clara County jail in lieu of $1-million bail and faced
up to life in prison after being arrested July 18 on suspicion of
rape and sodomy.</LD>
<LD>   "There is an ongoing investigation to determine the identity of
the perpetrator and to determine if Mr. Hernandez was in any way
involved with the crime," said prosecutor Brian Welch.</LD>
<TE>   Hernandez was charged with attacking the woman, a resident of an
assisted-living home two blocks from his house. Police recovered a
ring with the name "Edwin" engraved inside. It had been ripped off
the attacker's hand during the struggle May 6.</TE>

<BD>From Times Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A state disciplinary board for dentists has experienced lengthy
delays in concluding cases because of staff vacancies, poor
record-keeping and poor management, an independent analysis ordered
by state lawmakers found.</LD>
<LD>   The Legislature removed the entire membership of the Dental Board
of California last year amid allegations that it was not doing enough
to discipline dentists. The analysis by two outside consultants was
ordered at the same time.</LD>
<LD>   A draft report submitted Friday to the board's new members in San
Francisco verifies lawmakers' fears, said state Sen. Liz Figueroa
(D-Fremont), who sponsored the legislation.</LD>

<HD>Valley Council and Mayoral Candidates Mingle at Rally</HD>
<DH>Secession: At first organized cityhood campaign event,
hopefuls plot strategy.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SHARON BERNSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Real estate agent Mel Wilson, a candidate for mayor of the San
Fernando Valley city should it be established next fall, gathered
about 200 people around him in the searing summer heat and told the
story of David and Goliath.</LD>
<LD>   The supporters of Valley cityhood who had squeezed under the
awning of a Van Nuys hotel understood his message: that the battle
ahead would be an uphill one.</LD>
<LD>   "David picked up that rock," Wilson said. "And he knocked down
that big giant. That big giant of city hall and big unions."</LD>
<TE>   The crowd, consisting mostly of candidates for a Valley city
council and mayor and their families, cheered. Then its members went
inside for muffins, coffee and the first organizational cityhood
campaign rally.</TE>
<TE>   In a donated ballroom festooned with balloons and bunting,
candidates networked, passing out lawn signs, business cards and
campaign buttons.</TE>
<TE>   All told, there are 121 candidates for mayor and council in the
proposed Valley city, which would have 14 council districts and an
elected mayor.</TE>
<TE>   Most say they do not expect to raise much money for their
campaigns, which must focus as much on support for cityhood as on
individual races--after all, it is in the nature of this odd campaign
that, unless a Valley city is created in November, there will be no
offices to hold. To be created, a Valley city must win the support of
majorities of voters, both in the Valley and citywide.</TE>
<TE>   Assemblyman Keith Richman (R-Northridge), a physician and
businessman who is running for Valley mayor while also serving his
first term, said his experience in founding and running one of the
state's largest medical groups qualifies him to help set up and run a
new city.</TE>
<TE>   If elected, Richman said, he would put more officers on the
streets, cut business taxes in half and provide better city services.
The candidate, who raised the concern of neighborhood groups when he
supported the controversial Ahmanson Ranch housing project, said he
was rethinking that position.</TE>
<TE>   Richman said he would work to improve the business climate in the
Valley and would bring back community policing.</TE>
<TE>   Until Wilson's entry this week, Richman was the clear front-runner
in the race. He remains the only candidate with a sophisticated
political organization and fund-raising apparatus.</TE>
<TE>   But Wilson, the former president of the United Chambers of
Commerce of the San Fernando Valley, is the only candidate who has
longtime ties to the Valley business establishment, whose members
have backed the cityhood campaign all along.</TE>
<TE>   If elected, Wilson said, he would support neighborhood councils
like those mandated by recent charter reforms in Los Angeles. But
while L.A.'s neighborhood councils are only advisory, Wilson
envisions giving them decision-making power in a new city.</TE>
<TE>   Wilson said he would reduce business taxes and support keeping the
Los Angeles Police Department as the police force for the new city.</TE>
<TE>   As the most prominent Democrat running in a mostly Democratic
region, Wilson said he hopes to raise between $400,000 and $500,000
for his campaign. Cityhood backers, who have supported Richman's
candidacy, were jubilant when Wilson entered the race.</TE>
<TE>   "Did you hear that Mel Wilson filed his papers?" asked a secession
backer, Richard Leyner, himself a past president of the United
Chambers and a candidate for a Valley city council seat. "He's a
beautiful guy."</TE>
<TE>   Richman cited his own history of civic involvement in the Valley,
and said that he had always expected the race to be competitive.</TE>
<TE>   "We're going to run a very hard campaign," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Wilson's entry into the race coincided with the first public
appearance at a secession rally by one Valley business leader, Bert
Boeckmann, who has kept out of the limelight and, despite early
financial support for the effort to put cityhood before voters, had
not taken a firm stand in favor of secession.</TE>
<TE>   On Saturday, Boeckmann appeared to be throwing his support to the
cityhood crowd.</TE>
<TE>   "I love Los Angeles, and I love the San Fernando Valley," said
Boeckmann, a conservative who owns Galpin Ford in North Hills, the
nation's largest Ford dealership. "I have always felt that they would
be better managed if they were two cities."</TE>
<TE>   But Wilson's entry into the race seemed to complicate matters for
Boeckmann, as it has for other secession backers. The auto dealer had
earlier agreed to hold a campaign event for Richman, but on Saturday
he said he would hold events and give support to more than one
candidate.</TE>
<TE>   Another key candidate for the mayoral post is Benny Bernal, a
school bus driver and union activist from Mission Hills.</TE>
<TE>   Bernal said that, if elected, he would work to make sure union
members and other workers were well represented. He also promised to
improve public transportation in the Valley, where buses are
infrequent and the subway ends at North Hollywood, miles from the
northeast or western parts of the region.</TE>
<TE>   Mayoral candidate David Raymond Hernandez Jr., an insurance
adjuster from Valley Village, said he would focus on transportation
and health care. As mayor, Hernandez said, he would use the city's
influence to improve Olive View Medical Center, a Los Angeles County
facility in Sylmar.</TE>
<TE>   Hernandez, who is the Republican candidate against Howard Berman
in the East Valley's 28th Congressional District, said he thinks of
himself as "extremely moderate to liberal" politically.</TE>
<TE>   Mayoral candidate Marc Strassman of Valley Village said he does
not expect to raise much money for what some might say was a quixotic
campaign. Instead, Strassman said, he hopes to be elected by dint of
his ideas, which he plans to disseminate on the Internet.</TE>
<TE>   The fast-talking Internet consultant wasn't impressed with all the
networking and politicking at Saturday's event.</TE>
<TE>   "It's all relationships," he groused. "I had hoped to talk about
the issues."</TE>

<HD>Retired Teachers Report for Playground Duty</HD>
<DH>Recreation: Assisted by other senior volunteers, they've
kept a Garden Grove schoolyard open for the summer.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MILTON CARRERO GALARZA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Driving by the Garden Grove apartment complex teeming with children,
Barbara Barker was struck by a depressing sight: a gated school
playground.</LD>
<LD>   For years, the field at Brookhurst School had been locked during
the summer months and on weekends.</LD>
<LD>   What a waste, Barker thought: empty swings, a gated
playground--and so many kids.</LD>
<TE>   Along with other volunteers, mostly retired teachers like herself,
Barker, 67, earlier this year persuaded the city to open the
playground and then organized a summer program on Tuesdays and
Thursdays that helps pry children away from television sets and video
games.</TE>
<TE>   "Everybody agreed it was a good idea," said Leon Raya, Garden
Grove recreation supervisor. But the city lacked the money to fund
such a program, let alone pay for the personnel to watch over the
playground.</TE>
<TE>   "But they brought the resources and the volunteers," Raya said.</TE>
<TE>   With assists from the city, the Malabar apartment complex and the
Garden Grove Unified School District, the group of volunteers, who
range in age from 66 to 81, organized the Brookhurst Kids Passport to
Fun. The result is a program that volunteers say rejuvenates them
while teaching more than 30 youths about other cultures through
music, crafts and games.</TE>
<TE>   At times, the volunteers struggle to keep up with the 6- to
12-year-olds, especially when they square off for an occasional
kickball game.</TE>
<TE>   "I get awfully tired," Arla Donohew, 77, said while watching the
kids play. "But it really is fun."</TE>
<TE>   "It's kind of exciting when you are around children," added
Barbara Shirley, 75. "It makes you have to think young."</TE>
<TE>   The activities, from designing Faberge eggs to booting around a
soccer ball, are part of a multicultural theme designed to appeal to
the diverse neighborhood.</TE>
<TE>   Parents are asked to pay $15 to defray the cost of art supplies
for the summer.</TE>
<TE>   While the effort has opened the playground, it has not attracted
as many children from the nearby apartment complex as the volunteers
had hoped. Barker is hopeful other parents will be drawn to the
program once school starts, since the volunteers plan to continue
their efforts on weekends. Still, the retired teachers feel a sense
of success.</TE>
<TE>   "A kid doesn't care how old you are or the color of your hair,"
Raya said. "They care about whether or not you care."</TE>

<HD>Simon Describes His Anchor</HD>
<DH>Politics: GOP candidate says faith and family support him.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MATEA GOLD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN DIEGO</DL>
<LD>It was the end of another long day on the campaign trail for Bill
Simon Jr., at the end of what has been a very long month.</LD>
<LD>   Over the course of four weeks, California's GOP gubernatorial
nominee has taken a beating about his tax returns and business
dealings, his family investment firm has been hit with a
multimillion-dollar fraud judgment, and Vice President Dick Cheney
swung through California without publicly offering his fellow
Republican a word of support.</LD>
<LD>   For Simon, however, there was refuge late last week in a familiar
ritual, one he rarely discusses but often practices. He prayed.</LD>
<TE>   "If I didn't have my wife and my kids and my faith to go home to,
I don't know what I'd do," Simon said in an uncharacteristically
personal interview Thursday evening, sipping a Diet Coke as he sat by
a pool at his hotel. "I think I would feel very empty and depressed.
Those are anchors for me."</TE>
<TE>   Reflecting on recent events in his campaign, Simon said that faith
has helped sustain him, even as he has been pummeled up and down
California with questions about taxes and lawsuits and GOP politics.</TE>
<TE>   "I have a very, very strong belief in God, a very strong belief in
human nature, and a very strong belief that if you try to do the
right thing, that it's not going to be like God's going to pay you
back, but you'll end up in a good place," he said. Simon added that
he prays every day and reads the Bible regularly.</TE>
<TE>   Those close to him say that Simon's religious convictions have
allowed him to put into perspective the series of frustrating turns
in the campaign.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it probably brings him back to what is really most
important in life," said Msgr. Lloyd Torgerson, Simon's pastor at St.
Monica Catholic Church. "Ultimately and finally, it's not about
prestige and power. What really matters is, he has a faith in God,
and he has people around him who care about him."</TE>
<TE>   Former Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan, a fellow parishioner at
St. Monica's, was tough on Simon during the gubernatorial primary,
once calling him a "sanctimonious hypocrite."</TE>
<TE>   Riordan Sympathetic</TE>
<TE>   Last week, however, Riordan sympathized with Simon and said he
believed his former rival's faith was helping him: "There are things
much more important in his life than all these grenades being thrown
at him."</TE>
<TE>   For Simon, those grenades have seemed to keep coming. Just as
he had appeared to conclude a round of questions about his personal
taxes, which he reluctantly made briefly available to reporters, he
was forced on the defensive again when a jury found that his family
investment firm had defrauded a former business partner.</TE>
<TE>   The subject dogged Simon on the campaign trail all last week, but
he managed to look upbeat, patiently answering questions about the
litigation at every stop. During a speech to the Oakland Metropolitan
Chamber of Commerce on Wednesday, Simon spoke about the need for
class-action reform, then added with a chuckle: "God knows I know a
little bit about litigation recently."</TE>
<TE>   "I think he believes [the verdict] was unfair, and he believes it
will be overturned, and that's where his faith comes into play," said
a friend, Stephen Kaplan. "A lot of people might be depressed and
say, 'Why is this happening to me?' Bill keeps moving forward."</TE>
<TE>   Simon said his conviction that there is a larger purpose at work
has kept him from feeling dismayed.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a bigger plan, and it may be you don't always know what
the future will hold," he said. "Not everything is bottled up in one
event. If things don't go well on Thursday, things could turn around
on Friday."</TE>
<TE>   For Simon, those notions are deeply felt but rarely expressed,
except to those closest to him. Indeed, several friends said last
week that they were surprised he had spoken to a reporter about them.</TE>
<TE>   Throughout nearly a year of campaigning, first in the Republican
primary and now as the party's nominee for governor, Simon has almost
never mentioned his religious beliefs, except in response to direct
questions.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, he often seems to go out of his way to avoid the
topic--perhaps in recognition that some tenets of his faith are at
odds with the California electorate.</TE>
<TE>   Abortion Question</TE>
<TE>   Simon, for instance, shares the Catholic Church's official
opposition to abortion, but most California voters do not, and Simon
has tried to neutralize that issue by saying, repeatedly, that he
would uphold California's legal protection of abortion.</TE>
<TE>   Other issues with religious overtones periodically crop up on the
campaign as well. At a reception with Latino supporters in San Diego
on Thursday evening, he dodged a question from a woman who said she
was upset about the recent appellate court ruling against the use of
the words "under God" in the Pledge of Allegiance and the prohibition
on teaching religion in public schools.</TE>
<TE>   "The best thing we can do is focus on the fundamentals," Simon
said, stressing the importance of reading, math and science.</TE>
<TE>   But those who know him say it is evident that his faith shapes him
profoundly, especially when it comes to his charitable giving, and
that it is helping him weather the rigors of a political campaign.</TE>
<TE>   'Source of Strength'</TE>
<TE>   "I have no question that it's a source of strength for him," said
a friend and neighbor, John Morrissey.</TE>
<TE>   As Simon reads and rereads the Bible, he said, he is particularly
moved by Proverbs, the Old Testament collection of wisdom, much of it
taken from Solomon, the son of David. In them, the faithful are urged
to honor God, to learn justice and wisdom, to turn from evil and to
resist pride.</TE>
<TE>   Reflecting on those texts, Simon said he is continually struck by
the range of life that they convey. Moreover, he said, he often
reflects on the lives of David and Solomon, whose stories Simon said
resonate strongly with him.</TE>
<TE>   "There's ones where he's saying to God, 'Boy oh boy, why did you
do this to me?' And then there's other ones where he's doing great,"
Simon said. "You can kind of see the ups and the downs."</TE>

<HD>Oxnard District Could Revive K-8 Schools</HD>
<DH>Education: New campus may be site of a pilot program
intended to improve behavior and achievement.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENIFER RAGLAND</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Driven by a desire to boost academic achievement and improve behavior
among middle school students, Oxnard educators are considering a
pilot program in which teenagers would attend the same school as
kindergartners.</LD>
<LD>   Oxnard Elementary School District trustees last week reviewed a
study that recommends making at least one school a campus for
kindergartners through eighth-graders in a trial program that could
lead to other conversions. The panel asked for a more detailed report
to review by next month.</LD>
<LD>   The move reflects a growing trend throughout the nation toward
reviving the K-8 school, which 50 years ago dominated the public
education landscape but now takes a distant back seat to the
stand-alone middle school. The change was fueled by population growth
in the 1960s as well as educators' belief at the time that
adolescents could be better served on a separate campus.</LD>
<TE>   That opinion, however, is shifting again as many public school
districts are realizing the benefits--both in the classroom and on
the playground--of children staying in the same school for nine years
instead of six or seven.</TE>
<TE>   "It's been referred to as 'back to the future,' " said Ernie
Morrison, principal of Lemonwood School in Oxnard and chairman of a
committee that studied the concept. "The K-8 structure was the real
approach many years ago when communities were small."</TE>
<TE>   The committee, a task force made up mostly of parents, recommended
implementing the K-8 model at Thurgood Marshall School, a campus
scheduled to open in fall 2003.</TE>
<TE>   Board members liked the concept but wanted specifics on cost and
other concerns before approving the plan.</TE>
<TE>   Oxnard Supt. Richard Duarte proposed the K-8 idea in February. He
said research has shown that students, especially those at the
socially vulnerable middle school age, perform better when they feel
connected to their school.</TE>
<TE>   But that can be difficult in Oxnard, where middle school students
attend a separate campus for only two years and the largest school
has nearly 1,200 students. A K-8 school, conversely, would have only
about 120 students of middle school age.</TE>
<TE>   "The more years you can have a group of kids with a group of
teachers, the better it's going to be, and K-8 schools have a great
feeling of community," Morrison said. "Working in smaller groups, you
are able to get more done."</TE>
<TE>   Morrison's committee visited half a dozen K-8 schools around
Southern California. Task force members said they were struck by the
quiet that marked the campuses and the few number of students seen
awaiting discipline in principals' offices.</TE>
<TE>   Although younger and older students rarely mingle on a K-8
campus--each having separate restrooms, lunch areas and
playgrounds--the mere presence of youngsters seemed to encourage
teens to act as role models, Morrison said.</TE>
<TE>   Jimmy McAuley, father of two children in Oxnard schools, said he
hopes the district will offer the program. As a security guard at
Frank Intermediate School, McAuley said he has seen firsthand the
fights that can erupt from too many adolescents on one campus.</TE>
<TE>   "In a K-8 school, the older siblings can really look after the
younger siblings," he said. "It's safer."</TE>
<TE>   If board members approve the plan, Thurgood Marshall would become
one of only a few schools in Ventura County serving children in
grades K-8. There are now K-8 schools in Camarillo, Santa Paula and
Somis.</TE>
<TE>   But the format, popular among private schools, is more common in
public schools elsewhere. The Los Angeles Unified School District has
about a dozen K-8 schools, and the Paramount Unified School District,
north of Long Beach, recently converted all 14 of its elementary
schools to also serve seventh- and eighth-graders. Overcrowding in
the district's two middle schools--as many as 1,600 were enrolled on
each campus--prompted the configuration change, said Susan Lance, an
assistant superintendent.</TE>
<TE>   "The result has been a wonderful familial atmosphere at each one
of the K-8 schools," she said. "We've also seen a significant
decrease in the number of crimes."</TE>
<TE>   While research is inconclusive on which grade groupings are best
for maximized learning, a few studies have shown that middle school
students in a K-8 model perform better in reading, math and science
than those in a traditional two- or three-year intermediate school.</TE>
<TE>   But not all parents in Oxnard like the idea. Diane Pretzer, with
one child at Haydock Intermediate School, said putting kindergartners
and eighth-graders on the same campus seems to be a logistical
nightmare that could take away from the school's job of educating
youngsters.</TE>
<TE>   Pretzer added that she believes middle school is an important
steppingstone that builds maturity on the way to high school.</TE>

<LD>Authorities on Saturday were investigating the death of a 33-year-old
inmate in the Ventura County Jail.</LD>
<LD>   The Oxnard man, who was not identified pending notification of his
family, was awaiting trial in October on charges of robbery and
assault with a deadly weapon, authorities said. He had been
incarcerated since March, according to Sgt. Arnie Aviles of the
Ventura County Sheriff's Department.</LD>
<LD>   The inmate was found in his bed at 11:15 a.m. Saturday by
deputies, who had attempted to awaken him for a meal. During a
routine check about an hour earlier, Aviles said, deputies reported
seeing the inmate sleeping and heard him snoring.</LD>
<TE>   Revival efforts by jail staff members, paramedics and Ventura
firefighters failed, and he was pronounced dead at Ventura County
Medical Center at 12:47 p.m., authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   "There was no sign of suicide or foul play," Aviles said.</TE>

<HD>The 40% Solution for IDEA</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WILLIAM M. HABERMEHL</AU>
<BD>William M. Habermehl is Orange County superintendent of
schools.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Congress is once again agonizing over funding for special education,
specifically the budget for IDEA, the Individuals with Disabilities
Act.</LD>
<LD>   Three decades have passed since Public Law 94-142 promised a
comprehensive education for disabled children between the ages of 3
and 22. It was a meritorious pledge, but our representatives were
forced to face that this is a costly program that requires specially
designed buses, specially trained teachers and small class sizes.</LD>
<LD>   When Congress passed the law mandating these services in 1975, it
committed to paying up to 40% of the excess cost. This year the
federal government is paying 18% of the expenses, the highest
percentage since the inception of the program.</LD>
<TE>   As a result of the federal funding shortfall, each year Orange
County schools must take $90 million from regular education programs,
money that could be used to hire 1,800 new teachers, reduce class
size, build seven neighborhood schools or provide students with
53,000 new computers.</TE>
<TE>   Those hijacked funds could be used to buy new textbooks; increase
the number of field trips; buy art supplies; hire music, art or
science specialists; and make the difference between a good education
and a great education.</TE>
<TE>   No one denies that children with exceptional needs deserve an
optimum education to capitalize on their strengths. The success of
this nation is dependent on having the best-educated populace in the
world. That requires an outstanding instructional program and highly
qualified teachers for every child, including those with special
needs. The issue is, who pays?</TE>
<TE>   Ways to Cut Costs</TE>
<TE>   Special education costs can be reduced without compromising the
quality and breadth of service provided, but Congress ignored most of
the potential cost-saving when it reauthorized the law in 1997. Some
of those savings include requiring mandatory mediation before any
administration hearing; reducing the participation of attorneys in
the hearing process; returning the cost of providing health care for
special education students to health-care agencies; and reducing the
amount of required paperwork.</TE>
<TE>   This year and next, our representatives and their colleagues in
Washington will again address reauthorization of IDEA. The Orange
County Department of Education will be there, working with our
representatives to reduce the cost without cutting necessary services
to our children.</TE>
<TE>   Close to 10% of our county's 505,000 K-12 public school students
are diagnosed for special education placement. For those children
with mild disabilities, placement is often within their local school
districts in special classes or, as appropriate, in "full inclusion"
settings.</TE>
<TE>   An example of full inclusion is the award-winning Deaf and Hard of
Hearing Program operated by the O.C. Department of Education.
Students in grades six to 12 attend Irvine's Venado Middle School and
University High School, where they are enrolled in classes with the
regular education students; participate in extracurricular
activities, including football and track; and are often in Advanced
Placement classes. Visitors are amazed to see a U.S. history class at
"Uni High" with two teachers--one lecturing, the other signing.</TE>
<TE>   O.C.'s Experience</TE>
<TE>   Orange County school districts and the Department of Education are
working to control costs for special education students while
continuing to provide them with a solid education. Severely disabled
children, ages 3 through 21, are often taught on shared-site
campuses, usually under the auspices of the department. One distinct
advantage is the financial savings that come from the economy of
scale, but an equally important advantage is the breadth of
experience that is possible when children of vastly disparate
physical abilities share the same school sites.</TE>
<TE>   What can we do? Every one of us can call or write our Washington
representatives at their local offices. Their numbers can be found in
the front of the telephone directory. Tell them we have had enough.
As Orange County taxpayers, we receive only 88 cents back for every
dollar we send to Washing- ton.</TE>
<TE>   But the need for special education funding reform is not a ploy to
close that financial chasm. It is a firm request to our legislators
to do what is fair and right for all our children. Congress must live
up to its promise to pay up to 40% of the costs of providing special
education services, freeing up the $90 million annually the children
of Orange County deserve.</TE>
<TE>   Our children have been paying the price for almost 30 years for
Congressional reluctance to act responsibly. How much longer can we
expect them to wait?</TE>

<SE></SE>
<AU>STEVE SMITH</AU>
<BD>Steve Smith is a freelance writer who lives in Costa
Mesa.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Over the years, my wife and I have found summer road trips to be a
good time to measure our children's progress. Away from the pressures
of school and friends, our kids let their hair down and their real
personalities emerge. The bickering ceases and they slow down, think
more and talk in paragraphs.</LD>
<LD>   On a recent long-weekend trip to Mammoth Lakes, we took Highway
395 and went through Kramer Junction and Lone Pine. We stopped at
what seemed to be every beef jerky shop along the way in an effort to
find the world's finest. The winner and still champion--at least
until our upcoming trip to San Francisco--is the shop on the north
end of Bishop.</LD>
<LD>   We enjoy Highway 395 for the roller-coaster section and because
there is so much to see. The return from Mammoth included a planned
stop at the Manzanar site. It's hard to believe that President
Franklin Delano Roosevelt actually put his hand to the document that
sent U.S. citizens to concentration camps, but he did. When my son
asked me why people were taken away, all I could think was, "There
weren't enough people who cared."</LD>
<TE>   That trip gave us a lesson not only in history but also in civic
responsibility.</TE>
<TE>   Stopping along the way is important, not just for the sake of the
kids but also because it throws off the fast, city rhythm.</TE>
<TE>   A couple of years ago, we were passing through Oakhurst on the way
to Yosemite Valley. We spied a group of kids selling root beer floats
for a dollar. I bought one for each of us, not realizing that these
were to be our kids' first root beer floats. Those Oakhurst floats
rank as the best we've had.</TE>
<TE>   Yosemite is magical and, we believe, the most beautiful place on
Earth, or at least what we've seen of Earth.</TE>
<TE>   We become speechless each time we emerge from the Wawona tunnel to
enjoy the appearance of Half Dome, Bridalveil Fall and El Capitan.</TE>
<TE>   TVs, VCRs, DVD players and personal audio equipment are not
allowed on our road trips.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, we listen to books on tape and music, ranging from the
Beatles to Beethoven, that we all enjoy.</TE>
<TE>   On our Mammoth trip we listened to six hours of the old "Superman"
radio series, which was lent to me by a friend.</TE>
<TE>   Road trips are a time for bonding and for communicating. Families
discuss what is seen on the road, they eat fresh fruit from roadside
stands, and they discover what makes one another tick. It's hard to
chat with a child when pro wrestlers Undertaker and Kane are slamming
opponents into the canvas or Crash Bandicoot is acting squirrelly.</TE>
<TE>   Thirty-five years ago, my family took the first of many camping
trips. My mother's reason was that we needed to explore this great
state, but we all knew it was because she was deathly afraid of
flying. No matter, those trips rank as my best childhood memories. My
brother and I would sit for hours singing songs, playing cards and
games, reading or just looking out the window. And yes, we
occasionally asked, "Are we there yet?"</TE>
<TE>   Today, however, it seems as though families just want to separate
until the nasty driving part of the trip is done. It is those same
parents who insist on filling every spare moment of their child's
life with some sort of activity, lest they use that extra 20 minutes
to hold up a convenience store or get hooked on heroin. That's too
bad; those miles are an excellent opportunity to learn and love. I am
sorry that the video families won't discover the bonding a road trip
brings.</TE>
<TE>   So here are our summer travel tips:</TE>
<TE>   Start your vacation when you leave your front door; break up your
trip into two- or three-hour segments so you have time to stop and
smell the Joshua trees; leave the home theater at home; and, if you
believe you've found the perfect beef jerky, please let us
know--we'll use any excuse to hit the road.</TE>

<HD>Afghan Blast Described as Accident</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>JALALABAD, Afghanistan</DL>
<LD>A preliminary investigation indicates that a deadly warehouse
explosion that destroyed dozens of homes on the outskirts of this
eastern Afghan city was an accident and not an act of terrorism, the
foreign minister said Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   The head of the construction company that owned the warehouse said
the building housed explosives for road building.</LD>
<LD>   Foreign Minister Abdullah, meeting with reporters in Kabul, the
capital, said authorities would look at what negligence may have been
involved in Friday's blast. "There might have been some mistakes in
maintaining the amount of explosives that were kept in reserve in
that building," he said.</LD>
<TE>   Reports on the death toll varied widely Saturday. Afghan national
television reported 25 dead late Friday; hospital officials and
police said 14 had been killed. In addition to the dead, about 90
people were injured.</TE>
<TE>   Abdullah's statements followed 24 hours of speculation among
police and military officials that the warehouse might have been
blown up by terrorists to damage a nearby hydroelectric dam and the
Jalalabad power system. The speculation reflected the nervousness
about terrorism in post-Taliban Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   The midday blast destroyed about 50 houses and damaged the power
system of the Darunta hydroelectric dam, just 200 yards from the
warehouse, knocking out city power until early Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   All that remained of the Afghan Construction and Logistics Unit
warehouse was piles of brick and machinery.</TE>
<TE>   Houses in all directions were leveled or burned by the blast. The
explosion also blew out windows and doors at a nearby Jalalabad
University building.</TE>
<TE>   The company director, Mohammed Karim, said the facility housed 20
pounds of a manufactured explosive, Vibox--seemingly too little to
cause such devastation. But he also said an unspecified amount of
urea, a fertilizer material that can be used to make explosives, was
stored there.</TE>

<LD>As Zimbabwe's white farmers waited for President Robert Mugabe's next
step in a 2-year-old effort to drive them from their land, a new
support group estimated that 60% were defying eviction orders.</LD>
<LD>   About 2,900 of the country's 4,500 white commercial farmers were
supposed to have surrendered their farms without compensation to
landless blacks by Thursday or face jail.</LD>
<LD>   Jenni Williams of the Justice for Agriculture group said Saturday
that 40% of targeted farmers, or about 1,160, had left their land.</LD>
<TE>   There have been no reports of action by authorities, violence or
evictions since the deadline passed.</TE>

<LD>At least 75 people were killed in fighting last week in northeastern
Congo, the United Nations said. Many were women and children who were
hacked to death.</LD>
<LD>   The clashes involving tribal militias, a rebel group and the
Ugandan army flared in a local turf war within a four-year conflict
that has left an estimated 2 million people dead. A pit containing 38
hacked-up bodies--including 13 women and four children--was found
Friday near the town of Bunia, U.N. officials said. Thirty-seven
bodies were discovered near the town after fighting Thursday.</LD>

<LD>Slobodan Milosevic's party has started gathering signatures to
nominate him for the presidency of Serbia, even though he is on trial
for war crimes and is in ill health.</LD>
<LD>   The former Yugoslav leader, who served two terms as Serbia's
president in the 1990s, is barred from running again by the
constitution. Serbs will vote for a new president Sept. 29, the first
time since reformers toppled Milosevic in 2000.</LD>
<LD>   Branko Ruzic, a vice president of the Socialist Party of Serbia,
said the required 10,000 signatures would be submitted to Serbia's
Electoral Commission on Tuesday.</LD>

<LD>   The Education Ministry said about 139,000 elementary and junior
high school students did not attend classes for at least 30
consecutive days. That was a more than 3% increase from the 2000-01
academic year.</LD>
<LD>   The truancy report came days after the National Police Agency said
crime reached a record level in the first half of the year, with
nearly 1.4 million crimes reported between January and June.</LD>

<LD>A 2-year-old girl fell from her parents' car onto a busy motorway in
southern France and survived with just scratches after a truck braked
and blocked the road to stop her from being run over, Germany's Bild
newspaper reported.</LD>
<LD>   The girl, from Mainz, Germany, freed herself from her car seat and
pulled the door handle, plunging from the vehicle, then going 68 mph
on the road between Avignon and Lyon. "It was a horrible sight. The
little body falling onto the road, bouncing and then rolling over
again and again," said truck driver Nicolas Laberthonniere, whose
quick action saved the girl.</LD>

<HD>Bush Insists He Has 'No Timetable' for War on Terrorism in
Iraq</HD>
<DH>Policy: The vacationing president vows to keep seeking
allies' support for the ouster of Hussein.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EDWIN CHEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>CRAWFORD, Texas</DL>
<LD>President Bush declared Iraq "an enemy until proven otherwise"
Saturday but said he has "no timetable" for taking the war on
terrorism to Baghdad to bring about a regime change in the oil-rich
nation.</LD>
<LD>   Bush nevertheless ardently underscored his oft-declared desire to
oust Iraqi President Saddam Hussein and said he intends to keep
making the case to U.S. allies.</LD>
<LD>   The president made his comments after teeing off for an early
morning round of golf at a country club in Waco, not far from his
ranch here, where he is taking a monthlong working vacation.</LD>
<TE>   His remarks came after a spate of recent reports of competing
military tactics to accomplish his goal--information leaked to the
press that has greatly annoyed the White House.</TE>
<TE>   Even as most lawmakers of both parties in Washington are backing
Bush's aim, his hope of unseating Hussein faces strong resistance not
only from Arab nations but also from many U.S. allies in Europe, who
fear that it could destabilize the Persian Gulf region and cause
serious rifts in the anti-terrorism coalition.</TE>
<TE>   Standing under an overcast sky in a purple-striped shirt,
light-colored pants and a baseball hat, Bush recalled that in his
last State of the Union address, he described Iraq, along with Iran
and North Korea, as belonging to an "axis of evil" that seeks to
obtain, and perhaps use, weapons of mass destruction.</TE>
<TE>   He then said of Hussein: "I presume that he still views us as an
enemy. I have constantly said that we owe it to our children, and our
children's children, to free the world from weapons of mass
destruction in the hands of those who hate freedom. This is a man who
has poisoned his own people. I mean, he's had a history of tyranny."</TE>
<TE>   The president took exception to a reporter's question based on the
premise that he has been unable to attract "more support within the
region and within Europe for taking action."</TE>
<TE>   "I think most people understand he is a danger," Bush said.</TE>
<TE>   He also said that consultations he is having--with members of
Congress as well as foreign leaders--are "a positive part of really
allowing people to fully understand our deep concern about this man,
his regime and his desire to have weapons of mass destruction."</TE>
<TE>   It was in response to a question about whether the American public
is prepared for U.S. casualties in Iraq that Bush sought to play down
the notion that a military strike is near.</TE>
<TE>   That question, the president said, "presumes there's some kind of
imminent war plan. As I said, I have no timetable."</TE>
<TE>   He added: "What I do believe the American people understand is
that weapons of mass destruction in the hands of leaders such as
Saddam Hussein are very dangerous for ourselves, our allies. They
understand the concept of blackmail. They know that when we speak of
making the world more safe, we do so not only in the context of Al
Qaeda and other terrorist groups but nations that have proven
themselves to be bad neighbors and bad actors."</TE>
<TE>   Also Saturday, six Iraqi opposition leaders gathered in Washington
for a teleconference with Vice President Dick Cheney, who is
vacationing at his home in Jackson Hole, Wyo.</TE>
<TE>   "We are very optimistic that [the Bush administration] will do
something to effect regime change," Sharif Ali bin Hussein, who is
associated with both the Iraqi National Congress and the
Constitutional Monarchy Movement, told reporters after the call. "We
are working with them to facilitate that, because ultimately the U.S.
did agree with us that it was up to the Iraqi people."</TE>
<TE>   In Waco, near the end of Bush's brief encounter with reporters,
the president demonstrated once more the balance he is currently
maintaining between work and play.</TE>
<TE>   Seeking to get on with his golf game, he quipped: "Last question,
and then I've got to go chip and putt for a birdie."</TE>
<TE>   In Kennebunkport, Maine, last weekend, Bush was also on the golf
course, preparing for another round, when he angrily condemned the
latest violence in Israel and then said in the very next breath:
"Watch this drive."</TE>

<LD>Britain's Prince Charles, lover of all things natural, will launch
his own line of country clothing to help revive the rural economy,
the Sunday Times reported.</LD>
<LD>   The royal fashion label will use only wool supplied by British
sheep farmers, and the products will be made in rural workshops, the
paper said.</LD>
<LD>   It quoted an informed source as saying the project was motivated
by Charles' "deep sense of obligation" to tackle the crisis in
agriculture.</LD>
<TE>   Britain's agricultural industry was ravaged by last year's foot
and mouth epidemic.</TE>

<DL>CAIRO</DL>
<LD>Twenty-two members of an Egyptian clan died Saturday when another
family apparently mounted a revenge attack for the killing of a
relative.</LD>
<LD>   Members of the Hunayshat family were ambushed by gunmen as they
traveled in a minibus and a car from their village of Beit Allam to a
court hearing in nearby Sohag province, about 250 miles south of
Cairo, police said. The hearing involved two Hunayshat clansmen who
are facing charges of murdering a member of the Abdel Halim family in
April, security sources said.</LD>
<LD>   An Interior Ministry statement, carried by Egypt's Middle East
News Agency, confirmed the 22 deaths.</LD>
<TE>   At least two others were reported injured. The gunmen escaped into

sparks protests nationwide from people concerned for their privacy.</DH>

<DL>TOKYO</DL>
<LD>Akiko Tsuji, a 24-year-old businesswoman, hates having to renew her
driver's license, get a passport or register an address change.
Simple procedures in Japan often involve visiting several offices,
and it's difficult to take time off from work, forcing her to go
Saturday--with everyone else.</LD>
<LD>   She's exactly the type of computer-literate citizen the government
wants to win over to its new citizens registry network. More than 90
procedures will be conducted with the click of a mouse, bureaucrats
promise, as soon as everyone starts using an 11-digit identification
number.</LD>
<LD>   This sales job isn't working very well on Tsuji, however.</LD>
<TE>   "I'm really concerned about my privacy," she said. "I believe
there's a chance the government could abuse my information, maybe
sell it--who knows?"</TE>
<TE>   Six days after the launch of the controversial system, the
national response has been underwhelming. A major fear is that Big
Brother may be lurking behind the shoji screen.</TE>
<TE>   "The state will become a stalker," social critic Makoto Sataka
said.</TE>
<TE>   On Monday, one citizens group is planning a rip-up-your-ID rally.
That will follow anonymous threats sent to the ministry in charge of
implementing the registry system and street protests. One of several
letters on the issue sent to Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi was
accompanied by several shotgun shells and a curt, rudely worded
message.</TE>
<TE>   Some have even compared the initiative to another recent step the
government took, giving Japan's cattle population bar codes as a way
to track "mad cow" disease. "10 digits for cows, 11 for people," read
one T-shirt distributed by citizen activist groups.</TE>
<TE>   "Everyone is upset at being arbitrarily numbered by the
government," said Eiji Yoshimura, a member of the Consumers Union of
Japan.</TE>
<TE>   Also fanning fears are reports on the experience in South Korea,
which computerized its 13-digit ID system in 1992.</TE>
<TE>   Japanese have learned that South Koreans are asked to enter their
numbers for access to pornographic Web sites. The numbers were also
used to track down 13,000 South Korean drivers, Japan's Asahi
newspaper reported, when the state health insurer informed the police
they'd been treated for mental illness. One taxi driver lost his
license and his job; another driver, his wife.</TE>
<TE>   The Japanese government, which is promoting the registry under its
"e-government" initiative, counters that people have nothing to fear.
Only a person's name, address, birth date and sex will be listed, at
least initially, while private data will be secure and computer
systems made hacker-proof, it says.</TE>
<TE>   Many Japanese are understandably skeptical. In 1999, information
on 220,000 people in Kyoto prefecture was stolen by a part-time
employee of a government subcontractor. In 2000, a Tokyo police
sergeant was arrested for leaking criminal records to a credit
research company.</TE>
<TE>   And in May, the Defense Agency was found to be keeping blacklists
on citizens who filed freedom of information requests, their legal
right.</TE>
<TE>   "A single system connecting tax, social security, pension and
personal data sounds efficient and helpful, but there's a huge
potential for abuse," said Hiroshi Yamada, the mayor of Tokyo's
Suginami ward, one of an estimated 100 local governments resisting
the so-called Juki Net. "Pretty soon they might be tempted to start
collecting information on which videos you're renting or whether
you've been reading Karl Marx."</TE>
<TE>   Critics also say the idea was imposed from above without much
public debate or effort to answer people's concerns.</TE>
<TE>   Even at face value, they say, it's unclear why the system is
needed, particularly in light of projected start-up costs of $347
million on top of annual operating costs of $165 million.</TE>
<TE>   The grass-roots resistance that's sprung up from tiny hamlets to
Yokohama, one of Japan's largest municipalities, has sent jitters
through a central government long used to having its edicts dutifully
followed.</TE>
<TE>   "It is illegal for a municipality to refuse to join the network,"
Chief Cabinet Secretary Yasuo Fukuda told reporters.</TE>
<TE>   The opposition has sent lawmakers scrambling to mollify critics,
beef up penalties for bureaucrats leaking information and push for
passage of a long-promised comprehensive privacy-protection law.
Government officials who leak personal information now face up to two
years in prison and an $8,700 fine.</TE>
<TE>   But the passage of a privacy law is unlikely until at least next
year. Furthermore, government officials are rarely sanctioned for
sharing information with companies, and the fine could prove a
relatively small deterrent as private firms salivate over this
treasure trove of marketing data.</TE>
<TE>   Hideaki Sakai, a 20-year-old college student, recently moved to
Tokyo from the countryside. Within days of his arrival, he says, junk
mail started arriving. Salesmen called him by name and even knew
where he was from.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a bit scary," he said. "Personally, I'm very happy
Suginami's mayor opposed the system."</TE>
<TE>   In addition to sporadic protests, the system's introduction Monday
was also attended by computer glitches, including one particularly
embarrassing case in which a local government sent supposedly
confidential information to the wrong people.</TE>
<TE>   Keiichi Niitsuma, 41, a self-employed Tokyo resident, said he
supports the network.</TE>
<TE>   "I think if there are enough penalties for leaking, it should be
fine," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the estimated 100 local governments dragging their heels,
out of 3,241 nationwide, say they'll comply when more secure privacy
protection is enacted.</TE>
<TE>   Activists say that even if the system goes fully into effect, as
is likely, the issue has sparked awareness of individual rights in a
country where citizens have rarely challenged governmental authority.</TE>
<TE>   "Having 100 local governments speak out is great," said Yoshiko
Sakurai, a journalist and citizens' activist. "When you consider
their relationship and how the central government provides a lot of
the local government's budget, that takes quite a bit of courage."</TE>

<HD>Indonesian Democracy Leaps Forward</HD>
<DH>Politics: Legislators approve direct elections for
president in 2004, cut the military's role in the assembly and reject
Islamic law.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>JAKARTA, Indonesia</DL>
<LD>In a major expansion of democracy, Indonesia's top legislature
amended the constitution Saturday to allow direct presidential
elections and end reserved seats in parliament for military
officials.</LD>
<LD>   Closing out its annual two-week session, the 700-member People's
Consultative Assembly also rejected calls to impose Islamic law in
the nation with the world's largest Muslim population.</LD>
<LD>   The assembly's decision to abolish its own role as an electoral
college that picks the head of state is considered the most important
government change since the 1960s, when Indonesia was shaken by
political unrest.</LD>
<TE>   When the assembly's speaker, Amien Rais, asked the delegates to
agree on a direct presidential ballot beginning with the 2004
election, they chorused: "Agreed."</TE>
<TE>   All the measures endorsed Saturday were adopted by consensus
rather than open ballot, after party leaders agreed that no faction
should be publicly seen to be defeated.</TE>
<TE>   Since Dutch colonial rule ended after World War II, the assembly
has elected the president for five-year terms. But legislators and
democracy groups have been pressing since 1998 for a direct vote of
the people in this nation of 228 million.</TE>
<TE>   Just after the assembly decided on the election issue, police
sprayed a water cannon on an estimated 500 students who were
protesting at the gates of parliament. It was unclear whether the
students--who largely support a direct presidential vote--were aware
of the decision to allow direct elections.</TE>
<TE>   The students later dispersed.</TE>
<TE>   Indonesia has a strong presidency, making Cabinet ministers
responsible to the president rather than parliament and giving the
president wide powers, including the right to regulate a wide range
of matters by decree.</TE>
<TE>   Gen. Suharto, who took the reins of power from Indonesia's
founding father, Sukarno, in 1966, abused the system by rigging six
consecutive presidential ballots starting in the early 1970s. He was
ousted in 1998 after widespread street protests.</TE>
<TE>   The constitutional amendment adopted Saturday sets up a two-stage
election for president, with a runoff required if no candidate wins a
majority in the first round.</TE>
<TE>   President Megawati Sukarnoputri, daughter of Sukarno, is widely
expected to seek and win reelection.</TE>
<TE>   Legislators also reached consensus on speeding up the abolition of
38 parliament seats reserved under Suharto for the security forces.
The seats will be eliminated in 2004 rather than 2009 as previously
planned.</TE>
<TE>   Hard-liners among the traditionally dominant army leadership
opposed the move, but reformers in the air force, navy and police
supported it.</TE>
<TE>   "This means that the military and police will be concentrating
more on professionalism," said Adm. Franky Kaihatu, a military
legislator.</TE>
<TE>   Two Muslim parties dropped their proposal for the adoption of
Islamic law. The idea faced strong opposition from secular parties as
well as the country's largest religious organizations.</TE>
<TE>   "We agreed that the article on the freedom of religion will remain
unchanged in the 1945 constitution," said Jusuf Muhammad, a leader of
the National Awakening Party, a moderate Muslim party that advocates
keeping Indonesia a secular state.</TE>
<TE>   The development was expected. A proposal to introduce Islamic law
has been on the agenda of every assembly session since Suharto's
overthrow, but it has never attracted significant support.</TE>
<TE>   More than 85% of Indonesians are Muslim, but the majority support
a secular government.</TE>

<HD>Paradise of Sunken Junk Pleases All Sides in Spain</HD>
<DH>Europe: Divers, anglers--and even environmentalists-- agree
that artificial reefs increase the appeal of the Mediterranean.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID HOLLEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>CARTAGENA, Spain</DL>
<LD>Old wooden minesweepers, worn-out fishing boats and concrete blocks
with protruding iron bars may not sound like the stuff of paradise.
But for fish along this stretch of Spain's Mediterranean coast,
that's what they are.</LD>
<LD>   And although they may clash over other coastal issues,
environmentalists, fishermen and divers like these underwater
obstacles and tourist attractions too. Most of them see benefits from
the European Union-backed effort to protect fish habitats and create
more attractive diving sites.</LD>
<LD>   The project didn't start out with such wide support. A decade ago,
when authorities launched the program to sink ships and concrete
blocks, primarily to rip apart fishing nets dragged illegally on the
ocean floor, Angel Gomez Gasco was one of many angry fishermen who
feared for their livelihoods. But now that they've seen the results,
he and many others have changed their minds.</LD>
<TE>   "Almost all of them support it now," said Gomez, head of the local
fishing association. "Fish look for shelter in these places and feel
protected there. For the fish, these places probably are little
paradises."</TE>
<TE>   That was the idea when the program got started in response to a
depletion of fish resources.</TE>
<TE>   Allowing the fish a sanctuary brings steadier incomes to fishermen
working coastal waters, because the fish are never wiped out. Some
are always wandering out from the artificial reefs, Gomez said, so
there is rarely any problem in catching enough to earn some money.</TE>
<TE>   "We've noted that we always have fish," he said. "I don't think
the number has increased drastically, but we always have fish."</TE>
<TE>   For recreational divers, the artificial reefs and sunken ships are
a more direct delight. Authorities knew how much divers enjoy
exploring shipwrecks, and they figured that divers would also
appreciate ships that were intentionally scuttled. Even the concrete
blocks win praise once they're covered with sea plants and swarming
with fish.</TE>
<TE>   "I wasn't sure what I thought of it at first," said Stan
Petitdemange, 25, a French diver working in the coastal resort town
of La Manga for the summer.</TE>
<TE>   "I was thinking 'artificial,' " he said. "But there are so many
fish hanging around these artificial reefs! And diving a wreck is
really nice. Especially on a shipwreck, you've got so many fish
hiding in it. It's like diving in a cloud of fish."</TE>
<TE>   Among the prized underwater ship sites are three U.S.-built
minesweepers sold decades ago to the Spanish navy and finally
scuttled in these waters a few years ago after their useful life
above water had ended.</TE>
<TE>   Three more American-made minesweepers are floating at a Cartagena
ship-dismantling yard, awaiting their fate. Authorities and the
owner--who bought the ships to sell parts for decorations, for use on
other ships and as metal scrap--haven't decided whether the
stripped-down vessels will be sunk.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a more romantic, beautiful idea to sink them, to make an
artificial reef," said Jose Vicente Porras Damas, whose family owns
the ship-dismantling business.</TE>
<TE>   The regional government's principal objective in building the
artificial reefs was to protect ocean-floor plants from destruction
by fishing nets, said Leandro Bermudez Rodriguez, an official in its
fishing department.</TE>
<TE>   "What we want to protect is the habitat, so fish can thrive, and
then you can fish more," Bermudez said. "Spain was a pioneer in the
Mediterranean in doing this." The practice began in the mid-1980s and
was initiated in this section of the Spanish coast around 1992, he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Pedro Garcia Moreno, director of the Cartagena-based Assn. of
Naturalists for the Southeast, said there has been a "spectacular"
recovery of fish populations near the artificial reefs.</TE>
<TE>   Regional authorities sank two kinds of roughly 5-foot-cube
concrete blocks, one with protruding iron to snag illegal nets and
another with latticework-type openings to provide homes for fish,
Bermudez said.</TE>
<TE>   Although nets can be dragged on the ocean floor in deeper waters,
it is illegal to drag them in depths of less than 165 feet, where
bottom-growing sea plants provide key fish habitat.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Fishermen Versus Divers</TE>
<TE>   How to share coastal fish resources remains a sore point. Divers
and fishermen sometimes get in each other's way, with each side
saying it faces too many restrictions and the other has too many
privileges.</TE>
<TE>   Professional fishermen complain that divers with spear guns take
fish illegally and sell them to restaurants. Recreational fishermen
say the professionals are still catching so much that their sport is
less fun than it could be if there were more fish left for the
ordinary angler.</TE>
<TE>   Pedro Fuentes Garcia, 50, a bricklayer who comes often to these
shores for sportfishing, said that he's all in favor of putting
net-ripping concrete blocks in the ocean.</TE>
<TE>   "If a fisherman is dragging a net around here and the net breaks,
I'm happy, because whatever fish escape are free again," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "The divers don't have any respect for us," added his brother Jose
Fuentes Garcia, 43, a house painter. "They take fish when they're not
supposed to. They come closer to the coast than they're allowed to.
Sometimes they even cut our lines.</TE>
<TE>   "The professional fishermen lay down nets and catch everything. If
we catch fish that are too small, we return them to the sea, but
professional fishermen don't."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Tuna Caught En Masse</TE>
<TE>   This section of coast has also become a major center for the
farming of bluefin tuna. After the fish enter the Mediterranean Sea
from the Atlantic Ocean in large schools, they are spotted from
planes or helicopters, surrounded by fishing boats with nets and
captured en masse. Then they are caged and fed less valuable fish to
fatten them for the Japanese market.</TE>
<TE>   "Japanese like the fat in the tuna because they eat it raw" and
are willing to pay many times what the fish would be worth locally,
said Garcia, the environmentalist.</TE>
<TE>   The industry has brought in substantial profits and new
employment. But it is criticized by traditional fishermen who say it
depletes the tuna population and by people such as Garcia who
complain that the farms pollute coastal waters.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   'Jobs Are ... Lost'</TE>
<TE>   "The [government] administration argues that these farms create
jobs, but jobs are also being lost because traditional fishermen
can't continue to catch tuna," Garcia said.</TE>
<TE>   "In the short term, nobody likes environmentalists," he added.
"Nobody likes to establish limits." But the association is pushing
fishermen, divers and fish farmers to think about the long term, he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Gomez, the fishing association head, said that process is working.</TE>
<TE>   He called Garcia "a wonderful person" who has definitely helped
the fishermen of the region. "There's more progress than he thinks,"
he said. "Fishermen, especially old fishermen, are usually very
conservative. They don't like change. But there's more awareness
now."</TE>

<HD>Israeli Woman Killed in West Bank</HD>
<DH>Mideast: Palestinian gunman is shot dead. Meanwhile, Tenet
meets one of Arafat's ministers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM</DL>
<LD>A Palestinian gunman killed an Israeli woman and seriously wounded
her husband in the West Bank late Saturday, while the head of the CIA
and the Palestinian interior minister met outside Washington and
discussed security reforms.</LD>
<LD>   An Israeli army spokeswoman said the woman was killed when a
gunman raided the settlement of Mehora in the Jordan Valley. Troops
then killed the gunman, she said.</LD>
<LD>   Earlier, Israeli troops killed a gunman who had tried to enter the
Jewish settlement of Niram in the Gaza Strip. Troops also shot dead a
53-year-old Palestinian municipal worker going about his duties in
the West Bank city of Nablus.</LD>
<TE>   Meanwhile, CIA Director George J. Tenet met Palestinian Interior
Minister Abdel Razak Yehiyeh for about 90 minutes at the agency's
headquarters in Langley, Va., just outside Washington.</TE>
<TE>   Although no statement was released after the morning meeting, the
discussion in part covered Yehiyeh's plan to end corruption and
mismanagement within the police and unify and retrain the Palestinian
preventive security forces, according to sources close to the
Palestinians.</TE>
<TE>   Yehiyeh told Tenet that he is revamping what remains of a
Palestinian security force that he said has been decimated by the
Israelis. He also said he is firing Palestinian officers found to be
incompetent, sources said.</TE>
<TE>   Yehiyeh is looking to Egypt and Jordan, along with the United
States, to help train the restructured Palestinian security forces,
the sources said. He also talked of using the Jordanian model of a
national police force that unites police and security forces under
one command.</TE>
<TE>   No group took responsibility for the shooting of the woman in the
West Bank on Saturday, but the Islamic militant group Hamas claimed
the man seeking to infiltrate Niram in Gaza as one of its own. Hamas
has stepped up its attacks since Israel killed its military commander
in the Gaza Strip along with more than a dozen other Palestinians in
an airstrike last month.</TE>
<TE>   As for the slaying of the worker in Nablus, Israel's army
expressed its regret. The man was driving an electrical repair van
that was marked as authorized to travel in the city despite an
Israeli curfew.</TE>
<TE>   "This just goes to show how insufferable our situation is--even
those supposedly permitted to be out and about are at risk," Nablus
Mayor Ghassan Shaka said.</TE>
<TE>   The Israeli army has reoccupied much of the West Bank, with
curfews and closures causing widespread economic problems. Israel
says the measures are needed to keep out suicide bombers.</TE>
<TE>   Elsewhere on Saturday, Dafna Spruch, 62, an Israeli employee at
Hebrew University who was wounded in a Palestinian bombing at the
school July 31, died. Her death brought the toll in the attack to
eight, five of them Americans.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, two Palestinians in Gaza, 13-year-old Ayman abu
Mughaseb and 78-year-old Khader Saedi died of wounds suffered
previously in separate Israeli military actions, hospital officials
said.</TE>
<TE>   Also Saturday, Israel blocked U.S. peace activists traveling with
American congressional staff members from entering the West Bank on a
fact-finding mission to the Palestinian territories and Israel,
according to the activists, the State Department and an Israeli
official.</TE>
<TE>   The activists were three representatives of the American Muslims
for Jerusalem organization and Jews for Peace in Palestine and Israel
organization, said Josh Ruebner, who heads the latter group. He said
they planned to meet with American and international humanitarian
organizations in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.</TE>

<HD>North Korea Devalues Its Currency</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SEOUL</DL>
<LD>North Korea slashed the official exchange rate for its currency last
week as the latest step in a new reform program aimed at reviving the
moribund economy, foreign residents said.</LD>
<LD>   The official value of the won dropped from 46.5 cents to just
two-thirds of a cent, the residents reported, speaking on condition
of anonymity. That's still overvalued compared to the black market,
where a won is worth half a cent.</LD>
<LD>   The reforms by the Communist regime, which began July 1 with pay
raises and the loosening of price controls, are viewed as significant
because they include elements of a market-based economy in one of the
world's most tightly controlled countries.</LD>
<TE>   Observers say other changes are a partial dismantling of North
Korea's rationing system, a pillar of its economic policy since the
1950s.</TE>
<TE>   After details of the initial changes leaked out, analysts had said
North Korea would have to devalue the won to reflect the realities of
its economy, which has been wrecked by years of mismanagement and
famine in the last decade that is believed to have killed hundreds of
thousands.</TE>
<TE>   The regime in Pyongyang did not make an official announcement of
the devaluation, in keeping with the secrecy surrounding its reform
campaign. Despite the market-based elements, North Korean officials
have described the reforms as a way to make central planning more
efficient, not dismantle it.</TE>
<TE>   The devaluation is unprecedented in North Korea, where the
government long argued that the state distribution system meant
residents had no need for money. But as the economy broke down, North
Koreans became desperate for hard currency.</TE>

<HD>Regulators See Germany's Recycling Program as a Green Giant</HD>
<DH>Environment: European Commission is trying to break waste
company's virtual monopoly.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CAROL J. WILLIAMS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>COLOGNE, Germany</DL>
<LD>Barely a decade old and already a world leader in recycling, this
nation's Green Dot program is presenting European neighbors with the
uncomfortable question of whether principle is more important than
performance.</LD>
<LD>   The nonprofit Duales System Deutschland exceeds every
environmental goal set under a sweeping 1991 law on packaging
disposal, but it does so because it enjoys a near monopoly in what
has grown into a $40-billion annual business in Germany.</LD>
<LD>   And that, say the competition watchdogs of the European
Commission, is an unfair advantage that must be dumped in the
interest of free markets.</LD>
<TE>   Since an EC ruling last year that Green Dot stifles competition,
the program has been under pressure from the office of European
Competition Commissioner Mario Monti to cease presenting itself to
fee-paying producers of packaging as an all-or-nothing way to get rid
of the trash they create. Green Dot may do the best job on the
Continent of turning waste into worth, but it must let others take on
some of the lucrative load, Monti's office and the European Court of
Justice decided.</TE>
<TE>   At Green Dot headquarters in this Rhine River city, director
Wolfram Brueck argues instead for a policy that boils down to the
adage: If it ain't broke, don't fix it.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, said Brueck, Green Dot's performance depends on the huge
volume of waste ensured by its control of the market.</TE>
<TE>   The program's right to process every can, bottle, bag or container
placed in its receptacles, which are located in virtually every home
in Germany, ensures that there is money for investment in research
and development of better waste disposal and recycling techniques, he
said.</TE>
<TE>   "We have done our part to build up a recycling industry that
performs better here than anywhere else in the European Union,"
Brueck said, pointing out the company's breakthrough technology that
makes glass recycling profitable and produces everything from fuel to
lawn furniture using reprocessed plastic.</TE>
<TE>   Germany recycles about 30% of its household waste, a bigger
proportion than any other developed country, according to the
Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.</TE>
<TE>   The other 70% still goes to landfills, but that share will have to
be drastically reduced within three years when a law takes effect
prohibiting disposal of unprocessed waste at such sites, said Green
Dot communications director Heike Schiffler. She and Brueck argue
that farming out part of the recycling work to for-profit competitors
will shave off earnings in Green Dot's lucrative sectors that fund
research needed to meet those impending tougher targets. Two of the
best earners--glass and aluminum--are likely to suffer anyway next
year when a new law imposing higher deposits on drink cans and
bottles will encourage consumers to return them to stores instead of
putting them in Green Dot containers.</TE>
<TE>   The restrictions on landfill dumping beginning in 2005 will mean
that more waste will have to be incinerated--a process that could
imperil air quality unless further refinement of the burning
technology can be achieved, Brueck said.</TE>
<TE>   Green Dot defenders say potential competitors want only those
aspects of the job that provide quick profits, such as aluminum and
glass recycling. Plastics are much more expensive to recycle and the
market for resale is still limited, making that sector less
attractive for businesses just getting a foothold.</TE>
<TE>   Critics, however, say opening the market would reduce costs and
make the system more efficient.</TE>
<TE>   "The way the system is designed at present makes it almost
impossible for any competitor to get involved. You are basically
required to replicate the existing network, even though it is far
from efficient," said Wolfgang Schertz, director of the Landbell
disposal firm in Mainz, which wants in on the recycling action. "If
we were allowed to create a more rational system, we could collect
and dispose of household waste for far less money."</TE>
<TE>   Green Dot charges its 19,000 producer-clients for the right to
print the Green Dot logo on their packaging and uses those licensing
fees to fund a nationwide network of collection, sorting, processing,
sales and disposal. Only products with the logo are meant to go into
the program's bins.</TE>
<TE>   Would-be competitors such as Landbell contend that the Green Dot
attempt to recycle more plastics rather than incinerate smaller items
is too expensive, accounting for the $2-billion-a-year costs that
Green Dot charges producers--which are passed on to consumers through
higher prices.</TE>
<TE>   In 2001, Green Dot managed to exceed its government-imposed
recycling quotas, returning for reuse 93% of glass, 87% of plastic
and 65% of waxed container packaging. Because it also recycles
suitable waste placed in its yellow containers even if it lacks the
logo attesting to its paid disposal, the company processed 105% of
its aluminum quota, 114% of tin and 166% of paper.</TE>
<TE>   But even some of Green Dot's contractors concede that the
statistics mask a grubbier reality.</TE>
<TE>   "About 45% of what we get in the yellow containers shouldn't be
there at all," Wolfgang Frank, sorting chief of RWE Umwelt, said of
the food waste, scrap metal, clothing and other rubbish mixed in with
the packaging marked for recycling with the licensed green dot.</TE>
<TE>   Frank's firm, one of hundreds of Green Dot contractors across the
country, takes in 1,800 tons of refuse monthly.</TE>
<TE>   The waste is run through conveyor belts onto mesh grates to sort
by size, then under electronic-eye devices that can separate metal
from plastic and wax-coated paper. What gets through the mechanized
process is sorted by hand, cleaned and bundled. The materials are
collected by other Green Dot contractors for making new products.</TE>
<TE>   Most homes have half a dozen receptacles in their kitchens for
separating waste at its source. But the system puts the legal onus on
the producers of packaging to ensure proper disposal, not the
consumers, RWE Umwelt spokesman Peter Werz noted.</TE>
<TE>   Werz conceded that competition in most markets is a good thing,
but he argued that consumer education is the more pressing necessity
for improving environmental protection.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of people are simply lazy," he said. "And when even one
person throws garbage in the packaging container or plastic in the
compost, the next person dumping his trash thinks, 'Why should I
bother?' No amount of competition is going to produce a cleaner
environment. What we need is more individual responsibility, not more
companies being paid by manufacturers to take trash off their hands."</TE>

<HD>Saudis Say Iran Expelled 16 in Al Qaeda</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Washington Post</BD>
<DL>JIDDA, Saudi Arabia</DL>
<LD>Iran has quietly detained and expelled to Saudi Arabia 16 Al Qaeda
fighters who sought refuge in the country after fleeing Afghanistan,
the Saudi foreign minister, Prince Saud al Faisal, said Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   Iranian authorities handed over the Al Qaeda fugitives, all
Saudis, knowing that whatever intelligence was obtained from them
during interrogation in Saudi Arabia would be passed on to the U.S.
for use in the war on terrorism, Saud said.</LD>
<LD>   The revelations of Iran's cooperation came in an interview with
the foreign minister at his residence in Jidda. Iran's actions are
significant because the Bush administration has listed the country as
part of an "axis of evil," along with Iraq and North Korea.</LD>
<TE>   The U.S. special envoy to Afghanistan, Zalmay Khalilzad, has
suggested that the United States has information indicating that
Iran's leadership is harboring Al Qaeda fugitives who slipped across
the border after a U.S.-led military alliance toppled Afghanistan's
Taliban government last fall.</TE>
<TE>   Saud, however, described cooperation from Iran as well as Saudi
Arabia. He said that even though Al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden and
some of his followers are Saudi, the Saudi government shares the U.S.
desire to prosecute Bin Laden and his terrorist network.</TE>
<TE>   Saud said a group of Saudi officials traveled to Tehran, the
Iranian capital, in May to question 16 Al Qaeda fighters who were
detained there, along with four women and six children, after
crossing from Afghanistan. They left Iran in June on a Saudi jet.</TE>
<TE>   The report of the expulsion contradicted long-standing Iranian
claims that there were no Al Qaeda operatives in its territory.</TE>
<TE>   Saudi officials declined to say whether the detainees turned over
by Iran remain incarcerated.</TE>
<TE>   "We asked [the Iranians] to hand them over, and they did," the
prince said. "Iran has not only cooperated with Saudi Arabia in this
conflict ... but cooperated extensively with the United States."</TE>

<HD>8th Minister Leaves Turkish Government</HD>
<DH>Politics: Kemal Dervis quits as economic chief under
pressure from the premier. His departure raises doubts about the
nation's fiscal recovery.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>AMBERIN ZAMAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>ISTANBUL, Turkey</DL>
<LD>This country's highly influential economy minister, Kemal Dervis,
resigned Saturday under pressure from beleaguered Prime Minister
Bulent Ecevit.</LD>
<LD>   The resignation prompted widespread concern among Western
diplomats here that Dervis' departure will undermine a crucial
economic recovery program supported by about $31 billion in
international loans.</LD>
<LD>   "Dervis is the program. He is the sole remaining shred of
credibility in an otherwise dead government," said one Western
diplomat, who requested anonymity.</LD>
<TE>   Dervis, 52, was brought back from a position at the World Bank in
Washington more than a year ago to oversee the recovery program
crafted by the International Monetary Fund after Turkey plunged into
its worst economic crisis since World War II.</TE>
<TE>   The economy has shrunk by 10% over the last year, leaving about
2.2 million Turks unemployed.</TE>
<TE>   Dervis, who is widely credited with averting the sort of economic
meltdown suffered by Argentina, belongs to no political party.
However, he is expected to run for parliament as the standard-bearer
for a coalition of leftist and centrist parties that he is hoping to
forge ahead of nationwide elections to be held Nov. 3.</TE>
<TE>   The Princeton-trained economist had been facing mounting criticism
for remaining in the Ecevit government while forging close links with
a rival party set up last month by a former foreign minister, Ismail
Cem. Ecevit is widely believed to have delivered his former protege
an ultimatum to either sever ties with Cem or quit.</TE>
<TE>   Cem is among seven other Cabinet ministers who have left Ecevit's
government in a protracted political crisis that has paralyzed the
nation in recent months and that prompted parliament to call for
elections about 18 months ahead of schedule.</TE>
<TE>   Ecevit chose a little-known lawmaker, Masum Turker, from his own
Party of the Democratic Left to replace Dervis. The appointment was
sent to President Ahmet Necdet Sezer for approval Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   Dervis tried to resign last month but Sezer persuaded him to stay.
Emrehan Halici, a lawmaker from Ecevit's party, stressed that
Turkey's economic recovery program will continue.</TE>
<TE>   "This program is not based on personalities. It is the program of
the government and will be maintained with the same determination,"
Halici told private NTV television.</TE>
<TE>   It remained unclear Saturday whether Dervis would join Cem, who
says his party's main goal will be to secure Turkish membership in
the European Union. This month, the national legislature approved a
raft of reforms aimed at accelerating the country's acceptance into
the European bloc. The measures, hailed by EU governments as a major
step forward, included abolishing the death penalty and lifting bans
on Kurdish-language education and broadcasts by the country's
minority Kurdish population.</TE>
<TE>   "Without Dervis, Cem has little chance of succeeding," Hasan Koni,
a professor of political science at Ankara University in the capital,
said in a telephone interview.</TE>
<TE>   For his part, Dervis said Saturday only that he would pursue
efforts to string the country's fractious left-wing and centrist
parties into an alliance capable of challenging a right-wing party
that Turkey's establishment accuses of secretly nurturing a
pro-Islamic agenda. Polls forecast that group, the Justice and
Development Party--led by Istanbul's former pro-Islamic mayor, Recep
Tayyip Erdogan--winning the upcoming elections by a broad margin.</TE>
<TE>   The prospect is deeply worrying to Turkey's powerful and strongly
secular armed forces, who fear that Erdogan would steer the nation
away from its pro-Western course. The Turkish military, which has
seized power three times in the last four decades, played a pivotal
role in unseating the republic's first Islamic-led government in
1997.</TE>
<TE>   Turkey, the sole majority-Muslim member in the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization, is counted among the United States' closest
regional allies, a role that has been enhanced by its strong ties
with Israel and more recently by its leadership of the international
peacekeeping force in Afghanistan. Turkey could be expected to play a
key role in any U.S.-led military operation to overthrow Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein. Its cooperation would probably be assured
if the staunchly pro-Western Dervis attained power.</TE>
<TE>   A darling of Istanbul's highflying industrial elite, Dervis is
also very popular among ordinary Turks because of his industriousness
and probity, rare commodities in the country's scandal-spattered
political class.</TE>
<TE>   "With Dervis, what you see is what you get," said Zeynep Gogus, a
prominent economic commentator who has interviewed Dervis several
times since his return to Turkey. "He is a through-and-through

<TE>   But some analysts questioned whether Dervis can survive in the
byzantine world of Turkish politics, not least because he has spent
most of his professional life in the United States.</TE>
<TE>   Koni, the political scientist, disagreed.</TE>
<TE>   "The Turkish people are so fed up with the current set of
politicians that they believe only someone coming from the West, from
America, can solve their problems," he said. "That man is Kemal
Dervis."</TE>

<HD>Homeless for 16 Years, Barge of Garbage Returns to Pa.</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>GREENCASTLE, Pa.</DL>
<LD>Sixteen years after its global wanderings began, a load of nearly
2,345 tons of burned garbage has returned home.</LD>
<LD>   The ash originated in Philadelphia and was part of a 15,000-ton
cargo that roamed the globe in search of a suitable final resting
site.</LD>
<LD>   On Friday, the 128th and final shipment was deposited in the
Mountain View Reclamation landfill.</LD>
<TE>   It was then promptly topped off with half a foot of dirt.</TE>
<TE>   "It was routine for us," community relations coordinator Lee
Zimmerman said.</TE>
<TE>   "We're just kind of happy it's all done."</TE>
<TE>   Most of the original cargo of ash was dumped in the Atlantic Ocean
and also in the Indian Ocean--a decision that spelled prison terms
for two executives of the shipping company.</TE>
<TE>   The rest of the rejected ash spent a dozen years on a beach in
Haiti, and the last two years it languished on a rusting barge in
Florida.</TE>
<TE>   "They should've kept it in Philadelphia," said A.J. Carbaugh, 61,
who lives a mile from the Mountain View landfill in south-central
Pennsylvania.</TE>
<TE>   The ash was orphaned in 1985 because Philadelphia's landfill had
no space left.</TE>
<TE>   The next year, a city subcontractor sent the burned garbage aboard
the Khian Sea to the Bahamas, where the government refused to allow
the ship to dock.</TE>
<TE>   For a year, the ship sailed the Caribbean but was turned away by a
series of countries--sometimes at gunpoint, according to crew
members.</TE>
<TE>   Environmental groups had warned that the ash might contain toxic
materials, though U.S. and state regulators said it had only minute
amounts of toxic metals such as lead.</TE>
<TE>   The New York City Trade Waste Commission eventually brokered a
deal to bring the ash from Haiti to Florida; the Pennsylvania
Department of Environmental Protection finally agreed to dispose of
the material.</TE>
<TE>   Traveling the last leg of its long journey by train and truck, the
first load returned to Pennsylvania on June 27.</TE>

Oregon's largest blaze in a century.</LD>
<LD>   Fire crews worked against gusty winds and steep terrain to secure
a containment line around the southeastern portion of the wildfire.
The blaze was flaring along part of the line, said Mike Ferris, a
spokesman for the U.S. Forest Service.</LD>
<LD>   A voluntary evacuation remained in effect at the southern tip of
the fire in Gasquet, Calif., home to about 800 people. The fire was

<LD>A rare flesh-eating bacteria has been blamed for the Aug. 1 death of
a fisherman, officials in Boston said.</LD>
<LD>   Al Holt, 69, died as a result of infection by Photobacterium
damsela, which lives in fish. State officials have found only 17
cases of illness caused by the bacterium in U.S. medical books.</LD>
<LD>   Authorities and family members believe Holt had a cut on his hand
that allowed the bacteria to infect him when he went fishing July 15.
The fast-moving infection destroyed tissue in Holt's left arm by the
next day, then spread to his major organs.</LD>

<HD>Democrats' Post-Sept. 11 Gloves Officially Come Off</HD>
<DH>Politics: Head of DNC condemns Bush's ethics, says he has
'squandered' country's trust. White House decries a return to
'negative attacks.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RONALD BROWNSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>In the most sweeping Democratic critique of George W. Bush since last
year's terrorist attacks, Democratic National Committee Chairman
Terry McAuliffe on Saturday condemned the president's ethics and
record, and accused him of wasting the chance for progress on key
domestic problems from the economy to health care.</LD>
<LD>   "George Bush squandered our trust, he ignored the mandate, and he
wasted the opportunity," McAuliffe insisted in a speech at a DNC
meeting in Las Vegas.</LD>
<LD>   The sharply worded address, following recent criticisms nearly as
pointed from 2000 Democratic presidential candidate Al Gore and other
party leaders, leaves no doubt that the hesitation Democrats felt
about challenging Bush after Sept. 11 is rapidly eroding.</LD>
<TE>   The White House condemned McAuliffe's speech as a return to
"negative attacks."</TE>
<TE>   "What has become clear is that the Democratic Party cannot come
together and agree on a positive agenda for the country," White House
spokesman Scott McClellan said. "It appears all they can agree to do
is to attack and tear down, and that's a really sad commentary."</TE>
<TE>   The broadside from McAuliffe--who consulted with the party's
congressional leadership and former President Clinton before
delivering the address--suggests that less than a year after the
terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon
discouraged partisan conflict, this fall's midterm elections are
likely to be as polarized and vituperative as usual.</TE>
<TE>   In particular, with voter anxiety about the stock market and the
overall economy rising, Democrats are sharpening their attacks on
Bush's economic management. "Every time this economic team opens its
mouth, markets shudder, currencies collapse, and Americans watch
their 401(k)s dwindle," McAuliffe said Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   In his weekly radio address Saturday, Bush indirectly responded to
those charges.</TE>
<TE>   Highlighting an economic summit he will convene Tuesday in Waco,
Texas, Bush argued that a "recession ... was beginning as I took
office" and the economy was further weakened by "the terrorist
attacks of Sept. 11 and the corporate scandals that have recently
come to light."</TE>
<TE>   But Bush argued that his agenda offered the best response to those
challenges. The $1.35-trillion tax cut he pushed through Congress
last year "boosted our economy at just the right time," he said.
Likewise, he argued that the expedited "fast-track" trade authority
Congress recently provided him will allow him to reach agreements
that "open foreign markets to American goods, creating high-paying
jobs at home."</TE>
<TE>   While criticizing Bush's economic record, McAuliffe, like other
Democrats, offered no alternative agenda for invigorating the economy
or the sagging stock markets. Divided over whether to seek a rollback
in Bush's tax cut, Democrats haven't presented a broad plan for
accelerating growth. Instead, they have centered their election
message on individual programs, such as providing prescription drugs
for senior citizens or opposing Bush's proposal to partially
privatize Social Security.</TE>
<TE>   McAuliffe followed that pattern, accusing Bush of breaking a
series of promises from the 2000 campaign and of failing to apply the
sense of national unity that emerged after the terrorist attacks to
domestic problems such as pension security and access to health care.</TE>
<TE>   Noting that candidate Bush promised to "change the tone" in
Washington, McAuliffe accused the president of orchestrating
Republican attacks on Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle (D-S.D.),
the target of withering ads from conservative political groups.
McAuliffe also accused Bush of violating his pledges to protect
Social Security and Medicare by "drawing down the Medicare and Social
Security trust funds to pay for his misguided tax cut."</TE>
<TE>   The White House has argued that the recession and the cost of
responding to the Sept. 11 attacks are the principal reasons
Washington has needed to divert Social Security funds to operating
the rest of government this year. The Congressional Budget Office
projected Friday that, after four years of budget surpluses, the
government this year will spend all of its general tax revenue and
all the taxes collected for Social Security, and still increase the
national debt by $157 billion.</TE>
<TE>   McAuliffe targeted Bush's ethics more directly than most other
Democrats. He charged that questions surrounding the president's sale
of stock while he served as a board member of Harken Energy Corp.
more than a decade ago--and the Securities and Exchange Commission
investigation into accounting practices at Halliburton Co. while Vice
President Dick Cheney served as its chief executive--have left the
president "unable to lead" on corporate ethics.</TE>
<TE>   But McClellan said Bush demonstrated his ability to lead on the
issue by recently signing into law the most sweeping accounting and
corporate governance reforms since the Depression-era New Deal.</TE>
<TE>   Finally, expressing publicly the private grumblings of many
Democrats, McAuliffe accused Bush of breaking his pledge to "never
exploit the national crisis that united us." He said the White House
was using the terrorist attacks to deflect criticism over the return
of the federal budget deficit and to boost Republican chances in the
midterm elections.</TE>

<HD>Controversy Over Wind Farm Roils Predictable Nantucket</HD>
<DH>Energy: Proponents say putting 170 windmills offshore will
help curb global warming. Foes represent a number of island
constituencies.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH MEHREN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NANTUCKET, Mass.</DL>
<LD>The sea surrounds this slender slip of land, and the wind blows
strong and steady. For centuries, Nantucket has derived its
livelihood from both resources, sending ships to distant ports and
drawing visitors from around the world. Now the wind and the water
off Nantucket are at the center of their own fierce storm.</LD>
<LD>   An entrepreneurial energy company, Cape Wind Associates, wants to
place 170 turbine windmills in pristine Nantucket Sound, providing a
potential peak hourly output of 420 megawatts, roughly the amount
used by all of Cape Cod, along with the islands of Nantucket and
Martha's Vineyard.</LD>
<LD>   Elsewhere in New England, 10 other wind-power projects are under
consideration, including a windmill farm on the Boston Harbor
islands, another off Long Island in New York and a competing proposal
for Nantucket Sound. But because the $700-million Cape Wind project
came first, and now is about halfway through a rigorous federal
permitting process, much of the discussion about offshore wind power
is centered here.</LD>
<TE>   "I hate to make it sound like this is going to save the world,"
said Deborah Donovan of the Union of Concerned Scientists in Boston,
"but it really does set the stage for what is going to happen
elsewhere."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Taking Sides</TE>
<TE>   The plan to build America's first offshore wind farm has pitted
environmentalists eager to reduce this country's reliance on power
generated by fossil fuels against environmentalists determined to
preserve fish, birds and an uncluttered horizon. Yachtsmen argue that
a 28-square-mile area filled with 426-foot steel towers would become
a navigational nightmare. Local air traffic controllers worry that
the windmills would threaten small aircraft. Fishermen fear for the
future of scallops, an economic staple and a local delicacy.</TE>
<TE>   The Nantucket Chamber of Commerce and several town councils on
Cape Cod oppose the project, which, if approved, could be in
operation in three years. But many scientists in the area endorse the
effort as a bold step toward curbing global warming. As regulatory
roadblocks slowly topple, community meetings ring loud with strong
opinions on both sides.</TE>
<TE>   "Partly what you are seeing is the whole not-in-my-backyard
thing," said Wade Greene, who owns guest cottages on Nantucket and
also advises philanthropists about environmental projects. "All good,
card-carrying environmentalists are for wind power. That just stands
to reason. It is so much cleaner. But when it comes down to specific
sites, the picture changes."</TE>
<TE>   Cape Wind President James Gordon dismissed the opponents as "a
minority group who have created a lot of fear mongering."</TE>
<TE>   Gordon will not discuss how large a profit he expects his project
to earn. But if defenders of the open seas are concerned about "the
marine or aquatic systems or wildlife or birds, they are going down
the wrong avenue," he said. "The greatest threat to marine ecosystems
and wildlife is climate change, and we are already seeing that now."</TE>
<TE>   The wind farm would span an area known as Horseshoe Shoals, six
miles from Cape Cod and 13 miles off Nantucket. The water depth
ranges from 2 to 20 feet, too shallow to be attractive to commercial
fishermen, Gordon said. And the shallow Nantucket Sound waters,
unlike the swiftly plummeting California sea floor, make anchoring
the wind towers relatively uncomplicated, he noted.</TE>
<TE>   Land-based windmills have become familiar sights in California and
around the globe--so much so that wind power is the fastest-growing
source of energy worldwide. The first modern offshore wind farm,
built 10 years ago off the coast of Denmark, has become a tourist
magnet, Gordon said. Eighteen offshore wind parks are under
development in Britain alone, "larger than Cape Wind and closer to
the shore," he said.</TE>
<TE>   But continental comparison shopping did not impress John Donelan,
associate director of the Alliance to Protect Nantucket Sound and a
vocal foe of the Cape Wind proposal.</TE>
<TE>   "This project is unprecedented in its size and its scope," Donelan
said. "Basically, it amounts to a land grab of a public natural
resource by private developers who are not really going to give any
benefit to the area for the privilege of taking over this unspoiled
piece of water."</TE>
<TE>   Donelan said the Nantucket proposal has national ramifications,
underscoring "a crying need for federal legislation to be put in
place for siting these projects. We also see the need for a bidding
process."</TE>
<TE>   Though some possible measures have been discussed in Congress, no
regulations that specifically govern marine wind farms exist, Donelan
said. In his group's view, the Army Corps of Engineers, which
oversees most aquatic construction projects in the United States, "is
basically rubber-stamping this project."</TE>
<TE>   Biologist George M. Woodwell, director of Woods Hole Research
Center, which studies climatic disruption, said the region has no
choice but to install the windmills.</TE>
<TE>   "I think one has to look at the issue, and the issue is how to get
rid of fossil fuels as fast as possible," he said. "We have an Earth
that is warming very rapidly."</TE>
<TE>   No one knows whether the windmills would affect fish or migratory
birds, Woodwell said, but at least one tower would be used to track
such data.</TE>
<TE>   An added impetus for exploring alternative power options is that
"New England has no indigenous energy resources except for
hydropower," said Donovan, who heads the New England Energy Policy
Project for the Union of Concerned Scientists, a coalition that
studies social problems. "Everything else that we use, we import."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Aesthetic Concerns</TE>
<TE>   But the need for energy independence "unfortunately is juxtaposed
against understandable concerns about changing the appearance of the
landscape," Donovan said. "That is what has come to the forefront as
a barrier and a source of controversy."</TE>
<TE>   Aesthetic trepidations prompted the Nantucket Chamber of Commerce,
among other local agencies, to weigh in against the Cape Wind
proposal. Property owners on both sides of Nantucket Sound have
fretted about declining real estate values if their ocean views come
to include turbines.</TE>
<TE>   But Gordon, who barnstorms county fairs to promote his project,
calls that position "incredibly selfish and absolutely wrong."</TE>
<TE>   Opponents, said Gordon, "try to give people [the idea] that, if
they were in a waterfront hotel and they opened up a window, there
would be these 426-foot towers staring at them." But Horseshoe Shoals
is so far from any land mass that, even for such tall structures,
"the visual impact would be so modest. They would look like tiny,
tiny masts on the horizon--but only on a clear day."</TE>
<TE>   Nonetheless, change often comes slowly here. As a summer
playground for the elite, Nantucket trades on an implicit guarantee
of chic predictability. Many Nantucketers welcome the wind farm as an
innovative approach to energy. Others resist it simply because it
portends change.</TE>
<TE>   "Some people are instinctively against it for that reason alone,"
said Greene, the cottage owner and environmental advisor.</TE>
<TE>   Nantucket in particular treasures its heritage, Greene said,
marketing an image that is all weathered gray shingles with shiny
white trim. A three-story building on Nantucket is a veritable
high-rise, Greene said--and yet on a hill stands one of the island's
most treasured historic landmarks: an old wooden windmill.</TE>

<HD>Data From '70s St. Louis Virus May Aid in West Nile
Outbreak</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>JACKSON, Miss.</DL>
<LD>In 1975, an outbreak of the mosquito-borne St. Louis encephalitis
spread through 29 states, killing 95 people and infecting about 3,000
others. The following year, infection rates were down, and they have
stayed down.</LD>
<LD>   Health officials expect a similar trend in the country's second
major outbreak of West Nile virus, a mosquito-borne disease that
appeared in 1999 and has killed seven people and infected more than
130 this year.</LD>
<LD>   The first notable outbreak of St. Louis encephalitis occurred in
1974. The disease is still around, but annual cases have fallen to
about 130. Last year, four people died in the Monroe, La., area from
the illness.</LD>
<TE>   In 1999, seven people died and 55 others were hospitalized in New
York with West Nile. No cases have been reported this summer.</TE>
<TE>   The successful control of the West Nile outbreak in New York and
the St. Louis outbreak in the 1970s makes it unlikely this year's
outbreak will increase exponentially, said Sally Slavinski, an
epidemiologist for the Mississippi Department of Health.</TE>
<TE>   "Next year, we probably will see some [West Nile] activity, but
hopefully not to the same degree, if we can use St. Louis as a
model," Slavinski said.</TE>
<TE>   But Bernadette Burden, a spokeswoman for the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention, said Saturday that researchers have only four
years of West Nile data compared with decades of data for St. Louis,
making it more difficult to predict the future.</TE>
<TE>   "We do believe, based on research, that it will continue its trek
west. But to say how it will impact, we honestly don't know," she
said.</TE>
<TE>   The transmission rates of St. Louis encephalitis and West Nile are
dependent on ecological and environmental factors such as rainfall
and temperature, Slavinski said.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, she said, studies have shown that humans build an
immunity to St. Louis encephalitis and West Nile virus.</TE>
<TE>   The death rate for St. Louis encephalitis ranges from 3% to 30%,
according to the CDC. West Nile's death rate nationally has been
about 10%.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to West Nile and St. Louis encephalitis, the
mosquito-borne LaCrosse-California and Eastern equine encephalitis
can also cause brain swelling. Western equine encephalitis has been
reported north and west of Texas, and in several Midwestern states.</TE>
<TE>   The seven deaths linked to West Nile this year have all been in
Louisiana, although Mississippi officials are investigating a death
they say appears to be linked to the virus.</TE>
<TE>   The governors of both states have declared states of emergency,
opening the door to federal aid for mosquito control.</TE>
<TE>   Dr. Raoul Ratard, Louisiana's epidemiologist, said the treatments
for West Nile and St. Louis are similar, and the same health
precautions should be taken, including use of mosquito repellents,
elimination of standing water, and public spraying for mosquitoes.</TE>

<HD>Lidle Has No Trouble Against Yankees, 8-0</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Cory Lidle took his turn keeping the New York Yankees off the
scoreboard.</LD>
<LD>   Lidle pitched eight impressive innings, and Miguel Tejada and Eric
Chavez homered to lead the visiting Oakland Athletics past New York,
8-0, Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   "Yeah, he gave us some problems," Yankee Manager Joe Torre said of
Lidle. "He changes speeds. He keeps the ball off the good part of the
bat. I just thought we looked a little anxious out there."</LD>
<TE>   Oakland won for the eighth time in 10 games, handing the listless
Yankees their first shutout at home since Sept. 25 of last season
against Tampa Bay.</TE>
<TE>   Lidle (5-9) lobbied to pitch the ninth after throwing 122 pitches,
but Jeff Tam came on to finish, extending New York's scoreless streak
to 17 innings.</TE>
<TE>   "We weren't patient. You have to be patient with a pitcher like
him," Torre said.</TE>
<TE>   With Friday night's 3-2 loss in 16 innings, New York has dropped
its first series since late June.</TE>
<TE>   The Yankees won eight series and split four others since losing
two of three games at Baltimore.</TE>
<TE>   The only time Lidle got in real trouble was the fifth, but he
retired Derek Jeter on a grounder with the bases loaded.</TE>
<TE>   "He had that one jam with the bases loaded, he got out of that,"
A's Manager Art Howe said. "It was their only real shot at getting
after him."</TE>
<TE>   Oakland remained tied with Boston in the wild-card race, half a
game behind the Angels.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a big series for us because we're in a pennant race," Lidle
said. "You just have to focus on Jeter there."</TE>
<TE>   Lidle gave up nine hits, struck out five and didn't walk a batter.
He hasn't given up a run in 15 innings.</TE>
<TE>   Lidle outpitched David Wells (12-6), who left after giving up
three consecutive singles to start the seventh.</TE>
<TE>   Seattle 7, Chicago 3--Bret Boone hit his 20th home run, breaking
an eighth-inning tie and sending the Mariners over the White Sox at
Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   Boone was in an 0-for-10 slump before going deep with one out
against reliever Rocky Biddle (1-3). Boone added an RBI grounder in a
three-run ninth as the Mariners maintained their 3 1/2-game lead over
the Angels in the AL West.</TE>
<TE>   Jeff Nelson (3-2) pitched 1 1/3 innings for the victory.</TE>
<TE>   Cleveland 4, Texas 3--Karim Garcia lined a game-winning single off
the left-field wall with one out in the ninth inning to lead the
Indians at Cleveland.</TE>
<TE>   Garcia preserved a tie in the top half with a fine running catch
on a two-out drive to right field by Alex Rodriguez with runners at
the corners.</TE>
<TE>   Bob Wickman (1-3) pitched the ninth for the victory. Ellis Burks
hit a three-run homer for the Indians.</TE>
<TE>   Baltimore 3, Detroit 2--Tony Batista hit a go-ahead RBI single in
the eighth inning at Detroit as the Orioles rallied from two runs
down to win.</TE>
<TE>   Chris Singleton and Gary Matthews Jr. also had run-scoring singles
in the three-run eighth as the Orioles won their eighth in 11 games.</TE>
<TE>   Rodrigo Lopez (13-4) went seven innings and gave up two runs--one
earned--and three hits for the win.</TE>
<TE>   Tampa Bay 13, Kansas City 6--Jared Sandberg hit two of the Devil
Rays' club-record six home runs in a victory at Kansas City, Mo.</TE>
<TE>   Carl Crawford and Andy Sheets each hit three-run homers, and
Aubrey Huff and Steve Cox had solo shots.</TE>
<TE>   The 13 runs were a season high for Tampa Bay. Every Devil Ray
starter except Jason Conti had a hit and scored a run. Huff matched a
career high with four hits.</TE>

<HD>For Martinez, Victory Is Piece of Work</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Red Sox pitcher extends scoreless innings streak
to 31 in Boston's 2-0 win over Minnesota.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>BOSTON</DL>
<LD>Pedro Martinez said he wasn't at his best. Try telling that to the
Minnesota Twins.</LD>
<LD>   Martinez extended his career-best scoreless streak to 31 innings,
blanking Minnesota through the eighth and pitching the Boston Red Sox
to a 2-0 victory Saturday.</LD>
<LD>   On a day when he didn't feel quite up to par, Martinez mixed his
pitches well and kept the Twins' batters off-stride.</LD>
<TE>   "When I was warming up, I noticed I wasn't as sharp and as strong
as I had been," Martinez said. "I managed to keep them off balance
and sink the ball well today to get some ground balls."</TE>
<TE>   Martinez (16-2), off to the best start of his career, gave up only
four hits in winning his ninth consecutive decision. He has the
longest shutout string in the majors since Atlanta's Greg Maddux went
39 1/3 innings in September 2000. The streak is the longest by a Red
Sox pitcher since Luis Tiant had 42 in 1972.</TE>
<TE>   "He went out there today and he knew he didn't have his best
fastball, and he probably did his best job of pitching that he has
done all year," Red Sox Manager Grady Little said.</TE>
<TE>   The three-time Cy Young Award winner didn't walk a batter and
struck out eight in lowering his earned-run average to 2.14, second
best in the majors behind teammate Derek Lowe's 2.09.</TE>
<TE>   In his last eight starts, Martinez is 7-0 with a 0.47 ERA. He
threw 77 of his 101 pitches for strikes.</TE>
<TE>   "This is one day when I had to work to earn it," said Martinez,
who was hampered last season by shoulder tendinitis. "It gives me
some satisfaction inside being able to do my job even when I wasn't
as strong as other days."</TE>
<TE>   Ugueth Urbina struck out the side in the ninth for his 27th save.</TE>
<TE>   It was only Boston's second victory in five games of a current
six-game homestand that concludes against the Twins today. Minnesota,
runaway leader in the AL Central, has lost five of its last six.</TE>
<TE>   The Twins didn't manage to get a runner past second base,
collecting a first-inning double by Cristian Guzman and three
singles.</TE>
<TE>   "The last time we saw him, he was a fastball pitcher," Minnesota
center fielder Torii Hunter said. "Today, it was finesse. He was
hitting his spots."</TE>

<HD>Players on Course to Set Strike Date</HD>

<BD>Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Baseball's labor negotiators made little headway at a rare weekend
bargaining session, leaving players on course to set a strike
deadline when their executive board meets Monday in Chicago.</LD>
<LD>   The sides met twice Saturday for a total of about 90 minutes but
spent much of the day in caucuses. They planned to meet again today,
but there didn't appear to be much likelihood they would reach an
agreement before the union meeting.</LD>
<LD>   "The setting of a strike date is an internal union matter," said
Rob Manfred, the owners' top labor lawyer.</LD>
<TE>   "They want to set a strike date, I guess they're going to set a
strike date."</TE>
<TE>   Talks have taken an increased urgency in recent weeks, with
players wanting to press for a deal without setting a deadline.</TE>
<TE>   The sides have spent much of their time on lesser issues, leaving
the key topics of revenue sharing and a luxury tax on payrolls for
later.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   John Henry Williams, the son of late Hall of Famer Ted Williams,
is giving up pursuit of his fledgling baseball career. The
33-year-old Williams, signed by the Red Sox two weeks before his
father's death, has told the Red Sox he won't return to the
organization's Gulf Coast League rookie team in Fort Myers, Fla.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Yankees pitcher Orlando Hernandez was released from the hospital,
diagnosed with a pinched nerve in his neck a day after he was forced
to leave a start against Oakland because of numbness in his left
leg.... New York Met third baseman Edgardo Alfonzo was put on the
15-day disabled list because of a strained muscle in his left side.
The move is retroactive to last Sunday.... The Cleveland Indians
activated closer Bob Wickman from the disabled list and optioned
right-hander Sean DePaula to triple-A Buffalo.</TE>

<KH>AROUND THE HORN JASON REID</KH>
<HD>Most Difficult for Bonds Will Be 661</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JASON REID</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>First the news, then the views....</LD>
<LD>   News: Barry Bonds becomes the fourth member of the 600-home run
club, joining Hank Aaron (755), Babe Ruth (714) and his godfather,
Willie Mays (660).</LD>
<LD>   Views: Bonds, the greatest player of his generation, downplayed
the pursuit of 600, saying 500 was the big hurdle. What's stunning
about Bonds' latest accomplishment is that he reached 600 the season
after hitting 500, thrilling San Francisco Giant fans and prompting
opposing managers to scrap conventional wisdom whenever he bats.</LD>
<TE>   Mays is next on Bonds' list, and there's no downplaying the
significance of that public family affair.</TE>
<TE>   "If there's a home run that will really be significant to him, and
I really believe this, [it will be] if he ever gets to the point
where he's going to hit 661," Bobby Bonds said. "Because of his
godfather; because he puts Willie on such a high plateau. That's the
ultimate. That's going to be the most difficult one for him to hit."</TE>
<TE>   News: Former Dodger Chan Ho Park is living a nightmare in the
first season of a five-year, $65-million contract with the Texas
Rangers, going 4-6 with a 7.14 earned-run average before returning to
the disabled list.</TE>
<TE>   The right-hander, who missed only one start with the Dodgers,
because of flu, was sidelined six weeks in the first half after
injuring a hamstring. Now, Park is out again, experiencing blister
problems on the middle finger of his pitching hand.</TE>
<TE>   Views: The Dodgers saw this coming, prompting General Manager Dan
Evans to let the phone ring whenever agent Scott Boras' number
appeared on his Caller ID.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers questioned Park's heart and focus throughout his
six-plus seasons at Chavez Ravine, and were eager to show him the
door after he failed to retire a batter and gave up four runs in a
bizarre relief appearance last September against the San Diego Padres
at Dodger Stadium. Manager Jim Tracy and pitching coach Jim Colborn
were disturbed by Park's comments in a meeting afterward to discuss
the meltdown, ending any realistic hope of his returning to the club.</TE>
<TE>   Scouts said Park has become too reliant on his curveball, and his
fastball, once in the 96-mph range, has consistently dropped below
90.</TE>
<TE>   "Very disappointed," Park said, "but what can you do?"</TE>
<TE>   Evans shouldn't have repeatedly said he had "strong interest" in
re-signing Park, especially considering others in the organization
conceded early in the process they didn't want him back, but he made
the right decision.</TE>
<TE>   Boras, though, has a good memory, and represents the club's young
nucleus of third baseman Adrian Beltre, starter Odalis Perez and
closer Eric Gagne. Beltre and Perez are eligible for arbitration
after the season, so Evans probably will take Boras' calls this time.</TE>
<TE>   News: Arizona Diamondback starter Randy Johnson reverts to form in
consecutive complete-game victories, giving up one run to the
Montreal Expos and tossing a two-hit shutout against the New York
Mets.</TE>
<TE>   The World Series co-MVP had 15 strikeouts in a 149-pitch effort
against Montreal. He had 11 strikeouts against the Mets at Shea
Stadium, and the Diamondbacks twice clocked his fastball at 99 mph,
and 98 seven times.</TE>
<TE>   Against the Florida Marlins on Saturday, he struck out 14 in eight
innings, passing Tom Seaver for fifth place in all-time strikeouts.
He is only 49 behind Bert Blyleven for the fourth spot.</TE>
<TE>   Views: The intimidating left-hander put himself back in contention
to win his fourth consecutive Cy Young Award, and fifth overall,
improving to 17-4 with a 2.61 ERA and 240 strikeouts. Moreover, the
buzz about Johnson being injured or tired hasn't been as loud since
his impressive performances.</TE>
<TE>   "Hopefully, that's come to an end," Johnson said of the
speculation.</TE>
<TE>   With Johnson seemingly back on track, the Dodgers and Giants face
another hurdle in trying to overtake the defending National League
West champions. Right-hander Curt Schilling, who shared the Series
MVP award with Johnson, is in top form and in good position to win
his first Cy Young.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers and Giants could soon be knocked out in the West by
the Diamondbacks' formidable righty-lefty combination, increasing the
stakes in their tight NL wild-card race.</TE>
<TE>   News: The Angels remain within striking distance of the
first-place Seattle Mariners in the American League West, and atop
the AL wild-card standings.</TE>
<TE>   Views: How about some credit for Manager Mike Scioscia?</TE>
<TE>   He stayed positive during the Angels' awful April (11-13),
maintaining a cool approach based on confidence in his veteran
players and the club's off-season moves to bolster the pitching
staff. Holding to form, the thick-skinned Scioscia answered a volley
of daily questions about why the Angels were so bad, believing the
team had too much talent to stay stuck in reverse for long.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't say enough about the job he's done this year," Oakland
Athletic General Manager Billy Beane said. "For my money, he's one of
the best managers in the game, and that's not just based on this
year.</TE>
<TE>   "There have been times they've come up here [to Oakland] when they
were out of the race, but they always played hard. When you see that,
it's always a reflection of the manager. Just a great job."</TE>
<TE>   News: Tampa Bay Devil Ray General Manager Chuck LaMar claims he
has been unfairly criticized for demanding too much in trades for
All-Star outfielder Randy Winn and closer Esteban Yan.</TE>
<TE>   "The Tampa Bay Devil Rays did everything they possibly could to
make the team better," LaMar said. "In the end, that was holding on
to the players we had.</TE>
<TE>   "The reports that we sought an exorbitant amount of players or
cash to make deals are incorrect."</TE>
<TE>   Views: Two NL general managers said LaMar did make outrageous
demands for Winn, requesting packages of major leaguers and top
prospects. LaMar has made many questionable moves in his tenure at
the Devil Rays' helm, and it's not surprising the 1998 expansion club
is a mess.</TE>

<LD>Kids these days. Can't even let their mom enjoy a few moments of
quiet solitude.</LD>
<LD>   Annett Davis and Jenny Johnson Jordan had just halted one of the
most impressive streaks in recent beach volleyball history, but
13-month-old Mya Davis, craving a little attention, started to cry as
his mother was whisked past him into the media tent Saturday at the
Michelob Light Manhattan Beach Open.</LD>
<LD>   Annett Davis stopped. She took her son in her arms. Then she
proceeded to answer reporters' questions.</LD>
<TE>   It was an apropos moment and a day to remember for Davis and
Jordan, who sat out last season in order to start families, and had
struggled to regain the form that took them to the Sydney Olympics
two years ago.</TE>
<TE>   They were able to put it all together against Holly McPeak and
Elaine Youngs, and won the women's title at Manhattan Beach, 13-21,
23-21, 15-9.</TE>
<TE>   Davis and Jordan, who will split $20,000 for the victory, had not
won a tournament since the San Diego Open on Aug. 27, 2000, on the
now-defunct Beach Volleyball America tour.</TE>
<TE>   Saturday's victory came in front of an estimated 5,500 and ended a
torrid streak by McPeak and Youngs, who had won four consecutive
Assn. Volleyball Professionals tournaments and were 25-0 in AVP
matches this season.</TE>
<TE>   Including international play, where they had won three
tournaments, McPeak and Youngs were 62-3 until the loss.</TE>
<TE>   "We weren't thinking about their streak," Davis said as she
bounced her son on her knee. "We just wanted to win."</TE>
<TE>   Davis and Jordan were listless in the first game, but they rallied
from a 12-8 deficit to win the second game.</TE>
<TE>   In the third game, Davis had two important blocks as Davis and
Jordan broke a 7-7 tie with four consecutive points.</TE>
<TE>   "It's very emotional," said Jordan, whose daughter, Jaylen, was
born in October.</TE>
<TE>   "We're both fighting back tears."</TE>
<TE>   It was the end of an impressive run for McPeak and Youngs.</TE>
<TE>   "We let up and took the pressure off the other team," McPeak said.
"We let that match get away from us."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Karch Kiraly will be 42 in November, but he keeps playing like
he's 22.</TE>
<TE>   Kiraly, beach volleyball's career leader with 143 championships,
advanced with Brent Doble to the men's semifinals by defeating Alika
Williams and Paul Baxter, 21-13, 21-16.</TE>
<TE>   Kiraly, who has won eight Manhattan Beach Open titles, looked spry
on defense while Doble looked strong at the net.</TE>
<TE>   Kiraly has earned $2,991,943 in his career and would be the first
beach player to hit the $3-million mark if he wins the title today.</TE>
<TE>   Kiraly said Saturday was unique.</TE>
<TE>   "The crowd was the best I have ever seen on a Saturday at
Manhattan Beach," he said. "They built bigger bleachers than last
year and it still wasn't enough. I've never seen such a thing."</TE>
<TE>   Eric Fonoimoana and Dax Holdren also advanced to the semifinals
with a 21-17, 19-21, 18-16 victory over Canyon Ceman and Mike
Whitmarsh in the double-elimination tournament.</TE>
<TE>   The news wasn't as good for Kevin Wong and Stein Metzger: Seeded
No. 3, they were eliminated early by No. 20 Jake Elliott and Brian
Soldano, a little-known team from Isle of Palms, S.C.</TE>
<TE>   Metzger strained his back on the second play of the match and
continued to play, but couldn't stop his team from finishing tied for
17th.</TE>
<TE>   Metzger and Wong have fared well on the international tour, with a
first and two thirds in six tournaments, but have faltered on the
AVP, with no titles in five events.</TE>
<TE>   "It's just a matter of time before we start to dominate here on
the AVP," Metzger said. "Hopefully that time is Chicago [Aug.
23-25]."</TE>

<LD>Stephen Neal, who won two NCAA titles in wrestling at Cal State
Bakersfield, has been making a name for himself with the New England
Patriots despite not playing football in college.</LD>
<LD>   Neal, who was the center of attention last year when he was
invited to the Patriots' training camp because he had the same agent
as Coach Bill Belichick, has worked his way into the lineup and
started at right guard Saturday night when the defending Super Bowl
champions played the New York Giants in an exhibition.</LD>
<LD>   "I loved football in high school, but I was about 210 pounds and
really uncoordinated," said Neal, who earned the Dan Hodge Award--the
Heisman Trophy of college wrestling--as a senior. "Through college, I
still wanted to play football and I told my wrestling coaches that I
was going to play in the NFL."</LD>
<TE>   Thanks to injuries to Joe Andruzzi and Damien Woody, the 6-foot-4,
305-pound Neal has made the most of his opportunity.</TE>
<TE>   "Steve doesn't even look like the same player this year,"
Belichick said. "It would even be a stretch to call him a player last
year. He's easily the most improved player on the team this year, and
I don't know anybody who would be even close to him."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Trivia time:  Who first ran the mile in under 3 minutes 50
seconds?</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Bike change: Michelle Dumaresq, formerly Michael before undergoing
a sex change six years ago, won a spot on the Canadian women's
downhill mountain biking team, bringing protests from some of her new
teammates, who say she should not be allowed to compete against women
at the World Mountain Biking Championships this month in Kaprun,
Austria.</TE>
<TE>   "Something there just doesn't seem right to me," Sylvie Allen, the
Canadian champion, told the National Post. Dumaresq is facing a
formal protest led by Allen and Cassandra Boon, another national team
member, who have called on the International Cycling Union to ban
Dumaresq from competition.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   No ticket, no party: Notre Dame fans who plan to tailgate before
home football games no longer will be allowed to remain in the
parking lot once the game begins. At some games in recent years,
thousands have spent the game drinking in university parking lots,
which led to several alcohol-related incidents.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Nice uniforms: Florida State got a kick from watching former
Florida Coach Steve Spurrier's first game with the Washington
Redskins, who featured new Seminole-like throwback uniforms, complete
with a spear on the side of the helmet.</TE>
<TE>   Some believed Spurrier still hadn't put aside hard feelings toward
the Seminoles.</TE>
<TE>   Said cornerback Stanford Samuels: "The uniforms are nice, but did
you notice [Spurrier] wasn't wearing the team colors?"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: New Zealand's John Walker, who ran 3:49.4 on Aug.
12, 1975, at Goteborg, Sweden.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   And finally: Detroit Red Wing center Pavel Datsyuk brought the
Stanley Cup to the Ural Mountain city of Yekaterinburg, his hometown,
as the first stop on the trophy's tour of Russia.</TE>
<TE>   "Russian hockey should be helped, and as many children as possible
should go in for sports so that they do not roam about in the
streets," Datsyuk said.</TE>
<TE>   The Cup made a symbolic visit to the Europe-Asia border, the first
time it has been displayed in Asia.</TE>

<HD>Three Is Enough for Sosa</HD>
<DH>Baseball: After trio of homers in consecutive at-bats, he
removes himself in 15-1 Cub rout of Rockies.</DH>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>DENVER</DL>
<LD>After hitting a trio of three-run homers and tying a franchise record
with nine runs batted in--all in the first five innings--Sammy Sosa
decided that was enough.</LD>
<LD>   The Colorado Rockies must have agreed.</LD>
<LD>   Sosa removed himself from the game in the sixth, and his Chicago
Cubs routed the Rockies, 15-1, Saturday night.</LD>
<TE>   "When you're up 15-1 and you have a day game the next day and you
had a game like I had, you need to know when you've had enough," Sosa
said. "I went three for four and had nine RBIs, and that was good
enough for me.</TE>
<TE>   "I have to give respect to the other team. I don't need to go out
and get more. I had a pretty good day. So I decided to shut it down."</TE>
<TE>   Sosa connected in consecutive at-bats in the third, fourth and
fifth innings at Coors Field. He took over the major league lead with
38 homers and matched Johnny Mize's record of six career three-homer
games.</TE>
<TE>   The nine RBIs were a career high for Sosa and tied the club mark
set by Heinie Zimmerman in 1911. Sosa also became the fifth player
with home runs in three consecutive innings.</TE>
<TE>   "It was one of those games where you get a couple of mistakes and
you hit them out," Sosa said.</TE>
<TE>   He exited before getting a chance to match the big league record
of four homers in a game, accomplished by Seattle's Mike Cameron and
the Dodgers' Shawn Green already this year.</TE>
<TE>   "We talked it over," Cub Manager Bruce Kimm said. "He was very
satisfied with the night. He knows we have a day game [today]. He was
thinking about the other players a little bit too. It was a good time
to get them some at-bats. It was a very unselfish move."</TE>
<TE>   The beneficiary of all that offense was rookie Mark Prior (6-3).
He went six innings, allowing five hits and one run with eight
strikeouts.</TE>
<TE>   Sosa's first two drives--off Shawn Chacon--were estimated at 490
and 468 feet.</TE>

<HD>Not Just Any Old Victory</HD>
<DH>Galaxy: Jones upstages rookie stars by scoring twice,
including goal with four minutes left that gives L.A. 2-1 win.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC STEPHENS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The night was supposed to be a showcase for two 22-year-old rookies
who have dominated Major League Soccer this season. Instead, it
belonged to one of the league's original stars who has been there
since its inception.</LD>
<LD>   Cobi Jones hadn't scored in his last 21 MLS matches, his longest
drought in seven years in the league. That changed Saturday night
when the midfielder scored both Galaxy goals, including the
game-winner with four minutes left to give Los Angeles a 2-1 victory
over the New England Revolution before 15,137 at the Rose Bowl.</LD>
<LD>   Jones broke a 1-1 tie when he sent a ball in to Carlos Ruiz, who
was in the clear inside the penalty box. Ruiz, the rookie who leads
the league with 16 goals, had a play on New England goalkeeper Adin
Brown but gave it back to a rushing Jones and the 32-year-old veteran
beat Brown with a high shot that went in off the right post.</LD>
<TE>   "It was nice to get the first goals for myself this season and put
myself on the board and give Carlos his first assist," Jones said. "I
like playing with Ruiz. He's easy to find up top and he's a hard
worker as a forward. It's a good combination."</TE>
<TE>   Jones had not found the net for the Galaxy since Aug. 18, 2001,
against Tampa Bay. But he has been a presence since his return from
the World Cup, with six assists in five matches.</TE>
<TE>   The victory lifted the Galaxy into a third-place tie with Colorado
in the Western Conference. Coincidence or not, the Galaxy (10-7-3, 33
points) is 6-1-1 including two U.S. Open Cup victories since Jones'
return. Coach Sigi Schmid said he likes how Jones and Ruiz have
worked together.</TE>
<TE>   "Those are our two money guys," Schmid said. "It's good to see
Carlos get one for Cobi instead of all of them going to Carlos. Those
two guys have to play in a way where the other team has to be worried
about them."</TE>
<TE>   The Galaxy defense put the clamps on high-scoring rookie forward
Taylor Twellman. Twellman, who is right behind Ruiz with 15 goals,
got off only one shot and didn't see the ball much as league assist
leader Steve Ralston was also shut down.</TE>
<TE>   "I thought we did a great job on Ralston," Schmid said. "Simon
Elliott's comment after the game was he was knackered, which means he
was dead tired. Danny Califf did a very good job on Twellman ... and
Tyrone [Marshall] was with [Alex] Pineda Chacon. We contained those
three guys fairly well."</TE>
<TE>   The Revolution (7-13-1) came into the match with the most porous
defense in the league. Against a unit that has allowed 44 goals, the
Galaxy figured to have a number of scoring chances, but Brown made
several big saves early on to keep L.A. off the scoreboard.</TE>
<TE>   In the 13th minute, Ruiz went in alone from the right side off a
long pass from Marshall. Brown came out to cut down the angle and
made a chest save.</TE>
<TE>   The Revolution goalie later stopped Jones with a hand save on a
header set up off a cross by Ruiz. Mauricio Cienfuegos was denied in
the 21st minute when Brown moved to his right and got a hand on the
low shot. Alejandro Moreno moved in for the rebound but Brown grabbed
the ball in time.</TE>
<TE>   Jones broke through in the 33rd minute on a play set up by
Cienfuegos and midfielder Ezra Hendrickson. Cienfuegos sent a long
pass to Hendrickson rushing down the right side. Hendrickson spotted
Jones making a run toward the left side of the net and put a perfect
pass on goal that Jones headed in.</TE>
<TE>   New England tied it in the 62nd minute when former Galaxy defender
Daniel Hernandez blasted a free kick into the left corner of the net
past a diving Kevin Hartman for his second goal of the season.</TE>

Shooting Star
Cobi Jones' two goals in the Galaxy's 2-1 victory
over New England Saturday may have been his first of
the season, but the veteran midfielder is far and
away the club's all-time leading goal scorer. The top
five:

<HD>Added Spark</HD>
<DH>Mabika's development has given L.A. another scoring option
besides Leslie</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE TERRY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Six years ago Mwadi Mabika stood among 299 other hopefuls during a
public tryout by the Sparks wondering if she could catch someone's
eye.</LD>
<LD>   Six years later, she is a WNBA star and is the defending
champions' most important player after Lisa Leslie.</LD>
<LD>   A graceful and explosive athlete, Mabika, 26, has reached a level
of performance this season equal to the potential Sparks' officials
saw in 1997.</LD>
<TE>   She leads the team in scoring at 17.2 points a game, and ranks
third overall in the WNBA. Mabika is shooting 42.8% from the field
(36.7% from three-point range) and 82.7% from the free-throw line.</TE>
<TE>   Her scoring average is almost five points higher than her previous
best (12.3 in 2000) and six points better than last year. She has
been the Sparks' top scorer in 15 of 30 games.</TE>
<TE>   As the regular season dwindles to its final games and the Sparks
battle the Houston Comets for the league's best record, Mabika has
been at her best when it counts the most. In the last 13 games, she
has averaged 20.2 points, including 32 points against Portland on
July 12.</TE>
<TE>   It makes Mabika a leading candidate for the league's most improved
player award, along with New York's Tamika Whitmore and Orlando's
Shannon Johnson.</TE>
<TE>   "She is becoming a complete player," Spark General Manager Penny
Toler said. "The last two years, she has learned the game a lot more.
She's learned she has take-over-the-game capabilities. She's taking
good shots and taking the tough shots [with the game on the line].</TE>
<TE>   "She's realized there are not too many players who can go up with
her."</TE>
<TE>   A 5-foot-11, 165-pound guard, Mabika regularly confounds defenders
with the speed to drive past them to the basket, or leap above them
for jump shots. Defensively, her quick hands and feet have accounted
for 37 steals and nine blocks.</TE>
<TE>   More importantly, after spending the summer working with Coach
Michael Cooper and playing pickup games with Magic Johnson's
traveling team, Mabika has the confidence that she is an elite
player.</TE>
<TE>   "Coop has been telling me to take big shots this year, telling me
to be a leader on this team," Mabika said. "And he worked with me and
prepared me to be a leader on this team during the off-season."</TE>
<TE>   She had been a top player in Europe, but the Sparks are Leslie's
team. There are also such strong personalities as Latasha Byears,
DeLisha Milton and Tamecka Dixon, who don't require any rah-rah types
to get them motivated.</TE>
<TE>   Which makes the quiet Mabika, who made her second All-Star team
this season, a perfect leader by example. She will speak when she has
something to say but prefers to let her game do the talking. This
season it speaks loudly.</TE>
<TE>   "I know how to do that, to take a big shot," Mabika said. "I took
that attitude from over there [in Europe], and brought it over here."</TE>
<TE>   Her teammates are quite happy for Mabika's breakout year.</TE>
<TE>   "I think she's always been a go-to player. But she had to get
comfortable with it [pressure]," Dixon said. "She's taken big shots
as long as I can remember, even when she wasn't scoring as many
points. But [last winter] she worked on her moves with Cooper and
Lisa. That added more confidence. That's why things have come
together."</TE>
<TE>   Still, it might have been hard for Mabika to envision this level
of success as a child.</TE>
<TE>   Born in Kinshasa, Zaire (now the Congo), in central Africa, the
daughter of a physician, Mabika started playing basketball with her
brothers on a neighborhood outdoor court. She said she would watch
tapes of NBA games broadcast on local television and would try to
imitate the moves of players like Johnson, Michael Jordan and Clyde
Drexler.</TE>
<TE>   By 12, Mabika had learned enough to join a Zairian Division III
team. In 1996 Mabika, then 19, scored 20 points against the U.S.
while playing for Africa in the Atlanta Olympics. She was encouraged
to come back and try out for the WNBA, which would be starting the
next year.</TE>
<TE>   Mabika had to return to Zaire, however, and didn't know if she
would be allowed to go back to the U.S. NBA star Dikembe Mutombo, a
native of Kinshasa, heard about her situation and personally appealed
to government officials, deeply involved in a civil war, to let
Mabika leave the country.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the death of her father (due to complications of diabetes)
and speaking no English, Mabika came to Los Angeles in 1997 for the
Spark tryout.</TE>
<TE>   Toler, a Spark player in 1997, was at the tryout. She said Mabika
easily stood out.</TE>
<TE>   "There were 300 players there and about 250 were garbage. That's
one reason why Mike and I hold invitation-only tryouts now," Toler
said. "Mwadi wasn't polished, but you saw a real athlete--somebody
who ran the floor real well, could jump out of the gym, and there's
no difference in her jump shot now than six years ago. She always had
the prettiest jump shot in the game."</TE>
<TE>   Now she is a driving force in L.A.'s effort to repeat as WNBA
champion. If the Sparks can win the title again, Mabika said it would
mean more to her than last year's championship.</TE>
<TE>   "The second one would be the best because it is tough to win
back-to-back," Mabika said.</TE>
<TE>   "That's why we have to stay focused and keep believing we can do
it."</TE>

<LD>Top-ranked Lleyton Hewitt beat unseeded Fernando Gonzalez, 6-7 (3),
7-5, 6-2, Saturday night to advance to the final of the Cincinnati
Masters Series at Mason, Ohio.</LD>
<LD>   The Australian star will face Carlos Moya today in the
championship match. The 16th-seeded Moya beat Spanish countryman Juan
Carlos Ferrero, 6-3, 6-4.</LD>
<LD>   Hewitt, preparing for his U.S. Open title defense, has won four
titles this year, including Wimbledon and the Masters Series event at
Indian Wells.</LD>
<TE>   Gonzalez has won a tournament in his native Chile but has not
progressed beyond the round of 16 in any of the major tournaments
before this event, when he beat fourth-seeded Tim Henman and
12th-seeded Andy Roddick.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a tough guy to play. He gives you absolutely no rhythm,"
said Hewitt, who had never played Gonzalez and struggled in the first
set. "He just hits the ball as hard as he can every time."</TE>
<TE>   Moya used precise shotmaking to defeat the eighth-seeded Ferrero.</TE>
<TE>   "I had a special feeling that today was going to be my day," Moya
said. "I just had the feeling that something was going to happen. I
don't know why."</TE>
<TE>   Moya broke Ferrero's serve only twice--once in each set--but that
was enough.</TE>

<TE>   Teenage qualifier Svetlana Kuznetsova defeated fifth-seeded
Martina Sucha of Slovakia, 6-2, 3-6, 7-5, to reach the championship
of the Nordic Light Open at Espoo, Finland.</TE>
<TE>   Denisa Chladkova of the Czech Republic won the other semifinal,
beating Patricia Wartusch of Austria, 7-5, 7-6 (4).</TE>
<TE>   Kuznetsova, a Russian who turned 17 in June, will play in her
first WTA final. She is ranked 123rd in the world.</TE>

<TE>   Dallas Maverick owner Mark Cuban won't let his players compete in
the World Championships unless a dispute with the NBA over insurance
coverage is solved.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not willing to accept a risk of millions and millions of
dollars just so our guys can play in this tournament," Cuban said.</TE>
<TE>   NBA deputy commissioner Russ Granik told the Dallas Morning News
in Saturday's editions that he expects the Mavericks to be
represented in the championships.</TE>
<TE>   "Our view is that the Mavericks don't have the right to withhold
consent," Granik said.</TE>
<TE>   Cuban said the NBA's interpretation of "adequate" does not cover
total contract value, leaving team owners at high financial risk of
long-term injuries during the Aug. 29-Sept. 8 World Championships in
Indianapolis.</TE>
<TE>   The newspaper reported that it appears Cuban could only officially
deny permission to would-be German teammates Dirk Nowitzki and Shawn
Bradley, because the German Basketball Federation has struggled to
secure what the NBA deems as "adequate" coverage.</TE>
<TE>   Cuban, however, included Canada's Steve Nash and Team USA's
Michael Finley and Raef LaFrentz in his pronouncement.</TE>
<TE>   Granik told the newspaper that the final say for Nash, Finley and
LaFrentz belongs to the players. He expects all three to play.</TE>

<TE>   Tasha Schwikert had little trouble winning her second consecutive
title in the U.S. Gymnastics Championships at Cleveland, finishing
with 75.550 points, well ahead of Tabitha Yim (74.625).</TE>
<TE>   Ashley Postell was third at 73.425. Cuban-born Annia Hatch,
competing in her first U.S. championships, was fourth with 72.650.</TE>
<TE>   Three-time junior champ Kristal Uzelac, competing despite a broken
little toe on her right foot, only did the uneven bars Saturday
night. She scored a 9.525.</TE>
<TE>   Schwikert's sister, Jordan, withdrew after her first event. She
was competing with three stress fractures in her back.</TE>
<TE>   Tasha Schwikert's multiple titles put the 17-year-old in some
illustrious company. Kim Zmeskal, the first American woman to win the
world all-around title, was a three-time U.S. champion. Olympic gold
medalist Shannon Miller won two crowns, as did Cathy Rigby.</TE>

<HD>Johnson Turns Up Heat on Marlins</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Almost every outing, Randy Johnson finds himself mentioned in the
same sentence as pitchers enshrined in the Hall of Fame.</LD>
<LD>   Johnson fanned 14, passing Tom Seaver for fifth place on the
career strikeout list, as the Arizona Diamondbacks beat the Florida
Marlins, 9-2, Saturday at Phoenix.</LD>
<LD>   "He's up there with the best strikeout pitchers in the history of
the game," said Marlin Manager Jeff Torborg, who caught three
no-hitters as a player. "He doesn't compare with the guys that I
caught relative to where he throws from. Sandy [Koufax] was over the
top. Don Drysdale was from the side, but he was right-handed.</LD>
<TE>   "This guy is kind of unique."</TE>
<TE>   Johnson (17-4), who pitched complete games in his last two starts,
went eight innings this time. He gave up two runs, five hits and two
walks in his fourth consecutive victory--a stretch in which he has an
0.82 earned-run average in 33 innings.</TE>
<TE>   "He hit 100 [mph] once on our gun today, and 99 six or seven
times," Manager Bob Brenly said. "When he's got that slider working
and that kind of fastball, it's going to be a tough day for whoever."</TE>
<TE>   Johnson finished the afternoon with a major-league leading 240
strikeouts this season--10 more than teammate Curt Schilling, who
pitches today.</TE>
<TE>   The Big Unit moved past Schilling by striking out five in the
first two innings. His third of the game--against Preston Wilson for
the first out of the second--was No. 3,641 and sent him ahead of
Seaver. Johnson ended the day with 3,652 career strikeouts.</TE>
<TE>   "The end of last year, the company that I was in was pretty
incredible," Johnson said. "I was kind of in awe of the whole
situation. But to be in the company that I'm in now--to have seen
these other pitchers play, to have met these other pitchers like Don
Sutton, Tom Seaver--means a lot."</TE>
<TE>   Houston 8, Atlanta 5--Rookie Kirk Saarloos won his fifth
consecutive start and slumping Lance Berkman returned to the lineup
and drove in two runs as the Astros won at Houston.</TE>
<TE>   The largest crowd of the season in Houston--43,332--saw the Astros
send the NL East leaders to only their third loss in 12 games.</TE>
<TE>   Saarloos (5-2) went 5 2/3 innings and gave up five runs and seven
hits. He is now 5-0 with an ERA of 2.90 in five starts since being
recalled from triple A on July 20.</TE>
<TE>   St. Louis 5, New York 4--Albert Pujols hit a grand slam and the
Cardinals won at St. Louis for only their second victory in 10 games.</TE>
<TE>   Pujols connected in the first inning for his second slam of the
season.</TE>
<TE>   After the Mets came back to tie the score, the NL Central leaders
scored the go-ahead run in the sixth on a sacrifice fly by Jim
Edmonds.</TE>
<TE>   Cincinnati 9, San Diego 0--Ryan Dempster escaped two bases-loaded
threats during a make-or-break start at Cincinnati, and Jason LaRue
homered and drove in three runs to lead the Reds.</TE>
<TE>   Cincinnati got Dempster (7-11) from Florida on July 11, but he
pitched so poorly in his first five starts--1-3 with an ERA of
11.74--that he was in danger of losing his spot in the rotation with
one more bad showing.</TE>
<TE>   He saved himself by giving up only four hits and four walks in six
innings.</TE>
<TE>   Milwaukee 5, Montreal 2--Jose Cabrera pitched six solid innings,
and Eric Young had four hits at Milwaukee as the Brewers ended a
five-game losing streak against the Expos.</TE>

<KH>SOCCER GRAHAME L. JONES</KH>
<HD>This Isn't Just What the Doctor Ordered</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>GRAHAME L. JONES</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's time to tell some unpleasant truths, never mind the bruised
egos, the rocked boats or the burned bridges. The plain fact is,
soccer in the United States is awash in myths.</LD>
<LD>   One of those myths is that U.S. Soccer controls the sport in this
country.</LD>
<LD>   On Friday morning, at a fancy hotel in San Francisco, S. Robert
Contiguglia was elected to a second four-year term as president of
U.S. Soccer. Now it is very likely that not one reader in 10,000 has
the slightest idea who S. Robert Contiguglia is, and what is more,
they don't care to know.</LD>
<TE>   Within the soccer community, however, "Dr. Bob" is recognized as a
decent, caring, 60-year-old man who probably is far better suited to
being the Denver kidney specialist that he is than being leader of
the largest and potentially most powerful soccer federation in this
hemisphere.</TE>
<TE>   Because, make no mistake, U.S. Soccer has that potential.</TE>
<TE>   If it didn't, the big-money boys would not be worming their way
deeper and deeper into its woodwork.</TE>
<TE>   The federation will tell you that Contiguglia was reelected
unopposed and by unanimous consent, all of which is correct. But it
wasn't because "Dr. Bob," bless his heart, was so beloved that people
clamored for his return.</TE>
<TE>   There were those who wanted to run against him. At least one of
them was shot down by the Anschutz Entertainment Group, which--right
or wrong--carries far more clout these days than U.S. Soccer and
Major League Soccer combined.</TE>
<TE>   Another was Alan Rothenberg, Contiguglia's predecessor and the man
who turned U.S. Soccer from an amateur operation into a halfway
organized federation, as well as founding MLS. The fact that
Rothenberg grew rich in the process is neither here nor there.</TE>
<TE>   In the end, though, he thought better of it and kept his hat out
of the ring. What role, if any, AEG played in that decision is
unknown.</TE>
<TE>   So it's "Dr. Bob" for another four years.</TE>
<TE>   That will be welcome news in many quarters, because Contiguglia,
honest to a fault, is not going to make any waves. Those rose-colored
glasses were made specifically for him. He sees the best in everyone,
no matter how odious some might be.</TE>
<TE>   The most odious are right on his doorstep, but Contiguglia said
Friday that he and U.S. Soccer will continue to support the
leadership of CONCACAF, the 38-member confederation of North and
Central American and Caribbean nations that operates--at considerable
and unnecessary expense--out of Trump Tower in New York.</TE>
<TE>   CONCACAF, not to mention some of its marketing partners, is viewed
by many in the media on both sides of the Atlantic as a corrupt and
morally bankrupt organization, one that is sorely in need of
fumigation.</TE>
<TE>   But don't look for U.S. Soccer to play a leading role in cleaning
up the confederation. It's not going to happen.</TE>
<TE>   "I think we lead by example in U.S. Soccer," Contiguglia said
Friday.</TE>
<TE>   "I think most people would say that we are a very moral and
ethical organization."</TE>
<TE>   Contiguglia pointed out that U.S. Soccer supported Jack Warner, a
Trinidadian, in Warner's election as CONCACAF's president, and Chuck
Blazer, CONCACAF's general secretary, as well as backing Joseph
"Sepp" Blatter in his successful reelection bid as FIFA president
"for the contributions he has made to the game."</TE>
<TE>   "And we have a very good working relationship with them,"
Contiguglia sad.</TE>
<TE>   "Chuck was here [in San Francisco Friday], as a matter of fact, at
our convention and ran the election.</TE>
<TE>   "We have a strong relationship with CONCACAF, and it's always been
very above board and very professional."</TE>
<TE>   Be that as it may, there is an almost obscene amount of money to
be made in soccer these days by those who control such events as the
World Cup, and when those in charge use that money to perpetuate
their time in power--as Blatter is alleged to have done with the
support of Warner, Blazer and others--surely it is time to distance
the U.S. from the unseemly mess.</TE>
<TE>   Blatter's reelection in late May was never seriously in doubt, not
with the feeble candidate--Issa Hayatou of Cameroon--that was pitted
against him, but that did not stop England's Football Assn. from
taking the moral high ground and opposing Blatter's reelection.</TE>
<TE>   Unfortunately, U.S. Soccer took the opposite tack--the moral low
ground.</TE>
<TE>   Contiguglia went so far as to endorse Blatter in an open letter
released in New York one week before the election at a time when
daily revelations were being made about unscrupulous and possibly
illegal behavior within FIFA.</TE>
<TE>   "When we put aside all the negative rhetoric, histrionics and
embarrassing behavior, we can come to only one conclusion--President
Blatter should continue as FIFA president," Contiguglia's letter
stated, going on to praise the insufferable Blatter as "an icon of
humanitarianism."</TE>
<TE>   This is the same Blatter who since his reelection has
systematically set about purging FIFA of anyone who dares to
contradict him; the same</TE>
<TE>   Blatter who has yet to explain how one of his most ardent
supporters, Asian Football Confederation president and FIFA vice
president Mohamed bin Hammam of Qatar, was embroiled in a
black-market ticket scandal during the 2002 World Cup; the same
Blatter who is getting wealthier by the day while spouting nonsense
about how his "Goal Program" is helping the underprivileged soccer
nations of the world.</TE>
<TE>   What the "Goal Program" is doing is enriching Blatter's supporters
in Third World countries who are only too happy to accept free money
from FIFA in exchange for a vote or two every four years.</TE>
<TE>   If Contiguglia doubts that, he can check with certain African
soccer federations where the grants from FIFA have disappeared down a
sinkhole without the countries' players, coaches or referees getting
so much as a look at it.</TE>
<TE>   So much for the "icon of humanitarianism."</TE>
<TE>   No, the sad fact of the matter is that U.S. Soccer is in the
Blatter bag.</TE>
<TE>   Perhaps it would not have made any difference who was elected
president of U.S. Soccer on Friday, but there are many American fans
who yearn for the day when their own federation and confederation
show some real leadership and, more to the point, moral fiber.</TE>

<TE>   Update--The Sparks caught a break Saturday when Houston lost to
Sacramento, moving Los Angeles into first place by a half-game in the
Western Conference. The Sparks can clinch the conference title by
winning their final two games. The Lynx, tied with Phoenix for last
place in the West, have had a season to forget. Former coach Brian
Agler was kicked upstairs to the general manager's post on July 16
and replaced on the bench by Heidi VanDerveer (whose sister, Tara,
coaches at Stanford). Minnesota, 6-13 at the time of the change, has
gone 4-7 under VanDerveer. The Lynx's three-game winning streak was
ended Friday by Charlotte, which clinched an Eastern Conference
playoff spot with the victory.</TE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>VILLA TUNARI, Bolivia</DL>
<LD>Before he almost won Bolivia's presidential election, Evo Morales
came to town to throw rocks at the police.</LD>
<LD>   Fearlessness has won him the support of this country's poorest
peasants, who love him because he dodges army bullets and dances
through clouds of tear gas. But legions of city dwellers have come to
admire the stone-throwing congressman too.</LD>
<LD>   Urban Bolivians voted for Morales in surprising numbers in June
elections here, in perhaps the most striking example of the
increasing anger many South Americans feel toward the forces that he
skewers in his speeches: the United States and free-market economics.</LD>
<TE>   Morales, an Aymara Indian elected to Congress in a district of
mostly Quechua Indians, sees his rise from coca farmer to national
political figure as part of a messianic struggle against evil.</TE>
<TE>   "On one side there is Evo Morales, who represents the poor, the
victims of neoliberalism and the Quechua and Aymara, the true owners
of this noble land," he said in an interview. "And then there is the
other side--American imperialism, the transnational corporations, the
oligarchy and corruption."</TE>
<TE>   The same enemies on Morales' list appear in speeches by
politicians as diverse as the gadfly congresswoman Elisa Carrio in
Argentina, nationalist President Hugo Chavez in Venezuela and, in a
significantly more moderate tone, presidential candidate Luiz Inacio
Lula da Silva in Brazil.</TE>
<TE>   After a decade in which governments across the region embraced
open markets, privatization and other reforms prescribed by
conservative gurus, there is a growing sense that South America has
lost its way. Most of the region's countries are adrift in a sea of
recession, unemployment and foreign debt.</TE>
<TE>   Official unemployment has reached 22% in Argentina and 15% in
Venezuela. With Brazil slipping deeper into a fiscal crisis, its
currency, the real, lost 20% of its value in two months before the
International Monetary Fund stepped in Wednesday with its largest
bailout, a $30-billion loan.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Looking for Leaders</TE>
<TE>   The search for saviors in this battle between the global economy
and its malcontents has boosted the fortunes of many politicians who
were considered, until recently, unreformed leftists or political
mavericks with little hope of ever winning power.</TE>
<TE>   Here in Bolivia, Morales won 21% of the vote in an 11-candidate
field and finished just 42,000 votes behind the winner, Gonzalo
Sanchez de Lozada, who took 22%.</TE>
<TE>   "This was the first time in my life I've ever voted for an
Indian," said Jorge Barcena, a 50-year-old teacher in La Paz,
Bolivia's capital, explaining his vote for Morales.</TE>
<TE>   Some of Barcena's relatives, all middle-class La Paz residents
like him, thought that he was crazy to vote for Morales. Racial
stereotypes remain an ugly fact of everyday life in Bolivia, where
the large indigenous majority remains impoverished and marginalized.</TE>
<TE>   "How could you vote for that Indian?" his relatives told him in
disparaging tones.</TE>
<TE>   But for Barcena, voting for a rank outsider like Morales was the
only way to send a message to the political elite.</TE>
<TE>   "I am so angry, so completely upset," he said. "All these parties
make arrangements with each other to loot the country. They support
this neoliberal system that only makes them rich and leaves everyone
else poor."</TE>
<TE>   Stories of cronyism and corruption abound here, as elsewhere
across South America. Once, politicians who enriched themselves were
tolerated because they controlled bureaucracies that could dispense
vast networks of patronage--everything from lucrative business
contracts to jobs as trash collectors.</TE>
<TE>   Now, hard times mean that the caudillos, or benevolent strongmen,
have fewer gifts to dispense. Traditionally dominant parties such as
the Peronists in Argentina and the Nationalist Revolutionary Movement
in Bolivia are losing influence.</TE>
<TE>   Violent protest has become widespread, with Peru and Paraguay both
declaring a state of emergency in recent weeks in response to unrest.</TE>
<TE>   Of the nine countries in Spanish-speaking South America, only one
is free of political and economic instability--Chile.</TE>
<TE>   Assistant Secretary of State Otto J. Reich has acknowledged the
growth of the dissident voices in Latin America and has expressed
special concern about the situation in Argentina.</TE>
<TE>   "The social upheaval is painful and difficult, and the risk of
political and economic contagion, while diminished in recent months,
is not fully under control," Reich said recently.</TE>
<TE>   Already, in Brazil, the two left-leaning front runners in the
presidential election have said they would put off negotiations on a
treaty to create a "Free Trade Area of the Americas" because they see
it as a U.S. attempt to impose unfair trade practices.</TE>
<TE>   And in Bolivia, Peru and elsewhere, demonstrations against
government plans to privatize utilities and other services have hit
hard at investments by European and American firms.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, a growing number of South Americans see their governments
as servile before "Yankee" domination and the demands of the IMF,
which requires free-market reforms as a condition of economic
assistance.</TE>
<TE>   In Buenos Aires, IMF officials visiting Argentina last month were
greeted by protesters burning American flags. The sense that
Argentina's sovereignty is under threat has boosted Carrio's
profile--she rails against the IMF and revels in her image as a
self-described "fat woman" outside the male-dominated establishment.</TE>
<TE>   "The representative of the fund thinks he's our economy minister
and that he can tell Argentines how they should act," Carrio said in
a recent interview. Among other things, the IMF demanded that the
Argentine Congress repeal a law used to prosecute bankers who
spirited money out of the country, arguing that the law chilled the
investment climate there.</TE>
<TE>   "We've gotten used to being treated without dignity and mutual
respect," said Carrio, a lawmaker from the impoverished north.
"Instead, Argentina allows itself to be persistently abused and
violated. This isn't good for either Argentina or the United States."</TE>
<TE>   Admirers and detractors alike say she "has ovaries"--a phrase used
to describe strong women in Argentina. Carrio leads in polls ahead of
a presidential election scheduled for March.</TE>
<TE>   Like Carrio and Morales, Venezuela's Chavez can claim outsider
status: He is a bachaco--a man of mixed race--and a military officer
who never held office until he was elected president in 1998. His
support among the poor appears to have grown even stronger in the
wake of an April attempt to oust Chavez led by dissident generals and
business leaders.</TE>
<TE>   In Brazil, most people know the most important details in the life
story of the man they affectionately call Lula, the Workers' Party
candidate who has a lead in all polls and may finally be elected
president of Brazil this fall on his fourth try.</TE>
<TE>   While trying to position himself in this campaign as a leader who
has grown more moderate with age, Lula has remained true to the
central idea of his long career in politics: that free-market
policies hurt most Brazilians, especially the poor.</TE>
<TE>   "I am against the free trade treaty with the U.S., because it's a
proposal that would mean the annexation of South America's economy to
the United States," Lula said recently.</TE>
<TE>   But nowhere has the leap from renegade to power broker been as
stunning as in Bolivia. Morales, dismissed as a fringe player on the
Bolivian political scene just a year ago, leads the largest
opposition party in both houses of Congress after a new legislature
was sworn in last week. Morales' ascendance is in many ways an
emblematic tale of the global economy. The path that would lead him
to become this country's best-known rabble-rouser begins in a corner
of Bolivia that traditionally has had the strongest link to the world
marketplace: the mining regions around Oruro and Potosi in the
southwest.</TE>
<TE>   For centuries, Bolivia's tin mines had provided a steady trickle
of income for the area's mostly Aymara Indian families. But by the
late 1970s, with tin prices down and the government preparing to lay
off thousands as part of a restructuring program, many families were
forced to migrate.</TE>
<TE>   Morales was an adolescent when his family joined the exodus to the
tropical Chapare region in central Bolivia where even the poorest
farmer could make money planting a booming export crop--the coca
leaf, used to make cocaine.</TE>
<TE>   "Evo Morales, the leader, was created by coca and he has won
political power thanks to the coca," said Alcides Flores, an editor
at the Cochabamba newspaper Los Tiempos.</TE>
<TE>   Like many observers in Bolivia, Flores doesn't believe that
Morales has the link to the drug trade some have alleged but says his
assertions that coca is produced only for traditional, medicinal
purposes are disingenuous.</TE>
<TE>   Coca farming remains legal in Bolivia, where farmers have
cultivated the crop for thousands of years: Before cocaine existed,
it was used for brewing tea and other benign uses.</TE>
<TE>   But the last half a decade has seen a U.S.-backed effort to limit
coca farming as part of a global assault on the drug trade. In
Chapare, that campaign has included sweeps by army soldiers who burn
crops and rough up farmers.</TE>
<TE>   As an activist with Bolivia's peasant union, Morales organized
"committees for peasant self-defense" that often fought pitched
battles with soldiers and police. He rose quickly through the ranks.</TE>
<TE>   The demands of the coca growers have become part of a complex
quilt of grievances that have spread to nearly every corner of
Bolivian society. Morales has linked himself to many of these
struggles simply by showing up at demonstrations when the rocks start
flying.</TE>
<TE>   In the central town of Sacaba, about two hours' drive from Villa
Tunari, people remember Morales from two years ago, when he brought
thousands of cocaleros to join in a protest against government plans
to sell the local water company to the San Francisco-based Bechtel
Corp.</TE>
<TE>   What came to be known as "the Water War" only added to Morales'
status as a folk hero. Eventually, the government canceled the sale,
a major setback to its privatization efforts.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A Corner of Conflict</TE>
<TE>   Like many other corners of South America, Sacaba seems to be in a
perpetual state of conflict. One recent Tuesday found the town square
blocked off by barricades of upturned cobblestones, the doors to the
municipal government building blocked off with sandbags as part of a
protest against local government corruption.</TE>
<TE>   "We're veterans of the water war, the coca war and now the war
against these corrupt politicians," said Ramiro Villalobos, a
22-year-old law student who, like most of the protesters, proclaimed
himself a Morales supporter.</TE>
<TE>   Sacaba voted overwhelmingly for Morales in June. In the
surrounding province of Cochabamba, Morales and his Movement Toward
Socialism won 38% of the vote--finishing first--and took the largest
number of seats allocated to the province in the national Senate and
Chamber of Deputies.</TE>
<TE>   For all his fame, as late as March, support for Morales in
nationwide polls was still in the single digits.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Ouster Aids Campaign</TE>
<TE>   According to Bolivian analysts, Morales' campaign gathered
momentum after he was kicked out of Congress in January, charged with
fomenting violent unrest against the government. (Morales won back
the same seat in the June election.) The expulsion was widely seen
here as being masterminded by U.S. Ambassador Manuel Rocha.</TE>
<TE>   "When Evo was kicked out of Congress, he became a victim," said
Sacha Llorentti of the Permanent Assembly of Human Rights in Bolivia,
a nongovernmental organization. "And in this country, victims are
held in high regard. They prosper."</TE>
<TE>   Just a week before the election, Rocha once again attacked
Morales, suggesting that if the cocalero were elected president, it
could mean the end of U.S. aid to Bolivia.</TE>
<TE>   The statement was seen by Bolivians of all political stripes as an
unwelcome intervention in the electoral process. From the highest to
the poorest levels of society, people are more likely than ever to
blame American politicians and diplomats for what ails Bolivia.</TE>
<TE>   In Villa Tunari and neighboring towns such as Shinahota, the
cowboy-and-Indian-style games of young children are punctuated with
cries of "Death to the United States!" and "Evo, presidente!"</TE>
<TE>   The children mimic what they hear and see in the street battles
between residents and army troops sent to rein in the coca trade,
said Placida Barrientos, a woman selling bags of coca leaves in the
Shinahota market. "The soldiers tell us, 'We don't want to be here,
but [the Americans] sent us and we have to obey.' "</TE>
<TE>   Like other women at the market, Barrientos believes that one man
can help save the place where they sell 45-pound bags of raw coca
leaves for $35. (Those same leaves can be used to make cocaine worth
about $4,000 on U.S. streets.)</TE>
<TE>   "Evo is the one we voted for," she said. "He knows how we suffer."</TE>

<HD>Archdiocese Cuts Budget Amid Woes</HD>
<DH>Finance: Falling stock market, sex abuse cases, cathedral
subsidies pose burden for L.A. church.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LARRY B. STAMMER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Responding to stock market losses and the prospect of costly future
sexual abuse settlements, the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Los
Angeles is cutting budgets for ministry and education programs--some
by as much as 30%--and leaving jobs unfilled.</LD>
<LD>   Six weeks into its 2003 fiscal year, which began July 1, the
archdiocese still does not have a budget. Moreover, it has yet to
issue its annual financial statement summarizing its 2002 budget
year--a document that was supposed to be published in December.</LD>
<LD>   Meanwhile, the archdiocese said its new $200-million Cathedral of
Our Lady of the Angels and conference center, which will be dedicated
Sept. 2, will require an unspecified subsidy from the archdiocese for
several years to meet operational costs until it becomes
self-supporting.</LD>
<TE>   The subsidy is similar to archdiocesan financial aid given to new
parish churches until they get on their feet.</TE>
<TE>   But the amount is expected to be much greater, and it comes at a
time when the archdiocese is retrenching elsewhere.</TE>
<TE>   Despite repeated requests from The Times, archdiocesan spokesman
Tod Tamberg said he could offer no specifics on how many jobs have
gone unfilled, the size of the archdiocese's budget or the total
number of archdiocesan employees.</TE>
<TE>   According to past statements by church officials, the annual
operating budget is about $500 million. A Dun and Bradstreet report
dated March 7 said there are 300 employees at the archdiocesan
headquarters.</TE>
<TE>   The archdiocese, the nation's largest, has 287 parishes that serve
about 5 million Catholics in Los Angeles, Ventura and Santa Barbara
counties.</TE>
<TE>   Cardinal Roger M. Mahony has expressed concern about losses in the
archdiocesan investment portfolios.</TE>
<TE>   "We're in 2 1/2 years of not just zero return but minus return,"
Mahony told a group of Times reporters and editors last month. "We
not only didn't get a dollar, we lost huge amounts of money. So while
we did have a reserve fund to get through one or two rainy years, I'm
very alarmed."</TE>
<TE>   Mahony said endowment funds for St. John's Seminary in Camarillo
and scholarships for Catholic elementary and high school students, as
well as archdiocesan operational costs, have been particularly hard
hit by reversals in the stock market.</TE>
<TE>   Asked if there would be layoffs, Tamberg said Friday that he did
not know, but added that so far the archdiocese has managed to cut
personnel costs through attrition. "We just have not hired people
when other folks have left," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Tamberg said he could not immediately determine how much money the
archdiocese has lost because of the decline on Wall Street. But the
much smaller Diocese of Orange--with a budget roughly a tenth the
size of Los Angeles'--reported that its investment income for the
period of July 1, 2000, to June 30, 2001, fell $20 million from the
previous year's figure.</TE>
<TE>   Even without a formal budget, cuts have taken place. For example,
the archdiocese's department of Catholic schools has seen its
operating budget, which does not include teacher salaries, cut 30%
over the last two years, said Father Albert DiUlio, the department
president.</TE>
<TE>   He said that amounts to about a $33,000 cut from a $100,000 budget
over two years. Most of those cuts came out of travel and office
expenses.</TE>
<TE>   DiUlio said the retrenchment has not yet affected the size or
number of scholarships for elementary and high school students.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, he said, the number of students receiving scholarships
will increase to 5,000 this year from 4,700 last year, thanks to
extra donations.</TE>
<TE>   At downtown Los Angeles' Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels,
which will have a separate budget from the archdiocese, leaders of
various ministries report that they still don't know what they will
be able to spend.</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, some, like the head of Cathedral Charities--an
outreach to the poor, homeless and those in jail--is moving ahead
with a modest program largely staffed by volunteers.</TE>
<TE>   In a time of fiscal retrenchment, Mahony also cut back the extent
and cost of celebrations planned for the cathedral's dedication.</TE>
<TE>   Two weeks of events have been pared to one week. Only soft drinks,
rather than lunch, will be served after the dedication ceremony next
month.</TE>
<TE>   Mahony has also been looking for ways to cut the cathedral's
operating costs.</TE>
<TE>   For example, the archdiocese will wash the windows once a year
instead of four times as first planned, he said. In addition, there
will be only two priests and a deacon assigned to the staff full
time.</TE>
<TE>   "We have so many of our people out of work," Mahony conceded
recently. "The cathedral's got to be a spiritual center primarily. So
we have to cut back on expenses on the operations, expenses on the
staff, to meet the times," he said.</TE>
<TE>   A new cathedral finance council is working on projections for the
complex's annual operating costs, but Tamberg said it will be at
least a year before anything is known for certain.</TE>
<TE>   Even if the stock market hits a much anticipated bottom and begins
to recover, the extent of the archdiocese's financial exposure
because of future sexual abuse costs remains anyone's guess.</TE>
<TE>   As a nonprofit religious organization, the archdiocese's financial
records, unlike those of a government agency, are not open to the
public.</TE>
<TE>   So far, Tamberg said, the archdiocesan payouts to sexual abuse
victims have been relatively minimal, totaling $3.5 million, most of
it covered by insurance. But that sum could pale in comparison to
future costs.</TE>
<TE>   The national scandal over priestly abuse, sparked by a case in
Boston early this year, focuses on Roman Catholic dioceses that
failed to fire priests accused of abuse.</TE>
<TE>   In response, more than 200 priests have been dismissed from
American dioceses, and law enforcement agencies and attorneys for
victims have followed by pressing lawsuits.</TE>
<TE>   In the Los Angeles Archdiocese, law enforcement is investigating
60 present or former archdiocesan priests suspected of sexually
abusing minors over the years.</TE>
<TE>   Attorneys representing 50 alleged victims filed a class-action
suit last month against the archdiocese.</TE>
<TE>   Adding to the archdiocese's potential liability is a new
California law that takes effect in January.</TE>
<TE>   Drafted to aid victims of priestly abuse, it suspends the statute
of limitations for one year for lawsuits claiming that an institution
allowed a known molester to continue to work and that the person went
on to sexually abuse another child.</TE>
<TE>   The law has the potential of dramatically increasing a church's
liability for decades-old cases, according to both plaintiffs'
lawyers and church officials.</TE>
<TE>   Aside from the actual cost of attorneys' fees, settlements and
psychological counseling for victims, there is widespread concern
that the scandal will reduce contributions to the church by major
donors and rank-and-file Catholics alike. That has been the case in
the Boston Archdiocese.</TE>
<TE>   Although Tamberg said Friday that contributions to the cathedral
and to parish churches have not been affected by the scandal, others
worry that hard times may be ahead--particularly if the church fails
to be candid with donors about the cost of sexual abuse cases.</TE>
<TE>   The president of an association of privately endowed foundations
that give money to Catholic causes warned in June that the crisis
would have "profoundly negative repercussions" on Catholic giving.</TE>
<TE>   Francis J. Butler, president of Foundations and Donors Interested
in Catholic Activities, called for "clear and transparent financial
reporting" by the church.</TE>
<TE>   In a letter to Bishop Wilton D. Gregory, president of the U.S.
Conference of Catholic Bishops, Butler cautioned, "In the absence of
such disclosure, donor uncertainty will increase. Many will begin to
wonder whether future donations intended for the church's work might
instead be diverted to settle claims."</TE>
<TE>   The Los Angeles Archdiocese's annual public accounting is usually
published every December in its weekly newspaper, The Tidings,
Tamberg said.</TE>
<TE>   But he said he does not know when the statement due last December
will be printed.</TE>
<TE>   Overall, Mahony sounds pessimistic. "The [sexual abuse] scandal
aside, we really are ... not going to be able to offer all of the
things, archdiocesanwide, [that] we did before," he said during a
wide-ranging July 2 discussion with Times editors and reporters.</TE>
<TE>   "I see nothing on the horizon that is going to change the economy
of this country," he said. "I've had an economist tell me we'll be
lucky to see a 1% increase per year in return on stocks, and that's
maybe 2005 or 2006. That's very grave. I can't afford to allow the
archdiocese to get caught off guard. In other words, I would welcome
a turnaround in the market. I can't count on one."</TE>

<HD>Fault Lines in Law Leave Homes on Shaky Ground</HD>
<DH>Development: Land that has passed inspection can still
prove unstable for homeowners.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EVAN HALPER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>When Ron Muranaka paid $564,000 for a stucco Colonial in Yorba Linda
with dramatic views of the Chino Hills, he was vaguely aware that the
area was earthquake-prone. But so was the rest of California, he
figured.</LD>
<LD>   Seven years later, his yard cracked apart. Then the driveway
split. The living room walls separated and door frames warped.</LD>
<LD>   But all that paled next to what happened early one summer morning
in 1999: With a roar, much of the backyard slid 40 feet down a cliff.</LD>
<TE>   Geologists hired by Muranaka and his wife, Dawn, reported grim
news: The Whittier fault system, which their real estate agent had
told them was miles from their house, actually ran right beneath it.
The land was shifting constantly, trapping water beneath the
foundation and undermining the property.</TE>
<TE>   "The dirt underneath us is totally unstable," said Dawn Muranaka.
"We're terrified."</TE>
<TE>   Owners of at least two dozen other houses in Yorba Linda's Bryant
Ranch development are in the same predicament. Their plight
illustrates the limitations of the Alquist-Priolo Act, the
30-year-old state law intended to prevent construction atop active
earthquake faults.</TE>
<TE>   When Bryant Ranch was being planned in the late 1970s, geologists
hired by the developers warned that an active fault line ran through
parts of some neighborhoods. The developers hired new geologists, who
declared the faults inactive. That allowed more homes to be squeezed
onto the hillsides than otherwise would have been permitted.</TE>
<TE>   It was all perfectly legal.</TE>
<TE>   Those familiar with the Alquist-Priolo Act say it's a common
pattern: When one geologist says not to build, developers find
another to tell them to go right ahead.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't know why so many developers work so hard to make the
faults disappear, but they do," said J. David Rogers, whose firm,
Geolith in Pleasant Hill, has reviewed hundreds of geological reports
for California cities.</TE>
<TE>   One of the most notorious examples occurred in the Bay Area city
of Pleasanton in the late 1980s. Detailed federal and state maps
showed that the Calaveras fault ran through a 258-acre site where 80
homes were proposed. The presence of the fault was confirmed by the
first geologist hired by the developers.</TE>
<TE>   Then another expert was brought in. He reached a different
conclusion: that the 110-mile-long fault hopped over the project
site, stopping just south of the property and picking up again beyond
the northern boundary.</TE>
<TE>   State officials expressed concern about the finding, and the U.S.
Geological Survey offered to help locate the fault lines. Pleasanton
officials declined the assistance, and the development was approved.
The homes have not suffered fault damage. City officials say they
followed the law to the letter.</TE>
<TE>   Critics say that is the problem: The Alquist-Priolo Act relies on
developers and their hired experts to assess seismic risks, and on
local officials to ensure that everything is aboveboard. Some cities
thoroughly review geologists' reports, but others lack the interest
or the expertise.</TE>
<TE>   Yorba Linda officials acknowledge that their review of the Bryant
Ranch project was limited.</TE>
<TE>   "That's for the developer to do," said Roy Stephenson, who was
city engineer when the subdivisions were approved. "We assume the
developer wouldn't want to submit false reports. That could just
bring them trouble later on."</TE>
<TE>   Earlier this year, 80 Bryant Ranch homeowners collected a
$6-million settlement from the developers and subcontractors after a
six-year court battle. The Muranakas and several others are pursuing
a separate lawsuit against the city of Yorba Linda.</TE>
<TE>   The developers say the damage to the Bryant Ranch homes is
unrelated to the Whittier fault system. They blame bad landscaping,
El Nino rains, over-watering of lawns and ill-advised pool
installations.</TE>
<TE>   "No one we have consulted has said this damage is being caused by
faults," said Bob Carlson, an attorney for Brighton Homes of Orange
County, one of the companies that developed Bryant Ranch.</TE>
<TE>   The homeowners say doubters are welcome to stop by the next time
the fault shudders.</TE>
<TE>   Steve Patterson lives with his wife in a five-bedroom Bryant Ranch
house they bought in 1990 for $584,500. Patterson woke up one morning
in the summer of 1999 to find that a large section of his backyard
had disappeared. It is now at the bottom of a 50-foot cliff, along
with a fence he had installed days before.</TE>
<TE>   "The city should have investigated this," Patterson said of the
conflicting geological findings. "There were reports that said not to
build."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Labeled Quake-Prone</TE>
<TE>   Planning for the Bryant Ranch development--high on jagged ridges
above the Riverside Freeway in north Orange County--began in 1978,
when the land was controlled by the Campeau Corp. of Canada and John
Wertin, a local real estate tycoon.</TE>
<TE>   The historic ranch was carved out of the massive Rancho Canon de
Santa Ana by John Bixby in 1875. His daughter, Susanna Bixby Bryant,
took over the cattle and citrus grove operations in 1911 and later
added a large botanical garden in memory of her father.</TE>
<TE>   Her descendants managed the property until they decided to sell it
for development.</TE>
<TE>   Campeau and Wertin merged to form CW Associates and in early 1982
hired a former assistant city manager of Yorba Linda, Brian Johnson,
to oversee development of the land.</TE>
<TE>   A major obstacle loomed. In 1980, about a quarter of the
3,300-acre ranch was declared an active earthquake zone under the
Alquist-Priolo Act.</TE>
<TE>   The law had been passed after the San Fernando Earthquake of Feb.
9, 1971, killed 65 people and caused more than $500 million in
damage. Much of the destruction resulted from "surface ruptures,"
which occur when fault movements deep underground tear gashes in the
Earth's surface.</TE>
<TE>   This is one of many kinds of earthquake damage, but geologists say
it is the easiest to prevent because areas prone to surface ruptures
are readily identified. The Alquist-Priolo Act sought to stop
construction of houses and offices in such places.</TE>
<TE>   State maps show generally where the main branch of a fault runs.
It's up to developers and their geological consultants to locate the
dozens of active, secondary branches and "threads" that run
underground in all directions. The act prohibits building homes
within 50 feet of them.</TE>
<TE>   Early drafts of the law provided for rigorous state oversight of
development in active earthquake zones and strict guidelines for
determining whether a site was safe for building. Real estate
interests lobbied hard against those provisions. Geologists also
objected, complaining that the law would leave them vulnerable to
lawsuits.</TE>
<TE>   Legislators removed the tough oversight language.</TE>
<TE>   In the case of Bryant Ranch, the state maps show that the Whittier
Fault passes through Yorba Linda as it runs 25 miles from Corona to
the Los Angeles Basin. State studies project that a 7.4-magnitude
quake is possible on the fault within the next few decades.</TE>
<TE>   In the mid-1980s, the Bryant Ranch developers hired Leighton &amp;
Associates of Irvine to map the neighborhood where Ron and Dawn
Muranaka's home sits.</TE>
<TE>   The firm determined that an active fault ran through that parcel
and at least four others were in the area. It advised building fewer
homes, with construction kept a safe distance from the fault lines.</TE>
<TE>   The discovery affected a proposed subdivision of 50 homes. The
3,300-acre site has 1,700 homes in several neighborhoods, each
developed separately.</TE>
<TE>   "The fault crossed right along the ridge just south of [the
Muranakas'] house," said Eldon Gath, a geologist with Leighton who is
regarded as an expert on the Whittier Fault system. "Then we found
another fault there we were concerned about."</TE>
<TE>   Campeau had withdrawn from the project by then, selling the ranch
to a partnership controlled by Wertin and George Argyros, now the
U.S. ambassador to Spain. The new partnership kept Leighton on for a
while. Then the firm was fired.</TE>
<TE>   "That had never happened to me before," Gath said. "To be involved
with a project all of the way up through design and then be told,
'You're out of here'--that's pretty stunning.</TE>
<TE>   "Maybe they thought we were too conservative," he said. "It costs
money to be that conservative. Some people would rather take a risk."</TE>
<TE>   Another group of geologists with a now-defunct firm, Soil and
Testing Engineers, took over from Leighton and concluded, after their
own investigation, that half a dozen more homes could safely be built
on the tract.</TE>
<TE>   A similar pattern played out with a different cast of consultants
in the other neighborhoods on the ranch. At least 18 additional homes
were built against the advice of geologists and are now cracking.</TE>
<TE>   "Builders can keep buying, buying, buying reports until they find
someone who doesn't see it, or someone whose ethics are compromised,"
said Patrick Abbott, a professor of geology at San Diego State
University and author of a widely used textbook on natural disasters.
"I remember a developer telling me he had six studies all saying
don't build. But, he said, 'The seventh one said we can build, and
that's what we are going to use.' "</TE>
<TE>   Argyros and David Ball, the principal developers for Bryant Ranch,
declined to be interviewed. Soil and Testing Engineers has long since
gone out of business. Efforts to reach the geologist who wrote the
company's report were unsuccessful.</TE>
<TE>   It was up to the city of Yorba Linda to review the geologist's
findings.</TE>
<TE>   Jim Slosson, who oversaw the Alquist-Priolo program as
California's state geologist in the late 1970s, said many cities
don't have the resources to spot-check the work done on site. A
thorough review would involve boring holes in the ground to test the
engineers' findings. That rarely happens.</TE>
<TE>   "There are all kinds of tricks being used to get around that law,"
Slosson said. "It's easy."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Officials Accused</TE>
<TE>   Bryant Ranch homeowners contend that Yorba Linda's government, at
best, had been lax in its oversight and, at worst, had engaged in
self-dealing.</TE>
<TE>   They point out that Johnson, the former assistant city manager,
went to work for the developer less than a year after leaving his
city position--a violation of state lobbying laws. Johnson, now based
in Dana Point, refused to comment.</TE>
<TE>   "We had former employees of the city acting as representatives for
developers," said Barbara Kiley, a former Yorba Linda councilwoman.
"There were no checks and balances."</TE>
<TE>   In addition, City Atty. Leonard Hampel oversaw the approval
process for Bryant Ranch while working for Argyros at another real
estate company in Orange County.</TE>
<TE>   Hampel disclosed his connection to Argyros in a letter he sent to
then-City Manager Arthur Simonian, who ruled that Hampel need not
recuse himself. Simonian later left the city's employ after an
outside auditor found that he had awarded unauthorized raises to
himself and colleagues on the city payroll.</TE>
<TE>   Kiley and other council members said they learned only years later
that Hampel had been working for Argyros.</TE>
<TE>   "I had no idea," said former Mayor Gene Wisner. "He never recused
himself."</TE>
<TE>   City meeting minutes also show that Yorba Linda officials
accommodated the developers' wish to downplay the seismic hazards at
Bryant Ranch.</TE>
<TE>   Johnson asked the Planning Commission in 1982 for permission to
delete the term "active earthquake zone" from disclosure documents to
be given to prospective home buyers in the neighborhood where the
Muranakas now live. He expressed concern that such a designation
would be too "stark" and might frighten off buyers.</TE>
<TE>   The commission obliged, and said home buyers could be told that
they were moving into a "potentially active" earthquake zone--a
description that applies to nearly all of California.</TE>
<TE>   When the City Council approved the project in 1987, it sanctioned
the "potentially active" language.</TE>
<TE>   Disclosure has consistently been a problem with the earthquake
law. State studies show that many homeowners living in Alquist-Priolo
zones have no idea what that means.</TE>
<TE>   In some cases, the homeowners have been told that the so-called
earthquake special study zones are the safest places to be, because
scientists have studied the areas and certified them as safe.</TE>
<TE>   A 1991 state Department of Conservation report on the law said
that the risk of buying a house in an earthquake zone is "typically
understated and not even known about" by purchasers.</TE>
<TE>   That conclusion remains valid today, said the report's author,
Robert Reitherman. "Some people think being in the zone means there
is no earthquake hazard," he said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Financial Effects</TE>
<TE>   For Hans Spitz, who lives across the valley from the Muranakas in
a neighborhood called Brighton Ridge, the "potentially active"
disclosure simply stated the obvious for any California real estate
purchase. He didn't realize, he says, that he was actually in an area
of elevated risk when he bought his luxury six-bedroom house in
December 1989.</TE>
<TE>   Today, a giant crack runs down the wall in the master bedroom of
the Spitz home on La Fiesta. One side of the living room is four
inches lower than the other. The floor between the kitchen and dining
room has a deep gap an inch wide, and the cabinets have become
detached from the wall.</TE>
<TE>   The foundation has been warped by shifts and tremors.</TE>
<TE>   Spitz paid $609,000 for the house. City officials valued it at
$160,000 in their most recent assessment.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to suffer," Spitz said, whose mortgage payment is $3,400
a month. "We cannot refinance or anything with the house in this
condition."</TE>
<TE>   A few blocks away, on Avenida de Marcia, Tim and Lucy Pham can't
open most of the doors and windows in their home because the frames
are warped. Large cracks are visible everywhere: through a marble
mantel, across the ceiling, in some Roman columns installed along the
walls. The wallpaper is torn in spots.</TE>
<TE>   "I called them many times," Lucy Pham said of developer Brighton
Homes. "They said I would have to sign a paper saying I wouldn't sue
them if I wanted to get the house fixed."</TE>
<TE>   The Phams refused to sign and instead joined Spitz and 79 other
property owners in a lawsuit that was settled several months ago.</TE>
<TE>   The Spitzes and Phams have been offered $60,000 each out of the
$6-million settlement pool. The families rejected the money and have
hired a new lawyer in an attempt to get a larger piece of the
settlement.</TE>
<TE>   The Muranakas say they have spent $260,000 on lawyers, engineers
and other consultants in their quest to get out and get compensated.
The bills ate up all but $12,000 of a separate settlement they
reached with the developers and subcontractors last month. The
Muranakas and their neighbors still have a suit pending against the
city.</TE>
<TE>   Real estate agents have told the couple that the house is close to
worthless. Dawn Muranaka says she lives in fear that the entire
hillside will collapse before this is all settled.</TE>
<TE>   "They need to buy our house back and pay the attorneys fees," she
said. "They can't just fix a few things and walk away. No one will
buy this house after the problems we discovered. The city should
condemn it and not let anyone live here again."</TE>

<HD>As Economy Sours, Bush Takes It Out on Lawyers</HD>
<DH>Politics: Barbs show a disdain for 'frivolous lawsuits'
that he says 'can ruin an honest business.' His hostility has stalled
major legislation.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EDWIN CHEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>CRAWFORD, Texas</DL>
<LD>President Bush doesn't care much for lawyers, and it shows.</LD>
<LD>   Even when talking about the war on terrorism, he finds a way to
bash them, although cloaking his contempt in humor. Such barbs
occasionally baffle his audiences, but usually elicit guffaws all
around.</LD>
<LD>   The bad blood between Bush and trial lawyers is neither a mystery
nor a laughing matter. Such attorneys make their living suing big
businesses, which tend to be cozy with the GOP; and many of them
donate tons of their earnings to Democratic candidates.</LD>
<TE>   Bush's hostility is a primary reason behind the holdup in Congress
of some key legislation, including a patients' bill of rights and a
terrorism insurance measure. The president's antagonism toward the
plaintiffs' bar, and his efforts to restrict litigation, have
surfaced in an array of issues.</TE>
<TE>   Now Bush is exploiting trial lawyers in an effort to inoculate
himself from voter displeasure with the sluggish economy and
corporate corruption.</TE>
<TE>   Leading up to the economic forum he is hosting Tuesday in nearby
Waco, Texas, Bush has been furiously plugging the notion that
restrictions on lawsuits would be a sure-fire tonic for an ailing
economy.</TE>
<TE>   Whatever economists think of that argument, it certainly has
political resonance. "It's tough to defend business these days, but
it's still profitable to attack trial lawyers," said Larry J. Sabato,
a University of Virginia political scientist.</TE>
<TE>   Lashing out at trial lawyers may come as second nature to Bush, a
University of Texas Law School reject before he enrolled at the
Harvard Graduate School of Business.</TE>
<TE>   As Texas governor, he waged a titanic and ultimately successful
crusade for tort reform, backed by business moguls such as former
Enron Corp. Chairman Kenneth L. Lay. Along the way, Bush and fellow
Republicans collected millions of dollars in contributions from
corporate interests that have a stake in seeing limits imposed on
trial lawyers.</TE>
<TE>   White House Communications Director Dan Bartlett, who also worked
on Bush's gubernatorial staff, said his boss' views toward the
plaintiffs' bar were shaped by his years in Austin, Texas.</TE>
<TE>   "The judicial system and the civil system were completely out of
whack. It was rigged against the common taxpayer, who was trying to
run a business, meet payroll and provide for his family," Bartlett
said.</TE>
<TE>   "This is something he understands and feels strongly about."</TE>
<TE>   Bush may have inherited some of his dislike of lawyers from his
father. The 41st president railed against the plaintiffs' bar on
national TV during his 1992 acceptance speech at the Republican
National Convention, describing them as "sharp lawyers" in tasseled
loafers "running wild."</TE>
<TE>   Such attacks are nothing more than a "Trojan horse," said Linda
Lipsen, a spokeswoman for the Washington-based Assn. of Trial Lawyers
of America.</TE>
<TE>   "Attacking trial lawyers is good for fund-raising. Bush is raising
money from corporations that put products out there that roll over
and tires that explode--corporations that don't want to be regulated
by Congress or the courts," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Among the proposals stalled in Congress is a terrorism insurance
bill that would provide government assistance in insuring against
major loss from terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   Hit with huge claims after the Sept. 11 attacks, insurers are
refusing to issue policies covering catastrophic events. This has
caused developers to delay large commercial real estate projects
until they can get government help in paying sky-high insurance
rates.</TE>
<TE>   Republicans and Democrats agree on the need for such a bill, but
it has stalled because Republicans insist on imposing limits on
lawsuits and punitive damages.</TE>
<TE>   The stalemate, Bush said in Madison, Miss., on Wednesday, is
costing the nation billions of dollars worth of job-rich construction
projects.</TE>
<TE>   "We need to get a terrorism insurance bill that will provide some
surety so that these commercial projects can go forward, so that our
construction workers will be back to work," the president said.</TE>
<TE>   But the bill must not "provide a gravy train for personal injury
lawyers," he said in May at a GOP fund-raiser in Columbus, Ohio.</TE>
<TE>   More recently, the president denounced trial lawyers for what he
called an "explosion" in medical malpractice litigation.</TE>
<TE>   "Junk and frivolous lawsuits can ruin an honest business," Bush
said, adding that such litigation is a major reason behind the rising
cost of health care.</TE>
<TE>   The popular patients' bill of rights, designed to empower
consumers by imposing new standards for health insurers and HMOs,
also has foundered because of disagreements over the rights of
patients to sue and over caps on damages for serious injuries.</TE>
<TE>   Party differences over the role of trial lawyers also have figured
in other matters.</TE>
<TE>   The corporate responsibility measure was slowed in part because of
a squabble over how much time consumers and investors should have to
sue a company and its officers.</TE>
<TE>   Despite his strongly held view, Bush signed a bill that doubled,
to two years, the time during which such lawsuits may be filed--a
reflection of his determination to avoid being tainted by the
corporate scandals.</TE>
<TE>   Another issue that has raised hackles at the White House centers
on how much senior officials might have known before Sept. 11 about
an impending terrorist attack.</TE>
<TE>   Some trial lawyers contend that the existence of government
warnings supports claims of negligence brought against the airlines
whose jets were hijacked.</TE>
<TE>   At Bush's insistence, even the now-enacted education reform bill,
one of his top priorities, included a "teacher protection" clause to
limit lawsuits.</TE>
<TE>   "It says that teachers and principals and school board members can
take reasonable actions to maintain order and discipline in the
classroom without the fear of being sued," the president said May 8
at a Milwaukee high school.</TE>
<TE>   "And that's good law--I don't like it when frivolous lawsuits
disrupt quality education."</TE>
<TE>   Bush also has taken his fight with lawyers beyond the plaintiffs'
bar.</TE>
<TE>   Shortly after he took office, the White House eliminated the
American Bar Assn.'s semi-official role in the vetting of potential
candidates for the federal bench, arguing that the ABA was biased
against conservative judges.</TE>
<TE>   For his part, the president seems content to press his case
against the profession by using a touch of humor.</TE>
<TE>   In his favorite riff, Bush cites the Sept. 11 hijackers, and then
adds as he did at a GOP fund-raiser last month in Washington:</TE>
<TE>   "They must have thought we were so soft, and so materialistic and
so self-absorbed that all we would do is call our favorite
plaintiff's attorney and file a few lawsuits."</TE>

<HD>Deported Muslim Said to Have Had Al Qaeda Ties</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SALT LAKE CITY</DL>
<LD>A Muslim cleric who raised suspicions a year ago by asking questions
about security at the Winter Olympics here and was deported for an
immigration violation may have been a member of Al Qaeda, a federal
prosecutor said.</LD>
<LD>   State Department officials told U.S. Atty. Paul Warner they knew
something about the cleric, Ghulam Rasool Chisthi, that they couldn't
disclose at the time, Warner said.</LD>
<LD>   Warner said Friday that he only recently learned from the State
Department that the information they had, from Italian authorities,
linked Chisthi to an alleged Al Qaeda plot to bomb St. Peter's Square
in Vatican City. It was apparently called off as Osama bin Laden made
even deadlier plans for Sept. 11, Warner said.</LD>
<TE>   Warner said he didn't know why the agency declined to tell him
about the suspected Al Qaeda link earlier.</TE>
<TE>   The State Department had no comment Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   Chisthi, 59, from Pakistan, has denied any involvement with Al
Qaeda.</TE>
<TE>   "By the grace of God ... I am not a terrorist," he told the Salt
Lake Tribune in a jailhouse interview a week after the attacks on the
World Trade Center and the Pentagon.</TE>
<TE>   "I have nothing to do with Osama bin Laden."</TE>
<TE>   Chisthi was arrested and deported after visiting the University of
Utah for a religious conference for five days in May and June last
year, staying at what was to become the Olympic Village for athletes.</TE>
<TE>   While there, he asked questions about security, living
arrangements for athletes and the planned appearance by President
Bush at the Games' opening, Warner said.</TE>
<TE>   Chisthi was convicted of lying on his visa by failing to disclose
rape convictions in England. He was jailed eight months, then
deported.</TE>
<TE>   "We didn't have any evidence that he was planning an attack" at
the Winter Games, Warner said. "But I didn't want to find out the
hard way."</TE>

<HD>Options Few for Fed, Bush Meetings</HD>
<DH>Economy: Little action is expected at gatherings Tuesday in
Washington and Texas. Fiscal experts say just about all that can be
done to spur growth already has been done.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PETER G. GOSSELIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Federal Reserve policymakers and a White House-selected roster of
experts convene half a continent apart this week to respond to a
sputtering economy, troubling financial signals from abroad and a
depressed stock market.</LD>
<LD>   But as officials weigh their options, they won't find many,
economists say. Washington has already used most of its weapons for
handling economic trouble.</LD>
<LD>   "The policy quiver has been depleted and, absent a major crisis,
I'm not confident that we will use what remains wisely," said former
Federal Reserve governor and Clinton administration economic advisor
Janet L. Yellen, now at UC Berkeley.</LD>
<TE>   "There's no obvious silver bullet," added former Congressional
Budget Office Director Robert D. Reischauer, now president of the
Urban Institute, a Washington think tank. "We're going to have to
tighten our belts one notch and grind this one out."</TE>
<TE>   Federal Reserve officials gather Tuesday in Washington to consider
whether to cut interest rates. On the same day, President Bush hosts
a forum in Waco, Texas, that aides say is designed to highlight the
economy's fundamental soundness.</TE>
<TE>   As Democrats took potshots at the guest list in Waco, calling it
top-heavy with corporate chieftains, Bush noted Saturday in his
weekly radio address that he has also invited workers and
small-business owners for advice on what to do. He said he is "eager
to hear from Americans from all walks of life, who are working hard
to make ends meet in these uncertain economic times."</TE>
<TE>   But the weapon of choice will almost certainly be words, not
deeds.</TE>
<TE>   With its signal-sending federal funds rate already at a
four-decade low, the central bank is expected to issue a statement
acknowledging the risks to the economy, but to put off further rate
cuts.</TE>
<TE>   The White House concluded several weeks ago that it had done most
of what it could for the economy, and that its biggest job now is
convincing Americans that that's enough.</TE>
<TE>   Washington's shortage of policy options is in no small measure the
result of its aggressive use of tax- and interest-rate cuts and
spending increases when the economy began to falter 18 months ago
after a record-setting decade of growth.</TE>
<TE>   As recently as last year, the Fed's key interest rate stood at 6%,
rather than its current 1.75%. And the government was running a
$127-billion budget surplus, according to the CBO, instead of what is
expected to be a $150-billion deficit this year.</TE>
<TE>   Most analysts think the combination of rapid interest rate
reductions by the Fed and at least the early stages of the
president's 10-year, $1.35-trillion tax cut was just what the economy
needed and helped keep the country from suffering a longer, deeper
recession than it ultimately did.</TE>
<TE>   "It was an effort to do the right thing and do it early," said
Allen Sinai, chief global economist for the consulting firm Decision
Economics Inc. in New York.</TE>
<TE>   The conventional wisdom--and an explanation popular with the White
House--for why Washington's early and aggressive actions have yet to
return the country to steady growth is that they were derailed by the
September terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   But economists have become increasingly impressed at how little
the attacks affected the overall economy after the initial shock. If
anything, they say, it is the subsequent violence in the Middle East
and the threat of a U.S. invasion of Iraq, rather than the
destruction of the World Trade Center, that have weighed on growth.</TE>
<TE>   Recent revisions of the gross domestic product, which measures the
nation's total output of goods and services, show that the economy
shrank during the first nine months of last year and only resumed
growth in the final three months after the attacks.</TE>
<TE>   If the attacks had less effect on the economy than had been
thought, some analysts worry that the stock market's long slide and
the recent corporate scandals may be having a much greater effect.
"We're off the map of post-World War II history with this stock
collapse," said Sinai, who is slated to participate in Tuesday's
White House-sponsored forum.</TE>
<TE>   "The stock market is hurting the economy and the economy is
hurting the stock market, and it's all wrapped together in a scary,
1930s-like [stock market collapse] that could end badly," he said.</TE>
<TE>   These analysts are particularly worried that, despite a small
increase in equipment and software spending last quarter, corporate
America has still not shown much interest in resuming the kind of
capital investments that helped fuel growth and improve economic
efficiency in the final years of the 1990s. And without the
investments, consumers are left to keep growth going on their own.</TE>
<TE>   Consumers have proved incredibly responsive as the Fed pushed
interest rates lower and lower, snapping up cars and houses at record
rates. But analysts fear that the buying binge threatens to leave
households overextended--and especially vulnerable to any real estate
downturn.</TE>
<TE>   In such circumstances, one might think the Fed and the
administration would rush to use whatever further tax- and
interest-rate cuts are still feasible to try to ensure that the
economy does not slip back. And in fact, the Fed does appear ready to
cut interest rates, although not until later this year.</TE>
<TE>   But to date, the administration has been reluctant to take
substantial new steps.</TE>
<TE>   That appears to be equally because the White House thinks the
economy is mending and not in need of extra help, and because most
substantial new steps would require Bush to agree to change the
10-year tax cut that is considered his grandest legislative
accomplishment to date.</TE>
<TE>   Sinai and some other economists say Bush should agree to roll back
tax cuts planned for later in the decade and use the savings for
growth-spurring cuts now.</TE>
<TE>   Yellen has called for a similar rollback, with the money to go for
expanded unemployment compensation and grants to cash-strapped
states.</TE>
<TE>   Either way, the result would be to open the Bush tax package to
renewed debate, something that White House officials have made clear
they will not do.</TE>
<TE>   In the absence of a big new tax or spending package, the
administration is seeking to make do with smaller steps such as
helping to bail out troubled trading partners such as Brazil and
ensuring that the arrests of corporate executives get maximum
publicity.</TE>

<HD>Firms Sell Gene Tests Directly to Public</HD>
<DH>Health: Marketing has experts worried. They fear that
consumers will be tempted to buy tests that are unneeded or of
doubtful value.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>AARON ZITNER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>When a slew of medical problems hit at once, Peter Dyck found himself
taking an array of drugs: three for a heart condition, one for a
digestive disorder and two for other ailments. It left him wondering
how his body was handling all the medications.</LD>
<LD>   So Dyck, an electrician in Portland, Ore., swabbed some cells from
inside his cheek and sent them to a Seattle company for genetic
analysis. Two weeks later came the report: Dyck's body was programmed
to break down one of his drugs unusually slowly, a warning that the
drug might be building to harmful levels in his bloodstream.</LD>
<LD>   "The information was pretty amazing," said Dyck, who took the
report to his doctor. "We ended up downgrading the dosage."</LD>
<TE>   Scientists have long promised that the gene revolution would open
an era of "personalized medicine," with health care and nutrition
tailored to each person's unique genetic makeup.</TE>
<TE>   But understanding how genes work has proved difficult. Although
more than 100 diseases can be diagnosed by searching for particular
genes, those diseases are generally uncommon and testing has been
limited to the small world of genetic disease specialists.</TE>
<TE>   Now, a handful of companies is bypassing the specialists and
marketing directly to consumers. The firms are offering tests not
only to diagnose disease, but also that claim to help people pick the
medications, vitamins and even skin creams that work best with their
genes. The costs range from hundreds to thousands of dollars.</TE>
<TE>   The marketing efforts have many experts worried that consumers,
driven by the fear of disease and the allure of gene research, will
be prompted to buy tests that are unneeded or of doubtful value. Some
say the tests available so far can produce confusing results that can
mislead patients.</TE>
<TE>   The push into the U.S. consumer market also comes as federal
health officials consider whether to retreat from regulating genetic
tests, most of which may be sold without a review of their usefulness
or marketing claims by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.</TE>
<TE>   Bewildered by the array of nutritional supplements? GeneLink Inc.
of New Jersey says its test, available as of Aug. 2, tells clients
which mix of vitamins is best for them. Sciona Ltd. of England offers
customized nutritional advice based on DNA and a health
questionnaire. Personalized skin creams and anti-aging formulas are
also in the works.</TE>
<TE>   Other companies help diagnose diseases. HealthcheckUSA of San
Antonio sells a mail-order test for hereditary hemochromatosis, a
disorder that causes iron build-up in the blood. Customers do not
need to show the company a physician's approval, and results are
reported directly to them. A spokesman says tests for cystic fibrosis
and factor V Leiden, a blood-clotting disorder, will be available
within weeks.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Small Numbers</TE>
<TE>   It's too early to know how consumers will respond to these tests.
Genetic tests for metabolism and general health have not been widely
available in the U.S. even from doctors. Although a growing number of
people have used genetic tests obtained from doctors to diagnose
diseases or help with reproductive decisions, their numbers are small
because the diseases diagnosed by these tests are not common.</TE>
<TE>   Still, various health experts have been urging the FDA to review
tests before they are sold, much as the agency reviews drugs and
medical devices. "If there are claims about products that might not
pan out and might hurt people, wouldn't you want the government
looking at it?" asked Dr. Richard Roberts, chairman of the American
Academy of Family Physicians.</TE>
<TE>   Others say that before testing becomes widespread, laws are needed
to prevent employers and insurers from using the results to penalize
people.</TE>
<TE>   The FDA has spent two years developing an oversight plan, but the
agency now says it may not have legal authority to regulate the
tests. Agency lawyers are reviewing the question. "This was a
surprise, because the FDA had said in the past that they had
statutory authority," said Kate Beardsley, a Washington lawyer who
specializes in FDA law.</TE>
<TE>   Separately, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services is
considering whether to disband an advisory panel of experts who
called on the FDA to tighten regulations two years ago. The
committee's August meeting has been postponed until officials
complete a review not only of this panel but also of the other 257
groups that advise the department on policy matters.</TE>
<TE>   A department official said it was only to be expected that the
Bush administration would revisit actions started under President
Clinton. "You have to give every administration the right to review
key issues," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the questions, many people are enthusiastic about home DNA
tests.</TE>
<TE>   "I was really glad it was there," said Brooke Shiotani, a
25-year-old pharmacy student in Seattle. Shiotani tried the drug
metabolism test, offered by Genelex Corp. of Redmond, Wash., after
she had adverse reactions to several antidepressants. She worried
that her body was slow in breaking down the drugs and that the
medication was lingering in her body.</TE>
<TE>   The $250 test showed that Shiotani processed the drugs at normal
rates. "But that gave me peace of mind that my doctors weren't
overdosing me," she said.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Another Tool</TE>
<TE>   The tests are just one new tool for patients who want to monitor
their own health. Bypassing the family doctor, clinics offer
full-body radiological scans that look for signs of disease. Viagra
and other prescription drugs are available on the Internet. Some
commercial laboratories allow clients to roll up a sleeve and order
their own blood test, checking everything from cholesterol levels to
signs of ovarian cancer.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a need and a strong desire to take charge of your health,
and we're giving people the ability to do this," said Holt Vaughan,
an official at HealthcheckUSA.</TE>
<TE>   Some doctors bristle at the trend. Unless people have a good
reason to be tested, they say, tests can create more problems than
benefits. Full-body scans, for example, sometimes produce images of
tiny tumors that turn out not to exist, said Dr. Benjamin Wilfond, a
bioethics researcher at the National Institutes of Health. He said
this provokes needless anxiety.</TE>
<TE>   Genetic tests in particular pose tricky questions about who should
be tested and what the results mean.</TE>
<TE>   The tests look for mutations or subtle variations that make one
person's genes different from another's. Sometimes, these mutations
are associated with disease or other health conditions, but only
remotely, and experts say patients should review test results with
doctors or genetic counselors.</TE>
<TE>   Other genetic mutations are strongly associated with disease.
Women with certain forms of the BRCA 1 and BRCA 2 genes, for example,
are thought to face an 85% chance of getting breast cancer by age 70.</TE>
<TE>   But that does not mean every woman should be tested. Because BRCA
genes account for no more than 10% of breast cancer cases, many
experts say the tests are best used by women who have a reason to
think they carry the genes. These include women whose relatives have
been diagnosed with breast or ovarian cancer.</TE>
<TE>   Utah-based Myriad Genetics Inc. plans a trial run of television
and radio advertisements in the fall for its breast and ovarian
cancer tests. The tests are available only through doctors, but the
campaign marks the first effort to mass-market them.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Some Coverage</TE>
<TE>   The cost will range from $295 for someone with a known genetic
defect in the family--and therefore only one gene to test--to $2,800
for someone with no such defect. Myriad says insurance generally
covers the cost for people with a family history of breast or ovarian
cancer. Critics already have complained that Myriad's limited print
ads have targeted women who are not good candidates for testing.
"Almost every woman overestimates her risk of breast cancer, and
these ads are encouraging people to take that overestimation to their
primary care physician, who is not trained in genetics, and to ask
for this very expensive test," said Barbara Brenner of Breast Cancer
Action, a San Francisco-based advocacy group.</TE>
<TE>   "This will be worse with TV ads," she said, "because there's a lot
less information than in print ads, and the impression people will
get will be all positive about the benefits of the test."</TE>
<TE>   The radio and TV ads will run for five months in Atlanta and
Denver. Myriad will also start promoting the tests to 200,000 primary
care physicians nationwide.</TE>
<TE>   A Myriad spokesman, Bill Hockett, said the company's ads "are
intended to be clear that breast cancer genetic screening is not for
everyone." He said the company had previously focused on telling
cancer doctors about its tests. But that effort "could not reach the
majority of women who could be helped, because they haven't been
diagnosed with cancer."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Evidence Lacking</TE>
<TE>   Critics of consumer marketing are less worried about DNA testing
that aims to give people nutritional advice or information about
their overall health. But some specialists say there is not yet
enough evidence that people should change their diet or medication
based on their DNA.</TE>
<TE>   Sciona, for example, studies nine genes as part of its $200
assessment of a person's general health, including one gene named
MTHFR.</TE>
<TE>   Some people have a form of MTHFR that reduces their ability to
process folic acid, an important vitamin. When the company finds
clients with this form of the gene, it recommends that they eat more
foods rich in folic acid, such as asparagus, broccoli and yeast.</TE>
<TE>   Chris Martin, chief executive of Sciona, said he fell into this
group. He said the gene test, which showed that folic acid was
important for him in particular, inspired him to start eating
Marmite, the yeasty sandwich spread popular in Britain. "There's no
way I would do that based just on a newspaper article that said folic
acid is important." He said the company's claims for its test were
supported by more than 300 peer-reviewed scientific papers.</TE>
<TE>   Several specialists said there could be little harm in
recommending that people eat a diet rich in folic acid, which is
thought to help anyone avoid cardiovascular disease and other
ailments. But they said it is premature to claim that some people
needed more folate than others because of their MTHFR gene.</TE>
<TE>   "We have some suggestive data, but we do not have the clinical
data we need to be confident that certain genetic profiles should
lead to specific diets," said Dr. Wylie Burke, who leads the
department of medical history and ethics at the University of
Washington. "There is no one we've identified who would be a
candidate for these tests. Their predictive value is unknown."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Link to Health Woes</TE>
<TE>   Wilfond, of the NIH, raised another question: Different versions
of MTHFR have been associated with heart disease, colon cancer and
blood clotting, though the link is not always clear. "At what point
is it necessary," he asked, "for it to be explained to people that
there are all these possible meanings" to the result of an MTHFR
test?</TE>
<TE>   Sciona has sold about 600 of its tests since last summer, some
through the mail to customers in the United States and elsewhere. It
also sold them through British pharmacies and retail stores. But many
stores dropped the kit this summer when a consumer watchdog group
said the tests were potentially misleading.</TE>
<TE>   The company now sells the tests only through doctors and
dietitians. It plans a push into the U.S. market in September.
GeneLink sells its DNA tests to other companies, which in turn sell
nutritional and skin care products they say are personalized for each
customer. The company does not reveal which genes it tests.</TE>
<TE>   "People are taking handfuls of vitamins, and it may be doing them
some harm," said John DePhillipo, GeneLink's chief executive. "We can
say that you may not need these vitamins; you may need less. So,
we're specifically targeting a regimen just for you."</TE>
<TE>   Under current law, laboratories must make sure their equipment,
chemicals and practices meet federal standards.</TE>
<TE>   The FDA is deciding whether to go further. One question is whether
genetic tests are medical devices, which the FDA regulates, or
doctors' services, which it doesn't. Because the tests are sometimes
customized for individual patients and the results often require so
much interpretation, some argue that they are more like a service.</TE>
<TE>   Another question is whether all genetic tests should be regulated,
or only those that diagnose disease.</TE>
<TE>   If it decides to act, the FDA could ask test providers to show
that their claims are truthful. The agency could also bar tests from
the market until providers show that test results actually help
physicians and patients make decisions.</TE>
<TE>   Some worry that proving this could require long experience with a
large number of clients and that many tests could not meet a high
standard for usefulness.</TE>
<TE>   "If you applied full FDA review, we wouldn't have very many
genetic tests in the world today," said Elliott Hillback Jr., senior
vice president at Genzyme Corp. in Cambridge, Mass., and a member of
the Department of Health panel on genetic testing. Beardsley and
Burke are also members of that committee.</TE>
<TE>   Some say that would be a mistake, because the tests have proved
helpful.</TE>
<TE>   Dyck, 49, said the drug metabolism test seemed useful. It not only
guided him to a better dosage for his heart medication but also
helped explain a problem he had several years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Dyck was hospitalized in 1993 with a blood clot in his leg, and
doctors were giving him a blood thinner to prevent the clot from
breaking off and causing damage. But it took a week before they could
figure out the right dosage, which kept Dyck in the hospital.</TE>
<TE>   Sure enough, Dyck said, the genetic test he took recently shows
that his body is unusually slow to metabolize the blood thinner.</TE>
<TE>   "If they had had this information, maybe they would have been able
to narrow down the field of doses to give me," he said, "and I would
have gotten out sooner."</TE>

<HD>Scientist's Lawyers Protest Treatment in Anthrax Inquiry</HD>
<DH>Probe: The letter to the Justice Dept. decries leaks on
searches of the weapon expert's home.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Lawyers for Steven J. Hatfill, a bioweapons expert under scrutiny in
the anthrax attacks, have complained to the Justice Department about
its treatment of their client, including the recent highly publicized
search of his apartment complex.</LD>
<LD>   Their complaints came last week in a letter sent soon after the
Aug. 1 search and in a meeting Wednesday with the federal prosecutor
overseeing the anthrax investigation, said Pat Clawson, a friend of
Hatfill's who is acting as a spokesman for his legal team.</LD>
<LD>   "We told him we were dissatisfied with the pattern of leaks and
statements made by federal agents about Steve Hatfill," Clawson said
Saturday, speaking for attorney Victor M. Glasberg.</LD>
<TE>   Also at the meeting was Jonathan Shapiro, a criminal defense
attorney Hatfill hired after scrutiny intensified in the last two
weeks.</TE>
<TE>   Hatfill, who has denied involvement in the attacks, has not spoken
at any length about the matter but planned to deliver a statement
today at his lawyer's office in Virginia.</TE>
<TE>   In an interview published in a recent edition of the Washington
Post, Hatfill said: "I went from being someone with pride in my work
... to being made into the biggest criminal of the 21st century for
something I never touched. What I've been trying to contribute, my
work, is finished. My life is destroyed."</TE>
<TE>   The Post did not say when the interview was conducted but said
Glasberg did most of the talking during a three-hour meeting and
allowed Hatfill to make only limited comments.</TE>
<TE>   Clawson said the lawyers were particularly angry about the most
recent search of Hatfill's Frederick, Md., apartment, which has been
searched twice. Agents have also searched a storage locker Hatfill
owns in Florida.</TE>
<TE>   Clawson said Hatfill had agreed to allow the search and his
lawyers were trying to schedule a date when, on the next day, the FBI
showed up with a search warrant.</TE>
<TE>   "They were willing to cooperate and the FBI executed search
warrants instead, catching them completely by surprise," Clawson
said.</TE>
<TE>   With a news helicopter hovering overhead, FBI and Postal Service
agents wearing protective gloves searched his apartment complex.</TE>
<TE>   A day later, Hatfill was suspended with pay from Louisiana State
University's National Center for Biomedical Research and Training,
where he had just begun a job as an associate director.</TE>
<TE>   Hatfill, 48, worked from 1997 to 1999 at the Army medical research
institute at Ft. Detrick, Md., once the U.S. biological warfare
program headquarters and repository for the Ames strain of anthrax
used in the fall attacks.</TE>
<TE>   In February 1999, he commissioned a study of how an anthrax attack
might play itself out when he was working for the defense and CIA
contractor Science Applications International Corp. He was later
fired from that job under unclear circumstances.</TE>
<TE>   Many current and former scientists from Ft. Detrick and elsewhere
have submitted to polygraph tests, but Hatfill is the only person
whose name has emerged publicly.</TE>
<TE>   Law enforcement officials have said that Hatfill is not a suspect
and that no evidence links him to the anthrax letters. They have
described him as a "person of interest" in their investigation.</TE>
<TE>   Believing the culprit is domestic, authorities said Hatfill is one
of 30 scientists and researchers with the expertise and opportunity
to conduct the attacks-by-mail, which killed five people.</TE>
<TE>   Hatfill has denied any involvement in the attacks and once
complained that questions about the matter cost him his job at SAIC.</TE>
<TE>   Hatfill's statement was expected to address questions about his
background that have surfaced since he was named in the anthrax
investigation, Clawson said.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Actions 'Balanced' After 9/11, Official Says</HD>
<DH>Law: Addressing meeting of attorneys, Justice Dept. lawyer
defends legality of response.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID G. SAVAGE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The chief of the Justice Department's criminal division told a
lawyers' group Saturday that Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft has gotten "an
unfair rap" from civil libertarians and that the Bush administration
has been "very balanced and very restrained" in its legal response to
the Sept. 11 attacks.</LD>
<LD>   "We are in a time of war," Assistant Atty. Gen. Michael Chertoff
told a meeting of the American Bar Assn. "If you step back and look
at the total picture, the government has been very restrained in its
actions."</LD>
<LD>   By contrast, during World War II "they weren't asking for a
judge's permission before they shot enemy soldiers," he said.</LD>
<TE>   Chertoff has been one of the architects of the administration's
aggressive legal campaign against suspected terrorists.</TE>
<TE>   Like Ashcroft, he has stressed that the government is fighting a
war, not crime, and therefore is justified in taking steps that are
outside normal crime-fighting rules. He defended the Bush team's
record before a sometimes hostile crowd at the ABA meeting.</TE>
<TE>   Speaking before Chertoff was San Francisco attorney James J.
Brosnahan, who represented John Walker Lindh, the Marin County,
Calif., man who fought with the Taliban in Afghanistan. He drew
scattered applause when he called Ashcroft "one of the most dangerous
people ever to hold office in the history of this country."</TE>
<TE>   "I'm from out West," Brosnahan said, "and out there, we still
think we're in a free country."</TE>
<TE>   The lawyers' group is holding its annual meeting here this
weekend, and many debates and discussions have focused on the Bush
administration's response to the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks on the
World Trade Center and the Pentagon.</TE>
<TE>   While some lawyers defended the administration's approach as a
reasonable response to a new and unprecedented threat, most speakers
said the government has overreacted and ignored civil liberties.</TE>
<TE>   Laura W. Murphy, director of the American Civil Liberties Union's
Washington office, said the administration has overused the war
analogy to get its way.</TE>
<TE>   When challenged, "they always harken back to the fact that we are
at war. I've seen a level of bullying by this administration" that
bypasses Congress and the courts, she said.</TE>
<TE>   After Sept. 11, Ashcroft said he would use all available means and
every law possible to pursue terrorists and to gather information
that could head off terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   This alone marked a major shift by the government. Typically, the
government investigates and prosecutes crimes that have taken place.
However, Ashcroft and Chertoff said they wanted to detain suspects
before they could carry out further acts of terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   Since the attacks nearly a year ago, the administration has
arrested and held more than 1,200 immigrants for questioning, relaxed
rules that barred spying by the FBI, stepped up searches of foreign
students' records and announced that it would listen in on some
conversations between lawyers and their imprisoned clients.</TE>
<TE>   Ashcroft declined an invitation to speak at the ABA meeting, but
Chertoff sought to assure the rather skeptical audience.</TE>
<TE>   "You should not think you are dealing with a bunch of barbarians,"
he said. "Much more than people realize, the attorney general is
very, very conscious of civil liberties. In our discussions, he said
he wanted people to think outside the box, but never outside the
Constitution."</TE>
<TE>   Chertoff quickly added, however, that it was unrealistic to offer
"the full panoply of constitutional rights" to people who are
involved in terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   In the last year, the administration has shifted course more than
once about how to handle captured terrorist suspects.</TE>
<TE>   In November, President Bush issued an order saying he would try
suspected terrorists in military courts, which could operate in
secret. The order sparked much criticism, and the administration has
yet to hold a military trial.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, the administration has turned to the regular criminal
courts to try three men accused of terrorist offenses. Besides Lindh,
they are Zacarias Moussaoui, the alleged "20th hijacker" who faces
trial in Alexandria, Va., and Richard Reid, the accused "shoe
bomber," who faces trial in Boston.</TE>
<TE>   In Lindh's case, Brosnahan mounted a strong defense and the
government agreed to a plea bargain that will result in a 20-year
prison sentence for the American Talib. Moussaoui's trial has turned
chaotic since the French-born Muslim insisted on representing himself
in court.</TE>
<TE>   Partly as a result, the administration has turned away from trials
and said it can lock up "enemy combatants" without accusing them of a
crime or allowing them to speak to a lawyer. Chertoff said the
government's authority to hold "enemy combatants" includes U.S.
citizens arrested in this country as well as foreign soldiers
captured on the battlefield.</TE>
<TE>   "When we are talking about preventing acts of war against us ...
the judicial model does not work," he said Saturday. "This is about
prevention and incapacitation, not punishment."</TE>
<TE>   Chertoff said the government is determined to hold and interrogate
Yasser Esam Hamdi and Jose Padilla, the two U.S.-born Muslims who
have been identified as "enemy combatants" and are being held in Navy
brigs.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, ABA leaders criticized the government's handling of
those cases and said both men should be allowed to consult with
lawyers and to contest their detentions in court.</TE>

<HD>Priest Group Dissents From Sex Abuse Policy of Bishops</HD>
<DH>Religion: The organization, which is independent, questions
zero tolerance, saying clerics have abandoned the precepts of Jesus.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Washington Post</BD>
<DL>PHILADELPHIA</DL>
<LD>Judging purely from the outcome, Saturday's concluding meeting of
Roman Catholic religious orders would seem to have closed the debate
on the church's sex abuse policy: The one remaining major body of
priests adopted a zero tolerance policy toward sex offenders with
only a few minor procedural changes.</LD>
<LD>   Yet the meeting is likely to be remembered for a different
milestone. The convention of nearly 170 priests marked the first time
since the June meeting of the bishops in Dallas that dissent was
voiced publicly against zero tolerance--that a group of Catholic
leaders wondered aloud whether the bishops, under public pressure,
had promised too much.</LD>
<LD>   The dissent came from Father Canice Conners, president of the
Conference of Major Superiors of Men, a group autonomous from the
bishops that represents one-third of the nation's priests. In his
speech to the group, Conners said that by using the "war slogan" of
zero tolerance, the bishops abandoned what they and Jesus stood for:
"the miracle of grace."</LD>
<TE>   The bishops "evaporated the realities of repentance, conversion
and reconciliation," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Conners is the first to speak from such a public platform, but
signs of dissent have been building through the summer, from
dismissed priests who are challenging the policy, and from canon
lawyers who argue that key segments of it violate universal church
law and can't be implemented until the Vatican changes the law--a
process that normally takes decades.</TE>
<TE>   The resistance leaves open the possibility that priests, resentful
of the policy, might find ways around it, abuse victims worry. They
are concerned that important segments of the policy, formally called
the Charter for the Protection of Children and Young People, might
remain in legal limbo for years.</TE>
<TE>   Msgr. Francis Maniscalco, a spokesman for the bishops' conference,
said these various differences are not a question of resistance but
of "letting the charter settle" into Catholic life. The bishops have
submitted portions of the policy that might conflict with canon law
as a separate document to the Vatican and hope the differences will
be resolved on an expedited timetable.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Policy Requirements</TE>
<TE>   The policy requires the permanent removal from public ministry of
any priest who has ever abused a minor, no matter how long ago. He
could not wear clerical garb or present himself as a priest. It also
calls for the church to report all allegations of abuse involving
current minors to civil authorities, and it forbids dioceses from
making secret payments to settle sex-abuse lawsuits.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to accepting the charter, religious orders meeting
here last week adopted their own statement that began with an
apology: "We are deeply sorry--and publicly apologize for whenever
and however we failed victims or families," they wrote.</TE>
<TE>   The statement also noted the special position of religious orders
as fraternities that cannot easily reject one of their own. An abuser
"is still our brother in Christ," they wrote. "He remains a member of
our family."</TE>
<TE>   Other members at the convention, however, were concerned that that
portion of the statement appeared too lenient.</TE>
<TE>   "It can also be seen as an un-nuanced commitment to maintain
rapists and sodomists in our midst," said Father David Ullrich of
Washington, D.C. "When do we make it clear that we have exercised
some judgment in removing them from our midst?"</TE>
<TE>   Father Ted Keating, the conference's executive director, left open
the possibility that orders might establish communal houses for such
priests, and that they might be able to perform priestly functions in
the house. He did not specify how they might be supervised.</TE>
<TE>   This practice is already in place, however, and has already caused
controversy.</TE>
<TE>   After the scandal broke, Abbott John Klassen of St. John's Abbey
in Minnesota acknowledged that the place had served as a kind of safe
house for 14 abusive priests. At first he was praised for breaking
the secrecy, but then victims groups objected when they found out
Klassen had let some of the restricted monks travel, and had allowed
two to work in public ministries.</TE>
<TE>   More broadly, one of the country's top canon lawyers, Msgr. Thomas
J. Green of Catholic University, has dissected the bishops' charter,
pointing out what he found to be vague and contradictory to canon
law. In a written commentary, he concludes that the document was
hastily drafted, leaves no room for the rights of the accused and
ignores hundreds of years of church legal tradition defining the
church's responsibility to its priests.</TE>
<TE>   Green argues that the removal of priests for acts they committed
many years ago violates the statute of limitations in canon law,
which is 10 years from the victim's 18th birthday.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Church Law Cited</TE>
<TE>   Until the Vatican approves the Dallas policy, the church's
"universal law prevails over any elements of the [Dallas] norms that
may be contrary to it," wrote Green, who is on vacation and could not
be reached for comment.</TE>
<TE>   Despite such analyses, the president of the U.S. Conference of
Catholic Bishops, Bishop Wilton Gregory of Belleville, Ill., has
predicted that the Vatican will approve the charter and its
accompanying legal norms. In the meantime, Gregory has maintained,
America's bishops can put it into effect on their own.</TE>
<TE>   The bishops, however, do not appear to be in complete agreement
about the charter.</TE>
<TE>   Some of them have raised questions about the definition of sexual
abuse adopted in Dallas, which may apply to acts that do not involve
physical force or genital contact. Green echoed that concern, saying
the charter does not distinguish at all between degrees of abuse.</TE>
<TE>   Other bishops have suggested they might try to find nonministerial
jobs within the church for some abusers--a step away from Gregory's
statement in Dallas that "from this day forward, no one known to have
sexually abused a child will work in the Catholic Church in the
United States."</TE>
<TE>   One group of eight bishops is privately circulating a letter
calling for an extraordinary "plenary council" of U.S. church leaders
to combat the sexual abuse scandal by reaffirming traditional
teachings, particularly celibacy in the priesthood. The church has
not held a plenary council, which would bring together priests,
bishops and lay people, since 1884.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Appeals by Priests</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, a handful of priests is appealing to Rome to
reverse their removal from ministry, arguing that the policy adopted
by the bishops violates their rights under canon law. In such cases
church lawyers have forwarded the files to a Vatican committee in the
hopes that the appeals process will resolve some of the open
questions.</TE>
<TE>   One of the priests appealing to Rome, Father John Calicott of
Chicago, said the bishops "forgot that due process is part of canon
law."</TE>
<TE>   Calicott had admitted an incident with two teenage boys in 1976,
but psychologists at St. Luke Institute in Silver Spring, Md., had
since cleared him for ministry. "I think the bishops really felt the
public pressure in Dallas," he said last month. "They backed
themselves into a corner."</TE>

<HD>Rocky Times for NYC's Rockettes</HD>
<DH>Economy: Financially troubled owner of the troupe's venue
wants to replace dancers' roster.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>A dancers union says the current roster of Rockettes shouldn't be
kicked out of Radio City Music Hall.</LD>
<LD>   Cablevision Systems Corp., the financially troubled corporate
owner of the landmark concert venue, wants to replace the standing
roster of Rockettes with a system of open auditions. The dancers with
the trademark high-leg kicks have been working without a contract
since February.</LD>
<LD>   Talks are to resume Monday, said John Hall, a negotiator for the
American Guild of Variety Artists.</LD>
<TE>   The dance troupe has been a fixture in New York City entertainment
for 75 years and is best known for its performances in the Macy's
Thanksgiving Day Parade and the Radio City Christmas Spectacular.</TE>
<TE>   The Rockettes' performances in New York may be jeopardized if an
agreement isn't reached, Hall said.</TE>
<TE>   Cablevision has offered buyouts to dancers on Radio City's roster
of 41 Rockettes. New productions would use open auditions, with at
least half the slots filled by dancers from the previous year's show.</TE>
<TE>   That system is in place for Rockettes who work outside New York.
Many cities, including Chicago, Detroit and Atlanta, hold Rockettes
Christmas programs.</TE>
<TE>   Cablevision officials declined to comment about the contract
talks. The debt-laden conglomerate said Thursday it is slowing
spending on its cable systems, cutting staff and has plans to close
some of The Wiz electronics stores.</TE>
<TE>   Mikyl Cordova, a spokeswoman for Radio City Music Hall, wouldn't
comment about the talks but said Radio City was looking forward to
its Christmas special. "The Radio City Rockettes are the crown jewel
of Radio City entertainment," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Hall said the New York Rockettes earn $20,000 to $24,000 for their
15-week schedule and would be offered $3,000 for every year of
employment.</TE>
<TE>   "Why are you doing this to people who have served you so well and
make so little money?" Hall asked. "Not one time in all the years
that the Rockettes have been there has there been one grievance, has
there been one threat of firing because of their inability to
perform."</TE>
<TE>   Cablevision offered buyouts worth $45,000 each to the 10 dancers
employed more than 10 years. Hall called the offer inappropriately
low, noting the Rockettes rejected $100,000 buyouts several years
ago.</TE>

<HD>Great Salt Lake Level Falls to 22-Year Low</HD>
<DH>Weather: The causes are a hot summer and a lack of
precipitation. Boaters are worried.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SALT LAKE CITY</DL>
<LD>The Great Salt Lake isn't as great as it used to be.</LD>
<LD>   Lack of precipitation and a hot summer have caused the lake's
level to recede sharply. It is now at 4,198 feet above sea level, the
lowest since 1980.</LD>
<LD>   Wallace Gwynn, a geologist for the Utah Geological Survey,
predicted that the trend will bottom out this year about Dec. 1 at
4,197.15 feet. The last time it was that low was in 1972.</LD>
<TE>   Boaters, particularly those on Antelope Island, are concerned that
if the decline continues, there soon won't be enough water to launch
off the harbor without major modifications.</TE>
<TE>   John Sullivan, assistant park manager at Antelope Island, said the
marina water level is down 2 feet from last year.</TE>
<TE>   "We're almost in a drastic situation now," he said. The ends of
the docks have only 2-foot-deep water levels now, and that won't
handle some sailboats and certainly not large brine shrimp boats that
arrive in October.</TE>
<TE>   As recently as 15 years ago, massive pumps were used to try to
keep Interstate 80 from flooding and to reclaim the Antelope Island
causeway and other land from high water that caused about $250
million in damage.</TE>
<TE>   The lake normally falls each year from summer into late fall
before lower temperatures and moisture raise it in the winter and
spring.</TE>
<TE>   The lake's historic peak came during flood years of 1986 and 1987
at 4,212 feet. Its all-time low on record, 4,191.35 feet, was in
1963.</TE>
<TE>   Because it's such a shallow lake, even minor drops expose much
more land around the lake.</TE>
<TE>   At 4,200 feet, the lake covers 1,700 square miles. At its 1963
record low, it covered only 950 square miles, while at its 1986-87
high, it expanded to 3,300 square miles.</TE>
<TE>   Gwynn said low lake levels, to a point, are a boost to lake
industries such as brine shrimp harvesters and salt and chemical
extractors. Low levels concentrate chemicals and salt while creating
ideal conditions for brine shrimp.</TE>
<TE>   But if the lake keeps dropping, industries might have to deepen
canals and brine shrimpers may have trouble launching.</TE>
<TE>   Still another effect may be increased odor. "Lake stink," the odor
of decaying material around the lake's edge, is blown to eastern
communities when the winds carry it.</TE>

<HD>Zero Tolerance Lets a Student's Future Hang on a Knife's
Edge</HD>
<DH>A utensil fell into Taylor Hess' pickup, dropping him into
a storm over school policy.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BARRY SIEGEL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>HURST, Texas</DL>
<LD>No big deal. That's what 16-year-old Taylor Hess thought, watching
the assistant principal walk into his fourth-period class.</LD>
<LD>   For Taylor, life was good, couldn't be better. He was an honors
student. He was a star on the varsity swim team. That morning, he'd
risen at 5:30 for practice. It was agonizing, diving into the school
pool before sunrise, but Taylor liked getting something done early.
He also liked the individuality of his sport, how in swimming you can
only blame yourself.</LD>
<LD>   The assistant principal, he now realized, was looking at him. In
fact, Nathaniel Hearne was pointing at him. "Get your car keys,"
Hearne said. "Come with me."</LD>
<TE>   Taylor still thought, no big deal. Maybe he'd left his headlights
on. Maybe he'd parked where he shouldn't.</TE>
<TE>   "A knife has been spotted in your pickup," Hearne said.</TE>
<TE>   He'd gone camping with friends on Saturday, Taylor told him. Maybe
someone left a machete in the truck.</TE>
<TE>   "OK," Hearne said. "We'll find out."</TE>
<TE>   In the parking lot, beside the 1993 cranberry red Ford Ranger he'd
worked all summer to buy, Taylor saw Alan Goss, the Hurst city
policeman assigned full time to L.D. Bell High. He also saw two
private security officers holding a pair of dogs trained to find
drugs and weapons.</TE>
<TE>   Taylor looked at the bed of his pickup. It wasn't a machete after
all, but an unserrated bread knife with a round point. A long bread
knife, a good 10 inches long, lying right out in the open.</TE>
<TE>   Now it clicked. That's my grandma's kitchen knife, Taylor
explained. She had a stroke, we had to move her to assisted living,
put her stuff in our garage. Last night we took it all to Goodwill.
This must have fallen out of a box. I'll lock it up in the cab. Or
you can keep it. Or you can call my parents to come get it.</TE>
<TE>   The others just kept staring at the knife. Taylor thought they
looked confused, like they didn't know what to do.</TE>
<TE>   "Is it sharp?" Hearne finally asked.</TE>
<TE>   Officer Goss ran his finger along the blade. "It's fairly sharp in
a couple of spots."</TE>
<TE>   Hearne slipped the knife inside his sport coat. Taylor walked with
him back to class, wondering what his punishment might be. Saturday
detention hall, maybe. He'd never pulled D hall before, never been in
any trouble.</TE>
<TE>   "Get your stuff and come to my office," Hearne said. "I've got to
warn you, Taylor, this is a pretty serious thing."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Beginnings at Columbine</TE>
<TE>   The Hurst-Euless-Bedford Independent School District, about 12
miles west of Dallas, resembles so many others that have fashioned
zero-tolerance polices to combat mounting fears of campus violence.
For most districts, it began in 1994 with the federal Gun-Free
Schools Act, which required all schools receiving federal aid to
expel students who bring firearms to campus. Many states and school
boards, appalled by the shootings that culminated in the 1999
Columbine High School massacre in Colorado, adopted policies even
wider and tougher than the federal law. Everything from paper guns to
nail files became weapons, everything from second-grade kisses to
Tylenol tablets cause for expulsion. In countless rule books, "shall"
and "must" replaced administrative discretion.</TE>
<TE>   There'd been crazy situations ever since: Eighth-graders arrested
for bringing "purple cocaine"--grape Kool-Aid--in lunch boxes; a
sixth-grader suspended for bringing a toy ax as part of his Halloween
fireman costume; a boy expelled for having a "hit list" that turned
out to be his birthday party guests. Pundits clucked and civil rights
lawyers protested, but for the most part, parents liked the changes,
in fact campaigned for them. They wanted more rules, stricter rules.
They also wanted consistency. They wanted students treated equally.</TE>
<TE>   Jim Short, the principal of L.D. Bell High, understood all this as
he sat at his desk on Monday afternoon, Feb. 25. Just minutes before,
they'd found Taylor Hess' knife. Short's heart told him to ignore the
matter. He knew Taylor well, thought him a great kid, a terrific
young man. He believed the boy's story, he understood what had
happened. He didn't believe Taylor had done anything wrong. Yet as
principal, Short didn't think he could turn a blind eye.</TE>
<TE>   Before him he had the Texas Education Code's Chapter 37 and his
own school district's student code of conduct. They both told him the
same thing: He had no latitude. There it was in the state code: A
student shall be expelled ... if the student on school property ...
possesses an illegal knife. There it was in the district code:
Student will be expelled for a full calendar year....</TE>
<TE>   Nothing got people's attention more quickly than weapons on
campus. Short appreciated this. He was 50 years old. For 26 years,
he'd worked in the Abilene, Texas, schools, the last 15 as a
principal, before coming to L.D. Bell this year. He knew schools
could be dangerous places. An Abilene teacher had been shot on
campus. Kids were good generally, but some just didn't care. If Short
ignored an infraction, it could blow up in his face. If he ignored
Taylor Hess' knife, people would hear about it. Then he'd be assailed
for paying no heed to a big carving knife. He had to follow the
rules.</TE>
<TE>   Still--Short had a sick feeling. He kept asking himself, what did
he expect Taylor to have done differently?</TE>
<TE>   At 2 p.m. that day, Short met with five assistant principals and
the Hurst police officer, Alan Goss. They traded opinions without
reaching a consensus. Most, even while hoping Taylor might win a
later appeal, thought the state and district codes mandated
expulsion.</TE>
<TE>   We don't make the laws, the way Officer Goss saw it. Their hands
were tied. If he were working as a street cop, if he had pulled
Taylor over and seen an illegal knife in his pickup, Goss had
discretion on whether even to write a report. He'd probably let him
go with a warning. But he couldn't do that on school grounds. Not
under the district's zero-tolerance policy.</TE>
<TE>   Short found himself sounding the most liberal. Yet he saw his
colleagues' viewpoints. It seemed to him they were honorable people
with different opinions. Honorable people who all left the meeting
with long faces.</TE>
<TE>   More voices soon chimed in. The Texas Education Agency advised
that the district had to proceed against Taylor. A county prosecuting
attorney said yes, this was a case he'd accept, this was a violation
of the penal code.</TE>
<TE>   That made a difference. Officer Goss had been expecting the
prosecuting attorney to say no, don't bring it to me. Expecting--and
hoping.</TE>
<TE>   At 2:40 p.m., Taylor Hess, summoned from his 11th-grade
advanced-placement chemistry class, stepped into the principal's
office. This will all blow over, he'd been telling himself. If no one
else knows, they can let it pass. He didn't feel guilty or anxious,
the way you did when you knew you'd messed up. Besides, he had a
history with this principal. Jim Short had been supportive of the
swim team. He'd sat around with them, talking to Taylor,
congratulating him for being regional backstroke champ. Short knew
him, knew what kind of kid he was.</TE>
<TE>   A non-event. That's what all this was, Taylor figured. A
non-event.</TE>
<TE>   He explained again, telling Short about his grandma's stroke,
packing up her stuff, driving to Goodwill. Short appeared to believe
him but still looked mighty serious. When Taylor stopped talking,
Short said, "Taylor, are you aware this calls for mandatory
expulsion?"</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Parents' Disbelief</TE>
<TE>   Robert and Gay Hess, Taylor's parents, have an unspoken rule. She
doesn't call him at work unless it's urgent. She's a physical
therapist's assistant at North Hills Hospital; he's a customer
service manager for American Eagle airline at the Dallas-Fort Worth
airport. At 3 p.m. that Monday, his pager beeped while he sat in a
staff meeting. He bolted from the room to call his wife.</TE>
<TE>   "You're not going to believe this," she began, sounding
distraught. Taylor's principal had just phoned her. She'd realized
right off what this was about. She'd explained everything to Jim
Short. He'd appreciated her account, Gay thought. After all, she'd
corroborated Taylor's story without knowing what Taylor had told
them. Yet Gay didn't think she'd swayed the principal. This is very
serious, he'd kept telling her. This is very serious.</TE>
<TE>   Robert Hess tried to calm his wife. He was good at solving
problems and easing tension. That's what he did all day with
aggravated airline travelers. He could fix this. It was a bread
knife, after all. Taylor obviously never even saw it. They were all
grown-ups, weren't they?</TE>
<TE>   "The school district has competent leaders," Robert told Gay.
"Surely they will be fair and logical."</TE>
<TE>   Late that day, he called Jim Short's office and arranged to meet
with him the next afternoon. During dinner, the Hess family--Taylor
has one older brother, Jordan, 17, then an L.D. Bell senior--talked
things over. Gay thought it ironic that their family had always
wanted to make schools safer; she'd never expected it would backfire
on them. Taylor thought, this just shows that no good deed goes
unpunished.</TE>
<TE>   Robert Hess' mind drifted to Sunday, to their hours in the garage
packing up his mother Rose's stuff. Going through everything had
sparked such memories. The glassware, for instance. He was 46 now,
yet there were glasses he remembered drinking from as a child,
glasses his mom had used to serve Kool-Aid at Cub Scout meetings. She
must have kept them, he imagined, because they took her back to a
time when she was a young, beautiful woman with small children. Now
80, she sat in assisted living, unaware of Taylor's plight, for
they'd chosen not to upset her.</TE>
<TE>   It was funny. Robert and Gay had debated about the cutlery set.
Gay had decided not to keep it, so it went into a box. Dusk fell
before they finished. In the dark, Robert and Taylor drove a mile to
the Goodwill center, bouncing along on the Ranger's old springs. The
night drop-off area was poorly lighted, so they could barely see as
they unloaded. They worked fast, eager to get home.</TE>
<TE>   Don't worry, Robert Hess told his family now. Maybe Taylor will
have to write an essay. Something like that. Something that fits the
event.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   A Word Study</TE>
<TE>   Again and again, Principal Jim Short flipped through the penal
code, the state code, the school code. He asked himself, how do you
define "possession"? He studied the words: "knowingly" ...
"willingly" ... "recklessly." The first two didn't apply, but
"recklessly"--there were those in the district, both below and above
him, who thought Taylor's conduct reckless.</TE>
<TE>   Another word drew Short's attention: "shall." Shall be expelled,
not "may" be expelled.</TE>
<TE>   The school principal drove home that Monday night feeling
distraught. He had a teenage son himself, one who enjoyed dove
hunting. His boy could leave a knife or gun in his car. Surely, this
could be his own child in trouble. Short tried to find a way to feel
OK in his heart about what he had to do. He couldn't. Part of him
wondered why Taylor hadn't just denied any knowledge of the knife, of
ever seeing it before. Part of him wished Taylor had done just that.</TE>
<TE>   In years past, being an educator had been simpler. Short had grown
up in a small southeast New Mexico town. He dad sold farm equipment,
his mom taught piano. He married early, while still an aimless
college sophomore. What drew him to working in schools were his own
teachers, tremendous teachers. Now he'd be proud if his own children
went into teaching. His daughter was an opera singer, earning a
master's; his son played baseball in junior college. Short remained
optimistic about kids. He loved showing off L.D. Bell High. The choir
particularly made him beam. This is why I love what I do, he'd
declare, his arms waving as the students sang.</TE>
<TE>   Ten years ago, he would have handled the Taylor Hess situation by
himself. No longer. Now Short had to talk to his district
supervisors, who talked to the district superintendent, Gene Buinger.
People in Buinger's office had to talk to the Texas Education Agency
and local police authorities. The rules and codes kept evolving.
Although the federal Gun-Free Schools Act had allowed them "case by
case" flexibility, the state refined and the districts refined even
further. It was Texas that required expulsion of a student with an
"illegal knife," but it was Short's own district that insisted the
expulsion be for a full year.</TE>
<TE>   Some school administrators found it insulting or preposterous to
lose personal discretion. Zero-tolerance panels at school board
conferences often drew overflow crowds. There was always talk of the
foolish cases. In recent years in Short's district, there'd been half
a dozen as perplexing as Taylor Hess', half a dozen where district
Supt. Buinger believed the punishment had been excessive. "Feel-good
legislation" is what Buinger called the state laws; legislation that
is "supposed to solve, but deep down, everyone knows it just
addresses issues superficially."</TE>
<TE>   Still, Buinger had to admit--zero-tolerance rules made life
easier. They eased the burden. By applying consistency instead of
subjective judgment, you had support for your actions rather than
claims of discrimination. If Jim Short disregarded the Taylor Hess
case and six months later a different principal responded another way
with, say, a Latino student, you would surely hear cries about
prejudice.</TE>
<TE>   That, above all, was why Short's supervisors wanted firm formulas.
Their school district was in transition, undergoing "a change in
demographics." It was one-third minority now, mostly Latino. There
was a distinct and growing gap between poorer and more affluent
students. For people to have faith in the school system, they had to
believe everyone was being treated equally.</TE>
<TE>   Deep down, despite his unease, Jim Short agreed. He had to admit:
He derived a certain comfort in not having discretion. He could lean
on that. He could then say he followed the formula.</TE>
<TE>   As arranged, Robert Hess appeared in his office at 2:15 p.m. on
Tuesday. Assistant Principal Nathaniel Hearne joined them. So did the
Hurst police officer, Alan Goss. Hess sat down, ready to settle this
as he did most problems. Right off, though, Short handed him a letter
and asked him to sign a receipt for it.</TE>
<TE>   For the first time, Hess began to feel a little nervous. "Wait a
minute," he said. "Let me read it."</TE>
<TE>   This letter is to notify you that your son, Ryan Taylor Hess, is
being considered for expulsion from L.D. Bell High School.... We have
scheduled a Due Process Hearing for Friday, March 1 at 9:00 a.m....</TE>
<TE>   Hess' nervousness grew. This looked more significant than he'd
expected. He asked, "Would I be overreacting if I brought an
attorney?"</TE>
<TE>   "I can't say," Short told him. "But if you do, you need to notify
us so we have ours too."</TE>
<TE>   The principal felt he owed it to Hess to be truthful. Short
himself would preside at the due process hearing, he explained. He'd
be following the code of conduct. It would be unlikely that he'd be
able to recommend anything but expulsion.</TE>
<TE>   Hess, normally easy with conversation, sat speechless. OK, he
thought, OK. This has gone a step or two further than he'd expected.
But surely they'd resolve this at the hearing. They just needed to
prepare; they just needed to get ready.</TE>
<TE>   They needed to do one other thing, Robert Hess decided. They
needed to call a lawyer.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Quizzing the Educators</TE>
<TE>   A door at the rear of the principal's office leads into a private
conference room. There everyone gathered at 9 a.m. Friday, settling
around a rectangular table. On the table, a tape recorder turned
silently. Facing the Hess family now, along with Short, Hearne and
Goss, was Dianne Byrnes, who directs the district's "alternative
education programs" for problem kids.</TE>
<TE>   This wouldn't be adversarial, Short had advised. Yet it seemed
that way to the Hesses. Taylor felt numb, in shock, ready for
anything. He talked little, trying instead to grasp what was going
on. Same with his mother, who couldn't believe this was even
happening. Mainly, Robert Hess spoke for the family.</TE>
<TE>   He'd been preparing for two days, studying the codes, scouring the
Internet, consulting an attorney, drafting specific questions for
each person present. Whoever loses his temper, he reminded himself,
is at a disadvantage. So he spoke politely, without a hint of
antagonism, something that Short noted and appreciated. Yet as they
walked through the facts of the case, Hess poured on the questions,
unrelenting.</TE>
<TE>   You don't have the knife or a photo of the knife at this hearing?
You don't have a copy of the police report? You're sitting here today
without any of the evidence? Do you really think these proceedings
are fair? Do you really feel you're following the spirit of the law?
Do any of you in the least doubt the truth of Taylor's explanation?
What are your feelings about the school district's zero-tolerance
policies? How do you feel about what you're doing to Taylor?</TE>
<TE>   Dianne Byrnes, who wrote the district's code of conduct and spends
most of her time on matters of discipline, took the hardest line. Her
stance made the Hess family feel uncomfortable. "Taylor did have a
knife visible in his truck ... ," she said. "Taylor did put students
at risk.... The spirit of the law is to ensure the safety of
students.... I think there was a risk factor."</TE>
<TE>   Jim Short sounded much more ambivalent. Where Byrnes resisted
questions about personal feelings, he responded. He thought
zero-tolerance policies "a two-edged sword." They made it possible
for him to "look myself in the mirror and know that I treated the
students as equally as I possibly could." On the other hand, the
policies "make you feel like you lose some judgment." So it was for
him "a love-hate thing."</TE>
<TE>   Short turned to Hess. "I don't know if that answers your
question."</TE>
<TE>   Hess said, "Yes, you answered it eloquently. I can appreciate how
frustrating it must be to have your hands tied."</TE>
<TE>   Short sighed. "I'd be lying if I said any aspect of this is
pleasant. This is a sorrowful experience."</TE>
<TE>   As they talked, Hess kept looking for signs. No one else had files
or questions or evidence. They've already made their decision, he
concluded. Reading their body language, he believed he saw people
eager to go. To him, Dianne Byrnes seemed particularly antsy,
glancing often at her watch. She had another appointment, she
declared finally. They would have to postpone this hearing.</TE>
<TE>   "No," Robert Hess said. "We're not through."</TE>
<TE>   Short eventually sided with Hess. At 11 a.m., two hours into the
hearing, Dianne Byrnes left. Hess seized the opportunity. Again he
asked Short how he felt.</TE>
<TE>   "Miserable," the principal said, with a rueful laugh. "How's
that?" He paused. "There's not a good feeling in my body about this."</TE>
<TE>   Half an hour later, they all rose. Short usually ruled right away
in these situations, but not today. "I want to think about this over
the weekend," he told the Hess family.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Doing the 'Right Thing'</TE>
<TE>   Late on Monday afternoon, Robert Hess called the L.D. Bell office.
"I need another day," Jim Short told him. "I want to make sure we do
the right thing for Taylor and for the student population of Bell
High."</TE>
<TE>   Hess' heart sank. Right thing for the student population. Oh my
God, he thought. They're going to expel Taylor.</TE>
<TE>   That night he warned his family. Taylor reeled. He'd been in
turmoil for a week. Like his principal, he'd been wondering why he
hadn't just denied any knowledge of the knife. It hadn't occurred to
him, though. There'd been no reason to lie. Besides, he'd always been
taught to tell the truth.</TE>
<TE>   Taylor had career plans. He wanted to get a private pilot's
license; he wanted to study aeronautical engineering. Now what would
happen? Taylor couldn't help but think this whole thing made the
school administrators look cowardly. Nobody was asking, what should
we do? Instead, everyone was asking, what do we have to do?</TE>
<TE>   The call from Short finally came at 3:15 p.m. Tuesday. "I've
decided to expel Taylor," the principal told Robert Hess. "You can
appeal. I encourage you to appeal. If you do, I'll be one of Taylor's
biggest advocates." Short also asked, "Do you want me to tell Taylor,
or should you?"</TE>
<TE>   "We'll both tell him," Hess said. "I'm on my way there."</TE>
<TE>   Driving to the school, he called his wife of 28 years. She'd been
more optimistic than him. "Baby," he said. "They're expelling
Taylor."</TE>
<TE>   First came a long silence. Then Gay began crying.</TE>
<TE>   He wanted to soothe her, but felt powerless. He also wanted to cry
with her, but knew if he gave up, there'd be nobody left to defend
their son.</TE>
<TE>   "Why are they doing this to our baby?" Gay asked.</TE>
<TE>   In Short's office, Hess and the principal swapped letters.</TE>
<TE>   Legalese filled Short's: "This is to inform you of my decision to
recommend expulsion of Ryan Taylor Hess from L.D. Bell High School."</TE>
<TE>   Hess' cited a federal appellate court ruling in another
zero-tolerance case: A school administrator that executed such an
action could be held personally liable and would not have the luxury
of his qualified immunity.</TE>
<TE>   Hess vainly implored Short to reconsider. Hess said, "Mr. Short,
the only thing that can happen from this point on is, this could get
bigger and uglier."</TE>
<TE>   Short replied, "I'll try not to take that as a threat." Yet to
himself, he thought: This man is just being an advocate for his
child. I would do exactly the same.</TE>
<TE>   They called Taylor in. He'd been waiting in the anteroom, summoned
once again from his advanced-placement chemistry class. Short
explained his decision. Taylor felt gut-punched, stung with pain. All
my hard work shot to hell, he thought. Honors classes, the swim team,
all a waste of time. He held his tongue, though. Jim Short thought
him amazingly courteous.</TE>
<TE>   The principal let Taylor stay at L.D. Bell for two more days,
Wednesday and Thursday. Taylor told all his friends now, after
keeping things mostly to himself. A couple of teachers had him get
up, explain to the class. He asked his English teacher to spread the
word wider, to tell other students. Taylor preferred that everyone
hear the true story rather than think he'd gone and stabbed someone.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Alternative School</TE>
<TE>   That Friday, Robert Hess drove Taylor to Crossroads, the
district's "short-term alternative" educational program "designed for
students who lack the motivation to conduct themselves in accordance
with the district's student code of conduct." It felt to the father
as if he were delivering his son to prison.</TE>
<TE>   Officers at the front door searched Taylor's bags, patted him
down, scrutinized him for all manner of infractions. Rules about
clothing, grooming, jewelry, hairstyles and accessories filled a long
page. So did academic regulations. Pending his appeal, Taylor was to
sit in the same classroom all day, working on assignments sent over
by his teachers at L.D. Bell.</TE>
<TE>   Off he went, down an eerily silent hallway absent of spirited
chatter. The minutes crawled by. Taylor found the day unbearably
boring, a waste of time. Most of his classmates were remedial
students, working on how to calculate the area of a triangle. He was
dealing with electron-negativity differentials, Lewis-dot structures,
how to figure the polarity of compounds. When he asked the teacher
for advice, she allowed that she didn't know much chemistry. She
called other teachers. No one could help. Yet the school's rule was,
you can't leave the campus until you complete your day's assignments.
So Taylor wrote down random curves and figures just to finish,
knowing it meant he'd draw a zero.</TE>
<TE>   Four school days passed, interrupted by a weeklong spring break.
The Hesses finally told Grandma Rose about Taylor's expulsion. She
offered to go talk to the principal, to tell him he'd made a terrible
mistake. She cried when they told her this was one thing she couldn't
fix.</TE>
<TE>   Taylor yearned for his classes at L.D. Bell. In his honors
English, they'd been reading Chaucer's "Canterbury Tales," harder
even than Shakespeare, but he didn't mind because his English teacher
was so brilliant. Taylor started trying to come up with things to do.
One day, he felt so delirious, he wrote his girlfriend a three-page
note in the form of a haiku, complete with illustrations.</TE>
<TE>   At least it took a long time. At least it occupied his mind.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Debate Goes Public</TE>
<TE>   On the Thursday afternoon of spring break, district Supt. Gene
Buinger arrived home to find a note on his front door. It was from
Monica Mendoza, a reporter for the Fort Worth Star-Telegram. Robert
Hess had contacted her, she advised, and had provided her a tape
recording of Taylor's due process hearing. She'd be writing a story
for the Sunday paper. Did Buinger want to respond?</TE>
<TE>   Buinger had heard about the Taylor Hess case. There were 20,000
students in his district, though, 30 schools in all, so he didn't
have a complete grasp of the matter. His first response to the
reporter's note was surprise--surprise that the Hess family had gone
to a newspaper. In his 20 years as a superintendent, that had never
happened. Most parents didn't want the notoriety. The Hesses were
waiving lots of confidentiality rights.</TE>
<TE>   That didn't mean Buinger believed he could waive confidentiality.
He declined to comment to the reporter, explaining that federal law
prevented him from responding. Then he braced himself for the
article.</TE>
<TE>   Jim Short's phone rang at 4:30 that Sunday morning. You going to
call off school? an anonymous voice inquired. Short didn't know what
the man was talking about. He was still in bed and hadn't seen the
newspaper. The caller explained: They're going to have lots of sharp
pencils out.</TE>
<TE>   By 10 that morning, the onslaught had begun, mostly directed at
Short. Phone calls, e-mails, radio talk shows, TV cameras, CNN,
NBC--from all quarters, pundits and outraged citizens were lambasting
him. He'd never imagined being the subject of radio talk shows; he'd
never grasped the full might of the Internet.</TE>
<TE>   Zero tolerance is a cop-out. Here my tax dollars are paying a
principal to not use his judgment ... Ludicrous ... I am so disgusted
... Not only insane, but cruel and unnecessary ... Any administrator
who supports this should resign immediately....</TE>
<TE>   Other messages scared Short even more. The loudest voices came not
from civil libertarians but from the antigovernment,
right-to-bear-arms crowd. Free men are armed, slaves are disarmed.
The Constitution guarantees the right of the people to bear arms ...
You're just a bunch of left-wing nazi indoctrinators ... Take away
the arms and you break a nation.</TE>
<TE>   Most damaging of all were the Hess family's comments. They were
doing back-to-back interviews now, filling TV screens by the hour. It
had been their attorney's idea to contact the news media. They
agreed, seeing no other alternative, but called only the one Fort
Worth reporter. They'd not expected the enormous response. They'd not
realized that people would sense this could happen to their own kids,
to anyone. The feedback felt good to the Hess family, but also scary.
"We're just regular working folks," Robert Hess kept saying. "We're
not used to TV trucks and reporters outside our door. This feels so
alien."</TE>
<TE>   All the same, they handled it with aplomb. Hess observed that "an
act of being a good Samaritan now has this fine young man expelled
from school.... Having zero tolerance doesn't mean having zero
judgment or zero rights." Taylor, amid bashful shrugs, said, "Somehow
a knife had to fall out. A fork couldn't fall out, a spoon couldn't
fall out.... It's criminal trespass if I go on campus, which means I
can't see my brother graduate."</TE>
<TE>   Gene Buinger and Jim Short realized there was no way to look good.
Truth was, they didn't feel good. Buinger thought of his old Marine
adage: There's a time when you have to stand at attention and take
it.</TE>
<TE>   By Tuesday, though, he'd decided to respond. The school district
called a news conference for 2 p.m., timed to make the evening news.
Buinger still wouldn't discuss the details of the Hess case, but he
wanted to explain the state laws and district codes that mandated
their zero-tolerance policy. With printed handouts and a big-screen
PowerPoint presentation, he emphasized the "musts" and "shalls."</TE>
<TE>   "We're very limited in what we can do," he said. "I understand the
public's frustration. I'm frustrated too.... Individuals opposed to
such policies should take their concerns to their respective state
legislators."</TE>
<TE>   Watching from the back of the hall, Robert Hess thought Buinger
handled himself well. The superintendent had said something about
possibly being able to shorten the expulsion because the offense
involved a knife, not a gun. Hess sensed that Buinger was trying to
find a way out.</TE>
<TE>   The outcry wouldn't stop, though. Hess couldn't believe the
momentum. The national newspapers were calling him now, alerted by a
story distributed by Associated Press. The school district was
getting crucified. The Hurst Police Department had backed away,
deciding not to file a complaint with the county prosecutor. So had
the Texas Education Agency, telling AP that local districts did have
discretion, that "every case has to be looked at individually."</TE>
<TE>   Enough, the Hess family resolved. For Taylor, the first couple of
times on TV had been neat, but the back-to-back interviews lost their
sparkle real quick. For his father, it began to feel like piling on.
When would it just become cruel? It wasn't his intent to ruin the
school system, to hurt these people's careers. He just wanted Taylor
back in school.</TE>
<TE>   He would turn down further interviews, Hess decided. He'd take all
the reporters' phone numbers, stick them in his hip pocket. If his
family lost their appeal, scheduled for Thursday at 11 a.m., he could
always pull them out again.</TE>
<TE>   By Wednesday night, that didn't seem likely. Early in the evening,
the phone rang at the Hess home. It was an assistant superintendent
in Gene Buinger's office. Would the Hesses be agreeable to a 9 a.m.
meeting, he wondered, before the scheduled appeal? The district had
some ideas. The district thought matters maybe could be resolved.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Finding a Way to Bend</TE>
<TE>   In the end, it all came down to what had been lacking, to what
everyone said the law didn't allow: personal judgment.</TE>
<TE>   The federal Gun-Free Schools Act had always included a clause
specifying that state laws "shall" allow school superintendents to
modify expulsion requirements. The Texas Education Agency, in a
letter to district administrators, had made clear that the term of
expulsions "may be reduced from the statutory one year." Yet it was
the Hurst-Euless-Bedford district's own code that governed in the
Hess case--and like many others across the country, the HEB district
had handcuffed itself by mandating inflexible one-year expulsions.</TE>
<TE>   Now, one day before the Hesses' appeal, Gene Buinger decided to
remove the self-imposed handcuffs. He'd simply waive district policy;
he'd rescind the expulsion. Following a conversation with the Texas
Education Agency's school safety division, he thought he could do
that, especially since the police had never filed a complaint. And if
he could do that, why even hold an appeal hearing?</TE>
<TE>   When the Hesses arrived at his office on Friday morning, Buinger
began to explain his plan. Just then, however, an assistant came in
carrying a newly arrived fax from the state agency's legal
department. No, the fax advised, Buinger couldn't rescind the
expulsion. He could only reduce the expulsion to time served.</TE>
<TE>   Buinger wasn't sure whether the Hesses would buy this. He shared
with them the conflicting advice he'd received. This does call for
expulsion, he said, but we can adjust the amount of time. Is that OK
with you?</TE>
<TE>   Robert Hess had a typed list of conditions. "Yes," he said. "If we
can agree on these."</TE>
<TE>   The Hesses wanted Taylor readmitted immediately to L.D. Bell, his
record expunged of any reference to the expulsion, tutorials to help
him catch up on missed classes and a public announcement of the
resolution. Buinger's staff readily agreed, but since it was already
Thursday, they thought Taylor should come back to Bell on Monday.</TE>
<TE>   No, Robert Hess said. Tomorrow.</TE>
<TE>   Applause greeted the announcement, at an 11 a.m. joint news
conference, that Taylor Hess would be returning to L.D. Bell the next
morning. Taylor said it hadn't been "a pleasant experience, but I
hold no personal grudges." Robert Hess said, "What I was hoping for
is exactly what I got." Gene Buinger said, "Zero-tolerance policies
have become excessive.... The school board is now undertaking a
complete review of district policy. We want to give as much
discretion as possible to local administrators so we don't have to
repeat this situation."</TE>
<TE>   In time, the district would revise its policy, among other things
ending the mandatory one-year term for expulsions. All that remained
unresolved were the fundamental reasons for zero-tolerance policies
in the first place. Gene Buinger knew as much; he knew that if
another student had lifted the knife from Taylor's pickup and used it
in an altercation, they would have endured an even more impassioned
response. He knew also what he would hear in the next knife-on-campus
case: I want the same as Taylor Hess. If I don't get the same, it's
discrimination.</TE>
<TE>   There were no simple answers. Still, returning to L.D. Bell after
the final news conference, Jim Short saw one thing clearly. This day
happened to be the occasion for another random security sweep of the
campus, complete with drug-sniffing dogs. There they were, out on the
parking lot, just as they were the morning they spotted Taylor's
knife. This crew had never found drugs, hardly ever weapons.
Littering and tardiness had been the biggest problems at Bell all
year.</TE>
<TE>   "No thank you," Short told the dog handlers. "You're not going to
do this today. Stay out of the parking lot. Stay out of our classes."</TE>

<HD>Angels Might See Some of These Guys in September</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BEN BOLCH</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Unlike some clubs that will pick from what amounts to a minor league
scrap heap, the Angels have an abundance of quality triple-A players
from which to choose as they prepare to expand their roster to 40
players on Sept. 1.</LD>
<LD>   Leading the way appears to be Salt Lake slugger Robb Quinlan, who
is pounding Pacific Coast League pitching. The outfielder-first
baseman was tied for the PCL lead with a .341 average and tied for
the triple-A lead with 94 runs batted after the first game of a
four-game weekend series with Tucson.</LD>
<LD>   "Rob's swung the bat well throughout his career with the Angels,"
said Tony Reagins, the Angels' director of player development. "He
could improve a little bit defensively, but you want to find a spot
for his bat in the lineup."</LD>
<TE>   Quinlan leads the Stingers with 16 home runs and was named PCL
player of the week in late July after hitting .455 with two home
runs, 16 RBIs and an impressive .939 slugging percentage. The
25-year-old hit for the cycle July 28, going five for six with two
doubles, a triple, a home run and seven RBIs.</TE>
<TE>   Also impressive to Reagins has been Salt Lake reliever Francisco
Rodriguez. He has compiled an earned-run average below 2.00 in 42
appearances this season with Arkansas and now Salt Lake.</TE>
<TE>   Three other options at Salt Lake are second baseman Chone Figgins,
pitcher Mickey Callaway and outfielder Nathan Haynes.</TE>
<TE>   Figgins set a single-season franchise record Thursday night with
his 36th stolen base and leads the league with 16 triples, also a
franchise record. Some consider the switch-hitting 24-year-old a bit
undersized at 5 feet 9, but as Reagins pointed out, "We have a guy
playing shortstop in Anaheim that's not too big either." That would
be 5-8 David Eckstein.</TE>
<TE>   Callaway, a right-hander who is 9-1 with a 1.65 ERA, won his first
eight decisions, even while suffering from a sprained back he injured
in spring training.</TE>
<TE>   Callaway, who has been on the disabled list twice this season,
said his back felt better now and cited his fastball, recently
clocked at a season-high 93 mph, as evidence.</TE>
<TE>   Haynes, who has played in only 50 games this season because of a
thumb injury, had a 19-game hitting streak through Friday.</TE>
<TE>   "His health has been his issue," Reagins said. "If he's healthy
and can put together a solid remainder of the season, he could help
Anaheim down the line."</TE>
<TE>   In other Angel system news:</TE>
<TE>   * Rancho Cucamonga right-hander Pedro Liriano pitched the first
one-hitter in Quake history July 30, striking out 10 in a 9-0 victory
over Visalia. Liriano posted a 1.70 ERA in winning five consecutive
starts before Friday night, when he was denied his sixth in a row as
the Quakes lost, 4-0, to Lancaster. The 21-year-old was 9-11 with a
3.70 ERA, 151 strikeouts and 61 walks in 143 1/3 innings. "He's
figured out how to get players out," Reagins said.</TE>
<TE>   * The Class-A Cedar Rapids Kernels recorded their 6,000th win
Tuesday after rallying from a five-run deficit to defeat West
Michigan, 7-6. Catcher Jeff Mathis got his 38th double, a
single-season record for a franchise whose history dates to 1890....
Joe Saunders won his debut for Cedar Rapids on Thursday, allowing one
run and two hits, walking one and striking out five in six innings.
Saunders, the Angels' first pick and the 12th overall selection in
the June amateur draft, was promoted Monday from rookie-level Provo,
where he was 2-1 with a 3.62 ERA.... Arkansas right-hander Mario
Mendoza allowed four runs in 2 1/3 innings Aug. 2 during a 6-3 loss
to Shreveport, which is managed by Mendoza's father, Mario Sr....
Second baseman Alberto Callaspo went five for six and drove in four
runs for Provo on Monday, hitting his Pioneer League-leading ninth
triple.</TE>
<TE>   Dodger System</TE>
<TE>   The Las Vegas 51s, with the best record in the Pacific Coast
League, could get a taste of what postseason play holds this weekend
when they play a four-game series against Edmonton, their likely
first-round opponent.</TE>
<TE>   The series is in Edmonton, but that shouldn't bother the 51s
(71-49), who have won 13 of their last 18 road games and hold the
league's best road record at 39-21.</TE>
<TE>   Outfielder Luke Allen has been hot during the 51s' last nine
games, hitting .429. Infielder Chris Clapinski, who has hit .423 over
the last eight games with a home run and six RBIs, has 11 homers this
season, one short of his personal record.</TE>
<TE>   * First baseman James Loney, the Dodgers' top pick in this year's
draft and the 19th selection overall, has been promoted to Class-A
Vero Beach after hitting .371 with 22 doubles and five home runs with
the Great Falls Dodgers of the rookie-level Pioneer League....
Jacksonville right-hander Scott Proctor struck out 11 batters, the
most in his career, over seven innings July 30 in a 6-0 victory over
Mobile. It was a sparkling moment in an otherwise dull season for
Proctor, who is 5-8 with a 3.67 ERA.</TE>
<TE>   California League</TE>
<TE>   Lancaster, which finished last in the Southern Division's
first-half standings, has undergone a worst-to-first transformation
in the second half, thanks in part to some hitting streaks. Third
baseman Brian Barden recently put together a 12-game hitting streak,
and outfielder Dwight Edge had an 11-game streak.</TE>
<TE>   Third baseman Corey Myers' 17-game hitting streak was still alive
heading into the JetHawks' Saturday game against Rancho Cucamonga.
Myers had hit .410 during his streak, the longest this season for
Lancaster (26-22).</TE>
<TE>   The news hasn't been all good for Lancaster, though. JetHawk
pitchers issued a franchise-record 15 walks July 28 in a 10-5 loss to
Lake Elsinore. Six of the batters who walked scored, including five
of the first eight. Starter Phil Stockman issued seven walks over
four innings in picking up the loss.</TE>
<TE>   * Jeff Clark, a right-handed pitcher for San Jose who ran his
shutout-inning streak to 29 while winning his final eight games for
the Giants, found double-A hitters a bit tougher to master after his
recent promotion to Shreveport of the Texas League.</TE>
<TE>   Clark allowed five earned runs in five innings during his
Shreveport debut, surrendering 11 hits and one walk while striking
out four in a no-decision.</TE>
<TE>   Those numbers were in stark contrast to those he produced during
his eight-game winning streak, when he struck out 57 and walked only
five in 58 1/3 innings while recording an 0.93 ERA.</TE>
<TE>   * San Bernardino third baseman Justin Leone collected six hits,
two of them home runs, to go with two walks July 31 against
Lancaster. But Leone was left on base four times for the Stampede,
which stranded 21 runners and lost, 15-14, despite outhitting the
JetHawks, 22-16.</TE>
<TE>   Around the Nation</TE>
<TE>   Goleta Dos Pueblos High graduate Scott Randall recorded his 14th
consecutive victory Thursday when he pitched a complete game for
triple-A Edmonton, an 8-2 win over Calgary.</TE>
<TE>   The right-hander, who started the streak with two victories for
double-A New Britain before being promoted, has tied Scranton pitcher
Joe Roa for the longest winning streak in the minors this season.</TE>
<TE>   With 12 straight victories for Edmonton, Randall needs four more
to tie the Pacific Coast League record for consecutive wins. That
distinction is held by Frank Browning, who in 1909 won 16 in a row
for the San Francisco Seals.</TE>
<TE>   * Eric Martins, a second baseman with the Long Beach Breakers, set
a Western Baseball League record when he hit in 31 consecutive games.</TE>
<TE>   Martins, who played at Cerritos College and Long Beach State, hit
.360 with six doubles and 18 RBIs during the streak, which ended July
21.</TE>
<TE>   For the season, the Yorba Linda resident is hitting .326 with 14
doubles, two home runs and 42 RBIs.</TE>
<TE>   Martins played in the Oakland A's organization for seven seasons
before joining the Breakers, an independent league team that plays at
Blair Field. The Breakers were tied with Solano for first place in
the WBL's Southern Division after the first game of a three-game
weekend series against Yuba-Sutter.</TE>

<HD>Angels Hit Back, Beat Blue Jays</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Refusing to let a three-game losing streak and
horrible loss the day before get them down, they rebound with 11-4
victory over Toronto.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL SHAIKIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>TORONTO</DL>
<LD>What slump? Did somebody say something about a slump?</LD>
<LD>   You wouldn't have suspected the Angels were in a slump from
walking through their clubhouse before Saturday's game, with some
players gathered around a computer, others talking college football
and MC Benji Gil blasting rap music on the sound system.</LD>
<LD>   And you certainly wouldn't have suspected the Angels were in a
slump from watching them play. The Angels responded to one of their
ugliest games of the season with one of their best, blitzing the
Toronto Blue Jays with seven runs in the third inning of an 11-4
victory.</LD>
<TE>   "If we have a game that's a mulligan, we have to be able to turn
the page," Manager Mike Scioscia said. "These guys do a good job of
that."</TE>
<TE>   The Angels had lost three consecutive games, and another loss
Saturday would have dropped them into third place in the American
League West and the AL wild-card standings. The Angels got a few
hours sleep Friday night, awoke, shrugged and pounded out 18 hits,
including three apiece from Garret Anderson, Darin Erstad and Jose
Molina, and home runs from Erstad, Anderson and Brad Fullmer.</TE>
<TE>   Rookie John Lackey won again, pitching six solid innings, still
oblivious to pennant pressure. Each starter had at least one hit, as
the Angels maintained their half-game lead over the Boston Red Sox
and Oakland Athletics in the wild-card race. In the AL West, the
Angels trail the Seattle Mariners by 3 1/2 games.</TE>
<TE>   This is not the first time the Angels have shrugged off a defeat
that appeared devastating to those watching from outside the
clubhouse.</TE>
<TE>   In April, with the Angels off to the worst start in franchise
history, they lost to Seattle in a game in which the only run scored
when a ball rolled between the legs of pitcher Ramon Ortiz, then
scored 10 runs the next day to beat the first-place Mariners.</TE>
<TE>   Last month, they blew a 7-1 lead at Minnesota, then beat the
first-place Twins the next day.</TE>
<TE>   That resiliency, essential for any contender, is born in the
manager's office, according to Erstad. Scioscia might pull a player
or two aside to discuss a mental error, but in front of the whole
team he seldom displays anything but a confident, upbeat attitude,
even after the roughest of losses.</TE>
<TE>   "He's the same every day, regardless of whether we're playing good
or we're playing bad," Erstad said. "There's no carryover. You can't
let what happened the day before affect how you play."</TE>
<TE>   This is easier said than done, to be sure.</TE>
<TE>   And, of course, the mental approach to winning is irrelevant if
the team isn't good enough to win.</TE>
<TE>   But the Angels are, and the core group of players learned its
lessons from faltering in the pennant races of 1999 and 2000, and
from losing 19 of its final 21 games last season. This season's
Angels lost 14 of their first 20 games and not only survived but
flourished.</TE>
<TE>   "We've been through the fire," Erstad said. "When things
snowballed, we let them get to us. We've had situations where we
haven't done well and we let it get to us. We know how to handle it
now."</TE>
<TE>   Scioscia deflected Erstad's credit back onto the players, saying,
"As hard as these guys play, and with the passion they have for the
game, a lot of this stuff is self-healing."</TE>
<TE>   Anderson seconded that point, suggesting there is nothing a
manager can say that substitutes for the experience of learning how
to shake off the last bad at-bat, that last crummy pitch, that last
awful game.</TE>
<TE>   "That's definitely a player thing," Anderson said. "His influence
can't make us that way. That has to come from within. Mike can
definitely set a tone for how the team is going to be run, but that's
a little different."</TE>
<TE>   Don't worry, be happy? Works for these guys.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to be able to turn the page and leave your worries
behind from the day before," Scioscia said.</TE>
<TE>   "That's a good lyric for a song, isn't it?"</TE>

<TE>   Matchup: It speaks volumes about the state of the Tigers that
pitcher Jeff Weaver appears to be happier in the Yankee bullpen than
he was as the ace of the Detroit staff. In an interview with CBS
Sportsline, Weaver ripped interim Manager Luis Pujols--"If they want
any direction in the future, I would hope they would find another
manager. I don't think there's any respect over there for the manager
and that's half the problem"--and said of Tiger President and General
Manager Dave Dombrowski: "He likes to have people around him to

<TE>   Matchup: The Indian uniforms are the same, but the people wearing

Bartolo Colon, who shut out the Angels on opening night, was traded
to the Expos. Russell Branyan was traded to the Reds. Chuck Finley
was traded to the Cardinals. Paul Shuey was traded to the Dodgers.
Ricardo Rincon was traded to the A's. Brady Anderson was released.
Manager Charlie Manuel was fired. The Indians' run of eight
consecutive winning seasons is coming to a crashing halt.</TE>

<KH>ANGEL REPORT</KH>
<HD>Schoeneweis: No Proof of Steroid Epidemic</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Bill Shaikin</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL>TORONTO</DL>
<LD>To those fans skeptical that the players' union is determined to wipe
out the perceived steroid epidemic in the major leagues, Angel player
representative Scott Schoeneweis says this: No one has proved there
is a steroid epidemic in the major leagues.</LD>
<LD>   The union discounts the recent estimates of such retired stars as
Jose Canseco, who asserted that 85% of players took steroids, and Ken
Caminiti, who suggested that half did. The national outcry
surrounding those and other estimates compelled the union to drop its
long-held opposition to random drug testing.</LD>
<LD>   But the proposal presented by the union last week contemplates
random testing to determine whether there is a steroid problem rather
than operating under the assumption there is one.</LD>
<TE>   Under the proposal, test results would first be used only to
determine whether steroid use among players exceeds 5%. If so--and
only if so--a two-year testing program would begin.</TE>
<TE>   "If we find it's 40%, that would be a problem," Schoeneweis said.
"If we find out it's 5%, or 3%, that doesn't seem like a problem to
me."</TE>
<TE>   With 25 players on each of 30 teams, 5% use would translate to 38
players.</TE>
<TE>   If significant steroid use is found and then reduced, the union
wants the testing stopped after two years. Schoeneweis did not agree
that the absence of permanent testing could encourage some players to
renew steroid use after the two-year program expired.</TE>
<TE>   "If you can eradicate the problem, why test any more?" he said.
"It may just go away. We'll see."</TE>
<TE>   Jarrod Washburn pitches today, then will fly to Chicago to
represent the Angels at Monday's union meeting, one at which a strike
date could be set.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Outfielder Tim Salmon is expected to sit out a game or two after
his left hand was hit and bruised by a pitch from Toronto's Steve
Parris. Salmon was taken to a hospital for X-rays, which were
negative, and which also proved that Joe West is better off as an
umpire than as a doctor.</TE>
<TE>   As soon as he was hit, Salmon grabbed his hand in pain and did not
even make a move to first base as trainer Ned Bergert treated him.</TE>
<TE>   Salmon said he was concerned about a possible broken bone,
particularly when he heard West, the plate umpire, say, "Oh, he just
broke his hand."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Manager Mike Scioscia dropped third baseman Troy Glaus to sixth in
the batting order against right-handers, behind designated hitter
Brad Fullmer.</TE>
<TE>   While Fullmer is hot and Glaus is not, the season statistics
support the move too: Fullmer has 14 home runs, a .291 batting
average and a .578 slugging percentage against right-handers, and he
strikes out once every 13 at-bats. Glaus has 13 home runs, a .205
batting average and a .384 slugging percentage against right-handers,
and he strikes out once every four at-bats.</TE>
<TE>   TODAY</TE>
<TE>   ANGELS' JARROD WASHBURN</TE>
<TE>   (14-3, 3.13 ERA)</TE>
<TE>   vs.</TE>
<TE>   BLUE JAYS' ROY HALLADAY</TE>
<TE>   (14-4, 2.74 ERA)</TE>
<TE>   SkyDome, 10 a.m. PDT</TE>
<TE>   Radio--KLAC (570), XPRS (1090).</TE>
<TE>   Update--Washburn ranks second and Halladay third among AL starters
in winning percentage, behind Pedro Martinez, and both rank among the
top seven in earned-run average. In the only other meeting of 14-game
winners this season, Boston's Derek Lowe beat Oakland's Barry Zito
last week.</TE>

<HD>Bonds Eats Up History</HD>
<DH>Baseball: A day after hitting 600th home run, he breaks
season mark for intentional walks in Giants' 8-3 victory.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>The morning after Barry Bonds joined an exclusive home run club, he
wandered through the San Francisco Giants' clubhouse carrying a large
wicker basket.</LD>
<LD>   "You guys want some pot stickers?" Bonds asked, lifting the lid to
reveal the Chinese appetizers.</LD>
<LD>   Bonds' 600th homer put him in the company of Hank Aaron, Babe Ruth
and Willie Mays as the only major leaguers to reach the mark.</LD>
<TE>   The fans blanketed Bonds with cheers on Friday night and Saturday,
when Bonds stayed in the Giants' lineup to contribute to their
playoff chase despite a torn hamstring that prevents him from
sprinting.</TE>
<TE>   "We all need to play," Bonds said. "We're down to the part of the
season where it's gut-wrenching time.... I don't worry about the
history right now."</TE>
<TE>   The atmosphere from Bonds' latest magical night hadn't evaporated
Saturday at Pacific Bell Park--and neither had his penchant for
making history.</TE>
<TE>   Bonds broke Willie McCovey's major league record for intentional
walks in a season, drawing three in an 8-3 victory over Pittsburgh to
give him 46 for the year. McCovey had 45 in 1969 with the Giants.</TE>
<TE>   "I see myself in 50 years talking about this--talking about Barry,
and what I saw," said Shawon Dunston, Bonds' teammate and friend.</TE>
<TE>   "People just don't appreciate him. You need to appreciate him.
This is old-time baseball. This is Babe Ruth, Willie Mays and Hank
Aaron, Mickey Mantle, Frank Robinson, Joe DiMaggio. He deserves to be
honored like them."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Pirates' lineup card from Friday night's game was stolen from
Giant Manager Dusty Baker's office.</TE>
<TE>   Baker planned to present the card and his own lineup card to
Bonds, but when Baker got to work Saturday, the Pirates' card was
missing from the folder in which he had stored it.</TE>
<TE>   "I hate a thief," Baker said. "There are too many keys around
here. I shouldn't have to lock up everything in my office."</TE>

<LD>Second baseman Mark Grudzielanek made a curtain call after his
dramatic eighth-inning home run gave the Dodgers an electrifying
come-from-behind win over Philadelphia on Friday night, but his real
encore didn't come until Saturday night.</LD>
<LD>   Grudzielanek lined a two-run homer to right to tie the game in the
bottom of the seventh, and Marquis Grissom capped a five-run rally
with a two-run single to lift the Dodgers to a 10-8 come-from-behind
victory over the Phillies before 48,321 in Dodger Stadium.</LD>
<LD>   The late Dodger rally upstaged a strong individual performance by
Philadelphia catcher Mike Lieberthal, who hit three home runs, and
gave the Dodgers their fourth consecutive win after going 8-17 in
their first 25 games after the All-Star break.</LD>
<TE>   The Dodgers, who notched franchise victory No. 9,000, remained six
games behind Arizona in the National League West and 1 1/2 games
ahead of San Francisco in the NL wild-card race.</TE>
<TE>   "You can't really beat that, I guess," Dodger right fielder Shawn
Green said of Grudzielanek's back-to-back heroics. "He gets in good
grooves where he drives the ball to right field and
right-center--that's a great sign for him and for us. ...</TE>
<TE>   "We've had two emotional games, and to come back and win two in a
row like that is a lot tougher than people realize. It's huge for us.
We've got to start rolling now and try to make up for some bad times
we had right after the All-Star break."</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers were on a roll Saturday night, taking a 5-2 lead in
the second, but Lieberthal hit a solo homer in the fourth, sparked a
three-run rally with a leadoff homer in the sixth and hit a two-run
homer off reliever Giovanni Carrara in the seventh to give the
Phillies an 8-5 lead.</TE>
<TE>   But hot-hitting Dodger third baseman Adrian Beltre, who is batting
.441 in the last 14 games, doubled to left to open the bottom of the
seventh.</TE>
<TE>   Green, who hit a prodigious, 440-foot two-run homer in the first
inning, his seventh homer in 11 games, and Paul Lo Duca grounded out,
but Eric Karros kept the inning alive with an RBI single, making it
8-6. Grudzielanek then hammered an 0-1 Rheal Cormier pitch over the
wall in right for an 8-8 tie.</TE>
<TE>   Alex Cora followed with an infield single, and Cesar Izturis hit a
pinch-hit single to center. Dave Roberts walked off reliever Dan
Plesac, to load the bases, a call that brought Phillie Manager Larry
Bowa out for lengthy, animated arguments with home-plate umpire Rob
Drake and crew chief Steve Rippley. Bowa was ejected and right-hander
Carlos Silva was summoned.</TE>
<TE>   Grissom, who grounded into a double play with runners on first and
third to end the sixth, greeted Silva with a two-run single to right
to give the Dodgers a 10-8 lead.</TE>
<TE>   Paul Quantrill (3-4) retired the side in order in the eighth, and
Eric Gagne retired the side in order in the ninth, including a
strikeout of Lieberthal, for his 39th save.</TE>
<TE>   "This is August, and we're in a situation where every game is
important," Grudzielanek said. "The last two games have been
extremely important to put us in a positive mood. We scored some runs
the last few days, and hopefully we can carry this into a situation
where we're fighting for what we want at the end of the year."</TE>
<TE>   Said Manager Jim Tracy: "We were pushed down [after the All-Star
break] and that tested the resolve of our club, but now we're showing
our true character. We got pushed down enough to where it could have
cracked our spirit, but we didn't get down. We kept telling
ourselves, today is going to be the day."</TE>
<TE>   Now, the question is, will this be the day a hunger strike ends in
the Dodger clubhouse? After the Dodgers' 3-1 loss to Pittsburgh on
Tuesday, their sixth loss in nine games, Dodger muscle therapist Bill
La Seur, hoping to change the team's luck, vowed not to eat solid
foods again until the Dodgers lost.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers beat the Pirates on Wednesday and Thursday nights, and
their stunning victory over the Phillies on Friday kept La Seur on
the slim-way-too-fast program for a fourth day Saturday.</TE>

<LD>   Site: Olympic Stadium, Montreal.</LD>
<TE>   Matchup: The Expos, who thought they were dead in the water in
late July when they traded Cliff Floyd to the Red Sox, have come to
life in the wild-card race and trailed the Dodgers by only 6 1/2
games after Friday's games. They're doing it without the help of
Fernando Tatis, who went 25 at-bats without a hit last week, and
instead are relying on the Japanese pitching duo of Masato Yoshii,
who threw a complete game Tuesday against St. Louis, and Tomo Ohka,
who gave up one run in eight innings in Wednesday's win over the
Cardinals. Second baseman Jose Vidro is hitting .383 with runners in
scoring position, best in the National League.</TE>

<TE>   Series: Friday, 4 p.m.; Saturday, 4 p.m.; Sunday 10 a.m. (all

<TE>   Matchup: The Mets surged to a 15-11 record in July, ending
speculation they might trade second baseman Roberto Alomar or third
baseman Edgardo Alfonzo and begin to rebuild for 2003, but they won
only two of their first eight games in August to slip 6 1/2 games
behind the Dodgers in the wild-card race through Friday. Perhaps
Thursday's 9-0 pasting of the Brewers will get the Mets back on
track. Catcher Mike Piazza is hitting .283 with 23 homers and 73
RBIs, and Mo Vaughn is batting .257 with 19 homers and 57 RBIs after
a sluggish start, when he hit .234 with four homers and 18 RBIs in
April and May. Former Dodger right-hander Pedro Astacio is 11-4.</TE>

<KH>DODGER REPORT</KH>
<HD>Jordan Might Need an MRI on Stiff Back</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Mike DiGiovanna</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Left fielder Brian Jordan, who sat out his second consecutive game
because of a lower-back problem Saturday night and is doubtful for
tonight's series finale against the Phillies, said he may remain in
Los Angeles to undergo an MRI test Monday while the team flies to
Montreal to begin a six-game trip.</LD>
<LD>   Though doctors believe Jordan has suffered a muscle strain on his
left side, they want to rule out the possibility of a bulging disk, a
condition that sidelined Jordan for more than two-thirds of the 1997
season with St. Louis but did not require surgery.</LD>
<LD>   If an MRI test reveals no major abnormalities, Jordan, who did not
swing a bat or throw a baseball Saturday, could join the team in time
for Tuesday's game against the Expos.</LD>
<TE>   "I'm locked up on the left side," said Jordan, whose left knee has
bothered him all season and will require surgery this winter. "It's
too early to say whether or not I'll have to go on the disabled list.
I'm taking it day by day. I don't want to swing [Saturday] and set
myself back. If it loosens up, I can start running and throwing."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Pitcher Kevin Brown felt no ill effects from Friday night's
rehabilitation start for triple-A Las Vegas, and the right-hander,
who underwent surgery for a herniated disk on June 11, will be
activated this week.</TE>
<TE>   But Manager Jim Tracy said he will not make a final decision about
Brown's return date--or about whose spot, either Omar Daal or
Kazuhisa Ishii, he takes in the rotation--until Brown throws a
bullpen session today.</TE>
<TE>   "I would say, as of now, I don't know what else he would
accomplish with another rehab start," Tracy said. "I won't completely
rule it out, but he threw 86 pitches [Friday night], he's extended,
and pitch count is not an issue. To send him out [to triple-A] again
wouldn't make much sense."</TE>
<TE>   Brown gave up one run and five hits in six innings at Edmonton on
Friday night, striking out five, walking one and retiring the first
11 batters.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Dodger bullpen was short-handed Saturday night because
left-hander Jesse Orosco, who has given up one earned run and five
hits and struck out 10 in nine innings of his last 16 appearances,
was not available because of stiffness in his back. Orosco, 45, sat
out two weeks in May because of a strained rib-cage muscle.... There
were numerous casualties in the annual Hollywood Stars game, which
preceded Saturday night's Dodgers-Phillies game. Tony Danza took a
baseball in the forehead, suffering a scrape, but was able to sing
the national anthem, and Billy Crystal strained his back. "They
kicked me out of the training room," Jordan said of the celebrities.</TE>

of his last five starts, Perez is still looking for his first victory
since July 5. Wolf, a left-hander, has a 2.34 ERA over his last six
starts but has only three wins in that span. The Dodgers are 18-8
against left-handed starters this season, including Thursday night's
10-5 win over Pittsburgh, in which they pounded Jimmy Anderson for
six runs and eight hits in six innings.</TE>

<HD>Chip on His Shoulder Now Bat in His Hands</HD>
<DH>Dodgers: After lethargic first half, Grudzielanek comes
alive with two dramatic home runs.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE DiGIOVANNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A bum hamstring, sore back and painful bumps on the back of his right
hand slowed Dodger second baseman Mark Grudzielanek in the first
half, but an even bigger deterrent may have been that helmet-sized
chip on his shoulder.</LD>
<LD>   Grudzielanek, who has hit dramatic home runs against the
Philadelphia Phillies the last two nights, said Saturday that his
second-half surge has been as much the result of an attitude
adjustment as any adjustments at the plate.</LD>
<LD>   A No. 2 hitter for much of his career, Grudzielanek opened the
season in the eighth spot, and he stewed so much about the demotion
that it affected his play during a first half in which he hit .245
with four homers and 28 runs batted in.</LD>
<TE>   "There was a lack of communication early, and we didn't handle it
the right way," Grudzielanek said of Manager Jim Tracy. "I don't want
to say I lost my drive [to play], but I had a relaxed attitude. I
wasn't professional. I had a chip on my shoulder."</TE>
<TE>   It took several phone calls around the All-Star break from
friends, family members and his agent to snap Grudzielanek out of his
funk. Each message had a familiar refrain: You only play this game
once; don't leave it with any regrets.</TE>
<TE>   "That woke me up a bit," said Grudzielanek, who hit a three-run,
eighth-inning homer to beat the Phillies on Friday night and a
two-run, game-tying shot in the seventh inning Saturday. "I was
letting things slide a bit, and I'm usually never like that. I
usually get after it every day. I was kind of going through the
motions, trying to step up when I could. But you can't turn it on and
off in this game....</TE>
<TE>   "I had to move on, be a man. It took me a while to realize what I
had to do on and off the field to help the team. Now, I have that
fire to go out and play. I love the game, and I started playing it
like I was a kid again. I'm not worried about politics. I'm just
enjoying the game with my teammates, having fun."</TE>
<TE>   The result has been a more spry Grudzielanek, 32, who has made
several diving catches and turned some impressive double plays in
recent weeks. And offensively, Grudzielanek, hitting mostly in the
seventh spot, has been locked in for almost a month.</TE>
<TE>   Before Saturday night's game, Grudzielanek was batting .354 with
two home runs and 12 RBIs in 27 games since the All-Star break,
lifting his average to .274.</TE>
<TE>   His biggest hit of the season came Friday, when he countered Pat
Burrell's grand slam in the top of the eighth with his game-winning
homer in the bottom of the inning off Mike Timlin.</TE>
<TE>   "I didn't notice any change of intensity, but he's a much more
successful player now," Tracy said. "What we're seeing is
consistency, day in and day out.... We've also seen a healthier
looking player. Just before the All-Star break, his legs started
getting up and under him, and his lateral quickness improved. He
wasn't in the best physical condition in spring training, and it took
longer to get into the condition he's in now."</TE>
<TE>   Grudzielanek, who said he had "five or six" closed-door meetings
with Tracy during the first month of the season, would say the same
about his mental condition.</TE>
<TE>   "I like to be in the middle of everything, I wasn't put in that
situation, and it was a strange thing," said Grudzielanek, a former
Expo infielder who was in Montreal (1995-98) while Tracy was a bench
coach there.</TE>
<TE>   "I handled it improperly. I was chapped about things and trying
not to let it show. But Trace and I go back a long way. We were not
on the same page that first month. It took a little time to get back
on track, and hopefully it continues."</TE>

<HD>'Human' Woods Leads by One</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Tiger Woods was in position to run away with the Buick Open. Instead,
he ran into early trouble.</LD>
<LD>   "I didn't really have the stuff I had the last couple days," Woods
said. "Didn't quite feel as comfortable over the shots, but I got it
to under par for the day, that's something I am proud of."</LD>
<LD>   Woods struggled to one-under-par 71 Saturday but held onto a
one-stroke lead over Esteban Toledo at Grand Blanc, Mich.</LD>
<TE>   "We're all human," said Woods, who had opened with rounds of
67-63. "I think that's the simplest way to explain it. This game is
so fickle."</TE>
<TE>   Four strokes ahead after the second round, Woods had a double
bogey after going out of bounds on the first hole at Warwick Hills
and was three strokes behind at one point before rallying.</TE>
<TE>   Preparing for the PGA Championship next week at Hazeltine in
Chaska, Minn., Woods has won 24 of 26 PGA Tour events when leading or
tied for the lead entering the final round.</TE>
<TE>   If he holds on for his 33rd victory on the PGA Tour and fourth
this year, he would do something that rarely happens in the Buick
Open. Since 1958, only 15 of 37 players who have at least shared the
lead after 54 holes have won.</TE>
<TE>   Toledo, who enjoyed the lead for a few holes, was a stroke back at
14 under after a 67. Fred Funk (67) and Bob Tway (68) were 12 under,
and first-round leader Kent Jones (70) followed at 11 under.</TE>
<TE>   Of the top five on the leaderboard, Woods is the only player with
a victory in the last four seasons. Toledo and Jones have never won a
PGA Tour event.</TE>
<TE>   "I've told a lot of people that I will quit this game if I win,"
said Toledo, a former professional boxer. "My wife doesn't agree with
that because I have to feed the family."</TE>
<TE>   Defending PGA Championship winner David Toms (70) is among a group

<TE>   Karrie Webb will have to overcome a three-shot deficit and a
leaderboard packed with youngsters to win a third Women's British
Open title.</TE>
<TE>   Webb, who won the event in 1995 and 1997, shot a two-under 70 at
Turnberry, Scotland, for a three-round total of nine under, three
strokes behind co-leaders Carin Koch of Sweden and Jenny Rosales of
the Philippines.</TE>
<TE>   Koch made a 30-foot birdie putt at No. 18 for a 68, tying Rosales,
who shot a 65 to get to 12-under 204.</TE>
<TE>   Spain's Paula Marti shot a 69 and 19-year-old LPGA rookie Natalie
Gulbis had a 67. They were two strokes back at 10-under 206.</TE>
<TE>   Michelle Ellis (68), Beth Bauer (70), Tina Barrett (70) and Candie
Kung (71) were tied with Webb, who is trying to become the first
player since Mickey Wright in 1964 to win a major four years in a
row.</TE>
<TE>   "Obviously, I'd like to be leading, but three shots isn't too far
behind on this golf course," Webb said. "If we could get a bit of
wind up tomorrow, it definitely could go any way."</TE>
<TE>   Webb has 11 come-from-behind victories in her career, all from two
strokes or more.</TE>

<TE>   Hale Irwin shot a two-under 70 in windy conditions for a share of
the lead with James Mason after the second round of the Senior PGA
Tour's 3M Championship at Blaine, Minn.</TE>
<TE>   Mason had a 72 a day after shooting a course-record 64 on the TPC
of the Twin Cities. The leaders were eight under, three strokes ahead
of Bruce Fleisher (68), Bob Gilder (68), Rocky Thompson (71), Leonard
Thompson (71) and Allen Doyle (71).</TE>
<TE>   The wind, with gusts of more than 30 mph, did not prevent Irwin
from recording a 12th consecutive round under par--the longest streak
on the tour this year.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Nearing the wire of the $500,000 Sword Dancer Invitational Handicap,
Denon, the 2-1 favorite, had a clear lead and another Saratoga stakes
victory seemed inevitable for trainer Bobby Frankel.</LD>
<LD>   At the finish of the Grade I race at Saratoga Springs, N.Y.,
however, the spotlight belonged to With Anticipation and,
specifically, his jockey Pat Day.</LD>
<LD>   With a powerful late surge, With Anticipation, the 5-2 second
choice and defending champion, was up to beat Denon by a head and
help Day make history.</LD>
<TE>   The $300,000 banked by the 7-year-old gelding made Day the
all-time earnings leader among riders. His total of $264,580,968
pushed him ahead of Chris McCarron, who retired June 23 with
$264,351,679.</TE>
<TE>   "I would like to thank the thousands of horses that got me here,"
said Day. "I would also like to praise God for keeping me healthy and
injury free. I would also like to thank my wife and daughter and all
my agents over the years for doing an awesome job of putting me on
the right stock. You have to have the stock to do something like
this.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been blessed with talent and ability. I'm naturally small,
so I've never had to battle weight. I've had minimal injuries and
thank God I've been able to walk away from most of my falls.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm very grateful for With Anticipation. He was very courageous.
I think [trainer] Jonathan [Sheppard] deserves a lot of applause for
keeping this horse healthy and happy."</TE>
<TE>   Owned by Augustin Stable, With Anticipation, who was bred in
Pennsylvania, won for the 14th time in 41 starts and has earned more
than $1.85 million. This was the second consecutive Grade I victory
for the gray, who had beaten Denon by a neck in the United Nations
Handicap at Monmouth Park on July 6.</TE>
<TE>   "Pat did a masterful job," Sheppard said. "He said the horse was
holding his head a little high because he thought the ground was
stinging him. He's not very comfortable when the turf is really
hard."</TE>
<TE>   Looking to give Frankel his fifth stakes win of the meet at
Saratoga, Denon had no excuses after getting through along the
inside. Volponi, an 8-1 shot, finished third.</TE>
<TE>   "We had a great trip," said Edgar Prado, who was aboard the
runner-up for the first time. "I cut the corner and the winner was on
the outside."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Although it was not visually impressive, Buffythecenterfold, the
8-5 favorite, remained unbeaten with a narrow victory over 2-1 second
choice Tricks Her in the $150,000 Sorrento Stakes at Del Mar.</TE>
<TE>   Trained by Mel Stute, who won the Sorrento for the first time
since 1986, the 2-year-old Capote filly is now three for three and
has a pair of graded stakes scores on her resume. Before the
Sorrento, a Grade II, she had taken the Grade III Landaluce at
Hollywood Park more than five weeks earlier.</TE>
<TE>   This was the first win for Buffythecenterfold, who had to survive
a stewards' inquiry regarding trouble at the start, since a majority
interest was sold to Frank Stronach. . Thirty percent of the filly
was retained by Allen Brian.</TE>
<TE>   Ridden by Matt Garcia, Buffythecenterfold completed the 6 1/2
furlongs in 1:17 1/5. If all is well, she'll return in the $250,000
Del Mar Debutante, a Grade I at seven furlongs, on Aug. 31. Brave
Raj, Stute's last Sorrento winner, came back to take the Debutante
and eventually the Breeders' Cup Juvenile Fillies.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Xtra Heat did what she was supposed to do in the $125,000 Straight
Deal Breeders' Cup Handicap at Laurel.</TE>
<TE>   Facing only four overmatched rivals, the 1-9 favorite and
126-pound highweight rolled to a three-length victory over
Outstanding Info for her 22nd win in 29 starts. Ridden by Harry Vega,
she completed the seven furlongs in 1:23 in capturing the Straight
Deal for the second year in a row.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Valid Video, the 9-5 favorite, earned a trip to the $200,000
Futurity on Sept. 15 at Belmont Park with a 2 1/4-length win in the
$100,000 Sapling Stakes at Monmouth Park in Oceanport, N.J.</TE>
<TE>   Owned by Mark Fehsenfeld and trained by Dennis Manning, the
2-year-old Valid Wager colt completed the six furlongs in 1:09 4/5
under jockey Chuck Lopez. Valid Video is now unbeaten in two starts
and will stretch out to a mile in the Futurity.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Minister's Baby, the 5-2 favorite, won the $200,000 Gardenia
Stakes at Ellis Park. Owned by Michael MacKin's Lucky Seven Stable
and trained by Ken McPeek, the 4-year-old Deputy Minister filly
completed the 1 1/8 miles in 1:49 3/5. She beat Lakenheath, part of
an entry that was the 5-2 second choice, by nearly two lengths under
jockey Craig Perret. This was the seventh win in 20 starts for
Minister's Baby.</TE>

<LD>Some expensive youngsters get together today in Del Mar's second
race.</LD>
<LD>   In fact, two of the fillies alone cost $3.25 million when
purchased in September at Keeneland.</LD>
<LD>   Santa Catarina, who was purchased for $950,000 by trainer Bob
Baffert for owners Bob and Beverly Lewis, and Ashraaf, who set
Godolphin Racing, Inc. back $2.3 million, each lost as the favorite
in their debuts.</LD>
<TE>   Stretching out to 6 1/2 furlongs today, the two 2-year-old fillies
will try to make amends against only four opponents.</TE>
<TE>   A bay daughter of Unbridled, Santa Catarina was troubled when
fourth at 17-10 on July 7 but has trained well since coming to Del
Mar. She turned in a 1:11 2/5 gate drill nine days ago.</TE>
<TE>   Ashraaf, a Deputy Minister filly, showed speed in her debut on
July 13 at Hollywood Park, before tiring to finish fourth at 7-10.
She should improve with a race under her belt.</TE>
<TE>   Santa Catarina, who will be ridden by Mike Smith, is the 8-5
favorite on Jeff Tufts' morning line while Ashraaf and David Flores
are the 2-1 second choice. The field is completed by Major Run, the
beaten favorite in her June 15 bow at Hollywood Park for trainer Neil
Drysdale; Rousing Again, a $175,000 yearling purchase who has
finished third in both of her races for trainer Jerry Dutton;
longshot Trixie Chick and firster Bella Nunzi, a daughter of Proud
and True trained by Simon Bray.</TE>
<TE>   Race of the day: Orientate will try for his fourth stakes victory
of the year for the Lewises and trainer Wayne Lukas in the $200,000
A.G. Vanderbilt Handicap today at Saratoga. Jerry Bailey will ride in
the six-furlong affair. Other contenders include Say Florida Sandy
and Beau's Town.</TE>
<TE>   Who's hot: Garrett Gomez. The jockey reached 2,000 victories when
Adalgisa scored an impressive win in her U.S. debut in Saturday's
fourth race at Del Mar. Gomez added No. 2,001 later with Albatros.</TE>
<TE>   Who's not: Bob Hess Jr. The trainer lost with 21 of his first 22
starters at Del Mar.</TE>
<TE>   Exotically speaking: An exacta box in the sixth using Candor,
Chastity Belle and Shezasummerbreeze.</TE>
<TE>   Winners: Previous day/meet total: 1/35. Money: Previous day/meet
total: $4/$206.20. Total money bet: $276.</TE>

<LD>When he makes his 79th career start in tonight's third, Chapie, an
8-year-old gelding, will have his three owners cheering from
different parts of the state.</LD>
<LD>   Jack Karlik will be watching from his seat in the Hollywood Park
press box; Jack Disney will be watching from Ferndale, where he is
vacationing with his wife, Emily; and Doug Disney, his brother, will
be at Los Alamitos for the $2,000 claimer.</LD>
<LD>   What they should all see shortly after 7 p.m. is Chapie winning
for the 19th time as he makes his second start since being reclaimed
by trainer Christopher O'Dell. Fifth in his most recent start behind
Issues Falstaff, the California-bred faces an exceptionally weak
field--only five opponents, all of whom all have been struggling in
recent months. Chapie will be ridden by Baltazar Contreras, who was
aboard for his win at 13-1 June 13.</LD>
<TE>   The picks: 1. First Down Affair. 2. Mean Gene. 3. Chapie. 4.
Flirtatious Fred. 5. Azaine. 6. Hempen Sun. 7. Ipomea. 8. Dinastia
Toll. 9. Buzzin On By.</TE>
<TE>   Four! Use First Down Affair and Flyin Corona in the first, Mean
Gene, Beyond And Over, Oh Superman Go and Lucky And Proud in the
second, single Chapie in the third and Flirtatious Fred and Woody Dot
Com in the fourth.</TE>

<HD>A Ransom Wins His Third Vessels Maturity</HD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>A Ransom became the first horse to win the Vessels Maturity three
times and moved closer to millionaire status with a record-setting
victory in the Grade I on Saturday night at Los Alamitos.</LD>
<LD>   Owned by John and Kathie Bobenrieth and trained by Connie Hall,
the 6-year-old gelding and 3-5 favorite collected his 20th win in 31
starts and the winner's share of the $125,000 purse left him with
$987,056 in earnings for his career. When A Ransom reaches seven
figures, he will become the 34th quarter horse to hit the plateau.</LD>
<LD>   Ridden by regular jockey Carlos Bautista, the California-bred
gelding broke well from Post 7 in the field of nine and the Maturity
was basically over. Without any real encouragement from Batista, A
Ransom completed the 400 yards in a stakes-record 19.42 seconds. In
each of his three wins in the Maturity, he has improved upon his
final time. He won in 19.58 in 2000 and went 19.44 last year.</LD>
<TE>   With his latest success, A Ransom earned a spot in the $500,000
Champion Of Champions on Dec. 14. The winner of that Grade I in 2000,
he finished third behind Tailor Fit and Hawkinson as the 1-2 favorite
last year.</TE>
<TE>   "Right now, he's as good as he's ever been," said Hall. "The real
Ransom showed up for work tonight. I'm a little surprised at the
time. He just keeps on breaking his own records."</TE>

<DH>Reputed crime boss' alleged attempt to rig Olympic skating
may be tip of iceberg for international sports</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HELENE ELLIOTT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>His friends know him as Alik, a businessman who launched himself into
the orbit of athletes and entertainers like a satellite.</LD>
<LD>   Alimzhan Tokhtakhunov would get player-guest passes for the French
Open tennis tournament at Paris' Roland Garros, giving him access to
off-limits lounges. He befriended Ukrainian tennis player Andrei
Medvedev, who gave him a Mercedes-Benz, and Russians Marat Safin and
Yevgeny Kafelnikov. He also was an agent for soccer players, among
them goalkeeper Ruslan Nigmatullin of the Russian national team.</LD>
<LD>   He liked to live well--he owned houses in Italy and France--and he
liked to party, as documented by Russian TV coverage of a 1999 Paris
fete whose guest list included NHL star Pavel Bure, Olympic ice
dancer Marina Anissina and Russian singer Alla Pugachyova. He was
often photographed with Josif Kobzon, a singer known as "the Russian
Frank Sinatra."</LD>
<TE>   Dark-haired and stocky, he doesn't stand out in a crowd. Vladimir
Geskin, deputy editor in chief of the respected Russian sports
magazine Sport Express, said colleagues consider him "a rather
interesting man personally. He's a good storyteller.... He's the kind
of person who likes to be near something interesting."</TE>
<TE>   A card shark and gambler who operated on the fringes of the law,
he found fertile ground in post-Soviet Russia and its far-flung
sister republics, where government can't or won't provide basic
services.</TE>
<TE>   "You're looking at places where the rule of man is stronger than
the rule of law," said Sarah Mendelson, senior fellow at the Center
for Strategic and International Studies, a nonpartisan institute that
focuses on international policy issues.</TE>
<TE>   "Corruption is a part of everyday life from top to bottom."</TE>
<TE>   Law enforcement officials and those who study crime know
Tokhtakhunov as "Taivanchik," or Little Taiwanese, a nickname given
him because of the Asian cast to his features. They believe he's a
heavyweight who has been involved in illegal arms sales, drug
distribution and stolen-car sales.</TE>
<TE>   All of which might someday be considered a mere prelude to an
alleged crime that has shaken the Olympic movement less for its
brazen nature than its implications.</TE>
<TE>   In an unexpected twist to an investigation sparked by suspicions
that he was laundering money, Tokhtakhunov was charged July 31 in
federal court in New York with conspiring to fix two figure skating
events at the Salt Lake City Winter Olympics. Described in the
criminal complaint as "a major figure in international Eurasian
organized crime," he allegedly tried to bribe skating judges and
officials to carry out a vote-swapping deal that would give
Russian-born Anissina and her French-born partner Gwendal Peizerat
the Olympic ice dance gold medal.</TE>
<TE>   What he wanted was a visa to return to France, which had expelled
him because officials there suspected he had ties to Russian
criminals. Born in Uzbekistan, he went to Moscow in the 1970s and met
reputed criminals at an Uzbekistan-themed restaurant there. He
reportedly had French, Swiss, Israeli and German passports when he
was arrested at his Italian home in Tuscany, where he lived with his
third wife.</TE>
<TE>   "That a Russian can fix the Olympics when Russians fix sports
events all the time is not unlikely," said Louise Shelley, director
of the Transnational Crime and Corruption Center in Washington and
author of more than two dozen books and articles on international
organized crime.</TE>
<TE>   "To our way of thinking, it might seem illogical. To their way of
thinking, it's not," added Shelley, who knew Tokhtakhunov's nickname
and believes him to be a crime boss. "It's a question of how you make
things work. What is he going to do to change his position when he
wants to live [in France] and has real estate investments there? The
French haven't been doing so well in the Olympics and there's
corruption in their visa process and people are aware they can find
holes. It doesn't seem so entirely strange."</TE>
<TE>   U.S. and Italian authorities have transcripts of wiretaps in which
he allegedly discussed the fix with "a female ice dancer," her
mother, and other conspirators. Tokhtakhunov and Anissina have denied
wrongdoing, as have French and Russian skating officials.</TE>
<TE>   "I've spoken to several people who are specialists in figure
skating and they never heard of such a man before," Geskin said.
"From my point of view, it's impossible for someone who is not in
figure skating to make this [happen]. Maybe sometime he said
something about this. He could talk lots, but I'm not sure he could
do something. Officials in figure skating in Russia I know, some
people say they never heard of him.... In criminal circles, he is a
real man, but not in sports."</TE>
<TE>   But what if those circles overlap?</TE>
<TE>   Rules flew out the window when the Soviet Union broke up and its
former republics were thrown into economic chaos.</TE>
<TE>   "Communism vaporized and the only people left standing were KGB
[secret police] operatives implanted in the capitalistic West, and
empowered criminals," author Jeffrey Robinson wrote in "The Merger:
The Conglomeration of International Organized Crime," published in
2000. "They were the ones who stepped in to take over."</TE>
<TE>   Hockey players who flocked to the NHL to make their fortunes,
tennis players and other athletes became natural targets of extortion
in the lawless society.</TE>
<TE>   "There are so many areas of intersection between sports and
organized crime," Shelley said. "Five years ago, I was on '60
Minutes' talking about sports and [illegal sales of] nuclear arms. It
was being done through a karate club. Sports people are the only ones
allowed out of the country easily."</TE>
<TE>   The Olympics long ago lost any pretensions of purity, and ice
dancing in particular has been a swamp of scandals.</TE>
<TE>   Figure skating appeared to have hit bottom early in the Salt Lake
Games, when French pairs judge Marie-Reine Le Gougne said she had
been pressured to vote for Russians Elena Berezhnaya and Anton
Sikharulidze over Canadians Jamie Sale and David Pelletier. She later
changed her story, but Sale and Pelletier were awarded duplicate gold
medals.</TE>
<TE>   The case was thrown open again by allegations that Tokhtakhunov
had plotted to get the French judge to vote for the Russian pair in
exchange for a Russian ice dance judge's vote for Anissina and
Peizerat. International Olympic Committee President Jacques Rogge
declared himself appalled and said the results could be recalculated
if the allegations were proven. The U.S. Figure Skating Assn. called
for the International Skating Union to form an independent ethics
board to review the matter.</TE>
<TE>   Although figure skating insiders professed shock, the idea that an
Olympic event could have been fixed--or that a criminal or criminal
group could have been involved--was no such breach of faith for
outsiders.</TE>
<TE>   "It's naive to assume professional sports is untouched by this,"
said Mark Heeler, assistant director of the Nathanson Centre for the
Study of Organized Crime and Corruption at Canada's York University.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think it's entirely surprising. It's not unknown in the
sports world in the past. It's probably a product of figure skating
being such a lucrative business. The popularity of figure skating has
grown in the last decade. It makes more sense now from an organized
crime perspective."</TE>
<TE>   Said Mendelson, "Why would you think it would be outlandish? Of
course it's totally possible. Everything we know about the Olympics
suggests there's a fair amount of corruption. It's news, but the
story to me is corruption in the Olympics, not that the Russian Mafia
is involved.</TE>
<TE>   "The Olympics are about politics and they have been for a long
time. Politics is ultimately a struggle over resources. That Russia
is involved is symptomatic of the corruption [in Russia] and in the
Olympics."</TE>
<TE>   Tokhtakhunov is known to have associated with reputed crime
figures, including the singer Kobzon. But it's unclear whether he's
tied to what is loosely called "the Russian Mafia," which experts say
isn't exclusively Russian and isn't very structured. Robinson called
Russia "a full-fledged mafiocracy," with more than 12,000 criminal
organizations that have nearly 100,000 members.</TE>
<TE>   "There are no pyramid organizational structures, no family ties to
unite them, no commission to oversee their activities," he wrote.
"Instead, these groups are more like collections of friends and
associates who band together for certain crimes, going their own way
for others. As a group they may target a specific industry, or just
hold onto a specific territory. The term they use is 'zones of
influence.' "</TE>
<TE>   Alleged incursions into sports by mobsters are impossible to
document because fear scares most athletes into silence. But
mobsters' existence is well enough known for former German tennis
star Boris Becker to have planned to fight a paternity suit last
year, after he'd had a sexual encounter with a Russian model in the
broom closet of a London restaurant, by claiming the Russian Mafia
had stolen his sperm. He scrapped that defense when he admitted
paternity and settled before trial.</TE>
<TE>   In a more serious vein, Robinson lists NHL players Alexander
Mogilny, Vladimir Malakhov, Oleg Tverdovsky and Alex Zhitnik as
having been targeted for extortion by reputed mobster Vyacheslav
Sliva in the 1990s. He also linked Viacheslav Fetisov, a
distinguished player who coached Russia's Olympic team at Salt Lake
City, to a company that allegedly laundered money for Vyacheslav
Ivankov, a reputed crime kingpin now in jail for extortion. Fetisov
was chairman of a company owned by Ivankov, known as
"Yaponchik"--little Japanese--but denied any illegal activities.</TE>
<TE>   "The NHL took its time before admitting there was a problem,"
Robinson wrote. "And then, a 15-month investigation by the United
States Senate suggested that the extortion of Russian players in the
NHL was more widespread than the league was willing to 'fess up to.
Since then, Senate investigators have spoken about extortion of
Russian basketball players in the NBA and Russian tennis players on
the professional tour."</TE>
<TE>   NBA spokesman Brian McIntyre said his league knew of no threats
against its Eastern European players or threats by the Russian Mafia.</TE>
<TE>   Details magazine and a "Frontline" TV documentary produced by PBS
and the Canadian Broadcasting Corp. also found links between NHL
players and suspected Russian criminals. They also questioned Bure's
relationship with Anzor Kikalishvili, labeled a top crime boss by the
FBI. Bure called him a friend and denied he had been blackmailed or
had paid protection money.</TE>
<TE>   NHL spokeswoman Bernadette Mansur said league executives
investigated the extortion rumors and found only two proven cases,
neither of which involved mobsters. She also said NHL security
personnel have toured training camps each year since 1993 to warn
players about associating with people they don't know.</TE>
<TE>   "There was no instance of any involvement or intelligence about
any ties with the Russian Mafia," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Mogilny paid $25,000 to silence threats from countryman Sergei
Fomitov in 1994, but Mansur said Fomitov was a friend, not a crime
figure. Tverdovsky was a target in 1996 when his mother, Alexandra,
was kidnapped in Kiev, Ukraine, and held for $200,000 ransom. A
former coach of Tverdovsky's was arrested for allegedly ordering
accomplices to kidnap her.</TE>
<TE>   "I was worried about these things at the time," said Tverdovsky,
who was recently traded by the Mighty Ducks to New Jersey. "Usually,
when this kind of stuff happens, it was serious people. If that was
the case with me, I don't know how it would have ended. In my case,
it was a group of people who tried to make easy money. They didn't
know what they were doing. That made it easier for [them to be
caught]....</TE>
<TE>   "I think it is way better now. The country is changing from those
times seven, eight years ago when things were out of control. The
country is being put back together."</TE>
<TE>   Yet, fears remain. Duck forward German Titov lost his father and
brother within five months during the 2000-01 season after each died
in what he said were "falls from a balcony," although he didn't use
the word "suicide." Beyond that, though, he was reluctant to discuss
what had happened.</TE>
<TE>   Said a Russian player who requested anonymity, "You can't go to
Russia and ask these questions. If you do, you don't come back."</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, Tokhtakhunov sits in a Venice, Italy, jail,
proclaiming his innocence and vowing to fight extradition to the
United States, which will prolong a resolution of the case.</TE>
<TE>   "It was maybe a little surprising he was involved in figure
skating," the Nathanson Centre's Heeler said, "but maybe making
inroads there is easier than in other sports.... It will be
interesting to find out later how many people are involved."</TE>
<TE>   And whether this was the Olympics' first brush with alleged
criminals. Shelley, traveling in Europe last week, said newspapers
there gave the story extensive coverage and ran pictures of
Tokhtakhunov with reputed mobsters.</TE>
<TE>   "The Olympic process has been so corrupt," she said. "There needs
to be a lot more oversight of organized crime and the Olympics."</TE>

<LD>Sarah Fisher climbed from her car, broke into a mile-wide smile and
buried her face in her hands.</LD>
<LD>   The 21-year-old driver, in her fourth season in the Indy Racing
League, became the first woman to win the pole position in a major
auto race Saturday when she nudged Billy Boat from the top spot in
qualifying for the Belterra Casino Indy 300 at Sparta, Ky.</LD>
<LD>   "I've never been this excited to race. Just get me in the car!"
she said. "It's amazing how much fun you have when things are going
right."</LD>
<TE>   Fisher, who left Walker Racing after last season, was without a
ride until she joined Dreyer &amp; Reinbold Racing and teammate Robbie
Buhl and finished fourth at Nazareth, Pa., in her first start this
season.</TE>
<TE>   She led four laps late in the race at Michigan two weeks ago
before finishing eighth.</TE>
<TE>   "Being a woman in racing is nothing I've ever looked at seriously.
I've always just been a driver," said Fisher, who in 1999 became the
youngest driver in IRL history.</TE>
<TE>   While Fisher became the first woman to take the pole in a major
series, Shawna Robinson won poles for a NASCAR Busch Series race in
1994 at Atlanta and a 2000 ARCA event in Michigan.</TE>
<TE>   Boat, who in 1998 set an IRL record with six poles, qualified at
221.364, with Felipe Giaffone next at 220.430 and Indianapolis 500
winner Helio Castroneves fourth at 220.387. Sam Hornish Jr., knocked
off the pole by Boat, was next at 220.341.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Mike Bliss raced to his fourth NASCAR Craftsman Truck Series
victory, shooting to the front on a late restart and holding off Rick
Crawford in the Federated Auto Parts 200 at Nashville Superspeedway
in Gladeville, Tenn.</TE>
<TE>   Bliss, whose Chevrolet started from the pole but fell to third,
took advantage of Jason Leffler's 135th-lap accident that resulted in
the second of three caution periods. Bliss, who won $45,385 plus a
$10,000 pole-winner's bonus, averaged 129.442 mph.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Burney Lamar of Sacramento posted his second consecutive victory
with a wire-to-wire win in the NASCAR Featherlite Southwest Series'
Auto Club 150 before 6,262 at Irwindale Speedway.</TE>
<TE>   Lamar started in fourth but jumped into the lead on the green
flag, holding off Auggie Vidovich Jr.</TE>
<TE>   In the 75-lap Southern California Auto Club main event, Kevin Wood
held off Todd Burns. The second-place finish enabled Burns to
increase his lead on Tim Huddleston in the championship race to 46
points.</TE>
<TE>   Michael May won his fifth race of the season as he dominated the
75-lap American Race Truck feature race.</TE>
<TE>   Tony Solorzano</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Mike Faria made up for a long day with the shortest ride of the
night to win the four-lap scratch main event at Costa Mesa Speedway.</TE>
<TE>   Driving from Reno in a caravan that encountered car trouble, Faria
took nine hours instead of seven to reach the Orange County
Fairgrounds. Although the three-time national champion struggled
early and failed to make the handicap main event, he took home the
evening's top prize, outgating Scott Brant.</TE>
<TE>   Bryan Yarrow of Vacaville won the eight-lap handicap main event.
David Lynch of Moreno Valley won the Support main event, and Rohn
Zellner of Huntington Beach won the Support B main.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The Anschutz alliance is grumbling.</LD>
<LD>   The Coliseum cronies are squawking.</LD>
<LD>   Who says Los Angeles doesn't have NFL games?</LD>
<TE>   You thought this saga was over, that everything changed two months
ago when Anschutz Entertainment Group President Tim Leiweke and a
coalition of L.A. power brokers decided to walk away from plans to
build a football stadium next to Staples Center. Part of the reason
they backed out was that Coliseum officials announced their readiness
to spend as much as $1 million to promote their own stadium as an NFL
site.</TE>
<TE>   That made headlines for a few days but, as most news stories do,
eventually blipped off the radar screen. Things heated up again last
week when Leiweke, being honored at a KFWB breakfast, was asked about
the Coliseum. He essentially said the aging venue doesn't have a Hail
Mary's chance of luring an NFL team.</TE>
<TE>   That didn't go over big with the Coliseum folks, who say Leiweke
is shooting off his mouth because, a) his ego is bruised, and/or b)
he's waiting for the Coliseum to do a face plant so he and the
coalition can step back in and save the day.</TE>
<TE>   "For whatever reason, since June, Tim has felt it necessary to
play the blame game," said Zev Yaroslavsky, chairman of the County
Board of Supervisors and a member of the Coliseum Commission. "That's
unnecessary and uncalled for. But it's his choice. He's a big boy.
Maybe there's internal pressure in his company to blame somebody
else."</TE>
<TE>   Leiweke says he likes Yaroslavsky and respects him as a civic
leader. He also says Yaroslavsky is dead wrong. The way Leiweke sees
it, Coliseum backers barged in when the Anschutz group was making
serious headway with the NFL and left the L.A. picture hopelessly
clouded. Again. Just like what happened in the late 1990s, when
then-mayor Richard Riordan urged Peter O'Malley to drop his push for
an NFL venue next to Dodger Stadium so the city could cast its lot
with the Coliseum.</TE>
<TE>   "Once again, a stadium that would be privately financed got pushed
aside," Leiweke said. "That's fine. We're big boys. We've gotten on
with our lives, and I don't care about the Coliseum. But what they
also need to understand is, this is not the blame game. There's a
pattern here. And it ain't us. It's them."</TE>
<TE>   Us, them, whatever. Point is, L.A. has not had an NFL team since
the Raiders and Rams left after the 1994 season, and there is nothing
to indicate the situation will change in the near future. The NFL has
made it clear it has no plans to return to the Coliseum. Commissioner
Paul Tagliabue said it is not an option (even though he stood on the
stadium's steps in 1999 and gave it his blessing) and Baltimore Raven
owner Art Modell said earlier this year, "Putting a new dress on an
old hooker is not the way I want to go dancing." Other team owners
said the same things, although not quite so colorfully.</TE>
<TE>   Pat Lynch, general manager of the Coliseum, isn't worried. He has
seen the NFL reverse its field before. He figures his stadium is
miles ahead of the Anschutz proposal, if only because the place
actually exists. "If an NFL team comes to L.A. and starts knocking on
doors, we have a door," he said. "They don't."</TE>
<TE>   That's not to say the Anschutz group is done. Yaroslavsky and
others believe that coalition is biding its time and plans to
resurface when the mood is right. It's possible the NFL could tell
Coliseum officials they will get no "G-3" loan, a $150-million
cornerstone essential to any stadium financing plan.</TE>
<TE>   It's perfectly believable the Anschutz group could burst back onto
the scene. The group spent "multiple millions" of dollars on
drawings, models, real estate and legal work, according to coalition
member Casey Wasserman. Much of that material is gathering dust on a
desk in his Beverly Hills office.</TE>
<TE>   "That was private money," he said. "I haven't seen any
reimbursement checks from the city."</TE>
<TE>   And what of the $1 million set aside by the Coliseum? Stadium
officials insist that isn't public money but cash they raised and can
spend as they choose. It's a confusing argument, though, because the
Coliseum is a public entity.</TE>
<TE>   Regardless, Coliseum officials are in no big hurry to spend the $1
million, although Lynch said it will be spent over time. So far, he
has hired some consultants and number crunchers, as well as a
public-relations firm.</TE>
<TE>   The choice of that PR firm, Marathon Communications, has raised
some eyebrows around town because it also represents Forest City
Enterprises, a national real-estate company thought to be interested
in putting housing where an Anschutz football stadium would have
stood.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think [that's a conflict of interest]," Yaroslavsky said.
"They were contracted to help the Coliseum over a short period, not
to torpedo anybody else's plan."</TE>
<TE>   Halfway across the country, the expansion Houston Texans are
gearing up for their inaugural season. This would have been L.A.'s
team had Houston billionaire Bob McNair not written a $700-million
check in 1999. Already, fans there are crazy about their team. A
recent scrimmage drew a crowd of 35,000, and the Sept. 8 opener
against the Cowboys has taken on Super Bowl proportions. There's even
a Texan fight song that plays over and over on country stations.</TE>
<TE>   In L.A., we've got our own little ditty. The same old song and
dance.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Cleveland Browns' defense suffered a major blow Saturday with the
loss of Pro Bowl linebacker Jamir Miller, possibly for the season, to
a torn right Achilles' tendon.</LD>
<LD>   "Right now I don't know what the severity is," Browns' Coach Butch
Davis said after Cleveland's 27-15 exhibition victory over the
Minnesota Vikings in Minneapolis. "It's very disappointing. Certainly
his performance is going to be missed. We've got three weeks, three
preseason games to try and find an answer."</LD>
<LD>   Davis said Miller, a former UCLA player, would be out a
"significant" amount of time.</LD>
<TE>   Miller, the first Browns' player to be selected to the Pro Bowl
since the team returned to Cleveland in 1999, landed awkwardly after
being blocked into Brant Boyer on Moe Williams' four-yard touchdown
run on Minnesota's opening possession. Miller stayed on the ground
for several minutes before being carted off the field.</TE>
<TE>   "He ain't coming back," Browns' cornerback Corey Fuller said.</TE>
<TE>   Cleveland's offense was able to provide somewhat of a bright spot.</TE>
<TE>   Tim Couch and Kelly Holcomb combined to go 14 for 19 for 238 yards
and two touchdowns, and Jamel White rushed four times for 20 yards,
caught three balls for 81 yards and gave the Browns a 7-0 lead with a
45-yard reception from Couch in the first quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Indianapolis 28, Seattle 10--Trent Dilfer, given the Seahawks'
starting quarterback job in the off-season, sprained his right knee
in the loss at Seattle.</TE>
<TE>   It was not immediately known how seriously Dilfer was injured. The
Seahawks announced it was a sprain, but Coach Mike Holmgren said in a
halftime television interview it was more serious.</TE>
<TE>   "He had some ligament damage," Holmgren said. "We won't know the
extent until tomorrow."</TE>
<TE>   Playing in his third series against the Colts, Dilfer was hit by
defensive tackle James Cannida and defensive end Chad Bratzke as he
attempted a pass to Koren Robinson with 2:02 gone in the second
quarter.</TE>
<TE>   Dilfer was helped off the field and carted to the locker room. He
threw a 20-yard touchdown pass to James Williams in the first quarter
and the Seahawks led, 10-0, when Dilfer left and was replaced by Matt
Hasselbeck.</TE>
<TE>   Indianapolis backup quarterback Brock Huard, acquired from Seattle
in April for a fifth-round draft choice, passed for two touchdowns in
front of a crowd of 52,902 in the inaugural game at 67,000-seat new
Seahawks Stadium.</TE>
<TE>   Washington 37, Carolina 30--Shane Matthews gave Washington an
early lead, then Danny Wuerffel rallied the Redskins to a victory at
Charlotte, N.C.</TE>
<TE>   Randy Fasani, a rookie from Stanford, ran for two touchdowns and
threw for another as the Panthers, 1-15 a season ago, rallied from a
13-point deficit to take a 30-23 lead with 4:37 left.</TE>
<TE>   However, Wuerffel, who won the Heisman Trophy while playing for
Spurrier at Florida, drove the Redskins 79 yards in less than three
minutes to tie the score.</TE>
<TE>   A pass by Panther quarterback Mike Watkins was batted in the air
and returned 21 yards for the game-winning touchdown by lineman Carl
Powell with 1:09 remaining.</TE>
<TE>   Houston 13, New Orleans 10--The Texans won their first exhibition
game as Kris Brown scored the winning points, hitting a 27-yard field
midway through the third quarter at New Orleans.</TE>
<TE>   David Carr, the former Fresno State quarterback drafted first
overall, was nine of 14 for 95 yards as Houston's starters played the
first half.</TE>
<TE>   He was sacked once and pressured frequently by the Saints'
first-team defense.</TE>
<TE>   Tennessee 28, St. Louis 26--Undrafted rookie John Simon scored on
a one-yard run in the fourth quarter to give the Titans a victory at
Nashville, Tenn.</TE>
<TE>   With 54 seconds left, Tennessee had to stop Lamar Gordon from the
one on a second attempt at a two-point conversion after a penalty.</TE>
<TE>   The Rams recovered the on-side kick but turned the ball over on
downs with 13 seconds remaining.</TE>
<TE>   New York Giants 22, New England 19--Antonio Warren scored on a
30-yard run and a two-point conversion with 4:22 to play for the
Giants at East Rutherford, N.J.</TE>
<TE>   Kerry Collins added a 34-yard touchdown pass to Amani Toomer.</TE>
<TE>   Philadelphia 20, Green Bay 13--Dorsey Levens, cut by the Packers
in the off-season after helping them win a Super Bowl during his
eight seasons in Green Bay, had 64 yards and a touchdown in eight
carries in his only series for the Eagles at Philadelphia.</TE>
<TE>   Rod Smart--who wore "He Hate Me" on the back of his jersey in the
defunct XFL--caught a 31-yard touchdown pass for the Eagles.</TE>
<TE>   Denver 27, Chicago 3--The Broncos held the Bears to 44 yards in
the Bears' first home game in Champaign, Ill., while Soldier Field is
being renovated.</TE>
<TE>   Bronco quarterback Brian Griese completed seven of nine passes for
48 yards, and backup Steve Beuerlein finished nine of 12 for 78 yards
and a touchdown.</TE>
<TE>   Kansas City 17, San Francisco 14--Lawrence Tynes kicked a 29-yard
field goal with 12:35 left in overtime at San Francisco.</TE>
<TE>   Arizona 24, San Diego 17--Jake Plummer and Chris Griesen threw
touchdown passes for the Cardinals at San Diego.</TE>

<LD>The Dodger clubhouse erupted in laughter recently because All-Star
right fielder Shawn Green was featured on the cover of a national
baseball magazine, and former Dodger Gary Sheffield was on the back
page.</LD>
<LD>   A player opened a copy to display the pages and put it in Green's
dressing stall, reviving an inside joke about Green supposedly
needing Sheffield, traded to the Atlanta Braves in January, in the
lineup to succeed.</LD>
<LD>   Green chuckled at the layout and beat his teammates to the punch
line, saying, "Well, I guess everybody thinks I can't hit without
Sheff behind me."</LD>
<TE>   Green has proved he doesn't need Sheffield to continue delivering
for the Dodgers, providing the power behind their surprising
first-half performance, and emerging from a second-half slump with a
National League playoff berth at stake. However, the eight-year
veteran has been uncharacteristically inconsistent in his third
season with the Dodgers.</TE>
<TE>   He has assumed greater responsibility in a batting order that
lacks another major run producer, putting pressure on himself while
the club's other heart-of-the-order hitters have struggled. And teams
have often pitched around the admittedly impatient Green,
contributing to his frustration.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers acknowledge Green is the only player capable of
carrying them offensively, and the strength of his shoulders could
determine whether they qualify for the playoffs for the first time
since 1996. Green understands the situation and accepts the
challenge, but would welcome more help.</TE>
<TE>   "Without question, if you're hitting in the middle of certain
lineups, like the [New York] Yankees and [Texas] Rangers, teams that
are known as offensive teams, everyone's individual success is going
to improve greatly," said Green, who has primarily batted third this
season. "It's hard to get something going when you've got two quick
outs, and there's no one on base. It's just a different mind-set as a
hitter.</TE>
<TE>   "Ideally, every team would love to have a lineup like the Yankees,
but that's just not realistic. At the same time, this team is
centered on pitching and defense. We've just got to find ways to
manufacture runs."</TE>
<TE>   Green, considered the consummate teammate, did not single out
other players, blaming much of the problem on his inconsistency.</TE>
<TE>   He wonders whether the Dodgers, 11-17 since the All-Star break,
would be six games behind the first-place Arizona Diamondbacks in the
West and leading the NL wild-card race by only 1 1/2 games through
Friday, if he had not batted .237 in April, .250 in July and hit six
home runs combined in 193 at-bats. Green was four for 35 without a
homer and had only one run batted in during his worst stretch in
July, coinciding with the Dodgers' worst month (10-16) of the season.</TE>
<TE>   Then again, where would the Dodgers have been without Green's
contributions in May and June?</TE>
<TE>   He hit 24 home runs in 43 games from May 21 through July 6,
including the May 23 game against the Milwaukee Brewers at Miller
Park in which he hit four homers and set a major league record with
19 total bases. Green's batting average increased from .231 to .283,
and the Dodgers went 29-14 during that span. He also had 46 RBIs in
May and June.</TE>
<TE>   Overall, Green was batting .274 before Saturday night's game with
a .373 on-base percentage and .568 slugging percentage. The
left-handed batter has 34 homers, 87 RBIs and 80 runs--putting him in
the top five in the NL in all three categories--and is on pace to
join Hall of Famer Duke Snider as the only players in franchise
history with consecutive seasons of at least 40 homers.</TE>
<TE>   Green has six home runs already in August.</TE>
<TE>   "It has been real hot or real cold," Green said. "I've had seasons
where I would have a good half and a bad half, but nothing like this.
I've never had just a great four or five weeks, bad four or five
weeks, great four or five weeks. That hot streak I had earlier in the
season could be a once-in-a-career spurt, and during the times when
we've struggled, I've put added pressure on myself.</TE>
<TE>   "Like a lot of the guys, I'm trying to hit that five-run home run.
I try to be patient, but patience definitely isn't my best attribute
as a hitter. I continually say to myself, 'Wait for a good pitch to
hit, and just try to hit line drives.' Once the game is going on,
I'll get those thoughts in my head during the heat of the moment, and
then I start trying to do a little extra again. It has been a
constant battle this year."</TE>
<TE>   His teammates could make things easier down the stretch.</TE>
<TE>   First baseman Eric Karros and left fielder Brian Jordan had no
home runs and 12 RBIs combined through Friday since the break.
Catcher Paul Lo Duca was batting .193. Third baseman Adrian Beltre,
rebounding from an unproductive first half, was batting .333 with a
team-leading nine homers and 26 RBIs, and leadoff batter Dave Roberts
has been consistent.</TE>
<TE>   "When Greenie is going, he's the one guy on this team that has the
capability to carry a club," Karros said. "But the first month and a
half, he really struggled, and we stayed right there. The reason we
stayed right there is because we were getting contributions from
myself, from Jordan and from Lo Duca."</TE>
<TE>   But the perception is it's Green or bust for the Dodgers.</TE>
<TE>   "That's unfair," Manager Jim Tracy said. "It's unfair due to the
fact that what we're suggesting is that he's the only guy who goes
out there on the field every day. One of the things that helped him
go on that tear earlier in the year was that there were several
people on in front of him.</TE>
<TE>   "Is he a guy for the rest of our guys to rally around? Yes. Do we
expect him to hit at the same pace that we saw him go on over the
course of a six- or seven-week period? I don't expect that. That's
just unfair expectations of one of your players."</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The West Anaheim Little League All-Stars (ages 9-12) saw their season
come to an end Saturday as Western Region officials acknowledged they
had erred in interpreting a tiebreaker rule.</LD>
<LD>   Tournament officials announced Friday night that West Anaheim had
qualified for today's semifinal round after handing a squad from
Aptos its first loss of the tournament. But a team from Taylorsville,
Utah, protested it had been unfairly eliminated, so officials
reexamined their tiebreaker procedures and decided that the Utah
squad would advance on the basis of its 4-1 win over West Anaheim on
Tuesday.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Saddleback College's Blair Lucas, a third baseman from Lake Forest El
Toro, and Kory Knell, a first baseman from Salt Lake City, have
signed with Brigham Young.</LD>
<LD>   Other Saddleback players to sign recently include Scott Cheo, an
outfielder from Mission Viejo Capistrano Valley, with California;

<HD>Trojans Need a Running Start</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It has been a while, some would say decades, since USC had reason to
feel good about its running game. Coach Pete Carroll hopes that's
about to change.</LD>
<LD>   The Trojan football team opens training camp Monday with
competition at several positions, but nowhere is the sense of urgency
greater than at tailback and on the offensive line.</LD>
<LD>   "It's our No. 1 emphasis going into camp that we establish a good
feeling about our running game," said Carroll, entering his second
season at USC after coaching the Trojans to a 6-6 record.</LD>
<TE>   "We've got to run the ball better than we did a year ago. That
will affect everything we do on offense."</TE>
<TE>   Carroll's concern is understandable. The Trojans, ranked 19th in
the preseason USA Today/ESPN coaches' poll and 20th in the Associated
Press media poll, figure to need more than the passing of quarterback
Carson Palmer to survive a demanding schedule that includes a Sept. 2
opener against Auburn at the Coliseum, followed by road games at No.
6 Colorado and Kansas State.</TE>
<TE>   Once known as Tailback U., USC was left asking "tailback, who?"
last season after injuries depleted the running back ranks. By
midseason, fullback Sunny Byrd was starting at tailback, a situation
that contributed to the Trojans averaging only 87.7 yards rushing per
game, worst in the Pacific 10 Conference.</TE>
<TE>   Carroll says a more balanced offense will take pressure off
Palmer, a fifth-year senior whose uneven play--he has thrown for more
interceptions (33) than touchdowns (32) in the last three
seasons--has been partly blamed on a lack of run support.</TE>
<TE>   "We haven't played well enough in the last couple of years to
allow the quarterback to be in that golden spot where you'd like to
see him," Carroll said.</TE>
<TE>   With improved depth at tailback, USC hopes to strike gold with at
least one of three seniors competing for the job.</TE>
<TE>   Justin Fargas, an oft-injured transfer from Michigan, played well
in spring drills and comes into camp with a slight edge over Sultan
McCullough, who sat out the second half of last season because of a
strained abdominal muscle that required surgery. The other tailback
candidate, Malaefou MacKenzie, has been plagued by injuries and sat
out last season.</TE>
<TE>   "All three of those guys have a shot at it," Carroll said. "I
don't know how it's going to turn out, if somebody is going to take
the spot or we're going to play a couple of guys or three guys in
rotation. We'll just have to wait and see. But it's a great
situation."</TE>
<TE>   Of course, without a competent offensive line, it won't matter who
the Trojans have at tailback. Four starters return on the line, led
by senior guard Zach Wilson, but the unit's inconsistency last season
could make for some interesting competition in training camp. Four
heralded freshmen--Winston Justice, Fred Matua, Kyle Williams and
Chris Doyle--are expected to push the incumbents for playing time.</TE>
<TE>   "The young kids will have a real shot at every position," Carroll
said. "We don't bring in guys to redshirt or sit around for a couple
of years. We bring them in to see what they can do, and if they can
compete, they jump in."</TE>
<TE>   Overall, though, USC should benefit from experience. The Trojans
have 14 starters back, eight on offense, and 28 players who have
started at least once in their careers.</TE>
<TE>   All-American strong safety Troy Polamalu, a candidate for the
Thorpe Award, is the leader of a defense that should be quick and
physical on the line with the return of tackle Shaun Cody and end
Kenechi Udeze, both sophomores.</TE>
<TE>   Coaches will be closely watching the competition at cornerback,
where the Trojans must replace starters Kris Richard and Chris Cash.
Leading contenders include seniors Kevin Arbet and Darrell Rideaux;
junior Marcell Allmond, a former receiver who missed last season
after being suspended for fighting with other students, and junior
Ronald Nunn, a transfer from San Francisco City College.</TE>
<TE>   "We need those guys to do a really good job because we're untested
there," Carroll said.</TE>
<TE>   Special attention will also be paid to the progress of defensive
tackle Bernard Riley, a senior coming off knee surgery, and outside
linebacker Matt Grootegoed, a sophomore who broke his leg near the
end of last season.</TE>

<LD>No. 1 in the postseason. No. 1 in the preseason.</LD>
<LD>   Little has changed for the Miami Hurricanes since winning the
national championship with a perfect record Jan. 3 at the Rose Bowl.</LD>
<LD>   They're atop the rankings in the Associated Press preseason poll
released Saturday, hoping to become the first team to repeat as
champion since Nebraska in 1994-95.</LD>
<TE>   Despite the return of only 10 starters, Miami edged Oklahoma for
the top spot by 14 points in voting by the 74 sports writers and
broadcasters on the AP panel.</TE>
<TE>   Miami had 27 first-place votes and 1,746 points to Oklahoma's 21
first-place votes and 1,732 points.</TE>
<TE>   "Having the media recognize our program and our returning players
as the preseason No. 1 team not only acknowledges our potential but
gives us another reason to try and repeat as national champions,"
Miami Coach Larry Coker said.</TE>
<TE>   Rounding out the top 10 were Florida State at No. 3 with 10
first-place votes, followed by Texas (13 first-place votes),
Tennessee (three), Florida, Colorado, Georgia, Washington and
Nebraska. The Big 12 has four top-10 teams--Oklahoma, Texas,
Colorado, Nebraska.</TE>
<TE>   USC was 20th, one of four Pacific 10 teams in the top 25, along
with Washington, No. 11 Washington State and No. 15 Oregon.</TE>
<TE>   Miami also is No. 1 in the preseason USA Today/ESPN coaches' poll.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Former Brigham Young and San Francisco 49er quarterback Steve
Young and 24 others were inducted into the College Football Hall of
Fame in South Bend, Ind.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a humbling thing," said Young, who set 13 NCAA records. "I
had no right to play college football, let alone professional
football. How did this happen? That's the thought that's come out of
being elected into the Hall of Fame."</TE>
<TE>   Young is the fourth straight BYU quarterback to enter the hall,
joining Gifford Nielsen, who played from 1977-79, Marc Wilson
(1977-79) and Jim McMahon (1977-81).</TE>
<TE>   Others enshrined into the hall included former Oklahoma coach
Barry Switzer, former Sooner tight end Keith Jackson, former Michigan
receiver Anthony Carter and former Mississippi State linebacker D.D.
Lewis, who told the audience at a morning news conference how he lost
his wife, children and money battling drug and alcohol abuse after
retiring from the Dallas Cowboys in 1981.</TE>
<TE>   Lewis, 56, said he has been sober for more than 16 years. "You
look at adversity, what it does is make better people of us," he
said.</TE>

<HD>These Finalists Are Cut Above</HD>
<DH>Tennis: Davenport and Rubin appear all the way back from
knee surgery in easy semifinal wins at Manhattan Beach.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA DILLMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Whether or not the final between Lindsay Davenport and Chanda Rubin
today in Manhattan Beach is a testament to hours of rehabilitation,
sheer persistence and willpower, Rubin also knows it's a tribute to
one very good doctor in Vail, Colo.</LD>
<LD>   "Dr. Steadman is the man right about now," Rubin said, laughing.</LD>
<LD>   Richard Steadman is the noted knee surgeon who operated on the two
tennis stars in January, only days apart. Davenport joked that she
was jealous when Rubin progressed faster than she did in the early
days of rehabilitation.</LD>
<TE>   Rubin maintained the lead when she won a grass-court tournament at
Eastbourne, England, in June, but Davenport came back and beat Rubin
at La Costa in three sets about a week and a half ago. The next round
is for considerably higher stakes in the final of the JPMorgan Chase
Open at the Manhattan Country Club. It is Davenport's first final
since returning to the tour last month.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no question I'm tired, physically," Davenport said.
"Mentally, I'm still excited. I have a chance to win my first title
of the year. I didn't think it would come nearly this quick."</TE>
<TE>   If Davenport, the defending champion and third-seeded player, had
a relatively easy 6-3, 6-4 semifinal victory Saturday against Ai
Sugiyama of Japan in 67 minutes, then 12th-seeded Rubin practically
had a walkover against fourth-seeded Jelena Dokic of Yugoslavia,
winning, 6-0, 6-2, in 41 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   The first set lasted 15 minutes, and the crowd of 4,093 was
actually quite kind to Dokic. One of the few signs of discontent came
in the second-to-last game when Rubin hit a return winner. The crowd
booed when Dokic failed to go for it, and a surprised Rubin would
talk later of her opponent "packing in it."</TE>
<TE>   "Well, I was surprised once she started a semi-tank mode a little
bit," said Rubin, who stopped Serena Williams' 21-match winning
streak in the quarterfinals Friday.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not sure if she had physical problems that sort of reared up
in the middle of the match. I'm a little bit surprised that she
didn't try quite as much as I thought she would at the beginning of
the second."</TE>
<TE>   Dokic, who has played three consecutive weeks, complained of
having flu earlier in this event. Friday, though, she said she was
feeling much better, and she had the shortest and easiest
quarterfinal.</TE>
<TE>   However, she took a turn for the worse Saturday.</TE>
<TE>   "I wasn't feeling good," Dokic said. "I've had a lot of matches
and I couldn't even give 10% out there physically and mentally.
Physically I couldn't move and mentally I couldn't think the points
through."</TE>
<TE>   Still, Dokic was fit enough to play a doubles semifinal afterward,
saying she didn't want to let partner Kim Clijsters down. Dokic and
Clijsters defeated Corina Morariu and Kimberly Po-Messerli, 6-3, 4-6,
6-4.</TE>
<TE>   "The point where she got booed, that was kind of blatant," Rubin
said. "She just didn't try for the shot. And it wasn't a particularly
well-hit ball from me. From that point, it was very clear. The last
game she kind of got back into it."</TE>
<TE>   Said Dokic: "I'm really competitive, so it was really hard to hear
that. For me it was a little bit frustrating, and mentally I didn't
feel good about that. But hopefully it won't happen again."</TE>
<TE>   Rubin had seven aces and hit 17 winners to six for Dokic. Dokic
had 40 unforced errors, Rubin 21.</TE>
<TE>   Rubin wasn't sure what to expect from game to game, much less
point to point, from her 19-year-old opponent.</TE>
<TE>   "It's very difficult," she said. "You don't know if they've given
up totally. They're still slapping winners around the court. For me,
I wanted to keep playing within myself and not go for too much and
not let her back in. Sometimes, it's very difficult."</TE>
<TE>   The problem will be of a different nature today. Davenport has won
eight of their 10 meetings, including the La Costa match, 6-2, 2-6,
6-1. Rubin's most recent victory against Davenport came in 1995 at
Filderstadt, Germany.</TE>
<TE>   "I had a good match with her last week in San Diego," Rubin said.
"I had some chances early in the third set. I'd like to have that
back and do a lot better at that moment in time if I get to that
point in the match. She's continued to have matches and played better
and better. I've played better as well from last week."</TE>
<TE>   Davenport, who has won three Grand Slam singles titles and
finished last year ranked No. 1, was concerned about her future when
she learned she needed knee surgery in January.</TE>
<TE>   "That, for sure, was my biggest fear besides not being able to
play again," she said. "No. 2 was coming back and not being good and
not being successful. It's hard when you've been successful. I've
been in the top three for five years. I didn't want to come back out
here and be a top-50 player. I was definitely worried in the
beginning."</TE>
<TE>   Those fears subsided once she defeated Dokic in the quarterfinals
in her first tournament back on the circuit, last month at Palo Alto.
She was up a set and 4-2 in the second against Clijsters in the
semifinals, started musing about the ease of it all and promptly lost
in three sets.</TE>
<TE>   "It was important to get off to a good start," Davenport said. "If
you start off coming back from an injury not playing well sometimes,
it can keep snowballing where you lose all your confidence."</TE>

<LD>It seemed like old times Saturday at the Manhattan Country Club in
Manhattan Beach. On the stadium court in front of an appreciative
crowd, Martina Navratilova was playing in the semifinals of a WTA
Tour event.</LD>
<LD>   But this was 2002, not 1992. It was doubles, not singles.</LD>
<LD>   And Navratilova was bounced from the tournament, she and Liezel
Huber losing to Daniela Hantuchova and Ai Sugiyama, 6-4, 6-0, in the
JPMorgan Chase Open.</LD>
<TE>   Navratilova, who won five of her WTA tour-record 167 singles
championships and four of her record 166 doubles titles in Manhattan
Beach, played in the tournament for the first time since launching
her limited comeback two years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Navratilova, 45, probably thought she'd never play again in the
Southland. Her comeback, started in Madrid in 2000, has expanded far
beyond what she envisioned. This tournament was her 10th this year,
her 29th in a little more than two years, and she is committed to
four more before the end of the year.</TE>
<TE>   "It just sort of mushroomed," she said of her return to the
circuit. "I wasn't planning on playing this much, but when you put in
all the work off the court, you want to put it to use because it
takes just as much effort to get ready to play two tournaments as it
does to play eight tournaments.</TE>
<TE>   "That's what happened. I think I got more and more serious about
it and I could see that I was getting better. I still haven't reached
where I can get to, whatever level that is. It's the elusive search
for the limit, I guess."</TE>
<TE>   It's a search that may end after this year. Navratilova, who
combined with Natasha Zvereva to win at Madrid in May and has a 36-28
match record with a number of partners since her return, is undecided
about playing next year.</TE>
<TE>   "It's sort of creeping in a little too much," she said of her
comeback, which also included a one-tournament return to singles at
Eastbourne, England, in June. "It's taking over my life too much.
It's like the ivy that just sort of keeps growing. You don't really
notice it, but a year later it's two yards down the wall."</TE>
<TE>   Not that she hasn't enjoyed it.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm having a great time," she said. "It's frustrating that I
don't win as much as I used to, or at all. But the response I get
from the crowd has been just phenomenal. Everybody is so excited to
see me play again and see some shots that people don't hit anymore.
And getting motivated, perhaps, to do more with their life
physically, if not mentally. Don't let age be a limitation."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Chanda Rubin, who will play Lindsay Davenport in today's singles
final as she continues her comeback from January knee surgery, was
ranked a career-high No. 6 in 1996. But her coach, Benny Sims, said
she was nowhere near the player then that she is now at No. 21.</TE>
<TE>   "That was before any Venus and Serena [Williams], before [Martina]
Hingis, [in the time of] overweight Lindsay," Sims said. "She's a
much better player now, much more complete. The game is at least 50%
tougher now than in '96. All you had then was Steffi [Graf] and
Monica [Seles]."</TE>
