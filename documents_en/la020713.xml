<HD>(Way) Back Pay</HD>
<DH>Hollywood* A backlog of residual checks at the Screen
Actors Guild has some of its members in an uproar. SAG says it's
speeding up the process.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DANA CALVO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Studio City bar called Residuals used to give a free drink to any
actor carrying a residual check worth less than $1. It was a charming
tradition that came to an end about five years ago, when the liquor
control board got wind of bartenders giving booze away.</LD>
<LD>   But these days, many members of the Screen Actors Guild say they'd
be delighted to take that tiny residual check, as long as it got to
them on time.</LD>
<LD>   Millions of dollars' worth of residuals due to actors are stashed
in a walk-in closet on the seventh floor at the SAG offices on
Wilshire Boulevard. Some, like the ones for the late Nacho Galindo,
have gone unclaimed since he died in 1973. Others sit in a backlog of
SAG bureaucracy for months at a time. Residual payments are filed
four times a year by producers of television shows or movies for
rebroadcast in venues that range from worldwide syndication to pay
TV. These quarterly batches of residuals arrive at SAG en masse, and
last year the union received 1.3 million checks totaling $385
million, according to the union's chief executive officer, Bob
Pisano.</LD>
<TE>   The union, which processes the payments by hand, said it hopes to
have the system computerized soon. Meanwhile, it admits to a "slight
backlog" but said it cannot quantify the extent of the problem. It
estimates that 1% of the checks--totaling about $2.8 million last
year--are for actors it cannot locate.</TE>
<TE>   For some actors, the wait for checks can be excruciating, even by
the hand-to-mouth standards of the trade.</TE>
<TE>   Residuals for Holly Dorff, who has appeared in dozens of
television shows and movies as a background voice--a "looper"--bring
her $60,000 to $70,000 a year. Most recently, she looped "Minority
Report." It is crucial income for the single mother of a 3-year-old
autistic child who rents a two-bedroom apartment in Studio City.</TE>
<TE>   But last summer, when her child was being diagnosed and she wasn't
working, her residuals stopped. SAG sent one payment to her 100 days
after the studio had cut the check, a quarter late.</TE>
<TE>   "They said there were fixing the problems," she said of the
98,000-member guild. "I want to organize a boycott of my union dues.
Everyone else's bank is earning interest on our money. You're talking
about thousands of dollars sitting in an account that don't get
cashed."</TE>
<TE>   In protest, Dorff has not paid her union dues, about $1,776 a
year, since last November. "Why should we pay the residual department
salaries with our dues until they send us our checks? What they're
doing is wrong and illegal," she said. "I've been living hand to
mouth. I shouldn't have to live this way, because the money owed to
me is sitting there."</TE>
<TE>   Paige Pollack, a voice-over actress and foley artist who
worked most recently on NBC's "Scrubs," just cashed a check from January.
"The residuals are all late," she said.</TE>
<TE>   SAG said the system will be computerized in the next four to eight
months. In the meantime, the residuals department--a handful of
full-time staff manually entering and recalculating each and every
check--recently eliminated one step in the process.</TE>
<TE>   Three weeks ago SAG alerted members that it would withhold the
name of the specific production for which the actor was receiving the
check, which would expedite the process. SAG promises to mail out a
breakdown of the payment within 60 days.</TE>
<TE>   "I'd rather them have the money and get the information later,"
Pisano said.</TE>
<TE>   But Dorff said this will only complicate things for recipients
trying to keep track of their payments from various projects. She
said she finally threw up her hands when her complaints were met with
a call from a SAG representative who urged her to dip into the
emergency fund for actors, called the Motion Picture Fund, until her
residual check arrived.</TE>
<TE>   By this time next year, Pisano hopes to send checks to actors with
up-to-date information within 30 days of receiving the money.</TE>
<TE>   The frustration for members of SAG seems unparalleled in the other
unions, mainly because of the numbers. Neither the Writers Guild of
America nor the Directors Guild of America is responsible for so many
residual recipients.</TE>
<TE>   Not everyone finds SAG's system bad news. While Dorff waits
for her checks, Marlo Brawer says she feels as if a gift has fallen out
of the sky.</TE>
<TE>   Brawer was never enrolled in SAG, and she is not a professional
actor. Ten years ago, she had started work at a television station in
Medford, Ore., when Universal Pictures began shooting the action
drama "The River Wild," starring Kevin Bacon and Meryl Streep.</TE>
<TE>   Brawer was hired at the standard day rate then, about $500, to
play a young television reporter. Her scene ended up on the editing
room floor, replaced by the voice of a male radio reporter. She was
still thrilled to see the film and, over the next decade, kept busy
by working in television journalism and going to law school at night.</TE>
<TE>   Last spring, she decided to use her background as a springboard to
break into dramatic TV scriptwriting, and on her final day at a
television station in Oklahoma City last month, she was surfing the
Internet, dreaming about moving to L.A.</TE>
<TE>   "I popped on the Screen Actors Guild Web site just to see what was
going on out here," she said. "I saw a link to 'unclaimed residuals.'
I clicked on it and typed in my last name for fun."</TE>
<TE>   Under the link to "SAG 'Missing,' " Brawer's full name appeared,
and she immediately called SAG, only to discover it was holding 10
years' worth of unclaimed residuals sitting in trust that totaled
about $815.31. Brawer has moved five times since "The River Wild" was
filmed, and she never thought to update her Oregon address.</TE>
<TE>   She picked up her check one week after she learned the money was
waiting for her. "It's not a lottery windfall, but to me, who
recently quit my job to pursue my dream, money is money."</TE>
<TE>   In all, more than 45,000 names are posted on SAG's Web site under
"missing" performers, and a SAG representative expressed hope that
more people would click on to the Web site as Brawer did.</TE>
<TE>   "We're only as good as the information they provide the guild,"
said national spokeswoman Ilyanne Kichaven.</TE>
<TE>   "We have members who do one thing and then they decide not to act
anymore, and the movie is shelved and at some point is shown,
although they don't know it."</TE>

<HD>Jarvi Leads Solid Philharmonic</HD>

<AU>DANIEL CARIAGA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Paavo Jarvi concluded his two-night visit to the Hollywood Bowl in
this first week of the summer subscription season with another
serious, faceted program, this one comprising a brief elegy by Arvo
Part, the Violin Concerto of Beethoven and Sibelius' craggy but
lovable Fifth Symphony.</LD>
<LD>   The Los Angeles Philharmonic, its sound unobtrusively delivered to
the huge amphitheater by the resident aural engineers, was in good
form and gave solid, if not always soaring, performances. The
debuting soloist, violinist Elisabeth Batiashvili, a native of the
former Soviet republic of Georgia, now a resident of Munich, played
with polish, panache and deep acknowledgment of the masterpiece.</LD>
<LD>   Jarvi, the Estonian musician at the helm of the Cincinnati
Symphony, held the orchestra and this program together astutely, its
details attended to, its continuity maintained. He let the quirky
Sibelius work emerge in all its contrasts--with that granitic,
unyielding opening movement, the lumbering butterfly that is its
central Andante and its suddenly human-sized finale.</LD>
<TE>   The young Batiashvili brought remarkable poise and mastery to the
familiar Beethoven concerto, assisted nicely by stylish conducting
and clean playing.</TE>
<TE>   Part's touching quasi-threnody, "Cantus in Memory of Benjamin
Britten," began the evening with appropriate seriousness and
effectively quiet playing from the Philharmonic.</TE>

<HD>Is Funk Still Fly When Used in Commercials?</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Oscar Garza and Greg Braxton</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In case you haven't noticed, funk is making an in-yo'-face return.</LD>
<LD>   Eddie Griffin is bouncin' a big Afro in "Undercover Brother,"
Beyonce Knowles will be flouncin' an even bigger 'fro in "Austin
Powers in Goldmember," George Clinton and Bootsy Collins are layin'
it down in those time-warp Nike commercials, and "Strawberry Letter
23"--that ultracool slice of '70s funk--is the soundtrack to ... a TV
spot for Special K Red Berries cereal?</LD>
<LD>   Yep, that's what you hear as someone prepares their breakfast
bowl, adding strawberries (get it?) to the mix.</LD>
<TE>   We're happy for songwriter Shuggie Otis, who's collecting
royalties, but why is it buggin' us that this song is being used to
sell cereal?</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, is it any different than the High Priests of
Funk selling sneakers?</TE>
<TE>   We could've asked the responsible advertising parties for their
take, but instead we opted for Aaron McGruder, creator of the
irreverent, Afro-centric cartoon strip, "The Boondocks."</TE>
<TE>   "I love all that music, and the Nike commercial with Snoop was
really fly," said the cartoonist. "But I really hate it when a song I
like turns up in a commercial, because then I can't hear the song
without thinking of the commercial."</TE>
<TE>   Case in point: The shampoo commercial that incorporated the Isley
Brothers' classic, "Who's That Lady."</TE>
<TE>   "I just hated that," McGruder said. "I would just scream."</TE>
<TE>   Bottom line: "I hate to see anything good used for corporate ends.
Black culture has always been at the vanguard of popular culture, and
I'm very anti-advertising. Funk is this incredible music form that's
not going anywhere. I just hate that it's being used for this."</TE>

<HD>A New Link in Jesus and Mary Chain</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBERT HILBURN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>This appreciation isn't for a deceased musician, but for a departed
band. The Jesus and Mary Chain, one of the most exciting and
influential rock groups of the last 20 years, officially called it
quits in 1998, but it disappeared from the pop scene so quietly that
no one had a chance to offer farewell.</LD>
<LD>   Or maybe it was just that the Scottish group's co-founders,
brothers Jim and William Reid, had suffered so much commercial
frustration and rejection during their volatile run that no knew
quite what to say.</LD>
<LD>   Whatever. The arrival in the stores last week of a Jesus and Mary
Chain retrospective gives us the chance to finally raise a toast. The
Rhino/Warner Bros. collection, "21 Singles/1984-1998," contains every
single released in Britain by the band, including such gems as "Just
Like Honey," "April Skies" and "Head On."</LD>
<TE>   In England, Q magazine has already hailed the compilation,
devoting two full pages to it in its July review section--more space
than the new Eminem, Papa Roach and Vines albums combined receive.</TE>
<TE>   The Jesus and Mary Chain's stark musical sensibilities combined
relentless guitar feedback with lovely, inspiring melodies that
captured the torment of life's most difficult moments and the hope
that can help pull you through them.</TE>
<TE>   There were so many striking undercurrents in the group's debut
album, 1985's "Psychocandy," that critics worked overtime trying to
pinpoint the Reids' influences.</TE>
<TE>   Some heard the dark, obsessive, world-weary themes and pointed to
the Velvet Underground. Others heard the guitar shrillness and
thought of the chainsaw stylings of Einsturzende Neubauten, the
German industrial-rock band. For some, the sweet, disarming melodies
were reminiscent of the Beach Boys. Or maybe Burt Bacharach. If those
weren't enough, there was also the youthful adrenaline rush of Phil
Spector's records with the Crystals and the Ronettes.</TE>
<TE>   The Reids, the only permanent members of the band, combined those
influences so artfully that the phrase "Jesus and Mary
Chain-inspired" is now part of the rock-critic lexicon. The
description has been routinely applied to hundreds of bands, from My
Bloody Valentine in the late '80s to Black Rebel Motorcycle Club, one
of the most acclaimed of today's new bands.</TE>
<TE>   But the Jesus and Mary Chain enjoyed only modest commercial
success in England, and even less in this country. The music was
simply too abrasive for U.S. radio programmers. There were reports
that the brothers' relationship, always volatile, had become so
bitter at the end that they couldn't even stand being in the same
room. Never fond of interviews, they simply disappeared from sight.</TE>
<TE>   Given the darkness of their music and the emotionalism of their
nature, many old fans assume the Reids are off somewhere still
licking their wounds--or worse.</TE>
<TE>   But the story has an optimistic twist. On a whim, I called Rhino
Records this week to ask if either of the Reids was doing interviews
in connection with the album release, and I wasn't surprised to hear
that they hadn't agreed to do any. Still, the label representative
said he'd send along a request.</TE>
<TE>   I was surprised Wednesday to hear William, the group's guitarist
and chief songwriter, on the phone.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm really proud of the music we made, but it's the past," said
Reid, 44. "I feel what I'm doing is trying to regain my energy. I was
kind of shell-shocked the way the band split up and all.</TE>
<TE>   "Jim and I always had a volatile relationship, but never
acrimonious. Yet it became a bit spiteful and bitter toward the end.
It took a couple of years for us to realize we do love each other.
We're doing fine now."</TE>
<TE>   Living in L.A. now, Reid is married with two children. He's
working on new songs for a band he hopes to form sometime next year.
He said his brother, the group's chief vocalist, is working on his
own music in England.</TE>
<TE>   The Reids were ambitious at the start of their career, daydreaming
about someday playing Shea Stadium like the Beatles. But their shy,
withdrawn personalities simply weren't suited to the demands of rock
stardom. As soon as they became an overnight sensation in England in
1985, they seemed to begin retreating.</TE>
<TE>   "I think our ambition had a ceiling," Reid said. "Getting famous
and stuff sounded like a great idea when we started out, but as soon
as we got a little bit of fame, we went inward. We did talk about
playing Shea Stadium, but we eventually realized that to do that you
had to be a different person.</TE>
<TE>   "When I think about another band, I would like to be one of those
musicians who is hugely successful but still doesn't get recognized
on the street--someone like Dave Matthews.</TE>
<TE>   "I want to be able to live a normal life. I want it to still be
the way I feel now. I'm more secure emotionally than I've been in at
least 10 years."</TE>
<TE>   On a final note, Reid expressed sympathy for the bands that keep
getting compared to the Jesus and Mary Chain.</TE>
<TE>   "Whenever I read about that band Black Rebel Motorcycle Club, our
name is attached to them. I know how that feels. For years, all
anyone was talking about was about us sounding like the Beach Boys
and the Velvets. It's like saying we listened to a Velvets album and
a Beach Boys album and found a formula. It doesn't give you credit
for what you added to those influences."</TE>

<LD>Dennis Hall (Calendar Letters, July 6) "misses the boat," not The
Times and other media outlets, as he suggests.</LD>
<LD>   He seems to be speaking on matters that he knows nothing of. Yes,
Halle Berry's mother is white, and, yes, that would make the actress
half-white. That however, does not mean that she is not considered a
black (which is not un-PC to say, in my opinion) actress. Hall is
obviously unclear on the history of the rules of racial identity in
the Unites Sates.</LD>
<LD>   In the days of African enslavement, American law stated that a
person with one-sixteenth African (black) blood was considered black.
Period. This rule is no longer law, but by American custom a person
who is half-black is, in 2002, most definitely considered black. Take
Tiger Woods, for example. He may claim until he is blue in the face
that he is Asian, Caucasian and black (I think he called it
"Caublasian"), but he will be regarded as a black man until the day
he dies.</LD>
<TE>   Unlike Hall, I can speak on this with authority, having a
Caucasian father and black mother. I identify as black in part
because this choice is already made for me by society, by virtue of
my brown skin, full lips and extremely curly hair. But most
importantly, I identify as black because I feel a stronger connection
to this history. I gain strength from the legacy of my ancestors who
survived and even thrived despite being discriminated against since
the beginning of the 17th century. Berry, as far as I have read,
seems to feel similarly. I am sure that her Caucasian mother applauds
this (as my Caucasian father does), as she must understand the
reality of racism and racial identity in the United States.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Though I have never seen any evidence of any kind of
sexual-preference-based "mafia" in the entertainment industry, I do
think Rachel Abramowitz's commentary ("Meeting the Little People on
the Way Back Down," July 6) shows evidence of another very large and
destructive gang: the cowardly, sniping, off-the-record sources.</LD>
<LD>   Many sources were listed in Abramowitz's piece, including "one top
executive," "a prominent marketing executive," "one well-known
producer," "another top producer" and "one Hollywood sage." What I
wonder is whether or not any valuable information can be derived from
a "source" who is unwilling to have his or her name stand by their
comment. And I also wonder what is the value of journalism that
relies on these kinds of sources.</LD>
<LD>   Certainly you would have to agree that it makes it much easier to
prevaricate or slander in print when one has no obligation to own his
or her words. And I can assure you that those who tossed the mud
balls of "opinion" from behind a wall of anonymity were, at one time,
in line, or wished they could have been allowed to be in line, to
kiss Ovitz's ring when he was on top.</LD>
<TE>   Personally, I like Michael Ovitz. As a former agent, I'm still in
awe of what he did to revolutionize the agency business. As a
business owner in the filmed entertainment industry, I very much
respect the confidence and courage he showed in spending so much of
his own financial capital in trying to build a business, when the
paradigm had been to use that of public companies and then, in
failure, leave the mess to the shareholders. I'm sorry it didn't work
out for him.</TE>

<LD>Though the "Andy Warhol Retrospective" at the Museum of Contemporary
Art "hasn't created a mob scene" ("Warhol Draws Well at MOCA," July
8), the Warhol myth still attracts crowds. Contrary to MOCA director
Jeremy Strick's remark that the exhibition is characterized by
"extraordinary artistic quality," however, I would argue that
Warhol's robotic output is the product of a profoundly disturbed
personality and is not art by any objective definition of the term.</LD>

<LD>Having just read with interest Brian Lowry's column ("Going Far
Beyond Product Placement," July 10), it reminds me that a few
weekends ago I tuned to ABC on Saturday night as they were airing a
favorite James Bond film. After an hour of watching I turned
off--each time I got enthralled in the movie, I was interrupted by a
commercial break. I became so obsessed I started timing them--on
average, every eight minutes they ran six minutes of commercials! I
actually left my TiVo recording and watched it the next day, zapping
through the commercials.</LD>
<LD>   Just how bad can it get? I can't be the only viewer who is not
prepared to watch television this way, but the advertisers are
pushing us too far. Many cable stations are running messages along
the bottom of a show plugging programs, promotions or their Web site.
How long before commercial breaks don't interrupt a program, but are
constantly visible the same way to prevent people like me being able
to use the TiVo alternative?</LD>
<LD>   No more prime-time weekend viewing for me.</LD>

<LD>Re: Don Shirley's review of Kenneth Lonergan's play at the Pasadena
Playhouse ("Picture of a Family in Crisis Hangs in 'The Waverly
Gallery,' " July 9):</LD>
<LD>   Shirley just doesn't get it. And I am glad for him that he
seemingly hasn't had to deal with aging parents who lose their
hearing, their sight and, inexorably, their minds. He dismisses the
play because at various times members of the audience said to each
other, "I know what's going to happen now" or "I know how this ends,"
and he faults the playwright for being so obvious.</LD>
<LD>   They knew what was going to happen because they obviously had been
there, not because the playwright didn't show enough imagination. The
drama here is the deterioration of a human being and the agony of
those left behind to deal with it. And more dramatic still is the
universality.</LD>
<TE>   This is, as Lonergan shows us, a human being who must be treated
with respect--no matter how crushing an intellectual and emotional
burden this places on everyone.</TE>

<DH>'The Guys,' about a fire captain and journalist working on
eulogies after Sept. 11, goes beyond the ordinary.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SEAN MITCHELL</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Tim Robbins has returned to the stage of the Actors Gang theater in
Hollywood with a full wind of relevance at his back. Paired with
Helen Hunt in the topical two-character play "The Guys," by Anne
Nelson, about the aftermath of Sept. 11, Robbins honors New York
City's fallen firefighters with a quietly commanding performance as a
fire department captain struggling to compose eulogies for eight men
his company lost in the collapse of the twin towers. Although the
show is technically a staged reading, Robbins' portrayal of an
ordinary working-class guy thrust into an extraordinary situation is
full-scale and begs to be compared with the actor's best work.</LD>
<LD>   The play, the first by Nelson, a journalist, takes its form from
the fact that, in the week after Sept. 11, she was called upon to
help a real-life fire captain in need of a writer to fashion eulogies
of his vanished comrades. When off-Broadway director Jim Simpson
asked Nelson to convert that experience into a play, the result was
"The Guys," first staged at the Flea Theatre in New York with Bill
Murray and Sigourney Weaver.</LD>
<TE>   Nelson wrote herself into the play in the character of a foreign
correspondent-turned-editor who, played here by Hunt, brings the
perspective of the educated outsider to the ring of horror at ground
zero. Under the direction of the Mark Taper Forum's Robert Egan, Hunt
bends her all-American girl image just enough to make us believe she
might indeed be a serious writer suddenly calling up all of her
talents to help a firefighter find the words to make an awful
occasion a little less awful.</TE>
<TE>   Her eyes burning with empathy, she interviews the captain about
his men, steering him to reveal who they were and what they did and,
in the process, making a connection with a laconic stranger that, by
proxy, becomes our own connection.</TE>
<TE>   Performed in less than 90 minutes, without intermission, "The
Guys" smartly employs a few serviceable dramatic tricks and
surprises. The set is bare except for an area rug and two chairs and
end tables, but the script finds ways to get the actors out of their
seats and addressing the audience when not addressing each other.
Each wears simple clothes: Hunt a black T-shirt and slacks, Robbins a
hooded sweatshirt and uniform pants.</TE>
<TE>   The play provides something of a corrective to the inevitable
cliches churned out in the immediate aftermath of the tragedy, and
that might be its greatest accomplishment. Searching to find a
foothold in the real and human, the beleaguered fire captain admits
his own discomfort at all the hype about heroism. "Bill was," he
says, struggling for a label to describe one of his men, "Bill was a
schmo."</TE>
<TE>   "This is the best job in the world," the captain recalls telling a
young recruit who has perished. But now he questions that bromide,
asking aloud, "How can I say that in front of his folks?"</TE>
<TE>   Unlike some two-handers, "The Guys" does not draw its energy from
conventional debate or a conflict heading toward resolution. But it
develops sufficient interest in the cross-cultural collision taking
place between the journalist and the firefighter. If this were a
movie, they would fall in love and leave their spouses and open a
grief-counseling service. This is why we still have the theater.</TE>
<TE>   Robbins marvelously underplays his role as the warmhearted but
inarticulate captain, the muscles in his face jostling with
inadequacy as he tries in vain to summon an explanation for what
happened. In stage-worthy contrast, Hunt is full of words and
introspection, turning up the emotional temperature as she reaches
out to reassure this bear of a man whose daily job it is to reassure
others. Their collaboration comes closest to conflict when the
journalist breaks down briefly under the weight of it all, prompting
the captain to want to stop. "You don't deserve this!" he says.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, no one deserves this, which is the inescapable theme.
It's not a new idea, but Nelson has made the familiar bracing by
crafting two memorable characters. There are digressions into the
journalist's life covering wars in Latin America that add a political
perspective--a subtlety mostly missing from the mainstream coverage
of the attacks. This is a welcome attempt to reason with the
unreasonable, but I'm not sure it's clear what we learn from these
speeches. Maybe it's not clear to her either.</TE>
<TE>   We do learn a bit about firefighting, about the difference between
engines and trucks and ladders. And we learn about the untidy details
of creating public memorials to guys who were, well, guys, about whom
the truest thing to be said is that one was dependable and another
good with his hands.</TE>
<TE>   "Everything the guy built was made out of metal, and it was made
right," Robbins says about a member of the company named Bernie. Not
a bad epitaph.</TE>
<TE>   "The Guys," Actors Gang, 6209 Santa Monica Blvd., L.A.,
Wednesdays-Saturdays, 7 p.m.; Sundays, 2 p.m. $40. Continues

<LD>   Angelenos Among World's Top Collectors</LD>
<LD>   Who are the big spenders when it comes to purchasing art? ARTnews
magazine has served up its 12th annual Top 10 list of the world's
most active arts collectors, drawn up after interviews with experts
in 22 countries.</LD>
<TE>   In any given year, there are at least five people spending more
than $100 million a year on art, an observer of the super-rich says.
And the art market has gotten an additional infusion from investors
seeking to sidestep Wall Street.</TE>
<TE>   Those making the list this year, in alphabetical order, are:
Seattle-based computer software magnate Paul Allen; New Yorkers
Debbie and Leon Black; L.A. collectors Edythe and Eli Broad;
Connecticut's Steven Cohen; San Francisco's Doris and Donald Fisher;
Ronnie and Samuel Heyman of New York, Palm Beach and Connecticut;
Marie-Josee and Henry R. Kravis, who made their money in finance and
investments; cosmetics magnates Evelyn and Leonard Lauder and Jo
Carole and Ronald S. Lauder; and Parisian Francois Pinault.</TE>
<TE>   Other entertainment folks in the Top 200: David Bowie; David
Geffen; talent agency owner Philip Gersh and his wife Beatrice; Elton
John; Steve Martin; producer Scott Rudin; TV executive Dean
Valentine; and CAA agent Beth Swofford.</TE>

<TE>   'Sesame Street' Tackles AIDS in South Africa</TE>
<TE>   An executive from Sesame Workshop, producer of the long-running
children's show "Sesame Street," told delegates at the 14th
international AIDS conference in Barcelona that the company will
introduce an HIV-positive Muppet character to the cast of its South
African program this fall.</TE>
<TE>   A similar move in the United States and in countries such as
Mexico and Russia is also under discussion.</TE>
<TE>   According to vice president Joel Schneider, the character will be
healthy in an effort to de-stigmatize the disease. She'll have
contracted the disease through childbirth or a blood transfusion.</TE>
<TE>   Four million South Africans (one in every 10) are afflicted with
the HIV virus--the most in any nation. And the number of cases has
doubled since 1996. AIDS activists have been critical of the
government's sluggish response to the pandemic--particularly comments
made by President Thabo Mbeki suggesting that anti-AIDS drugs are
"poison" and that the disease might not even be caused by HIV.</TE>
<TE>   Schneider didn't jump on the bandwagon, however. He noted that the
new character is being developed in partnership with the South
African Department of Education and the state-controlled South
African Broadcasting Corp., which airs "Takalani Sesame" three times
a day.</TE>

<TE>   And How Much Are These Handcuffs Worth?</TE>
<TE>   An antiques dealer, Russell Pritchard III, was sentenced Thursday
to a year in prison and ordered to repay $830,000 for staging phony
appraisals on PBS' "Antiques Roadshow"--a program on which people
bring in old or unusual items for on-the-spot assessments.</TE>
<TE>   Pritchard pleaded guilty to the charge, as well as to defrauding
Civil War collectors--giving them low appraisals, reselling the items
at much higher prices and pocketing the profit.</TE>
<TE>   According to prosecutors in Philadelphia, Pritchard made between
$800,000 and $1.5 million on the fraudulent transactions. He could
have been sentenced to up to 135 years in prison and more than $5.2
million in fines.</TE>
<TE>   Judy Matthews, senior publicist for "Antiques Roadshow," which is
produced by Boston's WGBH, says their appraisers are chosen upon
recommendations from major auction houses and that the station
stopped using Pritchard when irregularities surfaced in early 2000.</TE>
<TE>   MUSIC</TE>
<TE>   Perlman Giving a Boost to St. Louis Orchestra</TE>
<TE>   In an artistic and public relations coup, the struggling St. Louis
Symphony Orchestra has appointed violinist Itzhak Perlman to serve as
music advisor for the next two seasons. The band has an option to
extend the arrangement through the 2004-05 season, it announced on
Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Perlman, principal guest conductor at the Detroit Symphony
Orchestra, will conduct two weekends each season, participate in
final auditions for musicians and help to program concerts. His
connections, it is hoped, will also bring in major talent.</TE>
<TE>   The appointment comes at a crucial moment for the orchestra. In
April, former music director Hans Vonk unexpectedly resigned for
health reasons. Though Perlman will perform some of his duties, he
will not be replacing him, said Randy Adams, the organization's
president and executive director.</TE>
<TE>   The St. Louis Symphony is also struggling with financial problems
that threatened it with bankruptcy last summer. No special funding
was needed to secure Perlman, orchestra management maintains.</TE>
<TE>   QUICK TAKES</TE>
<TE>   Penelope Spheeris ("The Decline of Western Civilization") will
direct "The Crooked E: The Inside Story of Enron," based on Brian
Cruver's upcoming book. Written by Steven Mazur and produced by
Robert Greenwald, it will air next season on CBS.... Danny Glover
will develop and star in his first television series--a project
slated for CBS's 2003-04 lineup.... Facing an evaporating advance and
sluggish sales, the Broadway production of "The Full Monty" put its
top $85 ticket on sale for $49 and has indicated that it will close
its doors shortly.</TE>

<HD>The Confusion of 'Dr. Chi!'</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVID C. NICHOLS</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Cineastes and cynics may well be intrigued by "Dr. Chi!," concluding
its premiere engagement this weekend at Highways Performance Space.
Students of performance art should consider it educational, both as
periodic display table of the form's elements and textbook example of
its liabilities.</LD>
<LD>   Interdisciplinary artist Michael Sakamoto wears even more hats
than usual: writer, director, choreographer, performer, visual
artist, and so on. These multiple chapeaus tilt toward simultaneous
homage and deconstruction, focusing on the title archvillain.</LD>
<LD>   This Expressionistic antihero transcends era. From Weimar to early
U.S. talkies, taking in the Berlin Wall and the French New Wave, Dr.
Chi's blend of golem and Dr. Mabuse just keeps regenerating. That
both the icon and his history are fabricated in this blend of butoh,
B-movie parody, sociology and neurasthenia suggests why the program
notes are more coherent than the onstage proceedings.</LD>
<TE>   These transpire in a stark black-box setting dominated by a center
stage projection screen/entrance, initially displaying German titles
of an imagined Chi excursion, "Architect of Fear." Then,
frieze-framed in lighting designer Jeff Cain's evocative effects,
evil henchpeople appear: butch femme fatale Helga (the valiantly
mimetic Jill Miller), whip-wielding Meister Ming (Sakamoto), and
Brunhilde (the extravagant Franc Baliton), an ambisexual morph of
Peter Lorre and Gale Sondergaard.</TE>
<TE>   The arrival of Dr. Chi (the expertly stylized Michael Morrissey)
moves things from bizarre to Bizarro, with a Fritz Lang-issue mayor
(the game Robert Berg) and a scent-spritzing scientist (Rochelle
Fabb, appealingly inane) completing the ensemble. Relying heavily on
pidgin-German and the real thing, the bewildering trajectory
culminates with a gonzo brain-transferal sequence.</TE>
<TE>   More ersatz credits segue into a '60s Cold War goof dubbed "The
Forsaken." Sakamoto is now the resurrected Chi, and everyone shifts
archetypes accordingly. Here faux-Gallic dialogue and oblique
plotting generate some laughs and still more perplexity.</TE>
<TE>   The final installment finds Sakamoto, now resembling a
Haight-Ashbury record store clerk, in a pas de deux with Miller, and
the rest of the cast joining in a symbolist tableau vivant. This
kinetically arresting, thematically baffling sequence attempts to
pull the strands together around the Liebestod from "Tristan and
Isolde."</TE>
<TE>   The work never jells, plagued by severe discrepancies of tempo and
articulation, with far too much foreign language text. Unquestionably
respectable in intent, ultimately "Dr. Chi!" is a mosaic comprising
too many ambitious pieces and not enough epoxy.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   "Dr. Chi!," Highways Performance Space, 1651 18th St., Santa
Monica. Saturday-Sunday, 8:30 p.m. Ends Sunday. $13-$15. (310)

<HD>Stars Salvage ABT's 'Corsaire'</HD>
<DH>Expertise triumphs over technique in a lackluster American
Ballet Theatre production of Petipa's hoary 'Le Corsaire.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LEWIS SEGAL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Onstage at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion, a passel of international
ballet stars gathered Thursday for an exchange of views on how
classical style and, particularly, technique can most excite a
contemporary audience.</LD>
<LD>   Here was Angel Corella virtually screwing himself into the floor
with multiple turns of incredible speed and heat. Here, too, was Jose
Manuel Carreno flying through turns with spectacular buoyancy and
floating down to a nonchalant stretched-out landing.</LD>
<LD>   Gillian Murphy hopped on her pointes with toes of steel, Joaquin
De Luz flicked out his legs as if they were deadly rapiers. And Julio
Bocca kept reminding everyone of how much warmth, charm and a sense
of humor can add to virtuoso step combinations.</LD>
<TE>   But it remained for Nina Ananiashvili to reaffirm classical dance
as an idealized statement of human grace, balance and nobility--the
sense that something more essential than state-of-the-art athleticism
was at stake.</TE>
<TE>   Her contribution proved especially cherishable, for the evening
ostensibly represented an American Ballet Theatre performance of
Marius Petipa's antique three-act story ballet "Le Corsaire." This
19th century harem fantasy arrived at the Music Center with an
incoherent narrative, a patchwork score (five composers) and
extremely problematic views of women, slavery and Muslims.</TE>
<TE>   A far superior production by the Kirov Ballet (available on home
video) makes a persuasive case for "Le Corsaire" as a high-Romantic
dream of freedom in a corrupt world. However, the familiar 1998
Anna-Maria Holmes version for ABT simply pumps in as much showpiece
dancing as possible, tries to laugh off the rest and turns over the
irredeemably silly result to Corella, Carreno, Murphy, De Luz, Bocca
and Ananiashvili (the first cast in a five-performance engagement)
for salvage.</TE>
<TE>   As mentioned, these stars made the evening into a memorable
demonstration of the facets of expertise, and as long as artistic
director Kevin McKenzie can afford to import them, nobody will care
about anything else. Certainly they won't mind the wrinkled,
hand-me-down sets, the musical cliches that conductor David LaMarche
can't possibly redeem, and maybe they won't even notice what a
lackluster company ABT has become recently.</TE>
<TE>   Does it matter when the supposedly menacing pirates strike their
swords together as if they were swizzle sticks, or when a corps of
dancing flowers nearly gets tangled in its garland-hoops? Not when De
Luz or Bocca fronts the pirates and Murphy or Ananiashvili leads the
floral display.</TE>
<TE>   Who needs a world-class production of "Le Corsaire" or (to mention
other ABT mediocrities) "Don Quixote," "The Nutcracker," "Swan Lake"
and "The Sleeping Beauty" when the paragons of the art will make
artistic direction, choreography and subsidiary performances largely
irrelevant?</TE>
<TE>   For instance, company coaching currently imposes an exaggerated
clipped attack on the "Corsaire" Odalisques (the major non-stellar
soloists in the work), as if stylistic authority for Maria Riccetto,
Stella Abrera and Michele Wiles simply consisted of the sharpest
possible pointe-work and heads thrown back with maximum force.</TE>
<TE>   That's why it's so easy to love Carreno, Ananiashvili and Bocca.
They've all won their share of gold medals, but they refuse to be
reduced to mere technique machines in a production that asks nothing
else of them.</TE>
<TE>   Above all, they're so comfortable and centered in their bodies, so
resolutely undriven and unclipped in the most challenging bravura
passages that their performances add up to infinitely more than the
sum of their steps. And that "more" is where athleticism becomes art.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>

principal dancers, today at 2 and 8 p.m.; Sunday at 2 p.m. Dorothy
Chandler Pavilion, 135 N. Grand Ave., downtown L.A. $20 to $90. (213)

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Montagues and Capulets as rival record companies, presumably in
contemporary Hollywood?</LD>
<LD>   That's the initial concept behind Dani Bedau's staging of "Romeo
and Juliet" for Shakespeare Festival/LA. But the concept fizzles
after only about half an hour.</LD>
<LD>   During the first few minutes, the snazzily dressed characters
appear to be gathering for one of pop music's many awards ceremonies
when trouble breaks out between the two labels.</LD>
<TE>   A few minutes later, at the Capulets' party, young Paris (DeSean
Terry) and two backup dancers perform a musical interlude that might
qualify for MTV. Indeed, seldom has this play offered a more
charismatic Paris, who's usually the bland also-ran that Juliet's
parents are foisting on her, as opposed to her chosen Romeo.</TE>
<TE>   That a teenage girl would reject such a flashy suitor as this
Paris seems unlikely and places a greater burden than usual on
convincing us that the title characters feel an instant chemistry,
which isn't all that apparent here.</TE>
<TE>   Nor does it help the cause of credibility that Juliet first
appears in a deliberately boyish outfit. She looks like the kind of
skeptical girl who would be a fan of the hip cartoon series "Daria,"
not one who would fall head-over-heels for a guy based on a brief
encounter at a party or plot to secretly get married. Careena Melia
is forced to make a sudden and implausible transformation into a more
conventional Juliet.</TE>
<TE>   Maulik Pancholy's Romeo looks and sounds, in his vocal timbre,
like one of the youngest members of his crowd instead of one of the
most mature. So it's hard to buy that he, too, is ready for
matrimony.</TE>
<TE>   This gets to the heart of the problem with the concept: A
contemporary pop mogul might be less inclined to make sure his
teenage offspring marry than to make sure they use condoms.</TE>
<TE>   Although most of the specific references to the concept gradually
disappear, remnants remain. The costumes and a rock soundtrack from
the band Lava Diva are unobjectionable. But a few of the scenic
elements look increasingly out of place.</TE>
<TE>   On the morning when the unconscious Juliet is discovered in her
bed and judged dead, a lighting pattern of red zigzags--appropriate
enough in the first few festive scenes--and lingers on the backdrop.</TE>
<TE>   And in the final scene at the crypt, a chain of blue and yellow
lights still crosses the stage, as if we're in a nightclub. A boldly
styled tepee-like object, used mainly as Juliet's bedroom, remains
obtrusively on stage during other scenes.</TE>
<TE>   A few of the performances overcome the conceptual problems,
especially that of an ebullient J. Karen Thomas as a young
no-nonsense nurse. But the obstacles aren't only conceptual.</TE>
<TE>   The alfresco Pershing Square venue is built in a way that
dissipates much of the energy generated on stage. The gap between
stage and audience is too wide, and the lack of any rake in the
audience seating flings the spectators across a wide, flat expanse
that makes the action even more remote, especially with the
surrounding skyscrapers already dwarfing the stage.</TE>
<TE>   The board of Shakespeare Festival/LA should be considering ways to
obtain audience seating that heightens the intensity and intimacy of
the action.</TE>
<TE>   "Romeo and Juliet," Pershing Square, 532 S. Olive St., L.A.,
nightly at 8, except Monday, through July 20. Free with a donation of
canned food. Also, at South Coast Botanic Garden, 26300 Crenshaw

<HD>She Finds Her Secret Self Up on the Big Screen</HD>
<DH>Film* Michelle Williams moves beyond the bad girl on
'Dawson's Creek' to a part that taps her inner life in 'Me Without
You.'</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SUSAN KING</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Dawson's Creek" star Michelle Williams is a self-proclaimed
bookworm, always curled up with something to read.</LD>
<LD>   "Certainly on the set there are many times where she will be off
to the side curled up reading a book," says Paul Stupin, executive
producer of the WB's teen-angst drama. While making the British
feature "Me Without You," which opened Friday, Williams spent her
downtime on the set reading the esoteric Marcel Proust.</LD>
<LD>   Now 21 and entering her final year this fall on "Dawson's Creek,"
Williams feels for the first time as if she needs to expand her
intellectual horizons. "I feel like I am running up against a wall in
my mental development because there is no discourse available for
me," says the serious-minded actress who is light-years removed from
her "bad girl" character of Jen on "Dawson's Creek."</LD>
<TE>   "There is no back or forth, no challenge," Williams continues, her
words deliberate. "I process what I can from what I read, but nothing
more is demanded from me. So I have to figure out how to go beyond
what I am assimilating right now. I would love to take college
classes in New York, though not necessarily for a degree."</TE>
<TE>   Williams graduated from high school at 15, so by the time she
began "Dawson's," she had been out of school for a year. "I went to
freshman year at a regular school and then I did correspondence in
home and finished up three years in one year," she says during a
recent visit to L.A. Williams calls fellow "Dawson's" stars--James
Van Der Beek, Joshua Jackson and Katie Holmes--her "graduating
class."</TE>
<TE>   Williams has a lot in common with her character of Holly in "Me
Without You," directed by Sandra Goldbacher. When Williams read the
script, she felt Holly was her "secret me."</TE>
<TE>   A nominee for British film of the year, "Me Without You" explores
the close, almost suffocating bond between two girlfriends over three
decades in England. Williams' Holly feels unattractive and
constricted by her overprotective parents and so buries herself in
books to escape her home life. Her possessive best friend, Marina
(Anna Friel), hides her vulnerability under a veneer of sassiness and
promiscuity. Although the two girls share everything life has to
offer, Holly begins to feel that the friendship has turned into a
trap and she is forced to decide if her life would be better without
the self-destructive Marina.</TE>
<TE>   Goldbacher met with several American actresses for the role of
Holly. The director was open to having an American play the British
character in order to get financing for the independent feature but
also to secure the best actress. The film's casting director
suggested Williams to Goldbacher.</TE>
<TE>   "She was Holly," Goldbacher recalls when she first met Williams.
"Michelle just felt so right. She is a very, very clever woman and
articulate and very serious, and she completely understood the whole
idea of this twisted female friendship. She has a kind of intensity
about her."</TE>
<TE>   Although Marina comes across in the film as the destructive
partner in the friendship, Williams believes her character is just as
guilty. "She is just quiet about it," says Williams, sitting barefoot
and cross-legged in her hotel room. "Her silence hurts the
relationship just as much. She is just more subtle about it."</TE>
<TE>   The two women won't allow each other to change. "They both get
typecast in their roles very early on," Williams says. "They need
each other to be that certain way. Marina is bright and she does have
a facile mind, but she doesn't utilize it because no one has ever
allowed her to. The same could be true for Holly."</TE>
<TE>   Williams worked to perfect her British accent for the film,
utilizing a dialect coach on the "Dawson's Creek" set in Wilmington,
N.C., and on location in London. "There were specific inflections to
be placed in the accent according to where the girls grew up, where
their parents had grown up and where the girls had gone to school,"
Williams says.</TE>
<TE>   She also stayed in accent off the set. "It was just easier to do
it the next morning on the set and easier to assimilate into the
culture," Williams says. "It may sound sort of pretentious to stay in
accent the whole time, but I was building relationships with new
people and I had never done a British accent before."</TE>
<TE>   As soon as Williams arrived in England, Goldbacher had the actress
and Friel do improvisational exercises at her house. "From the moment
they met, they started in character," the director says. "They
started improvising like 12-year-olds in character and sort of built
that up, and then they went out in the street as English 16-year-olds
to shop and stuff. [Williams] was very brave about it. She entered
into it with a great spirit."</TE>
<TE>   "It helped me not be afraid because I had no choice but to follow
and jump right in," Williams says. "There was no room for me to ask,
'Is this going to be OK?' I just had to be."</TE>
<TE>   Williams simultaneously was filming "Dawson's" and "Me Without
You" in the fall of 2000. "The hardest thing going back and forth
from England to North Carolina is that a Southern accent and a
British accent aren't so far apart," she says. "I would go back to
North Carolina in the midst of all of these Southern accents and I'd
come back and my British would be tweaked. There would be a slow
drawl coming out in my British accent. That was difficult."</TE>
<TE>   Williams is using a slightly different British accent for her role
as a neurotic young woman on the verge of a nervous breakdown in the
off-Broadway production of Mike Leigh's play "Smelling a Rat." The
actress made her New York stage debut two years ago off-Broadway in
"Killer Joe."</TE>
<TE>   "I don't have the training or the credentials to be on stage," she
says modestly. "But I do enjoy it and I am totally willing to serve
my apprenticeship and work for it."</TE>
<TE>   Filming on "Dawson's Creek" begins early next month. "I don't know
what's going to happen next to my character," she says of Jen, who
deflowered Dawson last season. "She's sort of mellowed out in her old
age a bit."</TE>
<TE>   "It seems no matter what we throw at her, she is able to make it
real and believable and vulnerable," executive producer Stupin says.
"I think there is really no limit to her versatility."</TE>
<TE>   Although Williams has no set career plans after "Dawson's," she
knows she wants to keep growing as an actress. "But I think it's a
mistake to take projects just for that intention or just to shock
people," she says. "You attract what you are ready for. I am finding
that to be true. The projects I have come across recently have been
there for a reason. It's all about timing. The last three years, I
have felt pretty good about what I was doing."</TE>

<LD>Spending two hours with a door-to-door salesman wasn't initially my
idea of a good time, but that was before being introduced to
pavement-pounder extraordinaire Bill Porter. And it's his unusual
story, told unusually well, that unfolds with a relaxed grace in
Sunday night's fine made-for-TNT movie, "Door to Door" (8 p.m.).</LD>
<LD>   The wondrous William H. Macy ("Fargo," "Magnolia") plays Porter, a
real-life door-to-door salesman from Oregon who just happens to have
been born with cerebral palsy.</LD>
<LD>   But if you suspect this to be merely another disease-of-the-week
flick with a beat-the-odds heart, you'd be selling it short.</LD>
<TE>   Director Steven Schachter, who co-wrote the film with Macy, wisely
pulls back to give us a wider perspective on this life of a salesman.
In addition to scenes with Porter's sparse inner circle, we get to
know a handful of the customers on his route and how their lives are
subtly changed through the years by their contact with him.</TE>
<TE>   Of course, having some world-class supporting players doesn't
hurt. Helen Mirren ("Gosford Park") has some wonderful moments as
Porter's mother and chief motivational guru, as does Kathy Baker in
the role of a lonely alcoholic who is Porter's best customer but
maybe yearns to be something more.</TE>
<TE>   Kyra Sedgwick ("Something to Talk About") is also first-rate as
Porter's assistant, friend and fleeting object of his own
something-more yearnings.</TE>
<TE>   But it's Macy who anchors the movie, which calls upon him to age
more than 40 years. With his twisted gait and strangled speech, we
feel every painful, single-minded step Porter took on the way to
becoming one of his sundry company's top salesmen.</TE>
<TE>   As for the real Porter, he's 69 and still selling, now via the
Internet. This movie ought to be good for business.</TE>

<HD>Will 'Perdition' Take Slow Road to the Oscars?</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBERT W. WELKOS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It's dark. It's violent. It's character-driven. And it has Oscar
possibilities galore.</LD>
<LD>   On many levels, "Road to Perdition," starring Tom Hanks playing
against type as a mob hit man seeking revenge for the slaughter of
his family, is the kind of movie Hollywood studios like to release in
the fall, when kids are back in school and adult moviegoers are eager
for something of substance to watch.</LD>
<LD>   Yet DreamWorks is rolling out the gritty drama at the height of
the summer popcorn season, when convention holds that audiences are
interested only in broad comedies that require low brain wattage, a
la "Scooby-Doo" and "Mr. Deeds," or edge-of-your-seat sci-fi and
action fare like "Minority Report" and "Men in Black II."</LD>
<TE>   "It's something we put a lot of thought into," said Richard D.
Zanuck, who produced "Road to Perdition" with his son, Dean, and
director Sam Mendes. "We all spun it around for some time months and
months ago and became convinced that this would be a big time.
There's a point in the summer where audiences would have run their
course with popcorn pictures."</TE>
<TE>   So the filmmakers and DreamWorks decided to forgo an opening
during the year-end holiday season, when prestige dramas usually vie
for Academy Award attention. Instead, they're taking a path the
studio followed with another R-rated Hanks film, "Saving Private
Ryan," which debuted in July 1998.</TE>
<TE>   With the movie being released on only about 1,800 screens, Zanuck
isn't expecting "Road to Perdition" to be No. 1 at the box office
this weekend, but he does hope the movie can build on critics'
reviews and word of mouth and ride the wave through the summer.</TE>
<TE>   "Most dramas historically play well in 1,600 to 1,800 runs," said
DreamWorks distribution chief Jim Tharp. "Certainly with Tom Hanks
you can add to that, but we think word of mouth will be good on the
movie, and we will expand to smaller markets as word gets out."</TE>
<TE>   Throughout the country, critics were generally impressed. While
many, like The Times' film critic Kenneth Turan, hailed the film,
especially its cinematography and stylish Depression-era production
design, others found the movie difficult to embrace.</TE>
<TE>   The New Yorker's David Denby called it "perhaps the most
thoroughly stylized gangster picture since the Coen brothers'
'Miller's Crossing,' " but judged by the standard of "The Godfather"
or even "Bugsy," the film is "a stilted, self-conscious piece of
work--a case of dark-toned academic classicism."</TE>
<TE>   Zanuck conceded that Sony's sci-fi sequel "Men in Black II," which
had a record July 4 holiday opening last weekend ($52.1 million from
Friday through Sunday), will remain a potent box-office force this
weekend, even if ticket sales fall 50%.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not about numbers for us as much as longevity and getting
the word out," he said. "The Oscars is the last thing on our minds,
but it would be a wonderful bonus."</TE>
<TE>   To be sure, Oscar voters, no matter what time of year, will
certainly sit up and take notice of any film featuring Hanks, a
two-time Academy Award winner for best actor, and co-starring screen
legend Paul Newman, himself a previous best actor Oscar winner. But
it's still a roll of the dice.</TE>
<TE>   "Conventional wisdom holds that summer movies don't do well [at
Academy Award time], that Oscar voters don't have long memories and
that you have to release your film in December," said Tom O'Neil,
author of "Movie Awards" and host of the awards Web site
goldderby.com.</TE>
<TE>   But O'Neil points out that "Gladiator," which DreamWorks released
in May 2000, and "Braveheart," released by Paramount Pictures in May
1995, each captured Oscars for best picture. And DreamWorks also
walked off with the Oscar for best picture with 1999's dark suburban
satire "American Beauty," Mendes' first film, which had a September
release.</TE>
<TE>   With "Road to Perdition," O'Neil said, "DreamWorks is gambling
that they can get out of the gate early, as they did with that other
Sam Mendes movie, 'American Beauty.'</TE>
<TE>   "When 'Saving Private Ryan' lost to 'Shakespeare in Love,'
DreamWorks executives were so miffed that they immediately scoured
their other projects and saw this movie ["American Beauty"] by a
rookie director [Mendes] that was on the shelf," he recalled. "They
said, 'Let's get behind this' and they actually began their Oscar
campaign in July, taking ads out in August, and then broke it out big
at the Toronto Film Festival in September."</TE>
<TE>   That success demonstrated that a critically acclaimed film,
nurtured with proper marketing and publicity, can gradually become a
box-office blockbuster while losing none of its luster with academy
voters months after its release.</TE>
<TE>   Though there were reports that DreamWorks had wanted to release
"Road to Perdition" last Christmas, Zanuck said "that was always a
misconception."</TE>
<TE>   "There was some idle talk, but we never did sign off on it," he
said. "Certainly Sam Mendes didn't sign off on it for the simple
reason that it wouldn't have been ready. Sam is a meticulous director
and likes to spend a lot of time, all very valuable, putting a
picture together. It was not something we wanted slapped together and
rushed out for a release date. Quite frankly, he was still tinkering
around with the picture six or seven weeks ago."</TE>
<TE>   Tharp said that by releasing the movie in July, the picture stands
virtually alone among its genre, which can be a plus.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not only crowded at the end of the year," Tharp said, noting
that from late September through the holidays, weekends will be
crammed with three or four studio releases, many in the same genre.</TE>
<TE>   Some year-end movies already garnering Oscar buzz include Martin
Scorsese's "Gangs of New York," Alexander Payne's "About Schmidt,"
Stephen Daldry's "The Hours," Paul Thomas Anderson's "Punch-Drunk
Love" and Rob Marshall's musical "Chicago."</TE>
<TE>   "So we think we have a really good adult drama to be released in
July, and maybe we're the only movie that appeals to that audience,"
Tharp said. "In the fall, you may have one or two of those movies
coming out every weekend."</TE>
<TE>   Like "The Godfather" of three decades past, "Road to Perdition"
combines violence, atmosphere, character and locale to paint a
celluloid canvas of family devotion and destruction set against the
backdrop of the Mafia.</TE>
<TE>   Audiences will see Hanks as they've never seen him: a mob hit man
who mows people down with a tommy gun, nearly rivals Pretty Boy Floyd
as a bank robber and plots revenge against whoever killed his wife
and one of his sons. Yet he also is a caring, if taciturn, family man
trying to give his children some semblance of a normal life even
while keeping his weapons locked up and hidden.</TE>
<TE>   Newman plays the patriarch of an Irish mob family, whose loyalties
are tested by his surrogate son, Hanks, and his real son, a truly bad
apple played by Daniel Craig.</TE>
<TE>   After vowing to take his revenge, Hanks' character takes his
surviving son and heads to the town of Perdition, where he hopes to
hide his boy with a relative. But pursuing them is Jude Law, who
plays a press photographer moonlighting as a hit man.</TE>
<TE>   Tom Sherak, the former distribution chief at 20th Century Fox,
said summer absolutely is the right time for a movie like "Road to
Perdition."</TE>
<TE>   "I can't wait to see it," Sherak said. "What am I going to see? I
saw 'Minority Report.' I saw 'Men in Black II.' Now I want an adult
movie. I want something I can think my way through. I want something
that is not just popcorn. I need that. I'm a moviegoer."</TE>
<TE>   Sherak said that Oscar voters have longer memories than people
think, recalling that "The Silence of the Lambs" opened in February
1991 and won best picture.</TE>
<TE>   "As a studio, you have to believe in what you have," he said. "If
DreamWorks wants to bring back 'Road to Perdition' at the end of the
year, they can. There are a lot of things they can do. If Tom Hanks
or Paul Newman is in a movie, you think I'm going to forget about
that when I go to vote?"</TE>
<TE>   "Hanks is such a proven box-office draw that he is the insurance
policy DreamWorks has," O'Neil said. "This may be a dark, esoteric,
Oscar-caliber movie, but it also has the box-office attraction of Tom
Hanks."</TE>

<HD>Amgen Is Cleared to Buy Immunex</HD>
<DH>Pharmaceuticals: Regulators OK the $9.6-billion takeover
after the firms address antitrust concerns.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Amgen Inc., the world's largest biotechnology company, won U.S.
antitrust clearance Friday to complete its $9.6-billion purchase of
Immunex Corp., maker of a leading rheumatoid arthritis drug.</LD>
<LD>   Amgen and Immunex received Federal Trade Commission approval for
the takeover after the companies agreed to grant patent licenses to
allow development of two rival anti-arthritis drugs to address FTC
concerns that the acquisition would hurt competition and lead to
higher drug prices.</LD>
<LD>   The two companies previously agreed to sell Immunex's Leukine
infection-fighting drug to Schering.</LD>
<TE>   As part of the purchase, Amgen will receive Immunex's Enbrel, a
rheumatoid arthritis drug it predicts will have sales of at least $3
billion. Amgen will market Enbrel along with its own arthritis
medication, Kineret.</TE>
<TE>   The FTC said Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc. received a license
from Amgen and Immunex to use a patent for developing a rheumatoid
arthritis drug to combat the same inflammation-causing protein as
Amgen's Kineret treatment.</TE>
<TE>   The companies also agreed to grant another patent license to
develop a drug that blocks TNF, or tumor necrosis factor, the FTC
said. Enbrel also targets TNF, the immune system protein linked to
inflammation and tissue destruction.</TE>
<TE>   Amgen, based in Thousand Oaks, said in December that it would pay
0.44 share of Amgen plus $4.50 in cash for each share of Immunex,
based in Seattle.</TE>
<TE>   Immunex introduced Enbrel in 1998, and the drug's quick acceptance
in the market forced the company to begin building a new production
plant in Rhode Island to alleviate shortages. Amgen says it expects
to begin production there in January, several months after the date
first projected by Immunex.</TE>
<TE>   Wyeth Inc., which markets Enbrel, owns 40% of Immunex and will own
10% of the combined company, according to Hoover's Inc.</TE>
<TE>   Shares of Amgen, which have dropped 42% since it announced the
Immunex takeover Dec. 17, fell 11 cents to $34.30 Friday on Nasdaq.</TE>
<TE>   Immunex shares, which have dropped 33% during the same period,
rose 5 cents to $19.55, also on Nasdaq.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Anschutz Entertainment Group subsidiaries that run Staples Center and
the Forum on Friday terminated the venues' exclusive concert booker,
Nederlander, and sued the firm for breach of contract for allegedly
failing to keep up on guaranteed payments.</LD>
<LD>   The Anschutz firms are seeking about $500,000 in overdue payments
and an estimated $5 million that would have come due before the
contract expired in 2004.</LD>
<LD>   Barry Mallen, an attorney for the Anschutz companies, said, "We
really have not been given a good reason" for the lack of payments.
"We'll get excuses and delays."</LD>
<TE>   Nederlander attorney Adam Burke said Anschutz's organization,
which includes a concert division, had interfered with Nederlander's
deals with artists and undermined its ability to make the payments
due under the contract.</TE>

<HD>Fired Broker Sues CSFB, Quattrone</HD>

<SE></SE>

<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Credit Suisse First Boston and Frank Quattrone, the head of its
technology group, were sued by a brokerage executive who claimed he
was made a scapegoat in a probe of how the firm handled initial
public offerings.</LD>
<LD>   John Schmidt, who had been head of private client operations at
the firm's San Francisco office, said in a lawsuit that he was
penalized by Credit Suisse for methods of allocating IPOs that were
common throughout the firm. Quattrone deflected blame to him and two
other brokers who were fired, Schmidt said.</LD>
<LD>   Credit Suisse in December agreed to pay $100 million to settle
regulatory charges that it allotted sought-after shares of IPOs in
exchange for investor kickbacks in the form of higher commissions.
Firing Schmidt was part of a strategy to blame a "rogue operator" for
any wrongdoing, the suit claimed.</LD>
<TE>   "CSFB dealt Schmidt the same contemptuous, unethical and illegal
hand it dealt its customers and clients," said the suit, which was
filed in state court in San Francisco and seeks unspecified damages
for defamation, breach of contract and wrongful discharge.</TE>
<TE>   "We believe the allegations have no merit and intend to defend
ourselves vigorously against them," Victoria Harmon, a spokeswoman
for Credit Suisse, said. Quattrone couldn't be reached for comment.</TE>
<TE>   Schmidt is represented by Thomas Girardi, founding partner of Los
Angeles-based law firm Girardi &amp; Keese.</TE>
<TE>   Girardi declined to comment beyond the lawsuit.</TE>
<TE>   Schmidt, who was head of private client services in San Francisco,
was fired in June 2001, along with Michael Grunwald, the top salesman
under Schmidt, and Scott Bushley, a junior-level employee.</TE>

<HD>Retail Sales Increase Is Stronger Than Expected</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEANNINE AVERSA</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Energized by warm weather and favorable incentives, shoppers splurged
on cars, clothes and appliances last month, boosting retail sales by
1.1%.</LD>
<LD>   With consumers playing a key role in the shape of the economic
recovery, the Commerce Department's stronger-than-expected sales
figures for June offered a dose of good news Friday.</LD>
<LD>   But economists worry that the accounting scandals that have shaken
confidence in corporate America, the sour stock market and a sluggish
job market could chill consumers' willingness to spend in the months
ahead, further slowing the economic recovery.</LD>
<TE>   The recovery has lost momentum from the beginning of the year.</TE>
<TE>   Business, whose profits took a hit during last year's recession,
continues to be reluctant to invest in equipment and hire new
employees, necessary ingredients for restoring the economy to robust
health.</TE>
<TE>   "It's clear that corporations have not been able to accept the
baton from consumers to continue the expansion relay," said Carl
Tannenbaum, chief economist at LaSalle Bank. "Consumers are being
relied on more and more to extend their support for the recovery. But
I wonder how long they can do that."</TE>
<TE>   A preliminary report Friday from the University of Michigan fanned
those concerns, Tannenbaum said. The report's preliminary index of
consumer sentiment sank to 86.5 in July, down from 92.4 in June and
the lowest level since November 2001.</TE>
<TE>   However, skittishness about the economy didn't stop consumers from
hitting the malls and auto dealers in June. Some economists said
shoppers couldn't resist good deals offered by companies to bolster
lackluster sales.</TE>
<TE>   Excluding cars, overall retail sales rose by 0.4% in June--largely
in line with analysts' expectations.</TE>
<TE>   Unlike some of his colleagues, economist Richard Yamarone of Argus
Research Corp. said he was confident that consumers will continue to
power the recovery. "If consumers were so worried, they would not
have spent at such elevated levels," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Consumers took a breather in May and sent retail sales down by
1.1%. But in June, more aggressive incentives helped bring Americans
back to automobile showrooms, pushing up sales by 3.4%. That was the
largest increase since October, when car sales shot up by a record
22.6%.</TE>

<HD>Guess Seeks U.S. Help on Mexico Thefts</HD>
<DH>Trade: The company wants pressure applied to protect its
clothing from hijackers en route to the U.S.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL>MEXICO CITY</DL>
<LD>Guess Inc. said it has asked the U.S. to pressure the Mexican
government to protect its designer jeans and T-shirts from highway
robberies in Mexico as they're being trucked to the U.S.</LD>
<LD>   "The company is concerned about the hijackings and has
communicated its concern to U.S. Ambassador Jeffrey Davidow," Guess
spokeswoman Wendi Kopsick said. Embassy spokeswoman Cherie Feeley
declined to comment.</LD>
<LD>   The Los Angeles-based company might turn to Central American and
Asian suppliers unless measures are taken to prevent future robberies
of shipments of the designer clothing en route to the U.S., the
Reforma newspaper reported Thursday, citing a company security
official. Guess executives declined to be interviewed by Bloomberg
News.</LD>
<TE>   Foreign companies such as Japanese electronics makers Canon Inc.
and Casio Computer Co. are shutting their Mexican factories and
moving operations to Vietnam and China after salaries in Latin
America's largest economy outpaced the rate of inflation for the last
three years, reducing the availability of low-cost labor that once
made Mexico an attractive place for manufacturers to invest.</TE>
<TE>   Guess last week lost a shipment of 20,330 pairs of jeans, worth
about $265,200, to hijackers in Mexico state, Reforma reported,
citing an administrator at the factory where the jeans were made.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a significant amount of money for a company that is
already losing money this quarter," said Margaret Whitfield, a retail
analyst at Brean Murray Securities Inc. in New York, who has a
"strong buy" recommendation on Guess stock. "I could see why they
might think of voiding these contracts."</TE>
<TE>   It was the fourth time in three years that Guess--which said last
week that it had a bigger-than-forecast loss in its second quarter
because of lower sales and higher expenses--lost merchandise en route
to the U.S. from its 20 Mexican suppliers, Reforma said. The stolen
clothes often are sold by black-market vendors.</TE>

<HD>Breast Implant Data Sought</HD>
<DH>Safety: A House panel asks the FDA to turn over documents
about studies presented by two manufacturers.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A House panel is investigating the safety and effectiveness of breast
implants made by Mentor Corp. and Inamed Corp.</LD>
<LD>   The committee asked the Food and Drug Administration to turn over
documents about studies presented by the companies at a Tuesday
meeting.</LD>
<LD>   Both Mentor and Inamed are based in Santa Barbara.</LD>
<TE>   The studies showed that more than 25% of women who receive saline
implants to increase the size of their breasts will undergo another
breast operation within five years, House Energy and Commerce
Committee Chairman W. J. "Billy" Tauzin (R-La.) wrote in a letter to
FDA Deputy Commissioner Lester Crawford.</TE>
<TE>   Many of the women needed additional surgery to correct problems,
including leaking, wrinkling and deflation of the implants, the
letter said.</TE>
<TE>   Tauzin also wants an update of the FDA's criminal investigation of
Mentor's safety studies on the implants, which was first disclosed
two years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Tauzin asked for all FDA records relating to Mentor since Jan. 1,
2001. Lawmakers want the documents by July 25.</TE>
<TE>   The legislators' letter cited a Washington Post article reporting
that some members of the FDA advisory panel expressed serious
concerns about the results and the nature of the studies presented at
this week's meeting.</TE>
<TE>   Peter Nicholson, a spokesman for Inamed, disputed the paper's
account and said the advisory panel's members were "very
complimentary" of the information Inamed presented.</TE>
<TE>   "We would cooperate with any request from FDA or Congress,"
Nicholson said. "We have a strong commitment to conducting clinical
work at the highest ethical level."</TE>
<TE>   Mentor said the data presented by both companies Tuesday were
consistent with data previously released and confirm the safety and
efficacy of saline implants.</TE>
<TE>   Chief Executive Christopher Conway also said Mentor has been
cooperating with the FDA investigation that began several years ago,
but the company has not been able to find out what the investigation
is about.</TE>
<TE>   On Nasdaq, Mentor fell $7.83 to $26.95 and Inamed fell $3.64 to
$13.56.</TE>

<HD>Big Board May Delist Key3 Shares</HD>
<DH>Securities: The NYSE's warning was expected after the trade
show producer's stock fell below $1 last month.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JON HEALEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The New York Stock Exchange has warned Key3Media Group Inc., a
leading producer of technology trade shows, that it may delist the
company's shares unless the price climbs back above $1.</LD>
<LD>   The Los Angeles-based company announced the warning Friday. The
move was expected because Key3's shares closed below the crucial $1
threshold June 4 and have remained there since.</LD>
<LD>   Under the rules of the exchange, companies have to maintain a
certain level of financial performance to continue being listed for
trading. One rule is that the stock not fall below $1 for an extended
period.</LD>
<TE>   Key3 owns several of the top brands in the technology trade-show
business, including Comdex for information technology companies,
Network+Interop for computer networks and Seybold for electronic
publishers.</TE>
<TE>   But its sales, earnings per share and stock price have fallen
sharply since mid-2001, a decline that company Chairman Fredric D.
Rosen has blamed on the slumping tech economy.</TE>
<TE>   The stock, which sold for more than $10 a share a year ago,
plunged in September and again in May, when Key3 announced
disappointing results for the first quarter. Its shares closed Friday
at 26 cents, down 1 cent in light trading.</TE>
<TE>   Ned Goldstein, the company's general counsel, said the exchange
notified Key3 of the potential delisting earlier this week. The
company was given 10 days to present a plan for raising its stock
price.</TE>
<TE>   Key3 has six months to come back into compliance, but the exchange
could take action sooner if the stock continues trading at its
current level. To avoid being dropped, Goldstein said, Key3 must
raise its average stock price to $1 or more for 30 straight days at
the end of the six-month period.</TE>
<TE>   Company executives offered no details on how they planned to
respond. "We are reviewing our options," Goldstein said.</TE>

<HD>Qwest Considers Restating 2001 Results</HD>
<DH>Telecom: Such an action reportedly could reduce revenue by
more than $1billion. Company declines to comment.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>DENVER</DL>
<LD>Qwest Communications International Inc. is considering restating its
2001 financial results, which could reduce revenue by more than $1
billion, according to the Wall Street Journal.</LD>
<LD>   Richard Notebaert, Qwest's new chairman and chief executive,
hasn't made a final decision yet, the newspaper reported on its Web
site Friday.</LD>
<LD>   Analysts believe a restatement is likely, the Journal reported.</LD>
<TE>   A spokesman for the Denver-based phone company declined to comment
on the report.</TE>
<TE>   "Right now we're not in a position to discuss the speculation,"
said Steve Hammack.</TE>
<TE>   He cited the "quiet period" required just before release of the
company's quarterly results.</TE>
<TE>   Federal regulators are investigating Qwest's accounting practices.
The U.S. attorney's office in Denver also has begun a criminal
investigation of Qwest.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors haven't revealed the nature of the inquiry.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to the investigations, Qwest has seen its debt balloon
to $26 billion, its long-term credit rating drop from investment
grade to "junk," and its stock price plummet.</TE>
<TE>   To boost revenue, the company solicited bids for its Qwest Dex
phone directory and wireless businesses, which Qwest values at more
than $10 billion. Friday was the deadline for bids, but company
officials declined to disclose the number and size of bids offered.</TE>
<TE>   Qwest is the local phone company for 14 states extending from
Minnesota west to Washington and southwest to Arizona and New Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   The company on Friday filed an application with the Federal
Communications Commission to offer long-distance service in
Washington, Utah, Montana and Wyoming.</TE>
<TE>   Qwest shares closed up 6 cents at $1.93 on the New York Stock
Exchange.</TE>

<HD>Vivendi Execs Expected to Resign</HD>
<DH>Media: Sources say the firm's chief financial officer and
the leader of the U.S. division of its Internet business will depart.
Both have ties to ousted CEO.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD VERRIER and JON HEALEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Two Vivendi Universal executives, including the chief financial
officer, are expected to resign as the company's new leader begins
the inevitable process of ousting those aligned with fallen Chief
Executive Jean-Marie Messier, say sources familiar with the matter.</LD>
<LD>   Vivendi Universal Chief Financial Officer Guillaume Hannezo, one
of Messier's closest advisors, is set to step down in the coming
weeks, sources say.</LD>
<LD>   In a statement, Hannezo said he hasn't yet resigned, but signaled
a change was forthcoming. "It's normal for the new management of a
company to consider appointing a new financial director," the
statement said. "For the time being, the priority is to work to
restabilize the company's position."</LD>
<TE>   Hannezo joined Vivendi in 1997 and advised Messier as he arranged
a slew of acquisitions that puzzled investors and racked up huge
media debts, now totaling $19 billion. The high debt, confusion about
the company's complex balance sheet and disclosures of more than $1
billion in unexpected liabilities spooked investors and analysts,
causing a 70% fall in Vivendi's stock price. Its shares closed Friday
at $16.77, down 13 cents, on the New York Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   Vivendi's board last week replaced Messier with French businessman
Jean-Rene Fourtou.</TE>
<TE>   It's unclear whether Hannezo's pending departure is linked to an
investigation French regulators recently announced into Vivendi's
accounting. The investigation centers on whether Vivendi communicated
its liquidity crisis to investors in a timely fashion. Vivendi said
it is cooperating with the investigation and that it recently
obtained a roughly $1-billion loan from creditors to ease its cash
crunch.</TE>
<TE>   Robin Richards, head of the fledgling VUNet USA, also is expected
to resign next week, according to sources familiar with the matter.</TE>
<TE>   Richards is the former president of online music company MP3.com,
which Vivendi bought last year for $372 million. He also has close
ties to Messier, who hired him last year to head Vivendi's U.S.
Internet operations over the objections of some French board members,
who wanted all the Internet properties under French control.</TE>
<TE>   Richards was bitter enemies with Edgar Bronfman Jr., whose family
helped lead the coup against Messier, said a source close to the
company.</TE>
<TE>   VUNet, the U.S. arm of Vivendi's struggling Internet division, is
trying to build businesses around the online distribution of music,
video and games, a task complicated by rampant Internet piracy. Its
sites include MP3.com, Getmusic.com and Rollingstone.com as well as
gaming site Flipside.com.</TE>
<TE>   Richards' group, which this year bought a mobile entertainment
services company, has been working to forge ties with wireless
carriers.</TE>
<TE>   The group, created in October, has 500 employees in Los Angeles,
San Diego and New York.</TE>
<TE>   A VUNet spokesman declined to comment, as did Richards.</TE>

<HD>25 Banks File Suit Against WorldCom</HD>
<DH>Courts: The financial institutions are seeking to
immediately freeze $2.65 billion of the long-distance phone giant's
assets.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Wire Services</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>A group of 25 banks charged in a lawsuit filed Friday that WorldCom
Inc. defrauded them of nearly $2.5 billion six weeks before publicly
disclosing a $3.9-billion accounting cover-up.</LD>
<LD>   The banks' lawsuit, filed in State Supreme Court in Manhattan,
included a request for an order to immediately freeze $2.65 billion
of WorldCom assets. Justice Helen Freedman, after oral arguments,
denied the request and scheduled a hearing for Tuesday.</LD>
<LD>   In Washington, a spokesman for congressional investigators said
other WorldCom employees knew about the accounting irregularities at
the company and tried to identify the problems only to be rebuffed by
the company's then-chief financial officer.</LD>
<TE>   Documents supporting this conclusion were uncovered in the first
of five boxes of documents that WorldCom turned over to investigators
for the House Energy and Commerce Committee, said panel spokesman Ken
Johnson.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no question, absolutely none, that a number of middle-
management people at WorldCom had a very good idea that someone was
cooking the books," he said. "It's clear to us that they tried to get
to the bottom of it only to be rebuffed by [Chief Financial Officer]
Scott Sullivan."</TE>
<TE>   Johnson declined to provide further details. Sullivan's lawyer was
not immediately available for comment and a spokesman for WorldCom
declined to comment.</TE>
<TE>   The banks' suit against WorldCom may push the company closer to
making the largest bankruptcy filing in U.S. history. The lawsuit
also may be a sign that talks between WorldCom and its current
lenders for new loans have collapsed.</TE>
<TE>   The suit accuses WorldCom of making "false representations" when
it said on May 16 that it would draw the full $2.65 billion from a
revolving credit line. WorldCom announced the restatement of its
finances on June 25.</TE>
<TE>   WorldCom admitted that it had disguised $3.9 billion in expenses
as capital expenditures so that it would appear to be more
profitable. Court papers say Michael Salisbury, WorldCom's general
counsel, "stated that the fraud had been perpetrated at the highest
level of the company."</TE>
<TE>   The banks say they would not have permitted the loans had they
known of the company's true condition.</TE>
<TE>   A total of 27 banks were involved in the loan. The two banks that
didn't join the lawsuit are Citicorp's Citibank, which loaned $154
million, and J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co., which loaned $6 million. The 25
banks are seeking to have the money returned. The original loan was
for $2.65 billion, including $160 million owed to Citibank and J.P.
Morgan.</TE>
<TE>   WorldCom spokeswoman Julie Moore said the company had no comment
on the lawsuit.</TE>
<TE>   Bloomberg News was used in compiling this report.</TE>

<HD>GE Reports Profit Up 14% in 2nd Quarter</HD>
<DH>Conglomerates: Sales of gas turbines boost the company's
bottom line. Its executives back forecasts of earnings growth for the
full year.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>General Electric Co. said Friday that second-quarter earnings rose
14% as red-hot gas turbine sales carried the day, but reinsurance
losses and a write-down on WorldCom Inc. bonds nicked its profit.</LD>
<LD>   GE executives backed the conglomerate's full-year earnings
forecast, which analysts saw as a modestly positive sign that the
broader economy might perform better in the second half.</LD>
<LD>   The maker of products ranging from jet engines to light bulbs said
it earned $4.4 billion in the quarter, or 44 cents a diluted share,
compared with $3.9 billion, or 39 cents, a year earlier.</LD>
<TE>   The results matched analysts' estimates.</TE>
<TE>   GE's second-quarter revenue rose 4% to $33.2 billion. Revenue at
its power systems business, which shipped 109 gas turbines, surged
27%, to $6.5 billion, while profit there rose 66%.</TE>
<TE>   GE shares rose $1.25, or nearly 4.6%, to close at $28.60 on the
New York Stock Exchange.</TE>
<TE>   So far this year, the stock is off about 29%, under-performing the
Dow Jones industrial average and the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index.</TE>
<TE>   GE's power systems business--which includes gas turbines and
accounted for more than 40% of its quarterly profit--is expected to
cool in the second half, but GE is looking to plastics and NBC
television to pick up the slack.</TE>
<TE>   Third-quarter profit is expected to rise as much as 25% on an 8%
to 10% increase in revenue, GE said.</TE>
<TE>   Chief Executive Jeff Immelt said plastics, for which orders
increased 25% in the quarter, is GE's best leading indicator for the
economy.</TE>
<TE>   But Robert Friedman, an equity analyst at Standard &amp; Poor's Corp.,
said he is skeptical that GE will continue to post double-digit
earnings growth. "I see their rate of growth declining over time," he
said. "I don't see how you can keep growing earnings 10% to 15% with
a company this size."</TE>
<TE>   After stripping away a one-time favorable tax settlement and gains
from GE's pension plans, Friedman said, the conglomerate's
second-quarter earnings per share increased only 5.5%, compared with
GE's stated 13%.</TE>
<TE>   GE has not escaped the accounting concerns plaguing markets
worldwide as investors digest scandals at collapsed energy trader
Enron Corp. and telecom giant WorldCom.</TE>
<TE>   GE has defended its pension accounting in recent days, saying it
is proper and conservative. But analysts said concerns are weighing
on the company, whose market capitalization approaches $290 billion.</TE>

<HD>AOL Time Warner Seeks CEO for Its Internet Unit</HD>
<DH>Media: Move adds to uncertainty about the continued tenure
of COO Robert Pittman.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JAMES BATES</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Taking another step toward trying to reestablish credibility with
investors, AOL Time Warner Inc. confirmed Friday that it has hired an
executive search firm to find someone to run its ailing America
Online Internet division.</LD>
<LD>   The action comes amid growing speculation that the unit's
temporary head, AOL Time Warner Chief Operating Officer Robert W.
Pittman, may leave the company in a few weeks.</LD>
<LD>   Pittman has been especially criticized for inflating Wall Street's
financial expectations of the merger of America Online and media
giant Time Warner Inc. and for irritating executives in other units.</LD>
<TE>   To date, the deal has been a debacle for investors, with the
combined company's market value plunging more than $100 billion since
it closed in January 2001. Earlier this year, AOL Time Warner posted
a record $54-billion quarterly loss.</TE>
<TE>   Former Chief Executive Gerald M. Levin left under fire, replaced
by Richard D. Parsons, who has been visiting company units seeking to
ease concerns of employees. Earlier this week, Parsons visited the
Warner Bros. studio in Burbank.</TE>
<TE>   AOL Time Warner hired search firm Spencer Stuart to identify
candidates to run AOL, spokeswoman Tricia Primrose said. The search
is being overseen by AOL Time Warner executive Patricia Fili-Krushel,
former president of ABC Television Network as well as a former
Internet executive at WebMD.</TE>
<TE>   According to sources, the company wants a broad list of candidates
to supplement a list of internal ones led by Don Logan, who heads the
company's Time Inc. unit. Logan, 58, was hired in 1992 as president
of the magazine operation after building Southern Living magazine
into a success.</TE>
<TE>   Pittman has been temporarily running AOL, spending two days a week
at its Dulles, Va., headquarters. Pittman stepped into the job after
the unit's former chief executive, Barry Schuler, was bumped aside in
April amid sagging ad sales and diminished expectations of the
Internet company's ability to leverage former Time Warner
entertainment assets into profitable ventures.</TE>
<TE>   Early in the merger, Pittman ruffled feathers by trying to force
synergies on skeptical Time Warner executives. But Pittman still has
fans within the company, principally at the AOL unit and among
certain high-level executives such as Turner Broadcasting System
President Jamie Kellner. People close to AOL Time Warner Chairman
Steve Case say Case is supportive of Pittman and believes he is
essential to the top management team, but that Case recognizes that
Pittman is unpopular.</TE>
<TE>   At AOL's headquarters, some said the current speculation about
Pittman may be nothing more than wishful thinking or finger-pointing
by executives in other AOL Time Warner divisions, underscoring the
worsening relations between former Time Warner factions in New York
and AOL executives in Dulles.</TE>
<TE>   Executives in the entertainment units blame the Internet division
for dragging down the company's stock price, which has made worthless
many of the stock options executives were hoping would make them
wealthy.</TE>
<TE>   Some inside the company were skeptical that Pittman would leave,
but others said Parsons has been focusing less on developing synergy
between various divisions, which had been Pittman's primary role.</TE>
<TE>   Instead, Parsons now wants each stand-alone unit to focus on being
the best in its sector, leaving less work for Pittman.</TE>
<TE>   Division heads also may prefer to see the COO post eliminated
because it would give them more direct access to Parsons, rather than
reporting through Pittman.</TE>
<TE>   Primrose said the search should be no surprise, as it has been
clear from the outset that Pittman's reassignment was temporary and
that he would return to his post as chief operating officer of the
parent company. She said she was unaware of any change in that plan.</TE>
<TE>   "He has been and is COO, so that has not changed," Primrose said.</TE>
<TE>   Times staff writers Sallie Hofmeister, Edmund Sanders and Thomas
S. Mulligan contributed to this report.</TE>

<HD>Boeing Engineers Decertify Their Union</HD>
<DH>Labor: The vote shuts down the local, which represented
about 4,300 at Southland plants.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>NANCY CLEELAND</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a blow to organized labor, Boeing Co. engineers in Southern
California voted Friday to kick out their union after years of bitter
internal feuding.</LD>
<LD>   The decertification shuts down the small 56-year-old Southern
California Professional Engineering Assn., which represented about
4,300 engineers at Boeing facilities in Huntington Beach, Long Beach
and satellite locations.</LD>
<LD>   "The union is no longer in existence and the contract is void,"
said the union's chairman, B.T. Klein, an electrical engineer. "It's
disappointing. This is the end of an old and proud institution."</LD>
<TE>   National Labor Relations Board officials said the vote of 1,677 to
1,237 to decertify was one of the largest of its kind in decades. In
1998, more than 1,000 engineers at Lockheed-Martin Corp. in Palmdale
voted narrowly to decertify their union, the Engineers and Scientists
Guild.</TE>
<TE>   The loss is expected to hurt organized labor by undercutting its
argument that white-collar professionals can benefit from union
membership.</TE>
<TE>   Friday's ballot count at the labor relations board's offices in
Los Angeles capped an emotional two-year feud that began when
officers of the small SCPEA decided to affiliate with a larger
national union, hoping to gain resources and bargaining clout.</TE>
<TE>   After a search, two likely national unions emerged as candidates,
and both were eager to take on the job.</TE>
<TE>   But officers and members were split over the choice. In the end,
top officers went with the 140,000-member Office and Professional
Employees International Union, alienating backers of the rival union,
the Society of Professional Engineering Employees in Aerospace.</TE>
<TE>   That split spawned lawsuits, unfair labor practice charges,
competing Web sites, appeals to the AFL-CIO and, finally, the
decertification petition. Supporters of SPEEA were joined by
engineers who opposed any union and encouraged by Boeing management.</TE>
<TE>   "We had the perfect storm," said Kevin Kistler, OPEIU's organizing
director, who was recently named trustee for the local to try to
build support before the vote.</TE>
<TE>   Kistler said the union would review the results this weekend and
decide whether to file an objection to the balloting. If not, he
said, it would stay in touch with supporters and consider filing for
a new election in a year.</TE>
<TE>   "It's not a good day," he said, "but it's not the last day
either."</TE>
<TE>   Others said it was unlikely that Boeing engineers in Southern
California would ever again support a union. They noted that only
about one-fourth of the 4,300 engineers covered by the contract paid
union dues even in the best of times. Now, after two years of
bickering, that support would be even smaller.</TE>
<TE>   "What we saw here was a blatant subversion of the democratic
process," said Richard "Chip" Terracina, a SPEEA supporter who said
he tried to "work within the union system" but eventually filed the
decertification petition in frustration. "What we've always said is
they've got to listen to the will of the membership. They never did
that, and this is the outcome."</TE>
<TE>   Boeing chief counsel William Hartman was thrilled by the outcome.
He emphasized that the company was not actively involved in the
decertification process, saying that "we've always expressed a
preference to deal with our employees directly."</TE>
<TE>   The Southern California Professional Engineering Assn. was created
in 1945 by engineers at Douglas Aircraft Co., which through a merger
later became McDonnell Douglas. The company was acquired by Boeing in
1996.</TE>

<HD>State's Job Market Stuck in Neutral</HD>
<DH>Economy: Payrolls have increased by 3,600 jobs in six
months. Many firms are reluctant to hire as the recovery's strength
remains unclear.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MARLA DICKERSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>California's labor market continued to tread water in June, with the
unemployment rate continuing at 6.4% and companies reluctant to do
much hiring, according to data released Friday by the state
Employment Development Department.</LD>
<LD>   Through the first six months of the year, California payrolls have
increased by a mere 3,600 jobs, reflecting employers' skepticism
about the strength of the economic recovery.</LD>
<LD>   A separate report released Friday showed that consumers are having
doubts of their own. The University of Michigan index of consumer
confidence fell to 86.5 in July, down from 92.4 in June and 96.9 in
May.</LD>
<TE>   With few sectors beyond housing showing any real verve, economists
say the state's job market, like that of the nation's, probably will
remain sluggish for months to come.</TE>
<TE>   "The economy is just plain looking flat," said Ted Gibson, former
chief economist for the California Department of Finance. "We're
really not doing any better or worse than the rest of the nation.
We're just kind of sitting here."</TE>
<TE>   California's 6.4% June unemployment rate equaled that of May's,
which was revised upward from the 6.3% previously reported by state
officials. California has 29,000 fewer payroll jobs than it did a
year ago, and has seen its unemployment rate increase from 5.2% in
June 2001. Last month, the national unemployment rate was 5.9%
compared with 5.8% in May. A year ago, the U.S. jobless rate stood at
4.6%.</TE>
<TE>   Although Southern California's labor market remained among the
healthiest in the state, all the major counties reported increases in
joblessness in June. Orange County's June unemployment rate was 4%,
up from 3.7% in May. San Diego's June rate rose to 4.1% from 3.8% the
month before. Riverside and San Bernardino counties posted 5.7% in
June, up from 5.2% in May. June unemployment in Ventura County was
4.8% compared with 4.3% the prior month.</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles County remained the Southland's laggard. The county's
unemployment rate hit a five-year high of 7.1% in June, up from a
revised 7% in May, while its payrolls dropped by a net 800 job
positions in June, led by continued declines in manufacturing
employment.</TE>
<TE>   Still, the Bay Area continues to bear the brunt of last year's
economic slowdown. In Santa Clara County, the heart of Silicon
Valley, the June unemployment rate bounced back to 7.6% after easing
to 7.3% in May. In January 2001, that county's jobless rate stood at
1.7%.</TE>
<TE>   A collapse in technology spending helped send the national economy
into recession last year, and businesses still aren't buying
computers, software and other equipment at anywhere near the torrid
pace of a few years ago. Although the Bay Area is no longer
experiencing the steep job losses of last year, weak business
spending continues to be reflected in the region's unemployment
figures, said Michael Bernick, director of the state Employment
Development Department.</TE>
<TE>   "Those big tech investments aren't materializing," Bernick said.
"It's still having an impact."</TE>
<TE>   In June, California gained a net 4,400 nonfarm payroll jobs.
Revised May figures showed a loss of 12,300 jobs, 3,300 more than had
been previously reported.</TE>
<TE>   In June, losses in manufacturing, services and transportation and
public utilities were more than offset by gains in other sectors, led
by construction, retail trade and government.</TE>
<TE>   Government has been a particularly strong employer in California,
adding more than 62,000 payroll jobs over the last year, many of them
teachers and other municipal workers needed to serve a growing
population.</TE>
<TE>   But Gibson doubts the government sector can continue to be an
engine for growth, given California's budget woes.</TE>
<TE>   The latest figures show that personal income taxes for the month
of June were $219 million less than officials had been expecting.
Most of that gap was due to a decline in payroll withholding taxes,
which have been persistently weak all year.</TE>
<TE>   "That suggests to me that the labor market may be in a little
worse shape than the official data would indicate," Gibson said.</TE>
<TE>   The unemployment rate for Latinos in California was unchanged in
June at 7.4%, while the rate for blacks increased to 10.5% from 10.3%
in May. The jobless rate for whites was 5.8% in June, up from 5.6% in
May.</TE>
<TE>   San Luis Obispo County posted the lowest jobless rate of any
California county at 3.1%, while Imperial County recorded the highest
at 17.4%</TE>

<HD>Duke, El Paso Ordered to Turn Over Records</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Duke Energy Corp. and El Paso Corp. received subpoenas for trading
records Friday as authorities widened probes of sham transactions in
natural gas and power markets.</LD>
<LD>   The requests came from the U.S. attorney's office in Houston, as
part of a grand jury investigation, and from the Commodity Futures
Trading Commission, Duke said. Prosecutors previously have sought
trading records from Dynegy Inc., Reliant Energy Inc. and CMS Energy
Corp.</LD>
<LD>   Duke has acknowledged engaging in so-called round-trip trades,
which have no economic benefit.</LD>
<TE>   Shares of the utility fell $3.20, or 12%, to $24.75 on the New
York Stock Exchange, the biggest decline since October 1987.</TE>
<TE>   El Paso, operator of the largest U.S. natural-gas pipeline
network, disclosed its subpoena after the close of trading. The
company denied it had used round-trip trades to inflate volume or
revenue and said it hadn't used them to manipulate prices. El Paso
said it would cooperate with the investigation.</TE>
<TE>   El Paso shares closed 35 cents lower at $17.75 on the NYSE; they
fell as low as $16.70 after hours.</TE>

<HD>FleetBoston Decides to Close Robertson Stephens</HD>
<DH>Banking: Firm has been unable to find a buyer for its
tech-focused boutique investment house since putting it up for sale
in April.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>E. SCOTT RECKARD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Saying that no domestic or foreign buyer can be found for Robertson
Stephens Inc., FleetBoston Financial Corp. decided Friday to close
the boutique San Francisco investment bank, whose fortunes rose and
fell with the tech industry it helped finance.</LD>
<LD>   FleetBoston, the nation's seventh-largest bank, has been shedding
operations not central to its core consumer and commercial banking.
Since it put Robertson Stephens on the auction block in April,
several financial institutions in the United States and abroad have
backed away after expressing some initial interest, a bank spokesman
said.</LD>
<LD>   Top managers at Robertson Stephens had hoped to put together a
buyout of the onetime Silicon Valley star. FleetBoston owns 77% of
the investment bank, whose employees own the other 23%. FleetBoston
and Robertson Stephens announced in late June that "an agreement to
work together" had been reached, and in a final maneuver, the
investment bank said Wednesday that it was firing 425 of 950 workers
to cut costs and pay for a possible buyout.</LD>
<TE>   Despite several weeks of talks, "Fleet and the Robertson Stephens
management team were unable to structure an agreement," FleetBoston
Chief Financial Officer Eugene McQuade said in a statement. "As a
result, we have decided a wind-down is in the best interests of our
shareholders."</TE>
<TE>   The attempted auction of Robertson Stephens came after the
technology sector was flattened by a two-year bear market. What's
more, the investment industry has seen its reputation damaged by
corporate scandals, particularly allegations that analysts acted as
shills for bankers, generating huge fees by pushing stocks they
privately acknowledged were of little value.</TE>
<TE>   "I can't think of a worse time to sell," Robertson Stephens Chief
Executive John Conlin told the firm's staff Friday afternoon.</TE>
<TE>   The technology firms that Robertson specialized in funding were
booming in 1998, when FleetBoston bought Robertson Stephens from Bank
of America Corp., paying $800 million in cash and options.</TE>
<TE>   At the time, big U.S. banks had been on an acquisition tear to
diversify their holdings.</TE>
<TE>   "Robertson Stephens was in the sweet spot of the tech boom that
encompassed the capital markets in the late 1990s," said RBC Capital
Markets analyst Gerard Cassidy. "When those markets collapsed, it
brought Robertson Stephens down with it, and unfortunately the owner,
FleetBoston, got caught holding Robertson Stephens."</TE>
<TE>   Robertson was one of four Northern California investment houses
that caught the tech wave early. By the time it crested at the end of
the 1990s, all four--the others were Hambrecht &amp; Quist Inc., Alex.
Brown &amp; Sons Inc. and Montgomery Securities Inc.--had been purchased
by big commercial banks.</TE>
<TE>   Robertson took public several Internet firms. Though some, such as
E-Trade Group Inc. and MapQuest.com have survived, many others are
struggling or have gone out of business.</TE>
<TE>   Even before FleetBoston's announcement, Robertson employees had
started to leave the firm. But to the end, Robertson's management
maintained it had a future, albeit as a far smaller company.</TE>
<TE>   In his final remarks to employees, Conlin criticized Fleet's
decision to kill his firm.</TE>
<TE>   "This is not a company that had to be shut down" he said. "It is a
company whose owner decided to sell at a time when the investment
banking industry was confronting unprecedented challenges, immense
economic uncertainty and the erosion of investor confidence."</TE>
<TE>   Boston-based FleetBoston, parent company of Fleet Bank, said last
week that losses from attempting to sell Robertson Stephens would
lower its earnings by $282 million for the quarter ended June 30.
Robertson Stephens lost $61 million last year, compared with a
$216-million profit in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Associated Press and Dow Jones were used in compiling this report.</TE>

<HD>Global Crossing Lines Up Offers</HD>
<DH>Telecom: Chief executive is upbeat about bidders, but
analysts say potential investors may have stayed away because of
sector's deepening crisis.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ELIZABETH DOUGLASS and JAMES S. GRANELLI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Global Crossing Ltd. said Friday that multiple bidders submitted
offers this week to buy the telecommunications company and bring it
out of bankruptcy.</LD>
<LD>   In a conference call with employees, Chief Executive John Legere
was upbeat Friday, saying the company got "what we had hoped for and
worked so hard for" from the bidding process, which officially began
when interested investors submitted formal offers late Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Others aren't so sure Legere's optimism is warranted because, they
say, only a few bidders submitted offers out of more than 60
companies and investors that expressed interest in Global just a few
months ago.</LD>
<TE>   Among the offers, say sources familiar with the bidding, is a
complex proposal for the entire company that would give creditors
more than $1.2 billion in cash and notes and a chunk of stock that
would represent more than 21% of Global. Those terms are part of a
joint bid for the worldwide fiber-optic network builder submitted by
investment firms separately owned by brothers Alec and Tom Gores of
Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Interested bidders also could include rival network firms such as
Level3 Communications Inc., which this week received a $500-million
cash infusion earmarked in part for the purchase of distressed
telecommunications assets and companies.</TE>
<TE>   Legere said Friday that the company also received multiple offers
for individual pieces of Global Crossing, such as for its phone
teleconferencing business.</TE>
<TE>   "To think that only a few bids were made is really scary," said
analyst Patrick Comack of Guzman &amp; Co. in Miami.</TE>
<TE>   Comack and others say potential investors in the ailing company,
which filed for bankruptcy protection Jan. 28, may have been scared
off by the deepening crisis in the telecommunications industry, and
remained on the sidelines because of the prospect of more assets
becoming available if WorldCom Inc. files for bankruptcy protection.</TE>
<TE>   Accounting investigations at WorldCom, Global Crossing and Qwest
Communications International Inc. probably didn't help, the analysts
said.</TE>
<TE>   Global Crossing's creditors turned down an earlier offer from
Asian firms Hutchison Whampoa and Singapore Technologies Telemedia.</TE>
<TE>   Legere told employees that the bids will be analyzed through July
23 by attorneys and investment experts hired by Global Crossing, as
well as by the company's banks and creditors. On July 24, the bidders
will participate in an "auction" process, with the investors squaring
off and the Global Crossing representatives pressing them to improve
their offers.</TE>

<HD>Market Stumbles to End Grim Week</HD>
<DH>Wall Street: Indexes hover near multiyear lows. Investors
discount upbeat news from GE and Dell.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOSH FRIEDMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Blue-chip stocks stumbled Friday to wind up their worst week since
September, as a fall in consumer confidence overshadowed a double
dose of positive earnings news from General Electric and Dell
Computer.</LD>
<LD>   The Dow Jones industrial average suffered its fourth triple-digit
slide in five days, widening its loss for the week to 7.4%. The
broader Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index sank 6.8% during the week, and
for both indexes it was the biggest weekly drop since the market
reopened soon after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks.</LD>
<LD>   "If individual companies like GE and Dell report good news they
will be rewarded, but the market overall is in a 'show me' mood,"
said Subodh Kumar, strategist at CIBC World Markets in New York.
"Emotion is running high against stocks right now."</LD>
<TE>   GE gained $1.25 to $28.60 and Dell climbed $1.10 to $25.03 in
Friday's trading after both companies issued upbeat sales forecasts,
but they provided little tailwind for the rest of the market.</TE>
<TE>   The Dow dropped 117 points, or 1.3%, to 8,684.53, and the S&amp;P 500
lost 5.98 points, or 0.6%, to 921.39. On the bright side, the Dow did
recover much of an early 201-point drop.</TE>
<TE>   The battered technology sector held up relatively well, with the
Nasdaq composite index dipping 0.93 point, or 0.1%, to 1,373.50. For
the week, however, Nasdaq lost 5.2%, its biggest drubbing since
April.</TE>
<TE>   In Friday's trading, losers topped winners by more than 4 to 3 on
the New York Stock Exchange and by 9 to 8 on Nasdaq. Volume was
moderate.</TE>
<TE>   The day's declines left the S&amp;P 500 and Nasdaq hovering near the
five-year lows they reached Wednesday, while the Dow is only about a
5% drop from the multiyear low it set in September.</TE>
<TE>   The S&amp;P 500 is now down 39.7% from its March 2000 peak, while
Nasdaq is off 72.8% from the high it hit that same month. The Dow,
which peaked in January 2000, is down 25.6% from its high point.</TE>
<TE>   The revenue guidance from GE and Dell was the sort of optimism
many analysts say they have been watching for. But traders apparently
focused instead on the surprisingly steep decline in consumer
confidence as reported in the University of Michigan's latest monthly
survey.</TE>
<TE>   The consumer sentiment index posted its biggest drop this month
since September, sliding to 86.5 from 92.4 in June. The survey also
overshadowed a report from the Commerce Department showing a 1.1%
rise in consumer sales last month.</TE>
<TE>   Retailer Home Depot weighed on the Dow, slipping $2.31 to $29.09
after Merrill Lynch downgraded the stock, citing sluggish sales and
stiff competition.</TE>
<TE>   Dow member Procter &amp; Gamble added to the downdraft, losing $2.32
to $83.63 amid rumors that regulators were examining its accounting
practices. After the market closed, the company called the
speculation unfounded.</TE>
<TE>   Utility Duke Energy added to the growing concerns about corporate
credibility, slumping $3.20 to $24.75 after saying it was subpoenaed
by federal agencies seeking documents relating to its power trading.
After markets closed, gas pipeline operator El Paso disclosed
receiving a subpoena as well. Its stock, which lost 35 cents to
$17.75, fell to $16.70 in after-hours trading.</TE>
<TE>   With the stock market's historically sluggish summer trading
season off to a weak start, Wall Street is seeking the elusive
catalyst for a meaningful new rally.</TE>
<TE>   Strategists say investors may stay in a foul mood until they see
progress on two fronts: the corporate governance reform efforts
underway in Washington and clearer signs of a pickup in company
profits.</TE>
<TE>   "Capitol Hill and the administration need to come together on the
corporate ethics issue. If it looks like everyone is just playing
politics, the market won't like that," Kumar said. "Secondly, more
companies need to report actual improvement in revenue, operating
margins and earnings."</TE>
<TE>   Among other highlights Friday:</TE>
<TE>   * In the Treasury market, the benchmark 10-year note wrapped up
its strongest week in 3 1/2 years, rallying as investors sought
safety in government bonds. Its yield eased to 4.57% from 4.64% on
Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   * In currency trading, the U.S. dollar extended its slide against
the yen, falling to 116.79 yen from 116.81 on Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   * Elsewhere in the retail stock sector, Wal-Mart sank $1.33 to
$52.85 and Kohl's fell $2.21 to $66.99.</TE>

<BD>Reuters</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Mortgage finance giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac said they had
agreed to voluntarily meet certain corporate disclosure requirements,
and, consequently, the Bush administration no longer would seek an
end to the companies' legal exemption from those rules.</LD>
<LD>   Treasury Secretary Paul O'Neill said the Treasury, the Securities
and Exchange Commission and the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise
Oversight will conduct a joint study on disclosure issues involving
securities sold by the pair backed by pools of mortgages.</LD>
<LD>   The agreement may lift a long-standing political cloud over the
companies, which provide a secondary market for home mortgages. Some
observers have long contended that Fannie and Freddie benefit from
their status as government-sponsored enterprises and perception the
government would never allow them to fail.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>US Airways Group Inc. said it reached a tentative agreement with a
union for flight crew training instructors that is needed to help
secure a $900-million loan guarantee from the federal government.</LD>
<LD>   The agreement was made with the Transport Workers Union of
America, which represents 114 flight crew training instructors in
Charlotte, N.C., and Pittsburgh, US Airways said.</LD>
<LD>   The carrier won conditional approval for the loan guarantee
Wednesday from the Air Transportation Stabilization Board. US Airways
said it needs the guarantee to raise $1 billion in financing and
avoid a bankruptcy filing.</LD>
<TE>   US Airways, which needs worker and creditor concessions to get
final approval, already has tentative pacts with unions representing
flight attendants, dispatchers and simulator engineers and is in
talks with unions for pilots and others.</TE>

<BD>Bloomberg News</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Zale Corp.'s fiscal fourth-quarter profit will be less than forecast
because of slowing sales at the largest North American jewelry
retailer. Shares fell 15%, the biggest drop in at least two decades.</LD>
<LD>   Profit will be 14 cents to 17 cents a share, excluding costs, in
the quarter ending July 31, Zale said. The average estimate of
analysts surveyed was 24 cents. Sales at stores open at least a year
will rise 1% to 2%, the jewelry seller said.</LD>
<LD>   Slowing sales also led the largest U.S. luxury jewelry retailer,
Tiffany &amp; Co., to reduce its quarterly forecast this week.</LD>
<TE>   Shares of Irving, Texas-based Zale fell $5.29 to $29.50 on the

<DL></DL>
<LD>Safeway Inc. suspended ground beef purchases from ConAgra Foods Inc.
unit ConAgra Beef until Colorado health officials and U.S. regulators
determine the origin of an E. coli outbreak in that state.</LD>
<LD>   Health officials have determined that 12 recent cases of E. coli
poisoning in Colorado share a common source and are reviewing 13
others. They are still conducting tests to determine whether beef
recalled June 30 from ConAgra's slaughterhouse in Greeley, Colo., is
to blame.</LD>
<LD>   Eleven of the 12 people sickened by the bacteria said they bought
meat from a Safeway store. After ConAgra announced its nationwide
recall of 354,200 pounds of beef, the third-largest U.S. supermarket
chain told customers it had sold some of the beef in several Western
states.</LD>
<TE>   Shares of Omaha-based ConAgra Foods fell 60 cents to $25.36 on the
NYSE. Shares of Pleasanton, Calif.-based Safeway rose 73 cents to
$30.49, also on the NYSE.</TE>

<LD>Sprint Corp. said it will cut about 1,200 positions and eliminate
high-speed Internet platforms in some cities to cut costs amid the
telecom industry slowdown.</LD>
<LD>   The job cuts and other operating-cost measures are not expected to
have a significant effect on 2002 financial results and cash
requirements, Sprint said.</LD>
<LD>   The company said it will decommission, through the long-distance
group only, the DSL, or digital subscriber line, platform in cities
where Sprint has found a better way to deliver high-speed Internet
service or where the high costs make it difficult to continue
service.</LD>

<LD>SBC Communications Inc. plans to sell its Sterling Commerce software
unit for about $1.5 billion, according to people familiar with the
matter. SBC bought the unit two years ago for $3.5 billion in cash,
which represented a 48% premium to Sterling Commerce's share price at
that time.</LD>
<LD>   The second-biggest U.S. local phone company had to take a
$1.8-billion write-down on the electronic-commerce software unit in
the first quarter because of the decline in its value.</LD>
<LD>   Larry Solomon, a spokesman for SBC, declined to comment.</LD>

<HD>More Time for Executive Crime</HD>
<DH>Already tougher sentencing rules may play big role in
latest scandals</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WALTER HAMILTON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>NEW YORK</DL>
<LD>Even without President Bush's call this week for stricter jail terms
for executives who break the law, senior managers convicted of
accounting fraud already were facing significant prison time as a
result of beefed-up sentencing guidelines adopted last year.</LD>
<LD>   The federal government in November stiffened prison sentences for
white-collar crimes, particularly those involving large amounts of
money. The new rules came in response to criticism that white-collar
penalties were too lax and that offenders were serving only minimal
jail sentences. The median sentence for fraud convictions in both
1999 and 2000 was just one year, records show.</LD>
<LD>   The complex guidelines drew scant attention when they were
enacted, but they could play a big role in what probably will be a
spate of criminal charges against executives, experts say. The
toughened rules also could help satisfy public cries for retribution
against managers who are alleged to have enriched themselves even as
investors and employees lost billions of dollars.</LD>
<TE>   The Justice Department is investigating potential criminal
violations at Enron Corp., WorldCom Inc. and other companies that
have revealed massive accounting breakdowns. Prosecutors are
examining whether chief executives and others fudged the books to
push up share prices and dump stock options at inflated prices.</TE>
<TE>   Under the new guidelines, executives accused of major accounting
fraud could face prison terms of 20 years or longer if found guilty,
said Ron Nessim, a partner at Bird Marella Boxer &amp; Wolpert in Century
City.</TE>
<TE>   "These guys, under current guidelines, could go away for a long
time," Nessim said.</TE>
<TE>   The changes were enacted by the U.S. Sentencing Commission, a
federal agency created in 1984. The guidelines spell out a minimum
and maximum sentence for each crime, tacking on additional prison
time for factors such as the number of victims and size of their
losses. Judges often--though not always--must stick within those
ranges when meting out sentences.</TE>
<TE>   The penalties were stiffened the most for cases in which victims
lost enormous amounts of money, as has occurred with many of today's
scandals.</TE>
<TE>   Under the old rules, for example, someone who committed a fraud
costing more than $100 million would have received a sentence of 51
to 63 months. Under the new rules, it would be 121 to 151 months. If
the fraud affected 50 or more victims, the sentence would rise to 188
to 235 months--about 15  1/2 years to 19  1/2 years.</TE>
<TE>   "All the big-name scandals we're seeing now would result in huge
periods of incarceration because the guidelines are driven primarily
by the amount of the loss involved," said Kirby Behre, a partner at
Paul Hastings Janofsky &amp; Walker and co-author of an upcoming legal
study of sentencing rules for business crimes.</TE>
<TE>   The new guidelines apply to crimes committed since November. But
the government could charge an executive with participating in a
"continuing conspiracy" in an effort to qualify earlier crimes for
sentencing under the new guidelines.</TE>
<TE>   However, despite the stiffened rules, defendants can shorten their
sentences, especially by cooperating with prosecutors.</TE>
<TE>   In 2000, almost 19% of fraud sentences were reduced for such
assistance, according to the Sentencing Commission. An additional 12%
of prison terms were slashed for other reasons.</TE>
<TE>   Potentially more important, it is extremely difficult to win
accounting-fraud convictions, especially of CEOs.</TE>
<TE>   It is tough for prosecutors to rebut CEO claims that they relied
on the advice of accountants and lawyers and were not personally
involved in bookkeeping details.</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, judges and prosecutors may be loath to lighten
sentences given the publicity many cases will receive.</TE>
<TE>   "We're going to see some star prosecutions where, if people were
not on TV every day, [the defendant] would get a considerably lighter
sentence," said Warren L. Dennis, an attorney with firm Proskauer &amp;
Rose in Washington.</TE>
<TE>   Defense attorneys argue that the proposals by Bush and legislators
on Capitol Hill to toughen the guidelines even further would have
little deterrent value because the new sentencing rules are so
strict.</TE>
<TE>   Bush has called for toughened sentencing guidelines for corporate
officers and directors. A bill passed by the Senate this week would
require the Sentencing Commission to raise the sentencing guidelines
for obstruction of justice, and for fraud in which there are many
victims or enormous losses are incurred.</TE>

<TE>   Past Indiscretions and Penalties</TE>
<TE>   Sentences for white-collar criminals tend to vary widely. How some
of the famous corporate wrongdoers of the recent past fared in the
courts:</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Michael Milken: In 1989, the junk bond king from Drexel Burnham
Lambert  was indicted on 98 counts of securities fraud and
racketeering. Milken pleaded guilty to six felonies including
securities fraud and conspiracy  in 1990 and was sentenced to 10
years in prison. He spent 22 months in federal prison camp at
Pleasanton and was released in 1993. He paid $1.1 billion in fines
and penalties.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Charles H. Keating: After his Lincoln Savings &amp; Loan toppled into
bankruptcy in 1989, costing taxpayers $3.4 billion, he spent almost
five years in prison on fraud charges. Some charges were ultimately
thrown out.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Ivan F. Boesky: The stock speculator was sentenced to three years
in prison in 1987 for insider trading. He spent two years in jail and
paid $100 million to settle federal civil charges.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Barry Minkow: The ZZZZ Best Co. wonder boy from Reseda spent seven
years in prison after the carpet-cleaning firm tanked in 1987 and
Minkow was convicted of defrauding investors and banks.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Bruce McNall: The former L.A. Kings owner in 1994 pleaded guilty
to charges of fraud and conspiracy for defrauding banks of $236
million. He spent four years in prison.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Dennis Levine: In 1986, the Shearson Lehman Bros. employee was
accused of earning almost $13 million via insider trading. He served</TE>
<TE>   17 months of a two-year federal prison term for securities fraud,
tax evasion and perjury.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Michael Monus: The former president of Phar-Mor was convicted in
1995 on 109 counts for masterminding a $1.1-billion embezzlement
scheme. He was fined $1 million and sentenced to 19 years in prison.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>BARCELONA, Spain</DL>
<LD>Former President Clinton embraced former South African President
Nelson Mandela to wild cheers at the world AIDS conference Friday and
declared that the battle against AIDS must be won.</LD>
<LD>   "One hundred million AIDS cases means more terror, more
mercenaries, more war, destruction, and the failure of fragile
democracies," Clinton said at the close of the 14th International
AIDS Conference, the largest since the meetings began in 1985.</LD>
<LD>   The former presidents told 15,000 scientists, care workers and
activists that determination and billions of dollars for prevention
and treatment programs were needed to halt the global spread of HIV,
the virus that causes AIDS.</LD>
<TE>   "AIDS is a war against humanity," Mandela said.</TE>
<TE>   The disease is claiming more victims "than all wars and natural
disasters," Mandela said, and cited the United Nations' warning that
70 million people could die in the next 20 years "unless drastic
action is taken."</TE>
<TE>   He called for access to HIV-fighting drugs "for all those that
need it, wherever they may be in the world, regardless of whether
they can afford it."</TE>

<HD>Bolivian Marchers Protest Chile Pipeline Plan</HD>
<DH>Resources: Some, citing a turf dispute, favor a Peruvian
route. Others oppose the gas export.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHRIS KRAUL</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>LA PAZ, Bolivia</DL>
<LD>Thousands of protesters marched through the streets here Friday,
opposing plans to sell natural gas to California via a pipeline
through Chile.</LD>
<LD>   The demonstration resurrected a century-old territorial grudge and
underscored the deep disappointment among Bolivians that more than a
decade of pursuing foreign investment in this Andean nation has done
little to erase poverty and unemployment.</LD>
<LD>   The marchers voiced the anti-globalization complaints heard across
Latin America these days: that foreign investment, especially
involving the privatization of state-owned companies and resources,
has only led to layoffs and a rise in the misery index.</LD>
<TE>   "They have turned administration of the phone company over to the
Germans, and they haven't spent one peso on it, just taken all the
money back to Germany," protester Reynaldo Illanes said.</TE>
<TE>   The natural gas controversy laid bare a festering sore in Bolivian
history: its long anger over Pacific Coast territory lost to Chile
during a 19th century war, leaving this nation landlocked.</TE>
<TE>   "Chile took the sea from us, and because of that Bolivia is so
behind in the economy and in development," said demonstrator Carlos
Rodriguez, 87, a decorated veteran of the 1930s Chaco War with
Paraguay, which also cost Bolivia a significant chunk of territory.</TE>
<TE>   The government is trying to decide between Chilean and Peruvian
routes for a pipeline that would connect natural gas reserves in
Bolivia's Amazon basin to markets in Mexico and California. Enough
gas could be shipped annually to fill 15% of California's demand.
Shortages of gas and the high prices they caused were among the
reasons for California's energy crisis.</TE>
<TE>   A consortium of energy companies, including British Gas, British
Petroleum and Repsol YPF, has proposed spending $5 billion to build
the pipeline from fields it controls here. But the group says only a
Chilean route is economically feasible.</TE>
<TE>   Many Bolivians favor a longer and more expensive pipeline through
Peru.</TE>
<TE>   Sempra Energy of San Diego and CMS Energy Corp. of Michigan have
agreed to purchase the gas, which would be transported by ship to a
terminal they would build south of Rosarito in Baja California and
piped north.</TE>
<TE>   But what might seem to outsiders a golden opportunity for Bolivia
to exploit a market hungry for its vast reserves of natural gas is
perceived by many locals as just one more case of the nation selling
its resources on the cheap to foreign interests.</TE>
<TE>   Many would prefer that Bolivia keep its 52 trillion cubic feet of
gas in the ground.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't want them to sell our gas at the price of a dead
chicken," said Pedro Humeres, 67, a retired factory worker who joined
Friday's protest.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't want to sell it at any price," he said. "It's the only
asset we have left."</TE>
<TE>   That has been the position of Evo Morales, a former coca farmer
who finished a surprising second in the June 30 presidential
election.</TE>
<TE>   Bolivian leaders see California as a good opportunity to diversify
the market for its natural gas. Sales to Brazil through a pipeline
completed in 1999 are at half the volumes expected. Still, a Pacific
pipeline could produce $300 million in revenue for Bolivia, equal to
that expected next year from the Brazilian route.</TE>
<TE>   But the controversy that has erupted over the route seems to have
paralyzed leadership.</TE>
<TE>   President Jorge Quiroga was expected to make the decision after
the election but is now expected to leave it to his successor.
Bolivia's Congress will select the new leader next month, with the
likely winner to be Gonzalo Sanchez de Lozada, who barely edged out
Morales as top vote-getter.</TE>
<TE>   Several efforts at privatization in recent years--including the
Cochabamba water system, the Huanuni tin mine, and the national
airline and railroad--are widely perceived by Bolivians as
exploitative failures.</TE>
<TE>   Although some foreign takeovers have been successful, including
that of the electric power system, they are usually forgotten in the
rising sense of frustration with the poor economy.</TE>
<TE>   "There is a feeling among the people that they have been tricked,
that the private companies will make a lot and the state not enough,"
said Carlos Miranda, a former energy minister.</TE>
<TE>   Though acknowledging that some cases of privatization have fallen
short of the benefits promised, Carlos Enrique Kempff Bruno, the
minister of economic development, said Bolivia's problems are also
due to forces beyond its control, including a poor global economy,
low mineral prices and unstable economies in neighboring countries.</TE>
<TE>   Bolivia's exports of $1 billion are the same as they were in 1975,
mainly because of fallen prices for tin and zinc, once leading
products.</TE>
<TE>   "Our economic problems are proof that Bolivia is not immune from
the impact of the international crisis," Kempff Bruno said.</TE>
<TE>   The minister added that a a coca eradication program sponsored by
the United States has eliminated $500 million from the Bolivian
economy.</TE>
<TE>   After Bolivia's 16-year process of liberalizing investment rules
and opening markets to foreign producers, the economy is mired in a
three-year recession and an unemployment rate of more than 15%. The
promises made by leaders in the 1980s have failed to materialize.</TE>
<TE>   Carlos Toranzo, a La Paz economist, said the pendulum of opinion
is swinging against neoliberalism.</TE>
<TE>   "People are upset with economic policies that are driven by
economic goals tied to inflation, investment and low debt, when it
should be a science of benefiting people," Toranzo said.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, a delay in selecting a route for the natural gas
pipeline could derail the project.</TE>
<TE>   "Unless the pipeline is built the shortest and least expensive
route, it won't get built," said Ronald MacLean, an economist, former
mayor of La Paz and unsuccessful candidate in the June presidential
race.</TE>
<TE>   Gary C. Hufbauer, a senior fellow at the Institute for
International Economics in Washington, said a bigger risk for the
region is that "the political dial would turn inward rather than
outward, toward the past rather than toward the future."</TE>

<HD>Standoff Over Land Continues in Mexico</HD>
<DH>Latin America: Farmers' protest against proposed airport
draws on a long history of revolt. Each side demands that the other
free its captives.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD BOUDREAUX and RAFAEL AGUIRRE</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL>SAN SALVADOR ATENCO, Mexico</DL>
<LD>When the government decided last fall to relocate Mexico City's
airport to a mostly dry lake bed east of the capital, the loudest
objection came from environmentalists who feared the loss of a winter
home for tens of thousands of migratory birds.</LD>
<LD>   Few outsiders worried about the thousands of small farmers who
also would be displaced from the land of their ancestors.</LD>
<LD>   From the start, the farmers have resisted a government mandate to
leave their homes and fields in return for cash. They have blocked
roads, gone to court and tried to march on President Vicente Fox's
official residence--all to no avail.</LD>
<TE>   Now, taking inspiration from southern Mexico's Zapatista
guerrillas, they have donned ski masks and turned to violence. On
Thursday, they hijacked and burned vehicles, attacked police with
machetes and seized hostages, bringing Mexico's bloody history of
land feuds to the country's biggest public works project of the new
century.</TE>
<TE>   The conflict, in which 30 people have been injured, settled into a
tense standoff Friday between leaders of the uprising and the state
of Mexico. Each side was demanding the release of captives held by
the other.</TE>
<TE>   Late in the day, police freed three of 15 farmers who were
arrested Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   As riot police lined up in trucks outside this barricaded farming
settlement, about 350 people set off firecrackers and chanted
anti-government slogans in the central plaza. The crowd, which
included women and children, guzzled Coca-Cola from two trucks
hijacked by the farmers and saved the bottles to make firebombs.</TE>
<TE>   At least 30 vehicles, including stolen trucks and burned police
cars, blocked all entrances to the town, located near a huge garbage
dump 18 miles east of Mexico City, causing a monumental traffic jam.
Hundreds of farmers, many armed with machetes and metal pipes, were
taking part in the protest.</TE>
<TE>   In the town's auditorium, protest leader David Pajaro paraded
seven hostages before television cameras. They included a state
prosecutor and police officers.</TE>
<TE>   Disavowing threats by some protesters to kill them, Pajaro said
the hostages had not--and would not--be harmed. Two of the hostages
were allowed to speak to reporters. They said they were being treated
well but feared that they would be killed if police tried to rescue
them.</TE>
<TE>   Pajaro offered to free the hostages in exchange for the farmers
arrested Thursday. He said his group was negotiating with state
authorities.</TE>
<TE>   "It's up to the government to resolve this situation," he said.
"If that is done, we will go back to the way we were, everybody in
peace."</TE>
<TE>   The state's attorney general, Alfonso Navarrete Prida, said most
of the protesters might soon be freed on bail. The three released
late Friday had nothing to do with the uprising, his office said.</TE>
<TE>   But Gov. Arturo Montiel said officials refused to discuss a
release of two protest leaders, who face more serious charges of
inciting violence and stabbing a policeman.</TE>
<TE>   Families comprising 34,000 people hold title to the 13,300 acres
in 13 communities that would be swallowed by the $2.3-billion
airport, to be the largest in Latin America. The area once was under
Lake Texcoco, part of Mexico City's Aztec-era water system.</TE>
<TE>   Fox's administration chose the area in October over a more
expensive and distant site in Hidalgo state. The new six-runway
airport would enable the government to close Mexico City's
overcrowded Benito Juarez International Airport, which is hemmed in
by homes and businesses on the eastern side of the capital.</TE>
<TE>   To appease environmentalists, who had been struggling to recover
the ancient lake network, the government promised to create
reservoirs and parklands near the new airport. Environmentalists are
still challenging the project.</TE>
<TE>   But the farmers' revolt now has taken center stage.</TE>
<TE>   The government would give residents as little as seven pesos, or
70 cents, per square meter of land.</TE>
<TE>   "What are we going to do with seven pesos?" asked Francisco Jaime
Contreras, 54, a corn farmer in the nearby village of Santa Ana.
"It's not enough even to buy refreshments."</TE>
<TE>   Others have refused to move no matter what they are offered.</TE>
<TE>   "I would give my life instead," said Jesus Gonzalez, 22, a
machete-wielding farmer from the village of Acuexcomac. "Our land is
like a mother to us."</TE>
<TE>   Such words are not idle talk in Mexico, where bloody disputes
between peasants and large landowners helped fuel the revolution of
1910, which led to a massive land redistribution.</TE>
<TE>   The land in the Texcoco area is held in ejidos, government titles
won during the revolution and handed down over generations. The
central plaza here features a large mural of revolutionary heroes,
including peasant leader Emiliano Zapata.</TE>
<TE>   Speaking to reporters in the plaza, Pajaro said the farmers were
following the example of Zapatista rebels in the southern state of
Chiapas, who took their name from Zapata and led a 1994 uprising in
the name of Indian rights.</TE>
<TE>   The violence began Thursday when dozens of farmers blocked a
highway near Santa Catarina, 25 miles northeast of Mexico City.</TE>
<TE>   After order was restored there, a second group of protesters began
blocking highways around this town, taking hostages and seizing and
burning vehicles. Protest leaders said riot police started the
violence by forcing their peaceful caravan off the road and attacking
their group with clubs.</TE>

<HD>Swiss Admit Errors in Air Crash</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>UEBERLINGEN, Germany</DL>
<LD>Switzerland acknowledged Friday that its air traffic controllers were
at least partly to blame for the collision of a Russian charter jet
and a cargo plane over Germany and admitted lapses in handling the
aftermath of the crash, which killed 71 people.</LD>
<LD>   At a memorial ceremony near the crash site in southern Germany,
Swiss Transportation Minister Moritz Leuenberger sought to address
Russian anger about early statements from Swiss air traffic control
that appeared to blame the pilot of the Bashkirian Airlines plane,
whose passengers included 45 children headed for a Spanish beach
vacation.</LD>
<LD>   "The confrontation with the terrible notion of being part of the
cause of the death of 71 people led us into helpless initial
reactions, to confused and confusing information, to lapses,"
Leuenberger said, expressing condolences for the victims on behalf of
Switzerland. "Not every one of us found the right words."</LD>
<TE>   Meanwhile, Swiss President Kaspar Villiger canceled plans to
attend a funeral today in Russia for children killed in the collision
after authorities said they could not guarantee his safety because of
strong emotions in the region, the Swiss Embassy in Russia said.</TE>
<TE>   Switzerland is ready to offer compensation for the victims and
will cooperate fully in the German-led investigation into the July 1
crash, Leuenberger said at the German ceremony.</TE>
<TE>   Immediately after the crash, the Swiss said they had told the
Russian pilot several times to descend and received only one reply.
German investigators said the Russian pilot received contradictory
instructions from the on-board warning system and the Swiss control
tower.</TE>

<HD>Enchanting Greek Island Worked Its Magic for Conversion</HD>
<DH>A PLACE OF HEALING FOR THE SOUL: Patmos; By Peter France;
Atlantic Monthly Press; 220 pages, $24</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PHILIP ZALESKI</AU>
<BD>Philip Zaleski is the editor of the annual Best
Spiritual Writing series for HarperSanFrancisco and is the coauthor,
with Carol Zaleski, of the forthcoming "The Language of Paradise:
Prayer in Human Life and Culture."</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>For 1,600 years--since St. Augustine, bent over his episcopal desk in
the North African port city of Hippo, completed his "Confessions"
around AD 401--tales of religious conversion have been a flourishing
literary form, producing through the centuries a bumper crop of
classics.</LD>
<LD>   John Bunyan's "Grace Abounding to the Chief of Sinners," Leo
Tolstoy's "A Confession" and C.S. Lewis' "Surprised by Joy" are just
a few of the genre's highlights, each offering as much high drama as
the fictions for which these authors are better known.</LD>
<LD>   That conversion stories pack a punch is not surprising, for God is
the driving force in many a life, and coming to terms with that force
often entails dropping to one's knees before an unfamiliar altar.</LD>
<TE>   For as Augustine and his literary offspring have made clear,
conversion entails more than adopting a new set of beliefs. It means
taking on a new mind and a new heart--and often, as Peter France
demonstrates in his lovely new memoir, "A Place of Healing for the
Soul," a new country as well.</TE>
<TE>   If ever anyone was primed for a spiritual sea change, it was
France. As host of the popular British religious television program
"Everyman," he had spent 15 years traveling the world, living out of
hotel rooms, seeing his wife when his schedule allowed.</TE>
<TE>   He was burned out, and increasingly uneasy about his personal
beliefs. A die-hard free thinker, he remained aloof from all
spiritual practice, though adept at portraying its many forms
sympathetically.</TE>
<TE>   But France's wife was a devout Christian, a convert to Orthodoxy,
and France was beginning to suspect that he liked religious people
more than he did his fellow skeptics. "They had more weight, more
substance," he writes. "They were more emotionally generous and
seemed to lack spite."</TE>
<TE>   The catalyst for change came in the form of an invitation from a
friend, suggesting that France and his wife visit the Greek isle of
Patmos for a few weeks. At first France was put off by the local
residents, by their loud voices, late-night parties, heavy smoking
and marketplace squabbles.</TE>
<TE>   But he was entranced by the island itself. Small wonder, for
Patmos has always been a place of enchantment, a land seemingly
poised halfway between Earth and some more mysterious spiritual
realm.</TE>
<TE>   According to Greek myth, the island slumbered underwater for
millenniums, until raised by Zeus as a gift for Artemis, goddess of
wild animals, vegetation and the hunt. This pagan pedigree pales,
however, beside Patmos' importance as the place where in AD 95 the
evangelist John wrote down his great vision, destined to join the
Christian biblical canon as the Book of Revelation.</TE>
<TE>   To France, Patmos was "a place of power." He fell in love with its
rugged landscapes, its virginal light, its remoteness from his former
life. He clambered over its mountains and ravines, explored its
villages, monasteries and convents. He discovered the joys of ouzo,
the importance of the fakelo (bribe), the passion with which the
natives relished the present moment.</TE>
<TE>   He and his wife bought a house in town, for which they paid 6
million drachmas in cash, transferred, with typical Patmian
casualness, in a plastic shopping bag. Later they exchanged that
dwelling for a mountain cottage, a rundown structure without
electricity and running water but with plenty of rats and scorpions,
and a breathtaking view of the sea.</TE>
<TE>   Eventually the island worked its wonders on France's soul. He
reread John's Gospel, this time as if it were true, in keeping with
the venerable premise of credo ut intellegam: "I believe in order
that I may understand."</TE>
<TE>   He came to see Orthodoxy as a way of love and a guardian of
tradition, and he came to believe, at least provisionally, in
spiritual realities--in good and evil, in God and Christ. Finally, he
was baptized, barefoot and shrouded, at 57, uncertain of the absolute
truth of his faith but happy to embrace its beauty and serenity.</TE>
<TE>   France's conversion is deeply touching. His sense of unworthiness,
of nagging doubt, of willingness to plunge ahead regardless, gives to
the traditional conversion tale a modern spin. This is religious
discovery for a postmodern generation, for those unwilling to embrace
the rock-hard convictions of the past.</TE>
<TE>   The book is not without its faults: France's criticisms of
non-Orthodox Christianity border on caricature, and he has a penchant
for sweeping generalizations. ("The difference between East and West
here seems to be that the East is more at home with mysticism.")</TE>
<TE>   Often he ascribes to Orthodoxy a way of life, a blend of
earthiness, simplicity and indifference to clock time that seems
rather to be a staple of all Mediterranean island cultures, as common
to Catholic Malta as to Orthodox Patmos.</TE>
<TE>   But these are blemishes on an otherwise polished performance. One
worries, in fact, that this appealing book could draw others to
Patmos, and thus steal away a bit of the island's pristine magic. But
such may be the ironic price--worth paying, this time around--of
baring one's soul to the world.</TE>

French Interior Minister Nicolas Sarkozy announced.</LD>
<LD>   Sarkozy's statement came after he met with his British
counterpart, David Blunkett.</LD>
<LD>   The Red Cross-run center near the Channel Tunnel has been used as
a jumping-off point for refugees trying to sneak into Britain.</LD>

<LD>Parliament gave final approval to a hotly disputed bill granting
researchers and journalists access to the East German spy files on
prominent public figures, overturning legislation passed to protect
former German Chancellor Helmut Kohl.</LD>
<LD>   Conservatives tried unsuccessfully to block the legislation in the
upper house. The new law in effect overturns a federal court ruling
in Kohl's favor that said a public figure had to give permission for
release of files kept by the Communist-era Stasi secret police.</LD>

<HD>A Llama? A Camel? It's Both</HD>
<DH>A lonely oddity named Rama has his father's legs and his
mother's coat (sort of). He was created in Dubai. 'Why?' you may be
asking.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL SLACKMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>DUBAI, United Arab Emirates</DL>
<LD>One certainly is the loneliest number.</LD>
<LD>   There isn't a single suitable partner for Rama, and there's
nothing he can do about it. He's either too tall and heavy or too
short and slight, depending on whom he's fixed his fancy on.</LD>
<LD>   The problem is, Rama is unique. Really. He is one of a kind, a
man-made creature, a beast of burden that doesn't exist naturally--in
fact, would not exist at all if a bunch of scientists hadn't cooked
him up in a laboratory in the desert.</LD>
<TE>   He's the only male of his species: the cama. Never heard of a
cama? Few people have outside this tiny land of sand, sea and oil.</TE>
<TE>   The rulers of Dubai, who used their oil wealth to transform a
barren sliver of land in the Persian Gulf into a modern city with
lush gardens and trees, also used their money to create Rama, a cross
between a camel and a llama.</TE>
<TE>   Actually, Julian Skidmore created Rama. Skidmore, 38, known to
everyone as Lulu, is a proper, petite Brit and the principal
scientific officer at Dubai's Camel Reproduction Center.</TE>
<TE>   Her creation, she's fond of saying, is not as outlandish as, say,
crossing an elephant and a giraffe. After all, the camel and the
llama hail from the same family tree and were one species millions of
years ago.</TE>
<TE>   "In theory you end up with an animal that is halfway in height
between the two with a good winter coat," Skidmore says. "That would
be very good."</TE>
<TE>   That, at least, is the theory, which we'll get back to later.</TE>
<TE>   Skidmore and her team, under the patronage of the crown prince of
Dubai, tried for about a year to breed the two creatures but had
difficulty until one magical day in January 1998. That's when Rama
the cama entered the world at a cuddly 12 pounds.</TE>
<TE>   Today, Rama looks like a llama bulked up on steroids. His legs are
longer and thicker than a llama's, but he doesn't have the hump of a
camel. With her cultured British accent and deadpan delivery,
Skidmore describes Rama's romance problems this way:</TE>
<TE>   "Rama is too big for these llamas--he squashes them. And he is too
small for the camels," she says. To help cheer him up a bit, they
made him a life-size love toy, though he wasn't too happy with that,
either: "We built him a dummy and he doesn't like that. He took a
bite out of it."</TE>
<TE>   This next part may sound a bit like the old Frankenstein movie,
where the doctor's monstrous creation wanted someone to love, so they
built him a bride. In February, another 12-pound little miracle,
Kamilah, was born, and now Rama is waiting in his air-conditioned pen
for this cama tot to come of age in a few years.</TE>
<TE>   "That's my baby," Skidmore says with a hint of a laugh as she
points out the doe-eyed bride-to-be.</TE>
<TE>   At this point, you might be wondering why Sheik Mohammed ibn
Rashid al Maktum, the crown prince of Dubai and the defense minister
for the United Arab Emirates, invested all this time and money
(though they aren't saying exactly how much) on breeding camas. What
exactly is the point?</TE>
<TE>   Good question, but we'll get back to that too. First, a bit about
camels, the extraordinary animals that have been inseparable from
Bedouin culture for centuries. Known by some as Ata Allah ("God's
gift"), they're so exalted in this community that they are even
mentioned in the Koran and serve as emotional markers for a
traditional way of life that has largely faded into modernity.</TE>
<TE>   Bedouins "have a very long association with camels and a very
special relationship," says Ahsan ul Haq, a camel veterinarian for
the royal family of Dubai. "People here get more concerned when their
camel gets sick than a son or daughter."</TE>
<TE>   We are, of course, talking about the dromedary, or one-hump camel,
which is unique to North Africa, the Persian Gulf and West Asia. The
two-humped cousin, the Bactrian, can be found chiefly in Mongolia and
China</TE>
<TE>   Bedouins have long prized their soft-footed friends for their
endurance, but also for their milk, their fur and their meat.</TE>
<TE>   Though they have largely been replaced by jeeps and trucks and
other modern forms of transportation, camels--one hump or two--are
incredible creatures.</TE>
<TE>   To begin with, there is the hump. You may think it's a big water
tank. No--it's a store of fat that allows the animal to go for a long
time without water or food.</TE>
<TE>   Still, that's nothing in the camel's bag of tricks. Camels have a
unique internal thermostat that allows their body temperature to
fluctuate by only a few degrees, preventing them from overheating in
the sun or getting cold at night. They have double layers of
eyelashes and a nose that shuts tight, all to keep out the sand.</TE>
<TE>   Still, none of this answers the question "Why?" To get closer to
that, let's talk about another camel attribute: They can run. Not as
fast as horses, but fast enough to race.</TE>
<TE>   Camel racing is a big deal in much of the gulf. Gambling is
strictly prohibited by Islam, but the sport is a hugely popular
pastime and a big industry. A top racing camel can sell for as much
as $1.5 million. Victory purses can range from a few hundred dollars
to a brand-new Mercedes-Benz.</TE>
<TE>   "Here, it's a big hobby," Haq says. "It is also a cultural link
between the rulers and the local population. Local people often train
the camels for the sheiks."</TE>
<TE>   In the mid-1980s, the crown prince of Dubai figured why not employ
some of the advanced scientific techniques used in thoroughbred
breeding for camels? Camels may have a lot of advantageous
attributes, but they also have a few peculiarities that make it
inconvenient to breed them for racing.</TE>
<TE>   Females, for example, make the best racers, but they are in their
racing prime and breeding prime at about the same time. Gestation is
13 months, and females can't run when they're pregnant.</TE>
<TE>   So the crown prince turned to Newmarket, England, the center of
thoroughbred reproductive sciences in Britain, and its director, W.R.
Allen, a leading professor of equine reproduction at Cambridge
University. The initial goal was embryo transfer--setting up a system
in which a fast-running female could be chemically coaxed into
producing many eggs at once. The eggs would then be fertilized,
removed from the mother and placed into surrogates.</TE>
<TE>   The mom could still run while, say, her 20 or so offspring came to
term in stand-in moms. (Skidmore says her record has been 20
fertilized eggs from one female.)</TE>
<TE>   Skidmore--who at the time worked for Allen, known as Twink--and
her supervisors at the Equine Fertility Project in Newmarket were
invited to start the "embryo transfer project" in Dubai in 1989.</TE>
<TE>   Skidmore eventually got her doctorate and a high-tech lab in the
desert. With her administrative supervisor, Ahmed Mustansir Billah,
Skidmore and her team set about making advances in camel reproduction
science.</TE>
<TE>   Skidmore recounts her decision to work with camels as she drives
her Land Cruiser away from the modern glass-and-metal buildings of
Dubai. After leaving the pavement and heading down a sand path, she
arrives at the lab, with its two squat white buildings and three
fenced pens.</TE>
<TE>   She steps inside the sparsely furnished facility, pulls on a pair
of camel-colored coveralls and asks her assistant, Egaz, to bring in
1965, a rather large female camel.</TE>
<TE>   Skidmore had assisted in getting 1965 pregnant and wants to see
how the fetus is doing. Arabian racing camels look sort of like huge
greyhounds, with small tummies, a rounded chest and long, muscular
legs. Egaz brings 1965 in through the barn-like doors and coaxes her
down to the ground. As the beast munches away on a bowl of camel
cereal, Skidmore plunges her gloved arm elbow-deep inside the camel
to take an ultrasound.</TE>
<TE>   "That's the heart," Skidmore says, pointing proudly toward a
small, flickering image on a video monitor. The camel doesn't seem to
mind one bit, and as Skidmore pulls her arm out, she says, "Let's go
see Kamilah."</TE>
<TE>   Which brings us, again, to "Why?"</TE>
<TE>   Llamas and camels split tens of millions of years ago, with the
former adapting to life in the New World, where they lived at higher
altitudes. The latter became suited to the desert. Why reunite them?</TE>
<TE>   To paraphrase "The Six Million Dollar Man," the TV show from the
'70s: "We can build him. We have the technology." Once immersed in
the world of camel reproduction, Skidmore and her team dreamed up a
new project: They wanted to make a better animal. Perhaps more
important, they wanted to try something no one had done before.</TE>
<TE>   The idea, Skidmore says, was to do more than create a curiosity.
Back in 1971, for example, Britain's Colchester Zoo put some donkeys
and zebras together in a pen and by chance ended up with zeedonks, a
donkey-looking animal with black-and-white-striped legs. They
attracted lots of visitors, but that was about all.</TE>
<TE>   Skidmore and her team had grander hopes for the cama, envisioning
something as useful as a mule, which is a cross between a horse and a
donkey. (No one knows yet if Rama shares a mule attribute:
sterility.) The goal was to achieve the best of both animals and end
up with something less ornery than a camel but bigger than a
llama--and with the prized llama fur. A beast of burden with a nice
personality and good hair.</TE>
<TE>   Rama didn't exactly work out that way. He never got as big as
hoped, and though his coat is furrier than a camel's, it's not nearly
as luxurious as a llama's. And he's very, very difficult to deal
with, charging at people, biting, refusing to stand still even to
have ticks pulled off.</TE>
<TE>   These days, he spends his mornings isolated from the other animals
in an outdoor pen at the reproductive center compound. He escapes the
midday heat in an air-conditioned enclosure, where he munches on
dried greens.</TE>
<TE>   At least a few people think the whole thing is a bit strange, even
wrong.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's totally useless," says Ilse Kohler-Rollefson, a
veterinarian and anthropologist. "These animals will be like freaks.
They will not feel they belong in Arabia or South America."</TE>
<TE>   Skidmore acknowledges her progeny's behavioral problems but, like
many first-time mothers, blames herself, not the tyke. She says she
never should have bottle-fed him but should have let him nurse from
his llama mom.</TE>
<TE>   Still, she and her team wanted to see if they could do it again,
maybe with a better result. Enter Kamilah. Right now she is adorable,
with big brown eyes, a brown coat, a white crown on her head and
white nose. As with most second children, she's not getting the
attention of the first.</TE>
<TE>   But physically it doesn't look like the world's second cama will
be substantially different from the first. And Kamilah doesn't seem
to be any more comfortable with people than her prospective partner
is.</TE>
<TE>   Skidmore knows that her cama-creating days may be numbered. "We'll
produce a few, then obviously we'll probably say, 'That's enough,' "
she says.</TE>
<TE>   For Rama, though, at least there is Kamilah, who should soon bring
an end to his lonely days and, perhaps, improve his personality.</TE>
<TE>   "He doesn't have a social association with anything," Haq says.
"If you have a companion, you are calmer and more happy. That might
be the reason he is nasty."</TE>

<HD>Rights Groups to End Contacts With Russia in Chechnya</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN DANISZEWSKI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>MOSCOW</DL>
<LD>Human rights groups announced Friday that they are ending an ongoing
"dialogue" with Russian security and military officials in Chechnya,
charging that promises to curtail human rights abuses and identify
those responsible have been ignored.</LD>
<LD>   Representatives of the two main groups, Memorial and the Moscow
Helsinki Committee, said they will continue to monitor abuses in the
republic but not participate in meetings with government, military
and police officials because the talks have been proven largely
futile.</LD>
<LD>   Lyudmila Alekseyeva, chairwoman of the Helsinki group, told a news
conference here that it was a "difficult and sad" decision to give up
the contacts, which grew out of a summit in November between
officials and representatives of nongovernmental groups.</LD>
<TE>   "But to continue these fruitless discussions would have been even
more difficult," she said. "Human rights organizations would have
been used as a smoke screen behind which lawlessness would take
place."</TE>
<TE>   Russia's presidential information office issued a statement saying
the decision was unfortunate.</TE>
<TE>   "The federal authorities receive the decision ... to end
negotiating activities in Chechnya with regret," the statement said.
"In our opinion, the coordination between the authorities and the
NGOs was developing well."</TE>
<TE>   Russian army and police troops entered Chechnya in late 1999 to
subdue the rebel republic, which had long been seeking independence
from the Russian Federation. About 80,000 troops remain, unable to
fully quell a stubborn insurgency and frequently accused of
extrajudicial killings and other human rights abuses. The Kremlin has
said that when crimes are uncovered the perpetrators are to be
punished.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, President Vladimir V. Putin named an ethnic Chechen
economist who had been working as an advisor to the lower house of
the Russian parliament as his human rights envoy for the republic.</TE>
<TE>   The envoy indicated that he would be balanced in his assessments
and even displayed some sympathy for the security forces. "We should
be mindful of how heavy the burden is on Russian troops in Chechnya,"
said Abdul-Khakim Sultygov.</TE>
<TE>   Human rights activists said they were not optimistic that Sultygov
would be more successful in protecting Chechen civilians than his
predecessor, Vladimir A. Kalamanov, a respected diplomat who held the
post for two years.</TE>
<TE>   Both the government and the human rights groups agreed that the
main achievement of the dialogue between the government and the
rights groups was the issuance March 27 of the so-called Order 80.</TE>
<TE>   It required troops in Chechnya carrying out zachistki, or cleanup
operations, to have visible numbers on their armored vehicles; to
identify themselves when conducting searches; and to give local
authorities a list of names and reasons whenever terrorist suspects
are taken away, including stating where they will be held. In
exchange, local administrators were obliged to sign a statement
confirming that the zachistki were carried out properly.</TE>
<TE>   In practice, said Tatyana I. Kasatkina, executive director of
Memorial, Order 80 was ignored except for its last provision. "Local
administrators, at gunpoint, have been intimidated into signing those
papers for the military," she said.</TE>
<TE>   In the meantime, "hundreds of cases started against the military
for human rights violations remain indefinitely suspended because the
guilty parties can't be established," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the withdrawal from dialogue, Kasatkina says Memorial will
continue its human rights work in Chechnya.</TE>
<TE>   Memorial issued a report Friday on an anti-rebel purge in the
village of Chechen-Aul, near the Chechen capital, Grozny, that it
said took place June 11-24.</TE>
<TE>   According to the report, soldiers did not introduce themselves as
they searched the village and entered homes. Initially, the searches
went smoothly, but later groups of servicemen behaved with increasing
roughness toward the population, it said.</TE>
<TE>   Memorial said that, according to its information, "the most
serious violations" of Russian law and Order 80 occurred.</TE>
<TE>   It attached a list naming 12 residents said to have been killed.
In addition, the group said, three unidentified bodies were found on
the village outskirts and two men were blown up inside a deserted
house.</TE>
<TE>   Prisoners were in some cases abused, the report said. Memorial
cited a disabled man, Nurdi Dakayev, who it said was taken away June
19 and tortured.</TE>
<TE>   When Dakayev's body was returned to relatives June 21, a hand was
missing, the report said. Another body was returned to relatives
headless, the Memorial report asserted.</TE>

<HD>U.S. Granted Immunity for Peacekeepers</HD>
<DH>United Nations: The Security Council gives Americans a
one-year renewable exemption from an international court's authority.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WILLIAM ORME</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>UNITED NATIONS</DL>
<LD>After two weeks of back-room wrangling and acrimonious debate, the
U.S. muscled through a Security Council resolution Friday granting
American peacekeepers a renewable one-year exemption from prosecution
or investigation by the new International Criminal Court.</LD>
<LD>   Though the United States did not secure the permanent immunity it
originally demanded, the unanimously adopted resolution "achieved the
kind of protection for a one-year period that we were seeking," said
John D. Negroponte, the U.S. ambassador here.</LD>
<LD>   The one-year period begins retroactively from July 1, the date on
which a treaty creating the international court went into effect. The
resolution states the council's intention to order further 12-month
exemptions each year "for as long as may be necessary."</LD>
<TE>   "We would have preferred that this protection were for an
indefinite period of time," Negroponte said. The U.S. "will use the
coming year to seek the additional protections we need," among them
bilateral pacts with countries where U.S. peacekeepers are based.</TE>
<TE>   "The president of the United States is determined to protect our
citizens--soldiers and civilians, peacekeepers and officials--from
the International Criminal Court," Negroponte added. "We are
especially concerned that Americans sent overseas as soldiers,
risking their lives to keep the peace or to protect us all from
terrorism and other threats, be themselves protected from unjust or
politically motivated charges."</TE>
<TE>   The resolution's passage, 15 to 0, erased a U.S. threat to block
U.N.-authorized peacekeeping missions around the world.</TE>
<TE>   The court was set up to try cases of genocide, war crimes and
gross human rights abuses that go unprosecuted by the suspects' own
countries. The U.S., which is not among the at least 139 countries
that have signed the treaty, believes that the tribunal steps on its
sovereignty.</TE>
<TE>   Supporters of the court here immediately decried the council vote
as an unwelcome and possibly illegal infringement of the new
tribunal's authority.</TE>
<TE>   "We think this is a sad day for the United Nations," said Paul
Heinbecker, the U.N. ambassador from Canada, a driving force behind
the new court. "We are extremely disappointed at the outcome. We do
not think it is the business of the Security Council to interpret
treaties that are negotiated somewhere else."</TE>
<TE>   But European council members, bruised by the hard-line U.S.
stance, defended the measure as a compromise that saved the
peacekeeping missions from diplomatic and financial abandonment by
the world's sole superpower.</TE>
<TE>   Council members "had to make a decision that preserved two very
important institutions--the newly born criminal court and its
integrity, and the peacekeeping missions of the United Nations," said
Jeremy Greenstock, Britain's U.N. ambassador, who was praised by
council colleagues and denounced by court advocates for his pivotal
role in securing the agreement.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. last week vetoed a routine extension of two U.N.-mandated
peacekeeping missions in Bosnia-Herzegovina after it was unable to
secure an exemption for U.S. personnel there from court prosecutions,
and it vowed to block other such mandates unless its demands were
met.</TE>
<TE>   Immediately after the adoption Friday of the resolution, the
council voted to renew the Bosnia missions.</TE>
<TE>   The resolution covers 16 missions that are led directly by the
United Nations, such as its police training program in Bosnia, as
well as the large forces in Bosnia and Yugoslavia's Kosovo province
that are authorized by the world body but deployed and commanded by
NATO.</TE>
<TE>   The U.S. has only about 700 police and observers assigned to U.N.
missions, but it has more than 5,000 combat troops with NATO forces
in the Balkans.</TE>
<TE>   European defenders of the resolution contend that it represents a
significant American retreat, with U.S. peacekeepers now shielded
from court action for a year rather than in perpetuity.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no preventive, permanent and general immunity, and this
for us is what is most important," said Jean-David Levitte, France's
U.N. ambassador, who until Friday had been the strongest opponent on
the council to the U.S. position.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. diplomats quietly but insistently challenged that
interpretation, saying Washington had achieved its main objective
here: getting council support for what they described as the first
stage of a campaign to protect all U.S. personnel abroad from the new
court.</TE>
<TE>   "This provides temporary immunity not just for the United States,
but for all countries that are not party to the treaty, and that was
important to us," said Richard C. Grinnell, the spokesman for the
U.S. mission here.</TE>
<TE>   More vociferously, many staunch opponents of the U.S. policy said
much the same thing.</TE>
<TE>   The scene outside the council chambers Friday featured the odd
spectacle of U.S. diplomats circulating copies of an angry
condemnation of the resolution issued by Amnesty
International--because the rights group also argued that Washington
had achieved most of its agenda here. The statement said the action
had circumscribed the new court's authority while setting a precedent
for further immunity guarantees for U.S. troops and officials
overseas.</TE>
<TE>   At the suggestion of Mauritius, the U.S. agreed to insert a clause
in the resolution stating that "if a case arises," the tribunal would
defer action for a year--a nod to critics who said the treaty
authorizes the council to suspend trials or investigations already
underway but not to preemptively block future court action.</TE>
<TE>   The change helped gain Washington several more votes, though not
all of its opponents were assuaged.</TE>
<TE>   "Practically speaking, this language is meaningless," said Adolfo
Aguilar Zinser, Mexico's chief U.N. envoy, who had spoken out
repeatedly against the U.S. initiative.</TE>
<TE>   Yet Mexico, one of the last holdouts, ultimately agreed to support
the revamped resolution, following what diplomats from both countries
described as intense American pressure. The U.S. and Britain had
already won the support of fellow permanent council members--Russia,
China and France--whose collective veto-wielding clout almost always
prevails in the body's deliberations.</TE>
<TE>   Under council protocol, minority dissidents normally are expected
to drop their public objections and permit approval of resolutions by
consensus.</TE>
<TE>   Outside the council chambers, however, as Aguilar noted Friday,
"the consensus in the United Nations is overwhelmingly against this
resolution."</TE>
<TE>   The chief objections raised by critics of the council action are
threefold.</TE>
<TE>   First, the resolution is seen by court defenders as an attempt to
amend the treaty, which precludes special exemptions for any groups,
be they U.S. peacekeepers or left-handed bookkeepers. "It is not
appropriate to create two classes of people under international law,"
Heinbecker said.</TE>
<TE>   Second, by "noting that not all states are parties" to the court
treaty and protecting only personnel from nonsignatory countries, the
resolution could be read as an endorsement of the American position
that the U.S. should not be subject to a treaty it refuses to ratify.</TE>
<TE>   But the court claims jurisdiction over everyone, including
citizens of countries that reject it. Otherwise, its architects say,
it would be impossible to prosecute state-condoned atrocities of the
kind that took place in Cambodia and Bosnia.</TE>
<TE>   "We are granting immunity to a group of people simply because they
have not signed the treaty," Aguilar said.</TE>
<TE>   Third, it is binding on all U.N. member states, under the terms of
Chapter 7 of the world body's charter, which can be invoked in
response to international security threats.</TE>
<TE>   Though U.S. officials convinced most council colleagues that the
terms apply to anything affecting the status of peacekeeping
missions, other diplomats and international law experts disagree. "We
have all been looking in vain to see what the threat to peace and
security could be," said Philippe Kirsch, Canada's deputy ambassador
to the U.N. and the head of a world body commission that is creating
the operating rules for the global court.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. diplomats here were careful not to publicly contradict
European assertions that the resolution incorporated major American
concessions.</TE>
<TE>   But the view of many experienced diplomats outside the council
Friday was that Washington had again asserted its dominance here.</TE>
<TE>   "This will be sold as a big compromise, but I hope the media won't
buy it," said Hans-Peter Kaul, a German Foreign Ministry official who
was here representing his government in organizing meetings for the
new world court. "This is still absolutely contrary to the treaty,
and it will have grave consequences for the legitimacy of the
council."</TE>

<HD>A Paradise Lost to Serbs</HD>
<DH>Balkans: Visitors are returning to Croatia's islands after
years of war. But for a former enemy, the tourist visas are out of
reach.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ALISSA J. RUBIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BRAC ISLAND, Croatia</DL>
<LD>After seeing the dazzling archipelago that lies off the Croatian
coast, George Bernard Shaw wrote that "on the last day of Creation,
God wished to crown his work, so he created the Kornati islands out
of tears, sand and breath."</LD>
<LD>   Sand and light breezes still bless the Kornati--which are only a
few of the nearly 1,200 islands and islets along the coast. But the
tears are shed by Serbs who no longer are permitted to visit
Croatia's shores, once their favorite retreat from landlocked Serbia,
the main republic of Yugoslavia.</LD>
<LD>   The absence of Serbs from the otherwise recovering tourist
industry in Croatia is one of the lasting scars of Yugoslavia's
1991-95 civil war, and it is a subtle but clear indication that it
will take many years for the different religious and ethnic groups in
the region to be reconciled.</LD>
<TE>   The tourism industry, which used to draw about 8 million visitors
a year, according to Croatian officials, was wiped out by the war and
only now is beginning to come back.</TE>
<TE>   But Serbs, who used to make up at least 20% of visitors, cannot
get tourist visas to travel to their Balkan neighbor. Even if they
could, they would not be wanted, Croats say.</TE>
<TE>   "Serbs would not be welcome here, after the damage they did," said
Vinko Bakija, director of tourism for Supetar, the largest city on
the nearby island of Brac. "People would not rent rooms to them.
Maybe they could find some family to rent a room, but then they [the
family] would have to worry about what their neighbors would say."</TE>
<TE>   Few people from the islands lost their lives in the war, but a
number of Croatian men went to fight on the front lines and there
appears to be a kind of collective memory of the wartime experience.</TE>
<TE>   "Although I was not in the war, I have some kind of bad feeling
toward Serbs," said Vinko Dubravic, 23, as he sat watching the
shimmering blue of the Adriatic from a seaside cafe in Supetar.</TE>
<TE>   "If someone said he was a Serb, I would look at him with different
eyes, and I think the majority of Croats feel that way," he said.
"There's still a certain hatred, a certain fire that has not been
extinguished."</TE>
<TE>   Ethnic Serbs in Croatia revolted when the republic declared its
independence from Yugoslavia in 1991, and with the help of the
Serb-led Yugoslav army, they seized a third of Croatia. There was a
particularly damaging assault on the walled city of Dubrovnik. Known
as the jewel of the Croatian coast, the city features 19th century
Austro-Hungarian architecture alongside earlier Italian Renaissance
buildings.</TE>
<TE>   Milo Razovic, who heads the tourism office for the province of
Split and Dalmatia, which includes many of the country's largest
islands, says he worries that if Serbs are allowed to come, there
might be a fight between Croats and ethnic Serbs.</TE>
<TE>   That would blot the country's reputation among tourists, so it is
better, he said, that Serbs not come--at least for the time being.</TE>
<TE>   "It could be that when someone hears a Serb accent, they move away
[instead of fighting], but it's also possible that there would be a
provocation and an incident, and then the place gets a bad
reputation."</TE>
<TE>   Despite talk of reconciliation, Croatia declined to issue the same
type of summer tourist visas to Serbs from Yugoslavia that Yugoslavia
has extended to almost all visitors, including Croats.</TE>
<TE>   For a Serb to obtain a visa to travel through Croatia, even to do
business in Zagreb, the capital, is extremely difficult. There is
just one phone number for Serbs to call for visa information and it
is usually busy, said Relja Bobic, a Serb disc jockey who often works
in Croatia and struggles each time to get a visa.</TE>
<TE>   The result is that for all practical purposes, Serbs can no longer
go to the Croatian coast. Even Serb tourists going to Italy, for
instance, end up traveling through Hungary and Austria, a route that
takes more than 12 hours, twice the time it used to take going
through Croatia.</TE>
<TE>   "We have started talks about the visa issue," said Goran Granic,
one of Croatia's deputy prime ministers. "But it will depend on
democratic developments in Serbia. Serbia has been isolated for a
long time and for a long period a chaos reigned there," said Granic,
who refused to say how long it might be before the two countries
normalized visa relations.</TE>
<TE>   War veterans, whose quasi-political organizations are strong along
the coast, are unequivocal. They would want Serbs to come back only
if there was a way to keep out those who fought in the war, said
Mirko Condic, who heads a veterans group.</TE>
<TE>   "I would want to see a kind of control so that those Serbs who
participated in the aggression could not come to Croatia," said
Condic, who has been in a wheelchair since fighting on the front
lines.</TE>
<TE>   Independent analysts say the government, a fragile centrist
coalition, has little interest now in reaching out to Serbs, because
its main concern is to ensure that it does not lose voters to the
nationalist parties, which rally the public in part with anti-Serb
rhetoric.</TE>
<TE>   "I would love for Serbs to come here like Germans, like everyone
else," said Viktor Ivancic, executive editor of Feral Tribune, an
independent weekly based in Split, one of the main embarkation points
for the islands.</TE>
<TE>   "But this is the atmosphere the government wants to create. They
need Serbs as symbolic enemies, they don't know how to function
without enemies. People have to hate somebody--otherwise they might
hate the government," Ivancic said.</TE>
<TE>   Although tourism is far better now than during the lean years when
the shells were falling on Dubrovnik and troops were mobilized
throughout the country, the number of visitors still hovers at about
60% of what it was before the war, said Razovic.</TE>
<TE>   Some people, especially in the tourism business, are open to Serb
visitors returning to the Kornati.</TE>
<TE>   Serbs tended to spend more than the so-called tomato tourists from
the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Hungary, who rent apartments and
bring their own sausages, tomatoes and other food to eat on the
beaches rather than going to restaurants. There are, of course,
wealthy visitors from those countries, but overall, people say they
need more "strong tourists," meaning ones with more money to spend.</TE>
<TE>   "As far as I see it, a guest is a guest," said Pero, a waiter for
more than 30 years in Supetar, who asked not to have his last name
used. "And each private person running a business, it's in his
interest to have someone sit down and have a drink and something to
eat, and it doesn't matter where he's from."</TE>
<TE>   As for the Serbs, they are beginning to realize how little they
are wanted in Croatia, and they have a sense of both regret and
resignation.</TE>
<TE>   "The Croatian coast is the most beautiful, and I always used to
have a great time there," said Tanja Miovanvic, 30, an architect from
Belgrade, the capital of Serbia and Yugoslavia. Now, she says, she is
afraid that if she went, she would get nasty looks as soon as people
heard her accent.</TE>
<TE>   "They think we are cattle; they don't want us to be there," she
said. "They would like our money, but only if we were invisible."</TE>

<HD>Bush Endorses Reform in Iran</HD>
<DH>Diplomacy: President expresses support for pro-democracy
activists after clashes with police and a leading cleric's
resignation this week.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ROBIN WRIGHT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>In an unusual warning to Iran's government, President Bush on Friday
issued a strong statement of support for that nation's reformers and
pro-democracy students and pledged that they had "no better friend
than the United States" in their efforts to bring about change.</LD>
<LD>   The White House statement was a direct message to both reformers
and hard-liners in the raging dispute that played out again this week
when the largest student protest in three years led to clashes
between demonstrators and security forces in Tehran, according to
U.S. officials. More than 140 people were arrested, Iranian media
reported.</LD>
<LD>   "As we have witnessed over the past few days, the people of Iran
want the same freedoms, human rights and opportunities as people
around the world," Bush said in the statement. "The government should
listen to their hopes."</LD>
<TE>   He charged that the "unelected people" who really rule Iran have
silenced or ignored the overwhelming call for reform evident in
recent presidential, parliamentary and local elections.</TE>
<TE>   In blunt language, Bush said the ruling Islamic clerics instead
have produced "uncompromising and destructive" policies and engaged
in harassment, intimidation and abuse to perpetuate their control and
reap "unfair benefits."</TE>
<TE>   "Iranian students, journalists and parliamentarians are still
arrested, intimidated and abused for advocating reform or criticizing
the ruling regime," Bush said. "Independent publications are
suppressed. And talented students and professionals, faced with the
dual specter of too few jobs and too many restrictions on their
freedom, continue to seek opportunities abroad rather than help build
Iran's future at home."</TE>
<TE>   The unexpected White House statement followed a leading Iranian
cleric's resignation this week from his religious post to protest
autocratic rule that he said has spawned corruption, despair,
political disillusionment, public rejection of religion and a
"hellish gap between rich and poor."</TE>
<TE>   "I flee what I can no longer tolerate," wrote Ayatollah Jalaleddin
Taheri, the Friday prayer leader in the city of Esfahan.</TE>
<TE>   Taheri has particularly high standing because he was a protege of
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini, who led the 1979 Islamic Revolution.</TE>
<TE>   In a thinly veiled warning, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei
said Friday that religious dissidents would face the same fate as
another leading cleric, who years ago was banned from all religious
activities and put under house arrest for criticizing the regime.
Iranian media reportedly were banned from publishing stories or
editorials about Taheri.</TE>
<TE>   After four years of a slow and tentative thaw in relations between
Tehran and Washington, Bush in his State of the Union address in
January listed Iran as part of an "axis of evil." The administration
has regularly charged that the Islamic Republic supports Middle East
extremists and is developing weapons of mass destruction.</TE>
<TE>   But Friday was believed to be the first time the White House had
openly stated support for Iran's reform movement.</TE>

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>LIMA, Peru</DL>
<LD>President Alejandro Toledo swore in a new prime minister and several
Cabinet members Friday in a bid to revive his sagging popularity and
calm turbulent political waters one year into his administration.</LD>
<LD>   Luis Solari, a key figure in Toledo's Peru Possible Party, was
named prime minister and chief of the Cabinet. He replaced Roberto
Danino, whose management was said to have alienated some party
leaders.</LD>
<LD>   Javier Silva Ruete returned to the post he had held twice,
replacing Pedro Pablo Kuczynski, a former World Bank official, as
economy minister.</LD>
<TE>   Toledo called the Cabinet overhaul "the first step in the
relaunching of the democratic government that I preside over."</TE>
<TE>   Many Peruvians have clamored for the president to fulfill campaign
promises of creating hundreds of thousands of jobs and revitalizing
the economy.</TE>
<TE>   Toledo also swore in Allan Wagner as foreign minister, a post
Wagner held during the 1985-90 government of Alan Garcia. He replaces
Diego Garcia Sayan.</TE>
<TE>   Wagner's appointment was seen as a bid to reach out to Alan
Garcia's Aprista party, the leading opposition force in Congress.</TE>
<TE>   The new Cabinet also includes Gerardo Ayzanoa as education
minister and Javier Reategui as transportation minister. Eduardo
Iriarte was appointed minister of production, and Ana Maria Romero
took over as women's minister.</TE>

<HD>Israel Walks a Fine Line With Plan for Bomb-Sniffing Dogs</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HENRY CHU</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>JERUSALEM</DL>
<LD>Taking a leaf out of the American police playbook, Israeli
authorities say they want to beef up their use of dogs to combat
terrorism in this frightened nation, and a Los Angeles resident is
ready to help.</LD>
<LD>   Public Security Minister Uzi Landau, who recently returned from a
visit to the United States, told Israeli media this week that
deploying more dogs to sniff out explosives and subdue would-be
suicide bombers would help save lives. Already this year, attacks by
Palestinians with explosives strapped to their bodies have killed
dozens of people in Israel.</LD>
<LD>   Landau said he is looking into importing such animals to augment
security forces' existing canine units. To that end, he has found an
ally in Glenn Yago, an economist and member of the Los Angeles Jewish
community. Yago recently started a group dedicated to raising funds
for buying and training police dogs for Israeli use, a project he
dubs "Pups for Peace."</LD>
<TE>   But as with many issues surrounding the conflict between Israelis
and Palestinians, the use of police dogs, though routine in other
countries, rubs against cultural nerves that already are raw from
nearly two years of deadly, open confrontation between the two
peoples.</TE>
<TE>   In this case, Israeli authorities are faced with sensitivities on
both sides of the divide.</TE>
<TE>   For some Jews, especially older ones, the sight of aggressive
police dogs straining at the leash recalls painful memories of the
Holocaust, of ghettos and concentration camps where Nazi guards used
attack dogs to intimidate, maim or kill.</TE>
<TE>   For Muslims, dogs are ritually unclean. To touch a dog on your way
to prayer is to suffer impurity, which only washing can erase.
Palestinians traveling to mosques under Israel's occupation in the
West Bank must sometimes cross security checkpoints where dogs nose
around for anything suspicious.</TE>
<TE>   "It's humiliating," said Adnan Husseini, head of a Muslim
religious affairs council in predominantly Arab East Jerusalem. "It's
a very bad feeling" to be forced into contact with a dog "while
you're going to meet your God and pray."</TE>
<TE>   Gil Kleiman, a spokesman for Israel's 26,000-strong police force,
acknowledged the tricky issues involved in deploying man's best
friend in a law enforcement capacity.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no question that that has come up many times, that the
dogs are a sensitive [point] with the Muslim community and the older
Jewish population," he said. "We find the balance."</TE>
<TE>   For example, canine units are not such a visible presence here as
they are in some American cities. "You won't find Israeli policemen
with dogs in their cars as you do in the U.S.," Kleiman said.</TE>
<TE>   The idea of helping Israeli security forces acquire more
crime-busting dogs hit Yago after a suicide bombing in March killed
29 Jews at a hotel in the seaside town of Netanya.</TE>
<TE>   Yago, 51, contacted the Jewish Federation of Greater Los Angeles,
which approved the idea through its Jews in Crisis campaign. Since
then, through word of mouth and fund-raisers, such as one scheduled
for next week in the San Fernando Valley, Yago's group has cobbled
together enough money to launch a pilot program to train and supply
dogs.</TE>
<TE>   Next month, 20 Israeli handlers are due in Los Angeles to work
with trainers and 60 dogs for two months. Then the handlers will
return to Israel with the animals for an additional month's training
at a center being prepared in the Golan Heights. The dogs are
destined for the Israeli police, the army and private security firms.</TE>
<TE>   "To do this right is not cheap," Yago said in a telephone
interview. He estimated that the cost of training each dog to sniff
out explosives runs about $10,000.</TE>
<TE>   "The basic question we've asked is, 'What can you do to stop
terrorism in Israel?' Well, there's very little you can do, but this
is a concrete step," Yago said.</TE>
<TE>   He added that he does not want the use of his specially trained
dogs to offend anyone's cultural or emotional sensibilities.
Particularly for older Jews, he said, the breeds of the dogs being
deployed are unlikely to evoke bad memories, as they are typically
not of the attack-dog variety.</TE>
<TE>   Tommy Lapid, a Holocaust survivor and a member of the Israeli
parliament, said he would support the increased deployment of
explosives-detecting canines.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a defensive usage of dogs, not an offensive and
aggressive usage," said Lapid, who lived in Hungary's Budapest ghetto
under the Nazi regime.</TE>
<TE>   "If you say that these are dogs that smell out Arabs, I would take
exception," he said. "But if you say that they smell out TNT, then I
support that.... It's a wholly defensive purpose, which is in saving
lives."</TE>

<DL>TORONTO</DL>
<LD>Garbage collectors ordered back to work under emergency legislation
began removing heaps of trash Friday in an effort to clean up
Canada's largest city before Pope John Paul II arrives this month.</LD>
<LD>   To end the largest strike by municipal workers in Canadian
history, the government Thursday approved a bill to settle stalled
negotiations between the city of 2.5 million people and its
employees.</LD>
<LD>   The strike began June 26, leaving uncollected garbage--in some
areas piled more than 6 feet high and stretching the length of a city
block--to rot and stink in hot summer weather. It also closed
swimming pools and day-care centers while reducing public health
inspections.</LD>
<TE>   In announcing the legislation that forces the workers back to work
while the labor dispute goes to binding arbitration, Ontario Premier
Ernie Eves cited the threat of a public health hazard.</TE>
<TE>   Local politicians also worried that Toronto's image would suffer
if the mess remained on the streets when the pope arrives for a week
of World Youth Day activities that begin July 22.</TE>
<TE>   Workers wanted guarantees of job security if the city contracted
out their work to private companies. Mayor Mel Lastman repeatedly
rejected their demands.</TE>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>ANKARA, Turkey</DL>
<LD>Saying that Turkey's teetering government has failed, former Foreign
Minister Ismail Cem announced Friday that he is forming a new
political party to topple the ailing prime minister.</LD>
<LD>   The announcement dealt a major blow to the rule of Prime Minister
Bulent Ecevit, who said he has no plans to step down. But three more
deputies deserted Friday, shaving Ecevit's majority in the 550-seat
parliament to 14 seats.</LD>
<LD>   "Turkey needs an effective administration," said Cem, who resigned
Thursday. Cem had been one of the government's most popular
ministers.</LD>
<TE>   "Because of its internal strife, the government has moved away
from being a ruling power.... It has become a structure which is
unable to take the steps needed," Cem said.</TE>
<TE>   Ecevit was widely regarded as the glue that held together his
three-party coalition. Since he fell ill in May, coalition members
have been divided on whether Turkey should move forward with reforms
aimed at meeting European Union membership requirements.</TE>

<HD>New Spin on Collapse of Jackson's Charity Project</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CHUCK PHILIPS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>From nowhere he emerged, an unknown in the music industry--with one
big exception. He was a friend of Michael Jackson.</LD>
<LD>   In the days after the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, F. Marc Schaffel
was traveling in new circles, assembling a choir of superstars to
sing with Jackson on a fund-raising single that would be sold through
McDonald's Corp. Jackson had made Schaffel executive producer.</LD>
<LD>   The singer's handlers were as bewildered as everyone else--so much
so that they set out to learn more about Schaffel. What they
discovered would trigger a major damage-control effort and bring a
halt to a project that some of the country's top performers had hoped
would help the grieving families.</LD>
<TE>   Schaffel, it turned out, was in the gay pornography business--and
Jackson's people did not want him linked to the self-described King
of Pop, whose legacy already was tarnished by allegations of sexual
molestation in 1993.</TE>
<TE>   Given the high stakes for Jackson--and the high visibility of the
charity project--his aides quietly asked Sony Music Entertainment
Inc. to bury the single, according to documents obtained by The Times
and interviews with those familiar with the deal. The record suffered
yet another setback when McDonald's backed out of a
multimillion-dollar proposal to sell it at its franchises, fearing
fallout from customers who would be unhappy with the chain's
association with Jackson, sources said.</TE>
<TE>   None of this, however, was mentioned last weekend by Jackson when
he blamed Sony Music for blocking the release of the charity single,
which is called "What More Can I Give" and features two dozen
artists, including Ricky Martin, Mariah Carey, Gloria Estefan and
Reba McEntire. Jackson accused Sony Music's chairman, Thomas D.
Mottola, of being a racist who not only had failed to release the
charity record but also had ruined sales of Jackson's last album,
"Invincible," because of poor marketing.</TE>
<TE>   Now, his highly publicized remarks, delivered at a press
conference in Harlem with activist the Rev. Al Sharpton, have
backfired.</TE>
<TE>   Had the singer not launched his offensive against Sony, the
details behind the collapse of the charity project might still be
under wraps. Instead, the music industry was abuzz Friday with the
latest bizarre twist in the singer's career.</TE>
<TE>   Some say that career is in decline. Nevertheless, Jackson remains
a powerful force in music. "Invincible," released late last summer,
topped the charts with 366,000 copies sold in its first week. Still,
sales quickly dropped and the album was seen largely as a
disappointment given Sony's $26-million marketing campaign. Its
sales, for example, were far behind the 1.9 million sold by 'N Sync's
"Celebrity" in its first week.</TE>
<TE>   Regardless, Jackson outsells many new acts and remains one of the
industry's biggest global stars. And few in Hollywood have Jackson's
clout or ability to assemble a star-studded cast such as the one
willing to contribute to the charity event.</TE>
<TE>   Now that the project has fallen apart, Jackson's representatives
are declining to comment except to say that when they and the singer
learned of Schaffel's background, they immediately broke ties with
him. Sony also declined to comment. A McDonald's representative said
an agreement was never signed to sell the charity single.</TE>
<TE>   Among the key players, only Schaffel is talking. And he says he
feels wronged.</TE>
<TE>   "I believe this charity single could still generate lots of money
to help those in need," said Schaffel, who has produced and directed
dozens of gay pornographic videos. "Why shouldn't it come out?
Because of something I did in the past? I mean, this is an industry
in which rock stars date porno queens. Adult film doesn't have the
same stigma it used to. So really, what's their excuse?"</TE>
<TE>   According to Schaffel, he and Jackson became friends several years
ago. The two are believed to have been introduced by a Beverly Hills
dermatologist.</TE>
<TE>   Schaffel said that even before the World Trade Center and Pentagon
attacks, he and Jackson began discussing the possibility of producing
a charity record to try to duplicate the success of the
Jackson-penned hit recording "We Are the World" in the mid-1980s.
This time, Jackson wrote the music and lyrics and signed away the
rights to Schaffel sometime before the terrorist strikes.</TE>
<TE>   "I am the executive producer of the project, which was financed
primarily by Michael," Schaffel said.</TE>
<TE>   That decision by Jackson left many in the industry puzzled about
why an entertainer known for shrewd deal making would simply give
away the song's rights to Schaffel. The singer never consulted or
notified his lawyer and manager that he had sealed the deal in a
written contract, sources familiar with the deal said.</TE>
<TE>   After the terrorist attacks, Schaffel said, he and Jackson decided
to transform the song into a 9/11 tribute. The singer informed his
inner circle about the project and introduced them to Schaffel, whose
attorneys suggested they try to land a corporate sponsorship from
McDonald's to help advertise and sell the song.</TE>
<TE>   Sony Music agreed to manufacture and distribute the single. It
would be released in two versions, one in English and one in Spanish.
Sony agreed to help Jackson and Schaffel recruit the performers.</TE>
<TE>   By Sept. 20, artists were lining up to donate their time, and
Schaffel was flying around the country in a Jackson-chartered jet,
stopping at studios in Miami and Chicago to record their vocal
tracks. According to Schaffel, the voices were mixed together later
and engineered with the two recordings costing about $3 million.</TE>
<TE>   "We did the entire thing very quickly and very cheaply--the way
that things are done in the adult film business," Schaffel said. "We
didn't waste money the way they do in the music business."</TE>
<TE>   By mid-October, Schaffel and his attorney had set up a meeting
with McDonald's marketing executives in a suite reserved by Jackson
at the Beverly Hills Hotel to work out the details of a sponsorship
deal. McDonald's thought it could sell 5 million or more singles in
its U.S. outlets and offered to pay an estimated $20 million for the
product.</TE>
<TE>   But after news of the possible deal leaked Oct. 13 to a New York
tabloid, McDonald's was bombarded with complaints from parents upset
that the family food chain would consider selling a single by an
entertainer who had settled a child molestation case. After
conducting an internal poll, McDonald's notified Schaffel it was
backing out.</TE>
<TE>   "We had the McDonald's deal 99.9% done while we were sitting at
the Beverly Hills Hotel," Schaffel recalled. "When the story leaked,
they weren't happy. They told us the factor that killed it was the
tight time window for delivering the product."</TE>
<TE>   By November, Jackson's advisors, curious as to how Schaffel had
obtained the rights to the charity single, launched an investigation
into the mystery producer's background. That is when they learned
that Jackson's new 35-year-old business partner was a producer and
director of gay pornographic videos. Schaffel appeared in at least
one of them.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson's advisors confirmed through public records that Schaffel
and his business partner, Paul Hugo, once owned their own adult film
house called Sosume Industries, which distributed movies made by
Schaffel through a subsidiary called Renegade Video. They also
learned that Schaffel operated several gay porn sites on the
Internet.</TE>
<TE>   "It's no secret that my background is in the adult film business,"
Schaffel said. "I've been doing this since I was 17. I've directed
lots of films, but I consider myself primarily to be a producer. I've
never hidden it. Everybody knows what I do."</TE>
<TE>   When asked whether Jackson was aware of his resume, Schaffel said:
"I'm not going to comment. You'll have to ask Michael that question."</TE>
<TE>   In mid-November, the charity project began to unravel as more was
learned about Schaffel.</TE>
<TE>   The entertainer's attorneys notified Schaffel in writing that
Jackson was terminating his contract because "information about Mr.
Schaffel's background, previously unknown to Mr. Jackson, [had] just
been discovered," according to a copy of the Nov. 15 legal notice.</TE>
<TE>   At the same time, Jackson's advisors, apparently without his
knowledge, began lobbying Sony Music to terminate the project.
According to sources familiar with the single's collapse, the
singer's advisors asked Sony to refuse legal permission for its stars
to appear on the record, essentially torpedoing the project--at least
until Jackson was able to recover the rights to the single.</TE>
<TE>   But Schaffel pressed ahead. He tried to stage a concert in
Washington to film a video for the song. Jackson did not show up.
Schaffel faxed a June 13 letter to Nobuyaki Idei, chairman of Sony
Music's parent company, Sony Corp., pleading for him to release the
single or allow it to be released through another distributor.</TE>
<TE>   "It would be a tragedy almost as great as the first one to let
corporate greed or politics stop the movement of people working
together in the healing process," Schaffel wrote.</TE>
<TE>   In the last several months, as Jackson's feud with Sony Music has
escalated, his fans have urged the company to do the "humanitarian
thing" and release the single.</TE>
<TE>   "If you ask me, I think there are people who don't want to see
Michael on top," Schaffel said. "I guarantee that this project would
be very successful and it would paint him in a different light than
how they want him to be seen. They don't want Michael to succeed. And
they're using my background as an excuse. I'm a scapegoat."</TE>

<HD>Attias Sent to Mental Hospital</HD>
<DH>Trial: Driver who killed four near UC Santa Barbara had
been found insane by a jury. Judge commits him to facility in San
Bernardino.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>WILLIAM OVEREND</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SANTA BARBARA</DL>
<LD>The David Attias murder trial came to an emotional end Friday with a
judge's tearful condolences and an order committing the onetime UC
Santa Barbara student to a state mental hospital.</LD>
<LD>   Attias, who killed four pedestrians last year by driving his car
into a crowd in Isla Vista near campus, will remain at Patton State
Hospital in San Bernardino indefinitely, trying to overcome delusions
so severe that a new report said he had come to believe that "the
world was a computer game."</LD>
<LD>   The former UC Santa Barbara freshman, who raged at bystanders
after the crash last year that he was the "angel of death," was
judged legally insane last month by a Santa Barbara jury.</LD>
<TE>   On Friday, he sat quietly in a blue sweater and wire-rim glasses
as Superior Court Judge Thomas Adams called the case a tragedy "that
has touched hearts throughout the nation."</TE>
<TE>   The jury on June 12 convicted Attias, 20, of four counts of
second-degree murder, later ruling him insane and setting the stage
for formal commitment to the San Bernardino facility.</TE>
<TE>   While noting that he would have sentenced Attias to the maximum
possible sentence of 60 years to life in prison if the defendant had
been found sane, Adams expressed sympathy for Attias and his family,
as well as for the families and loved ones of the victims.</TE>
<TE>   "I wanted to say to the parents of the victims, each of you have
constantly been in my prayers since that night" of the accident,
Adams said, tears beginning to well in his eyes. "The same holds true
for the family of David Attias."</TE>
<TE>   Turning and looking at Attias, the judge concluded: "Good luck to
you, Mr. Attias."</TE>
<TE>   The jury's verdict of insanity outraged many of the relatives of
the four people killed. They had hoped for life in prison, and
expressed fear that he could get out of a mental hospital much
sooner.</TE>
<TE>   Although Attias technically could begin to seek release in only
six months, defense lawyers Jack Earley and Nancy Haydt said he more
likely will spend most, if not all, of his life in a mental facility.
Many mental health and legal experts agree, saying a community
release, even years from now, would have to be approved by a judge.</TE>
<TE>   "His hopes and dreams are over now for any kind of a life outside
an institution," Earley said Friday. "But at least this gives him
some hope."</TE>
<TE>   Before Friday's commitment, Adams had ordered mental health
officials to evaluate Attias. The officials reported back to the
court that in a June 25 interview Attias had seemed lucid and aware
that he needed help.</TE>
<TE>   On medications since 11, Attias said he had stopped taking
anti-psychotic drugs because he wanted to be like other students. He
acknowledged that he had become delusional before the crash, the
report said.</TE>
<TE>   "He believed the world was a computer game and began to receive
messages from music and TV shows," the report added.</TE>
<TE>   It was 11:08 on a Friday night--Feb. 23, 2001--when Attias drove
his Saab down Sabado Tarde Road in the college community of Isla
Vista, smashing into the crowd of pedestrians.</TE>
<TE>   Those killed were Elie Israel, 27; and Christopher Divis, Ruth
Levy and Nicholas Bourdakis, all 20. A fifth victim, Albert Levy,
suffered serious injuries but recovered.</TE>
<TE>   Sanity was an issue from the beginning of the trial, during which
more than 100 witnesses testified, many of them saying the youth's
mental troubles had started in early childhood.</TE>
<TE>   As a boy, therapists testified, Attias would pound his head
against walls in anger. He tried to strangle his younger sister when
he was 13, they said. Ultimately, he received diagnoses ranging from
attention deficit disorder and bipolar disorder to budding
schizophrenia.</TE>
<TE>   His father, a successful television director, testified during the
first phase of the trial in late May, taking much of the blame for
ignoring years of warning signs that his son was in serious trouble.
He also said his wife had withdrawn from the boy's problems when he
was young.</TE>
<TE>   "I always hoped that everything was evolving and changing and that
he could move through it," Daniel Attias told the jury. "My goal was
always for him to get better."</TE>
<TE>   Despite his problems, David Attias was admitted to UC Santa
Barbara. But he was failing both academically and socially, and he
had asked his father if he could transfer to a community college. His
father resisted, later testifying that it was one of many decisions
he regretted.</TE>
<TE>   Meanwhile, the freshman's problems were increasing. He substituted
marijuana and cocaine for the medications he was supposed to be
taking. Fellow students said he became delusional.</TE>
<TE>   He had two auto accidents, only to be given a new car--the
high-powered Saab--by his father.</TE>
<TE>   "It turned out to be a horrific, horrific mistake," the father
said.</TE>

<HD>Blake's Lawyers Ask Appeals Court to Order Bail Hearing</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JEAN GUCCIONE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Robert Blake's attorneys have asked a state appeals court in Los
Angeles to order a bail hearing for the actor and direct the trial
judge to reduce the murder charge against him.</LD>
<LD>   Blake, 68, has been held without bail in Men's Central Jail in
downtown Los Angeles since he was arrested April 18 in the fatal
shooting of his wife, Bonny Lee Bakley. Bakley was killed near a
Studio City restaurant in May 2001.</LD>
<LD>   Defense attorneys Paul L. Hoffman and Harland W. Braun argued in
documents filed late Thursday with the 2nd District Court of Appeal
that Blake is entitled to a prompt bail hearing.</LD>
<TE>   "It is nonsensical to grant that the defendant has a right to a
bail hearing, but not establish a time frame within which the hearing
must be held," the attorneys wrote. "Under such a rule, holding a
bail hearing the day before trial would be permissible."</TE>
<TE>   Last month, Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Lloyd M. Nash
said he would set a bail hearing for Blake after a preliminary
hearing is held later this year.</TE>
<TE>   Blake, who starred in the 1970s television series "Baretta," has
pleaded not guilty to murder, two counts of soliciting murder and
conspiracy with the special circumstance allegation of lying in wait.
He faces life in prison without parole if convicted.</TE>
<TE>   The defense petition also urged the appellate court to direct Nash
to dismiss the lying in wait allegation by declaring it
unconstitutionally vague.</TE>
<TE>   Blake's attorneys accused prosecutors of charging Blake with the
special circumstance allegation for the sole purpose of keeping him
behind bars. Without that allegation, he would be eligible for bail.</TE>
<TE>   Jane Robison, a spokeswoman for the Los Angeles County district
attorney's office, said prosecutors have enough evidence to support
the charges against Blake.</TE>

<HD>2,400 Legislative Workers Go Unpaid as Budget Battle
Continues</HD>
<DH>Finance: Deadlock over new spending package forces the
state to miss $3.5-million payroll.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JULIE TAMAKI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SACRAMENTO</DL>
<LD>A deadline-breaking stalemate over a new state budget caused about
2,400 legislative employees to miss their first paychecks of the new
fiscal year Friday.</LD>
<LD>   Those who work for California's 120-member Legislature are always
among the earliest casualties of the Capitol's budget battles.</LD>
<LD>   Many unpaid employees are expected to take advantage of loans,
some interest-free, offered to state workers by banks and credit
unions.</LD>
<TE>   It's a hassle that the employees would prefer to skip.</TE>
<TE>   "A lot of people realize that's the way things work around here,
but in the backs of their minds it's kind of a bum deal," said Darrin
Lim, a spokesman for Assemblyman Roy Ashburn (R-Bakersfield) and one
of those missing his paycheck.</TE>
<TE>   "It just doesn't seem fair," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The office of State Controller Kathleen Connell confirmed Friday
that the employees' roughly $3.5-million payroll had not gone out.</TE>
<TE>   Connell previously had warned that some payments to local
governments also might be delayed, including certain trial court
payments due Monday.</TE>
<TE>   Gov. Gray Davis, state lawmakers and the rest of California's
250,000 employees could feel the squeeze at the end of the month,
when they are supposed to receive their next paychecks.</TE>
<TE>   The Senate approved a new spending package June 29 and sent it to
the Assembly, where Republicans are objecting to $4 billion in new
taxes and other revenue.</TE>
<TE>   The delay caused Davis to miss a July 1 deadline for signing a new
budget.</TE>
<TE>   Some Democrats also have taken issue with the plan, which they
contend does not contain enough new taxes.</TE>
<TE>   Some believe the proposed levies would be regressive.</TE>
<TE>   The Assembly's next session is set for Monday, but it is unclear
whether lawmakers will take up the spending package.</TE>

<HD>Rare Infection Kills 15 Cats, but Threat Eases</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LIZ F. KAY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A recent outbreak of a rare feline respiratory infection has killed
at least 15 cats in West Los Angeles but appears to be ending,
veterinary officials said. The disease poses no threat to humans.</LD>
<LD>   Since July 2, about 30 cats being treated for other illnesses at
three animal hospitals and one cat foster care program have been
infected with strains of calicivirus and half of them have died, said
Janet Foley, director of UC Davis' shelter veterinary medicine
program, which is investigating the outbreak.</LD>
<LD>   No new cases have been reported in the last week, according to
Mark Nunez, president of the Southern California Veterinary Medical
Assn.</LD>
<TE>   Respiratory infection caused by calicivirus is common for cats,
and veterinarians routinely vaccinate against it. However, these
mutated forms of the virus have affected even healthy cats with
up-to-date vaccinations.</TE>
<TE>   This cluster of calicivirus is 30% to 50% fatal and can be
transmitted between cats. People who handle infected animals can also
give the disease to other cats, Foley said.</TE>
<TE>   The mutant strain causes blood vessel inflammation. Symptoms
include swollen head and paws, high fever, and bloody discharge from
eyes, nose and rectum. Cats also show signs of respiratory infection,
such as sneezing.</TE>
<TE>   Those with mild symptoms usually recover within a few days. There
is no treatment for more severe cases.</TE>
<TE>   To prevent infection, Foley recommended that pet owners restrict
their cats' access to other cats by keeping them inside.</TE>
<TE>   Foley, an infectious disease consultant, became aware of the
cluster of infections July 2, when a West Los Angeles veterinarian
told her about a sick cat at a clinic. A shelter medicine
epidemiologist from UC Davis went to investigate and confirmed the
virus.</TE>
<TE>   After learning of the outbreak, hospitals isolated infected cats
to avoid transmitting the disease and took other steps to halt its
spread, officials said.</TE>
<TE>   VCA West Los Angeles Animal Hospital had one confirmed case of
hemorrhagic calicivirus, said Nunez, who is medical director at an
affiliated clinic in Burbank.</TE>
<TE>   The California Animal Hospital's department of surgery did not
accept cats the first week of July, to avoid infecting others, owner
Scott Anderson said.</TE>
<TE>   Nunez declined to identify the third clinic and the foster
program, at their requests.</TE>
<TE>   Veterinarians at Los Angeles County's Department of Health
Services said no cases had been reported at county animal shelters</TE>
<TE>   The county's Veterinary Public Health and Rabies Control Program
learned of the outbreak when a pet owner whose three cats had died
from the calicivirus reported it Monday, said Karen Ehnert, the
program's senior veterinarian.</TE>
<TE>   Only two other outbreaks of hemorrhagic calicivirus have been
reported.</TE>
<TE>   It was first identified in 1998 by Niels C. Pederson, director of
the Center for Companion Animal Health at UC Davis, when he found an
infected kitten in a Northern California practice. Investigators
believe that several cats in New York and Boston were subsequently
infected. Each incident appeared to peter out.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think that there is reason to panic at this point,"
Pederson said.</TE>
<TE>   If a pet owner suspects a cat is infected, veterinarians recommend
calling a clinic before taking the animal in. That way, the office
can properly prepare to isolate the cat.</TE>

<DH>Pledge: Long journey ends as frail Oxnard woman takes oath
in family's living room.</DH>

<LD>The judge was late. The translation of the oath into her native
Spanish was bad. She couldn't quite hear. And her knees almost gave
out at the end of the short ceremony.</LD>
<LD>   But holding up a shaky right hand, 79-year-old Mexican immigrant
Maria Coss Garcia was overwhelmed as she stood and pledged allegiance
to the country she has lived in for more than 25 years and became a
U.S. citizen in her family's living room in south Oxnard this week.</LD>
<LD>   Then she plopped back down on the sofa to rest.</LD>
<TE>   As part of a growing effort to help immigrants who are ready to
take the citizenship oath but are too ill or incapacitated to travel
to large swearing-in ceremonies in Los Angeles, a federal immigration
judge visited Garcia at home Thursday evening. The ceremony, which
was attended by a handful of Latino activists who helped her navigate
the citizenship process, was over in less than 10 minutes.</TE>
<TE>   "You've done it now, Mom, you've crossed over. You're American
now," said daughter Beatriz Rodriguez.</TE>
<TE>   "I know, mija. I'm happy. I can't believe it's over," Garcia said,
her eyes filling with tears in spite of her earlier predictions that
the day would be like any other.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a very important day for you. Congratulations," Lancaster
federal immigration Judge William J. Nickerson told Garcia after
administering the oath.</TE>
<TE>   Representatives of El Concilio del Condado de Ventura, a Latino
advocacy group, said Garcia had been trying to become a U.S. citizen
for almost five years.</TE>
<TE>   "She didn't think it would happen," said Alicia Flores,
citizenship coordinator for El Concilio, which became involved with
Garcia's case in 2000. "She had about given up."</TE>
<TE>   Garcia, who turns 80 on July 23, has had a life full of
disappointments and was ready for another letdown, Rodriguez said.</TE>
<TE>   "We told her, 'We started this, now we're going to finish it,' "
Rodriguez said.</TE>
<TE>   Garcia suffers from arthritis that limits her movements and causes
pain in her knees and fingers in cold weather, she said. She cannot
walk long distances and struggles to stand for long periods. She had
missed several INS appointments, which lengthened the process.</TE>
<TE>   "The good thing is we won't have to go around getting permits
anymore," Garcia said. Her fingerprints are worn so thin by age that
it took several visits to the INS office to properly record digital
reproductions for her citizenship paperwork.</TE>
<TE>   At her age, she spends most days reminiscing, she said.</TE>
<TE>   Born in Mexico in 1922, Garcia was married at 17. Unhappy in the
marriage, she eventually separated from her husband and went to live
with her other daughter, Alicia Garcia, one of her four children.</TE>
<TE>   During this time, the women bonded and Garcia helped care for her
grandchildren.</TE>
<TE>   She remembers those days as happy times when she could move around
and care for loved ones.</TE>
<TE>   In the early 1970s, Garcia moved to Oxnard to live with her two
children who had moved there. Meanwhile, Alicia developed stomach
cancer and died in Mexico.</TE>
<TE>   When Garcia returned to the U.S. after attending her daughter's
funeral, her arthritis worsened and today she does not move around
much.</TE>
<TE>   With her experiences and hardships, U.S. citizenship seemed like
an unattainable dream, she said, holding a U.S. flag left behind by
supporters.</TE>
<TE>   After taking the oath, Garcia immediately took advantage of her
new rights as an American. El Concilio officials helped her register
to vote on the spot.</TE>
<TE>   "I can vote from here," the new Democrat said, sitting on her sofa
surrounded by pictures of some of her 18 grandchildren.</TE>
<TE>   With mail-in ballots, Garcia can help elect the next U.S.
president, she said.</TE>

<HD>A Life of Ups and Downs, Then Fame</HD>
<DH>Aftermath: Mitchell Crooks stepped forward knowing it could
get him in trouble. It did. His mother and a best friend defend his
motives.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIKA HAYASAKI and ROBIN FIELDS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In the moments after he videotaped Inglewood police beating
16-year-old Donovan Jackson, Mitchell Crooks cried, disturbed and
horrified by what he had captured.</LD>
<LD>   Hours later, however, the down-on-his-luck rave party deejay was
all business, calling media outlets from 3 a.m. on offering to sell
the violent images.</LD>
<LD>   The way his best friend, Dan Hanna, tells it, a jumble of
impulses--some noble, others mercenary--drove Crooks' decision to
thrust himself and his video into the public eye.</LD>
<TE>   Crooks urgently needed a payday, Hanna said. Homeless, with a
hardscrabble resume that included a drunk-driving charge and a theft
from his own mother, Crooks had fallen far short of the success and
stardom he sought after moving to Los Angeles three years ago to spin
dance beats.</TE>
<TE>   But when the 27-year-old Crooks' celebrity instant finally came,
it helped land him in jail, drawing attention to outstanding warrants
stemming from a night of reckless behavior in February 1999.</TE>
<TE>   As the news storm he triggered raged on, prompting hundreds of
protesters to march on Inglewood City Hall on Friday, Crooks was
headed for a Placer County jail cell.</TE>
<TE>   Fueling the controversy, an Inglewood police report obtained by
The Times revealed that Jackson was punched twice by another officer
even before the action on Crooks' tape begins. The report also
described the youth as violently resisting police, a contention his
attorneys denied.</TE>
<TE>   Crooks could not be reached for this story. Hanna, his mother and
his attorney defended him, insisting that his arrest was retaliation
for his part in exposing police brutality.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a shame that the spotlight is going on my son, instead of
the videotape of this officer," said his mother, Patricia Crooks, in
a telephone interview from her apartment in Placer County. "This is
not how it's supposed to go down. He did something good and it's
backfiring on him."</TE>
<TE>   Crooks' sudden prominence came at the tail end of a two-month road
trip with his friend Hanna, 42. The same tape that shows the beating
also contains highlights from the pair's visits to New York, Chicago,
Miami, Dallas and other places, said Hanna, an out-of-work prop man.</TE>
<TE>   The two spent the last couple of weeks staying in cheap hotels in
Los Angeles. Then came the moment six days ago when Crooks heard
screaming, grabbed his $400 Sony video camera and recorded the
two-minute snippet in which a handcuffed Jackson, who is black, was
slammed on a squad car trunk, then punched in the head by a white
cop.</TE>
<TE>   Crooks knew that publicizing the tape could bring his
three-year-old charges of drunk driving, hit-and-run and petty theft
to light, but did it anyway because he thought it was right, his
mother said.</TE>
<TE>   She, of all people, knew her son was no angel: The theft in
question involved her. He took two videocassette recorders from her
home, intending to sell them.</TE>
<TE>   "He's done some bad things in his life," his mother acknowledged.
"I knew they were going to catch up with him. [But] he was more
concerned about justice. I know that about my son."</TE>
<TE>   Police at the Twin Towers jail in downtown Los Angeles, where
Crooks was held Thursday night, were quick to label his actions
opportunistic.</TE>
<TE>   "He is just getting an opportunity to get more publicity and
money," said a female officer who did not want her name disclosed.
She said he just wanted to "get rich off somebody's sorrows or woes.
It's like pimping."</TE>
<TE>   Hanna says Crooks was pleased when TV stations offered him $150
apiece for use of the videotape.</TE>
<TE>   Hanna also has been thrust into the spotlight by his friendship
with Crooks.</TE>
<TE>   Thursday night, CBS put Hanna up in the upscale Renaissance Hotel
at Hollywood and Highland after he agreed to appear on "The Morning
Show" to talk about Crooks.</TE>
<TE>   Still, some things counted more to Crooks than money.</TE>
<TE>   He told ABC he wouldn't give the network the videotape unless they
put Bill Maher's recently canceled "Politically Incorrect" back on
television, Hanna said.</TE>
<TE>   A Green Party supporter who adores Ralph Nader and hates President
Bush, Crooks also withheld the tape from CBS because he said it "blew
the [presidential] election" by calling a winner too early, Hanna
said.</TE>
<TE>   Ultimately, whether or not his intentions were pure, Crooks'
actions have brought what many consider an injustice to light.</TE>
<TE>   "His first instinct was to make sure somebody else saw what
happened," his mother said.</TE>
<TE>   "He always hated seeing the poor guy that's down, because he's
been down in his life. He's had troubles, too."</TE>
<TE>   Born in Auburn, Calif., Crooks was raised by a single mother in a
household almost always under financial strain. He met his father,
who left his mother when she was pregnant with him, just once, when
he was 9. He still refuses to talk about him, his mother said.</TE>
<TE>   Her son grew up independent and strong-willed, Patricia Crooks
said.</TE>
<TE>   He got into trouble as a youngster, when a scuffle with another
kid landed him in juvenile hall, Hanna said. Patricia Crooks said her
son was abused there, and it left an "ugly taste in his mouth" for
the police.</TE>
<TE>   "They pulled his hair," she said. "He had shoulder-length hair and
he had gotten mouthy with one of the guards. The guard decided to
take him down on the floor. I mean, the guard took a chunk of hair
out by the root. [He] had a bald spot on his head for months. It was
horrible."</TE>
<TE>   His move to Los Angeles was an effort to leave his youthful
missteps behind and start fresh, said his attorney, Dean Masserman,
who described Crooks as a "soft-spoken, gentle, socially conscious,
frayed-nerved young man."</TE>
<TE>   "He's been through a lot," Masserman said. "He comes from a very
small town where he didn't really like living, and he was trying to
make things better for himself [in Los Angeles]."</TE>
<TE>   But by Friday, stripped of the hero status he briefly held for
bearing witness to Jackson's beating, Crooks sounded vulnerable in a
message he left for his friend Hanna.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm really afraid," he told his friend in a call from jail. "I'm
really scared. They're going to take me back to Placer County so
Placer County can have their turns beating on me.... They've already
roughed me up. I've got scars. I've got bruises."</TE>

<HD>History Replayed for Drunk Driver</HD>
<DH>Sentencing: Man faces the same judge who 10 years ago gave
him four years for crushing a 12-year-old girl's legs with his car.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN JOHNSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BAKERSFIELD</DL>
<LD>James Kidwell, the most incorrigible drunk driver in the history of
this neighborly oil and "ag" community, was sent off to prison
Friday--again.</LD>
<LD>   And Anajean Zamudio, who bears the scars from 26 surgeries she
suffered after her encounter with Kidwell years ago, was there to see
him off.</LD>
<LD>   A strong sense of deja vu added to the drama that unfolded in the
courtroom of Judge Roger Randall. A decade ago, Kidwell had faced the
same judge, on much the same charge, while the public clamored for a
tough sentence to show him and other repeat offenders that they
wouldn't be tolerated.</LD>
<TE>   Not only had that case marked Kidwell's 10th arrest, worse, it had
nearly claimed the life of Zamudio, then 12 years old, whose legs had
been crushed when she was hit by Kidwell while pushing her mother's
stalled car. Randall had sent him to prison for four years, but that
wasn't enough for the public and law enforcement authorities. People
were so angry that they pushed for a new law toughening the penalties
against drivers who continue to drive drunk.</TE>
<TE>   Yet there was Kidwell Friday, back in court, being sentenced to
three more years with the public asking the same questions.</TE>
<TE>   "I never felt justice had been served," said Zamudio, standing
outside the courtroom. She had known the likely sentence would be
three years, the maximum under the circumstances, but she felt she
had to be there anyway. As she spoke, her balance was unsteady. When
she raises her long black skirt a little, the scarred and furrowed
tissues left after $4 million worth of surgical work become visible.</TE>
<TE>   "I still have a lot of physical problems," she said.</TE>
<TE>   Kidwell, a balding, unmarried 57-year-old mechanic, was arrested
for the 11th time on a charge of driving under the influence in
March. His white Ford pickup was stopped at 11:37 p.m. after officers
saw it weaving along Chester Avenue in downtown Bakersfield. He had
been out drinking with his girlfriend, he said. Though his blood
alcohol level was tested variously at .08 and .09--just enough to put
him legally under the influence--his long record exposed him to
prison time.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, the judge praised Kidwell, who stood slump-shouldered
in court, for pleading guilty rather than going to trial. He had done
the same thing 10 years earlier, and for the same reason, to spare
Zamudio and her family the pain of going through the events of March
29, 1992 all over again.</TE>
<TE>   "To his credit, he pled up," said Randall from the bench. "I'm
sure he must feel some remorse. The problem is, my primary duty is to
protect the public."</TE>
<TE>   Kidwell's first drunk-driving arrest, according to his probation
report, was in January 1972, when he was 26. He was given two years'
probation. In years following, he began piling up arrests as though
he wanted to be caught. He was arrested again in 1974, 1976, 1978,
1980, 1981, 1985, and twice in 1987. He served a total of about 1,100
days in jail. Luckily, no one was injured until the 1992 accident.</TE>
<TE>   Zamudio said her family had been going out to a McDonald's after
church that day, when their new Mustang convertible stopped running.
She got out to push from the back, while her mother and 14-year-old
sister pushed from the side doors.</TE>
<TE>   "I looked behind me and saw some headlights," she said. She didn't
think much about it. The next thing she knew she was on her back,
looking up at the stars. "I didn't feel the impact," she said.</TE>
<TE>   She remembers seeing Kidwell look at her lying in a pool of blood.
Then he went back to his truck and pounded on the steering wheel. His
blood alcohol level was .20, more than twice the legal limit.</TE>
<TE>   Zamudio almost died. She received 29 units of blood. Doctors in
Bakersfield considered amputating her legs, but she was flown to
Kaiser Permanente in Los Angeles, where surgeons managed to save
them.</TE>
<TE>   She was hospitalized six months and lost so much weight that she
was down to 72 pounds, 10 pounds of which were the metal pins holding
her legs together. "Words cannot describe" the pain she went through,
she said.</TE>
<TE>   Despite all of Kidwell's previous arrests, the maximum sentence at
the time for the accident was four years in prison, which Randall
imposed. But the case became a call to arms for local law enforcement
and the legions of people who followed Zamudio's progress. There was
a time, she said, when she could not go out in public without being
recognized.</TE>
<TE>   "I got letters from inmates offering to kill him for me," she
said.</TE>
<TE>   She didn't want that, but she wanted something more. She agreed to
testify in Sacramento for legislation that ultimately passed,
toughening penalties on repeat drunk drivers. Although she found it
intimidating, she emerged from her ordeal stronger and tougher. She
is now married, has a 2-year-old daughter and handles herself in
public with ease.</TE>
<TE>   Kidwell, on the other hand, though whole in body, looks defeated.
His attorney, Roger Lampkin of Taft, said the incident with Zamudio
had horrified him and caused him to change. Lampkin pointed out that
Kidwell had been clean for almost 10 years before his most recent
arrest.</TE>
<TE>   In fact, if Kidwell's arrest had occurred only one week later he
could not have been charged with a felony. Calling the 1992 case
"ancient," Lampkin said, "Another week and this would have been a
misdemeanor."</TE>
<TE>   He also argued that, had the defendant chosen to go to trial
instead of pleading guilty, he would have had a decent chance of
staying out of prison.</TE>
<TE>   "He gave up the right to go to trial because he knew the family in
the previous case was following this, and he wanted to get it over
with," Lampkin said.</TE>
<TE>   In the hall outside after the sentencing, Lampkin looked at the
cameras swarming around Zamudio and said he felt the punishment had
been "harsh, based on what needed to be done."</TE>
<TE>   Zamudio disagreed strongly. Ten years would be more appropriate,
she said. After all, she will be living with her disabilities the
rest of her life. She is still in pain; her right knee has fused so
that she can no longer bend it.</TE>
<TE>   She admits she's been changed by Kidwell's actions. She's no
longer the "sweet little girl" she was when she was 12. Asked why she
felt such a strong need to attend his court hearings all these years
later, she had trouble putting it in words. Part of it was trying to
get closure. Part of it was to see if he was truly sorry.</TE>
<TE>   In previous court appearances, Kidwell had tried to catch her eye
and smiled at her as if to say, "See, I pleaded guilty" for you. That
only unnerved her. She didn't want him to think it was only about
her. To her, it was about justice.</TE>
<TE>   On hearing the judge announce his sentence, Kidwell simply nodded
politely and sat down.</TE>
<TE>   Besides handing down the three-year sentence, Judge Randall
revoked Kidwell's driver's license for four years. He will be
eligible to get it back if he completes an 18- to 30-month Department
of Motor Vehicles relicensing program after his release.</TE>

<LD>Longtime friends Sandra Jaqua and Karen Cooper skipped breakfast
Friday and made an early stop at the bank. With cash in their hands
and comfortable shoes on their feet, they made their way to the
Orange County Fair's opening day.</LD>
<LD>   First up: the Home and Hobbies building to see the results of a
sewing competition Jaqua entered.</LD>
<LD>   "There are so many incredible pieces of work every year," Jaqua,
44, said. She entered an intricately designed red and gold
medieval-style coat called a houppelande. "Just to get honorable
mention would be cool."</LD>
<TE>   Jaqua and Cooper were among thousands who braved the heat for the
annual event's kickoff at the Orange County Fairgrounds in Costa
Mesa. Officials predict that this year's attendance for the 17-day
run will beat last year's record of more than 840,000.</TE>
<TE>   The two women walked past the brightly colored quilts, woodcrafts,
pastries and cakes before stopping in front of Jaqua's entry, which
won first prize in the adult party clothing division.</TE>
<TE>   "I was so excited," Jaqua said of her first glimpse of the bright
blue ribbon pinned on her entry. Even so, she said, "I still see a
few things I can fix" on the jacket.</TE>
<TE>   Jaqua has been coming to the fair for 20 years and says she tries
to dress up to match the fair's theme. This year's "Leap Into the
Fair--We're Making a Big Splash" slogan guided her into a shirt with
a blue, orange and green frog design and frog earrings.</TE>
<TE>   While arts and crafts aficionados inspected the winning entries at
the Home and Hobbies building, other fairgoers enjoyed the rides, the
games and the smell of Texas-style barbecue that filled the air.</TE>
<TE>   Angelina Ortiz, 9, made it to the top of a 24-foot rock-climbing
wall.</TE>
<TE>   "It's really fun," she said, "but I was sort of embarrassed
because my brother didn't make it and I did."</TE>
<TE>   Determined not to be outdone by his older sister, Davin Ortiz, 6,
climbed all the way up on his second try and pushed the buzzer at the
top of the wall to signal his success. "That was good," he said with
a big grin.</TE>
<TE>   Officials hope this year's fair will foster a sense of
togetherness while paying tribute to those who serve the community.
To help make that point, members of local police agencies, fire
departments and a contingent of 50 Marines from Camp Pendleton were
honored during the day's opening ceremonies. "We wanted to bring the
wonderful groundswell of community spirit that came after 9/11 and
bring that into the celebration," said fair Chief Executive and
General Manager Becky Bailey-Findley. "We wanted to honor those that
give selflessly, but also say, 'You know what? It's also time to
celebrate.' It's time to feel good about who we are, and a fair is a
good way to celebrate that."</TE>

<HD>Glendale Finds No Impropriety in Its Enron Deal</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KELLY YAMANOUCHI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>An internal investigation has determined that power traders for
Glendale's municipal utility did not knowingly participate in
improper electricity trading ploys with Enron Corp., an attorney for
the city said Friday.</LD>
<LD>   Officials disclosed May 31 that Glendale Water and Power had a
profit-sharing agreement with Enron, in which the now-bankrupt energy
company marketed the city's surplus power.</LD>
<LD>   State and federal investigators are examining whether Glendale and
other utilities were involved in schemes by Enron to create the
appearance of shortages to boost prices during California's energy
crisis in 2000 and 2001.</LD>
<TE>   The city's investigation, however, has concluded that Glendale
Water and Power had no improper involvement in the Enron trading
ploys, said Richard Marmaro, an outside attorney hired by the city.</TE>
<TE>   "What we have determined is that the city of Glendale did nothing
improper in these transactions," said Marmaro, a partner with law
firm Proskauer Rose who represents Glendale. "Power traders for the
city of Glendale did not knowingly participate in improper
electricity trading ploys."</TE>
<TE>   Marmaro said the city had given its findings to the Senate Select
Committee to Investigate Price Manipulation of the Wholesale Energy
Market. The city also plans to give the information to the Federal
Energy Regulatory Commission and Commodity Futures Trading
Commission, he said.</TE>
<TE>   State Sen. Bill Morrow (R-Oceanside) said the Senate panel had not
fully reviewed Glendale's findings and might seek testimony from
utility officials. He said there were still questions about
Glendale's relationship with Enron.</TE>
<TE>   "We're just not going to take [the city's findings] at its face
value," said Morrow, who is vice chairman of the committee.</TE>
<TE>   Glendale Water and Power generates power and provides electric and
water service to more than 78,000 customers. It had a profit-sharing
agreement with Enron from June 1999 to June 2000, in which Enron sold
Glendale's excess electricity and split profits, earning the city
$3.9 million.</TE>
<TE>   The utility also has been in a power marketing alliance with
Houston-based Coral Energy since August 2000, to make bids and
schedule energy with the California Independent System Operator on
behalf of Glendale.</TE>
<TE>   Marmaro said there had been no improprieties in that arrangement.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't believe we did anything wrong in our dealings with Coral
Energy as well," Marmaro said.</TE>
<TE>   Morrow's committee is investigating power transactions by about a
dozen California utilities, but has not reached any conclusions.</TE>

<HD>Theft, Disrespect Upset Graffiti Removal Workers</HD>
<DH>Crime: Up to $70,000 in equipment is stolen from project
employing former gang members.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ANTHONY McCARTNEY</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Johnny Ortega went to work Friday and confronted something very
familiar--disrespect.</LD>
<LD>   This time it wasn't about spray-painted gang names or taunts
yelled from passing cars. Friday morning's affront was all about what
someone did when he wasn't watching, something that couldn't be
erased by a coat of paint.</LD>
<LD>   Sometime between 8:30 p.m. Thursday and 4:30 a.m. Friday, most of
Homeboy Industries' graffiti removal equipment was stolen from its
storage area in an underground parking lot, leaving the 14-member
crew with plenty of paint but none of the gear that made it so
efficient.</LD>
<TE>   Founded and run by Father Greg Boyle, Homeboy Industries employs
former rival gang members in a variety of businesses, including the
graffiti removal project.</TE>
<TE>   The amount of pilfered equipment--six sprayer machines, two
color-matching machines, two paint mixers and an industrial
lawnmower--made the crew skeptical that it was the work of
neighborhood hoodlums. After all, the last time someone messed with
their storage area, they left a note--"Sorry homies; No disrespect;
We were drunk."--written on a nearby wall with a marker.</TE>
<TE>   Friday's discovery that $60,000 to $70,000 worth of equipment was
stolen won't cripple the 3-year-old program, but it reverted it back
to an older form of graffiti removal--buckets and rollers.</TE>
<TE>   "It feels somewhat intentional," said Cara Gould, the group's
operations director. "It feels like a disrespect of us."</TE>
<TE>   Respect means a lot in a community subdivided by no less than 10
gangs, each writing their name on buildings, walls, signs or trees
that provide a large enough canvas.</TE>
<TE>   Lately, gangs have started to leave walls alone, realizing the
futility of spray-painting a wall that could be color-matched and
repainted hours later. Gang members, the same who used to clash with
graffiti removal crews, now approach crews to ask for favors, such as
removing graffiti from their mother's house, said crew supervisor
Grant Oldfield.</TE>
<TE>   On July 1, the graffiti removal project doubled its crew and
coverage area to include all of Los Angeles City Councilman Nick
Pacheco's 14th District, which includes Boyle Heights, Eagle Rock, El
Serrano and Highland Park. Previously, the crew was responsible for
only half of the district.</TE>
<TE>   Pacheco said Friday afternoon that the equipment needed to be
replaced quickly, and he hoped a combination of city money and
donations could get the crews working efficiently again.</TE>
<TE>   Removing graffiti in Boyle Heights is about more than repainting
walls. "If one gang goes into another gang's neighborhood ... the
other gang is going to respond," Gould said. "Graffiti is a provoker
of violence between gang members."</TE>
<TE>   Ortega knows trouble happens when rival gangs cross out each
other's names on a wall. A former gang member, Ortega used to tag,
stealing spray paint from auto parts stores.</TE>
<TE>   Now 33, he left his gang eight years ago. In 1999, he joined the
graffiti removal team, working alongside men he used to hate because
of their gang affiliation.</TE>
<TE>   Ortega was one of the first to find that the storage area at 6th
and St. Louis streets had been burglarized. He kicked buckets and
cursed.</TE>
<TE>   By Friday afternoon, he surveyed what was left--"paint and a
couple of ladders."</TE>
<TE>   And of course, rollers.</TE>
<TE>   The crew could go back and do detail work, touch up spots it
missed, Ortega said.</TE>
<TE>   "If the wall's big, we have to roll it anyway," he said.</TE>

<HD>Rivals Go After Davis' Latino Support</HD>
<DH>Politics: Simon, Green Party's Camejo tell activists
they're taken for granted. Governor points to gains.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MATEA GOLD</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The two men hoping to unseat Gov. Gray Davis went after one of his
core constituencies on Friday, telling a group of Latino leaders that
Democrats have been taking them for granted.</LD>
<LD>   Republican nominee Bill Simon Jr. and Green Party candidate Peter
Camejo appealed for the votes of several hundred people attending the
annual banquet of the Southwest Voter Registration Education Project.</LD>
<LD>   Simon told the group that he would improve the state's school
system and promised to support a guest-worker program for illegal
immigrants, while Camejo said he would make buying a home easier and
fight for higher wages for low-income workers. During their remarks,
both candidates accused Davis, who spoke later in the evening, of
ignoring issues dear to Latino voters.</LD>
<TE>   The governor's aides predicted that Latino voters would stick with
Democrat Davis, who won 77% of their vote in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   "The bottom line is the governor has a very strong track record
with the Latino community," said Davis spokesman Roger Salazar,
adding that Davis has made it easier for families to get health
insurance and access to higher education. "That's going to carry the
day."</TE>
<TE>   The aggressive wooing of a group that historically has voted at a
fraction of its share of the electorate cheered activists seeking to
boost Latino turnout at the polls. Friday's banquet at a Universal
City hotel was designed to raise money for Southwest Voter's 2002
campaign, a nonpartisan effort to get 400,000 new Latinos to the
polls nationwide this fall--50,000 in California.</TE>
<TE>   Antonio Gonzalez, president of the group, said that Latinos think
independently, giving Republicans and third-party candidates
opportunities to make inroads into a traditionally Democratic base.</TE>
<TE>   "Does that mean that Latinos are going to vote for Republicans and
Greens in the majority?" Gonzalez said. "No, I don't think so. The
Democrats and Gov. Davis enjoy a huge margin in the Latino community.
The question is: Can they maintain that?</TE>
<TE>   "Let the competition begin," he added. "Our goal is to have all
parties support the Latino agenda."</TE>
<TE>   Emphasizing a commitment to education and small businesses, Simon
vowed to spend the rest of his campaign seeking Latino support.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm here to tell you that Gov. Davis is in for the fight of his
life in this campaign, because I intend to compete flat out, 100%,
for the votes of every single member of the Latino community in
California," Simon said.</TE>
<TE>   The GOP candidate noted his Catholic faith, shared by most
California Latinos, and spoke several sentences in carefully
enunciated Spanish. He said Davis has failed to improve the state's
schools, hurting many Latino children. And Simon promised to make
campuses the centerpieces of neighborhoods.</TE>
<TE>   He also said he would enforce a recently passed state law that
allows undocumented immigrants who have attended California high
schools to pay the same tuition at state colleges as other in-state
students. And he said he would support efforts to grant guest worker
status to illegal immigrants, setting up a system for them to stay
legally by obtaining green cards and ultimately citizenship.</TE>
<TE>   "Our society must recognize once and for all that we are a state
and a nation of immigrants," said Simon to enthusiastic applause.</TE>
<TE>   Not all of his comments were as well received. "Is anyone here in
favor of higher taxes?" the candidate asked, as he criticized the
governor's latest budget proposal, which would raise them.</TE>
<TE>   "Yes--for the rich!" shouted a table of Green Party members.</TE>
<TE>   Camejo, a first-generation Venezuelan American, excoriated Davis
for what he called "the decriminalization of corruption," accusing
the governor of taking unethical campaign contributions.</TE>
<TE>   The Green Party candidate said he would work to make it easier for
people to afford a down payment for a home and would fight to raise
the minimum wage. He also endorsed stalled legislation that would
allow immigrants to apply for a driver's license, as well as a
license amnesty for undocumented migrants.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to remember that those people we call aliens are the
people whose ancestors walked this earth 20,000 years ago," Camejo
said.</TE>
<TE>   He said he had a shot at winning broad support for his candidacy,
noting the large share of voters in recent polls who said they
disapprove of Davis' performance.</TE>
<TE>   And Camejo praised Simon for including him in debates, dismissing
speculation that Simon only wants him to take enough votes from
disgruntled Davis supporters to hand the GOP candidate a victory.</TE>
<TE>   "Bill and I are fighting for those voters, and he's stealing my
votes," Camejo joked.</TE>
<TE>   "During an address later that night, Davis touted a list of
accomplishments he said have benefited California Latinos,
punctuating his speech with Spanish phrases.</TE>
<TE>   "Education is my passion," Davis said, "so I have worked mightily
... to improve schools."</TE>
<TE>   And the governor said that because of his efforts, 300,000 more
Latino children were enrolled in the Healthy Families program, which
provides low-cost health insurance.</TE>
<TE>   His campaign also released a new Spanish-language television ad in
which Lt. Gov. Cruz Bustamante encourages voters to support Davis,
saying the governor fought against Proposition 187, which would have
slashed government services to illegal immigrants, and initiated a
new relationship with Mexico.</TE>

<HD>Hahn Unveils Plans for Economy</HD>
<DH>Finance: L.A. mayor outlines initiatives to improve the
quality of education, spend more money on housing and give tax breaks
to growing businesses.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TINA DAUNT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Los Angeles Mayor James K. Hahn outlined Friday an economic vision
for the city that calls for improving education, bolstering the stock
of affordable housing and easing taxes for new businesses.</LD>
<LD>   "Los Angeles is already an economic powerhouse," Hahn told members
of the Los Angeles Rotary Club. "But Los Angeles is also a city of
unlimited potential.... Our challenge is to foster this potential,
strengthen our economic foundation and provide opportunities for
economic growth."</LD>
<LD>   Making his first major economic policy speech since taking office
last year, Hahn stressed that education was central for financial
stability and future growth. He said he plans to form a task force
later this summer dedicated to finding ways to increase educational
opportunities for city residents.</LD>
<TE>   Hahn noted that Los Angeles has the "least-educated work force" of
any major U.S. city. One in 10 people in Los Angeles lacks a
sixth-grade education and one in four is without a high school
diploma.</TE>
<TE>   "We've looked at the numbers and it's very disconcerting," Hahn
said. "We must focus on developing our work force."</TE>
<TE>   He offered no immediate suggestions on how educational
opportunities should be improved.</TE>
<TE>   While his comments were generally well-received, some experts
stressed that it would be difficult for the mayor, who has no direct
control over the Los Angeles Unified School District, to fix problems
such as overcrowded campuses and low reading scores.</TE>
<TE>   The mayor, who is battling secession efforts in the San Fernando
Valley and Hollywood, also outlined a number of other initiatives,
many of them already underway, to help improve the city's economic
future and make Los Angeles "a more friendly place to do business."</TE>
<TE>   They include:</TE>
<TE>   * Setting up a $100-million housing trust fund to help develop
affordable housing in the city, an initiative that was announced
earlier this year. More money would also be spent to help first-time
home buyers finance their purchases. "I directed the Los Angeles
Housing Department to put more money than ever before into
homeownership programs--over $11 million, benefiting over 200 new
homeowners, more than in the last previous three years combined,"
Hahn said.</TE>
<TE>   * Streamlining the city's tax structure on the basis of
recommendations by the Business Tax Advisory Committee, which is
expected to submit its plan in the next 30 days. "We have already
taken a number of steps to improve and simplify our tax procedures,"
Hahn said. "This includes a two-year waiver of business taxes to new
firms earning less than $500,000 in revenues annually."</TE>
<TE>   * Reforming the city's real estate development process by
streamlining building permits and overhauling plan checks and
inspection efforts to reduce duplications.</TE>
<TE>   * Helping businesses expand by encouraging them to take advantage
of federal Small Business Administration loans and other governmental
programs. "People often ask about bringing more Fortune 500 companies
to Los Angeles," Hahn said. "While such opportunities may arise, my
primary focus is on developing and growing businesses already here in
Los Angeles."</TE>
<TE>   On the education front, Hahn said, he plans to form a task force
of leaders from education, business, unions, religion, nonprofits,
and government to collaborate on increasing learning and literacy in
Los Angeles. He declined to comment directly on the performance of
the Los Angeles Unified School District.</TE>
<TE>   "We first must see who is and is not literate in L.A., and to come
up with solutions to plug the gaps," he said. "We need to expose our
youth to career opportunities and help those short on resources find
a way to go to college."</TE>
<TE>   Hahn said he had been especially dismayed to learn recently that,
even by the third generation, more than three-quarters of Latinos in
Los Angeles are not earning college decrees. "Nearly three-quarters
of kids in LAUSD are Latino," Hahn noted.</TE>
<TE>   "Education and economic expansion have never been closer allies.
The future belongs to the educated, and central to my growth strategy
for Los Angeles is the creation of a tech-savvy, education-minded
work force," Hahn said.</TE>
<TE>   While Hahn's comments--some of his strongest to date--received
high marks from community leaders, one political pundit questioned
whether the mayor could make a difference in improving the quality of
education in the city.</TE>
<TE>   "This isn't New York," said Steven Erie, a UC San Diego political
science professor, who is writing a book on Los Angeles politics.
"The mayor doesn't have control over education in the city.
Basically, all you have is a bully pulpit, and that's what he's
using."</TE>
<TE>   But Los Angeles Police Department Assistant Chief David Gascon,
who attended the speech, said he believed the mayor's efforts could
serve as a catalysis for change. "Education is the basic foundation
of everything," Gascon said. "It's the foundation of our free
society. It's what drives industry. It's what make a community
prosperous."</TE>
<TE>   Caprice Young, president of the school district's Board of
Education, also praised Hahn's efforts.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm really excited about it," she said. "An educated work force
is the heart of economic development.... I really think Los Angeles
needs to come together to support education. This is the start of
that."</TE>

<PH>THE INGLEWOOD BEATING</PH>
<KH></KH>
<HD>Youth Was Punched by a Second Officer</HD>
<DH>Investigation: Blows were struck before the events recorded
on a widely publicized videotape, an Inglewood police incident report
reveals.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BETH SHUSTER and NICHOLAS RICCARDI</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The partner of Inglewood Police Officer Jeremy Morse twice punched
16-year-old Donovan Jackson before the suspect was handcuffed and a
bystander shot the now-infamous videotape of Morse hitting him,
according to a report signed by both officers.</LD>
<LD>   The report, obtained Friday by The Times, describes the moments
before Jackson, who is black, was slammed into the trunk of a police
car and then punched in the face by Morse, who is white. Images of
that incident, aired repeatedly on local and national television,
have helped generate investigations by the Inglewood police, Los
Angeles County sheriff's officials, the district attorney's office
and the U.S. Justice Department.</LD>
<LD>   "I yelled at Jackson to let go of my uniform; however, he
refused," Inglewood Officer Bijan Darvish, who is white, states in
the report also signed by Morse. "Fearing that Jackson would pull me
into him and strike me with his other hand, I punched him two times
in the face, using my right hand."</LD>
<TE>   Those additional details emerged as a coalition of ministers and
activists called for an overhaul of the Inglewood Police Department
to give civilians more control over the force, and hundreds of
protesters marched on Inglewood City Hall, demanding that the
officers be fired immediately.</TE>
<TE>   "If you don't get rid of these rogue officers," said Najee Ali of
Project Islamic HOPE, "we'll get rid of you."</TE>
<TE>   The encounter occurred last Saturday evening when Jackson and his
father, Coby Chavis, were at an Inglewood gas station and two
sheriff's deputies stopped to investigate Chavis' expired vehicle
registration tags. Jackson was leaving the station's market, holding
a bag of potato chips, when he saw the deputies talking to his
father.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson tried to get into his father's car, ignoring deputies'
commands to wait while they questioned Chavis, according to the
officers and deputies. Deputy Carlos Lopez tried to get Jackson to
sit in the patrol car, Lopez said in his report, adding that the
youth then lunged at him.</TE>
<TE>   The Inglewood report echoes those observations and says Morse and
Darvish arrived at the gas station as backup and immediately assisted
Lopez after Jackson cried, "I'm not getting in the car! I'm not
getting in the car!" and lunged at the deputy. The Inglewood officers
wrote that they saw Jackson hit the deputy, so they grabbed his arms
and pulled him to the ground.</TE>
<TE>   Jackson struggled and flipped onto his back, the report says. He
grabbed at Morse's shirt and scratched him once above his ear, then
on the neck, the document says. Next, the report states that the boy
grabbed Darvish by the shirt and started pulling him down. Darvish
could not "get a wristlock" on Jackson, who reportedly continued to
swing at the officer.</TE>
<TE>   It was at that point that Darvish punched Jackson, according to
the officer's account. Still, the officers said that did not subdue
the boy.</TE>
<TE>   At that point, Inglewood Officer Mariano Salcedo grabbed the boy's
legs, along with Officer Antoine Crook. All four officers then helped
handcuff Jackson, the report says.</TE>
<TE>   Morse then grabbed the boy and lifted him off the ground, the
point at which the videotape begins.</TE>
<TE>   On the tape, Morse is seen slamming Jackson onto the car. The
report describes that event only by saying Morse "assisted Jackson to
his feet and had him stand facing the police vehicle."</TE>
<TE>   As The Times reported Thursday, Morse says the handcuffed Jackson
then grabbed the officer's testicles. Because of Morse's "extreme
pain," the officer says, he hit Jackson in the face, and the youth
let go.</TE>
<TE>   Joe Hopkins, an attorney for Jackson's family, said Friday that he
was skeptical of the police version of the incident and charged that
all four Inglewood officers "took turns" beating Jackson before the
tape rolled.</TE>
<TE>   "He sees the four officers running towards him," Hopkins said. "He
stands up. He is grabbed by the throat to hold him back, and the
other four officers take turns hitting him."</TE>
<TE>   When the officers threw him to the ground, Hopkins said, they
continued to beat him, pulling him by a necklace he wore and kneeing
him.</TE>
<TE>   "What we see on the tape is the second beating," he said.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, the lawyer said, he received a letter from attorney
Milton Grimes stating that he had been retained to represent the
Jackson family. Grimes took over Rodney G. King's civil case against
the city of Los Angeles after King's beating by police in 1991.
Grimes did not return calls seeking comment Friday.</TE>
<TE>   Neither Darvish nor his representatives could be reached for
comment Friday. John Barnett, a lawyer representing Morse, said the
account by his client and Darvish "puts into context some of the
subsequent action. It is significant ... but more in terms of
context.''</TE>
<TE>   For the demonstrators at City Hall, their anger was focused on
what they saw on the videotape, particularly the images of officers
roughly handling a boy who already was in handcuffs.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to know precisely, exactly, what kind of threat a
16-year-old teenager, eating a bag of chips, poses to armed and
trained police officers," said Thandi Chimurensa, who said she
represented Jackson's family.</TE>
<TE>   Kim Mitchem, 42, said she had "always been proud to be an
Inglewood resident. I always thought [Inglewood police] were a cut
above. [Now] I have to take them off the pedestal."</TE>
<TE>   A steady stream of activists--including comedian Dick Gregory and
Martin Luther King III--inched through a thick crowd to speak before
a battery of cameras and reporters.</TE>
<TE>   Speakers vented their rage at authorities over both the Jackson
beating and the fate of the man who recorded it, 27-year-old Mitchell
Crooks, who was arrested Thursday outside CNN studios in Hollywood on
outstanding warrants for burglary and a 5-year-old hit-and-run
accident.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, Crooks was transferred from Los Angeles to Placer
County, where the warrants originated.</TE>
<TE>   Chimurensa said she holds Los Angeles County Dist. Atty. Steve
Cooley responsible for Crooks' well-being. And Gregory quipped: "If
you want Bin Laden arrested, we've got a formula: Let him take some
pictures of a cop beating up black people, and they'll put him in
jail."</TE>
<TE>   The demonstrators made a circuit of Inglewood's government plaza.
A sprinkling of officials from the U.S. Justice Department's civil
rights division and the county's Human Relations Commission monitored
the protest. Observers estimated the crowd at 400 to 500. Several
drivers passing by honked in support of the protesters. When the
crowd arrived at City Hall, it found a locked door. A sign posted
there said that the city offices were closed for the day.</TE>
<TE>   A few protesters banged on the windows before the group turned and
assembled in a courtyard near City Hall and police headquarters.</TE>
<TE>   Demonstrators said they were impatient with the speed of the
investigations. They shouted down a representative from county
Supervisor Yvonne Brathwaite Burke's office who assured them that
authorities would probe the incident. "We don't trust them!" the
crowd cried. "Arrest them!"</TE>
<TE>   Cooley said Friday that the county grand jury will continue to
hear evidence on the case next week. He said his prosecutors are
using that panel because it gives them a powerful tool with which to
obtain sworn accounts of the incident.</TE>
<TE>   "We believe this is important for a variety of communities: the
community of Inglewood, the law enforcement community and the
community at large," Cooley said. "Everyone benefits when the system
works accurately and as quickly as possible."</TE>
<TE>   He added that Inglewood police, in conversations Monday, told
prosecutors that they believed one of their own may have broken the
law. Police Chief Ronald Banks has asked city officials and others to
withhold judgment, but Mayor Roosevelt Dorn has called for Morse to
be fired and prosecuted.</TE>
<TE>   The Justice Department is also investigating the incident, having
dispatched its top civil rights official, Assistant Atty. Gen. Ralph
Boyd, to Inglewood on Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Boyd, who has returned to Washington, said in an interview Friday
that the district attorney's office would take the lead in the
initial criminal investigation and that federal civil rights charges
could follow. He also said he was encouraged to find Inglewood
relatively calm, unlike Cincinnati, where riots followed the shooting
of an unarmed black man by police last year.</TE>
<TE>   "My impression from afar, and now up close a little bit, is that
people feel very comfortable with their leadership, although there's
obviously appropriate concern about this incident," Boyd said. "To
the extent there were people who were impatient with the legal
process, they seemed to be outsiders. The local folks seem to have
confidence in the process."</TE>
<TE>   At Inglewood's First Church of God, a group of ministers led by
the Rev. Norman Johnson of the Southern Christian Leadership
Conference of L.A. called on the city to establish a civilian panel
to oversee police actions, review the current civilian complaint
process and remove police from the street when complaints are filed.</TE>
<TE>   Bishop Kenneth Ulmer, pastor of Faithful Central Bible Church,
said the Jackson incident "is an issue beyond politics, race and
color. It involves justice."</TE>
<TE>   Mayor Dorn said he would consider the recommendations and added
that "one or two other cases" involving Officer Morse "have been
ordered reopened." Dorn said those cases of alleged use of excessive
force, including one in 2001, "had not reached the level of the city
administrator," and that "one was not actually closed." He refused to
elaborate.</TE>
<TE>   Times staff writers Daren Briscoe, Anna Gorman, Peter Y. Hong and
Richard Winton in Los Angeles and Eric Lichtblau in Washington

<LD>The end of the annual strawberry harvest idled thousands of farm
workers last month and helped push Ventura County's June unemployment
rate to 4.8%, the highest level since January.</LD>
<LD>   But an increase in nonfarm jobs--including gains in government,
education, construction and retail employment--added 1,400 workers
and offset the agriculture losses of 3,900, for a total countywide
decline of 2,500 jobs in June.</LD>
<LD>   Although the jobless rate surged from 4.3% to 4.8% from May to
June, it was still better than the 5.5% reported at the beginning of
the year.</LD>
<TE>   "You get these seasonal effects that really have no economic
meaning," said economist Mark Schniepp, director of the California
Economic Forecast in Santa Barbara.</TE>
<TE>   "A rate of 4.8% is still considered full employment in Ventura
County. What that tells me is that if you want a job, you can get
one," Schniepp said.</TE>
<TE>   Comparing last month with June 2001, when unemployment stood at
4.1%, the total number of jobs in the county grew by 900, and 400 of
those were in agriculture.</TE>
<TE>   Hiring at Cal State Channel Islands in Camarillo, which formally
begins offering classes next month, added 200 people to local
payrolls in the past year and local schools added 500 more since June
2001. The state picked up 100 new workers and county government
expanded by 300 people.</TE>
<TE>   "We seem to be heading in the right direction. We're growing
again, although it's slow growth and it's pretty steady," said
Schniepp, adding that such gains are amazing "when you consider the
lack of housing, especially affordable housing, in the county."</TE>
<TE>   The number of county residents employed here and in other counties
was 403,600 last month, up from 399,000 in January. The number of
unemployed local residents dropped to 20,400 from 23,300 in January.</TE>
<TE>   Bill Watkins, executive director of UC Santa Barbara's Economic
Forecast Project, said Ventura County's economy is "right on track"
and that a monthly spike in joblessness is no cause for concern.</TE>
<TE>   "That's about what we expected," Watkins said. "Once it's
seasonably adjusted, I don't think you'll see any real increase in
unemployment."</TE>
<TE>   The county ranks 14th in terms of joblessness among the state's 58
counties. San Luis Obispo is No. 1 at 3.1% and Santa Barbara County
No. 2 at 3.5%. Ventura County's 4.8% rate puts it ahead of Riverside
and San Bernardino counties, both at 5.7%, and Los Angeles County at
7.1%.</TE>
<TE>   By comparison, California's unemployment rate in June was 6.4%,
and the U.S. rate was 6%, without seasonal adjustments.</TE>
<TE>   Through the end of the year, Watkins said he expects the nation to
continue its gradual recovery from a recession that never really
touched Ventura County.</TE>
<TE>   Watkins predicted that the Federal Reserve Board will impose a
modest interest rate increase before January "but not by much,
because the data is not coming in that strong."</TE>
<TE>   A closer look at county unemployment last month shows a wide
discrepancy among communities.</TE>
<TE>   In the east county, joblessness ranged from 3.6% in Moorpark to 4%
in Thousand Oaks and 4.2% in Simi Valley. But in less affluent west
county communities, joblessness reached 6.9% in Oxnard, 7.8% in Santa
Paula and 9.4% in El Rio.</TE>

<HD>Juvenile Hall Writing Class Gives Troubled Youths a
Creative Outlet</HD>
<DH>Services: The program launched at three area facilities by
a children's author aims to foster self-expression without passing
judgment.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL KRIKORIAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If you had 15 minutes to address the world, what would you say?</LD>
<LD>   Author Karen Hunt presented the premise to a group of students in
Van Nuys some years back. One girl's response changed Hunt's life.</LD>
<LD>   "Well, there's a shoe sale at Nordstrom, and we all need shoes, so
we should go out and buy some. And, oh yeah, there's all these people
starving in the world, and we should feed them, I guess," the girl
said.</LD>
<TE>   After hearing that, Hunt, who has written 21 children's books,
decided to spend time with unfortunate youth and developed the idea
for a writing class at Juvenile Hall.</TE>
<TE>   In 1999, she launched InsideOUT Writers to encourage and teach
writing to youths incarcerated at Juvenile Halls in Sylmar, Downey
and Central Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   More than 100 youths are currently in the program, which meets
twice a week for two hours. Some of their work has been collected in
a book, "What We See," published by the Alethos Foundation of
Calabasas.</TE>
<TE>   One enthusiastic participant, a Pacoima teenager held at the Barry
J. Nidorf Juvenile Hall in Sylmar who is soon to be transferred to an
adult facility, lamented having to leave the writing program behind.</TE>
<TE>   "I really like this class and I'm going to miss it, but I'm going
to keep on writing wherever they send me," said convicted kidnapper
Jose de la Torre, 18, who will be sent to state prison or the
California Youth Authority when he is formally sentenced on Aug. 5.
"The writing keeps me busy, keeps me out of trouble. I could be
gang-banging in here."</TE>
<TE>   On a recent Friday evening, 12 young people--charged or convicted
of crimes ranging from carjacking to murder--gathered in a semicircle
in a gymnasium to write and read and occasionally take in some advice
from Hunt and another teacher, Marilyn Morton.</TE>
<TE>   When asked individually about the program, 11 of the 12 began
their review identically: "It's cool."</TE>
<TE>   One writer, a 17-year-old Athens Park boy accused of murder, read
an essay about growing up in a gang-infested South Los Angeles
neighborhood.</TE>
<TE>   "Why I had to live in a place like that, I don't know," he read
loudly, his face staring down hard at his paper. "I tried to avoid
it, but it was hard. They just kept coming and coming. I told my mom
about it, but we didn't have enough money to move, so I started to go
around the other way."</TE>
<TE>   The young man's mother, Shelly Warren, said that even though he is
possibly facing life in prison, her son often talks about his
writing.</TE>
<TE>   "I think it's great for him," she said. "I'm glad he's in that
program. I'm behind him 100%."</TE>
<TE>   Hunt said that a nun, Sister Janet Harris, a social worker who
deals with gang members, initially introduced her to Juvenile Hall,
which inspired her to create the program.</TE>
<TE>   "I was raised to make a difference," said Hunt, 46, whose pen name
is Karen Mezek Leimert. "I wanted to get them interested for
themselves, get them excited about what they value."</TE>
<TE>   What the youths wrote surprised her.</TE>
<TE>   "I was blown away hearing about these girls who looked so tough
that I'd be horrified if I passed them on the street. But they had
these amazing stories," said Hunt, who has assembled a group of
professional writers to volunteer their services for the program. One
is John Horn, who covers the motion picture industry for Newsweek
magazine.</TE>
<TE>   "What the program tries to do is impose a little form and
structure as a means of expression," said Horn, who has been teaching
in the program for two months.</TE>
<TE>   Horn said he was hooked after sitting in on a Central Juvenile
Hall class taught by a friend.</TE>
<TE>   "These kids have generally had very few adult figures that have
helped them without judging or punishing them," said Horn, adding
that the program has no grades or tests.</TE>
<TE>   "Some of the writing is advanced and well thought out, but all of
it is extremely heartfelt. These are kids who have gone through more
bad times than many adults. If they can tap into the bad experiences,
they will have a lot to say."</TE>

<HD>'Suge' Knight Gets IRS Notice to Pay $6 Million</HD>
<DH>Bill: The rap mogul is told he owes personal income taxes.
The news adds to the turmoil around the owner of Tha Row Records.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JENNIFER SINCO KELLEHER</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Rap mogul Marion "Suge" Knight received notice this week from the
Internal Revenue Service, claiming he owes about $6 million in
personal income taxes, his attorney said Friday.</LD>
<LD>   The IRS notice adds to the financial turmoil surrounding the owner
of music label Tha Row Records, formerly known as Death Row Records.
It comes just months after Knight's former lawyer, David Kenner, was
sentenced to three years' probation in April after he admitted to
hiding more than $4 million in earnings from the IRS.</LD>
<LD>   In January, Death Row pleaded guilty to misdemeanor tax charges
that the company failed to submit an income tax return, which
appeared to end a racketeering investigation launched in 1995 by
local and federal authorities. The probe included allegations that
Knight and his label committed drug trafficking, money laundering and
violent acts.</LD>
<TE>   Knight's new lawyer, Arthur Barens, said this week's collection
claim is for taxes allegedly owed in 1997 and appears to concern a
period during which the 37-year-old rap impresario was in prison.</TE>
<TE>   Knight served a five-year sentence beginning in 1996 for violating
probation on a previous conviction involving a fight at a Las Vegas
hotel--a scuffle that took place hours before rap star Tupac Shakur
was shot to death.</TE>
<TE>   "We don't have the collateral information to evaluate this yet,"
Barens said. "It came as a surprise. Suge Knight absolutely pays his
taxes."</TE>
<TE>   Barens said he questions why it has taken so long to notify Knight
of the claim. "This is the first notice we've had," he said.</TE>
<TE>   IRS spokesman Victor Omelczenko said he could not comment on any
collection notice until a lien is placed on a taxpayer's property for
failing to settle a claim. Barens said there have been no liens filed
in connection with the $6-million notice.</TE>
<TE>   According to the Los Angeles County recorder's office, the only
current tax liens on Knight's property are on two jet skis, with
penalty and collections costs totaling $81.</TE>
<TE>   "[Knight] is a hard-working citizen and meets all his
responsibilities," Barens said. "He intends to respond. He plans to
pay it."</TE>

<HD>Taking a Cue From Jews' Survival</HD>
<DH>Culture: Minister studies Orthodox Judaism to teach Korean
Americans how to educate children, help churches thrive.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>TERESA WATANABE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Rev. Yong-Soo Hyun says God called him to abandon a well-paying
engineering career 20 years ago in favor of Christian ministry.</LD>
<LD>   So what is he doing shepherding a group of Korean visitors around
Southern California to attend a Shabbat dinner, an Orthodox Jewish
temple and a lecture by a Jewish rabbi on how to keep children holy?</LD>
<LD>   Hyun, 53, may be the biggest booster of traditional Jewish
education in all of Korean America.</LD>
<TE>   It is, he tells you, the antidote to the loss of cultural identity
and religious grounding he sees in successive generations of Koreans
here.</TE>
<TE>   So the minister now writes books, conducts tours and has even
opened the Shema Education Institute to teach Koreans the Jewish
"secrets of survival."</TE>
<TE>   "For Korean churches to survive in America, we have to
successfully pass down the word of God from generation to generation,
just as Jews have done since the time of Moses," said Hyun, a short,
dynamic man with an easy grin. "We have to learn the secrets of the
Jews."</TE>
<TE>   Hyun, who immigrated to the United States in 1975 at age 28, says
he sees several parallels between Korea and Israel.</TE>
<TE>   Both, he says, are small nations surrounded by large and sometimes
menacing neighbors.</TE>
<TE>   Both, he says, prospered when their people honored God and became
imperiled when they did not. The Israeli captivity in Babylonia, he
says, mirrors the Korean colonization by Japan.</TE>
<TE>   His fascination with traditional Judaism was sparked 12 years ago,
when he was a doctoral student at Biola University. He was studying
the philosophy of Christian education and wrote a term paper
comparing secular education with traditional Jewish education.</TE>
<TE>   What struck him, he says, was the way Jewish education seemed to
produce children who were intellectually excellent, honed through
hours of Torah training and Socratic-style questioning, as well as
religiously pious and morally grounded.</TE>
<TE>   Traditional Jews also seemed to keep family ties strong, with
fewer generation gaps than he says he found in his own community, and
low divorce rates.</TE>
<TE>   Persistence Pays Off</TE>
<TE>   Trying to learn more about Jewish religious education, however,
wasn't easy. He called the Orthodox Yeshiva University in Los Angeles
but says he was told it was not open to non-Jews. He called again and
was told the same thing. The third time, he said he began to argue
with the rabbi on the other end:</TE>
<TE>   "Why do you want to hide? God gave the Torah not just for you but
also to shine for all nations. If you teach me the secrets of
survival, how to keep your children holy, I will teach this to the
Koreans. This will be good for you and good for God!" Hyun said he
told the rabbi.</TE>
<TE>   There was a pause. Then the rabbi gave him the name and number of
Rabbi Yitzchok Adlerstein, a professor of Jewish law at Loyola
University and prominent member of the Orthodox community known for
reaching out to non-Jews.</TE>
<TE>   Hyun called Adlerstein, who immediately invited him to his home
for Shabbat dinner. Even better, Hyun said, Adlerstein agreed to
guide his research into Jewish education.</TE>
<TE>   "He allowed me to attend his Talmudic teachings," Hyun said. "He
invited me to all of the ritual meals--the Passover Seder, Sukkot,
Rosh Hashana. I asked so many questions and he answered them all."</TE>
<TE>   The Shabbat meal, in particular, left a lasting impression, Hyun
says. He was moved by the way the family sang a ritual song of praise
to Adlerstein's wife--a contrast, he says, with an old Korean saying
that the "three dumb things" a man must not do are praise his wife,
his children or himself. He was touched by the way Adlerstein blessed
each of his children.</TE>
<TE>   And he was impressed at the way Adlerstein taught his children the
Torah, quizzing them on passages, never spoon-feeding answers but
asking more questions to stimulate their critical thinking skills and
creative intellects.</TE>
<TE>   For his part, Adlerstein said he initially thought the idea of a
Korean Christian minister wanting to learn about Orthodox Judaism
seemed "a little odd."</TE>
<TE>   Although traditional Jews don't believe Judaism was meant for the
world--they do not proselytize and often discourage would-be
converts--Adlerstein was willing to guide Hyun.</TE>
<TE>   "Our attitude generally as a community is that when you're
enthusiastic about God and his teachings, you have a gift that you
want to share with any well-intentioned person," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Armed with his experiences, Hyun was ready to try the techniques
on his four sons at home. He announced that, like Adlerstein, he
would no longer allow them to watch TV. Instead, three evenings a
week he would teach them the Bible.</TE>
<TE>   The reaction? "They rejected it all," Hyun said, laughing.</TE>
<TE>   After too many nights of arguments, Hyun got them interested in
Bible studies by asking them to take turns preaching. But more than
the intellectual training, Hyun said, it was his mimicry of Jewish
expressions of family love that seemed to bring the most dramatic

<TE>   Praise for His Wife</TE>
<TE>   For the first time, Hyun says, he began praising his wife as he
had seen his Jewish mentor do. He took her to Malibu at night, and
strolled around the waterfront. He began washing the dishes and
taking his wife on his travels. Before, he said, their marriage was
characterized by "no romance--just orders" to her from him.</TE>
<TE>   For the first time, he gathered his sons around to bless them. He
asked God to bless them with wisdom, prosperity, leadership and the
light of the gospel. "I cried, and they cried," he said.</TE>
<TE>   From then on, he says, his family life dramatically improved.
"Judaism showed me patience and how to lead children by wisdom and
not authoritarianism. Now our family friendship has recovered."</TE>
<TE>   Eager to share his experiences with other Koreans, Hyun has
written a book on Jewish religious education that has sold more than
120,000 copies.</TE>
<TE>   Hyun writes that Jewish fathers develop a child's IQ through
Talmudic teachings, while mothers nurture their "EQ," or emotional
quotient, with their maternal love--a thesis Adlerstein himself
rejects in favor of viewing both parents as responsible for nurturing
both aspects.</TE>
<TE>   Experiencing Judaism</TE>
<TE>   Hyun also figures he's reached 300,000 other Koreans in lectures
on Jewish education at various seminars and conferences around the
world.</TE>
<TE>   And he says he has brought at least 150 people to Los Angeles to
experience traditional Judaism firsthand in visits to synagogues and
Friday night Shabbat dinners.</TE>
<TE>   During one recent tour, Hyun led a group into the Beth Jacob
congregation on Olympic Boulevard, wearing a traditional Korean
jacket and a Jewish yarmulke.</TE>
<TE>   After Sabbath prayers, Rabbi Shimon Kraft fielded a stream of
lively questions: Why do you wear a head covering? Why do you wear a
beard? Why kiss the door? Why do men shake when they pray? Why do you
have two pulpits? Do you evangelize?"</TE>
<TE>   Finally, someone asked: "We've learned about Jews, but what do you
think about Koreans?"</TE>
<TE>   Kraft gave the crowd a broad smile.</TE>
<TE>   "They are bright, hard-working, studious--just like Jewish
people," he said. "We seem to share a lot of the same values."</TE>

<HD>Lookout Tower Is Back as First Line of Fire Defense</HD>
<DH>Safety: Volunteers in the 'lighthouses of the land' can
spot smoke and summon a response more quickly than high-tech
counterparts.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CARA MIA DiMASSA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Scouts riding in small planes can spot smoke from thousands of feet
above. Infrared technology can map blazes from miles away.</LD>
<LD>   But sometimes, for fire detection, nothing beats a human being,
peering through binoculars, inside a "lighthouse of the land," an
old-fashioned fire lookout.</LD>
<LD>   After an absence of nearly two decades, fire lookouts have
returned to Southern California forests, part of a national trend
that in recent years has seen a resurgence of the tiny one-room
cabins with uninterrupted, 360-degree views of the treetops.</LD>
<TE>   Perched on stilts atop peaks as high as 13,000 feet above sea
level, many of the nation's lookout towers had fallen into disuse by
the 1980s, victims of budget cuts, technological innovations and, in
Southern California, smog.</TE>
<TE>   Forestry officials are initiating a survey of how many lookouts
have been restored and restaffed in recent years, both on federal and
state lands.</TE>
<TE>   The Forest Fire Lookout Assn. estimates that there are 2,000
lookouts nationwide, about half of them staffed. In the 1980s, only a
few hundred were in use.</TE>
<TE>   In Southern California, a dedicated corps of volunteers has begun
to repair and restaff the lookouts--most of which were built in the
1930s and '40s by the Civilian Conservation Corps and were once
staffed by a single employee who lived alone all summer.</TE>
<TE>   "I think there's a certain romance in fire lookouts," said Kris
Assel, executive director of the San Bernardino National Forest
Assn., a nonprofit group that has resurrected seven of eight lookouts
there. "It's a neat piece of history that fits into modern forest
management."</TE>
<TE>   It's been 100 years since a timber cook was assigned to a hilltop
tree to watch for wildfires in Bertha Hill, Idaho--what many consider
the birth of the modern fire lookout. By the 1940s and '50s, the
number of fire lookouts had swelled to nearly 8,000.</TE>
<TE>   This summer, as the West experiences an intensely dangerous fire
season, more than 400 volunteers are stationed at lookouts in the San
Bernardino and Angeles national forests. The Cleveland and Los Padres
forests do not have working lookouts; volunteers hope to revive them
in a few years.</TE>
<TE>   The job of the fire watcher, alone among the trees, has long
captured the imagination. Jack Kerouac wrote of the appeal and quiet
beauty of the two summer months he spent on a lookout in Washington
in "The Dharma Bums":</TE>
<TE>   "I saw a sea of marshmallow clouds flat as a roof and extending
miles and miles in every direction.... All I had to do was keep an
eye on all horizons for smoke and run the two-way radio and sweep the
floor."</TE>
<TE>   Some of today's fire watchers hope to share the history of
America's lookouts with the many hikers, bikers and others who pass
by. Others are retired firefighters who have found, with the support
of the U.S. Forest Service, a new way to serve the people who live
below.</TE>
<TE>   "It's all one big family," said George Morey, a screen installer
who with his wife, Pam, runs the Angeles National Forest Fire Lookout
Assn. "We are from all walks of life, but we all love the same
thing."</TE>
<TE>   The Moreys, who live in the San Bernardino forest, joined that
forest's lookout program nine years ago. "We went to training," said
Pam Morey, "and got more and more involved. Now, between work and
that, it's our life."</TE>
<TE>   The San Bernardino group originally hoped to reopen the sites as
"interpretive centers" where visitors could learn about fire
prevention and lookout history.</TE>
<TE>   As interest in the history of the lookouts grew, so did interest
in their original mission--a mission that was aided by stricter
emissions rules that had helped clear much of the smog that once
hindered smoke-tracking from above.</TE>
<TE>   Lookout volunteers now are also rigorously trained by forest
officials in weather reporting and radio operations. In the San
Bernardino, volunteers must undergo 22 hours of classroom instruction
before participating in supervised in-tower training.</TE>
<TE>   "It's very similar to the way the National Ski Patrol volunteers
work," said Keith Argow, chairman of the Forest Fire Lookout Assn., a
national group. "There's a dedicated crew of people who can get
things done that employees can't.</TE>
<TE>   "The San Bernardino is to be commended for setting a national
standard that no other forest has since copied," he added. "But the
Angeles is coming on strong."</TE>
<TE>   Volunteers reopened two Angeles lookouts in 1998 and 1999 and hope
to open a third soon.</TE>
<TE>   Mike McIntyre, the Angeles forest's heritage resource program
manager, said that after some initial skepticism, forest officials
welcome their aid in detecting fires. "At first, people didn't
understand the program," he said. "But now they see how consistent
the volunteers have been in their work, and how they have helped with
fire reports."</TE>
<TE>   Now, McIntyre said, "I believe everybody sees the worth of the
program and supports it. And the volunteers have become good
ambassadors for the forest."</TE>
<TE>   Already this year, lookouts have spotted one fire in the Angeles
and three in the San Bernardino.</TE>
<TE>   "That's a lot," said Assel. "An average year will get three first
reports."</TE>
<TE>   In regions with a heavy concentration of what foresters call
wildland/urban interface--areas in which metropolitan centers abut
forests and chaparral--forest fires could threaten the urban centers
nearby. That's why speed is so important to firefighters in the San
Bernardino and Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Despite the 21st century technology available to firefighters,
human vigilance can prevent a blaze from becoming an inferno.</TE>
<TE>   "In order for infrared to pick it up, a fire has to be five-plus
acres," said Pam Morey. Satellites can spot fires, she added, but
there's as much as a 15-minute window between pictures. "We can spot
a fire in a matter of minutes, and can get it stopped a lot sooner."</TE>
<TE>   In two years, the Moreys have logged more than 100,000 miles on
their Chevy pickup, shuttling between home and two lookouts in the
Angeles. Sometimes, Pam Morey said, it takes two hours to reach the
whitewashed cabin at the top of Vetter Mountain.</TE>
<TE>   "I guess I kind of like the program," she said with a shrug.</TE>
<TE>   The Moreys have decorated the cabin with photos and plaques
honoring the lookout's past. Below the American flag flies a Smokey
Bear flag--part of George's sizable collection of Smokey memorabilia.</TE>
<TE>   "This is our baby," said George Morey, his eyes darting across a
hillside with scrub brush, Coulter pine and yucca.</TE>
<TE>   It is work, he said, that entails both tedium and excitement.</TE>
<TE>   The lookout had gone into service at 9 a.m., as it does almost
every day from May to October. Volunteers typically work in four- and
eight-hour shifts.</TE>
<TE>   An hour into his shift, George Morey had already taken a weather
reading, measured the wind, and was training volunteer Bill Albrecht,
a retired NASA engineer, to use the Osborne Fire-Finder, an oversized
compass-like contraption that is the standard navigational tool in a
lookout.</TE>
<TE>   In the Angeles, the Osbornes are stored behind a double padlocked
door when not in use. "You can lose the radio, you can lose the
binoculars," George Morey said. "But you'd better not lose the
Osborne."</TE>
<TE>   He pointed out a "smoke report," which a volunteer must fill out
before calling in a fire over a battery-powered walkie-talkie.</TE>
<TE>   A volunteer notes the volume and type of smoke (thin, drifting,
blanket) and, perhaps most important, its color. Black smoke is
emitted by a burning car or manzanita; white by light grass; and gray
by heavier or drier grass.</TE>
<TE>   Pam Morey recalled her first fire as "pretty darn exciting."</TE>
<TE>   "I had to guide the planes and trucks," she said. "It's awesome.
It's really nervous-making too, because you know when you make that
call, you are getting out all these aircraft and units."</TE>
<TE>   "Any lookout will tell you," George Morey said, "when you first
spot smoke, your adrenaline goes crazy." He gestured with one arm to
the west, toward the "Big T"--Upper Big Tujunga Road-- where a
volunteer recently spotted black smoke.</TE>
<TE>   As he began to relate that story, of a car fire, George Morey kept
his eyes on the horizon, scanning the forest. Just in case.</TE>

<HD>Ex-Teacher's Slaying Case Is a Mistrial</HD>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The trial of a former high school math teacher charged with gunning
down a party crasher 13 years ago while a college student in Mission
Viejo ended Friday with a jury deadlock.</LD>
<LD>   After five days of deliberations, Orange County Superior Court
Judge Frank F. Fasel announced a mistrial in the case of Mark Glen
Morales. A 35-year-old former teacher at Belmont High School in Los
Angeles, Morales stood accused of fatally shooting Steven Merritt,
21, after the two men clashed at a party.</LD>
<LD>   Jurors announced Friday afternoon that they were divided 10 to 2
in favor of a guilty verdict. The case was scheduled for a new trial
Oct. 7, although the Orange County district attorney's office said it
would review the case again before deciding whether to retry it.</LD>
<TE>   "We're disappointed the jury didn't reach a unanimous verdict,''
said Assistant Dist. Atty. Lewis Rosenblum. "We're going to take a
hard look at this case and hopefully bring Mr. Morales to justice in
the near future.''</TE>
<TE>   Morales, who had left the U.S. for a time after Merritt's death,
was arrested two years ago when enterprising detectives found new
evidence connecting him to the crime. During his trial in Santa Ana,
Morales' parents were handcuffed and jailed for contempt of court
when they refused to testify against him. The parents were released
at the conclusion of testimony; the defendant remains in custody.</TE>
<TE>   "He's always maintained his innocence and we're just going to keep
fighting," defense attorney Don Re said.</TE>
<TE>   Merritt was found shot to death Feb. 26, 1989, after attending a
party for the International Club at Saddleback College. The party was
thrown by the defendant at a Mission Viejo home that belonged to his
parents, in an upscale neighborhood. More than 100 friends of Morales
attended, with most of the revelers dancing to salsa music and
dressed in shirts and ties.</TE>
<TE>   Merritt and a group of friends crashed the party and immediately
stood out. Coming straight from watching a televised boxing match,
the half-dozen friends wore jeans and T-shirts, according to reports.</TE>
<TE>   The evening quickly turned sour when one of Merritt's friends made
fun of the music. The uninvited group left after an hour except for
Merritt, who was flirting with a friend of Morales', authorities
said.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors alleged that Morales had grown increasingly disturbed
over the behavior of the party crashers and soon turned violent. When
Merritt eventually left the party about 3 a.m., he walked to a nearby
intersection, where a friend had agreed to pick him up.</TE>
<TE>   Morales allegedly got into a black car and followed Merritt with
the lights turned off. As they reached Cordova Park, Morales
allegedly confronted Merritt and somehow got him into his car. The
two allegedly drove about a mile, got out and scuffled. Merritt was
shot and killed. Morales, who returned to the U.S. roughly six years
ago, had earned a partial teaching credential and taught math to
ninth-graders at Belmont High. He got married three months before his
arrest.</TE>

<HD>Suliman Olayan, 83; Financier and Self-Made Billionaire
Businessman</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DENNIS McLELLAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Suliman Olayan, a wealthy Saudi financier who rose from his
middle-class beginnings to become one of the world's wealthiest
people and one of the architects of modern Saudi Arabia, has died. He
was 83.</LD>
<LD>   Olayan, whose $8-billion fortune put him at No. 38 on the Forbes
magazine list of the richest people in the world last year, died July
4 at his home in Manhattan. The cause of death was not announced.</LD>
<LD>   As the founder and chairman of the Olayan Group, an international
network of more than 50 companies, Olayan made his fortune in energy,
insurance, consumer goods ventures and investments.</LD>
<TE>   And, as has often been pointed out in the media, he did it without
having any blood connections to the Saudi royal family. As Olayan
once told the Financial Times of London: "I made it on my own and as
a commoner."</TE>
<TE>   He began amassing his wealth in 1947 after taking out an $8,000
loan on his house and starting a small trucking company.</TE>
<TE>   His General Contracting Co. soon won a large subcontract from
Bechtel Corp. to help build the Trans-Arabian Pipeline, which linked
oilfields in eastern Saudi Arabia to terminals in Lebanon.</TE>
<TE>   Olayan eventually set up a joint venture with Bechtel, one of his
many businesses in Saudi Arabia, which include a large food and
consumer distribution company with exclusive licenses from General
Foods, Pillsbury, Kimberly-Clark and Burger King, and other
multinational corporations.</TE>
<TE>   Olayan also helped his country's development by founding its first
insurance company, its first public utility and numerous joint
ventures. His company also helped build a Saudi airport.</TE>
<TE>   His becoming a financier, according to a 1998 profile in the
Financial Times of London, was born of necessity: His contracting
company was importing everything from the United States, and Saudi
banks would not extend credit. At the same time, U.S. banks would not
accept his Saudi assets as security, so he began buying blue chip
shares on the U.S. market.</TE>
<TE>   Considered a powerful participant in global equity and financial
markets, the Olayan Group has minority holdings in numerous public
companies in the United States, such as J.P. Morgan Chase, Occidental
Petroleum, MetLife and Coca-Cola. In 1981, Forbes magazine called
Olayan "perhaps the most important private Saudi investor in the
U.S."</TE>
<TE>   Born in a small town about 150 miles northeast of the capital city
of Riyadh, Olayan was the son of a merchant who imported spices from
Africa. Olayan's mother died shortly after he was born, and his
father died when he was 6.</TE>
<TE>   He was later sent to school in Bahrain. Although he excelled
academically, Olayan did not attend college. He instead landed a job
as an oil gauger, testing petroleum samples for sediment and
contaminants.</TE>
<TE>   After returning to Saudi Arabia in 1937, he found work as a truck
dispatcher for what became Arabian American Oil Co., or Aramco. He
worked his way up to head of warehousing and also served as Aramco's
government liaison officer.</TE>
<TE>   To encourage Saudi entrepreneurs, Aramco offered its best
employees a yearlong sabbatical to start their own businesses.
Although he could have returned to his old job at the end of his 1947
sabbatical, Olayan started his small trucking company and never
looked back.</TE>
<TE>   He had homes in New York, London and Lucerne, Switzerland, but
lived primarily in Riyadh.</TE>
<TE>   The Olayan Group has announced that Olayan's son, Khaled, chairman
of Olayan Financing Co., will succeed his father as chairman of the
Olayan Group. Olayan's three daughters--Hayat, Lubna and Hutham--are
also executives with the Olayan Group.</TE>
<TE>   In addition to his children, Olayan is survived by his wife, Mary.</TE>

<HD>DWP Wants Fans to Root, Root, Root for It--but What Game Is
It Playing?</HD>
<DH></DH>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Atitle that won't hold water? You may have read that the Los Angeles
Department of Water and Power is under the scrutiny of state Senate
investigators over its trading and marketing practices, including
alleged "ricochet" maneuvers in which power is exported out of the
state so that it can be bought back at a higher price.</LD>
<LD>   This comes at a time when the DWP is airing commercials on L.A.
Dodger broadcasts in which it says that it's "L.A.'s home team too."
Yes, but just what game are you playing, DWP?</LD>
<LD>   Off-season work, perhaps? If you are wondering what Santa's
helpers do the rest of the year, Barbara Lewin of Valencia may have
found the answer in Saugus (see photo).</LD>
<TE>   Four-legged hurlers: I remember a short story about a horse named
Jones that played third base. But a reader found an ad for some mutts
that can play another position (see accompanying).</TE>
<TE>   Unclear on the concept: While we're on the subject of dogs,
athletic and otherwise, Sara Meric of Santa Monica saw an ad that
probably meant to use the term "removal" rather than "restoration"
(see accompanying).</TE>
<TE>   Hey, that's the smell of roses, not petroleum! The FBI sent an
advisory to its field office in Los Angeles, reporting that
uncorroborated intelligence suggested that terrorists might attack
oil refineries in Pasadena. But, Associated Press said, agents here
"determined there were no refineries in Pasadena, Calif."</TE>
<TE>   Whoops! Agents later determined that the intelligence was
referring to Pasadena, Texas.</TE>
<TE>   Two nations separated by a common language: In
Stratford-upon-Avon, near the Royal Shakespeare Theatre, William
Fawcett of Tujunga found a phrase that I haven't heard American
drivers use (see photo). Or Shakespeare, for that matter.</TE>
<TE>   But I do believe that the Bard wrote, "Parking is such street
sorrow." Or maybe that was San Francisco columnist Herb Caen.</TE>
<TE>   Summer hazards: The Laguna News-Post said a couple who were
"renting a house and appeared to be unfamiliar with the locks called
police when they were unable to get out of the bedroom. Police
responded to assist them."</TE>
<TE>   What I did over the summer: I was slathering on suntan lotion at
my son's baseball camp when a foul ball rolled my way. I picked it up
and started to throw the ball to the coach, forgetting how slippery
my hand was. The ball flew out of my hand behind me and, as I reached
for it, I toppled backward in my chair into a fence.</TE>
<TE>   "Are you OK?" the worried coach asked, wondering whether I'd be
the first parent carried out on a stretcher. Later, I mentioned the
incident to my son and he laughed heartily. I guess that's a good
sign.</TE>
<TE>   miscelLAny: Continuing our series on the second lives of building
signs, Tim Bamford of Rancho Park wrote: "Thirty years ago, there was
a slot-racing track on Washington Boulevard called 'Classic
Speedways.' Today, it's a laundromat called 'Classic Speedwash.' "</TE>

<HD>Wardens' Fast 'Cats' Aim to Net Poachers</HD>
<DH>A fleet of new catamarans is Fish and Game's answer to the
challenge of patrolling the open ocean.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KENNETH R. WEISS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Lt. John Suchil sets a course for the Swordfish, a 58-foot catamaran
named after one of the fastest fish in the sea.</LD>
<LD>   "We're going to be powering up," Suchil hollers to his
navy-blue-uniformed crew. "So hold onto something."</LD>
<LD>   The vessel springs into action as a submerged hydrofoil lifts its
aluminum hulls out of the water. Loosened from the water's grip, the
California Department of Fish and Game's newest patrol boat skims
across the tops of waves on its way to Anacapa Island.</LD>
<TE>   Until now, Fish and Game wardens have struggled to keep pace with
poachers on the open ocean. Their boats were small or slow. Yet their
territory is huge, extending 200 miles offshore. So they relied
heavily on dockside checks to enforce state and federal laws, rather
than counting on catching violators on the high seas.</TE>
<TE>   "Now, if we get a violation in progress, we'll get out there
lickety-split," said Suchil, who has captained a patrol boat out of
Ventura since 1985. "We're used to driving Volkswagens. This is a
Viper. It's fast."</TE>
<TE>   The Swordfish, based in Ventura, is one of five new million-dollar
power cats being placed strategically along the California coast. The
Thresher is at Dana Point, and others are assigned to Morro Bay,
Monterey and Berkeley.</TE>
<TE>   The roll-out of the high-speed boats comes at a key time. Not only
are wardens faced with enforcing an ever more complicated array of
fishing regulations, now they must patrol vast areas of ocean that
are have been made off-limits to fishing.</TE>
<TE>   Federal and state officials earlier this month closed about 80% of
the continental shelf to bottom-fishing for rock fish--an emergency
action to avoid extinction of bocaccio and other severely depleted
species. In September, officials may make the closing indefinite.</TE>
<TE>   Furthermore, the California Fish and Game Commission later this
year is scheduled to establish the state's first sizable "marine
protected areas." The primary plan being discussed would turn about
25% of the waters in the Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary
into no-fishing zones. It would help all types of sea life recover
from decades of excessive harvests.</TE>
<TE>   Law enforcement in such vast ocean wilderness areas is different
from citing fishermen for bringing back undersized fish or exceeding
quotas. Violations of no-fishing zones can be spotted only from the
water, not from the dock.</TE>
<TE>   So Fish and Game officials are developing plans with other law
enforcement agencies, as well as using their own twin-engine
airplanes, to keep poachers out of these areas. Essential to the
strategy are the agile, high-speed cats, which can win the
cat-and-mouse game played out with poachers aboard their own swift
boats.</TE>
<TE>   On a recent return trip from Catalina, wardens on the Swordfish
decided to make a detour to an offshore area set off limits to
protect the few remaining cowcod rock fish. They found a recreational
charter boat from Redondo Beach's King Harbor fishing in the closed
area, said Lt. Jorge Gross.</TE>
<TE>   "We could have cited everyone and seized all their fish," Gross
said. But some customers had no idea they were fishing in waters set
off-limits. "We cited the skipper for taking them out there and five
passengers who were over the limits of rockfish. We issued warnings
to 23 other passengers."</TE>
<TE>   With one of the older, slower boats, such a productive side trip
would never have been attempted. It would have taken too long to fit
into an already busy day.</TE>
<TE>   Wardens are reluctant to disclose the top speed of their new power
cats, although documents show they can do as much as 38 knots. That's
three times the speed of typical commercial fishing vessels.</TE>
<TE>   It's also twice as fast as the previous patrol boat based in
Ventura, a Vietnam War-era river boat.</TE>
<TE>   So Suchil, as well as the fishermen who work these waters, are
just getting used to the Swordfish, its sleek lines and twin
600-horsepower diesel engines.</TE>
<TE>   The Swordfish is dull aluminum gray, a color not too different
from other Fish and Game patrol boats, which are painted gray to help
them blend into a hazy horizon. The coloring has spawned one of the
many nicknames for these fish cops: "the gray ghosts."</TE>
<TE>   After the Swordfish arrives at Anacapa Island, Suchil and the crew
launch a 15-foot Zodiac Hurricane skiff, using an A-frame hoist
designed for rough seas.</TE>
<TE>   Soon Warden Jason Kraus and Lt. Gross motor off in the skiff to do
spot checks of fishing boats while Suchil hangs back in the haze,
just out of sight.</TE>
<TE>   When the power cat zooms to catch up, the reaction is more than
surprise at the big boat's speed and agility.</TE>
<TE>   The reaction is best described as, well, boat envy.</TE>
<TE>   "That thing is hot," yells fisherman Eric Hermann, spotting the
Swordfish for the first time. He wants to know all about the boat,
its high-tech design, its engines and fancy electronics. "You should
have called it the CATillac," Hermann says.</TE>
<TE>   Suchil beams at the compliment. At age 57, he was considering
retirement when Gov. Gray Davis and the Legislature starting
committing more money to enforcement along with new fishing rules and
regulations.</TE>
<TE>   "After all these years," he said, "they're giving me a
million-dollar yacht and a credit card. This is no time to retire."</TE>

<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Michael McLaughlin, 53, coauthor of the "Silver Palate Cookbook" who
wrote nearly a dozen other cookbooks, was found dead last week at his
home in Santa Fe, N.M.</LD>
<LD>   Relatives said he died of natural causes.</LD>
<LD>   Born in Wray, Colo., McLaughlin attended the University of
Colorado, but dropped out and took a job as a waiter in a Tex-Mex
restaurant in Boulder. It was there that he became interested in
cooking and cuisine.</LD>
<TE>   McLaughlin headed for New York City in 1979 and found a job in an
Upper West Side food shop called the Silver Palate. When the owners,
Sheila Lukins and Julee Rosso, were approached to write a cookbook,
McLaughlin was added as technical writer and developed many of the
book's recipes. Published in 1982, the "Silver Palate Cookbook" has
sold more than 2 million copies.</TE>
<TE>   After leaving the Silver Palate, McLaughlin was part owner and
chef of the Manhattan Chili Co. in the Greenwich Village area of New
York.</TE>
<TE>   Cookbooks under McLaughlin's name include "The New American
Kitchen," "The Back of the Box Gourmet," "Wild About Mushrooms," "52
Meat Loaves" and the "Manhattan Chili Company Southwest American
Cookbook."</TE>

<LD>Count Jan Zamoyski, 90, a member of one of Poland's most prestigious
noble families who was the target of communist persecution, died of
natural causes June 29 in a Warsaw hospital.</LD>
<LD>   Born June 12, 1912, in Klemensow, Zamoyski was the son of Maurycy
Zamoyski, then one of Poland's biggest landowners.</LD>
<LD>   He graduated from Institute Superieur de Commerce et Economie in
Nancy, France, and Warsaw's Main Trade School before returning home
to run the family property.</LD>
<TE>   He served as an infantry and cavalry officer in the Polish Army in
1939 during the failed defense against Nazi invaders.</TE>
<TE>   During World War II, he fought against the Germans as a member of
the underground Home Army. After the war, the communist authorities
confiscated Zamoyski's property and he was sentenced to 25 years in
prison on charges of spying for the West. Seven years later, he was
released.</TE>
<TE>   After the communists were ousted, Zamoyski was elected senator in
1991 for the small, conservative National Democrats.</TE>

<HD>Richard Gerstenberg, 92; Retired Chairman of General Motors</HD>

<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Richard Gerstenberg, 92, retired chairman and chief executive of
General Motors Corp., died Thursday at his home in Paradise Valley,
Ariz., a company spokesman said. The cause of death was not
announced.</LD>
<LD>   Born in Little Falls, N.Y., Gerstenberg grew up in nearby Mohawk
and graduated from the University of Michigan in 1931. He started at
General Motors the next year as a timekeeper in the company's
Frigidaire division in Dayton, Ohio.</LD>
<LD>   From that position, he rose steadily through the corporate ranks,
holding a variety of financial-related posts, including treasurer and
executive vice president for finance.</LD>
<TE>   His tenure as head of GM came at a time when gasoline prices rose
in the United States because of the Arab oil embargo. The higher
prices helped increase consumer demand for more fuel-efficient
vehicles, which hurt GM and other leading U.S. automakers.</TE>
<TE>   Gerstenberg served on the company's board of directors from 1967
to 1980.</TE>

<HD>Monroe E. Wall, 85; Helped Discover Two Cancer-Fighting
Drugs</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Times Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Monroe E. Wall, 85, a biochemist who helped discover two drugs that
fight cancer--Taxol and camptothecin, died of heart and kidney
failure July 6 at a hospital in Chapel Hill, N.C.</LD>
<LD>   The son of a Russian Jewish tailor, Wall was born in Newark, N.J.
He earned his bachelor's, master's and doctoral degrees all from
Rutgers University.</LD>
<LD>   For two decades, he worked for the U.S. Department of Agriculture
before joining the Research Triangle Institute in North Carolina in
the early 1960s.</LD>
<TE>   It was there that Wall and colleague Mansukh Wani discovered plant
compounds that shrink cancerous tumors. One of their discoveries,
Taxol, has been used effectively to treat ovarian, breast and lung
cancers. It also has been effective in battling a cancer associated
with the AIDS virus, Kaposi's sarcoma. Camptothecin has been used to
treat ovarian cancer.</TE>
<TE>   In 2000, Wall and Wani were awarded the $250,000 Charles F.
Kettering prize by the General Motors Cancer Research Foundation to
honor their contributions in the fight against cancer. In 1998, Wall
received the Alfred Burger Award from the American Chemical Society.</TE>

<HD>Flynn's Proposed 'Peace Summit' Delayed</HD>
<DH>Politics: Supervisor says he had been seeking a mediator
for a meeting with Latino leaders.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>CATHERINE SAILLANT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>He said he wanted to give peace a chance.</LD>
<LD>   But by Friday, a week after Ventura County Supervisor John Flynn
called for a "peace summit" to mend his rift with local Latino
leaders, the veteran politician had yet to contact the main players
to name a time and place.</LD>
<LD>   "I have not received any correspondence, any phone calls, any
faxes. I have not received anything from John Flynn," said Irma
Lopez, one of several people with whom Flynn publicly announced he
would like to meet to settle differences.</LD>
<TE>   Flynn has been feuding with Lopez, the wife of Oxnard Mayor Manuel
Lopez, since the two had a confrontation last month as they left a
Democratic Party fund-raiser in Oxnard. In a report filed with
police, Lopez contends Flynn threatened her, yelling, "You wanna war?
I'm going to get you! You don't fool around with me."</TE>
<TE>   Flynn denies making a threat and said Lopez and other Latino
leaders are trying to damage his reputation so they can promote a
Latino for his 5th District seat.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, Flynn said formal invitations to the meeting have been
delayed because he had been seeking the services of a professional
mediator. Although he suggested last week that Latino activist Marcos
Vargas or Democratic Party leader Hank Lacayo could act as informal
referees, the idea has not panned out, Flynn said.</TE>
<TE>   Vargas has voiced reservations about jumping into the fray. And
Lacayo could be perceived by some as too close to him, Flynn said.
After talking to advisors, he decided to seek the help of mediators
at the nonprofit Ventura Center for Dispute Settlement.</TE>
<TE>   The mediator working with him was supposed to call the primary
parties--Lopez, Rio Elementary School District Supt. Yolanda Benitez
and Denis O'Leary, president of the League of United Latin American
Citizens--to see if they are willing to enter into mediation, Flynn
said.</TE>
<TE>   "These mediators are experts in this kind of stuff," Flynn said.
"They know how to do it. But it takes the cooperation of everyone."</TE>
<TE>   As of late Friday, O'Leary and Benitez said they had not been
contacted by Flynn or anyone else. In the meantime, O'Leary said, his
organization is putting the finishing touches on its own meeting
proposal.</TE>
<TE>   In a letter that will likely be sent early next week, the league
will formally ask Flynn to sit down with its executive members,
O'Leary said.</TE>
<TE>   The group wants to talk about recent comments by Flynn, printed in
The Times, that Lopez "won't be happy until she sees a sea of brown
faces in every political office in west Ventura County."</TE>
<TE>   O'Leary said the league would not let the issue drop without a
pledge from Flynn, a 26-year supervisor, that he will no longer
publicly berate Oxnard's political leaders.</TE>

<HD>In the End, Fallen Veteran Does Have Allies</HD>
<DH>Postscript: A VFW post hopes to provide a military funeral
for the 92-year-old who couldn't face life after jail.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN M. GLIONNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>SAN FRANCISCO</DL>
<LD>Efforts are underway to provide a military funeral for Coval Russell,
the ailing 92-year-old veteran who took his life Wednesday after a
Butte County judge dismissed his request to stay in jail, where he
felt comfortable.</LD>
<LD>   Russell, a bachelor with no surviving relatives, would normally be
cremated and buried in a county cemetery. But some residents of
Oroville, north of Sacramento, say they want to provide him a service
with full military honors.</LD>
<LD>   "A bunch of us guys have an honor guard--we all have uniforms and
rifles and everything," said Earl Baker, club manager at the Veterans
of Foreign Wars chapter in the small town. "Call me prejudiced, but
an old veteran like this one needs to be buried with respect in the
military way, not just be cremated and put in some potter's field."</LD>
<TE>   Russell died Wednesday after jumping from a bridge into the
Feather River. Witnesses say Russell--who had told others he would
rather kill himself than go to a nursing home--had sat on the railing
for nearly half an hour, peering down at the rocks below, before
jumping. He had gone to jail in April 2001, convicted of assault
after stabbing his landlord.</TE>
<TE>   The morning he died, Russell, never before involved with the
criminal justice system, mailed a letter to Jim Pihl, a Chico private
investigator who had befriended him, saying he was sorry for stabbing
and wounding his 70-year-old landlord last year during an argument.
The incident in the nearby town of Paradise, where Russell had lived
for 26 years, landed him in jail for 14 months, until he was ordered
out on probation in June.</TE>
<TE>   In the note, Russell described the pain he suffered from various
physical ailments and worried about getting enough medication.
Although he did not mention taking his life, he said probation was
"in my case: a form of physical and mental torture. No thank you."</TE>
<TE>   Pihl, who earlier in the week had refused Russell's plea to help
him commit suicide, got the letter Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   Butte County sheriff's deputies say Russell also left what they
describe as a suicide note in the $41-a-night hotel room where he
stayed after his jail release, but they would not discuss its
contents.</TE>
<TE>   During his 426 days behind bars, the scrappy Russell became known
as Pops to the guards and inmates who looked out for him, giving him
extra food, television time and medication for his prostate cancer,
ulcers and blindness in one eye. Officials say he may have been
California's oldest jail inmate.</TE>
<TE>   But ruling that jail was no place for a man of Russell's age and
health, a judge last month released the Oklahoma native. In an
interview afterward, Russell wept when he talked of the friends he
had met in jail and said his few options included violating probation
to return to jail or taking his life.</TE>
<TE>   In the days since the death, the Butte County Sheriff's Department
has received numerous calls from people concerned over Russell's fate
and the treatment of the elderly, said spokeswoman Cheryl Broom.
"People in the community feel terrible about this," she said. "They
want to do what's right."</TE>
<TE>   Officials are investigating Russell's background to see if he
qualifies for a military funeral. They say the county will not pay
and that Russell himself would have had to possess the funds to cover
such burial costs.</TE>
<TE>   The VFW's Baker said Oroville has a veterans section in the local
cemetery but that it is costly to be buried there. "It's up to the
county, what they want to do," he said.</TE>
<TE>   The county public guardian's office said the burial could take
place as early as Tuesday, and Pihl said an effort was being made to
coordinate with VFW officials.</TE>
<TE>   Russell, who liked to be called Russ, lived in Los Angeles for
nearly half a century. At age 32, he reportedly volunteered for Navy
duty and served in the Aleutian Islands during World War II.</TE>
<TE>   Thomas Campbell, a 41-year-old Brentwood engineer, read an article
about Russell in The Times and called Oroville officials to suggest
the military burial. He said he was also going to contact the
Department of Veterans Affairs to provide a gravestone.</TE>
<TE>   "I've always taught my kids about remembering their
grandparents--the grandfather and great-uncles who deserve their
respect," he said. "This man deserves to be remembered."</TE>
<TE>   Pihl, whose own father committed suicide, said Russell's case
highlights society's need to better care for its elderly citizens.</TE>
<TE>   "We need to do right by Russ," said Pihl, who is assisting in the
burial effort. "It's a symbolic thing for all the Russes out there
who haven't been able to get help."</TE>

<LD>   Sanchez, 31, is charged with first-degree murder, attempted rape
and attempted kidnapping as well as two special circumstance
allegations in connection with the July 2001 slaying of 20-year-old
Moorpark College student Megan Barroso.</LD>
<LD>   Prosecutors are seeking the death penalty.</LD>
<TE>   On Friday, Sanchez, who has previously pleaded guilty to numerous
rapes and sexual assaults, appeared in Ventura County Superior Court
for an arraignment on the charges related to Barroso's slaying.</TE>
<TE>   Sanchez's lawyer said the defendant was prepared to plead guilty
to murder and allow the judge to determine the degree.</TE>
<TE>   But prosecutors objected, saying there is no legal precedent for
such a plea.</TE>
<TE>   Defense lawyer Neil Quinn argued that the law does allow for such
a procedure and requested that Judge Ken Riley research the matter
before ruling.</TE>
<TE>   Riley agreed and postponed the arraignment until Tuesday.</TE>

<HD>City Borough Supporters Ready for Backup Plan</HD>
<DH>Government: With their proposals apparently doomed, they
hope to help shape reform panel.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>SHARON BERNSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Several backers of apparently moribund plans to govern Los Angeles
through a series of boroughs say they will push to decentralize city
government through perhaps the only means left: a competing measure
that critics say will not bring real reform.</LD>
<LD>   Meanwhile, supporters of one borough plan--a radical proposal to
eliminate the City Council and divide Los Angeles into nine
boroughs--say they want its author, Assemblyman Bob Hertzberg
(D-Sherman Oaks), to gather signatures in hopes of placing the
measure before voters next spring if San Fernando Valley and
Hollywood secession bids fail in November.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm raising the possibility of a Hertzberg measure going forward
[after the secession election]," said Richard Close, the Valley
secession leader who said earlier this week he would favor a plan
like Hertz- berg's over secession.</LD>
<TE>   Hertzberg did not commit to an initiative campaign on Friday,
although he said he would continue to push for boroughs in Los
Angeles. "Our city needs to find a better way to govern itself," he
said.</TE>
<TE>   Council members and others who fought for a borough measure on the
Nov. 5 ballot to compete with secession say they will support an as
yet undefined plan from council President Alex Padilla to create a
better-government commission if, as expected, their proposal is
defeated by the council on Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   The proposed commission, whose 21 members would be appointed by
the City Council, mayor and city attorney, would examine ways to
reform Los Angeles government. Its recommendations would go before
the voters only with City Council approval. No date has been put
forth for when it would have to finish its work.</TE>
<TE>   Padilla fought both the Hertz- berg plan and a borough proposal by
council members Wendy Greuel and Janice Hahn.</TE>
<TE>   Critics say his commission is designed to keep power in the hands
of the City Council, and will not bring real change. Padilla said
there is too much interest in city political reform for that to
happen.</TE>
<TE>   "I believe people will be surprised when, without deadlines and
without predetermined outcomes, this commission comes forward with
specific and substantive recommendations," Padilla said.</TE>
<TE>   The council will vote on Padilla's plan on Tuesday after voting on
the Hahn-Greuel plan, which asks voters to amend the City Charter to
create a borough system.</TE>
<TE>   The much-debated Hahn-Greuel plan is expected to lose out to
Padilla's commission proposal.</TE>
<TE>   The borough plans lost momentum this week as Mayor James K. Hahn
and other secession opponents grew more confident that they could
beat back secession. A Los Angeles Times poll released last week
showed secession favored by voters in the Valley, but losing
citywide. The poll showed Hollywood secession losing both there and
throughout the city.</TE>
<TE>   But the two councilwomen hope to push Padilla into accepting
amendments to his plan.</TE>
<TE>   "Wendy and I are going to try to focus the commission more
directly, and ask for a specific date for it to be finished with its
work," said Janice Hahn. "I would also look to see language in the
mission statement ... that they would first and foremost look at
creating a system of community boroughs throughout Los Angeles."</TE>
<TE>   The fact that Padilla is proposing such a commission, Janice Hahn
and others said, shows that the animated discussion of boroughs--and
the support the idea generated among a variety of civic leaders--had
moved the council president closer to their position.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, for the first time, Padilla said he believes Los
Angeles government should be reformed, and that boroughs may be the
way to do that.</TE>
<TE>   Padilla's plan was the only one to emerge from a political melee
involving Hertzberg, Greuel, Janice Hahn, her brother Mayor Hahn, and
others. Just as Greuel and Janice Hahn were unveiling their plan to
ask voters to approve their approach, news broke that Hertzberg had
developed a plan of his own. In the end, neither proposal appeared
likely to move forward.</TE>
<TE>   A City Council source familiar with the negotiations blamed
Hertzberg's unfamiliarity with municipal politics, saying that the
former Assembly speaker was not willing to incorporate necessary
compromises into his proposal.</TE>
<TE>   Sources close to Hertzberg blamed the council, saying Greuel and
others were not willing to put forward a meaningful plan.</TE>
<TE>   Along the way, observers said, both secessionists and their
opponents may have suffered some political damage.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think the council is thinking this through," said Sherry
Bebitch Jeffe, a USC political scientist.</TE>
<TE>   The council is admitting that something is wrong with Los Angeles
government, she said, an acknowledgment that could be exploited by
the secessionist side.</TE>
<TE>   On the other hand, she said, the separatists may have been set
back when two of their leaders, Richard Close and David Fleming, said
they would support Hertzberg's plan over secession.</TE>
<TE>   Close criticized Padilla's proposal, saying it was designed to
circumvent real reform.</TE>
<TE>   "The council members and the mayor will not give up their power
and place that power in the hands of local communities," Close said.
"These will be hand-picked [commissioners] chosen by council members
who do not want to give up their power. It's a charade."</TE>

<HD>School Plan Has Fields, Not a Hotel</HD>
<DH>Land: Junipero Serra High wants undeveloped acres for
sports, office park for classrooms. City has other ideas.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAVE McKIBBEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Growing increasingly desperate to find a home for a religious high
school, Junipero Serra boosters are trying to persuade San Juan
Capistrano officials to dump plans for an office and hotel complex in
favor of school athletic fields.</LD>
<LD>   Organizers had hoped to open the school this fall on nearby land
owned by a Christian ministry. But that deal fell through nine months
ago when Rev. Robert Schuller's Rancho Capistrano ministry backed out
of allowing Junipero Serra to build on the ministry's land, saying it
was uncomfortable that religious instruction would be given by Roman
Catholics.</LD>
<LD>   Schuller's ministry plans to build a sprawling Christian center,
senior housing and a crematory on its land.</LD>
<TE>   Junipero Serra High School officials now are hoping their school
will open in fall 2003 in a Spanish-style office park across the
street from 29 acres of undeveloped land near Junipero Serra Road and
the San Diego Freeway.</TE>
<TE>   The 29 acres would be used for athletic fields. The land had been
considered for a hotel/office complex.</TE>
<TE>   School booster Roberto Brutocao said if the city is unwilling to
rezone the land to accommodate the school's athletic fields, school
officials will consider pushing for a citywide vote on the issue.</TE>
<TE>   City and school officials have had informal talks, but a request
to rezone the land for ball fields, a swimming pool and tennis courts
has not been filed.</TE>
<TE>   In a 1999 general plan update, a traffic analysis concluded that
adding schools in the city would worsen morning rush-hour traffic.</TE>
<TE>   There is a private high school--Saddleback Valley
Christian--across the railroad tracks from the planned Junipero Serra
office-complex site, and a public high school is planned a few miles
away.</TE>
<TE>   "We have to consider the traffic impacts of those schools as
opposed to an office and hotel complex," City Manager George
Scarborough said.</TE>
<TE>   There is also a financial consequence. A hotel and office park
would generate about $1 million a year in tax revenue.</TE>
<TE>   The need to raise revenue versus the desire to preserve San Juan's
small-town character is an issue in the financially pressed town.
Voters will be asked this fall whether the historic city should keep
or sell a piece of land to Home Depot.</TE>
<TE>   Junipero Serra officials said they are willing to pay a "head tax"
on each student to help defray revenue forgone from potential loss of
tax revenue from the hotel and office complex.</TE>
<TE>   Junipero Serra's initial plans call for baseball, football and
soccer fields, tennis courts, a basketball gym, an aquatic complex
and a performing arts center.</TE>
<TE>   "That's a lot more in keeping with the rural character of San Juan
Capistrano than an office/industrial complex," Brutocao said.</TE>
<TE>   About five years ago, an entertainment complex with a mega-theater
and restaurants was proposed for the area, but the developer backed
out. Brutocao said his group expects to close escrow within a week on
the 150,000-square-foot Sycamore Commons, where the classrooms would
be located.</TE>
<TE>   He said the group is in the process of purchasing the lease for
the 29 acres of undeveloped land.</TE>
<TE>   The next step would be rezoning both properties.</TE>
<TE>   But Junipero Serra backers could have another fight on their
hands.</TE>
<TE>   The Capistrano Unified School District has expressed interest in
building a middle school on the 29 undeveloped acres.</TE>

<HD>School Fields May Boot Hotel Complex</HD>
<DH>Land use: Junipero Serra High may move into offices;
commercial acres may be sports site.</DH>

<LD>Growing increasingly desperate to find a home for a religious high
school, Junipero Serra boosters are trying to persuade San Juan
Capistrano officials to dump plans for an office and hotel complex in
favor of school athletic fields.</LD>
<LD>   Organizers had hoped to open the school this fall on nearby land
owned by a Christian ministry. But that deal fell through nine months
ago when the Rev. Robert Schuller's Rancho Capistrano ministry backed
out of allowing Junipero Serra to build on the ministry's land,
saying it was uncomfortable that religious instruction would be given
by Roman Catholics.</LD>
<LD>   Schuller's ministry plans to build a sprawling Christian center,
senior housing and a crematory on its land.</LD>
<TE>   Junipero Serra High School officials now are hoping their school
will open in fall 2003 in a Spanish-style office park across the
street from 29 acres of undeveloped land near Junipero Serra Road and
the San Diego Freeway. The 29 acres would be used for athletic
fields. The land had been considered for a hotel/office complex.</TE>
<TE>   School booster Roberto Brutocao said if the city is unwilling to
rezone the land to accommodate the school's athletic fields, school
officials will consider pushing for a citywide vote on the issue.</TE>
<TE>   City and school officials have had informal talks, but a request
to rezone the land for ball fields, a swimming pool and tennis courts
has not been filed.</TE>
<TE>   In a 1999 general plan update, a traffic analysis concluded that
adding schools in the city would worsen morning rush-hour traffic.</TE>
<TE>   There is a private high school--Saddleback Valley
Christian--across the railroad tracks from the planned Junipero Serra
office-complex site, and a public high school is planned a few miles
away.</TE>
<TE>   There is also a financial consequence. A hotel and office park
would generate about $1 million a year in tax revenue.</TE>
<TE>   The need to raise revenue versus the desire to preserve San Juan's
small-town character is an issue in the financially pressed town.
Voters will be asked this fall whether the historic city should keep
or sell a piece of land to Home Depot.</TE>
<TE>   Junipero Serra officials said they are willing to pay a "head tax"
on each student to help defray revenue forgone from the hotel and
office complex.</TE>
<TE>   Junipero Serra's plans call for baseball, football and soccer
fields, tennis courts, a basketball gym, an aquatic complex and a
performing arts center.</TE>
<TE>   About five years ago, an entertainment complex with a mega-theater
and restaurants was proposed for the area, but the developer backed
out. Brutocao said his group expects to close escrow within a week on
the 150,000-square-foot Sycamore Commons, where the classrooms would
be.</TE>
<TE>   He said the group is in the process of purchasing the lease for
the 29 acres of undeveloped land. The next step would be rezoning
both properties. But Junipero Serra backers could face another fight.</TE>
<TE>   The Capistrano Unified School District has expressed interest in
building a middle school on the 29 undeveloped acres.</TE>

<HD>3 Teens Charged as Adults in Gang Rape</HD>
<DH>Crime: The trio could face life in prison for allegedly
drugging and assaulting a 16-year-old girl in Newport Beach.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MAI TRAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Prosecutors on Friday charged three teenagers--including the son of a
top Orange County sheriff's official--with dozens of counts of rape
and sexual assault, concluding that the crime was so heinous that the
defendants will be tried as adults.</LD>
<LD>   The teens are accused of drugging and gang-raping a 16-year-old
girl during a July 5 party at the Newport Beach home of Assistant
Sheriff Donald Haidl. They allegedly videotaped the attack, providing
the central evidence in the case.</LD>
<LD>   Court records released Friday allege that the teens not only raped
the unconscious girl but also assaulted her with "foreign objects,"
including a pool cue.</LD>
<TE>   Gregory Haidl, 17, who lives with his mother in Alta Loma, San
Bernardino County, was visiting his father and had friends over when
the attack allegedly occurred, authorities said.</TE>
<TE>   The two other 17-year-olds charged are Kyle Nachreiner and Keith
Spann, also of San Bernardino County.</TE>
<TE>   Authorities have not said whether Donald Haidl--or any adult--was
home when the attack allegedly occurred.</TE>
<TE>   The three suspects did not enter pleas Friday. But one of their
attorneys said the police version of events is wrong and that the
content of the 15-minute videotape is not being accurately described.</TE>
<TE>   "There's a distorted representation by Newport Beach police to the
district attorney's office of what the tape contains," said Joseph
Cavallo, an attorney representing Haidl.</TE>
<TE>   Spann's attorney, Ann Cunningham, said her client has never been
in trouble with the law before and that the allegations are totally
out of character for him. "Everyone is shocked," said Cunningham.
"He's a shy, respectful young man."</TE>
<TE>   The three defendants did not speak during a court hearing Friday
in Newport Beach, but they made angry hand gestures at reporters when
their jail van arrived at the courthouse.</TE>
<TE>   Relatives of the teens packed the courtroom, wiping away tears as
the defendants entered in handcuffs. They are being held without bail
in the juvenile section of the Santa Ana Jail.</TE>
<TE>   While acknowledging that the allegations are serious, defense
attorneys argued that the teens should not be tried as adults. Each
faces 21 felony counts. If convicted, they each face a maximum
sentence of 191 years in prison.</TE>
<TE>   Donald Haidl, the assistant sheriff in charge of the reserve
program, and his wife, Cathy, were allowed in the courtroom through a
rear door before the courtroom was opened to the public.</TE>
<TE>   Officials allowed this because Haidl has received several death
threats since his son's arrest, said Jim Amormino, spokesman for the
Orange County Sheriff's Department. Haidl was escorted by two
deputies.</TE>
<TE>   An informant, whom police would not identify, turned over the
videotape to the San Bernardino Sheriff's Department this week. With
the help of Newport Beach detectives, authorities identified the
victim and the three alleged attackers.</TE>
<TE>   Haidl is one of five assistant sheriffs reporting directly to
Sheriff Michael S. Carona. A successful businessman and longtime
political supporter of the sheriff, Haidl oversees the department's
250-person reserve program and does not take a salary from the
county.</TE>
<TE>   Sheriff's officials said the charges have not changed Haidl's job
status with the department.</TE>
<TE>   "In America, if a child commits a crime, the parent is not a
criminal," Amormino said. "Haidl is very upset and very concerned, as
any parent would be."</TE>

<HD>Teen Gets a Year at Probation Camp for Killing His Friend</HD>
<DH>Courts: Parents express relief after judge decides not to
send their son, found guilty of second- degree murder, to a state
lockup for 10 years.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MILTON CARRERO GALARZA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The thought that their 15-year-old son could have remained in a
California Youth Authority cell until the age of 25 for killing his
best friend with a rifle made Ron and Maria Simmons burst into tears
several times during his sentencing hearing Friday.</LD>
<LD>   But when a Juvenile Court judge sentenced Chris Simmons to at
least a year in the less severe county probation camp system, the
parents' sobs turned to tears of relief.</LD>
<LD>   "I'm happy," said Maria Simmons, who had not spoken publicly since
the Feb. 1 slaying at the family's home in Whittier, when her son
shot 15-year-old Nick Calamusa in the forehead.</LD>
<TE>   Police originally ruled that the shooting had been an accident,
but then pursued the case as a homicide, saying that while Chris
Simmons might not have intended to kill his friend, he should be held
accountable for pulling the trigger. In June, he was found guilty of
second-degree murder.</TE>
<TE>   The killing shook the two boys' circle of friends. They remembered
the two always together at Whittier's skate park. Many felt that,
with Chris Simmons incarcerated, they had lost two friends, not just
one.</TE>
<TE>   Justine Chavez, 15, said she had been on the phone with Calamusa
when he was shot. She said she was certain the shooting had been an
accident, and she has become Chris Simmons' confidant in the last
four months, taking his weekly calls from custody.</TE>
<TE>   "I know for a fact that he would never do that on purpose," she
said. "I know Chris, and I know Nick. They were always together, and
Chris would not have killed him on purpose."</TE>
<TE>   The prosecution did not argue that point. "We never presented
evidence saying that the minor intended to kill Nick Calamusa," said
Deputy Dist. Atty. Andrew Kim. "But it's crystal clear that
intentional and deliberate actions by the minor led to the killing."</TE>
<TE>   The hunting rifle under his father's bed and the bullets hidden in
the closet were a constant temptation for Chris Simmons, both sides
in the case agreed. He had loaded the gun in the past and had even
pulled the trigger. But "nothing came out," he told detectives. So
that afternoon, when he pointed the rifle at Calamusa, he was certain
it wouldn't fire, Chris Simmons told detectives.</TE>
<TE>   Police and the prosecution said that Chris Simmons had taken the
rifle and the bullets from his parents' room to the living room. He
and a 13-year-old friend who also was in the home at the time of the
shooting loaded the rifle and pulled the trigger several times with
no success, said Whittier Police Officer Alan Dela Pena.</TE>
<TE>   Chavez testified that the teenagers were playing with the rifle,
and that Chris Simmons was pointing it at Calamusa as Calamusa talked
on the phone.</TE>
<TE>   Calamusa asked Chris Simmons if the rifle was real, and he said
"yes."</TE>
<TE>   "Don't point it at me," Calamusa said, laughing.</TE>
<TE>   "I dare you to shoot me," he continued. "You won't do it because
you will be charged with murder."</TE>
<TE>   Then he said to Chavez, laughing: "Just so you know, if they shoot
me, you know who it was--it was Chris." The phone went dead soon
after that. Chavez said she didn't hear the gun blast.</TE>
<TE>   The parents of the two boys were initially united by the tragedy.
But as the case progressed, the families separated.</TE>
<TE>   "I went to the cemetery to visit my son today," Calamusa's mother,
Pamela Pellizzon, said at the trial. "I'm not here to give Chris
moral support. They [the parents] are responsible. They should be
locked up."</TE>
<TE>   The prosecution has not pressed charges against the Simmonses, who
will be able to visit their son on weekends at the juvenile camp,
which is run by the county Probation Department.</TE>
<TE>   The sentence imposed Friday by Long Beach Juvenile Court Judge
Gibson Lee calls for the case to be reviewed after Chris Simmons has
spent a year in custody. At that point, the youth will be freed on
home probation or ordered to continue his sentence at camp.</TE>
<TE>   In imposing the sentence, Lee said that the shooting warranted
California Youth Authority confinement, but that he had imposed a
lesser punishment in the interest of rehabilitating the boy, who was
14 at the time of the shooting.</TE>
<TE>   "I just hope the two families can be healed," Ron Simmons said.
"We have not lost as much as Nick's family, but we have a loss too."</TE>

<HD>Simon's Success Story Is a Secret</HD>
<DH>Politics: He boasts a 20% return on investments but says
rules bar him from revealing specifics.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MICHAEL FINNEGAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Day after day, Republican gubernatorial nominee Bill Simon Jr.
describes himself as a "successful businessman."</LD>
<LD>   The proof, he says, is the high rate of returns on investments by
his family's financial firm, William E. Simon &amp; Sons. But when Simon
is asked to specify how high they are, he responds: "They're
private," "I can't give them out," and "I'm not allowed to talk about
it."</LD>
<LD>   The absence of concrete data to back up Simon's self-proclaimed
success poses a growing problem for his campaign, political analysts
say. That is particularly true at a time of deep public skepticism
about the integrity of corporate America, with WorldCom, Tyco and
other companies engulfed in scandal.</LD>
<TE>   On Friday, Simon's difficulty in trying to leap from business to
government was further complicated by news, first reported in the
Wall Street Journal, that the Internal Revenue Service has named him
as a beneficiary of a possibly illegal tax shelter.</TE>
<TE>   The disclosure only underscored Simon's challenge in convincing
voters that secret balance sheets would prove his acumen--if only he
could make them public.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't see why people would believe him if he doesn't provide
evidence," said Ann Crigler, director of the Jesse Unruh Institute of
Politics at USC. "He's got to substantiate that."</TE>
<TE>   Simon and his advisors say securities rules and confidentiality
agreements with clients bar them from making public the records that
would demonstrate his success.</TE>
<TE>   But they recognize that those constraints clash with Simon's
political needs. Indeed, a key rationale of his candidacy is that
Democratic Gov. Gray Davis has mismanaged the state, and that Simon,
as a successful businessman, could do a better job.</TE>
<TE>   "There would be nothing better for the campaign than for Bill to
be able to tell you what the rates of return are," said Jeff Flint, a
senior Simon campaign advisor.</TE>
<TE>   The closest the campaign has come so far is to say that the
overall rate of return on investments by William E. Simon &amp; Sons
since 1994 has averaged more than 20% per year.</TE>
<TE>   But the campaign used a highly subjective methodology to calculate
that figure, declined to release documentation to back it up and
would not provide specific annual returns. The campaign also would
not divulge any information on investment performance from 1988, when
Simon joined the firm, to 1994.</TE>
<TE>   Simon worked full time as a top manager at the firm for 14 years.
He has taken a leave of absence for the duration of the campaign.</TE>
<TE>   In the normal course of business, William E. Simon &amp; Sons does not
track its global year-to-year returns, according to the firm.
Instead, it monitors returns only by specific investments, said
Michael Lenard, a managing director of the firm. Its $1-billion
portfolio is a labyrinth of partnerships, corporations, real estate
projects, bonds and other securities.</TE>
<TE>   Lenard did not dispute that average returns have exceeded 20% per
year since 1994, but said federal rules bar disclosure of specific
numbers. Many clients, he added, "don't want to be known," so they
require the firm to keep investment deals private.</TE>
<TE>   "They like to be under the radar; we like to be under the radar,"
Lenard said.</TE>
<TE>   But as a candidate for governor of America's most populous state,
Simon has drawn intense scrutiny to the firm from the news media and
the Davis reelection campaign.</TE>
<TE>   Davis researchers have combed through court files and reams of
other documents on William E. Simon &amp; Sons in search of material to
undercut Simon. The Davis campaign is spending millions of dollars to
publicize its most damaging findings in television ads: a savings and
loan that "went belly-up," a shipping company that "lost millions,"
Simon ties to an Enron partner "under federal investigation" for
questionable accounting practices.</TE>
<TE>   Garry South, chief strategist of the Davis campaign, called Simon
an "idiot kid" who "mucks up everything he gets his mitts on," then
denies responsibility for his business failures.</TE>
<TE>   "The guy is like a little kid in a room with a broken lamp who
swears up and down that he had absolutely nothing to do with it,"
South said. "That lamp fell off the table all by itself. He has no
idea how it occurred."</TE>
<TE>   Simon advisors say the Davis team has grossly distorted the
Republican candidate's business record and deny every accusation in
the governor's ads.</TE>
<TE>   "They're completely false and misleading," Flint said. "The voters
do not believe that Bill Simon has been a bad businessman. The voters
understand instinctively that Bill Simon has been a good businessman.
It's clear to them that he has been successful."</TE>
<TE>   With no hard data to bolster such assertions, Simon has struggled
to establish their validity.</TE>
<TE>   Now, the storm of allegations on corporate shenanigans, from
Arthur Andersen to Martha Stewart, has made the task harder.</TE>
<TE>   Ross K. Baker, a political science professor at Rutgers
University, said the political environment "has never been less
auspicious" for first-time candidates who put boardroom experience at
the top of their resumes.</TE>
<TE>   "The climate since the Enron implosion began has become very toxic
and very hostile to people from corporate America," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Simon could testify to that on Friday, when a story on the front
page of the Journal--complete with a drawing of Simon--said the
Internal Revenue Service had named him and others as beneficiaries of
possibly illegal tax shelters. Simon was not personally accused of
wrongdoing, but the story came at a time when Davis has been
hammering him for refusing to release his tax returns.</TE>
<TE>   "This is a very simple question," Davis said Friday. "Did he use
offshore tax shelters to avoid paying taxes or didn't he? I think we
all suspect that he did, or else he would have released his tax
returns by now."</TE>
<TE>   Simon, surrounded by television cameras and reporters Friday after
a hotel speech in Universal City, was asked if he had known about the
tax shelters, but did not answer. He denied any wrongdoing and
dismissed the matter as a dispute between the IRS and the accounting
firms that set up the shelters.</TE>
<TE>   "Whatever the results of that dispute are, we're certainly happy
to live with," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Over the course of the campaign, Simon, 51, has laid out his
qualifications to be governor, often citing his longtime charity work
and his three years as a Manhattan federal prosecutor in the 1980s.
But above all, he points to his work at William E. Simon &amp; Sons.</TE>
<TE>   In speeches, he frames the governor's race as a choice between a
"successful businessman" and a "career politician." Simon's ads
promote him as a "successful businessman." His Web site biography
includes a page titled "Successful Businessman."</TE>
<TE>   At a lunch with reporters last month, Simon described his work at
William E. Simon &amp; Sons as the essence of his success.</TE>
<TE>   "We started from scratch in terms of our operations," he said. "We
built up three different groups of investment professionals. We built
a back office. We built a support staff of investment professionals,
and we believe we've achieved good rates of return."</TE>
<TE>   What are the rates of return?</TE>
<TE>   "They're private," he said. "I'm not allowed to talk about it."</TE>
<TE>   But he went on to say the returns were "certainly in excess of the
benchmarks, like the stock market or the bond markets."</TE>
<TE>   The firm, based in New Jersey, was co-founded in 1988 by former
U.S. Treasury Secretary William E. Simon and his sons, J. Peter Simon
and Bill Simon Jr.</TE>
<TE>   For the first six years or so, its activities were limited to
managing the family's vast wealth, according to Lenard, the managing
director.</TE>
<TE>   The Simon brothers took control of the firm from their father in
the mid-1990s. In 1995, it was restructured as a private investment
firm. While still managing the Simon family fortune, it also raises
money from pension funds, insurance companies, foundations, wealthy
individuals and other sources. It invests the money in stocks, bonds
and other areas. Bill Simon Jr. has run the firm's Los Angeles office
since 1990.</TE>
<TE>   As a privately owned firm, all but a tiny portion of its business
is closed to public scrutiny. But Simon's firm must abide by federal
rules that govern the private sale of securities to investors. One
rule prohibits private firms such as the Simons' from selling
securities through solicitation or advertising in the media. William
E. Simon &amp; Sons and similar firms have interpreted that rule as a ban
on public disclosure of investment returns.</TE>
<TE>   U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission spokesman John Heine
declined to comment on the rule.</TE>
<TE>   But Marcel Kahan, a securities law professor at New York
University Law School, said the rule "does not trump the 1st
Amendment" in a political campaign. He said it was very unlikely that
Simon would be breaking the rule by disclosing specific rates of
return. He also said it was odd that Simon and his aides had told the
news media that the firm's returns were "good" or, as Flint put it,
"extremely favorable," but refused to give specific numbers.</TE>
<TE>   Simon "wants to have his cake and eat it too," Kahan said.</TE>
<TE>   Aside from rates of return, Flint said another sign of Simon's
success was the profusion of outside investors who do business with
the firm.</TE>
<TE>   "When very savvy institutional investors trust Bill Simon's firm
to invest their money, I think that speaks volumes about the success,
particularly in the rate of return," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Flint would not say how much of the firm's money comes from the
Simon family and how much comes from outside investors.</TE>
<TE>   The Simon campaign has declined to identify any of the firm's
clients, citing confidentiality pacts.</TE>
<TE>   As another mark of success, Flint called Simon a visionary in
California real estate. But he revealed only two of the firm's more
than 180 real estate investments--both of them Hollywood renovation
projects: the Grafton Hotel on Sunset Boulevard and an office
building at Hollywood Boulevard and Vine Street.</TE>
<TE>   As for the firm's average overall returns of more than 20% per
year since 1994, Flint said the figure applies to gains on
investments that were sold, along with the estimated change in value
of assets that were easy to appraise.</TE>
<TE>   He declined to say what portion of the firm's assets was easy to
appraise and what portion was not.</TE>

<LD>A Slick 50s gang member whose attempted-murder conviction was
overturned on appeal was sentenced Friday to five years in prison as
part of a deal that avoided another trial.</LD>
<LD>   Joshua Carlsen, 25, pleaded guilty in May to the 1998 beating and
stabbing of an Aliso Viejo teen at a party. Defense attorney Allan
Stokke said Carlsen would serve less than a year in prison with
credit for time served.</LD>
<LD>   In 2000, an Orange County Superior Court judge sentenced Carlsen
to 11 years in prison. But a state appeals court overturned the
conviction last year.</LD>
<TE>   Carlsen was among five defendants convicted in an attack that
seriously injured a 17-year-old boy, who was hit with a bottle and
stabbed.</TE>
<TE>   Prosecutors said the Slick 50s was a group of young men who
dressed in vintage 1950s clothing and prowled south Orange County
looking for trouble.</TE>

<HD>Antivenin Supplies Low</HD>
<DH>Health: Ventura County hospitals may have to share
snakebite medicine as dry weather draws rattlers closer to homes.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>KARIN GRENNAN</AU>
<BD>SPECIAL TO THE TIMES</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Hospitals are facing a critical shortage of the antivenin used to
treat rattlesnake bites at a time when the poisonous reptiles are
most likely to come in contact with people venturing outdoors.</LD>
<LD>   "It's pretty bad," said Dr. Robert Levin, public health officer
for Ventura County, where three people have been victims in the last
month. "People who have been bitten by rattlesnakes may not have
antivenin available to them."</LD>
<LD>   The limited supply of antivenin, which is manufactured by only two
companies nationwide, was threatened when the main producer, Savage
Laboratories of Melville, N.Y., had to throw away contaminated
batches made in April and May, said Dr. Rick Geller, medical director
for the California Poison Control System. The other manufacturer,
Wyeth-Ayerst, near Philadelphia, has also experienced delays, he
said.</LD>
<TE>   Rich Carvotta, pharmacy director at Los Robles Regional Medical
Center in Thousand Oaks, said this week that he had only four vials
of antivenin in stock. A single victim needs five vials to begin
treatment, and it takes a total of 12 to 20 vials to treat one
victim, he said.</TE>
<TE>   "If we get a bite victim today, we'll be on the phone within
minutes to see if we can borrow some from [other hospitals],"
Carvotta said.</TE>
<TE>   The shortage of antivenin, the preferred treatment for rattlesnake
bites, comes at the time of year when more people are outdoors, and
because of the dry weather rattlesnakes are looking for food and
water closer to houses. Statewide, physicians have reported 129
rattlesnake bites this year, down from 142 a year ago.</TE>
<TE>   Los Robles has treated seven victims since January, compared with
an average of three in an entire year, Carvotta said.</TE>
<TE>   Andrew Lemire, 35, of Thousand Oaks was bitten July 5 and
airlifted from Westlake Village Urgent Care to UCLA Medical Center,
where he was treated and released that night.</TE>
<TE>   Bruce Kanegai was bitten June 26 on a Simi Valley golf course and
treated at Simi Valley Hospital.</TE>
<TE>   Six days earlier, Richard Green of Thousand Oaks was bitten on the
hand as he attempted to remove a 4-foot snake from a neighbor's yard.
The 79-year-old retired police officer drove himself to a Kaiser
facility in Thousand Oaks, but when he arrived, barely able to walk,
he found the hospital didn't have any antivenin.</TE>
<TE>   An ambulance took Green to Los Robles. Incoherent and lapsing in
and out of consciousness, Green was given the hospital's entire
supply of antivenin, five vials, and staff began calling other
hospitals to find the additional six vials needed.</TE>
<TE>   Green is still suffering pain and dizziness but said he feels
lucky to have survived.</TE>
<TE>   Simi Valley Hospital didn't need to go begging when Kanegai
arrived, spokesman Jeremy Brewer said. Kanegai, a 54-year-old art
teacher, was bitten on his left calf while searching for a friend's
ball in the rough at Lost Canyons Golf Club. He received 19 vials of
antivenin during his treatment.</TE>
<TE>   Kanegai is still in constant pain and uses crutches to walk.</TE>
<TE>   "I've been hit by a car, walked through a glass window, been hit
by a boulder off a mountaintop and had my head split open by a
surfboard," Kanegai said. "After a week, I bounced back. This has
been the most painful, the most crippling thing."</TE>
<TE>   Antivenin is not the only treatment for bites. Transfusions and
surgery may be necessary without antivenin, according to the poison
control system, but the chances of surviving are very good.</TE>
<TE>   Simi Valley Hospital still had 24 vials and Ventura County Medical
Center, which treats far fewer rattlesnake bites, had 10 to 12
antivenin vials in stock this week.</TE>
<TE>   If hospitals share their antivenin, there will be enough to get
through the year, Geller said. The California Poison Control System
and the California Health Care Assn. started a program three weeks
ago that allows hospitals to provide weekly updates on their
antivenin inventory and receive a regional list. But only about 12%
of the state's hospitals are participating.</TE>

<HD>Trial in Yosemite Killings to Begin</HD>
<DH>Crime: Cary Stayner is serving life for another murder. The
state seeks the death penalty for the slayings of a woman, her
daughter and a friend.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>SAN JOSE</DL>
<LD>It is one of the most infamous crimes in California history: A woman,
her daughter and a friend disappeared while visiting Yosemite
National Park and were savagely killed by the handyman at their
motel. Caught months later after beheading a nature guide, Cary
Stayner gave the FBI a detailed confession to all four slayings.</LD>
<LD>   Three years later, Stayner, 40, is finally going on trial for
killing the tourists, with opening statements expected Monday. The
trial was moved to San Jose because of intense publicity in Mariposa
County, where the killings occurred.</LD>
<LD>   Despite the notoriety, there is an anticlimactic aspect to
Stayner's trial. He already is serving life without parole in federal
prison after pleading guilty to killing the park guide, Joie
Armstrong.</LD>
<TE>   But state prosecutors want to execute him.</TE>
<TE>   Stayner, who once said he would prefer the death penalty to life
in prison, has pleaded innocent by reason of insanity. Executing him
will require slogging through a trial expected to last almost three
months and cost taxpayers $3 million. Then there are the appeals.</TE>
<TE>   "You have to imagine there are better ways of spending the money,
even though I support the death penalty," said Ken Hawkins, the
auditor for Mariposa County.</TE>
<TE>   The county, with a population of just 16,000 and an annual budget
of $31 million, has spent $940,000 on the case and expects to shell
out at least $2 million more for the prosecution's costs and
Stayner's defense.</TE>
<TE>   Most of the costs will be reimbursed by the state.</TE>
<TE>   Stayner is charged with murder, kidnapping and special
circumstances that could bring the death penalty--including sexual
assault and attempted rape--in the killings of Carole Sund, 42, her
daughter Juliana, 15, and Silvina Pelosso, a 16-year-old friend from
Argentina.</TE>
<TE>   The three disappeared while visiting the park in February 1999.
Their burned-out rental car was found a month later with Carole
Sund's and Silvina's bodies in the trunk. They had been strangled.</TE>
<TE>   A week later, Juliana's body was discovered in a thicket near a
remote lake, after Stayner had mailed the FBI a letter with a map
directing agents to the scene. Her throat had been slashed.</TE>
<TE>   After his arrest, Stayner told the FBI that killing the tourists
made him feel "like I was in control for the first time in my life."
He said he sexually assaulted Juliana after killing the others, and
that she had begged him to end her misery.</TE>

<HD>Virk Guilty; Sanity Phase Next</HD>
<DH>Court: Port Hueneme woman tried to drown her children. Jury
must assess her mental state.</DH>
<SE></SE>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A Port Hueneme woman was convicted on two counts of attempted murder
Friday after a jury concluded she deliberately tried to drown her
children in Channel Islands Harbor two years ago.</LD>
<LD>   Jurors deliberated for less than a day before finding Narinder
Virk, 42, guilty on both counts. They further found that Virk
inflicted great bodily injury on her then 6-year-old daughter during
the incident.</LD>
<LD>   The case now proceeds to a second phase in which the same jurors
must decide whether Virk was sane at the time of the crime.</LD>
<TE>   Virk was arrested after an Oxnard resident pulled the fully
clothed woman, her daughter and 9-year-old son out of the harbor on
Jan. 12, 2000.</TE>
<TE>   According to the children's testimony, Virk woke them in the
middle of the night, led them to the marina and pushed them off a
boat dock before jumping in herself. The children, now 8 and 11, did
not know how to swim.</TE>
<TE>   Senior Deputy Dist. Atty. Richard Simon argued that Virk
intentionally tried to drown her children to punish her allegedly
abusive husband.</TE>
<TE>   Virk's attorney, Deputy Public Defender Cynthia Ellington, said
her client suffered a breakdown after her husband boarded a plane for
India with plans to divorce her. Ellington argued that Virk was
psychotic at the time of the incident and could not form the intent
to kill.</TE>
<TE>   Jurors began deliberations in the case late Thursday and came back
with a verdict late Friday afternoon.</TE>
<TE>   Virk remained free on $500,000 bail.</TE>

<HD>Passenger Use Is Up 4.3% at John Wayne</HD>
<DH>Airport: Traffic posts 3rd straight monthly rise despite
the sluggish economy and 9/11.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>STANLEY ALLISON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Passenger traffic at John Wayne Airport increased again in June over
last year's number, the third monthly rise in a row.</LD>
<LD>   The numbers continued returning to normal levels following the
steep decline immediately after the Sept. 11 attacks.</LD>
<LD>   In June 2001, 685,949 passengers flew out of John Wayne, airport
officials said. For the same month in 2002, 715,613 used the
facility, an increase of 4.3%.</LD>
<TE>   Airport officials are heartened by the trend because some
observers predicted the sluggish economy, even more so than last
fall's terrorist attacks, would prompt many Americans to drive, not
fly, to vacation destinations this summer.</TE>
<TE>   Airport spokesman Justin McCusker said John Wayne is rebounding
partly because most of its flights are domestic.</TE>
<TE>   The short and mid-range flights "came back faster than other types
of flights at other airports," he said.</TE>
<TE>   He added that despite Sept. 11, "We did not experience the same
type of downturn that was experienced in some other areas. Our
business travelers ... were still flying."</TE>
<TE>   Not all the numbers were good, however. Commuter-carrier, or
air-taxi operations, were down by nearly half for June 2002 from the
previous year.</TE>
<TE>   Commuter traffic decreased almost 45% after Delta Connections and
United Express cut their service following the Sept. 11 attacks.</TE>

<HD>Bush's Troublesome Week May Be Just the Beginning</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RONALD BROWNSTEIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>This week, President Bush spent more time on the defensive than at
any point since Sept. 11--and possibly since he took office.</LD>
<LD>   In grueling succession, Bush endured stinging questions about his
personal business dealings, received mostly negative reviews for the
major speech he delivered on corporate responsibility, confronted
signs that even congressional Republicans considered his response
inadequate to the firestorm and ended the week with the grim news
that the government was heading toward its largest budget deficit
since the mid-1990s.</LD>
<LD>   In all, Bush has probably had a rougher week than anyone in public
life this side of beleaguered major league baseball Commissioner Bud
Selig.</LD>
<TE>   Analysts in both parties say the turbulence is unlikely to
immediately affect Bush's astronomical job approval ratings. A CBS
News Poll taken early in the week, before all the bad news
accumulated, found that 74% of Americans still gave him positive
marks for the way he was handling his job.</TE>
<TE>   But the week may mark a turning point for Bush that opens a period
of rougher political conflict. Since Sept. 11, Democrats have been
reluctant to sharply criticize him for two main reasons: the wartime
atmosphere and his high approval ratings. The lofty ratings fed on
themselves by discouraging criticism that might have dented the
president's standing.</TE>
<TE>   But this week, as chinks opened in Bush's armor, Democrats became
much bolder in their challenges to him on both the personal and
policy front.</TE>
<TE>   ''The people who don't agree with Bush, many of whom had been
reluctant to question him ... found out this week you can raise
legitimate issues, you can criticize the president and you don't wake
up the next morning with a horse's head in your bed,'' said
Democratic consultant Joe Lockhart, former White House press
secretary for President Clinton.</TE>
<TE>   Some Republicans believe the rapidly escalating Democratic
rhetoric still risks alienating Americans leery of partisanship in
the long shadow of the terrorist attacks.</TE>
<TE>   ''The Democrats are ratcheting up the partisan rhetoric, and
that's a blunder,'' said GOP pollster David Winston. ''Given this
post-Sept. 11 environment, that will be viewed as a negative. People
want their problems solved.''</TE>
<TE>   Though White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer on Friday
dismissed the turmoil as ''noise about nothing,'' the news this week
for Bush, from a political perspective, was almost all bad:</TE>
<TE>   * On Monday, at a White House news conference, Bush was barraged
with questions about his 1990 sale of stock in Harken Energy Corp., a
company on whose board he sat. Under the intense questioning, Bush at
times appeared shaky and unprepared.</TE>
<TE>   * On Tuesday, Bush in his much-anticipated Wall Street speech
endorsed new measures to combat securities fraud and reform corporate
governance that constituted a sharp turn in direction for an
administration that arrived in Washington pledging to reduce federal
regulation of business. But the speech was battered by critics,
including many in the business world, who said it didn't go far
enough. Many analysts portrayed the sharp decline of the stock
markets following the address as a vote of no-confidence in the
president's response.</TE>
<TE>   * On Wednesday, as if to underscore the sense that Bush had been
too cautious, the Senate voted unanimously to pass
Democratic-sponsored legislation giving prosecutors new authority to
pursue securities fraud. Bush had pointedly declined to endorse that
measure in his speech Tuesday.</TE>
<TE>   * On Thursday, Bush awoke to newspaper accounts about the $180,375
in low-interest loans he had received from Harken while serving as a
company director--a practice he had urged companies to ban in his
Tuesday speech.</TE>
<TE>   * On Friday, Office of Management and Budget Director Mitchell E.
Daniels released figures showing that the government would run a
$165-billion deficit this year. That's the first deficit since 1997
and the largest since 1994. Daniels blamed the war on terrorism and
the economic slowdown; Democrats immediately fingered the
$1.35-trillion tax cut Bush pushed through Congress last year.</TE>
<TE>   For the White House and Democrats alike, the overriding question
is whether these developments foreshadow any long-term vulnerability
for Bush on either the policy or personal fronts.</TE>
<TE>   On the questions about Bush's business dealings, analysts in both
parties don't yet see many signs of damage. Trust in Bush remains
substantial; in the CBS survey, nearly three-fifths of those polled
said they believed he would do the right thing to prevent business
abuses. An equal share said they believed most members of his
administration were honest.</TE>
<TE>   ''The Democrats are cutting fundamentally against the grain of the
perceptions the American people have about this president,'' White
House Communications Director Dan Bartlett said Friday. ''What
[voters] don't buy are these assertions that he is somehow dishonest
or untrustworthy.''</TE>
<TE>   Similarly, one senior Democratic operative said: ''We're not
kidding ourselves; the guy got paper cuts. This happens to be the
first time Superman has bled. But he's not on life support.''</TE>
<TE>   But as in any Washington accusation of wrongdoing, those judgments
are subject to revision based on new developments. At the least, some
believe the White House has assured that questions about Bush's
business past will remain alive--and continue to generate
headaches--by refusing requests from Senate Majority Leader Tom
Daschle (D-S.D.) to release all Securities and Exchange Commission
documents on the stock sale.</TE>
<TE>   ''These documents are going to be seen,'' said Lockhart, a veteran
of the Clinton scandal wars.</TE>
<TE>   On the policy front, the cascade of Senate votes for measures that
extend well beyond Bush's proposals clearly indicated that he had
lost control of the debate over corporate accountability--at least
for now. What remains to be seen is whether he can soften the
provisions he considers excessive when the legislation moves into a
House-Senate conference committee.</TE>
<TE>   Bartlett may have signaled the president's limited running room
Friday when he said Bush would accept the new securities fraud
provisions the Senate unanimously endorsed earlier this week.</TE>
<TE>   Democrats also saw opportunities to recast other issues in light
of Bush's struggles. House Minority Leader Richard A. Gephardt
(D-Mo.) flagged Friday what may become a common refrain among
Democratic candidates when he argued that the wave of corporate
scandals should make voters more suspicious of GOP plans to let
workers invest part of their Social Security money on Wall Street.</TE>
<TE>   ''If the recent revelations [of corporate corruption] aren't a
compelling argument against gambling Social Security on the stock
market, I don't know what is,'' Gephardt said.</TE>
<TE>   The biggest target in the emerging political argument could be the
economy. Already, Bush's poll ratings on handling the economy run
well below his overall approval rating. It's likely that Democrats
will attempt to link the Wall Street scandals, the sinking stock
markets and the rising federal deficit into a single charge that Bush
is mismanaging the economy.</TE>
<TE>   Indeed, one of the biggest uncertainties in both parties is
whether November's election climate will be shaped more by Bush's
war-fortified approval rating or the growing anxiety about the
country's direction, driven by concern over the economy and the stock
markets.</TE>
<TE>   ''People trust the president, but they have this real sense of
uncertainty,'' said Winston. ''What sort of political environment
does that generate for the fall? I think that's unclear.''</TE>

<LD>An attempt from Manchester to return an orphaned killer whale to her
home waters off Vancouver Island in Canada was put off for a day when
the boat donated for the task could not get up to speed.</LD>
<LD>   Officials of Vancouver Aquarium in British Columbia said another
attempt will be made early today.</LD>
<LD>   The 2-year-old orca remains in her pen and reportedly is fine.</LD>
<TE>   Experts from Vancouver Aquarium will care for the whale on her
12-hour trip north and after she is unloaded into Johnstone Strait,
the narrowest passage between Vancouver Island and the mainland.</TE>
<TE>   The hope is that the whale will rejoin her family when those
whales return to the strait for the summer, probably this month.</TE>
<TE>   The whale has spent the last month in a 40-by-40-foot net pen,
eating about 60 pounds of fish a day while being treated for a skin
condition and worms.</TE>
<TE>   The capture, treatment and eventual release marks unprecedented
cooperation between the National Marine Fisheries Service and
Canada's Department of Fisheries and Oceans, which is overseeing the
orca's trip home.</TE>

<LD>The son of a prominent Washington businessman was critically injured
when an apparent pipe bomb blew up as he was starting his father's
vehicle in a basement garage.</LD>
<LD>   Wright Sigmund, 21, is a student and the son of insurance
executive Donald Sigmund. The younger Sigmund has been living in
Georgetown for the summer, according to his mother, and was borrowing
his father's vehicle.</LD>
<LD>   The 2 p.m. blast in the garage sent thick black smoke billowing
onto the street and prompted the evacuation of stores, offices and
restaurants for at least a block surrounding the building.</LD>
<TE>   There were worries that it might be terrorism, but police and FBI
officials said their preliminary investigation showed no such signs.</TE>
<TE>   Sigmund was taken to a hospital, where officials said he was
having surgery for burns and trauma.</TE>
<TE>   Police said they recovered bits of pipe and wiring apparently used
to make the bomb but said nothing else about its composition.</TE>
<TE>   "He turned the ignition on, and it blew up," said Sigmund's
mother, Claire Phillips of Dallas.</TE>

<DL></DL>
<LD>The family of a Minnesota man who died after a knee graft filed suit
against the company that provided the tissue, claiming it came from
an infected cadaver.</LD>
<LD>   Surgeons planted the cartilage Nov. 7 into the knee of Brian
Lykins, 23. He died four days later.</LD>
<LD>   Health investigators found a deadly bacterium in his body and in
the cadaver from which the cartilage was lifted.</LD>
<TE>   The lawsuit says tissue bank CryoLife Inc. of Kennesaw left the
cadaver at room temperature for 19 hours and failed to test the
tissue.</TE>
<TE>   CryoLife spokesman Roy Vogeltanz said the company would not
comment on pending litigation.</TE>
<TE>   The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta said in
March that at least 14 people had contracted infections after tissue
transplants from CryoLife.</TE>

<HD>Deficit Will Hit $165 Billion, White House Says</HD>
<DH>Budget: It's the first year in the red since '97, and well
over predictions. White House blames an inherited economy; Democrats
fault tax cut.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>EDWIN CHEN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The White House said Friday that this year's federal budget will run
a deficit of about $165 billion, the first time since 1997 that
Washington has spent more money than it has taken in.</LD>
<LD>   The return to red ink was not a surprise, but the deficit's size
is larger than anticipated. Bush administration officials also warned
that a balanced budget may not reappear until 2005, at the earliest.</LD>
<LD>   "This is a fragile recovery still," said White House Budget
Director Mitchell E. Daniels Jr. He also suggested that tough
spending restraints are in order: "When we are trying very hard to
get back to balance, every dollar counts."</LD>
<TE>   Daniels' deficit projections ignited a new round of partisan
finger-pointing, capping a week of wrangling between Republicans and
Democrats on an array of issues.</TE>
<TE>   The White House blamed the deficit on a weak economy that it says
it inherited from the Clinton administration, as well as on the war
against terrorism and the "whipsaw" effect of a soaring stock market
that has plummeted.</TE>
<TE>   Democrats blamed President Bush's 10-year, $1.35-trillion tax cut
Congress enacted last year and what they called Bush's insufficient
response to the corporate scandals now sapping investor confidence.</TE>
<TE>   They also accused the White House of presenting too rosy a picture
in order to shield the president from further political fallout.</TE>
<TE>   The deficit projections and the political debate set the stage for
Bush's scheduled speech in Birmingham, Ala., on Monday on the
economy. The president will be "sharing with the public some of his
thoughts about the strength of the economy and some of the underlying
factors and fundamental strengths that are found in the economy,"
said White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer.</TE>
<TE>   The Congressional Budget Office earlier had projected a deficit of
about $100 billion.</TE>
<TE>   If the latest projection proves accurate for the fiscal year that
ends Sept. 30, the government would record its largest shortfall
since 1994. In 1998, the government recorded its first surplus ($69.2
billion) since 1969.</TE>
<TE>   For fiscal year 2001, the $127-billion surplus was no surprise.
The largest deficit on record was $290.4 billion, in 1992.</TE>
<TE>   Even before Daniels officially released the numbers Friday
afternoon, White House officials set out to put their own spin on the
news.</TE>
<TE>   Fleischer said at his daily briefing that the economic downturn
would have been worse had it not been for Bush's across-the-board tax
cut. That measure, he argued, promoted growth.</TE>
<TE>   "Last fall ... the economy was in recession. The first quarter of
this year, the economy grew by more than 6 percentage points, in good
part spurred by the tax cut," he said. "It was a perfectly timed tax
cut."</TE>
<TE>   "The factors that have contributed [to the deficit] are the fact
that we went into a recession as a nation in March of 2001,"
Fleischer added, "as well as the fact that we were a nation that went
to war in September of 2001, which led to a large amount of increase
in federal spending for homeland security and for the defensive needs
of our nation--properly so."</TE>
<TE>   A final contributing factor, he said, is the drop in capital gains
revenues as a result of the plummeting stock market.</TE>
<TE>   On Capitol Hill, Democrats charged that the White House's new
projections attempt to paper over a steadily worsening fiscal
situation.</TE>
<TE>   "They have now wandered off to fantasy land and are seriously
understating the deficits and buildup in debt that we're facing,"
said Sen. Kent Conrad (D-N.D.), chairman of the Senate Budget
Committee.</TE>
<TE>   "The markets are voting every day on the credibility of this
economic team," Conrad said, "and they're giving a thumbs down."</TE>
<TE>   Rep. John M. Spratt Jr. of South Carolina, the top Democrat on the
House Budget Committee, attacked the assumption by the White House
that the federal budget may return to surplus by fiscal 2005.</TE>
<TE>   "We're skeptical, to say the least, about the numbers they've
released."</TE>
<TE>   Daniels told reporters that the 2005 target date for a possible
return to a balanced budget is based on "three big ifs": the economy,
the war on terrorism and spending. Those projections also are based
on the assumption of a "modest" growth in revenues of between 5% and
6% annually, compared with 7.5% in the last decade, he said.</TE>
<TE>   In several speeches in recent months, Bush has assiduously sought
to inoculate himself against political fallout for presiding over the
nation's return to an era of red ink.</TE>
<TE>   Time and again, he recalled an interview that he said he gave to a
reporter in Chicago during the 2000 presidential campaign.</TE>
<TE>   According to Bush, he told the reporter that he would not deficit
spend unless the nation found itself at war, in a national emergency
and in a recession.</TE>
<TE>   His punch line: "Never did I dream that we'd have a trifecta!"</TE>
<TE>   On another budget issue, Pentagon Comptroller Dov Zackheim called
a news conference to warn members of Congress that the Defense
Department would be unable to pay personnel and would begin shutting
down programs if lawmakers leave for their August recess without
approving emergency spending for military operations.</TE>
<TE>   While acknowledging that the Pentagon has often engaged in fiscal
"hand-wringing," he said this time the cash crunch is acute.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm not crying wolf here. This is what's going to happen,"
Zackheim said. "This is not a good signal to send to some of the bad
guys out there.... The fact is that wars cost money."</TE>
<TE>   Bush asked Congress this year to approve about $27 billion in
supplemental funding for the military and other anti-terrorism
expenses.</TE>
<TE>   A $29-billion version of the bill has passed the House; a
$31.5-billion bill has passed the Senate.</TE>
<TE>   Lawmakers are trying to produce a compromise. Bush budget
officials have threatened to veto a compromise bill if it goes beyond
what the House approved.</TE>

<CP>PHOTO: President Bush gets a hug from a boy at Camp
Greentop, a 65-year-old facility for disabled children that borders
the presidential Camp David retreat in Maryland's Catoctin Mountains.
"I'm proud to know my neighbors have got so much love and
compassion," Bush said. He toured a horse barn, danced the "hokey
pokey" and took part in a baseball game, in which he grounded out to
first base. At the camp, the president tried to avoid questions about
corporate accounting scandals. When he was asked about the first
meeting of his corporate fraud task force Friday, Bush said it went
"great" but didn't provide any specifics as to what was discussed.</CP>

<HD>Court Tells a Bitten Dog Groomer in Kentucky It Comes With

<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>FRANKFORT, Ky.</DL>
<LD>Dog groomers beware: If the chow chomps, it's all part of the job, a
court decided Friday.</LD>
<LD>   The Kentucky Court of Appeals ruling, which upheld a lower court
decision, came in the case of dog groomer Kathy Jordan, who got
bitten in the face by a chow and filed a lawsuit against its owner,
Kevin Lusby.</LD>
<LD>   The three-judge panel decided Jordan never presented any evidence
Lusby specifically knew his dog was vicious.</LD>
<TE>   "When Jordan accepted the dog for grooming, she assumed the risk
of being bitten by the dog," Judge Julia Tackett wrote.</TE>
<TE>   The judges did agree with Jordan that a dog owner is liable for
its actions, but decided Jordan was the owner while she had the chow
in her care.</TE>
<TE>   "Owner in this case does not simply mean a person with a property
interest in the dog," Tackett wrote. "The statute does not make a
distinction between the legal owner or a second party owner; we see
no reason to create one here."</TE>

<LD>A court must reconsider its order allowing a U.S.-born suspected
Taliban fighter to meet with his lawyers, because the judge did not
adequately address the government's position that the prisoner is an
enemy combatant, an appeals court ruled Friday.</LD>
<LD>   A three-judge panel of the U.S. 4th Circuit Court of Appeals

<HD>Journalist Must Testify in Lindh Case, Judge Rules</HD>
<DH>Courts: Federal jurist and defense attorney debate ground
rules for next week's hearing on statements made by accused American
Talib.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD A. SERRANO</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>ALEXANDRIA, Va.</DL>
<LD>A federal judge refused Friday to block a Southern California
freelance journalist from testifying in the John Walker Lindh case,
setting the stage for a critical hearing next week on whether
allegedly incriminating statements Lindh gave to his captors in
Afghanistan should be allowed in his upcoming trial.</LD>
<LD>   Also Friday, as a preview of how contentious the weeklong hearing
is likely to be, Lindh's chief defense attorney and the judge engaged
in a lengthy near-shouting match over how the defense should be
allowed to present its case when the hearing begins Monday.</LD>
<LD>   James J. Brosnahan said he wants to present videos and other
electronic props while his witnesses are testifying, but Judge T.S.
Ellis III made it clear that he wants a streamlined hearing that will
end by Friday.</LD>
<TE>   "We're not going to proceed as though this is some sort of
show-biz operation," the judge warned Brosnahan.</TE>
<TE>   But the San Francisco defense lawyer held his ground, arguing that
he wants to do everything he can to vigorously defend Lindh, a
21-year-old from Marin County who was captured last fall fighting for
the Taliban.</TE>
<TE>   He told the judge that in 43 years as an attorney he had never
been denied the opportunity to show evidence to his witnesses in
court. Then, pointing at Lindh, he said he expected to be able to do
so next week.</TE>
<TE>   "There's no show biz here, your honor," Brosnahan said.</TE>
<TE>   The dispute ended with Ellis indicating that he will decide how
much of an electronic presentation is necessary as he hears testimony
on whether Lindh's statements to military and FBI interrogators
should be allowed in his trial, which is set to begin Aug. 26.</TE>
<TE>   Next week's hearing is crucial because Lindh's statements are seen
as the heart of the government's case against him, and it would be a
major victory for the defense to persuade the judge to suppress them
from the trial.</TE>
<TE>   The defense plans to call eight to 10 witnesses to show that Lindh
was physically abused, deprived of food and medical care and kept in
inhumane conditions because U.S. authorities wanted to continue
interrogating him.</TE>
<TE>   The government said it hoped to call about a dozen witnesses,
including many of Lindh's interrogators during half a dozen sessions
in the first weeks of December. But the judge told prosecutors to
consider reducing the number of witnesses because he did not want to
hear repetitive testimony.</TE>
<TE>   One of the key witnesses for both sides is Robert Young Pelton, a
freelance journalist from Redondo Beach. He conducted a brief video
interview with Lindh soon after his capture in Afghanistan that was
shown on CNN.</TE>
<TE>   Pelton, subpoenaed by the defense to testify, asked the judge to
quash the summons, arguing that it endangers him as a foreign war
correspondent. He said terrorists might seek retribution against him
and cited the slaying of Wall Street Journal reporter Daniel Pearl in
Pakistan.</TE>
<TE>   But the judge refused and said Pelton should make himself
available to take the witness stand next week.</TE>
<TE>   His testimony might benefit the defense case because, as a neutral
observer, he presumably could testify about Lindh's physical
condition after his arrest and the way he was treated by his U.S.
captors.</TE>
<TE>   Also, after the video aired, Pelton was interviewed by CNN about
his impressions of Lindh.</TE>
<TE>   At one point, he said of Lindh: "His goal was not to fight against
America. He got caught up in a war when it started shortly after
Sept. 11. So I don't think he deliberately went to fight against
American interests.... At no time during my conversation with him did
he give me negative opinions about America or say anything bad about
our country."</TE>
<TE>   He also recalled that once U.S. Special Forces realized Lindh was
an American, "one of the Green Berets guys offered to shoot him."</TE>
<TE>   Pelton could also be helpful for the government. He could testify
that Lindh was never purposely tortured to get him to talk, but
rather that he was kept shackled and tied to a gurney because he was
a prisoner of war in a very hostile environment.</TE>

<HD>Senate OKs Ban on Loans to Executives</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>RICHARD SIMON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Senate on Friday unanimously voted to prohibit public companies
from making personal loans to their top executives, further
toughening a far-reaching bill on corporate regulation expected to
gain final approval next week.</LD>
<LD>   President Bush, in his speech Tuesday on Wall Street, called on
companies to ban insider loans. But Democrats who control the Senate
went further, voting to write the ban into law.</LD>
<LD>   "This is wrong. It must be stopped," said Sen. Charles E. Schumer
(D-N.Y.), who proposed the ban. "Why can't these corporate executives
go to the bank like everybody else?"</LD>
<TE>   Corporate loans have gained scrutiny after disclosures that
insiders at Enron Corp., WorldCom Inc. and other scandal-plagued
companies received huge company loans even as the businesses were
suffering massive losses. The issue also was highlighted by a new
focus this week on low-interest loans that Bush received from Harken
Energy Corp. while serving on its board in the late 1980s.</TE>
<TE>   The loan ban was one of several amendments to an accounting reform
bill that has become the vehicle for other proposals to crack down on
corporate corruption. Another amendment, unanimously approved Friday,
would extend a requirement for chief executives to certify the
accuracy of their company's financial statements to include
executives of U.S. companies that move to offshore tax havens such as
Bermuda.</TE>
<TE>   The virtual unanimity developing behind the bill, sponsored by
Sen. Paul S. Sarbanes (D-Md.), was demonstrated by a 91-2 vote to
limit debate. That means a final vote is likely to occur Monday.</TE>
<TE>   The Senate action came as Bush sought to highlight his own efforts
to respond to the spate of corporate scandals, meeting with the
leaders of his newly established Corporate Fraud Task Force.</TE>
<TE>   Bush created the task force to better coordinate government
efforts to prosecute corporate corruption cases. White House Press
Secretary Ari Fleischer said the task force demonstrates "that this
government will take every action necessary against people who cook
the books or change the numbers in any type of fraudulent way.... I
think corporate America knows the government is serious about this."</TE>
<TE>   Fleischer refused to be drawn into a discussion of the particulars
of a corporate reform bill that Bush would sign, even as Senate
Majority Leader Tom Daschle (D-S.D.) renewed his call for the
president to give "clear and unequivocal" support for the measure.
Daschle said such a signal from Bush would make it more likely that a
tough bill will emerge from Congress.</TE>
<TE>   The Senate bill would have to be reconciled with a measure
approved by the GOP-controlled House. Democrats say the House bill
doesn't go far enough to make corporate officers more accountable for
their financial statements and ensure that accountants fully and
honestly audit company books.</TE>
<TE>   Although the Senate bill goes further than Bush's reform
proposals, it has been gaining support even among Republicans who
usually oppose increased regulation.</TE>
<TE>   Sen. Larry E. Craig (R-Idaho), one of the chamber's most
conservative members, told colleagues Friday, "A good many
stockholders, a good many pension plans, a good many retirement
plans, are asking us, 'What are we going to do about the meltdown
that occurred in corporate America?' "</TE>
<TE>   Senate Minority Leader Trent Lott (R-Miss.) said he will vote for
the bill, increasing the pressure on Bush and House Republicans to
also support it.</TE>
<TE>   But Sen. Phil Gramm of Texas, a key Republican on financial
issues, cautioned that the final bill could change dramatically once
House-Senate negotiators meet to reconcile their differences.</TE>
<TE>   Some lawmakers are continuing efforts to strengthen the Senate
bill, arguing that it still would not go far enough to restore
investor confidence shaken by scandal.</TE>
<TE>   A bipartisan group of senators--led by Carl Levin (D-Mich.) and
John McCain (R-Ariz.)--plans to try Monday to get a vote on a measure
that could lead to requiring companies to count stock options as an
expense on their books. But they are expected to be blocked.</TE>
<TE>   They were the two who voted Friday against limiting debate on the
bill. Levin says current stock option accounting rules allowed Enron
to greatly inflate earnings.</TE>
<TE>   Opponents of expensing stock options, which give the right to buy
company shares at a set price in the future, have said it is
difficult to estimate the future value of options.</TE>
<TE>   In his Wall Street speech, Bush called for shareholder approval of
stock options to executives.</TE>
<TE>   The loan ban added to the Senate bill--which provides an exception
for home loans--drew criticism from some quarters.</TE>
<TE>   Kevin Murphy, a USC professor and executive pay specialist, said
the ban "is an ill-advised, knee-jerk reaction" to the scandals. Such
loans play a useful role in recruiting executives by helping them buy
company stock, and executive stock ownership is prized by public
investors, he said.</TE>
<TE>   If the ban does become law, companies will find other ways to
compensate top managers, said Jeffrey Christian, chief executive of
Christian &amp; Timbers, an executive search firm in Cleveland.</TE>
<TE>   Separately, Rep. Henry A. Waxman (D-Los Angeles) sent Bush a
letter urging him to set a "powerful example for our nation's senior
executives" by donating all or a portion of the profits from the sale
of nearly $850,000 worth of stock in a Texas-based energy firm 12
years ago. Just weeks after Bush sold the stock, its value plummeted.</TE>
<TE>   White House spokeswoman Claire Buchan dismissed the letter as
"more political posturing." Bush has disputed the notion that he had
sought to enrich himself improperly or to hide the transaction.</TE>

this report.</TE>

<HD>Cracks in Fuel Lines Ground All Shuttles</HD>
<DH>Space: The fleet is sidelined for at least two months over
potentially disastrous flaws.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla.</DL>
<LD>NASA's shuttle fleet was grounded Friday for at least two more months
because of small fuel-line cracks that the space agency fears could
splinter into dangerous chunks of metal.</LD>
<LD>   "We're not going to fly until we're satisfied that we understand
this problem," shuttle program manager Ron Dittemore said.</LD>
<LD>   At the same time, NASA is being criticized by its own inspector
general's office for failing to provide adequate safety oversight
over shuttle launching preparations by the contractor.</LD>
<TE>   All four space shuttles apparently have been flying with the
cracks for quite some time, perhaps since the beginning of the
21-year-old program, Dittemore said.</TE>
<TE>   In all, 11 cracks have been discovered over the last month, three
each in Atlantis, Discovery and Columbia and two in Endeavour. The
cracks are about the same size--one-tenth to three-tenths of an inch
in length.</TE>
<TE>   The cracks are in the metal liners used to direct the flow of
super-cold hydrogen fuel to the main engines. Columbia's liners are
made of stainless steel; the liners in the other shuttles are a
nickel alloy.</TE>
<TE>   Dittemore said he does not know why the cracks were not discovered
before now. "That's something we're going to ask," he said. The
larger cracks are visible to the naked eye.</TE>
<TE>   The original material for the liners may have been flawed from the
start, Dittemore said. When the liners were welded into place, the
metal may have been stressed, he said. Age is not considered a factor
since the cracks have been found in NASA's oldest shuttle as well as
its newest.</TE>
<TE>   Columbia's research flight with the first Israeli astronaut is on
indefinite hold; it had been set for a July 19 liftoff. An Aug. 22
launch by Atlantis on a flight to the international space station is
also off. Dittemore said the earliest a shuttle could launch is
September.</TE>
<TE>   If any of the cracks were to grow, chips of the metal could break
off and end up in a main engine during liftoff. A piece of metal
flying into a turbine rotating at thousands of revolutions per minute
could have disastrous consequences.</TE>
<TE>   Dittemore said engineers might conclude after a few more weeks of
analysis that the cracks will not grow and no repairs will be needed.</TE>
<TE>   But just in case, engineers are considering such repairs as
welding or grinding or cutting out the cracks, without removing the
actual plumbing.</TE>
<TE>   It would be difficult to pull out the fuel lines, which are 1 foot
in diameter and extend into the shuttle, Dittemore said. No spare
parts are available, and it would take months to manufacture new
pieces.</TE>

<HD>Southland Executives Named in IRS Suits</HD>
<DH>Court: Agency takes action in what it calls 'abusive' tax
shelters and cites gubernatorial candidate Simon and corporate
leaders.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PETER G. GOSSELIN and KATHY KRISTOF</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITERS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>The Internal Revenue Service has included a cross-section of top
Southern California business executives--from a studio chief to a
telecommunications tycoon--in a pair of legal actions aimed at what
federal officials called "abusive" tax shelters.</LD>
<LD>   Topping the list are Republican gubernatorial candidate Bill Simon
Jr. and his father, the late William E. Simon, a former U.S. Treasury
secretary.</LD>
<LD>   Also mentioned are Gary Winnick, chairman of the troubled Beverly
Hills-based Global Crossing Ltd.; Henry Nicholas III, chief executive
of Irvine-based Broadcom Inc.; Robert E. Shaye, chairman of New Line
Cinema of New York and Los Angeles; Maurice Marciano, chief executive
of clothier Guess, which is headquartered in Los Angeles; and
prominent Los Angeles businessman Leonard Green.</LD>
<TE>   Government officials said Friday that inclusion of the names in
lawsuits seeking to enforce an IRS demand for documents from
accounting giants KPMG and BDO Seidman did not necessarily mean the
executives or their families were using improper shelters to slash
their taxes.</TE>
<TE>   But court papers in the KPMG case in particular show that the
accounting firm gave the IRS more than 636,000 documents but refused
to provide some material involving these Southern Californians and
1,100 other individuals.</TE>
<TE>   IRS officials had harsh words for anyone engaged in tax dodges.</TE>
<TE>   ''The U.S. tax system is based on the principle of responsible
self-assessment by taxpayers and responsible advice by tax
professionals,'' said IRS Commissioner Charles Rossotti. ''It is not
a game of hide-and-seek with the IRS.''</TE>
<TE>   Inclusion of the younger Simon's name in the KPMG case seems
certain to roil the gubernatorial race between the wealthy Republican
and Democratic Gov. Gray Davis. Davis has spent months calling on
Simon to disclose information about his personal finances, and on
Monday began airing television ads charging that his GOP rival
''won't release his tax returns to show he's paying his fair share.''</TE>
<TE>   At a campaign stop Friday in Universal City, Simon responded by
portraying himself as a bystander to the legal action. ''There's a
dispute right now between the IRS and two public accounting firms,
and whatever the results of that dispute are we're certainly happy to
live with,'' he said.</TE>
<TE>   When asked whether he was aware that KPMG was arranging for tax
shelters on his behalf, Simon did not answer. But the GOP candidate
said, ''We rely upon the advice of tax professionals in terms of
preparing tax returns and in terms of the accounting treatment that's
accorded certain transactions.''</TE>
<TE>   Until now, Simon, a Pacific Palisades investment banker, has
ridiculed Davis' call for his tax returns, saying their release would
violate his privacy and that the Democrat's demand for them reminded
him of Karl Marx and Big Brother.</TE>
<TE>   Winnick, Nicholas, Marciano and Green had no comment. "This is a
matter between the IRS and KPMG," said Bill Blanning, spokesman for
Nicholas.</TE>
<TE>   Shaye could not be reached for comment.</TE>
<TE>   The IRS and the Treasury Department have grown increasingly
disturbed in recent years by the aggressive techniques of wealthy
individuals and corporations to avoid federal taxes. Both have issued
stern warnings and, the new court papers show, have launched quiet
investigations into the activities of major accounting firms.</TE>
<TE>   But news of the latest probes, first reported by the Wall Street
Journal, comes just as one corporation after another has acknowledged
it improperly accounted for billions of dollars to puff up profits,
and as one top executive after another has conceded he reaped huge
rewards even as his company was crumbling and its workers were being
laid off.</TE>
<TE>   In Washington, disclosure of lawsuits sparked calls for giving the
IRS new tools to fight tax shelters. Among them: a proposal by
conservative Republicans on the House Ways and Means Committee that
would let the agency levy $100,000 fines against individuals who
failed to report certain tax-shelter transactions.</TE>
<TE>   Elsewhere, both the suits and the inclusion of individuals' names
sparked cries of foul play.</TE>
<TE>   ''It has been asserted that [the IRS suits] are unprecedented,"
fumed Chuck Rettig, partner at the Beverly Hills law firm of Hochman,
Salkin, Rettig, Toscher &amp; Perez. ''What is unprecedented is the
government's aggressive pursuit of publicity through numerous press
releases before there has been any judicial determination.''</TE>
<TE>   Rettig pointed out that none of the individuals named in the IRS
actions was accused of wrongdoing. Instead, he said, many are
undergoing civil IRS audits.</TE>
<TE>   The IRS court actions aim to force their accounting firms, KPMG
and BDO Seidman, to provide the documents.</TE>
<TE>   The accounting firms, relying on a 1998 law that provided tax
advisors with legal privacy similar to that enjoyed by attorneys,
have refused to turn over letters that might discuss not only the
merits of the transactions but also the possible risks. "KPMG
believes it has legitimate disputes with the IRS regarding the
summonses and will take appropriate steps to protect our clients'
rights," the firm said in a statement.</TE>
<TE>   BDO Seidman issued a similar statement. ''Certain documentation is
protected under accountant-client privilege, and any accounting firm
has a professional obligation to honor that privilege,'' the Chicago
firm said.</TE>
<TE>   The IRS' naming of taxpayers who have not been charged struck tax
experts as extraordinary.</TE>
<TE>   "I have never seen them do that ever," Ian Comisky, a Philadelphia
tax lawyer and author of the textbook "Tax Fraud and Evasion," said
Friday. "I suggest that the fact that they did is an indication that
they are desperately unhappy with the current state of play in the
tax shelter arena."</TE>
<TE>   IRS and Justice Department officials asserted that the decision to
include individuals' names in court filings is not unusual in cases
in which firms claim the privilege of withholding information.
Virtually all the names were in a so-called privilege log that KPMG
filed with the government listing what it was refusing to give the
IRS.</TE>
<TE>   ''When privilege is at issue, it's common practice to make the
privilege log part of the record,'' said Justice Department
spokeswoman Dana Perino. None of the names came from people's tax
returns, added IRS spokesman Frank Keith.</TE>
<TE>   But it seems likely that the IRS understood the punch the new
court papers would pack and intended it as a warning to individuals
and companies contemplating the use of aggressive tax shelters.</TE>
<TE>   Papers in the KPMG case, for example, carry a list of catchy names
under which the firm sold its tax-shaving strategies, including
FLIPs, BLIPs, OPIS and CAMPUS.</TE>
<TE>   In one instance, an IRS agent estimated that 57 KPMG clients
managed to generate $1.4 billion in tax-saving losses from an
investment that totaled only $114 million. In another, the IRS
asserts, 186 KPMG clients claimed $4.4 billion in artificial losses
that reduced their tax bills.</TE>
<TE>   Papers in the BDO Seidman suit are, if anything, even more
incendiary.</TE>
<TE>   Among the exhibits is a Sept. 26, 2000, letter that apparently
caused the agency to begin looking into the accounting firm's
practices.</TE>
<TE>   The writer, who does not identify himself, said: ''There were
times when the tax product team and senior management of BDO became
very nervous when the IRS had requested tax-shelter information from
certain Big 5 accounting firms, and emergency meetings were called to
slow down tax product sales.</TE>
<TE>   ''These tax products are worse than Al Capone in the amount of tax
dollars literally not reported and paid.''</TE>
<TE>   The court filing includes 21 pages of e-mails between a top
official at the company's Chicago headquarters and accountants and
sales executives at branch offices around the country. Each is titled
''TAX $ELLS!!!'' and touts sales successes.</TE>
<TE>   ''Congratulations,'' one e-mail reads, listing a half dozen branch
employees who, it says, ''closed a tax solution transaction,
resulting in a PROFIT OF $995,000 TO THE FIRM!!!''
''Congratulations'' to a Detroit office employee, another reads, who
closed a tax shelter deal ''resulting in a PROFIT OF $3 MILLION TO
THE FIRM!!!''</TE>
<TE>   Most of the information the IRS is demanding from the two
accounting companies involves tax shelters that are designed to shift
individuals' and firms' income offshore and beyond the legal reach of
Washington to tax.</TE>
<TE>   IRS rules permit some forms of shifting but require accountants,
in effect, to register the kinds of tax shelters they are providing
clients. The agency publishes a compendium of ''listed transactions''
that it prohibits.</TE>

<DL>SEATTLE</DL>
<LD>A regional terrorism task force is investigating a possible terrorist
cell here composed of suspected Muslim radicals with links to an Al
Qaeda recruiter in London as well as the former Taliban leadership in
Afghanistan and a "jihad training camp" in rural Oregon, according to
interviews and an investigative document obtained by The Times.</LD>
<LD>   One in the suspected terrorist group is described as a U.S.-born
Muslim convert who provided computers to the Taliban before Sept. 11.
The American also helped recruit a British citizen, now in U.S.
military custody, for an Al Qaeda terrorist training camp, the
investigative report said.</LD>
<LD>   The confidential document, widely distributed to federal
investigative and intelligence agencies, apparently was intended to
alert authorities that suspected cell members may be trying to
"identify targets for a terrorist attack."</LD>
<TE>   Among items seized after a related arrest were "instructions on
poisoning water sources," the report disclosed.</TE>
<TE>   In June, according to the document, U.S. authorities were alerted
to suspicions that the American Muslim and his brother, also a Muslim
convert, could be traveling together and seeking to "locate possible
sites for a terrorist operation." The current whereabouts of the
brothers could not be determined, and investigators would not discuss
whether they are under surveillance.</TE>
<TE>   The investigative document also details a suspected terrorist
training camp held nearly three years ago at an isolated ranch in
Oregon.</TE>
<TE>   "In November, 1999, local American Muslim converts with
coordination of foreign radical Islamic extremists planned and
conducted a jihad training camp in Bly, Oregon," the federal alert
said. "This camp was conducted in concert with Sheik Abu Hamza
Al-Masri (of London)."</TE>
<TE>   Abu Hamza, a Muslim radical who has publicly supported the suicide
attacks on the U.S., is regarded as a leading Al Qaeda recruiter in
Europe.</TE>
<TE>   Word of the investigation became known as Atty. Gen. John Ashcroft
told Congress this week that various Al Qaeda sleeper cells remain
intact in the U.S., despite the extensive law enforcement sweeps
since the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11.</TE>
<TE>   Federal authorities had previously warned that the Pacific
Northwest--with its broad open spaces, strategic ports and military
bases, along with a growing Muslim population and a largely open
border with Canada--could be an "easy target."</TE>
<TE>   In a statement last month, Seattle FBI chief Charles Mandigo said
the region receives "a disproportionate high number of terrorism
threats."</TE>
<TE>   Government prosecutors and FBI officials declined to comment on
the terrorist cell inquiry, but a senior federal law enforcement
official confirmed that a grand jury is investigating the matter.</TE>
<TE>   The inquiry was first disclosed Friday by the Seattle Times. The
paper reported that investigators had gathered information on more
than 100 people associated with a now-defunct mosque in downtown
Seattle that is central to the probe.</TE>
<TE>   The investigation has led to only one arrest.</TE>
<TE>   Semi Osman, 32, believed to be a Lebanese national, is a former
imam, or prayer leader, at the mosque. He has been charged with
immigration fraud and illegal possession of a semiautomatic
40-caliber handgun with its serial numbers removed. While no
terrorism charges have been brought, he was arrested in May by the
Puget Sound Joint Terrorist Task Force.</TE>
<TE>   At that time, items seized from Osman's residence included
additional firearms, military field manuals, papers by Abu Hamza,
instructions on poisoning water supplies, a visa application to Yemen
and "various other items associated with Islamic radicalism," the
document said.</TE>
<TE>   Osman is an active-duty reservist in the U.S. Navy and a former
Army enlistee. Navy investigators are assisting in the investigation.</TE>
<TE>   Osman's attorney, Robert M. Leen, said his client has no links to
terrorism and is, instead, a victim of discrimination. Leen
acknowledged that the government has sought Osman's cooperation in
gathering information about mosques in the Seattle area.</TE>
<TE>   FBI agents working on the case descended last month on secluded
Bly, 30 miles north of the California border in south-central Oregon.</TE>
<TE>   A ranch in Bly where Osman lived for a time is suspected of having
been the site of the jihad training event in November 1999, documents
show. It is unclear whether the training camp ever operated or
whether the site was being scouted for a future camp.</TE>
<TE>   The FBI team asked pointed questions about Osman and any
suspicious activity observed on the ranch where he lived with a
former wife, described by neighbors as a U.S.-born convert to Islam.</TE>
<TE>   "The feds said he [Osman] was an imam, and he was involved in a
radical group in Seattle," said Steve Leonardo, who owns an antique
shop on Bly's main road and was interviewed by the officers.</TE>
<TE>   Agents also canvassed the 160-acre property where Osman lived,
photographing vehicles, trailer homes and other buildings, according
to residents.</TE>
<TE>   "They said they were investigating complaints about a lot of
shooting that had been going on up there," said Robert Tucker, an
upholstery designer from the San Francisco Bay area who is building a
house on an adjoining property and was quizzed by the FBI.</TE>
<TE>   However, locals recalled nothing suspicious at the site.</TE>
<TE>   "If there was anything unusual going on, if this was some kind of
training camp or anything, everyone would have known it," said Kelly
Peterson, who works at a ranch. Residents said Osman, his wife and
another Muslim woman living on the property during late 1999 kept to
themselves and seemed content raising goats, long-haired sheep and
other animals.</TE>
<TE>   One source knowledgeable about the case said the Bly episode
prompted suspicion in part because a top aide of Abu Hamza, the
militant London cleric, is suspected of having met with Osman in Bly
during the supposed training period.</TE>
<TE>   Local police became aware of the identity of the man during a stop
of Osman's car in December 1999, the source said, but his presence
seemed to take on a new importance in recent months.</TE>
<TE>   Police officials said they were unaware of the details or declined
comment. "It's a national security matter," said Lt. Rod Dailey of
the Klamath County Sheriff's Office, which polices the Bly area.</TE>
<TE>   A key objective of the FBI investigation, documents state, is
"identifying all individuals associated with the planning and conduct
of the jihad training camp."</TE>
<TE>   Osman "helped coordinate" the camp, the document stated, and his
arrest by anti-terrorism investigators May 17 has resulted in a "mild
panic" among former participants.</TE>
<TE>   Osman was applying for U.S. citizenship when he was arrested and
had enrolled in November in an 18-month program at a DeVry University
campus, studying electronics and computer technology.</TE>
<TE>   "The government has expressed interest in several of the mosques
that Mr. Osman attended in the Seattle area," said Leen, who declined
to comment further. He said he knew nothing of a grand jury inquiry
and noted that his client has not been charged with terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   Osman, described by former co-workers as an indifferent car
mechanic who was more interested in praying than fixing cars, was a
leader at a storefront mosque near downtown Seattle.</TE>
<TE>   It could not be determined whether the American Muslim convert who
provided computers to the Taliban was among the men affiliated with
the now-defunct Seattle mosque where Osman was a prayer leader.</TE>
<TE>   The document said he "has worked for and provided services to Abu
Hamza ... to include taking computers to the Taliban prior to U.S.
action in Afghanistan." It noted he introduced a British citizen,
Feroz Abbasi, to Al Qaeda officials to help him gain access to a
Afghan terrorist training camp.</TE>
<TE>   The man has since been arrested by the U.S. military in the
Afghanistan war zone and transferred to the detention facility in
Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.</TE>
<TE>   Several Somali immigrants who occasionally worshiped at the mosque
said they became disenchanted by the young worshipers' somewhat
aggressive style.</TE>
<TE>   "Islam is about peace, about welcoming people," said one of the
Somali men.</TE>

<HD>Slain Boy's Caseworker Accused of False Filing</HD>

<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>TAMPA, Fla.</DL>
<LD>In another setback for Florida's child-welfare agency, a department
investigator was charged Friday with falsifying records in the case
of a 2-year-old boy who was beaten to death allegedly by his
baby-sitter for soiling his pants.</LD>
<LD>   Erica Jones, whose job was to investigate child-abuse allegations
for the state Department of Children &amp; Families, allegedly reported
in her files that she visited 2-year-old Alfredo Montez on July
1--the day police say the child was slain. The toddler was found dead
on the side of a road Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Jones faces a felony charge and was expected to turn herself in.</LD>
<TE>   The department is already under fire over the disclosure that it
had lost track of 5-year-old Rilya Wilson of Miami while she was
under state protection. Her disappearance went unnoticed for at least
15 months. She is still missing.</TE>
<TE>   Florida Gov. Jeb Bush said that Alfredo was not under state care,
but the department employee was to check out a neglect complaint.</TE>
<TE>   "The supervisor will be fired and the caseworker will be
prosecuted for her actions," Bush said. "It's heartbreaking. It's
incredible."</TE>
<TE>   Under a new state law prompted by Rilya's case, falsifying
documents related to child welfare cases is punishable by up to five
years in prison.</TE>
<TE>   "The law that we passed will now kick in, and there will be a
prosecution," Bush said.</TE>
<TE>   Alfredo's body, wrapped in a children's bedspread, was seen by a
motorist along Interstate 275 in central Florida.</TE>
<TE>   Richard Chouquer, 23, was arrested and accused of beating Montez
to death. He was charged with murder and aggravated child abuse. His
live-in girlfriend, Amandy Lawrence, 22, was charged as an accessory
after the fact. Both were in custody in Hurricane, Utah, where they
were arrested Wednesday at a relative's house.</TE>
<TE>   Polk County police Capt. W.J. Martin said Chouquer hit the boy at
least five times in the face after the boy soiled his pants. Chouquer
and his girlfriend allegedly put the body in their car and dumped it.</TE>
<TE>   Alfredo's mother had left the boy and his sister in the couple's
care at their home June 28 while she looked for work, Martin said.</TE>
<TE>   The mother, Jeanna Swallows, was jailed earlier this week for
allegedly violating probation by writing bad checks.</TE>

<HD>Shuttered Las Vegas Trauma Center Gets 45-Day Reprieve</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>LAS VEGAS</DL>
<LD>Nevada's only top-level trauma center will reopen today, 10 days
after it shut down because of soaring malpractice insurance rates for
doctors, officials said.</LD>
<LD>   "This is a good day," Anthony Serfustini, an orthopedic surgeon,
said Friday inside an empty trauma center at University Medical
Center.</LD>
<LD>   About 15 orthopedic surgeons in private practice have agreed to
become Clark County employees for 45 days, meaning they will be
covered by the hospital's $50,000 liability cap.</LD>
<TE>   The trauma center closed July 3 after all but one of the medical
center's 58 orthopedic doctors resigned, saying they couldn't afford
rising malpractice insurance premiums.</TE>
<TE>   A trauma center can't operate without orthopedic surgeons because
the majority of trauma patients have broken bones.</TE>
<TE>   Gov. Kenny Guinn said Friday that the 45-day period will give him
time to call the state Legislature into special session to consider a
law to cap jury awards in medical malpractice lawsuits.</TE>

<HD>High-Tech Strategy Guides Pentagon Plan</HD>
<DH>Military: The Cold War era is left behind in the secret
document, which stresses a long-range approach to a new breed of
enemies.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>JOHN HENDREN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>A secret Pentagon plan for the next five years directs the military
to focus more of its spending to combat Afghanistan-style threats and
weapons of mass destruction and to develop even greater
precision-strike capabilities, according to a document reviewed by
The Times.</LD>
<LD>   The "Defense Planning Guidance" for 2004 to 2009 puts into action
the Pentagon's plan to replace a Cold War-era strategy of being able
to fight two major-theater wars at the same time with a more complex
approach aimed at dominating air and space on several fronts.</LD>
<LD>   The annually updated five-year plan, the first since the Sept. 11
terrorist attacks, represents an acceleration of the shift toward the
high-tech gadgetry of warfare on which the Pentagon has relied since
the Persian Gulf War of 1991.</LD>
<TE>   The classified document requires the military services to further
develop the capability to launch "unwarned" preemptive strikes, a new
doctrine President Bush outlined in a May graduation address at the
U.S. Military Academy at West Point, N.Y.</TE>
<TE>   The document appears to emphasize the kind of nontraditional enemy
American soldiers have faced in Afghanistan, rather than a
peer-to-peer war with large numbers of conventional troops and
weapons against such possible foes as North Korea and China.</TE>
<TE>   The plan directs the armed services to spend their money on five
areas: countering terrorists and weapons of mass destruction,
intelligence, cyber-warfare, airstrike capabilities and military
systems in space.</TE>
<TE>   It also sets specific goals, such as the development of a squadron
of a dozen unmanned fighter jets by 2012 and a "hypersonic missile"
that can travel 600 nautical miles in 15 minutes--capable of taking
out mobile missile launchers before they can be moved--by 2009.</TE>
<TE>   The more than 50-page document is detailed in The Times' Sunday
editions by defense analyst and columnist William M. Arkin.</TE>
<TE>   Defense officials said the plan codifies the military
transformation that Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld has touted
since he took over the Pentagon.</TE>
<TE>   It places emphasis on capabilities such as surprise "high-volume
precision strikes," and calls for laser- and microwave-powered
weapons and nuclear-tipped "bunker buster" bombs capable of striking
deeply buried cave complexes such as those in the mountains of
Afghanistan.</TE>
<TE>   The weapons called for in the plan enhance the military's ability
to launch stealthy preemptive strikes against a new breed of enemy,
which the Bush administration has suggested could include North Korea
and Iraq.</TE>
<TE>   In his June 2 address announcing his "strike first" policy, Bush
said U.S. forces need to be "ready to strike at a moment's notice in
any dark corner of the world."</TE>
<TE>   "We face a threat with no precedent," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "Containment is not possible when unbalanced dictators with
weapons of mass destruction can deliver those weapons on missiles or
secretly provide them to terrorist allies."</TE>
<TE>   The emphasis on high-tech warfare appears to benefit the Air Force
most and the Army least, a senior defense official said on condition
of anonymity.</TE>
<TE>   That may have an effect on the way the document is received by
each of the military services. The document calls for the services to
make cyber-warfare a "core competency."</TE>
<TE>   That includes protecting critical U.S. computer networks and
destroying or sleuthing the enemy's networks.</TE>
<TE>   The policy blueprint outlines a shift from a "threat-based"
strategy, aimed at combating major adversaries such as China or
Russia, to a "capabilities-based" system, designed to develop the
ability to "deter, deny and defeat adversaries who will rely on
surprise, deception and asymmetric warfare to achieve their
objectives."</TE>
<TE>   Some defense analysts expressed a concern that the plan would send
the message that wars can be fought with few casualties by
"push-button warfare."</TE>
<TE>   "It's this concept that we can sit in our air-conditioned bunkers
and push buttons," said Ivo Daalder, a defense analyst at the
Brookings Institution.</TE>
<TE>   "That leads to the absurd decision to fight a Kosovo war without a
ground component. It leads to relying on insurgents and precision
strikes to overthrow Saddam. It's absurd to think that that's the way
we ought to fight warfare in each and every circumstance....</TE>
<TE>   "Wars are still fought and won in the old-fashioned way: by
killing more of the others than they kill of you. And by taking
territories."</TE>
<TE>   Nevertheless, some of the technologies envisioned in the plan
could be used in traditional large-scale wars, said Anthony
Cordesman, a former Pentagon official at the Center for Strategic and
International Studies, a Washington foreign policy think-tank.</TE>
<TE>   The paper indirectly criticizes U.S. intelligence performance,
calling for major changes.</TE>
<TE>   "It is also essential over the midterm period that we transform
intelligence capabilities to provide sufficient warning of an
impending crisis, identify critical targets" and develop new ways to
monitor military campaigns and measure their success, the report
says.</TE>
<TE>   The edict follows criticism that the intelligence community had
too little information on Al Qaeda operatives before Sept. 11, and
often failed to communicate what it had with other government
agencies.</TE>

<HD>Some Successes Seen in Report on U.S. Children</HD>
<DH>Health: Findings include drop in infant mortality.
Officials note numerous measures did not change.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LAURA MECKLER</AU>
<BD>ASSOCIATED PRESS</BD>
<DL>WASHINGTON</DL>
<LD>Fewer babies are dying. Fewer teenage girls are having babies.
Smoking is dropping among eighth- and 10th-graders.</LD>
<LD>   There's encouraging news in a report, released Friday, that brings
together recent figures on the health, economics and education of
about 70 million children in the United States. The report was
compiled by the Federal Interagency Forum on Child and Family
Statistics.</LD>
<LD>   Officials celebrated the successes but noted that there was no
improvement on many measures of well-being.</LD>
<TE>   The best news might be a substantial drop in infant mortality. In
1999, the report said, 7 of every 1,000 babies under age 1 died. That
was down from 7.2 in 1998, continuing a decline throughout the 1990s.</TE>
<TE>   The rate fell again in 2000, said a separate report also released
Friday, to 6.9 deaths per 1,000 babies.</TE>
<TE>   "It's a triumph of science and health performance," said Dr. Duane
Alexander, director of the National Institute of Child Health and
Human Development.</TE>
<TE>   Alexander attributed the reduction to clinical improvements in
treatment of respiratory distress syndrome and a reduction in sudden
infant death syndrome, achieved largely through a campaign to put
babies to sleep on their backs.</TE>
<TE>   Other positive trends include:</TE>
<TE>   * Births among girls ages 15 to 17 dropped from 29 per 1,000 in
1999 to 27 per 1,000 in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   * More children were covered by health insurance, up from 87% in
1999 to 88% in 2000. Officials credited the relatively new State
Children's Health Insurance Program, which covers children in
working-poor families.</TE>
<TE>   * Fewer eighth- and 10th-graders smoked, though smoking rates for
high school seniors were statistically unchanged. Last year, 5.5% of
eighth-graders smoked, down from 7.4% in 2000; among 10th-graders,
12% smoked, down from 14%.</TE>
<TE>   * More children were read to every day by a family member, 58%
last year, up from 54% in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   * More youngsters ages 2 to 5 had a good diet--27% in 1998, up
from 21% in 1996.</TE>
<TE>   Numerous measures did not change: In 2000, 16% of children lived
in poverty, 76% of toddlers got the recommended immunizations and 87%
of young adults finished high school. Drug and alcohol use among
junior high and high school students held steady.</TE>
<TE>   In a special feature this year, the report found that in 2001, 19%
of children had at least one parent born outside the United States,
up from 14% in 1994.</TE>

<HD>Paid Family Leave Plan: Benefit or Just a Burden?</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A bill awaiting final action in the state Assembly would make
California the first state to provide workers with up to 12 weeks of
paid time off to take care of a seriously ill child, spouse, parent
or domestic partner or to be with a newborn. Slated to be part of the
state disability insurance (SDI) fund, weekly benefits ranging from
$50 to $490 would begin in 2004. Unpaid family leave is currently
available here and in many other states. KAREN KARLITZ spoke with an
opponent and a proponent of the measure, SB 1661.</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<LD>   ALLAN ZAREMBERG</LD>
<TE>   President, California Chamber</TE>
<TE>   of Commerce:</TE>
<TE>   The workers' compensation program, paid for by employers, is the
safety net for workers injured on the job. State disability
insurance, funded through employee paycheck deductions, compensates
for time off because of injury or illness unrelated to work.
Deviating from disability insurance's original purpose, SB 1661 gives
employees paid time off for family leave. Half of the program's cost
would come from a tax on employers. It doesn't make sense for
employers to be responsible for situations that have nothing to do
with work.</TE>
<TE>   The cost of funding SB 1661 is pure speculation. We don't know how
many people would take advantage of it, and there's no cap on the
number of people eligible. It's estimated by Chamber of Commerce
staff that every employee would have to pay $102 more in taxes per
year. Matching funds would be paid by employers, creating potential
new costs for firms considering expansion or relocating here. For
smaller employers the problem would be even worse. The existing
family leave law exempts companies with 50 or fewer employees because
they have less flexibility in moving employees around.</TE>
<TE>   It is irresponsible for the state to create programs that require
new taxes when the Legislature is already considering new taxes to
fund a $20-billion deficit.</TE>
<TE>   Some of the bill's proponents say it would make for a happier work
force, but many employers could not afford to do it. If the public
finds this program to be worthy of everyone's support--and it would
have to compete with other programs to exist--it makes sense to
spread its cost through a government subsidy, a tax credit.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   MARJORIE SIMS</TE>
<TE>   Executive Director, California</TE>
<TE>   Women's Law Center</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles:</TE>
<TE>   SB 1661 is a very reasonable approach to provide employees with
some job/wage protection while caring for a family member. I am
certain a large number of workers would benefit by this bill's
passage and expect that many people would take advantage of it. My
understanding is that it would cost an average of $37 per employee
per year, and this cost would be shared with the employer. This
estimate was provided by the Employment Development Department.
California's state disability insurance program has the resources to
support these benefits because of the additional contributions that
would be made. SB 1661 would not put the state disability fund at
risk.</TE>
<TE>   I understand the concerns of business owners that their costs
would rise. What has not been considered is that paid family leave
would help to retain workers. The great majority of employees would
return to their employers after taking care of their family needs. Of
course, companies would have the problem of recruiting temporary
and/or part-time workers. But in the long run, it is the
responsibility of all businesses to provide innovative ways to retain
workers and to be good corporate citizens.</TE>
<TE>   This state has always led the way in innovative business practices
and policies.</TE>

<AU>RAY RICHMOND</AU>
<BD>Ray Richmond is a freelance journalist in West
Hollywood. E-mail: tvrayz@aol.com.</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>It was precisely a year ago that my wife, Heidi, and I thought that
our son Dylan's school life was over before it had begun. We had
enrolled Dylan for a summer of pre-kindergarten in a local private
school that shall remain nameless. After all of eight days, his
teachers called Heidi aside to soberly inform her they were concerned
that Dylan wasn't forming his letters properly.</LD>
<LD>   This information was passed along in the hushed-tone "we thought
this was something you should know" fashion reserved for kids with
painfully misfiring genes.</LD>
<LD>   My wife was sobbing, flushed with the fear that our son just
couldn't cut it like the other kids. But hold on. The kid had just
turned 5 and was two months shy of officially entering kindergarten.
Was he really expected to draw letters perfectly?</LD>
<TE>   We wondered whether we'd missed something, or if this penchant for
filling parents with insecurity and apprehension was as misplaced and
absurd as it appeared.</TE>
<TE>   Rather than wait to find out, we pulled Dylan out of the
mega-snooty Flawless Penmanship Academy and decided--after much
soul-searching--to wait until fall and enroll him in Rosewood Avenue
School in West Hollywood, part of the Los Angeles Unified School
District.</TE>
<TE>   Being confirmed private school snobs, this was no casual decision.
My wife and I were both products of L.A. Unified--and that in itself
scared us to death. We didn't want to raise a regular kid but the
Six-Million-Dollar Child: smarter, wiser, brighter, bolder.</TE>
<TE>   To our narrow minds, public school had always been for the parents
who didn't care about their child's education quite as much. If you
can afford the best, the thinking went, then you should accept
nothing less. We were afraid we somehow were settling.</TE>
<TE>   The truth, however, has turned out to be something far different.
Rosewood School has been a dream for our son, defined by a group of
dedicated parents and with a dynamic leader in Principal Janet
Chapman.</TE>
<TE>   Rosewood lacked the largely white and upper-middle-class
congregation that filled our private school experience; it has proved
to be a spicy melting pot of cultures and races that has helped to
greatly expand our son's social horizons (not to mention our own).
Rosewood is far from being one of the so-called elite schools in the
L.A. Unified School District. Of 369 Rosewood pupils tested in 2001
for the state's Academic Performance Index, 253 were deemed
socioeconomically disadvantaged. By comparison, Warner Elementary in
Westwood had 371 kids tested and a mere 26 were labeled
disadvantaged. So Rosewood is hardly chi-chi, even within the LAUSD.
Its racial composition is 46% Latino, 13% African American, 8%
Asian-Pacific and 29% Caucasian.</TE>
<TE>   Our son adjusted to his multicultural surroundings with increasing
skills and confidence as the school year progressed. Dylan even
picked up that whole alphabet-penmanship thing just fine, without
ever knowing he'd been dismissed as "attention-deficient" or
"learning-challenged."</TE>
<TE>   This is not to imply that Dylan wouldn't have ultimately thrived
in a private school setting. Yet we've also discovered that just
paying $600 or $700 (or more) a month for something doesn't
automatically make it better. In education, as in few other areas of
life, you don't always get what you pay for. But every once in a
while, if you leave your mind open, you wind up receiving far more.</TE>

<LD>There ought to be a law against rotten schools.</LD>
<LD>   Wait! There is a law against rotten schools, if they receive
federal money to educate poor children. It's part of the education
bill that President Bush signed in January. Starting in September,
students across the United States no longer have to stay in schools
that keep failing. They can demand a transfer to a better public
school. And their district has to pay for the ride.</LD>
<LD>   So expect an exodus from the 8,652 public schools nationwide that
flunked Washington's test--except the 122 in the Los Angeles Unified
School District. The district is such an overcrowded mess that many
of the shortchanged students won't have anywhere to go.</LD>
<TE>   The federal law requires a school to meet state standards, and
students must show improvement on standardized tests for two years
including in each of several designated demographic groups
(limited-English students, minority students, low-income students or
special education students).</TE>
<TE>   Only Michigan, among the 50 states, fared worse than California,
which had 1,009 campuses on the rotten-schools list.</TE>
<TE>   LAUSD officials say they expect many of their schools to fall off
the federal list when new test scores are released in August. The
district has already kicked out a few ineffective principals and, on
some campuses, gotten rid of bad teachers.</TE>
<TE>   Teachers who stay at problem schools identified in a separate
state audit--for example, at Mount Vernon Middle School in the
Crenshaw district--must agree in writing to meet certain criteria
themselves. For example, they must dress professionally, be punctual,
maintain high expectations for students and attend 20 days of
mandatory training sessions, for which they will be paid.</TE>
<TE>   Washington, quite logically, doesn't want to spend more money
"with lousy results," Bush said when he signed the bipartisan bill
renewing the largest federal education program. He referred to the
$120 billion invested over 35 years in the Title I program, which was
supposed to close the chronic gap in reading and math between rich
and poor kids.</TE>
<TE>   The goal remains the same, but the federal "No Child Left Behind"
law shrewdly attaches plenty of strings. Even as kids exercise their
right to flee, a school district must help failing schools' students
improve by paying for tutoring, remedial education and other
services.</TE>
<TE>   Schools that refuse to comply with Washington's prescription will
lose federal money. Eventually, though, students in public education
will find schools' accountability a win.</TE>

<LD>Enduring three hours of the SAT is a coming-of-age tradition about as
pleasant as being stuck in a car without air conditioning on a
cross-country family trip. It's about to get worse.</LD>
<LD>   Besides having to pencil in the bubbles, members of the high
school class of 2006 will have the added torment of cranking out a
short essay. Under University of California pressure, the College
Board, which administers the SAT, has decided to evaluate students'
writing skills. It underestimates the huge task ahead.</LD>
<LD>   Look at it as an SAT math question: In the 2000-01 school year,
the College Board administered 2.5 million SAT I tests. Assume that
the same number of students will take the new test when it debuts. At
least two graders will read each essay. If each grader reads, say,
100 of the 500-word essays, how many schoolteachers with surplus time
and college professors willing to work for (presumably) next to
nothing will it take to plod through all the essays? (Answer:
50,000.)</LD>
<TE>   Many states already require every graduating high school student
to take a writing exam. But most of these state tests, including
California's, are graded on a pass/fail basis. The College Board's
army of graders, which will get only one day of training, will rate
each essay from 1 to 6 based on a scoring guide. If the grades of two
readers differ by two or more points, the essay goes to a third
reader.</TE>
<TE>   The existing SAT II writing exam, one of the tests measuring
knowledge in specific subjects, will be a model for the SAT I essay.
The College Board insists that the SAT II writing test offers
objective assessment--just 2% of essays go to a third grader. But few
colleges require the SAT II writing test, and only 315,000 students
took it in 2000-01. Evaluating 2.5 million essays written under the
new SAT I requirements is a different matter.</TE>
<TE>   For all its perceived faults, including alleged racial and gender
bias, the SAT I offers college admissions officers a precise score
based on multiple-choice questions with definitive answers. Adding
graders will introduce interpretive quirks. The essays will reveal
clues about their authors, and, consciously or not, graders will
reward or punish accordingly. Maybe it will be only a one-point
difference. But on a six-point scale, that's massive. The writing
test will count for one-third of the SAT score.</TE>
<TE>   Even if the rubric could root out subjectivity, it could also
prove counterproductive. Like it or not, students will try to write
to it. The template will value variety of sentence structure and
range of vocabulary, for example. This could lead to vivid and clear
writing--or verbose, pretentious writing with too many commas and
adverbs.</TE>
<TE>   In conclusion (a superfluous phrase that begins the last paragraph
of many poorly written essays), the SAT essay might assuage testers'
guilt and appease critics but do nothing to help beleaguered
admissions officers or deserving students. The College Board must
address these concerns before rolling out a national writing test.</TE>

<LD>The suicide bombings we hear most about these days are in the Middle
East, but the nation in which such atrocities have occurred most
often in the last two decades is Sri Lanka. Over that time, a Tamil
terrorist group in the island nation off the southern tip of India
has sent out more than 200 teenagers with explosives-filled suitcases
or belts, slaughtering perceived enemies and innocents alike. The
victims include a president of the nation, Cabinet ministers and a
former prime minister of India.</LD>
<LD>   Since March, the killings have mostly stopped, thanks to a
Norwegian-brokered cease-fire. Peace talks may begin in a few weeks,
offering hope to a country exhausted by more than 64,000 deaths since
the separatist violence first surged in the nation of 20 million. The
cease-fire is the most promising sign in years. However, past
agreements to stop the violence collapsed, and this opening will need
careful tending.</LD>
<TE>   Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe won election last December on
a platform promising to negotiate with the guerrillas commonly known
as the Tamil Tigers. The group has sought autonomy or independence
for areas in the north and east of Sri Lanka that are home to most of
the country's Tamils, who make up nearly 20% of the population.
Nationalist elements of the Sinhalese, the majority ethnic group,
oppose talks with the Tigers. But the stalemate that has developed
between the warring forces demonstrates that negotiations are needed
to forestall many more years of bloodshed.</TE>
<TE>   Sri Lanka's president, Chandrika Kumaratunga, was unsuccessful in
trying to make peace with the Tigers eight years ago but has carped
at Wickremesinghe's attempts. Her objections have the aura of
political posturing aimed at gaining advantage over the prime
minister, who is from a different party. Kumaratunga should support
Wickremesinghe in the peace process. There would be ample credit due
both politicians if the violence ended.</TE>
<TE>   The founder of the Tigers, Velupillai Prabhakaran, insists that he
is committed to the peace process, but he has reneged on agreements
in the past. His group has been designated a terrorist organization
by several nations, including the United States. Washington should
keep reminding Prabhakaran that if he resumes his murderous ways he
could become a target of the war on terror. Prabhakaran's best course
is to continue working with the Sri Lankan government for concrete
steps such as opening roads and ending the use of schools as bases
for soldiers or guerrillas.</TE>
<TE>   To help peace talks succeed, the government should rescind its
order making the Tigers an illegal organization. Then, as talks
begin, it will be important to reach agreement on what kind of
interim government will be put in place in Tamil areas.</TE>

<LD>It's hard to figure out how people who move into the Old Bank
District and then quickly flee can be considered urban pioneers
("Some Urban Pioneers Sour on 4th St. Project," July 7). These people
so often enter with dreams of sanitized, trendy loft living without
first taking time to educate themselves about the neighborhood and
the unique nature of the development. Weak at heart and eager to
break their leases, they conjure up visions of dire disasters and
wail about the lack of daytime security guards.</LD>
<LD>   I was one of the first tenants to move into the San Fernando
Building nearly two years ago. I understand project developer Tom
Gilmore's vision and I continue to appreciate being part of it.
Instead of shying away from it, I have made a conscious effort to
integrate into my neighborhood.</LD>
<LD>   I realize that the district is a work in progress. If something
goes wrong, then I work together with my neighbors and project
management to make things better. The urban pioneer in me makes being
part of an emerging community in L.A.'s historic core an exciting,
energizing ride.</LD>

<DL></DL>
<LD>Re "Crowded Field Runs for Top Job at LAPD," July 7: The initial
stages of the race to become the new chief of the LAPD have already
distinguished the professional politicians from the real leaders
among the candidates. For the last five years, Angelenos lived under
the ever-arrogant Chief Bernard Parks, who was the consummate
politician but short on leadership skills. Thus the mess that we are
currently in, with rising crime and a demoralized, low number of
officers.</LD>
<LD>   Candidates Mark Kroeker (Portland, Ore., police chief), Oxnard
Police Chief Art Lopez and LAPD Cmdr. George Gascon have already
shown themselves to be astute politicians, but Mayor James Hahn would
do all of us well to give the ultimate prize to a real leader and not
a self-promoting politician who is only adept at running a slick
campaign and glad-handing and schmoozing other politicians. Can
Angelenos afford to make the same mistake twice for the next five
years?</LD>
<LD>   All of our lives may depend on it. Let's make the right choice
this time.</LD>

<HD>New Homestead Act Would Revitalize Rural America</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Your July 8 editorial "The Ever Quieter Country" struck the right
tone concerning the reality of life in rural America.</LD>
<LD>   "Reaching for Rural Renewal" (July 2) documented that some in the
heartland perceive the idea of keeping yesterday alive as "stupid,"
and many believe the spirit of the past may not be rekindled in some
small-town areas. However, these attitudes from the heartland are not
universally shared. And, as your editorial points out, this emphasis
misses the greater point of the new Homestead Act.</LD>
<LD>   Of course life in the countryside would not be exactly like it
used to be, but that doesn't mean there shouldn't be an effort to at
least make living in these areas feasible. Tax breaks for business
investments and student-loan forgiveness are two practical ideas that
could make living in the country possible for some who would prefer
an alternative to urban living. Despite the difficulty of getting
this legislation passed, it would certainly benefit all of us to keep
the diverse opportunities of rural America alive.</LD>

<TE>   Imagine my surprise when I opened my copy of The Times on July 2
and saw pictures of my hometown, Clarkson, Neb., and nearby Leigh,
Neb., in a story about dying Midwestern farm towns. Clarkson (and the
surrounding area) supports a beauty shop, feed store and elevator,
service station, decorator shop, florist, veterinary clinic,
newspaper, doctor, insurance agency, bars, churches, cafe, grocery
and general store (family-owned and operated for three generations),
an implement company, bank, hardware store, nursing home and the
Bluebird Nursery, which employs more than 100 people during its busy
season and ships items all over the U.S.</TE>
<TE>   Cheers to Sens. Charles Hagel (R-Neb.) and Byron Dorgan (D-N.D.),
who refuse to write off rural America as a relic. These
communities--and the people who live and work there--are no different
from suburbanites. My nephew and his family live in the country, with
a Clarkson address, and he commutes 35 miles to David City, another
small town, to his job in a tractor/trailer-building plant. Many of
us think nothing of a 35-mile commute.</TE>
<TE>   The residents of farming communities may not be able to purchase
all of their needs locally, but most of us right here don't shop only
within five miles of our homes either. Packed outlet malls attest to
this fact. I support the new Homestead Act.</TE>

<HD>The Push for Parity in Mental Health Coverage</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>"Mental Health Insurance Parity Is an Empty Notion" (Commentary, July
8), by David Cohen and Keith Hoeller, is misleading and dangerous.
Diagnoses in psychiatric medicine are made in the same manner as
other medical illnesses. A history is obtained, symptoms are
reviewed, a physical exam is done (in in-patient settings,
primarily), laboratory data are collected and a diagnosis is made. It
is true that psychiatry has very few laboratory tests, but other
branches of medicine are in a similar situation.</LD>
<LD>   For example, many neurological diagnoses are made by history
alone, and almost any experienced physician in any field of medicine
will tell you that the history is the most important part of the
diagnostic interview.</LD>
<LD>   The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of the American Psychiatric
Assn. dates from 1952. It has become more well known precisely
because it has become more useful and scientific.</LD>
<TE>   As far as involuntary treatment goes, this is a public health and
legal issue more than anything else. The legislature in every state
defines the scope of practice of mental health professionals and
creates mental health law. I've never met a mental health
professional who wanted to place a person on an involuntary hold;
rather, it is with regret and a sense of duty, and in California
there are legislatively defined rules about dangerousness to self or
others or being gravely disabled.</TE>
<TE>   Marc D. Graff MD</TE>
<TE>   Chair, Public Affairs</TE>
<TE>   California Psychiatric Assn.</TE>
<TE>   Reseda</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Cohen and Hoeller propose that American medicine abandon mental
illness. Their main argument is that it has been neglected in the
past. However, mental illnesses are difficult to separate from other
illness: They are disorders of an organ (the brain) that are common,
disabling, often lethal, mostly easy to diagnose and increasingly
responsive to treatment. Their indirect costs to the nation, in the
billions of dollars, have been well documented.</TE>
<TE>   The public, the families of affected individuals and organized
medicine will continue to reject the proposition that mental illness
should be selected for denial of appropriate care.</TE>
<TE>   Rodrigo Munoz MD</TE>
<TE>   President, San Diego County</TE>
<TE>   Medical Society</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Put yourself in this picture: You're a business owner. Profits
influence your bonus, even employment. Tomorrow you will be required
to underwrite mental health parity, newspeak code for raising health
insurance premiums to pay for real and alleged mental illness. Which
psychiatrist will cull the malingerers and opportunists from your
staff? Which medical board will police psychiatrists dipping into
this well?</TE>
<TE>   Your logical response, even your duty to family or stockholders,
is to a) cut back your company's traditional coverage of physical
illnesses so the mandated "parity" doesn't bump insurance costs too
much or b) eliminate health insurance altogether. No law yet mandates
coverage for your business. If you take either step, some staff will
quit; some candidates will take other offers. That's an acceptable
sacrifice in today's market; resumes will come in from a new ad.</TE>
<TE>   Mental health parity gives businesses a long-sought excuse to
slash needed medical coverage for maternity, family member coverage,
injuries and verifiable diseases. The mania for this proposed law
needs a sedative.</TE>

<LD>Re "Business Scandals Force GOP to Consider Broader Reforms," July 8:
What a terrible dilemma politicians of both parties face as a result
of recent business scandals: Do too little and you alienate millions
of investors (i.e., voters); do too much and you alienate fat-cat
contributors who funnel millions of dollars into your campaigns.</LD>
<LD>   Whatever legislation results from the seemingly endless corporate
scandals will be insufficient if it does not include provisions to
prosecute, convict and imprison executives who commit and abet fraud
against investors and employees. Additionally, provision should be
made to confiscate their ill-gotten gains from excessive salaries,
bonuses and insider stock trades and redistribute them to their
victims. These people are no less criminal than those who take money
at gunpoint. It boggles the mind that such scam artists can walk away
from their crimes enriched and free simply because they have
political connections and can use their ill-gotten gains to hire the
best attorneys and buy the legislative protection they desire.</LD>
<LD>   The historical silliness of allowing the rich to become obscenely
richer at the expense of the poor should be stopped. Where are Robin
Hood and Teddy Roosevelt now that we need them?</LD>
<TE>   Wayne D. Kerr</TE>

<TE>   I have now read at least three articles in The Times where
corporate fraud, tax evasion, insider trading or other forms of plain
thievery were described as "shenanigans," most recently in "Why We
Love to Souffle Martha" (Commentary, July 7). That's like saying
Nixon got into some "mischief" with Watergate.</TE>
<TE>   Don't let reporters or commentators trivialize malfeasance with a
term that in my dictionary is defined as "prankishness: 'Halloween
shenanigans.' " These are crimes, or at a minimum, alleged crimes.
Call them what they are.</TE>

patriotic duty not to sell. I could have lost all my money and I
wouldn't have had a regret. As of late, though, I've begun to feel
like a patsy and decided not to be left holding the bag by the
corporate America bandits. I've had it--goodbye.</TE>

<TE>   When in the blue blazes is someone in the government or the

Wall Street? Why can't the president, vice president or some
well-known, recognized member of Congress stand up and use his "bully
pulpit" to start encouraging the American public to reverse the
downward spiral on Wall Street?</TE>
<TE>   I don't know about others, but I have already lost at least 25% of
my IRA/401(k) retirement savings in the past 18 months. Wouldn't a
little pep talk from someone in authority help restore faith in our
economy? So many of us have saved for years only now to find our
investments bleeding to death. All we hear about is doom and gloom,
war and terrorism. People are just afraid to invest their money.
Maybe we need something like the war-bonds drives of World War II to
inspire people to start building the economy again.</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   It has been suggested that the solution to the problem of lack of
investor confidence in the stock market lies in the shaky reports by
the auditors. At present, we have the auditors hired by and
responsible only to the corporations they are supposed to audit.
Enron paid Andersen $52 million in consulting fees in 2000. Do you
expect an unbiased audit when Andersen is dependent on Enron's
engagement for the following year's audit?</TE>
<TE>   The stock exchange should assign the auditing firm and bill
through dues to the corporations. The auditors should report directly
to the stock exchange and thereby to the stockholders. This would
give a degree of independence to the auditors, and consequently we
could expect a greater degree of integrity. As a retired auditor, I
say we must have independence for a fair and revealing audit. It
seems to me that this is the simplest way to deal with a difficult
situation. The corporations will fight it with all they have, but
that simply endorses the validity of the idea.</TE>

<HD>Valley Issues Hit Close to Home</HD>

<LD>If ever there was a need for the San Fernando Valley to secede from
the city of Los Angeles, the lack of concern for Valley residents
that I have experienced from the city clearly demonstrates it. I have
lived in my home since 1972. The city had never trimmed the trees in
the parkway until last year, when I filed notice with my councilwoman
about the danger these tree limbs posed. The trees have gotten so
large that the roots have cracked the sidewalks, uprooted the
sprinkler system, started to undermine a retaining wall and tilted a
mailbox in excess of 25 degrees.</LD>
<LD>   At my request, my councilwoman contacted the Bureau of Street
Maintenance, urging it to approve a permit to remove the trees. The
bureau inspected the trees and refused to approve my request for
removal of the trees because it said the trees are still alive.
Inevitably, someone will get injured and lawsuits will result.
Eventually, my property damage will result in a suit against the city
for repair costs.</LD>
<TE>   This problem is not restricted merely to my house; on a nearby
street the damage is so great to the sidewalks that walking there is
dangerous. The city spends money to make corner curbs
wheelchair-accessible, but no person in a wheelchair can negotiate
the sidewalk in front of my house safely. Why? Because some low-level
bureaucrat has been given the power from downtown. My tree concerns
merely exemplify why the time for the Valley to have its own
representation is now.</TE>

<TE>   Since I am a senior citizen who lives on a limited income--and
already pay more than half of my income for my rent--I am very
concerned that if secession wins it will give landlords a chance to
get rid of the 3% rent control limits that exist in Los Angeles.</TE>
<TE>   Considering the fact that there is a shortage of affordable
apartments in the Valley, this would give landlords an excuse to drop
the rent control and allow them to charge whatever they can get, and
a lot of other people like myself will end up being forced from their
homes.</TE>
<TE>   I have called Valley VOTE to find out what its plans are regarding
rent control, but the only answer I have received is that rent
control will "probably" continue. I am sorry to say that "probably"
does not make me feel very safe, so I am going to vote to stay in Los
Angeles.</TE>

<LD>Re " 'Sin Tax' for Trauma Centers," editorial, July 6: In addition to
your proposed "sin tax" on speeders, perhaps it would be helpful to
reduce trauma center needs by initiating a real sin penalty on
driving under the influence. First conviction: one week in the pokey
and suspension of your driver's license for six months, both without
exception. Second conviction: six months in jail, pull your driver's
license and forfeit your auto (to be sold with proceeds to a fund for
victims). Third conviction: same as "three strikes"--life. This
should save many lives, mangled bodies and families.</LD>

<TE>   I wholeheartedly support the idea of adding a fee to traffic
citations to provide critical funding to maintain high-quality trauma
centers throughout L.A. County. In my early years with the LAPD I saw
firsthand the carnage that resulted from violent traffic collisions.
But I wouldn't stop with a fee on speeding violations, as The Times
suggests. I would also recommend a fee on two other major causes of
traffic-related injury and death: red-light and unsafe-turning
violations.</TE>
<TE>   All of our homeland security measures will be for naught if the
most populated county in the United States has a trauma system that
cannot handle the personal disasters that befall many of its
residents every day.</TE>

<TE>   The Times is to be commended for its articles regarding the
dangerous condition of our public trauma and emergency-care centers.
At 7:45 p.m., June 4, my husband suffered a ruptured brain aneurysm.
By 8:30 the L.A. paramedics arrived only to tell us the doors of the
UCLA, Brotman and Santa Monica hospitals were closed to the
paramedics and to us, regardless of our full medical insurance
coverage. Their allotment, whether for a cut finger or someone in
critical condition like my husband, had been filled.</TE>
<TE>   By midnight he was finally admitted to UCLA because our daughter,
who is a doctor on staff at UCLA, was able to appeal to a fellow
physician to sign him in. Kudos to the UCLA intensive care neurology
department for saving his life. But shame on our 911 system, which
left him to die. In an emergency, everyone is at risk, no matter how
much insurance or money he has.</TE>
<TE>   We must devise a system to provide health care for everyone.
Suggestions such as those made by Jamie Court could be a start ("Let
a Public Board Set Health-Care Rates," Commentary, July 7). We must
demand that the plan to cut more clinics and trauma centers be
scrapped.</TE>
<TE>   Lillian Laskin</TE>
<TE>   West Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Court recommends "statewide public control over all health-care
dollars so that money can be directed to where it's most needed."
This proposal is the third step in the evolution of much public
policy. The first step is to identify a problem--in this case,
insufficient provision of health care for a segment of the
population. The second step is to attempt a solution by government
interference in the market, which makes the problem worse. The third
step is to claim that the worsened situation is caused by a failure
of the market and to propose more government regulation, which
continues to make the problem worse.</TE>
<TE>   The idea that a government agency can effectively allocate all
health-care dollars is a fantasy that may provide benefits in the
short term but that will only make the problem worse in the long run.</TE>

<LD>I am tired of selfish, irresponsible dog owners telling me that their
unleashed dog is chasing me only because I am running when I go out
for my morning run on public streets ("Animals Aren't Property, Pet
Activists Proclaim," July 9). I am tired of dog owners who take their
dogs out for a walk and think it is OK to allow their dogs to
defecate on my lawn and choose not to clean it up. I am tired of dog
owners whose dogs get out of their backyards and roam around the
neighborhood chasing and attacking people and animals they encounter.
I am tired of owners who permit their dogs to bark nonstop without
trying to hush them.</LD>
<LD>   If changing the term dog "owner" to dog "guardian" in legal
documents will end this selfish, irresponsible behavior of some dog
owners, then I think the L.A. City Council should make the change.
However, if using the term "guardian" in place of "owner" will do
nothing more than make a few dog owners feel better about themselves,
what's the point? Do their dogs really care?</LD>

<TE>   Although I am ambivalent about the difference between the terms
"owner" and "guardian," as a resident of West Hollywood I long ago
learned the PC terminology. However, when I read the paper with my
three Dachshund Americans, they informed me that they do not feel it
is in any way demeaning for them to refer to themselves as my owners.
They do, however, take exception to the words "dog" and "pet."</TE>

<LD>I've often heard it said that private schools do a better job of
educating our kids than the public schools do. If so, I'm for a
revised version of school vouchers. Don't give vouchers to the bright
and motivated kids who do well in the public schools, give them to
the slow-learning and unruly kids.</LD>
<LD>   Since the private schools are better and can give each student
more attention, let them prove themselves with the least-motivated
students rather than the best of the crop. That way, the slow learner
gets more attention and hopefully achieves higher grades, while the
good student will no longer be held back by the slow pace and unruly
disruptions that exist in the classrooms now.</LD>

<HD>Inside the Ballpark, a Blessing</HD>
<DH>On this summer night, 'God Bless America' becomes a song of

<SE></SE>
<AU>TOM EHRICH</AU>
<BD>RELIGION NEWS SERVICE</BD>
<DL>DURHAM, N.C.</DL>
<LD>We settle into seats near the bull, which looms over the left-field
wall and puffs smoke each time the Bulls hit a home run.</LD>
<LD>   I wonder if we will be a target, sitting here on the Fourth of
July. Ten thousand people in one place--easy pickings. Not the Mall
in Washington, D.C., but easier to breach.</LD>
<LD>   No, we're too small for a terrorist's attention. Bigger targets
abound. But if the next shoe does fall here, we will deal with it.</LD>
<TE>   I am scribbling lineups into my scorecard when we stand and join a
men's chorus in the National Anthem. They're a great choice--not some
fading rocker grabbing headlines, but a church chorus accustomed to
helping other people sing.</TE>
<TE>   On the field, ballplayers stand at attention before an enormous
50-star American flag hanging over right field, a flag much larger
than the tattered 15-star banner that waved over Baltimore after
shelling by British troops in 1814.</TE>
<TE>   Next to each player stands his Little League "escort," also at
attention, cap over heart. In the stands people sing. Nobody is
fidgeting this year. Memories of 9/11 are fresh.</TE>
<TE>   Tonight's pitching is weak. The base paths are busy. So is Section
213, where vendors, restless kids and hungry grown-ups form a
constant parade.</TE>
<TE>   Freedom is chaotic, offensive to the orderly. Freedom might begin
in the brave signing of noble documents, but it plays out in what
Thomas Jefferson called "human events."</TE>
<TE>   For the seventh-inning stretch, we don't proceed immediately to
"Take Me Out to the Ballgame." First we join in "God Bless America."
Composed in 1918 by a 30-year-old Jewish immigrant as a show tune,
"God Bless America" was revived in 1938, as world war loomed, and
introduced by Kate Smith on her radio broadcast. Irving Berlin
dedicated his hit's royalties to the Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts of
America.</TE>
<TE>   Freedom is that cantor's son escaping pogroms in Jew-hating
Russia, looking beyond his Jew-hating Roman Catholic in-laws,
composing show tunes like "White Christmas" and "Easter Parade" and
patriotic songs without any formal musical credentials.</TE>
<TE>   For a time after Sept. 11, as an angry and perplexed nation
rediscovered "God Bless America," some feared it would become an
anthem of vengeance. We were under assault by "holy warriors." Would
we wage "holy war" in return, resorting to those religious hatreds
that so scarred our former homelands?</TE>
<TE>   The answer, tonight, is no. Many an eye is filmy with tears as we
invoke God's blessing on our "home sweet home." No rage, no holy war,
just gratitude. I hear no shouts against enemies.</TE>
<TE>   On the field I see teammates from Mexico and Texas, enemies in the
1840s; and teammates from Louisiana and Ohio, enemies in the 1860s.</TE>
<TE>   Gratitude and rage are always in tension, as are blessing and
curse, peace and war, neighborliness and scapegoating. The balance
can shift. If further terrorist attacks come, as zealots turn a
nation's freedoms into weapons, Irving Berlin's "song of peace" could
quickly become an anthem of war.</TE>
<TE>   That could happen, not because we are a bad people, but because
fear always threatens freedom.</TE>
<TE>   Freedom, you see, isn't just throwing off an oppressor's chains.
Freedom is restraining oneself in respect for others. Freedom is
allowing wars to end. Freedom is resisting the chains we place on our
own spirits by hatred, revenge and religious triumphalism.</TE>
<TE>   Freedom is the hard work of stopping terrorists, but also the
"soft" work of building a just society hand in hand with people whose
faith may disagree with ours.</TE>
<TE>   Freedom is a minor league baseball game ending peacefully on a
soft summer night, ballpark lights going out, and Ray Charles singing
"America the Beautiful" as fireworks erupt beyond the smoke-breathing
bull. His rendition starts with the second verse and concludes with
the first. For in America, a blind man of color can say thanks any
way he wants.</TE>

<HD>Call to Kill Suicide Bombers' Families Stirs Passions</HD>
<DH>Conflict: Article urging execution of those who condone
relatives' acts reveals deep divisions among U.S. Jews.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>HOLLY LEBOWITZ ROSSI</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>If a young Palestinian chooses to commit an act of terrorism with the
blessing of his or her family, the consequences will be dire--the
bomber's parents, brothers and sisters will be executed soon after
the attack takes place.</LD>
<LD>   That is the policy that noted Washington lawyer Nathan Lewin
suggested in last month's issue of the respected Jewish journal
"Sh'ma: A Journal of Jewish Responsibility."</LD>
<LD>   Since then, a firestorm has erupted over Lewin's article, as well
as the response by Brandeis University's Rabbi Arthur Green, in the
form of scores of letters to the journal, plus a heated exchange in
the Forward newspaper. The debate points to the increasingly volatile
level of discourse and ethical discussion in the Jewish community.</LD>
<TE>   If American Jews have anything in common these days, it is that
they are actively thinking--but deeply divided--about the problem of
how to deter suicide bombings and resolve the ever-escalating
Israeli-Palestinian conflict.</TE>
<TE>   Lewin wrote in Sh'ma, a 32-year-old journal whose title is the
Hebrew word meaning "listen attentively," that Palestinian families
should be given ample opportunity to denounce the suicide bombings by
their children and reject financial gain from the missions. But if
the families do not comply, they should no longer be considered
innocents and should be executed.</TE>
<TE>   "This consequence would, I believe, deter most suicide
killers--many of whom now anticipate that not only will they be
rewarded in a world-to-come, but that their immediate families will
be honored and granted lavish benefits on this Earth," wrote Lewin,
who is on the adjunct faculty of George Washington Law School and
Columbia Law School and has argued cases before the U.S. Supreme
Court.</TE>
<TE>   Green, a professor of Jewish thought at Brandeis and a former
president of the Reconstructionist Rabbinical College, said that his
response upon reading Lewin's argument was to "tear my garments, as a
sign of mourning on hearing the desecration of God's name."</TE>
<TE>   Green's counterproposal is that two independent states be
established, and that the Palestinian people be shown respect and
legitimacy as a nation so that they will no longer need to resort to
terrorism.</TE>
<TE>   "Endless checkpoint delays, bulldozing of homes, uprooting of
trees, disrespecting of elders and lots more have been the daily lot
of Palestinians for 35 years," wrote Green.</TE>
<TE>   "These constant humiliations are the immediate source of the rage
that motivates suicide bombers, most of whom come from the very
respect-based culture of traditional Arab villages."</TE>
<TE>   In a flurry of discussions in the press and other public venues,
various other suggestions have been offered, even as the Forward
reported that recent surveys by Palestinian pollster Khalil Shikaki
revealed that more than 70% of Palestinians endorse suicide bombings.</TE>
<TE>   In a June 27 article in the Wall Street Journal, author Scott
Green offered to "buy Palestinian children for $30,000 each," $5,000
more than Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein has purportedly offered
families if their children carry out suicide missions.</TE>
<TE>   Harvard Law School professor Alan Dershowitz suggested in the
Jerusalem Post that leveling the villages of suicide bombers--after
the residents have been given a chance to escape--would serve as a
similar deterrent.</TE>
<TE>   The two-state solution outlined by Green is also on the table.</TE>
<TE>   "I don't think American Jews look down on a two-state solution;
they favor it," said Samuel G. Freedman, a journalism professor at
Columbia University and the author of "Jew vs. Jew: The Struggle for
the Soul of American Jewry."</TE>
<TE>   "What they feel is that it's incredibly naive and insecure for
Israel to make peace with the current Palestinian regime," he added.</TE>
<TE>   Sh'ma officials say that the decision to publish the Lewin-Green
exchange, while a tortured one, was an important way to give voice to
the range of opinion that exists in the Jewish community.</TE>
<TE>   "Extreme positions on all sides have been filtering in whispers in
all walks of the Jewish community," said Yosef I. Abramowitz, who is
the publisher of Sh'ma, which circulates to 10,000 readers. "As a
public service, we felt we had to out the issue and had to have that
conversation," he said.</TE>
<TE>   "It's alive," Abramowitz said of the debate, adding that it might
serve as a powerful weapon against suicide bombings by itself.</TE>
<TE>   "What I'm wondering is that perhaps the fact that the Jewish
community is debating this might serve as a deterrent to suicide
bombers. The fact that what used to be an extreme idea whispered at
Shabbat tables is now openly debated might give pause to those who
would become suicide terrorists," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Freedman, however, calls Lewin's argument "so extreme that it has
created a distraction."</TE>
<TE>   "The harm isn't the vigor of the debate, it's the waste of time
and energy. The discussion American Jews ought to be having is what
kind of form unilateral separation should take," Freedman said.</TE>
<TE>   The discussions "suggest that a deeply disturbing extremism has
gained legitimacy in American Jewish discussion of the conflict
here," said Gershom Gorenberg, an associate editor and columnist at
the Jerusalem Report and author of "The End of Days: Fundamentalism
and the Struggle for the Temple Mount."</TE>
<TE>   "Such fantasies of revenge are not healthy for American Jewry and
do Israel no good," he said.</TE>
<TE>   But Abramowitz said that the current milieu of increasing violence
in the Middle East and anti-Semitic rhetoric and activity in Europe
and the United States would change the terms of any debate.</TE>
<TE>   Sadly, he said, at least a dozen extremist and anti-Semitic
postings on the Sh'ma message boards have tainted the conversation
and had to be removed.</TE>
<TE>   "It only confirms that we're living at a time when the Jewish
people feel under attack both in Israel and in the Diaspora, and that
changes the focus, it changes the tone of the debate within the
Jewish community, unfortunately," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Lewin dismissed Green and others who say Israel's security is
relatively intact and that it is not struggling for its very
survival. He maintained his position that President Bush should
implement his policy for any bombings that might occur on U.S. soil,
and that Israel should then follow suit.</TE>
<TE>   "The easiest preventive measure would be to announce that anybody
that does this in the U.S., the president would sign a death warrant
for their parents, brothers and sisters," said Lewin.</TE>

<HD>Yankees Are Hurting After Loss to Indians</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>After losing Roger Clemens and the game, New York Yankee Manager Joe
Torre saw at least one thing that made him feel better--Raul Mondesi
was moving around.</LD>
<LD>   Mondesi hurt himself crashing into the right-field wall trying to
catch Omar Vizquel's run-scoring triple in the 10th inning, and the
Cleveland Indians defeated New York, 2-1, Friday night at Cleveland.</LD>
<LD>   Earlier, Clemens left the game because of a strained right groin.</LD>
<TE>   "I felt better when I saw [Raul] moving his limbs," Torre said.
"When he's laying there still, you're scared to death."</TE>
<TE>   Mondesi's right shoulder and head slammed into the wall, and he
fell to the ground as the winning run scored. Mondesi remained on the
warning track for several minutes before standing up and walking over
to a cart that drove him from the field.</TE>
<TE>   "He got the wind knocked out of him," Torre said. "He never lost
consciousness. I think it was his sternum and knees. Hopefully it is
nothing more than a shaking up."</TE>
<TE>   Einar Diaz opened the Cleveland 10th by beating out a slow roller
to second baseman Alfonso Soriano, who tried to backhand the ball
over to first base, but threw it past Nick Johnson.</TE>
<TE>   After Chris Magruder popped up a bunt attempt for the first out,
Vizquel hit a 3-2 pitch from Steve Karsay into the gap in
right-center. Mondesi, acquired two weeks ago from Toronto, made a
valiant attempt for the ball, which ricocheted into center field as
Diaz easily scored.</TE>
<TE>   Clemens left after five scoreless innings. He gave up two hits and
struck out four but remained winless in five starts since June 9.</TE>
<TE>   Vizquel helped the Indians tie it in the eighth, 1-1, and end
Mariano Rivera's streak of consecutive saves at 17. With two on and
two out, Vizquel bounced a single to left off Rivera, past the
outstretched glove of diving shortstop Derek Jeter, to score
pinch-runner John McDonald from second.</TE>
<TE>   Seattle 2, Tampa Bay 1--Jamie Moyer pitched two-hit ball over 7
1/3 innings, Bret Boone had an RBI single in the sixth, and Desi
Relaford drove in the go-ahead run in the eighth when he grounded
into a force play with the bases loaded at St. Petersburg, Fla. Moyer
(9-4), who struck out the side in the sixth, retired the last 11
batters he faced.</TE>
<TE>   Toronto 5, Boston 0--Roy Halladay outpitched Derek Lowe in a
matchup of All-Stars and the Blue Jays ended an 11-game losing streak
with a victory at Toronto. Jose Cruz Jr. homered, tripled and doubled
for the Blue Jays, and he also drove in three runs. Halladay (10-4)
and Kelvim Escobar combined on a three-hit shutout. Halladay gave up
three singles in eight innings.</TE>
<TE>   Oakland 1, Baltimore 0--Tim Hudson outpitched Jason Johnson and
Miguel Tejada drove in the game's only run in the first inning for
the Athletics at Baltimore. Oakland scored in the first when Mark
Ellis hit a double and came home on a single by Tejada. Hudson (7-7)
improved to 6-0 in six career starts against the Orioles.</TE>
<TE>   Minnesota 4, Texas 3--Jacque Jones hit a two-out single in the
bottom of the 11th to drive in Dustan Mohr with the winning run for
the Twins at Minneapolis. Trailing 3-2, the Rangers tied it in the
ninth off closer Eddie Guardado. Ivan Rodriguez's sacrifice fly to
center scored Juan Gonzalez.</TE>
<TE>   Detroit 2, Chicago 1--Mark Redman gave up four hits and walked
three in six-plus innings and Juan Acevedo got four outs for his 15th
save in 18 chances for the Tigers at Detroit.</TE>

<HD>Angels Learn They Can Lean on Appier</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Struggling veteran pitches six strong innings in
11-3 victory over the Royals.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL SHAIKIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>KANSAS CITY, Mo.</DL>
<LD>During this season of trading frenzy, many a contending team covets a
veteran starting pitcher, the been-there, done-that guy who can
stabilize a rotation by providing quality and consistency, by rising
to meet the pressure rather than collapsing beneath its weight.</LD>
<LD>   The Angels aren't looking for one of those pitchers. They hope
they already have two. They're keeping their fingers crossed that
Kevin Appier and Aaron Sele can deliver, and in so doing deliver the
Angels into the playoffs.</LD>
<LD>   Appier and the Angels took a significant step in that direction
Friday, with an 11-3 victory over the Kansas City Royals. Appier
pitched six solid innings to win for the second time in his last nine
starts, and the Angels closed within a half-game of the Boston Red
Sox in the race for the American League wild-card berth.</LD>
<TE>   The Angels won their fifth consecutive game, shrugging off their
weeklong offensive slump with a 14-hit attack, including three hits
from Tim Salmon. Garret Anderson homered and drove in three runs, and
Scott Spiezio drove in three more. And, with another impressive
outing, deposed starter Scott Schoeneweis appears to be prospering in
the bullpen.</TE>
<TE>   But the hero was Appier, the Angels' most impressive starter over
the first seven weeks of the season and perhaps their least
impressive over the last seven. In his first nine starts, he lost
once, with a 2.96 earned-run average. In his next eight, he won once,
with a 7.09 ERA.</TE>
<TE>   "People are looking to you, as one of the starters, to be a
significant figure in what goes on," Appier said. "Hopefully, I can
hold up my end of the bargain and be a significant factor in us
having a great year."</TE>
<TE>   He pitched through forearm stiffness in several starts, and he
pitched through poor mechanics--"I was uncoordinated, really," he
said--in several starts.</TE>
<TE>   But, in his last start before the All-Star break, he gave up three
runs in the first six innings. In the seventh inning, Schoeneweis
gave up a double that allowed two runners inherited from Appier to
score.</TE>
<TE>   On Friday, he gave up three runs over six innings, and two of the
runs would not have scored had a wicked hopper not handcuffed third
baseman Troy Glaus. This time, he got the victory.</TE>
<TE>   "Having your effort rewarded gives you that extra confidence,"
Appier said. "You don't have to convince yourself you're throwing the
ball well. It's shown by the results."</TE>
<TE>   The same is true for Schoeneweis, who suddenly became a pivotal
figure in the Angel bullpen Friday, when the Angels put Dennis Cook
in the disabled list. Schoeneweis, now the lone left-handed reliever,
pitched two perfect innings Friday after striking out the only batter
he faced Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   In his last three appearances, he has retired 10 consecutive
batters, striking out five.</TE>
<TE>   "I'm just trying to do a job and help the team. That's pretty much
the bottom line," he said. "It's not what I see myself doing for the
long term. I want to start.</TE>
<TE>   "But, for the time being, I'll do the job for the betterment of
the team."</TE>
<TE>   No team can count on a relentless offense all season, but the
Angels pronounced themselves a contender after building their team
upon a foundation of starting pitching.</TE>
<TE>   "Starting pitching is always a key," Anderson said. "It's never
not a factor. That's the only way you can win in this game."</TE>
<TE>   Jarrod Washburn, the Angels' ace, is riding a 10-game winning
streak. Ramon Ortiz has lost once since May 24. John Lackey, the
rookie who replaced Schoeneweis, has impressed in all three of his
starts.</TE>
<TE>   The question marks surround the veterans, Appier and Sele.</TE>
<TE>   "Ramon, Washburn and now Lackey have really given us consistent
start after consistent start," Manager Mike Scioscia said. "I think
Appier and Sele showing signs of stepping up is very important. Those
two guys are very key."</TE>
<TE>   Appier won Friday. Sele starts tonight, bringing his 5.03 ERA with
him.</TE>

<HD>Report: Disney May Sell at a Loss</HD>
<DH>Baseball: DuPuy says a team has dropped sale price more
than $100 million. Source confirms he means Angels.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL SHAIKIN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>KANSAS CITY, Mo.</DL>
<LD>The Walt Disney Co. might be willing to take a significant loss in
order to sell the Angels, a top major league official has suggested.</LD>
<LD>   In an interview with Baseball America magazine, Bob DuPuy disputed
the notion that owners can recoup operating losses simply by selling
their teams for a profit and said that several franchises on the
market cannot find buyers.</LD>
<LD>   "We have one team that's been for sale for some time that has
dropped the purchase price more than $100 million and still does not
have a buyer," said DuPuy, baseball's president and chief operating
officer.</LD>
<TE>   DuPuy was unavailable to elaborate or otherwise comment on his
remarks, but a highly placed baseball source confirmed DuPuy was
referring to the Angels.</TE>
<TE>   A source close to Disney, speaking on the condition of anonymity,
denied the statement that the asking price has been cut by $100
million.</TE>
<TE>   Disney asked $300 million for the Angels in sale negotiations
three years ago.</TE>
<TE>   Donald Watkins, the Alabama businessman interested in buying the
Angels, has told Disney officials he does not believe the franchise
is worth more than $200 million.</TE>
<TE>   Commissioner Bud Selig said last week that he could not recall
Disney asking for permission to share its confidential financial data
with any other potential buyer in the last six months.</TE>
<TE>   Disney paid $140 million to buy the Angels in 1996 and another $98
million to renovate Edison Field, so a $200-million sale price would
not allow the company to recover those costs, let alone any operating
losses.</TE>
<TE>   The Angels reported losses of $100 million from 1995-2001,
according to figures released by the commissioner's office.</TE>
<TE>   Watkins' advisors and Disney officials are continuing to discuss
how a bid could be structured to account for a potential player
strike--the longer the work stoppage, the lower the purchase price.</TE>
<TE>   Forbes magazine values the Angels at $195 million, but a long-term
labor agreement could enhance the franchise value and attract other
potential buyers.</TE>

<HD>Shoulder Injury Could End Cook's Career</HD>

<DL>KANSAS CITY, Mo.</DL>
<LD>Dennis Cook, who threw his first major league pitch in 1988, might
have thrown his last major league pitch.</LD>
<LD>   The Angels put the left-handed reliever on the disabled list
Friday because of a suspected torn labrum in his left shoulder,
Manager Mike Scioscia said. With Cook already leaning toward
retirement at the end of the season, a medical recommendation for
surgery could mean the end of his career.</LD>
<LD>   "If my career ended today, I would be happy," he said. "I have no
regrets. I've been the luckiest man to walk the face of the Earth."</LD>
<TE>   Cook, 39, has a 2.86 earned-run average this season but he has
given up 13 hits in his last 6 2/3 innings. He said he has felt
weakness in the shoulder the last two to three weeks. After three
days of rest over the All-Star break, the condition had not improved
when Cook worked out Thursday.</TE>
<TE>   To replace Cook on the roster, the Angels recalled reliever
Brendan Donnelly from triple-A Salt Lake City. Cook will be examined
Monday in California, and he hopes doctors will tell him he can
return this season, after rest and rehabilitation.</TE>
<TE>   Cook, a two-time World Series participant and a former Dodger
teammate of Scioscia, said it was "very unlikely" he would want to
play next season. He is the father of 4-year-old triplets.</TE>
<TE>   "They're always asking me, how many more days until you come
home?" he said. "I've played this game a long time so I could be able
to take care of them. I don't want to wake up when my kids are 10 or
12 and have missed everything."</TE>

<HD>Padres Get Buchanan in Trade With Twins</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Minnesota Twins traded right fielder Brian Buchanan to the San
Diego Padres on Friday and recalled outfielder Michael Cuddyer from
triple-A Edmonton.</LD>
<LD>   In exchange for Buchanan, the Padres gave up minor league
shortstop Jason Bartlett, who will report to Minnesota's affiliate in
the Class-A Florida State League.</LD>
<LD>   Buchanan was batting .252 with five doubles, one triple, five
homers and 15 runs batted in in 135 at-bats and 44 games.</LD>
<TE>   Buchanan was a player the Twins believed could become a power
hitter when they put in the lineup every day, but he lost his job in
mid-May because of the emergence of rookies Bobby Kielty and Dustan
Mohr in right.</TE>
<TE>   "There just weren't enough at-bats for Buchanan," General Manager
Terry Ryan said. "Mohr and Kielty are getting the majority of the
at-bats in right field ... "</TE>
<TE>   Cuddyer, one of the organization's top prospects since he was
picked in the first round of the 1997 draft, joined the team Friday
and will start in right field tonight against Texas.</TE>
<TE>   Buchanan, 26, was acquired from the New York Yankees in 1998 along
with Eric Milton and Cristian Guzman for Chuck Knoblauch.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The Padres also welcomed back slugger Phil Nevin and made several
other moves. Nevin, who had been on an injury rehabilitation
assignment, was activated from the 15-day disabled list.</TE>
<TE>   Nevin sat out 35 games because of a broken left arm. An All-Star
in 2001, he hit .293 with five homers and 21 RBIs in 39 games. The
Padres were 19-20 with Nevin in the lineup this season, 16-33 when
was out.</TE>
<TE>   The Padres also activated right-handed starter Bobby Jones from
the 15-day disabled list and purchased the contract of right-handed
reliever Tom Davey from Portland. Jones had been out with a strained
right elbow.</TE>
<TE>   Right-hander Kevin Jarvis, the opening day starter, went on the
60-day disabled list. Jarvis went 2-4 with a 4.37 earned-run average
in seven starts before having surgery to repair his right-flexor
tendon on Tuesday in Birmingham, Ala.</TE>
<TE>   The Padres also traded infielder D'Angelo Jimenez to the Chicago
White Sox for two minor leaguers: outfielder Alex Fernandez and
catcher Humberto Quintero. Jimenez, 24, was hitting .240 with three
homers and 33 RBIs with the Padres.</TE>

<DH>Preparing for 2008 Games, a $30-billion facelift shows
China's cultural evolution ... or is that revolution?</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ALAN ABRAHAMSON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL>BEIJING</DL>
<LD>A year ago tonight, this sprawling, ancient capital erupted in
elation. The International Olympic Committee had just awarded Beijing
the 2008 Olympic Games, affirming for millions--if not billions--of
Chinese the importance of China's place in the world, triggering a
flag-waving, horn-honking, music-jamming, firecracker-exploding party
in the streets.</LD>
<LD>   Now, under a polluted sky, amid the never-ending clamor of
construction crews, the heady scent of money seemingly in the air
along with the dizzying stench of exhaust fumes and the unmistakable
aroma of Kentucky Fried Chicken, authorities have launched the most
ambitious program ever undertaken in preparation for an Olympic
Games.</LD>
<LD>   The Chinese have vowed to stage the best Olympic Games. They
intend to spend $30 billion readying Beijing for 2008, far more than
has been spent on any other Olympics. Their slogan: "New Beijing,
Great Olympics."</LD>
<TE>   Local and national officials intend to do the usual--build an
Olympic stadium, an Olympic village and various sporting venues. But
they also seek to use the Games as a catalyst to transform Beijing,
improving and modernizing the city's roads, railroads, airports,
telecommunications links and sewage systems and, they say, improving
its environment. Beijing is already in the throes of a massive
building program; the Games will accelerate matters dramatically.</TE>
<TE>   Some experts even say the Games--in combination with China's
admission to the World Trade Organization--represent an opportunity
to bring about a dramatic turning point in Chinese history.</TE>
<TE>   "From the evidence I've seen ... the government will use [the
Games] to effect deeper political and social unity," said Thomas
Breslin, a China scholar at Florida International University in Miami
who spent two weeks this spring touring Beijing and eastern China.</TE>
<TE>   "Getting ready for the Olympics, being an impressive host, an
efficient host, will represent an opportunity somewhat similar to the
great campaigns in previous regimes in China."</TE>
<TE>   As an indicator of the social pressure already under way, the
Beijing Youth Daily newspaper recently launched a campaign urging the
capital's men to keep their shirts on while outdoors, even in
sweltering summer heat. The newspaper made it plain that it did so
with 2008 in mind--that jelly-bellied, sweaty guys on parade in the
streets did not offer the sort of image becoming an Olympic host
city.</TE>
<TE>   Observed Liu Jingmin, vice mayor of Beijing and executive vice
president of the Beijing 2008 organizing committee, "It's like the
2008 Games are a boat. There is enthusiasm and hope inside the boat,"
meaning the relatively small circle of those directly involved now
with Olympic preparations. But as time goes on, "everybody in
Beijing, in society" will be urged to climb aboard.</TE>
<TE>   Can it be done? Will it be done? How will it be done? And, perhaps
most intriguing, should it be done in a nation with enduring
human-rights concerns?</TE>
<TE>   The International Olympic Committee answered the last of these
questions last year, when it overwhelmingly voted to award the Games
to Beijing, acknowledging but blunting the human-rights issue.</TE>
<TE>   Concerns over human rights played a key role in sidetracking
Beijing's 1993 bid for the 2000 Games.</TE>
<TE>   Such concerns still simmer, with activists seeking to draw the
IOC's attention to human-rights concerns.</TE>
<TE>   Some have been clearly documented--as in the cases of 65 people
executed on June 26 for drug crimes, many after public rallies where
thousands watched judges condemn the accused. Chinese authorities
have said they believe such executions serve as a deterrent. United
Nations authorities have said they do not condone the practice.</TE>
<TE>   Some have been less so--as was the case of a report, issued in May
by U.S.-based Chinese democracy activists, not independently
verified--alleging that police in northeastern China had already been
told to get ready for the Games by targeting followers of the Falun
Gong movement. Its followers say it is a meditation and exercise
group; the government calls it a cult, and banned it in 1999.</TE>
<TE>   The IOC says it is resolutely committed to holding the 2008 Games
in Beijing.</TE>
<TE>   "The Games will improve the [human-rights] situation," IOC
President Jacques Rogge said in a recent interview. "I've said to the
Chinese authorities, 'Please do your utter best to improve human
rights.' I am convinced the Games will improve the situation. And we
are going to work for that."</TE>
<TE>   Rogge, a Belgian elected last July to an eight-year term,
succeeding Juan Antonio Samaranch of Spain, has said repeatedly that
the IOC will not monitor China's human-rights situation but will be
in close contact with the United Nations and such rights groups as
Amnesty International.</TE>
<TE>   In April, after Rogge had appeared on the BBC show "Hardtalk,"
saying the IOC "will make sure within the sphere of sports ... that
[human rights] will be respected," some follow-up reports suggested
the IOC might go so far as to take the Games away from Beijing if the
rights situation was not to the IOC's approval.</TE>
<TE>   "There was a wrong interpretation," Rogge said. He emphasized that
any such suggestion is "the most stupid [idea] that I've ever heard
about."</TE>
<TE>   The truth is, the IOC is eagerly anticipating the 2008 Games.</TE>
<TE>   It views the Games as a chance to spread the Olympic gospel to
one-fifth of the world's population and expects them to serve, Rogge
said, as "a big booster for sport in Asia."</TE>
<TE>   Also, for the IOC, Chinese Olympic officials and scores of
companies in China and abroad, the 2008 Games offer a big-time
money-making opportunity.</TE>
<TE>   Here is a chance to introduce products to an emerging market of
1.4 billion people, or, for those firms already doing business in
China, to expand marketing reach by piggybacking on the glamour of
the five rings, as well as on a project that carries nationalistic,
patriotic zeal.</TE>
<TE>   Liu, the Beijing 2008 executive vice president, said he believes
organizers might be able to raise $700 million from highly motivated
corporate sponsors. Combined with about $300 million due from IOC
marketing programs, that would mean $1 billion in sponsorships.</TE>
<TE>   Asked what he thought Chairman Mao would think about $1 billion in
capitalist sponsor income underwriting an Olympics in China, Liu
replied, laughing, "I believe if he was still alive, he'd be very
happy. And he'd be happy [to preside] over the opening ceremonies
because he loved sports so much."</TE>
<TE>   Said Nick Moore, the Beijing regional manager for Coca-Cola, a
longtime Olympic sponsor, "They are really on the road here. The WTO,
the Olympics, the World Cup," a reference to China's first appearance
earlier this year in the global soccer tournament. "There's so much
optimism here--a feeling their time has come, that it's their turn on
the world stage.</TE>
<TE>   "We want to help China have a good time. We want to help China
celebrate."</TE>
<TE>   Here, too, is a chance to get in on some of that $30 billion in
advance money. The Chinese intend to spend $4 billion on
Games-related construction and another $26 billion on roadways, rail
lines and environmental protection.</TE>
<TE>   "There is no question China is a totally different dimension--in
terms of what the Games can do for China and what China can do for
the Games," said Michael Payne, the IOC's marketing director. "And in
the business community, there is an incredible realization at the
role the Games will play as a catalyst for change."</TE>
<TE>   Yuan Bin, Beijing 2008's deputy marketing director, said that more
than 100 companies had already come calling at Beijing 2008's
temporary offices, adding, "Every day, there are companies coming."</TE>
<TE>   Rick Burton, executive director of the University of Oregon's
Warsaw Sports Marketing Center, said, "If you're not already in
China, it's already too late. You've got to be on the ground, working
China right now. The way they build relationships is very different
from the way we do things in the West."</TE>
<TE>   Nineteen Olympic venues in Beijing need to be built, including an
80,000-seat stadium, an 18,000-seat arena for gymnastics and
volleyball and an 18,000-seat swimming center. Thirteen other venues
will be renovated or expanded.</TE>
<TE>   The sports venues will be concentrated at two sites, one north of
central Beijing, the other west, both abutting what is called the
Fourth Ring Road--at present the outer ring of a series of concentric
highways encircling Beijing. By 2008 plans call for a Fifth and a
Sixth Ring Road.</TE>
<TE>   The city will nearly quadruple the size of its subway system, from
54 kilometers to 201. It also plans to build new bus terminals and
parking lots.</TE>
<TE>   In addition, it plans to improve sewage systems and add thousands
of acres of trees, according to the Beijing 2008 master plan. The
trees, officials hope, will help limit Beijing's fierce sandstorms
carrying the product of dust that flies in from the Gobi desert,
particularly in the winter and spring.</TE>
<TE>   The 2008 master plan calls for Olympic-related construction work
to begin in 2003 and be completed by 2006, allowing for venue testing
before the Games.</TE>
<TE>   As it is, the construction clamor is about to get more fierce.
Shang Yuzhu, a 79-year-old retired kindergarten teacher, shook her
head in amazement.</TE>
<TE>   "Since the [WTO] and the Olympics were announced, Beijing has
become more internationalized. We've seen so much more construction,"
she said one day recently over a lunch of homemade dumplings, a
construction crane shining bright yellow in the dull afternoon haze
outside her fourth-story window.</TE>
<TE>   A lifelong resident of Beijing, she added, "I've even lost my way
because there is so much construction. I can't find my place. So many
changes. So many more to come."</TE>

<HD>Is It a Ploy? For Now, Trinidad Will Stay Retired</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>

<LD>"What my father says is what I will do."</LD>
<LD>   --Felix Trinidad Jr.</LD>
<LD>   *</LD>
<TE>   That's the bottom line. Not the negotiating ploys of Don King. Not
the financial resources of Bob Arum. Not the resolve of Bernard
Hopkins.</TE>
<TE>   Not even the true feelings of Trinidad.</TE>
<TE>   The announcement last week that the Puerto Rican fighter was
retiring at 29 while still in his prime has been met with skepticism
throughout the boxing world.</TE>
<TE>   But the legion of doubters, which consists of the majority of
boxing people, are not taking into consideration the iron will and
unorthodox philosophy of Felix Trinidad Sr., Don Felix, who makes all
the decisions for his son. The quote at the top of this story has
been repeated by the younger Trinidad over and over through the
years.</TE>
<TE>   News of the retirement came first in a statement from Trinidad's
lawyer, Nicolas Medina, released in San Juan.</TE>
<TE>   Reaction: Is this a joke?</TE>
<TE>   Next, Don Felix, his son's manager/trainer, came forward to
reiterate the retirement announcement.</TE>
<TE>   The reaction: Who's kidding whom?</TE>
<TE>   And finally, the younger Trinidad himself, in an interview with a
Puerto Rican paper, confirmed he has made an irreversible decision.</TE>
<TE>   Reaction: No way.</TE>
<TE>   This is, after all, boxing. Fighters retire all the time, but,
with the exception of Rocky Marciano, Marvin Hagler and few others,
they always return until they can't say their names without slurring
the words.</TE>
<TE>   Trinidad is far from that. He has 40 victories, including 34
knockouts, in 41 fights, his only loss being to Hopkins last
September in a match in which Trinidad appeared too small to take on
the dominant figure in the 160-pound division. But he was big enough
to storm through the welterweight and super welterweight divisions,
forcing Oscar De La Hoya to run in the last three rounds of their
1999 fight and inflicting heavy damage on David Reid and Fernando
Vargas in subsequent matches.</TE>
<TE>   If Trinidad were to stay around, he might not get a fight with
Hopkins, which is a good thing for Trinidad. But a De La Hoya rematch
is his for the asking. De La Hoya had hoped to fight Trinidad in
September after taking on Vargas in May. When De La Hoya's hand
injury postponed the Vargas fight until September, a possible
Trinidad match had to be moved to next spring.</TE>
<TE>   "A De La Hoya-Trinidad fight was very close to being done for
September," said Richard Schaefer, De La Hoya's business advisor.
"Now it would be February or March. If he still wants to fight, we
are ready. Our dance card is open."</TE>
<TE>   Bob Sheridan, the blow-by-blow announcer for many King fights,
isn't convinced Trinidad-De La Hoya II won't happen.</TE>
<TE>   "In my 30 years with Don King," Sheridan said, "I have never known
him to let a fighter of Felix Trinidad's caliber get away at this
stage of his career."</TE>
<TE>   The problem with that logic is that this is not a King decision.
Trinidad remains the promoter's biggest cash cow and King would like
nothing better than to sit across the table from his old rival, Arum,
De La Hoya's promoter, and use the leverage gained in Trinidad's
earlier victory to carve out a lucrative deal. If it comes at Arum's
expense, all the better.</TE>
<TE>   But Don Felix has always had a different agenda. From the
beginning, he envisioned his son moving up, from 147 pounds to 154 to
160 and finally to a victory over undisputed light-heavyweight
champion Roy Jones. Don Felix turned his back on a De La Hoya
rematch, signing instead for his son to fight Reid and capture the
154-pound title despite the scorn of those who said Trinidad had
turned his back on a $15-million payday.</TE>
<TE>   The Trinidads even had some believing a victory over Jones was
possible before the Hopkins fight. Jones was certainly excited about
the prospect of meeting Trinidad.</TE>
<TE>   But now, with a Hopkins fight in doubt, and a Jones fight even
more unlikely, Don Felix doesn't seem interested in coming back to a
lower weight to take on De La Hoya, a man his son has already beaten.</TE>
<TE>   What's the point?</TE>
<TE>   To many, a potential $15 million would be a big enough point.</TE>
<TE>   "I always said from way back," Trinidad told El Nuevo Dia, a
Puerto Rican daily, "that the day I announce that I am retiring, I
really mean it. I'm not going back to the ring.</TE>
<TE>   "This decision was thought through and analyzed well and I will
stand by my decision even if a fight with Hopkins could be made
today.</TE>
<TE>   "I would like to deny the rumor that the other reason I retired
was because I was in a feud with my father and my lawyer. My health
is good, so poor health is also not a reason for my retirement."</TE>
<TE>   Never say never, especially in boxing.</TE>
<TE>   But also never doubt that Don Felix will do the unexpected.</TE>
<TE>   Done Deal or Just Another Spiel?</TE>
<TE>   In a conference call earlier this week to promote next Saturday's
rematch against Vernon Forrest in Indianapolis, Shane Mosley casually
mentioned he'll be fighting a rematch against De La Hoya in February
or March.</TE>
<TE>   Mosley didn't say he might  fight the man he beat by split
decision two years ago. He said he will, that only a few details
remain to close the deal.</TE>
<TE>   That came as news to Schaefer, who said there haven't even been
preliminary discussions about such a fight. De La Hoya is holding out
hope Trinidad will come around.</TE>
<TE>   But if not, if Mosley beats Forrest, if De La Hoya beats Vargas in
September, if De La Hoya's injured left hand holds up, if discussions
between the De La Hoya and Mosley camps prove fruitful, if all those
ifs are satisfied, then yes, Mosley-De La Hoya II will indeed be a
done deal.</TE>

<TE>   More often than not, soccer teams play for ties and are happy to
get one.</TE>
<TE>   And who can forget Ara Parseghian having Notre Dame play for a tie
against Michigan State in their classic 10-10 game in 1966?</TE>
<TE>   Ultimate test: Steve Fossett has swum the English Channel,
finished the Iditarod dogsled race, competed in the 24 Hours of
LeMans and become the first man to fly a hot-air balloon solo around
the world. Steve Hummer of the Atlanta Journal Constitution asks,
"Will he take the next, most perilous challenge when it is
offered--managing the Cubs?"</TE>
<TE>   Cryonic failure: "I can't believe anybody would pay a lot of money
for DNA from Ted Williams because it's no guarantee of greatness,"
Roger Brigham told Tom FitzGerald of the San Francisco Chronicle.
"Case in point: John Henry Williams."</TE>
<TE>   Bigger is better: At last, an NFL player who acknowledges he
weighs 400 pounds. Offensive lineman Aaron Gibson tipped the scales
at 410 when the Dallas Cowboys opened practice.</TE>
<TE>   According to Pro Football Hall of Fame officials, he is the first
official 400-pounder.</TE>
<TE>   Try it sometime: Tony Stewart, who just wants to race cars--any
kind of cars--keeps such a busy schedule that he is difficult to
catch up with.</TE>
<TE>   "You know Tony, he's like trying to nail jelly to a post
sometimes," team owner Chip Ganassi said.</TE>
<TE>   Looking up: A zoo in Switzerland has named two baby giraffes after
Ronaldo and Rivaldo, stars of Brazil's World Cup champions.</TE>
<TE>   Trivia answer: He made 18 pars.</TE>
<TE>   And finally: Safety Marques Anderson, a third-round draft choice
from UCLA, has signed with the Green Bay Packers for a three-year
deal estimated to be about $1.3 million with a signing bonus of
$415,000.</TE>
<TE>   What's so unusual about that? The signing took place at a tattoo
parlor where Packer officials tracked down the 5-foot-11, 213-pound
former Bruin.</TE>

<HD>Diamondbacks Sleep Tighter</HD>
<DH>Dodgers: Schilling improves to 15-3, Spivey and Colbrunn
homer, and Arizona closes gap to a half-game.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>MIKE DiGIOVANNA</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>As Laker star Kobe Bryant watched from a luxury suite above the
first-base dugout, the Dodgers experienced a three-peat of their own
Friday night. Unlike the recent achievement of the
purple-and-gold-clad, basketball-playing residents of Los Angeles,
this one will not be followed by a parade.</LD>
<LD>   Curt Schilling won his major league-leading 15th game to lead
Arizona to a 3-2 victory over the Dodgers before 43,147 in Dodger
Stadium, marking the first time the Dodgers have lost three
consecutive games since their season-opening three-game sweep at the
hands of the San Francisco Giants. The Diamondbacks trimmed the
Dodgers' lead in the National League West to a half-game.</LD>
<LD>   "We haven't lost three games in a row since the opening series,"
Dodger center fielder Dave Roberts said. "This is a little bit of a
gut-check time for us. I've had confidence in this team from Day 1.
This is the time we have to prove ourselves."</LD>
<TE>   It is no time to panic, Dodger Manager Jim Tracy said.</TE>
<TE>   "No, no, no," Tracy said, in response to a question about whether
a three-game losing streak would affect the Dodgers emotionally. "We
lost three in a row to open the season and bounced back. When we get
up [this morning] we'll still be in first place. We won't even
concern ourselves with that."</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers have had to concern themselves with two of baseball's
best pitchers--Schilling and left-hander Randy Johnson--the last two
nights, and the result has been two low-scoring, one-run losses.</TE>
<TE>   Schilling's streak of complete-game victories ended at two, but
the veteran right-hander gave the Diamondbacks seven-plus strong
innings, limiting the Dodgers to two runs--one earned--and five hits,
striking out five and walking two.</TE>
<TE>   Schilling (15-3) improved his career record against the Dodgers to
13-5 with a 2.81 earned-run average and extended his personal win
streak over the Dodgers to nine games. He has not lost to the Dodgers
since July 26, 1997, when he was with Philadelphia.</TE>
<TE>   Second baseman Junior Spivey and first baseman Greg Colbrunn
homered off Dodger starter Odalis Perez (10-5) in the fifth inning,
as the Diamondbacks erased a 1-0 deficit with a three-run rally.
Schilling and three relievers made it stand up.</TE>
<TE>   "He's a tough customer," Tracy said of Schilling. "When you have
to face him [or Johnson], your starter has to be right up to par with
them. He has to get up in the morning knowing you have to pitch a
heck of a game because your chances of throwing a touchdown up there
against one of them is unlikely."</TE>
<TE>   All the Dodgers managed Friday night was two extra points, as
Shawn Green doubled and scored on Spivey's error in the fourth and
Roberts tripled and scored on Paul Lo Duca's single in the eighth.</TE>
<TE>   Arizona Manager Bob Brenly pulled Schilling after Lo Duca's hit in
favor of left-hander Mike Myers, who got Green to pop to short.
Former Dodger right-hander Mike Fetters, acquired last Saturday from
Pittsburgh, came on to retire Eric Karros on an inning-ending, 6-3
double play, and closer Byung-Hyun Kim retired the Dodgers in order
in the ninth inning for his 24th save.</TE>
<TE>   Perez grooved a 2-0 fastball to Spivey with two outs in the fifth
inning, and Spivey lined it over the right-field wall for his 10th
homer and a 1-1 tie.</TE>
<TE>   Craig Counsell followed with a blooper over the head of shortstop
Cesar Izturis, who got a piece of the ball with his leaping effort
but couldn't make the catch. Colbrunn then tore into a 2-2 changeup,
sending a towering drive just inside the foul pole in left field for
a two-run homer--his fourth of the season--and a 3-1 lead.</TE>
<TE>   It was only the second time this season that Perez gave up two
home runs in one game. Perez was pulled after six innings and
replaced by right-hander Guillermo Mota, who threw two perfect
innings of relief, and Eric Gagne, who retired the side in order in
the ninth.</TE>
<TE>   Dodger left fielder Brian Jordan bailed Perez out of a
first-and-third, two-out jam in the first inning, racing toward the
line to make a diving catch of Matt Williams' drive, potentially
saving two runs.</TE>
<TE>   "We faced two Cy Young-caliber pitchers, we battled them to the
end and came up a run short each night," Tracy said. "They had one
offensive inning where they hit two home runs, and we tried to put
something together in the eighth and came up short.... It was really
a classic major league game."</TE>

<HD>Mota Might Be Just What They Need</HD>
<DH></DH>

<AU>Mike DiGiovanna</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>The Dodgers spent much of the winter searching for a closer, not
realizing that one of baseball's best ninth-inning specialists, Eric
Gagne, was right under their noses.</LD>
<LD>   With the July 31 non-waiver trade deadline approaching, the
Dodgers are in the market for another reliever, and while they'd
prefer a left-hander, they would also consider a power right-hander
who could be used in a setup role.</LD>
<LD>   Could the answer, again, be right in their own bullpen?</LD>
<TE>   When Guillermo Mota arrived in Vero Beach, Fla., after being
acquired from Montreal in a spring-training trade for Matt Herges, he
was a gangly, 6-foot-4, 205-pound right-hander with a 97-mph fastball
and mechanics that would perplex many a pitching coach.</TE>
<TE>   Less than four months later, Mota has emerged as one of the
Dodgers' most effective short relievers, with a 1-0 record and 2.45
earned-run average after two perfect innings Friday against Arizona.</TE>
<TE>   After a quick spring-training overhaul under the supervision of
pitching coach Jim Colborn and a two-week stint at triple-A Las Vegas
in late April, Mota, 29, has shown enough in 21 appearances that he
could join Paul Quantrill and Giovanni Carrara as someone Manager Jim
Tracy turns to in critical late-game situations.</TE>
<TE>   "Mota has done some things that would make me consider using him
in some situations that I wouldn't have entertained earlier in the
season," Tracy said. "You do consider the experience factor--he
hasn't been in a pennant race before--but I would not hesitate using
him in the seventh or eighth innings because he's given me every
reason to think I can."</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers envisioned Mota as a future closer or setup man, but
with Carrara struggling somewhat, that future could come sooner than
expected. Mota feels he's up to the task.</TE>
<TE>   "That's what I'm looking for, to compete with those guys for a
chance to pitch in those kinds of situations," Mota said. "I want to
show people I can do the job."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Darren Dreifort, who threw 62 pitches during a bullpen session
Friday, will take his rehabilitation from elbow surgery to the next
level Monday when he throws a simulated game. Dreifort will throw to
hitters, without a protective screen in front of the mound, and will
take a break or two to simulate game-like conditions. After a series
of simulated games, Dreifort will begin a minor league rehabilitation
assignment in hopes of returning some time in August.... The late
Akihiro "Ike" Ikuhara, the 27-year club executive who played a
prominent role in the Dodgers' many international, amateur and
professional baseball exchanges, was inducted into Japan's Baseball
Hall of Fame Friday during ceremonies at the Japanese All-Star game
in Tokyo.</TE>

<HD>L.A. Fair Buys Auction Firm</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Lance Pugmire</AU>
<BD></BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>In a purchase that provides for flexibility in its future horse
racing business, the Los Angeles County Fair Assn. on Friday bought
controlling interest of Barretts Equine Limited, which conducts five
annual thoroughbred auctions at the Pomona Fairplex.</LD>
<LD>   Terms were not disclosed. The agreement between James Henwood, the
fair's president and chief executive, and Fred Sahadi, Barretts
Equine Sales owner, follows the California Horse Racing Board's
decision last month to reject Henwood's request to move the
63-year-old fair meet from Fairplex Park to Santa Anita.</LD>
<LD>   By acquiring majority control of Barretts, Henwood has removed a
restriction that could have complicated either expansion of the
five-eighths-mile track in Pomona or a continued effort to move the
17-day September horse racing meet to Santa Anita. Henwood said he
has not dropped the idea of a relocation but insisted he has no
intention to fold, move or resell the auction.</LD>
<TE>   "That's all speculation, but [Henwood] has paid a significant
amount of money and it makes good sense he will maximize our value,"
said Jerry McMahon, Barretts president and chief executive.</TE>
<TE>   Barretts, which has existed since 1990, offers its most
prestigious auction--of 2-year-olds in training--each March. In 1996,
five horses from the Barretts auction ran in the Kentucky Derby.</TE>
<TE>   "The real motivation of this purchase was to put the auction under
a single ownership group, which will allow the business to better
advance and expand," Henwood said.</TE>

<HD>Cienfuegos Set for Return to Lineup</HD>
<DH>Soccer: Midfielder, who has been benched the last four
games, gets another chance against Rapids.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PAUL GUTIERREZ</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>A familiar face, and recognizable feet, will be running the show for
the Galaxy today when it meets the Colorado Rapids at Denver.</LD>
<LD>   Mauricio Cienfuegos, who has been the Galaxy's playmaking
midfielder since Major League Soccer's inception in 1996, will be in
the starting lineup for the first time in four weeks.</LD>
<LD>   Cienfuegos' return was made possible by Simon Elliott leaving the
Galaxy this week to join New Zealand's national team for the Oceania
Nations Cup tournament.</LD>
<TE>   "Obviously, Simon's absence has offered an opportunity for
Mauricio to get back on the field," Galaxy Coach Sigi Schmid said
Friday before leaving for Denver. "But he's been training hard and
he's really been sharp. He's been as sharp as he's been in a couple
of years.</TE>
<TE>   "He's been sharp in his play and with his passing and he's been
mentally sharp as well."</TE>
<TE>   Cienfuegos, 34, downplayed the significance of his returning to
the starting lineup and declined to be interviewed for this story.</TE>
<TE>   But his numbers this season more than tell the story.</TE>
<TE>   Cienfuegos, whose last start came in the Galaxy's 5-0 blowout loss
at New York/New Jersey on June 15, is arguably the most popular
member of the Galaxy and is one of five MLS players to be named an
All-Star in each of the league's first six years.</TE>
<TE>   But this season, he is embroiled in the worst slump of his career.
In 12 games, he has no goals and two assists.</TE>
<TE>   This after entering the season tied for ninth on the league's
all-time scoring leader list with Marco Etcheverry at 136 points.</TE>
<TE>   Cienfuegos was also fourth on the MLS assists list with 70 in 163
games, behind Carlos Valderrama (98), Etcheverry (86) and Preki (83).</TE>
<TE>   Schmid, though, said Cienfuegos took his midseason benching well.</TE>
<TE>   "I think he's a good professional," Schmid said. "All you have to
do is look at him to understand all he's had to do to achieve
everything he has in his career. He's done it with hard work and
discipline. He set a great example for the younger guys.</TE>
<TE>   "He obviously has to play differently than he did earlier in his
career but his eyes are still as good as ever."</TE>
<TE>   With Cienfuegos benched, the Galaxy went 2-2 and their midfield
seemed adrift at times, though Schmid has said that with Cienfuegos
out, the Galaxy was a more versatile team.</TE>
<TE>   Against Colorado, meanwhile, the Galaxy will be facing a team
without two of its players because of suspensions by the MLS
disciplinary committee.</TE>
<TE>   Forward John Spencer, who had a game-winning goal in overtime
against the Galaxy at the Rose Bowl on April 27, has been suspended
for two games and fined $5,000 for his major game misconduct against
the Chicago Fire on July 4.</TE>

<LD>Hubert Green tied the course record with a nine-under-par 63 at the
TPC of Michigan on Friday, taking a three-stroke lead after the
second round of the Senior Players Championship at Dearborn, Mich.</LD>
<LD>   Hale Irwin, who began the day with a two-stroke lead after setting
nine-hole and first-round records, shot a one-over 73 and fell into a
three-way tie for second with Howard Twitty and Mike McCullough, who
both shot 68.</LD>
<LD>   Green followed up a solid opening round with a spectacular one for
a two-round total of 10-under 134.</LD>
<TE>   He shot a 71 on Thursday, getting birdies on Nos. 17 and 18. Green
birdied the first three holes Friday and seven of the first 13. He
finished strong again--and earned a little cushion--with birdies on
the final two holes.</TE>
<TE>   Green hit 16 greens in regulation and admitted he was lucky on a
couple of holes.</TE>
<TE>   At 14, his drive landed in the water, but he recovered by hitting
a five-wood onto the green and saving par with a four-footer. He
missed the fairway and the green at 18, then holed a chip shot from
about 60 feet.</TE>
<TE>   "I'll never say the round could have been lower, you'll never hear
that come out of my mouth," Green said. "Don't get too piggish out
here. The golfing gods have the last say and they have two more
rounds here before they are through with me."</TE>
<TE>   Jim Colbert set the course record in 1995.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Gary Player withdrew from British Open qualifying because of a rib
injury, formally ending his record of 46 consecutive appearances in
golf's oldest championship.</TE>
<TE>   Player, 66, is no longer exempt to the British Open because it has
an age limit of 65 for past champions. He won the Open three times,
the first one at Muirfield in 1959, and is one of only five men to
have won the career Grand Slam.</TE>
<TE>   Player said he pulled rib muscles by working out too hard in his
attempt to become the oldest man to make it through the 36-hole
qualifier, which begins Sunday.</TE>
<TE>   Player also said he might have to withdraw from the British Senior
Open the following week.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Kirk Triplett shot a seven-under 64 to tie him for the lead with
Tommy Armour and Jeff Sluman at the Greater Milwaukee Open with a
36-hole total of 12-under 130.</TE>
<TE>   Sluman shot a 66, while Armour had a 67.</TE>
<TE>   Steve Lowery (65) was one shot behind the leaders and Chad
Campbell (66), Robert Damron (63), Dan Forsman (63) and Bo Van Pelt
(68) were another stroke back.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Laura Diaz made four birdie putts of at least 12 feet in a
seven-under 64 that gave her a two-stroke lead after two rounds of
the Jamie Farr Kroger Classic at Sylvania, Ohio.</TE>
<TE>   The round was the lowest of Diaz's four-year professional career.
Her eight-under 134 total was two strokes better than rookies Beth
Bauer and Jeanne-Marie Busuttil and veteran Kris Tschetter.</TE>
<TE>   Nancy Lopez holed an eight-iron from 134 yards on No. 6 for her
10th career ace. She shot a 70 to qualify and was right on the cut
line at 144.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Sweden's Fredrik Jacobson shot a six-under 65 for a four-stroke
lead after two rounds of the Scottish Open at Luss, Scotland.</TE>
<TE>   Former Masters and British Open champion Sandy Lyle followed an
opening 67 with a 68 for a 36-hole total of 135.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Nationwide, one of the country's largest insurance and financial
service organizations, signed a five-year deal to be the umbrella
sponsor for the PGA Tour's developmental tour.</TE>
<TE>   Nationwide will replace Buy.com as the sponsor, giving the tour
its fourth name since it began as the Hogan Tour in 1990. Nike also
was a tour sponsor.</TE>

<DL>BRITTAS BAY, Ireland</DL>
<LD>Tiger Woods prepared for next week's British Open by shooting a
course-record five-under-par 67 at the European Club on the east
coast of Ireland.</LD>
<LD>   Woods played the 7,300-yard links course Friday amid tight
security with David Duval, Mark O'Meara and Scott McCarron.</LD>
<LD>   The Masters and U.S. Open champion called the course the perfect
preparation for the British Open next week at Muirfield in Scotland.</LD>
<TE>   "This is great. This links is tough and demanding and just what I
needed right now," Woods said.</TE>
<TE>   At the 420-yard No. 17, Woods hit his drive into deep rough, but
he hit a nine-iron on his second shot and nearly hit the pin, drawing
gasps from a small gallery.</TE>
<TE>   After the round, course owner Pat Ruddy conferred honorary life
membership on the foursome.</TE>

<HD>Momentum Is On Dollase's Side Now</HD>
<DH>Horse racing: Trainer seeks to rebound from stewards'
ruling against Futural in last year's Hollywood Gold Cup.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>BILL CHRISTINE</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Having watched Momentum's final breeze before Sunday's $750,000
Hollywood Gold Cup, trainer Craig Dollase left the clockers' booth on
the backstretch and headed back to his barn.</LD>
<LD>   Halfway there, Dollase homed in on the significance of his running
a horse in Hollywood Park's richest race for the second consecutive
year.</LD>
<LD>   "They owe me one," Dollase said.</LD>
<TE>   The reference was to the Gold Cup last year, when Dollase's
Futural appeared to be a convincing 1 1/2-length winner. But after
nine minutes of hand-wringing, the three stewards ruled that the
winner, having ducked in on Skimming near the eighth pole, had bumped
the other horse hard enough to be disqualified. Aptitude, a
stablemate of Skimming and never a threat to overtake Futural in the
stretch, was moved up from second to first. Futural was dropped to
third place, behind Skimming, the horse he had fouled. The purse
difference between first and third place was $405,000.</TE>
<TE>   With the 63rd Gold Cup a day away, many of the principals from
last year's polemic are back for more, though for some the roles have
changed. With Momentum, Dollase will again be running against trainer
Bobby Frankel, who trained both Aptitude and Skimming. This time
Frankel has Milwaukee Brew, the 8-5 morning-line favorite. Garrett
Gomez, who rode Skimming last year, has switched sides and is aboard
Momentum, at 4-1 the third choice. Laffit Pincay, whose win with
Aptitude was No. 8 in the Gold Cup, is riding the dangerous
speedster, Sky Jack, as he bids to break a tie with Bill Shoemaker.</TE>
<TE>   If there is lingering bitterness within Dollase from last year's
disqualification, it doesn't show. He is the 31-year-old son and
former assistant of Wally Dollase, a successful horseman, and in
1998, at 27 and in his first full year away from his father, he
became the youngest trainer to saddle a Breeders' Cup winner with
Reraise in the Sprint at Churchill Downs.</TE>
<TE>   "Last year was a heart-wrenching experience," Dollase said. "I
can't really fault the stewards, because they have a job to do, but I
knew I ran the best horse and it was a tough pill to swallow."</TE>
<TE>   Futural has run well in only one important race since the Gold
Cup. Four weeks later, he finished second to Skimming, a horse who
owns Del Mar, in the San Diego Handicap. In August, as the favorite
in the $1-million Pacific Classic, Futural ran last, beaten by more
than 22 lengths.</TE>
<TE>   "He came out of that race with hind-end problems, and he was never
the same Futural after that," Dollase said.</TE>
<TE>   Futural's last stakes start under Dollase was this year's Santa
Anita Handicap. He was favored again but finished 12th, beating two
horses, and was almost 21 lengths behind Milwaukee Brew, who
registered his first Grade I win. Futural ran three more times for
Dollase, none of them stakes, and on June 6, for $80,000, the
6-year-old gelding was claimed by trainer J.T. Marshall as he ran
last at Hollywood Park. In his first start for Marshall, last Sunday
at Pleasanton, Futural was fourth in the $50,000 Alamedan Handicap.</TE>
<TE>   "He's just not sharp anymore," Dollase said. "It's sad. You hate
to see him going down the way he is. I just hope they provide a nice
home for him when he's through running."</TE>
<TE>   Momentum, who runs for J. Paul Reddam of Laguna Beach, one of
Dollase's biggest clients, ran his first seven races on grass for
another stable in England. Bought by Reddam and sent to Dollase last
fall, Momentum finished second to Mizzen Mast in a minor grass stake
at Hollywood Park in November, and has run only on dirt ever since.</TE>
<TE>   "He trained well over dirt, and he has Foolish Pleasure on the
bottom [the dam's side of his pedigree]," Dollase said. "So we
thought he'd take to it."</TE>
<TE>   After winning the Native Diver Handicap at Hollywood in his dirt
debut in December, Momentum has gone winless this year. The
4-year-old colt's training was interrupted when he came out of the
Strub, at Santa Anita in February, with a cracked hoof on his left
foreleg. Since coming back, Momentum has been second in an allowance
at Hollywood in late May and on June 15 he was third, beaten by one
length, as Milwaukee Brew and Bosque Redondo ran 1-2 in the
Californian.</TE>
<TE>   The Gold Cup is 1 1/4 miles, an eighth of a mile farther than the
Californian. In Momentum's only start at that distance, on the grass
in 2001, he finished seventh.</TE>
<TE>   "The distance will be no problem," Dollase said. "We are picking
up weight [going from 118 to 124 pounds]. The lone if is Sky Jack.
You just hope he's not allowed to dictate the pace. When they pop the
gate, some decisions will have to be made. But what do they say? That
the third race off a layoff ought to be a horse's best? Well, that's
the position my horse will be in."</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Came Home is the 7-5 morning-line favorite for the $500,000 Swaps
Stakes, which will also be run Sunday. Others entered are Tracemark,
5-2; Like A Hero, 6-1; Fonz's, 8-1; Gobi Dan, 12-1; and Sugar Babe
and Battler Bob, both 15-1. John Toffan and Trudy McCaffery, who race
Came Home in a partnership, have won the Swaps with Free House in
1997 and Bien Bien in 1992 ....Trainer Bobby Frankel said Starine has
been retired. The 5-year-old mare won nine of 31 starts and earned
$963,913. Among her wins was the Grade I Matriarch at Hollywood Park
last year ....Tout Charmant, after being bred to Storm Cat, didn't
stay in foal and has been returned to training with Ron McAnally
....The Ramona Handicap, Del Mar's Grade I grass race for fillies and
mares, has been renamed the John C. Mabee Ramona Handicap, in honor
of one of the founders of the Del Mar Thoroughbred Club, who died in
April. The race will be run on July 27.</TE>

<LD>A few horses familiar to local fans will be busy in Florida and New
York today.</LD>
<LD>   Crack sprinters Crafty C.T., Echo Eddie and Orientate will take on
four others in the $400,000 Smile Sprint Handicap at Calder. The
Smile is one of six sprint stakes worth $1.4 million in purses that
will be run at the Miami track. The four major races--the Smile, the
$250,000 Azalea Breeders' Cup, the $250,000 Carry Back and the
$400,000 Princess Rooney Handicap--make up a pick four with a
guaranteed pool of $250,000.</LD>
<LD>   Crafty C.T., third in the Metropolitan Handicap won by Swept
Overboard on May 27 at Belmont Park, shortens to six furlongs today
for trainer Howard Zucker and first-time rider Jerry Bailey.</LD>
<TE>   David Flores will be at Calder to ride Echo Eddie for owners David
and Rita Milch and trainer Darrell Vienna; Mike Smith will be there
to handle Orientate for owners Bob and Beverly Lewis and trainer
Wayne Lukas.</TE>
<TE>   One of the entrants in the Azalea, a wide-open race for 3-year-old
fillies, is Ragin T Rex, a former claimer who has won three in a row
for Thomas and Thomas Racing and trainer Warren Stute.</TE>
<TE>   Captain Squire, the winner of the Lazaro Barrera on May 27 at
Hollywood Park, is among the contenders in the Carry Back. Xtra Heat
will be favored to win for the 22nd time in 28 starts in the Princess
Rooney.</TE>
<TE>   At Belmont Park, meanwhile, Startac will make his first start for
trainer Bill Mott in the $150,000 Bowling Green Handicap at 1 3/8
miles on the turf.</TE>
<TE>   Race of the day: Course specialists Fair Apache and Full Moon
Madness top a small field in the $75,000-added Answer Do Stakes at 5
1/2 furlongs on the turf. The race is the third on the card at
Hollywood Park.</TE>
<TE>   Who's hot: Cornelio Velasquez. He is the runaway leader in the
jockey standings at Calder, winning at about a 28% clip.</TE>
<TE>   Who's not: Dynamic Pic. The 6-year-old mare, who will run in
today's fifth at Belmont Park, has lost 50 of 51 starts.</TE>
<TE>   Exotically speaking: A pick three singling Full Moon Madness in
the third, Lauraelise in the fourth and using Jazznwithwindy,
Flowington, She Rocks, Real Paranoide and Go Gal Go in the fifth.</TE>
<TE>   Winners (through Thursday): Previous day/meet total: 2/149. Money:
Previous day/meet total: $10/$847.20. Total money bet: $980.</TE>

<HD>Arbitrator Granted Extension as Talks Resume</HD>
<DH>Baseball: Das is given until Aug. 1 to rule on contraction,
which holds key to other major issues.</DH>

<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Players and owners made progress on the concept of a worldwide draft
as baseball labor talks resumed Friday in New York, and an arbitrator
ruling on the contraction grievance was granted an extension.</LD>
<LD>   Arbitrator Shyam Das, who heard almost three weeks of testimony
from nine witnesses spanning more than four months, had hoped to
reach a decision Monday on the grievance filed by the Major League
Baseball Players Assn., trying to prevent Commissioner Bud Selig from
unilaterally eliminating teams. However, Das requested an extension
from the sides, who agreed to give him until Aug. 1.</LD>
<LD>   Selig put off contraction until after the 2002 season after owners
were pummeled in the Minnesota courts, which ruled the Twins had to
honor their 2002 lease in the Metrodome. Das' ruling could provide
either side with a major bargaining chip in negotiations.</LD>
<TE>   As a result of the delay, owners and players agreed to extend
until Aug. 15 the deadline for the union to receive a tentative
schedule for the 2003 season. The process had been previously pushed
back from July 1 to Aug. 1.</TE>
<TE>   Contraction is an important issue in talks centered on increased
revenue sharing among the clubs and a luxury tax on teams with high
payrolls.</TE>
<TE>   "If we win, [the union is] going to make a proposal designed to
stop contraction," said Rob Manfred, baseball's vice president of
labor relations. "If they win, we're going to make a proposal
designed to authorize contraction.</TE>
<TE>   "One way or another, whenever the ruling comes, someone is going
to make a proposal on the topic."</TE>
<TE>   Das has several options, management and player sources said, after
deciding whether the owners' attempt to contract was collusive. He
could rule that contraction must be collectively bargained, or that
owners can move forward without union approval. And he might decline
to rule, deciding the issue is moot because the Twins are not going
to be eliminated.</TE>
<TE>   Many players believe owners are using the concept of contraction
as a negotiation ploy, hoping to scare the union into an agreement
with the threat of lost jobs. But Don Fehr, executive director of the
union, is not taking any chances.</TE>
<TE>   "I believe there are a lot of owners who think [contraction] is
viable," he said. "We have to treat as serious their continued
statements at the table that they have every intention to contract.
[The public] will have to make its own judgment as to whether that's
realistic."</TE>
<TE>   Back at the table, owners and the union did not address increased
revenue sharing among the clubs or a luxury tax on teams with high
payrolls, instead focusing on revising the amateur draft in the first
full negotiation session since June 27. The union agreed to one
worldwide draft, but the number of draft rounds is still at issue.</TE>
<TE>   The union had previously proposed conducting a worldwide draft in
two phases, international and American, creating two sets of
first-round draft picks and more big bonuses. It also wanted to
reduce both drafts to eight rounds from the current 50-round format,
creating more free agents. Owners are pushing for one 38-round draft.</TE>
<TE>   Currently, amateur players in the United States, including Puerto
Rico, and Canada are eligible for the draft in the year their
high-school class is graduated. In all other countries, players are
eligible to be signed as free agents if they turn 17 by the end of
the season they sign for.</TE>
<TE>   "[The union] proposed a single draft, which is a positive,"
Manfred said. "Unfortunately, they made no move on the number of
rounds.</TE>
<TE>   "They just combined the [proposed eight rounds of each draft] to
get 16, so we've still got a lot of issues to resolve in the area,
but they made a proposal. Obviously, that's a good thing."</TE>
<TE>   Fehr said there "really isn't much change [in reaching an
agreement], but we're hopeful our proposal on the draft will be
favorably received by the clubs."</TE>
<TE>   The sides are scheduled to return to the table Thursday. Baseball
has had eight work stoppages; players could walk out again in August
or September if negotiations continue to lag.</TE>

<TE>   Bud Selig allowed the players to go on strike after the 11th
inning of the All-Star game. This is no doubt a harbinger of things
to come.</TE>

<TE>   Baseball's microcosm of a season with a looming strike was all in
a nutshell after Tuesday's All-Star game.</TE>
<TE>   The final outcome was encompassed in the final score, which
included players, owners and fans.</TE>
<TE>   Result: Nobody wins.</TE>

<TE>   Dear Major League Baseball:</TE>
<TE>   Do yourself a favor, keep Bud Selig away from microphones,
television cameras and small children.</TE>
<TE>   He is George Costanza, Kato Kaelin, Jim (and Tammy Faye) Bakker,
Charlie Brown and Homer Simpson all in one. A dark cloud doesn't
follow him, he is the dark cloud hanging over baseball.</TE>
<TE>   The 2002 All-Star game had no real conclusion. Why is this not
surprising? These things just seem to happen ... to Bud Selig.</TE>
<TE>   Kevin Holten</TE>
<TE>   Manhattan Beach</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   The ending of the All-Star game was a disgrace, as is the proposed
"solution"--to expand the roster. The roster can be expanded to 50 a
team, but the same problem will result if the managers try to get
every player in the game. Between them, [Bob] Brenly and [Joe] Torre
went through 19 pitchers. Once again Major League Baseball has put
the interests of a few of its owners and managers above those of the
fans and of the game itself.</TE>
<TE>   At the hands of Selig and his minions, the storied "Midsummer
Classic" has become just another failed marketing gimmick devoid of
any meaning or content.</TE>
<TE>   Charles P. Reichmann</TE>

<TE>   Why is anyone surprised that former car salesman Selig would pull
a bait-and-switch?</TE>

<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   On a night when baseball honored its greatest hitter (a man who
served in two wars), and during a year when American soldiers have
died fighting terrorism, the All-Star game is terminated by an inept
commissioner fretting over how a player could possibly get injured in
an extra-inning game?!</TE>
<TE>   Disgusting.</TE>
<TE>   Adam Platts</TE>
<TE>   Northridge</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   On the one hand they tell us the All-Star game had to be called
because the pitchers were tired and didn't want to get out of
rotation for the rest of the season. On the other hand they tell us
there will be no rest of the season.</TE>
<TE>   Why not disband pro baseball and draft these guys into the
military? Let them work at a real job for a few thousand dollars a
month all year long.</TE>
<TE>   Somehow $5 million to $10 million a year plus all imaginable
expenses, perks and benefits to "play" a game six months a year won't
seem all that bad.</TE>
<TE>   Mike Glueck</TE>
<TE>   Newport Beach</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Any true baseball fan would have to agree with Selig's decision.
There is no point in risking injury to the sport's best pitchers just
to get a winner and a loser. But maybe the answer for future tied
All-Star games is to bring out each team's heaviest hitters and have
a one-round home run derby to decide the game. You'd save the
pitchers' arms while giving the fans a really great finale.</TE>
<TE>   Have we learned nothing from the smashing worldwide popularity of
soccer?</TE>
<TE>   Alan Toy</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   I'm not sure I understand all the crying over the All-Star tie:
Bonds hit a homer-and-a-half, Schilling struck out a bunch of
batters, every player on both sides got into the game and the fans
got an extra two innings of baseball.</TE>
<TE>   Does anybody really care who wins these meaningless exhibitions?
Certainly the players don't--witness a grinning Bonds lifting up
Torii Hunter after Hunter had robbed him of a round-tripper, and all
the other casual banter so deftly picked up by Fox's "Sounds of the
Game"--so why should we? Eleven innings and 14 runs was plenty enough
for this fan. Onward.</TE>
<TE>   Joel Rapp</TE>
<TE>   Los Angeles</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   If baseball is going to feature an All-Star pregame ceremony that
purports to honor America and to remember those who died on Sept. 11,
it would be entirely appropriate and fitting for the program to
include a "singer" (I use that word advisedly) who actually knows the
words to the national anthem.</TE>
<TE>   Rebecca S. Hertsgaard</TE>
<TE>   Anaheim</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   As a result of Tuesday's All-Star game ending in a tie, it seems
appropriate that Commissioner Selig was unable to determine what to
do with the Ted Williams All-Star MVP award at the same time that Ted
Williams' family is unable to decide what to do with Ted Williams.</TE>

<LD>When Major League Baseball betrayed its once-loyal fans by shutting
down in 1994, I vowed to boycott the sport for five years. It turned
out to be seven years before I finally regained enough interest to
become a fan again this year. What irony that my first season back
may well provide another example of the rampant greed and disrespect
that tars this once-respectable sport.</LD>
<LD>   With all that football and basketball have to offer, perhaps its
time to crown a new national pastime. This might be the break that
soccer has been waiting for.</LD>

<TE>   If my beloved Dodgers strike, or if they get locked out by Satan
Selig, even for one day, then I'm done. Finished. I will never come
back.</TE>
<TE>   I punish my body working construction every day just to survive
and raise a family. I get low pay, crummy health care, no retirement,
and I don't get to play a game. For my efforts I can afford to take
my daughter (in our 1974 VW Bug) to one game a year, where I am
subjected to price gouging on food, parking, merchandise and every
other thing management can think of to get my money. The amount of
advertising I am subjected to is nauseating.</TE>
<TE>   If I hear one more player tell me baseball is a business, I'll
bean him. Baseball is a game! Both the millionaire players and the
billionaire owners are wrong. Get a deal done.</TE>

<TE>   So Marvin Miller thinks baseball's strike situation is "like

is like no other union we've ever seen: chock full of spoiled rotten
millionaires.</TE>
<TE>   No one in history has done more damage to baseball fans than
Miller, and that includes Arnold Rothstein and network presidents.
Because the owners remain shortsighted and cowardly, the situation is
unlikely to change. If only Bob Costas were commissioner.</TE>

<LD>Regarding Bill Plaschke's July 7 column:</LD>
<LD>   As a longtime Dodger fan, I don't love it that Dave Roberts, Cesar
Izturis, Eric Gagne (and this year Paul Lo Duca) make minimal
salaries. It's unfair.</LD>
<LD>   I would like to suggest to Kevin Brown, Darren Dreifort and
whoever else is collecting money and not playing, take a page from
Ted Williams' book. He insisted on a 30% pay cut when he had a bad
year. I think Kevin and Darren would show a lot of class if they each
asked the Dodgers to pay them a million or two less for this year,
with the condition that it be instead added to the productive
players' salaries.</LD>

<HD>Bierbrodt Slowly Makes Way Back</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>ERIC STEPHENS</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Nick Bierbrodt couldn't have been more excited when spring training
started in February.</LD>
<LD>   Tampa Bay Manager Hal McRae had him penciled as the Devil Rays'
No. 3 starter after he was impressive after a July trade that brought
him from Arizona.</LD>
<LD>   Instead, it has been a nightmarish year for the former Long Beach
Millikan High star, who was a first-round draft pick by the
Diamondbacks in 1997.</LD>
<TE>   Bierbrodt, 24, had severe control problems in the spring that cost
him his spot on the opening day roster. But the left-hander appeared
to have solved his troubles during extended spring training and had
an encouraging five-inning start in June for the team's Class-A
affiliate in Charleston, S.C.</TE>
<TE>   Bierbrodt then suffered a setback that put his career and his life
in jeopardy. A few hours after a June 6 game against Greensboro,
Bierbrodt, RiverDog teammate Nick Vigue and Vigue's girlfriend
Melissa Sigmon, were sitting in a taxi in the drive-through lane of a
fast-food restaurant. A man riding a bicycle was playing a radio and
pulled up beside the taxi. Bierbrodt said something about the loud
rap music and an argument ensued.</TE>
<TE>   After a few moments, the man allegedly pulled out a gun and shot
into the back of the taxi. Bierbrodt was hit twice, one of the
bullets going through his right arm, through his diaphragm and into
his liver, where it remains. Doctors at the Medical University of
South Carolina opted not to remove the bullet, believing surgery was
a greater risk than leaving it there.</TE>
<TE>   Bierbrodt was in intensive care for four days and released from
the hospital June 15. He spent the next three weeks at his mother's
house in Long Beach before returning to Tampa last Sunday night.</TE>
<TE>   In his first public comments since the shooting, Bierbrodt said he
feared for his life. No arrest has been made.</TE>
<TE>   "I remember the instant the verbal altercation started and I
remember him pulling out a gun and not having a chance to say
anything or wasn't able to defend myself," he told Tampa-area
reporters. "He just pulled it out and shot me.</TE>
<TE>   "I told the driver I needed to go to the hospital. I told the
people I was with that if I didn't make it, to tell my family and
friends that I loved them."</TE>
<TE>   Tampa Bay General Manager Chuck LaMar was shocked when he heard
about the shooting.</TE>
<TE>   "I know that it happens in society but it really doesn't sink in
until it's one of your own," LaMar said in a telephone interview. "He
was really, really fortunate."</TE>
<TE>   LaMar said he is confident Bierbrodt will be with the Devil Rays
next spring. Bierbrodt said he hopes to begin a light rehabilitation
program in six to eight weeks. The shooting, though, has left an
impression that will last far longer than his wounds.</TE>
<TE>   "You learn to appreciate everything and live life to the fullest,"
Bierbrodt said.</TE>
<TE>   Dodger System</TE>
<TE>   Joel Hanrahan figured to be in the Dodgers' plans when the team
took him in the second round of the 2000 first-year draft. But if
nothing else happens in his pro career, the 20-year-old right-hander
will have his name etched in Vero Beach lore.</TE>
<TE>   Hanrahan got credit for his second no-hitter this season July 4 in
a 5-1 victory over Brevard County in the Class-A Florida State
League. It wasn't the normal, nine-inning variety, though. He gave up
a run in the first inning and the game was called in the middle of
the sixth because of rain. Since the game, having gone five full
innings, was official, Hanrahan became the first Dodger to throw two
no-hitters in a season since Sid Fernandez for Vero Beach in 1982.</TE>
<TE>   "I guess I'd put an asterisk next to it," Hanrahan said. "If it
was seven innings or eight innings, I'd feel it was more of a game."</TE>
<TE>   Brevard County's Brandon Watson scored the run when he led off the
game with a walk, stole second and later scored on a sacrifice fly by
Rich Lane.</TE>
<TE>   Hanrahan went all nine innings in no-hitting Jupiter on April 21.
For the season, the Norwalk, Iowa, native is 6-3 with a 3.21
earned-run average and has limited opposing hitters to a .214
average.</TE>
<TE>   * Jacksonville's Ricardo Rodriguez started the season rehabbing an
injured right shoulder, but the organization's minor league pitcher
of the year last season at Vero Beach has picked up where he left
off. Rodriguez, 24, is 5-2 with a 1.83 ERA for the Suns and got the
victory in the MLB Futures Game last Sunday in Milwaukee.</TE>
<TE>   Angel System</TE>
<TE>   Salt Lake reliever Francisco Rodriguez was the Angels'
representative in the Futures Game and he struck out Corey Hart of
Class-A High Desert to close a 5-1 victory for the World team over
the U.S. at Miller Park. In 57 2/3 innings in 33 games for triple-A
Salt Lake and double-A Arkansas, the 21-year-old right-hander has a
1.56 ERA and 11 saves with 85 strikeouts and only 18 walks.</TE>
<TE>   * Casey Kotchman, the team's No. 1 draft pick last season, is
having a solid first full season. The son of Angel rookie league
Manager Tom Kotchman is hitting .292 with four home runs and 42 runs
batted for Class-A Cedar Rapids.</TE>
<TE>   * Bobby Jenks has struggled with his control since his demotion
from Arkansas to Class-A Rancho Cucamonga. Jenks, a right-hander who
has been clocked as high as 100 mph, has 19 walks and six wild
pitches in 24 innings.</TE>
<TE>   Around the Nation</TE>
<TE>   Matt Harrington signed a contract with the Fort Worth Cats of the
independent Central League after the Long Beach Breakers released him
last week. It is the third professional contract with an independent
team in the last two years for Harrington, who remains the longest
holdout in draft history after being taken as the seventh overall
pick of the Colorado Rockies in 2000.</TE>
<TE>   Harrington, who turned down $4 million from the Rockies and $1.2
million from the San Diego Padres as a second-round pick last year,
has had a difficult time as a pro. The former Palmdale High standout
was battered for five runs and five hits while walking three in 1 2/3
innings in his debut for Fort Worth last Sunday. Tampa Bay currently
has Harrington's rights after taking him in the 13th round last
month.</TE>
<TE>   * Billy Traber improved his record to 13-2 with his seventh
consecutive victory for Cleveland's double-A affiliate in Akron.
Traber, a former El Segundo High and Loyola Marymount player, leads
the Eastern League in victories.</TE>
<TE>   California League</TE>
<TE>   * Rancho Cucamonga broke a 14-game home losing streak Saturday
with a 4-3 victory over San Bernardino. Rich Fischer, a 21-year-old
right-hander who pitched for San Bernardino Valley College, struck
out 11 for the third time this season and leads the minor leagues
with 127 strikeouts.</TE>
<TE>   * Lancaster JetHawk outfielder Victor Hall tied a franchise record
with seven RBIs Wednesday in a 21-2 victory over San Bernardino. Hall
was hit by a pitch with the bases loaded, hit a three-run home run
and drove in three others with two more hits.</TE>

<HD>Greene's Rome Rebound: He Runs Year's Fastest 100</HD>

<BD>From Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Maurice Greene ran the fastest 100 meters of the year Friday,
clocking 9.89 seconds at the Golden Gala at Rome.</LD>
<LD>   "The dog came out a little today. But as the year goes on, you'll
see more dog," the world record-holder said, pointing to a bulldog
tattooed on his left arm.</LD>
<LD>   Greene led all the way in beating fellow American Tim Montgomery,
who was second in 9.94 at Rome's Stadio Olimpico.</LD>
<TE>   Greene's time, just short of his world record of 9.79, followed
some lackluster performances by the reigning world and Olympic
champion, who won at the Gaz de France last week after two
consecutive losses.</TE>
<TE>   The 27-year-old, who had said earlier in the week that he had a
cold from competing in the rain in Paris, appeared nervous before the
race, wiping his brow several times. But he stuck his tongue out in
trademark fashion and shook his head restlessly, and the tension
seemed to be gone after the race.</TE>
<TE>   Marion Jones clinched her third consecutive Golden League win in
the women's 100, clocking 10.89 on the stadium's newly fitted track.</TE>
<TE>   Gail Devers won her seventh consecutive race of the season with a
12.51 in the 100 hurdles.</TE>
<TE>   Felix Sanchez of the Dominican Republic ran the year's fastest 400
hurdles (47.73) and American Walter Davis went 56 feet 10 1/4 inches
to win the triple jump.</TE>
<TE>   Tennis</TE>
<TE>   As expected, Martina Hingis, the former No. 1-ranked female tennis
player, has withdrawn from U.S. Open tuneup tournaments in San Diego,
Manhattan Beach and Montreal because she is recovering from left
ankle surgery. Her representatives indicated she will not play in the
U.S. Open in New York, either.</TE>
<TE>   Hingis, 21, who had the surgery in May, missed the French Open and
Wimbledon for the first time since she turned professional in 1994.
She had never missed the U.S. Open in that time period, either,
winning in 1997 and reaching the final two other times.</TE>
<TE>   Last year, Hingis reached the semifinals in San Diego and
Manhattan Beach, losing to Monica Seles in both tournaments.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Lindsay Davenport, the No. 9 player in the world, made her
comeback in the not-so-serious confines of World Team Tennis as a
member of the New York Buzz in a match against the Hartford FoxForce
at Hartford, Conn. She won 12 of 22 games in a combination of women's
singles, mixed doubles and women's singles.</TE>
<TE>   She underwent knee surgery in January to remove cartilage and lost
the strength in her leg after 10 weeks on crutches.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   James Blake beat fellow American Justin Gimelstob, 7-5, 7-5, and
Michael Llodra defeated Mardy Fish, 6-4, 1-6, 6-1, in the
quarterfinals of the Hall of Fame Championships grass-court
tournament at Newport, R.I. Blake is looking to become the first
top-seeded player to win the title in the tournament's 26 years.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Seventh-seeded Gaston Gaudio of Argentina ousted Marc Rosset of
Switzerland, 6-3, 7-6 (3), in the quarterfinals of the Swiss Open at
Gstaad. Alex Corretja advanced by defeating David Sanchez, 6-3,
6-3.... Top-seeded Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario defeated Magui Serna, 3-6,
6-2, 6-2, to advance to the semifinals of the French Community
tournament at Brussels. Virginia Ruano Pascual upset second-seeded
Austrian Barbara Schett, 6-4, 3-6, 6-1.... Top-seeded Guillermo Canas
lost to fellow Argentine Agustin Calleri, 6-3, 7-5, in the
quarterfinals of the Swedish Open at Bastad.</TE>
<TE>   Motor Sports</TE>
<TE>   A state appeals court ruled Florida's law restricting public
access to autopsy photos is constitutional but certified the matter
to the state Supreme Court for potential further review.</TE>
<TE>   The law, passed in March 2001 after the death of race car driver
Dale Earnhardt, who was killed in a crash in the final lap of last
year's Daytona 500, was being challenged by the Independent Florida
Alligator, which is published by Campus Communications.</TE>
<TE>   In its opinion, the Fifth District Court of Appeal in Daytona
Beach, Fla., said the viewing of autopsy photos is a violation of
privacy.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Cristiano da Matta, who has dominated the CART racing circuit this
season, posted the fastest lap during provisional qualifying for the
Marconi Grand Prix of Cleveland. He was clocked at 131.531 mph.</TE>
<TE>   Tony Kanaan was second at 130.510. Defending champion Dario
Franchitti was seventh following the first day of qualifying for
Sunday's race in 129.567.</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Rookie Ryan Newman won the pole for the Winston Cup's Tropicana
400 at Joliet, Ill., and second-year driver Kurt Busch qualified

<TE>   Newman turned a lap of 183.051 mph to earn his second Winston Cup
pole of the season and third of his career. Bill Elliott was third at
182.451.</TE>
<TE>   Mike Faria broke a secondary chain as he was pulling up to the

<DL>SCOTTSDALE, Ariz.</DL>
<LD>The Phoenix Coyotes signed right wing Tony Amonte to a $24 million,
four-year contract Friday in the most significant move of General
Manager Mike Barnett's 11 months with the team.</LD>
<LD>   The deal includes a $4.8 million signing bonus, back-loaded so the
bulk will be paid after the Coyotes move into a new arena, which
promises to turn their operating losses into profits.</LD>
<LD>   Amonte, a former Chicago Blackhawk who was an unrestricted free
agent, was signed for his offense. The Coyotes tied for 10th in the
NHL in goals but managed only seven in five playoff games as they
were eliminated by the San Jose Sharks in the first round.</LD>
<TE>   "I'm very excited to be joining the Coyotes," said Amonte, who
turns 32 next month. "They are building a great team and heading in a
new direction."</TE>

<HD>Olausson Comes Back to Ducks</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>Chris Foster</AU>
<BD>From Staff and Wire Reports</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Veteran defenseman Fredrik Olausson signed a one-year contract, plus
a team option, with the Ducks on Friday.</LD>
<LD>   The contract calls for a base salary of $1.1 million with an
incentive clause that would drive the total higher if Olausson plays
at least 70 games next season.</LD>
<LD>   "Freddy can bring offense to our team," General Manager Bryan
Murray said. "He also brings experience to the dressing room, which
will help show our young players how they have to play."</LD>
<TE>   Olausson, a 15-year veteran, returns to the Ducks for the third
time. He played for the Ducks during the 1995-96 and 1996-97 seasons,
then returned to the team from 1998-2000.</TE>
<TE>   He won his first Stanley Cup with Detroit last season, but he told
Red Wing officials he planned to return to his native Sweden and had
signed a contract to play with Farjestads in the Swedish league. The
Red Wings also attempted to re-sign him.</TE>
<TE>   Murray is banking that Olausson's puck-handling skills and
power-play abilities can help offset the loss of defenseman Oleg
Tverdovsky, who was traded to New Jersey last week.</TE>
<TE>   "It was a very exciting year for me last season," said Olausson,
who will turn 36 in October. "I had a little change of mind. When the
Ducks called and asked [if I] wanted to come there, I thought this
was a new challenge for me."</TE>
<TE>   The Ducks had the worst power play in the NHL and only Columbus
scored fewer goals. In 1998-99, Olausson had 10 power-play goals for
the Ducks, who had the NHL's best power-play unit that season.</TE>
<TE>   Olausson, Petr Sykora and center Adam Oates, another Duck
free-agent signing, bring plenty of power play and playoff
experience.</TE>
<TE>   "As a player, this shows us they are trying to make positive
moves," Duck defenseman Keith Carney said.</TE>
<TE>   Olausson, who has 145 career goals, was sidelined because of a
severe case of flu in January. He finished the season with two goals
and 15 points in 47 games, averaging 16 minutes per game. He did make
a significant contribution in the playoffs, including an overtime
goal against Colorado in Game 3 of the Western Conference finals.</TE>
<TE>   In other news, Murray said he was confident that forward Stanislav
Chistov, the Ducks' No. 1 pick in 2001, would be signed by Monday.
Teams have until Monday to sign European players. The deadline can be
extended to Aug. 15 if the team pays a substantial fee.</TE>
<TE>   Chris Foster</TE>
<TE>   *</TE>
<TE>   Tie Domi agreed to terms of a three-year contract to remain with
the Toronto Maple Leafs. Last season, Domi, 32, became Toronto's
career leader in penalty minutes with 1,777.... New York Ranger
forward Steve McKenna has signed with the Pittsburgh Penguins.
McKenna, a former King, had two goals and 144 penalty minutes in 54
games with the Rangers.</TE>

<HD>Ward, Astros Spoil Debut for Dempster</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Daryle Ward has found his home run swing.</LD>
<LD>   Ward homered and drove in three runs to help lead the Houston
Astros to a 6-3 victory over the Reds and Ryan Dempster, who made his
debut with Cincinnati on Friday night at Houston.</LD>
<LD>   It was Ward's third homer in 14 games. He hit only two in his
first 75 games and went 215 straight at-bats without one.</LD>
<TE>   "I just think I'm starting to face teams for the second time this
year," he said. "I'm starting to learn their pitchers better and kind
of have an understanding of how to go at them."</TE>
<TE>   "This is my first year to start and I had a lot to learn. And I
kind of got wore down the first half since I wasn't accustomed to
playing every day. The All-Star break did me a lot of good," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Dempster (5-9) went 3 2/3 innings in his first start for the Reds
since coming over from Florida in a trade Thursday. He allowed six
runs and six hits.</TE>
<TE>   "They are a team that hits mistakes well," Dempster said. "And
tonight I made too many.</TE>
<TE>   "A starting pitcher is supposed to give the team a chance to win.
I didn't do my job. I felt good out there. There were just a couple
of pitches I didn't execute on, one to [Richard] Hidalgo and one to
Ward," he said.</TE>
<TE>   Manager Jimy Williams likes what he sees in Ward, who is seven for
18 (.389) in his current five-game streak.</TE>
<TE>   "He's really stinging the ball, especially on that home run,"
Williams said. "I know him and [hitting coach] Harry Spilman have
spent a lot of time working on things lately. It's not easy to be a
good hitter."</TE>
<TE>   Houston won its fourth straight and 10th in 12 games.</TE>
<TE>   It was the third straight loss and sixth in eight games for the
Reds.</TE>
<TE>   Wade Miller (5-3) went five innings. He allowed three runs and
eight hits, struck out five and walked one. Since coming off the
disabled list May 29, Miller is 5-1 with a 4.29 ERA in nine starts
and the Astros are 8-1 in those games.</TE>
<TE>   Miller improved to 3-0 in six career starts against the Reds.
Billy Wagner pitched the ninth for his 16th save in 19 opportunities.</TE>
<TE>   The Astros scored three runs in the first inning on Julio Lugo's
leadoff homer, his fifth homer of the year, and a two-run double by
Hidalgo. Ward's two-run homer gave Houston a 5-2 lead in the third.</TE>
<TE>   Chicago 5, Florida 4--Florida center fielder Preston Wilson ran
into the ivy-covered wall with two out in the 16th inning and dropped
pinch-hitter Angel Echevarria's fly ball to give the Cubs a win at
Chicago.</TE>
<TE>   Wilson appeared to run down Echevarria's fly but did not hang onto
the ball as he ran into the wall. Wilson fell to the ground and
umpires immediately called it a no-catch. Corey Patterson scored
easily from third with the winning run on Echevarria's single. As the
Cubs celebrated, Wilson was checked out by trainers and walked off
the field under his own power.</TE>
<TE>   With two out in the 16th, Patterson and Todd Hundley each singled
off Carl Pavano (3-9). Pavano's first pitch to Echevarria was wild,
allowing Patterson and Hundley to advance.</TE>
<TE>   Fred McGriff homered and drove in three runs for the Cubs, who won
interim manager Bruce Kimm's first game at Wrigley Field.</TE>
<TE>   Philadelphia 9, New York 8--Pat Burrell and Scott Rolen both
homered and the Phillies held off a late rally to win at New York.
Down 9-5, the Mets loaded the bases with none out in the bottom of
the ninth inning, but Mike Piazza grounded into a double play, and
closer Jose Mesa hung on to preserve the victory.</TE>
<TE>   Piazza's double-play grounder scored a run that made it 9-6.
Pinch-hitter Joe McEwing had an RBI single and, after Edgardo
Alfonzo's infield hit, Jay Payton singled home a run. Mesa retired
Roger Cedeno on a grounder to short to end the game.</TE>
<TE>   San Diego 4, St. Louis 3--Bubba Trammell hit a three-run double in
the seventh inning and Ryan Klesko singled in the tiebreaking run in
the eighth for the Padres at San Diego. The Padres ended an
eight-game losing streak to the NL Central-leading Cardinals.</TE>
<TE>   With the score tied at 3-3, Mark Sweeney, pinch-hitting for
pitcher Mike Holtz (1-0), hit a leadoff single to snap an 0-for-22
slump and chase reliever Dave Veres (3-4). Pinch-runner Trenidad
Hubbard took second on Ramon Vazquez's groundout and scored on
Klesko's two-out single off Steve Kline.</TE>
<TE>   San Francisco 9, Colorado 0--Livan Hernandez pitched the third
shutout of his career, giving up four hits as the Giants won at San
Francisco. Rookie Damon Minor hit a two-run home run and Tsuyoshi
Shinjo drove in three runs as San Francisco won its third straight.
Hernandez (7-10), who snapped a four-game losing streak, matched his
season-high with eight strikeouts in his 21st career complete game.
He also added an RBI double in the eighth inning.</TE>
<TE>   Mike Hampton (5-10) was 12-1 with a 3.29 lifetime ERA against the
Giants going into the game. His only loss against them was in San
Francisco last July 18.</TE>
<TE>   Pittsburgh 9, Milwaukee 2--Brian Giles, Kevin Young and Jack
Wilson each hit two-run homers as the Pirates cruised at Milwaukee.
All of the Pirates' home runs came off Glendon Rusch (5-8), who fell
to 0-5 lifetime against Pittsburgh.</TE>

<HD>This Victory's a Throwaway for Braves</HD>

<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>MONTREAL</DL>
<LD>Expo Manager Frank Robinson wasn't cutting rookie Henry Mateo any
slack for a costly mistake.</LD>
<LD>   Mateo, making his first start of the season in place of Gold Glove
shortstop Orlando Cabrera, made a three-base throwing error in the
ninth inning Friday night that helped the Atlanta Braves score five
runs in the inning and go on to an 8-3 win over Montreal.</LD>
<LD>   "It's tough on him--it's tough on us," Robinson said. "We're not
missing the tough plays. We're not making the routine plays and that
costs us ballgames."</LD>
<TE>   Atlanta increased its National League East lead over second-place
Montreal to 11 1/2 games.</TE>
<TE>   The loss quieted a festive crowd of 14,256 at Olympic Stadium as
Cliff Floyd made his first appearance in an Expos' uniform since
1996.</TE>
<TE>   Floyd, acquired from Florida on Thursday, got a standing ovation
before grounding out in his first at-bat leading off the second. He
went 0 for 4.</TE>
<TE>   Trailing 3-1, Atlanta tied it in the eighth on Gary Sheffield's
two-run homer off T.J. Tucker.</TE>
<TE>   Vinny Castilla doubled to start the ninth off Tucker (4-1). Brave
pitcher Jason Marquis pinch-ran, and scored the go-ahead run when
Mateo bobbled pinch-hitter Wes Helms' grounder and then threw it past
first baseman Andres Galarraga.</TE>
<TE>   Mateo played in place of Cabrera, who was a late scratch because
of a sore left ankle. Rafael Furcal added a two-run triple, Julio
Franco hit an RBI single and Chipper Jones had a sacrifice fly.</TE>
<TE>   The Braves lost starter Greg Maddux when he left the game after
five innings, aggravating a strained left calf while running the
bases.</TE>

<HD>Umpire Is Guilty but Not Responsible</HD>

<LD>The Dodgers lost their second game in a row to Arizona on Friday
night. Their lead in the National League West is down to a half-game.
They had nobody to blame but themselves.</LD>
<LD>   They couldn't hurt Curt Schilling. Fair enough. Schilling is 15-3
this year. You beat the Diamondbacks by beating the others, after
Randy Johnson and Schilling.</LD>
<LD>   Which makes it worse, what happened Thursday night. An umpire's
mistake played a part in the Dodgers losing to the Diamondbacks and
Johnson, 4-3.</LD>
<TE>   Umpires can make as much as $285,000 a year. Plus $55,000 in
expense money. Plus first-class air fare. That's more than many
doctors make. And major league umpires don't have to buy malpractice
insurance or attend medical school. Nobody sues the umpire.</TE>
<TE>   Umpire Bill Hohn answered the door Friday evening. "Looking for
Larry [Young]?" Hohn asked ... hopefully, sheepishly. Young is the
umpiring crew chief for this crucial four-game Dodger-Diamondback
series. Hohn could have let Young make Hohn's excuses.</TE>
<TE>   Umpires don't have to answer the door or the questions. Hohn
didn't hide Friday, so give him credit. Hohn was not defensive (kind
of like the Dodgers Thursday night) nor was he evasive. Hohn said he
blew a call, a big call, a crucial call.</TE>
<TE>   But the thing is, when an umpire makes a huge mistake, he suffers
no consequences.</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers made three errors in Thursday's loss. Those mistakes
cost them runs and, as much as Hohn, the game. The Dodgers suffered
for their bobbles and mishandled balls. They lost.</TE>
<TE>   Hohn knew why reporters were knock-knock-knocking on Billy's door.
To ask the question. How in the world could such an obvious call have
been missed so badly? Hohn said he was sorry, that he was stunned,
shocked, surprised and frustrated by what he saw on television
replays. "I was wrong," Hohn said. "I was extremely shocked by what I
saw on the replay. I have no alibi. But when you see the replay, it
is a little too late."</TE>
<TE>   So Hohn was stand-up about his goof.</TE>
<TE>   In the bottom of the eighth inning of a one-run game between the
Dodgers and Diamondbacks, with Hiram Bocachica on first and running
on the pitch because there was a full count and two out, Mark
Grudzielanek sent a high fly ball down the right-field line.</TE>
<TE>   Diamondback right fielder Quinton McCracken made a clumsy,
near-diving try at the ball, which nicked his glove and dropped to
the field. In fair territory by nearly half a foot. And McCracken had
been in fair territory by more than that when the ball touched his
glove. Bocachica should have scored the tying run.</TE>
<TE>   And yet Hohn, the first-base umpire, ran up the line and called
the ball foul. Then Grudzielanek struck out. No run scored.</TE>
<TE>   Strangely, no Dodgers argued the bad call. Not Grudzielanek, not
first-base coach John Shelby. Manager Jim Tracy didn't take a step
toward the field, didn't make a move toward Hohn to argue the call.
Hohn wasn't surprised. He was sure he was right.</TE>
<TE>   Shelby said he didn't protest because "I didn't see it. There were
too many people in my way."</TE>
<TE>   Arizona first baseman Mark Grace, who had started running to the
ball, said, "I thought it was a fair ball all along. The next thing I
hear said is that it's a foul ball. So I thought it must be foul. I
looked at the replay and it wasn't. The funny thing about it was that
no one argued."</TE>
<TE>   The Dodgers should have argued.</TE>
<TE>   Tracy said he didn't argue because he couldn't see the play and no
one indicated to him that the call was wrong. While saying that "it
hurt" to watch the replay, Tracy also made it clear he was not going
to hold Hohn responsible for anything.</TE>
<TE>   He was going to hold his team responsible for everything. "It's a
character-maker," Tracy said. "I'm not going to sit here and point
fingers. You hate to see it happen in a game of that type of
significance. But before that we had made some mistakes in the game.
Now it's over. There's no need to belabor it."</TE>
<TE>   Hohn was booed Friday night when he took his spot behind home
plate to call the balls and strikes. That was his punishment.</TE>
<TE>   And Hohn's missed call wasn't the only one in Thursday's game. A
Steve Finley blast in the top of the eighth appeared from all replay
angles to have hit a fan's hands in the left-field corner. This
should have been a home run for Finley, but third-base umpire Fieldin
Culbreth ruled it a ground-rule double. Finley did score, which made
Culbreth's miscue palatable.</TE>
<TE>   But it doesn't make the mistakes more bearable.</TE>
<TE>   This is pennant-race time. It's been a long, depressing spell
since a Dodger team needed to worry about a missed call maybe costing
them something important. But if the Dodgers were to miss the
playoffs by a game, the consequence of every mistake they made all
season could be what kept them out of the postseason. Hohn's mistake
won't keep him out of anything.</TE>
<TE>   "I lost sleep over that call," said Hohn, who is in his 14th year
as a major league ump. "It's been a long time since I missed a fair
or foul call like that. I'm a pretty damn good umpire."</TE>
<TE>   Maybe so, and losing sleep wasn't wrong. But the Dodgers lost much
more.</TE>

<LD>Rhema McKnight piled up more than 200 all-purpose yards for the
North, but the effort wasn't enough as the South pulled away for a
23-10 victory in the Orange County all-star football game before
about 5,500 at Orange Coast College in Costa Mesa.</LD>
<LD>   Running back Robbie Dubois of Mission Viejo High and receiver
Akilah Lacey of Westminster each scored a touchdown and Steven
Berneking of Aliso Niguel kicked three field goals for the South,
which scored all 13 second-half points.</LD>
<LD>   McKnight, the La Palma Kennedy standout bound for Notre Dame, did
not score despite amassing 98 yards receiving, 99 yards on kickoff
returns and 18 yards rushing. Adam Stayberg of Villa Park scored the
North's only touchdown on a 31-yard reception from Kevin Brown of
Orange El Modena late in the second quarter. Nick Coromelas of Los
Alamitos kicked a 46-yard field goal for the North.</LD>
<TE>   Berneking put the South ahead for good when he kicked a 32-yard
field goal early in the third quarter to make it 13-10. Less than
three minutes later, Lacey scored on a 10-yard pass from Colt Brennan
of Santa Ana Mater Dei to give the South a 10-point edge.</TE>
<TE>   The North leads the series 22-18-3.</TE>

<LD>Darius Reid made his only reception count in the San Gabriel Valley
all-star football game at Arroyo High in El Monte.</LD>
<LD>   Reid, a 6-foot-1, 195-pound receiver from La Puente Bishop Amat
High, scored a touchdown on a nine-yard fade pass from quarterback
Richard Snyder of Chino Don Lugo to give the East its final six
points in a 12-7 victory over the West. Reid outjumped defensive back
Brian Golper of Arcadia for the reception early in the fourth
quarter.</LD>
<LD>   The West scored its only touchdown on the ensuing possession when
quarterback Martin Soto of Montebello Schurr threw a 24-yard
touchdown pass to Alex Koplin of L.A. Loyola with 8:28 to play. The
West had two more possessions, but was unable to gain a first down
during either series.</LD>
<TE>   Running back Marcus Nolan of West Covina South Hills was selected
as the East's most valuable player. Nolan rushed for a game-high 72
yards in 15 carries. Esteban Lopez of Claremont kicked field goals of
47 and 28 yards in the first quarter for the East.</TE>
<TE>   Koplin was chosen most valuable player for the West. He had three
receptions for 43 yards.</TE>

<KH>SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA AMATEUR GOLF</KH>
<HD>Pate Is Confused, but He's Also Leading by Two Shots</HD>
<DH></DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>PETER YOON</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>John Pate has no confidence in his golf game, he has no control over
his shots and he has no idea how he will play over the weekend in the
Southern California Golf Assn. Amateur Championship. What he has,
however, is the tournament lead after shooting rounds of 71 and 69 in
the first two rounds Friday at El Caballero Country Club for a
two-round total of two-under-par 140.</LD>
<LD>   Pate, 41, from Santa Barbara, was befuddled about how he ended up
with a two-stroke lead over USC sophomore Nico Bollini of Yorba Linda
and Stanford senior Ron Won of Irvine.</LD>
<LD>   "I pretty much pull-hooked every shot," said the older brother of
PGA Tour player Steve Pate. "I just made a bunch of putts. I have no
confidence going into tomorrow. I could shoot a million over the
weekend."</LD>
<TE>   Pate, who won the SCGA amateur championship at Industry Hills Golf
Club in 1999, was three under in his first round before bogeys on
three of his last four dropped him to even. He made four birdies and
a bogey in the afternoon. He said the first two rounds Friday were
vastly different from his start three years ago.</TE>
<TE>   "When I won, I hit a lot of good shots but didn't make any putts,"
Pate said. "Today, I made a lot of putts."</TE>
<TE>   Bollini, who was medalist last week in the North-South Amateur
championship at Pinehurst in North Carolina, was the first-round
leader with a 69. He endured a bogey-double bogey-bogey stretch on
the front nine of his 73 in the afternoon.</TE>
<TE>   Won, who dominated as a junior player at University High, has
struggled with his game since starting at Stanford, but he said
things are finally starting to turn around. His second-round 68 was
the low round of the day.</TE>
<TE>   Defending champion John Merrick of Long Beach is four shots behind
Pate after rounds of 70-74.</TE>

<HD>Sparks Show They Can Rebound in Many Ways</HD>
<DH>Pro basketball: A night after blowout loss in Seattle,
battle of boards is key in 82-76 overtime victory at Portland.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU></AU>
<BD>From Associated Press</BD>
<DL>PORTLAND, Ore.</DL>
<LD>DeLisha Milton converted a three-point play with 26 seconds left in
overtime as the Sparks ended Portland's franchise-record seven-game
winning streak with an 82-76 victory in front of 10,185 Friday night.</LD>
<LD>   Mwadi Mabika scored a career-high 32 points and had six rebounds
and six assists for the Sparks (15-3), who bounced back after being
blown out in Seattle on Thursday.</LD>
<LD>   Milton finished with a career-high 23 points and 13 rebounds and
Marlies Askamp had 11 points and 12 rebounds. The Sparks outrebounded
the Fire, 44-31.</LD>
<TE>   "The thing that Pat Riley used to say when I played with the
Lakers is, 'No rebound, no ring.' We understand that that is the
key," Spark Coach Michael Cooper said. "Both teams played an
exceptionally good basketball game."</TE>
<TE>   Said Milton: "That's one of our strengths as a team--rebounding on
both ends of the floor. When you're on the road, it's of the utmost
importance to rebound."</TE>
<TE>   The Sparks were able to force overtime despite the loss of star
Lisa Leslie, who fouled out with 6:40 left in regulation. Leslie had
seven points.</TE>
<TE>   Sylvia Crawley and DeMya Walker each scored 18 points for the Fire
(11-9).</TE>
<TE>   "We played well enough to win it," Portland Coach Linda Hargrove
said. "We had a chance and it's disappointing that we missed it."</TE>
<TE>   The game was close throughout, with neither team leading by more
than six points. There were 17 ties and 29 lead changes.</TE>
<TE>   "It took everything that we had to pull this one out," Cooper
said. "It's part of becoming a team to be reckoned with, you have to
take some ups and downs in the process of winning."</TE>
<TE>   The Sparks were without reserves Latasha Byears and Tamecka Dixon.</TE>
<TE>   Dixon missed her second consecutive game after the death of her
grandmother.</TE>
<TE>   Byears sat out while serving the first game of a two-game
suspension for fighting with Seattle's Michelle Marciniak on Thursday
in a 79-60 loss to the Storm. Byears was also fined $1,000.</TE>

<HD>Tennis Is Put on Defensive</HD>
<DH>Doping: Australian official says sport is 'heavily under
influence' of drugs, prompting WTA, ITF denunciations.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>LISA DILLMAN</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>Officials from the WTA Tour and International Tennis Federation
denounced recent comments made by a top Australian drug testing
official that the sport is "heavily under the influence of doping"
and that its anti-doping program is "a dud."</LD>
<LD>   Kevin Wulff, the WTA's chief executive officer, demanded a
retraction and an apology from John Mendoza, executive director of
the Australian Sports Drug Agency. Said Wulff: "We categorically
reject the claim that the success or physical condition of women's
tennis players today is proof of rampant drug use."</LD>
<LD>   ITF president Francesco Ricci Bitti said on Friday that the
"remarks were not only inaccurate and inappropriate but also
defamatory to our sport."</LD>
<TE>   Mendoza, who has been with the Canberra-based agency since 1996,
likened the current situation in tennis to the one swimming was
facing at the 1994 World Championships in Rome, and cycling shortly
before the drug arrests at the Tour de France in 1998.</TE>
<TE>   "In 1994 it was self-evident that doping had taken over women's
swimming," he told The Australian newspaper in Friday's editions.
"What Australian parent would want their daughter going into tennis?
If you want to be No. 1 in the world in women's tennis you are going
to have to be abnormal in body physique."</TE>
<TE>   Mendoza did not provide evidence to support his contentions.
Preliminary tests showed that two unidentified players tested
positive at the recent French Open, but the substances were reported
to be a banned stimulant and an anesthetic. The information was
released this week by the French agency, the Council to Prevent and
Fight against Doping, and the B sample had yet to be tested.
L'Equipe, the French sports daily, reported that one of the positive
tests was from a female, the other from a male.</TE>
<TE>   The issue of drugs in tennis came under sharper scrutiny at
Wimbledon. John McEnroe's ex-wife Tatum O'Neal alleged that he used
steroids late in his playing career. McEnroe refused to respond to
that allegation when questioned about it during Wimbledon.</TE>
<TE>   Also, two leading players, Venus Williams and Jennifer Capriati,
objected at Wimbledon to the WTA's plan to start unannounced,
out-of-competition drug testing, calling it an invasion of privacy.</TE>
<TE>   The WTA said Friday that every player ranked in the top 20 was
tested at least once in 2001, some as many as eight times. The total
number of tests was 318, a tour official said. The ATP, which runs
the men's tour, conducted 50 tests out of competition last year and
plans to double that number this year.</TE>
<TE>   Mendoza was critical of the ITF's efforts, telling The Australian:
"More than half the tests are done at the Grand Slams so the players
know when they will be tested.</TE>
<TE>   "There are smart short-acting steroids which can be combined with
growth hormone so the athlete can be on them three days before
competition and then test clean. No-notice out-of-competition testing
is the only true deterrent, and 50 tests is nonsense."</TE>

driving and illicit amphetamine use, the staunch German sprinter is
Team Telekom's default leader.</LD>
<TE>   "It's been clear from the beginning of the Tour that there was a
certain amount of pressure on me because of Jan Ullrich's absence,"
Zabel said. "That's why I'm happy we have a team that works
extraordinarily well together."</TE>
<TE>   Under heavy, gray skies and occasional light rain in Normandy, the
riders streaked through quaint villages dotted with the region's
traditional half-timbered houses and geraniums spilling from
windowsills.</TE>
<TE>   Spain's Once team successfully defended the yellow jersey, chasing
down breakaways to keep the overall lead in Igor Gonzalez de
Galdeano's hands. U.S. Postal stayed in the hunt when it needed to
and protected Lance Armstrong's position in third place, seven
seconds off the pace.</TE>
<TE>   However, a breach of Tour etiquette threatened to dissolve the
gentlemen's harmony in the main pack.</TE>
<TE>   Traditionally, riders refrain from attacking if one of the leaders
has to take a bathroom break, giving his team a chance to usher him
back to the main pack. But when Gonzalez de Galdeano paused at the
77-mile mark, riders from the Domo-Farm Frites team took off. After
several riders, including Armstrong, wheeled up and expressed their
strong displeasure, the errant Domo riders apologized and dropped
back into the pack.</TE>
<TE>   At the finish, Zabel staved off what has become a routine late
charge from Australia's Robbie McEwen and Spain's Oscar Freire to
take his 12th career stage win in the 123.9-mile endurance test.</TE>
<TE>   The victory ties Zabel, 32, for the lead among active riders with
Armstrong, the defending champion, and flamboyant Mario Cipollini.
The overall record, 34, is held by five-time champion Eddy Merckx.</TE>
<TE>   Race organizers began awarding the green jersey in 1953. Racers
accumulate points at intermediate sprint points and some stage
finishes.</TE>
<TE>   Zabel won his first Tour stage in 1995, and his string of sprint
titles started the next year. He has twice won three stages in one
Tour, and also twice collected the honor without winning a stage in
the race.</TE>
<TE>   The pack is down to 185 riders. Lotto's Rik Verbrugghe did not
start because of injuries incurred in a crash Thursday, and Alexandr
Shefer of Alessio wiped out on a sharp right-hand turn and was taken
from the course by ambulance.</TE>

<HD>It's the Latest Teen Sensation</HD>
<DH>Triathlon: More young athletes are competing in the
endurance races, and the sport's national body is already scouting
for future Olympians.</DH>
<SE></SE>
<AU>DAN ARRITT</AU>
<BD>TIMES STAFF WRITER</BD>
<DL></DL>
<LD>They wear cargo shorts, faded T-shirts and baseball caps facing
backward--the usual teenage boy stuff--but Kyle Hughes and Gordon
Withers aren't typical athletes among their peer group.</LD>
<LD>   On Sunday, they will compete in the Pacific Coast Triathlon,
having already joined a growing number of youths participating in a
test of endurance that combines swimming, biking and running.</LD>
<LD>   "Ever since the Olympics, a lot of younger people are coming out
to compete," said Hughes, a Lake Forest resident and two-time
national age-group champion. "It's really nice to see."</LD>
<TE>   The wave of new participants, spurred by the debut of triathlon at
the 2000 Sydney Games, led USA Triathlon, the sport's national
governing body, to quickly develop a pipeline for future
Olympic-caliber athletes.</TE>
<TE>   The organization recently began a detailed identification and
development program for athletes ages 15-23, one that includes Hughes
and Withers, both 15, as card-carrying members. The group mines for
top prospects while satisfying newcomers by sanctioning youth races
and urging race directors to add youth divisions to adult races.</TE>
<TE>   "We've been pretty successful," said Ric Rosenkranz, athlete
development director for USA Triathlon. "I think a lot more kids are
starting to see [triathlon] as a sport."</TE>
<TE>   The Pacific Coast Triathlon, which will be contested at Crystal
Cove Park near Laguna Beach, added a 13-and-under division this year
over a separate, shorter course. Instead of an 800-meter swim,
12-mile bike and three-mile run over the regular course, younger
competitors will swim 200 meters, bike six miles and run a mile.</TE>
<TE>   "[The new division] is a good idea," said Withers, who will be a
sophomore at Irvine University High in the fall. "It will bring more
kids to the race and they won't have to worry about such a long
course."</TE>
<TE>   National recruiters track results from across the country,
scanning for top finishers in the age-group categories. They also
disperse information at events such as swimming and track and field
meets.</TE>
<TE>   Athletes are further identified through the USA Triathlon Under-23
National Race Series, as well as several regional time trials in the
swim and run, all competed at the Olympic distance--1,500-meter swim,
24.8-mile bike, 6.2-mile run--and format. Qualified athletes are then
selected for testing and training camps at various Olympic training
centers in the U.S., including the national triathlon training center
in Clermont, Fla.</TE>
<TE>   Regional camps are conducted for athletes such as Hughes and
Withers, who have shown the potential to make the national team.</TE>
<TE>   Hughes finished second among competitors 15 to 17 two weeks ago in
the first race of a series. He is favored to win his third
consecutive national championship, adding to the titles he won in the
13-15 division. Withers finished fifth in the same race, which
consisted of a 500-meter swim, 10.8-mile bike and 4.4-kilometer run.
Paul LeBarton, who will be a senior at Laguna Hills High, was sixth.
The next race in the series will be July 20 in Traverse City, Mich.</TE>
<TE>   Cyle Sage, former junior national team coach and athlete
development director at the U.S. Olympic Training Center, is familiar
with Hughes and Withers and believes both have Olympic potential. His
major concern is that they don't burn out on competition.</TE>
<TE>   "It doesn't matter how good a 15- or 16-year-old you are," he
said. "We want to know what you're doing when it comes time for the
Olympic trials. [Hughes and Withers] are still developing. They need
to be good for two Olympic qualifiers, in 2008 and 2012."</TE>
<TE>   Hughes was 7 when he competed in his first triathlon, an IronKids
event in Sacramento. He remembers feeling like a nerd at the race.
While the rest of the competitors mounted multi-gear road bicycles,
he rode a single-gear BMX dirt bike. He immediately put a new road
bike on his wish list.</TE>
<TE>   "My dad told me to try a few more races," Hughes said. "Now, it
has been eight years, I'm still going strong and I love it every
day."</TE>
<TE>   Hughes, who has a best of 16 minutes 10 seconds in a 5-kilometer
road race, has been home-schooled. He hoped to compete for the El
Toro High cross-country team this fall while continuing his home
schooling, but a new National Federation rule will most likely limit
him to training runs with the team.</TE>
<TE>   Withers usually finishes behind Hughes when they compete, but Sage
believes he has as much potential. Withers competed in his first
triathlon less than two years ago.</TE>
<TE>   "Gordon looks very promising," Sage said. "He has made some big
strides from one year to the next."</TE>
<TE>   Hughes and Withers will compete in their age group when the
Pacific Coast Triathlon begins at 6 a.m., but will start in the
opening wave, alongside professionals and anyone else who finished in
the top 150 the previous two years. That start will offer them a
chance to gauge themselves against the best in the sport, a level
they soon hope to join.</TE>
